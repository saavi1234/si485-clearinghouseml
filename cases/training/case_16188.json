    "summary": "<p>This action, filed by the City of Los Angeles, California on Sept. 29, 2017, challenged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)'s imposition of immigration-related conditions on federal funding to the city. The plaintiff, represented by its legal department and the law firm Covington & Burling, filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.</p><p>Los Angeles receives federal funding through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) Program and the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program, both administered by the DOJ and its component agencies Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The latest DOJ requirements for FY2017 program funding imposed new conditions on recipient cities, including Los Angeles. One condition was compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which provides that a local government entity cannot prohibit or restrict communication between government entities or officials and federal immigration authorities. The other two conditions required recipients to allow the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to access any correctional or detention facility and question suspected undocumented immigrants about their right to be in the U.S., and to provide DHS at least 48 hours advance notice of any noncitizen's scheduled release from custody. </p><p>After several lawsuits challenged these conditions, the federal government was preliminarily enjoined from imposing them on Byrne JAG funding in <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16080\">City of Chicago v. Sessions</a></i>. The DOJ continued to revise these conditions, but Los Angeles believed the revised requirements were ambiguous. Los Angeles alleged that accepting these conditions would force it to abandon its longstanding law enforcement policies, intended to improve cooperation between immigrant residents and municipal police. These policies restrict the city from seeking and disclosing information about residents' immigration status, as well as from honoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests without an independent warrant or judicial determination of probable cause.</p><p>Los Angeles explained its view that its policies in fact complied with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, but that the notice and access conditions were so ambiguous that the DOJ could continue to wrongly deny Los Angeles the funding. Additionally, the city believed that Congress did not intend these immigration-related conditions in either the Byrne JAG statute or the COPS statute. Los Angeles argued that the access and notification requirements would compel it to choose between either submitting to an unconstitutional federal enforcement agenda, or losing critical funds.  The city contended that this violated the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers, the Spending Clause (by usurping Congress' ability to set conditions for funding), the Tenth Amendment (by usurping Los Angeles's power over its own municipal policy), and the Administrative Procedure Act (as arbitrary and capricious agency action). </p><p>On the same day that it filed its complaint, Los Angeles also moved for a preliminary injunction, pointing to what it described as the irreparable injury from the loss of critical public-safety funds. </p><p>The case was assigned to Judge Manuel L. Real on Oct. 2, 2017.</p><p>On Oct. 4, 2017 the parties moved for an expedited briefing schedule, because the DOJ expected to make FY2017 COPS funding decisions on or around Oct. 30. Judge Real granted the motion and planned for a hearing to be held on Oct. 23.</p><p>The DOJ, in its response to the city's complaint, argued against the preliminary injunction, asserting that the city lacked standing (as it would not have been a successful COPS applicant anyway in FY2017, regardless of the immigration-related factors); that COPS' immigration-related factors were consistent with the program's purposes under the APA; and that the DOJ had broad discretion to make the grants.</p><p>Los Angeles withdrew its motion for preliminary injunction on Oct. 16, 2017 because the DOJ had disclosed that Los Angeles' award application for this cycle would have been unsuccessful even without the immigration-related considerations. However, Los Angeles maintained its claims and request for permanent relief, because the DOJ continued to attach the immigration-related conditions to the COPS program.</p><p>On Nov. 21, 2017 Los Angeles then moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that the DOJ's use of COPS funding conditions violated the separation of powers, the Spending Clause, and the APA as arbitrary and capricious. On Feb. 1, five counties, seven cities, and the District of Columbia filed amici briefs supporting Los Angeles.</p><p>The DOJ also moved for partial summary judgment on Jan. 12, 2018 arguing that Los Angeles' claims were non-justiciable or, in the alternative, that the funding conditions were consistent with the governing statutes, the Spending Clause, and the APA. </p><p>Judge Real held a motion hearing on Feb. 28, 2018, and on Apr. 11, 2018 issued an order granting Los Angeles' partial summary judgment motion and denying the DOJ's. First, Judge Real held that the case was not moot because Los Angeles' harm was capable of repetition if the City applied for a FY2018 grant. As to the substantive claims, Judge Real held that the challenged conditions exceeded DOJ's legal authority (as federal power infringing on the state police power), in violation of the Spending Clause (because Congress did not unambiguously condition grant receipt on local compliance with federal authorities for a matter not reasonably related to COPS's goal), and in violation of the APA (as arbitrary and capricious without a reasonable basis).

    "summary_short": "This lawsuit, filed by the City of Los Angeles on Sept. 29, 2017 challenged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)'s imposition of immigration-related conditions on federal funding to the city. Plaintiff filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles receives federal funding through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) Program and the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program, both administered by DOJ and its component agencies Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The latest DOJ requirements for FY2017 program funding imposed new conditions on recipient cities, including Los Angeles. One condition was compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which provides that a local government entity cannot prohibit or restrict communication between government entities or officials and federal immigration authorities. The other two conditions required recipients to allow the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to access any correctional or detention facility and question suspected undocumented immigrants about their right to be in the U.S., and to provide DHS at least 48 hours advance notice of any noncitizen's scheduled release from custody. \r\nAfter several lawsuits challenged these conditions, the federal government was preliminarily enjoined from imposing them on Byrne JAG funding in City of Chicago v. Session. DOJ continued to revise these conditions, but Los Angeles believed the revised requirements were ambiguous. \r\n\r\nBoth parties moved for partial summary judgment, and the court granted Los Angeles' motion. On April 11, 2018, Judge Real held that the challenged conditions exceeded DOJ's legal authority (as federal power infringing on the state police power), in violation of the Spending Clause (because Congress did not unambiguously condition grant receipt on local compliance with federal authorities for a matter not reasonably related to COPS's goal), and in violation of the APA (as arbitrary and capricious without a reasonable basis). Judge Real then permanently enjoined DOJ from imposing the challenged conditions nationwide. The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit. \r\n\r\nOn Sept. 13, 2018, Judge Real granted Los Angeles' application for a preliminary injunction. The court held that the statutes in question gave \"no indication that DOJ is authorized to add civil immigration conditions\" and that Congress did not grant the attorney general authority to impose such conditions. The court also held that Los Angeles faced irreparable harm because it was forced to make \"an impossible choice: either it must certify compliance with unconstitutional and unlawful directives that impinge on the City's sovereignty, damage community trust, and harm public safety, or it will lose congressionally authorized Byrne JAG funding.\" The government appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit, which then docketed the appeal as No. 18-56292. Four days later, the district court denied the government's motion to dismiss. The court held that the City had plausibly stated claims that the new funding conditions were ultra vires, and also violated the separation of powers, the spending clause, and the APA. \r\n\r\nThis case is ongoing.",

To the extent that such \ncosts are not reimbursed under any other federal program, award funds may be obligated (including for \nauthorized reimbursements) for the reasonable, necessary, and allocable costs (if any) of – (1) developing and \nputting into place statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, policies, and practices to satisfy this condition, (2) \npermitting access as described in [the access condition], and (3) honoring any request from DHS that is \nencompassed [in the notice condition]. \n \n7  Although DOJ has stated that it will not enforce the notice and access conditions while this litigation is pending, see \n  Office  of  Justice  Programs,  FY  2017  and  FY  2018  JAG  Award  Special  Notices, \nhttps://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/LegalNotices-AwardReqts.htm (last visited June 26, 2019), such temporary restraint \ndoes not amount to a voluntary cessation of DOJ’s enforcement of the challenged conditions. See Fikre v. FBI, 904 \nF.3d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir. 2018). Therefore, this case is not moot. \n \n8  Section 10102 is contained in subchapter I of chapter 101. This subchapter creates OJP, which oversees the \n  management of all grant programs, both formula and discretionary, including Byrne JAG. (Byrne JAG is contained in \nsubchapter V of the same chapter.) Section 10102(a) provides: \nThe Assistant Attorney General shall – \n(1) publish and disseminate information on the conditions and progress of the criminal justice systems; \n(2) maintain liaison with the executive and judicial branches of the Federal and State governments in matters \nrelating to criminal justice; \n(3) provide information to the President, the Congress, the judiciary, State and local governments, and the \ngeneral public relating to criminal justice; \n(4) maintain liaison with public and private educational and research institutions, State and local governments, \nand governments of other nations relating to criminal justice; \n(5) coordinate and provide staff support to coordinate the activities of the Office and the Bureau of Justice \nAssistance, the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Office for Victims of Crime, and \nthe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention; and \n(6) exercise such other powers and functions as may be vested in the Assistant Attorney General pursuant to this \nchapter  or  by  delegation  of  the  Attorney  General,  including  placing  special  conditions  on  all  grants,  and \ndetermining priority purposes for formula grants. \n34 U.S.C. § 10102(a). \n \n9  Neither of the sections cited by Los Angeles gives the Assistant AG authority to place “special conditions” on or \n  determine “priority purposes” for any grants. Section 10142(2) provides that the BJA may allocate grants “on terms \nand conditions determined by the [BJA] Director to be consistent with part B of subchapter V [Discretionary \nGrants]”, 34 U.S.C. § 10142(2), and § 10446(e)(3) provides that “[i]n disbursing grants under this subchapter [Grants \nto Combat Violent Crimes Against Women], the Attorney General may impose reasonable conditions on grant \n14 \n \n\n \n \nCity of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931 (2019)   \n19 Cal. Daily Op. Serv. 10,483, 2019 Daily Journal D.A.R. 10,164 \n \nawards to ensure that the States meet statutory, regulatory, and other program requirements,” id. § 10446(e)(3). \n \n10  The distinction between “special conditions” and established conditions arises in other contexts, as well. For \n  example, the Federal Aviation Administration is empowered to issue a special condition—“a regulation that applies \nto a particular aircraft design”—when a design’s novel features take it outside the scope of otherwise appropriate \nsafety regulations. 14 C.F.R. § 11.19. \n \n11  Section 10109(a)(2) provides, in full: \n  The purpose of the Office shall be to carry out and coordinate program assessments of, take actions to ensure \ncompliance with the terms of, and manage information with respect to, grants under programs covered by \nsubsection (b). The Director shall take special conditions of the grant into account and consult with the office that \nissued those conditions to ensure appropriate compliance. \n34 U.S.C. § 10109(a)(2). \n \n12  Congress contemplated that the Assistant AG could place such conditions on both formula and discretionary grants \n  (“all grants”), but may determine priority purposes only “for formula grants.” 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6). \n \n13  Therefore, contrary to the concurrence’s characterization of our holding, we do not adopt DOJ’s interpretation of § \n  10102(a)(6). Concurrence at 950–51. \n \n14  Moreover, it is unlikely that Congress would recognize such a broad power in § 10102(a)(6), given the ministerial \n  duties described in the rest of the section. See City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at 288; City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 285. \nBy contrast, our more circumscribed understanding of the power to impose special conditions and determine \npriority purposes is in accord with the other administrative duties outlined in § 10102. \n \n15  The concurrence’s disagreement with our interpretation of § 10102(a)(6) does not make it dicta. Concurrence at \n  945–46, 950–51, 952–53. “[W]here a panel confronts an issue germane to the eventual resolution of the case, and \nresolves it after reasoned consideration in a published opinion, that ruling becomes law of the circuit, regardless of \nwhether doing so is necessary in some strict logical sense.” Cetacean Cmty. v. Bush, 386 F.3d 1169, 1173 (9th Cir. \n2004) (quoting United States v. Johnson, 256 F.3d 895, 914 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (opinion of Kozinski, J.)). Only \n“statements made in passing, without analysis, are not binding precedent.” In re Magnacom Wireless, LLC, 503 F.3d \n984, 993–94 (9th Cir. 2007). In order to resolve the issue on appeal here, we must construe § 10102(a)(6) to \ndetermine whether it gave DOJ any authority at all, and if so, whether it gave DOJ authority to impose the notice \nand access conditions. Our construction of the statutory language, which leads us to conclude that § 10102(a)(6) \ngives DOJ some circumscribed authority, but not the authority to impose the notice and access conditions, is not \ndicta under any definition of the term. \n \n16  Section 10153(a) provides that an application for Byrne JAG funding must include: \n  (4) An assurance that, for each fiscal year covered by an application, the applicant shall maintain and report such \ndata, records, and information (programmatic and financial) as the Attorney General may reasonably require. \n(5) A certification, made in a form acceptable to the Attorney General and executed by the chief executive officer \nof the applicant ... that – \n... \n(C) there has been appropriate coordination with affected agencies. \n34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(4), (5). \n \n17  To the extent DOJ argues that “programmatic” should be read as referring to the definition of “program” set out in \n  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-4a(1)(A), we disagree. The definition of “program” from federal civil rights law that was \nincorporated by reference in the 2017 Byrne JAG award letter is not a reasonable interpretation of the word \n15 \n \n\n \n \nCity of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931 (2019)   \n19 Cal. Daily Op. Serv. 10,483, 2019 Daily Journal D.A.R. 10,164 \n \n“program” or “programmatic” as used in the statutes authorizing Byrne JAG awards. \n \n18  Because we affirm the district court on the ground that DOJ lacked statutory authority to impose the notice and \n  access conditions, we need not address Los Angeles’s alternative arguments raised on appeal. \n \n1  This statute appears in Subchapter I, Chapter 101 of Title 34 of the United States Code. The Byrne JAG statute is in \n  Subchapter V, Chapter 101 of Title 34. See 34 U.S.C. §§ 10151–10158. \n \n2  See Recording of Oral Argument, City of Los Angeles v. Barr, No. 18-56292 (9th Cir. Apr. 10, 2019), at 6:25–7:22, \n  http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_video.php?pk_vid=0000015483. \n \n3  Dictionary  definitions  confirm  this  understanding  of  the  word  “including.”  See  Include,  Webster’s  New  Int’l \n  Dictionary (3d ed. 2002) (“to place, list, or rate as a part of component of a whole or of a larger group, class, or \naggregate”);  Including,  New  Oxford  Am.  Dictionary  (3d  ed.  2010)  (“containing  as  part  of  the  whole  being \nconsidered”). \n \n4  By contrast, in United States v. Flores, 901 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir. 2018), we considered a statute listing a number of \n  aggravated  felonies,  8  U.S.C.  §  1101(a)(43),  conviction  of  which  rendered  aliens  deportable.  8  U.S.C.  § \n1101(a)(43)(G) listed “a theft offense (including receipt of stolen property).” Congress’s express inclusion of an \nindependent crime requiring separate elements of proof led us to conclude that it was at the least ambiguous as to \nwhether Congress intended “including” to mean “a subset” or intended to add an independent theft-related crime \nto the expanded list of deportable felonies. Flores, 901 F.3d at 1157–58. And, as the Board of Immigration Appeals, \nto which we deferred under Chevron, noted, § 1101(a)(43)(G) “is not the only entry within 1101(a)(43)’s list of \naggravated felonies [in which Congress used] the word ‘including’ ‘to cover a broader range of offenses than those \npreviously referenced.’ ” Flores, 901 F.3d at 1158 (quoting Matter of Alday-Dominguez, 27 I. & N. Dec. 48, 51 n.7 \n(B.I.A. 2017)). \n \n5  See Oregon v. Trump, ––– F. Supp. 3d ––––, 2019 WL 3716932, at *11, *13–15 (D. Or. Aug. 7, 2019), appeal docketed \n  No. 19-35843 (9th Cir.

Cal. 2018) (“DOJ’s interpretation that Section \n10102 establishes an independent grant of authority to impose the challenged conditions contradicts the plain \nmeaning of the statute.”), appeal docketed sub nom. City & County of San Francisco v. Whitaker, No. 18-17308 (9th \nCir. Dec. 4, 2018); States of New York v. Dep’t of Justice, 343 F.

City of New York v. Whitaker, No. \n19-275 (2d Cir. Jan. 28, 2019); City of Chicago v. Sessions, 321 F. Supp. 3d 855, 874 (N.D. Ill. 2018); City of Chicago v. \nSessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 941–43 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (subsequent history omitted); City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, \n309 F. Supp. 3d 289, 321 (E.D. Pa. 2018), aff’d in part, vacated in part sub nom.

Pa. 2017) (subsequent \nhistory omitted). \n \n6  Indeed, the DOJ’s interpretation of § 10102(a)(6) gives no weight to Congress’s choice to make Byrne JAG a formula \n  grant program. “If Congress sought to provide [the DOJ] the ability to exercise its judgment in the selection of the \ngrantees, it would have made sense for it to do so by employing the discretionary grant model rather than the \nformula grant structure used here.” City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 286. Were § 10102(a)(6) to authorize the DOJ “to \nwithhold all funds because a jurisdiction does not certify compliance with [a policy] of the Attorney General’s \nchoosing,” it would effectively “turn[ ] the formula grant into a discretionary one.” City of Philadelphia, 916 F.3d at \n290. \n16 \n \n\n \n \nCity of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931 (2019)   \n19 Cal. Daily Op. Serv. 10,483, 2019 Daily Journal D.A.R. 10,164 \n \n \n7  Congress transferred the functions of the Director of Bureau of Justice Assistance to the Assistant Attorney General \n  for the Office of Justice Programs, with exceptions not relevant here. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2000, \nPub. L. No. 106-113, 113 Stat. 1501 (1999) (note regarding 42 U.S.C. § 3741, which was transferred to 34 U.S.C. § \n10141). \n \n8  The majority never identifies any language in § 10102(a)(6), or any other statute, to support its untethered \n  statement that § 10102(a)(6) grants the Attorney General any authority. Majority Op. at 944. While the DOJ argues \nthat § 10102(a)(6) grants the Assistant Attorney General authority, it never suggests that this authority extends to \nthe Attorney General. \n \n9  Because other statutes in Chapter 101 provide the DOJ with authority to impose special conditions, the majority is \n  simply wrong to contend that the City of Los Angeles’s reading of the “including” clause would “authoriz[e] the \nAssistant AG to exercise certain powers that do not exist.” Majority Op. at 939–40. \n \n10  While the majority suggests that Congress’s use of the term “special conditions” was informed by a since-repealed \n  regulation, 28 C.F.R. § 66.12(a)(5) (2006), Majority Op. at 940–42, it conspicuously does not limit the Assistant \nAttorney General to imposing only the types of conditions provided for by that regulation. \n \n11  See Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program FY 2017 Local Solicitation, U.S. Dep’t of Justice (Aug. \n  3, 2017). \n \n12  See FY 2020 Performance Budget, Office of Justice Programs (U.S. Dep’t of Justice), March 2019, at 40, 44, \n  https://www.justice.gov/file/1144566/download (last visited July 29, 2019). \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n17 \n ",

Sessions, III, in his official capacity as \n7  Attorney General of the United States; Russell Washington, in his official capacity as \n8  Acting Director of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services; and the United \n9  Stated Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and their officers, agents, servants, and employees \n10  (collectively “Defendants”).  Plaintiff requests that the Court enjoin Defendants, in \n11  making grant award determinations under the Community Oriented Policing Services \n12  (“COPS”) program, from providing “additional consideration” or any other preferential \n13  treatment to applicants that choose “Illegal Immigration” as a focus area of the grant, or \n14  applicants that certify compliance with the Notice and Access Requirements announced \n15  by the Department of Justice on September 7, 2017.  \n16    The COPS program helps local communities put more officers on the street in \n17  order to advance community policing efforts.  Congress enumerated twenty-two statutory \n18  purposes for which COPS funds may be used, and three grounds on which COPS \n19  applicants may be given preferential treatment.  Neither the statute’s purposes nor its \n20  grounds for preferential consideration have anything to do with civil immigration \n21  enforcement.  Defendants have nonetheless announced two immigration-related grounds \n22  on which applicants will be provided “additional consideration”—essentially bonus \n23  points that will be used to advantage some applicants at the expense of others.   \n24    First, applicants will receive additional consideration if they agree to use grant \n25  funds to “focus” on “Illegal Immigration.”  Second, applicants will receive additional \n26  consideration if they agree to specified forms of partnership in federal civil immigration \n27  enforcement.  Cities like Los Angeles that are unwilling or unable to participate in federal \n28 \n1 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ NOTICE OF APPLICATION AND APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7   Filed 09/29/17   Page 4 of 5   Page ID #:265\n \n1  civil immigration enforcement will be required to compete for community policing funds \n2  on an uneven playing field.  \n3    Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of its challenge to the imposition of \n4  immigration-related additional considerations in awarding COPS grants.  Defendants \n5  actions are ultra vires and in violation of the Separation of Powers under the \n6  Constitution; in violation of the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment; and \n7  arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  \n8  Absent an injunction, Plaintiff will be irreparably harmed because it will suffer a \n9  disadvantage in the competition for grant funds as a result of its unwillingness to engage \n10  in the demanded forms of partnership in federal civil immigration enforcement.  The \n11  balance of equities tips decisively in Plaintiff’s favor, and the public interest favors an \n12  injunction. \n13    Defendants previously announced that COPS award determinations would be made \n14  soon after September 30, 2017.  Counsel for Defendants has represented that COPS \n15  Hiring Program award determinations will not be made before October 30, 2017.  \n16  Accordingly, in order to prevent irreparable harm, Plaintiff respectfully requests that a \n17  preliminary injunction be entered in advance of October 30, 2017.  Plaintiff therefore \n18  intends to file a separate motion seeking an expedited hearing and briefing schedule.      \n19    This motion is based on this Notice of Application and Application, the \n20  accompanying supporting Memorandum of Points and Authorities, the supporting \n21  declarations of Steven Hong (Deputy City Attorney of the Los Angeles’ City Attorney’s \n22  Office), Stella Larracas (Officer in Charge of the Los Angeles Police Department’s \n23  Grants Section), and Michael Hyams (Commanding Officer of the Los Angeles Police \n24  Department’s Risk Management and Legal Affairs Group), all other papers and pleadings \n25  on file in this action, and on such other written or oral evidence as may be presented at or \n26  before the hearing on this Application.  \n27   \n28   \n2 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ NOTICE OF APPLICATION AND APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7   Filed 09/29/17   Page 5 of 5   Page ID #:266\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 1 of 32   Page ID #:267\n \n1 \nMICHAEL N.

INTRODUCTION   \n2  Congress enacted the Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS”) grant \n3  program to help local communities put more officers on the street in order to advance \n4  community policing efforts.  The Attorney General is attempting to change the terms of \n5  that program as Congress created it, using it as a vehicle to require state and local \n6  governments to participate in the enforcement of federal civil immigration policies.  \n7  Specifically, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has decided that in the COPS award \n8  decisions that are soon to issue, it will disfavor state and local governments that are \n9  unwilling or unable to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement. \n10  This is just the latest in a series of unlawful efforts by the Executive Branch to use \n11  federal funds as a “weapon” to induce support for its current civil immigration \n12  enforcement agenda.  Many communities, including Los Angeles, have made the policy \n13  decision that enmeshing themselves in federal immigration enforcement harms public \n14  safety and erodes the community’s trust in local law enforcement.  Well-settled principles \n15  of federalism make clear that state and local governments are entitled to make that \n16  sovereign choice.  Since the beginning of this year, however, the Executive has imposed \n17  a steady stream of measures attempting to require states and local governments to \n18  participate in federal civil immigration enforcement.  While framed in terms of \n19  “enforcing the law,” it is the Administration’s approach that has proved unlawful.  In \n20  April, a district court in San Francisco enjoined an Executive Order by President Trump \n21  attempting to broadly tie federal funding to civil immigration enforcement.  Just two \n22  weeks ago, a district court in Chicago enjoined Attorney General Sessions’ attempt to \n23  require specific types of participation in federal civil immigration efforts as a condition \n24  for receipt of federal funding under the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (“JAG”) program. \n25  DOJ’s rewriting of the COPS program is more of the same.  Apparently \n26  recognizing its lack of authority to impose immigration-related conditions on these \n27  grants, DOJ is attempting a new way to dragoon state and local entities into participating \n28  in federal civil immigration enforcement.  DOJ is now providing “Additional \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 8 of 32   Page ID #:274\n \n1  Consideration”—essentially bonus points—to applicants willing to treat civil \n2  immigration enforcement as a “focus area” of their grant-supported program, even though \n3  Congress did not authorize COPS funding to be used for immigration enforcement.  And \n4  just in the last few weeks, after applications for COPS grants were already received, DOJ \n5  sprung on applicants a further “Additional Consideration” for communities willing to \n6  meet specific federal demands for participation in federal civil immigration \n7  enforcement—requirements that are materially identical to the two conditions that \n8  another federal court just enjoined.  The result is that in the competition for federal funds \n9  to support community policing, DOJ is stacking the deck in favor of jurisdictions that are \n10  willing to volunteer to support federal civil immigration enforcement, and disfavoring \n11  communities that are not. \n12  This latest effort to tie federal funding to the Executive Branch’s unrelated civil \n13  immigration enforcement agenda is unlawful, just like its predecessors.  The Attorney \n14  General is violating the separation of powers by disregarding the limits on his statutory \n15  authority; is acting in violation of the Spending Clause and Tenth Amendment by failing \n16  to adhere to the constitutional requirements on conditioning federal funds; and has \n17  adopted an award process that is arbitrary and capricious.  DOJ has stated that it will \n18  issue COPS awards as early as October 30, 2017.  If DOJ is not prevented from using \n19  unlawful considerations in deciding who does and does not receive COPS funding, the \n20  skewed awards would prove difficult or impossible to unwind and reallocate through a \n21  lawful process.  Accordingly, the City of Los Angeles respectfully requests that the court \n22  enter a preliminary injunction to prevent immediate and irreversible harm, and prohibit \n23  DOJ from using the unlawful considerations in its COPS award determinations. \n24 \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n25 \nA.  Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS”) Grant Program For \n26  Hiring Police Officers In Support Of Community Policing \n27  In a provision in the legislation creating the COPS program entitled “Authority to \n28  make public safety and community policing grants,” Congress authorized the Attorney \n2 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 9 of 32   Page ID #:275\n \n1  General to “make[] grants to States, units of local government, Indian tribal governments, \n2  other public and private entities, and multi-jurisdictional or regional consortia for the \n3  purposes described in subsection (b) of this section.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(a).  In \n4  subsection (b), Congress limited “[t]he purposes for which grants . . . may be made,” id. \n5  § 10381(b), to twenty-two specific purposes regarding the hiring and rehiring of law \n6  enforcement officers for community policing, implementing related training, procuring \n7  related equipment and technology, and developing new related technology and programs.  \n8  Id. § 10381(b)(1)-(22).  \n9  COPS grant funding is administered by the Office of Community Oriented \n10  Policing Services (“COPS Office”) within the U.S. Department of Justice.  See 2017 CHP \n11  Application Guide, attached as Ex. B to Decl. of Stella Larracas at 61.  The COPS Office \n12  administers several types of COPS programs each year, including the COPS Hiring \n13  Program (“CHP”) grant.  This COPS grant “provides funding directly to law enforcement \n14  agencies to hire and/or rehire career law enforcement officers in an effort to increase their \n15  community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts.”  Id. at 1, 7.  Pursuant to \n16  statute, COPS grants may fund up to 75 percent of the salary and benefits of the hired or \n17  rehired officers.  See id.; see also 34 U.S.C. § 10381(g).  Each fiscal year, the COPS \n18  Office selects local government awardees to receive CHP funds that, in general, may be \n19  used over a period of three years.  See Larracas Decl. Ex. B at 1. \n20  In evaluating COPS grant applications, Congress authorized the Attorney General \n21  to give “preferential consideration, where feasible, to an application” that meets one or \n22  more of three criteria: (1) an application “for hiring and rehiring additional career law \n23  enforcement officers that involves a non-Federal contribution exceeding the 25 percent  \n24  minimum” non-federal contribution; (2) the applicant is in a state that has in effect anti-\n25  human trafficking laws that treat minors engaged in commercial sex as victims; or (3) the \n26  applicant is in a state that has in effect laws related to allowing the vacatur of arrests or \n27  convictions for non-violent crimes committed by human trafficking victims directly \n28  related to their human trafficking.  34 U.S.C. § 10381(c).  \n3 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 10 of 32   Page ID #:276\n \n1  The COPS Office determines which applicants receive CHP grants through a \n2  points system.  In calculating an applicant’s score for a CHP grant in FY 2016, for \n3  example, “fiscal need . . . constitute[d] 20 percent, crime 30 percent, and community \n4  policing 50 percent of the overall score.”  2016 CHP Application Guide, attached as Ex. \n5  C to Larracas Decl. at 21.  The COPS Office also provided “additional consideration” to \n6  applicants on various grounds.  Id.  The COPS Office does not explain how localities \n7  receive points in the various categories, or the relative weight given to additional \n8  considerations in the overall scoring system.  See id.   \n9  B.  Defendants’ Attempt To Disfavor COPS Grant Applicants That Do Not \nParticipate In Federal Civil Immigration Enforcement  \n10 \nPresident Donald J. Trump has declared that he would use federal funds as a \n11 \n“weapon” to require state and local support for his civil immigration enforcement \n12 \npolicies.1  On January 25, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13768 directing \n13 \nthe Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to withhold federal funds from \n14 \nwhat he called “Sanctuary Jurisdictions.”2  On April 25, 2017, a federal district court \n15 \nenjoined Section 9(a) of the Executive Order, ruling that the plaintiff jurisdictions in that \n16 \ncase are likely to succeed on their claims that the order is unconstitutional because the \n17 \nExecutive Branch is usurping authority that belongs to Congress under the Spending \n18 \nClause; the order violates constitutional limits on federal spending authority; the order \n19 \nviolates the Tenth Amendment’s prohibition against the federal government \n20 \ncommandeering local jurisdictions to administer a federal regulatory program; the order \n21 \nis unconstitutionally vague; and the order violates requirements of due process.

Donald J. Trump; City and Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 2017 WL \n2  1459081 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 2017), appeal filed No. 17-16886 (9th Cir. Sept. 18, 2017). \n3  On July 25, 2017, Defendant Sessions launched another effort to tie federal funds  \n4  for states and localities to their participation in federal civil immigration enforcement.  \n5  He announced in a press release three new conditions that the Department of Justice \n6  would attempt to impose on funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \n7  Grants (“Byrne JAG”) program.  Specifically, he announced that, “[f]rom now on, the \n8  Department will only provide Byrne JAG grants to cities and states that [1] comply with \n9  federal law, [2] allow federal immigration access to detention facilities, and [3] provide \n10  48 hours notice before they release an illegal alien wanted by federal authorities.” 3  In \n11  announcing these conditions, DOJ asserted as a justification—without citing empirical or \n12  any other support—that the conditions are “part of accomplishing the Department of \n13  Justice’s top priority of reducing violent crime.”  Id.  Defendants did not identify any \n14  evidence that supports their implied premise that undocumented immigrants commit \n15  violent crimes at higher rates than the general population, or that cities with so-called \n16  “sanctuary” policies have more violent crime on average than those that do not.  Nor \n17  could they, as prevailing research demonstrates there is either no relationship between a \n18  city’s so-called “sanctuary” policies and that city’s crime rate, or an inverse relationship,4 \n19  despite Defendant Sessions’ claims to the contrary in a speech delivered earlier this \n20  summer to law enforcement officials.5   \n21                                                   \n3 Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs, “Attorney General Sessions Announces \n22 \nImmigration Compliance Requirements for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \n23  Grant Programs,” Justice.gov (July 25, 2017), attached as Ex.

See City of Chicago v. \n4  Sessions, 2017 WL 4081821 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 15, 2017), appeal filed.6 \n5  DOJ now seeks to transform the COPS grant into a tool for obtaining participation \n6  by localities in federal civil immigration enforcement.  In the FY 2017 application guide \n7  for CHP grants, the COPS Office expanded the types of local law enforcement programs \n8  that would receive additional consideration beyond those authorized by the COPS grant \n9  statute.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b), (c).  For FY 2017, additional consideration is provided \n10  for grant-supported programs whose “focus area” is “Illegal Immigration” (the \n11  “Immigration Enforcement Focus Consideration”).7 \n12 \n                                                 \n13 \n6 In addition to challenging DOJ’s creation of new considerations in the COPS grant \n14  award process, Los Angeles in this lawsuit challenges the new immigration-related \nconditions on receipt of funding under the Byrne JAG program.  The City does not seek a \n15 \npreliminary injunction with respect to the Byrne JAG conditions because the Chicago \n16  injunction prevents DOJ from enforcing those conditions nationwide.  \n17  7 Additional consideration is also provided for grant-supported programs focusing on  \n“Violent Crime” or “Homeland Security.”  See Larracas Decl. Ex. B at 27.  Unlike \n18 \n“Illegal Immigration,” these focus areas correspond with authorized statutory purposes \n19  for COPS funding.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(5), (8), (9), (11), (12), (15) (crime control); \nid. § 10381(b)(4) (homeland security).   \n20 \n  The COPS Office also included the authorized preferential considerations for \n21 \n“applicants in states with certain anti-human trafficking laws that treat minors engaged in \ncommercial sex as victims (referred to as ‘safe harbor’ laws) and permit individuals to \n22 \nvacate arrest or prosecution records for non-violent offenses as a result of being \n23 \ntrafficked.”  Larracas Decl. Ex. B at 27; see 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2)-(3).  It indicated that \napplicants will receive additional consideration for hiring a military veteran.  Larracas \n24 \nDecl. Ex.

See Larracas \n4  Decl. Ex. B at 27-28.  Nearly two months after CHP grant applications were due—and \n5  after briefing was complete on the preliminary injunction motion in the Chicago \n6  challenge to the Byrne JAG conditions—Los Angeles and other localities received an \n7  email from the COPS Office informing them that DOJ had adopted an Immigration \n8  Enforcement Partnership Consideration.  See Email from COPS Office (Sept. 7, 2017), \n9  attached as Ex. A to Larracas Decl.  To qualify, a COPS applicant would have to certify \n10  that it has implemented, or would implement, versions of the same civil immigration-\n11  related requirements DOJ had recently attempted to impose on the Byrne JAG Program.  \n12  Id.     \n13  Specifically, the COPS Office offered this additional consideration to an applicant \n14  that certifies compliance with both an “Access Requirement” and a “Notice \n15  Requirement.”  See Certification of Illegal Immigration Cooperation, attached as \n16  Attachment 1 to Ex. A to Larracas Decl.  Under the Access Requirement, the applicant \n17  must have in place or implement “rules, regulations, policies, and/or practices that ensure \n18  that U.S. Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’) personnel have access to any of the \n19  governing body’s correctional or detention facilities in order to meet with an alien (or an \n20  individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be or to remain in \n21  the United States.”  Id.  Under the Notice Requirement, the applicant must have in place \n22  or implement “rules, regulations, policies, and/or practices that ensure that any of the \n23  governing body’s correctional and detention facilities provide advance notice as early as \n24  practicable (at least 48 hours, where possible) to DHS regarding the scheduled release \n25  date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS requests such notice in \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n§ 5141 (permitting modification of administrative conditions of federal assistance \n28  programs in light of a “major disaster”). \n7 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 14 of 32   Page ID #:280\n \n1  order to take custody of the alien. This certification does not require holding an alien \n2  beyond his or her scheduled time of release.”  Id.  Los Angeles was given until \n3  September 19, 2017 to respond and make the necessary certification—less than two \n4  weeks.  Id. \n5  On the same day that the e-mail was sent, DOJ explained in a statement that \n6  jurisdictions would receive “additional points in the application scoring process [for \n7  COPS grants] if their agencies cooperate with federal law enforcement to address illegal \n8  immigration.”  DOJ, Office of Public Affairs, Department of Justice Announces Priority \n9  Consideration Criteria for COPS Office Grants (Sept. 7, 2017), attached as Ex. E to Hong \n10  Decl.  The statement included the following from Defendant Sessions:  “[c]ities and \n11  states that cooperate with federal law enforcement make all of us safer by helping remove \n12  dangerous criminals from our communities,” and “jurisdictions with these policies in \n13  place should be acknowledged for their commitment to ending violent crime, including \n14  violent crime stemming from illegal immigration.”  Id.  DOJ would thus “recognize \n15  jurisdictions that commit to the rule of law by awarding additional points in the \n16  application scoring process for COPS Office grants.”  Id.; see also COPS Office: \n17  Immigration Cooperation Certification Process Background, attached as Attachment 1 to \n18  Ex. E to Hong Decl. \n19 \nC.  Consistent With The Statutory Purpose Of The COPS Program, Los \n20  Angeles Uses Its Funding To Enhance Community Policing \nLos Angeles applied for CHP grants in 2012 and 2016, and received the grants in \n21 \nboth years.  Larracas Decl. ¶¶ 3, 10.  In FY 2016, Los Angeles’ score for the CHP grant \n22 \nwas 150.67—the 14th highest score among the 1,110 applications.  See COPS Office, \n23 \nFY2016 COPS Hiring Program Applicant Rankings, attached as Ex. F to Larracas Decl. \n24 \nLos Angeles received $3.125 million in CHP funding in FY 2016, which went \n25 \ntoward the hiring of 25 officers to improve community policing.  Los Angeles explained \n26 \nin its 2016 application that the funds would help expand the “Summer Night Lights” and \n27 \n“Fall Friday Nights” programs, in which parks around Los Angeles extend their operating \n28 \n8 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 15 of 32   Page ID #:281\n \n1  hours and host free events for the community, and including as a vital component the \n2  presence of LAPD officers to ensure the safety of residents and make the program \n3  successful.  See Los Angeles 2016 Application, attached as Ex. D to Larracas Decl.  In \n4  addition, Los Angeles used funds to expand training programs in community policing.  \n5  Id. \n6  The City’s use of CHP funds promotes Congress’ core objectives in enacting the \n7  COPS program.  Those funds are needed to help ensure the hiring and rehiring of officers  \n8  who can dedicate their time to community policing, as well as ensuring those officers are \n9  equipped with the proper training programs.   \n10  In its FY 2017 application, Los Angeles applied for $3.125 million in CHP funds \n11  to support hiring officers for its Community Safety Partnership (“CSP”) Program.  The \n12  CSP Program operates in selected public housing developments located throughout the \n13  Los Angeles Area.  Officers implement programs for at-risk youth, ensure safe passage \n14  on school routes, and build relationships in the communities through neighborhood watch \n15  groups, quality of life committees, and citizen-police enforcement teams.  Thus, in its \n16  application, Los Angeles identified “Building Trust and Respect” as the focus of its \n17  grant-supported program.  Los Angeles 2017 CHP Application, attached as Ex. G to \n18  Larracas Decl.; see 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2), (5), (11).  DOJ is not providing \n19  additional consideration for programs within this focus area. \n20 \nD.  Los Angeles’ Policies Against Engaging In Federal Civil Immigration \n21  Enforcement \nFor nearly forty years, Los Angeles has implemented “policies and practices \n22 \ndesigned to promote the public safety of all Los Angeles residents by engendering \n23 \ncooperation and trust between members of the City’s many immigrant communities and \n24 \nlaw enforcement.”  Decl. of Michael Hyams ¶ 4.  As the COPS Office has long \n25 \nrecognized, “uncertainty and concern about local law enforcement’s role in immigration \n26 \nenforcement causes many immigrants to fear that any contact with officers could \n27 \npotentially bring about their deportation and/or that of undocumented family members.”  \n28 \n9 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 16 of 32   Page ID #:282\n \n1  See Enhancing Community Policing With Immigrant Populations: Recommendations \n2  from a Roundtable Meeting of Immigrant Advocates and Law Enforcement Leaders, \n3  COPS Office (2010 summary of Aug. 2008 roundtable), attached as Ex. G to Hong Decl. \n4  at 16.  To avoid sowing distrust, the Los Angeles Police Department has maintained a \n5  policy that “restricts an officer from initiating a police action with the objective of \n6  discovering a person’s immigration status, and also prohibits arrests based solely on civil \n7  immigration status.”  Hyams Decl. ¶ 3 (citing Special Order 40).   \n8  Accordingly, Los Angeles did not identify “Illegal Immigration” as a focus area of \n9  its grant.  See Larracas Decl. Ex. G.  The City therefore will not receive preferential \n10  treatment under the Immigration Enforcement Focus Consideration.  The City’s \n11  application will therefore be less competitive with other jurisdictions that are willing to \n12  divert COPS funding to participation in federal civil immigration enforcement. \n13  Los Angeles also did not certify compliance with the Access and Notice \n14  Requirements, and so will not receive preferential treatment under the Immigration \n15  Enforcement Partnership Consideration.  Larracas Decl. ¶ 6.  In the 12 days the City was \n16  allotted to decide whether to certify compliance, Los Angeles was unable to determine \n17  whether DOJ would consider its detention facility practices to comply with these \n18  Requirements, or whether making a certification to “partnership” in immigration \n19  enforcement would erode the community trust Los Angeles has long fostered.  Hyams \n20  Decl. ¶ 14.  The City’s application will therefore be less competitive with other \n21  jurisdictions willing to certify their “partnership” in civil immigration enforcement. \n22  Thus, as a result of DOJ’s creation of the Immigration Enforcement Focus \n23  Consideration and the Immigration Enforcement Partnership Consideration (together, the \n24  “Challenged Considerations”), the deck is now stacked against the City of Los Angeles in \n25  its competition for federal community policing funds.  In awarding extra “points” to \n26  localities that are willing to “focus” on “Illegal Immigration,” and more “points” to those \n27  that are able and willing to certify to DOJ’s specified forms of “partnership” with federal \n28  civil immigration enforcement efforts, DOJ is necessarily disfavoring jurisdictions, like \n10 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 17 of 32   Page ID #:283\n \n1  Los Angeles, that are unwilling to divert community policing funds to federal civil \n2  immigration enforcement, or compromise public safety and community trust in law \n3  enforcement.  The City has therefore brought this lawsuit, and seeks a preliminary \n4  injunction, to level the playing field and allow it to compete for federal funds without \n5  being disadvantaged by unlawful “considerations.” \n6  III.  ARGUMENT \n7  To obtain a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff must establish that it “is likely to \n8  succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n9  preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is \n10  in the public interest.”  Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 \n11  (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n12  (2008)).  Because Los Angeles meets all four of these elements, the Court should \n13  preliminarily enjoin Defendants from making COPS award determinations using the \n14  Challenged Considerations. \n15 \nA.  Los Angeles Is Likely To Succeed On the Merits. \n16 \n1.  The Challenged Considerations Are Ultra Vires and Violate the \n17  Separation of Powers. \n18    An agency “has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon \n19  it.”  Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  When agencies \n20  “act improperly . . . what they do is ultra vires.” City of Arlington v. FCC, 133 S. Ct. \n21  1863, 1869 (2013).  DOJ lacks authority to change the terms of the COPS grant program \n22  as enacted by Congress by imposing additional considerations that disfavor jurisdictions \n23  that are unwilling or unable to use funding intended for community policing on civil \n24  immigration enforcement, or to certify compliance with specified forms of “partnership” \n25  with federal civil immigration authorities.  DOJ’s ultra vires imposition of these \n26  additional considerations is “an improper attempt to wield Congress’s exclusive spending \n27  power and is a violation of the Constitution’s separation of powers principles.”  Santa \n28  Clara, 2017 WL 1459081 at *22. \n11 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 18 of 32   Page ID #:284\n \n1    Congress created the COPS program to bolster local community policing efforts by \n2  putting more officers on the street—not as a tool for the Executive Branch to advance \n3  unrelated policy agendas.  Thus, Congress enumerated twenty-two express purposes “for \n4  which grants . . . may be made.”  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1)-(22).  And Congress \n5  further identified three grounds on which “the Attorney General may give preferential \n6  consideration.”  Id. § 10381(c).  The Challenged Considerations cannot be reconciled \n7  with these and additional critical features of the statutory scheme. \n8    First, Congress authorized DOJ to give “preferential consideration” to COPS grant \n9  applicants in three—and only three—circumstances.  34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(1)-(3).  The \n10  agency is not permitted to invent its own separate grounds to give an applicant favorable \n11  treatment; otherwise the statutory provision allowing three limited grounds for such \n12  preference would be wholly superfluous.  See Chubb Custom Ins. Co. v. Space \n13  Systems/Loral, Inc., 710 F.3d 946, 966 (9th Cir. 2013) (“It is a well-established rule of \n14  statutory construction that courts should not interpret statutes in a way that renders a \n15  provision superfluous.”); cf. Chicago, 2017 WL 4081821 at *5 (DOJ’s view that it can \n16  impose conditions on Byrne JAG grants “would render superfluous the explicit statutory \n17  grant of authority to impose conditions” on certain other grants).  When Congress says \n18  “the Attorney General may give preferential consideration” on three specified grounds, it \n19  necessarily follows that he may not give preferential consideration on other grounds.8 \n20  Second, the Challenged Considerations are not only excluded from the three \n21  authorized grounds for preference—they are not even within the twenty-two enumerated \n22  purposes of the COPS program.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1)-(22).  Congress did not \n23  include using state and local resources to combat “Illegal Immigration” as an authorized \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n8 DOJ obviously cannot circumvent this limitation by using the phrase “additional \n26  consideration” instead of the statutory phrase “preferential consideration.”  Indeed, DOJ \nitself treats these phrases as interchangeable.  See Larracas Decl. Ex. B at 27 (treating the \n27 \nstatutory ground for preferential consideration based on anti-trafficking laws as a basis \n28  for “[a]dditional consideration”). \n12 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 19 of 32   Page ID #:285\n \n1  purpose of COPS funding at all, let alone as a “focus area” warranting preferential \n2  treatment.  Neither does a single one of the twenty-two authorized purposes have \n3  anything to do with state and local governments’ willingness to assist in federal civil \n4  immigration investigations and enforcement.  Participation in civil immigration \n5  enforcement is thus not just an invalid ground for additional consideration, but a \n6  diversion of funds Congress allocated for community policing. \n7  Third, Congress authorized the Attorney General to “prescribe by regulation or \n8  guidelines” only the “form” of a COPS application and the “information” it must contain.  \n9  34 U.S.C. § 10382(b); see also id. § 10381(f) (referring to “application[s]” “which meet[] \n10  the requirements prescribed by the Attorney General”).  In the context of the Byrne JAG \n11  program, a district court recently recognized that the Attorney General’s “limited express \n12  authority” to “determine the ‘form’ of the application” “indicates an express reservation” \n13  by Congress of any broader authority.  Chicago, 2017 WL 4081821, at *4.  So too here: \n14  Congress’ decision to authorize the Attorney General to “prescribe” the form and content \n15  of a COPS application renders conspicuous the absence of any congressional delegation \n16  of authority for an agency to invent new grounds for preferential treatment. \n17  Fourth, DOJ has recently asked Congress—as part of the COPS Office’s \n18  appropriations request—to “authorize DHS and DOJ to condition certain grants and \n19  cooperative agreements on requirements that recipients agree to cooperate with specific \n20  Federal immigration enforcement activities and requests.”  U.S. DOJ, FY 2018 \n21  Congressional Justification, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (Apr. 23, \n22  2017), attached as Ex. F to Hong Decl. at 23-26.  DOJ thus tacitly concedes that it \n23  presently lacks authorization to use grant programs to compel or induce participation in \n24  federal civil immigration enforcement. \n25  Fifth, the Immigration Enforcement Focus Consideration would undermine \n26  Congress’ carefully balanced framework for federal-state immigration cooperation.  \n27  Congress has been careful not to give blanket authorization for state and local officers to \n28  engage in civil immigration enforcement.  “Federal law specifies limited circumstances in \n13 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 20 of 32   Page ID #:286\n \n1  which state officers may perform the functions of an immigration officer.”  Arizona v. \n2  United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2506 (2012) (emphasis added).  Such cooperation requires \n3  a “287(g)” agreement, under which state and local officers act “subject to the direction \n4  and supervision of the Attorney General.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(3).  DOJ’s attempt to \n5  disadvantage those jurisdictions that do not focus on the generic category “illegal \n6  immigration” ignores Congress’ reason for imposing this limitation in Section 287(g): \n7  “[t]here are significant complexities involved in enforcing federal immigration law.”  \n8  Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2506.  By stacking the deck for awarding CHP funds in favor of \n9  those jurisdictions willing to “focus” their policing efforts on “illegal immigration” \n10  generally, without the protections and limitations Congress established, DOJ is disrupting \n11  a carefully balanced statutory framework. \n12  Critically, moreover, when state and local officers are authorized to act as \n13  immigration officers pursuant to a 287(g) agreement, Congress required this participation \n14  to be “at the expense of the State or political subdivision.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1) \n15  (emphasis added).  DOJ has admitted that it intends to use the COPS program to fund \n16  “287(g) partnerships.”  Hong Decl. Ex. F at 31.  In other words, DOJ—without any \n17  authorization in the COPS statute—would override Section 287(g) and fund state and \n18  local participation in federal immigration enforcement despite Congress’ express \n19  provision to the contrary.  \n20  Sixth, the Immigration Enforcement Partnership Consideration impermissibly \n21  seeks to direct and control state and local law enforcement agencies in their operation of \n22  detention facilities.  Congress  provided that DOJ’s grant-making authority may not be \n23  “construed to authorize any [federal agency or officer] to exercise any direction, \n24  supervision, or control over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any \n25  State or any political subdivision thereof.”  34 U.S.C. § 10228(a).  The Immigration \n26  Enforcement Partnership Consideration does just that, using the threat of disfavored \n27  treatment to induce police forces to alter their operations so as to arrange for access to \n28  detention facilities and notification of release. \n14 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 21 of 32   Page ID #:287\n \n1  Seventh, if Congress had truly meant to authorize DOJ to disfavor state and local \n2  governments that do not agree to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement, it \n3  would have had to make such intention particularly clear.  When federalism values are at \n4  stake, the Supreme Court demands a “clear statement” from Congress, which “assures \n5  that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters \n6  involved.”  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 461 (1991) (emphasis added).  Applying \n7  this clear-statement rule in the context of federal grants, courts have required \n8  “unambiguous statutory expression of congressional intent to condition the States’ receipt \n9  of federal funds in a particular manner.”  Com. Va., Dep’t of Educ. v. Riley, 106 F.3d 559, \n10  566 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (adopting the dissenting panel opinion of Luttig, J.), \n11  superseded by statute.  Congress would have spoken clearly if it had meant to authorize \n12  DOJ to disadvantage jurisdictions in competition for federal funds because they use \n13  community policing resources for their intended purpose, rather than participation in \n14  enforcement of the federal civil immigration laws.   \n15  Far from doing so, numerous features of the text and structure of the statute make \n16  clear that Congress did not permit the Attorney General to arrogate this power to himself.   \n17  Cities like Los Angeles may not be put to the choice of agreeing to participate in federal \n18  civil immigration enforcement, or jeopardizing their ability to compete for funds \n19  Congress made available to support community policing. \n20 \n2.  The Challenged Considerations Violate the Spending Clause. \n21 \nEven if Congress had delegated its Spending Clause authority to adopt the \n22 \nChallenged Considerations, Congress would still have had to comply with several \n23 \nimportant restrictions in exercising that constitutional authority.  It is well-settled that \n24 \nconditions on federal grants must meet certain requirements.  See S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 \n25 \nU.S. 203, 207-09 (1987).  Although DOJ has created what it calls “Additional \n26 \nConsiderations” that benefit some applicants, doing so necessarily disadvantages other \n27 \napplicants that are unable or unwilling to comply.  In at least some cases inability to \n28 \n15 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 22 of 32   Page ID #:288\n \n1  receive this additional consideration will result in an unsuccessful application; otherwise \n2  the considerations would serve no purpose.  A condition by any other name is still a \n3  condition, and Congress may not make it more difficult for a state or local government to \n4  access federal funds for reasons that do not pass constitutional muster. \n5  Here there are at least two such flaws in the Challenged Considerations: they are \n6  not sufficiently related to the purposes of the COPS statute, and they are not \n7  unambiguous.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981); Dole, \n8  483 U.S. at 207-09.   \n9 \na)  The Challenged Considerations Are Not Related To \n10  Congress’ Purpose In Creating The COPS Grant Program. \nThe Challenged Considerations violate a fundamental restriction on the exercise of \n11 \nthe Spending Clause authority: “the conditions on receipt of federal funds must be \n12 \nreasonably related to the articulated goal.”  Nevada v. Skinner, 884 F.2d 445, 447 (9th \n13 \nCir. 1989).  Congress established the COPS grant program to fund States, “units of local \n14 \ngovernment,” and other groups, for use by them in twenty-two specific purposes, ranging \n15 \nfrom providing “specialized training to law enforcement officers to . . . recognize \n16 \nindividuals who have a mental illness” to establishing “school-based partnerships \n17 \nbetween local law enforcement agencies and local school systems.”  34 U.S.C. \n18 \n§ 10381(b)(1)-(22).  As the COPS Office recently explained, its basic purpose is to \n19 \nsupport local law enforcement agencies in “advancing public safety through the \n20 \nimplementation of community policing strategies,” which “entails developing \n21 \npartnerships between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.”  Hong \n22 \nDecl. Ex. F at 4. \n23 \nNeither the COPS authorizing statute nor the COPS Office’s own view of its  \n24 \nmission mentions state and local participation in federal civil immigration investigations \n25 \nand enforcement.  The CHP grant in particular is concerned with hiring police officers.  \n26 \nSee, e.g., Larracas Decl. Ex. B. at 7.  The Notice and Access Requirements DOJ seeks to \n27 \nimpose to qualify for the Immigration Enforcement Partnership Consideration have \n28 \n16 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 23 of 32   Page ID #:289\n \n1  nothing at all to do with hiring local law enforcement officers.  Requiring States and local \n2  governments to open their facilities to federal civil immigration authorities, or to respond \n3  to any notification request those authorities make, is not related to the purpose of the \n4  grant. \n5  The Immigration Enforcement Focus Consideration is likewise unmoored from the \n6  statutory purposes of the grant.  Congress identified a long list of twenty-two authorized \n7  purposes of COPS funds, making the omission of immigration enforcement especially \n8  conspicuous.  That omission may well reflect the view, recognized by the COPS Office \n9  itself, that far from being a component of community policing, state and local \n10  immigration enforcement often sows distrust between communities and police.  See Hong \n11  Decl. Ex. G. at 16.  But whatever Congress’ reason, the point remains that it created a \n12  program having nothing to do with civil immigration enforcement.  DOJ cannot \n13  constitutionally penalize applicants for community policing grants because they intend to \n14  fulfill their responsibilities to their local communities to further public safety and well-\n15  being and are unwilling to participate in civil immigration enforcement, a non-germane \n16  agenda and one that is the responsibility of the federal government. \n17 \nb)  The Challenged Considerations Do Not Provide The Clear \n18  Notice A Federal Funding Applicant Must Be Given. \nCities “cannot knowingly accept conditions of which they are ‘unaware’ or which \n19 \nthey are ‘unable to ascertain.’”  Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 \n20 \nU.S. 291, 296 (2006).  Congress must therefore state “unambiguously” the conditions \n21 \nattached to federal funds so as to “furnish clear notice” to recipients of what is required of \n22 \nthem.  Id.; see also Dole, 483 U.S. at 207.  If a local official would not “clearly \n23 \nunderstand” the obligations imposed by the condition, it is unconstitutional.  Arlington, \n24 \n548 U.S. at 296. \n25 \nIn this case, Congress did not adopt either of the Challenged Considerations, let \n26 \nalone an unambiguous version of those considerations.  But, even if the clear notice \n27 \n28 \n17 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 24 of 32   Page ID #:290\n \n1  requirement could be satisfied by an agency creating the condition, DOJ has not crafted \n2  considerations that Los Angeles could “clearly understand.”   \n3  1.  The Immigration Enforcement Focus Consideration is fatally ambiguous.  The \n4  only description of it comes in the COPS Office’s appropriations request, which was \n5  from April 2017, Hong Decl. Ex. F, and not issued to CHP grant applicants or included in \n6  the Application Guide.  Besides that document, DOJ and its COPS Office have offered no \n7  guidance on what activities would come within the “Illegal Immigration” focus area.  \n8  This vagueness is especially problematic in light of the well-recognized \n9  complexities of federal immigration law, under which a host of statutory provisions can \n10  form the basis for removal, subject to a maze of possible grounds for cancelling or \n11  withholding removal, adjusting status, or according asylum.  See Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at \n12  2506 (noting the “significant complexities involved in enforcing federal immigration law, \n13  including the determination whether a person is removable”).  Congress created a \n14  detailed regime for states and localities that wish to have their officers perform the \n15  functions of a federal immigration officer, which must be pursuant to an agreement that \n16  “shall contain,” inter alia, “a written certification” of adequate training of the particular \n17  officers regarding enforcement of federal immigration laws.  8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(2).  It is \n18  not clear whether DOJ means a “focus” on “Illegal Immigration” to take the form of a \n19  287(g) agreement, or whether it has in mind some other, extra-statutory role it wishes \n20  local law enforcement to play in relation to immigration enforcement.  Whatever DOJ \n21  means, the Constitution requires more clarity than general references to “illegal \n22  immigration.” \n23  2.  The Immigration Enforcement Partnership Consideration is similarly infirm.  \n24  To avoid being disfavored in the grant award process,  a locality must certify compliance \n25  with both the Access Requirement and the Notice Requirement.  Neither is sufficiently \n26  clear. \n27  The Access Requirement demands that a locality have in place “rules, regulations, \n28  policies, and/or practices that ensure that [DHS] personnel have access to any of the \n18 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 25 of 32   Page ID #:291\n \n1  governing body’s correctional or detention facilities in order to meet with an alien (or an \n2  individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be or to remain in \n3  the United States.”  Larracas Decl. Ex. A, Attachment 1.  Los Angeles does not prevent \n4  DHS access to its detention facilities, but the City does comply with state law by \n5  informing the detainee of the request, and it does not facilitate interviews that the \n6  detainee has declined.  Hyams Decl. ¶ 13.  Los Angeles cannot determine whether DOJ \n7  would be satisfied with this access, or whether the requirement is meant to prevent Los \n8  Angeles from providing individuals the required information about the interview request \n9  under state law, or to require the City to facilitate meetings that have been declined by \n10  individuals.  Id. ¶ 14. Moreover, the Access Requirement does not explain what is meant \n11  by an “inquiry” triggering the obligation, and includes no reasonableness requirement or \n12  limiting language to prevent DHS from consuming significant amounts of LAPD staff \n13  time or tying up LAPD interview rooms in a manner that interferes with the safety, \n14  efficiency, or legal time restraints that LAPD must consider in operating its jail facilities. \n15  The Notice Requirement is also insufficiently clear.  DOJ demands “notice as early \n16  as practicable” regarding “the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the \n17  jurisdiction’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the \n18  alien.”  Larracas Decl. Ex. A, Attachment 1.  It is not clear what this would mean in the \n19  context of short-term detention operations, like LAPD’s, in which “scheduled release” is \n20  generally not a relevant concept.  See Hyams Decl. ¶ 12.  The Notice Requirement is \n21  vague in terms of how, if at all, it is meant to be applied in such circumstances. \n22  These ambiguities made it impossible for Los Angeles to understand what strings \n23  DOJ meant to attach to the CHP funding and whether the City could, as a legal matter, or \n24  should, as a policy matter consistent with its responsibilities over local law enforcement \n25  and to promote public safety, agree to comply with the Challenged Considerations to \n26  increase its chances to obtain CHP funding.  See Hyams Decl. ¶ 14.  These difficulties \n27  were compounded by DOJ waiting until the eleventh hour to adopt the Immigration \n28  Enforcement Partnership Consideration, leaving the City with less than 2 weeks to decide \n19 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 26 of 32   Page ID #:292\n \n1  whether it could or should sign the certification.  See Larracas Decl. Ex. A.  This is not \n2  the clear notice the Spending Clause demands. \n3 \n3.  The Challenged Considerations Are Invalid Under the \n4  Administrative Procedure Act.  \nAgency actions are unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act if they are \n5 \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 \n6 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).9  Defendants’ imposition of the Challenged Considerations as part of \n7 \nthe 2017 CHP Application is not in accordance with law as set forth above.  Moreover, \n8 \nDefendants’ imposition of the Challenged Considerations cannot survive arbitrary-and-\n9 \ncapricious review, where the court “must consider whether the decision was based on a \n10 \nconsideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of \n11 \njudgment.”  San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 581, 601 (9th \n12 \nCir. 2014) (citation omitted); Az. Cattle Growers’ Ass’n v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife, Bureau \n13 \nof Land Mgmt., 273 F.3d 1229, 1236 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[W]e carefully review the record \n14 \nto ensure that agency decisions are founded on a reasoned evaluation of the relevant \n15 \nfactors.” (citation omitted)).  \n16 \nThe Challenged Considerations are arbitrary and capricious because DOJ adopted \n17 \nthem without a reasoned basis and provided no support for DOJ’s attempt to link \n18 \nparticipation in, and facilitation of, federal civil immigration investigations by state and \n19 \nlocal officials to Congress’ goals in establishing and designing the COPS grant program \n20 \nto provide funding for specified state and local community policing purposes.  DOJ has \n21 \nasserted that “[c]ities and states that cooperate with federal law enforcement make all of \n22 \nus safer by helping remove dangerous criminals from our communities,” including by \n23 \n24                                                   \n9 The imposition of the Challenged Considerations is a final agency action.  The \n25 \nChallenged Considerations “mark the consummation of the agency’s decision-making \n26  process” and “give[ ] rise to direct and appreciable legal consequences”— Los Angeles’ \ninability to compete on an equal playing field for CHP grants.  U.S. Army Corps of \n27 \nEng’rs v. Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1813-14 (2016) (internal quotation marks \n28  omitted)). \n20 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 27 of 32   Page ID #:293\n \n1  ending “violent crime stemming from illegal immigration.”  See Hong Decl. Ex. E.  But \n2  no evidence is cited to support the implied premise that undocumented immigrants or \n3  other non-citizens commit violent crimes at higher rates than the general population, or to \n4  indicate that the investigations of federal civil immigration violations facilitated by the \n5  Challenged Considerations are focused on individuals involved in violent crime.  Nor do \n6  any of those sources suggest that state or local participation in federal civil immigration \n7  investigations would decrease violent crime.  Ironically, the real impact of DOJ’s new \n8  policy is the opposite of its expressed intent—depriving states and cities of resources to \n9  address public safety needs by hiring new law enforcement officers.   \n10  The Attorney General, in a speech unrelated to the Challenged Considerations, \n11  relied on a study that does not support his claim that there is a relationship between so-\n12  called “sanctuary” policies and violent crime, but rather indicates that there is no such \n13  relationship; other studies, meanwhile, show an inverse relationship.  See Hong Decl. Ex. \n14  C.; see also Contrary to Trump’s Claims, Immigrants Are Less Likely to Commit Crimes, \n15  N.Y. Times (Jan. 26, 2017), attached as Ex. H to Hong Decl.  There is no connection \n16  between that study’s conclusions and imposing the Challenged Considerations as a means \n17  of advancing local community policing.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. \n18  State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (“[A]n agency rule would be \n19  arbitrary and capricious if the agency . . . offered an explanation for its decision that runs \n20  counter to the evidence before the agency.”).  Absent a rational connection between the \n21  Challenged Considerations and Congress’ goal in establishing the COPS grants, one that \n22  is stated and supported by the agency, the Considerations are arbitrary and capricious. \n23 \nB.  Los Angeles Will Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent An Injunction From \n24  This Court. \nLos Angeles will suffer immediate and irreparable harm if DOJ considers the \n25 \nChallenged Considerations in making funding decisions for the FY 2017 CHP grant \n26 \ncycle.  Unless enjoined, the Challenged Considerations will be used to put Los Angeles at \n27 \na disadvantage in the competition for federal funds.  Jurisdictions that agree to participate \n28 \n21 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 28 of 32   Page ID #:294\n \n1  in federal civil immigration investigations and enforcement efforts will be favored in the \n2  application process; those that are not able or willing will be disfavored, losing valuable \n3  “points” in a competitive process.  Supra pp. 6-8, 10.  “A rule putting plaintiffs at a \n4  competitive disadvantage constitutes irreparable harm.”  Int’l Franchise Ass’n, Inc. v. \n5  City of Seattle, 803 F.3d 389, 411 (9th Cir. 2015); see also Ne. Fla. Ch. of Assoc. Gen. \n6  Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993) (“[T]he ‘injury in \n7  fact’ is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss of \n8  a contract.”).10    \n9  Los Angeles is also irreparably harmed by the coercive choice DOJ put the City to.  \n10  Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 381 (1992).  One option the agency \n11  presented to the City was to sacrifice its “sovereign interests and public policies.”  \n12  Kansas v. United States, 249 F.3d 1213, 1227 (10th Cir. 2001).  By agreeing to \n13  participate in federal civil immigration efforts in order to compete on equal footing for \n14  community policing resources, Los Angeles would have been required to compromise its \n15  longstanding policy decision that enmeshing LAPD in civil immigration enforcement \n16  would erode community trust and undermine public safety.  See Hyams Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.  \n17  The other option, and the path Los Angeles ultimately followed, was to compete \n18  for COPS funding at a disadvantage.  The loss of Los Angeles’ ability to compete on fair \n19  and lawful terms threatens the City’s concrete public safety interests.  If Los Angeles is \n20  denied a grant because DOJ has disfavored it for being unwilling to participate in civil \n21  immigration enforcement, the result will not just be a monetary loss but a loss of funding \n22  to hire police officers.  Specifically, Los Angeles plans to use grant funds to hire officers \n23  in support of its Community Safety Partnership Program, which needs these resources to \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n10 Such competitive injury has also “often been recognized as grounds for standing.”  \n26  Bullfrog Films, Inc. v. Wick, 847 F.2d 502, 507 (9th Cir. 1988) (listing cases); see also \nShell Offshore, Inc. v. Greenpeace, Inc., 709 F.3d 1281, 1286-87 (9th Cir. 2013) (facts \n27 \ndemonstrating a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm “necessarily \n28  establish” standing to seek injunctive relief).   \n22 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 29 of 32   Page ID #:295\n \n1  create programs for at-risk youth, escort children safely to school, and engage in other \n2  critical community policework.  Larracas Decl. Ex. G.  Lost opportunities to strengthen \n3  community safety partnerships through a fully-funded program are plainly irreparable \n4  harm. \n5  By forcing the City to make this “unreasonable choice,” the Challenged \n6  Considerations also “result[] in a constitutional injury” sufficient to establish irreparable \n7  harm.  Santa Clara, 2017 WL 1459081, at *27–28; Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc. v. City of \n8  Los Angeles, 559 F.3d 1046, 1058 (9th Cir. 2009); Chicago, 2017 WL 4081821 at *13. \n9  Immediate intervention is warranted here, as DOJ intends to make award \n10  determinations as early as October 30.  Hong Decl. ¶ 10.  Once DOJ makes COPS grant \n11  awards, it would be difficult (if not impossible) to unwind those awards and reallocate \n12  funds.  If DOJ is not prevented from issuing awards that are skewed by reliance on \n13  unlawful considerations, it would be impossible to compensate Los Angeles for (1) the \n14  loss of opportunity to fairly compete for funding, (2) the constitutional injury it suffers \n15  from being put to the impossible choice of either acceding to the violation of its \n16  constitutional rights or risking the loss of funds supporting the hiring of police officers, \n17  and (3) the lack of a fully funded Community Safety Partnership Program, if DOJ’s \n18  decision to disfavor Los Angeles proves dispositive. \n19 \nC.  The Balance Of Equities And The Public Interest Weigh Heavily In \n20  Favor Of The Requested Injunction. \n21    This Court must “balance the competing claims of injury” made by Los Angeles \nand Defendants in determining whether to grant the requested relief.  Winter, 555 U.S. at \n22 \n24.  In addition, the Court should “pay particular regard for the public consequences” of \n23 \nissuing an injunction.  Id.  These two factors merge when the Federal Government is a \n24 \nparty.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  Here, they both weigh strongly in \n25 \nfavor of granting preliminary injunctive relief. \n26 \n  The City of Los Angeles has a number of important interests at stake here.  It has a \n27 \nstrong interest in protecting its sovereignty against unwarranted federal incursion and \n28 \n23 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 30 of 32   Page ID #:296\n \n1  demands that the City forfeit its long-held views on the public safety dangers of \n2  enmeshing local law enforcement in federal civil immigration enforcement.  See Hyams  \n3  Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.  The City has a strong related interest in avoiding the “coercive effects” of \n4  “unconstitutional federal enforcement.”  Santa Clara, 2017 WL 1459081, at *28.  It also \n5  has an interest in maintaining the trust and cooperation of Los Angeles residents to \n6  effectively police local communities and promote public safety amongst some of the \n7  City’s most vulnerable residents.  The Challenged Considerations undermine each of \n8  those interests by forcing the City to choose either to forgo them, or lose its ability to \n9  effectively compete for COPS funding. \n10    The Challenged Considerations also threaten the public’s interest in a well-\n11  functioning City law enforcement apparatus—one built on trust with the community and \n12  founded on the sound policy judgments of local law enforcement authorities, i.e., those \n13  best-equipped to determine how to effectively protect their citizens and police crime in \n14  local communities.  And it is “always in the public’s interest” to issue an injunction in \n15  order to “prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights” as would occur here if \n16  DOJ is allowed to consider the Challenged Considerations in assessing Los Angeles’ \n17  application.  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012); accord Gordon v. \n18  Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Cincinnati, \n19  Inc. v. City of Cincinnati, 822 F.2d 1390, 1399 (6th Cir. 1987) (“the public is certainly \n20  interested in the prevention of enforcement of [laws] which may be unconstitutional”).   \n21    In contrast to the material hardship that will be imposed on Los Angeles and its \n22  residents if the Challenged Considerations are imposed, Defendants will suffer little to no \n23  harm whatsoever if the injunction is granted.  The considerations are wholly unrelated to \n24  the federal grant program here that is directed toward promoting community-oriented \n25  policing, and they fall outside the statutory purposes specified by Congress in 34 U.S.C. \n26  § 10381.  Absent any reasoned basis for implementing the Challenged Considerations, \n27  Defendants can hardly claim they will be harmed by any delay resulting from a \n28  preliminary injunction.  And even if DOJ could provide a sound justification for its new \n24 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 31 of 32   Page ID #:297\n \n1  policy, there is no reason why those Challenged Considerations must be implemented \n2  now, since Defendants have successfully implemented the COPS grant program for years \n3  without them.  Indeed, the fact that DOJ adopted the Immigration Enforcement \n4  Partnership Consideration at the last minute, well after issuing its Application Guide, is a \n5  telling indication that Defendants lack a substantial interest in immediately implementing \n6  this hastily revised grant process.   \n7    Compared to the immediate and substantial harm Los Angeles will face if the \n8  Challenged Considerations are considered, Defendants can point to no immediate harm \n9  that the Federal Government will suffer from a preliminary injunction.  See Chicago, \n10  2017 WL 4081821 at *14.   \n11  IV.  CONCLUSION \n12  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should issue a preliminary injunction to \n13  prevent Defendants from making COPS award determinations by providing “additional \n14  consideration” or any other preferential treatment to applicants that choose “Illegal \n15  Immigration” as a focus area of the grant, or applicants that certify compliance with the \n16  Notice and Access Requirements.  \n17   \n18   \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n25 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 7-1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 32 of 32   Page ID #:298",

Since 2013, an average of nearly \n8  1,300 law enforcement agencies have requested funding through CHP each year – \n9  requests that far exceed the available funds appropriated by Congress.  To ensure \n10  that these limited funds are allocated sensibly, Congress gave the Department of \n11  Justice (“DOJ”) broad discretion to determine which jurisdictions should receive \n12  CHP funding.  DOJ exercises that discretion to promote and support public safety \n13  objectives. \n14    DOJ’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS Office” or \n  \n15  “Office”) awards CHP grants.  To apply for funding, an agency must submit an \n16  application that (1) provides information about the jurisdiction’s needs and \n17  practices and (2) explains how the jurisdiction intends to utilize the new officers it \n18  will hire using CHP funds.  The COPS Office scores the applications according to \n19  both the comparative needs of the applicants and metrics that emphasize the Federal \n20  Government’s enforcement priorities in any given year.  To that end, every year the \n21  Office selects several key “focus areas” for law enforcement and gives extra points \n22  to applications that focus on those areas.  Over time, those focus areas have \n23  changed to reflect differing law enforcement priorities and pressing needs, ranging \n24  broadly from Homicide to Homeland Security to “Children Exposed to Violence.” \n25    For Fiscal Year 2017, the COPS Office included two new law-enforcement \n26  related immigration factors in its scoring system.  First, one of the focus areas was \n27  “Illegal Immigration,” such that applicants could earn extra points by proposing \n28  ways to contribute to combatting illegal immigration.  Second, applicants could \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 12 of 36   Page ID #:1723\n \n1  earn extra points by adopting policies to ensure (1) that the Department of \n2  Homeland Security (“DHS”) has access to the applicant’s detention facilities to \n3  meet with aliens who have, or may have, committed crimes, and (2) that upon its \n4  request, DHS receives advance notice of the scheduled release of a criminal alien in \n5  the jurisdiction’s custody. \n6    Los Angeles challenges the “decision” to include these factors in the FY \n7  2017 application and scoring system (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 85, 112, 128), claiming it was ultra \n8  vires and violated the Separation of Powers, limitations on the Spending Power, and \n9  the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  The City’s claims regarding that \n10  decision, however, are non-justiciable.  As the accompanying declaration makes \n11  clear, Los Angeles would not have received CHP funding this year even if all points \n12  related to illegal immigration had been excluded, such that the City has no legally \n13  cognizable interest in the FY 2017 factors.  Moreover, to the extent plaintiff seeks \n14  to rely on any interest in whatever factors will be used in the FY 2018 grant cycle, \n      \n15  its claims would be non-justiciable because one cannot assume that Los Angeles \n16  will seek a CHP grant at that time or that the same factors will be used.  \n17    But even if plaintiff’s claims were otherwise cognizable, they would fail on \n18  the merits.  The statutes give DOJ broad discretion to allocate scarce CHP funds \n19  among the many applicants that seek them, such that the Office was not acting ultra \n20  vires or encroaching on the congressional sphere.  As for the Spending Clause, the \n21  immigration-related factors – which were mere scoring criteria rather than condi-\n22  tions on federal funds – were unambiguous and clearly related to the CHP’s \n23  purposes.  The COPS Office offered to answer any questions from potential \n24  applicants (an offer Los Angeles did not accept), and facilitating federal access to \n25  criminal aliens in local custody promotes public safety.  Finally, as for plaintiff’s \n26  APA claim, the factors were consistent with the CHP’s purposes, and nothing in the \n27  statute suggests these factors are off limits.  Plaintiff may have a “difference in \n28  view,” but that is not an APA violation.  See, e.g., All. for the Wild Rockies v. Peña, \n       2\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 13 of 36   Page ID #:1724\n \n1  865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2017). \n2    For these reasons, plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment should be \n3  denied, and judgment should be entered dismissing Counts Four, Five, and Six of \n4  plaintiff’s Complaint.1 \n5  STATUTORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE BACKGROUND \n6  I.  COPS Hiring Program and the COPS Office \n7    A.  Governing Statutes and Creation of the Program \n8    In the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Congress \n9  authorized the Attorney General to “make grants to States, units of local \n10  government, [and] Indian tribal governments . . . to increase police presence, to \n11  expand and improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and \n12  members of the community to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise \n13  to enhance public safety.”  Pub. L. No. 103-322, Title I, § 10003(a), 108 Stat. 1808 \n14  (1994).  As later amended and currently codified, the statute provides authority to \n      \n15  make grants for any of several specific purposes, including –  \n \n16 \n  (1) to rehire law enforcement officers who have been laid off as \n17  a result of State, tribal, or local budget reductions for deployment in \ncommunity-oriented policing; [and] \n18 \n  (2) to hire and train new, additional career law enforcement \n19  officers for deployment in community-oriented policing across the \nNation, including by prioritizing the hiring and training of \n20 \nveterans . . . . \n21 \n34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2). \n22 \n  The Attorney General created the COPS Office to administer grants under \n23 \nthis enactment.  See Declaration of Andrew A. Dorr ¶ 2 (“Dorr Decl.”).  The Office \n24 \nis headed by a Director appointed by the Attorney General.  Id.; 28 C.F.R. §§ 0.119, \n25 \n                                              \n26 \n  1 Counts One, Two and Three relate to a different program, the Edward \n27  Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.  This Court has stayed proceed-\nings on those claims pending developments in City of Chicago v. Sessions, No. 17-\n28 \n2991 (7th Cir.). \n       3\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 14 of 36   Page ID #:1725\n \n1  0.120.  The COPS Office began implementing 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1) and (b)(2) \n2  in 1994.  Initially, the Office operated two programs, one for large grantees and one \n3  for small grantees.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 5.  The programs were combined in 1995 under the \n4  name Universal Hiring Program (“UHP”), which was renamed the COPS Hiring \n5  Program in 2010.  Id. \n6    Under CHP, the COPS Office makes grants to state and local governments to \n7  hire, rehire, or train law enforcement officers for deployment in “community-\n8  oriented policing.”  Id. ¶¶ 5, 7.  A COPS Hiring Program grant is discretionary, id. \n9  ¶ 4 – that is, it is a grant “for which the federal awarding agency generally may \n10  select the recipient from among all eligible recipients, may decide to make or not \n11  make an award based on the programmatic, technical, or scientific content of an \n12  application, and can decide the amount of funding to be awarded.”  See Discre-\n13  tionary Grant, Grant Terminology, https://www.grants.gov/ web/ grants/ learn-\n14  grants/ grant-terminology.html (last visited Jan. 11, 2018).  Discretionary grants \n      \n15  differ from formula grants, under which a “statutory device” “determines who the \n16  recipients are and how much money each shall receive.”  City of Los Angeles v. \n17  McLaughlin, 865 F.2d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir. 1989) (citation omitted). \n18    The operation of the CHP – like all other COPS Office programs – is subject \n19  to annual appropriations by Congress.  Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.  Each year, Congress \n20  appropriates a certain amount “for the hiring and rehiring of additional career law \n21  enforcement officers” under the Program.  See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 114-113, 129 Stat. \n22  2242, 2310-11 (2015); Pub. Law No. 113-235, 128 Stat. 2130, 2196 (2014).2  Those \n23  appropriated amounts have decreased over the last several years, making CHP \n24  increasingly competitive.  Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.  Each year, the applications that the \n25  COPS Office receives seek more funds than Congress has appropriated.  Id. ¶ 13. \n                                              \n26 \n  2 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b) provides statutory authority for several other potential \n27  grants, 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(3) - (22), but Congress has never appropriated funds \nfor most of them and, therefore, the COPS Office has never offered grants under \n28 \nmost of them.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 6.  \n       4\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 15 of 36   Page ID #:1726\n \n1    The statute sets forth certain specific requirements for the Program.  For \n2  example, the Office must award at least 0.5% of the available funding to grantees \n3  within any State that has eligible applicants (which helps ensure that smaller States \n4  are not excluded), 34 U.S.C. § 10381(f); Dorr Decl. ¶ 9; the Office must allocate \n5  50% of each year’s available funds to jurisdictions with a population over 150,000 \n6  and 50% of the funds to jurisdictions with lower population, 34 U.S.C. § 10381(h); \n7  see id. § 10261(a)(11)(B); and each grantee must provide a portion of the money \n8  used to hire or rehire officer that CHP funds, subject to discretionary waiver by the \n9  Attorney General, id. § 10381(g).  \n10    B.  Scoring Applications and Selecting Grantees \n11    Other than these broad rules, the statutes governing the Program do not \n12  prescribe any particular method or factors for evaluating applications or choosing \n13  which applications to fund.  Therefore, the COPS Office must necessarily exercise \n14  judgment and discretion in choosing among applications.  The Office has developed \n      \n15  methods to evaluate and score applications to determine how best to allocate the \n16  Program’s finite funds, and those scoring factors change from time to time to reflect \n17  varying public safety priorities.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 14.   \n18    A jurisdiction seeking a CHP grant submits an electronic application on the \n19  COPS Office web site.  Id. ¶ 10.  The application is part of a system that assigns a \n20  specific number of points for each answer given.  Id. ¶ 15.  Some of the factors that \n21  the Office uses in scoring are reflected in the statutes.  For example, the statute \n22  states that applicants “shall . . . demonstrate a specific public safety need [and] \n23  explain the applicant’s inability to address the need without Federal assistance.”  34 \n24  U.S.C. § 10382(c)(2), (3).  The Office has implemented this directive by requesting \n25  data reflecting each applicant’s crime statistics and financial need and by according \n26  extra points based on higher crime rates and comparatively greater fiscal need.  \n27  Dorr Decl. ¶ 16.  Similarly, the system scores the quality of the applicant’s \n28  community policing plan pursuant to the statutory requirement that applicants \n       5\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 16 of 36   Page ID #:1727\n \n1  “explain how the grant will be utilized to reorient the affected law enforcement \n2  agency’s mission toward community-oriented policing or enhance its involvement \n3  in or commitment to community-oriented policing.”  Id.; 34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(10). \n4    Most of the factors that the COPS Office has historically used to score are \n5  adopted as an exercise of the Office’s discretion to evaluate applications and \n6  distribute scarce funding.  The Office has employed such discretionary factors since \n7  the inception of the Program, and Congress has continued to appropriate funding \n8  each year with a complete understanding of how the Office administers it.  The \n9  Office exercises its discretion through several mechanisms, without which the \n10  program’s limited funding could not be rationally awarded. \n11    First, each year, the COPS Office designates several broad areas of public \n12  safety and community policing, and applicants must indicate which areas their \n13  activities will support.  And each year, the Office prioritizes certain of the available \n14  areas; applicants that select those focus areas receive extra points in the system.  \n      \n15  Dorr Decl. ¶ 18.  The available areas and the focus areas have changed over the \n16  years, reflecting changes in both national law enforcement necessities and DOJ \n17  priorities.  For example, in FY 2014, after the Newtown (Conn.) Police Department \n18  failed to score high enough to receive a CHP grant after the 2012 Sandy Hook \n19  shooting, the COPS Office added a “catastrophic event” question and assigned it \n20  the highest level of extra points to ensure that the Office could assist agencies \n21  afflicted by unexpected catastrophes like that shooting.  Id.  For FY 2017, the \n22  available areas were Child and Youth Safety Focus; Child and Youth Safety Focus: \n23  School Based Policing; Illegal Immigration; Drug Abuse; Homeland Security \n24  Problems; Non-Violent Crime Problems and Quality-of-Life Policing; Building \n25  Trust and Respect; Traffic/Pedestrian Safety Problems; and Violent Crime \n26  Problems.  Id. ¶ 7.  Consistent with the statute, the areas often reflect priorities for \n27  which “cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies” at the federal and \n28 \n       6\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 17 of 36   Page ID #:1728\n \n1  local levels can be beneficial.   \n2    Second, certain questions on the CHP application that do not relate to focus \n3  areas are awarded more points than other questions based on their significance to \n4  advancing community policing or other law enforcement priorities.  Id. ¶ 18.  For \n5  example, the system accords extra points for certain management practices, \n6  including the regular assessment of employee satisfaction, the exercise of flexibility \n7  shift assignments to facilitate addressing problems, and the operation of an “early \n8  intervention system” to identify officers showing signs of stress.  Id.  Additionally, \n9  from FY 2013 through FY 2016, the COPS Office, based on the Attorney General’s \n10  priorities, assigned extra points for jurisdictions that preferred military veterans in \n11  hiring officers with CHP funds, although no such preference was then mandated in \n12  the statute.  Id. ¶ 19; see Pub. L. No. 115-37, 131 Stat. 854 (2017) (expressly \n13  authorizing “prioritizing the hiring and training of veterans”). \n14    Third, each individual factor on the application falls into one of three \n      \n15  categories:  Fiscal Health, Crime, or Community Policing.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 20.  After \n16  calculating each applicant’s raw scores, the Office gives different weights to the \n17  applicant’s scores in each of these categories, based on the Attorney General’s \n18  priorities and the needs of public safety.  Id.  For most years, the Fiscal Health \n19  category has been weighted as 20% of the final score, the Crime category has been \n20  weighted as 30% of the final score, and the Community Policing category has been \n21  weighted as 50% of the final score.  Id.  The Office changes these percentages from \n22  time to time.  In FY 2009, for example, in light of the fiscal issues that resulted in \n23  enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Office \n24  accorded 50% of the weighting to the “Fiscal Health” category.  Id. \n25    C.  Factors Related to Enforcement of Immigration Laws \n26    Beginning with Fiscal Year 2016, certain immigration-related requirements \n27  and scoring factors have been included in the COPS Hiring Program. \n28    CHP grantees, like all federal grantees, are required to comply with all \n       7\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 18 of 36   Page ID #:1729\n \n1  applicable federal laws.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 23.  Beginning with FY 2016, the Office has \n2  advised each applicant that this requirement includes compliance with 8 U.S.C. \n3  § 1373, which provides that “a Federal, State, or local government entity or official \n4  may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from \n5  sending to, or receiving from, [federal immigration authorities] information regard-\n6  ing the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.”  8 \n7  U.S.C. § 1373(a); Dorr Decl. ¶ 23.  In FY 2017, the Office required applicants to \n8  certify compliance with Section 1373 as a threshold eligibility requirement, \n9  although there was no scoring associated with it.  Id. \n10    For FY 2017, the priority areas on the CHP application included proposals \n11  that prioritized addressing problems with violent crime; those that focused on \n12  homeland security, such as protecting critical infrastructure; and those that focused \n13  on contributing to the control of illegal immigration or cooperating with federal \n14  authorities in enforcing immigration law.  Id. ¶ 18.  Thus, the system assigned extra \n      \n15  points for focusing on Illegal Immigration, although it also gave an equal or greater \n16  number of points for focusing on other specified areas.  Id. ¶ 24.  Seven jurisdic-\n17  tions chose Illegal Immigration as the focus area of their FY 2017 applications, but \n18  none scored high enough to receive funding prior to the addition of any points \n19  attributable to the access-and-notice factors described below.  Id.3 \n20    Lastly, beginning in FY 2017, the COPS Office offered applicants the \n21  opportunity to receive additional points by certifying that the applicant had \n22  implemented or would implement regulations or policies to ensure (1) that DHS \n23  would have access to the applicant’s detention facilities “to meet with an alien (or \n24  an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be or to \n25  remain in the United States,” and (2) that the applicant’s detention facilities would \n                                              \n26 \n3 Defendants’ opposition to plaintiff’s preliminary injunction motion stated \n27  that none of the applicants that chose Illegal Immigration scored high enough to \nreceive an award.  Shortly before the filing of the present motion, however, the \n28 \nCOPS Office realized that statement was in error.  Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 30-35 & n.5. \n       8\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 19 of 36   Page ID #:1730\n \n1  “provide advance notice as early as practicable (at least 48 hours, where possible) \n2  to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdic-\n3  tion’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the \n4  alien.”  Id. ¶ 25.  To inform applicants of the opportunity to receive points based on \n5  these factors, the Office electronically sent each applicant a letter, certification \n6  form, and background documents.  Id. ¶ 27 & Ex. B.  These materials stated that the \n7  certification would not commit applicants to detain any individuals beyond their \n8  scheduled time of release and that applicants would not be penalized if they did not \n9  operate detention facilities.  Id. ¶ 27.  A jurisdiction’s certification regarding these \n10  factors did not forbid the jurisdiction from informing detainees that they may \n11  choose not to meet with federal immigration authorities where the jurisdiction’s \n12  laws required providing that information.  Id. ¶ 26.  Nor did the certification require \n13  a jurisdiction to notify DHS before releasing an alien under short-term detention \n14  with an unknown release time.  Id.   \n      \n15  II.  Immigration and Nationality Act \n16    Enforcement of the immigration laws, including and especially the investiga-\n17  tion and apprehension of criminal aliens, is a quintessential law enforcement \n18  function.  Through the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. §§ \n19  1101-07, Congress granted the Executive Branch significant authority to control the \n20  conduct of foreign nationals in the United States.  These responsibilities are \n21  assigned to law enforcement agencies, as the INA authorizes DHS, DOJ, and other \n22  Executive agencies to administer and enforce the immigration laws.  The INA \n23  permits the Executive Branch to exercise considerable discretion to direct enforce-\n24  ment pursuant to federal policy objectives.  See, e.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 \n25  U.S. 387, 396 (2012).   \n26    The INA includes several provisions that protect the ability of federal \n27  officials to investigate the status of aliens and otherwise enforce the immigration \n28  laws.  For example, the statute provides that a federal immigration officer “shall \n       9\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 20 of 36   Page ID #:1731\n \n1  have power without warrant . . . to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an \n2  alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(1).  \n3  Separately, as noted above, 8 U.S.C. § 1373 provides that “a Federal, State, or local \n4  government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any govern-\n5  ment entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, [federal authorities] \n6  information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of \n7  any individual.”  Id. § 1373(a).  The INA provides that certain classes of aliens \n8  shall be removed from the United States upon the order of the Attorney General or \n9  the Secretary of Homeland Security.  See, e.g., id. §§ 1227(a), 1228. \n10    The INA also establishes immigration enforcement as a cooperative endeavor \n11  among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.  See, e.g., id. § 1357(g) \n12  (providing that DHS may enter into formal agreements with states and localities \n13  under which trained and qualified state and local officers may perform specified \n14  functions of a federal immigration officer); see also id. § 1324(c) (authorizing state \n      \n15  and local officers to make arrests for violations of the INA’s prohibition against \n16  smuggling aliens); id. § 1252c (authorizing state and local officers to arrest certain \n17  felons who have unlawfully returned to the United States).   \n18  III.  Los Angeles’s CHP/UHP Applications and Grants \n19    Since 1995, Los Angeles has applied for grants under the CHP or its \n20  predecessor nine times – in Fiscal Years 1995, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2009, 2011, 2012, \n21  2016, and 2017.  The 2011 and 2017 applications were denied, and the others were \n22  granted.  Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 30-32.  The City’s application for FY 2017 was denied \n23  because it scored below those of other large-population jurisdictions, even without \n24  regard to any immigration-related factors.  Id. ¶ 32.  The COPS Office has now \n25  completed reviewing all of the CHP applications for FY 2017, and has awarded all \n26  of the available CHP funds.  Id. ¶ 33. \n27  IV.  Procedural History \n28    Plaintiff commenced this action on September 29, 2017, and simultaneously \n       10\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 21 of 36   Page ID #:1732\n \n1  filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin use of the immigration-\n2  related scoring factors for FY 2017 (Doc. 7-1).  Defendants’ opposition to the \n3  motion explained that Los Angeles would not receive a CHP grant even without \n4  regarding to those factors (Doc. 33), and plaintiff withdrew its motion (Doc. 37). \n5  ARGUMENT \n6    A party may file a motion for summary judgment “at any time” until after the \n7  close of discovery.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(b).  “The court shall grant summary \n8  judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material \n9  fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n10  56(a).  A party may file a motion for summary judgment without having filed an \n11  answer, and the filing of such a motion tolls the time to answer.  See Mann v. Lee, \n12  No. C 07-00781 MMC (PR), 2009 WL 5178095, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 22, \n13  2009). \n14    In light of the governing statutes and the language of the challenged scoring \n      \n15  factors, “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the [defendants are] \n16  entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Plaintiff’s claims regarding the CHP are \n17  non-justiciable because it lacks a cognizable interest in the decisions to include \n18  immigration-related factors.  Alternatively, even if plaintiff’s claims were \n19  cognizable, they would be without merit.  Thus, plaintiff’s motion for partial \n20  summary judgment should be denied, and judgment should be entered for the \n21  defendants on these claims.4 \n22  I.  All of Plaintiff’s Claims Must Be Dismissed as Non-Justiciable \n23    Article III of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to live “Cases” \n24  and “Controversies.”  To satisfy the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of \n25 \n                                              \n  4 Even if this Court were to conclude that Los Angeles had established a right \n26 \nto judgment, any injunction should be limited to the plaintiff rather than applying to \n27  all CHP applicants.  See Price v. City of Stockton, 390 F.3d 1105, 1117 (9th Cir. \n2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Skydive Arizona, Inc. v. \n28 \nQuattrocchi, 673 F.3d 1105, 1116 (9th Cir. 2012). \n       11\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 22 of 36   Page ID #:1733\n \n1  standing to sue, a plaintiff must demonstrate an “injury in fact,” a “fairly traceable” \n2  causal connection between the injury and defendant’s conduct, and redressability.  \n3  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102-03 (1998).  Further, to \n4  establish standing to seek equitable relief, the plaintiff must show a likelihood of \n5  future injury.  See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983).  In Lyons, for \n6  example, the Supreme Court held that there was no “real and immediate threat” that \n7  the plaintiff would be subjected to certain police conduct in the future.  Id. at 105.  \n8  Thus, “the speculative nature of [plaintiff’s] claim that he [would] again experience \n9  injury” deprived him of standing.  Id. at 109.  This rule applies regardless of the \n10  type of equitable relief sought – whether declaratory or injunctive.  See Brown v. \n11  Or. Dep’t of Corr., 751 F.3d 983, 990 (9th Cir. 2014); Canatella v. California, 304 \n12  F.3d 843, 852 (9th Cir. 2002). \n13    Under these principles, plaintiff’s claims regarding the CHP factors must be \n14  dismissed as non-justiciable, whether focused forward on the eventual FY 2018 \n      \n15  factors or backward on the FY 2017 factors.5  Plaintiff purports to rely on a \n16  “competitive disadvantage . . . in future grant cycles” for CHP funds (Doc. 49 at \n17  23), and to seek declaratory and injunctive relief to eliminate that future “disadvan-\n18  tage.”  See Complaint at 39-40 (Doc. 1).  As noted above, however, Los Angeles \n19  has applied for CHP or UHP grants only nine times during the twenty-three years of \n20  the program’s existence.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 36.  Moreover, the focus areas and other \n21  scoring factors that the Office uses in selecting among applications change from \n22  time to time, and the Office has not determined the focus areas for FY 2018 or how \n23  immigration-related factors will be handled in the FY 2018 application.  Id. ¶¶ 14, \n24  18, 24, 29. \n25    In light of these circumstances, plaintiff lacks a cognizable “injury in fact” in \n                                              \n26 \n  5 Additionally, to the extent plaintiff seeks to challenge whatever factors the \n27  Office may decide to use in the FY 2018 grant season, the City’s claim under the \nAPA should be dismissed for lack of “final” agency action.  5 U.S.C. § 704.  See \n28 \nCal. Sea Urchin Comm’n v. Bean, 828 F.3d 1046, 1049 (9th Cir. 2016).  \n       12\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 23 of 36   Page ID #:1734\n \n1  relation to future grant cycles.  Plaintiff’s case for standing necessarily assumes \n2  both that it will seek a CHP grant in FY 2018 and that the same challenged factors \n3  will be used at that time.  Both assumptions are fatally “speculative.”  Lyons, 461 \n4  U.S. at 109.  Thus, there is no “real and immediate threat” that plaintiff will again \n5  be subjected to the scoring factors challenged here, and all of plaintiff’s claims \n6  must be dismissed for lack of Article III standing.  Id. at 105. \n7    Moreover, to the extent plaintiff relies on any interest in the FY 2017 scoring \n8  factors, its claims have become moot.  See Sanford v. MemberWorks, Inc., 625 F.3d \n9  550, 556 (9th Cir. 2010) (stating that the “requisite personal interest that must exist \n10  at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its \n11  existence (mootness)”) (quoting U.S. Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, \n12  397 (1980)).  Plaintiff would not have received a FY 2017 award regardless of \n13  those factors, and the COPS Office has awarded all 2017 funds; thus, the City can \n14  have no legally cognizable interest in the FY 2017 factors.  Also, the “capable-of-\n      \n15  repetition” exception (Doc. 49-1 at 10 n.4) cannot apply here because it requires “a \n16  reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same \n17  action again.”  See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17 (1998) (internal quotation \n18  marks omitted).  There is no such “reasonable expectation,” especially given that \n19  Los Angeles has applied for CHP/UHP grants only nine times during the program’s \n20  twenty-three years – 39% of the time.  \n \n21 \nII.  Alternatively, the Court Should Enter Judgment for  \n22    Defendants on the Merits \n \n23 \n  A.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Consistent  \n24      with the Governing Statutes  \n25    Plaintiff’s Count Four alleges that the COPS Office acted beyond its \n26  authority and encroached upon that of Congress in adopting immigration-related \n27  factors in the CHP.  In this case, at least, the concepts of statutory authority and \n28  separation of powers are two ways of looking at the same issue.  Article I of the \n       13\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 24 of 36   Page ID #:1735\n \n1  Constitution confers on Congress the authority to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, \n2  Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and \n3  general Welfare of the United States.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  In exercising \n4  this power, Congress may – and often does – delegate to the Executive Branch the \n5  authority to make decisions regarding the expenditure of funds.  See, e.g., Clinton v. \n6  City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 488 (1998) (“Congress has frequently delegated \n7  the President the authority to spend, or not to spend, particular sums of money.”).  \n8    The Executive Branch is responsible for implementing the law.  The \n9  Supreme Court has held that an Executive “officer may be said to act ultra vires \n10  only when he acts without any authority whatever.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. \n11  v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101 n.11 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n12  Thus, claims that an agency has used its authority erroneously or inappropriately \n13  are insufficient to state an ultra vires claim.  Rather, ultra vires claims must be \n14  based on an “officer’s lack of delegated power”; merely claiming an “error in the \n      \n15  exercise of that power is . . . not sufficient.”  Larson v. Domestic & Foreign \n16  Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 690 (1949) (emphasis added).   \n17    Here, the Department of Justice, acting through the COPS Office, is \n18  responsible for disseminating the scarce funds appropriated under 34 U.S.C. \n19  § 10381(b)(1) and (b)(2).  The statute gives the Office discretion in disseminating \n20  those funds, and the inadequacy of the available funds to cover all applications \n21  requires DOJ to adopt and employ factors to rank and choose among them.  \n22  Although the statute imposes certain requirements on disseminating CHP funding, \n23  those requirements are only broad guidelines that are too general to actually \n24  allocate the awards.  Congress gave DOJ discretion to fill in the gaps.    \n25    By statute, CHP funds must be used to hire, rehire, and train officers “for \n26  deployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  The \n27  statute also provides a broad framework for DOJ’s discretionary awards.  \n28  Recognizing that there would likely not be enough money to fund every applicant, \n       14\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 25 of 36   Page ID #:1736\n \n1  Congress required that at least 0.5% of available funding be awarded to the grantees \n2  within any State that has eligible applicants, id. § 10381(f), that DOJ equally \n3  allocate the available funds between large and small jurisdictions, id. § 10381(h); \n4  id. § 10261(a)(11)(B), and that DOJ generally require local jurisdictions to provide \n5  matching funds, id. § 10381(g).  Congress also specified that each application must, \n6  among other things, “demonstrate a specific public safety need,” “explain the \n7  applicant’s inability to address the need without Federal assistance,” and “explain \n8  how the grant will be utilized to reorient the [applicant’s] mission toward \n9  community-oriented policing or enhance its involvement in or commitment to \n10  community-oriented policing.”  Id. § 10382(c)(2), (3), (10).     \n11    Beyond these basic requirements, the statute provides no comprehensive \n12  framework or formula for choosing among the many jurisdictions that satisfy the \n13  requirements.  Indeed, the statute does not even direct DOJ to prioritize applications \n14  that show the greatest “public safety need,” the most dire “inability to address the \n      \n15  need without Federal assistance,” or the greatest ability or willingness “to reorient \n16  the [applicant’s] mission toward community-oriented policing.”  It instead leaves \n17  the details to DOJ, which means the COPS Office must either choose the winning \n18  applicants via random lottery – an irrational method that losing applicants would \n19  surely challenge as arbitrary and capricious – or develop a logical method of select-\n20  ing worthy applicants that represents a reasonable exercise of DOJ’s discretion.  By \n21  taking the latter course, the Office is not encroaching on Congress.  It is simply \n22  filling in gaps that Congress delegated for it to fill, no doubt because Congress \n23  wanted DOJ to use its law-enforcement expertise to award these grants in ways that \n24  best promote Congress’s broad goal of making our communities safer through \n25  community-oriented policing.  Cf. United States v. Dang, 488 F.3d 1135, 1140 (9th \n26  Cir. 2007) (“Here, a plain reading of the statute indicates that Congress intended to \n27  leave a statutory gap for the administrative agency to fill.”).   \n28    Plaintiff’s arguments do not establish a right to judgment on the Separation \n       15\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 26 of 36   Page ID #:1737\n \n1  of Powers or ultra vires claim.  First, the discretionary considerations set forth at 34 \n2  U.S.C. § 10381(c) are not mandatory considerations, let alone exhaustive ones \n3  (Doc. 49-1 at 13).  They are, rather, bases on which “the Attorney General may give \n4  preferential consideration, where feasible.”  Id. (emphasis added).  And these \n5  factors obviously are not exhaustive, because merely prioritizing jurisdictions that \n6  provide greater than 25% matching funds, id. § 10381(c)(1), or that have certain \n7  laws related to child sex trafficking, id. § 10381(c)(2)-(3), would not be sufficient \n8  to allocate limited CHP funding among the many applicants.  Congress’s inclusion \n9  of a few factors that the Office “may” consider plainly does not foreclose the Office \n10  from developing additional factors to guide how it awards these discretionary \n11  grants.  See Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003).6 \n12    Over the last twenty-three years, the COPS Office has used many \n13  discretionary factors, not expressly reflected in the statute, to identify which \n14  applicants are most deserving of COPS hiring grants.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 18-20.  For \n      \n15  example, the statute says nothing about prioritizing different areas of public safety \n16  from year to year, which is an obvious means of directing priorities and distributing \n17  funds logically and equitably.  Id. ¶ 18.  Nor does the statute expressly direct the \n18  Office to favor localities that have recently experienced a catastrophic event (like \n19  the 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino, California, which resulted in a FY 2016 \n20  grant to that city’s police department), or to assign extra points for exercising \n21  flexibility in shift assignments, or for attempting to identify officers showing signs \n22  of stress.  Id.  Nor did the statute mandate the Office’s military veteran preference \n23  until Congress added it in 2017.  Id. ¶ 19.  In short, since Congress created the CHP \n24  discretionary grant program, DOJ has exercised its discretion to develop and use a \n25 \n                                              \n  6 This is confirmed by the fact that Congress added the human-trafficking \n26 \nprovisions only in 2015.  See Pub. L. No. 114-22, § 1002, 129 Stat. 227, 266-67 \n27  (2015).  If plaintiff’s construction of the statute were correct, prior to 2015, the \nCOPS Office would have been limited to ranking applicants based on a jurisdic-\n28 \ntion’s willingness to exceed the minimum matching requirement. \n       16\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 27 of 36   Page ID #:1738\n \n1  variety of factors to award funding.  The factors at issue here are just the latest \n2  example of that broad discretion.  If plaintiff’s theory were correct, all of these \n3  discretionary actions over the years – from prioritizing mass shootings to stressing \n4  officer safety – would have to be deemed ultra vires.  And Congress, knowing of \n5  this (purportedly) ultra vires activity, would have to be deemed to have ignored it \n6  repeatedly by appropriating funding for the program every year without restriction. \n7    Second, plaintiff misreads the statute in arguing that most of the factors on \n8  which the Office relies are not among the alleged “detailed list of twenty-two \n9  purposes” for the program in 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1) through (22) (Doc. 49-1 at \n10  17).  The COPS Hiring Program is authorized by only the first two paragraphs of \n11  Section 10381(b), which authorize providing grants for hiring, rehiring, and train-\n12  ing law enforcement officers “for deployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 \n13  U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  That language is reflected in Congress’s annual \n14  appropriations, which provide funds specifically “for the hiring and rehiring of \n      \n15  additional career law enforcement officers.”  See, e.g., Pub. Law No. 113-235, 128 \n16  Stat. 2130, 2196 (2014).  The other paragraphs of Section 10381(b) authorize other \n17  potential grants, when appropriated by Congress, such as grants “to establish \n18  innovative programs to reduce, and keep to a minimum, the amount of time that law \n19  enforcement officers must be away from the community while awaiting court \n20  appearances” or “to support the purchase by a law enforcement agency of no more \n21  than 1 service weapon per officer.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(10), (16).  Congress has \n22  never appropriated money to fund those other grants, and accordingly the COPS \n23  Office does not award funds for those purposes.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 6.7 \n24    Third, the challenged factors in the COPS Hiring Program do not \n25 \n                                              \n26 \n  7 Quoting subsection (a) of 34 U.S.C. § 10381, plaintiff argues that the \n27  statute Act created “a single grant program” (Doc. 49-1 at 19).  However, regard-\nless of whether subsections (b)(1) through (b)(22) are characterized as having \n28 \nauthorized  twenty-two potential programs or one program with twenty-two \n       17\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 28 of 36   Page ID #:1739\n \n1  impermissibly exercise “direction, supervision, or control over any police force or \n2  any other criminal justice agency” in violation of 34 U.S.C. § 10228 (contra Doc. \n3  7-1 at 14-15).  Merely encouraging cooperation with federal authorities by giving \n4  additional points as one portion of a broader scoring system to administer a discre-\n5  tionary program does not exercise “direction, supervision, or control.”  Indeed, \n6  concurrent with the enactment of 34 U.S.C. § 10228, Congress created the National \n7  Institute of Justice, see Pub. L. No. 96-157, §§ 202, 815, 93 Stat. 1167 (1979), \n8  which has as one of its express statutory purposes “to develop programs and \n9  projects . . . to improve and expand cooperation among the Federal Government, \n10  States, and units of local government . . . .”  34 U.S.C. § 10122(c)(2)(F). \n11    Fourth, Section 287(g) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(3), does not limit the \n12  means by which a state or local government can assist in the enforcement of immi-\n13  gration law or prohibit the COPS Office from assigning extra points to jurisdictions \n14  that opt to assist federal immigration enforcement (contra Doc. 49-1 at 17-18 & \n      \n15  n.5).  As the Supreme Court has observed, Section 287(g) only delineates some of \n16  the circumstances under which “state officers may perform the functions of an \n17  immigration officer,” Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 408 (2012), which \n18  include arresting aliens for “entering or attempting to enter the United States in \n19  violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the \n20  admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2).  No \n21  formal agreement is required for state and local officers to assist in other ways, such \n22  as by providing access to aliens they have detained or informing federal authorities \n23  of the impending release of such persons where practical.8 \n                                              \n24 \npotential purposes, the statute, in practice, is funded as one program with essentially \n25  one purpose. \n8 Also, although a willingness to enter into an agreement under that provision \n26 \nmay accord a CHP applicant additional points in the scoring process, any funds \n27  awarded would have to be used to hire or rehire officers pursuant to the require-\nments of the Program, not for any state or local expenses of such an agreement.  \n28 \nDorr Decl. ¶ 24 n.2. \n       18\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 29 of 36   Page ID #:1740\n \n1    Fifth, nothing in the governing statutes or case law prohibits DOJ from using \n2  scoring factors that “encourage states to pass laws or enact policies or practices that \n3  the federal government favors” (Doc. 49-1 at 13-15).9  Indeed, the Supreme Court \n4  has made clear that a federal agency can use grant conditions as a “relatively mild \n5  encouragement” for States and localities to change their laws and policies, \n6  including statutes on subjects like the purchase of alcohol.  See S. Dakota v. Dole, \n7  483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987).  Moreover, many of the other scoring factors in the CHP \n8  – factors not challenged here and never challenged elsewhere – “encourage” \n9  potential grantees to change their laws or policies, such as according extra points \n10  for exercising flexibility in shift assignments and for operating an “early interven-\n11  tion system” to identify officers showing signs of stress.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 18.   \n12    Sixth, the “clear statement” rule in Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 461 \n13  (1991), does not apply to the development and use of scoring factors in the COPS \n14  Hiring Program (contra Doc. 49-1 at 14).  In Gregory, the Court addressed whether \n      \n15  federal law would override a state constitutional provision requiring judges to retire \n16  at age seventy.  Id. at 455-61.  The Court held that it would not “upset the usual \n17  constitutional balance of federal and state powers” without a “clear statement” from \n18  Congress.  Id. at 460-61.  But this case does not involve overriding state or local \n19  law.  It is, rather, simply the latest iteration of an over-two-decades-old \n20 \n                                              \n21    9 Nor does the legislative history limit the COPS Office’s discretion (contra \nDoc. 49-1 at 15).  Indeed, that history supports the addition of the factors chal-\n22 \nlenged here.  The portion of the history quoted by the plaintiff reads in full:  “In \n23  establishing funding levels and selection criteria for these grants, the Attorney \nGeneral is expected to take into account local needs, costs, and other factors.  It is \n24 \ncontemplated . . . that the Attorney General will consider a wide range of relevant \n25  criteria, including – among other factors – the needs of areas with high crime rates, \nlow officer to population ratios, understaffing of law enforcement agencies in \n26 \nrelation to the size of the geographic areas for which they are responsible, high \n27  unemployment and economic dislocation rates that may contribute to increased \ncrime problems, and other relevant trends.”  H.R. Rep. No. 103-324 at 10 \n28 \n(emphasis added). \n       19\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 30 of 36   Page ID #:1741\n \n1  discretionary program that gives state and local agencies an opportunity to focus on \n2  federal enforcement priorities and thereby increase their chances of receiving a \n3  grant.  Nothing in this voluntary program risks “overriding” Los Angeles law.   \n \n4 \n  B.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Consistent  \n5      with the Spending Clause \n6    Plaintiff’s Count Five alleges that the challenge factors exceed federal power \n7  under the Spending Clause.10  As the Supreme Court has held, “Congress may \n8  attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds, and has repeatedly employed the \n9  power to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys \n10  upon compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and administrative \n11  directives.”  Dole, 483 U.S. at 206 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n12    The Court in Dole described certain limitations or potential limitations on the \n13  spending power.  Among other things, conditions on the receipt of federal funds \n14  must be stated “unambiguously” so that recipients can “exercise their choice \n      \n15  knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.”  Id. at 207.  Also, \n16  the Court observed, “our cases have suggested (without significant elaboration) that \n17  conditions on federal grants might be illegitimate if they are unrelated to the federal \n18  interest in particular national projects or programs.”  Id. at 207-08 (internal quota-\n19  tion marks omitted).  Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges that the challenged factors \n20  violate both of these aspects of Dole (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 124-125).  Although plaintiff now \n21                                                \n  10 Although the heading of Count Five also mentions the Tenth Amendment, \n22 \nit does not otherwise allege that the CHP factors violate that amendment (Doc. 1 at \n23  38-39).  In any event, such a claim would be without merit.  This case does not \ninvolve any direct federal mandate, but rather factors in the award or denial of a \n24 \ngrant that the City is free to accept or reject.  Moreover, the courts have rejected \n25  Tenth Amendment challenges to a number of federal statutes, including 8 U.S.C. § \n1373, that regulated the handling of information.  See City of New York v. United \n26 \nStates, 179 F.3d 29, 35 (2d Cir. 1999) (rejecting Tenth Amendment challenge to \n27  Section 1373); City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933 (N.D. Ill. 2017) \n(same); see also Reno v. Condon, 528 U.S. 141, 143-46, 149-150 (2000); Freilich v. \n28 \nUpper Chesapeake Health, Inc., 313 F.3d 205, 213-14 (4th Cir. 2002). \n       20\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 31 of 36   Page ID #:1742\n \n1  says it “does not intend to press” its allegation of ambiguity in light of post-\n2  Complaint developments (Doc. 49-1 at 20 n.6), plaintiff has not withdrawn that \n3  allegation.  In any event, assuming the challenged factors could be characterized as \n4  “conditions” at all, they satisfy these aspects of Dole.11  \n5      1.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Sufficiently Clear \n6    There is nothing “ambiguous” about the Illegal Immigration focus area or the \n7  access and notice factors, and applicants can choose those factors “knowingly, \n8  cognizant of the consequences of their [choices].”  Dole, 483 U.S. at 207.  In \n9  describing focus areas for potential applicants to choose from in FY 2017, the \n10  COPS Office provided brief examples of some specific activities an applicant could \n11  propose to perform in each area, but deliberately avoided telling applicants exactly \n12  what to do, so they could develop their own approaches and tactics based on local \n13  conditions and their local law enforcement expertise.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 8.  For example, \n14  in offering Drug Abuse as a potential focus area, the Office simply asked applicants \n      \n15  to “specify [their] focus on education, prevention, and intervention to combat drug \n16  use and abuse (e.g. marijuana, heroin, prescription opioids, etc.).”  Id.  Similarly, in \n17  giving potential applicants the option of focusing on Illegal Immigration, the Office \n18  asked interested jurisdictions to “specify [their] focus on partnering with federal \n19  law enforcement to combat illegal immigration through information sharing, 287(g) \n20  partnerships, task forces and honoring detainers.”  Id. ¶ 24.     \n21    In any event, to the extent the access and notice factors were unclear to Los \n22 \n                                              \n23    11 Contrary to plaintiff’s argument, the challenged factors cannot be \ncharacterized as “conditions” on the basis that an applicant unwilling to satisfy \n24 \nthem is “less likely” to receive a grant (contra Doc. 49-1 at 18-19).  As explained \n25  already, these factors are only a few among many factors used in selecting among \napplicants.  Indeed, choosing “Illegal Immigration” as a focus area in the FY 2017 \n26 \ncycle did not guarantee receipt of an award, and many jurisdictions that neither \n27  chose that focus area nor executed the access-and-notice certification were awarded \nfunds.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 33.  For the same reasons, the scoring factors cannot fairly be \n28 \ncalled “requirements” (contra Doc. 49-1 at 9, 12, 13, 19, 20 n.6). \n       21\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 32 of 36   Page ID #:1743\n \n1  Angeles (or any other jurisdiction), the COPS Office made clear that applicants \n2  were free to contact the Office with questions.  Id. ¶ 28.  The Office received \n3  numerous inquiries, some of which it referred to its Legal Division, but Los \n4  Angeles apparently did not inquire.  Id.  Plaintiff objects that state law requires \n5  informing detainees that they may refuse to meet with federal immigration \n6  authorities, and that it “cannot determine” how the access and notice factors would \n7  apply “in the context of short-term detention operations, like LAPD’s” (Doc. 1 \n8  ¶¶ 65-66).  As the Office has made clear in this filing – and as it would have made \n9  clear to Los Angeles had it asked these questions before – the Office does not \n10  understand these factors to forbid a jurisdiction from informing detainees, where \n11  required by law, that they may choose not to meet with immigration authorities, or \n12  to require that a jurisdiction notify DHS before the release of an alien under short-\n13  term detention whose release time is unknown.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 26.   \n \n14 \n           2.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Sufficiently  \n15        Related to the Purposes of the COPS Hiring Program \n16    Plaintiff also argues that the challenged factors are not “reasonably related” \n17  to the goals of the CHP (Doc. 49-1 at 18).  But this aspect of Dole suggests only a \n18  “possible ground” for invalidating an enactment, and does not impose an “exacting \n19  standard”: \n \n20 \nThe Supreme Court has suggested that federal grants conditioned on \n21  compliance with federal directives might be illegitimate if the \nconditions share no relationship to the federal interest in particular \n22 \nnational projects or programs.  This possible ground for invalidating a \n23  Spending Clause statute, which only suggests that the legislation might \nbe illegitimate without demonstrating a nexus between the conditions \n24 \nand a specified national interest, is a far cry from imposing an exacting \n25  standard for relatedness. \n26  Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir. 2002).  Thus, conditions \n27  on federal funding must only “bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal \n28  spending.”  Id.; see Barbour v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 374 F.3d \n       22\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 33 of 36   Page ID #:1744\n \n1  1161, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (noting that Supreme Court has never “overturned \n2  Spending Clause legislation on relatedness grounds”). \n3    The factors at issue here easily meet this standard (assuming they are \n4  “conditions” at all).  Congress established the CHP to promote “community-\n5  oriented policing,” 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2), “to increase police presence, to \n6  expand and improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and \n7  members of the community to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise \n8  to enhance public safety,” Pub. L. No. 103-322, Title I, § 10003(a), 108 Stat. 1808 \n9  (1994) (emphasis added).  Assisting in the enforcement of immigration law helps \n10  achieve these goals.  The COPS Office believes the intersection of illegal immigra-\n11  tion and crime is a serious public safety issue that can be helpfully addressed \n12  through “cooperative efforts” among federal, state, and local law enforcement.  \n13  Dorr Decl. ¶ 29.  Indeed, Congress codified this very principle in the INA.  See, \n14  e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g) (providing for formal agreements under which state and \n      \n15  local officers may function as federal immigration officers); see also id. § 1324(c) \n16  (authorizing state and local officers to make arrests for violations of the INA’s \n17  prohibition against smuggling aliens); id. § 1252c (authorizing state and local \n18  officers to arrest certain felons who have unlawfully returned to the United States).   \n19    The access and notice factors relate to aliens who are under detention and \n20  who have either committed crimes or are suspected of having committed crimes.  \n21  Dorr Decl. ¶ 29.  Cooperating with the Federal Government by providing basic \n22  information and access allows effective enforcement of federal immigration law \n23  against aliens who are criminals or suspected criminals and makes communities \n24  safer.  Id.  The factors at issue directly advance the purposes of the CHP.  They thus \n25  easily clear the low bar of bearing “some relationship” to those purposes.  See \n26  Mayweathers, 314 F.3d at 1067.   \n27 \n28 \n       23\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 34 of 36   Page ID #:1745\n \n1    C.  The Challenged Factors Are Consistent with the APA \n2    Plaintiff’s final claim, in Count Six, is that the decision to include the chal-\n3  lenged factors for FY 2017 was “arbitrary and capricious [and] not in accordance \n4  with law” in violation of the APA.  This claim is also without merit.  The Court of \n5  Appeals has “described the arbitrary and capricious standard as deferential and \n6  narrow, establishing a high threshold for setting aside agency action.”  Alaska Oil \n7  & Gas Ass’n v. Jewell, 815 F.3d 544, 554 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks \n8  omitted).  Under this standard, a court “presume[es] the agency action to be valid \n9  and affirm[s] the agency action if a reasonable basis exists for its decision.”  Indep. \n10  Acceptance Co. v. California, 204 F.3d 1247, 1251 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal \n11  quotation marks omitted).  The court has also held in numerous cases that “[a]n \n12  agency action is arbitrary and capricious only if the agency relied on factors \n13  Congress did not intend it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important \n14  aspect of the problem, or offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence \n      \n15  before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in \n16  view or the product of agency expertise.”  E.g., All. for the Wild Rockies v. Peña, \n17  865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This \n18  review is even more deferential where, as here, the question relates to the interpre-\n19  tation of a statute the defendants are responsible for administering, especially where \n20  gaps in the statute require the agency to exercise discretion.  See Wash. Dep’t of \n21  Ecology v. EPA, 752 F.2d 1465, 1469 (9th Cir. 1985) (“By leaving a gap in the \n22  statute, Congress implicitly has delegated policy-making authority to the agency.”). \n23    The challenged factors violate none of these parameters.   As detailed above, \n24  Congress established the CHP to promote public safety, cooperation among law \n25  enforcement agencies, and community-oriented policing, and thus intended DOJ to \n26  consider those aims in awarding grants.  Those goals are enhanced by facilitating \n27  federal access to aliens who have violated immigration law and who have violated, \n28  or are suspected of violating, state or local criminal laws.  Nothing in the statutes \n       24\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 35 of 36   Page ID #:1746\n \n1  governing CHP suggests DOJ should not consider the extent to which a jurisdiction \n2  cooperates in the enforcement of immigration law when exercising its discretion to \n3  disseminate scarce federal resources.  Thus, the scoring factors have more than a \n4  “reasonable basis” and easily satisfy the “deferential and narrow” APA standard.  \n5  Indep. Acceptance Co., 204 F.3d at 1251; Alaska Oil & Gas Ass’n, 815 F.3d at 554.  \n6  This is especially true given that the COPS Office must necessarily develop and \n7  apply means of choosing among applicants beyond those stated in the statute. \n8    In response, plaintiff argues that the challenged factors are arbitrary and \n9  capricious because defendants have not presented “tangible evidence” to support \n10  them (Doc. 49-1 at 21).  But the City misunderstands the nature of APA review.  As \n11  noted already, this standard is satisfied if there is a “reasonable basis” for the \n12  agency’s decision, and the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the challenged \n13  action is arbitrary and capricious, not on the defendants to disprove plaintiff’s \n14  claim.  See Pierce v. SEC, 786 F.3d 1027, 1035 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Quechan Tribe of \n      \n15  Ft. Yuma Indian Reservation v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 927 F. Supp. 2d 921, 928 \n16  (S.D. Cal. 2013), aff’d, 673 F. App’x 709 (9th Cir. 2016). \n17     Moreover, in an apparent attempt to satisfy its burden, Los Angeles asserts \n18  that certain “studies show an inverse relationship” between violent crime and a \n19  refusal to cooperate with federal immigration authorities (Doc. 49-1 at 22).  On this \n20  basis, plaintiff contends that “DOJ’s policy actually undermines public safety” (id. \n21  at 23).  But those assertions only reflect a “difference in view” with the Federal \n22  Government regarding how best to promote public safety.  See All. for the Wild \n23  Rockies, 865 F.3d at 1217.  Los Angeles is entitled to its views, but its disagree-\n24  ment does not establish a violation of the APA. \n25  CONCLUSION \n26    Accordingly, plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment should be \n27  denied, and judgment should be entered for the defendants on Counts Four, Five, \n28  and Six.   \n       25\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54   Filed 01/12/18   Page 36 of 36   Page ID #:1747\n \n1  Dated:  January 12, 2018 \n \n2 \n              Respectfully submitted, \n3   \n              CHAD A.

SESSIONS, III, et al.,   JUDGMENT AND IN OPPOSITION TO \n14 \n  PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL \n  \n15        Defendants.  SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \n   \n16 \n  1.  I am the Acting Deputy Director for the Grant Operations Directorate of the Office of \n17 \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services (“COPS Office” or “Office”) within the U.S. Department \n18 \nof Justice.  I am responsible for overseeing the development, awarding, and administration of the \n19 \nCOPS Hiring Program, as well as several other COPS Office grant programs.  In the course of my \n20 \nduties, I have become familiar with the procedures and practices of the COPS Office and with the \n21 \nfederal statutes related to the Office and its responsibilities.  Before taking my current position, \n22 \nI served as Assistant Director for the Grants Administration Division of the COPS Office and \n23 \nhave worked in the Division since 1998.  This declaration is based on personal knowledge and \n24 \nother information obtained by me in the performance of my official duties. \n25 \nOffice of Community Oriented Policing Services \n26 \n  2.  The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services was created in 1994 to develop \n27 \nand administer grant programs that promote community policing and to provide community \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 2 of 208   Page ID #:1749\n \n1  policing training and technical assistance to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.  The \n2  Office is headed by a Director appointed by the Attorney General.    \n3    3.  The COPS Office currently administers six grant programs:  the COPS Hiring \n4  Program, the Community Policing Development Program, the COPS Anti-Methamphetamine \n5  Program, the COPS Anti-Heroin Task Force Program, the Preparing for Active Shooter Situations \n6  Program, and the Tribal Resources Grant Program.  The operation of each of these programs is \n7  subject to specific annual appropriations by Congress.    \n8    4.  All of the COPS Office’s programs are discretionary, meaning that there is no \n9  entitlement to funding and all applicants must compete against each other for the available funds.  \n10  This is in contrast to a “formula grant” program such as the Byrne JAG program operated by a \n11  different component of the Department of Justice, in which, as I understand, when grants are \n12  made, all applicants who meet the requirements of the program receive funding based on a \n13  formula mandated by Congress, subject to any conditions the Department of Justice may impose \n14  in its discretion. \n      \n15  COPS Hiring Program in General \n16    5.  The COPS Office initially funded its hiring grant programs for large and small \n17  agencies in two separate programs, called COPS FAST: Funding Accelerated For Smaller Towns, \n18  and COPS AHEAD: Accelerated Hiring Education And Deployment.  In 1995, these programs \n19  were merged into one hiring program, the Universal Hiring Program (“UHP”), and, in 2010, this \n20  program was renamed the COPS Hiring Program (“CHP”).  Under CHP, the COPS Office makes \n21  discretionary grants to States, units of local government, Indian tribal governments, and \n22  sometimes other law enforcement agencies such as university police departments to hire or rehire \n23  law enforcement officers for deployment in community-oriented policing.  The statutory authority \n24  for this program is currently codified at Title 34, U.S. Code, Section 10381(b)(1) and (b)(2).  Like \n25  the COPS Office’s other programs, the operation of CHP is subject to specific annual \n26  appropriations by Congress. \n27 \n28 \n2\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 3 of 208   Page ID #:1750\n \n1    6.  Since the statute was enacted in 1994, the COPS Office has always understood that the \n2  other provisions currently listed at Title 34, U.S. Code, Section 10381(b) – that is, Section \n3  10381(b)(3) through (b)(22) – do not authorize the COPS Hiring Program, but set forth the \n4  purposes of other, separate grant programs that the Office could offer if Congress appropriated \n5  funds for them.  For example, the Office formerly operated a program called Making Officer \n6  Redeployment Effective (“MORE”) under the provision codified at Title 34, U.S. Code, Section \n7  10381(b)(3), which authorizes grants (if appropriated by Congress) “to procure equipment, \n8  technology, or support systems, or pay overtime, to increase the number of officers deployed in \n9  community-oriented policing.”  Because of a lack of appropriations, the COPS Office has never \n10  offered grants under most of the other provisions listed in Section 10381(b). \n11    7.  Under CHP, the COPS Office offers funding for hiring or rehiring law enforcement \n12  officers for deployment in “community-oriented policing,” which the Office defines as “a \n13  philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of partnerships \n14  and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to \n      \n15  public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime.”  Each year, the COPS \n16  Hiring Program prioritizes certain specific areas of public safety and community policing based \n17  on the Department of Justice’s law enforcement priorities.  For Fiscal Year 2017, CHP applicants \n18  could choose from among nine broad areas:  Child and Youth Safety Focus: School Based \n19  Policing; Illegal Immigration; Drug Abuse; Homeland Security Problems; Non-Violent Crime \n20  Problems and Quality-of-Life Policing; Building Trust and Respect; Traffic/Pedestrian Safety \n21  Problems; and Violent Crime Problems.  Whatever focus area an applicant chooses, the proposed \n22  program or initiative must incorporate the principles of community-oriented policing.   \n23    8.  Although the COPS Office provides brief examples of some specific activities an \n24  applicant could propose to perform in each focus area, the Office deliberately avoids telling \n25  applicants what to do in a given area, so that applicants can develop their own approaches and \n26  tactics based on local conditions and their local law enforcement expertise.  For example, on the \n27  FY 2017 application, a jurisdiction that proposed to focus on Drug Abuse was simply asked to \n28 \n3\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 4 of 208   Page ID #:1751\n \n1  “specify [its] focus on education, prevention, and intervention to combat drug use and abuse (e.g. \n2  marijuana, heroin, prescription opioids, etc.)”; a jurisdiction that proposed to focus on Building \n3  Trust and Respect was asked to “specify [its] focus on mutual respect and understanding between \n4  police and the communities they serve; for example, impartial policing, transparency fairness & \n5  respect, community engagement, diversity”; and a jurisdiction that proposed to focus on \n6  Homeland Security Problems was asked to choose either (1) “Protecting Critical Infrastructure \n7  Problems” and to “specify [its] critical infrastructure problem; for example, addressing threats \n8  against facilities, developing and testing incident response plans, etc.”; (2) “Information or \n9  Intelligence Problems” and to “specify [its] information and/or intelligence problem; for example, \n10  the need for criminal intelligence capacity, engaging in information sharing, expanding utilization \n11  of fusion centers, etc.”; or (3) “Other Homeland Security Problem (please specify).”   \n12    9.  The statute sets forth certain specific requirements for the COPS Hiring Program.  For \n13  example, Title 34, U.S. Code, Section 10381(f) requires the COPS Office to award at least 0.5% \n14  of the available funding to the grantees within any State that has eligible applicants (which helps \n      \n15  ensure that smaller States are not excluded from funding); Section 10381(g) requires each grantee \n16  to provide a portion of the funding for each law enforcement officer hired or rehired using CHP \n17  funds (that is, local matching funds), subject to discretionary waiver by the Attorney General; and \n18  Section 10381(h) requires allocating 50% of each year’s available funds to jurisdictions with a \n19  population over 150,000 and 50% of available funds to jurisdictions with a population less than \n20  150,000.   \n21  Application Process in General \n22    10.  A jurisdiction seeking a CHP grant fills out and submits an electronic application on \n23  the COPS Office web site.  A paper version of the FY 2017 application is Exhibit A to this \n24  declaration.  (This paper version accurately reflects the content of the electronic application, but \n25  not every applicant will see everything contained in the paper version.  What an applicant sees on \n26  the electronic application depends partly on which selections are made while completing it.)  The \n27  COPS Office establishes the application deadlines annually based on the timing of the federal \n28 \n4\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 5 of 208   Page ID #:1752\n \n1  budget approval.  The Office evaluates, scores, and ranks the applications as further described \n2  below, then announces all of the awards, usually by September 30 of each year, although it may \n3  announce beyond that date.  Each grantee has 90 days to accept its award, although the Office is \n4  willing to extend that period if an extension is necessary to obtain the required local approvals.  \n5    11.  The COPS Office’s announcement of CHP awards obligates all of the funding \n6  available at that time.  Occasionally, if additional funding for CHP grants becomes available \n7  thereafter, the Office makes a small number of additional awards later in the fiscal year.   \n8  Scoring Applications \n9    12.  Each year, the applications that the COPS Office receives for CHP grants seek more \n10  funds, in the aggregate, than Congress has appropriated for the year.  That competitiveness has \n11  increased since 1994, primarily because congressional appropriations have decreased.  CHP is the \n12  COPS Office’s most competitive grant program. \n13    13.  The following table shows, for each of the Fiscal Years 2010-2017, the amount of \n14  funding available for the COPS Hiring Program,1 the aggregate amount of funding requested and \n      \n15  the number of applications received, and the number of applications funded: \n16   \n17  Total Funding  Applications  Applications \nFiscal Year  Funding Available \nRequested  Received  Funded \n18 \n2010  $298,000,000  $2.2 billion  4,423  379 \n19 \n2011  $243,398,709  $2,067,924,397  2,712  238 \n20 \n2012  $114,806,304  $526,340,412  1,411  233 \n21 \n2013  $127,577,332  $974,007,306  1,718  266 \n22  2014  $123,882,021  $425,734,755  1,296  215 \n23  2015  $113,743,485  $376,582,744  1,103  209 \n24  2016  $119,309,470  $411,791,318  1,181  184 \n25 \n                                              \n26    1 The amount of funding available in each year is less than the amount stated in that year’s \nappropriations act, both because Congress passes funding for other programs as “carveouts” from \n27 \nthe CHP appropriation and because the COPS Office is required to deduct its administrative costs \nas a percentage from the appropriations for all of its programs. \n28 \n5\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 6 of 208   Page ID #:1753\n \n1 \n2017  $98,503,539  $409,028,743  1,142  179 \n2 \n \n3 \n  14.  The statutes that apply to the COPS Hiring Program do not prescribe a particular \n4 \nmethod for evaluating CHP applications or choosing which applications to fund.  Rather, the \n5 \nstatutes give the Office discretion to evaluate and score applications in order to determine how \n6 \nbest to allocate the Program’s finite funds every year.  The Office has consistently updated and \n7 \nmodified its scoring process over the years to emphasize different public safety priorities. \n8 \n  15.  The CHP application on the COPS Office web site (Exhibit A hereto) is part of an \n9 \nelectronic application system that assigns a specific number of points for each answer given by \n10 \nthe applicant.  The Office does not disclose the number of points assigned to any particular \n11 \nanswer, because disclosing the scoring system could skew the application process and subject that \n12 \nprocess to manipulation. \n13 \n  16.  Some of the factors that the COPS Office uses in scoring applications are reflected in \n14 \n       the statutes that apply to CHP.  For example, the statute states that applicants “shall” “demon-\n15 \nstrate a specific public safety need” and “explain the applicant's inability to address the need \n16 \nwithout Federal assistance” (Title 34, U.S. Code, Section 10382(c)(2) and (c)(3)).  The Office has \n17 \nimplemented this directive by requesting data reflecting each applicant’s crime statistics and \n18 \nfinancial need and by according extra points based on higher crime rates within a jurisdiction and \n19 \ncomparatively lower fiscal health of a jurisdiction as compared to each fiscal year’s pool of CHP \n20 \napplicants.  Similarly, the CHP application scores the quality of the applicant’s community \n21 \npolicing plan pursuant to the statutory requirement that applicants “explain how the grant will be \n22 \nutilized to reorient the affected law enforcement agency’s mission toward community-oriented \n23 \npolicing or enhance its involvement in or commitment to community-oriented policing” (Title 34, \n24 \nSection 10382(c)(10)).     \n25 \n  17.  In exercising the discretion the statute expressly confers, the COPS Office has never \n26 \ngiven preferential consideration (i.e., additional points) to applicants that provide more than the \n27 \nminimally required 25% local match for the costs of hiring and rehiring additional law \n28 \n6\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 7 of 208   Page ID #:1754\n \n1  enforcement officers (Title 34, U.S. Code, Section 10381(c)(1)), because the Office believes such \n2  a preference would unfairly favor wealthy jurisdictions that have the means to contribute more \n3  than less-wealthy jurisdictions in serious need of federal assistance.  \n4    18.  Many of the factors that the COPS Office uses to score applications are not expressly \n5  reflected in the statutes that apply to CHP, but are inherent in the Office’s statutory discretion to \n6  evaluate applications and distribute scarce funding.  For example, since FY 2011, the Office has \n7  decided each year what areas the COPS Hiring Program should prioritize, and the application \n8  system assigns extra points for applications that are focused on that year’s priority areas.  For FY \n9  2017, the focus areas included applications that explicitly prioritized addressing problems with \n10  violent crime; applications that focused on homeland security, such as protecting critical \n11  infrastructure; and applications that focused on contributing to the control of illegal immigration \n12  or cooperating with federal authorities in enforcing immigration law.  Beginning in FY 2014, \n13  after the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, \n14  the COPS Office added a “catastrophic event” question to the CHP application and assigned it the \n      \n15  highest level of bonus points to ensure that the Office could assist agencies experiencing such \n16  tragedies or disasters impacting law enforcement.  (The Office was unable to give the Newtown \n17  Police Department a CHP grant for FY 2013 because, without bonus points for a catastrophic \n18  event, the agency did not score high enough to receive an award.  Those bonus points resulted, for \n19  example, in a FY 2016 CHP grant to the San Bernardino (California) Police Department after the \n20  December 2015 terror attack in that city.)  Additionally, certain questions within the application \n21  that do not relate to focus areas are nonetheless awarded more points than other questions based \n22  on their significance to advancing community policing.  For example, the application system \n23  accords extra points for certain internal management practices of the applicant, including the \n24  regular assessment of employee satisfaction, the exercise of flexibility in officer shift assignments \n25  to facilitate addressing problems, and the operation of an “early intervention system” to identify \n26  officers showing signs of stress, personal problems, or questionable work conduct.   \n27 \n28 \n7\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 8 of 208   Page ID #:1755\n \n1    19.  From FY 2013 through FY 2016, the COPS Office, based on the Attorney General’s \n2  priorities, assigned additional points for jurisdictions that preferred military veterans in hiring \n3  officers with CHP funds, although no such preference was reflected in the statute.  Beginning \n4  with a congressional amendment made in 2017, the statute now expressly authorizes “prioritizing \n5  the hiring and training of veterans” (Section 10381(b)(2)). \n6    20.  Each individual factor on the CHP application falls into one of three categories:  \n7  Fiscal Health, Crime, or Community Policing.  Based on the Attorney General’s priorities and the \n8  needs of public safety, the COPS Office gives different amounts of weight to the applicants’ \n9  aggregate scores in each of these categories.  For most years, each applicant’s score in the Fiscal \n10  Health category is weighted as 20% of the applicant’s total final score; each applicant’s score in \n11  the Crime category is weighted as 30% of the applicant’s total final score; and each applicant’s \n12  score in the Community Policing category is weighted as 50% of the applicant’s total final score.  \n13  In FY 2009, however, in recognition of the national fiscal issues that also resulted in the passage \n14  of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Office accorded 50% of the \n      \n15  weighting to the “Fiscal Health” category.  (Unlike the number of points assigned for each \n16  individual factor on the application, the Office announces these weighting percentages to \n17  prospective applicants each year.)   \n18    21.  After reviewing each application for accuracy, the COPS Office calculates each \n19  applicant’s overall score based on the individual factors, then applies the weighting percentages \n20  described above.  The applications are then ranked against one another by weighted score.  Per \n21  statutory requirements, the COPS Office then awards 0.5% of the available funding to the \n22  highest-scoring applicants in each State and territory.  Because of the statutory requirement to \n23  award 50% of the CHP funding to jurisdictions serving populations over 150,000 and the \n24  remaining 50% to the smaller jurisdictions, the remaining applications are then divided into \n25  “large” and “small” populations (Title 34, U.S. Code, Section 10261(a)(11)(B)).  Awards are \n26  made based on the scores to the highest applicants in each category until the total available \n27  amount of CHP funding is exhausted. \n28 \n8\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 9 of 208   Page ID #:1756\n \n1    22.  No applicant has ever brought a judicial action challenging the COPS Office’s scoring \n2  process or the Office’s decision on a CHP grant application. \n3  Immigration-Related Factors and Their Effect in FY 2017 \n4    23.  CHP grantees, like all federal grantees, are required to comply with all applicable \n5  federal laws.  Beginning with FY 2016, the COPS Office has advised each CHP applicant that \n6  this requirement specifically includes compliance with Title 8, U.S. Code, Section 1373.  In FY \n7  2017, the COPS Office required a certification of compliance with Section 1373 as a threshold \n8  eligibility requirement.  Accordingly, all active FY 2017 CHP applications are from jurisdictions \n9  that certified compliance with Section 1373.  This certification is a threshold requirement for \n10  consideration, and there is no scoring associated with it. \n11    24.  As noted above, the COPS Hiring Program focus areas for FY 2017 included \n12  contributing to the control of illegal immigration or cooperating with federal authorities on \n13  enforcing immigration law (as well as addressing problems with violent crime and addressing \n14  homeland security, such as by protecting critical infrastructure).  The application asked any \n      \n15  jurisdiction choosing the Illegal Immigration focus area to “specify your focus on partnering with \n16  federal law enforcement to combat illegal immigration through information sharing, 287(g) \n17  partnerships, task forces and honoring detainers.”2  The application system assigned points for \n18  focusing on one of these areas, although the system gave more or an equal number of points for \n19  focusing on certain other areas.   \n20    25.  For the FY 2017 grant process, the COPS Office also offered applicants the oppor-\n21  tunity to receive additional points by certifying that the applicant had implemented or would \n22  implement regulations or policies (1) to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security \n23  (“DHS”) would have access to the applicant’s correctional or detention facilities “to meet with an \n24  alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be or to remain \n                                              \n25 \n2 Although a willingness to enter into an agreement under Section 287(g) of the \n26  Immigration and Nationality Act could accord a CHP applicant additional points in the scoring \nprocess, any funds awarded under a CHP grant would have to be used to hire or rehire officers \n27 \npursuant to the requirements of the Program, not for any state or local expenses of a 287(g) \nagreement. \n28 \n9\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 10 of 208   Page ID #:1757\n \n1  in the United States,” and (2) to ensure that the applicant’s correctional and detention facilities \n2  “provide advance notice as early as practicable (at least 48 hours, where possible) to DHS \n3  regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS \n4  requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien.” \n5    26.  The COPS Office does not understand this certification to forbid a certifying \n6  jurisdiction from informing detainees that they may choose not to meet with federal immigration \n7  authorities where the jurisdiction’s laws require providing that information.  The Office also does \n8  not understand this certification to require that a certifying jurisdiction notify DHS before the \n9  release of each non-U.S. citizen under short-term detention whose release time is unknown.  \n10  Rather, the Office understands this certification to mean that when DHS requests advance notice \n11  of a particular suspected non-citizen’s release, the jurisdiction will provide that notice to DHS as \n12  early as practicable before releasing the suspected non-citizen.  \n13     27.  To inform applicants regarding the opportunity to receive additional points based on \n14  these “access” and “notice” factors, the COPS Office electronically sent each applicant a letter, a \n      \n15  certification form, and background documents, which are Exhibit B to this declaration.  These \n16  materials stated, among other things, that the certification would not commit applicants to detain \n17  any individuals beyond their scheduled time of release, and that applicants would not be \n18  penalized if they did not operate detention facilities. \n19    28.  The letter regarding the access and notice factors stated that any applicant with \n20  questions regarding the certification could contact the COPS Office Response Center (i.e., \n21  customer service center) at its toll-free telephone number.  (The COPS Office web site also \n22  provides an email address for the Response Center.)  The COPS Response Center received 87 \n23  inquiries related to the certification process.  Some of those inquiries were referred to the COPS \n24  Office’s Legal Division, including questions regarding whether a particular jurisdiction’s \n25  detention facility qualified the applicant to submit the certification.  The Office has no record of \n26  any inquiries from the City of Los Angeles regarding FY 2017 CHP grants. \n27 \n28 \n10\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 11 of 208   Page ID #:1758\n \n1    29.  As described above, the COPS Hiring Program is meant to enhance public safety and \n2  community policing.  The COPS Office believes that illegal immigration enforcement is a public \n3  safety issue and that this issue can be addressed most effectively through the principles of \n4  community policing that CHP promotes – including through partnerships and problem-solving \n5  techniques.  Effective partnerships and problem-solving efforts may include not only DHS, but \n6  also the immigrant communities that law enforcement agencies protect and serve.  The “access” \n7  and “notice” factors in the certification relate to non-citizens who are being detained and who \n8  have committed crimes or are suspected of having committed crimes.  Working with the federal \n9  government to enforce the federal immigration laws against aliens who have committed crimes or \n10  are suspected of having committed crimes makes communities safer.  Nevertheless, the COPS \n11  Office has not yet determined the CHP focus areas for FY 2018, and no final decisions have been \n12  made regarding how immigration-related factors will be handled in the FY 2018 application. \n13    30.  The tables attached to this declaration as Exhibits C, D, E, and F show the effect of \n14  these immigration-related factors on the scoring and ranking of the FY 2017 applicants.  Exhibits \n      \n15  C and D show the rank order of large and small jurisdictions, respectively, based on each \n16  applicant’s selection of focus areas and all other scoring factors except whether the applicant \n17  returned the access-and-notice certification described above.  Exhibits E and F show the rank \n18  order of large and small jurisdictions, respectively, after application of the additional points \n19  attributable to whether an applicant returned the access-and-notice certification.  To protect the \n20  confidentiality of applicants – especially those that appear near the bottom of the lists – the names \n21  of most of the applicants have been replaced with numeric identifiers.3 \n22    31.  As reflected in Exhibits C and D, one large jurisdiction and six small jurisdictions \n23  chose Illegal Immigration as a focus area.  After applying the points attributable to choosing that \n24  focus area, the one large jurisdiction – Laredo, Texas – ranked thirty-ninth on the large-\n25  jurisdiction list, and the highest-ranked small jurisdiction ranked seventy-seventh on the small-\n26 \n                                              \n27 \n3 The applicants whose information is crossed out or highlighted in red withdrew their \napplications or were found ineligible for reasons unrelated to any immigration-related factors. \n28 \n11\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 12 of 208   Page ID #:1759\n \n1  jurisdiction list.  The City of Los Angeles, which chose “Building Trust and Respect” as its focus \n2  area, ranked thirty-sixth on the large-jurisdiction list.   \n3    32.  On Exhibits C and D, the blue highlighting marks the last applicant that would have \n4  been funded had there been no access-and-notice certification, except that several additional \n5  applicants below that point (marked as “Funded to Meet State Minimum Requirement” on the far \n6  right) also would have received funding because of the statutory requirement that the COPS \n7  Office award at least 0.5% of the available funding to the grantees within any State that has \n8  eligible applicants.  In other words, the large jurisdictions ranked 1 through 31 on Exhibit C \n9  would have been funded, and the small jurisdictions ranked 1 through 68 on Exhibit D would \n10  have been funded, along with some additional jurisdictions on both lists as marked.  Absent the \n11  access-and-notice certification, neither Los Angeles nor Laredo, Texas, would have been funded \n12  among the large jurisdictions, and none of the six small jurisdictions that chose Illegal \n13  Immigration as a focus area would have been funded. \n14    33.  Exhibits E and F show the final scores for FY 2017 – which include points for \n      \n15  returning the access-and-notice certification – and indicate which jurisdictions were awarded \n16  COPS grants last year.  On those Exhibits, the column labeled “ICC Certified” indicates whether \n17  each applicant returned the access-and-notice certification and received the points awarded for \n18  doing so.4  Approximately 39% of the large jurisdictions and approximately 47% of the small \n19  jurisdictions returned the certification. \n20    34.  The blue highlighting on Exhibits E and F marks the last applicant that received CHP \n21  funds based on all scoring factors, except that several additional applicants below that point \n22  (marked as “Funded to Meet State Minimum Requirement” on the far right) also received funding \n23  because of the 0.5% statutory requirement already described.  Thus, the large jurisdictions ranked \n24  1 through 29 on Exhibit E were funded and the small jurisdictions ranked 1 through 82 on Exhibit \n25  F were funded, along with some additional jurisdictions on both lists as marked.   \n26 \n                                              \n27 \n4 The COPS Office refers to this certification internally as the “Immigration Cooperation \nCertification,” hence the abbreviation “ICC.” \n28 \n12\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 13 of 208   Page ID #:1760\n \n1    35.  Of the 30 large jurisdictions that were funded, 19 returned the access-and-notice \n2  certification, and, of the 149 small jurisdictions that were funded, 124 returned the certification.  \n3  Returning the access-and-notice certification moved Laredo, Texas, from rank 39 on Exhibit C \n4  (below the funding line) to rank 18 on Exhibit E (above the funding line).  Returning the \n5  certification moved one of the six small jurisdictions that chose Illegal Immigration as a focus \n6  area (#856 on rank 72 of Exhibit F) from below the funding line on Exhibit D to above the \n7  funding line on Exhibit F.5  Numerous jurisdictions that neither chose the Illegal Immigration \n8  focus area nor executed the access-and-notice certification were awarded CHP funds. \n9  City of Los Angeles’s UHP/CHP Applications and Grants \n10    36.  The City of Los Angeles has applied for grants under the CHP or its predecessor \n11  program, the Universal Hiring Program, nine times – in Fiscal Years 1995, 1996, 1998, 2003, \n12  2009, 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2017.  The 2011 and 2017 applications were denied, and the rest \n13  were granted.   \n14    37.  Los Angeles’s CHP application for FY 2017 requested $3.125 million to support \n      \n15  hiring twenty-five officers for a Community Safety Partnership Program.  The City did not \n16  choose Illegal Immigration as a focus area; nor did it return the certification regarding the access \n17  and notice factors.  As described above, Los Angeles scored below the funding line even without \n18  regard to either of these immigration-related scoring components.  The COPS Office denied Los \n19  Angeles’s FY 2017 application on November 28, 2017. \n20    38.  The COPS Office has completed reviewing all of the CHP applications for FY 2017, \n21  and has awarded all of the available CHP funds.   \n22   \n23 \n                                              \n24 \n5 My prior declaration in this case, signed on October 12, 2017, stated that none of the \n25  applicants that chose Illegal Immigration as a focus area for FY 2017 scored high enough to \npermit further consideration, regardless of the access-and-notice factors.  The COPS Office \n26  realized, after my declaration was filed but before the awards were announced, that that statement \nwas partially incorrect. As described above, two jurisdictions that chose Illegal Immigration as a \n27 \nfocus area – one a small jurisdiction and one a large jurisdiction – received a CHP award because \nthey also returned the access-and-notice certification and therefore received additional points. \n28 \n13\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 14 of 208   Page ID #:1761\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 15 of 208   Page ID #:1762\nCOPS Office Application \nAttachment to SF-424 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 16 of 208   Page ID #:1763\nSection 1.

Enter the Fiscal Year Actual Sworn Force Strength for officers your agency currently has under contract for law \nenforcement services as of the date of this application. The actual number of sworn officer positions is the actual \nnumber of sworn officers under all current contracts as of the date of this application. Do not include funded but \ncurrently vacant positions or unpaid positions. \na. Number of officers deployed by your agency as of the date of this application: \nFull time    Part time   \nWhat is the actual population your department serves as the primary law enforcement entity? \n \nThis may or may not be the same as your census population. For example, a service population may be the census \npopulation minus incorporated towns and cities that have their own police departments within your geographic \nboundaries or estimates of ridership (e.g., transit police) or visitors (e.g., park police). An agency with primary law \nenforcement authority is defined as having first responder responsibility to calls for service for all types of criminal \nincidents within its jurisdiction. \nFor FY 2017, COPS Hiring Program (CHP) applicants are eligible to apply for the number of officers equal to 5 \npercent of their actual sworn force strength up to a maximum of 25 officers. Agencies with a sworn force of twenty \nor fewer officers may apply for one (1) officer position. Agencies with a service population of 1 million or above \nmay apply for up to 25 officer positions; however, agencies with a service population less than 1 million may apply \nfor up to 15 officer positions.  \nFY 2017 CHP grant funds cover 75 percent of the approved entry-level salary and fringe benefits of each newly-\nhired and/or rehired, full-time sworn career law enforcement officer for three years (36 months) up to $125,000 \nper officer position. CHP grant funding will be based on your agency's current entry level salaries and fringe \nbenefits for full-time sworn officers. \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 33 of 208   Page ID #:1780\n \nIf your agency requests officers to be deployed as School Resource Officers (SRO), all of the officer positions \nrequested below must be used to deploy full-time School Resource Officers. Do not request more officer \npositions than your agency can expect to deploy in this capacity. A School Resource Officer is a career law \nenforcement officer, with sworn authority, who is engaged in community policing activities and is assigned by the \nemploying agency to work in collaboration with schools. If awarded a grant for SRO position(s), please note that \nthe COPS Office requires that the officer(s) deployed into the SRO position(s) spend a minimum of 75 percent of \ntheir time in and around primary and secondary schools working on school and youth-related activities. \nThe placement of law enforcement officers in school carries a risk of contributing to a “school-to-prison pipeline” \nprocess where students are arrested or cited for minor, nonviolent behavioral violations and then diverted to the \njuvenile court system. This pipeline wastes community resources and can lead to academic failure and greater \nrecidivism rates for these students. If awarded, the grantee will agree that any officers deployed while \nimplementing School-based Policing under the COPS Hiring Program (CHP) grant cannot be involved in the \nadministrative discipline of the students. \nThere must be an increase in the level of community policing activities performed in and around primary or \nsecondary schools in the agency’s jurisdiction as a result of the grant. The time commitment of the funded officers \nmust be above and beyond the amount of time that the agency devoted to the schools before receiving the grant. \nGrantees using CHP funding to hire and/or deploy School Resource Officers into schools agree that a signed \nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the law enforcement agency and the school partner(s) must be \nsubmitted to the COPS Office before obligating or drawing down funds under this award. An MOU is not required \nat time of application; however, if the law enforcement agency already has an MOU in place that is applicable to \nthe partnership, the MOU can be submitted as an attachment in Section 13 of the grant application. The MOU \nmust contain the following; the purpose of the MOU, clearly defined roles and responsibilities of the school district \nand the law enforcement agency; focusing officers’ roles on safety, information sharing, supervision responsibility \nand chain of command for the SRO and signatures. If awarded, grantee will agree that the MOU must be submitted \nand accepted by the COPS Office 90 days from the award start date which is located on the Award Document. The \nimplementation of the COPS Hiring Program (CHP) grant without submission and acceptance of the required MOU \nwithin the 90 day timeframe may result in expenditures not being reimbursed by the COPS Office. \nIn addition, in section 6B you must select “School Based Policing through School Resource Officers” under “Child \nand Youth Safety Focus” as your focus area. \nIs your agency requesting that all of these officer positions be deployed as School Resource Officers (SROs)? \n Yes     No   \nBased on the information provided in this application: \nYour agency is eligible to apply for up to the number of officer position(s) shown below. \n \nHow many entry level, full-time officer positions is your agency requesting in this application? \n \n18 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 34 of 208   Page ID #:1781\n  Section 5A. COPS Hiring Program Officer Request \nIMPORTANT: If you later return to this section of the application and change the above number of officers you are \nrequesting, you must then go to Section 14A, Part 1 to allow the application to recalculate your budget figures. You \nwill also need to adjust your projection of your Federal/Local share costs in the chart located in Section 14A, Part3. \nFailure to do this will cause a conflict in your budget submission.  \nNext, your agency must allocate the number of positions requested under each of the three hiring categories \ndescribed below based on your agency's current needs at the time of this application. Please be mindful of the \ninitial three-year grant period and your agency's ability to fill and retain the officer positions awarded while \nfollowing your agency's established hiring policies and procedures. CHP grant awards will be made for officer \npositions requested in each of the three hiring categories, and grantees are required to use awarded funds for the \nspecific categories awarded. \nIt is imperative that your agency understand that the COPS Office statutory nonsupplanting requirement mandates \nthat grant funds may only be used to supplement (increase) a grantee's law enforcement budget for sworn officer \npositions and may not supplant (replace) state, local, or tribal funds that a grantee otherwise would have spent on \nofficer positions if it had not received a grant award. This means that if your agency plans to: \n(a)  Hire new officer positions (including filling existing vacancies that are no longer funded in your agency's \nbudget): It must hire these new additional positions on or after the official grant award start date, above \nits current budgeted (funded) level of sworn officer positions, and otherwise comply with the \nnonsupplanting requirement as described in detail in the Grant Owner’s Manual. \n(b)  Rehire officers who have been laid off by any jurisdiction as a result of state, local, or tribal budget cuts: \nIt must rehire the officers on or after the official grant award start date, maintain documentation showing \nthe date(s) that the positions were laid off and rehired, and otherwise comply with the nonsupplanting \nrequirement as described in detail in the Grant Owner’s Manual. \n(c)  Rehire officers who are (at the time of application) currently scheduled to be laid off (by your \njurisdiction) on a specific future date as a result of state, local, or tribal budget cuts: It must continue to \nfund the officers with its own funds from the grant award start date until the date of the scheduled layoff \n(for example, if the CHP award start date is September 1 and the layoffs are scheduled for November 1, \nthen the CHP funds may not be used to fund the officers until November 1, the date of the scheduled \nlayoff); identify the number and date(s) of the scheduled layoff(s) in this application(see below); maintain \ndocumentation showing the date(s) and reason(s) for the layoff; and otherwise comply with the \nnonsupplanting requirement as described in detail in the Grant Owner’s Manual. [Please note that as long \nas your agency can document the date that the layoff(s) would occur if CHP funds were not available, it \nmay transfer the officers to the CHP funding on or immediately after the date of the layoff without \nformally completing the administrative steps associated with a layoff for each individual officer.] \nDocumentation that may be used to prove that scheduled layoffs are occurring for local economic reasons that are \nunrelated to the availability of CHP grant funds may include (but are not limited to) council or departmental \nmeeting minutes, memoranda, notices, or orders discussing the lay-offs; notices provided to the individual officers \nregarding the date(s) of the lay-offs; and/or budget documents ordering departmental and/or jurisdiction-wide \nbudget cuts. These records must be maintained with your agency’s CHP grant records during the grant period and \nfor three years following the official closeout of the CHP grant in the event of an audit, monitoring, or other \nevaluation of your grant compliance. \n19 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 35 of 208   Page ID #:1782\n \nIf your agency's request is funded, your agency will have the opportunity after the award announcement to \nrequest a grant modification to move awarded funding into the category or categories that meet your agency's law \nenforcement needs at that time (including updating the dates of future scheduled layoffs). \nIf you need additional information regarding requesting a modification, please contact the COPS Office Response \nCenter at 800-421-6770. \nCategory A: New, additional officer positions (including filling existing vacancies no longer funded in your agency’s \nbudget). \nCategory A Request: <<insert>> \nCategory B: Rehire officers laid of nf (from any jurisdiction) as a result of state or local budget reductions. \nCategory B Request: <<insert>> \nCategory C: Rehire officers scheduled to be laid off (at the time of the application) on a specific future date as a \nresult of state or local budget reductions. \nCategory C Request: <<insert>> (total) \nWe also need some information about when the layoff of officers in this category is scheduled to occur.

Law Enforcement & Community \nPolicing Strategy \nCOPS Office grants must be used to reorient the mission and activities of law enforcement agencies through \ninitiating community policing or enhancing their involvement in community policing. If awarded funds, your \nresponses to this section will constitute your agency’s community policing strategy under this grant. Your \norganization may be audited or monitored to ensure that it is initiating or enhancing community policing in \naccordance with this strategy. The COPS Office may also use this information to understand the needs of the field \nand potentially provide for training, technical assistance, problem solving, and community policing implementation \ntools. \nWe understand that your community policing needs may change during the life of your grant (if awarded), and \nminor changes to this strategy may be made without prior approval from the COPS Office. We also recognize \nthat this strategy may incorporate a broad range of possible community policing strategies and activities and that \nyour agency may implement particular community policing approaches from the strategy on an as-needed basis \nthroughout the life of the grant. If your agency’s community policing strategy changes significantly, however, you \nmust submit those changes in writing to the COPS Office for approval. Changes are significant if they deviate from \nthe range of possible community policing activities identified and approved in this original community policing \nstrategy submitted with your application. \nCommunity policing definition framework \nThe following is the COPS Office definition of community policing, which emphasizes the primary components of \ncommunity partnerships, organizational transformation, and problem solving. \nCommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of \npartnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to \npublic safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime. \nThe COPS Office has completed the development of a comprehensive community policing self-assessment tool for \nuse by law enforcement agencies. Based on this work, we have developed the following list of primary \nsubelements of community policing. Please refer to the COPS Office website (www.cops.usdoj.gov) for further \ninformation regarding these subelements.   \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 39 of 208   Page ID #:1786\n \nCommunity Partnerships:  Organizational Transformation:  Problem Solving: \nCollaborative partnerships  The alignment of organizational  The process of engaging in the \nbetween the law enforcement  management, structure, personnel,  proactive and systematic \nagency and the individuals and  and information systems to support  examination of identified problems \norganizations they serve to both  community partnerships and  to develop effective responses that \ndevelop solutions to problems and  proactive problem-solving efforts  are rigorously evaluated \nincrease trust in police \n  Agency Management   \nOther government agencies  Climate and culture  Scanning: Identifying and \nCommunity members/groups  Leadership  prioritizing \nNonprofits/service providers  Labor relations  Analysis: Analyzing problems \nPrivate businesses  Decision making  Response: Responding to problems \nMedia  Strategic planning  Assessment: Assessing problem-\nPolicies  solving initiatives \nOrganizational evaluations  Using the crime triangle to focus on \nTransparency  immediate conditions \n(victim/offender/location) \n  Organizational Structure   \n  Geographic assignment of officers   \nDespecialization \nResources and finances \n  Personnel   \n  Recruitment, hiring, and selection   \nPersonnel supervision/evaluations \nTraining \n  Information Systems (Technology)   \n  Communication/access to data   \nQuality and accuracy of data \nProposed community policing strategy \nCOPS Office grants must be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities, either directly by your law \nenforcement agency, or (for non-law enforcement applicants) in collaboration with law enforcement.

Law Enforcement & Community Policing \nStrategy \nCommunity policing strategy \nCOPS Office grants must be used to reorient the mission and activities of law enforcement agencies through \ninitiating community policing or enhancing their involvement in community policing with the officers hired under \nthis grant program, or an equal number of veteran officers who have been redeployed to implement this plan after \nhiring the entry-level COPS-funded officers. If awarded funds, your responses to sections II(a) and II(b) that follow \nwill constitute your agency’s community policing strategy under this grant. Your organization may be audited or \nmonitored to ensure that it is initiating or enhancing community policing in accordance with this strategy. The \nCOPS Office may also use this information to understand the needs of the field, and potentially provide for \ntraining, technical assistance, problem solving and community policing implementation tools. Please note that the \nCOPS Office recognizes that your COPS-funded officer(s) (or an equal number of veteran officers who are \nredeployed after hiring the entry-level COPS-funded officers) will engage in a variety of community policing \nactivities and strategies, including participating in some or all aspects of your identified community policing \nstrategy. Your community policing strategy may be influenced and impacted by others within and outside of your \norganization; this is considered beneficial to your community policing efforts. \nAt any time during your grant, you should be prepared to demonstrate (1) the community policing activities \nengaged in prior to the grant award that are detailed in section I of this application and (2) how the grant funds \nand grant-funded officers (or an equal number of redeployed veteran officers) were specifically used to enhance \n(increase) or initiate community policing activities according to your community policing strategy contained in \nsections II(a) and II(b) of this application. \nFinally, we also understand that your community policing needs may change during the life of your grant. Minor \nchanges to this strategy may be made without prior approval of the COPS Office; however, grantees will be \nrequired to report on progress and/or changes to the community policing strategy (if any) through required \nprogress reports. If your agency’s community policing strategy changes significantly, you must submit those \nchanges to the COPS Office for approval. Changes are “significant” if they deviate from the specific crime \nproblems(s) originally identified and approved in the community policing strategy submitted with the application. \nIn some cases, changes to the approved community policing approaches may also be deemed significant and may \nrequire approval of a modified community policing strategy by the COPS Office, depending on the scope and \nnature of those changes as identified in the quarterly progress reports. \n   \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 51 of 208   Page ID #:1798\nCOPS Office Application   \nAttachment to SF-424   \nCommunity policing definition framework \nThe following is the COPS Office definition of community policing that emphasizes the primary components of \ncommunity partnerships, organizational transformation, and problem solving.

Budget Detail Worksheets \nInstructions for completing the budget detail worksheets \nThe following budget detail worksheets are designed to allow all COPS Office grant and cooperative agreement \napplicants to use the same budget forms to request funding. Allowable and unallowable costs vary widely and \ndepend upon the type of COPS Office program. The maximum federal funds that can be requested and the \nfederal/local share breakdown requirements also vary. \nPlease refer to the program-specific application guide to determine the allowable/unallowable costs, the \nmaximum amount of federal funds that can be requested, and the federal/local share requirements for the COPS \nOffice program for which your agency is applying. To assist you, sample budget detail worksheets are included in \neach application guide. \nPlease complete each section of the budget detail worksheets applicable to the program for which you are \napplying (see the program-specific application guide for requirements). If you are not requesting anything under a \nparticular budget category, please check the appropriate box in that category indicating that no positions or items \nare requested. \nAll calculations will be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Once the budget for your proposal has been \ncompleted, a budget summary page will reflect the total amounts requested in each category, the total project \ncosts, and the total federal and local shares. \nIf you need assistance completing the budget detail worksheets, please call the COPS Office Response Center at \n800-421-6770. \n1.

Applicants that do submit the Certification will receive \nadditional points in the application scoring process. \nWhat does the Certification commit applicants to do? \nThe Certification relates to state, local, and tribal law enforcement cooperation with the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security (DHS) by providing access to their correctional or detention facilities for the \npurpose of meeting with individuals believed or known to be aliens and to inquire about their right to be \nor remain in the United States.   \n \nThe Certification also relates to providing advance notice as early as practicable (at least 48 hours, where \npossible) to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien so that DHS may take custody \nof the alien. \n \nDoes the Certification commit applicants to hold (“detain”) an alien beyond the scheduled time of \nrelease? \nNo, it specifically states that this is not a requirement of the Certification.   \n \nHow many additional points will an applicant receive by submitting the Certification?  \nAs a matter of standard practice, the COPS Office does not release the exact number of points assigned to \nevery application question. \n \nWhat happens if jurisdictions do not operate their own detention facilities? \nApplicants will not be penalized if they do not operate detention facilities in their jurisdictions. This \napproach to priority consideration is consistent with other criteria where applicants are rewarded (Safe \nHarbor state applicants, for example).  \n \nWhy is the COPS Office adding this opportunity so late in the grant application process?  Haven’t \nthese application periods already closed? \nThe applications for these programs all noted that they might receive additional consideration for \ncooperation with federal law enforcement to address illegal immigration. \n \nWill this process delay making COPS grant awards this year? \nThe COPS Office plans to make its grant awards as soon as possible, ideally no later than October 31. \n \nWill applicants who are currently affected by Hurricane Harvey or possibly soon to be affected by \nHurricane Irma have additional time to complete the Certification? \nYes – any applicant that is either currently preparing for Hurricane Irma or recovering from Hurricane \nHarvey will receive an additional period of time to complete and submit the Certification. \n \n  \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-1   Filed 01/12/18   Page 132 of 208   Page ID\n #:1879\n \nCertification of Illegal Immigration Cooperation  \n \nOn behalf of the applicant entity named below, I certify under penalty of perjury to the Office of \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services, U.S. Department of Justice, that all of the following is true and \ncorrect: \n \n(1) As the Law Enforcement Executive or Government Executive for the applicant entity named \nbelow, I have the authority to make this certification on behalf of the applicant entity (that is, \nthe entity applying directly to the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services) and its \ngoverning body (i.e., city, county, or state).  \n \n \n(2) The applicant entity and/or its governing body has implemented or, before drawing down \ngrant funds if awarded, will implement rules, regulations, policies, and/or practices that \nensure that U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) personnel have access to any of \nthe governing body’s correctional or detention facilities in order to meet with an alien (or an \nindividual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be or to remain in the \nUnited States. \n \n \n(3) The applicant entity and/or its governing body has implemented or, before drawing down \ngrant funds if awarded, will implement rules, regulations, policies, and/or practices that \nensure that any of the governing body’s correctional and detention facilities provide advance \nnotice as early as practicable (at least 48 hours, where possible) to DHS regarding the \nscheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS requests \nsuch notice in order to take custody of the alien.  This certification does not require holding an \nalien beyond his or her scheduled time of release.  \n \n \n \nI acknowledge that a false statement in this certification, or in the application that it supports, may be the \nsubject of criminal prosecution (including under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001 and/or 1621, and/or 42 U.S.C. § \n3795), of administrative action, and/or of civil action in court.

STATEMENT OF FACTS \n \n23 \n  Date:   February 20, 2018  \n24    Time:   10:00 a.m. \n \n25 \n  Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56-1 and 56-2, defendants submit the following \n26 \nStatement of Uncontroverted Facts in support of their motion for partial summary \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-2   Filed 01/12/18   Page 2 of 8   Page ID #:1957\n \n1  judgment, and the following response to plaintiff’s Statement of Uncontroverted \n2  Facts (Doc. 49-2). \n3  Defendants’ Statement of Uncontroverted Facts \n4    1.  The Attorney General created the Office of Community Oriented Policing \n5  Services (“COPS Office” or “Office”) within the U.S. Department of Justice in \n6  1994 to administer grants under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement \n7  Act.  See Declaration of Andrew A. Dorr ¶ 2 (“Dorr Decl.”).   \n8    2.  The COPS Office began implementing 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1) and (b)(2) \n9  in 1994, initially as two programs.  The programs were combined in 1995, and it \n10  was renamed the COPS Hiring Program (“CHP” or “Program”) in 2010.  See Dorr \n11  Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.   \n12    3.  Under the CHP, the COPS Office makes grants to States, units of local \n13  government, and Indian tribal governments to hire, rehire, or train law enforcement \n14  officers for deployment in community-oriented policing.  See Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7.   \n      \n15    4.  The COPS Hiring Program is discretionary, meaning there is no \n16  entitlement to funding and all applicants must compete against each other for the \n17  available funds.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 4. \n18    5.  Operation of the CHP is subject to specific annual appropriations by \n19  Congress.  See Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.  Each year, the applications that the COPS Office \n20  receives for CHP grants seek significantly more funds, in the aggregate, than \n21  Congress has appropriated.  Id. ¶¶ 12-13. \n22    6.  The COPS Office has developed methods and factors to evaluate and \n23  score CHP applications in order to determine how to allocate the Program’s funds, \n24  and those scoring methods and factors change from time to time.  See Dorr Decl. \n25  ¶¶ 14-20.   \n26    7.  Each year, the COPS Office designates several broad areas of public \n27  safety and community policing to emphasize within the CHP, and CHP applicants \n28  must indicate which areas their proposed activities will support.  Since FY 2011, \n       2\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-2   Filed 01/12/18   Page 3 of 8   Page ID #:1958\n \n1  the Office has prioritized certain of those available areas, and applicants that select \n2  those focus areas receive extra points in the application system.  See Dorr Decl. \n3  ¶ 18.    \n4    8.  The CHP application system accords extra points for certain internal \n5  management practices of the applicant, including the regular assessment of \n6  employee satisfaction, the exercise of flexibility in officer shift assignments to \n7  facilitate addressing problems, and the operation of an “early intervention system” \n8  to identify officers showing signs of stress, personal problems, or questionable \n9  work conduct.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 18.   \n10    9.  From FY 2013 through FY 2016, the COPS Office assigned extra points \n11  for jurisdictions that preferred military veterans in hiring officers with CHP funds, \n12  although no such preference was reflected in the statute during that period.  See \n13  Dorr Decl. ¶ 19. \n14    10.  Each individual factor on the CHP application falls into one of three \n      \n15  categories:  Fiscal Health, Crime, or Community Policing.  After calculating each \n16  applicant’s raw scores, the COPS Office gives different weights to the applicant’s \n17  scores in each of these categories.  The Office changes those weighting percentages \n18  from time to time.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 20.   \n19    11.  Beginning with FY 2016, the COPS Office has advised each CHP \n20  applicant that the requirement for grantees to comply with all applicable federal \n21  laws includes compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373.  For FY 2017, the Office required \n22  applicants to certify compliance with Section 1373 as a threshold eligibility \n23  requirement, although there was no scoring associated with it.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 23.    \n24    12.  For FY 2017, the CHP application system assigned extra points to \n25  applicants that choose Illegal Immigration as a focus area, although the system also \n26  gave an equal or greater number of points for selecting other focus areas.  See Dorr \n27  Decl. ¶ 24.   \n28 \n       3\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-2   Filed 01/12/18   Page 4 of 8   Page ID #:1959\n \n1    13.  For FY 2017, the COPS Office offered applicants the opportunity to \n2  receive additional points by certifying that the applicant had implemented or would \n3  implement regulations or policies to ensure (1) that the Department of Homeland \n4  Security (“DHS”) would have access to the applicant’s correctional or detention \n5  facilities “to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and \n6  inquire as to his or her right to be or to remain in the United States,” and (2) that the \n7  applicant’s correctional and detention facilities would “provide advance notice as \n8  early as practicable (at least 48 hours, where possible) to DHS regarding the \n9  scheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS \n10  requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien.”  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 25.   \n11    14.  The materials informing applicants regarding the access-and-notice \n12  certifications for FY 2017 stated that the certification would not commit applicants \n13  to detain any individuals beyond their scheduled time of release, and that applicants \n14  would not be penalized if they did not operate detention facilities.  See Dorr Decl. \n      \n15  ¶ 27. \n16    15.  The COPS Office does not understand the access-and-notice certification \n17  for FY 2017 to forbid a certifying jurisdiction from informing detainees that they \n18  may choose not to meet with federal immigration authorities if the jurisdiction’s \n19  laws require providing that information.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 26.   \n20    16.  The COPS Office does not understand the access-and-notice certification \n21  for FY 2017 to require that a certifying jurisdiction notify DHS before the release \n22  of each alien under short-term detention whose release time is unknown.  See Dorr \n23  Decl. ¶ 26.   \n24    17.  One large jurisdiction and six small jurisdictions chose Illegal \n25  Immigration as the focus area of their FY 2017 applications.  None of those \n26  applicants scored high enough to receive CHP funding prior to the addition of any \n27  points attributable to the access-and-notice factors.  See Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 30-35 & Exs. \n28  C-E. \n       4\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-2   Filed 01/12/18   Page 5 of 8   Page ID #:1960\n \n1    18.  Of the 30 large jurisdictions whose FY 2017 CHP applications were \n2  funded, 19 returned the access-and-notice certification.  Of the 149 small juris-\n3  dictions whose FY 2017 CHP applications were funded, 124 returned the access-\n4  and-notice certification.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 35. \n5    19.  Returning the access-and-notice certification moved the one large \n6  jurisdiction that selected Illegal Immigration as its focus area, Laredo, Texas, from \n7  below the funding line to above the funding line for FY 2017.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 35. \n8    20.  Returning the access-and-notice certification moved one of the six small \n9  jurisdictions that selected Illegal Immigration as their focus area from below the \n10  funding line to above the funding line for FY 2017.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 35. \n11  Response to Plaintiff’s Statement of Uncontroverted Facts \n12    1.  This paragraph of plaintiff’s Statement is a summary of certain statutes.  \n13  Defendants respectfully refer the Court to the governing statutes for a full and \n14  accurate statement of their contents. \n      \n15    2-3.  Defendants concur in these paragraphs of plaintiff’s Statement.   \n16    4.  Defendants dispute the accuracy of the word “generally” in this \n17  paragraph, given that the funds appropriated by Congress have always been \n18  insufficient to fund all of the CHP applications.  See Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 13-14.  \n19  Defendants also dispute any implication that the weighting described in this \n20  paragraph is the only method or factor by which the COPS Office determines which \n21  applicants receive the limited CHP funding.  Id. ¶¶ 16-20.  Defendants concur in the \n22  remainder of this paragraph. \n23    5.  Defendants dispute the accuracy of the word “generally” in this \n24  paragraph, given that the COPS Office always allocates differing numbers of points \n25  based on a variety of factors.  See Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 16-20.  Defendants concur in the \n26  remainder of this paragraph. \n27 \n28 \n       5\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-2   Filed 01/12/18   Page 6 of 8   Page ID #:1961\n \n1    6.  Defendants dispute any implication that the scoring system has provided \n2  extra points for catastrophic events only “in prior years.”  That was also done in FY \n3  2017.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 18. \n4    7.  This paragraph of plaintiff’s Statement is a summary of certain statutes.  \n5  Defendants respectfully refer the Court to the governing statutes for a full and \n6  accurate statement of their contents. \n7    8.  Defendants concur in this paragraph of plaintiff’s Statement.   \n8    7.  Defendants concur in this paragraph of plaintiff’s Statement.1 \n9    8.  Defendants dispute any implication that this paragraph sets forth in full \n10  the COPS Office’s description of the Illegal Immigration focus area for FY 2017.  \n11  The application asked any jurisdiction choosing this focus area to “specify your \n12  focus on partnering with federal law enforcement to combat illegal immigration \n13  through information sharing, 287(g) partnerships, task forces and honoring \n14  detainers.”  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 24.  Defendants concur in the remainder of this \n      \n15  paragraph.2 \n16    9.  Defendants dispute any implication that the 2017 CHP Application Guide \n17  failed to provide needed guidance for potential applicants.  The COPS Office \n18  deliberately avoids telling applicants what to do in a given area, so that applicants \n19  can develop their own approaches and tactics based on local conditions and their \n20  local law enforcement expertise.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 8.  Defendants concur in the \n21  remainder of this paragraph. \n22    10-15.  Defendants concur in these paragraphs of plaintiff’s Statement.   \n23    16.  Defendants dispute any implication that Los Angeles has received CHP \n24  funding each time it has applied.  The City also submitted CHP applications in \n25 \n                                              \n26 \n  1 This is the second paragraph 7 in plaintiff’s Statement, beginning with the \n27  words “In the fiscal year.” \n  2 This is the second paragraph 8 in plaintiff’s Statement, beginning with the \n28 \nwords “The Office described.” \n       6\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-2   Filed 01/12/18   Page 7 of 8   Page ID #:1962\n \n1  2011 and 2017, both of which were denied.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 36.  Defendants \n2  concur in the remainder of this paragraph. \n3    17.  Defendants dispute plaintiff’s reading of the document cited in this \n4  paragraph.  In FY 2016, Los Angeles was the fourteenth highest scoring applicant \n5  out of 1,181 large and small jurisdictions.  See Larracas Decl. Ex. D (FY 2016 \n6  COPS Hiring Program Applicant Rankings).  More materially, however, Los \n7  Angeles ranked eighth out of the 106 large applicants in FY 2016.  Id.  \n8      18-19.  Defendants concur in these paragraphs of plaintiff’s Statement.   \n9    20.  Defendants concur that this paragraph accurately reflects plaintiff’s \n10  description of its Community Safety Partnership program. \n11    21.  Defendants concur in this paragraph of plaintiff’s Statement.   \n12    22.  Defendants dispute any implication that an applicant must create a new \n13  “program” to select Illegal Immigration as a focus area.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 24.  \n14  Defendants concur in the remainder of this paragraph. \n      \n15    23.  Defendants concur that this paragraph accurately reflects plaintiff’s \n16  beliefs. \n17    24.  Defendants concur that this paragraph accurately reflects plaintiff’s \n18  policy.  Defendants dispute any implication, however, that choosing Illegal \n19  Immigration as a focus area or returning the access-and-notice certification would \n20  require Los Angeles to violate the policy described.  See Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 24-27.   \n21    25.  Defendants concur in the first sentence of this paragraph.  Defendants \n22  dispute the second sentence, given that contacting the COPS Office Response \n23  Center would have enabled the plaintiff to determine “whether DOJ would consider \n24  its detention facility policies and practices to comply with the Access and Notice \n25  Requirements.”  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 28.   \n26    26.  Defendants concur in this paragraph of plaintiff’s Statement.   \n27 \n28 \n       7\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 54-2   Filed 01/12/18   Page 8 of 8   Page ID #:1963\n \n1    27.  Defendants are unable to determine the basis for this paragraph based on \n2  plaintiff’s citation.  In any event, the paragraph is incorrect under the present \n3  circumstances.  See Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 30-35 & Exs. C-E.  \n4    28.  Defendants concur in this paragraph of plaintiff’s Statement.   \n5  Dated:  January 12, 2018 \n \n6 \n              Respectfully submitted, \n7   \n              CHAD A.

The \nCity likewise does not contest that the Department may prioritize certain policy areas \nof particular importance to the federal government through, for example, the use of \nfocus areas.  And the City, like the Department, recognizes that scoring factors \ninvolving immigration enforcement are permissible so long as they are related to the \npurposes of the grant program at issue in this case. \nThus, despite the City’s heated rhetoric, this case reduces to one question: \nwhether the immigration-related scoring factors used in the fiscal year 2017 \napplication for COPS Hiring Program (CHP) grants—which are optional for the \napplicant and are two of many factors used to score applications—are sufficiently \nrelated to community-oriented policing.  In contending that they are not, Los Angeles \nrelies on an unduly narrow conception of community-oriented policing and a cramped \nreading of the CHP’s authorizing statute.  Rewarding jurisdictions that assist in \neffective enforcement of the immigration laws against aliens who have no lawful right \nto be present in their community—particularly aliens who present a risk of recidivism \nagainst the law-abiding community because they are in local criminal custody—falls \nwell within the Department’s broad discretion to select recipients of competitive \nfederal grants supporting community-oriented policing.  \n \n\nFirst, Los Angeles misunderstands the meaning of community-oriented \npolicing.  In the City’s view, community-oriented policing occurs only when there is a \ndirect interaction between a law enforcement officer and a community member.  Yet \ncommunity-oriented policing is far broader; it represents a comprehensive philosophy \nof policing that affects all aspects of a law enforcement agency’s efforts by focusing \non preventing rather than reacting to crime through engagement with the community.  \nThus, community-oriented policing includes not only direct police-community \ninteractions, but also action by law enforcement officials made possible by, and \ninformed by, cooperation with local residents.  The City is thus quite wrong to declare \nthat immigration enforcement efforts could not “implement community policing \nstrategies,” LA Br. 39, just as the arrest of drug dealers and the conduct of anti-drug \noperations may be the fruit of community policing strategies.  Nor can the City \nexplain why a focus on illegal immigration is less susceptible to community-oriented \npolicing than a focus on “addressing threats against facilities” or developing “criminal \nintelligence capacity,” ER 19, ¶ 8, which, as the City does not dispute, are specifically \ncontemplated by the broad authorizations of the governing statute, see 34 U.S.C. \n§ 10381(b)(4). \nSecond, localities can and do play a role in assisting the federal government \nwith enforcement of the immigration laws through programs like Section 287(g) \nagreements.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g).  Los Angeles presents no reason why localities, in \nthe course of exercising those law enforcement duties, cannot employ the same \n2 \n \n\ncommunity-oriented policing strategies that they employ for addressing a host of \nother public safety concerns.  That immigration proceedings are civil in nature is \nimmaterial; whether the goals of community-oriented policing are achieved through \ncivil rather than criminal proceedings has no bearing on the fundamental nature of a \ncommunity-oriented policing program.  Indeed, the fact that localities choose to \nparticipate in immigration enforcement efforts is itself a powerful indication that they \nview those efforts as beneficial for addressing public safety concerns in their own \ncommunities, which makes particular sense with respect to enforcement against aliens \nwhom the localities themselves arrested for criminal conduct and thus would pose a \nthreat of recidivism if released back into the community. \nThe City’s arguments with respect to the points awarded for providing a basic \nlevel of cooperation with federal immigration officials seeking to detain and remove \ncriminal aliens are equally wide of the mark.  Indeed, the City’s objection to the Illegal \nImmigration focus area as civil in nature does not even apply by its terms to the \nbonus points, which relate only to cooperation with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity regarding aliens held in local criminal custody.  In determining which \njurisdictions should receive competitive grants to further community-oriented \npolicing, it is well within the Department of Justice’s discretion to prefer jurisdictions \nthat are assisting federal efforts to enforce the immigration laws against removable \naliens held in local criminal custody rather than undermining those efforts by \nreturning those individuals to the community where they pose a threat of recidivism, \n3 \n \n\nthe incidence of which in turn undermines community confidence in, and \nrelationships with, local law enforcement.  This modest form of encouragement in no \nway suggests that Congress issued “a blank check,” LA Br. 3, in scoring grants.  To \nthe contrary, Congress specifically authorized the Department to reward applications \nthat “identify related governmental and community initiatives which complement or \nwill be coordinated” with a proposal for community-oriented policing funds.  34 \nU.S.C. § 10382(c)(4).  Ensuring that criminal aliens are removed from the country \nrather than returned to the community to recidivate obviously complements \ncommunity-oriented policing efforts, especially given that a jurisdiction’s choice to \nassist in such immigration enforcement presumably reflects the wishes of its \ncommunity.  Indeed, Los Angeles concedes that the Department “has considerable \ndiscretion” in “reasonably determin[ing]” whether a competitive grant application \nfurthers the purposes of community-oriented policing, LA Br. 24, and that is precisely \nwhat the Department has done, notwithstanding the City’s disagreement as a policy \nmatter, see LA Br. 14.         \nThe City’s arguments with respect to the Spending Clause and the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) restate its contention that the Department lacks \nstatutory authority to include the two provisions for obtaining additional points.  Los \nAngeles does not suggest that the provisions violate the Spending Clause if they are \nauthorized by statute.  The only question is whether the Department exercised powers \nconferred by statute, which it did. \n4 \n \n\n  Similarly, the City’s arguments regarding the APA add nothing to its statutory \nargument, as Los Angeles largely repeats its assertions that immigration enforcement \nand community-oriented policing are incompatible.  These assertions at bottom \nreflect only policy differences with the federal government.  The City is free to select a \ndifferent focus area.  But its view of the best policy furnishes no basis for precluding \nother jurisdictions with a different view from choosing illegal immigration as a focus \nfor community-oriented policing.  Similarly, the Department’s judgment that \njurisdictions seeking cooperative law enforcement funds should be rewarded for \naiding, rather than undermining, federal law enforcement efforts is a policy \ndetermination which Los Angeles cannot second-guess through an APA action. \nARGUMENT \n  The Department Acted Well Within Its Authority In Offering \nApplicants Two Additional Means To Obtain Extra Points In The \nScoring Of Competitive Proposals For Discretionary CHP Grants \nA.      The City Offers No Basis for Concluding That Including \nIllegal Immigration as a Focus Area Is Facially Invalid. \n 1.  Los Angeles does not dispute that in administering a discretionary grant \nprogram, the Department of Justice may prioritize certain policy areas of particular \nimportance through the use of focus areas.  Its brief provides no basis for concluding \nthat a focus on community-oriented policing designed to address illegal immigration is \nin any respect outside the Department’s statutory authority.  And it provides no \nprincipled basis for distinguishing this focus area from any of the various others that \n5 \n \n\nthe Department’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) has \nincluded throughout the history of these grants. \nImmigration, like any number of other law enforcement and public safety \nconcerns, is a potential subject for community-oriented policing.  As the City itself \nrecognizes, see LA Br. 5 & n.2, the COPS statute explains that the purpose of \ncommunity-oriented policing is to orient policing towards preventing rather than \nreacting to crime through engagement with the community.  Violent Crime Control & \nLaw Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, tit. I, § 10002, 108 Stat. 1796, \n1807.  Likewise, the COPS Office has defined community-oriented policing as a \nphilosophy of policing that embraces “the systematic use of partnerships and \nproblem-solving techniques to proactively address the immediate conditions that give \nrise to public safety issues” across a wide range of areas.  ER 53.  Rather than \nnarrowly focusing on a single area, police departments who have adopted the \nphilosophy of community-oriented policing employ officers who can “handle multiple \nresponsibilities and take a team approach to collaborative problem solving.”  Office of \nCmty. Oriented Policing Servs., U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Community Policing Defined 7 (rev. \n2014).1  The philosophy also envisions entering into partnerships and sharing \ninformation with a host of entities, including government agencies.  Id. at 2, 9.  The \n                                                 \n1 https://go.usa.gov/xUXdk \n6 \n \n\nphilosophy thus supports engaging with immigration-focused federal agencies and \nsharing relevant information. \nThe Illegal Immigration focus area offers localities the opportunity to design \nplans that put this philosophy to work in the context of illegal immigration.  The City \nidentifies no basis for concluding that partnerships and problem-solving techniques \ncannot be used to proactively address illegal immigration as they are used in \naddressing other areas of law enforcement concern.  \nThe City does not and cannot contend that illegal immigration is not a proper \nfocus of community-oriented policing merely because it is a matter of national as well \nas local concern, just like other aspects of homeland security.  Los Angeles \nacknowledges, as it must, that “Congress specifically recognize[d] the role community \npolicing can play in homeland security,” LA Br. 49, by explicitly providing that grants \nfor “community-oriented policing,” 34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(10), are properly used to \nfacilitate deployment of officers in “intelligence, anti-terror, or homeland security \nduties,” id. § 10381(b)(4).2 \nThe City nevertheless argues that immigration—unlike any other area relating \nto homeland security—is not an area legitimately addressed in community-oriented \npolicing efforts.  And, because this is a facial challenge, the City necessarily casts its \n                                                 \n2 The functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, previously part \nof the Department of Justice, were transferred to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity upon its creation.  See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, \n§§ 402(3), 441, 116 Stat. 2178, 2192. \n7 \n \n\nargument in absolute terms, asserting that illegal immigration categorically cannot be a \nsubject of community-oriented policing.  Los Angeles offers three principal and \nequally unpersuasive arguments in support of this position.  \nFirst, the City advances an untenably narrow notion of community-oriented \npolicing as only the continuous and direct interaction between a law enforcement \nofficer and a community member.  Under this theory, whenever direct interaction \nceases, so does community-oriented policing. See LA Br. 38; see also id. at 42.  That is, \nof course, not the case, and the City cannot provide a single citation in support of this \nnotion.  The philosophy of community-oriented policing does not anticipate that law \nenforcement officers will fail to act on the fruits of the cooperative efforts.  Nor does \nit require that a locality deputize community members so that they can take part in \nraids or arrests. \nThere is thus absolutely no basis for the City’s assertion that an immigration \nenforcement effort could not “implement community policing strategies.”  LA Br. 39.  \nAnalogously, a police force might work with the community to identify the sources of \ndrug-related crime and to determine which gangs or drug dealers are at the root of the \nproblem.  Officers might then consult with members of the community to determine \nhow enforcement efforts might be most effective and least disruptive.  But when the \npolice ultimately conduct a targeted raid, they presumably will not involve community \nmembers in the operation.  Similarly, an operation to enforce the immigration laws \n8 \n \n\nmight be made possible by, and its implementation informed by, community input, \nbut community members would not participate in the operation itself. \nSecond, Los Angeles contends that illegal immigration is a civil rather than a \ncriminal matter, and that it therefore cannot be a subject of community-oriented \npolicing.  See LA Br. 42.  This misses the point.  The relevant question is whether an \napplicant can demonstrate that its plan incorporates the principles of community-\noriented policing, not whether the result of community-oriented policing efforts is \ncriminal prosecution.  Indeed, the very root of community oriented policing is the \nnotion that local law enforcement will be involved in more than reactive crime \nfighting—it will be involved throughout the community, through many partnerships, \nin an effort to build relationships and prevent crime.  For example, no one—not even \nLos Angeles—questions that community-oriented policing may properly be used to \naddress “Traffic/Pedestrian Safety Problems,” another focus area in the fiscal year \n2017 CHP, without regard for whether issues such as “traffic congestion” are criminal \nor civil in nature.  See ER 73-74.  Community-oriented policing can be used to resolve \nboth criminal and civil issues that are of concern to a local community and police \nforce.  This is especially true where, as here, civil enforcement has a direct relationship \nto crime, given that illegal immigration and local crime are overlapping and integrated \nconcerns in many communities.  See Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 397-98 \n(2012).  That connection is particularly apparent with respect to those aliens a \njurisdiction has already taken into custody for its own criminal law enforcement \n9 \n \n\npurposes.  A comprehensive approach that uses all available tools to combat criminal \nconduct in a community is entirely consistent with basic principles of community-\noriented policing. \nThird, Los Angeles advances the equally unfounded contention that the \nauthorizing statute by its terms forecloses the use of community-oriented policing to \naddress concerns stemming from illegal immigration.  The City notes that immigration \nis not specifically mentioned in the statute, LA Br. 42-43, but it does not seriously \ncontend that concerns relating to illegal immigration therefore cannot be the subject \nof a grant proposal.  The statute does not and need not enumerate every area that may \nbe of concern to a community and may also be an area of particular concern to \nnational law enforcement.  Los Angeles presumably does not believe that the absence \nof a specific reference to drugs in the community (a fiscal year 2017 focus area, see ER \n71), or to addressing issues faced by “children exposed to violence” (a subarea of the \nfiscal year 2017 “Child and Youth Safety” focus area, see ER 70-71), means that \nCongress did not intend that grant funds be expended on such projects. \nIn making this textual argument, Los Angeles is also obliged to read illegal \nimmigration out of the areas encompassed by “homeland security,” which Congress \nspecified as an area appropriate for community-oriented policing.  Los Angeles \ncannot, of course, suggest that immigration is not a homeland security issue.  Instead, \nit asserts that the Congress implicitly narrowed the normal understanding of \n“homeland security” because the statute refers to hiring officers “to perform \n10 \n \n\nintelligence, anti-terror, or homeland security duties.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(4).  See \nLA Br. 46-47.  Because “homeland security” is preceded by “intelligence” and “anti-\nterror,” the City reasons, homeland security is a proper subject of community-\noriented policing only insofar as it relates to intelligence and anti-terrorism activities.   \nLos Angeles does not explain how the area of “homeland security,” which is \nreferred to in the disjunctive, can properly be read out of the statute in this manner.  \nThe City seeks to justify this excision on the ground that the Department’s website \ndoes not provide an exhaustive list of the ways community-oriented policing can be \nused to address homeland security concerns.  See LA Br. 43-44.  But the City does not \nexplain how the specificity of the Department’s website can be used to alter the text \nof the statute, particularly in the context of this facial challenge.  In any event, the \nlevel of detail on the Department’s website at a particular time and the fact that the \nIllegal Immigration focus area was introduced in fiscal year 2017 are of no apparent \nrelevance to the City’s statutory argument. \n2.  Los Angeles also advances a narrower version of its facial challenge \naddressed only to the text of the fiscal year 2017 CHP application, asserting that it \nreferences activities that do not involve community-oriented policing.  LA Br. 37-39.  \nThis argument, too, fails.  The Illegal Immigration focus area asked applicants to \n“specify your focus on partnering with federal law enforcement to combat illegal \nimmigration through information sharing, 287(g) partnerships, task forces and \nhonoring detainers.”  ER 24.  Los Angeles does not even attempt to explain why \n11 \n \n\n“information sharing” or “task forces” cannot employ community-oriented policing \nstrategies.  Information sharing is far more effective when there are strong \nrelationships between local police and the community.  Similarly, task forces can make \ntheir efforts more effective by engaging with the community to target their activities \nand increase public trust.  Presumably Los Angeles does not believe that an applicant \nin the “Child and Youth Safety” focus area that intended to create a task force to \ncombat the influence of gangs among local youths, see ER 71, should be barred from \nreceiving funds on the theory that its activities do not involve community-oriented \npolicing.  The City provides no reason to believe that a different result should obtain \nbecause the subject matter is illegal immigration rather than gangs. \nThe City’s objection to the application’s mention of “287(g) partnerships,” ER \n70, fails for similar reasons.  These agreements, authorized by Section 287(g) of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, permit local law enforcement officers to “perform a \nfunction of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or \ndetention of aliens in the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1).  The City does not \ncontest that community-oriented policing strategies may be used by law enforcement \nagencies engaged in investigating crimes or apprehending criminal offenders.  There is \nno reason to presume that, when a law enforcement officer is performing those same \nfunctions under a Section 287(g) agreement, the same community-oriented policing \ntechniques cannot be employed.  A local law enforcement officer does not stop \nengaging with the community or enforcing local law when participating in a Section \n12 \n \n\n287(g) agreement, and part of the value of a Section 287(g) agreement is that it \nempowers local law enforcement officers to address a broader range of issues they \nencounter in their communities.  Nothing about a Section 287(g) agreement precludes \nthe application of community-oriented policing principles.  That jurisdictions choose \nto engage in these agreements indicates their desire to encourage immigration \nenforcement in their communities, even if Los Angeles does not share that desire. \nThe City contends that providing grant funds to an applicant that participates \nin a Section 287(g) agreement contravenes Congress’s intent that such agreements are \ncarried out “at the expense of the State or political subdivision.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1357(g)(1); see LA Br. 39-40.  The City misunderstands the statute.  Section 287(g) \ndoes not preclude the federal government from subsidizing participation in efforts \nundertaken pursuant to Section 287(g).  The statute simply makes clear that states and \nlocalities may not demand reimbursement for expenses associated with their \nparticipation.  A contrary reading would lead to absurd results.  For example, if a \njurisdiction used Department grant funds to purchase police equipment (e.g., radios), \npolice officers would have to avoid using that equipment when engaged in efforts \nundertaken pursuant to Section 287(g).  Further, the fact that jurisdictions are willing \nto expend their own funds under such agreements only underscores that many \njurisdictions view combating illegal immigration as having beneficial effects on other \nlaw enforcement and public safety concerns in their communities. \n13 \n \n\nLos Angeles also suggests that the application’s reference to “honoring \ndetainers” is inappropriate.  LA Br. 38-39.  Detainers, like the other activities listed on \nthe application, operate at the intersection of federal immigration enforcement and \nlocal criminal enforcement.  An immigration detainer is a device that “serves to advise \nanother law enforcement agency that [the Department of Homeland Security] seeks \ncustody of an alien presently in the custody of that agency, for the purpose of \narresting and removing the alien.”  8 C.F.R. § 287.7(a).  Cooperation with detainers \nmay therefore serve the broader public safety goals identified by a jurisdiction’s \ncommunity-oriented policing proposal, including by ensuring that individuals already \nheld in criminal custody and subject to removal do not reoffend in the community \nafter their release. \nLos Angeles underscores the error of its analysis by largely ignoring the \nDepartment’s statutory authority to consider whether an application “identif[ies] \nrelated governmental and community initiatives which complement or will be \ncoordinated” with a proposal for community-oriented policing funds.  34 U.S.C. \n§ 10382(c)(4).  As this provision makes clear, once an applicant demonstrates that its \nproposal incorporates the principles of community-oriented policing, the Department \nmay accord weight to applications demonstrating that a jurisdiction’s community-\noriented policing efforts will complement other law enforcement initiatives, including \nfederal efforts to enforce the immigration laws.  Thus, even if the City were correct \nthat some of the referenced activities are not themselves part of community-oriented \n14 \n \n\npolicing, they are valid as complementary policies.  For example, a jurisdiction’s \ndecision to cooperate with detainer requests would further its broader community \npolicing efforts in the Illegal Immigration focus area by ensuring that, once a \njurisdiction has taken a removable alien into custody in the course of its community-\noriented policing activities, that alien is not returned to the community because of a \nfailure to respond to a detainer. \nFinally, even assuming that the premise of the City’s argument about the fiscal \nyear 2017 application were correct, it could not support the district court’s permanent \ninjunction forbidding the Department from offering the Illegal Immigration focus \narea at all.  The City’s narrower argument does not demonstrate that a focus area on \nillegal immigration is facially invalid.  Nor does it show that all of the specific activities \nmentioned in connection with that focus area on the fiscal year 2017 application are \nnot appropriately subject to community-oriented policing.  Thus, if this Court accepts \nthe City’s narrower argument, the injunction should be correspondingly narrowed. \nB.    The City Offers No Basis for Concluding That the \nDepartment May Not Consider Community-Related Law \nEnforcement Conduct in Awarding Competitive Law \nEnforcement Grants Concerning Community-Oriented \nPolicing.  \n1.  Los Angeles recognizes, as it must, that the Department has substantial \ndiscretion to set application criteria and to score applications.  See, e.g., LA Br. 27, 48.  \nIn exercising that discretion, the Department can properly give some weight to an \napplicant’s cooperation with federal law enforcement efforts related to community-\n15 \n \n\noriented policing.  Indeed, the statute specifically contemplates that the Department \nwill favor applications that identify “related governmental and community initiatives” \nthat will complement the objectives of the program.  34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(4).  The \nDepartment’s broad discretion in this regard encompasses the bonus points given to \njurisdictions that provide access to, and notice of the release dates of, aliens held in \nlocal criminal custody. \nIn determining which jurisdictions should receive competitive grants to further \ncommunity-oriented policing, it is well within the Department’s discretion to prefer \njurisdictions that are assisting federal efforts to remove from the community illegal \naliens held in local criminal custody, rather than undermining those efforts by \nreturning those individuals to a community in which they have no legal right to reside.  \nThe purpose of that cooperation is to ensure that criminal aliens who are held in local \ncriminal custody can be transferred to federal immigration authorities in an orderly \nmanner, and that federal officials have an opportunity to conduct their investigations \nin a controlled environment that helps keep the community safe.  A locality that does \nnot qualify for the bonus points will increase the prevalence of hostile encounters in \nthe local community when federal officials are forced to seek to detain or interrogate \naliens on the streets.  In addition, cooperation with federal officials helps to ensure \nthat removable individuals held in local criminal custody and of interest to federal \nimmigration officials are not released into the community, thereby reducing the \nburdens on local communities and law enforcement that result if those individuals \n16 \n \n\nreoffend.  Those jurisdictions that choose to provide the forms of cooperation \nenvisioned by the bonus points have determined that they can better foster \ncommunity confidence in law enforcement and the rule of law by facilitating the \nremoval of criminal aliens, rather than returning them to the community. \nThe City’s argument to the contrary is belied by its acceptance of the bonus \npoints awarded to jurisdictions that have experienced a “catastrophic event.”  ER 22, \n¶ 18; see LA Br. 49-50.  As the City acknowledges, the Department has broad \ndiscretion in assessing CHP applications to consider “public safety need” and the \nharm created by “divert[ing] resources away from community policing programs to \nrespond” to a catastrophic event.  LA Br. 50.  It is anomalous to suggest that the \nDepartment can consider the increased need for police resources based on \ncircumstances outside the applicant’s control, but cannot consider the applicant’s own \ndetermination to release aliens from local criminal custody directly into the \ncommunity, thus taxing law enforcement resources in addressing crimes committed \nby those aliens who reoffend. \nThe City candidly admits that the COPS Office “has considerable discretion to \nallocate grants in the way it reasonably determines will foster a form of policing that \nrelies on collaborative interactions between local law enforcement and the \ncommunity.”  LA Br. 24.  The COPS Office has determined that cooperation in \nremoving criminals from the community is one way to foster better confidence in law \nenforcement and the rule of law, thereby enhancing community cooperation.  Los \n17 \n \n\nAngeles has made a different policy determination about how to conduct its law \nenforcement operations relative to criminal aliens in its community, concluding that \nignoring immigration enforcement is more likely to enhance community relationships.  \nSee LA Br. 14.  Regardless of the validity of the City’s policy judgment, it may not \nimpose that judgment on the COPS Office, or on other jurisdictions that may make a \ndifferent policy call.  As the City acknowledges, the CHP is designed to enable “law \nenforcement agencies . . . to increase their community policing capacity and crime \nprevention efforts.”  LA Br. 6 (quoting ER 228).  Working with federal immigration \nofficials to remove, where appropriate, aliens in local criminal custody complements \nthe goals of community-oriented policing by ensuring that those individuals will not \nreoffend in the community. \n2.  Los Angeles notes that 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2) and (c)(3) provide that “the \nAttorney General may give preferential consideration, where feasible,” to applicants \nfrom states with certain human-trafficking laws.  From this specific grant of authority, \nthe City draws the negative inference that the Department generally may not \notherwise give preferential consideration to jurisdictions based on their law \nenforcement practices, such as their cooperation with federal immigration \nenforcement.  LA Br. 28-29.  The provisions, enacted as part of a separate piece of \nlegislation to provide assistance to victims of human trafficking, cannot bear the \nextraordinary weight assigned by the City.  See Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act \nof 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-22, tit. VI, § 601, 129 Stat. 227, 259.  The City mistakenly \n18 \n \n\nurges that these provisions would be superfluous if the Department already had \nauthority to give preferred treatment to jurisdictions that had adopted such statutes.  \nLA Br. 28-29.  That Congress in separate legislation explicitly sought to encourage the \nDepartment to grant such preferences does not demonstrate a congressional \njudgment that authority would otherwise have been absent, and it says nothing at all \nabout the understanding of the Congress that enacted 34 U.S.C. § 10381. \nThe City’s reliance on 34 U.S.C. § 10228(a) is similarly misplaced.  That \nprovision states that the Department may not, through its grants, “exercise any \ndirection, supervision, or control over any police force . . . of any State or political \nsubdivision thereof.”  Id.; see LA Br. 32.  All scoring considerations encourage an \napplicant’s police force to take or refrain from taking certain actions, and Congress \nexpressly contemplated that the Department of Justice could take account of \npartnerships with other entities such as the federal government.  See 34 U.S.C. \n§ 10382(c)(4).  As described in the very case on which Los Angeles relies, the purpose \nof § 10228(a) was much more modest: to avoid “the establishment of a federal police \nforce” by allowing federal authorities to control the “routine operations of local police \nforces,” such as by “prescribing the type of shoes and uniforms to be worn” or “the \ntype or brand of ammunition to be purchased.”  Ely v. Velde, 451 F.2d 1130, 1136-37 \n(4th Cir. 1971) (quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Awarding additional \nconsideration to states and localities that provide basic cooperation with federal \nauthorities does not remotely implicate these concerns.   \n19 \n \n\nFinally, Los Angeles urges that absent a specific authorization, federalism-\nrelated canons of interpretation preclude the Department from awarding bonus points \nfor law enforcement cooperation.  See LA Br. 30-31.  But the City does not explain \nhow the bonus points “alter the ‘usual constitutional balance between the States and \nthe Federal Government,’” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (quoting Will v. \nMichigan Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 65 (1989)), or require the “surrender” of \n“powers or functions reserved to the States,” Virginia Dep’t of Educ. v. Riley, 106 F.3d \n559, 566 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc).  At issue here are bonus points awarded in the \nscoring of a discretionary law enforcement grant.  Seeking the bonus points is \noptional, and, notwithstanding the City’s rhetoric, declining to seek the points does \nnot preclude an applicant from receiving a CHP grant.  Indeed, the top-scoring \njurisdiction in the City’s category, like several other funded jurisdictions, did not \nreceive the bonus points.  See ER 193.  And Los Angeles makes no attempt to \nreconcile its rhetoric of “surrender” with the relatively small size of the grants at issue. \nC.    The City’s Invocation of the Spending Clause and the \nAdministrative Procedure Act Adds Nothing to its \nArgument.   \nThe City’s contentions with regard to the Spending Clause and the \nAdministrative Procedure Act restate its statutory arguments and fail for the same \nreasons.  Los Angeles does not contend that the two provisions for obtaining \nadditional points violate the Spending Clause if they were, as we have shown, \n20 \n \n\nauthorized by Congress.  Similarly, the arguments regarding the reasonableness of the \nconditions are premised on the Department’s asserted want of authority.   \n1.  Los Angeles appears to agree that the Spending Clause has no independent \nanalytic role in this case; its discussion of Spending Clause principles largely \nincorporates by reference its statutory argument that community-oriented policing \ncannot be used to address local concerns connected to illegal immigration.  See LA Br. \n52-53.  There is no dispute that, in the context of a law enforcement grant, Congress \nis entitled to give preferential treatment to jurisdictions with law enforcement \nprograms that do not interfere with federal law enforcement.  See Mayweathers v. \nNewland, 314 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir. 2002) (conditions on spending need only bear \n“some relationship to the purpose of the federal spending”).  The question is simply \nwhether the Department acted within its statutorily delegated discretion in offering \nthe Illegal Immigration focus area and the bonus points: for the reasons already \ndiscussed, the answer is yes.  \n2.  The City’s Administrative Procedure Act (APA) argument is likewise beside \nthe point.  Los Angeles’s primary complaint under the APA is identical to its statutory \nargument: that community-oriented policing and immigration enforcement are \nincompatible.  For example, in urging that the Illegal Immigration focus area is \nimpermissible, the City argues that the Department lacks “a reasoned basis for \nconcluding that community policing is a viable strategy for engaging in civil \n21 \n \n\nimmigration enforcement,” LA Br. 58, and cites various evidence that, in its view, \ndemonstrates the correctness of its preferred policy, see id. at 54-58.   \nAs explained, however, the statutory scheme confirms that immigration, like \nother law enforcement issues, can be addressed through community-oriented policing.  \nThus, the decision at issue is the Department’s choice to offer jurisdictions the option \nto advance proposals in the Illegal Immigration focus area.  As to this decision, the \nCity’s asserted evidence is simply irrelevant.  The Department is under no obligation \nto examine studies to determine whether immigration enforcement always and \neverywhere has a positive or negative effect on “police-community relationships.”  LA \nBr. 58.  Instead, the Department’s charge is to review a particular jurisdiction’s \napplication, examining whether and how effectively a particular jurisdiction’s proposal \nreorients or enhances its “involvement in or commitment to community-oriented \npolicing.”  34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(10).   \nJurisdictions that share the City’s view need not choose the Illegal Immigration \nfocus area.  But Los Angeles cannot use the APA as a vehicle for imposing its policy \njudgments about the relationship between immigration enforcement and community-\noriented policing on other localities that have different views based on the needs of \ntheir communities.  And determinations about whether grant funds are best spent in \nthis area or some other are highly discretionary and based on normative assessments \nrather than empirical predictions.  Cf. 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2) (exempting grants from the \nnotice and comment rulemaking procedures of the APA). \n22 \n \n\nThe City’s argument about the bonus points suffers from the same flaws.  The \nbonus points are provided to jurisdictions that permit federal immigration officials \naccess to individuals who the jurisdictions are holding for their own criminal justice \npurposes, and, upon request, notice before those individuals are released back into the \ncommunity.  It is eminently reasonable for the Department to consider it sufficiently \nrelated to community-oriented policing whether a jurisdiction is releasing individuals \nwhom the jurisdiction itself suspected of criminal conduct back into the community \nwithout providing federal officials with notice and access to those aliens.  That \njudgment—which, as discussed, is permissible under the statute—does not depend on \nfactual determinations of the sort Los Angeles demands.  It simply requires asking \nwhether the Department should blind itself to the degree of cooperation provided by \nlocalities to federal law enforcement efforts when distributing federal grants. \n23 \n \n\nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the district court should be reversed. \nRespectfully submitted, \n  CHAD A.

See Decl. of Andrew A. Dorr, \n15 \nD.E. 33-1, ¶ 32.  Although Defendants have not included sufficient supporting \n16 \ninformation to enable Plaintiff to assess this claim, Plaintiff has concluded that it would \n17 \nbe impractical to explore the matter further and still secure timely relief in advance of the \n18 \naward decisions for the current grant year.

In Fiscal Year 2017, USDOJ’s \n6  Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS Office”) considered, \n7  among many other scoring factors, whether applicants in the COPS Hiring Program \n8  (“CHP” or “Program”) had either chosen to focus on Illegal Immigration during the \n9  grant period or had committed to give federal immigration authorities access to \n10  aliens in the applicant’s custody and to notify federal authorities before the \n11  scheduled release of an alien.  \n12    Aside from the merits, Los Angeles’s challenge to the FY 2017 factors is \n13  moot because those factors had no effect on the City’s non-receipt of a CHP grant \n14  for FY 2017.  Despite plaintiff’s protestations, defendants’ earlier misstatement \n  \n15  regarding the effect of the factors on other applicants had no bearing on this \n16  plaintiff or on this plaintiff’s withdrawal of its request for a preliminary injunction.  \n17  And Los Angeles lacks standing to challenge whatever immigration-related factors \n18  might be used in the FY 2018 grant season because those factors are not yet known \n19  and Los Angeles has no reasonable expectation that they will affect the City. \n20    On the merits, Los Angeles misunderstands the meaning of “community-\n21  oriented policing” under the COPS Hiring Program.  The COPS Office’s programs \n22  are not simply a matter of “police-community relations,” as the City claims; they \n23  embody, rather, an entire “philosophy” of law enforcement that focuses on antici-\n24  pating and preventing crime rather than merely responding to crimes after they \n25  happen.  The breadth of what community-oriented policing includes affects both \n26  plaintiff’s ultra vires / Separation of Powers Claim and its Spending Clause claim.  \n27  Giving an applicant extra points in the CHP scoring process for cooperating with \n28  immigration enforcement with respect to aliens who have committed crimes or are \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 6 of 23   Page ID #:2243\n \n1  suspected of committing crimes contributes to Congress’s overarching goal of \n2  aiding local law enforcement in preventing crime.  These scoring factors accord-\n3  ingly fit well within the COPS Office’s statutory discretion, and are closely related \n4  to the purposes of the COPS Hiring Program.  The immigration-related law \n5  enforcement factors are also eminently reasonable given the connections between \n6  the criminal law and federal immigration law, thus defeating plaintiff’s claim under \n7  the Administrative Procedure Act. \n8    Finally, should the Court grant relief, any such relief should be limited to the \n9  plaintiff before the Court.  The City’s proposed order on its motion for summary \n10  judgment would prohibit the COPS Office from relying on the challenged factors in \n11  the COPS Hiring Program as a whole, nationwide (Doc. 49-6).  But that does not \n12  make sense, given that Los Angeles does not represent a class and does not need a \n13  nationwide injunction to obtain complete relief.  It is axiomatic that “an injunction \n14  must be narrowly tailored to affect only those persons over which [the court] has \n      \n15  power, and to remedy only the specific harms shown by the plaintiffs, rather than to \n16  enjoin all possible breaches of the law.”  Price v. City of Stockton, 390 F.3d 1105, \n17  1117 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Should the Court side \n18  with the City, it should order the COPS Office to score Los Angeles’s future \n19  applications (assuming there are such applications) as if the City has qualified for \n20  any additional points attributable to immigration-related factors.  Such an order \n21  would make the plaintiff whole, while refraining from issuing relief to thousands of \n22  jurisdictions that are not parties to this suit and have not sought any relief here. \n23    Accordingly, judgment should be entered for the defendants on Counts Four, \n24  Five, and Six of plaintiff’s Complaint.   \n25  ARGUMENT \n26  I.  All of Plaintiff’s Claims Must Be Dismissed as Non-Justiciable \n27    Plaintiff challenges certain scoring factors used in awarding grants on an \n28  annual basis.  Therefore, although some of plaintiff’s arguments regarding justicia-\n       2\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 7 of 23   Page ID #:2244\n \n1  bility do not specify the time period to which they relate, the justiciability of plain-\n2  tiff’s claims must be considered on an annual basis.  To the extent plaintiff seeks \n3  relief regarding the FY 2017 scoring factors, its claims are moot.  To the extent \n4  plaintiff seeks relief regarding the scoring factors for FY 2018 or later years, the \n5  City lacks standing because its prophesied injury is too speculative. \n \n6 \n  A.  Plaintiff’s Claims Are Moot In Relation \n7      to the FY 2017 Factors \n8    Regardless of whether Los Angeles originally had standing in relation to the \n9  FY 2017 scoring factors when it filed this action (Doc. 57 at 4), any request for \n10  relief regarding those factors became moot when the COPS Office determined, \n11  during the pendency of this action, that Los Angeles would not have received a \n12  Fiscal Year 2017 award even without regard to the immigration-related factors \n13  challenged here.  That circumstance – not the effect of the FY 2017 factors on any \n14  other applicants – deprived Los Angeles of any cognizable interest in the FY 2017 \n      \n15  factors.  Plaintiff seems to have recognized as much in withdrawing its motion for \n16  preliminary injunction. \n17    In responding to the City’s motion, defendants stated that “Los Angeles \n18  would not receive CHP funding this year even if all points related to illegal \n19  immigration were excluded from the scoring” such that the City could not establish \n20  standing or irreparable harm (Doc. 33 at 2).  Four days after the filing of defen-\n21  dants’ opposition, plaintiff’s counsel stated in an email that the City would be with-\n22  drawing its motion for preliminary injunction “in light of the Government’s \n23  statement in your Opposition (and the accompanying sworn declaration) that the \n24  challenged considerations will not impact the fate of the City’s 2017 COPS grant \n25  application.”  See Declaration of W. Scott Simpson, Ex. A (Attachment 1 hereto).  \n26  The plaintiff then filed a formal notice stating that it was withdrawing the motion \n27  because the COPS Office “had putatively determined that Los Angeles’ award \n28  application was unaffected by the inclusion of immigration-related considerations” \n       3\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 8 of 23   Page ID #:2245\n \n1  (Doc. 37).   \n2    Defendants’ partial motion for summary judgment, filed later, stated that \n3  defendants’ opposition had inadvertently misstated the effect of the immigration \n4  related-factors on certain other applicants, but reiterated that Los Angeles’s FY \n5  2017 application “was denied because it scored below those of other large-\n6  population jurisdictions, even without regard to any immigration-related factors” \n7  (Doc. 53 at 8, 10 & n.3).  Los Angeles did not claim – and it would not have made \n8  sense to claim – that it withdrew its motion for preliminary injunction because the \n9  challenged scoring factors advantaged or disadvantaged some other CHP applicant.  \n10  Rather, the City’s stated reason for withdrawing its motion was that it would not \n11  have received a 2017 CHP grant even if it obtained preliminary relief.  That fact is \n12  as true today as it was then.  Plaintiff’s attempt to inflate this immaterial, honest \n13  mistake by a declarant from the COPS Office’s career staff into a “material \n14  misrepresentation” is thus belied by both commonsense and the City’s own prior \n      \n15  statements (Doc. 57 at 2). \n16    Given that the challenged scoring factors had no effect on Los Angeles in FY \n17  2017, the City’s claims are moot to the extent it seeks relief regarding those factors.   \n18  As the Ninth Circuit has explained, the “requisite personal interest that must exist at \n19  the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its exis-\n20  tence (mootness)”).  Sanford v. MemberWorks, Inc., 625 F.3d 550, 556 (9th Cir. \n21  2010) (quoting U.S. Parole Comm’n v.

And besides, that \n26 \ndoctrine is an exception to mootness – not standing.  See Nelsen v. King Cty., 895 \n27  F.2d 1248, 1254 (9th Cir. 1990) (“[T]he ‘capable of repetition but evading review’ \ndoctrine is an exception only to the mootness doctrine; it is not transferable to the \n28 \nstanding context.”). \n       4\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 9 of 23   Page ID #:2246\n \n1   \n  B.  Plaintiff Lacks Standing in Relation to Future  \n2 \n    Scoring Factors \n3 \n   As for the future, Los Angeles cannot, for different reasons, have any \n4 \ncognizable interest in whatever immigration-related factors will be used for future \n5 \ngrant years, including FY 2018.  “To demonstrate standing to pursue prospective \n6 \ninjunctive relief, [the plaintiff] must demonstrate a concrete injury and a realistic \n7 \nlikelihood that the injury will be repeated.”  Taylor v. Westly, 488 F.3d 1197, 1199 \n8 \n(9th Cir. 2007); see City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105, 109 (1983).  \n9 \nThe injury must be “certainly impending” rather than “speculative.”  See Whitmore \n10 \nv. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 157-58 (1990). \n11 \n  Plaintiff cannot show a “realistic likelihood” of future injury from the use of \n12 \nimmigration-related factors in the COPS Hiring Program.  First, the COPS Office \n13 \nhas not yet determined the focus areas for FY 2018 or how immigration-related \n14 \n       factors will be handled in the FY 2018 application (nor, obviously, in future years).  \n15 \nSee Declaration of Andrew A. Dorr ¶¶ 14, 18, 24, 29 (“Dorr Decl.”) (Doc. 53-1).  \n16 \nPlaintiff argues that the challenged factors are a “priority” for the Attorney General \n17 \n(Doc. 57 at 6), but the City cannot derive standing from its assumptions about the \n18 \nAttorney General’s priorities or the future of this specific program.  Second, Los \n19 \nAngeles has applied for grants under the COPS Hiring Program (or its predecessor) \n20 \nin less than half the years it has existed – just nine times during the twenty-three \n21 \nyears these grants have been awarded.  Id. ¶ 36.  Plaintiff now claims that that it \n22 \n“intends” to seek a CHP grant in the FY 2018 grant cycle (Doc. 57 at 6-7).  But that \n23 \nbare, self-serving assertion – conveyed only in response to defendants’ motion to \n24 \ndismiss rather than in the Complaint – does not create a cognizable interest in \n25 \nfuture, unknown scoring factors that may never materialize and, if they do, may \n26 \nnever actually affect the City, even if the City decides to apply, which history \n27 \nsuggests it very well may not. \n28 \n       5\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 10 of 23   Page ID #:2247\n \n1    Los Angeles also seeks to rely on “competitive harm” compared to other \n2  jurisdictions in seeking CHP grants (id. at 3-4).  But the cases on which plaintiff \n3  relies on that subject relate primarily to commercial harm such as “competitive \n4  disadvantage in the international marketplace,” see Bullfrog Films, Inc. v. Wick, \n5  847 F.2d 502, 506 (9th Cir. 1988); they do not stand for the proposition that \n6  “competitive disadvantage” in a grant program constitutes cognizable harm.  In any \n7  event, the immigration-related factors in the COPS Hiring Program create a disad-\n8  vantage for a given applicant only if those factors actually have some effect on \n9  whether the applicant receives an award.  If a jurisdiction seeks an award and those \n10  factors do, in fact, cause the COPS Office to deny the application, only then might \n11  that jurisdiction have a cognizable interest in challenging them. \n \n12 \nII.  Alternatively, the Court Should Enter Judgment for  \n13    Defendants on the Merits \n \n14 \n         A.  “Community-Oriented Policing” Permeates All Aspects  \n15      of Law Enforcement and Public Safety   \n16    By statute, CHP funds must be used to hire, rehire, or train officers “for \n17  deployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  Much \n18  of City’s argument on the merits is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of \n19  community-oriented policing.  Specifically, the City understands this concept as \n20  limited to improving “police-community relations” (Doc. 57 at 19).  In other words, \n21  Los Angeles believes the purpose of the COPS Hiring Program – and of the COPS \n22  Office generally – is merely to help law enforcement agencies build better relation-\n23  ships with the communities they serve.  The City thus argues, for example, that \n24  “[j]urisdictions suffering from a catastrophic event can [reasonably] be expected to \n25  divert resources to respond to the tragedy and away from community policing” (id. \n26  at 19, emphases added).  Similarly, Los Angeles says, “the fact that something is a \n27  ‘public safety issue’ does not mean it is a ‘community-oriented policing issue.’  All \n28  policing has to do with public safety, but Congress did not authorize COPS funds to \n       6\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 11 of 23   Page ID #:2248\n \n1  hire officers for ‘deployment in policing’ generally” (id. at 16).  This narrow \n2  understanding of community-oriented policing infects plaintiff’s arguments on both \n3  its ultra vires / Separation of Powers claim and its Spending Clause claim. \n4    The truth is that community-oriented policing is not such a crabbed concept.  \n5  To the contrary, as Congress understood community-oriented policing and as the \n6  COPS Office has long implemented that understanding, it is not simply about \n7  building relationships but is, rather, a philosophy that should guide all aspects of a \n8  law enforcement agency’s work.  This is reflected, for example, in the legislative \n9  history of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  In \n10  explaining the need for community-oriented policing, the House Judiciary \n11  Committee lamented that law enforcement officials were spending too much time \n12  “simply responding to crimes after the fact” and not enough time “anticipat[ing] \n13  and prevent[ing] crime by use of community-oriented, problem solving \n14  techniques.”  H.R. Rep. No. 103-324 at 8-9 (1993).  Quoting the Deputy Attorney \n      \n15  General, the committee explained that the sort of “community policing” required to \n16  make law enforcement preventive rather than reactive involves not merely \n17  “community engagement” or “community relations,” but “tailoring solutions, based \n18  on thoughtful, in-depth analysis, to unique neighborhood crime and disorder \n19  problems.”  Id. at 9.  In short, community-oriented policing is “an organization-\n20  wide philosophy.”  Id. at 11. \n21    The COPS Office’s materials and activities reflect Congress’s broad under-\n22  standing of community policing.  For example, as stated in the CHP Application \n23  Guide for 2017, “[c]ommunity policing is a philosophy that promotes organiza-\n24  tional strategies that support the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving \n25  techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public \n26  safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime.  Rather than simply \n27  responding to crimes once they have been committed, community policing \n28  concentrates on preventing crime and eliminating the atmosphere of fear it creates.”  \n       7\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 12 of 23   Page ID #:2249\n \n1  See 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Application Guide at 91 (Doc. 49-4, Ex. \n2  B).  Although the Guide also discusses the importance of “[e]arning the trust of the \n3  community,” that is just one aspect of community-oriented policing.  Similarly, \n4  several of the COPS Office’s recent budget proposals to Congress explain that the \n5  Office’s “mission is to advance public safety through the practice of community \n6  policing,” which “concentrates on preventing both crime and the atmosphere of fear \n7  it creates” by “proactively addressing the root causes of criminal and disorderly \n8  behavior, rather than simply responding to crimes once they have been committed.”  \n9  Defs.’ Req. Jud. Notice, Exs. A, B (Attachment 2 hereto); see id., Exs. C, D.2  The \n10  breadth of community-oriented policing is reflected in the wide variety of areas on \n11  which a CHP grant may focus – including everything from Violent Crime Problems \n12  to Traffic/Pedestrian Safety Problems.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 7.  Whatever focus area an \n13  applicant chooses, it must use the principles of community policing to address the \n14  problems.  \n      \n15    Indeed, plaintiff’s own police department agrees:  “The Los Angeles Police \n16  Department strongly embraces the philosophy of Community Policing in all its \n17  daily operations and functions.”  See Community Policing Unit, available at \n18  http://www.lapdonline.org/support_lapd/content_basic_view/731 (last visited Feb. \n19  8, 2018).  As LAPD itself explains, “Community-Police Problem Solving uses the \n20  ‘SARA’ approach (Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Assessment) to examine \n21  characteristics of problems in the community and to develop appropriate strategies \n22  to reduce these community-identified crime and disorder issues.”  Id.  More \n23  specifically, the SARA approach to community-oriented policing involves \n24  “[i]dentify[ing] and prioritiz[ing] problems”; “[r]esearch[ing] what is known about \n25  the problem”; [d]evelop[ing] solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the \n26 \n                                              \n27    2 Given that these are initial budget proposals, the program details and \nfunding amounts contained in them do not necessarily reflect the final programs or \n28 \nfunding amounts for the fiscal years in question. \n       8\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 13 of 23   Page ID #:2250\n \n1  number and extent of problems”; and [e]valuat[ing] the success of the responses.”  \n2  Pl.’s Req. Jud. Notice, Ex. F at 6 (Doc. 49-3).   \n3    Los Angeles is thus confused when it suggests that a jurisdiction might \n4  sometimes have to “divert resources . . . away from community policing” to \n5  respond to a “catastrophic event” (Doc. 57 at 19, emphasis added); rather, the \n6  jurisdiction should use community-oriented policing strategies to inform and \n7  improve its response to catastrophic events.  Contrary to plaintiff’s arguments, all \n8  “public safety issues” are and should be “community-oriented policing issues” (id. \n9  at 16).  CHP funds thus should be used to “hire officers for ‘deployment in \n10  policing’ generally” within the areas described in each jurisdiction’s application – \n11  all guided by the overarching philosophy of community-oriented policing (id.).    \n \n12 \n  B.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Consistent  \n13      with the Governing Statutes  \n14    In light of the governing statutes, the COPS Office’s authority encompasses \n      \n15  the immigration-related factors that Los Angeles attacks.  USDOJ is responsible for \n16  disseminating the scarce funds appropriated under 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1) and \n17  (b)(2).  The statute gives the COPS Office discretion in disseminating those funds, \n18  and the inadequacy of the available funds to cover all applications requires the \n19  Office to adopt and employ factors to rank and choose among them.   \n20    In attempting to establish that USDOJ lacks authority to use the scoring \n21  factors challenged here, Los Angeles argues (1) that defendants are “diverting” \n22  funds from community-oriented policing into immigration enforcement (Doc. 57 at \n23  10, 15-17), (2) that the factors expressly described in the statute provide “ample \n24  discretion” for the COPS Office to choose among applicants (id. at 10, 18), (3) that \n25  Congress’s inclusion of 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2)-(3), allowing the Office to give \n26  preferential consideration to applicants from States with certain laws on human \n27  trafficking, forecloses giving preferential consideration based on any other aspect of \n28  an applicant’s laws, regulations, or policies (id. at 11-12); and (4) that the COPS \n       9\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 14 of 23   Page ID #:2251\n \n1  Office could use the challenged factors only if the statute included a “clear state-\n2  ment” authorizing them pursuant to Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991) (id. \n3  at 13-14).  All of these arguments are incorrect. \n4    First, as shown above, community-oriented policing is not a discrete activity \n5  that the COPS Hiring Program funds, but is rather a philosophy of law enforcement \n6  that should imbue everything a grantee does.  The defendants and LAPD agree that \n7  “the philosophy of Community Policing [should guide a law enforcement agency] \n8  in all its daily operations and functions” – a philosophy of “proactively addressing \n9  the root causes of criminal and disorderly behavior, rather than simply responding \n10  to crimes once they have been committed.”  See Community Policing Unit, \n11  available at http://www.lapdonline.org/support_lapd/content_basic_view/731 (last \n12  visited Feb. 8, 2018); Defs.’ Req. Jud. Notice, Exs. A, B.  Thus, giving a CHP \n13  applicant extra points in the scoring process for cooperating in the enforcement of \n14  federal immigration law in relation to persons who have committed crimes or are \n      \n15  suspected of committing crimes contributes to community-oriented policing rather \n16  than “diverting” funds from it. \n17    Second, USDOJ’s statutory responsibility to choose among applicants for \n18  scarce CHP funds necessarily entails discretion to consider factors not explicit in \n19  the statute.  Plaintiff argues that the COPS Office’s discretion is limited to consider-\n20  ing (1) the applicants’ “public safety needs,” (2) which areas of public safety each \n21  applicant seeks to promote, and (3) how the applicants will employ community-\n22  oriented policing (Doc. 57 at 18).  But none of these considerations are explicit in \n23  the statute either.  The COPS statute does not expressly authorize USDOJ to \n24  prioritize certain needs over others; it only requires each applicant to “demonstrate \n25  a specific public safety need,” 34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(2), leaving the COPS Office \n26  without any express statutory authority to prioritize one “need” over another.  \n27  Accordingly, if USDOJ is entitled to “prioritiz[e] different areas of public safety \n28  from year to year” – as Los Angeles concedes it is (Doc. 57 at 18) – there is no \n       10\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 15 of 23   Page ID #:2252\n \n1  reason why it cannot select Illegal Immigration as one of those priority areas.  \n2  Further, the statute says nothing about weighting the various factors differently \n3  depending on whether each factor relates to Fiscal Health, Crime, or Community \n4  Policing.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 20.  All of those factors, and others not expressly described \n5  in the statute, are needed to allow the COPS Office to choose among the many \n6  applications.  Id. ¶¶ 12-22.  And indeed, Los Angeles has never challenged the \n7  COPS Office’s use of any of those factors until now.    \n8    Third, Congress’s permissive statement that the Office “may” consider \n9  applicants’ laws regarding human trafficking, 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2), (3), does \n10  not foreclose the consideration of other factors not expressly set forth in the statute \n11  or constitute a “superfluous” statutory statement (contra Doc. 57 at 11).  The \n12  enumeration of one potential discretionary factor should not be read to exclude \n13  others “unless it is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility \n14  and meant to say no to it.”  Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 \n      \n15  (2003).  Moreover, the COPS Office has used scoring factors not expressly set forth \n16  in the statute since the Office’s creation in 1994, and Congress has continued to \n17  authorize its programs with full knowledge of its practices.  Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 2, 12-22.  \n18  The best interpretation of 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(1) and (2) is thus what they plainly \n19  say:  Not that the COPS Office’s discretion to consider different priorities is \n20  limited, but that its discretion is broad and that Congress has suggested a few \n21  specific, important priorities that the Office “may” – not “shall,” not “may only” – \n22  consider when exercising that discretion.3 \n23 \n                                              \n  3 In addition, the fact that 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(1) and (2) expressly refer to \n24 \nthe applicants’ statutes does not suggest that the COPS Office otherwise lacks \n25  authority to consider an applicant’s “law and policies” (contra Doc. 57 at 11).  \nMany of the factors long considered by the Office relate to an applicant’s “laws and \n26 \npolicies,” including the preference of military veterans in hiring (not reflected in the \n27  COPS statute until 2017), the regular assessment of employee satisfaction, and the \nexercise of flexibility in officer shift assignments.  Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 18-19.  Further, \n28 \nplaintiff asserts incorrectly that the access and notice factors seek to change \n       11\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 16 of 23   Page ID #:2253\n \n1    Fourth, the Supreme Court’s decision in Gregory v. Ashcroft does not require \n2  a “clear statement” in the statute authorizing the COPS Office to use the challenged \n3  scoring factors (contra Doc. 57 at 13-14).  The circumstances that led the Gregory \n4  Court to require a “clear statement” of agency authority in that case do not exist \n5  here.  There, Missouri state judges argued that a state constitutional provision \n6  requiring judges to retire at age seventy violated the Age Discrimination in \n7  Employment Act (“ADEA”).  501 U.S. at 455-61.  The Court observed that the \n8  authority to “establish a qualification for those who sit as their judges . . . goes \n9  beyond an area traditionally regulated by the States; it is a decision of the most \n10  fundamental sort for a sovereign entity.”  Id. at 460.  In that context, the Court \n11  observed, it would not construe a federal statute as overriding the State’s will unless \n12  that intention were “unmistakably clear.”  Id. \n13    Committing to focus on immigration enforcement during the period of a \n14  grant, as well as the ad hoc cooperation that the “access” and “notice” factors \n      \n15  envision, are entirely unlike the qualifications of state judges at issue in Gregory.  \n16  As the Court observed there, state judges are among the “most important [state] \n17  government officials,” id. at 463, and the ADEA would have categorically over-\n18  ridden the State’s constitutional choice regarding their qualifications.  By contrast, \n19  taking advantage of the challenged scoring factors in the COPS Hiring Program \n20  would only require a jurisdiction to cooperate with immigration enforcement in \n21  ways proposed by the grantee or to give federal authorities access to certain aliens \n22  in the United States – aliens whose admission, conduct, presence, and potential \n23  removal are quintessentially the responsibility of the Federal Government.  See \n24  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394-95 (2012).  Securing such voluntary \n25  cooperation or access – far from endangering “the independence of the States,” \n26 \n                                                                                                                                                   \n27  applicants’ “laws” (Doc. 57 at 10); rather, those factors ask whether the applicant \nhas “rules, regulations, policies, and/or practices” that provide the described access \n28 \nand notice to federal immigration authorities (Doc. 1 ¶ 81). \n       12\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 17 of 23   Page ID #:2254\n \n1  Gregory, 501 at 460 – merely assists federal authorities in performing their duties.  \n2  Furthermore, Gregory did not involve an exercise of the spending power, but rather \n3  the direct regulation of a state government activity.  Thus, there is no basis for \n4  applying Gregory’s “unmistakable clarity” rule here.4  \n \n5 \n  C.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Consistent  \n6      with the Spending Clause \n7    Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that the immigration-related factors violate the \n8  Spending Clause both because they are “ambiguous” and because they are purport-\n9  edly “unrelated” to the purposes of CHP grants (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 124-125).  See S. Dakota \n10  v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).  Plaintiff’s opposition says nothing about the ambi-\n11  guity component of Dole, so the City has apparently withdrawn that challenge.  In \n12  any event, as explained in defendants’ motion, the COPS Office provided brief \n13  examples of some specific activities an applicant could propose in each focus area \n14  (including Illegal Immigration), but deliberately allowed applicants to develop their \n      \n15  own approaches.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 8.  The notice and access factors are reasonably \n16  detailed, and the Office offered to answer any questions an applicant had about \n17  them.  Id. ¶ 28.     \n18    Under Mayweathers v. Newland, the “relatedness” component of Dole is only \n19  a “possible ground” for invalidating an enactment and does not impose an “exacting \n20  standard.”  314 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir. 2002).  Plaintiff argues that “enforcement \n21  of federal civil immigration laws is unrelated to the COPS grant’s purpose of \n22 \n                                              \n23    4 The Fourth Circuit’s decision in Virginia Department of Education v. Riley, \n106 F.3d 559 (4th Cir. 1997), also weighs against applying Gregory in this case \n24 \n(contra Doc. 57 at 13).  The court held there that the Individuals with Disabilities \n25  Education Act did not authorize the U.S. Department of Education to withhold \nVirginia’s entire annual IDEA grant based on the State’s refusal to provide educa-\n26 \ntional services for students who had been expelled for reasons unrelated to their \n27  disabilities.  In so holding, the court repeatedly emphasized that the case involved \n“matters peculiarly within the province of the States” – that is, the “core function of \n28 \nensuring order and discipline in their schools.”  106 F.3d at 562; see id. at 565, 566.   \n       13\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 18 of 23   Page ID #:2255\n \n1  promoting community-oriented policing” and that the COPS Office is “diverting \n2  [CHP] funds to federal immigration enforcement and away from their statutorily \n3  authorized purpose” (Doc. 57 at 10, 20).  But particularly given the breadth of what \n4  community-oriented policing includes, the immigration-related factors challenged \n5  here bear much more than the minimally required “some relationship” to the \n6  congressional purposes behind the COPS Hiring Program.  Mayweathers, 314 F.3d \n7  at 1067. \n8    Congress established the CHP to promote “community-oriented policing,” 34 \n9  U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2), “to increase police presence, to expand and improve \n10  cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and members of the \n11  community to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise to enhance \n12  public safety,” Pub. L. No. 103-322, Title I, § 10003(a), 108 Stat. 1808 (1994).  As \n13  discussed above, community-oriented policing is an overall philosophy that should \n14  inform all law enforcement activities.  It focuses on “anticipat[ing] and prevent[ing] \n      \n15  crime by use of community-oriented, problem solving techniques” rather than \n16  “simply responding to crimes after the fact.”  H.R. Rep. No. 103-324 at 8-9.   \n17    Both community-oriented policing and the enforcement of federal immigra-\n18  tion law seek to prevent crime and “enhance public safety.”  Adjudications under \n19  the criminal laws often have consequences under federal immigration law.  The \n20  Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) explicitly coordinates prosecution under \n21  the criminal laws and enforcement of immigration laws – by, among other things, \n22  requiring that aliens serve criminal sentences before entering immigration custody \n23  and providing that federal custody under the immigration laws commence \n24  immediately upon conclusion of a criminal sentence.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(4)(A) \n25  (providing that Department of Homeland Security “may not remove an alien who is \n26  sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released from imprisonment”); id. \n27  § 1231(a)(1)(B)(iii) (stating that removal period “begins on . . . the date the alien is \n28  released from [state or local criminal] detention”).  Finally, the access and notice \n       14\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 19 of 23   Page ID #:2256\n \n1  factors at issue relate to aliens who are under criminal detention and thus have \n2  either committed crimes or are suspected of having committed crimes.  Dorr Decl. \n3  ¶ 29.  Accordingly, to the extent Dole requires “relatedness,” that requirement is \n4  satisfied here. \n \n5 \n  D.  The Challenged Factors Are Consistent with the  \n6      Administrative Procedure Act \n7    The validity of plaintiff’s claim under the Administrative Procedure Act \n8  essentially depends on the validity of the City’s constitutional challenges to the \n9  immigration-related factors.  The crux of plaintiff’s APA claim is that defendants \n10  have not “explained the connection between the immigration factors and \n11  community policing” (Doc. 57 at 22).  As discussed above, however, “community \n12  policing” affects all aspects of public safety, and the INA inextricably links the \n13  enforcement of criminal law with the enforcement of immigration law, especially in \n14  relation to the aliens in criminal custody who are covered by the access and notice \n      \n15  factors challenged here.  The challenged scoring factors are reasonable because \n16  Congress established the COPS Hiring Program to promote public safety, coopera-\n17  tion among law enforcement agencies, and community-oriented policing – goals \n18  that are all enhanced by facilitating federal access to aliens who have violated \n19  immigration law and who have violated, or are suspected of violating, state or local \n20  criminal laws.  \n21    USDOJ believes that “[c]ities and states that cooperate with federal law \n22  enforcement make all of us safer by helping remove dangerous criminals from our \n23  communities.”  Pl.’s Req. Jud. Notice, Ex. D (Doc. 49-3).  The “arbitrary and \n24  capricious” standard under the APA is “highly deferential, presuming the agency \n25  action to be valid and affirming the agency action if a reasonable basis exists for its \n26  decision.”  Indep. Acceptance Co. v. California, 204 F.3d 1247, 1251 (9th Cir. \n27  2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “[A] court is not to substitute its \n28  judgment for that of the agency, and should uphold a decision of less than ideal \n       15\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 20 of 23   Page ID #:2257\n \n1  clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.”  FCC v. Fox Television \n2  Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 513-14 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n3  That standard is readily met here. \n4  III.  Any Injunction Herein Should Be Limited to the Plaintiff \n5    Plaintiff’s proposed order on its motion for summary judgment would \n6  prohibit the COPS Office from relying on the challenged factors in the COPS \n7  Hiring Program as a whole, nationwide (Doc. 49-6).  But if this Court were to \n8  conclude that Los Angeles had established a right to judgment, any injunction \n9  should be limited to the plaintiff rather than applying to all CHP applicants.  This is \n10  compelled by principles of both standing and the proper scope of equitable relief. \n11    First, a plaintiff generally has standing to pursue relief only for itself, and not \n12  for absent third parties.  See J & J Sports Prods., Inc. v. Dean, No. 10-05088 CW, \n13  2011 WL 4080052, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 12, 2011).  This is consistent with the \n14  basic rules of standing:  Injury to third parties does not usually affect the plaintiff, \n      \n15  and relief for a third party normally cannot redress any injury to the plaintiff.  See \n16  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102-03 (1998).  A contrary \n17  ruling would exceed the scope of a district court’s jurisdiction under Article III.  \n18  See Wickenkamp v. Baum, No. 2:15-CV-00483-PK, 2015 WL 5686746, at *5 (D. \n19  Or. Sept. 22, 2015). \n20    Second, equitable relief should normally be limited to what is needed to \n21  make the plaintiff whole.  “[A]n injunction must be narrowly tailored to affect only \n22  those persons over which [the court] has power, and to remedy only the specific \n23  harms shown by the plaintiffs, rather than to enjoin all possible breaches of the \n24  law.”  Price v. City of Stockton, 390 F.3d 1105, 1117 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal \n25  quotation marks omitted).  It should be “no more burdensome to the defendant than \n26  necessary to provide complete relief to plaintiffs.”  Zepeda v. INS, 753 F.2d 719, \n27  728 n.1 (9th Cir. 1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).  For these reasons, \n28  courts routinely deny requests for nationwide injunctive relief.  See Los Angeles \n       16\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 21 of 23   Page ID #:2258\n \n1  Haven Hospice, Inc. v. Sebelius, 638 F.3d 644, 664 (9th Cir. 2011) (affirming \n2  judgment for plaintiff but reversing entry of nationwide injunction as abuse of \n3  discretion); see also Skydive Arizona, Inc. v. Quattrocchi, 673 F.3d 1105, 1116 (9th \n4  Cir. 2012) (affirming district court’s refusal to grant nationwide relief). \n5    Third, these principles are especially important in litigation involving the \n6  Federal Government.  The Supreme Court has held, for example, that non-mutual \n7  collateral estoppel does not apply against the Federal Government because it would \n8  “substantially thwart the development of important questions of law by freezing the \n9  first final decision rendered on a particular legal issue.”  United States v. Mendoza, \n10  464 U.S. 154, 160 (1984).  Such “freezing” would “deprive [the Supreme] Court of \n11  the benefit it receives from permitting several courts of appeals to explore a \n12  difficult question.”  Id.  A nationwide injunction against the Government would \n13  have much the same effect, preventing the implementation of a challenged measure \n14  in all circuits.  See Los Angeles Haven Hospice, Inc., 638 F.3d at 664 (“The \n      \n15  Supreme Court has . . . suggested that nationwide injunctive relief may be inappro-\n16  priate where a regulatory challenge involves important or difficult questions of law, \n17  which might benefit from development in different factual contexts and in multiple \n18  decisions by the various courts of appeals.”); see also United States v. AMC Entm’t, \n19  Inc., 549 F.3d 760, 773 (9th Cir. 2008) (“Courts in the Ninth Circuit should not \n20  grant relief that would cause substantial interference with the established judicial \n21  pronouncements of . . . sister circuits.  To hold otherwise would create tension \n22  between circuits and would encourage forum shopping.”). \n23    Despite these principles, Los Angeles argues here that only a nationwide \n24  injunction can provide the relief it seeks because its injury consists of the additional \n25  points “unlawfully” given to other applicants in the CHP scoring process (Doc. 57 \n26  at 24).  But the Court could provide complete relief, properly limited to the \n27  plaintiff, by ordering the COPS Office to score Los Angeles’s future application \n28  (assuming there is such an application) as if the City had qualified for any addi-\n       17\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 69   Filed 02/08/18   Page 22 of 23   Page ID #:2259\n \n1  tional points attributable to immigration-related factors.  Such an order would make \n2  the plaintiff whole. \n3    Moreover, Los Angeles has vigorously objected to the entry of a nationwide \n4  injunction in an analogous situation.  In Texas v. United States, the Fifth Circuit \n5  affirmed a nationwide injunction against programs allowing certain aliens to remain \n6  in the United States.  809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015).  In an amicus brief filed with \n7  the Supreme Court, Los Angeles and other jurisdictions urged the Court to vacate \n8  the injunction because the plaintiffs had failed “to establish injury sufficient to \n9  enjoin the [programs] nationwide.”  See Brief for Amici Curiae, United States v. \n10  Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (No. 15-674), 2016 WL 891345, at *20 (Attachment \n11  3 hereto).  The City and its fellow amici argued that, to justify “an expansive \n12  nationwide injunction,” the plaintiffs there would have to “establish standing to \n13  justify the scope of the injunction.”  Id. at *19, *30.  In this case, the plaintiff has \n14  not even attempted to establish standing to seek a nationwide injunction against the \n      \n15  use of immigration-related factors in the COPS Hiring Program.  By its own \n16  arguments, any injunction herein should be limited to Los Angeles. \n17  CONCLUSION \n18    For the above reasons and for those stated in Defendants’ Motion for Partial \n19  Summary Judgment, judgment should be entered for the defendants on Counts \n20  Four, Five, and Six of plaintiff’s Complaint.   \n21  Dated:  February 8, 2018 \n \n22 \n              Respectfully submitted, \n23   \n              CHAD A.

No. 83), filed \n18  on July 18, 2018.  Having been thoroughly briefed by both parties, this Court took the matter \n19  under submission on September 12, 2018.  \n20  The federal grant at issue is awarded by the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \n21  Grant Program (the “Byrne JAG grant”).  This grant supports state and local law enforcement \n22  efforts by providing additional funds for personnel, equipment, training, and other criminal justice \n23  needs.  34 U.S.C. § 10152.  The Byrne JAG grant is a formula grant meaning the funds are \n24  awarded according to a formula provided by statute based on the state’s population and rate of \n25  violent crime.  34 U.S.C. § 10156.  Plaintiff City of Los Angeles has been a recipient of the Byrne \n26  JAG grant every year since 1997, and each year has received more than $1 million in funding.  In \n27  2017, Defendant Attorney General announced immigration compliance requirements that the \n28  Bureau of Justice Assistance (“BJA”) would be imposing on Byrne JAG applicants to render  \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 93   Filed 09/13/18   Page 2 of 5   Page ID #:2922\n1  certain jurisdictions ineligible for funds if they did not change their policies and operations.  The \n2  announcement explained that, “[f]rom now on, the Department will only provide Byrne JAG \n3  grants to cities and states that comply with federal law, allow federal immigration access to \n4  detention facilities [“Access Condition”], and provide 40 hours’ notice before they release an \n5  illegal alien wanted by federal authorities [“Notice Condition”].”  The conditions at issue here are \n6  the Access Condition and Notice Condition.  Plaintiff City of Los Angeles has not changed its \n7  policies and operations, and as a result has not received Byrne JAG funding for the 2017 fiscal \n8  year.  Now before this Court, Plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Access and \n9  Notice Conditions imposed by Defendants upon the Byrne JAG grant.  \n10  A preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \n11  clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, \n \n \n12  Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  A party is entitled to injunctive relief upon a showing that: (1) it is \n13  likely to succeed on the merits, (2) it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n14  preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in the moving party’s favor, and (4) an \n15  injunction is in the public interest.  Id. at 20.  This Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to a \n16  preliminary injunction. \n17    First, the Court must determine the likelihood that Plaintiff will succeed on the merits.  An \n18  agency “has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”  Louisiana \n19  Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. F.C.C., 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  Moreover, Congress may delegate \n20  authority and discretion to the Executive Branch through statute.  See Whitman v. Am. Trucking \n21  Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 489 (2001).  But, if an agency “act[s] improperly . . . what they do is ultra \n22  vires.”  City of Arlington, Tex. v. F.C.C., 569 U.S. 290, 291 (2013).  Therefore, we must look to \n23  the statute itself to determine whether Congress has conveyed authority to the Attorney General to \n24  impose conditions on the Byrne JAG grant.  “If the statutory language is unambiguous, in the \n25  absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be \n26  regarded as conclusive.”  Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 20 (1983).  \n27    Here, the Byrne JAG program is codified at 34 U.S.C. §§ 10151-10158.  The authority \n28  explicitly granted to the Attorney General within the Byrne JAG statute is limited.  The statute \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 93   Filed 09/13/18   Page 3 of 5   Page ID #:2923\n1  provides that the Attorney General is authorized to determine the “form” of the application, 34 \n2  U.S.C. § 10153(a); “reasonably require . . . the applicant [to] maintain and report . . . data, records, \n3  and information (programmatic and financial),” 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(4); and “develop \n4  guidelines” for “a program assessment . . . in coordination with the National Institute of Justice,” \n5  34 U.S.C. § 10152(c)(1).  The language of the statutes gives no indication that DOJ is authorized \n6  to add civil immigration conditions to those just mentioned.  Although Congress granted the \n7  Attorney General the power to carry out very limited actions, it did not “grant the Attorney \n8  General the authority to impose conditions that require states or local governments to assist in \n9  immigration enforcement, nor to deny funds to states or local governments for the failure to \n10  comply with those conditions.”  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 284.  (7th Cir. 2018).   \n11  To further show that the program is not to be administered according to the Attorney \n \n \n12  General’s discretion, Congress structured the Byrne JAG program as a formula grant.  34 U.S.C. \n13  §§ 10151-58.  And formula grants “are not awarded at the discretion of a state or federal agency, \n14  but are awarded pursuant to a statutory formula.”  City of Los Angeles v. McLaughlin, 865 F.2d \n15  1084, 1088 (9th Cir. 1989).  The statutory formula requires the Attorney General to give 50% of \n16  available funds to each State in proportion to its population, with the remaining 50% to be given to \n17  each State in proportion to its violent crime rate.  34 U.S.C. §10156(a).  As stated above, the \n18  authority granted to the Attorney General within the Byrne JAG statute regarding distribution of \n19  funds is extremely limited and leaves little room for discretion.  \n20    The only argument presented by DOJ in other cases to support its theory that it has \n21  authority to impose the Notice and Access Conditions is 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6).  This provision \n22  of the statute states that the Assistant Attorney General “shall . . . exercise such other powers and \n23  functions as may be vested in the Assistant Attorney General pursuant to this chapter or by \n24  delegation of the Attorney General, including special conditions on all grants, and determining \n25  priority purposes for formula grants.”  34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6) (emphasis added).  However, § \n26  10102(a)(6) must be viewed in its context of the statute as a whole, rather than as an isolated \n27  provision.  Viewed in context, the provision allows the Attorney General to delegate powers to the \n28  Assistant Attorney General to aid in administering the Office of Justice Programs, whereas the \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 93   Filed 09/13/18   Page 4 of 5   Page ID #:2924\n1  Byrne JAG grant is a Bureau of Justice Assistance Program that is codified in a different \n2  subchapter of Chapter 101 and isolated from other discretionary grants within its own subchapter.  \n3  Reading § 10102(a)(6) to authorize the Attorney General to impose conditions on all grants under \n4  the entire chapter contradicts the explicit grants of authority in other sections of the statute.  \n5  Here, the Notice and Access Conditions exceed statutory authority, and trying to impose \n6  such conditions is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine and ultra vires.  Further, \n7  because Congress did not authorize the Attorney General to impose such conditions, this Court \n8  finds it unnecessary to determine whether the conditions violate the Spending Clause or the \n9  Administrative Procedure Act.  Therefore, regarding the Notice and Access Conditions, Los \n10  Angeles has shown a likelihood of success on the merits. \n11    Next, the Court must assess the possibility of irreparable injury to Plaintiff in the absence \n \n \n12  of injunctive relief.  Irreparable injury must be more than merely speculative in order to warrant a \n13  preliminary injunction.  See Herb Reed Enters., LLC v. Florida Entm’t Mgmt., Inc., 736 F.3d \n14  1239, 1249 (9th Cir. 2013).   \n15  Here, Plaintiff has made a showing of harm that is sufficient to meet the second element of \n16  the Winter test.  While Los Angeles makes many arguments as to how it will suffer irreparable \n17  injury absent an injunction, this Court finds most persuasive its argument that it is faced with an \n18  impossible choice: either it must certify compliance with unconstitutional and unlawful directives \n19  that impinge on the City’s sovereignty, damage community trust, and harm public safety, or it will \n20  lose congressionally authorized Byrne JAG funding.  See City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. \n21  Supp. 3d 933, 950 (N.D. Ill. 2017) (“[A] ‘Hobson’s choice’ can establish irreparable harm.”).  By \n22  agreeing to participate in federal civil immigration efforts in order to receive Byrne JAG funds, \n23  Los Angeles would have to compromise its longstanding policy that involving LAPD in civil \n24  immigration enforcement diminishes community trust and undermines public safety.  Like the \n25  Seventh Circuit held in City of Chicago v. Sessions, some localities “may see such cooperation as \n26  impeding the community relationships necessary to identify and solve crimes.”  888 F.3d 272, 282 \n27  (7th Cir. 2018).  “The harm to the City’s relationship with the immigrant community if it should \n28  accede to the conditions is irreparable.”  City of Chicago, 264 F. Supp. 3d at 950.  In addition, Los \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 93   Filed 09/13/18   Page 5 of 5   Page ID #:2925\n1  Angeles is irreparably harmed because the conditions deprive it of Byrne JAG funding for the \n2  2017 fiscal year, meaning it is barred from receiving a funding opportunity which it has been, and \n3  otherwise would be, entitled to based on Congress’ statutory formula.  Therefore, Plaintiff has \n4  made a showing of irreparable harm.  \n5    Finally, Plaintiff must show that the balance of equities tips in its favor and that a \n6  preliminary injunction is in the public interest.  Denying the preliminary injunction in this case \n7  would cause substantial hardship to Plaintiff, which would be faced with the choice of acceding to \n8  DOJ’s unlawful conditions or being deprived of significant funding needed for its local law \n9  enforcement efforts.  Ultimately, the public interest is better served if the City is not forced to \n10  choose between foregoing the Byrne JAG grant funds and losing its rapport with the immigrant \n11  community.  Defendants argue that the conditions promote operational efficiency and are \n \n \n12  authorized by federal law, but as explained above, the conditions imposed are ultra vires.  As \n13  stated by the Ninth Circuit, it is “always in the public interest” to issue an injunction to “prevent \n14  the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.” Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. \n15  2012).  Accordingly, this Court finds that balancing the equities and weighing the public interest \n16  tips the scale in favor of Plaintiff, and thus, Plaintiff in entitled to a preliminary injunction.    \n17  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff’s Application for Preliminary Injunction is \n18  GRANTED.

They are intimately familiar with \nthe challenges of performing critical law enforcement and governance functions in \ncommunities where immigrants fear the police and are vulnerable to exploitation and \ncrime. Amici represent jurisdictions from across the country that understand the \nchallenges of balancing local community needs and public safety. \n Amici’s experience in keeping their communities safe has underscored the \ncritical importance of bringing immigrants and their families “out of the shadows.” \nCommunity trust and cooperation are essential to public safety, and sound police \nwork as well as successful prosecutorial efforts are undermined by undocumented \nimmigrants’ fears of interacting with law enforcement and the justice system. This \ndynamic, moreover, leaves undocumented immigrants more vulnerable to crime and \nexploitation, and undocumented immigrant victims less likely to come forward or \ncooperate with investigations and prosecutions, leading to more violence in the \n                            \n1 The parties have consented to the filing of this brief. No counsel for a party \nauthored this brief in whole or in part, and no party or counsel for a party made a \nmonetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. \nNo person other than amici curiae or their counsel made a monetary contribution to \nthis brief’s preparation or submission. \n1  \n\n \ncommunities amici are charged with protecting.  \nBefore the permanent injunction issued in this case, the Department of Justice \nhad in 2017 begun rewarding jurisdictions that partnered with federal immigration \nauthorities in deciding who would receive grants from its Office of Community \nOriented Policing Services (COPS). For fiscal year 2017, DOJ added a focus area \ncalled “Illegal Immigration,” and it encouraged COPS applicants to sign a \n“Certification of Illegal Immigration Cooperation.” Applicants could not complete \nthis certification without pledging to provide federal immigration agents with \nunlimited access to detention facilities to inquire about immigration status, and to \nnotify the Department of Homeland Security as soon as practicable before releasing \nan alien in the jurisdiction’s custody.  \nAmici believe that these inducements would dangerously impact local \ncommunities by requiring jurisdictions to prioritize civil immigration enforcement \nover public safety or else lose funding for important public safety and community \ninitiatives. These requirements would cause community members to distrust the \npolice and justice system officials and thereby result in a decrease in cooperation, \nhindering the ability of local law enforcement and local prosecutors to keep their \ncommunities safe. The conditions would also drain scarce resources that would \notherwise be used to enhance public safety, depriving local law enforcement and \njustice system leaders of the discretion necessary to determine how best to protect \n2  \n\n \ntheir communities. Local officials are in the best position to know what policing and \nlaw enforcement policies are most effective for their communities.   \nJurisdictions across the country rely heavily on COPS grants to support \nprograms related to law enforcement. In particular, the COPS Hiring Program \nprovides essential funding for career law enforcement officers hired to enhance \ncommunity policing and crime prevention. Amici believe that the injunction issued by \nthe District Court is necessary to halt the Justice Department’s attempt to force local \nlaw enforcement officers and agencies to engage in practices detrimental to public \nsafety. \nA full list of amici is attached as Exhibit A.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe lessons amici have learned in protecting their communities shed important \nlight on the issues raised in this case. When community residents live in constant fear \nthat interactions with local law enforcement officials could result in deportation, there \nis a fundamental breakdown in trust that threatens public safety and impedes justice \nsystem leaders from doing their jobs. Extensive evidence shows that undocumented \nimmigrants—and their lawfully present family and neighbors—fear that turning to the \npolice and cooperating with prosecutors could bring adverse immigration \nconsequences. As a result, immigrant communities are less willing to report crimes \nand cooperate with criminal investigations and prosecutions. This fundamental \nbreakdown in trust poses a major challenge to the investigation and prosecution of \n3  \n\n \nindividual crimes and to the proper allocation of public safety resources.  \nCurrent policies limiting local and state involvement in federal immigration \nenforcement address this issue of trust. Though they take several different forms, \nthese policies generally aim to preserve local and state resources and improve public \nsafety by promoting cooperation between law enforcement and the communities they \nserve.2 Many jurisdictions—whether via ordinance, administrative policy, or state \nlaw—limit the degree to which their officials may, for example, cooperate with ICE \ndetainers.3 The Justice Department’s newly devised considerations for awarding \nCOPS grants would upend these policies, to the detriment of community safety. The \naccess and notification requirements, in particular, seek to compel local jurisdictions \nto take part in federal immigration enforcement. Cities and counties would be forced \nto choose between building trust with immigrant communities and enhancing public \nsafety on one hand, and potentially losing vital federal funds on the other. The federal \ngovernment cannot force local law enforcement into such a Hobson’s choice. \n \n                            \n2 See Oversight of the Administration’s Misdirected Immigration Enforcement Policies: Examining \nthe Impact of Public Safety and Honoring the Victims: Hearing Before the S.

Trust and Respect Between Communities and Law Enforcement \nOfficials Are Essential to Public Safety and Are Thwarted When \nVictims and Witnesses Fear Deportation Consequences of \nCooperating.  \n \nThe experience of policing cities across the country has taught law enforcement \nofficers that, “[t]o do our job, we must have the trust and respect of the communities \nwe serve.”4 In order to stop crime, police officers “need the full cooperation of victims \nand witnesses.”5 \nThis common-sense philosophy is sometimes called “community policing.” As \nthe District Court below recognized, community policing is an approach to policing \nwhereby local law enforcement engages communities in a working partnership to \nreduce crime and promote public safety.6 It thus requires police to interact with \nneighborhood residents in a manner that will build trust and improve the level of \ncooperation with the police department.7 When that relationship of trust is missing—\nas it is when people believe that contacting police or cooperating with prosecutors \ncould lead to deportation for themselves or others—community policing breaks down \n                            \n4 Statement of Tom Manger, supra note 2, at 2. \n5 Id. \n6 See Anita Khashu, The Role Of Local Police: Striking a Balance Between Immigration \nEnforcement and Civil Liberties, Police Found. (Apr. 2009), available at https://www. \npolicefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Role-of-Local-Police-\nNarrative.pdf. \n7 Id. \n \n5  \n\n \nand the entire community is harmed. \nAccording to a recent Pew survey, 67 percent of Hispanic immigrants and 47 \npercent of all Hispanic adults in the United States worry about deportation—of \nthemselves, family members, or close friends.8 This fear necessarily affects \ncooperation and communication with police and prosecutors. Immigrants—and their \nfamily members and neighbors who may be U.S. citizens or lawfully present—often \nassume that interaction with law enforcement officials could have adverse \nconsequences for themselves or a loved one.  \nAs a result, immigrant communities in general, and undocumented immigrants \nin particular, are less likely to trust and cooperate with local police and prosecutors. \nOne survey of Latinos in four major cities found that 70 percent of undocumented \nimmigrants and 44 percent of all Latinos would be less likely to contact law \nenforcement authorities if they were victims of a crime for fear that the police would \nask them or people they know about their immigration status; and 67 percent of \nundocumented immigrants and 45 percent of all Latinos would be less likely to \nvoluntarily offer information about, or report, crimes because of the same fear.9 \n                            \n8 Latinos and the New Trump Administration, Pew Research Ctr.: Hispanic Trends, Feb. \n23, 2017, http://www.pewhispanic.org/2017/02/23/latinos-and-the-new-trump-\nadministration/. \n9 Nik Theodore, Insecure Communities: Latino Perceptions of Police Involvement in Immigration \nEnforcement 5–6 (May 2013), available at www.policylink.org/sites/default/files/ \nINSECURE_COMMUNITIES_REPORT_FINAL.PDF; see also id. at 1 (“Survey \nresults indicate that the greater involvement of police in immigration enforcement has \n \n6  \n\n \nThese studies (among others) highlight that fears of immigration enforcement \nand the resulting damage to law enforcement cooperation affect not just \nundocumented community members but also individuals with citizenship or lawful \nstatus, particularly in “mixed-status” households.10  \nThis problematic atmosphere of mistrust is felt by police as well. In one study, \ntwo-thirds of the law enforcement officers polled expressed the view that recent \nimmigrants reported crimes less frequently than others.11 Those surveyed also \nindicated that the crimes underreported by immigrants are most often serious ones, \nwith domestic violence and gang violence at the top.12 These trends have only \nworsened in recent months. According to the Houston Police Department, rape \nreporting by members of the Hispanic community fell over 40 percent from the first \nquarter of 2016 to the same period in 2017, despite an overall increase in city-wide \n                            \nsignificantly heightened the fears many Latinos have of the police, . . . exacerbating \ntheir mistrust of law enforcement authorities.”). \n10 An estimated 85 percent of immigrants live in mixed-status families. See Khashu, \nsupra note 6, at 24; see also Jill Theresa Messing et al., Latinas’ Perceptions of Law \nEnforcement: Fear of Deportation, Crime Reporting, and Trust in the System, 30 J. Women & \nSoc. Work 328, 334 (2015) (“The results indicate that for each 1-point increase in fear \nof deportation [e.g., from ‘not much’ to ‘some’ worry, or from ‘some’ to ‘a lot’], Latina \nparticipants were 15% less willing to report being victim of a violent crime to \npolice.”).   \n11 Robert C.

And the reason they’re afraid of us is \nbecause they think we’re going to deport them.”15 Philadelphia Police Commissioner \nRichard Ross recently echoed these concerns in sworn testimony.16 \nImmigrants’ widely recognized fear of interacting with law enforcement and \nprosecutors poses a fundamental challenge for community policing. Police cannot \nprevent or solve crimes if victims or witnesses are unwilling to talk to them or \nprosecutors because of concerns that they, their loved ones, or their neighbors will \nface adverse immigration consequences.

In a recent national survey, a majority of \nparticipating law enforcement officers reported that such barriers to cooperation have \n“le[d] to greater numbers of perpetrators at large,”21 thereby threatening officer safety \nand the safety of entire communities.22 As one official explained, when criminal \nbehavior goes unreported, “[c]rime multiplies,” and “[u]nresolved resentments grow \nin the community.”23 Another added that the underreporting of crime “keeps fear at \n                            \n17 NIWAP Report, supra note 15, at 101. \n18 Statement of Tom Manger, supra note 2, at 2. \n19 Local Law Enforcement Leaders Oppose Mandates to Engage in Immigration Enforcement, \nNat’l Immigration Law Ctr., at 2 (Aug. 2013) (statement of Chief Acevedo), available at \nhttps://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Law-Enforcement-Opposition-\nto-Mandates-2013-08-30.pdf. \n20 Davis et al., supra note 11, at 188. \n21 NIWAP Report, supra note 15, at 103. \n22 Id. at 104. \n23 Davis et al., supra note 11, at 188. \n \n9  \n\n \nvery high levels and diminishes quality of life.”24 Even beyond the underreporting of \ncrime, undocumented immigrant victims and witnesses may refuse to come to court \nto testify in important criminal cases because of their fear of being detained and \ndeported.  \nThese concerns are anything but hypothetical. Over the past two years, the \ntrends generating such concerns have escalated in ways that threaten long-term harm \nto criminal justice system operations. A Department of Homeland Security official \nrecently illustrated why many immigrants hesitate to cooperate with law enforcement. \nIn a briefing to reporters, he stated that “[j]ust because they’re a victim in a certain \ncase does not mean there’s not something in their background that could cause them \nto be a removable alien.”25 An immigrant woman living in Texas learned that lesson \nall too perversely when she arrived at a courthouse seeking a protective order against \nher abusive boyfriend, only to leave under arrest—likely due to a tip from her \nabuser.26 In August 2017, federal agents detained an undocumented immigrant who \n                            \n24 Id. \n25 Devlin Barrett, DHS: Immigration Agents May Arrest Crime Victims, Witnesses at \nCourthouses, Wash.

Policies Limiting Local and State Involvement in Federal \nImmigration Enforcement Are Critical to Building and \nMaintaining Trust Between the Community and Law Enforcement \nWhile Preserving Local Resources. \n \nIn limiting local and state involvement in federal immigration enforcement, \nmany jurisdictions aim to enhance community trust and preserve local resources. \nThese policies improve public safety by promoting cooperation between law \nenforcement and the communities they serve. \nSome administrative policies or laws include formal restrictions on local law \nenforcement’s ability to apprehend or arrest an individual for federal immigration \nviolations, including restrictions on arrests for civil violations of federal immigration \nlaw.46 Other policies include restrictions on local law enforcement inquiries or \n                            \n44 Reina, Lohman, & Maldonado, supra note 42, at 600. \n45 Nawal H.

For example, complying with ICE detainer requests can add staggering \n                            \nequipment or personnel for the purpose of detecting or apprehending persons whose \nonly violation of law is that they are persons of foreign citizenship present in the \nUnited States in violation of federal immigration laws.”); Washington, DC, Mayor’s \nOrder 2011-174: Disclosure of Status of Individuals: Policies and Procedures of \nDistrict of Columbia Agencies, at 2 (Oct. 19, 2011) (“No person shall be detained \nsolely on the belief that he or she is not present legally in the United States or that he \nor she has committed a civil immigration violation.”), available at https://www.scribd. \ncom/document/69470234/Disclosure-Status-of-Individuals-D-C  [hereinafter DC \nOrder]; Phoenix, AZ, Police Dep’t Operations Order Manual, at 1.4 (Jan. 2011) (“The \ninvestigation and enforcement of federal laws relating to illegal entry and residence in \nthe United States is specifically assigned to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nwithin DHS].”), available at https://www.phoenix.gov/policesite/Documents/ \n089035.pdf; see also Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1001 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[The \nsheriff] may not detain individuals solely because of unlawful presence.”).  \n47 See, e.g., DC Order, supra note 46 (public safety employees “shall not inquire about a \nperson’s immigration status . . . for the purpose of initiating civil enforcement of \nimmigration proceedings that have no nexus to a criminal investigation”). \n48 Garcia & Manuel, supra note 46, at 14. \n49 See Cal.

Communities carefully allocate \nresources such as funds, training, and officer duties to serve local law enforcement \nneeds most effectively; forced redistribution to immigration enforcement would \nsiphon limited resources away from where they are most needed while simultaneously \ndamaging community engagement and protection.51  \nRecent incidents in localities with policies limiting local involvement in federal \nimmigration enforcement demonstrate the public safety benefits of such policies. For \nexample, in 2016, Los Angeles Police Department officers had an encounter with a \nsuspected gang member that resulted in a vehicle chase, a foot pursuit, and shots \nfired. An undocumented immigrant helped police to locate the suspect by providing a \ndescription and vehicle information.52 In Tucson, Arizona, an undocumented man \nconfronted and struggled with a man who tried to steal a car with children inside.

Awarding COPS grants in this way would also deter \nother communities from adopting trust-enhancing policies in the future. In short, \nforcing grantee jurisdictions to entangle themselves further with federal immigration \nenforcement would send a dangerous signal to witnesses and victims within \nimmigrant communities: cooperate with local law enforcement at your own risk. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, as well as the reasons set forth in Plaintiff-\nAppellee’s brief, this Court should affirm the District Court’s grant of a permanent \n                            \n53 Id.  \n54 Tom K.

The number of eligible \napplicants exceeds annual appropriations for the program, and, because the governing \nstatute establishes only a few general guideposts for allocating funds, the COPS \nOffice has exercised broad discretion in establishing funding priorities for the limited \nfederal dollars available.  The Office has developed a scoring system which analyzes \nthe robustness of each proposal and which assigns additional points based on policy \npriorities.  For example, the COPS Office has prioritized funding for jurisdictions that \nsuffer “catastrophic events” (such as a terror attack or a mass shooting) and for \njurisdictions with high crime rates.  \nThe Office has also encouraged jurisdictions to design community-oriented \npolicing programs that fit into one of a number of designated “focus areas” that \nreflect the Department’s law enforcement priorities.  These priorities, of course, \nchange over time, consistent with changes in national law enforcement and public \nsafety needs.  For example, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, “Homeland Security” \nbecame a much more pressing federal law enforcement priority, and thus the CHP \nhas included that as a focus area.  Likewise, in the wake of tragic school shootings, \n \n\nschool safety is a national law enforcement priority, and thus CHP has included \n“School Resource Officers” as a focus area.  In the wake of high-profile police \nshootings and follow-on protests, police-community relations is a national law \nenforcement priority, and thus CHP has included “Building Trust” as a focus area.  \nSee infra at 7, 18.  None of these focus areas—reflective of Department policy \npreferences—has ever been the subject of objection by applicants, Congress, or \nfederal courts.   \nIn 2017, the Department included another focus area that is consistent with \nfederal law enforcement priorities, as established by Congress.  Namely, CHP \nincluded “Illegal Immigration” as a focus area, and also indicated that it would assign \nadditional points to jurisdictions that facilitate the transfer of aliens subject to \ndeportation proceedings to federal custody upon their release from jail. \nThe district court recognized that the COPS Office necessarily has discretion to \nestablish priorities in order to evaluate competing applications.  It nevertheless held \nthat including Illegal Immigration as a focus area exceeds the Office’s statutory \nauthority.  The court, however, fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the CHP \nprogram.  Community-oriented policing is a strategy that can be applied in a wide \nrange of contexts, and all grant applications, regardless of their focus area, must be \nrooted in the broad principles of community-oriented policing.  Nothing in the statute \ndivests the COPS Office of the discretion to prioritize certain law enforcement goals \nto be achieved through community-oriented policing.  Nor does the statute preclude \n2 \n \n\nthe COPS Office from giving some weight to a jurisdiction’s willingness to assist in an \norderly transfer of custody.  The decision below would change all that and would, if \nadopted here, severely curtail the Department of Justice’s longstanding discretion to \nadminister this program. \nThe district court’s ruling rested on grounds that would seem to invalidate \nvirtually every other discretionary basis the Department has used to administer this \nprogram.  That constrained interpretation is clearly not what Congress intended, as \nthe statutory text and the Department’s long history administering this program \nconfirm.  Nor is it what the Constitution requires, or else every discretionary grant \nprogram where Congress fails to explicate every potential basis for prioritizing \nfunding is equally impermissible.  The district court’s decision was incorrect on all \ncounts.  It should be reversed. \nSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION \nPlaintiff invoked the district court’s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  On \nApril 11, 2018, the district court granted partial summary judgment on three counts in \nplaintiff’s complaint and entered a permanent injunction as to those counts.  ER 8, 10, \n11, 13.  The government filed a timely notice of appeal on May 4, 2018.  ER 14-15; see \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES \nThe Department of Justice administers a discretionary law enforcement grant \nprogram that provides funds to localities to hire or rehire officers for deployment in \n3 \n \n\ncommunity-oriented policing.  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b).  Because Congress annually \nappropriates less in funds than jurisdictions seek under the program and has not laid \nout specific criteria for selecting applicants, the Department has developed a variety of \nscoring factors to assess applications.  Los Angeles challenges two scoring factors \nintroduced in the fiscal year 2017 grant cycle relating to a jurisdiction’s cooperation \nwith federal efforts to enforce the immigration laws by removing aliens who have \ncommitted crimes from the country.  The issues presented are: \nWhether the district court erred in holding that Department was not acting \nwithin its delegated discretion in considering the immigration-related scoring factors. \nWhether the district court erred in holding that consideration of immigration-\nrelated factors contravened the Spending Clause.  \nPERTINENT STATUTES AND REGULATIONS \nPertinent statutes are reproduced in the addendum to this brief. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA.  Statutory Background \nThe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. \n103-322, tit. I, § 10003(a), 108 Stat. 1796, 1808, provides the Department of Justice \nwith authority to make discretionary grants for a variety of statutory purposes related \nto public safety and community-oriented policing.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b).  To \nadminister these grants, the Department has created the Office of Community \nOriented Policing Services (COPS Office).  The COPS Office manages the \n4 \n \n\napplication process for a variety of grants provided for in the statute, including the \nCOPS Hiring Program (CHP), which provides localities with funds to hire or rehire \nlaw enforcement officers “for deployment in community-oriented policing.”  Id. \n§ 10381(b)(1), (2).  The statute does not define “community-oriented policing.” \nThe CHP receives applications for more funds than Congress annually \nappropriates, and the application process is thus competitive.  The statute sets forth \nsome parameters for that process.  It mandates that jurisdictions in all states receive \nsome funding as long as eligible applications are submitted, see 34 U.S.C. § 10381(f), \nthat available funds be divided equally between large and small jurisdictions, see id. \n§ 10381(h), and that, unless waived, jurisdictions contribute a certain amount of their \nown funds in addition to the grant money used to hire or rehire an officer funded by \nthe CHP, see id. § 10381(g).  The statute also states that the Attorney General may \n“give preferential consideration” to applications that provide more than the \nmandatory minimum local contribution to the hiring or rehiring of an officer, see id. \n§ 10381(c)(1), or to applications where the applicant is from a state that has certain \nlaws in place to combat human trafficking, see id. § 10381(c)(2), (3). \nBecause these factors alone are insufficient to distinguish among the many \napplicants for CHP funds, the COPS Office has developed a multi-factor weighted \nscoring system to assess applications on the basis of a “point” score.  ER 20-23, \n¶¶ 12-19.  Applicants are first scored on a variety of individual factors.  ER 21, ¶ 15.  \nThe scores on the various factors are then grouped into three categories—Fiscal \n5 \n \n\nHealth, Crime, and Community Policing—and the aggregate score in each category is \nweighted to produce a final score by which jurisdictions are ranked.  ER 23, ¶ 20.  \nCHP funds are then distributed according to this ranking and the requirements spelled \nout in 34 U.S.C. § 10381(f)-(h).  ER 23, ¶ 21. \nThe scoring factors employed in this process are wide-ranging, reflecting the \nbroad purposes of the community-oriented policing program, changing law \nenforcement needs, and the priorities of the Department of Justice.  For example, \napplicants are required to submit data on local crime statistics, and jurisdictions with \nhigher crime rates receive more points in the scoring process.  ER 21, ¶ 16.  Similarly, \napplicants must submit data about their financial condition, and jurisdictions with \ngreater financial need receive additional points.  Id.  Applicants are likewise scored on \nthe quality of the community-oriented policing plan they submit.  Id. \nOther factors have been developed in response to law enforcement needs.  The \nCOPS Office began providing bonus points to jurisdictions that have experienced a \n“catastrophic event,” such as a terrorist attack or mass shooting, a decision that \nreflected concerns that arose when the Department was unable to award a grant to \nNewtown, Connecticut after it suffered a mass shooting.  ER 22, ¶ 18.  These bonus \npoints resulted in an award of a CHP grant to San Bernardino, California, the year \nafter a terrorist attack there.  Id.  In addition, the application accords additional points \nfor adopting specified internal management practices, such as ensuring flexibility in \nofficer shift assignments, assessing employee satisfaction, and using an “early \n6 \n \n\nintervention system” to identify and assist officers who may be under particular strain.  \nId. \nSince the fiscal year 2011 grant process, the COPS Office has given extra \npoints to applications that promise to use funding to support designated “focus \nareas.”  ER 18, ¶ 7; ER 22, ¶ 18.  These focus areas enable the Department to \nprioritize community-oriented policing in certain areas, and for each focus area, the \napplicant must explain how its proposal will “incorporate the principles of community \noriented policing.”  ER 18, ¶ 7.  For the fiscal year 2017 CHP, the COPS Office \nidentified nine focus areas.  Id.  For example, applicants could choose the “Drug \nAbuse” focus area, offering a proposal that explained how the applicant planned to \nuse community-oriented policing principles “to combat drug use and abuse.”  ER 18-\n19, ¶ 8.  Similarly, applicants could tailor their plans to use CHP funds to address \n“Homeland Security Problems,” including “addressing threats against facilities” and \ndeveloping “criminal intelligence capacity.”  Id.  \nNone of these aspects of the application and screening process—the many \nscoring factors, the several focus areas—are spelled out in the statute.  Instead, the \nCOPS Office has long exercised, within the CHP, the discretion that is inherent in \ndiscretionary grants.  In connection with the fiscal year 2017 CHP applications, the \nCOPS Office included a focus area for “Illegal Immigration.”  The CHP application \nasked jurisdictions selecting this focus area to “specify your focus on partnering with \nfederal law enforcement to combat illegal immigration through information sharing, \n7 \n \n\n287(g) partnerships [see 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)], task forces and honoring detainers.”  ER \n24, ¶ 24.  Applicants selecting this focus area, like applicants selecting other focus \nareas, were required to explain how their proposal would “incorporate the principles \nof community-oriented policing.”  ER 18, ¶ 7.  This focus area was designed to \nfacilitate greater cooperation between localities and the federal government in efforts \nto reduce crime by removing from the country aliens who have committed, or are \nsuspected of committing, criminal offenses.  Applicants who selected this focus area, \nlike applicants choosing the “Violent Crime Problems” or “Homeland Security \nProblems” focus areas, received additional points for that selection.  ER 22, ¶ 18. \nThe COPS Office similarly offered jurisdictions applying for a fiscal year 2017 \nCHP grant the opportunity to receive bonus points if they certified that they had in \nplace, or would implement, policies designed to assist federal law enforcement \nauthorities by 1) permitting officials from the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) access to the applicant’s correctional or detention facilities to meet with a \ngiven detainee and “inquire as to his or her right to be or to remain in the United \nStates,” and 2) providing advance notice to DHS of “the scheduled release date and \ntime of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order \nto take custody of the alien.”  ER 24-25, ¶ 25. \nThe cooperation envisioned by these two new scoring factors reflects the \nstructure of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which ties certain triggering \nevents in the removal process to an alien’s involvement in state criminal proceedings \n8 \n \n\nand release from state custody.  For example, Congress has mandated that certain \naliens who have committed criminal offenses be taken into federal custody pending \nremoval proceedings, but only “when the alien is released” from state custody.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1226(c)(1).  Similarly, with respect to incarcerated aliens subject to a final \nremoval order, the INA establishes a “removal period” of 90 days that begins with the \ndate of the alien’s release.  Id. § 1231(a)(1)(B).  Many jurisdictions already provide this \nbasic level of cooperation to federal immigration authorities; indeed, a substantial \nproportion of applicants availed themselves of the bonus points.  ER 27, ¶ 33. \nB.  Factual Background & Prior Proceedings \nLos Angeles brought this suit in August 2017.  As relevant here, the City’s \ncomplaint asserted that the new scoring factors—the Illegal Immigration focus area \nand the bonus points for immigration cooperation—were ultra vires, ran afoul of \nSpending Clause and Tenth Amendment constraints, and were arbitrary and \ncapricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).1  The \ndistrict court entered summary judgment for Los Angeles and a permanent injunction \nbarring use of the focus area and bonus points in scoring CHP applications.   \n                                                 \n1 Los Angeles’s suit also challenged conditions placed on the Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grant, an unrelated grant program administered by a \ndifferent Department of Justice component.  Proceedings on those counts are \ncurrently in abeyance pending litigation developments in other courts.  See Dkt. No. \n77. \n9 \n \n\nOn the merits of Los Angeles’s claims, the court held that the COPS Office \nlacks the statutory authority to use the scoring factors at issue.  ER 6.  The court first \ndeclared that the list of enumerated factors in 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c) that allow the \nAttorney General to provide certain applicants with preferential treatment “must be \nread to exclude others” because reading it as nonexclusive would “effectively render[] \nsubsection (c) superfluous.”  ER 6-7.  At the same time, however, the court \nrecognized that these specific factors did not preclude the Attorney General from \nexercising discretion to “select applicants with programs that best embody the \nstatutory purpose of the CHP grant.”  ER 7.  The court nevertheless held that the \nDepartment could not award points to applications in the Illegal Immigration area, \nand also held that the Department could not assign points to jurisdictions that \ncooperate with the federal government with respect to aliens in state or local custody \nwho are subject to removal proceedings.  The court declared its view that cooperation \nto ensure that aliens subject to removal do not return to the community upon \ncompletion of a criminal sentence cannot “improve cooperative efforts” between \npolice and the community, and advances only “policing generally,” not “community \npolicing.”  ER 8. \nThe court further held that the Department had not provided “a ‘reasonable \nbasis’ for imposing” the scoring factors, ER 10, and had therefore acted arbitrarily and \ncapriciously.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The court stated that the Department’s \n10 \n \n\nrationale—that removing criminals from the community reduces crime and improves \npublic safety—was not “based . . . on any findings or data.”  ER 10. \nThe court also concluded that the scoring factors ran afoul of Spending Clause \nconstraints.  The court first held that “Congress did not unambiguously condition \nreceipt of a CHP grant on local compliance with federal authorities.”  ER 9.  Second, \nit believed that the scoring factors “are not ‘reasonably related’ to the articulated goal \nof the COPS program,” which is “about developing partnerships between local \nauthorities and the community.”  Id. \nBased on these conclusions, the district court entered a permanent injunction \nbarring the Department of Justice from using the scoring factors in future CHP grant \ncycles.  ER 13.  The district court did not discuss how, under its holding, any of the \nother scoring factors or focus areas that have long been a part of the CHP could be \nupheld.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA.  This case concerns the administration of a law enforcement grant program \nthat provides funds to localities to hire or rehire officers for deployment in \ncommunity-oriented policing.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b).  Beyond some general \nguidelines, Congress has left it to the COPS Office of the Department of Justice to \nestablish criteria and priorities for evaluating grants competing for limited federal \nfunds, as Congress does with many other grant programs.   For many years, the COPS \noffice has undertaken these discretionary determinations on the basis of a scoring \n11 \n \n\nsystem that evaluates the merits of each proposal and also awards additional points \nbased on a variety of factors, including, for example, a district’s crime rate.  The \nCOPS Office has also assigned additional points to proposals to advance community-\noriented policing in areas of special concern, including Homeland Security and violent \ncrime. Congress has been made aware of the grant evaluation procedures in the \nDepartment’s annual budget reports, and we are aware of no instance in which \nCongress or grant applicants questioned the legality of these procedures. \nThat changed with the filing of this suit.  Los Angeles declared that it did not \nplan to file an application in the “Illegal Immigration” focus area, which is one of the \npriority focus areas.  It urged that the COPS Office lacked authority to establish this \npriority and that, indeed, the award of points to community-oriented policing projects \nin this area would violate the Spending Clause.  The City also argued that the COPS \nOffice could not assign extra points to jurisdictions that tell the federal government \nwhen they plan to release prisoners subject to federal removal proceedings or grant \nfederal officials access to prisoners to inquire as to their immigration status.   \nThe district court accepted these arguments in a decision that is by turns \ninconsistent and conclusory.  The court noted that one provision of the statute, \nSection 10381(c), prioritizes jurisdictions that provide greater than 25% matching \nfunds, 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(1), or that have certain laws related to human trafficking, \nid. § 10381(c)(2)-(3).  To establish additional priorities, the court declared, would \nrender section 10381(c) “superfluous.”  ER 6.  Having purported to strike down the \n12 \n \n\nimmigration-related provisions on this ground, however, the district court \nimmediately acknowledged that the statutorily mandated considerations are not, in \nfact, sufficient to allow the COPS Office to determine which jurisdictions should \nreceive grants.  Plainly, the federal government can determine that some areas of \ncommunity-oriented policing are particularly worthy of limited federal dollars.    \nThe district court was on no firmer ground in then singling out illegal \nimmigration as an impermissible priority area, declaring that a focus on illegal \nimmigration matters has “nothing to do” with community-oriented policing.  The \ncourt fundamentally misunderstood the purpose of a focus area and the relation of \nthe focus area to the program as a whole.  The Illegal Immigration focus area, like the \nother focus areas, encourages localities to use their community-oriented policing \nexpertise and knowledge of local conditions to propose community-oriented policing \nprograms that will address pressing public safety needs identified by the Department.  \nChoosing this or any other focus area does not relieve an applicant of the burden to \ndemonstrate that its proposed program “incorporate[s] the principles of community-\noriented policing.”  ER 18, ¶ 7.  Regardless of which focus areas they choose, \napplicants must explain how their proposal will use CHP funds to “reorient the \naffected law enforcement agency’s mission toward community-oriented policing or \nenhance its involvement in or commitment to community-oriented policing,” 34 \nU.S.C. § 10382(c)(10).   \n13 \n \n\nThe COPS Office is entitled to select grant applicants with strong proposals in \nthe area of immigration in the same way that it can select applicants with strong \nproposals in other focus areas, such as homeland security or narcotics.  The district \ncourt offered no basis whatsoever for its belief that the illegal immigration focus area, \nunlike every other, is not compatible with a philosophy of community-oriented \npolicing.  Similarly, in exercising its broad discretion, the COPS Office is not \ncompelled to disregard the degree to which local jurisdictions provide basic \ncooperation to federal officials in removing from the community aliens who have \ncommitted crimes.  The COPS Office was well within its discretion to determine that \nreducing recidivism is an important law enforcement priority that can be well served \nthough a community-oriented policing strategy.  The district court’s conclusion that \nthe scoring factors were arbitrary and capricious rests on the same mistaken premises \nas its statutory analysis, and ignores the common-sense reasoning that underlies the \nDepartment’s determination. \nB.  The district court’s Spending Clause ruling misapprehends the \nconstitutional limits on federal government grant authority.  If, as is the case, the \nDepartment acted within its statutory authority in including the challenged provisions, \nthe Constitution offers no basis for setting the provisions aside.  Congress is not \nrequired to authorize every provision in federal grant programs with a “clear \nstatement.”  On the contrary, Congress frequently delegates discretionary authority \nover distribution of federal funds in Spending Clause legislation to executive branch \n14 \n \n\nagencies without raising constitutional concerns.  There is no requirement that \nCongress spell out every potential restriction on the use of those funds, so long as it \nhas indicated an intent to restrain their use and delegated authority to an agency to set \nappropriate criteria.  See, e.g., Davis v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 650 (1999); \nBennett v. Kentucky Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 669, 672 (1985).   \nThe district court erred in invoking Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991), \nER 5, in which the Supreme Court required a “clear statement” from Congress before \nit would assume that Congress intended to “alter the usual constitutional balance \nbetween the States and the Federal Government.”  Nothing about that “constitutional \nbalance” is at stake here, and the district court was simply wrong to state that the \nscoring factors “requir[e] state and local participation in a historically federal \nfunction.”  ER 6.  The scoring factors envision only forms of cooperation with federal \nimmigration enforcement already permitted by the INA and the Constitution.  They \ndo not override any local law, and localities are free to choose any of the other focus \nareas, decline to qualify for the bonus points, or refuse to apply for CHP funds in the \nfirst place. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe district court’s grant of summary judgment, including its underlying legal \nconclusions, is reviewed de novo.  Davis v. United States, 854 F.3d 594, 598 (9th Cir. \n2017). \n15 \n \n\nARGUMENT \nI.  The Challenged Provisions are Permissible Considerations in \nEvaluating Applications for a Competitive Federal Law \nEnforcement Grant Program  \nA. Under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. \nL. No. 103-322, tit. I, § 10003(a), 108 Stat. at 1808, the Department of Justice is \ncharged with administering law enforcement grant programs related to public safety \nand community-oriented policing, including the COPS Hiring Program (CHP), which \nis designed to provide localities with funds to hire or rehire law enforcement officers \n“for deployment in community-oriented policing.” \nThe COPS Office must exercise significant discretion in administering the \nCHP, as many agencies can and must do when they receive grant appropriations with \nbroad statutory language.  As with many such grants, the governing statute provides \nminimal guidance for distributing funds beyond requirements that are chiefly aimed at \nensuring a broad geographic distribution of funds.  Because the broad statutory \nlanguage constitutes a grant of discretion to the agency, and because the number of \ngrant proposals that satisfy the statute’s eligibility criteria generally exceed the federal \nfunds available, the Department can and must establish priorities for evaluating grant \napplications.  In doing so, the Department considers the specifics of each proposal as \nthey relate to the broad goals of community-oriented policing.  The COPS Office has \nexplained that community-oriented policing reflects a “philosophy” of policing that \n“support[s] the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to \n16 \n \n\nproactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues.”  \nER 53.2 \nThe statute itself reflects the broad nature of community-oriented policing as a \nphilosophy of law enforcement that can be applied in virtually all law-enforcement \nareas, including homeland security.  Section 10381(b) provides an expansive list of \npurposes for which COPS grants may be used to increase the application of \ncommunity-oriented policing strategies, including “pay[ing] for officers hired to \nperform intelligence, anti-terror, or homeland security duties.”  34 U.S.C. \n§ 10381(b)(4).  For this area, like all the others in § 10381(b), Congress required \napplicants to “explain how the grant will be utilized to reorient the affected law \nenforcement agency’s mission toward community-oriented policing or enhance its \ninvolvement in or commitment to community-oriented policing,” id. § 10382(c)(10).  \nCongress thus recognized that homeland security concerns, including immigration, \ncan be addressed through community-oriented policing.  Similarly, the Department is \ninstructed to consider the extent to which applicants have “identif[ied] related \ngovernmental and community initiatives which complement or will be coordinated \n                                                 \n2 The statute does not define community-oriented policing, but the concept is \ngenerally a broad one, as noted in the House Report accompanying the legislation.  See \nH.R. Rep. 103-324 at 8-9 (1993) (“anticipat[ing] and prevent[ing] crime by use of \ncommunity-oriented, problem solving techniques” and “tailoring solutions, based on \nthoughtful, in-depth analysis, to unique neighborhood crime and disorder problems”). \n17 \n \n\nwith the proposal,” id. § 10382(c)(4), which would include cooperation with federal \nimmigration enforcement.    \nIn fulfilling its responsibility to determine which community-oriented policing \nprograms most deserve federal funding, the COPS Office has for many years used a \npoint system to assess applications.  The COPS Office scores applicants based on the \nquality of their community policing plans, ER 21, ¶ 16, and also awards additional \npoints for a range of other factors.  For example, the Office awards additional points \nto jurisdictions with high crime rates, and to jurisdictions that have experienced a \n“catastrophic event” such as a terrorist attack or mass shooting.  Id.  Since the FY \n2011 grant cycle, the Department has also assigned extra points to jurisdictions that \ndesign their community-oriented policing programs to fit into one of a number of \ndesignated “focus areas” that reflect the Department’s law enforcement priorities.  ER \n18, ¶ 7; ER 22, ¶ 18.  In FY 2015, for example, the Department awarded additional \nconsideration to applicants who chose “Building Trust,” “Homeland Security,” \n“Homicide and Gun Violence,” and “School Resource Officers” as their focus areas.  \nSee FY 2015 Award Methodology at 1-2.3 \nThere should be no serious dispute that the COPS Office is entitled to set \npriorities in this fashion.  Congress has not allocated sufficient funding for all eligible \napplicants, nor has Congress provided direction sufficient to select the applicants who \n                                                 \n3 https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2015AwardDocs/chp/2015-CHP-\nMethodology.pdf \n18 \n \n\nwill receive funding.  Instead, Congress has delegated broad authority to the \nDepartment to establish the contours of the CHP.  As the Supreme Court has \nexplained, “[t]he power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally \ncreated and funded program necessarily requires the formulation of policy . . . to fill \nany gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.”  Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 231 \n(1974).  And, as is the case here, the gaps left to the filled in many grant programs can \nbe broad—as they are often established by sparse statutes or no more than a few \nwords in an appropriations line item—but such broad grants of policymaking \nauthority to agencies are common and permissible.  See Whitman v. American Trucking \nAss’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 474-75 (2001) (“[W]e have ‘almost never felt qualified to second-\nguess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to \nthose executing or applying the law.’”) (quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, \n416 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting)). \nThe COPS Office has made Congress aware of its priorities in evaluating \napplications, including its established practice of giving special consideration to \napplications that focus on law enforcement areas of particular concern to the federal \ngovernment.  See, e.g., FY 2017 Performance Budget, Office of Community Oriented \nPolicing Services, at 3 (noting the COPS Office’s practice of having grantees select \n“problem/priority area(s) on which their COPS-funded community policing officers \n19 \n \n\nwill be focused”).4  Congress has annually appropriated money for the CHP and has \nnever suggested that the grant evaluation process departs from the statutory \nframework. \nB.  Congress has clearly identified controlling illegal immigration and removing \naliens who commit crimes as important federal law enforcement priorities.  See Demore \nv. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 517-19 (2003); see also Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 846-47 \n(2018).  Accordingly, as with other important federal law enforcement priorities, the \nCOPS Office has included illegal immigration as one of several focus areas, and has \nalso announced that it would assign extra points to applicants that cooperate with the \nfederal government in particular ways to facilitate the removal of criminals. \nOf course, any applicant, including applicants that seek funding for an \napplication in the Illegal Immigration area, must provide an eligible community-\noriented policing plan, and use the funds for purposes permissible under the statute.  \nThere can therefore be no dispute that the COPS Office is distributing funds in a \nmanner contemplated by Congress.  Thus, the only issue in this case is whether the \ndistrict court properly held that the COPS Office’s discretion in selecting among \neligible applicants does not include consideration of an applicant’s cooperation with \nfederal immigration enforcement efforts. \n                                                 \n4 https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/821491/download. \n20 \n \n\nIt should be beyond dispute that the Department can consider contributions to \nimmigration enforcement efforts in connection with these law enforcement grants.  \nParticularly in light of the high rate of recividism among criminal aliens, consideration \nof coordination with federal immigration authorities who seek to detain criminal \naliens instead of allowing them to return to the community is plainly consonant with a \nprogram designed “to increase police presence, to expand and improve cooperation \nefforts between law enforcement agencies and members of the community to address \ncrime and disorder problems, and otherwise to enhance public safety.”  Violent Crime \nControl and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, tit. I, § 10003(a), \n108 Stat. at 1808.  And Congress specified that applicants must “identify related \ngovernmental and community initiatives which complement or will be coordinated \nwith the proposal.”  34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(4).  If an applicant identifies immigration \nenforcement as an initiative with which it is coordinating, the COPS Office is entitled \nto consider that statutory factor. \nC.  Los Angeles nevertheless challenges the inclusion of illegal immigration as a \nfocus area, as well as the award of extra points to jurisdictions that cooperate with the \nfederal government’s efforts to take custody of aliens subject to removal proceedings \nupon their release from jail.  The City did not challenge the use of other focus areas, \nand it has not suggested that the Department is generally barred from giving special \nconsideration to grant proposals in certain areas. \n21 \n \n\nThe district court offered no sound basis for singling out illegal immigration as \nan impermissible focus area.  As an initial matter, the court plainly erred in stating that \nthe inclusion of certain considerations in 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c) precluded the \nDepartment from establishing additional priorities.  The court declared that “the \nenumeration of discretionary factors in this context must be read to exclude others,” \nand that reading the statute to authorize the Attorney General to consider additional \nfactors “renders subsection (c) superfluous.” ER 6-7.  Taken at face value, this \nreasoning would appear to set aside the longstanding scoring system and would leave \nthe agency no mechanism for selecting among eligible applicants.  Section 10381(c) \nsimply prioritizes jurisdictions that provide greater than 25% matching funds, 34 \nU.S.C. § 10381(c)(1), or that have certain laws related to human trafficking, id. \n§ 10381(c)(2)-(3).  These considerations alone would not be sufficient to allocate the \nlimited CHP funding among applicants in a meaningful way, and limiting the agency \nto these considerations would in no respect further Congress’s purpose in creating the \nprogram. \nFurther, Section 10381(c)(2) and (3) were not added to the statute until 2015.  \nSee Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-22, tit. VI, § 601, \n129 Stat. 227, 259.  Under the district court’s reasoning, these additions had the effect \nof eliminating the COPS Office’s 20-year practice for scoring CHP applications.  \nPresumably, if Congress meant to eliminate a practice an agency had engaged in for 20 \nyears, it would have used statutory language more clear than “the Attorney General \n22 \n \n\nmay give preferential consideration, where feasible” to the considerations described in \nSection 10381(c).  See Whitman, 531 U.S. at 468 (“Congress . . . does not alter the \nfundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions—it \ndoes not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.”). \nIndeed, the district court itself recognized that it could not properly invalidate \nthe challenged provisions on this basis, acknowledging that the COPS Office has the \nauthority to select “applicants with programs that best embody the statutory purpose \nof the CHP grant.”  ER 7.  The court nevertheless proceeded to hold that the \nDepartment could not award extra points to grant applications in the illegal \nimmigration area.   \nThe court’s reasoning fundamentally misunderstands the means by which the \nCOPS Office assesses grant applications.  The district court noted that, in the section \nof the statute specifying the required contents of an application, Congress specified \nthat “applicants must ‘explain how the grant will be utilized to reorient the \n[applicant’s] mission toward community-oriented policing or enhance its involvement \nin or commitment to community-oriented policing.’”  ER 7 (quoting 34 U.S.C. \n§ 10382(c)(10)) (brackets in original).  The court then declared that the immigration \nfocus area does not advance community policing goals, apparently believing that the \nfocus area did not require a connection to community policing (as distinct from \n“policing generally”) and implied “limitless discretion to select grant awardees in ways \nnot even tangentially related to community policing.”  ER 8.   \n23 \n \n\nThis conclusion is inconsistent with the statute, which recognizes that the \nphilosophy of community-oriented policing can be applied across a host of areas, \nincluding to homeland security concerns like immigration.  Section 10381(b) \ndemonstrates Congress’s belief that deploying officers in “intelligence, anti-terror, or \nhomeland security duties,” 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(4), is a purpose that can be served by \ncommunity-oriented policing strategies, and Congress mandated that applicants for \nfunds under § 10381(b) demonstrate that they will use the money for purposes of \n“community-oriented policing,” id. § 10382(c)(10).  Consistent with this statutory \ncommand, all CHP grant applications, regardless of their focus area, must propose to \nuse the funds for community policing.  The focus area merely describes an area in \nwhich the community policing efforts will be undertaken, whether it be drug abuse, \n“Homeland Security Problems,” or problems in enforcing the immigration laws.   The \nIllegal Immigration focus area, like other focus areas, encourages localities to use their \ncommunity policing expertise and knowledge of local conditions to advance proposals \nfor using community policing principles to combat pressing public safety needs \nidentified by the Department.  If an applicant chooses this focus area, its proposal—\nlike any other—“must incorporate the principles of community-oriented policing.”  \nER 18, ¶ 7.   \nThe application itself makes this abundantly clear, emphasizing that the “COPS \nOffice grants must be used to initiate or enhance community policing activities” and \nstating that applications will be reviewed “to ensure that . . . grant-funded officers . . . \n24 \n \n\nwill initiate or enhance your agency’s capacity to implement community policing \nstrategies and approaches.”  ER 69.  Question 6 asks the applicant to identify the \n“problem/focus area that will be addressed by the officers requested in this \napplication.”  ER 70.  The application explains that “[i]dentifying the specific \nproblem/focus area and partnerships that your agency plans to focus on is important \nto ensure that you satisfy the requirements for COPS Office funding under this \nprogram” and “to ensure that . . . grant funded officers . . . will initiate or enhance \nyour agency’s capacity to implement community policing strategies and approaches.”  \nER 69.  Applicants are asked about their consultations with these prospective partners \nin developing their community policing plan, ER 82, as well as about the level of \n“community support” for the proposed strategy and the strategy’s “impact [on] the \nother components of the criminal justice system” in the jurisdiction, ER 83. \n The 2017 COPS Hiring Program Application Guide elaborates and further \nmakes clear that funds must be used for officers engaged in community-oriented \npolicing in whatever focus area the applicant chooses.  It explains that in Question 6 the \napplicant should identify the “community problem/focus area that you wish to \naddress with COPS Office funding” and that “[a]t any time during your award you \nneed to be prepared to demonstrate how the recipient funds were specifically used to \nenhance or initiate community policing activities according to your community \npolicing strategy.”  ER 269.  The guide likewise describes Illegal Immigration as a \npotential “focus area of [the applicant’s] community policing strategies.”  ER 270.  \n25 \n \n\nIndeed, only one of the 30 successful applicants in the group in which Los Angeles’s \napplication was considered (large jurisdictions) chose that focus area.  ER 26-27, ¶ 31; \nER 28, ¶ 35. \nThe district court was thus quite wrong in its apparent assumption that \napplications in the illegal immigration focus area need not satisfy the criteria for \ncommunity-oriented policing that are at the heart of the program: the Department is \nnot statutorily precluded from awarding a grant on the basis of an application that \nsatisfies the criteria for community-oriented policing merely because its proposal has \nto do with illegal immigration.  On the district court’s reasoning, can applicants still \ntailor their plans to use CHP funds to address “Homeland Security Problems,” \nincluding “addressing threats against facilities” and developing “criminal intelligence \ncapacity”?  See ER 19, ¶ 8.  Can the COPS Office still award points to jurisdictions \nrecovering from a catastrophic events or to jurisdictions with high crime rates?  The \ndistrict court did not say, but it is difficult to posit a cogent legal distinction between \nthe Illegal Immigration focus area and any of the others that have long been included, \nwithout objection, in the CHP.  As a policy matter, one focus area might be preferred \nover another—but that is a question for the policymaking agency, not a federal district \ncourt. \nIn this facial challenge to the application of the scoring system, there is no basis \nfor presuming that the COPS Office will act contrary to its own guidelines and award \ngrants to applicants that do not satisfy the basic requirements of the program.  \n26 \n \n\nInstead, the scoring system serves to select among eligible applicants, including those \napplicants who seek to apply community-oriented policing in connection with \nimmigration enforcement.   \nD.  The district court likewise offered no reason for concluding that no points \ncould be awarded for immigration enforcement cooperation.  In distributing scarce \nfederal funds, the Department is not precluded from assigning additional points to \njurisdictions that cooperate with, and do not thwart, federal immigration enforcement.  \nThe minimal cooperation involved in these circumstances helps to ensure that \ncriminals subject to removal proceedings do not reoffend in the United States.  Los \nAngeles has no basis for insisting that the Department cannot take its refusal to \nprovide a basic level of cooperation into account when considering whether to award \ndiscretionary federal funds aimed at building cooperative relationships in the law \nenforcement context.  The federal government, in awarding law enforcement grants, \nis not bound to give equal preference to jurisdictions that seek to impair federal law \nenforcement and jurisdictions that provide a minimal level of cooperation.  On the \nCity’s theory, the federal government would be unable to consider a jurisdiction’s \nrefusal to notify the federal government when it arrests individuals who are subject to \nfederal criminal warrants.  Nothing suggests that Congress required the Department \nto treat applicants that deliberately refuse to provide basic cooperation with federal \nauthorities on par with other applicants when distributing a discretionary law \nenforcement grant. \n27 \n \n\nE.  The district court’s conclusion that the use of the scoring factors did not \nsatisfy the APA rests on an equally infirm foundation.  The court provided no \nauthority for the proposition that determinations about how to exercise discretionary \ngrantmaking authority must be accompanied by “findings or data,” ER 10, and we are \naware of none.  So long as a consideration is permitted by Congress, there is no basis \nfor a court to second-guess the Department’s exercise of discretion.  There is no \nplausible ground, in particular, for requiring “findings or data” to support the \nselection of focus areas, which is an inherently policy-based judgment about which \nareas a federal agency should prioritize. \nEven if some further arbitrary and capricious review were warranted, the \nscoring factors here satisfy that “highly deferential” standard.  Kern Cty. Farm Bureau v. \nAllen, 450 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Independent Acceptance Co. v. \nCalifornia, 204 F.3d 1247, 1251 (9th Cir. 2000)).  Congress established the CHP to \npromote public safety and community-oriented policing, and thus intended the \nDepartment to consider those aims in awarding grants. Facilitating federal access to \naliens who have violated immigration law and who have violated, or are suspected of \nviolating, state or local criminal laws promotes these interests.  As the Supreme Court \nhas recognized, Congress made substantial reforms to the INA precisely because of \nconcerns that “deportable criminal aliens who remained in the United States often \ncommitted more crimes before being removed.”  Demore, 538 U.S. at 518.  The \nDepartment’s rationale for the bonus points scoring factor mirrored this \n28 \n \n\nCongressional judgment; as the Department explained, the scoring factor rewards \njurisdictions that assist efforts to “remove dangerous criminals from our \ncommunities.”  ER 10. \nThe district court did not explain its disagreement with this straightforward \nlogic, stating only that the Department had not offered “findings or data” to back up \nthe conclusion.  At bottom, the court’s APA analysis reflects the same mistaken \npremises as its statutory analysis.  It requires only common sense to recognize that \naliens who have been removed cannot reoffend in the United States, and a common-\nsense explanation is all that is required to establish the “reasonable basis” demanded \nby the APA.  See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 521 (2009).  The \ndistrict court’s contrary conclusion improperly “substitute[d] its judgment for that of \nthe agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983). \nII.  The Challenged Provisions Do Not Implicate Spending Clause \nConcerns \nAs we have demonstrated above, the challenged considerations properly \nimplement the grant program and fall within the Department’s statutory authority.  \nThere is no basis for concluding in such circumstances that the Department has \nviolated Spending Clause principles.  In any event, on its own terms, the district \ncourt’s analysis fundamentally misapprehends relevant doctrine.  \n29 \n \n\nThe district court repeatedly suggested that to pass constitutional muster, \nscoring factors must be imposed by Congress rather than the Department.  ER 5-6, 9.  \nTo the extent that the court meant this as a restatement of its view that the statutory \nscheme did not authorize the scoring factors, that view was wrong for the reasons \nalready discussed.   \nTo the extent the court believed that Congress was under an obligation to \nprovide a “clear statement” of each and every scoring factor that the Department \ncould consider in implementing the CHP, there is no such rule.  Congress frequently \ndelegates discretionary authority over distribution of federal funds in Spending Clause \nlegislation to executive branch agencies without raising constitutional concerns.  \nSpending Clause constraints operate in part to ensure that federal funds are \ndistributed to recipients that are able “to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of \nthe consequences of their participation.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 \nU.S. 1, 17 (1981).  As the Supreme Court has held, as long as a statute makes clear \nthat an agency enjoys discretion to set the terms of a funding program, and the agency \nspecifies the criteria to permit localities to make an informed decision, no notice \nconcerns arise.  For example, in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 \n(1999), the Supreme Court noted its rejection of a “claim of insufficient notice under \nPennhurst where [the] statute made it clear that there were some conditions placed on \nreceipt of federal funds,” and observed that “Congress need not ‘specifically identif[y] \nand proscrib[e]’ each condition in the legislation.”  Id. at 650 (quoting Bennett v. \n30 \n \n\nKentucky Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 666 (1985)).  As a result, this Court has correctly \nobserved that so long as Congress has expressed an “intention to impose a condition,” no \nnotice concerns arise even if the statutory language is “largely indeterminate.”  \nMayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir. 2002) (emphasis in original).  \nThe Spending Clause does not obligate Congress to spell out each and every detail \nattached to federal funds; the relevant question for Spending Clause purposes is \nsimply whether Congress has, through its delegation of authority to an agency, made \nclear that the agency has the discretion to develop criteria for distribution of the \nfunds. \nThese principles make clear that the solution to notice concerns is to ensure \nthat the agency provided localities with sufficient notice to ensure that they could \n“exercise their choice” to apply for or accept funds “knowingly, cognizant of the \nconsequences of their participation.”  Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17; see Bennett, 470 U.S. at \n669, 672 (observing that “the Federal Government simply could not prospectively \nresolve every possible ambiguity” in a grant program and advising recipients to seek \n“clarification” from the administering agency).  The district court did not conclude \nthat it was unclear whether the scoring factors at issue here would be used or what \nwas expected to receive points under each factor, and Los Angeles does not suggest \notherwise.  And, as noted, to apply for the grant, the City need not agree to take any \naction with respect to immigration law.  \n31 \n \n\nThe district court was also wrong to suggest that the scoring factors were \ninsufficiently related to the purposes of the grant program for Spending Clause \npurposes.  ER 9-10.  As we have demonstrated, the scoring factors here are \nsufficiently related to community-oriented policing to qualify as a legitimate exercise \nof the Department’s delegated discretion under the CHP statute.  No further showing \nis required to meet the relatedness standard of the Spending Clause, which requires \nonly “some relationship to the purpose of the federal spending.”  Mayweathers, 314 \nF.3d at 1067; see Barbour v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 374 F.3d 1161, 1168 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004) (noting that the Supreme Court has never “overturned Spending \nClause legislation on relatedness grounds”). \nThe district court was equally wrong to suggest that federalism concerns make \na clear statement necessary in this context on the theory that the scoring factors “alter \nthe ‘usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government.’”  \nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (quoting Will v. Michigan Dep’t of State Police, \n491 U.S. 58, 65 (1989)).  Gregory addressed claims that federal law invalidated a state \nconstitutional provision dictating a retirement age for judges.  Id. at 455-56.  Gregory \npremised its expectation of a clear statement on its concerns about “overrid[ing]” a \nstate constitutional provision that affected not simply “an area traditionally regulated \nby the States,” but “a decision of the most fundamental sort for a sovereign entity.”  \nId. at 460.   \n32 \n \n\nNothing comparable is at stake here.  The scoring factors do not override state \nand local law in any respect, and there is no question that Spending Clause programs \nmay be used to “induce the States to adopt policies that the Federal Government \ncould not itself impose.”  National Fed’n of Indep. Business v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 537 \n(2012).  Nor do the scoring factors “requir[e] state and local participation in a \nhistorically federal function.”  ER 6.  Localities are under no obligation to choose the \nIllegal Immigration focus area or attempt to qualify for the bonus points, or even to \napply for CHP funds in the first place.  Optional scoring factors that reward \napplicants for providing cooperation they already may provide to federal officials \nconsistent with the INA and the Constitution do not “alter the constitutional balance” \nat all.   \nThe district court was equally wrong to declare that a clear statement is \nrequired because the CHP affects a jurisdiction’s “police power.”  ER 5.  Of course, a \ncentral purpose of the CHP is to create incentives for jurisdictions to change how \nthey exercise their police power by distributing federal funds to jurisdictions that agree \nto “reorient” their law enforcement “mission toward community-oriented policing” or \nto “enhance” their “involvement in or commitment to community-oriented policing.”  \n34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(10).   Despite this fact, the district court did not apply its own \npurported clear statement rule; to the contrary, the court recognized that the \nDepartment must have discretion to consider which applicants “best embody” this \nstatutory purpose, ER 7, even though Congress has not defined community-oriented \n33 \n \n\npolicing or spelled out a scoring rubric for the Department.  The Department’s \ndelegated discretion necessarily includes the ability to develop factors, like the ones at \nissue here, related to the purposes of the CHP; no “clear statement” of those factors \nin the statute is necessary on the district court’s own terms. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court should be \nreversed. \nRespectfully submitted, \n  CHAD A.

(Dkts. 49, 53).  Having considered briefing by the parties, briefing by amici \n22  curiae, and oral argument of counsel, this Court issues the following order. \n23    Congress created a grant program to support local governments in hiring officers for \n24  deployment in community-oriented policing (“COPS”).  The Department of Justice (“DOJ”), \n25  headed by Defendant Jefferson B. Sessions III (“Attorney General”), administers this grant \n26  program through the “COPS Office.”  The COPS Office administers the COPS Hiring Program \n27  (“CHP”) grant, which “provides funding directly to law enforcement agencies to hire and/or rehire \n28  career law enforcement officers in an effort to increase their community policing capacity and \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 2 of 13   Page ID #:2317\n1  crime prevention efforts.”  \n2    Each fiscal year, the COPS Office issues applications for the CHP grant and selects local \n3  governments to receive funding.  Because funds are limited, the COPS Office created this scoring \n4  system to best allocate the funds: Community Policing (50% of score), Crime (30% of score), and \n5  Fiscal Health (20% of score).  The COPS Office also awards “additional consideration” bonus \n6  points but does not disclose their relative weight. \n7    In the fiscal year (“FY”) 2017 application cycle for CHP grants, the COPS Office added a \n8  “focus area” called “Illegal Immigration.”  The COPS Office explained that additional \n9  consideration may be given to applicants that partner with federal law enforcement to address \n10  illegal immigration.  On September 12, 2017, the COPS Office sent an e-mail with an attached \n \n  11  “Certification of Illegal Immigration Cooperation” form that each applicant could sign to qualify \n12  for the additional consideration points.  The form required applicants to certify implementation of \n13  “rules, regulations, policies, and/or practices” granting federal immigration authorities (1) access \n14  to detention facilities to ask aliens and suspected aliens about their immigration status and (2) at \n15  least 48 hours’ notice of their expected release from custody (“Challenged Considerations”). \n16    Los Angeles has applied for a CHP grant in 39% of all cycles since inception.  It received \n17  CHP grants in 2012 and 2016, the last two times it applied.  It also applied for a FY 2017 grant. \n18    On September 29, 2017, Los Angeles filed its Complaint and an application seeking to \n19  preliminarily enjoin Defendants from imposing the Challenged Considerations.  On October 12, \n20  2017, Defendants declared they had already selected grant awardees and Los Angeles was not \n21  among them.  They also declared that Los Angeles would not have received a grant even if it had \n22  qualified for the additional bonus points.  On October 16, 2017, Los Angeles withdrew its \n23  preliminary injunction application citing Defendants’ declaration and explaining that it could not \n24  secure timely relief in advance of the CHP award decisions.  Los Angeles now seeks to enjoin \n25  Defendants from imposing the Challenged Considerations in future grant cycles.  To that end, both \n26  Los Angeles and Defendants move for summary judgment on Counts 4, 5, and 6 of the Complaint. \n27  Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the \n28  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 3 of 13   Page ID #:2318\n1  Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 330 (1986).  Partial summary judgment may be granted on particular \n2  claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).   \n3  Justiciability \n4    Article III of the Constitution allows federal courts to adjudicate only live cases and \n5  controversies.  Under this requirement, a plaintiff must have “standing” to sue for relief.  The \n6  elements of standing are (1) injury in fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressability.  Lujan v. \n7  Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  To establish standing to seek equitable relief, \n8  the plaintiff must also show a likelihood of future injury.  City of L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 \n9  (1983).  “The existence of standing turns on the facts as they existed at the time the plaintiff filed \n10  the complaint.”  Skaff v. Meridien N. Am. Beverly Hills, LLC, 506 F.3d 832, 838 (9th Cir. 2007). \n \n  11    A grant competitor may suffer “competitive injury” for purposes of standing.  “[W]hen \n12  challenged agency conduct allegedly renders a [competitor] unable to fairly compete for some \n13  benefit, that [competitor] has suffered a sufficient ‘injury in fact’ and has standing.”  Preston v. \n14  Heckler, 734 F.2d 1359, 1365 (9th Cir. 1984); see also Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. U.S. Dep’t of \n15  Transp., 861 F.3d 944, 950 (9th Cir. 2017) (“[E]conomic actors suffer an injury in fact when \n16  agencies lift regulatory restrictions on their competitors or otherwise allow increased competition \n17  against them….  This doctrine of ‘competitor standing’ is grounded in the basic law of economics \n18  that increased competition leads to actual injury.”).  The grant competitor is not required to show \n19  that it would have received the grant but for the disadvantage it faced.  Rather, “the ‘injury in fact’ \n20  is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process….”  Ne. Fla. Chapter of \n21  Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993). \n22    Los Angeles has standing to bring suit based on competitive injury.  Los Angeles filed its \n23  Complaint promptly upon notification that Defendants would award bonus points based on \n24  compliance with the Challenged Considerations and before funds were distributed.  As Los \n25  Angeles did not certify compliance with these conditions, it could not fairly compete with those \n26  competitors that did.  Therefore, Los Angeles suffered ongoing competitive injury at the time it \n27  filed suit and properly sought to enjoin Defendants from creating an uneven playing field.  \n28  Defendants do not challenge application of the remaining standing elements. \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 4 of 13   Page ID #:2319\n1    Defendants instead argue the case is now moot because the COPS Office has since \n2  awarded all FY 2017 grants.  “Mootness [is] the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The \n3  requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must \n4  continue throughout its existence (mootness).”  Sanford v. MemberWorks, Inc., 625 F.3d 550, 556 \n5  (9th Cir. 2010).  But there is an exception to the mootness doctrine where the plaintiff’s harm is \n6  “capable of repetition yet evading review.”  Kingdomware Techs., Inc. v. United States, 136 S. Ct. \n7  1969, 1976 (2016).  Under this exception, (1) the challenged action must be too short in duration \n8  to fully litigate before the claim expires, and (2) there must be a “reasonable expectation” that the \n9  plaintiff will again be subject to the challenged action.  Id. \n10    This case is not moot because Los Angeles’ harm is capable of repetition in a manner that \n \n  11  evades judicial review.  First, Los Angeles could not fully litigate this case before completion of \n12  the FY 2017 grant process.  Exactly one month passed between the date Defendants announced \n13  imposition of the Challenged Considerations and selected successful applicants.  Therefore, Los \n14  Angeles had no more than one month to meaningfully challenge the selection process.  The Ninth \n15  Circuit has explained that even “actions lasting only one or two years evade review.”  Karuk Tribe \n16  of Cal. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 681 F.3d 1006, 1018 (9th Cir. 2012).  Additionally, disputes over \n17  government grant awards are common examples of challenges too short in duration to be fully \n18  litigated before funds are distributed.  See Wright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 3533.8 (3d ed. \n19  2017).  Therefore, Los Angeles satisfies the first prong. \n20    Second, there is at least a “reasonable expectation” that Los Angeles will suffer similar \n21  injury in FY 2018.  The Attorney General has touted immigration enforcement as a cornerstone of \n22  the DOJ’s agenda, meaning competitors can reasonably expect similar conditions to apply in FY \n23  2018.1  Further, it is reasonably likely Los Angeles will seek a FY 2018 CHP award because it has \n24  applied for a grant in 39% of all cycles since inception.  Although 39% does not represent a \n25  statistical probability, it is more than sufficient to satisfy the “reasonable expectation” standard.  \n26 \n                                                 \n1 See, e.g., DOJ, Off. of Public Affairs, Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks on Sanctuary Jurisdictions, \n27 \nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-jeffsessions-delivers-remarks-sanctuary-jurisdictions; DOJ, Off. \nof Public Affairs, Attorney General Sessions Announces $98 Million To Hire Community Policing Officers, \n28 \nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-announces-98-million-hirecommunity-policing-officers.  \nDefendants do not object to admission of either piece of evidence, and both are publicly-available pages, the accuracy \nof which “cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2). \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 5 of 13   Page ID #:2320\n1  See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318 n.6 (1988) (explaining that “reasonable expectation” is a \n2  much lower bar than “demonstrably probable”).  A high-ranking officer also declared under oath \n3  that Los Angeles will apply for a FY 2018 grant.  Therefore, Los Angeles satisfies the second \n4  prong, and this action is justiciable.2  \n5  Count 4 \n6    Los Angeles alleges in Count 4 that imposition of the Challenged Considerations is ultra \n7  vires. \n8    An agency “has no power to act…unless and until Congress confers power upon \n9  it.”  La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  When agencies “act improperly, \n10  no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.”  City of Arlington \n \n  11  v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013).  While “Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of \n12  federal funds,” a federal agency may not do so without Congress’ permission.  South Dakota v. \n13  Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987); see also City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933, 940 \n14  (N.D. Ill. 2017) (“Whether the new conditions on the…grant are proper depends on whether \n15  Congress conferred authority on the Attorney General to impose them.”).   \n16    “If Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the \n17  Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the \n18  statute.”  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991).  Although Gregory did not address this \n19  constitutional balance in the grant context, the Court explained that this clear statement rule \n20  “applie[s] in other contexts,” including any “traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation \n21  affecting the federal balance.”  Id. at 461.  The Fourth Circuit, citing Supreme Court precedent, \n22  extended the clear statement rule specifically to federal grants.  Com. of Va., Dep’t of Educ. v. \n23  Riley, 106 F.3d 559, 566 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc).  The Riley Court emphasized the importance of \n24  such a rule where the grant condition required the surrender of a critical power reserved to the \n25  states by the Tenth Amendment.  Id.  The Supreme Court has emphasized that the police power is \n26  one such critical state function.  See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 270 (2006) (states \n27 \n                                                 \n2 In a footnote, Defendants argue this matter is incapable of repetition because the FY 2017 cycle cannot be repeated.  \n28 \nDefendants’ attempt to break each fiscal cycle into distinct programs would render any challenge impossible.  Each \nyear, grant competitors may only have one month to challenge that cycle’s scoring factors, only to be told upon \nwithdrawal of the challenge that the following cycle cannot be repeated. \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 6 of 13   Page ID #:2321\n1  have “great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives, limbs, \n2  health, comfort, and quiet of all persons”). \n3    The Challenged Considerations upset the constitutional balance between state and federal \n4  power by requiring state and local law enforcement to partner with federal authorities.  These \n5  conditions infringe upon the state police power.  The Challenged Considerations also upset the \n6  constitutional balance by requiring state and local participation in a historically federal function—\n7  immigration enforcement.  See, e.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394 (2012) (“The \n8  Government of the United States has broad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and \n9  the status of aliens.”).  Accordingly, the dispositive question before this Court is whether Congress \n10  has “unmistakably” authorized the Attorney General to impose the Challenged Considerations. \n \n  11    CHP grants are awarded under the COPS statute, which authorizes the Attorney General to \n12  issue grants to state and local governments to rehire law enforcement officers for deployment in \n13  community policing.  34 U.S.C. § 10381(a), (b)(1)-(2).  Subsection (c) says “the Attorney General \n14  may give preferential consideration” to CHP grant applicants in only three circumstances, none of \n15  which apply to federal immigration.3  This subsection is the only place in the statute that allows \n16  the Attorney General to look beyond an applicant’s need and use for CHP grant money. \n17    Defendants argue that subsection (c) does not limit the universe of applications the \n18  Attorney General may preferentially consider.  According to Defendants, because “the Attorney \n19  General may give preferential treatment” in the three circumstances listed in subsection (c), the \n20  Attorney General may also develop additional factors to consider.   \n21    In the Court’s view, subsection (c) does not plainly or even arguably authorize the \n22  Attorney General to give preferential treatment to competitors based on compliance with the \n23  Challenged Considerations.  Defendants’ reading effectively renders subsection (c) superfluous.  \n24  See Chubb Custom Ins. Co. v. Space Sys./Loral, Inc., 710 F.3d 946, 966 (9th Cir. 2013) (“It is a \n25  well-established rule of statutory construction that courts should not interpret statutes in a way that \n26  renders a provision superfluous.”).  Contrary to Defendants’ claim, the enumeration of \n                                                 \n27 \n3 This section authorizes the Attorney General to give preferential consideration for the following: (1) an application \n“for hiring and rehiring additional career law enforcement officers that involves a non-Federal contribution exceeding \n28 \nthe 25 percent minimum” contribution; (2) the applicant is in a state with laws that treat minors engaged in \ncommercial sex as victims; or (3) the applicant is in a state with laws allowing the vacatur of arrests or convictions for \nnon-violent crimes committed by human trafficking victims directly related to their human trafficking.   \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 7 of 13   Page ID #:2322\n1  discretionary factors in this context must be read to exclude others.  See United States v. Vonn, \n2  535 U.S. 55, 65 (2002) (absent contrary indications, “expressing one item of [an] associated group \n3  or series excludes another left unmentioned”); see also Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 274 (“Congress is \n4  unlikely to alter a statute’s obvious scope…through muffled hints….”).  If the Attorney General \n5  has complete discretion to favor certain applicants, Congress’ subsection (c) directives are \n6  meaningless.  Congress knew how to confer the broad power the Attorney General seeks and \n7  chose not to here.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 3796gg-l(e)(3) (Attorney General can “impose reasonable \n8  conditions” on grant awards); 42 U.S.C. § 10305(a)(2) (Secretary can impose conditions he \n9  “considers to be in the best interest of the Nation”); United States v. Dang, 488 F.3d 1135, 1140 \n10  (9th Cir. 2007) (inclusion of catch-all provision indicates gap for agency to fill).  Subsection (c) \n \n  11  does not permit Defendants to favor applicants compliant with the Challenged Considerations.   \n12    This conclusion does not mean, as Defendants contend, that the Attorney General is \n13  relegated to either developing an arbitrary method of ranking applicants or choosing the winning \n14  applicants by random lottery.  The Attorney General may select applicants with programs that best \n15  embody the statutory purpose of the CHP grant.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(10) (applicants must \n16  “explain how the grant will be utilized to reorient the [applicant’s] mission toward community-\n17  oriented policing or enhance its involvement in or commitment to community-oriented policing”). \n18    “Community policing begins with a commitment to building trust and mutual respect \n19  between police and communities,” which is “critical to public safety.”4  Los Angeles argues that \n20  community policing must foster trust between police and communities, and the Challenged \n21  Considerations do the opposite.  Defendants, citing a House Report and the Los Angeles Police \n22  Department’s website, argue at some length that community policing is concerned broadly with \n23  crime prevention and public safety, which the Challenged Considerations address.5 \n24    There is no dispute between the parties that community policing ultimately aims to prevent \n25  crime and keep the public safe.  But all policing is fundamentally aimed at these end goals.  \n                                                 \n26 \n4 COPS Office, “About,” https://cops.usdoj.gov/about.  Defendants do not object to Los Angeles’ request for judicial \nnotice of this publicly-available page, the accuracy of which “cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. Evid. \n27 \n201(b)(2). \n \n28  5 H.R. Rep. No. 103-324 at 8-9 (1993); see Community Policing Unit, \nhttp://www.lapdonline.org/support_lapd/content_basic_view/731.  The accuracy of this publicly-available page \n“cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2). \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 8 of 13   Page ID #:2323\n1  Community policing is distinct from other types of policing because of the means used to achieve \n2  these end goals, namely partnerships between police and communities.  Pub. L. No. 103-322, Title \n3  I, § 10003(a), 108 Stat. 1796 (1994) (Congress established COPS statute “to increase police \n4  presence, to expand and improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and \n5  members of the community to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise to enhance \n6  public safety”) (emphasis added); see Brief of Amici Curiae Prosecutors and Law Enforcement \n7  Leaders, No. 17-cv-7215-R-JCx, pp. 3-4, (community policing “requires police to interact with \n8  neighborhood residents in a manner that will build trust and improve the level of cooperation with \n9  the police department”).  Defendants’ attempt to use these funds to encourage partnerships \n10  between local police and federal immigration authorities encroaches on territory Congress did not \n \n  11  contemplate.  Congress mandated that CHP grants must be used for community policing, not \n12  policing generally.  \n13    Further, Defendants’ broad interpretation of their authority carries extraordinary \n14  implications.  If the Attorney General can favor applicants based on any factors relevant to public \n15  safety, he enjoys nearly limitless discretion to select grant awardees in ways not even tangentially \n16  related to community policing.  For example, he may favor CHP applicants that agree to \n17  implement or abolish capital punishment in the name of public safety.  In the absence of clear \n18  statutory guidance, this Court cannot conclude that Congress intended to stretch Defendants’ \n19  authority so broadly.  See Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 48 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (“When Congress \n20  limits the purpose for which a grant can be made, it can be presumed that it intends that the \n21  dispersing agency makes its allocations based on factors solely related to the goal of implementing \n22  the stated statutory purposes in a reasonable fashion, rather than taking irrelevant or impermissible \n23  factors into account.”). \n24    Accordingly, Defendants’ imposition of the Challenged Considerations is ultra vires as a \n25  matter of law.  The Court does not reach Los Angeles’ “direction, supervision, or control” \n26  argument.  See Riley, 106 F.3d at 566 (“If Congress has not unequivocally conditioned receipt of \n27  federal funds in the manner claimed by the [agency],…then [the] inquiry is at an end.”).   \n28    Los Angeles is entitled to summary judgment on Count 4.  \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 9 of 13   Page ID #:2324\n1  Count 5 \n2    Los Angeles alleges in Count 5 that the Challenged Considerations violate the Spending \n3  Clause.   \n4    Under the Spending Clause, “if Congress desires to condition the [participant’s] receipt of \n5  federal funds, it must do so unambiguously, enabling the [participant] to exercise [its] choice \n6  knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of [its] participation.”  Dole, 483 U.S. at 207.  Further, \n7  an exercise of Spending Clause authority must be “reasonably related” to the articulated goal of \n8  the grant program.  Nevada v. Skinner, 884 F.2d 445, 447 (9th Cir. 1989); Mayweathers v. \n9  Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir. 2002). \n10    As a preliminary matter, the Court rejects Defendants’ argument that the Challenged \n \n  11  Considerations are not “conditions” because compliance is not required to receive a CHP grant \n12  award.  First, Defendants offer no supporting precedent.  Second, compliance with these \n13  considerations is required in order for applicants to compete on a level playing field.  Not \n14  coincidentally, 80% of successful applicants complied with the Challenged Considerations.6  \n15  Third, because applicants who do not comply are less likely to receive a CHP grant, the \n16  Challenged Considerations will be dispositive in at least some cases.  Finally, if Defendants are \n17  correct, it would be simple for federal agencies to avert Spending Clause requirements by labelling \n18  all considerations “plus factors.”  This Court cannot agree.  \n19    Next, the Challenged Considerations violate the Spending Clause because, as discussed \n20  above, Congress did not unambiguously condition receipt of a CHP grant on local compliance \n21  with federal authorities.  Defendants’ argument that the COPS Office unambiguously instructed \n22  applicants how to qualify for bonus points misses the point.  Dole counsels that Congress must be \n23  clear in its directives.  483 U.S. at 207.  It is irrelevant whether the COPS Office is transparent \n24  where Congress does not authorize it to act.  \n25    Although the analysis may conclude here, the Court briefly notes that the Challenged \n26  Considerations are not “reasonably related” to the articulated goal of the COPS program.  As \n27  explained above, community policing is about developing partnerships between local authorities \n28  and the community.  Whether local police cooperation with federal authorities allows for more \n                                                 \n6 See supra note 1 \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 2: 17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 10 of 13   Page ID #:2325\n1  effective enforcement is not the relevant inquiry.  In short, there is no relationship between local \n2  police partnerships with federal authorities and community policing.  Therefore, the Challenged \n3  Considerations violate the Spending Clause as a matter of law. \n4    Accordingly, Los Angeles is entitled to summary judgment on Count 5. \n5  Count 6 \n6    Los Angeles alleges in Count 6 that the Challenged Considerations are arbitrary and \n7  capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).   \n8    Under the APA, agency actions must be set aside if they are “arbitrary, capricious, an \n9  abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  In the Ninth \n10  Circuit, courts “must not rubber-stamp administrative decisions.”  Alaska Oil & Gas Ass’n v. \n \n  11  Jewell, 815 F.3d 544, 554 (9th Cir. 2016).  “Instead, the [agency] action is presumed valid and is \n12  upheld if a reasonable basis exists for the decision.”  Id.  “[T]he agency must examine the relevant \n13  data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between \n14  the facts found and the choice made.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \n15  Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983); Alaska Oil, 815 F.3d at 554. \n16    The Challenged Considerations are arbitrary and capricious as a matter of law.  Only after \n17  CHP grant applications were due, Defendants explained that “[c]ities and states that cooperate \n18  with federal law enforcement make all of us safer by helping remove dangerous criminals from \n19  our communities,” including by ending “violent crime stemming from illegal immigration.”7  But \n20  there is no evidence of record, and Defendants do not argue, that Defendants based this conclusion \n21  on any findings or data.  Therefore, the Court cannot conclude that Defendants had a “reasonable \n22  basis” for imposing the Challenged Considerations. \n23    Defendants’ explanation that “[n]othing in the statutes governing CHP suggests DOJ \n24  should not consider the extent to which a jurisdiction cooperates in the enforcement of \n25  immigration law” is not an articulated justification for imposing the Challenged Considerations.  \n26  Defendants must affirmatively explain the basis for their decision.  See Pac. Coast Fed’n of \n27 \n                                                 \n7 DOJ, Off. of Public Affairs, Department of Justice Announces Priority Consideration Criteria for COPS Office \n28 \nGrants, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-announces-priority-consideration-criteria-cops-office-\ngrants.  Defendants do not object to Los Angeles’ request for judicial notice of this publicly-available page, the \naccuracy of which “cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2). \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 2: 17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 11 of 13   Page ID #:2326\n1  Fishermen’s Ass’ns v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 426 F.3d 1082, 1091 (9th Cir. 2005) (“It is a \n2  basic principle of administrative law that the agency must articulate the reason or reasons for its \n3  decision.”). \n4    Finally, as concluded above, Defendants do not have authority to impose the Challenged \n5  Considerations.  See Michigan v. EPA, 135 S. Ct. 2699, 2706 (2015) (“[A]n agency’s decreed \n6  result [must] be within the scope of its lawful authority….”). \n7    Accordingly, the Challenged Considerations are arbitrary and capricious as a matter of law, \n8  and Los Angeles is entitled to summary judgment on Count 6. \n9  Permanent injunction \n10    Los Angeles seeks to prospectively enjoin Defendants from imposing the Challenged \n \n  11  Considerations.  To obtain a permanent injunction, the moving party must show (1) irreparable \n12  injury, (2) that monetary damages are inadequate, (3) that the balance of hardships weighs in its \n13  favor, and (4) that an injunction serves the public.  Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 \n14  U.S. 139, 156-57 (2010).  As Defendants do not challenge application of these factors, the Court \n15  will be brief in its analysis.   \n16    First, Los Angeles will suffer irreparable competitive harm if Defendants are not enjoined \n17  from imposing the Challenged Considerations in future cycles.  Int’l Franchise Ass’n, Inc. v. City \n18  of Seattle, 803 F.3d 389, 411 (9th Cir. 2015) (“A rule putting plaintiffs at a competitive \n19  disadvantage constitutes irreparable harm.”).  Second, monetary damages cannot ensure that Los \n20  Angeles will compete on a level playing field in future grant cycles.  Third, Los Angeles has a \n21  strong interest in competing fairly for federal resources.  Although Defendants have an interest in \n22  determining allocation of CHP funds, they have no legitimate interest in distributing these funds \n23  unconstitutionally.  Finally, it is “always in the public interest” to issue an injunction in order to \n24  prevent the violation of constitutional rights.  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. \n25  2012).  Therefore, a permanent injunction is appropriate. \n26    The parties dispute the proper scope of the injunction.  Los Angeles requests that the \n27  injunction apply to all CHP competitors nationwide.  Defendants argue that a nationwide \n28  injunction exceeds the scope of relief necessary to make Los Angeles whole.  \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 2: 17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 12 of 13   Page ID #:2327\n1    A district court may issue a nationwide injunction only where “necessary to provide \n2  complete relief to the plaintiff[].”  See Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979); see also \n3  Easyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. v. Hannigan, 92 F.3d 1486, 1501-02 (9th Cir. 1996) (“[A]n \n4  injunction is not necessarily made overbroad by extending benefit or protection to persons other \n5  than prevailing parties in the lawsuit—even if it is not a class action—if such breadth is necessary \n6  to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.”).  This Court cannot reasonably \n7  provide complete relief to Los Angeles without enjoining Defendants from imposing the \n8  Challenged Considerations as to all competitors.  Los Angeles is harmed not only because it \n9  cannot qualify for bonus points, but because other jurisdictions can.  An injunction that bars \n10  Defendants from applying the Challenged Considerations only as to Los Angeles does little to \n   11  ensure an even playing field.8  Gregory v. Litton Sys., Inc., 472 F.2d 631, 633-34 (9th Cir. 1972) \n12  (“[I]njunctive relief [may] be necessary to give a plaintiff or a group of plaintiffs the relief to \n13  which they are entitled.  Such relief, of course, may incidentally benefit many persons not before \n14  the court.”). \n15    The Ninth Circuit has also held that where an agency violates the APA, the district court is \n16  compelled to issue a nationwide injunction.  Earth Island Inst. v. Ruthenbeck, 490 F.3d 687, 699 \n17  (9th Cir. 2007), (rev’d in part on other grounds), (“The nationwide injunction, as applied to our \n18  decision to affirm the district court’s invalidation of 36 C.F.R. §§ 215.12(f) and 215.4(a), is \n19  compelled by the text of the Administrative Procedure Act…”); Zayn Siddique, Nationwide \n20  Injunctions, 117 Colum. L. Rev. 2095, 2123 (2017).  This Court follows the Ninth Circuit’s \n21  directives.  Accordingly, the injunction applies nationwide. 9  \n22 \n                                                 \n8 Defendants propose alternatives, including that this Court automatically credit Los Angeles with additional \n23 \nconsideration points as though it complied with the Challenged Considerations.  The Court declines to issue such a \ncreative proposal with potential unforeseen consequences.  Furthermore, there is “no reason to think that the legal \n24 \nissues present in this case are restricted to [Los Angeles] or that the statutory authority given to the Attorney General \nwould differ in another jurisdiction.”  See Chicago, 264 F. Supp. 3d at 951 (imposing nationwide relief against \n25 \nAttorney General based on similar access and notice conditions in Byrne JAG grant context). \n \n26  9 Defendants submit an amicus brief from a different case where Los Angeles argues against a nationwide injunction.  \nThis Court cannot determine its relevance other than to paint Los Angeles as a walking contradiction.  Regardless, Los \n27 \nAngeles argued there that a nationwide injunction could cost it over $1.5 billion and directly impose on local police.  \nThe injunction here only incidentally impacts competitors to the extent they cannot receive bonus points for \n28 \ncompliance with the Challenged Considerations.  Nothing in this injunction prevents competitors from voluntary \ncooperation with federal enforcement or otherwise directly imposes on them. \n \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 2: 17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 75   Filed 04/11/18   Page 13 of 13   Page ID #:2328\n1    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is \n2  GRANTED.

Defendants assert that DOJ may transform a grant \n4  program that Congress expressly designed to support the hiring of state and local officers \n5  for “deployment in community-oriented policing” (the “COPS grant”), into a tool to \n6  pressure states and localities to adopt the unrelated immigration policy preferences of the \n7  Attorney General.  In Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2017, that preference was for states and \n8  localities to “partner” with federal immigration authorities, and otherwise participate in \n9  enforcing federal civil immigration law (the “Challenged Considerations”).  In future \n10  years, if DOJ has this authority, the Attorney General might decide to favor states that \n11  abolish the death penalty (or promise to impose it more frequently); or states that \n12  strengthen (or relax) their gun laws; or states that criminalize (or legalize) marijuana.  \n13  The ways in which DOJ might, in the future, use an unrelated grant program to induce \n14  sovereign states to change their laws and policies are limitless.   \n15  Congress did not silently grant such a power when it authorized DOJ to administer \n16  a grant program for the hiring of state and local officers to engage in community policing.  \n17  Remarkably, after Los Angeles highlighted the sweeping implications of Defendants’ \n18  position, Defendants did not attempt to suggest any limit on what DOJ may do under the \n19  guise of administering the COPS grant.  Instead, they resorted to arguing against a straw \n20  man: DOJ must have the power to favor or disfavor applicants on any grounds the \n21  Attorney General pleases, or else DOJ would be reduced to selecting grant recipients by \n22  random lottery.  This hyperbole cannot be squared with the statute.  Congress defined the \n23  contours of the COPS program and left the agency administering it with substantial room \n24  to exercise its judgment within the confines of that program and its purposes.  It does not \n25  follow that DOJ can use its control over the purse strings to pressure states and localities \n26  to adopt unrelated laws and policies, or to divert grant funds to a purpose having nothing \n27  to do with community-oriented policing. \n28 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 9 of 33   Page ID #:2073\n \n1  Rather than confront the City’s arguments, Defendants ignore or implicitly \n2  concede them.  For example, Defendants do not dispute that their interpretation of the \n3  COPS statute would render superfluous the only provision in which Congress did \n4  authorize DOJ to give preference to an applicant based on its adoption of policies \n5  unrelated to the need for, or use of, COPS grant funds.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2)-(3) \n6  (permitting preferential consideration to be given to states with certain laws providing for \n7  lenient treatment of human trafficking victims).  That provision confirms that Congress \n8  did not intend to empower DOJ to use COPS grants to obtain other unrelated policy \n9  concessions from states and localities.  \n10  Defendants also do not provide an explanation for how combating illegal \n11  immigration relates to Congress’s goal to fund community policing.  They instead invoke \n12  the “belie[f]” of the COPS Office (Defs.’ Br. 23) that illegal immigration is a public \n13  safety issue.  Even assuming arguendo that this “belie[f]” were based in fact—which it is \n14  not—Congress did not create the COPS program to fund any kind of policing that relates \n15  to an asserted public safety interest.  The agency cannot disregard the express statutory \n16  purpose of a grant program it is charged with administering, and Defendants offer no \n17  explanation for why they may do so here.   \n18  Defendants also seek to insulate this usurpation of Legislative Branch authority \n19  from review by the Judicial Branch.  They claim the case is moot because, on the \n20  unilateral declaration of a COPS Office employee, Los Angeles would not have received \n21  a 2017 grant anyway.  Defendants ask the Court to treat this representation as conclusive \n22  despite admitting a material misrepresentation in their rush to make a similar claim in \n23  response to the City’s application for a preliminary injunction, which ultimately caused \n24  the City to withdraw that motion.  More fundamentally, however, it does not matter what \n25  would have happened in the 2017 grant cycle.  Los Angeles plainly has standing to \n26  challenge the competitive injury it suffered, and an annual grant program is the paradigm \n27  case for the “capable of repetition, yet evading review” exception to mootness.  There is \n28  more than a reasonable expectation that Los Angeles will apply for another COPS \n2 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 10 of 33   Page ID #:2074\n \n1  grant—indeed, it intends to do so this year—and that DOJ will use improper \n2  immigration-related considerations to disfavor the City.  Defendants cannot benefit from \n3  their misrepresentation—which eliminated any possibility of obtaining preliminary relief \n4  for the 2017 grant cycle—and then use the short timeframe in which COPS funding is \n5  applied for and granted to insulate from review their unlawful overreach of federal \n6  agency authority.  \n7  The Court should therefore grant partial summary judgment to Plaintiff, deny \n8  Defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment, and enter final judgment under \n9  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) in favor of Plaintiff on Counts Four, Five, and Six; \n10  declare that Defendants’ actions are unlawful; and enjoin them from administering the \n11  COPS program in this unlawful manner going forward. \n12  ARGUMENT \n13 \nI.  Defendants’ Attempt To Evade Judicial Review Fails. \n14 \nA.  Los Angeles Has Standing Because It Suffered Competitive Injury In \n15  The 2017 COPS Grant Cycle. \n16    This is a case of competitive harm: the federal agency charged with awarding \n17  grants consistent with a congressional statute, here DOJ, unlawfully favored Los \n18  Angeles’ competitors for a federal grant, and the City sued to restore the competition to a \n19  level, and lawful, playing field.  “Such competitive injuries have often been recognized as \n20  grounds for standing.”  Bullfrog Films, Inc. v. Wick, 847 F.2d 502, 506 (9th Cir. 1988).  \n21  Thus, “when challenged agency conduct allegedly renders a person unable to fairly \n22  compete for some benefit, that person has suffered a sufficient ‘injury in fact’ and has \n23  standing.”  Preston v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1359, 1365 (9th Cir. 1984); see also Regents of \n24  the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 281 n.14 (1978). \n25    In such cases, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to show that it would have \n26  received the award, contract, or other benefit it sought but for the unfair disadvantage it \n27  faced.  “[T]he ‘injury in fact’ is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the \n28  bidding process, not the loss of a contract” or other benefit.

Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993); see \n2  also Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995) (“[Plaintiff] need not \n3  demonstrate that it has been, or will be, the low bidder on a Government contract. . . .  \n4  The aggrieved party ‘need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the \n5  barrier in order to establish standing.’” (internal citation omitted)); Coral Const. Co. v. \n6  King Cty., 941 F.2d 910, 930 (9th Cir. 1991) (stating that a construction company \n7  challenging a set-aside for women-owned businesses was injured “every time the \n8  company simply places a bid”). \n9    “The existence of standing turns on the facts as they existed at the time the plaintiff \n10  filed the complaint.”  Skaff v. Meridien N. Am. Beverly Hills, LLC, 506 F.3d 832, 838 \n11  (9th Cir. 2007).  Los Angeles filed this lawsuit after DOJ announced that it would give \n12  preferential treatment to COPS applicants based on unlawful considerations, and before \n13  DOJ made awards on the basis of the Challenged Considerations.  The City did not agree \n14  to DOJ’s demands in order to receive the preferential treatment accorded to its \n15  competitors, and so was forced to compete on an uneven playing field.  This injury more \n16  than suffices to establish the City’s standing. \n17 \nB.  The Case Is Not Moot. \n18 \n  Defendants offer no argument that the City’s competitive injury did not provide it \n19 \nstanding at the time it filed its complaint.  Instead, Defendants argue that later \n20 \ndevelopments mooted the case: DOJ issued the 2017 COPS awards on November 20, \n21 \n2017, Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) (ECF 49-3) Ex. H, Nov. Press Release, and—\n22 \naccording to the unilateral assertions of Defendants—the City would not have won an \n23 \naward anyway.  There are reasons to doubt Defendants’ representations at this stage of \n24 \nthe litigation, particularly since they have already admitted to making a misrepresentation \n25 \nrelated to this question in an earlier filing.  But the more fundamental point is that it does \n26 \nnot matter whether the illegal considerations made a difference in the City’s application \n27 \nthis year: DOJ’s use of impermissible criteria to make COPS awards is capable of \n28 \n4 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 12 of 33   Page ID #:2076\n \n1  repetition, and the short duration of the grant cycle means that it would inherently evade \n2  review. \n3 \n1.  The “Capable of Repetition, Yet Evading Review” Doctrine \n4  Applies. \n  There is a well-established exception to mootness where “(1) ‘the challenged \n5 \naction [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,’ \n6 \nand (2) ‘there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be \n7 \nsubject to the same action again.’”  Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States, \n8 \n136 S. Ct. 1969, 1976 (2016) (quoting Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17 (1998)).  \n9 \nAgency actions lasting only one or two years evade judicial review as a matter of law.  \n10 \nSee id.

Since COPS grants are \n14 \nawarded annually, see Decl. of Andrew Dorr ¶ 10 (ECF 53-1), DOJ’s unlawful \n15 \nadministration of those awards necessarily would evade review.  See Wright & Miller, \n16 \nFed. Prac. & Proc. § 3533.8 (3d ed. 2017) (noting the “wide array of circumstances [that] \n17 \nhave led courts to deny mootness” as capable of repetition yet evading review, including \n18 \n“disputes over the terms or awards of government contracts or grants [which] often \n19 \ninvolve short contract periods and repeat bidders”). \n20 \n  In order to establish the second prong of the capable of repetition doctrine, all a \n21 \nplaintiff must show is a “reasonable expectation,” rather than a “mere physical or \n22 \ntheoretical possibility,” that it will be subject to the challenged action in the future.  \n23 \nMurphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 483 (1982).  This standard is “not a very demanding one.”  \n24 \nBarilla v. Ervin, 886 F.2d 1514, 1520 (9th Cir. 1989), overruled on other grounds by \n25 \nSimpson v. Lear Astronics Corp., 77 F.3d 1170, 1174 (9th Cir. 1996).  The question is \n26 \nsimply “whether the controversy [is] capable of repetition and not . . . whether the \n27 \nclaimant ha[s] demonstrated that a recurrence of the dispute [is] more probable than not.”  \n28 \n5 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 13 of 33   Page ID #:2077\n \n1  Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318 n.6 (1988).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has found that \n2  the exception to mootness applies when the plaintiff’s expectations of recurrence “were \n3  hardly demonstrably probable.”  Id.  And it is Defendants that bear the “heavy burden of \n4  persua[ding] the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start \n5  up again.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, \n6  189 (2000).1 \n7    Los Angeles reasonably expects to suffer the same competitive disadvantage in \n8  future grant cycles.  Defendants insist that the COPS Office at DOJ has not yet decided \n9  whether to use the same immigration-related factors in the FY 2018 process.  Defs.’ Br. \n10  12.  But the use of such factors in grant decisions has been a loudly proclaimed priority of \n11  the Attorney General as head of DOJ.2  DOJ’s announcement of this past year’s COPS \n12  grants oddly said nothing at all about the community-oriented policing programs being \n13  funded, but instead boasted of its success in persuading applicants to participate in civil \n14  immigration enforcement.  RJN, Ex. H, Nov. Press Release.  Defendants cannot seriously \n15  dispute that there is a reasonable expectation the same Attorney General could act on the \n16  same priorities this year and in future years.  \n17    Defendants also claim that the City can have no reasonable expectation of its injury \n18  recurring because it does not apply for the COPS grant every year.  Defs.’ Br. 13.  Los \n19  Angeles has, however, applied for the grant for the past two years.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 36.  \n20  Moreover, the City intends to apply for the COPS grant in the FY 2018 grant cycle.  \n21 \n                                                 \n22  1 Defendants’ reference to the “likelihood of future injury” standard for seeking \ninjunctive relief, Defs.’ Br. 12, is inapposite.  The “capable of repetition” doctrine is an \n23 \nexception to this standard.  When it applies, as it does here, it permits “suits for \n24  prospective relief to go forward” based only on a “reasonable expectation” of future \ninjury.  Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 481 (1990).  \n25 \n2 See, e.g., Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks on Sanctuary Jurisdictions, \n26 \nDOJ (March 27, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-jeff-\n27  sessions-delivers-remarks-sanctuary-jurisdictions. \n28 \n6 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 14 of 33   Page ID #:2078\n \n1  Decl. of Stella Larracas ¶ 5.  It is thus quite likely that Los Angeles will apply for the \n2  COPS grant again and face a competitive disadvantage in doing so—more than satisfying \n3  the “reasonable expectation” standard that does not even require a probability of future \n4  injury.3 \n5    Finally, there is a strong public interest in application of the “capable of repetition \n6  yet evading review” doctrine here.  See Los Angeles Cty. v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 643 \n7  (1979); Alaska Fish & Wildlife Fed’n & Outdoor Council, Inc. v. Dunkle, 829 F.2d 933, \n8  939 (9th Cir. 1987).  If Los Angeles is correct that DOJ is making grant determinations in \n9  an unconstitutional and unauthorized manner, the public has a profound interest in \n10  ensuring that this overreach of DOJ authority be stopped for future grant cycles.  But \n11  Defendants would require judicial review to be confined to the narrow window of time \n12  between the agency’s grant solicitation and announcement of awards.  Los Angeles \n13  attempted just that; there was no possibility of fully litigating the case during the window, \n14  and the City was persuaded to withdraw its request for a preliminary injunction by what \n15  turned out to be misrepresentations by DOJ.  See infra I.B.2.  The dubious manner in \n16  which Defendants induced the City to abandon its request for emergency relief for the FY \n17  2017 cycle only underscores the importance of resolving the legality of Defendants’ \n18  actions going forward. \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n3 Although it is sufficiently likely that Los Angeles will apply for a COPS grant in FY \n24  2018, Defendants are wrong to focus on whether the City’s future injury will recur in the \ncoming year.  See Wolfson v. Brammer, 616 F.3d 1045, 1054-55 (9th Cir. 2010) (election \n25 \nlaw challenge by former candidate not moot where the candidate intended to run again in \n26  the future, but not “in the next election”).  Even if the City’s historical record of applying \nfor the COPS grant 39% of the time were assumed to be predictive, that would almost \n27 \ncertainly mean that the City will apply for a COPS grant again during the present \n28  Administration. \n7 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 15 of 33   Page ID #:2079\n \n1 \n2.  Defendants Are Not Entitled To Summary Judgment On The \nQuestion Of Whether Los Angeles Would Have Received A FY \n2 \n2017 Award. \n3 \n  For the reasons explained above, the City plainly has a basis to seek prospective \n4 \nrelief; whether or not Los Angeles actually lost funding in the 2017 grant cycle due to use \n5 \nof the illegal immigration factors is irrelevant.  But if that question were relevant, it could \n6 \nnot be resolved against the City on summary judgment. \n7 \n  When the City moved for a preliminary injunction, a DOJ official claimed under \n8 \npenalty of perjury that no applicant that selected “Illegal Immigration” as a focus area \n9 \nscored high enough to receive further consideration.  Decl. of Andrew Dorr ¶ 24 (ECF \n10 \n33-1), Opp. to Pl.’s Mot. for Preliminary Injunction.  Defendants evidently considered \n11 \nthis “fact” relevant to their ultimate point: that Los Angeles allegedly would not receive \n12 \nan award regardless of the use of immigration-related factors, which persuaded the City \n13 \nto withdraw its application.  But Defendants’ representation, which it has now been \n14 \nrevealed was made before the scoring process was complete, turns out to have been false, \n15 \nas Defendants now admit.  Defs.’ Br. 8 n.3; Dorr Decl. ¶ 35 n.5 (ECF 53-1).  The same \n16 \ndeclarant, having retracted part of his earlier statement, still maintains that Los Angeles \n17 \ndid not lose an award on account of the Challenged Considerations.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 27 \n18 \n(ECF 53-1).  Perhaps so, but Defendants cannot reasonably expect the claims of an \n19 \nadmittedly unreliable declarant to carry the day on summary judgment without any \n20 \ndiscovery, especially when the COPS Office’s scoring data show that $8.5 million in FY \n21 \n2017 funding was awarded to jurisdictions that scored lower than Los Angeles but for \n22 \nbonuses resulting from the Challenged Considerations.  Dorr Decl. Ex. C & D (ECF 53-\n23 \n1) (specifically those large population agencies identified as “999,” “Laredo, City of,” \n24 \n“650,” “1029,” “889,” and “929”).  Before judgment could be granted in favor of \n25 \nDefendants, the City would need the opportunity for discovery on, among other things, \n26 \nhow the COPS Office calculated its scores and the factors affecting Los Angeles’ ability \n27 \nto receive a COPS grant.  To be clear, no discovery is necessary for the Court to grant the \n28 \n8 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 16 of 33   Page ID #:2080\n \n1  City’s motion for summary judgment for the reasons explained above, but Defendants are \n2  not entitled to summary judgment in their favor based on what they claim happened \n3  during the 2017 grant process on the current state of the record. \n4 \nII.  Plaintiff Is Entitled To Judgment As A Matter of Law. \n5 \nThis Court should grant Los Angeles’ motion for partial summary judgment, and \n6 \ndeny Defendants’ motion, because the Challenged Considerations are ultra vires, violate \n7 \nthe Spending Clause, and are arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure \n8 \nAct (“APA”). \n9 \nA.  The Challenged Considerations Are Ultra Vires. \n10 \nIn enacting the COPS program, Congress delegated authority to DOJ for a specific \n11 \npurpose: to fund states and localities in the hiring and rehiring of law enforcement \n12 \nofficers for “deployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  \n13 \nDefendants acknowledge this statutory purpose.  Defs.’ Br. 4.  And although they ignore \n14 \nit, they do not contest the basic principle that “[w]hen Congress limits the purpose for \n15 \nwhich a grant can be made, it can be presumed that it intends that the dispersing agency \n16 \nmakes its allocations based on factors solely related to the goal of implementing the \n17 \nstated statutory purposes in a reasonable fashion, rather than taking irrelevant or \n18 \nimpermissible factors into account.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 48 (D.C. Cir. \n19 \n1985) (emphasis added); see Pl.’s Br. 1-12. \n20 \nDOJ refuses to recognize that this inherent limit on Congress’s delegation binds \n21 \nthe agency, instead insisting on its prerogative to make award determinations based on \n22 \nimpermissible factors untethered to the statutory purpose.  First, DOJ is providing \n23 \npreferential treatment to states and localities that certify “partnership” with federal civil \n24 \nimmigration authorities, in the form of particular laws, regulations, or policies the \n25 \njurisdiction has in place (the “Notice and Access requirements”)—despite the fact that \n26 \nsuch partnership is unrelated to the need for, or use of, COPS funds.  Second, DOJ is \n27 \nawarding bonus points to, and authorizing COPS funds to be used by, state and local law \n28 \n9 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 17 of 33   Page ID #:2081\n \n1  enforcement agencies that are willing to use grant money to focus on “Illegal \n2  Immigration,” diverting COPS funds to federal immigration enforcement and away from \n3  their statutorily authorized purpose of state and local community policing. \n4  DOJ thus has structured the COPS grant process to incentivize states and local \n5  communities to change their laws and regulations to fit DOJ policy preferences, and to \n6  “focus” grant funds on matters having nothing to do with the statutory purpose of the \n7  grant program created by Congress.  Strikingly, when confronted with the extraordinary \n8  implications of their position, see Pl.’s Br. 15-16, Defendants do not deny them.  DOJ \n9  admits by its silence that it could use the COPS grant program to pressure states to \n10  abolish (or impose) capital punishment, to crack down on (or legalize) marijuana, to \n11  restrict (or expand) gun rights, and more.  Indeed, if Defendants prevail here, a later \n12  Administration could decide to punish COPS applicants from states that have non-\n13  preempted anti-immigration laws.  Cf. Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Whiting, 563 \n14  U.S. 582 (2011). \n15  Rather than explain how Congress could have meant to delegate so much authority \n16  sub silentio, Defendants attack a straw man.  If DOJ does not have complete discretion to \n17  make grant decisions based on any factor, they assert, the agency would be reduced to \n18  “choos[ing] the winning applicants via random lottery.”  Defs.’ Br. 15.  That is plainly \n19  not what the City is suggesting.  Congress delegated ample discretion for DOJ to make \n20  grant decisions based on its evaluation of the applicants’ need for, and proposed use of, \n21  grant funds, viewed in light of the significant guidance Congress provided on the purpose \n22  of the grant it authorized and what an applicant should include in its application.  It does \n23  not follow that DOJ may hijack the COPS program to promote the Attorney General’s \n24  own unrelated policy agenda.  The agency’s attempt to do so here is ultra vires. \n25   \n26   \n27   \n28 \n10 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 18 of 33   Page ID #:2082\n \n1 \n1.  DOJ Lacks Statutory Authority To Use The COPS Program To \nPressure States And Local Communities To Change Laws, \n2 \nRegulations, And Policies Unrelated To The Program As Created \n3 \nBy Congress. \n4  Defendants do not seriously dispute that the Notice and Access requirements are \n5  unrelated to a state’s or locality’s need for, or use of, COPS funds.  See Pl.’s Br. 12-13.  \n6  This concession establishes that the agency lacks authority to structure the grant program \n7  to disfavor communities that are unwilling or unable to certify to these forms of \n8  “partnership” with federal civil immigration authorities.  See Robbins, 780 F.2d at 48. \n9  The text and structure of the statute confirm that using the grant process to promote \n10  changes to unrelated local laws and policies was not authorized by Congress.  Rather, \n11  Congress authorized DOJ to use COPS funds to encourage states and localities to change \n12  their laws unrelated to the need for, or use of, COPS funds in only one area: laws on \n13  human trafficking victims.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2)-(3).  Specifically, the statute \n14  provides that DOJ “may” give “preferential consideration” to COPS applicants from \n15  states that adopt certain laws granting leniency to victims of human trafficking.  Id.  But \n16  in Defendants’ view, DOJ has inherent authority to give preferential consideration to \n17  state and local governments that adopt any law or regulation the agency wishes to \n18  promote.  If DOJ has this broad power, there would have been no reason for Congress to \n19  authorize one narrow use of such authority.  Defendants do not even attempt to deny that \n20  their reading of the statute would make subsection (c) superfluous.  \n21  Instead, Defendants note that the subsection (c) considerations are “not \n22  mandatory.”  Defs.’ Br. 16.  That does not help Defendants—it proves the City’s point.  \n23  If the statutory baseline were that DOJ is permitted to favor COPS applicants based on \n24  any unrelated laws and regulations, it would not have been superfluous for Congress to \n25  require the agency to favor applicants with respect to one such area, i.e., laws that protect \n26  victims of human trafficking.  But that is not what subsection (c) does, as DOJ \n27  recognizes.  By enacting that provision as “discretionary,” Defs.’ Br. 16, Congress \n28 \n11 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 19 of 33   Page ID #:2083\n \n1  recognized that without it, DOJ lacked the discretion to favor or disfavor applicants based \n2  on their laws and regulations. \n3  Defendants next insist that if subsection (c) means what it says, DOJ would be able \n4  to consider only whether an applicant has the preferred laws against human trafficking in \n5  place, and otherwise would have to draw lots to make grant awards.  See Defs.’ Br. 16 & \n6  n.6.  This is a straw man.  DOJ has ample discretion to weigh an applicant’s need for \n7  COPS funds, and its proposed use of such funds.  See infra II.A.3.  Recognizing that DOJ \n8  cannot generally give preferential treatment based on applicants’ unrelated laws and \n9  policies hardly turns grant determinations into a lottery. \n10  Without any express statutory authority allowing them to use COPS grants to \n11  promote their preferred state and local laws and policies concerning federal civil \n12  immigration enforcement, Defendants invert separation of powers principles.  They insist \n13  that they must have authority to use the federal grant program to induce state and local \n14  policy changes, because “nothing in the governing statutes or case law prohibits DOJ \n15  from” doing so.  Defs.’ Br. 19 (emphasis added).  That is backwards: it is fundamental \n16  that courts will not “presume a delegation of power absent an express withholding of \n17  such power,” or else “agencies would enjoy virtually limitless hegemony.”  Ry. Labor \n18  Execs. Ass’n v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 29 F.3d 655, 671 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (en banc) (as \n19  amended). \n20  Even more brazenly, Defendants distort the Supreme Court’s seminal Spending \n21  Clause decision in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), describing it as follows: \n22  “the Supreme Court has made clear that a federal agency can use grant conditions as a \n23  ‘relatively mild encouragement’ for States and localities to change their laws and \n24  policies.”  Defs.’ Br. 19 (quoting Dole, 483 U.S. at 211) (emphasis added).  What Dole \n25  actually says is that Congress can use federal grants to encourage states to change their \n26  laws and policies.  See Dole, 483 U.S. at 208 (addressing a “condition imposed by \n27  Congress”).  It is revealing that Defendants conflate the authority of Congress and that of \n28  a federal agency. \n12 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 20 of 33   Page ID #:2084\n \n1  Indeed, the difference between what Congress may do and what an agency may do \n2  is critical here, where federalism concerns are paramount.  When federalism is at stake, \n3  Congress—not an agency—must supply a clear statement of its intentions to encroach on \n4  traditional state and local prerogatives.  See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 461 \n5  (1991).  The en banc Fourth Circuit held that the Gregory “clear statement rule” applies \n6  when an agency attempts to use the terms of a grant to pressure states and localities to \n7  change their laws and policies.  See Com. Va., Dep’t of Educ. v. Riley, 106 F.3d 559, 566-\n8  67 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (adopting the dissenting panel opinion of Luttig, J.), \n9  superseded by statute; Pl.’s Br. 14.  Although Defendants assert that Gregory “does not \n10  apply” in such circumstances, Defs.’ Br. 19, they do not mention the en banc court of \n11  appeals decision that disagrees with their view.  Congress itself provided a clear \n12  statement to authorize DOJ to give preference to applicants based on their state and local \n13  laws against human trafficking, see 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2), (3); there is no such clear \n14  statement authorizing DOJ to do the same with respect to civil immigration enforcement. \n15  The broader statutory scheme makes it even clearer that Congress did not intend \n16  for DOJ to use COPS funds to extract unrelated policy concessions from states and \n17  localities related to their state and local law enforcement operations.  Section 10228 \n18  prohibits federal agencies from “exercis[ing] any direction, supervision, or control over \n19  any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any political \n20  subdivision thereof.”  See Pl.’s Br. 14-15 (emphasis added).  Congress enacted section \n21  10228 to prevent exactly what DOJ seeks to do here—exercise “control over . . .  ‘vital \n22  matters pertaining to the day-to-day operations of local law enforcement.’”  Ely v. Velde, \n23  451 F.2d 1130, 1136 (4th Cir. 1971) (quoting S. Rep. No. 90-1097 at 222 (1968)) \n24  (discussing 42 U.S.C. § 3766(a), an earlier version of section 10228(a)).  Congress was \n25  not just worried about literal mandates, but the use of “federal assistance to state and \n26  local law enforcement” as a “vehicle for the imposition of federal guidelines” on such \n27  agencies.  S. Rep. No. 90-1097, 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2276 (1968) (views of \n28  Senators Dirksen, Hruska, Scott, and Thurmond).

Specifically, DOJ uses its control over valuable federal funds to “encourage” \n8  state and local governments to certify that they have specific laws or policies in place \n9  governing who may enter their detention facilities and what their state and local law \n10  enforcement personnel must do.  See Pl.’s Br. 7.  If Defendants mean to suggest that this \n11  is not “direction, supervision, or control” because DOJ is only pressuring, not mandating, \n12  states and localities to make these certifications, that is entirely at odds with the \n13  congressional purpose of preventing federal grants from being a vehicle to change state \n14  and local law enforcement operations.  It also would make section 10228 the second \n15  statutory provision Defendants would make a nullity, doing nothing but reiterating the \n16  Tenth Amendment anti-commandeering rule.5 \n17  “If Congress has not unequivocally conditioned receipt of federal funds in the \n18  manner claimed by the [agency], . . . then [the] inquiry is at an end.”  Riley, 106 F.3d at \n19  566.  Here, not only is there no such clear statement, but every indication on the face of \n20 \n21                                                   \n4 Controlling Crime Through More Effective Law Enforcement: Hearings Before the \n22 \nSubcomm. on Criminal Laws and Procedure of the S.

Defendants neglect to quote the text that immediately follows, which \nmakes clear that the statute is concerned with promoting cooperation to address “white-\n27 \ncollar crime and public corruption.”  34 U.S.C. § 10122(c)(2)(F).  That statute could not \n28  have less relevance here. \n14 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 22 of 33   Page ID #:2086\n \n1  the statute points in the opposite direction.  Congress did not intend to authorize DOJ to \n2  disfavor COPS grant applicants if they were not willing to adopt unrelated laws or \n3  policies.  DOJ’s preferential treatment for COPS applicants that are willing to certify to \n4  their immigration “partnership” is therefore unlawful. \n5 \n2.  DOJ Cannot Divert Funds That Congress Designated For \n6  Community Policing To Federal Civil Immigration Enforcement.  \nDOJ is also awarding “bonus points” to applicants who promise to focus their use \n7 \nof grant funds on “Illegal Immigration” by “propos[ing] ways to contribute to combatting \n8 \nillegal immigration,” Defs.’ Br. 1.  Congress, however, authorized DOJ to provide funds \n9 \nto states and localities under the COPS program for the hiring, or rehiring, of state and \n10 \nlocal law enforcement officers for “deployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 \n11 \nU.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  Nowhere in their brief do Defendants explain how Congress’s \n12 \nobjective of funding the hiring of state and local officers to engage in “community-\n13 \noriented policing” has anything to do with such officers partnering with federal officials \n14 \nto enforce federal civil immigration law.  That is a tacit admission by Defendants that \n15 \nthey are acting ultra vires. \n16 \nDOJ’s attempt to funnel COPS funds to an area that is “unquestionably exclusively \n17 \na federal power,” DeCanas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351, 354 (1976), does not advance \n18 \n“community-oriented policing.”  Community policing, the COPS Office itself explains, \n19 \n“begins with a commitment to building trust and mutual respect between police and \n20 \ncommunities.”  RJN Ex. A, “About.”  The types of activities funded through the “Illegal \n21 \nImmigration” focus area do not involve the local community at all; they require \n22 \npartnership between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.  See RJN \n23 \nEx. F, DOJ FY 2018 COPS Office Congressional Justification at 31 (characterizing the \n24 \n“Illegal Immigration” focus area as “[p]artnering with federal law enforcement”); Defs.’ \n25 \nBr. 18 (observing that, apart from a formal agreement with the federal government, state \n26 \nand local officers can assist in federal immigration enforcement by “providing [federal \n27 \nauthorities] access to aliens they have detained or informing federal authorities of the \n28 \n15 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 23 of 33   Page ID #:2087\n \n1  impending release of such persons”).  Congress was not seeking to “build[] trust” \n2  between local police and federal immigration officials; its intent, as DOJ recognizes \n3  outside the context of this litigation, was to improve relationships between local police \n4  and the communities they serve. \n5  The closest Defendants come to a defense of this scoring factor is to insist that “the \n6  intersection of illegal immigration and crime is a serious public safety issue that can \n7  helpfully be addressed through ‘cooperative efforts’ among federal, state, and local law \n8  enforcement.”  Defs.’ Br. 23.  This premise is unsupported, but it is also irrelevant: the \n9  fact that something is a “public safety issue” does not mean it is a “community-oriented \n10  policing issue.”  All policing has to do with public safety, but Congress did not authorize \n11  COPS funds to hire officers for “deployment in policing” generally. \n12  Defendants also twist the words of the statute to suggest that Congress intended to \n13  promote cooperation between federal and local law enforcement.  Defs.’ Br. 23 (citing \n14  Pub. L. No. 103-322).  The “cooperation” Congress intended to promote is quite clearly \n15  “cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and members of the community.”  \n16  Pub. L. No. 103-322 (emphasis added).  Cooperation among federal, state, and local law \n17  enforcement is not cooperation “between law enforcement agencies and members of the \n18  community.” \n19  In fact, the types of “cooperation” that DOJ encourages would likely damage the \n20  cooperation between local law enforcement and the community that Congress intended to \n21  support.  Through the COPS grant, DOJ has offered to sponsor 287(g) partnerships, in \n22  which state and local law enforcement officers act as federal immigration officers.  See 8 \n23  U.S.C. § 1357(g).  As Los Angeles explained, and Defendants do not dispute, local law \n24  enforcement officers “[c]arrying out civil immigration raids in support of federal \n25  enforcement efforts bears no logical connection” to community policing.  Pl.’s Br. 17.  \n26  DOJ’s preference for applicants that will use grant funds to honor federal detainer \n27  requests for certain immigrants, see Dorr Decl. ¶ 24, is likewise unrelated to community \n28  policing.  In fact, this practice has led to municipality liability due to Fourth Amendment \n16 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 24 of 33   Page ID #:2088\n \n1  violations—hardly the type of police-community relationship that Congress intended.  \n2  See Pl.’s Br. 17 (collecting cases).    \n3  DOJ’s interpretation of its authority disregards not only the COPS statute, but also \n4  federal immigration law.  As Los Angeles previously explained, Pl.’s Br. 18, DOJ’s \n5  funding of local officers to serve as federal immigration officers in 287(g) partnerships \n6  violates Congress’s directive that such partnerships be undertaken “at the expense of the \n7  State or political subdivision.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1).  Defendants’ sole response is that \n8  “any funds awarded under a CHP grant would have to be used to hire or rehire officers \n9  pursuant to the requirements of the Program, not for any state or local expenses of a \n10  287(g) agreement.”  Defs.’ Br. 18 n.8.  But they do not deny that DOJ will be funding the \n11  hiring of state and local officers to engage in immigration enforcement under 287(g) \n12  agreements.  And the Department of Homeland Security has made clear that “expenses” \n13  under such an agreement include the “salaries” of personnel.6  Thus, it is clear that DOJ is \n14  using COPS funds to pay the salaries of state and local officers in 287(g) partnerships, \n15  and in doing so, violating Congress’s prohibition against federal funding of those \n16  partnerships. \n17  By favoring applicants that adopt “Illegal Immigration” as a focus area, DOJ is \n18  acting without statutory authority, diverting COPS funds from their authorized statutory \n19  purpose, and punishing applicants that seek COPS funds for programs that are actually \n20  related to community-oriented policing. \n21 \n3.  The Choice Before The Court Is Not Unfettered Agency Power Or \n22  Grant Awards Chosen By Lottery. \nUnable to explain how Congress authorized the immigration-related factors that \n23 \nDOJ has made the centerpiece of the COPS program, Defendants resort to hyperbole.  In \n24 \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n6 See Memorandum of Understanding, available at https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-\n28  reform/pdf/287g_moa.pdf (emphasis added).   \n17 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 25 of 33   Page ID #:2089\n \n1  their telling, if DOJ lacks the expansive authority they claim, COPS awards would have \n2  to be allocated randomly.  See Defs.’ Br. 15.  That is nonsense. \n3  It is of course permissible for DOJ to consider a community’s crime-fighting needs \n4  in determining which applicants should receive funds to hire officers to engage in \n5  community-oriented policing.  Congress specifically required COPS applicants to \n6  “demonstrate a specific public safety need” related to community policing, 34 U.S.C. \n7  § 10382(c)(2); see also id. § 10382(c)(10) (applicant must “explain how the grant will be \n8  utilized to reorient the affected law enforcement agency’s mission toward community-\n9  oriented policing or enhance its involvement in or commitment to community-oriented \n10  policing”).  This necessarily means Congress expected DOJ to consider those public \n11  safety needs.  And having been delegated authority to evaluate applications in part on the \n12  basis of public safety needs, DOJ can reasonably “prioritiz[e] different areas of public \n13  safety from year to year,” so long as they can be addressed by community policing.  \n14  Defs.’ Br. 16.  Likewise, since Congress provided DOJ the authority to issue grants for \n15  use in community-oriented policing, and required applicants to explain how any grant \n16  funds they receive will do so, see 34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(10), the agency can plainly make \n17  discretionary judgments about which grant proposals best serve that purpose.  These \n18  factors alone leave DOJ with substantial discretion; the fact that this discretion is not \n19  limitless does not mean that the agency must conduct a lottery. \n20  Defendants also note various considerations DOJ has used in the past to award \n21  bonus points, asserting that every one of them would fail under the City’s approach.  \n22  Those considerations are not before the Court and there is no need for the Court to opine \n23  on them; if an applicant is aggrieved by a particular scoring factor and believes it is \n24  unlawful, that applicant is free to bring its own challenge.  But the past considerations \n25  DOJ has identified are consistent with the COPS authorizing statute—unlike its novel \n26  immigration-related considerations. \n27  For example, Defendants suggest that if the City prevails, DOJ could not award \n28  additional consideration to jurisdictions “that have recently experienced a catastrophic \n18 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 26 of 33   Page ID #:2090\n \n1  event.”  Defs.’ Br. 16.  But as Defendants’ own declarant explains, the purpose of this \n2  consideration is to favor applicants that have experienced “tragedies or disasters \n3  impacting law enforcement.”  Dorr Decl. ¶ 18 (emphasis added).  It is consistent with the \n4  statutory text and intent of Congress for DOJ to consider an event that negatively impacts \n5  law enforcement resources for community policing as part of the applicant’s public safety \n6  need and its “inability to address the need without Federal assistance,” 34 U.S.C. \n7  § 10382(c)(3).  Jurisdictions suffering from a catastrophic event can be expected to divert \n8  resources to respond to the tragedy and away from community policing, so ensuring that \n9  COPS funds are available to help make up the difference is eminently reasonable.  Other \n10  considerations Defendants note—for flexibility in shift assignments and an “early \n11  intervention system” for officers showing signs of stress, see Defs.’ Br. 19—have \n12  everything to do with the statutory purpose of hiring officers for community-oriented \n13  policing.  Indeed, the consequences to police-community relations of not timely \n14  identifying officers under stress are all too real.7 \n15  Even if, for the sake of argument, DOJ had pushed the boundaries of its delegated \n16  authority in the past, there is no risk that a ruling for Los Angeles would broadly \n17  undermine the way DOJ has historically administered the COPS program.  DOJ’s \n18  immigration-related considerations, which have no mooring in the statutory purpose of \n19  the grant and are contradicted by the direction Congress provided, are a new and \n20  unlawful invention by the Attorney General. \n21 \n22                                                   \n7 Defendants also observe that DOJ gave additional consideration for the hiring of \n23 \nmilitary veterans before Congress authorized the agency to “prioritiz[e] the hiring and \n24  training of veterans,” 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(2).  Defs.’ Br. 7.  This consideration had to \ndo with the hiring of officers, which is at the core of the statutory grant authorization.  \n25 \nMoreover, if any inference is to be drawn from Congress’s codification of this factor, it is \n26  that Congress was concerned that DOJ did not have sufficient authorization for it without \na more specific enactment.  Cf. Schism v. United States, 316 F.3d 1259, 1289 (Fed. Cir. \n27 \n2002) (noting that Congress may act to ratify action that was “unauthorized when taken” \n28  (emphasis added)). \n19 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 27 of 33   Page ID #:2091\n \n1 \nB.  The Challenged Considerations Violate The Spending Clause Because \nDefendants Cannot Identify Any Reasonable Relationship They Bear To \n2 \nThe Community Policing Purpose Of The COPS Program. \n3 \n  A state’s or locality’s willingness to certify compliance with the Notice and Access \n4 \nrequirements, or to use COPS funds to participate in civil immigration enforcement, \n5 \nmade a significant difference in the applicant’s ability to compete for federal funds.  See \n6 \nDorr Decl. ¶ 35.  In fact, in some cases, these were the dispositive factors in whether a \n7 \njurisdiction received a grant.  Id.; see also id. (stating that 19 out of 30 successful large \n8 \njurisdictions and 124 out of 149 successful small jurisdictions complied with the Notice \n9 \nand Access requirements).  When DOJ announced the 2017 awards, it even boasted about \n10 \nhow effective these inducements were.  RJN Ex. H, Nov. Press Release.  The Challenged \n11 \nConsiderations thus operate as terms or conditions on the receipt of COPS funds, and so \n12 \nmust comply with constitutional restrictions on funding conditions. \n13 \n  The Supreme Court has clearly established that congressional conditions on the \n14 \nreceipt of federal funds “must . . . bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal \n15 \nspending.”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167 (1992).  As discussed above, \n16 \nCongress did not delegate DOJ authority to impose conditions related to immigration \n17 \nenforcement on COPS grants.  But even if DOJ had authority to use the Challenged \n18 \nConsiderations, they violate the Spending Clause’s requirement that conditions be \n19 \n“reasonably related” to the purposes of the grant program, Nevada v. Skinner, 884 F.2d \n20 \n445, 447 (9th Cir. 1989), because enforcement of federal civil immigration laws is \n21 \nunrelated to the COPS grant’s purpose of promoting community-oriented policing.  \n22 \nDefendants offer no serious argument to the contrary.   \n23 \n  Community-oriented policing, in DOJ’s own words, entails “developing \n24 \npartnerships between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.”  RJN \n25 \nEx. F, DOJ FY 2018 COPS Office Congressional Justification at 4 (emphasis added); see \n26 \nalso RJN Ex. A, “About,” (“Community policing begins with a commitment to building \n27 \ntrust and mutual respect between police and communities.”).  It is not, as DOJ contends \n28 \n20 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 28 of 33   Page ID #:2092\n \n1  for the first time here, about developing partnerships between state and local law \n2  enforcement and the federal government.  Defs.’ Br. 23.  DOJ attempts to argue that \n3  enforcement of federal civil immigration law is reasonably related to state and local law \n4  enforcement by asserting that enforcement of federal immigration law “makes \n5  communities safer.”  Id.  This argument is itself unsupportable, see Philadelphia v. \n6  Sessions, 2017 WL 5489476 at *48 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 15, 2017) (“Immigration law has \n7  nothing to do with the enforcement of local criminal laws.”), appeal filed (3d Cir. Jan. 18, \n8  2018), but more importantly, DOJ makes no argument as to how mandating state and \n9  local enforcement of federal immigration law is related to community policing.  DOJ’s \n10  only way to show that its considerations relate to the statutory purpose is to read the \n11  words “community-oriented” out of the statute, and treat the purpose of the grant as \n12  anything related to “policing.”  See supra II.A.2.  But federal agencies are bound by the \n13  statutes that Congress enacts.  Because the Challenged Considerations have no \n14  relationship to “community-oriented policing,” they cannot pass muster under the \n15  Spending Clause.   \n16    The unrelated provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act which DOJ cites \n17  as evidence of congressional intent to involve states and localities in enforcement of \n18  federal civil immigration laws, Defs.’ Br. 23, provide no better support for their \n19  contention that federal civil immigration enforcement is related to community policing.  \n20  Rather, they show that when Congress intended to include state and local governments in \n21  federal immigration enforcement, it authorized such participation explicitly—belying the \n22  contention that immigration enforcement should be generally considered related to state \n23  and local policing.  Because the Challenged Considerations are unrelated to—and if \n24  anything may actively undermine—the goals of community policing, they violate the \n25  relatedness prong of the Spending Clause.    \n26  C.  The Challenged Considerations Are Arbitrary And Capricious. \n27    DOJ’s adoption of the Challenged Considerations was arbitrary and capricious in \n28  violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), because the agency failed to \n21 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 29 of 33   Page ID #:2093\n \n1  contemporaneously articulate a “reasonable basis . . . for the decision.”  Alaska Oil & \n2  Gas Ass’n v. Jewell, 815 F.3d 544, 554 (9th Cir. 2016).  \n3    Even if it were possible for conditions requiring state and local enforcement of \n4  federal civil immigration laws to be related to community policing, DOJ at no point \n5  explains how the Challenged Considerations are related to the goals of the COPS statute \n6  as enacted by Congress.  It thus entirely failed to “articulate[] a rational connection \n7  between the facts found and the choice made.”  Az. Cattle Growers’ Ass’n v. U.S. Fish & \n8  Wildlife, Bureau of Land Mgmt., 273 F.3d 1229, 1236 (9th Cir. 2001).  In its brief, \n9  Defendants do not point to any instance on the record in which DOJ or Attorney General \n10  Sessions explained the connection between the immigration factors and community \n11  policing, instead stating that, “[n]othing in the statutes governing CHP suggests DOJ \n12  should not consider the extent to which a jurisdiction cooperates in the enforcement of \n13  immigration law . . . .”  Defs.’ Br. 24-25 (emphasis added).  As the City argues above, the \n14  immigration conditions are in fact inconsistent with the COPS statute.  But even if they \n15  were not, the APA demands more than that agency action not be clearly inconsistent with \n16  the text of a statute; it requires that the agency contemporaneously explain the basis for \n17  its decisions.  See Pacific Coast Fed’n of Fishermen’s Ass’ns v. U.S. Bureau of \n18  Reclamation, 426 F.3d 1082, 1091 (9th Cir. 2005) (“It is a basic principle of \n19  administrative law that the agency must articulate the reason or reasons for its \n20  decision.”).  DOJ failed to do so, and Defendants’ brief does not argue otherwise. \n21    DOJ also misunderstands the City’s reliance on studies showing either no \n22  relationship, or an inverse relationship between so-called “sanctuary” policies and violent \n23  crime.  See Pl.’s Br. 22.  The point is not that the City has identified studies supporting a \n24  “difference in view” from DOJ.  Defs.’ Br. 25.  It is that the Attorney General identified \n25  these studies as supporting his actions, but misread them—according to their authors.  \n26  See Pl.’s Br. 22. (citing ECF 49-3, Ex. C).  When an agency acts on the basis of evidence \n27  that means the opposite of what it says, that is arbitrary and capricious.  Cf. Defenders of \n28  Wildlife v. Jewell, 176 F. Supp. 3d 975, 1004 (D. Mont. 2016) (holding that an agency \n22 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 30 of 33   Page ID #:2094\n \n1  decision relying on “an implausible misinterpretation [of a study] that runs counter to \n2  [its] intent” was “arbitrary and capricious”).  Los Angeles is not challenging a policy \n3  disagreement, but an agency decision that is not supported by the very evidence it cites, \n4  and so lacks a rational basis. \n5 \nIII.  An Injunction Barring Defendants From Using The Invalid Considerations Is \n6  Appropriate. \nThis Court may issue what Defendants term a “nationwide” injunction, meaning an \n7 \ninjunction that prevents Defendants from continuing to act unlawfully with respect to \n8 \neveryone but the Plaintiff here.  See, e.g., Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 \n9 \n(1979) (“nationwide” injunction appropriate where “necessary to provide complete relief \n10 \nto the plaintiffs”).  Indeed, both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits recently affirmed a broad \n11 \ninjunction against an Executive Branch action in all its applications, including as to \n12 \naffected individuals not party to the case.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1166-67 \n13 \n(9th Cir. 2017); see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by an \n14 \nequally divided court, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (affirming a broad injunction against a \n15 \nfederal immigration policy in all its applications and not limited to the plaintiffs before \n16 \nthe court).  An injunction that prevents DOJ from applying its unlawful policy is \n17 \nparticularly necessary here because DOJ’s preferential treatment of COPS applicants who \n18 \nadopt DOJ’s preferred immigration policies over those, like Los Angeles, who do not, is \n19 \ninvalid on its face.  See, e.g., Decker v. O’Donnell, 661 F.2d 598, 617-18 (7th Cir. 1980) \n20 \n(affirming nationwide injunction in case of facial challenge to legality of agency \n21 \nregulation); Santa Clara v. Trump, 2017 WL 5569835, at *17 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017), \n22 \nappeal filed (9th Cir. Dec. 14, 2017).  \n23 \nDefendants suggest in one sentence in a footnote that “any injunction should be \n24 \nlimited to the plaintiff rather than applying to all CHP applicants.”  Defs.’ Br. 11 n.4.  \n25 \nApart from the absence of any actual argument supporting their position, Defendants fail \n26 \nto explain how an injunction could be tailored only to Los Angeles when the issue is \n27 \nDOJ’s preferential treatment of other applicants.  See Washington, 847 F.3d at 1167 \n28 \n23 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 31 of 33   Page ID #:2095\n \n1  (nationwide relief appropriate where government had not proposed a workable alternative \n2  form that would remedy the violation).  The City is not injured because it loses points \n3  itself, but because its competitors are unlawfully given extra points.  Los Angeles’ \n4  request for an even playing field for COPS applicants necessarily requires across-the-\n5  board relief.  Cf. Easyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. v. Hannigan, 92 F.3d 1486, 1501-02 \n6  (9th Cir. 1996) (“[A]n injunction is not necessarily made overbroad by extending benefit \n7  or protection to persons other than prevailing parties in the lawsuit—even if it is not a \n8  class action—if such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which \n9  they are entitled.” (citation and emphasis omitted)); Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, \n10  1171 (9th Cir. 1987) (affirming nationwide relief where “the district court could hardly \n11  require enforcement of the [statute] on anything other than a nationwide basis”).  \n12  Accordingly, this Court should issue an injunction prohibiting DOJ from using the \n13  Challenged Considerations in making COPS grant determinations in future grant cycles. \n14  CONCLUSION \n15  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant partial summary judgment to the \n16  City of Los Angeles as to each of its claims concerning the COPS grant program (Counts \n17  Four, Five, and Six), deny Defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment, and enter \n18  final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) on those claims.  The Court should declare that the \n19  Challenged Considerations are (1) ultra vires and a violation of the Separation of Powers, \n20  (2) in violation of the Spending Clause, and (3) an arbitrary and capricious agency action \n21  in violation of the APA.  The Court should further enjoin Defendants from using the \n22  Challenged Considerations in making COPS grant determinations in future grant cycles. \n23   \n24   \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n24 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 32 of 33   Page ID #:2096\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 59   Filed 01/29/18   Page 33 of 33   Page ID #:2097\n \n1  CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n2  I hereby certify that on this 29th day of January, 2018, the within document and its \n3  attachments were electronically filed with the Clerk of the Court using the CM/ECF \n4  system and will be sent electronically to the registered participants as identified on the \n5  Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF), pursuant to Local Rule 5-3.2. \n6   \n7  /s/   Mitchell A.

Defendants assert that DOJ may transform a grant \n4  program that Congress expressly designed to support the hiring of state and local officers \n5  for “deployment in community-oriented policing” (the “COPS grant”), into a tool to \n6  pressure states and localities to adopt the unrelated immigration policy preferences of the \n7  Attorney General.  In Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2017, that preference was for states and \n8  localities to “partner” with federal immigration authorities, and otherwise participate in \n9  enforcing federal civil immigration law (the “Challenged Considerations”).  In future \n10  years, if DOJ has this authority, the Attorney General might decide to favor states that \n11  abolish the death penalty (or promise to impose it more frequently); or states that \n12  strengthen (or relax) their gun laws; or states that criminalize (or legalize) marijuana.  \n13  The ways in which DOJ might, in the future, use an unrelated grant program to induce \n14  sovereign states to change their laws and policies are limitless.   \n15  Congress did not silently grant such a power when it authorized DOJ to administer \n16  a grant program for the hiring of state and local officers to engage in community policing.  \n17  Remarkably, after Los Angeles highlighted the sweeping implications of Defendants’ \n18  position, Defendants did not attempt to suggest any limit on what DOJ may do under the \n19  guise of administering the COPS grant.  Instead, they resorted to arguing against a straw \n20  man: DOJ must have the power to favor or disfavor applicants on any grounds the \n21  Attorney General pleases, or else DOJ would be reduced to selecting grant recipients by \n22  random lottery.  This hyperbole cannot be squared with the statute.  Congress defined the \n23  contours of the COPS program and left the agency administering it with substantial room \n24  to exercise its judgment within the confines of that program and its purposes.  It does not \n25  follow that DOJ can use its control over the purse strings to pressure states and localities \n26  to adopt unrelated laws and policies, or to divert grant funds to a purpose having nothing \n27  to do with community-oriented policing. \n28 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 9 of 33   Page ID #:2030\n \n1  Rather than confront the City’s arguments, Defendants ignore or implicitly \n2  concede them.  For example, Defendants do not dispute that their interpretation of the \n3  COPS statute would render superfluous the only provision in which Congress did \n4  authorize DOJ to give preference to an applicant based on its adoption of policies \n5  unrelated to the need for, or use of, COPS grant funds.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2)-(3) \n6  (permitting preferential consideration to be given to states with certain laws providing for \n7  lenient treatment of human trafficking victims).  That provision confirms that Congress \n8  did not intend to empower DOJ to use COPS grants to obtain other unrelated policy \n9  concessions from states and localities.  \n10  Defendants also do not provide an explanation for how combating illegal \n11  immigration relates to Congress’s goal to fund community policing.  They instead invoke \n12  the “belie[f]” of the COPS Office (Defs.’ Br. 23) that illegal immigration is a public \n13  safety issue.  Even assuming arguendo that this “belie[f]” were based in fact—which it is \n14  not—Congress did not create the COPS program to fund any kind of policing that relates \n15  to an asserted public safety interest.  The agency cannot disregard the express statutory \n16  purpose of a grant program it is charged with administering, and Defendants offer no \n17  explanation for why they may do so here.   \n18  Defendants also seek to insulate this usurpation of Legislative Branch authority \n19  from review by the Judicial Branch.  They claim the case is moot because, on the \n20  unilateral declaration of a COPS Office employee, Los Angeles would not have received \n21  a 2017 grant anyway.  Defendants ask the Court to treat this representation as conclusive \n22  despite admitting a material misrepresentation in their rush to make a similar claim in \n23  response to the City’s application for a preliminary injunction, which ultimately caused \n24  the City to withdraw that motion.  More fundamentally, however, it does not matter what \n25  would have happened in the 2017 grant cycle.  Los Angeles plainly has standing to \n26  challenge the competitive injury it suffered, and an annual grant program is the paradigm \n27  case for the “capable of repetition, yet evading review” exception to mootness.  There is \n28  more than a reasonable expectation that Los Angeles will apply for another COPS \n2 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 10 of 33   Page ID #:2031\n \n1  grant—indeed, it intends to do so this year—and that DOJ will use improper \n2  immigration-related considerations to disfavor the City.  Defendants cannot benefit from \n3  their misrepresentation—which eliminated any possibility of obtaining preliminary relief \n4  for the 2017 grant cycle—and then use the short timeframe in which COPS funding is \n5  applied for and granted to insulate from review their unlawful overreach of federal \n6  agency authority.  \n7  The Court should therefore grant partial summary judgment to Plaintiff, deny \n8  Defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment, and enter final judgment under \n9  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) in favor of Plaintiff on Counts Four, Five, and Six; \n10  declare that Defendants’ actions are unlawful; and enjoin them from administering the \n11  COPS program in this unlawful manner going forward. \n12  ARGUMENT \n13 \nI.  Defendants’ Attempt To Evade Judicial Review Fails. \n14 \nA.  Los Angeles Has Standing Because It Suffered Competitive Injury In \n15  The 2017 COPS Grant Cycle. \n16    This is a case of competitive harm: the federal agency charged with awarding \n17  grants consistent with a congressional statute, here DOJ, unlawfully favored Los \n18  Angeles’ competitors for a federal grant, and the City sued to restore the competition to a \n19  level, and lawful, playing field.  “Such competitive injuries have often been recognized as \n20  grounds for standing.”  Bullfrog Films, Inc. v. Wick, 847 F.2d 502, 506 (9th Cir. 1988).  \n21  Thus, “when challenged agency conduct allegedly renders a person unable to fairly \n22  compete for some benefit, that person has suffered a sufficient ‘injury in fact’ and has \n23  standing.”  Preston v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1359, 1365 (9th Cir. 1984); see also Regents of \n24  the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 281 n.14 (1978). \n25    In such cases, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to show that it would have \n26  received the award, contract, or other benefit it sought but for the unfair disadvantage it \n27  faced.  “[T]he ‘injury in fact’ is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the \n28  bidding process, not the loss of a contract” or other benefit.

Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993); see \n2  also Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995) (“[Plaintiff] need not \n3  demonstrate that it has been, or will be, the low bidder on a Government contract. . . .  \n4  The aggrieved party ‘need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the \n5  barrier in order to establish standing.’” (internal citation omitted)); Coral Const. Co. v. \n6  King Cty., 941 F.2d 910, 930 (9th Cir. 1991) (stating that a construction company \n7  challenging a set-aside for women-owned businesses was injured “every time the \n8  company simply places a bid”). \n9    “The existence of standing turns on the facts as they existed at the time the plaintiff \n10  filed the complaint.”  Skaff v. Meridien N. Am. Beverly Hills, LLC, 506 F.3d 832, 838 \n11  (9th Cir. 2007).  Los Angeles filed this lawsuit after DOJ announced that it would give \n12  preferential treatment to COPS applicants based on unlawful considerations, and before \n13  DOJ made awards on the basis of the Challenged Considerations.  The City did not agree \n14  to DOJ’s demands in order to receive the preferential treatment accorded to its \n15  competitors, and so was forced to compete on an uneven playing field.  This injury more \n16  than suffices to establish the City’s standing. \n17 \nB.  The Case Is Not Moot. \n18 \n  Defendants offer no argument that the City’s competitive injury did not provide it \n19 \nstanding at the time it filed its complaint.  Instead, Defendants argue that later \n20 \ndevelopments mooted the case: DOJ issued the 2017 COPS awards on November 20, \n21 \n2017, Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) (ECF 49-3) Ex. H, Nov. Press Release, and—\n22 \naccording to the unilateral assertions of Defendants—the City would not have won an \n23 \naward anyway.  There are reasons to doubt Defendants’ representations at this stage of \n24 \nthe litigation, particularly since they have already admitted to making a misrepresentation \n25 \nrelated to this question in an earlier filing.

The “Capable of Repetition, Yet Evading Review” Doctrine \n4  Applies. \n  There is a well-established exception to mootness where “(1) ‘the challenged \n5 \naction [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,’ \n6 \nand (2) ‘there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be \n7 \nsubject to the same action again.’”  Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States, \n8 \n136 S. Ct. 1969, 1976 (2016) (quoting Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17 (1998)).  \n9 \nAgency actions lasting only one or two years evade judicial review as a matter of law.  \n10 \nSee id. (“We have previously held that a period of two years is too short to complete \n11 \njudicial review of the lawfulness of the procurement.”); see also Karuk Tribe of Cal. v. \n12 \nU.S. Forest Serv., 681 F.3d 1006, 1017-18 (9th Cir. 2012) (“We have repeatedly held that \n13 \nsimilar actions lasting only one or two years evade review.”).  Since COPS grants are \n14 \nawarded annually, see Decl. of Andrew Dorr ¶ 10 (ECF 53-1), DOJ’s unlawful \n15 \nadministration of those awards necessarily would evade review.  See Wright & Miller, \n16 \nFed. Prac. & Proc. § 3533.8 (3d ed. 2017) (noting the “wide array of circumstances [that] \n17 \nhave led courts to deny mootness” as capable of repetition yet evading review, including \n18 \n“disputes over the terms or awards of government contracts or grants [which] often \n19 \ninvolve short contract periods and repeat bidders”). \n20 \n  In order to establish the second prong of the capable of repetition doctrine, all a \n21 \nplaintiff must show is a “reasonable expectation,” rather than a “mere physical or \n22 \ntheoretical possibility,” that it will be subject to the challenged action in the future.  \n23 \nMurphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 483 (1982).  This standard is “not a very demanding one.”  \n24 \nBarilla v. Ervin, 886 F.2d 1514, 1520 (9th Cir. 1989), overruled on other grounds by \n25 \nSimpson v. Lear Astronics Corp., 77 F.3d 1170, 1174 (9th Cir. 1996).  The question is \n26 \nsimply “whether the controversy [is] capable of repetition and not . . . whether the \n27 \nclaimant ha[s] demonstrated that a recurrence of the dispute [is] more probable than not.”  \n28 \n5 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 13 of 33   Page ID #:2034\n \n1  Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318 n.6 (1988).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has found that \n2  the exception to mootness applies when the plaintiff’s expectations of recurrence “were \n3  hardly demonstrably probable.”  Id.  And it is Defendants that bear the “heavy burden of \n4  persua[ding] the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start \n5  up again.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, \n6  189 (2000).1 \n7    Los Angeles reasonably expects to suffer the same competitive disadvantage in \n8  future grant cycles.  Defendants insist that the COPS Office at DOJ has not yet decided \n9  whether to use the same immigration-related factors in the FY 2018 process.  Defs.’ Br. \n10  12.  But the use of such factors in grant decisions has been a loudly proclaimed priority of \n11  the Attorney General as head of DOJ.2  DOJ’s announcement of this past year’s COPS \n12  grants oddly said nothing at all about the community-oriented policing programs being \n13  funded, but instead boasted of its success in persuading applicants to participate in civil \n14  immigration enforcement.  RJN, Ex. H, Nov. Press Release.  Defendants cannot seriously \n15  dispute that there is a reasonable expectation the same Attorney General could act on the \n16  same priorities this year and in future years.  \n17    Defendants also claim that the City can have no reasonable expectation of its injury \n18  recurring because it does not apply for the COPS grant every year.  Defs.’ Br. 13.  Los \n19  Angeles has, however, applied for the grant for the past two years.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 36.  \n20  Moreover, the City intends to apply for the COPS grant in the FY 2018 grant cycle.  \n21 \n                                                 \n22  1 Defendants’ reference to the “likelihood of future injury” standard for seeking \ninjunctive relief, Defs.’ Br. 12, is inapposite.  The “capable of repetition” doctrine is an \n23 \nexception to this standard.  When it applies, as it does here, it permits “suits for \n24  prospective relief to go forward” based only on a “reasonable expectation” of future \ninjury.  Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 481 (1990).  \n25 \n2 See, e.g., Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks on Sanctuary Jurisdictions, \n26 \nDOJ (March 27, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-jeff-\n27  sessions-delivers-remarks-sanctuary-jurisdictions. \n28 \n6 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 14 of 33   Page ID #:2035\n \n1  Decl. of Stella Larracas ¶ 5.  It is thus quite likely that Los Angeles will apply for the \n2  COPS grant again and face a competitive disadvantage in doing so—more than satisfying \n3  the “reasonable expectation” standard that does not even require a probability of future \n4  injury.3 \n5    Finally, there is a strong public interest in application of the “capable of repetition \n6  yet evading review” doctrine here.  See Los Angeles Cty. v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 643 \n7  (1979); Alaska Fish & Wildlife Fed’n & Outdoor Council, Inc. v. Dunkle, 829 F.2d 933, \n8  939 (9th Cir. 1987).  If Los Angeles is correct that DOJ is making grant determinations in \n9  an unconstitutional and unauthorized manner, the public has a profound interest in \n10  ensuring that this overreach of DOJ authority be stopped for future grant cycles.  But \n11  Defendants would require judicial review to be confined to the narrow window of time \n12  between the agency’s grant solicitation and announcement of awards.  Los Angeles \n13  attempted just that; there was no possibility of fully litigating the case during the window, \n14  and the City was persuaded to withdraw its request for a preliminary injunction by what \n15  turned out to be misrepresentations by DOJ.  See infra I.B.2.  The dubious manner in \n16  which Defendants induced the City to abandon its request for emergency relief for the FY \n17  2017 cycle only underscores the importance of resolving the legality of Defendants’ \n18  actions going forward. \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n3 Although it is sufficiently likely that Los Angeles will apply for a COPS grant in FY \n24  2018, Defendants are wrong to focus on whether the City’s future injury will recur in the \ncoming year.  See Wolfson v. Brammer, 616 F.3d 1045, 1054-55 (9th Cir. 2010) (election \n25 \nlaw challenge by former candidate not moot where the candidate intended to run again in \n26  the future, but not “in the next election”).  Even if the City’s historical record of applying \nfor the COPS grant 39% of the time were assumed to be predictive, that would almost \n27 \ncertainly mean that the City will apply for a COPS grant again during the present \n28  Administration. \n7 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 15 of 33   Page ID #:2036\n \n1 \n2.  Defendants Are Not Entitled To Summary Judgment On The \nQuestion Of Whether Los Angeles Would Have Received A FY \n2 \n2017 Award. \n3 \n  For the reasons explained above, the City plainly has a basis to seek prospective \n4 \nrelief; whether or not Los Angeles actually lost funding in the 2017 grant cycle due to use \n5 \nof the illegal immigration factors is irrelevant.  But if that question were relevant, it could \n6 \nnot be resolved against the City on summary judgment. \n7 \n  When the City moved for a preliminary injunction, a DOJ official claimed under \n8 \npenalty of perjury that no applicant that selected “Illegal Immigration” as a focus area \n9 \nscored high enough to receive further consideration.  Decl. of Andrew Dorr ¶ 24 (ECF \n10 \n33-1), Opp. to Pl.’s Mot. for Preliminary Injunction.  Defendants evidently considered \n11 \nthis “fact” relevant to their ultimate point: that Los Angeles allegedly would not receive \n12 \nan award regardless of the use of immigration-related factors, which persuaded the City \n13 \nto withdraw its application.  But Defendants’ representation, which it has now been \n14 \nrevealed was made before the scoring process was complete, turns out to have been false, \n15 \nas Defendants now admit.  Defs.’ Br. 8 n.3; Dorr Decl. ¶ 35 n.5 (ECF 53-1).  The same \n16 \ndeclarant, having retracted part of his earlier statement, still maintains that Los Angeles \n17 \ndid not lose an award on account of the Challenged Considerations.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 27 \n18 \n(ECF 53-1).  Perhaps so, but Defendants cannot reasonably expect the claims of an \n19 \nadmittedly unreliable declarant to carry the day on summary judgment without any \n20 \ndiscovery, especially when the COPS Office’s scoring data show that $8.5 million in FY \n21 \n2017 funding was awarded to jurisdictions that scored lower than Los Angeles but for \n22 \nbonuses resulting from the Challenged Considerations.  Dorr Decl. Ex. C & D (ECF 53-\n23 \n1) (specifically those large population agencies identified as “999,” “Laredo, City of,” \n24 \n“650,” “1029,” “889,” and “929”).  Before judgment could be granted in favor of \n25 \nDefendants, the City would need the opportunity for discovery on, among other things, \n26 \nhow the COPS Office calculated its scores and the factors affecting Los Angeles’ ability \n27 \nto receive a COPS grant.  To be clear, no discovery is necessary for the Court to grant the \n28 \n8 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 16 of 33   Page ID #:2037\n \n1  City’s motion for summary judgment for the reasons explained above, but Defendants are \n2  not entitled to summary judgment in their favor based on what they claim happened \n3  during the 2017 grant process on the current state of the record. \n4 \nII.  Plaintiff Is Entitled To Judgment As A Matter of Law. \n5 \nThis Court should grant Los Angeles’ motion for partial summary judgment, and \n6 \ndeny Defendants’ motion, because the Challenged Considerations are ultra vires, violate \n7 \nthe Spending Clause, and are arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure \n8 \nAct (“APA”). \n9 \nA.  The Challenged Considerations Are Ultra Vires. \n10 \nIn enacting the COPS program, Congress delegated authority to DOJ for a specific \n11 \npurpose: to fund states and localities in the hiring and rehiring of law enforcement \n12 \nofficers for “deployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  \n13 \nDefendants acknowledge this statutory purpose.  Defs.’ Br. 4.  And although they ignore \n14 \nit, they do not contest the basic principle that “[w]hen Congress limits the purpose for \n15 \nwhich a grant can be made, it can be presumed that it intends that the dispersing agency \n16 \nmakes its allocations based on factors solely related to the goal of implementing the \n17 \nstated statutory purposes in a reasonable fashion, rather than taking irrelevant or \n18 \nimpermissible factors into account.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 48 (D.C. Cir. \n19 \n1985) (emphasis added); see Pl.’s Br. 1-12. \n20 \nDOJ refuses to recognize that this inherent limit on Congress’s delegation binds \n21 \nthe agency, instead insisting on its prerogative to make award determinations based on \n22 \nimpermissible factors untethered to the statutory purpose.  First, DOJ is providing \n23 \npreferential treatment to states and localities that certify “partnership” with federal civil \n24 \nimmigration authorities, in the form of particular laws, regulations, or policies the \n25 \njurisdiction has in place (the “Notice and Access requirements”)—despite the fact that \n26 \nsuch partnership is unrelated to the need for, or use of, COPS funds.  Second, DOJ is \n27 \nawarding bonus points to, and authorizing COPS funds to be used by, state and local law \n28 \n9 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 17 of 33   Page ID #:2038\n \n1  enforcement agencies that are willing to use grant money to focus on “Illegal \n2  Immigration,” diverting COPS funds to federal immigration enforcement and away from \n3  their statutorily authorized purpose of state and local community policing. \n4  DOJ thus has structured the COPS grant process to incentivize states and local \n5  communities to change their laws and regulations to fit DOJ policy preferences, and to \n6  “focus” grant funds on matters having nothing to do with the statutory purpose of the \n7  grant program created by Congress.  Strikingly, when confronted with the extraordinary \n8  implications of their position, see Pl.’s Br. 15-16, Defendants do not deny them.  DOJ \n9  admits by its silence that it could use the COPS grant program to pressure states to \n10  abolish (or impose) capital punishment, to crack down on (or legalize) marijuana, to \n11  restrict (or expand) gun rights, and more.  Indeed, if Defendants prevail here, a later \n12  Administration could decide to punish COPS applicants from states that have non-\n13  preempted anti-immigration laws.  Cf. Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Whiting, 563 \n14  U.S. 582 (2011). \n15  Rather than explain how Congress could have meant to delegate so much authority \n16  sub silentio, Defendants attack a straw man.  If DOJ does not have complete discretion to \n17  make grant decisions based on any factor, they assert, the agency would be reduced to \n18  “choos[ing] the winning applicants via random lottery.”  Defs.’ Br. 15.  That is plainly \n19  not what the City is suggesting.  Congress delegated ample discretion for DOJ to make \n20  grant decisions based on its evaluation of the applicants’ need for, and proposed use of, \n21  grant funds, viewed in light of the significant guidance Congress provided on the purpose \n22  of the grant it authorized and what an applicant should include in its application.  It does \n23  not follow that DOJ may hijack the COPS program to promote the Attorney General’s \n24  own unrelated policy agenda.  The agency’s attempt to do so here is ultra vires. \n25   \n26   \n27   \n28 \n10 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 18 of 33   Page ID #:2039\n \n1 \n1.  DOJ Lacks Statutory Authority To Use The COPS Program To \nPressure States And Local Communities To Change Laws, \n2 \nRegulations, And Policies Unrelated To The Program As Created \n3 \nBy Congress. \n4  Defendants do not seriously dispute that the Notice and Access requirements are \n5  unrelated to a state’s or locality’s need for, or use of, COPS funds.  See Pl.’s Br. 12-13.  \n6  This concession establishes that the agency lacks authority to structure the grant program \n7  to disfavor communities that are unwilling or unable to certify to these forms of \n8  “partnership” with federal civil immigration authorities.  See Robbins, 780 F.2d at 48. \n9  The text and structure of the statute confirm that using the grant process to promote \n10  changes to unrelated local laws and policies was not authorized by Congress.  Rather, \n11  Congress authorized DOJ to use COPS funds to encourage states and localities to change \n12  their laws unrelated to the need for, or use of, COPS funds in only one area: laws on \n13  human trafficking victims.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2)-(3).  Specifically, the statute \n14  provides that DOJ “may” give “preferential consideration” to COPS applicants from \n15  states that adopt certain laws granting leniency to victims of human trafficking.  Id.  But \n16  in Defendants’ view, DOJ has inherent authority to give preferential consideration to \n17  state and local governments that adopt any law or regulation the agency wishes to \n18  promote.  If DOJ has this broad power, there would have been no reason for Congress to \n19  authorize one narrow use of such authority.  Defendants do not even attempt to deny that \n20  their reading of the statute would make subsection (c) superfluous.  \n21  Instead, Defendants note that the subsection (c) considerations are “not \n22  mandatory.”  Defs.’ Br. 16.  That does not help Defendants—it proves the City’s point.  \n23  If the statutory baseline were that DOJ is permitted to favor COPS applicants based on \n24  any unrelated laws and regulations, it would not have been superfluous for Congress to \n25  require the agency to favor applicants with respect to one such area, i.e., laws that protect \n26  victims of human trafficking.  But that is not what subsection (c) does, as DOJ \n27  recognizes.  By enacting that provision as “discretionary,” Defs.’ Br. 16, Congress \n28 \n11 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 19 of 33   Page ID #:2040\n \n1  recognized that without it, DOJ lacked the discretion to favor or disfavor applicants based \n2  on their laws and regulations. \n3  Defendants next insist that if subsection (c) means what it says, DOJ would be able \n4  to consider only whether an applicant has the preferred laws against human trafficking in \n5  place, and otherwise would have to draw lots to make grant awards.  See Defs.’ Br. 16 & \n6  n.6.  This is a straw man.  DOJ has ample discretion to weigh an applicant’s need for \n7  COPS funds, and its proposed use of such funds.  See infra II.A.3.  Recognizing that DOJ \n8  cannot generally give preferential treatment based on applicants’ unrelated laws and \n9  policies hardly turns grant determinations into a lottery. \n10  Without any express statutory authority allowing them to use COPS grants to \n11  promote their preferred state and local laws and policies concerning federal civil \n12  immigration enforcement, Defendants invert separation of powers principles.  They insist \n13  that they must have authority to use the federal grant program to induce state and local \n14  policy changes, because “nothing in the governing statutes or case law prohibits DOJ \n15  from” doing so.  Defs.’ Br. 19 (emphasis added).  That is backwards: it is fundamental \n16  that courts will not “presume a delegation of power absent an express withholding of \n17  such power,” or else “agencies would enjoy virtually limitless hegemony.”  Ry. Labor \n18  Execs. Ass’n v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 29 F.3d 655, 671 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (en banc) (as \n19  amended). \n20  Even more brazenly, Defendants distort the Supreme Court’s seminal Spending \n21  Clause decision in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), describing it as follows: \n22  “the Supreme Court has made clear that a federal agency can use grant conditions as a \n23  ‘relatively mild encouragement’ for States and localities to change their laws and \n24  policies.”  Defs.’ Br. 19 (quoting Dole, 483 U.S. at 211) (emphasis added).  What Dole \n25  actually says is that Congress can use federal grants to encourage states to change their \n26  laws and policies.  See Dole, 483 U.S. at 208 (addressing a “condition imposed by \n27  Congress”).  It is revealing that Defendants conflate the authority of Congress and that of \n28  a federal agency. \n12 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 20 of 33   Page ID #:2041\n \n1  Indeed, the difference between what Congress may do and what an agency may do \n2  is critical here, where federalism concerns are paramount.  When federalism is at stake, \n3  Congress—not an agency—must supply a clear statement of its intentions to encroach on \n4  traditional state and local prerogatives.  See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 461 \n5  (1991).  The en banc Fourth Circuit held that the Gregory “clear statement rule” applies \n6  when an agency attempts to use the terms of a grant to pressure states and localities to \n7  change their laws and policies.  See Com. Va., Dep’t of Educ. v. Riley, 106 F.3d 559, 566-\n8  67 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (adopting the dissenting panel opinion of Luttig, J.), \n9  superseded by statute; Pl.’s Br. 14.  Although Defendants assert that Gregory “does not \n10  apply” in such circumstances, Defs.’ Br. 19, they do not mention the en banc court of \n11  appeals decision that disagrees with their view.  Congress itself provided a clear \n12  statement to authorize DOJ to give preference to applicants based on their state and local \n13  laws against human trafficking, see 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2), (3); there is no such clear \n14  statement authorizing DOJ to do the same with respect to civil immigration enforcement. \n15  The broader statutory scheme makes it even clearer that Congress did not intend \n16  for DOJ to use COPS funds to extract unrelated policy concessions from states and \n17  localities related to their state and local law enforcement operations.  Section 10228 \n18  prohibits federal agencies from “exercis[ing] any direction, supervision, or control over \n19  any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any political \n20  subdivision thereof.”  See Pl.’s Br. 14-15 (emphasis added).  Congress enacted section \n21  10228 to prevent exactly what DOJ seeks to do here—exercise “control over . . .  ‘vital \n22  matters pertaining to the day-to-day operations of local law enforcement.’”  Ely v. Velde, \n23  451 F.2d 1130, 1136 (4th Cir. 1971) (quoting S. Rep. No. 90-1097 at 222 (1968)) \n24  (discussing 42 U.S.C. § 3766(a), an earlier version of section 10228(a)).  Congress was \n25  not just worried about literal mandates, but the use of “federal assistance to state and \n26  local law enforcement” as a “vehicle for the imposition of federal guidelines” on such \n27  agencies.  S. Rep. No. 90-1097, 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2276 (1968) (views of \n28  Senators Dirksen, Hruska, Scott, and Thurmond).

Specifically, DOJ uses its control over valuable federal funds to “encourage” \n8  state and local governments to certify that they have specific laws or policies in place \n9  governing who may enter their detention facilities and what their state and local law \n10  enforcement personnel must do.  See Pl.’s Br. 7.  If Defendants mean to suggest that this \n11  is not “direction, supervision, or control” because DOJ is only pressuring, not mandating, \n12  states and localities to make these certifications, that is entirely at odds with the \n13  congressional purpose of preventing federal grants from being a vehicle to change state \n14  and local law enforcement operations.  It also would make section 10228 the second \n15  statutory provision Defendants would make a nullity, doing nothing but reiterating the \n16  Tenth Amendment anti-commandeering rule.5 \n17  “If Congress has not unequivocally conditioned receipt of federal funds in the \n18  manner claimed by the [agency], . . . then [the] inquiry is at an end.”  Riley, 106 F.3d at \n19  566.  Here, not only is there no such clear statement, but every indication on the face of \n20 \n21                                                   \n4 Controlling Crime Through More Effective Law Enforcement: Hearings Before the \n22 \nSubcomm. on Criminal Laws and Procedure of the S.

Defendants neglect to quote the text that immediately follows, which \nmakes clear that the statute is concerned with promoting cooperation to address “white-\n27 \ncollar crime and public corruption.”  34 U.S.C. § 10122(c)(2)(F).  That statute could not \n28  have less relevance here. \n14 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 22 of 33   Page ID #:2043\n \n1  the statute points in the opposite direction.  Congress did not intend to authorize DOJ to \n2  disfavor COPS grant applicants if they were not willing to adopt unrelated laws or \n3  policies.  DOJ’s preferential treatment for COPS applicants that are willing to certify to \n4  their immigration “partnership” is therefore unlawful. \n5 \n2.  DOJ Cannot Divert Funds That Congress Designated For \n6  Community Policing To Federal Civil Immigration Enforcement.  \nDOJ is also awarding “bonus points” to applicants who promise to focus their use \n7 \nof grant funds on “Illegal Immigration” by “propos[ing] ways to contribute to combatting \n8 \nillegal immigration,” Defs.’ Br. 1.  Congress, however, authorized DOJ to provide funds \n9 \nto states and localities under the COPS program for the hiring, or rehiring, of state and \n10 \nlocal law enforcement officers for “deployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 \n11 \nU.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  Nowhere in their brief do Defendants explain how Congress’s \n12 \nobjective of funding the hiring of state and local officers to engage in “community-\n13 \noriented policing” has anything to do with such officers partnering with federal officials \n14 \nto enforce federal civil immigration law.  That is a tacit admission by Defendants that \n15 \nthey are acting ultra vires. \n16 \nDOJ’s attempt to funnel COPS funds to an area that is “unquestionably exclusively \n17 \na federal power,” DeCanas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351, 354 (1976), does not advance \n18 \n“community-oriented policing.”  Community policing, the COPS Office itself explains, \n19 \n“begins with a commitment to building trust and mutual respect between police and \n20 \ncommunities.”  RJN Ex. A, “About.”  The types of activities funded through the “Illegal \n21 \nImmigration” focus area do not involve the local community at all; they require \n22 \npartnership between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.  See RJN \n23 \nEx. F, DOJ FY 2018 COPS Office Congressional Justification at 31 (characterizing the \n24 \n“Illegal Immigration” focus area as “[p]artnering with federal law enforcement”); Defs.’ \n25 \nBr. 18 (observing that, apart from a formal agreement with the federal government, state \n26 \nand local officers can assist in federal immigration enforcement by “providing [federal \n27 \nauthorities] access to aliens they have detained or informing federal authorities of the \n28 \n15 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 23 of 33   Page ID #:2044\n \n1  impending release of such persons”).  Congress was not seeking to “build[] trust” \n2  between local police and federal immigration officials; its intent, as DOJ recognizes \n3  outside the context of this litigation, was to improve relationships between local police \n4  and the communities they serve. \n5  The closest Defendants come to a defense of this scoring factor is to insist that “the \n6  intersection of illegal immigration and crime is a serious public safety issue that can \n7  helpfully be addressed through ‘cooperative efforts’ among federal, state, and local law \n8  enforcement.”  Defs.’ Br. 23.  This premise is unsupported, but it is also irrelevant: the \n9  fact that something is a “public safety issue” does not mean it is a “community-oriented \n10  policing issue.”  All policing has to do with public safety, but Congress did not authorize \n11  COPS funds to hire officers for “deployment in policing” generally. \n12  Defendants also twist the words of the statute to suggest that Congress intended to \n13  promote cooperation between federal and local law enforcement.  Defs.’ Br. 23 (citing \n14  Pub. L. No. 103-322).  The “cooperation” Congress intended to promote is quite clearly \n15  “cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and members of the community.”  \n16  Pub. L. No. 103-322 (emphasis added).  Cooperation among federal, state, and local law \n17  enforcement is not cooperation “between law enforcement agencies and members of the \n18  community.” \n19  In fact, the types of “cooperation” that DOJ encourages would likely damage the \n20  cooperation between local law enforcement and the community that Congress intended to \n21  support.  Through the COPS grant, DOJ has offered to sponsor 287(g) partnerships, in \n22  which state and local law enforcement officers act as federal immigration officers.  See 8 \n23  U.S.C. § 1357(g).  As Los Angeles explained, and Defendants do not dispute, local law \n24  enforcement officers “[c]arrying out civil immigration raids in support of federal \n25  enforcement efforts bears no logical connection” to community policing.  Pl.’s Br. 17.  \n26  DOJ’s preference for applicants that will use grant funds to honor federal detainer \n27  requests for certain immigrants, see Dorr Decl. ¶ 24, is likewise unrelated to community \n28  policing.  In fact, this practice has led to municipality liability due to Fourth Amendment \n16 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 24 of 33   Page ID #:2045\n \n1  violations—hardly the type of police-community relationship that Congress intended.  \n2  See Pl.’s Br. 17 (collecting cases).    \n3  DOJ’s interpretation of its authority disregards not only the COPS statute, but also \n4  federal immigration law.  As Los Angeles previously explained, Pl.’s Br. 18, DOJ’s \n5  funding of local officers to serve as federal immigration officers in 287(g) partnerships \n6  violates Congress’s directive that such partnerships be undertaken “at the expense of the \n7  State or political subdivision.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1).  Defendants’ sole response is that \n8  “any funds awarded under a CHP grant would have to be used to hire or rehire officers \n9  pursuant to the requirements of the Program, not for any state or local expenses of a \n10  287(g) agreement.”  Defs.’ Br. 18 n.8.  But they do not deny that DOJ will be funding the \n11  hiring of state and local officers to engage in immigration enforcement under 287(g) \n12  agreements.  And the Department of Homeland Security has made clear that “expenses” \n13  under such an agreement include the “salaries” of personnel.6  Thus, it is clear that DOJ is \n14  using COPS funds to pay the salaries of state and local officers in 287(g) partnerships, \n15  and in doing so, violating Congress’s prohibition against federal funding of those \n16  partnerships. \n17  By favoring applicants that adopt “Illegal Immigration” as a focus area, DOJ is \n18  acting without statutory authority, diverting COPS funds from their authorized statutory \n19  purpose, and punishing applicants that seek COPS funds for programs that are actually \n20  related to community-oriented policing. \n21 \n3.  The Choice Before The Court Is Not Unfettered Agency Power Or \n22  Grant Awards Chosen By Lottery. \nUnable to explain how Congress authorized the immigration-related factors that \n23 \nDOJ has made the centerpiece of the COPS program, Defendants resort to hyperbole.  In \n24 \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n6 See Memorandum of Understanding, available at https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-\n28  reform/pdf/287g_moa.pdf (emphasis added).   \n17 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 25 of 33   Page ID #:2046\n \n1  their telling, if DOJ lacks the expansive authority they claim, COPS awards would have \n2  to be allocated randomly.  See Defs.’ Br. 15.  That is nonsense. \n3  It is of course permissible for DOJ to consider a community’s crime-fighting needs \n4  in determining which applicants should receive funds to hire officers to engage in \n5  community-oriented policing.  Congress specifically required COPS applicants to \n6  “demonstrate a specific public safety need” related to community policing, 34 U.S.C. \n7  § 10382(c)(2); see also id. § 10382(c)(10) (applicant must “explain how the grant will be \n8  utilized to reorient the affected law enforcement agency’s mission toward community-\n9  oriented policing or enhance its involvement in or commitment to community-oriented \n10  policing”).  This necessarily means Congress expected DOJ to consider those public \n11  safety needs.  And having been delegated authority to evaluate applications in part on the \n12  basis of public safety needs, DOJ can reasonably “prioritiz[e] different areas of public \n13  safety from year to year,” so long as they can be addressed by community policing.  \n14  Defs.’ Br. 16.  Likewise, since Congress provided DOJ the authority to issue grants for \n15  use in community-oriented policing, and required applicants to explain how any grant \n16  funds they receive will do so, see 34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(10), the agency can plainly make \n17  discretionary judgments about which grant proposals best serve that purpose.  These \n18  factors alone leave DOJ with substantial discretion; the fact that this discretion is not \n19  limitless does not mean that the agency must conduct a lottery. \n20  Defendants also note various considerations DOJ has used in the past to award \n21  bonus points, asserting that every one of them would fail under the City’s approach.  \n22  Those considerations are not before the Court and there is no need for the Court to opine \n23  on them; if an applicant is aggrieved by a particular scoring factor and believes it is \n24  unlawful, that applicant is free to bring its own challenge.  But the past considerations \n25  DOJ has identified are consistent with the COPS authorizing statute—unlike its novel \n26  immigration-related considerations. \n27  For example, Defendants suggest that if the City prevails, DOJ could not award \n28  additional consideration to jurisdictions “that have recently experienced a catastrophic \n18 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 26 of 33   Page ID #:2047\n \n1  event.”  Defs.’ Br. 16.  But as Defendants’ own declarant explains, the purpose of this \n2  consideration is to favor applicants that have experienced “tragedies or disasters \n3  impacting law enforcement.”  Dorr Decl. ¶ 18 (emphasis added).  It is consistent with the \n4  statutory text and intent of Congress for DOJ to consider an event that negatively impacts \n5  law enforcement resources for community policing as part of the applicant’s public safety \n6  need and its “inability to address the need without Federal assistance,” 34 U.S.C. \n7  § 10382(c)(3).  Jurisdictions suffering from a catastrophic event can be expected to divert \n8  resources to respond to the tragedy and away from community policing, so ensuring that \n9  COPS funds are available to help make up the difference is eminently reasonable.  Other \n10  considerations Defendants note—for flexibility in shift assignments and an “early \n11  intervention system” for officers showing signs of stress, see Defs.’ Br. 19—have \n12  everything to do with the statutory purpose of hiring officers for community-oriented \n13  policing.  Indeed, the consequences to police-community relations of not timely \n14  identifying officers under stress are all too real.7 \n15  Even if, for the sake of argument, DOJ had pushed the boundaries of its delegated \n16  authority in the past, there is no risk that a ruling for Los Angeles would broadly \n17  undermine the way DOJ has historically administered the COPS program.  DOJ’s \n18  immigration-related considerations, which have no mooring in the statutory purpose of \n19  the grant and are contradicted by the direction Congress provided, are a new and \n20  unlawful invention by the Attorney General. \n21 \n22                                                   \n7 Defendants also observe that DOJ gave additional consideration for the hiring of \n23 \nmilitary veterans before Congress authorized the agency to “prioritiz[e] the hiring and \n24  training of veterans,” 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(2).  Defs.’ Br. 7.  This consideration had to \ndo with the hiring of officers, which is at the core of the statutory grant authorization.  \n25 \nMoreover, if any inference is to be drawn from Congress’s codification of this factor, it is \n26  that Congress was concerned that DOJ did not have sufficient authorization for it without \na more specific enactment.  Cf. Schism v. United States, 316 F.3d 1259, 1289 (Fed. Cir. \n27 \n2002) (noting that Congress may act to ratify action that was “unauthorized when taken” \n28  (emphasis added)). \n19 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 27 of 33   Page ID #:2048\n \n1 \nB.  The Challenged Considerations Violate The Spending Clause Because \nDefendants Cannot Identify Any Reasonable Relationship They Bear To \n2 \nThe Community Policing Purpose Of The COPS Program. \n3 \n  A state’s or locality’s willingness to certify compliance with the Notice and Access \n4 \nrequirements, or to use COPS funds to participate in civil immigration enforcement, \n5 \nmade a significant difference in the applicant’s ability to compete for federal funds.  See \n6 \nDorr Decl. ¶ 35.  In fact, in some cases, these were the dispositive factors in whether a \n7 \njurisdiction received a grant.  Id.; see also id. (stating that 19 out of 30 successful large \n8 \njurisdictions and 124 out of 149 successful small jurisdictions complied with the Notice \n9 \nand Access requirements).  When DOJ announced the 2017 awards, it even boasted about \n10 \nhow effective these inducements were.  RJN Ex. H, Nov. Press Release.  The Challenged \n11 \nConsiderations thus operate as terms or conditions on the receipt of COPS funds, and so \n12 \nmust comply with constitutional restrictions on funding conditions. \n13 \n  The Supreme Court has clearly established that congressional conditions on the \n14 \nreceipt of federal funds “must . . . bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal \n15 \nspending.”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167 (1992).  As discussed above, \n16 \nCongress did not delegate DOJ authority to impose conditions related to immigration \n17 \nenforcement on COPS grants.  But even if DOJ had authority to use the Challenged \n18 \nConsiderations, they violate the Spending Clause’s requirement that conditions be \n19 \n“reasonably related” to the purposes of the grant program, Nevada v. Skinner, 884 F.2d \n20 \n445, 447 (9th Cir. 1989), because enforcement of federal civil immigration laws is \n21 \nunrelated to the COPS grant’s purpose of promoting community-oriented policing.  \n22 \nDefendants offer no serious argument to the contrary.   \n23 \n  Community-oriented policing, in DOJ’s own words, entails “developing \n24 \npartnerships between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.”  RJN \n25 \nEx. F, DOJ FY 2018 COPS Office Congressional Justification at 4 (emphasis added); see \n26 \nalso RJN Ex. A, “About,” (“Community policing begins with a commitment to building \n27 \ntrust and mutual respect between police and communities.”).  It is not, as DOJ contends \n28 \n20 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 28 of 33   Page ID #:2049\n \n1  for the first time here, about developing partnerships between state and local law \n2  enforcement and the federal government.  Defs.’ Br. 23.  DOJ attempts to argue that \n3  enforcement of federal civil immigration law is reasonably related to state and local law \n4  enforcement by asserting that enforcement of federal immigration law “makes \n5  communities safer.”  Id.  This argument is itself unsupportable, see Philadelphia v. \n6  Sessions, 2017 WL 5489476 at *48 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 15, 2017) (“Immigration law has \n7  nothing to do with the enforcement of local criminal laws.”), appeal filed (3d Cir. Jan. 18, \n8  2018), but more importantly, DOJ makes no argument as to how mandating state and \n9  local enforcement of federal immigration law is related to community policing.  DOJ’s \n10  only way to show that its considerations relate to the statutory purpose is to read the \n11  words “community-oriented” out of the statute, and treat the purpose of the grant as \n12  anything related to “policing.”  See supra II.A.2.  But federal agencies are bound by the \n13  statutes that Congress enacts.  Because the Challenged Considerations have no \n14  relationship to “community-oriented policing,” they cannot pass muster under the \n15  Spending Clause.   \n16    The unrelated provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act which DOJ cites \n17  as evidence of congressional intent to involve states and localities in enforcement of \n18  federal civil immigration laws, Defs.’ Br. 23, provide no better support for their \n19  contention that federal civil immigration enforcement is related to community policing.  \n20  Rather, they show that when Congress intended to include state and local governments in \n21  federal immigration enforcement, it authorized such participation explicitly—belying the \n22  contention that immigration enforcement should be generally considered related to state \n23  and local policing.  Because the Challenged Considerations are unrelated to—and if \n24  anything may actively undermine—the goals of community policing, they violate the \n25  relatedness prong of the Spending Clause.    \n26  C.  The Challenged Considerations Are Arbitrary And Capricious. \n27    DOJ’s adoption of the Challenged Considerations was arbitrary and capricious in \n28  violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), because the agency failed to \n21 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 29 of 33   Page ID #:2050\n \n1  contemporaneously articulate a “reasonable basis . . . for the decision.”  Alaska Oil & \n2  Gas Ass’n v. Jewell, 815 F.3d 544, 554 (9th Cir. 2016).  \n3    Even if it were possible for conditions requiring state and local enforcement of \n4  federal civil immigration laws to be related to community policing, DOJ at no point \n5  explains how the Challenged Considerations are related to the goals of the COPS statute \n6  as enacted by Congress.  It thus entirely failed to “articulate[] a rational connection \n7  between the facts found and the choice made.”  Az. Cattle Growers’ Ass’n v. U.S. Fish & \n8  Wildlife, Bureau of Land Mgmt., 273 F.3d 1229, 1236 (9th Cir. 2001).  In its brief, \n9  Defendants do not point to any instance on the record in which DOJ or Attorney General \n10  Sessions explained the connection between the immigration factors and community \n11  policing, instead stating that, “[n]othing in the statutes governing CHP suggests DOJ \n12  should not consider the extent to which a jurisdiction cooperates in the enforcement of \n13  immigration law . . . .”  Defs.’ Br. 24-25 (emphasis added).  As the City argues above, the \n14  immigration conditions are in fact inconsistent with the COPS statute.  But even if they \n15  were not, the APA demands more than that agency action not be clearly inconsistent with \n16  the text of a statute; it requires that the agency contemporaneously explain the basis for \n17  its decisions.  See Pacific Coast Fed’n of Fishermen’s Ass’ns v. U.S. Bureau of \n18  Reclamation, 426 F.3d 1082, 1091 (9th Cir. 2005) (“It is a basic principle of \n19  administrative law that the agency must articulate the reason or reasons for its \n20  decision.”).  DOJ failed to do so, and Defendants’ brief does not argue otherwise. \n21    DOJ also misunderstands the City’s reliance on studies showing either no \n22  relationship, or an inverse relationship between so-called “sanctuary” policies and violent \n23  crime.  See Pl.’s Br. 22.  The point is not that the City has identified studies supporting a \n24  “difference in view” from DOJ.  Defs.’ Br. 25.  It is that the Attorney General identified \n25  these studies as supporting his actions, but misread them—according to their authors.  \n26  See Pl.’s Br. 22. (citing ECF 49-3, Ex. C).  When an agency acts on the basis of evidence \n27  that means the opposite of what it says, that is arbitrary and capricious.  Cf. Defenders of \n28  Wildlife v. Jewell, 176 F. Supp. 3d 975, 1004 (D. Mont. 2016) (holding that an agency \n22 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 30 of 33   Page ID #:2051\n \n1  decision relying on “an implausible misinterpretation [of a study] that runs counter to \n2  [its] intent” was “arbitrary and capricious”).  Los Angeles is not challenging a policy \n3  disagreement, but an agency decision that is not supported by the very evidence it cites, \n4  and so lacks a rational basis. \n5 \nIII.  An Injunction Barring Defendants From Using The Invalid Considerations Is \n6  Appropriate. \nThis Court may issue what Defendants term a “nationwide” injunction, meaning an \n7 \ninjunction that prevents Defendants from continuing to act unlawfully with respect to \n8 \neveryone but the Plaintiff here.  See, e.g., Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 \n9 \n(1979) (“nationwide” injunction appropriate where “necessary to provide complete relief \n10 \nto the plaintiffs”).  Indeed, both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits recently affirmed a broad \n11 \ninjunction against an Executive Branch action in all its applications, including as to \n12 \naffected individuals not party to the case.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1166-67 \n13 \n(9th Cir. 2017); see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by an \n14 \nequally divided court, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (affirming a broad injunction against a \n15 \nfederal immigration policy in all its applications and not limited to the plaintiffs before \n16 \nthe court).  An injunction that prevents DOJ from applying its unlawful policy is \n17 \nparticularly necessary here because DOJ’s preferential treatment of COPS applicants who \n18 \nadopt DOJ’s preferred immigration policies over those, like Los Angeles, who do not, is \n19 \ninvalid on its face.  See, e.g., Decker v. O’Donnell, 661 F.2d 598, 617-18 (7th Cir. 1980) \n20 \n(affirming nationwide injunction in case of facial challenge to legality of agency \n21 \nregulation); Santa Clara v. Trump, 2017 WL 5569835, at *17 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017), \n22 \nappeal filed (9th Cir. Dec. 14, 2017).  \n23 \nDefendants suggest in one sentence in a footnote that “any injunction should be \n24 \nlimited to the plaintiff rather than applying to all CHP applicants.”  Defs.’ Br. 11 n.4.  \n25 \nApart from the absence of any actual argument supporting their position, Defendants fail \n26 \nto explain how an injunction could be tailored only to Los Angeles when the issue is \n27 \nDOJ’s preferential treatment of other applicants.  See Washington, 847 F.3d at 1167 \n28 \n23 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 31 of 33   Page ID #:2052\n \n1  (nationwide relief appropriate where government had not proposed a workable alternative \n2  form that would remedy the violation).  The City is not injured because it loses points \n3  itself, but because its competitors are unlawfully given extra points.  Los Angeles’ \n4  request for an even playing field for COPS applicants necessarily requires across-the-\n5  board relief.  Cf. Easyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. v. Hannigan, 92 F.3d 1486, 1501-02 \n6  (9th Cir. 1996) (“[A]n injunction is not necessarily made overbroad by extending benefit \n7  or protection to persons other than prevailing parties in the lawsuit—even if it is not a \n8  class action—if such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which \n9  they are entitled.” (citation and emphasis omitted)); Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, \n10  1171 (9th Cir. 1987) (affirming nationwide relief where “the district court could hardly \n11  require enforcement of the [statute] on anything other than a nationwide basis”).  \n12  Accordingly, this Court should issue an injunction prohibiting DOJ from using the \n13  Challenged Considerations in making COPS grant determinations in future grant cycles. \n14  CONCLUSION \n15  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant partial summary judgment to the \n16  City of Los Angeles as to each of its claims concerning the COPS grant program (Counts \n17  Four, Five, and Six), deny Defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment, and enter \n18  final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) on those claims.  The Court should declare that the \n19  Challenged Considerations are (1) ultra vires and a violation of the Separation of Powers, \n20  (2) in violation of the Spending Clause, and (3) an arbitrary and capricious agency action \n21  in violation of the APA.  The Court should further enjoin Defendants from using the \n22  Challenged Considerations in making COPS grant determinations in future grant cycles. \n23   \n24   \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n24 \nCITY OF LOS ANGELES’ REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ \n  MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 32 of 33   Page ID #:2053\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 57   Filed 01/29/18   Page 33 of 33   Page ID #:2054\n \n1  CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n2  I hereby certify that on this 29th day of January, 2018, the within document and its \n3  attachments were electronically filed with the Clerk of the Court using the CM/ECF \n4  system and will be sent electronically to the registered participants as identified on the \n5  Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF), pursuant to Local Rule 5-3.2. \n6   \n7  /s/   Mitchell A.

In this Complaint, the City of Los Angeles seeks declaratory and injunctive \n3  relief to prevent an arm of the Executive Branch of the United States Government from \n4  unconstitutionally seeking to wield authority it does not have to advance policy \n5  objectives it cannot lawfully effectuate—all at the potential expense of public safety and \n6  community trust in Los Angeles and other communities.  \n7  2.   Ironically, the offending edicts issue from the United States Department of \n8  Justice (“DOJ” or “Department”), which seeks unconstitutionally to impose terms on two \n9  grants enacted by Congress: one a formula-based program to assist state and local \n10  criminal justice programs, the other a program to fund state and local community policing \n11  efforts, including by putting more officers on the streets.  As a consequence, DOJ puts the \n12  City of Los Angeles—and other state and local government entities—to an untenable \n13  choice: commit to participating in federal civil immigration investigation and \n14  enforcement efforts, or sacrifice funds for public safety and community policing.   \n15  3.  The funds at issue are part of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \n16  Grant (“Byrne JAG”) Program and the Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS”) \n17  Program.   \n18  The Byrne JAG Program \n19  4.  Congress established the Byrne JAG Program specifically to fund \n20  “additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical \n21  assistance, and information systems for criminal justice.”  34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1).  \n22  Byrne JAG grants are awarded through a statutory formula based on population and \n23  crime rates.  They are administered by a component of DOJ, the Office of Justice \n24  Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance. \n25  5.  Nothing in the Byrne JAG legislation that Congress enacted permits DOJ to \n26  require, as a condition for receiving those federal funds, that recipients change policies \n27  and the operation of their programs and facilities to afford federal civil immigration \n28  officials access to local jails for federal civil immigration purposes.  Likewise, Congress, \n1 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 4 of 43   Page ID #:4\n \n1  in the Byrne JAG legislation, did not give DOJ authority to cause recipients to provide \n2  advance notice to federal immigration officials before an arrestee is released from \n3  custody.  To the contrary, DOJ’s terms subvert Congress’s intent in fashioning the \n4  program.   \n5  The COPS Program \n6  6.  The COPS Program was designed to fund a range of community policing \n7  efforts, from hiring and rehiring new law enforcement officers to funding school-based \n8  partnerships between local law enforcement and schools.  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1)-(22).   \n9  DOJ’s Office for Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS Office”) administers \n10  this Program.  Congress authorized the Attorney General to give preferential \n11  consideration to applicants with laws concerning the treatment of human trafficking \n12  victims and who agreed to contribute more than the required minimum matching \n13  contribution for certain grants.  Id. § 10381(c).  This preferential consideration takes the \n14  form of “bonus points” awarded to applicants applying for COPS grants.  The Program at \n15  issue here awards grants for the hiring or rehiring of law enforcement officers.  See 2017 \n16  COPS Hiring Program (“CHP”) Application Guide.1   \n17  7.  As with the Byrne JAG Program, DOJ seeks to insert new terms (this time it \n18  calls them “additional considerations”) into the COPS grant program, designed to affect \n19  the distribution of COPS awards.  The result of these additional considerations would be \n20  to favor those applicants that agree to engage in federal civil immigration investigations \n21  and enforcement and to disfavor those applicants that focus on the community policing \n22  purposes of the COPS statute, but do not agree to act as agents of DOJ in enforcing \n23  federal civil immigration law.  As with the Byrne JAG conditions, DOJ’s actions with \n24  respect to the COPS program are unauthorized and incompatible with the statute.  \n25  Constitutionality \n26  8.  Whether called “conditions” or “considerations,” the new immigration-\n27 \n                                                 \n28  1 Available at https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2017AwardDocs/chp/app_guide.pdf. \n2 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 5 of 43   Page ID #:5\n \n1  related terms DOJ has attached to both the Byrne JAG and COPS Programs are facially \n2  unconstitutional.  First, they violate the constitutional doctrine of Separation of Powers.  \n3  The constitutional authority to spend government money, and (with constitutional \n4  limitations) to attach terms and conditions to the receipt of federal funds, belongs to \n5  Congress, not the Executive Branch.  An agency of the Executive Branch may not \n6  unilaterally impose terms and conditions on federal grants in the absence of a specific and \n7  unambiguous delegation from Congress, which has not occurred with respect to either of \n8  the Byrne JAG or COPS Programs.  On this basis alone, the new Byrne JAG conditions \n9  and COPS considerations violate the Constitution.   \n10  9.  In addition, DOJ’s actions offend the basic Separation of Powers principle \n11  that an Executive Branch agency has no power to act unless Congress has conferred on it \n12  authority to do so.  DOJ’s new terms are not authorized by, and indeed are incompatible \n13  with, the statutes Congress enacted to establish the Byrne JAG Program and the COPS \n14  Program.  The Byrne JAG conditions cannot be reconciled with Congress’s directive that \n15  funds be allocated through an explicit funding formula.  DOJ’s conditions also would \n16  flout Congress’s express directive that Byrne JAG funds be used only for one or more of \n17  eight specified criminal justice programs, by redirecting those funds to efforts by state \n18  and local law enforcement that participate in federal civil immigration investigations.  \n19  Indeed, one court has already found it likely that DOJ’s efforts to impose the conditions \n20  on the Byrne JAG grants “violate the separation of powers doctrine and are ultra vires.”  \n21  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 2017 WL 4081821 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 15, 2017), appeal filed. \n22  10.  Similarly, the new COPS considerations are not among the three preferential \n23  considerations that Congress authorized the Attorney General to take into account in \n24  awarding COPS grants, nor are they related to any of the twenty-two purposes for which \n25  COPS grants may be awarded.  \n26  11.  The new terms would also contravene Congress’s statutory mandate that the \n27  Byrne JAG and COPS Programs not empower any federal agency or officer to exercise \n28  any direction or control over a local police force.   \n3 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 6 of 43   Page ID #:6\n \n1  12.  Second, even if the new terms had been imposed by Congress, they would \n2  be unconstitutional under the Spending Clause and Tenth Amendment to the United \n3  States Constitution, which limit the power of the federal government to affect funding to \n4  the States (and their municipalities) regarding matters of law and policy that are properly \n5  reserved to the States.   \n6  13.  When Congress attaches new terms to federal funds, it must meet several \n7  requirements to ensure that it is not abusing the spending power to improperly regulate \n8  and commandeer state and local officials.  Terms that Congress places on federal funding \n9  must be unambiguous, so state and local governments know to what they are agreeing.  \n10  Here, however, DOJ’s terms, by whatever name DOJ calls them, exceed federal Spending \n11  Clause authority because Los Angeles cannot know what is expected of it, as set forth in \n12  detail below.   \n13  14.  The constitutional defects in DOJ’s conditions and considerations run even \n14  deeper.  Another important limit on the Spending Clause is that terms Congress imposes \n15  on the use by a State or local government of federal funds must be sufficiently related to \n16  the purpose of those funds.  Congress’s express purpose for creation of the Byrne JAG \n17  Program was to fund local criminal justice programs, specifically one or more of the \n18  eight types of programs listed in the statute.  For the COPS Program, Congress specified \n19  twenty-two purposes related to community policing.  DOJ’s new conditions and \n20  considerations do not relate to those purposes, but rather attempt to use the Byrne JAG \n21  and COPS Programs to induce communities to engage in federal civil immigration \n22  investigations and enforcement.   \n23  15.  Additionally, in promulgating these conditions and considerations, DOJ did \n24  not rely on any analysis or findings to support the implicit premise that individuals whom \n25  DHS believes may be unlawfully present in the United States commit more crime than do \n26  individuals legally resident in the United States.  In fact, there is substantial evidence to \n27  the contrary.  For this reason, DOJ’s attempt to attach the new terms to these grant \n28  programs is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. \n4 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 7 of 43   Page ID #:7\n \n1  16.  In short, DOJ’s unilateral and unauthorized attempt to hold hostage federal \n2  funding that Congress authorized to assist state and local criminal justice programs and \n3  local community policing efforts, to cause state and local agencies to assist with federal \n4  civil immigration investigations, is unconstitutional and unlawful, and cannot be allowed \n5  to stand. \n6  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7  17.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question).  The \n8  Court also has authority to award declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n9  §§ 2201–2202. \n10  18.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Plaintiff \n11  resides in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this \n12  action occurred in this District. \n13  PARTIES \n14  19.  Plaintiff City of Los Angeles (“City” or “Los Angeles”) is a municipal \n15  corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, and is a \n16  charter city pursuant to Article XI of the California Constitution. \n17  20.  Defendant Jefferson B. Sessions, III, is the Attorney General of the United \n18  States.  The Attorney General is charged with the administration and enforcement of \n19  federal criminal law and policy, and oversees the U.S. Department of Justice, which \n20  administers the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”) \n21  Program and the Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS”) Program.  Defendant \n22  Sessions has supervisory responsibility and is sued in his official capacity.   \n23  21.  Defendant U.S. Department of Justice is an agency of the United States.  \n24  The Bureau of Justice Assistance (“BJA”) is a component of the Office of Justice \n25  Programs of DOJ (“OJP”).  BJA’s stated mission is “to provide leadership and services in \n26  grant administration and criminal justice policy development to support local, state, and \n27  tribal justice strategies to achieve safer communities.”  BJA administers the Byrne JAG \n28  Program.  The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services is also a component \n5 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 8 of 43   Page ID #:8\n \n1  within DOJ.  The COPS Office is “responsible for advancing the practice of community \n2  policing by the nation’s state, local, territorial, and tribal law enforcement agencies \n3  through information and grant resources.”  The COPS Office administers the COPS \n4  grants. \n5  22.  Defendant Alan Hanson is the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the \n6  Office of Justice Programs at DOJ and oversees BJA.  Defendant Hanson has supervisory \n7  responsibility and is sued in his official capacity.   \n8  23.  Defendant Russell Washington is the Acting Director for the COPS Office at \n9  DOJ.  He oversees the COPS Office, which administers the COPS grants.  Defendant \n10  Washington has supervisory responsibility and is sued in his official capacity. \n11  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n12  A.  Policies and Practices of the City of Los Angeles’ Police Department \n13  24.  For nearly four decades, the Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”) has \n14  implemented policies and practices designed to promote the public safety of all Los \n15  Angeles residents by engendering cooperation and trust between members of the City’s \n16  many immigrant communities and law enforcement.  The fundamental goal of these local \n17  policies and practices has been to encourage victims of and witnesses to crime to \n18  cooperate with LAPD, irrespective of their immigration status.  Central to these policies \n19  has been the determination by local law enforcement and its civilian overseers to leave \n20  federal civil immigration investigations and enforcement to the federal government.   \n21  25.   For example, in 1979, LAPD began a policy—adopted by the Los Angeles \n22  Board of Police Commissioners and signed by then-Chief of Police Daryl Gates—that \n23  restricts an officer from initiating a police action with the objective of discovering a \n24  person’s immigration status, and also prohibits arrests based solely on civil immigration \n25  status.   \n26  26.  This policy, known as Special Order 40, resulted in the addition of Section \n27  1/390 (Undocumented Aliens) to the LAPD Manual, and an amendment to Section \n28  4/264.50 of the Manual (Enforcement of United States Immigration Laws).  Section \n6 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 9 of 43   Page ID #:9\n \n1  1/390 provides that “[u]ndocumented alien status in itself is not a matter for police \n2  action,” and proclaims that LAPD personnel are required to enforce the law and serve \n3  members of the public equally without regard to immigration status.  Section 1/390 also \n4  recognizes that its policy encourages participation by undocumented persons in police \n5  activities and investigations, which increases LAPD’s ability to protect and serve the \n6  entire community. \n7  27.  Manual Section 4/264.50 provides that “[o]fficers shall not initiate police \n8  action where the objective is to discover the alien status of a person.”  This section also \n9  specifies that “[o]fficers shall neither arrest nor book persons for violation of Title 8, \n10  Section 1325 of the United States Immigration Code (Illegal Entry).” \n11  28.  The LAPD policies promulgated by Special Order 40 are compliant with \n12  existing federal law.  In the 2009 case, Sturgeon v. Bratton, the California Court of \n13  Appeal rejected a legal challenge to Special Order 40—as set forth in Section 4/264.50 of \n14  the LAPD Manual—ruling that the language of the policy does not conflict with 8 U.S.C. \n15  § 1373 (“Section 1373”), and is not invalid.  As the Court of Appeal recognized, Section \n16  1373 addresses certain communications between federal and state or local authorities; \n17  Special Order 40 does not address that issue, but rather prohibits police officers from \n18  initiating police action to determine immigration status and making arrests for illegal \n19  entry.  174 Cal. App. 4th 1407 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009).  It has nothing to do with \n20  communications between LAPD and federal authorities.  \n21  29.  In 2014, LAPD adopted a practice of refusing to detain individuals, \n22  otherwise eligible for release from custody under state law, on the basis of requests from \n23  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”).  LAPD does not detain individuals \n24  in response to such requests unless they are supported by a judicial determination of \n25  probable cause, or a valid warrant from a judicial officer.  This practice was developed in \n26  response to judicial decisions declaring compliance with such ICE requests to be \n27  unconstitutional, and also potentially subjecting LAPD to significant liability for \n28  violations of the Fourth Amendment.  See, e.g., Miranda-Olivares v. Clackamas County, \n7 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 10 of 43   Page ID #:10\n \n1  2014 WL 1414305, at *11 (D. Or. Apr. 11, 2014).  \n2  30.  When a member of LAPD arrests an individual in connection with a \n3  criminal offense, the arrestee may be cited and released in the field, or taken to one of \n4  LAPD’s ten jail detention facilities for booking.  Those LAPD jail facilities are all \n5  categorized by the State of California as Type I facilities, which are local detention \n6  facilities used for the temporary, short-term detention of persons who may be held for no \n7  more than 96 hours.  In practice, persons arrested by members of LAPD generally are \n8  kept in LAPD custody for no more than 48 hours after arrest because of the limitations \n9  imposed by state law and the Constitution with respect to the period of time within which \n10  law enforcement agencies must: 1) obtain a probable cause determination that an arrested \n11  individual committed a criminal offense to support the detention of the individual without \n12  a warrant; and 2) transfer a detainee to court for arraignment.  See Cal. Pen. Code § 825; \n13  Cty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991).   \n14  31.  In many situations, arrestees are eligible for release from custody within a \n15  few hours of arrest and booking, including by posting bail or bond, on their own \n16  recognizance, or by a certificate of release.  \n17  32.  While arrestees are in LAPD custody, LAPD permits DHS and ICE \n18  personnel access to LAPD detention facilities to interview individual arrestees regarding \n19  civil immigration status.  LAPD does so consistent with the state statutory requirement \n20  that such persons be provided with advance written notice explaining the purpose of the \n21  interview, that the interview is voluntary, and that the person may decline to speak or opt \n22  to be interviewed only in the presence of his or her attorney.  See California TRUTH Act, \n23  Cal. Gov. Code § 7283 et seq. (“California TRUTH Act”).  LAPD implements this state \n \n24  law by obtaining a written expression of the arrestee’s willingness prior to any such \n25  interview.  If the arrestee declines the interview, LAPD does not provide DHS and ICE \n26  personnel access to its facilities in order to interview that individual.   \n27  B.  The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program \n28  33.  Congress established the Byrne JAG Program to fund “additional personnel, \n8 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 11 of 43   Page ID #:11\n \n1  equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical assistance, and information \n2  systems for criminal justice.”  34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1).  Congress specified that these \n3  funds be used “for any one or more of the following programs”: \n4  •  “Law enforcement programs.” \n5  •  “Prosecution and court programs.” \n6  •  “Prevention and education programs.” \n7  •  “Corrections and community corrections programs.” \n8  •  “Drug treatment and enforcement programs.” \n9  •  “Planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs.” \n10  •  “Crime victim and witness programs (other than compensation).” \n11  •  “Mental health programs and related law enforcement and corrections \n12  programs, including behavioral programs and crisis intervention teams.” \n13  34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H). \n14  34.  Byrne JAG funding is administered by BJA within the U.S. Department of \n15  Justice’s Office of Justice Programs.  See 34 U.S.C. §§ 10151-58.  Each fiscal year, BJA \n16  selects state and local government awardees to receive funds that, in general, may be used \n17  over a period of four years.   \n18  35.  In awarding funds, BJA employs a congressional formula to allocate funds \n19  to eligible States and local governments.  By statute, funding is allocated based on two \n20  factors: population and rate of violent crime.  The Attorney General must allocate 50 \n21  percent of the available funds to each State in amounts proportionate to its population and \n22  its crime statistics.  Id. § 10156(a).  The remaining 50 percent of the funds is allocated to \n23  each State in amounts proportionate to its rate of violent crime.  Id.  Of the total amount \n24  allocated to a State, 60 percent is provided as a direct grant to the State, and 40 percent as \n25  grants for local governments.  Id. § 10156(b)(2), (d).  \n26  36.  Local governments wishing to receive a grant must submit an award \n27  application to BJA.  In order to be eligible for an award, an applicant must furnish certain \n28  certifications and assurances related to the application or administration of the grant, or \n9 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 12 of 43   Page ID #:12\n \n1  use of the grant funds.  Specifically, Congress enumerated two certifications and three \n2  assurances that an applicant must make: \n3  •  “A certification that Federal funds made available under this part will not be \n4  used to supplant State or local funds, but will be used to increase the \n5  amounts of such funds that would, in the absence of Federal funds, be made \n6  available for law enforcement activities.”  34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(1). \n7  •  “An assurance that, not fewer than 30 days before the application (or any \n8  amendment to the application) was submitted to the Attorney General, the \n9  application (or amendment) was submitted for review to the governing body \n10  of the State or unit of local government (or to an organization designated by \n11  that governing body).”  Id. § 10153(a)(2). \n12  •  “An assurance that, before the application (or any amendment to the \n13  application) was submitted to the Attorney General (A) the application (or \n14  amendment) was made public; and (B) an opportunity to comment on the \n15  application (or amendment) was provided to citizens and to neighborhood or \n16  community-based organizations, to the extent applicable law or established \n17  procedure makes such an opportunity available.”  Id. § 10153(a)(3). \n18  •  “An assurance that, for each fiscal year covered by an application, the \n19  applicant shall maintain and report such data, records, and information \n20  (programmatic and financial) as the Attorney General may reasonably \n21  require.”  Id. § 10153(a)(4). \n22  •  “A certification . . . that (A) the programs to be funded by the grant meet all \n23  the requirements of this part; (B) all the information contained in the \n24  application is correct; (C) there has been appropriate coordination with \n25  affected agencies; and (D) the applicant will comply with all provisions of \n26  this part and all other applicable Federal laws.”  Id. § 10153(a)(5).  \n27  37.  Byrne JAG applications are accepted through an online program.  In order to \n28  complete the application, a representative of the applicant is required to electronically \n10 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 13 of 43   Page ID #:13\n \n1  sign a page stating that the applicant will comply with standard “assurances” promulgated \n2  by the Office of Management and Budget.  These assurances include that, “throughout \n3  the period of performance for the award,” “the Applicant will comply with all award \n4  requirements.”  \n5  38.  When BJA grants an application for a Byrne JAG award, BJA requires the \n6  recipient to agree to an additional set of “Special Conditions.”  These conditions \n7  generally relate to the administration of the grant or the use of grant funds.  The “Special \n8  Conditions” imposed in Los Angeles’ fiscal year (“FY”) 2016 grant award governed \n9  various aspects of how the City would be required to administer its Byrne JAG award, \n10  such as a “[r]equirement for data on performance and effectiveness under the award,” \n11  “[r]equirements related to System for Award Management and Unique Entity \n12  Identifiers,” compliance with civil rights and nondiscrimination regulations in the \n13  administration of the award, and reporting of any fraud, waste, and abuse in the award \n14  implementation.   \n15 \nC.  The City of Los Angeles Uses Byrne JAG Funds For Critical Local Law \n16  Enforcement Needs \n39.  Each year since 1997, the City of Los Angeles has received more than $1 \n17 \nmillion in funding under the Byrne JAG Program (and its predecessor).  Every year that \n18 \nLos Angeles has applied for Byrne JAG funds, it has been approved for funding.   \n19 \n40.   In the FY 2016 application cycle, Los Angeles applied for and received \n20 \napproximately $1.8 million in Byrne JAG funding for FY 2016 through FY 2019.  \n21 \nApproximately $800,000 of the funding went to the County of Los Angeles as a sub-\n22 \ngrantee, and $1 million remained with the City.  For FY 2016, Los Angeles received its \n23 \nfunding directly from the federal government as part of a formula grant, see 34 U.S.C. \n24 \n§ 10156(d), not as a distribution from the Byrne JAG funds awarded separately to the \n25 \nState of California.   \n26 \n41.  Byrne JAG funds support important criminal justice programs in Los \n27 \nAngeles.  Specifically, the City’s FY 2016 Byrne JAG funds assist in funding its \n28 \n11 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 14 of 43   Page ID #:14\n \n1  Community Law Enforcement and Recovery (“CLEAR”) program, which aims to reduce \n2  gang violence in Los Angeles and rehabilitate communities that have experienced \n3  significant criminal activity.  Through effective collaboration among several city, county, \n4  and state criminal justice agencies, the program targets high crime areas and promotes \n5  community recovery by working closely with special criminal investigative units, an \n6  aggressive vertical prosecutorial program, probation and parole officers, youth \n7  intervention organizations, and schools.   \n8  42.  The CLEAR program has been successful.  In 2014, the CLEAR program \n9  areas had 22 percent less gang crime over a three-year period than similar non-CLEAR \n10  areas.  For FY 2016, the Byrne JAG funds supported 20 to 30 percent of the salaries for \n11  nine Deputy City Attorneys, nine Deputy District Attorneys, and nine Deputy Probation \n12  officers related to the CLEAR program.   \n13  43.  The City’s use of Byrne JAG funds to support the CLEAR program and \n14  reduce violent crime advances the core criminal justice mission of the Byrne JAG \n15  Program.  The CLEAR program’s key to success in reducing violent crime in targeted \n16  neighborhoods has been the dedication of various agency assets to the goal of reducing \n17  crime in CLEAR sites.  Each CLEAR site includes an operational team made up of \n18  representatives from LAPD, the County District Attorney’s Office, the City Attorney’s \n19  Office, and the County Probation Department.  In addition to their focus on reducing \n20  crime, the CLEAR team members collaborate with residents within each CLEAR site \n21  through the creation of a Community Impact Team.  The Community Impact Team’s \n22  focus is specifically on quality of life issues such as graffiti, litter, and juvenile loitering.  \n23  Community members on the team identify effective community organizations in their \n24  CLEAR area and facilitate a relationship between those organizations and CLEAR team \n25  members to secure support from individuals and businesses within the community.     \n26  44.  The year-over-year federal funding for the CLEAR program has been a \n27  catalyst for turning Los Angeles into a leader on coordinated approaches to seemingly \n28  intractable issues related to violent crime in general, and gang-related violence in \n12 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 15 of 43   Page ID #:15\n \n1  particular.  The CLEAR model was innovative and went beyond the traditional methods \n2  of criminal suppression.  It combined, in one program, elements which have been copied \n3  by numerous other jurisdictions, and are now a common approach to addressing not only \n4  gang violence but violent crimes generally.  These elements, such as vertical prosecution \n5  of all cases, regular sharing of best practices from public safety teams in various parts of \n6  the City, and community outreach, have significantly informed the creation of other \n7  innovative approaches to criminal justice in the City, such as the City Attorney’s \n8  neighborhood prosecutor program.   \n9  45.  If the City of Los Angeles were to lose its Byrne JAG funding, it would be \n10  deprived of valuable resources that enhance Los Angeles’ local criminal law enforcement \n11  efforts and advance public safety.  Continued Byrne JAG funding ensures that the \n12  CLEAR staff can continue to dedicate their time to their roles within the CLEAR team.  \n13  The funding also ensures that a continued dedication to cross-agency collaboration will \n14  pave the way for future successes and innovations still to come. \n15 \nD.  Defendants’ Announcement Of Federal Civil Immigration-Related \n16  Conditions For State And Local Government Receipt of Byrne JAG \nFunding \n17 \n46.  President Donald J. Trump has declared that he would use federal funds as a \n18 \n“weapon” to require state and local support for his civil immigration enforcement \n19 \npolicies.2  On January 25, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13768 directing \n20 \nthe Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to withhold federal funds from \n21 \nwhat he called “Sanctuary Jurisdictions.”3  On April 25, 2017, a federal district court \n22 \nenjoined Section 9(a) of the Executive Order, ruling that the plaintiff jurisdictions in that \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n25  2 Harriet Taylor, Trump to Fox News: “I may defund California as ‘a weapon’ to fight \nillegal immigration,” CNBC.com (Feb. 5, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/TaylorCNBC. \n26 \n3 The White House Office of the Press Secretary, “Executive Order:  Enhancing the \n27 \nPublic Safety on the Interior of the United States,” Whitehouse.gov (January 25, 2017), § \n28  9(a), available at https://tinyurl.com/EO13768. \n13 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 16 of 43   Page ID #:16\n \n1  case are likely to succeed on their claims that the order is unconstitutional because the \n2  Executive Branch is usurping authority that belongs to Congress under the Spending \n3  Clause; the order violates constitutional limits on federal spending authority; the order \n4  violates the Tenth Amendment’s prohibition against the federal government \n5  commandeering local jurisdictions to administer a federal regulatory program; the order \n6  is unconstitutionally vague; and the order violates requirements of due process.  Cty. of \n7  Santa Clara v. Donald J. Trump; City and Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 2017 WL \n8  1459081 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 2017), appeal filed No. 17-16886 (9th Cir. Sept. 18, 2017). \n9  47.  In a July 25, 2017, press release, the Attorney General announced \n10  “immigration compliance requirements” that BJA would be imposing on Byrne JAG \n11  applicants to render certain jurisdictions ineligible for funds if they did not change their \n12  policies and operations.4  The Byrne JAG Press Release explained that, “[f]rom now on, \n13  the Department will only provide Byrne JAG grants to cities and states that comply with \n14  federal law, allow federal immigration access to detention facilities, and provide 48 \n15  hours’ notice before they release an illegal alien wanted by federal authorities.”  \n16  Defendant Sessions further stated that the conditions were intended to encourage \n17  jurisdictions that he described as “sanctuary jurisdictions” to change their policies and \n18  operations. \n19  48.  The Byrne JAG Press Release was accompanied by a one-page “Byrne JAG \n20  Grant Policy Backgrounder” that was “attributable to a DOJ official.”5  The \n21 \n                                                 \n22 \n4 Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs, “Attorney General Sessions Announces \n23  Immigration Compliance Requirements for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \nGrant Programs,” Justice.gov (July 25, 2017), available at \n24 \nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-announces-immigration-\n25  compliance-requirements-edward-byrne-memorial (“Byrne JAG Press Release”) \n(attached hereto as Exhibit 1). \n26 \n5 Department of Justice, Backgrounder on Grant Requirements, available at \n27 \nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/984346/download (“Backgrounder”) \n28  (attached hereto as Exhibit 2). \n14 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 17 of 43   Page ID #:17\n \n1  Backgrounder provides that States and local governments will be required to satisfy three \n2  conditions in order to receive Byrne JAG funding.  First, they must “certify compliance \n3  with section 1373, a federal statute applicable to state and local governments that \n4  generally bars restrictions on communications between state and local agencies and \n5  officials at the Department of Homeland Security” (the “Section 1373 Condition”).  \n6  Section 1373 pertains to providing information regarding the “citizenship or immigration \n7  status, lawful or unlawful,” of an individual.  8 U.S.C. § 1373.  Second, Byrne JAG \n8  funding recipients must permit Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) personnel to \n9  “access any detention facility in order to meet with an alien and inquire as to his or her \n10  right to be or remain in the United States” (the “Access Condition”).  Third, Byrne JAG \n11  funding recipients must “provide at least 48 hours advance notice to DHS regarding the \n12  scheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS \n13  requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien” (the “Notice Condition”).6   \n14  49.  Neither the Byrne JAG Press Release nor the Backgrounder provides a \n15  colorable justification for the Access Condition or the Notice Condition.  And neither \n16  document explains how the purpose of the Byrne JAG Program to provide federal \n17  funding to criminal justice programs at the state and local level relates to the new \n18  conditions, which instead are directed to facilitating efforts by DHS to investigate the \n19  federal civil immigration status of individuals.   \n20  50.  The sole rationale provided for the new grant conditions is an unsupported \n21  assertion in the Byrne JAG Press Release that the new conditions are “part of \n22  accomplishing the Department of Justice’s top priority of reducing violent crime.”  See \n23  Byrne JAG Press Release.  But no evidence is cited in either the Byrne JAG Press \n24  Release or the Backgrounder to support the implied premise that undocumented \n25  immigrants or other non-citizens commit violent crimes at higher rates than the general \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n6  The Access Condition and Notice Condition are phrased differently in the \n28  Backgrounder and the Byrne JAG Press Release.  See supra ¶¶ 47-48. \n15 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 18 of 43   Page ID #:18\n \n1  population, or to indicate that the investigation of federal civil immigration status of \n2  individuals pursuant to the new DOJ conditions is focused on individuals involved in \n3  violent crime. \n4  51.  Defendant Sessions did deliver a speech on July 12, 2017, to law \n5  enforcement personnel in which he cited a University of California Riverside study for \n6  the proposition that cities with sanctuary policies “have more violent crime on average \n7  than those that don’t,”7 but the authors of that study immediately disputed the Attorney \n8  General’s characterization of their research.8  They clarified that their study showed there \n9  was no relationship between a city’s so-called “sanctuary” policies and that city’s crime \n10  rate.9  One of the authors explained: “All of the data to date suggests that either there’s no \n11  relationship, which is what our study found, or there’s an inverse relationship.”10   \n12 \nE.  DOJ’s Imposition Of New Federal Civil Immigration-Related \n13  Conditions In The Agency’s Solicitation For Grant Applications for FY \n2017 Byrne JAG Awards \n14 \n52.  BJA implemented the Attorney General’s announcement by including the \n15 \nnew DOJ conditions in its solicitations for the current Byrne JAG application cycle.

The agency’s solicitation, attached hereto as Exhibit 3, states that applicants \n3  must certify compliance with Section 1373 in order to qualify for Byrne JAG funding.11  \n4  A Byrne JAG application will not be considered by the agency to be complete without \n5  that certification.   \n6  53.  Separately, the agency’s solicitation states that individual awards “will \n7  include two new express conditions.”  These conditions “are designed to ensure” that \n8  local governments that receive JAG funds: \n9  a.  “permit personnel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to \n10  access any correctional or detention facility in order to meet with an alien (or \n11  an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be \n12  or remain in the United States”; and \n13  b.  “provide at least 48 hours’ advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled \n14  release date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS \n15  requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien pursuant to the \n16  Immigration and Nationality Act.” \n17  54.  The agency’s solicitation states that these two new conditions (the \n18  “Challenged Conditions”) “will be an authorized and priority purpose of the award,” even \n19  though the purposes specified by Congress for the Byrne JAG awards did not include \n20  federal civil immigration investigation or enforcement activities.  Indeed, none of the \n21  program priorities set by Congress contemplate federal civil immigration activities.  The \n22  agency’s solicitation also specifies that the costs of complying with these “requirements” \n23  are “allowable costs under the award.”  The solicitation further provides that “all award \n24  conditions” are included in the “award requirements”—that is, the same requirements that \n25 \n                                                 \n26  11 Bureau of Justice Assistance, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, \n“Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program:  FY 2017 Local \n27 \nSolicitation,” available at  https://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGLocal17.pdf \n28  (“Solicitation”). \n17 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 20 of 43   Page ID #:20\n \n1  an applicant must agree to abide by in submitting its application.  See ¶ 38. \n2 \nF.  DOJ’s Modification Of Its Federal Civil Immigration-Related Funding \n3  Conditions In Response To Litigation. \n55.  After DOJ announced its new federal immigration-related conditions and \n4 \nincluded them in the agency’s Byrne JAG solicitation, a number of jurisdictions filed \n5 \nlawsuits challenging these conditions.   \n6 \n56.  In response, DOJ represented in litigation that it had changed the conditions.  \n7 \nClaiming that the “express new conditions” it had defined as “award requirements” in the \n8 \nagency’s solicitation in fact were not intended to represent the actual conditions, DOJ \n9 \npromulgated different versions in an award issued to the County of Greenville, South \n10 \nCarolina (“Greenville Award”), attached hereto as Exhibit 4.  DOJ submitted that award \n11 \nto a federal court as an example and represented to that court that the same language \n12 \nwould be used in other awards.  Notwithstanding that the agency’s solicitation treats the \n13 \nnew conditions as “award requirements,” DOJ represented in court that applicants \n14 \nactually would not be required to confirm compliance with the conditions until after \n15 \nreceiving an award. \n16 \n57.  The Greenville Award states that, “as of the date the recipient accepts [its] \n17 \naward,” the recipient must have in place a “a local ordinance, -rule, -regulation, -policy, \n18 \nor -practice (or an applicable State statute, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice) that is \n19 \n“designed to ensure” that: \n20 \na.  “agents of the United States acting under color of federal law in fact are \n21 \ngiven access [to] a local-government (or local-government-contracted) \n22 \ncorrectional facility for the purpose of permitting such agents to meet with \n23 \nindividuals who are (or are believed by such agents to be) aliens and to \n24 \ninquire as to such individuals’ right to be or remain in the United States” \n25 \n(the revised “Access Condition”); and  \n26 \nb.  “when a local-government (or local-government contracted) correctional \n27 \nfacility receives from DHS a formal written request authorized by the \n28 \n18 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 21 of 43   Page ID #:21\n \n1  Immigration and Nationality Act that seeks advance notice of the scheduled \n2  release date and time for a particular alien in such facility, then such facility \n3  will honor such request and — as early as practicable (see ‘Rules of \n4  Construction’ incorporated by para. 4.B. of this condition) — provide the \n5  requested notice to DHS.” (the revised “Notice Condition”).\n \n6  Greenville Award, ¶ 56(1) (emphasis added). \n7  58.  In addition, the “Rules of Construction” referenced in the Notice Condition \n8  state: “Nothing in this condition shall be understood to authorize or require any recipient, \n9  any subrecipient at any tier, any State or local government, or any other entity or \n10  individual to maintain (or detain) any individual in custody beyond the date and time the \n11  individual would have been released in the absence of this condition.”  Id. ¶¶ 55-56, at \n12  Para. 4.B. \n13  59.  The Rules of Construction also state: “Current DHS practice is ordinarily to \n14  request advance notice of scheduled release ‘as early as practicable (at least 48 hours, if \n15  possible).’ (See DHS Form I-247A (3/17)).  In the event that (e.g., in light of the date \n16  DHS made such request) the scheduled release date and time for an alien are such as not \n17  to permit the advance notice that DHS has requested, it shall not be a violation of this \n18  condition to provide only as much advance notice as practicable.”  Id.   \n19  60.  Like the agency’s solicitation, the Greenville Award claims that compliance \n20  with the Challenged Conditions is an “authorized and priority purpose” of the award, and \n21  that grant funds “may be obligated” for the costs of complying with those Conditions.  Id. \n22  ¶¶ 55(3), 56(3). \n23  61.  Notwithstanding DOJ’s revisions to the Challenged Conditions, DOJ was \n24  preliminarily enjoined from imposing them on the Byrne JAG awards because it was  \n25  likely the conditions exceed DOJ’s statutory authority.  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 2017 \n26  WL 4081821 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 15, 2017), appeal filed. \n27 \n28 \n19 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 22 of 43   Page ID #:22\n \n1 \nG.  DOJ’s New Federal Civil Immigration-Related Conditions Put Los \nAngeles’ Byrne Criminal Justice Assistance Funding At Risk.  \n2 \n62.  In prior years, Los Angeles has established eligibility for, and received funds \n3 \nunder, the Byrne JAG Program.  The City is presently seeking Byrne JAG funding for the \n4 \nFY 2017 cycle.  In response to the agency’s Solicitation, on August 31, 2017, the City \n5 \ntimely submitted its application for funding (“Application”), attached hereto as Exhibit 5.  \n6 \nThe City appended a letter to its Application, noting that, in light of DOJ’s representation \n7 \nthat an applicant would not be required to accept or reject the Challenged Conditions \n8 \nuntil it signed its award document, the City was “submitting its Application with the \n9 \nqualification that it [was] withholding any commitment to, or confirmation of, its \n10 \ncompliance with the Conditions.”  Application, at Attachment 1. \n11 \n63.  Based on the statutory funding formula, and Los Angeles’ track record, Los \n12 \nAngeles anticipates that the City would receive an award and funding but for any \n13 \ncomplications posed by the new conditions.  BJA has already calculated that Los Angeles \n14 \nis eligible to receive $1.9 million in Byrne JAG funds, an amount it divides with the \n15 \nCounty of Los Angeles as a sub-grantee.12  The City has authority to further adjust the \n16 \ndivision of Byrne JAG funds, and the funds are generally divided evenly between the \n17 \nCity and County. \n18 \n64.  Although Los Angeles does not concede that DOJ has authority to impose \n19 \nthe Section 1373 Condition, Los Angeles can certify its compliance with 8 U.S.C. \n20 \n§ 1373.   \n21 \n65.  Los Angeles previously raised concerns about the original version of the \n22 \nNotice Condition, which appeared to require the City to prolong the detention of arrestees \n23 \nin order to provide DHS with a full 48 hours’ notice of release.  The Notice Condition as \n24 \npurportedly revised in the Greenville Award—which DOJ represents it will also include \n25 \n26                                                   \n12 Bureau of Justice Assistance, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, \n27 \n“2017 California Local JAG Allocations,” available at \n28  https://www.bja.gov/Programs/JAG/jag17/17CA.pdf (attached hereto as Exhibit 6). \n20 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 23 of 43   Page ID #:23\n \n1  in future awards—specifies that prolongation of detention is not authorized or required.  \n2  However, the Notice Condition remains ambiguous.  DOJ demands “notice as early as \n3  practicable” regarding “the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien” when \n4  the “correctional facility receives from DHS a formal written request authorized by the \n5  Immigration and Nationality Act.”  “Scheduled release,” however, is generally not an \n6  applicable term in the context of short-term detention operations, like LAPD’s.  Los \n7  Angeles therefore cannot determine what is required of it under the Notice Condition, and \n8  so would be unable to make an unqualified assurance that it complies. \n9  66.  Los Angeles also cannot determine whether DOJ would consider Los \n10  Angeles’ policies and the operations of its jail facilities to be consistent with the agency’s \n11  Access Condition as set forth in the Greenville Award.  The City does not prevent ICE \n12  officials from accessing its detention facilities to interview individuals, but the City \n13  complies with state statutory law (the California TRUTH Act) requiring that detainees \n14  receive notice and information regarding requested interviews by federal authorities.  \n15  LAPD’s practice in implementing this law is to determine the arrestee’s willingness to be \n16  interviewed by federal immigration officials, and not to facilitate any federal civil \n17  immigration interview that the detainee has declined.  In light of Defendants’ previous \n18  actions and rhetoric, and the language of the Access Condition as revised in the \n19  Greenville Award, the City remains concerned that DOJ is demanding “access” that is \n20  inconsistent with state law and LAPD’s related operational policy and practices in its \n21  jails.  Thus, the City cannot ascertain whether, in DOJ’s view, by informing detainees of  \n22  the requested interview pursuant to state law, and by declining to facilitate interviews that \n23  the detainee has declined, the City would not be considered to have a policy or practice \n24  under which federal agents “in fact are given access . . . to meet with individuals.” \n25  67.  As a result, if the Access Condition is not enjoined, the ambiguity as to what \n26  DOJ intends the Condition to require of the City will force the City to submit a qualified \n27  assurance, since DOJ has made it impossible to ascertain what the Condition actually  \n28  requires.  \n21 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 24 of 43   Page ID #:24\n \n1  68.  This Court’s intervention is required to invalidate these unlawful conditions. \n2  H.  Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS”) Grant Program \n3  69.  In a provision entitled “Authority to make public safety and community \n4  policing grants,” Congress authorized the Attorney General to “make[] grants to States, \n5  units of local government, Indian tribal governments, other public and private entities, \n6  and multi-jurisdictional or regional consortia for the purposes described in subsection (b) \n7  of this section.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(a).  In subsection (b), Congress limited “[t]he \n8  purposes for which grants . . . may be made,” id. § 10381(b), to the following twenty-two \n9  purposes: \n10  •  to rehire law enforcement officers who have been laid off as a result of State, \n11  tribal, or local budget reductions for deployment in community-oriented policing;

\n20 \n21  •  to increase the number of law enforcement officers involved in activities that are \n22  focused on interaction with members of the community on proactive crime control \n23  and prevention by redeploying officers to such activities; \n24 \n•  to provide specialized training to law enforcement officers to enhance their conflict \n25 \nresolution, mediation, problem solving, service, and other skills needed to work in \n26 \npartnership with members of the community;

\n5 \n•  to establish, implement, and coordinate crime prevention and control programs \n6 \n(involving law enforcement officers working with community members) with other \n7 \nFederal programs that serve the community and community members to better \n8 \naddress the comprehensive needs of the community and its members; \n9 \n10  •  to support the purchase by a law enforcement agency of no more than 1 service \n11  weapon per officer, upon hiring for deployment in community-oriented policing or, \n12  if necessary, upon existing officers’ initial redeployment to community-oriented \n13  policing;

and \n4 \n•  to permit tribal governments receiving direct law enforcement services from the \n5 \nBureau of Indian Affairs to access the program under this section for use in \n6 \naccordance with the above purposes. \n7 \n8  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1)-(22). \n9 \n70.  Grants disbursed under Section 10381 are known as Community Oriented \n10 \nPolicing Services (“COPS”) grants.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(k).  COPS grant funding is \n11 \nadministered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS Office”) \n12 \nwithin the U.S. Department of Justice.  See 2017 CHP Application Guide at 61.  The \n13 \nCOPS Office administers several types of COPS programs each year.  See, e.g., COPS \n14 \nOffice, Funding Opportunities, https://cops.usdoj.gov/Default.asp?Item=65 (listing \n15 \ndifferent COPS grant programs).  One of those grants is the COPS Hiring Program \n16 \n(“CHP”) grant, which “provides funding directly to law enforcement agencies to hire \n17 \nand/or rehire career law enforcement officers in an effort to increase their community \n18 \npolicing capacity and crime prevention efforts.”  2017 CHP Application Guide at 1, 7.  \n19 \nPursuant to statute, CHP grants may fund up to 75 percent of the salary and benefits of  \n20 \nthe hired or rehired officers.  See id.; see also 34 U.S.C. § 10381(g).  Each fiscal year, the \n21 \nCOPS Office selects local government awardees to receive CHP funds that, in general, \n22 \nmay be used over a period of three years.  See 2017 CHP Application Guide at 1. \n23 \n71.  For purposes of evaluating COPS grant applications, Congress authorized \n24 \nthe Attorney General to give “preferential consideration, where feasible, to an \n25 \napplication” that meets one or more of three criteria: (1) an application “for hiring and \n26 \nrehiring additional career law enforcement officers that involves a non-Federal \n27 \ncontribution exceeding the 25 percent minimum” non-federal contribution; (2) the \n28 \n25 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 28 of 43   Page ID #:28\n \n1  applicant is in a State that has in effect anti-human trafficking laws that treat minors \n2  engaged in commercial sex as victims; or (3) the applicant is in a State that has in effect \n3  laws related to allowing the vacatur of arrests or convictions for non-violent crimes \n4  committed by human trafficking victims directly related to their human trafficking.  34 \n5  U.S.C. § 10381(c). \n6  72.  The COPS Office determines which applicants receive CHP grants through a \n7  points system.  In calculating an applicant’s score for a CHP grant in FY 2016, for \n8  example, “fiscal need . . . constitute[d] 20 percent, crime 30 percent, and community \n9  policing 50 percent of the overall score.”  2016 CHP Application Guide at 21.13  The \n10  COPS Office also provided “additional consideration” to applicants on various grounds.  \n11  Id.  The COPS Office does not explain how localities receive points in the various \n12  categories, or the relative weight given to additional considerations in the overall scoring \n13  system.  See id. \n14 \nI.  Los Angeles Uses COPS Funds For Critical Local Law Enforcement \n15  Needs \n73.  Los Angeles applied for CHP grants in 2012 and 2016, and received the \n16 \ngrants in both years.  In FY 2016, Los Angeles’ score for the CHP grant was 150.67—the \n17 \n14th highest score among over 1,110 applications.  See COPS Office, FY2016 COPS \n18 \nHiring Program Applicant Rankings, \n19 \nhttps://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2016AwardDocs/chp/Ranking_List.pdf. \n20 \n74.  Los Angeles received $3.125 million in CHP funding in FY 2016, which \n21 \nwent toward the hiring of 25 officers to improve community policing.  Los Angeles \n22 \nexplained in its 2016 application that the CHP funds would help expand the “Summer \n23 \nNight Lights” and “Fall Friday Nights” programs, in which parks around Los Angeles \n24 \nextend their operating hours and host free events for the community, with LAPD officers \n25 \npresent to ensure the safety of residents.  See Los Angeles 2016 CHP Application, \n26 \n27 \n                                                 \n28  13 Available at https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/2016AwardDocs/chp/AppGuide.pdf. \n26 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 29 of 43   Page ID #:29\n \n1  attached hereto as Exhibit 7.  In addition, Los Angeles planned to use CHP funds to \n2  expand training programs in community policing.  Id. \n3 \nJ.  Defendants’ Imposition Of New Immigration-Related “Additional \n4  Consideration” Factors For FY 2017 CHP Grants  \n75.  As with the Byrne JAG Program, DOJ also attempts to transform the CHP \n5 \ngrant from a grant for community policing to a tool for pressuring jurisdictions into \n6 \nengaging in federal civil immigration enforcement. \n7 \n76.  In the FY 2017 application guide, the COPS Office expanded the types of \n8 \nlocal law enforcement “focus areas” that would receive additional consideration beyond \n9 \nthose authorized by the COPS grant statute.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b), (c).  For FY 2017 \n10 \nCOPS grants, “additional consideration” is provided for grant-supported programs whose \n11 \n“focus area” is “Illegal Immigration” (the “Immigration Enforcement Focus \n12 \nConsideration”).  See 2017 CHP Application Guide at 27, 43.   \n13 \n77.  Additional consideration is also provided for grant-supported programs \n14 \nfocusing on “Violent Crime” or “Homeland Security.”  See 2017 CHP Application Guide \n15 \nat 27.  Unlike “Illegal Immigration,” these focus areas correspond with authorized \n16 \nstatutory purposes for COPS funding.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(5), (8), (9), (11), (12),  \n17 \n(15) (crime control); id. § 10381(b)(4) (homeland security).  Applicants could select only \n18 \none “focus area.”  See 2017 CHP Application Guide at 42. \n19 \n78.  The COPS Office separately stated that further “additional consideration” \n20 \nmight be given to “applicants that partner with federal law enforcement to address illegal \n21 \nimmigration” (“Immigration Enforcement Partnership Consideration”).  See id. at 27-28.  \n22 \nApplicants were also required to certify compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373.  See id. at 28.     \n23 \n79.  The COPS Office also included the statutorily authorized preferential \n24 \nconsiderations for “applicants in states with certain anti-human trafficking laws that treat \n25 \nminors engaged in commercial sex as victims (referred to as ‘safe harbor’ laws) and \n26 \npermit individuals to vacate arrest or prosecution records for non-violent offenses as a \n27 \nresult of being trafficked.”  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2)-(3); 2017 CHP Application \n28 \n27 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 30 of 43   Page ID #:30\n \n1  Guide at 27.  It also indicated that applicants will receive additional consideration for \n2  hiring a military veteran.  See 2017 CHP Application Guide at 39; 34 U.S.C. \n3  § 10381(b)(2) (“prioritizing the hiring and training of veterans” is one purpose of COPS \n4  grants). The COPS office also indicated that applicants “that experienced an \n5  unanticipated catastrophic event” might be given additional consideration.  See 2017 \n6  CHP Application Guide at 27-28 see 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(4), (17) (programs to counter \n7  mass shootings and terrorism); cf. 42 U.S.C. § 5141 (permitting modification of \n8  administrative conditions of federal assistance programs in light of a “major disaster”). \n9  80.  In its FY 2017 application, Los Angeles applied for $3.125 million in CHP \n10  funds to support hiring officers for its Community Safety Partnership  (“CSP”) Program.  \n11  See Los Angeles 2017 CHP Application, attached hereto as Exhibit 8.  The purpose of the \n12  CSP Program is to build trust and respect by promoting community engagement and a \n13  safe living environment, and to improve public safety.  The CSP Program operates in \n14  selected public housing developments located throughout the Los Angeles Area.  Officers \n15  implement programs for at-risk youth, ensure safe passage on school routes, and build \n16  relationships in the communities through neighborhood watch groups, quality of life \n17  committees, and citizen-police enforcement teams.  Thus, in its application, Los Angeles \n18  selected “Building Trust and Respect” as its focus area.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), \n19  (2), (5), (11).  DOJ is not providing additional consideration for programs within this \n20  focus area.   \n21  81.  Nearly two months after CHP grant applications were due—and after \n22  briefing was complete on the preliminary injunction motion in the Chicago challenge to \n23  the Byrne JAG conditions—Los Angeles received an email from the COPS Office \n24  informing the City that DOJ had created an Immigration Enforcement Partnership \n25  Consideration.  To qualify for that additional consideration, Los Angeles would have had \n26  to certify that it has implemented, or would implement, versions of the Notice and Access \n27  Conditions that DOJ had recently introduced to the Byrne JAG Program.  See Email from \n28 \n28 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 31 of 43   Page ID #:31\n \n1  COPS Office (Sept. 7, 2017), attached hereto as Exhibit 9.  In full, the COPS Office \n2  offered additional consideration to applicants if: \n3  a.  “The applicant entity and/or its governing body has implemented or, before \n4  drawing down grant funds if awarded, will implement rules, regulations, \n5  policies, and/or practices that ensure that U.S. Department of Homeland \n6  Security (‘DHS’) personnel have access to any of the governing body’s \n7  correctional or detention facilities in order to meet with an alien (or an \n8  individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be or \n9  to remain in the United States” (the “Access Requirement”); and    \n10  b.  “The applicant entity and/or its governing body has implemented or, before \n11  drawing down grant funds if awarded, will implement rules, regulations, \n12  policies, and/or practices that ensure that any of the governing body’s \n13  correctional and detention facilities provide advance notice as early as \n14  practicable (at least 48 hours, where possible) to DHS regarding the \n15  scheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody \n16  when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien. This \n17  certification does not require holding an alien beyond his or her scheduled \n18  time of release.” (the “Notice Requirement”). \n19  See “Certification of Illegal Immigration Cooperation,” attached as Attachment 1 to \n20  Exhibit 9. \n21  82.  DOJ informed Los Angeles that it had twelve days, until September 19, \n22  2017, to make the necessary certifications in order to receive additional consideration on \n23  these grounds.  \n24  83.  On the same day that Los Angeles received the e-mail, DOJ released a \n25  statement that jurisdictions would receive “additional points in the application scoring \n26  process [for COPS grants] if their agencies cooperate with federal law enforcement to \n27  address illegal immigration.”  DOJ, Office of Public Affairs, Department of Justice \n28  Announces Priority Consideration Criteria for COPS Office Grants (Sept. 7, 2017), \n29 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 32 of 43   Page ID #:32\n \n1  https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-announces-priority-consideration-\n2  criteria-cops-office-grants, attached hereto as Exhibit 10.  The statement included the \n3  following from Defendant Sessions:  “[c]ities and states that cooperate with federal law \n4  enforcement make all of us safer by helping remove dangerous criminals from our \n5  communities,” and “jurisdictions with these policies in place should be acknowledged for \n6  their commitment to ending violent crime, including violent crime stemming from illegal \n7  immigration.”  Id.  DOJ would thus “recognize jurisdictions that commit to the rule of \n8  law by awarding additional points in the application scoring process for COPS Office \n9  grants.”  Id.; see also COPS Office: Immigration Cooperation Certification Process \n10  Background, https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/995376/download, attached \n11  hereto as Exhibit 11. \n12  84.  After receiving the September 7, 2017, email from the COPS Office, Los \n13  Angeles did not, in the allotted 12 days, certify compliance with the Access and Notice \n14  Requirements. \n15  85.  DOJ’s decision to favor jurisdictions that participate in civil immigration \n16  investigations and enforcement and disfavor those jurisdictions that focus on the \n17  community policing goals of the COPS statute creates an uneven playing field and harms \n18  the City of Los Angeles’s ability to fairly compete for a COPS grant. \n19  COUNT ONE \n20  (Byrne JAG: Violation of Separation of Powers / Ultra Vires Agency Action)  \n21  86.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n22  above as if fully set forth herein. \n23  87.  This cause of action is alleged against Defendants Sessions, Hanson and the \n24  Department of Justice. \n25  88.  Defendants’ imposition on Byrne JAG grant applicants of the Access \n26  Condition and the Notice Condition violates constitutional principles of Separation of \n27  Powers and exceeds DOJ’s lawful authority.   \n28  89.  The Constitution confers the power of the Spending Clause on Congress, not \n30 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 33 of 43   Page ID #:33\n \n1  the Executive Branch.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  It is Congress, then, not an \n2  Executive Branch agency, that has the constitutional authority to impose conditions on \n3  the receipt of federal funds, and even that power is subject to limitations such as \n4  relatedness and clarity.  Defendants here are attempting to wield authority that is vested \n5  in Congress, not in DOJ. \n6  90.  While Congress may have limited authority to delegate its Spending Clause \n7  powers, it must at a minimum speak clearly and unmistakably when it does so, with \n8  specific guidance as to the conditions the Executive Branch may attach on receipt of \n9  federal funds.  This requirement is critical, especially when federalism concerns come \n10  into play, as they do here.  Absent a clear statement, it cannot lightly be presumed that \n11  Congress permitted an agency to invent conditions on federal funds, tying those funds to \n12  that agency’s views on what federal immigration policies state and local governments \n13  should be required to adopt. \n14  91.  Moreover, Congress has made no specific and unambiguous delegation of \n15  authority to DOJ, and under our system of government, a federal agency “has no power \n16  to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”  Louisiana Pub. Serv. \n17  Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  “[W]hen the [Executive] takes measures \n18  incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, [its] power is at its lowest \n19  ebb . . . .”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, \n20  J., concurring).  Here, DOJ is exceeding its delegated authority and contravening the text \n21  and structure of the statute Congress crafted to authorize the expenditure of federal funds \n22  under the Byrne JAG Program.   \n23  92.  Congress specifically directed that Byrne JAG funds be used “to provide \n24  additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical \n25  assistance, and information systems for criminal justice” efforts by state and local \n26  entities.  34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1).  In so doing, Congress enumerated eight types of \n27  criminal justice programs that could receive funding, such as “law enforcement \n28  programs,” “prosecution and court programs,” and “prevention and education programs.”  \n31 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 34 of 43   Page ID #:34\n \n1  Id. § 10152(a)(1)(A)-(H).  \n2  93.  The programs to which Congress expressly directed Byrne JAG funding do \n3  not include inducing state and local support for federal investigations of civil immigration \n4  status.  Yet in imposing the Challenged Conditions, Defendants attempt to divert federal \n5  funds to exactly that purpose.  DOJ goes so far as to convert these immigration-related \n6  requirements into a “priority purpose” of the Byrne JAG award.  The Department also \n7  purports to permit award recipients to dissipate Byrne JAG funds on changing local laws \n8  and policies to comply with the federal immigration conditions on the funds, and even to \n9  spend Byrne JAG funds on the costs to the recipient of “honor[ing] any duly authorized \n10  request from DHS that is encompassed by the[] conditions.”  In essence, DOJ expressly \n11  authorizes the shifting of money that Congress appropriated to advance local criminal \n12  justice programs away from that clear statutory purpose to fund, instead, federal civil \n13  immigration investigations.  This is an unprecedented departure from the way Congress \n14  has chosen to exercise its Spending Clause power. \n15  94.  Congress specifically recognized when it created the Byrne JAG program \n16  that state and local governments maintain the sovereign police power to protect the public \n17  health and safety of their residents by providing police departments with the “flexibility \n18  to spend money for programs that work for them rather than to impose a ‘one size fits all’ \n19  solution.”  H.R. Rep. No. 109-233, at 89 (2005).  The record also shows Congress \n20  intended to “lessen the administrative burden of applying for the grants.”  Id.  DOJ’s \n21  blatant attempt to syphon monies from creative, locally driven Byrne JAG funded \n22  criminal justice programs, like the City’s CLEAR program, Chicago’s Force for Good \n23  and police vehicle purchasing programs, or San Francisco’s drug court and drug \n24  diversion programs, into a complex, “one size fits all” effort to support federal civil \n25  immigration investigations, clearly runs afoul of this congressional intent. \n26  95.  The Challenged Conditions are also grossly inconsistent with the funding \n27  formula established in 34 U.S.C. § 10156.  BJA is required, by congressional mandate, to \n28  allocate funds based on a prescribed formula that takes into account a State’s population, \n32 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 35 of 43   Page ID #:35\n \n1  and the violent crime rates in a given State or locality.  34 U.S.C. § 10156(a), (d).  \n2  Congress enumerated specific certifications and assurances the applicant must make to \n3  access these funds.  Again, Congress did not include a condition mandating local law \n4  enforcement involvement in federal civil immigration investigations. \n5  96.  Not only are the Challenged Conditions incompatible with the basic \n6  structure of the Byrne JAG Program, but they also violate an express rule of construction \n7  imposed by Congress.  Congress directed that the statute creating the Byrne JAG \n8  Program not be construed to authorize DOJ to exercise “any direction, supervision, or \n9  control over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any \n10  political subdivision thereof.”  34 U.S.C. § 10228(a).  The Challenged Conditions do just \n11  that, asserting federal control over Los Angeles and its police department in the operation \n12  of its jail facilities. \n13  97.  The purported basis of DOJ’s attempt to defeat this statutory scheme of the \n14  Byrne JAG program, which was carefully structured by Congress, is a narrow, generally \n15  applicable provision, found elsewhere in the federal law, regarding the overall and \n16  delegation authority within DOJ, set forth in 34 U.S.C. § 10102(a)(6).  Section \n17  10102(a)(6) states, under the heading of “Duties and functions of Assistant Attorney \n18  General [for the Office of Justice Programs]”, that the Assistant Attorney General “shall . \n19  . . exercise such other powers and functions as may be vested in the Assistant Attorney \n20  General pursuant to this chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General, including \n21  placing special conditions on all grants, and determining priority purposes for formula \n22  grants.”  Id.   \n23  98.  This glancing reference to “special conditions” evinces no congressional \n24  intent to give DOJ the authority it now asserts.  The statute does not give blanket \n25  authority to Defendants to place any conditions on any grants; it simply defines the \n26  Assistant Attorney General of OJP as the representative within the DOJ’s hierarchy who \n27  is able to place special conditions on a grant when that authority “may be vested in him.”  \n28  When Congress wishes to actually vest authority to create new conditions, it does so \n33 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 36 of 43   Page ID #:36\n \n1  expressly, for example, authorizing OJP’s Bureau of Justice Assistance to impose \n2  “reasonable conditions” on grant awards under the Violence Against Women Act, so long \n3  as those conditions are limited “to ensure that the States meet statutory, regulatory, and \n4  other program requirements.”  34 U.S.C. § 10446(e)(3).  By contrast, the only authority \n5  Congress vested in the Attorney General with respect to the Byrne JAG Program was to \n6  specify the “form” of the application and the “data, records, and information \n7  (programmatic and financial)” that an applicant must report and maintain, id. § 10153(a), \n8  (a)(4), as well as to “develop[] guidelines” for a “program assessment” “in coordination \n9  with the National Institute of Justice,” id. § 10152(c).   \n10  99.  To the extent DOJ has authority to impose conditions on Byrne JAG awards, \n11  that authority is limited.  Conditions on Byrne JAG awards must relate to the \n12  administration of the grant or the use of grant funds, such as providing funds on a \n13  reimbursement basis, requiring additional, more detailed financial reports, or requiring \n14  the grantee to comply with statutory mandates of nondiscrimination in connection with \n15  grant programs.  See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 794.  Congress did not, in an innocuous grant \n16  administration provision, hide an “elephant[] in [a] mousehole[],”  Whitman v. Am. \n17  Trucking Ass’n, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001)—permitting DOJ to demand significant policy \n18  commitments about operations of local jail facilities to further federal civil immigration \n19  matters in exchange for funding that Congress authorized for local criminal justice \n20  efforts.   \n21  100.  All of these limits on DOJ’s delegated authority are confirmed by the fact \n22  that Congress has considered—and rejected—attempts to link Byrne JAG funding to state \n23  and local participation in federal civil immigration investigations.  See, e.g., Stop \n24  Sanctuary Cities Act, S. 1814, 114th Cong. § 2(b)(2) (2015); Enforce the Law for \n25  Sanctuary Cities Act, H.R. 3009, 114th Cong. § 3(b) (2015). \n26  101.  In sum, DOJ is attempting to exercise a power it does not have.  Defendants’ \n27  attempt to condition federal criminal justice funding intended for cities like Los Angeles \n28  violates the Separation of Powers enshrined in our Constitution.    \n34 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 37 of 43   Page ID #:37\n \n1  COUNT TWO \n2  (Byrne JAG: Tenth Amendment and Spending Clause) \n3  102.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n4  above as if fully set forth herein. \n5  103.  This cause of action is alleged against Defendants Sessions, Hanson and the \n6  Department of Justice. \n7  104.  Even if Congress could have delegated the spending power to DOJ to \n8  impose the Challenged Conditions, and even if it had intended to do so, the delegated \n9  power would still be subject to constitutional restrictions that are not met here.  It is well-\n10  established that the Spending Clause requires that conditions on providing federal funds \n11  to States and local governments must, inter alia, be unambiguous, and be sufficiently \n12  germane to the purpose of the federal funds.  Otherwise, the “condition” amounts to \n13  impermissible regulation and commandeering of States and local governments, in \n14  violation of the Tenth Amendment.  The Challenged Conditions fail both of these \n15  requirements. \n16  105.  Conditions on allocations of federal funds must be stated unambiguously.  \n17  “The legitimacy of Congress’ power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on \n18  whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts” the conditions, and there can be \n19  “no knowing acceptance if a State [or city] . . . is unable to ascertain what is expected of \n20  it.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  It is Congress, \n21  not an agency, that must speak clearly in defining the type of conditions at issue.  But \n22  even if DOJ could satisfy this requirement by speaking with the requisite clarity, it has \n23  not done so here. \n24  106.  The Notice Condition as revised requires “notice as early as practicable” for \n25  “the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien” after the “correctional facility \n26  receives from DHS a formal written request authorized by the Immigration and \n27  Nationality Act.”  It is not clear what this would mean in the context of short-term \n28  detention operations, like LAPD’s, in which “scheduled release” is generally not a \n35 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 38 of 43   Page ID #:38\n \n1  relevant concept. \n2  107.  The Access Condition may be read to require unfettered access to local \n3  detention facilities, even when an individual is informed of the request and declines to be \n4  interviewed in accordance with state law, but the Condition does not make this \n5  requirement unambiguously clear.  If DOJ does intend to view and enforce this Condition \n6  expansively—for instance, to prevent Los Angeles from delivering to detainees the \n7  required “know-your-rights” form, or to require the City to facilitate meetings that have \n8  been declined by the detainees—it would have to have been written in much clearer and \n9  more explicit terms.  Moreover, the Access Condition does not explain what is meant by \n10  an “inquiry” triggering the obligation, and includes no reasonableness requirement or \n11  limiting language to prevent DHS from consuming hours of LAPD staff time, or tying up \n12  LAPD interview rooms, in a manner that interferes with the safety, efficiency, or legal \n13  time restraints that LAPD must consider in operating its jail facilities. \n14  108.  Conditions imposed on recipients of federal funding must also “bear some \n15  relationship to the purpose of federal spending.”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. \n16  144, 167 (1992).  The Challenged Conditions concern federal civil immigration \n17  investigations, which are not sufficiently related—or related at all—to the purpose of the \n18  Byrne JAG Program created by Congress specifically to support state and local criminal \n19  justice efforts.   \n20  COUNT THREE \n21  (Byrne JAG: Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act - Arbitrary and \n22  Capricious Agency Action) \n23  109.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n24  above as if fully set forth herein. \n25  110.  This cause of action is alleged against Defendants Sessions, Hanson and the \n26  Department of Justice. \n27  111.

The decision to impose the Challenged Conditions is arbitrary and \n2  capricious because DOJ adopted it without any reasoned basis, provides no support for its \n3  linkage between participation by state and local law enforcement officials in federal civil \n4  immigration investigations and violent crime, and appears to rely on clearly erroneous \n5  and debunked interpretations of existing studies. \n6  COUNT FOUR \n7  (COPS Grant: Violation of Separation of Powers / Ultra Vires Agency Action)  \n8  113.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n9  above as if fully set forth herein. \n10  114.  This cause of action is alleged against Defendants Sessions, Washington and \n11  the Department of Justice.   \n12  115.  Defendants’ imposition of the Immigration Enforcement Focus \n13  Consideration and the Immigration Enforcement Partnership Consideration (the \n14  “Challenged Considerations”) as “additional considerations” for receiving CHP grants \n15  violates constitutional principles of Separation of Powers and exceeds DOJ’s lawful \n16  authority.   \n17  116.  Congress permitted the Attorney General to give “preferential \n18  consideration” only to grant applicants that meet one or more of three enumerated \n19  criteria.  The preferential considerations authorized by Congress do not include inducing \n20  state and local support for federal investigations of civil immigration violations. See 34 \n21  U.S.C. § 10381(c). \n22  117.  Congress specifically directed that COPS grant funds be used for twenty-two \n23  specific purposes.  As with the preferential considerations, none of these purposes \n24  mentions “illegal immigration” or assisting in civil immigration enforcement and \n25  investigations.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1)-(22).   \n26  118.  By imposing the Challenged Considerations as “additional considerations” \n27  in receiving CHP grants, Defendants attempt to divert federal funds to a consideration not \n28  authorized by Congress, and to disfavor jurisdictions that focus on community policing, \n37 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 40 of 43   Page ID #:40\n \n1  but who are unwilling to participate in federal civil immigration enforcement.  This is an \n2  unprecedented departure from the way Congress has chosen to exercise its Spending \n3  Clause power. \n4  119.  Not only are the Challenged Considerations incompatible with the basic \n5  structure of the COPS statutory framework, but they also violate an express rule of \n6  construction, which Congress adopted.  Congress directed that the statute creating the \n7  COPS grants not be construed to authorize DOJ to exercise “any direction, supervision, \n8  or control over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any \n9  political subdivision thereof.”  34 U.S.C. § 10228(a).  The Challenged Considerations \n10  attempt to do just that, asserting federal control over Los Angeles and its police \n11  department in the operation of its custodial facilities. \n12  120.  Defendants’ efforts to alter the COPS grant program and invent unrelated \n13  “additional considerations” to favor jurisdictions that participate in civil immigration \n14  investigations and enforcement—and necessarily disadvantage communities that do \n15  not—violates the Separation of Powers enshrined in our Constitution.    \n16  COUNT FIVE \n17  (COPS Grant: Tenth Amendment and Spending Clause) \n18  121.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n19  above as if fully set forth herein. \n20  122.  This cause of action is alleged against Defendants Sessions, Washington and \n21  the Department of Justice. \n22  123.  Even if Congress could have delegated the spending power to DOJ to \n23  impose the Challenged Considerations, and even if it had intended to do so, the delegated \n24  power would still be subject to constitutional restrictions.   \n25  124.  Terms and conditions on federal funds, including “additional considerations” \n26  that materially affect to whom a grant is awarded, must be stated unambiguously.  See \n27  supra ¶ 105.  \n28  125.  The Notice Requirement and Access Requirement are ambiguous for the \n38 \n  COMPLAINT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1   Filed 09/29/17   Page 41 of 43   Page ID #:41\n \n1  same reason that the related Byrne JAG conditions are ambiguous.  See supra ¶¶ 106-07.    \n2  They are likewise unrelated to the purpose of the COPS grants to support state and local \n3  community policing efforts.  Indeed, in announcing the new conditions, DOJ made no \n4  effort to substantiate any connection between these spheres of policy that Congress has \n5  treated as distinct. \n6  COUNT SIX \n7  (COPS Grant: Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act - Arbitrary and \n8  Capricious Agency Action) \n9  126.  Los Angeles incorporates and re-alleges each and every allegation contained \n10  above as if fully set forth herein. \n11  127.  This cause of action is alleged against Defendants Sessions, Washington and \n12  the Department of Justice. \n13  128.  Agency actions are unlawful if they are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n14  discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The \n15  decision to impose the Challenged Considerations is arbitrary and capricious because \n16  DOJ adopted it without any reasoned basis, provides no support for its linkage of state \n17  cooperation in federal immigration enforcement with violent crime, and appears to rely \n18  on clearly erroneous and debunked interpretations of existing studies. \n19  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n20 \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff City of Los Angeles respectfully requests that this Court \n21 \nenter judgment in its favor, and grant the following relief: \n22 \n1.

Recipients for FY 2017 will be notified of new conditions of their grants that \nwill increase information sharing between federal, state, and local law enforcement, ensuring that federal \nimmigration authorities have the information they need to enforce immigration laws and keep our \ncommunities safe.\n\"So-called 'sanctuary' policies make all of us less safe because they intentionally undermine our laws and \nprotect illegal aliens who have committed crimes,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. “These policies also \nencourage illegal immigration and even human trafficking by perpetuating the lie that in certain cities, illegal \naliens can live outside the law. This can have tragic consequences, like the 10 deaths we saw in San \nAntonio this weekend. As part of accomplishing the Department of Justice's top priority of reducing violent \ncrime, we must encourage these 'sanctuary' jurisdictions to change their policies and partner with federal \nlaw enforcement to remove criminals. From now on, the Department will only provide Byrne JAG grants to \ncities and states that comply with federal law, allow federal immigration access to detention facilities, and \nprovide 48 hours notice before they release an illegal alien wanted by federal authorities. This is consistent \nwith long-established cooperative principles among law enforcement agencies. This is what the American \npeople should be able to expect from their cities and states, and these long overdue requirements will help \nus take down MS-13 and other violent transnational gangs, and make our country safer.\" \nAttachment(s): \nDownload Byrne JAG Grant Policy Backgrounder\nComponent(s): \nOffice of the Attorney General\nPress Release Number: \n17-826\nUpdated July 25, 2017\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-announces-immigration-complia... 8/21/2017\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-2   Filed 09/29/17   Page 1 of 2   Page ID #:46\n \n \n \nEXHIBIT 2 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-2   Filed 09/29/17   Page 2 of 2   Page ID #:47\nBACKGROUNDER ON GRANT REQUIREMENTS\n  \nThe following is on background, attributable to a  DOJ official:  \n \t  Today, consistent with the goal of increasing  information sharing  between federal, state,  and local law \nenforcement, Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant  Program (“Byrne JAG”) recipients  for FY \n2017  have been notified that they  will be required to do the following:   \n \no \t  certify compliance with section 1373, a federal statute applicable to state and local governments \nthat generally bars restrictions on communications between state and local agencies and officials \nat the Department of Homeland Security;  \n \no \t  permit personnel of the  U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to access any detention \nfacility in order to meet with an alien and inquire  as to his or her right to be or remain in the \nUnited States; and  \n \no \t  provide at least 48 hours advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of  \nan alien in the jurisdiction’s custody  when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of \nthe alien.  \n \nFor background on the Byrne JAG program, please click here.  \n \nFor more information on Byrne JAG allocation for past fiscal years, please  click here.  \n \nFor more information on Byrne JAG as it pertains to FY2017, please click here.   \n \n \t  Improving the flow of information  between federal and state law enforcement authorities is paramount to \nensuring that federal immigration authorities have the information they need to enforce the law and keep our  \ncommunities safe.   \n \n \t  8 U.S.C. § 1373 is a federal statute applicable to state and local governments that  generally bars restrictions  \non communication between state and local agencies and officials at  the Department of Homeland Security  \n(and certain other entities) with respect to information regarding the citizenship or immigration status of any  \nindividual.    \n \n \t  In March 2016, the Department’s Office of Justice Programs (“OJP”) notified recipients of Byrne JAG  \ngrants of the requirement to comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373.  The Department has also announced that it will \ntake all lawful steps to claw  back any funds awarded to a jurisdiction that violates its grant agreement, \nincluding the condition to comply with section 1373.  \n \n \t  These common-sense measures will  improve the flow of information between federal, state, and local law \nenforcement,  and help keep our communities safe. Every  year, the Department of Justice awards billions of \ndollars in grants to state and local jurisdictions across the United States.  Unfortunately, some of these  \njurisdictions have adopted policies and regulations that frustrate the  enforcement of federal immigration \nlaw, including by refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in information sharing  about \nillegal aliens who commit crimes.    \n \n \t  These measures will also  prevent the counterproductive use of federal funds  for policies that frustrate \nfederal immigration enforcement.   By  refusing to communicate with the federal officials, these jurisdictions \njeopardize the safety of their residents and undermine the Department’s ability to protect the public and \nreduce  crime  and violence.    \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 1 of 42   Page ID #:48\n \n \n \nEXHIBIT 3 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 2 of 42   Page ID #:49\n   OMB No. 1121-0329 \n   Approval Expires 12/31/2018 \n    \n \nU.S. Department of Justice \nOffice of Justice Programs \nBureau of Justice Assistance  \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Bureau of Justice \nAssistance (BJA) is seeking applications for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \nGrant (JAG) Program.

Program Description \n \nOverview \nThe Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program is the primary provider of \nfederal criminal justice funding to States and units of local government. BJA will award JAG \nProgram funds to eligible units of local government under this FY 2017 JAG Program Local \nSolicitation. (A separate solicitation will be issued for applications to BJA directly from States.) \n \nStatutory Authority: The JAG Program statute is Subpart I of Part E of Title I of the Omnibus \nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Title I of the “Omnibus Act” generally is codified at \nChapter 26 of Title 42 of the United States Code; the JAG Program statute is codified at 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 3750-3758. See also 28 U.S.C. § 530C(a). \n \nProgram-Specific Information \n \nPermissible uses of JAG Funds – In general \nIn general, JAG funds awarded to a unit of local government under this FY 2017 solicitation may \nbe used to provide additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, \ntechnical assistance, and information systems for criminal justice, including for any one or more \nof the following: \n \n•  Law enforcement programs \n•  Prosecution and court programs \n•  Prevention and education programs \n•  Corrections and community corrections programs \n•  Drug treatment and enforcement programs \n•  Planning, evaluation, and technology improvement programs \n•  Crime victim and witness programs (other than compensation) \n•  Mental health programs and related law enforcement and corrections programs, \nincluding behavioral programs and crisis intervention teams \n    \nUnder the JAG Program, units of local government may use award funds for broadband \ndeployment and adoption activities as they relate to criminal justice activities. \n   \n5 \nBJA-2017-11301 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 7 of 42   Page ID #:54\nLimitations on the use of JAG funds \nProhibited and controlled uses of funds – JAG funds may not be used (whether directly or \nindirectly) for any purpose prohibited by federal statute or regulation, including those purposes \nspecifically prohibited by the JAG Program statute as set out at 42 U.S.C. § 3751(d):  \n  \n(1) Any security enhancements or any equipment to any nongovernmental entity \nthat is not engaged in criminal justice or public safety. \n \n(2) Unless the Attorney General certifies that extraordinary and exigent \ncircumstances exist that make the use of such funds to provide such matters \nessential to the maintenance of public safety and good order— \n \n(a) Vehicles (excluding police cruisers), vessels (excluding police boats), or \naircraft (excluding police helicopters) \n(b) Luxury items \n(c) Real estate \n(d) Construction projects (other than penal or correctional institutions) \n(e) Any similar matters \n \nFor additional information on expenditures prohibited under JAG, as well as expenditures that \nare permitted but “controlled,” along with the process for requesting approval regarding \ncontrolled items, refer to the JAG Prohibited and Controlled Expenditures Guidance. Information \nalso appears in the JAG FAQs. \n \nCap on use of JAG award funds for administrative costs – A unit of local government may use \nup to 10 percent of a JAG award, including up to 10 percent of any earned interest, for costs \nassociated with administering the award. \n \nProhibition of supplanting; no use of JAG funds as “match” – JAG funds may not be used to \nsupplant State or local funds but must be used to increase the amounts of such funds that \nwould, in the absence of federal funds, be made available for law enforcement activities. See \nthe JAG FAQs on BJA’s JAG web page for examples of supplanting. \n \nAlthough supplanting is prohibited, as discussed under “What An Application Should Include,” \nthe leveraging of federal funding is encouraged.  \n \nAbsent specific federal statutory authority to do so, JAG award funds may not be used as \n“match” for the purposes of other federal awards.  \n \nOther restrictions on use of funds – If a unit of local government chooses to use its FY 2017 \nJAG funds for particular, defined types of expenditures, it must satisfy certain preconditions:  \n \n  Body-Worn Cameras (BWC)  \nA unit of local government that proposes to use FY 2017 JAG award funds to purchase \nBWC equipment or to implement or enhance BWC programs, must provide to OJP a \ncertification(s) that the unit of local government has policies and procedures in place \nrelated to BWC equipment usage, data storage and access, privacy considerations, \ntraining, etc. The certification can be found at: \nhttps://www.bja.gov/Funding/BodyWornCameraCert.pdf.  \n \n6 \nBJA-2017-11301 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 8 of 42   Page ID #:55\nA unit of local government that proposes to use JAG funds for BWC-related expenses \nwill have funds withheld until the required certification is submitted and approved by \nOJP.   \n \nThe BJA BWC Toolkit provides model BWC policies and best practices to assist \ndepartments in implementing BWC programs. \n \nApart from the JAG Program, BJA provides funds under the Body-Worn Camera Policy \nand Implementation Program (BWC Program). The BWC Program allows jurisdictions to \ndevelop and implement policies and practices required for effective program adoption \nand address program factors including the purchase, deployment, and maintenance of \ncamera systems and equipment; data storage and access; and privacy considerations. \nInterested units of local government may wish to refer to the BWC web page for more \ninformation. Units of local government should note, however, that JAG funds may not be \nused as any part of the 50 percent match required by the BWC Program.  \n \n  Body Armor \nBallistic-resistant and stab-resistant body armor can be funded through the JAG \nProgram, as well as through BJA’s Bulletproof Vest Partnership (BVP) Program. The \nBVP Program is designed to provide a critical resource to local law enforcement through \nthe purchase of ballistic-resistant and stab-resistant body armor. For more information \non the BVP Program, including eligibility and application, refer to the BVP web page. \nUnits of local government should note, however, that JAG funds may not be used as any \npart of the 50 percent match required by the BVP Program. \n \nBody armor purchased with JAG funds may be purchased at any threat level, make, or \nmodel from any distributor or manufacturer, as long as the body armor has been tested \nand found to comply with the latest applicable National Institute of Justice (NIJ) ballistic \nor stab standards. In addition, body armor purchased must be made in the United \nStates.  \n \nAs is the case in the BVP Program, units of local government that propose to purchase \nbody armor with JAG funds must certify that law enforcement agencies receiving body \narmor have a written “mandatory wear” policy in effect. FAQs related to the mandatory \nwear policy and certifications can be found at: \nhttps://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGFAQ.pdf. This policy must be in place for at least all \nuniformed officers before any FY 2017 funding can be used by the unit of local \ngovernment for body armor. There are no requirements regarding the nature of the \npolicy other than it being a mandatory wear policy for all uniformed officers while on \nduty. The certification must be signed by the Authorized Representative and must be \nattached to the application if proposed as part of the application. If the unit of local \ngovernment proposes to change project activities to utilize JAG funds to purchase body \narmor after the award is accepted, the unit of local government must submit the signed \ncertification to BJA at that time. A mandatory wear concept and issues paper and a \nmodel policy are available by contacting the BVP Customer Support Center at \nvests@usdoj.gov or toll free at 1–877–758–3787. The certification form related to \nmandatory wear can be found at: \nwww.bja.gov/Funding/BodyArmorMandatoryWearCert.pdf. \n \n  DNA Testing of Evidentiary Materials and Upload of DNA Profiles to a Database \n7 \nBJA-2017-11301 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 9 of 42   Page ID #:56\nIf JAG Program funds will be used for DNA testing of evidentiary materials, any resulting \neligible DNA profiles must be uploaded to the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS, \nthe national DNA database operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI]) by a \ngovernment DNA lab with access to CODIS. No profiles generated with JAG funding \nmay be entered into any other non-governmental DNA database without prior express \nwritten approval from BJA.  \n \nIn addition, funds may not be used for purchase of DNA equipment and supplies when \nthe resulting DNA profiles from such technology are not accepted for entry into CODIS. \n \n  Interoperable Communication \nUnits of local government (including subrecipients) that use FY 2017 JAG funds to \nsupport emergency communications activities (including the purchase of interoperable \ncommunications equipment and technologies such as voice-over-internet protocol \nbridging or gateway devices, or equipment to support the build out of wireless \nbroadband networks in the 700 MHz public safety band under the Federal \nCommunications Commission [FCC] Waiver Order) should review FY 2017 SAFECOM \nGuidance. The SAFECOM Guidance is updated annually to provide current information \non emergency communications policies, eligible costs, best practices, and technical \nstandards for State, local, tribal, and territorial grantees investing federal funds in \nemergency communications projects. Additionally, emergency communications projects \nshould support the Statewide Communication Interoperability Plan (SCIP) and be \ncoordinated with the fulltime Statewide Interoperability Coordinator (SWIC) in the State \nof the project. As the central coordination point for their State’s interoperability effort, the \nSWIC plays a critical role, and can serve as a valuable resource. SWICs are responsible \nfor the implementation of SCIP through coordination and collaboration with the \nemergency response community. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of \nEmergency Communications maintains a list of SWICs for each of the States and \nterritories. Contact OEC@hq.dhs.gov. All communications equipment purchased with FY \n2017 JAG Program funding should be identified during quarterly performance metrics \nreporting. \n \nIn order to promote information sharing and enable interoperability among disparate \nsystems across the justice and public safety communities, OJP requires the recipient to \ncomply with DOJ's Global Justice Information Sharing Initiative guidelines and \nrecommendations for this particular grant. Recipients must conform to the Global \nStandards Package (GSP) and all constituent elements, where applicable, as described \nat: https://www.it.ojp.gov/gsp grantcondition. Recipients must document planned \napproaches to information sharing and describe compliance to GSP and an appropriate \nprivacy policy that protects shared information, or provide detailed justification for why \nan alternative approach is recommended. \n \nRequired compliance with applicable federal laws \nBy law, the chief executive (e.g., the mayor) of each unit of local government that applies for an \nFY 2017 JAG award must certify that the unit of local government will “comply with all provisions \nof [the JAG program statute] and all other applicable Federal laws.” To satisfy this requirement, \neach unit of local government applicant must submit two properly executed certifications using \nthe forms shown in Appendix I and Appendix II.   \n \nAll applicants should understand that OJP awards, including certifications provided in \nconnection with such awards, are subject to review by DOJ, including by OJP and by the DOJ \n8 \nBJA-2017-11301 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 10 of 42   Page ID #:57\nOffice of the Inspector General. Applicants also should understand that a materially false, \nfictitious, or fraudulent statement (or concealment or omission of a material fact) in a \ncertification submitted to OJP in support of an application may be the subject of criminal \nprosecution, and also may result in civil penalties and administrative remedies for false claims \nor otherwise. Administrative remedies that may be available to OJP with respect to an FY 2017 \naward include suspension or termination of the award, placement on the DOJ high risk grantee \nlist, disallowance of costs, and suspension or debarment of the recipient. \n \nBJA areas of emphasis \nBJA recognizes that there are significant pressures on local criminal justice systems. In these \nchallenging times, shared priorities and leveraged resources can make a significant impact. As \na component of OJP, BJA intends to focus much of its work on the areas of emphasis described \nbelow, and encourages each unit of local government recipient of an FY 2017 JAG award to join \nus in addressing these challenges: \n \n•  Reducing Gun Violence – Gun violence has touched nearly every State and local \ngovernment in America. While our nation has made great strides in reducing violent \ncrime, some municipalities and regions continue to experience unacceptable levels of \nviolent crime at rates far in excess of the national average. BJA encourages units of \nlocal government to invest JAG funds in programs to combat gun violence, enforce \nexisting firearms laws, and improve the process for ensuring that persons prohibited \nfrom purchasing guns are prevented from doing so by enhancing reporting to the FBI’s \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). \n \n•  National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) – The FBI has formally announced \nits intentions to establish NIBRS as the law enforcement crime data reporting standard \nfor the nation. The transition to NIBRS will provide a more complete and accurate picture \nof crime at the national, State, and local levels. Once this transition is complete, the FBI \nwill no longer collect summary data and will accept data only in the NIBRS format. Also, \nonce the transition is complete, JAG award amounts will be calculated on the basis of \nsubmitted NIBRS data. Transitioning all law enforcement agencies to NIBRS is the first \nstep in gathering more comprehensive crime data. BJA encourages recipients of FY \n2017 JAG awards to use JAG funds to expedite the transition to NIBRS.  \n \n•  Officer Safety and Wellness – The issue of law enforcement safety and wellness is an \nimportant priority for the Department of Justice. Preliminary data compiled by the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund indicates that there were 135 line-of-\nduty law enforcement deaths in 2016—the highest level in the past 5 years and a 10 \npercent increase from 2015 (123 deaths).  \n \nFirearms-related deaths continued to be the leading cause of death (64), increasing 56 \npercent from 2015 (41). Of particular concern is that of the 64 firearms-related deaths, \n21 were as a result of ambush-style attacks representing the highest total in more than \ntwo decades. Traffic-related deaths continued to rise in 2016 with 53 officers killed, a 10 \npercent increase from 2015 (48 deaths). Additionally, there were 11 job-related illness \ndeaths in 2016, mostly heart attacks. \n \nBJA sees a vital need to focus not only on tactical officer safety concerns but also on \nhealth and wellness as they affect officer performance and safety. It is important for law \nenforcement to have the tactical skills necessary, and also be physically and mentally \nwell, to perform, survive, and be resilient in the face of the demanding duties of the \n9 \nBJA-2017-11301 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 11 of 42   Page ID #:58\nprofession. BJA encourages units of local government to use JAG funds to address \nthese needs by providing training, including paying for tuition and travel expenses \nrelated to attending trainings such as VALOR training, as well as funding for health and \nwellness programs for law enforcement officers.  \n \n•  Border Security – The security of United States borders is critically important to the \nreduction and prevention of transnational drug-trafficking networks and combating all \nforms of human trafficking within the United States (sex and labor trafficking of foreign \nnationals and U.S. citizens of all sexes and ages). These smuggling operations on both \nsides of the border contribute to a significant increase in violent crime and U.S. deaths \nfrom dangerous drugs. Additionally, illegal immigration continues to place a significant \nstrain on federal, State, and local resources—particularly on those agencies charged \nwith border security and immigration enforcement—as well as the local communities into \nwhich many of the illegal immigrants are placed. BJA encourages units of local \ngovernment to use JAG funds to support law enforcement hiring, training, and \ntechnology enhancement in the area of border security. \n \n•  Collaborative Prosecution – BJA supports strong partnerships between prosecutors and \npolice as a means to improve case outcomes and take violent offenders off the street. \nBJA strongly encourages State and local law enforcement to foster strong partnerships \nwith prosecutors to adopt new collaborative strategies aimed at combating increases in \ncrime, particularly violent crime. (BJA's “Smart Prosecution” Initiative is a related effort \nby OJP to promote partnerships between prosecutors and researchers to develop and \ndeliver effective, data-driven, evidence-based strategies to solve chronic problems and \nfight crime.) \n \nGoals, Objectives, and Deliverables \nIn general, the FY 2017 JAG Program is designed to provide additional personnel, equipment, \nsupplies, contractual support, training, technical assistance, and information systems for \ncriminal justice. The JAG Local Program is designed to assist units of local government with \nrespect to criminal justice. \n \nAs discussed in more detail below, a unit of local government that receives an FY 2017 JAG \naward will be required to prepare various types of reports and to submit data related to \nperformance measures and accountability. The Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables are directly \nrelated to the JAG Progam accountability measures. \n \nEvidence-Based Programs or Practices \nOJP strongly emphasizes the use of data and evidence in policy making and program \ndevelopment in criminal justice, juvenile justice, and crime victim services. OJP is committed to: \n \n•  Improving the quantity and quality of evidence OJP generates \n•  Integrating evidence into program, practice, and policy decisions within OJP and the \nfield \n•  Improving the translation of evidence into practice \n \nOJP considers programs and practices to be evidence-based when their effectiveness has been \ndemonstrated by causal evidence, generally obtained through one or more outcome \nevaluations. Causal evidence documents a relationship between an activity or intervention \n(including technology) and its intended outcome, including measuring the direction and size of a \nchange, and the extent to which a change may be attributed to the activity or intervention. \n10 \nBJA-2017-11301 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 12 of 42   Page ID #:59\nCausal evidence depends on the use of scientific methods to rule out, to the extent possible, \nalternative explanations for the documented change. The strength of causal evidence, based on \nthe factors described above, will influence the degree to which OJP considers a program or \npractice to be evidence-based. The OJP CrimeSolutions.gov website is one resource that \napplicants may use to find information about evidence-based programs in criminal justice, \njuvenile justice, and crime victim services. \n \nA useful matrix of evidence-based policing programs and strategies is available through the \nCenter for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George Mason University. BJA offers a number of \nprogram models designed to effectively implement promising and evidence-based strategies \nthrough the BJA “Smart Suite” of programs, including Smart Policing, Smart Supervision, Smart \nPretrial, Smart Defense, Smart Prosecution, Smart Reentry, and others (see: \nhttps://www.bja.gov/Programs/CRPPE/smartsuite.html). BJA encourages units of local \ngovernment to use JAG funds to support these “smart on crime” strategies, including effective \npartnerships with universities, research partners, and non-traditional criminal justice partners. \n \nBJA Success Stories \nThe BJA Success Stories web page features projects that have demonstrated success or \nshown promise in reducing crime and positively impacting communities. This web page will be a \nvaluable resource for States, localities, territories, tribes, and criminal justice professionals that \nseek to identify and learn about JAG and other successful BJA-funded projects linked to \ninnovation, crime reduction, and evidence-based practices. BJA strongly encourages the \nrecipient to submit success stories annually (or more frequently). \n \nIf a unit of local government has a success story it would like to submit, it may be submitted \nthrough My BJA account, using “add a Success Story” and the Success Story Submission form. \nRegister for a My BJA account using this registration link.  \n \n \nB. Federal Award Information  \n \nBJA estimates that it will make up to 1,100 local awards totaling an estimated $83,000,000.  \n \nAwards of at least $25,000 are 4 years in length, and award periods will be from October 1, \n2016 through September 30, 2020. Extensions beyond this period may be made on a case-by-\ncase basis at the discretion of BJA and must be requested via GMS no less than 30 days prior \nto the grant end date.  \n \nAwards of less than $25,000 are 2 years in length, and award periods will be from October 1, \n2016 through September 30, 2018. Extensions of up to 2 years can be requested for these \nawards via GMS no less than 30 days prior to the grant end date, and will be automatically \ngranted upon request.  \n \nAll awards are subject to the availability of appropriated funds and to any modifications or \nadditional requirements that may be imposed by statute. \n \nType of Award \nBJA expects that any award under this solicitation will be in the form of a grant. See Statutory \nand Regulatory Requirements; Award Conditions, under Section F. Federal Award \nAdministration Information, for a brief discussion of important statutes, regulations, and award \nconditions that apply to many (or in some cases, all) OJP grants. \n11 \nBJA-2017-11301 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 13 of 42   Page ID #:60\n \nJAG awards are based on a statutory formula as described below.  \n \nOnce each fiscal year’s overall JAG Program funding level is determined, BJA works with the \nBureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to begin a four-step grant award calculation process, which, in \ngeneral, consists of:  \n \n(1) Computing an initial JAG allocation for each State, based on its share of violent crime \nand population (weighted equally).  \n \n(2) Reviewing the initial JAG allocation amount to determine if the State allocation is less \nthan the minimum award amount defined in the JAG legislation (0.25 percent of the \ntotal). If this is the case, the State is funded at the minimum level, and the funds required \nfor this are deducted from the overall pool of JAG funds. Each of the remaining States \nreceive the minimum award plus an additional amount based on its share of violent \ncrime and population.  \n \n(3) Dividing each State’s final award amount (except for the territories and District of \nColumbia) between the State and its units of local governments at a rate of 60 and 40 \npercent, respectively.  \n \n(4) Determining unit of local government award allocations, which are based on their \nproportion of the State’s 3-year violent crime average. If the “eligible award amount” for a \nparticular unit of local government as determined on this basis is $10,000 or more, then \nthe unit of local government is eligible to apply directly to OJP (under the JAG Local \nsolicitation) for a JAG award. If the “eligible award amount” to a particular unit of local \ngovernment as determined on this basis would be less than $10,000, however, the funds \nare not made available for a direct award to that particular unit of local government, but \ninstead are added to the amount that otherwise would have been awarded to the State.  \n \nFinancial Management and System of Internal Controls \nAward recipients and subrecipients (including recipients or subrecipients that are pass-through \nentities1) must, as described in the Part 200 Uniform Requirements2 as set out at 2 C.F.R. \n200.303:  \n \n(a) Establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that \nprovides reasonable assurance that [the recipient (and any subrecipient)] is \nmanaging the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, \nand the terms and conditions of the Federal award. These internal controls \nshould be in compliance with guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the \nFederal Government” issued by the Comptroller General of the United States \nand the “Internal Control Integrated Framework”, issued by the Committee of \nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \n(b) Comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the \nFederal awards. \n                                                \n1 For purposes of this solicitation, the phrase “pass-through entity” includes any recipient or subrecipient that provides \na subaward (\"subgrant”) to carry out part of the funded award or program. \n2 The \"Part 200 Uniform Requirements” refers to the DOJ regulation at 2 C.F.R Part 2800, which adopts (with certain \nmodifications) the provisions of 2 C.F.R. Part 200. \n 12 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 14 of 42   Page ID #:61\n(c) Evaluate and monitor [the recipient’s (and any subrecipient’s)] compliance with \nstatutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards. \n(d) Take prompt action when instances of noncompliance are identified including \nnoncompliance identified in audit findings. \n(e) Take reasonable measures to safeguard protected personally identifiable \ninformation and other information the Federal awarding agency or pass-through \nentity designates as sensitive or [the recipient (or any subrecipient)] considers \nsensitive consistent with applicable Federal, State, local, and tribal laws \nregarding privacy and obligations of confidentiality. \nTo help ensure that applicants understand the administrative requirements and cost principles, \nOJP encourages prospective applicants to enroll, at no charge, in the DOJ Grants Financial \nManagement Online Training, available here. \nBudget and Financial Information \nTrust Fund – Units of local government may draw down JAG funds either in advance or on a \nreimbursement basis. To draw down in advance, a trust fund must be established in which to \ndeposit the funds. The trust fund may or may not be an interest-bearing account. If \nsubrecipients draw down JAG funds in advance, they also must establish a trust fund in which \nto deposit funds.  \n \nTracking and reporting regarding JAG funds used for State administrative costs – As indicated \nearlier, a unit of local government may use up to 10 percent of a JAG award, including up to 10 \npercent of any earned interest, for costs associated with administering the award. Administrative \ncosts (when utilized) must be tracked separately; a recipient must report in separate financial \nstatus reports (SF-425) those expenditures that specifically relate to each particular JAG award \nduring any particular reporting period.  \n \nNo commingling – Both the unit of local government recipient and all subrecipients of JAG funds \nare prohibited from commingling funds on a program-by-program or project-by-project basis. For \nthis purpose, use of the administrative JAG funds to perform work across all active awards in \nany one year is not considered comingling. \n \nDisparate Certification – In some cases, as defined by the legislation, a disparity may exist \nbetween the funding eligibility of a county and its associated municipalities. Three different types \nof disparities may exist: \n \n•  The first type is a zero-county disparity. This situation exists when one or more \nmunicipalities within a county are eligible for a direct award but the county is not; yet the \ncounty is responsible for providing criminal justice services (such as prosecution and \nincarceration) for the municipality. In this case, the county is entitled to part of the \nmunicipality’s award because it shares the cost of criminal justice operations, although it \nmay not report crime data to the FBI. This is the most common type of disparity. \n \n•  A second type of disparity exists when both a county and a municipality within that \ncounty qualify for a direct award, but the award amount for the municipality exceeds 150 \npercent of the county’s award amount. \n 13 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 15 of 42   Page ID #:62\n•  The third type of disparity occurs when a county and multiple municipalities within that \ncounty are all eligible for direct awards, but the sum of the awards for the individual \nmunicipalities exceeds 400 percent of the county’s award amount. \n \nJurisdictions certified as disparate must identify a fiscal agent that will submit a joint application \nfor the aggregate eligible allocation to all disparate municipalities. The joint application must \ndetermine and specify the award distribution to each unit of local government and the purposes \nfor which the funds will be used. When beginning the JAG application process, a Memorandum \nof Understanding (MOU) that identifies which jurisdiction will serve as the applicant or fiscal \nagent for joint funds must be completed and signed by the Authorized Representative for each \nparticipating jurisdiction. The signed MOU should be attached to the application. For a sample \nMOU, go to: www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGMOU.pdf. \n \nCost Sharing or Match Requirement \nThe JAG Program does not require a match.  \n \nFor additional cost sharing and match information, see the DOJ Grants Financial Guide. \n \nPre-Agreement Costs (also known as Pre-award Costs) \nPre-agreement costs are costs incurred by the applicant prior to the start date of the period of \nperformance of the grant award.  \n \nOJP does not typically approve pre-agreement costs. An applicant must request and obtain the \nprior written approval of OJP for any such costs. All such costs incurred prior to award and prior \nto approval of the costs are incurred at the sole risk of the applicant. (Generally, no applicant \nshould incur project costs before submitting an application requesting federal funding for those \ncosts.)  \n \nShould there be extenuating circumstances that make it appropriate for OJP to consider \napproving pre-agreement costs, the applicant may contact the point of contact listed on the title \npage of this solicitation for the requirements concerning written requests for approval. If \napproved in advance by OJP, award funds may be used for pre-agreement costs, consistent \nwith the recipient’s approved budget and applicable cost principles. See the section on “Costs \nRequiring Prior Approval” in the DOJ Grants Financial Guide for more information. \n \nPrior Approval, Planning, and Reporting of Conference/Meeting/Training Costs\\ \nOJP strongly encourages every applicant that proposes to use award funds for any conference-, \nmeeting-, or training-related activity (or similar event) to review carefully—before submitting an \napplication—the OJP and DOJ policy and guidance on approval, planning, and reporting of such \nevents, available at: \nhttps://www.ojp.gov/financialguide/DOJ/PostawardRequirements/chapter3.10a.htm.  \n \nOJP policy and guidance (1) encourage minimization of conference, meeting, and training costs; \n(2) require prior written approval (which may affect project timelines) of most conference, \nmeeting, and training costs for cooperative agreement recipients, as well as some conference, \nmeeting, and training costs for grant recipients; and (3) set cost limits, which include a general \nprohibition of all food and beverage costs. \n \nCosts Associated with Language Assistance (if applicable) \nIf an applicant proposes a program or activity that would deliver services or benefits to \nindividuals, the costs of taking reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to those services \n 14 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 16 of 42   Page ID #:63\nor benefits for individuals with limited English proficiency may be allowable. Reasonable steps \nto provide meaningful access to services or benefits may include interpretation or translation \nservices, where appropriate. \n \nFor additional information, see the “Civil Rights Compliance” section under “Overview of Legal \nRequirements Generally Applicable to OJP Grants and Cooperative Agreements - FY 2017 \nAwards” in the OJP Funding Resource Center. \n \n \nC. Eligibility Information  \n \nFor information on eligibility, see the title page of this solicitation.  \n \nNote that, as discussed in more detail below, the certification regarding compliance with \n8 U.S.C. § 1373 must be executed and submitted before a unit of local government (other than \nan Indian tribal government) can make a valid award acceptance. Also, a unit of local \ngovernment may not receive award funds (and its award will include a condition that withholds \nfunds) until it submits a properly executed “Certifications and Assurances by Chief Executive of \nApplicant Government.” \n \n \nD. Application and Submission Information \n \nWhat an Application Should Include \nThis section describes in detail what an application should include. An applicant should \nanticipate that if it fails to submit an application that contains all of the specified elements, it may \nnegatively affect the review of its application; and, should a decision be made to make an \naward, it may result in the inclusion of award conditions that preclude the recipient from \naccessing or using award funds until the recipient satisfies the conditions and OJP makes the \nfunds available. \n \nAn applicant may combine the Budget Narrative and the Budget Detail Worksheet in one \ndocument. If an applicant submits only one budget document, however, it must contain both \nnarrative and detail information. Please review the “Note on File Names and File Types” under \nHow to Apply to be sure applications are submitted in permitted formats. \n \nOJP strongly recommends that applicants use appropriately descriptive file names (e.g., \n“Program Narrative,” “Budget Detail Worksheet and Budget Narrative,” “Timelines,” \n“Memoranda of Understanding,” “Résumés”) for all attachments. Also, OJP recommends that \napplicants include résumés in a single file. \n \nIn general, if a unit of local government fails to submit required information or \ndocuments, OJP either will return the unit of local government’s application in the Grants \nManagement System (GMS) for submission of the missing information or documents, or \nwill attach a condition to the award that will withhold award funds until the necessary \ninformation and documents are submitted. (As discussed elsewhere in this solicitation, \nthe certification regarding compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373—which is set out at Appendix \nII—will be handled differently. Unless and until that certification is submitted, the unit of \nlocal government (other than an Indian tribal government) will be unable to make a valid \nacceptance of the award.) \n 15 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 17 of 42   Page ID #:64\n \n1.  Information to Complete the Application for Federal Assistance (SF-424) \nThe SF-424 is a required standard form used as a cover sheet for submission of pre-\napplications, applications, and related information. GMS takes information from the \napplicant’s profile to populate the fields on this form. \n \nTo avoid processing delays, an applicant must include an accurate legal name on its SF-\n424. Current OJP award recipients, when completing the field for “Legal Name,” should use \nthe same legal name that appears on the prior year award document, which is also the legal \nname stored in OJP’s financial system. On the SF-424, enter the Legal Name in box 5 and \nEmployer Identification Number (EIN) in box 6 exactly as it appears on the prior year award \ndocument. An applicant with a current, active award(s) must ensure that its GMS profile is \ncurrent. If the profile is not current, the applicant should submit a Grant Adjustment Notice \nupdating the information on its GMS profile prior to applying under this solicitation.  \n \nA new applicant entity should enter the Official Legal Name and address of the applicant \nentity in box 5 and the EIN in box 6 of the SF-424.  \n \nIntergovernmental Review: This solicitation (“funding opportunity”) is within the scope of \nExecutive Order 12372, concerning State opportunities to coordinate applications for federal \nfinancial assistance. See 28 C.F.R. Part 30. An applicant may find the names and \naddresses of State Single Points of Contact (SPOCs) at the following website: \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants spoc/. If the State appears on the SPOC list, the \napplicant must contact the State SPOC to find out about, and comply with, the State’s \nprocess under E.O. 12372. In completing the SF-424, an applicant whose State appears on \nthe SPOC list is to make the appropriate selection in response to question 19 once the \napplicant has complied with its State E.O. 12372 process. (An applicant whose State does \nnot appear on the SPOC list should answer question 19 by selecting the response that the \n“Program is subject to E.O. 12372 but has not been selected by the State for review.”) \n \n2.  Project Abstract  \nApplications should include a high-quality project abstract that summarizes the proposed \nproject in 400 words or less. Project abstracts should be: \n \n•  Written for a general public audience. \n•  Submitted as a separate attachment with “Project Abstract” as part of its file name. \n•  Single-spaced, using a standard 12-point font (Times New Roman) with 1-inch margins. \n•  Include applicant name, title of the project, a brief description of the problem to be \naddressed and the targeted area/population, project goals and objectives, a description \nof the project strategy, any significant partnerships, and anticipated outcomes. \n•  Identify up to 10 project identifiers that would be associated with proposed project \nactivities. The list of identifiers can be found at www.bja.gov/funding/JAGIdentifiers.pdf. \n \n3.  Program Narrative \nThe following sections should be included as part of the program narrative3: \n \na.  Statement of the Problem – Identify the unit of local government’s strategy/funding \npriorities for the FY 2017 JAG funds, the subgrant award process and timeline, and a \n                                                \n3 For information on subawards (including the details on proposed subawards that should be included in the \napplication), see \"Budget and Associated Documentation\" under Section D. Application and Submission Information. \n 16 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 18 of 42   Page ID #:65\ndescription of the programs to be funded over the grant period. Units of local \ngovernment are strongly encouraged to prioritize the funding on evidence-based \nprojects.  \n \nb.  Project Design and Implementation – Describe the unit of local government’s strategic \nplanning process, if any, that guides its priorities and funding strategy. This should \ninclude a description of how the local community is engaged in the planning process and \nthe data and analysis utilized to support the plan; it should identify the stakeholders \ncurrently participating in the strategic planning process, the gaps in the needed \nresources for criminal justice purposes, and how JAG funds will be coordinated with \nState and related justice funds.  \n \nc.  Capabilities and Competencies – Describe any additional strategic planning/coordination \nefforts in which the units of local government participates with other criminal justice \ncriminal/juvenile justice agencies in the State. \n \nd.  Plan for Collecting the Data Required for this Solicitation’s Performance Measures –  \nOJP will require each successful applicant to submit specific performance measures \ndata as part of its reporting under the award (see “General Information about Post-\nFederal Award Reporting Requirements” in Section F. Federal Award Administration \nInformation). The performance measures correlate to the goals, objectives, and \ndeliverables identified under “Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables” in Section A. Program \nDescription. Post award, recipients will be required to submit quarterly performance \nmetrics through BJA’s Performance Measurement Tool (PMT), located at: \nhttps://bjapmt.ojp.gov. The application should describe the applicant's plan for collection \nof all of the performance measures data listed in the JAG Program accountability \nmeasures at: https://bjapmt.ojp.gov/help/jagdocs.html. \n \nBJA does not require applicants to submit performance measures data with their application. \nPerformance measures are included as an alert that BJA will require successful applicants \nto submit specific data as part of their reporting requirements. For the application, applicants \nshould indicate an understanding of these requirements and discuss how they will gather \nthe required data, should they receive funding. \n \nNote on Project Evaluations \nAn applicant that proposes to use award funds through this solicitation to conduct project \nevaluations should be aware that certain project evaluations (such as systematic \ninvestigations designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge) may constitute \n“research” for purposes of applicable DOJ human subjects protection regulations. However, \nproject evaluations that are intended only to generate internal improvements to a program or \nservice, or are conducted only to meet OJP’s performance measure data reporting \nrequirements, likely do not constitute “research.” Each applicant should provide sufficient \ninformation for OJP to determine whether the particular project it proposes would either \nintentionally or unintentionally collect and/or use information in such a way that it meets the \nDOJ regulatory definition of research that appears at 28 C.F.R. Part 46 (“Protection of \nHuman Subjects”). \n \nResearch, for the purposes of human subjects protection for OJP-funded programs, is \ndefined as “a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and \nevaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” 28 C.F.R. \n46.102(d). \n 17 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 19 of 42   Page ID #:66\n \nFor additional information on determining whether a proposed activity would constitute \nresearch for purposes of human subjects protection, applicants should consult the decision \ntree in the “Research and the Protection of Human Subjects” section of the “Requirements \nrelated to Research” web page of the “Overview of Legal Requirements Generally \nApplicable to OJP Grants and Cooperative Agreements - FY 2017” available through the \nOJP Funding Resource Center. Every prospective applicant whose application may propose \na research or statistical component also should review the “Data Privacy and Confidentiality \nRequirements” section on that web page. \n \n4.  Budget and Associated Documentation \n  \n(a) Budget Detail Worksheet  \nA sample Budget Detail Worksheet can be found at \nwww.ojp.gov/funding/Apply/Resources/BudgetDetailWorksheet.pdf. An applicant that \nsubmits its budget in a different format should use the budget categories listed in the \nsample budget worksheet. The Budget Detail Worksheet should break out costs by year. \n \nFor questions pertaining to budget and examples of allowable and unallowable costs, \nsee the DOJ Grants Financial Guide. \n \n(b) Budget Narrative  \nThe Budget Narrative should thoroughly and clearly describe every category of expense \nlisted in the proposed Budget Detail Worksheet. OJP expects proposed budgets to be \ncomplete, cost effective, and allowable (e.g., reasonable, allocable, and necessary for \nproject activities). This narrative should include a full description of all costs, including \nadministrative costs (if applicable).  \n \nAn applicant should demonstrate in its Budget Narrative how it will maximize cost \neffectiveness of award expenditures. Budget narratives should generally describe cost \neffectiveness in relation to potential alternatives and the goals of the project. For \nexample, a budget narrative should detail why planned in-person meetings are \nnecessary, or how technology and collaboration with outside organizations could be \nused to reduce costs, without compromising quality.  \n \nThe Budget Narrative should be mathematically sound and correspond clearly with the \ninformation and figures provided in the Budget Detail Worksheet. The narrative should \nexplain how the applicant estimated and calculated all costs, and how those costs are \nnecessary to the completion of the proposed project. The narrative may include tables \nfor clarification purposes, but need not be in a spreadsheet format. As with the Budget \nDetail Worksheet, the Budget Narrative should describe costs by year. \n \n(c) Information on Proposed Subawards (if any), as well as on Proposed Procurement \nContracts (if any) \nApplicants for OJP awards typically may propose to make “subawards.” Applicants also \nmay propose to enter into procurement “contracts” under the award. \n \nWhether—for purposes of federal grants administrative requirements—a particular \nagreement between a recipient and a third party will be considered a “subaward” or \ninstead considered a procurement “contract” under the award is determined by federal \nrules and applicable OJP guidance. It is an important distinction, in part because the \n 18 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 20 of 42   Page ID #:67\nfederal administrative rules and requirements that apply to “subawards” and \nprocurement “contracts” under awards differ markedly. \n \nIn general, the central question is the relationship between what the third party will do \nunder its agreement with the recipient and what the recipient has committed (to OJP) to \ndo under its award to further a public purpose (e.g., services the recipient will provide, \nproducts it will develop or modify, research or evaluation it will conduct). If a third party \nwill provide some of the services the recipient has committed (to OJP) to provide, will \ndevelop or modify all or part of a product the recipient has committed (to OJP) to \ndevelop or modify, or conduct part of the research or evaluation the recipient has \ncommitted (to OJP) to conduct, OJP will consider the agreement with the third party a \nsubaward for purposes of federal grants administrative requirements.  \n \nThis will be true even if the recipient, for internal or other non-federal purposes, labels or \ntreats its agreement as a procurement, a contract, or a procurement contract. Neither \nthe title nor the structure of an agreement determines whether the agreement—for \npurposes of federal grants administrative requirements—is a “subaward” or is instead a \nprocurement “contract” under an award. \n \nAdditional guidance on the circumstances under which (for purposes of federal grants \nadministrative requirements) an agreement constitutes a subaward as opposed to a \nprocurement contract under an award is available (along with other resources) on the \nOJP Part 200 Uniform Requirements web page. \n \n(1) Information on proposed subawards and required certification regarding 8 \nU.S.C. § 1373 from certain subrecipients \n \nGeneral requirement for federal authorization of any subaward; statutory \nauthorizations of subawards under the JAG Program statute. Generally, a \nrecipient of an OJP award may not make subawards (“subgrants”) unless the \nrecipient has specific federal authorization to do so. Unless an applicable statute or \nDOJ regulation specifically authorizes (or requires) particular subawards, a recipient \nmust have authorization from OJP before it may make a subaward.  \n  \nJAG subawards that are required or specifically authorized by statute (see 42 \nU.S.C. § 3751(a) and 42 U.S.C. § 3755) do not require prior approval to \nauthorize subawards. This includes subawards made by units of local \ngovernment under the JAG Program.  \n \nA particular subaward may be authorized by OJP because the recipient included a \nsufficiently detailed description and justification of the proposed subaward in the \napplication as approved by OJP. If, however, a particular subaward is not authorized \nby federal statute or regulation and is not sufficiently described and justified in the \napplication as approved by OJP, the recipient will be required, post award, to request \nand obtain written authorization from OJP before it may make the subaward. \n \nIf an applicant proposes to make one or more subawards to carry out the federal \naward and program, and those subawards are not specifically authorized (or \nrequired) by statute or regulation, the applicant should: (1) identify (if known) the \nproposed subrecipient(s), (2) describe in detail what each subrecipient will do to \ncarry out the federal award and federal program, and (3) provide a justification for the \n 19 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 21 of 42   Page ID #:68\nsubaward(s), with details on pertinent matters such as special qualifications and \nareas of expertise. Pertinent information on subawards should appear not only in the \nProgram Narrative but also in the Budget Detail Worksheet and budget narrative. \n \nNEW Required certification regarding 8 U.S.C. § 1373 from any proposed \nsubrecipient that is a unit of local government or “public” institution of higher \neducation. Before a unit of local government may subaward FY 2017 award funds to \nanother unit of local government or to a public institution of higher education, it will \nbe required (by award condition) to obtain a properly executed certification regarding \ncompliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 from the proposed subrecipient. (This requirement \nregarding 8 U.S.C. § 1373 will not apply to subawards to Indian tribes). The specific \ncertification the unit of local government must require from another unit of local \ngovernment will vary somewhat from the specific certification it must require from a \npublic institution of higher education. The forms will be posted and available for \ndownload at:  https://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/SampleCertifications-8USC1373.htm.  \n \n(2) Information on proposed procurement contracts (with specific justification \nfor proposed noncompetitive contracts over $150,000) \n \nUnlike a recipient contemplating a subaward, a recipient of an OJP award generally \ndoes not need specific prior federal authorization to enter into an agreement that—\nfor purposes of federal grants administrative requirements—is considered a \nprocurement contract, provided that (1) the recipient uses its own documented \nprocurement procedures and (2) those procedures conform to applicable federal law, \nincluding the Procurement Standards of the (DOJ) Part 200 Uniform Requirements \n(as set out at 2 C.F.R. 200.317 - 200.326). The Budget Detail Worksheet and budget \nnarrative should identify proposed procurement contracts. (As discussed above, \nsubawards must be identified and described separately from procurement contracts.) \n \nThe Procurement Standards in the (DOJ) Part 200 Uniform Requirements, however, \nreflect a general expectation that agreements that (for purposes of federal grants \nadministrative requirements) constitute procurement “contracts” under awards will be \nentered into on the basis of full and open competition. If a proposed procurement \ncontract would exceed the simplified acquisition threshold—currently, $150,000—a \nrecipient of an OJP award may not proceed without competition, unless and until the \nrecipient receives specific advance authorization from OJP to use a non-competitive \napproach for the procurement. \n \nAn applicant that (at the time of its application) intends—without competition—to \nenter into a procurement contract that would exceed $150,000 should include a \ndetailed justification that explains to OJP why, in the particular circumstances, it is \nappropriate to proceed without competition. Various considerations that may be \npertinent to the justification are outlined in the DOJ Grants Financial Guide. \n \n(d) Pre-Agreement Costs \nFor information on pre-agreement costs, see Section B. Federal Award Information. \n \n5.  Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (if applicable) \nIndirect costs may be charged to an award only if: \n \n(a) The recipient has a current (that is, unexpired), federally approved indirect cost rate; or \n 20 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 22 of 42   Page ID #:69\n(b) The recipient is eligible to use, and elects to use, the “de minimis” indirect cost rate \ndescribed in the (DOJ) Part 200 Uniform Requirements, as set out at 2 C.F.R. \n200.414(f). \n \nNote: This rule does not eliminate or alter the JAG-specific restriction in federal law that \ncharges for administrative costs may not exceed 10 percent of the award amount, \nregardless of the approved indirect cost rate. \n \nAn applicant with a current (that is, unexpired) federally approved indirect cost rate is to \nattach a copy of the indirect cost rate agreement to the application. An applicant that does \nnot have a current federally approved rate may request one through its cognizant federal \nagency, which will review all documentation and approve a rate for the applicant entity, or, if \nthe applicant’s accounting system permits, applicants may propose to allocate costs in the \ndirect cost categories. \n \nFor assistance with identifying the appropriate cognizant federal agency for indirect costs, \nplease contact the OCFO Customer Service Center at 1–800–458–0786 or at \nask.ocfo@usdoj.gov. If DOJ is the cognizant federal agency, applicants may obtain \ninformation needed to submit an indirect cost rate proposal at: \nwww.ojp.gov/funding/Apply/Resources/IndirectCosts.pdf. \n \nCertain OJP recipients have the option of electing to use the “de minimis” indirect cost rate. \nAn applicant that is eligible to use the “de minimis” rate that wishes to use the “de minimis” \nrate should attach written documentation to the application that advises OJP of both: (1) the \napplicant’s eligibility to use the “de minimis” rate, and (2) its election to do so. If an eligible \napplicant elects the “de minimis” rate, costs must be consistently charged as either indirect \nor direct costs, but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. The “de \nminimis” rate may no longer be used once an approved federally-negotiated indirect cost \nrate is in place. (No entity that ever has had a federally approved negotiated indirect cost \nrate is eligible to use the “de minimis” rate.)  \n \n6.  Tribal Authorizing Resolution (if applicable)  \nAn applicant that proposes to provide direct services or assistance to residents on tribal \nlands should include in its application a resolution, a letter, affidavit, or other documentation, \nas appropriate, that demonstrates (as a legal matter) that the applicant has the requisite \nauthorization from the tribe(s) to implement the proposed project on tribal lands.  \n \nOJP will not deny an application for an FY 2017 award for failure to submit such tribal \nauthorizing resolution (or other appropriate documentation) by the application deadline, but \na unit of local government will not receive award funds (and its award will include a condition \nthat withholds funds) until it submits the appropriate documentation.  \n \n7.  Financial Management and System of Internal Controls Questionnaire (including \napplicant disclosure of high-risk status) \nEvery unit of local government is to complete the OJP Financial Management and System of \nInternal Controls Questionnaire as part of its application. In accordance with the Part 200 \nUniform Requirements as set out at 2 C.F.R. 200.205, federal agencies must have in place \na framework for evaluating the risks posed by applicants before they receive a federal \naward. \n \n \n 21 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 23 of 42   Page ID #:70\n8.  Applicant Disclosure of High Risk Status  \nApplicants that are currently designated high risk by another federal grant making agency \nmust disclose that status. For purposes of this disclosure, high risk includes any status \nunder which a federal awarding agency provides additional oversight due to the applicant’s \npast performance, or other programmatic or financial concerns with the applicant. If an \napplicant is designated high risk by another federal awarding agency, the applicant must \nprovide the following information:  \n \n•  The federal agency that currently designated the applicant as high risk  \n•  Date the applicant was designated high risk  \n•  The high risk point of contact at that federal awarding agency (name, phone number, \nand email address). \n•  Reasons for the high risk status, as set out by the federal awarding agency \n \nOJP seeks this information to help ensure appropriate federal oversight of OJP awards. An \napplicant that is considered “high risk” by another federal awarding agency is not \nautomatically disqualified from receiving an OJP award. OJP may, however, consider the \ninformation in award decisions, and may impose additional OJP oversight of any award \nunder this solicitation (including through the conditions that accompany the award \ndocument). \n \n9.  Disclosure of Lobbying Activities  \nAn applicant that expends any funds for lobbying activities is to provide all of the information \nrequested on the form Disclosure of Lobbying Activities (SF-LLL). \n \n10. Certifications and Assurances by the Chief Executive of the Applicant Government  \nA JAG application is not complete, and a unit of local government may not receive award \nfunds, unless the chief executive of the applicant unit of local government (e.g., the mayor) \nproperly executes, and the unit of local government submits, the “Certifications and \nAssurances by the Chief Executive of the Applicant Government” attached to this solicitation \nas Appendix I.  \n \nOJP will not deny an application for an FY 2017 award for failure to submit these \n“Certifications and Assurances by the Chief Executive of the Applicant Government” by the \napplication deadline, but a unit of local government will not receive award funds (and its \naward will include a condition that withholds funds) until it submits these certifications and \nassurances, properly executed by the chief executive of the unit of local government (e.g., \nthe mayor). \n \n11. Certification of Compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 by the Chief Legal Officer of the \nApplicant Government  \nThe chief legal officer of an applicant unit of local government (e.g., the General Counsel) is \nto carefully review the “State or Local Government: FY 2017 Certification of Compliance with \n8 U.S.C. § 1373” that is attached as Appendix II to this solicitation. If the chief legal officer \ndetermines that he or she may execute the certification, the unit of local government is to \nsubmit the certification as part of its application. (Note: this requirement does not apply to \nIndian tribal governments.) \n \nAs discussed further below, a unit of local government (other than an Indian tribal \ngovernment) applicant will be unable to make a valid award acceptance of an FY 2017 JAG \n 22 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 24 of 42   Page ID #:71\naward unless and until a properly executed certification by its chief legal officer is received \nby OJP on or before the day the unit of local government submits an executed award \ndocument.  \n \n12. Additional Attachments \n \n(a) Applicant Disclosure of Pending Applications \nEach applicant is to disclose whether it has (or is proposed as a subrecipient under) any \npending applications for federally funded grants or cooperative agreements that (1) \ninclude requests for funding to support the same project being proposed in the \napplication under this solicitation and (2) would cover identical cost items outlined in the \nbudget submitted to OJP as part of the application under this solicitation. The applicant \nis to disclose applications made directly to federal awarding agencies, and also \napplications for subawards of federal funds (e.g., applications to State agencies that will \nsubaward (“subgrant”) federal funds). \n \nOJP seeks this information to help avoid any inappropriate duplication of funding. \nLeveraging multiple funding sources in a complementary manner to implement \ncomprehensive programs or projects is encouraged and is not seen as inappropriate \nduplication. \n \nEach applicant that has one or more pending applications as described above is to \nprovide the following information about pending applications submitted within the last 12 \nmonths: \n \n•  The federal or State funding agency \n•  The solicitation name/project name \n•  The point of contact information at the applicable federal or State funding agency \n \n  Federal or State  Solicitation  Name/Phone/Email for Point of Contact at \n  Funding Agency   Name/Project  Federal or State Funding Agency \nName \nSAMPLE \nDOJ/Office of  COPS Hiring  Jane Doe, 202/000-0000; jane.doe@usdoj.gov \nCommunity  Program \nOriented Policing     \nServices (COPS) \nHealth & Human  Drug-Free  John Doe, 202/000-0000; john.doe@hhs.gov \nServices/  Communities \nSubstance Abuse  Mentoring \nand Mental Health  Program/ North \nServices  County Youth \nAdministration  Mentoring \nProgram \n \nEach applicant should include the table as a separate attachment to its application. The \nfile should be named “Disclosure of Pending Applications.” The applicant Legal Name on \nthe application must match the entity named on the disclosure of pending applications \nstatement. \n \n 23 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 25 of 42   Page ID #:72\nAny applicant that does not have any pending applications as described above is to \nsubmit, as a separate attachment, a statement to this effect: “[Applicant Name on SF-\n424] does not have (and is not proposed as a subrecipient under) any pending \napplications submitted within the last 12 months for federally funded grants or \ncooperative agreements (or for subawards under federal grants or cooperative \nagreements) that request funding to support the same project being proposed in this \napplication to OJP and that would cover identical cost items outlined in the budget \nsubmitted as part of this application.” \n \n(b) Research and Evaluation Independence and Integrity (if applicable) \nIf an application involves research (including research and development) and/or \nevaluation, the applicant must demonstrate research/evaluation independence and \nintegrity, including appropriate safeguards, before it may receive award funds. The \napplicant must demonstrate independence and integrity regarding both this proposed \nresearch and/or evaluation, and any current or prior related projects. \n \nEach application should include an attachment that addresses both i. and ii. below. \n \ni.  For purposes of this solicitation, each applicant is to document research and \nevaluation independence and integrity by including one of the following two \nitems: \n \na.  A specific assurance that the applicant has reviewed its application to \nidentify any actual or potential apparent conflicts of interest (including \nthrough review of pertinent information on the principal investigator, any \nco-principal investigators, and any subrecipients), and that the applicant \nhas identified no such conflicts of interest—whether personal or financial \nor organizational (including on the part of the applicant entity or on the \npart of staff, investigators, or subrecipients)—that could affect the \nindependence or integrity of the research, including the design, conduct, \nand reporting of the research. \n \nOR \n \nb.  A specific description of actual or potential apparent conflicts of interest \nthat the applicant has identified—including through review of pertinent \ninformation on the principal investigator, any co-principal investigators, \nand any subrecipients—that could affect the independence or integrity of \nthe research, including the design, conduct, or reporting of the research. \nThese conflicts may be personal (e.g., on the part of investigators or other \nstaff), financial, or organizational (related to the applicant or any \nsubrecipient entity). Some examples of potential investigator (or other \npersonal) conflict situations are those in which an investigator would be in \na position to evaluate a spouse’s work product (actual conflict), or an \ninvestigator would be in a position to evaluate the work of a former or \ncurrent colleague (potential apparent conflict). With regard to potential \norganizational conflicts of interest, as one example, generally an \norganization would not be given an award to evaluate a project, if that \norganization had itself provided substantial prior technical assistance to \nthat specific project or a location implementing the project (whether \nfunded by OJP or other sources), because the organization in such an \n 24 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 26 of 42   Page ID #:73\ninstance might appear to be evaluating the effectiveness of its own prior \nwork. The key is whether a reasonable person understanding all of the \nfacts would be able to have confidence that the results of any research or \nevaluation project are objective and reliable. Any outside personal or \nfinancial interest that casts doubt on that objectivity and reliability of an \nevaluation or research product is a problem and must be disclosed. \n \nii.  In addition, for purposes of this solicitation, each applicant is to address possible \nmitigation of research integrity concerns by including, at a minimum, one of the \nfollowing two items: \n \na.  If an applicant reasonably believes that no actual or potential apparent \nconflicts of interest (personal, financial, or organizational) exist, then the \napplicant should provide a brief narrative explanation of how and why it \nreached that conclusion. The applicant also is to include an explanation of \nthe specific processes and procedures that the applicant has in place, or \nwill put in place, to identify and prevent (or, at the very least, mitigate) any \nsuch conflicts of interest pertinent to the funded project during the period \nof performance. Documentation that may be helpful in this regard may \ninclude organizational codes of ethics/conduct and policies regarding \norganizational, personal, and financial conflicts of interest. There is no \nguarantee that the plan, if any, will be accepted as proposed. \n \nOR \n \nb.  If the applicant has identified actual or potential apparent conflicts of \ninterest (personal, financial, or organizational) that could affect the \nindependence and integrity of the research, including the design, conduct, \nor reporting of the research, the applicant is to provide a specific and \nrobust mitigation plan to address each of those conflicts. At a minimum, \nthe applicant is expected to explain the specific processes and \nprocedures that the applicant has in place, or will put in place, to identify \nand eliminate (or, at the very least, mitigate) any such conflicts of interest \npertinent to the funded project during the period of performance. \nDocumentation that may be helpful in this regard may include \norganizational codes of ethics/conduct and policies regarding \norganizational, personal, and financial conflicts of interest. There is no \nguarantee that the plan, if any, will be accepted as proposed. \n \nOJP will assess research and evaluation independence and integrity based on \nconsiderations such as the adequacy of the applicant’s efforts to identify factors that \ncould affect the objectivity or integrity of the proposed staff and/or the applicant entity \n(and any subrecipients) in carrying out the research, development, or evaluation activity; \nand the adequacy of the applicant’s existing or proposed remedies to control any such \nfactors. \n \n(c) Local Governing Body Review  \nApplicants must submit information via the Certification and Assurances by the Chief \nExecutive (See Appendix I) which documents that the JAG application was made \navailable for review by the governing body of the unit of local government, or to an \norganization designated by that governing body, for a period that was not less than 30 \n 25 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 27 of 42   Page ID #:74\ndays before the application was submitted to BJA. The same Chief Executive \nCertification will also specify that an opportunity to comment on this application was \nprovided to citizens prior to the application submission to the extent applicable law or \nestablished procedures make such opportunity available. In the past, this has been \naccomplished via submission of specific review dates; now OJP will only accept a chief \nexecutive’s certification to attest to these facts. Units of local government may continue \nto submit actual dates of review should they wish to do so, in addition to the submission \nof the Chief Executive Certification. \n \nHow to Apply \nAn applicant must submit its application through the Grants Management System (GMS), which \nprovides support for the application, award, and management of awards at OJP. Each applicant \nentity must register in GMS for each specific funding opportunity. Although the registration \nand submission deadlines are the same, OJP urges each applicant entity to register promptly, \nespecially if this is the first time the applicant is using the system. Find complete instructions on \nhow to register and submit an application in GMS at www.ojp.gov/gmscbt/. An applicant that \nexperiences technical difficulties during this process should email GMS.HelpDesk@usdoj.gov or \ncall 888–549–9901 (option 3), 24 hours every day, including during federal holidays. OJP \nrecommends that each applicant register promptly to prevent delays in submitting an \napplication package by the deadline. \n \nNote on File Types: GMS does not accept executable file types as application \nattachments. These disallowed file types include, but are not limited to, the following \nextensions: “.com,” “.bat,” “.exe,” “.vbs,” “.cfg,” “.dat,” “.db,” “.dbf,” “.dll,” “.ini,” “.log,” “.ora,” “.sys,” \nand “.zip.”  \n \nEvery applicant entity must comply with all applicable System for Award Management (SAM) \nand unique entity identifier (currently, a Data Universal Numbering System [DUNS] number) \nrequirements. If an applicant entity has not fully complied with applicable SAM and unique \nidentifier requirements by the time OJP makes award decisions, OJP may determine that the \napplicant is not qualified to receive an award and may use that determination as a basis for \nmaking the award to a different applicant. \n \nAll applicants should complete the following steps:  \n \n1.  Acquire a unique entity identifier (DUNS number). In general, the Office of Management \nand Budget requires every applicant for a federal award (other than an individual) to include a \n“unique entity identifier” in each application, including an application for a supplemental award. \nCurrently, a DUNS number is the required unique entity identifier.  \n \nA DUNS number is a unique nine-digit identification number provided by the commercial \ncompany Dun and Bradstreet. This unique entity identifier is used for tracking purposes, and to \nvalidate address and point of contact information for applicants, recipients, and subrecipients. It \nwill be used throughout the life cycle of an OJP award. Obtaining a DUNS number is a free, \none-time activity. Call Dun and Bradstreet at 866–705–5711 to obtain a DUNS number or apply \nonline at www.dnb.com. A DUNS number is usually received within 1–2 business days. \n \n2.  Acquire registration with the SAM. SAM is the repository for certain standard information \nabout federal financial assistance applicants, recipients, and subrecipients. All applicants for \nOJP awards (other than individuals) must maintain current registrations in the SAM database. \n 26 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 28 of 42   Page ID #:75\nEach applicant must update or renew its SAM registration at least annually to maintain an \nactive status. SAM registration and renewal can take as long as 10 business days to complete. \n \nInformation about SAM registration procedures can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov/. \n \n3.  Acquire a GMS username and password. New users must create a GMS profile by \nselecting the “First Time User” link under the sign-in box of the GMS home page. For more \ninformation on how to register in GMS, go to www.ojp.gov/gmscbt. Previously registered \napplicants should ensure, prior to applying, that the user profile information is up-to-date in GMS \n(including, but not limited to, address, legal name of agency and authorized representative) as \nthis information is populated in any new application. \n \n4.  Verify the SAM (formerly CCR) registration in GMS. OJP requires each applicant to verify \nits SAM registration in GMS. Once logged into GMS, click the “CCR Claim” link on the left side \nof the default screen. Click the submit button to verify the SAM (formerly CCR) registration. \n \n5.  Search for the funding opportunity on GMS. After logging into GMS or completing the \nGMS profile for username and password, go to the “Funding Opportunities” link on the left side \nof the page. Select BJA and FY 17 Edward Byrne Memorial Local Justice Assistance Grant \n(JAG) Program.  \n \n6.  Register by selecting the “Apply Online” button associated with the funding \nopportunity title. The search results from step 5 will display the “funding opportunity” \n(solicitation) title along with the registration and application deadlines for this solicitation. Select \nthe “Apply Online” button in the “Action” column to register for this solicitation and create an \napplication in the system. \n \n7.  Follow the directions in GMS to submit an application consistent with this \nsolicitation. Once the application is submitted, GMS will display a confirmation screen stating \nthe submission was successful. Important: In some instances, applicants must wait for GMS \napproval before submitting an application. OJP urges each applicant to submit its application at \nleast 72 hours prior to the application due date. \n \nNote: Application Versions \nIf an applicant submits multiple versions of the same application, OJP will review only the most \nrecent system-validated version submitted.  \n \nExperiencing Unforeseen GMS Technical Issues \nAn applicant that experiences unforeseen GMS technical issues beyond its control that prevent \nit from submitting its application by the deadline may contact the GMS Help Desk or the SAM \nHelp Desk (Federal Service Desk) to report the technical issue and receive a tracking number. \nThe applicant is expected to email the NCJRS Response Center identified in the Contact \nInformation section on the title page within 24 hours after the application deadline to request \napproval to submit its application after the deadline. The applicant’s email must describe the \ntechnical difficulties, and must include a timeline of the applicant’s submission efforts, the \ncomplete grant application, the applicant’s DUNS number, and any GMS Help Desk or SAM \ntracking number(s). \n \nNote: OJP does not automatically approve requests to submit a late application. After \nOJP reviews the applicant’s request, and contacts the GMS Help Desk to verify the reported \ntechnical issues, OJP will inform the applicant whether the request to submit a late application \n 27 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 29 of 42   Page ID #:76\nhas been approved or denied. If OJP determines that the untimely application submission was \ndue to the applicant’s failure to follow all required procedures, OJP will deny the applicant’s \nrequest to submit its application. \n \nThe following conditions generally are insufficient to justify late submissions to OJP solicitations: \n \n•  Failure to register in SAM or GMS in sufficient time (SAM registration and renewal can \ntake as long as 10 business days to complete.) \n•  Failure to follow GMS instructions on how to register and apply as posted on the GMS \nwebsite \n•  Failure to follow each instruction in the OJP solicitation \n•  Technical issues with the applicant’s computer or information technology environment \nsuch as issues with firewalls \n \n \nE. Application Review Information \n \nReview Process \nOJP is committed to ensuring a fair and open process for making awards. BJA reviews the \napplication to make sure that the information presented is reasonable, understandable, \nmeasurable, and achievable, as well as consistent with the solicitation. BJA will also review \napplications to help ensure that JAG program-statute requirements have been met.   \nPursuant to the (DOJ) Part 200 Uniform Requirements, before awards are made, OJP also \nreviews information related to the degree of risk posed by applicants. Among other things, to \nhelp assess whether an applicant that has one or more prior federal awards has a satisfactory \nrecord with respect to performance, integrity, and business ethics, OJP checks whether the \napplicant is listed in SAM as excluded from receiving a federal award. In addition, if OJP \nanticipates that an award will exceed $150,000 in federal funds, OJP also must review and \nconsider any information about the applicant that appears in the non-public segment of the \nintegrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently, the Federal Awardee \nPerformance and Integrity Information System; “FAPIIS”). \nImportant note on FAPIIS: An applicant, at its option, may review and comment on any \ninformation about itself that currently appears in FAPIIS and was entered by a federal awarding \nagency. OJP will consider any such comments by the applicant, in addition to the other \ninformation in FAPIIS, in its assessment of the risk posed by the applicant.  \n \nThe evaluation of risks goes beyond information in SAM, however. OJP itself has in place a \nframework for evaluating risks posed by applicants. OJP takes into account information \npertinent to matters such as— \n1.  Applicant financial stability and fiscal integrity \n2.  Quality of the management systems of the applicant, and the applicant’s ability to meet \nprescribed management standards, including those outlined in the DOJ Grants Financial \nGuide \n3.  Applicant’s history of performance under OJP and other DOJ awards (including \ncompliance with reporting requirements and award conditions), as well as awards from \nother federal agencies \n 28 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 30 of 42   Page ID #:77\n4.  Reports and findings from audits of the applicant, including audits under the (DOJ) Part \n200 Uniform Requirements \n5.  Applicant's ability to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements, and to effectively \nimplement other award requirements \nAbsent explicit statutory authorization or written delegation of authority to the contrary, the \nAssistant Attorney General will make all final award decisions. \n \nF. Federal Award Administration Information \n \nFederal Award Notices \nOJP expects to issue award notifications by September 30, 2017. OJP sends award \nnotifications by email through GMS to the individuals listed in the application as the point of \ncontact and the authorizing official. The email notification includes detailed instructions on how \nto access and view the award documents, and steps to take in GMS to start the award \nacceptance process. GMS automatically issues the notifications at 9:00 p.m. eastern time on \nthe award date. \n \nNOTE: In order validly to accept an award under the FY 2017 JAG Program, a unit of local \ngovernment (other than an Indian tribal government) must submit to GMS the certification by its \nchief legal officer regarding compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, executed using the form that \nappears in Appendix II. (The form also may be downloaded at \nhttps://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/SampleCertifications-8USC1373.htm.) Unless the executed \ncertification either (1) is submitted to OJP together with the signed award document or (2) is \nuploaded in GMS no later than the day the signed award document is submitted, OJP will \nreject as invalid any submission by a unit of local government (other than an Indian tribal \ngovernment) that purports to accept an award under this solicitation.  \n \nRejection of an initial submission as an invalid award acceptance is not a denial of the award. \nConsistent with award requirements, once the unit of local government does submit the \nnecessary certification regarding 8 U.S.C. § 1373, the unit of local government will be permitted \nto submit an award document executed by the unit of local government on or after the date of \nthat certification.  \n \nAlso, in order for a unit of local government applicant validly to accept an award under the FY \n2017 JAG Program, an individual with the necessary authority to bind the applicant will be \nrequired to log in; execute a set of legal certifications and a set of legal assurances; designate a \nfinancial point of contact; thoroughly review the award, including all award conditions; and sign \nand accept the award. The award acceptance process requires physical signature of the award \ndocument by the authorized representative and the scanning of the fully executed award \ndocument (along with the required certification regarding 8 U.S.C. § 1373, if not already \nuploaded in GMS) to OJP. \n \nStatutory and Regulatory Requirements; Award Conditions  \nIf selected for funding, in addition to implementing the funded project consistent with the OJP-\napproved application, the recipient must comply with all award requirements (including all award \nconditions), as well as all applicable requirements of federal statutes and regulations (including \nthose referred to in assurances and certifications executed as part of the application or in \n 29 \n \n                                      BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 31 of 42   Page ID #:78\nconnection with award acceptance, and administrative and policy requirements set by statute or \nregulation).  \nOJP strongly encourages prospective applicants to review information on post-award legal \nrequirements generally applicable to FY 2017 OJP awards and common OJP award conditions \nprior to submitting an application. \nApplicants should consult the “Overview of Legal Requirements Generally Applicable to OJP \nGrants and Cooperative Agreements - FY 2017 Awards,” available in the OJP Funding \nResource Center. In addition, applicants should examine the following two legal documents, as \neach successful applicant must execute both documents in GMS before it may receive any \naward funds. \n• Certifications Regarding Lobbying; Debarment, Suspension and Other Responsibility \nMatters; and Drug-Free Workplace Requirements\n• OJP Certified Standard Assurances (attached to this solicitation as Appendix IV) \nThe web pages accessible through the “Overview of Legal Requirements Generally Applicable \nto OJP Grants and Cooperative Agreements - FY 2017 Awards” are intended to give applicants \nfor OJP awards a general overview of important statutes, regulations, and award conditions that \napply to many (or in some cases, all) OJP grants and cooperative agreements awarded in FY \n2017. Individual OJP awards typically also will include additional award conditions. Those \nadditional conditions may relate to the particular statute, program, or solicitation under which the \naward is made; to the substance of the funded application; to the recipient's performance under \nother federal awards; to the recipient's legal status (e.g., as a for-profit entity); or to other \npertinent considerations. \nIndividual FY 2017 JAG awards will include two new express conditions that, with respect to the \n“program or activity” that would be funded by the FY 2017 award, are designed to ensure that \nStates and units of local government that receive funds from the FY 2017 JAG award: (1) permit \npersonnel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to access any correctional or \ndetention facility in order to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and \ninquire as to his or her right to be or remain in the United States and (2) provide at least 48 \nhours’ advance notice to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the \njurisdiction’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien \npursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nCompliance with the requirements of the two foregoing new award conditions will be an \nauthorized and priority purpose of the award. The reasonable costs (to the extent not \nreimbursed under any other federal program) of developing and putting into place statutes, \nrules, regulations, policies, or practices as required by these conditions, and to honor any duly \nauthorized requests from DHS that is encompassed by these conditions, will be allowable costs \nunder the award. \nGeneral Information about Post-Federal Award Reporting Requirements \nA unit of local government recipient of an award under this solicitation will be required to submit \nthe following reports and data: \n 30 \n BJA-2017-11301 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-3   Filed 09/29/17   Page 32 of 42   Page ID #:79\nRequired reports. Recipients typically must submit quarterly financial status reports, semi-\nannual progress reports, final financial and progress reports, and, if applicable, an annual \naudit report in accordance with the (DOJ) Part 200 Uniform Requirements or specific award \nconditions. Future awards and fund drawdowns may be withheld if reports are delinquent. \n(In appropriate cases, OJP may require additional reports.) \nAwards that exceed $500,000 will include an additional condition that, under specific \ncircumstances, will require the recipient to report (to FAPIIS) information on civil, criminal, \nand administrative proceedings connected with (or connected to the performance of) either \nthe OJP award or any other grant, cooperative agreement, or procurement contract from the \nfederal government. Additional information on this reporting requirement appears in the text \nof the award condition posted on the OJP website at: https://ojp.gov/funding/FAPIIS.htm \nData on performance measures. In addition to required reports, each recipient of an award \nunder this solicitation also must provide data that measure the results of the work done \nunder the award. To demonstrate program progress and success, as well as to assist DOJ \nwith fulfilling its responsibilities under GPRA and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, OJP \nwill require State recipients to provide accountability metrics data. Accountability metrics \ndata must be submitted through BJA’s Performance Measurement Tool (PMT), available at \nhttps://bjapmt.ojp.gov. The accountability measures are available at: \nhttps://bjapmt.ojp.gov/help/jagdocs.html. (Note that if a law enforcement agency receives \nJAG funds from a State, the State must submit quarterly accountability metrics data related \nto training that officers have received on use of force, racial and ethnic bias, de-escalation of \nconflict, and constructive engagement with the public.)  \nOJP may restrict access to award funds if a recipient of an OJP award fails to report \nrequired performance measures data in a timely manner. \nG. Federal Awarding Agency Contact(s)\nFor OJP contact(s), see the title page of this solicitation. \nFor contact information for GMS, see the title page. \nH. Other Information\nFreedom of Information Act and Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552 and 5 U.S.C. § 552a) \nAll applications submitted to OJP (including all attachments to applications) are subject to the \nfederal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and to the Privacy Act. By law, DOJ may withhold \ninformation that is responsive to a request pursuant to FOIA if DOJ determines that the \nresponsive information either is protected under the Privacy Act or falls within the scope of one \nof nine statutory exemptions under FOIA. DOJ cannot agree in advance of a request pursuant \nto FOIA not to release some or all portions of an application. \nIn its review of records that are responsive to a FOIA request, OJP will withhold information in \nthose records that plainly falls within the scope of the Privacy Act or one of the statutory \nexemptions under FOIA.

(A withholding condition is a condition in the award document that \nprecludes the recipient from obligating, expending, or drawing down all or a portion of the award funds until the \ncondition is removed.)\nExcept to the extent (if any) that an award condition expressly precludes reimbursement of project costs incurred \"at-\nrisk,\" if and when the recipient makes a valid acceptance of this award and OJP removes each applicable withholding \ncondition through a Grant Adjustment Notice, the recipient is authorized to obligate (federal) award funds to reimburse \nitself for project costs incurred \"at-risk\" earlier during the period of performance (such as project costs incurred prior to\naward acceptance or prior to removal of an applicable withholding condition), provided that those project costs \notherwise are allowable costs under the award.\nNothing in this condition shall be understood to authorize the recipient (or any subrecipient at any tier) to use award \nfunds to \"supplant\" State or local funds in violation of the recipient's certification (executed by the chief executive of \nthe State or local government) that federal funds will be used to increase the amounts of such funds that would, in the \nabsence of federal funds, be made available for law enforcement activities.\n52. \"Certification of Compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373\" required for valid award acceptance by a unit of local government\nIn order validly to accept this award, the applicant local government must submit the required \"Certification of \nCompliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373\" (executed by the chief legal officer of the local government).  Unless that executed \ncertification either-- (1) is submitted to OJP together with the fully-executed award document, or (2) is uploaded in \nOJP's GMS no later than the day the signed award document is submitted to OJP, any submission by a unit of local \ngovernment that purports to accept the award is invalid. \nIf an initial award-acceptance submission by the recipient is invalid, once the unit of local government does submit the \nnecessary certification regarding 8 U.S.C. 1373, it may submit a fully-executed award document executed by the unit \nof local government on or after the date of that certification.\nFor purposes of this condition, \"local government\" does not include any Indian tribes.\nOJP FORM 4000/2 (REV 4-88)\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-4   Filed 09/29/17   Page 17 of 21   Page ID #:106\nU.S. Department of Justice\nOffice of Justice Programs AWARD CONTINUATION\nBureau of Justice Assistance SHEET PAGE 16 OF 20\nGrant\nPROJECT NUMBER 2017-DJ-BX-0002 AWARD DATE 08/23/2017\nSPECIAL CONDITIONS\n53. Ongoing compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373 is required\n1. With respect to the \"program or activity\" funded in whole or part under this award (including any such \"program or \nactivity\" of any subrecipient at any tier), throughout the period of performance for the award, no State or local \ngovernment entity, -agency, or -official may prohibit or in any way restrict-- (1) any government entity or -official \nfrom sending or receiving information regarding citizenship or immigration status as described in 8 U.S.C. 1373(a); or \n(2) a government entity or -agency from sending, requesting or receiving, maintaining, or exchanging information \nregarding immigration status as described in 8 U.S.C. 1373(b).  For purposes of this award, any prohibition (or \nrestriction) that violates this condition is an \"information-communication restriction.\"\n2. Certifications from subrecipients.  The recipient may not make a subaward to a State or local government or a \n\"public\" institution of higher education, unless it first obtains a certification of compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373, properly\nexecuted by the chief legal officer of the jurisdiction or institution that would receive the subaward, using the \nappropriate form available at https://ojp.gov/funding/Explore/SampleCertifications-8USC1373htm.  Similarly, the \nrecipient must require that no subrecipient (at any tier) may make a further subaward to a State or local government or a\n\"public\" institution of higher education, unless it first obtains a certification of compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373, properly\nexecuted by the chief legal officer of the jurisdiction or institution that would receive the further subaward, using the \nappropriate OJP form.\n3. The recipient's monitoring responsibilities include monitoring of subrecipient compliance with the requirements of \nthis condition.\n4. Allowable costs.  Compliance with these requirements is an authorized and priority purpose of this award.  To the \nextent that such costs are not reimbursed under any other federal program, award funds may be obligated (including for\nauthorized reimbursements) for the reasonable, necessary, and allocable costs (if any) that the recipient, or any \nsubrecipient at any tier that is a State or local government or a \"public\" institution of higher education, incurs to \nimplement this condition.\n5. Rules of Construction\nA. For purposes of this condition:\n(1) \"State\" and \"local government\" include any agency or other entity thereof, but not any institution of higher \neducation or any Indian tribe.\n(2) A \"public\" institution of higher education is one that is owned, controlled, or directly funded by a State or local \ngovernment.\n(3) \"Program or activity\" means what it means under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (see 42 U.S.C. 2000d-4a).\n(4) \"Immigration status\" means what it means for purposes of 8 U.S.C. 1373 (Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996); and terms that are defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101 (Immigration and Nationality Act) \nmean what they mean under that section 1101, except that the term \"State\" also shall include American Samoa (cf. 42 \nU.S.C. 901(a)(2)).\n(5) Pursuant to the provisions set out at (or referenced in) 8 U.S.C. 1551 note (\"Abolition … and Transfer of \nFunctions\"), references to the \"Immigration and Naturalization Service\" in 8 U.S.C. 1373 are to be read as references to\nparticular components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\nB. Nothing in this condition shall be understood to authorize or require any recipient, any subrecipient at any tier, any \nState or local government, any \"public\" institution of higher education, or any other entity (or individual) to violate any \nfederal law, including any applicable civil rights or nondiscrimination law.\nOJP FORM 4000/2 (REV 4-88)\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-4   Filed 09/29/17   Page 18 of 21   Page ID #:107\nU.S. Department of Justice\nOffice of Justice Programs AWARD CONTINUATION\nBureau of Justice Assistance SHEET PAGE 17 OF 20\nGrant\nPROJECT NUMBER 2017-DJ-BX-0002 AWARD DATE 08/23/2017\nSPECIAL CONDITIONS\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  Any questions about the meaning or scope of this condition should be directed to OJP, before \naward acceptance.\n54. Authority to obligate award funds contingent on compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373; unallowable costs; obligation to notify\n1.  If the recipient is a State or local government--\nA.  The recipient may not obligate award funds if, at the time of the obligation, the \"program or activity\" of the \nrecipient (or of any subrecipient at any tier that is a either a State or unit of local government or a \"public\" institution of\nhigher education) that is funded in whole or in part with award funds is subject to any \"information-communication \nrestriction.\"\nB.  In addition, with respect to any project costs it incurs \"at risk,\" the recipient may not obligate award funds to \nreimburse itself if -- at the time it incurs such costs -- the \"program or activity\" of the recipient (or of any \nsubrecipient at any tier that is a either a State or unit of local government or a \"public\" institution of higher education) \nthat would be reimbursed in whole or in part with award funds was subject to any \"information-communication \nrestriction.\"\nC.  Any drawdown of award funds by the recipient shall be considered, for all purposes, to be a material representation \nby the recipient to OJP that, as of the date the recipient requests the drawdown, the recipient and all subrecipients \n(regardless of tier) are in compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373.\nD.  The recipient must promptly notify OJP (in writing) if the recipient, from its requisite monitoring of compliance \nwith award conditions or otherwise, has credible evidence that indicates that the funded \"program or activity\" of the \nrecipient, or of any subrecipient at any tier that is either a State or a local government or a \"public\" institution of higher \neducation, may be subject to any \"information-communication restriction.\" In addition, any subaward (at any tier) to a \nsubrecipient that is either a State or a local government or a \"public\" institution of higher education must require \nprompt notification to the entity that made the subaward, should the subrecipient such credible evidence regarding an \n\"information-communication restriction.\"\n2.  Any subaward (at any tier) to a subrecipient that is either a State or a local government or a \"public\" institution of \nhigher education must provide that the subrecipient may not obligate award funds if, at the time of the obligation, the \n\"program or activity\" of the subrecipient (or of any further such subrecipient at any tier) that is funded in whole or in \npart with award funds is subject to any \"information-communication restriction.\"\n3.  Absent an express written determination by DOJ to the contrary, based upon a finding by DOJ of compelling \ncircumstances (e.g., a small amount of award funds obligated by the recipient at the time of a subrecipient's minor and \ntransitory non-compliance, which was unknown to the recipient despite diligent monitoring), any obligations of award \nfunds that, under this condition, may not be made shall be unallowable costs for purposes of this award.  In making any \nsuch determination, DOJ will give great weight to evidence submitted by the recipient that demonstrates diligent \nmonitoring of subrecipient compliance with the requirements set out in the award condition entitled \"Ongoing \ncompliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373 is required.\"\n4.  Rules of Construction\nA.  For purposes of this condition \"information-communication restriction\" has the meaning set out in the award \ncondition entitled \"Ongoing compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373 is required.\"\nB.

Required State-level rules or practices related to aliens; allowable costs\nThe following provisions apply to the recipient of this award, if the recipient is a State government, and also apply to \nany State-government subrecipient at any tier (whether or not the recipient is a State government).\n1. Requirements\nWith respect to the \"program or activity\" that is funded (in whole or in part) by this award, as of the date the recipient \naccepts this award, and throughout the remainder of the period of performance for the award--\nA. A State statute, or a State rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice, must be in place that is designed to ensure that \nagents of the United States acting under color of federal law in fact are given to access any State (or State-contracted) \ncorrectional facility for the purpose of permitting such agents to meet with individuals who are (or are believed by such\nagents to be) aliens and to inquire as to such individuals' right to be or remain in the United States.\nB. A State statute, or a State rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice, must be in place that is designed to ensure that, \nwhen a State (or State-contracted) correctional facility receives from DHS a formal written request authorized by the \nImmigration and Nationality Act that seeks advance notice of the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien \nin such facility, then such facility will honor such request and -- as early as practicable (see para. 4.B. of this \ncondition) -- provide the requested notice to DHS.\n2. Monitoring\nThe recipient's monitoring responsibilities include monitoring of subrecipient compliance with the requirements of this \ncondition.\n3. Allowable costs\nCompliance with these requirements is an authorized and priority purpose of this award. To the extent that such costs \nare not reimbursed under any other federal program, award funds may be obligated (including for authorized \nreimbursements) for the reasonable, necessary, and allocable costs (if any) of-- (1) developing and putting into place \nstatutes, rules, regulations, policies, and practices to satisfy this condition, and (2) permitting access as described in \npara. 1.A. above, and (3) honoring any request from DHS that is encompassed by para. 1.B. above.\n4. Rules of construction\nA. For purposes of this condition--\n(1) the term \"alien\" means what it means under section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (see 8 U.S.C. \n1101(a)(3)).\n(2) the term \"correctional facility\" means what it means under the Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 (see 42 U.S.C. 3791(a)(7)).\nB. Nothing in this condition shall be understood to authorize or require any recipient, any subrecipient at any tier, any \nState or local government, or any other entity or individual to maintain (or detain) any individual in custody beyond the\ndate and time the individual would have been released in the absence of this condition.\nCurrent DHS practice is ordinarily to request advance notice of scheduled release \"as early as practicable (at least 48 \nhours, if possible).\" (See DHS Form I-247A (3/17)). In the event that (e.g., in light of the date DHS made such request)\nthe scheduled release date and time for an alien are such as not to permit the advance notice that DHS has requested, it \nshall not be a violation of this condition to provide only as much advance notice as practicable.\nOJP FORM 4000/2 (REV 4-88)\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-4   Filed 09/29/17   Page 20 of 21   Page ID #:109\nU.S. Department of Justice\nOffice of Justice Programs AWARD CONTINUATION\nBureau of Justice Assistance SHEET PAGE 19 OF 20\nGrant\nPROJECT NUMBER 2017-DJ-BX-0002 AWARD DATE 08/23/2017\nSPECIAL CONDITIONS\nNOTE: Current DHS practice is to use one form (DHS Form I-247A (3/17)) for two distinct purposes -- to request \nadvance notice of scheduled release, and to request that an individual be detained for up to 48 hours AFTER the \nscheduled release. This condition imposes NO requirements as to such DHS requests for detention.\nC. Both the \"Rules of Construction\" and the \"Important Note\" set out in the award condition entitled \"Ongoing \ncompliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373 is required\" are incorporated by reference as though set forth here in full.\n56.

Requirements \nWith respect to the \"program or activity\" that is funded (in whole or in part) by this award, as of the date the recipient \naccepts this award, and throughout the remainder of the period of performance for the award--\nA.  A local ordinance, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice (or an applicable State statute, -rule, -regulation, -\npolicy, or -practice) must be in place that is designed to ensure that agents of the United States acting under color of \nfederal law in fact are given access a local-government (or local-government-contracted) correctional facility for the \npurpose of permitting such agents to meet with individuals who are (or are believed by such agents to be) aliens and to \ninquire as to such individuals' right to be or remain in the United States.\nB.  A local ordinance, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice (or an applicable State statute, -rule, -regulation, -\npolicy, or -practice) must be in place that is designed to ensure that, when a local-government (or local-government-\ncontracted) correctional facility receives from DHS a formal written request authorized by the Immigration and \nNationality Act that seeks advance notice of the scheduled release date and time for a particular alien in such facility, \nthen such facility will honor such request and -- as early as practicable (see \"Rules of Construction\" incorporated by \npara. 4.B. of this condition) -- provide the requested notice to DHS.\n2.

The CLEAR Program began \nin 1997 as an innovative City/County partnership to combat gang violence in Los Angeles by \nvertically-integrating a system of neighborhood policing and gang prosecution.  \n \nThe primary purpose of CLEAR is to facilitate the recovery of targeted gang-infested \ncommunities through collaboration between criminal justice agencies including the Los Angeles \nPolice Department (LAPD), Los Angeles County Probation Department, Los Angeles City \nAttorney, Los Angeles County District Attorney, California Department of Corrections, and Los \nAngeles Mayor’s Office.  Through Community Impact Teams, CLEAR engages residents of \neach CLEAR site integrating resident input to improve quality of life issues.  \n \nThere are currently 9 CLEAR sites, located in the following LAPD divisions: Northeast, \nNewton, Southeast, Foothill, Southwest, Hollenbeck/Boyle Heights, Hollenbeck/Ramona \nGardens, Rampart, and 77th.  Each CLEAR site is assigned a Deputy City Attorney, a Deputy \nDistrict Attorney, and Probation Officer, in addition to 1 Detective, 1 Sergeant, and 8 Police \nOfficers.  \n \nProject Identifiers: \n  Gangs \n  Violence-Violent Crime \n  Community Prosecution \n \nAttachment 2   1 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 21 of 66   Page ID #:131\nCity of Los Angeles    FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant  \nProgram Narrative – Attachment 3 \n \nCommunity Law Enforcement and Recovery (CLEAR) Program \n \nThe Community Law Enforcement and Recovery (CLEAR) Program began in 1997 as an \ninnovative City of Los Angeles/Los Angeles County partnership to combat gang violence in Los \nAngeles.  The  primary  purpose  of  CLEAR  is  to  facilitate  the  recovery  of  gang-infested \ncommunities.  This is accomplished by decreasing gang crime in targeted communities through an \neffective, cross-agency collaboration with City and County criminal justice agencies.  The CLEAR \nteam includes the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), Los Angeles County Probation \nDepartment, Los Angeles City Attorney, Los Angeles County District Attorney, and the California \nDepartment of Corrections.  The City of Los Angeles will dedicate 100% of its FY 2017 Justice \nAssistance Grant allocation to support the CLEAR program. \nCLEAR has had a verifiable impact in decreasing gang crime and on maintaining lower \nlevels of gang crime.  Until 2014, the City of Los Angeles had experienced 12 years of continuous \ndeclines in crime, with crime in CLEAR sites experiencing larger declines than the rest of the City.  \nIn 2015, the City of Los Angeles, along with many other cities nationally, began experiencing an \nuptick in crime.  In 2016, Citywide, Total Violent Crime increased 10.2% with Total Part I Crime \nincreasing 5.5%.  Citywide Homicide increased by 13.1%. In that same year however, total \nHomicides in the primary and secondary reporting districts of the CLEAR sites decreased by 22%.1  \nDespite the overall crime increases experienced City-wide, the continued success of the CLEAR \nmodel has resulted in significantly smaller increases in violent and gang-related crimes.    \nCommunity members have also been meaningfully engaged in the process of community \nrecovery.  These members, along with government agencies (both within and outside the criminal \n                                                 \n1 Los Angeles Police Department  \nAttachment 3  1 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 22 of 66   Page ID #:132\nCity of Los Angeles    FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant  \njustice system), have created innovative mechanisms to collaborate amongst themselves and with \nthese communities.  Furthermore, monthly activity reports are created to assist each site with \nmonitoring and revising plans and strategies.   \nCLEAR Partners \nThe key to CLEAR’s success has been the immediate availability of police officers, District \nAttorneys, City Attorneys, and Probation and Parole Officers in the defined primary and secondary \ntarget areas.  The role of each team member is outlined below: \n• The Los Angeles Police Department deploys officers who are designated to respond to \ngang-related criminal activity within their respective CLEAR target area, and coordinates \nlaw enforcement efforts to suppress gang crime. \n• The California Department of Corrections monitors and closely supervises all parolees \nduring their re-entry into society to avert them from engaging in criminal activity upon \ntheir release. \n•  The Los Angeles County Probation Department works with the City Attorney to \nensure  that  gang  members  receive  appropriate  conditions  of  probation  that  prohibit \nassociation with other gang members, through curfews and restrictions on returning to \ndesignated areas. \n• The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office and City Attorney’s Office \nvertically prosecute the most difficult cases generated by CLEAR unit arrests using novel \nand innovative prosecution strategies that may include granting cross-designation status to \ncity prosecutors, so that cases can be effectively pursued in superior court. They also track \nall arrests made by the CLEAR unit and prepare reports on the progress of the prosecution \nefforts, from the point of arrest through the final court disposition of each case, including \nthe length of imprisonment or the terms of probation ordered, and prepare and prosecute \nAttachment 3  2 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 23 of 66   Page ID #:133\nCity of Los Angeles    FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant  \ncivil injunctions against gang member activities within the CLEAR sites. CLEAR team \nmembers also collaborate with residents within each CLEAR site through the creation of a \nCommunity Impact Team (CIT).   The CIT’s focus is specifically on quality of life issues \nsuch as graffiti, litter and juvenile loitering.  The CIT also facilitates a linkage between \nCLEAR’s  suppression  efforts  and  other  gang  prevention  and  intervention  programs.  \nCommunity members on the CITs identify effective community organizations in their area \nand facilitate a relationship between those organizations and law enforcement agencies, \nwhich partner to secure support from individuals and businesses within the community. \n \nSelection of CLEAR Sites \nAreas with high rates of gang-related crime are generally selected as CLEAR sites.  Within \neach site, there is a primary target area and a secondary target area, identified by LAPD Reporting \nDistricts, which track all LAPD crime data.  Primary target areas are comprised of those reporting \ndistricts with the most gang activity in the CLEAR site area.  Secondary target areas are comprised \nof those reporting districts with a high level of gang activity, but at lower levels than in the primary \ntarget areas.  Program resources are deployed first to the primary target areas and then to secondary \ntarget areas.  This approach ensures that resources are efficiently deployed to areas with the most \ngang-related crime. \n \nGoals, Objectives and Evaluation \nThe goal of the CLEAR program is to reduce the propagation of gangs, gang \nmembership, and gang-related criminal activity.  An independent evaluation of the effectiveness \nof the CLEAR program is prepared and submitted to the CLEAR Executive Board on an annual \nbasis.  The Executive Board chooses the entity that will conduct the evaluation through a \nAttachment 3  3 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 24 of 66   Page ID #:134\nCity of Los Angeles    FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant  \ncompetitive bidding process after sending out requests for proposals.  The evaluation includes a \ndescription of the extent to which the project has accomplished the following: \n  a)  A decrease in gang crime in each CLEAR site; \n  b)  A decrease in violent gang crime in each CLEAR site; and  \nc)  The prosecution of those arrested for gang-related crimes in the CLEAR sites. \nIn addition, the CLEAR program will utilize the following performance measures consistent with \nBureau of Justice Assistance Grant Program: \na)  Percent change in number of individuals arrested in a targeted group by crime type; \nb)  Expected change in arrests; \nc)  Percent change in reported crime rates in a community by crime type; and \nd)  Expected change in crime rates. \nAn evaluation consultant will provide ongoing monthly, quarterly, and annual reports that \ncontain comparative data analysis on crime reduction in the CLEAR sites. Details of the \nevaluation process include: \n  Site Activity Statistics: On a monthly basis, collect data reflecting site activities.  Provide \nlaw enforcement with access to an electronic web-based system to input collected data.  \nInclude numbers of arrests, prosecutions, and other related activities. \n  On a quarterly basis, obtain and analyze gang crime data for all CLEAR sites using a \nstatistical model approved by the CLEAR Executive Board.  Compare site gang crime \nstatistics to division-wide gang crime statistics.   \n  Create and distribute four semi-annual reports to be presented to the Board that will \ninclude the following content in one or more of the four reports: \nAttachment 3  4 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 25 of 66   Page ID #:135\nCity of Los Angeles    FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant  \no  An implementation study that details how the program was implemented across \nall sites during the contract period, citing any challenges and successes as well as \nmaking recommendations for the future; \no  Document all pertinent changes that occurred during the contract period, \nincluding but not limited to Reporting Districts, staff turnover, analysis of which \nsites have the greatest change in gang-related crime, etc.; \no  A comprehensive overview that details CLEAR operations and outcomes in a \nhistorical, cross-site context; and \no  An analysis of CLEAR’s impact on each community including feedback from \ncommunity members. \nProject Implementation \n Funding from the JAG 17 award will be utilized for the salaries for nine City Attorneys, \nDistrict Attorneys, and Probation Officers at each of the following CLEAR sites: \n  District  Probation \n \nCLEAR site  City Attorney  Attorney  Officer \nNortheast  X  X  X \n \nNewton  X  X  X \nSoutheast  X  X  X \n \nFoothill  X  X  X \nSouthwest  X  X  X \n \nBoyle Heights  X  X  X \nRamona Gardens  X  X  X \n \nRampart  X  X  X \n77th  X  X  X \n \nFunding will ensure that program activities are not interrupted and that all staff can \ncontinue to dedicate their time to their roles within the CLEAR team.  Funding will cover CLEAR \nstaffing and grant administration for the entirety of the grant term, through September 30, 2020.  \nAs the fiscal agent for this grant, the Los Angeles Mayor’s Office of Public Safety will obtain all \nAttachment 3  5 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 26 of 66   Page ID #:136\nCity of Los Angeles    FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant  \nnecessary internal approvals to expend the grant and enter into formal agreements with the partner \nagencies.  The operational teams in the CLEAR sites will continue to implement the specific \nCLEAR strategy for the identified area and continue coordination of services with the office of \nGang Reduction and Youth Development (GRYD).  The CLEAR Executive Committee will \ncontinue to oversee and monitor CLEAR activities in the target areas. CLEAR activities will be \nevaluated, and based upon the initial findings strategies in all sites, will be modified and expanded.  \nProject Management \nThe  Mayor’s  Office  of  Public  Safety  will  manage  the  City  of  Los  Angeles  Justice \nAssistance Grant Award Program.  The Office has over a decade of experience in managing grant \nfunds and a history of grant compliance. The Office is responsible for securing and administering \nthe City’s State and Federal public safety and criminal justice grants, all of which require \nprogrammatic and fiscal audits.   \nThe City and County of Los Angeles are grouped as disparate jurisdictions for this grant.  \nThe City will act as the fiscal agent and submit all required reports and grant adjustments, as \nneeded.  The City will ensure that County expenditures are in compliance with grant guidelines.  \nThe City and County will plan to expend the funding based on a 50-50 split of the total allocation \n(after the deduction of 10% of the award by the City of Los Angeles for the administration of the \ngrant), amounting to $879,141.15 each for the City and County respectively, and $195,364.70 for \nadministration.  \nAttachment 3  6 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 27 of 66   Page ID #:137\nCity of Los Angeles    FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant  \nBudget and Budget Narrative – Attachment 4 \nCommunity Law Enforcement and Recovery (CLEAR) Program \n \nBudget Narrative \n \nThe City of Los Angeles will dedicate 100% of its FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant allocation \nto support the CLEAR program in order to maximize the cost effectiveness of the grant \nexpenditure.  The award allocation will assist to sustain approximately 20% - 30% of the salaries \nfor the City Attorneys, District Attorneys, and Probation Officers assigned to the CLEAR areas. \nIn addition, LAPD Officers assigned to CLEAR areas are funded by the City of Los Angeles \nentirely.  The remaining costs of the CLEAR program are supported by the City and County \ngeneral funds.         \n \nAn independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the CLEAR program is also conducted and \nincludes the analysis of crime data within CLEAR sites, prosecution rates for CLEAR areas, as \nwell as follow the performance measures consistent with the BJA- JAG Program.  Until 2014, the \nCity of Los Angeles had experienced 12 years of continuous declines in crime, with crime in \nCLEAR sites experiencing larger declines than the rest of the City.  In 2015, the City of Los \nAngeles, along with many other cities nationally, began experiencing an uptick in crime.  In 2016, \nCitywide, Total Violent Crime increased 10.2% with Total Part I Crime increasing 5.5%.  Citywide \nHomicide increased by 13.1%.

The County plans to continue \non  a  similar  path  under  the  Edward  Byrne  Memorial  Justice  Assistance  Grant  (JAG)  by \nmaintaining programs similar to those previously funded under the LLEBG program. \n \nGoals and Objectives: \n \nThe overall goal of the County’s Crime Reduction and Public Safety Improvement Initiative is to \nreduce crime and improve public safety.  Personal and community safety is recognized as being \none of our most basic needs.  The County has been working in a cooperative effort with various \njustice and law enforcement agencies to target street gangs with the use of search warrants, arrests, \nand the seizure of firearms and weapons.  It is most important for perpetrators of violent gang \ncrimes to be identified, arrested, prosecuted, and convicted in accordance with the law.  This is \ndone to protect the public from crime that can ruin the local economy, and have a negative impact \non the quality of life for all persons.   \n \nPublic safety is enhanced when offenders are held accountable and redirected from delinquent and \ncriminal behavior.  Strategies to positively impact the behavior of probationers and at-risk youth \nthrough early intervention, prevention and suppression programs are a key element of Los Angeles \nCounty’s Crime Reduction and Public Safety Improvement Initiative. The County’s Probation \nDepartment administers a variety of services to heighten and promote public safety.  County \nProbation Officers work in a collaborative manner with other law enforcement agencies to prevent \nand reduce criminal behavior by holding probationers accountable through case management, \nsupervision, and monitoring.   The County program will continue to develop and implement \nspecific strategies that target and focus on prosecution programs to suppress organized criminal \ngang behavior and control the impact of gangs on our community; increased law enforcement \npresence in the community particularly during large, high profile community events; Sheriff \nDepartment services to heighten and promote public safety on and off school campuses; and \nongoing collaboration between the County Sheriff’s Department and other law enforcement \nagencies to prevent and reduce criminal behavior through case management, supervision, and \nmonitoring.  Additionally,  the  County  will  be  enhancing  its  program  by  adding  four  new \nContractors upon approval from the Department of Justice to assist with crime prevention and \neducation of at-risk youth. \n \n \n \n \n \nAttachment 12  1 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 54 of 66   Page ID #:164\nCounty of Los Angeles          FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant \nLaw Enforcement Programs: \n \nLos Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) – Patrol Services Overtime  \nAs a means of deterring crime and deploying first responders expeditiously, funding will be used to \nfinance supplemental patrol services to enhance law enforcement services in the unincorporated areas \nof the County.  Additionally, funding will provide for increased law enforcement presence \ncountywide particularly during the large, high profile community events, rallies, protests and \nactivities with large participant turnout and during holidays when there is an increased need for law \nenforcement services.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAttachment 12  2 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 55 of 66   Page ID #:165\nCounty of Los Angeles          FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant \n \n \n \n \nProsecution and Court Programs: \n \nDistrict Attorney’s Office  - Strategies Against Gang Environments (SAGE) \nThe Sage program abates street gang violence and narcotic related activities by utilizing civil \ninjunctions and other procedures deemed appropriate by local law enforcement authorities. The \nprogram provides collaborative efforts among the Los Angeles County District Attorney, Los \nAngeles County Sheriff and the City of Los Angeles Police Department to suppress gang activities \nin targeted areas. \n \nThe District  Attorney’s component of SAGE  provides focused vertical  prosecutions, tracks \ncriminal proceedings of notorious gang members, and contributes expertise and local resources to \nfacilitate the successful arrest and prosecution of gang members who commit serious and/or violent \nfelonies. Assigned Deputy District Attorney staff assists in the coordination of probation and \nparole sweeps by providing guidance and training to local officers on legal search and seizure \nprecedents applicable to the target group. The program also works to suppress and abate street \ngang activity, graffiti, vandalism, narcotic sales and use, and criminal nuisance properties and \nrelated problems that lead to the commission of violent and serious gang-related crimes.  \n \nAlternative Sentencing Program/Paralegal Services - Public Defender \nFunding will be used by the Public Defender to finance paralegal services for the Alternative \nSentencing Program.  The program enhances the adjudication process of cases involving violent \noffenders by utilizing paralegals to assist attorneys in securing information for preparation of the \npenalty phase in capital cases and alternative sentencing reports in cases where there is significant \nmitigating information to support alternative sentencing.  This program presents the Court with a \nrange of sentencing options which offer punishment, control, and accountability, frequently at less \ncost than jail or prison.  This program can reduce unnecessary jail and prison use with a potential \nfor a positive impact upon the management of overcrowded jail facilities.   \n \nAlternative Sentencing Program/Psychiatric Social Worker Services – Alternate Public Defender \nFunding will be used by the Alternate Public Defender (APD) to finance the services of Psychiatric \nSocial Workers (PSW) for the Alternative Sentencing Program.  The Alternate Public Defenders \nAlternative Sentencing program enhances the adjudication process of cases involving mentally ill \nclients by providing in-house Psychiatric Social Workers that are knowledgeable in mental health \nand substance abuse that can make a quick assessment as to what program, if any, would be \nsuitable for the client.  PSW work for the Department of Mental Health and are assigned to APD \ncases.  By having a PSW in-house, in addition to putting the client at ease, the County will also \navoid issues relating to “mandatory reporting”.  As an employee of the APD, the PSW must honor \nthe Attorney-Client Privilege, thus maintaining confidentiality.  \n \n \n \n \nAttachment 12  3 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 56 of 66   Page ID #:166\nCounty of Los Angeles          FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant \nPrevention and Education Programs: \n \nSchool-Based Supervision Program - Probation \nThe  School-Based  Supervision  Program  increases  school  attendance,  competencies  and \nperformance, and provides access to skills and resources needed by parents to effectively parent \ntheir children.  This multi-phase program involves the placement of Deputy Probation Officers to \nhigh schools and middle schools to assess the strengths and needs of at-risk youth in the program.  \nBased on those assessments, case planning exercises will be conducted, and the youth will be \nentered into one or many intervention treatment programs. Funding will be used to finance the \nsalary of the Deputy Probation Officer position.  \n \nAB109  Re-Entry Housing Project \n \nFunding will be used to contract with outside agencies to work in collaboration with the Los \nAngeles Sheriff’s Department to provide reunification services to formerly incarcerated women \nand their families in order to provide a successful transition back into their community, decrease \nrecidivism and reduce crime by potential repeat offenders.  The program provides services to aid \nparticipants with locating and moving into housing and support services in the form of education, \njob-training, and skill building opportunities.  Funds will be used for the contractor personnel, \noperating and administrative expenses.     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAttachment 12  4 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 57 of 66   Page ID #:167\nCounty of Los Angeles          FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant \nLAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS \nBUDGET REQUEST \n       \n \nProgram:  Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department – Patrol Services Overtime  \n \nAllocation Category              Allocated Amount \n \nPersonnel \n \nHiring: \n         \nOther:  Overtime – Deputy/Sergeant          $32,498.15 \n \nPersonnel Subtotal                $32,498.15 \n \nTravel                   $0 \n \nEquipment/Technology              $0 \n \nSupplies                  $0 \n \nContractual                   $0 \n \nOther                    $0 \n \nGrand Total                  $32,498.15 \n   \nAttachment 12  5 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 58 of 66   Page ID #:168\nCounty of Los Angeles          FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant \nPROSECUTION AND COURT PROGRAMS \nBUDGET REQUEST \n       \n \nProgram:  District Attorney’s Office - Strategies Against Gang Environments (SAGE) \n \nAllocation Category              Allocated Amount \n \nPersonnel \n \nHiring: \n         \nOther:  Attorneys, Sworn Officers          $97,019 \n \nPersonnel Subtotal                $97,019 \n     \nTravel                   $0 \n \nEquipment/Technology              $0 \n \nSupplies                  $0 \n \nContractual                   $0 \n \nOther                    $0 \n \nGrand Total                  $97,019 \n \n     \n \n   \nAttachment 12  6 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-5   Filed 09/29/17   Page 59 of 66   Page ID #:169\nCounty of Los Angeles          FY 2017 Justice Assistance Grant \nPROSECUTION AND COURT PROGRAM \nBUDGET REQUEST \n       \n \nProgram:  Alternative Sentencing Program/Paralegal Services - Public Defender  \n \n \nAllocation Category              Allocated Amount \n \nPersonnel \n \nHiring                 $0 \n \nOther:  Attorneys.

Page 1 of 1\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-10   Filed 09/29/17   Page 2 of 2   Page ID #:248\nJUSTICE NEWS\nDepartment of Justice\nOffice of Public Affairs\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, September 7, 2017\nDepartment of Justice Announces Priority Consideration Criteria for \nCOPS Office Grants\nThe Department of Justice today announced additional priority consideration criteria for FY 2017 Office of \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) grants. Jurisdictions for FY 2017 were notified that \ntheir applications would receive additional points in the application scoring process if their agencies \ncooperate with federal law enforcement to address illegal immigration, ensuring that federal immigration \nauthorities have the full ability to enforce immigration laws and keep our communities safe.\n“Cities and states that cooperate with federal law enforcement make all of us safer by helping remove \ndangerous criminals from our communities,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. “This cooperation is \nsupported by the vast majority of the American people, and jurisdictions with these policies in place should \nbe acknowledged for their commitment to ending violent crime, including violent crime stemming from illegal \nimmigration. Today, the Justice Department announced it will recognize jurisdictions that commit to the rule \nof law by awarding additional points in the application scoring process for COPS Office grants. My hope is \nthat this recognition will further incentivize every jurisdiction in America to collaborate with federal law \nenforcement and help us make this country safer.”\nAttachment(s): \nDownload COPS Grant Cooperation Backgrounder\nComponent(s): \nOffice of the Attorney General\nPress Release Number: \n17-976\nUpdated September 7, 2017\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-announces-priority-consideration-criteri... 9/28/2017\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-11   Filed 09/29/17   Page 1 of 2   Page ID #:249\n \n \n \nEXHIBIT 11 \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215   Document 1-11   Filed 09/29/17   Page 2 of 2   Page ID #:250\nCOPS Office: Immigration Cooperation Certification Process Background \nThe following is on background, attributable to a DOJ official: \n•  The Department of Justice encourages cooperation between local jurisdictions and federal \nimmigration authorities. \n \n•  The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) notified its FY2017 \nstate, local, and tribal law enforcement grant applicants that they might receive priority \nconsideration in funding decisions if they cooperate with federal law enforcement. \n  \n•  In order to receive priority consideration, applicants must certify the following: \n  If the applicant operates a detention facility, the applicant must provide \no\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) access to their detention facility;  \n  And, the applicant must provide advance notice as early as practicable (at least 48 \no\nhours, where possible) to DHS of an illegal alien’s release date and time. \n \n•  Applicants that submit the certification will receive additional points in the application \nscoring process in recognition of their efforts to increase information sharing with federal \nimmigration authorities. \n \n•  Background on FY2012-FY2016 grants can be found here. \n   \n ",

Every year, hundreds of law enforcement agencies request funding through this \n7  program, requests that far exceed the total available funds appropriated by Congress.  From 2011 \n8  through 2016, for example, the total requests have been an average of more than five times the \n9  available funds.  To reconcile these competing requests, Congress gave the Department of Justice \n10  (“DOJ” or “Department”) broad discretion to determine, on an annual basis, which jurisdictions \n11  should receive CHP funding.  DOJ exercises that discretion to promote and support public safety \n12  objectives. \n13    DOJ’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS Office” or “Office”) \n14  awards CHP grants.  To apply for funding, a state, local, or tribal agency must submit an appli-\n  \n15  cation that (1) provides information about the jurisdiction’s needs and practices and (2) explains \n16  how the jurisdiction intends to utilize the new officers it will use CHP funds to hire.  The COPS \n17  Office scores the applications according to both the comparative needs of the applicants and \n18  metrics that emphasize the Federal Government’s enforcement priorities in any given year.  To \n19  that end, each year the Office selects several key “focus areas” for law enforcement and gives \n20  extra points to applications that focus on those areas.  Over time, those focus areas have ranged \n21  from Violent Crime Problems to Child and Youth Safety to Drug Abuse. \n22    For Fiscal Year 2017, the COPS Office has included two law-enforcement related \n23  immigration factors in its scoring system.  First, one of the focus areas for this year is “Illegal \n24  Immigration,” which means that applicants can earn extra points by proposing ways to contribute \n25  to combatting illegal immigration.  Second, applicants can earn extra points by adopting policies \n26  to ensure (1) that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has access to the applicant’s \n27  detention facilities to meet with non-U.S. citizens, and (2) that DHS receives advance notice of \n28  the scheduled release of a non-citizen in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS requests it. \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 8 of 32   Page ID #:798\n \n1    Los Angeles seeks a preliminary injunction against the COPS Office’s use of these law-\n2  enforcement-related immigration factors, claiming they are ultra vires and violate the \n3  constitutional Separation of Powers, the limitations on the federal Spending Power, and the \n4  Administrative Procedure Act.  But Los Angeles does not have standing to challenge these factors \n5  at all, much less seek emergency relief.  The City has neither pled nor shown that its injury – not \n6  receiving CHP funding – is traceable to the immigration factors it attacks.  Nor could it.  As the \n7  accompanying declaration from the COPS Office makes clear, Los Angeles would not receive \n8  CHP funding this year even if all points related to illegal immigration were excluded from the \n9  scoring.  Los Angeles does not have standing to challenge a supposed violation that does not \n10  affect it. \n11    Even if the City did have standing, its suit is unlikely to succeed.  The COPS statutes give \n12  DOJ broad discretion to allocate scarce CHP funds among the many applicants who seek them, \n13  such that the Office is not acting ultra vires or encroaching on the congressional sphere.  As for \n14  the Spending Clause, the immigration-related factors – which are mere scoring criteria rather than \n      \n15  conditions on federal funds – are clear and clearly related to the Program’s purposes.  The COPS \n16  Office offered to answer any questions from potential applicants (an offer Los Angeles did not \n17  accept), and the COPS Office believes illegal immigration is a public safety issue best addressed \n18  by facilitating federal access to non-citizens who are in custody and who have thus either \n19  committed crimes or are suspected of committing crimes.  Finally, as for plaintiff’s APA claim, \n20  the immigration-related factors are consistent with the CHP’s purposes, and nothing in the statute \n21  suggests these factors are off limits.  Plaintiff may have a “difference in view,” but that is not an \n22  APA violation.  See, e.g., All. for the Wild Rockies v. Peña, 865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2017). \n23    Further, the City cannot show a likelihood of irreparable harm absent a preliminary \n24  injunction, and the public interest weighs against the injunction sought.  Again, Los Angeles \n25  would not receive a CHP grant this year regardless of the immigration-related factors.  It will \n26  thus suffer no harm – much less irreparable harm – absent an injunction.  And the public interest \n27  weighs heavily in favor of enforcing the law and protecting public safety.  \n28    For these reasons, plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction should be denied. \n       2\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 9 of 32   Page ID #:799\n \n1   \nSTATUTORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE BACKGROUND \n2 \n \nI.  COPS Hiring Program and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services \n3 \n \n4    A.  Governing Statutes and Creation of the Program \n5    In the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Congress authorized the \n6  Attorney General to “make grants to States, units of local government, [and] Indian tribal \n7  governments . . . to increase police presence, to expand and improve cooperative efforts between \n8  law enforcement agencies and members of the community to address crime and disorder \n9  problems, and otherwise to enhance public safety.”  Pub. L. No. 103-322, Title I, § 10003(a), 108 \n10  Stat. 1808 (1994).  As later amended and currently codified, the statute provides authority to \n11  make grants for any of several specific purposes, including –  \n \n12    (1) to rehire law enforcement officers who have been laid off as a result of \nState, tribal, or local budget reductions for deployment in community-oriented \n13 \npolicing; [and] \n \n14 \n         (2) to hire and train new, additional career law enforcement officers for \n15  deployment in community-oriented policing across the Nation, including by \nprioritizing the hiring and training of veterans . . . . \n16 \n34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2). \n17 \n  The Attorney General created the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services to \n18 \nadminister grants under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  See \n19 \nDeclaration of Andrew A. Dorr ¶ 2 (“Dorr Decl.”) (Attachment 1 hereto).  In addition to adminis-\n20 \ntering grant programs that promote “community policing,” the COPS Office provides community \n21 \npolicing training and technical assistance to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.  Id.  \n22 \nThe Office is headed by a Director appointed by the Attorney General.  Id.; 28 C.F.R. §§ 0.119, \n23 \n0.120.  The COPS Office began implementing 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1) and (b)(2) in 1994.  \n24 \nInitially, the Office operated two programs, one for large grantees and one for small grantees.  See \n25 \nDorr Decl. ¶ 5.  The programs were combined in 1995, and it was named the COPS Hiring \n26 \nProgram in 2010.  Id. \n27 \n  Under CHP, the COPS Office makes grants to States, units of local government, and \n28 \n       3\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 10 of 32   Page ID #:800\n \n1  Indian tribal governments to hire, rehire, or train law enforcement officers for deployment in \n2  “community-oriented policing,” which the Office defines as “a philosophy that promotes \n3  organizational strategies that support the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving \n4  techniques to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues \n5  such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime.”  Id. ¶¶ 5, 7.  A COPS Hiring Program grant is \n6  discretionary, id. ¶ 4 – that is, it is a grant “for which the federal awarding agency generally may \n7  select the recipient from among all eligible recipients, may decide to make or not make an award \n8  based on the programmatic, technical, or scientific content of an application, and can decide the \n9  amount of funding to be awarded.”  See Discretionary Grant, Grant Terminology, \n10  https://www.grants.gov/ web/ grants/ learn-grants/ grant-terminology.html (last visited Oct. 11, \n11  2017).  Discretionary grants differ from formula grants, which, when awarded, must follow \n12  statutorily created statistical criteria.  See Formula Grant, Grant Terminology, \n13  https://www.grants.gov/ web/ grants/ learn-grants/ grant-terminology.html (last visited Oct. 11, \n14  2017).  \n      \n15    The operation of the CHP – like all other COPS Office grant programs – is subject to \n16  specific annual appropriations by Congress.  See Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.  Each year, Congress \n17  appropriates a certain amount “for the hiring and rehiring of additional career law enforcement \n18  officers” under the Program.  See, e.g., Pub. Law No. 113-235, 128 Stat. 2130, 2196 (2014); Pub. \n19  Law No. 113-6, 127 Stat. 198, 257 (2013); Pub. Law No. 112-55, 125 Stat. 552, 618 (2011).1  \n20  Those amounts have decreased over the last several years, making the Program increasingly \n21  competitive.  See Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.  Each year, the applications that the COPS Office receives \n22  for CHP grants seek more funds, in the aggregate, than Congress has appropriated.  Id. ¶ 13. \n23    The statute sets forth certain specific requirements for the COPS Hiring Program.  For \n24  example, the COPS Office must award at least 0.5% of the available funding to the grantees \n25  within any State that has eligible applicants (which helps ensure that smaller States are not \n26  excluded from funding), 34 U.S.C. § 10381(f); Dorr Decl. ¶ 9; the Office must allocate 50% of \n                                              \n27 \n  1 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b) provides statutory authority for several other potential grants, 34 \n28  U.S.C. § 10381(b)(3) - (22), but Congress has never appropriated funds for most of them and, \ntherefore, the COPS Office has never offered grants under most of them.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 6. \n       4\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 11 of 32   Page ID #:801\n \n1  each year’s available funds to jurisdictions with a population over 150,000 and 50% of available \n2  funds to jurisdictions with a population less than 150,000, 34 U.S.C. § 10381(h); see id. \n3  § 10261(a)(11)(B); and each grantee must provide a portion of the money used to hire or rehire \n4  each law enforcement officer that CHP funds (i.e., local matching funds), subject to discretionary \n5  waiver by the Attorney General, id. § 10381(g).  \n6    B.  Scoring Applications and Selecting Grantees \n7    Other than these broad rules, the statutes governing the COPS Hiring Program do not \n8  prescribe any particular method or factors for evaluating applications or choosing which applica-\n9  tions to fund.  The COPS Office must thus necessarily exercise judgment and discretion in \n10  choosing among applications.  And the COPS Office has developed methods to evaluate and \n11  score applications in order to determine how best to allocate the Program’s finite funds.  See Dorr \n12  Decl. ¶ 14.  A jurisdiction seeking a CHP grant fills out and submits an electronic application on \n13  the COPS Office web site.  Id. ¶ 10.  The application is part of a system that assigns a specific \n14  number of points for each answer given by the applicant.  Id. ¶ 15.   \n      \n15    Some of the factors that the COPS Office uses in scoring applications are reflected in the \n16  statutes.  For example, the statute states that applicants “shall . . . demonstrate a specific public \n17  safety need [and] explain the applicant’s inability to address the need without Federal assistance.”  \n18  34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(2), (3).  The Office has implemented this directive by requesting data \n19  reflecting each applicant’s crime statistics and financial need and by according extra points in the \n20  application system based on higher crime rates within a jurisdiction and comparatively greater \n21  fiscal need.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 16.  Similarly, the application system scores the quality of the \n22  applicant’s community policing plan pursuant to the statutory requirement that applicants \n23  “explain how the grant will be utilized to reorient the affected law enforcement agency’s mission \n24  toward community-oriented policing or enhance its involvement in or commitment to \n25  community-oriented policing.”  Id.; 34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(10). \n26    Most of the factors that the COPS Office has historically used to score applications are not \n27  expressly reflected in the statutes, but are adopted as an exercise of the Office’s statutory discre-\n28  tion to evaluate applications and distribute scarce funding.  The Office has employed such \n       5\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 12 of 32   Page ID #:802\n \n1  discretionary factors since the inception of the COPS Hiring Program, and Congress has \n2  continued to appropriate funding for the Program each year with a complete understanding of \n3  how the Office administers it.  The COPS Office exercises its discretion through several scoring \n4  mechanisms, without which the program’s limited funding could not be rationally awarded. \n5    First, each year, the COPS Office designates several broad areas of public safety and \n6  community policing, and applicants must indicate which areas their proposed activities will \n7  support.  And each year, the COPS Office prioritizes certain of the available areas; applicants \n8  who select those focus areas receive extra points in the application system.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 18.  \n9  The available areas, and the focus areas, have changed over the years, reflecting changes in both \n10  national law enforcement necessities and Department of Justice priorities.  For example, in FY \n11  2014, after the Newtown (Connecticut) Police Department failed to score high enough in FY \n12  2013 to receive a CHP grant following the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School \n13  shooting, the COPS Office added a “catastrophic event” question to the application and assigned \n14  it the highest level of extra points to ensure that the Office could assist agencies afflicted by \n      \n15  unexpected catastrophes like the Sandy Hook shooting.  Id.  For Fiscal Year 2017, the available \n16  areas are Child and Youth Safety Focus; Child and Youth Safety Focus: School Based Policing; \n17  Illegal Immigration; Drug Abuse; Homeland Security Problems; Non-Violent Crime Problems \n18  and Quality-of-Life Policing; Building Trust and Respect; Traffic/Pedestrian Safety Problems; \n19  and Violent Crime Problems.  Id. ¶ 7.   \n20    Second, certain questions on the CHP application that do not relate to focus areas are \n21  awarded more points than other questions based on their significance to advancing community \n22  policing or other priorities.  Id. ¶ 18.  For example, the application system accords extra points for \n23  certain internal management practices of the applicant, including the regular assessment of \n24  employee satisfaction, the exercise of flexibility in officer shift assignments to facilitate address-\n25  ing problems, and the operation of an “early intervention system” to identify officers showing \n26  signs of stress, personal problems, or questionable work conduct.  Id.  Additionally, from FY \n27  2013 through FY 2016, the COPS Office, based on the Attorney General’s priorities, assigned \n28  extra points for jurisdictions that preferred military veterans in hiring officers with CHP funds, \n       6\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 13 of 32   Page ID #:803\n \n1  although no such preference was then mandated in the statute.  Id. ¶ 19.2 \n2    Third, each individual factor on the CHP application falls into one of three categories:  \n3  Fiscal Health, Crime, or Community Policing.  Id. ¶ 20.  After calculating each applicant’s raw \n4  scores, the COPS Office gives different weights to the applicant’s scores in each of these \n5  categories, based on the Attorney General’s priorities and the needs of public safety.  Id.  For \n6  most years, each applicant’s score in the Fiscal Health category has been weighted as 20% of the \n7  applicant’s final score; each applicant’s score in the Crime category has been weighted as 30% of \n8  the applicant’s final score; and each applicant’s score in the Community Policing category has \n9  been weighted as 50% of the applicant’s final score.  Id.  The Office changes these weighting \n10  percentages from time to time.  In FY 2009, for example, in light of the national fiscal issues that \n11  resulted in enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, see Pub. L. No. \n12  111-5, 123 Stat. 115, the Office accorded 50% of the weighting to the “Fiscal Health” category.  \n13  Id. \n14    C.  Immigration-Related Factors \n      \n15    Beginning with Fiscal Year 2016, certain immigration-related requirements and scoring \n16  factors have been included in the COPS Hiring Program. \n17    CHP grantees, like all federal grantees, are required to comply with all applicable federal \n18  laws.  Id. ¶ 23.  Beginning with FY 2016, the COPS Office has advised each CHP applicant that \n19  this requirement includes compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which provides that “a Federal, State, \n20  or local government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government \n21  entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n22  information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any \n23  individual.”  Id. § 1373(a); see Dorr Decl. ¶ 23.  In FY 2017, the COPS Office required applicants \n24  to certify compliance with Section 1373 as a threshold eligibility requirement, although there is \n25  no scoring associated with it.  Id. \n26    For FY 2017, the priority areas on the CHP application included proposals that explicitly \n                                              \n27 \n  2 Beginning with a legislative amendment in 2017, the statute now expressly authorizes \n28  “prioritizing the hiring and training of veterans.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(2); see Pub. L. No. \n115-37, 131 Stat. 854 (2017). \n       7\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 14 of 32   Page ID #:804\n \n1  prioritized addressing problems with violent crime; proposals that focused on homeland security, \n2  such as protecting critical infrastructure; and proposals that focused on contributing to the control \n3  of illegal immigration or cooperating with federal authorities in enforcing federal immigration \n4  law.  Id. ¶ 18.  Thus, the application system assigned extra points for focusing on Illegal \n5  Immigration, although it also gave an equal or greater number of points for focusing on other \n6  specified areas.  Id. ¶ 24.  Some jurisdictions chose Illegal Immigration as the focus area of their \n7  FY 2017 applications, but none scored high enough to permit further consideration, regardless of \n8  any points attributable to the access-and-notice factors described below.  Id. \n9    Lastly, beginning in FY 2017, the COPS Office has offered applicants the opportunity to \n10  receive additional points by certifying that the applicant has implemented or would implement \n11  regulations or policies to ensure (1) that DHS would have access to the applicant’s correctional or \n12  detention facilities “to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as \n13  to his or her right to be or to remain in the United States,” and (2) that the applicant’s correctional \n14  and detention facilities will “provide advance notice as early as practicable (at least 48 hours, \n      \n15  where possible) to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdic-\n16  tion’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien.”  Id. ¶ 25.  To \n17  inform applicants of the opportunity to receive points based on these “access” and “notice” \n18  factors, the COPS Office electronically sent each applicant a letter, certification form, and \n19  background documents.  Id. ¶ 27 & Ex. B.  These materials stated, among other things, that the \n20  certification would not commit applicants to detain any individuals beyond their scheduled time \n21  of release, and that applicants would not be penalized if they did not operate detention facilities.  \n22  Id. ¶ 27. \n23    A jurisdiction’s certification regarding these factors does not forbid the jurisdiction from \n24  informing detainees that they may choose not to meet with federal immigration authorities where \n25  the jurisdiction’s laws require providing that information.  Id. ¶ 26.  Nor does the certification \n26  require a jurisdiction to notify DHS before releasing a non-U.S. citizen under short-term detention \n27  with an unknown release time.  Id.  Rather, the certification means that when DHS requests \n28 \n       8\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 15 of 32   Page ID #:805\n \n1  advance notice of a particular suspected non-citizen’s release, the jurisdiction will provide that \n2  notice as early as practicable before releasing the suspected non-citizen.  Id.  \n3  II.  Immigration and Nationality Act \n4    Enforcement of the immigration laws, including and especially the investigation and \n5  apprehension of criminal aliens, is a quintessential law enforcement function.  Through the \n6  Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101-07, Congress granted the Executive \n7  Branch significant authority to control the entry, movement, and other conduct of foreign \n8  nationals in the United States.  These responsibilities are assigned to law enforcement agencies, \n9  as the INA authorizes DHS, DOJ, and other Executive Branch agencies to administer and enforce \n10  the immigration laws.  The INA permits the Executive Branch to exercise considerable executive \n11  discretion to direct enforcement pursuant to federal policy objectives.  See, e.g., Arizona v. United \n12  States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012).   \n13    The INA includes several provisions that protect the ability of federal officials to \n14  investigate the status of non-citizens in the United States and otherwise enforce the immigration \n      \n15  laws.  For example, the statute provides that a federal immigration officer “shall have power \n16  without warrant . . . to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be \n17  or to remain in the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(1).  Separately, as noted above, 8 U.S.C. \n18  § 1373 provides that “a Federal, State, or local government entity or official may not prohibit, or \n19  in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the \n20  Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration \n21  status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.”  Id. § 1373(a).3  The INA provides that certain \n22  classes of non-citizens shall be removed from the United States upon the order of the Attorney \n23  General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.  See, e.g., id. §§ 1227(a), 1228. \n24 \n                                              \n25    3 Additionally, 8 U.S.C. § 1373(b) provides that “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of \nFederal, State, or local law, no person or agency may prohibit, or in any way restrict, a Federal, \n26 \nState, or local government entity from doing any of the following with respect to information \nregarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual: (1) Sending such infor-\n27 \nmation to, or requesting or receiving such information from, the Immigration and Naturalization \n28  Service. (2) Maintaining such information. (3) Exchanging such information with any other \nFederal, State, or local government entity.” \n       9\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 16 of 32   Page ID #:806\n \n1    The INA also establishes immigration enforcement as a cooperative endeavor among \n2  federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.  See, e.g., id. § 1357(g) (providing that DHS \n3  may enter into formal cooperative agreements with states and localities under which appropriately \n4  trained and qualified state and local officers may perform specified functions of a federal \n5  immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens); see also \n6  id. § 1324(c) (authorizing state and local law enforcement officers to make arrests for violations \n7  of the INA’s prohibition against smuggling, transporting, or harboring aliens); id. § 1252c \n8  (authorizing state and local officers to arrest certain felons who have unlawfully returned to the \n9  United States).   \n10  III.  Los Angeles’s COPS Hiring Program Applications \n11    Los Angeles has applied for CHP grants three times:  in FY 2012, FY 2016, and FY 2017.  \n12  The 2012 and 2016 applications were granted, with the City receiving $6,428,350 for 25 officers \n13  in 2012, and $3,125,000 for 25 officers in 2016.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 30.  The City’s application for \n14  FY 2017 sought $3.125 million to support hiring twenty-five officers for a Community Safety \n      \n15  Partnership Program.  Id. ¶ 31.  Los Angeles neither listed Illegal Immigration as a focus area in \n16  its FY 2017 application nor returned a certification regarding the access and notice factors.  Id. \n17    After plaintiff commenced this action, the COPS Office tabulated the scores of this year’s \n18  CHP applicants and determined that Los Angeles would not receive a CHP grant even absent the \n19  immigration-related factors described above.  Id. ¶ 32.  Moreover, among the large-population \n20  jurisdictions, only one applicant listed “Illegal Immigration” as a focus area, and it still scored \n21  lower than Los Angeles; thus, the existence of the “Illegal Immigration” focus area did not affect \n22  Los Angeles’s receipt or non-receipt of an award.  Id.  Thus, even if all points associated with \n23  illegal immigration were excluded from the scoring, Los Angeles still would not score highly \n24  enough among large-population applicants to receive a grant.  Id. \n25  ARGUMENT \n26    A preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary and drastic remedy” that should not be \n27  granted “unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.’”  Lopez v. \n28  Brewer, 680 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 \n       10\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 17 of 32   Page ID #:807\n \n1  (1997) (per curiam)).  The Supreme Court has clarified the requirements for a preliminary \n2  injunction in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008).  Under Winter, \n3  “[a] plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the \n4  merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the \n5  balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 20 \n6  (emphasis added).  Critically, this is “a four-part conjunctive test, not . . . a four-factor balancing \n7  test”; thus, Winter “reject[ed] the sliding-scale test as to the irreparable-injury prong” previously \n8  used by some courts.  U.S. Bank, N.A. v. SFR Invs. Pool 1, LLC, 124 F. Supp. 3d 1063, 1070 (D. \n9  Nev. 2015); see Am. Trucking Ass’ns v. City of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009) \n10  (“To the extent that our cases have suggested a lesser standard, they are no longer controlling, or \n11  even viable.”) (footnote omitted).  Further, “[t]he party seeking the injunction bears the burden of \n12  proving these elements.”  Campbell v. Feld Entm’t Inc., No. 12-CV-4233-LHK, 2013 WL \n13  4510629, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 22, 2013). \n14    Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction should be denied both because its request \n      \n15  for an injunction is non-justiciable and because it cannot meet the requirements for preliminary \n16  relief. \n17  I.  Plaintiff’s Claims Are Non-Justiciable \n18    Article III of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to “Cases” and \n19  “Controversies.”  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  Matters outside this rubric are “nonjusticiable.”  \n20  Ore. Bureau of Labor & Indus. ex rel. Richardson v. U.S. W. Commc’ns, Inc., 288 F.3d 414, 416 \n21  (9th Cir. 2002).  To satisfy the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing to sue, a plaintiff \n22  must demonstrate an “injury in fact,” a “fairly traceable” causal connection between the injury \n23  and defendant’s conduct, and redressability.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, \n24  102-03 (1998).  The injury needed for constitutional standing must be “concrete,” “objective,” \n25  and “palpable,” not merely “abstract” or “subjective.”  See Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, \n26  155 (1990); Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 816-17 (1975).  Finally, the plaintiff must show “a \n27  likelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged injury.”  Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 103. \n28 \n       11\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 18 of 32   Page ID #:808\n \n1    Under these principles, plaintiff’s request for an injunction against using the immigration-\n2  related factors in the COPS Hiring Program is non-justiciable.  Plaintiff’s alleged harm is “a \n3  disadvantage in the competition” for CHP funds (Doc. 7-1 at 21), and, to eliminate that disadvan-\n4  tage and secure a grant, plaintiff seeks an injunction against use of the immigration-related \n5  factors.  As described above, however, the COPS Office has now calculated the scores of this \n6  year’s CHP applicants, and has determined that Los Angeles would not receive a grant even \n7  without consideration of the factors challenged here.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 32.  Therefore, the relief \n8  that plaintiff seeks – an injunction against the immigration-related factors – would not alter the \n9  outcome.  Either way, Los Angeles would receive no grant, which means that the City’s suit, even \n10  if successful, would not redress its harm.  Thus, plaintiff cannot establish standing.  \n11  II.  Plaintiff Cannot Establish a Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n12    Even if this case were not moot, Los Angeles would be unable to show the “sine qua non” \n13  of eligibility for a preliminary injunction:  that is, likelihood of success on the merits of its claims.  \n14  See Thomas v. Zachry, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, No. 3:17-CV-0219-LRH-WGC, 2017 WL 2633692, \n      \n15  at *2 (D. Nev. June 19, 2017) (“The sine qua non of preliminary injunction inquiry is likelihood \n16  of success on the merits:  if the moving party cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in \n17  his quest, the remaining factors become matters of idle curiosity.”) (quoting New Comm Wireless \n18  Services, Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002)).  \n \n19 \n  A.  Plaintiff Is Unlikely to Succeed on Its Ultra Vires and  \n    Separation of Powers Claims \n20 \n  Plaintiff’s first claim is that the COPS Office has acted beyond its authority and \n21 \nencroached upon the constitutional authority of Congress in adopting immigration-related factors \n22 \nin the COPS Hiring Program (Doc. 7-1 at 11-15).  In this case, at least, the concepts of statutory \n23 \nauthority and constitutional separation of powers are two ways of looking at the same issue.  \n24 \nArticle I of the Constitution confers on Congress the authority to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, \n25 \nImposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare \n26 \nof the United States.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  In exercising this power, Congress may – and \n27 \nnecessarily does – delegate to the Executive Branch the authority to make decisions regarding the \n28 \n       12\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 19 of 32   Page ID #:809\n \n1  expenditure of funds.  See, e.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 488 (1998) \n2  (“Congress has frequently delegated the President the authority to spend, or not to spend, \n3  particular sums of money.”); Ameron, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 809 F.2d 979, 983 \n4  (3d Cir. 1986) (“Congress appropriates funds for a wide variety of purposes and delegates to \n5  executive branch officials the authority to make certain decisions regarding how those funds are \n6  to be spent.”).  \n7    The Executive Branch is responsible for implementing the law.  The Supreme Court has \n8  held that an Executive “officer may be said to act ultra vires only when he acts without any \n9  authority whatever.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101 n.11 (1984) \n10  (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, claims that an agency has used its authority \n11  erroneously or inappropriately are insufficient to state an ultra vires claim.  Rather, ultra vires \n12  claims must be based on an “officer’s lack of delegated power”; merely claiming an “error in the \n13  exercise of that power is . . . not sufficient.”  Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., \n14  337 U.S. 682, 690 (1949) (emphasis added).   \n      \n15    Here, the Department of Justice, acting through the COPS Office, is responsible for \n16  disseminating the scarce funds appropriated under 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1) and (b)(2).  The \n17  statute gives the COPS Office discretion in disseminating those funds, and the inadequacy of the \n18  available funds to cover all applications requires DOJ to adopt and employ factors to rank and \n19  choose among them.  Although the statute imposes certain requirements on disseminating CHP \n20  funding, those requirements are only broad guidelines that are too general to actually allocate the \n21  awards.  Congress gave DOJ discretion to fill in the gaps.    \n22    By statute, the funds must be used to hire, rehire, and train law enforcement officers “for \n23  deployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  The statute also \n24  provides a broad framework for DOJ’s discretionary awards.  Recognizing that there would likely \n25  not be enough money to fund every applicant, Congress required that at least 0.5% of available \n26  funding be awarded to the grantees within any State that has eligible applicants, id. § 10381(f), \n27  that DOJ equally allocate the available funds between large and small jurisdictions, id. \n28  § 10381(h); id. § 10261(a)(11)(B), and that DOJ generally require local jurisdictions to provide \n       13\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 20 of 32   Page ID #:810\n \n1  matching funds, id. § 10381(g).  Congress also specified that each application must, among other \n2  things, “demonstrate a specific public safety need,” “explain the applicant’s inability to address \n3  the need without Federal assistance,” and “explain how the grant will be utilized to reorient the \n4  [applicant’s] mission toward community-oriented policing or enhance its involvement in or \n5  commitment to community-oriented policing.”  Id. § 10382(c)(2), (3), (10).     \n6    Beyond these basic requirements, the statute provides no comprehensive framework or \n7  formula for choosing among the many jurisdictions that satisfy them.  Indeed, the statute does not \n8  even direct DOJ to prioritize applications that show the greatest “public safety need,” the most \n9  dire “inability to address the need without Federal assistance,” or the greatest ability or willing-\n10  ness “to reorient the [applicant’s] mission toward community-oriented policing.”  It instead leaves \n11  the details to DOJ, which means the COPS Office must either choose the winning applicants via \n12  random lottery – an irrational method that losing applicants would surely challenge as arbitrary \n13  and capricious – or develop a logical method of selecting worthy applicants that represents a \n14  reasonable exercise of DOJ’s statutory discretion.  By taking the latter course, the Office is not \n      \n15  encroaching on Congress.  It is simply filling in gaps that Congress left for it to fill, no doubt \n16  because Congress wanted DOJ to use its law-enforcement expertise to award these discretionary \n17  grants in ways that best promote Congress’s broad goal of making our communities safer through \n18  community-oriented policing.  Cf. United States v. Dang, 488 F.3d 1135, 1140 (9th Cir. 2007) \n19  (“Here, a plain reading of the statute indicates that Congress intended to leave a statutory gap for \n20  the administrative agency to fill.”).  Los Angeles might disagree with how the COPS Office is \n21  exercising its statutory discretion, but simply asserting an “error in the exercise” of delegated \n22  authority is “not sufficient” to state an ultra vires claim.  Larson, 337 U.S. at 690. \n23    The seven arguments listed in plaintiff’s motion do not establish a likelihood of succeed-\n24  ing on the Separation of Powers or ultra vires claim.  First, the three (really two) discretionary \n25  considerations set forth at 34 U.S.C. § 10381(c), are not mandatory considerations, let alone \n26  exhaustive ones.  They are, rather, bases on which “the Attorney General may give preferential \n27  consideration, where feasible,” id. (emphasis added), should he decide to do so in his discretion.  \n28  And these factors obviously are not exhaustive, because merely prioritizing jurisdictions that \n       14\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 21 of 32   Page ID #:811\n \n1  provide greater than 25% matching funds, id. § 10381(c)(1), or that have certain laws related to \n2  child sex trafficking, id. § 10381(c)(2)-(3), would not be sufficient to allocate limited CHP \n3  funding among the many applicants.  Congress’s inclusion of a few factors that the COPS Office \n4  “may” consider plainly does not foreclose the Office from developing additional factors to guide \n5  how it awards its discretionary grants.  See Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 \n6  (2003) (“We do not read the enumeration of one case to exclude another unless it is fair to \n7  suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it.”).4 \n8    Over the last twenty-three years, the COPS Office has used many discretionary factors, \n9  not expressly reflected in the statute, to identify which applicants are most deserving of COPS \n10  hiring grants.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 18-20.  For example, the statute says nothing about prioritizing \n11  different areas of public safety from year to year, which is an obvious means of directing \n12  priorities and distributing funds logically and equitably.  See id. ¶ 18.  Nor does the statute \n13  expressly direct the Office to favor localities that have recently experienced a catastrophic public \n14  safety event (like the December 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino, California, which resulted \n      \n15  in a FY 2016 CHP grant to the San Bernardino Police Department), or to assign extra points for \n16  exercising flexibility in officer shift assignments, or for attempting to identify officers showing \n17  signs of stress or questionable work conduct.  Id.  Nor did the statute mandate the COPS Office’s \n18  military veteran preference until Congress added it in 2017.  Id. ¶ 19.  In short, since Congress \n19  created the COPS discretionary grant program, DOJ has exercised its statutory discretion to \n20  develop and use a variety of different factors to award funding.  The immigration-related factors \n21  at issue here are just the latest example of that broad discretion.  If plaintiff’s theory were correct, \n22  all of these discretionary actions over the years – from prioritizing mass shootings to stressing \n23  officer safety – would have to be deemed ultra vires.  And Congress, knowing of this \n24  (purportedly) ultra vires activity, would have to be deemed to have ignored it time and time again \n25 \n26 \n                                              \n  4 This is confirmed by the fact that Congress added the human-trafficking provisions only \n27 \nin 2015.  See Pub. L. No. 114-22, § 1002, 129 Stat. 227, 266-67 (2015).  If plaintiff’s construction \n28  of the statute were correct, prior to 2015, the COPS Office would have been limited to ranking \napplicants based on a jurisdiction’s willingness to exceed the minimum matching requirement. \n       15\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 22 of 32   Page ID #:812\n \n1  by repeatedly appropriating funding for the program every year without restriction. \n2    Second, plaintiff misreads the statute in arguing that most of the factors on which the \n3  Office relies are not among “the twenty-two enumerated purposes of the COPS program” in 34 \n4  U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1) through (22) (Doc. 7-1 at 12-13).  The COPS Hiring Program is authorized \n5  by only the first two paragraphs of Section 10381(b), which authorize providing grants for hiring, \n6  rehiring, and training law enforcement officers “for deployment in community-oriented policing.”  \n7  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  That language is reflected in Congress’s annual appropriations, \n8  which provide funds specifically “for the hiring and rehiring of additional career law enforcement \n9  officers.”  See, e.g., Pub. Law No. 113-235, 128 Stat. 2130, 2196 (2014); Pub. Law No. 113-6, \n10  127 Stat. 198, 257 (2013); Pub. Law No. 112-55, 125 Stat. 552, 618 (2011).  The other para-\n11  graphs of Section 10381(b) authorize other potential grants, when appropriated by Congress, such \n12  as grants “to establish innovative programs to reduce, and keep to a minimum, the amount of time \n13  that law enforcement officers must be away from the community while awaiting court appear-\n14  ances” or “to support the purchase by a law enforcement agency of no more than 1 service \n      \n15  weapon per officer.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(10), (16).  Congress has never appropriated money to \n16  fund those other programs and accordingly the COPS Office does not award grants for those \n17  purposes.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 6. \n18    Third, the COPS Office’s authority to develop and employ factors to choose among the \n19  various applicants for scarce CHP funds does not derive from the Office’s statutory authority to \n20  dictate the “form” and content of applications, 34 U.S.C. § 10382(b) (Doc. 7-1 at 13).  It derives, \n21  rather, from the statutory scheme that establishes the CHP discretionary grant program.  The \n22  COPS Office’s authority to develop an application is simply a small subset of that broader \n23  discretion. \n24    Fourth, the proposed legislative amendment on which plaintiff relies (Doc. 7-1 at 13) is \n25  not a proposal to amend the statutes governing the COPS Hiring Program.  It is, rather, a request \n26  to amend an entirely separate statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1373, to “condition” federal funding on \n27  affirmative cooperation with federal immigration authorities.  See Declaration of Steven Hong \n28  (Doc. 7-3), Ex. F at 26.  The immigration considerations at issue here are not “conditions” on \n       16\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 23 of 32   Page ID #:813\n \n1  receiving COPS funding; indeed, numerous jurisdictions that are focusing on goals other than \n2  immigration and did not execute the “access” and “notice” certification will receive CHP funding \n3  this year.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 32.  That is because these considerations are simply some of the many \n4  factors the COPS Office is using in Fiscal Year 2017 to allocate its scarce grant awards – no \n5  different from the many other considerations the Office has used over the years in exercising its \n6  statutory discretion. \n7    Fifth, 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(3), does not limit the means by which a state or local \n8  government can assist in the enforcement of immigration law or prohibit the COPS Office from \n9  assigning extra points to jurisdictions that opt to assist federal immigration enforcement (contra \n10  Doc. 7-1 at 13-14).  As the Supreme Court has observed, that statute only delineates some of the \n11  circumstances under which “state officers may perform the functions of an immigration officer,” \n12  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 408 (2012), which include arresting aliens for “entering \n13  or attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of \n14  law regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2).  \n      \n15  No formal agreement under Section 1357(g) is required for state and local officers to assist in \n16  other ways, such as by providing access to non-citizens they have detained or informing federal \n17  authorities of the impending release of such persons where practical.  That kind of rudimentary \n18  assistance – essentially making a phone call to DHS and then letting DHS personnel into a \n19  building – does not require addressing the “complexities involved in enforcing federal immigra-\n20  tion law, [such as] the determination whether a person is removable.”  Arizona, 567 U.S. at 409. \n21    Sixth, the challenged immigration-related factors in the COPS Hiring Program do not \n22  impermissibly exercise “direction, supervision, or control over any police force or any other \n23  criminal justice agency” in violation of 34 U.S.C. § 10228 (contra Doc. 7-1 at 14).  Merely \n24  encouraging cooperation with federal authorities by giving additional points as one portion of a \n25  broader scoring system to administer a discretionary grant program does not exercise “direction, \n26  supervision, or control.”  Indeed, concurrent with the enactment of 34 U.S.C. § 10228, Congress \n27  created the National Institute of Justice, see Pub. L. No. 96-157, §§ 202, 815, 93 Stat. 1167 \n28  (1979), one of whose very purposes is “to develop programs and projects . . . to improve and \n       17\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 24 of 32   Page ID #:814\n \n1  expand cooperation among the Federal Government, States, and units of local government . . . .”  \n2  34 U.S.C. § 10122(c)(2)(F).   \n3    Seventh, the “clear statement” rule in Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 461 (1991), does \n4  not apply to the development and use of scoring factors in the COPS Hiring Program (contra \n5  Doc. 7-1 at 15).  In Gregory, the Supreme Court addressed whether federal law would override a \n6  provision of the Missouri constitution requiring most state judges to retire at age seventy.  Id. at \n7  455-61.  The Court held that it would not “upset the usual constitutional balance of federal and \n8  state powers” without a “clear statement” from Congress.  Id. at 460-61.  But this case does not \n9  involve overriding state or local law.  It is, rather, simply the latest iteration of an over-two-\n10  decades-old discretionary grant program that gives state and local agencies an opportunity to \n11  focus on federal enforcement priorities and thereby increase their chances of receiving a federal \n12  grant.  Nothing in this voluntary program risks “overriding” Los Angeles law.   \n13    B.  Plaintiff Is Unlikely to Succeed on Its Spending Clause Claim \n14    Plaintiff’s second claim is that the use of immigration-related factors in the COPS Hiring \n      \n15  Program exceeds federal power under the Spending Clause (Doc. 7-1 at 15-20).  This Clause \n16  provides that Congress may “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts \n17  and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.”  U.S. Const. art. \n18  I, § 8, cl. 1.  As the Supreme Court has held, “Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of \n19  federal funds, and has repeatedly employed the power to further broad policy objectives by \n20  conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient with federal statutory \n21  and administrative directives.”  S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987) (internal quotation \n22  marks omitted).  \n23    The Court in Dole described certain limitations or potential limitations on the spending \n24  power.  Among other things, conditions on the receipt of federal funds must be stated “unambig-\n25  uously” so that recipients can “exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of \n26  their participation.”  Id. at 207.  Also, the Court observed, “our cases have suggested (without \n27  significant elaboration) that conditions on federal grants might be illegitimate if they are unrelated \n28 \n       18\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 25 of 32   Page ID #:815\n \n1  to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs.”  Id. at 207-08 (internal quota-\n2  tion marks omitted).  Assuming the immigration-related factors used by the COPS Office could \n3  be classified as “conditions,” they satisfy both of these aspects of Dole.5  \n4      1.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Sufficiently Clear \n5    Plaintiff argues that the COPS Office has not crafted the immigration-related factors so \n6  the City can “clearly understand” them (Doc. 7-1 at 17-18).  In truth, however, there is nothing \n7  “ambiguous” about the Illegal Immigration focus area or the access and notice factors, and \n8  applicants can choose those factors “knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their \n9  [choices].”  Dole, 483 U.S. at 207; cf. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 794 (1989) \n10  (noting that “perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required even of regulations \n11  that restrict expressive activity”). \n12    In describing focus areas for potential CHP applicants to choose from, the COPS Office \n13  provides brief examples of some specific activities an applicant could propose to perform in each \n14  focus area, but deliberately avoids telling applicants exactly what to do, so they can develop their \n      \n15  own approaches and tactics based on local conditions and their local law enforcement expertise.  \n16  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 8.  For example, in offering Drug Abuse as a potential focus area for FY 2017, \n17  the Office simply asked applicants to “specify [their] focus on education, prevention, and \n18  intervention to combat drug use and abuse (e.g. marijuana, heroin, prescription opioids, etc.).”  Id.  \n19  Similarly, in giving potential applicants the option of focusing on Illegal Immigration, the Office \n20  asked interested jurisdictions to “specify [their] focus on partnering with federal law enforcement \n21  to combat illegal immigration through information sharing, 287(g) partnerships, task forces and \n22  honoring detainers.”  Id. ¶ 24.     \n23    As in its Separation of Powers argument, plaintiff confuses assisting federal authorities in \n24  the enforcement of immigration law with having state and local officers serve as “federal immi-\n25  gration officers” under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g) (Doc. 7-1 at 18).  “[P]artnering with federal law \n26  enforcement to combat illegal immigration” – in whatever specific way an applicant might \n27 \n                                              \n28    5 Although plaintiff repeatedly characterizes the access and notice factors as “require-\nments” (Doc. 7-1 at 10, 16, 25), they are actually scoring factors, not “requirements.” \n       19\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 26 of 32   Page ID #:816\n \n1  propose – will not require comprehensive knowledge of the “significant complexities” of federal \n2  immigration law (id.).  And if an applicant proposed a Section 287(g) partnership under the \n3  Illegal Immigration focus area and a 287(g) agreement were reached, any necessary training \n4  could be provided in the context of that lawful agreement.   \n5    Finally, to the extent the access and notice factors were unclear to Los Angeles (or any \n6  other jurisdiction), the COPS Office made clear in its letter announcing them that applicants were \n7  free to contact the Office with questions.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 28.6  The Office received numerous \n8  inquiries, some of which it referred to its Legal Division, but Los Angeles apparently did not \n9  inquire.  Id.  Plaintiff now objects that California law requires informing detainees that they may \n10  refuse to meet with federal immigration authorities, and that “[i]t is not clear” how the notice \n11  factor would apply “in the context of short-term detention operations, like LAPD’s, in which \n12  ‘scheduled release’ is generally not a relevant concept” (Doc. 7-1 at 19).  As the COPS Office has \n13  made clear in this filing – and as it would have made clear to Los Angeles had it asked these \n14  questions before – the Office does not understand these factors to forbid a jurisdiction from \n      \n15  informing detainees, where required by law, that they may choose not to meet with federal \n16  immigration authorities, or to require that a jurisdiction notify DHS before the release of a non-\n17  citizen under short-term detention whose release time is unknown.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 26.  \n18  Plaintiff’s concerns are unfounded. \n \n19 \n    2.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Sufficiently  \n      Related to the Purposes of the COPS Hiring Program \n20 \n  Plaintiff also argues that the immigration-related factors are not “reasonably related” to \n21 \nthe goals of the COPS Hiring Program (Doc. 17-1 at 16).  But this aspect of Dole suggests only a \n22 \n“possible ground” for invalidating an enactment, and does not impose an “exacting standard”: \n23 \n \n24  The Supreme Court has suggested that federal grants conditioned on compliance \n25                                                \n  6 As described earlier, to satisfy those factors, a jurisdiction must implement regulations \n26 \nor policies to ensure that DHS has access to the jurisdiction’s correctional or detention facilities \n“to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right \n27 \nto be or to remain in the United States,” and that DHS receives “advance notice as early as \n28  practicable (at least 48 hours, where possible) . . . regarding the scheduled release date and time \nof an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody” when requested.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 25 & Ex. B.   \n       20\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 27 of 32   Page ID #:817\n \n1  with federal directives might be illegitimate if the conditions share no relationship \nto the federal interest in particular national projects or programs.  This possible \n2 \nground for invalidating a Spending Clause statute, which only suggests that the \nlegislation might be illegitimate without demonstrating a nexus between the \n3 \nconditions and a specified national interest, is a far cry from imposing an exacting \n4  standard for relatedness. \n5  Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Dole, 483 U.S. at 207).   \n6  Thus, conditions on federal funding must only “bear some relationship to the purpose of the \n7  federal spending.”  314 F.3d at 1067 (quoting New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167 \n8  (1992)); see Barbour v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 374 F.3d 1161, 1168 (D.C. Cir. \n9  2004) (noting that Supreme Court has never “overturned Spending Clause legislation on \n10  relatedness grounds”). \n11    The immigration considerations at issue here easily meet this standard (assuming they are \n12  “conditions” at all).  Congress established the COPS Hiring Program to promote “community-\n13  oriented policing,” 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2), “to increase police presence, to expand and \n14  improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and members of the community \n      \n15  to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise to enhance public safety,” Pub. L. No. \n16  103-322, Title I, § 10003(a), 108 Stat. 1808 (1994).  Assisting in the enforcement of immigration \n17  law helps achieve these goals.  The COPS Office believes that the intersection of illegal immigra-\n18  tion and crime is a serious public safety issue that can be addressed most effectively through \n19  community policing.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 29.  This is also reflected in Congress’s desire, expressed \n20  in the INA, to make immigration enforcement a cooperative endeavor among federal, state, and \n21  local law enforcement agencies.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g) (providing for formal agreements \n22  under which state and local officers may function as federal immigration officers); see also id. § \n23  1324(c) (authorizing state and local officers to make arrests for violations of the INA’s \n24  prohibition against smuggling, transporting, or harboring aliens); id. § 1252c (authorizing state \n25  and local officers to arrest certain felons who have unlawfully returned to the United States).   \n26    The access and notice factors relate only to non-citizens who are under detention; almost \n27  invariably, those will be people who have either committed crimes or who are suspected of \n28  having committed crimes.  See Dorr Decl. ¶ 29.  Working with the Federal Government to \n       21\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 28 of 32   Page ID #:818\n \n1  enforce federal immigration law against aliens who are criminals or suspected criminals makes \n2  communities safer.  Id.  The immigration-related factors at issue directly advance the purposes of \n3  the COPS Hiring Program.  They thus easily clear the low bar of bearing “some relationship” to \n4  those purposes.  See Mayweathers, 314 F.3d at 1067.  Indeed, Los Angeles itself acknowledges \n5  that there is a relationship between immigration enforcement and public safety (see Doc. 7-1 at 9, \n6  22).   \n \n7 \n  C.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Consistent  \n    with the Administrative Procedure Act \n8 \n  Plaintiff’s final claim is that the immigration-related factors are “arbitrary and capricious \n9 \n[and] not in accordance with law” under the Administrative Procedure Act (Doc. 7-1 at 20-21).  5 \n10 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The Court of Appeals has held in numerous cases that “[a]n agency action is \n11 \narbitrary and capricious only if the agency relied on factors Congress did not intend it to consider, \n12 \nentirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, or offered an explanation that runs \n13 \ncounter to the evidence before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a \n14 \n       difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  E.g., All. for the Wild Rockies v. Peña, \n15 \n865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2017) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \n16 \nchallenged factors in the COPS Hiring Program violate none of these parameters. \n17 \n  As detailed above, Congress established the COPS Hiring Program to promote public \n18 \nsafety and community-oriented policing, and thus intended the Department of Justice to consider \n19 \nthose aims in awarding grants.  Those goals are enhanced by facilitating federal access to non-\n20 \ncitizens who have violated federal immigration law and who have violated, or are suspected of \n21 \nviolating, state or local criminal laws.  Nothing in the statutes governing CHP suggests the \n22 \nDepartment should not consider the extent to which a jurisdiction cooperates in the enforcement \n23 \nof federal immigration law when exercising its discretion to disseminate scarce federal resources. \n24 \n  Los Angeles asserts that public safety is best served by pursuing “policies against engag-\n25 \ning in federal civil immigration enforcement” and that “enmeshing LAPD in civil immigration \n26 \nenforcement would erode community trust and undermine public safety” (Doc. 7-1 at 9, 22).  For \n27 \nthis reason, plaintiff contends, it “did not identify ‘Illegal Immigration’ as a focus area of its grant \n28 \n       22\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 29 of 32   Page ID #:819\n \n1  [application]” application and did not certify compliance with the access and notice factors (Doc. \n2  7-1 at 10).  But those assertions only reflect a “difference in view” with the Federal Government \n3  regarding how best to promote public safety.  See All. for the Wild Rockies, 865 F.3d at 1217.  \n4  Los Angeles is entitled to its views; but its disagreement does not establish a violation of the \n5  Administrative Procedure Act. \n6  III.  The City Fails to Establish Irreparable Harm Absent Preliminary Relief \n7    For the same reason Los Angeles does not have standing, it cannot establish that it will \n8  suffer irreparable harm – a threshold requirement for a preliminary injunction.  As the attached \n9  declaration from the COPS Office explains, even if Los Angeles were correct that the immigra-\n10  tion considerations are unlawful and cannot be considered, it still would not receive any CHP \n11  funding this year.  The City has thus failed to establish it will suffer any harm – much less \n12  irreparable harm – absent preliminary relief.  Its failure to satisfy this “crucial” requirement in \n13  securing a preliminary injunction is alone sufficient basis to deny relief.  Miller ex rel. NLRB v. \n14  California Pac. Med. Ctr., 991 F.2d 536, 543 (9th Cir. 1993).  \n      \n15    Plaintiff seems to suggest that being at a “disadvantage” in the competition for COPS \n16  funding is itself irreparable injury (Doc. 7-1 at 21-22).  But none of the decisions it cites hold that \n17  merely being considered under (allegedly) improper factors in a grant program constitutes \n18  irreparable harm requiring emergency judicial relief.  For example, the case that plaintiff cites for \n19  the proposition that “[a] rule putting plaintiffs at a competitive disadvantage constitutes irrepar-\n20  able harm,” Int’l Franchise Ass’n v. City of Seattle, 803 F.3d 389 (9th Cir. 2015), involved a city \n21  ordinance that subjected certain businesses to a steeper schedule for incremental minimum-wage \n22  increases than other businesses.  Id. at 397-98.  Businesses subject to the steeper schedule sought \n23  a preliminary injunction against the ordinance, and the court held that plaintiffs’ “competitive \n24  injury” compared to other businesses constituted irreparable harm.  Id. at 411.  Similarly, another \n25  case cited by the plaintiff, Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of \n26  Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656 (1993), had nothing to do with irreparable harm.  Rather, it dealt with \n27  a city ordinance that accorded preferential treatment to certain minority-owned businesses in the \n28  award of city contracts.  Id. at 658-59.  An organization of non-minority building contractors \n       23\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 30 of 32   Page ID #:820\n \n1  challenged the ordinance, and the Seventh Circuit held that plaintiffs had failed to show the \n2  injury-in-fact needed for standing.  Id. at 664.  The Supreme Court reversed, holding that when a \n3  person’s constitutional right to equal protection is at stake, “the denial of equal treatment resulting \n4  from the imposition of [a] barrier” in the bidding process is itself a cognizable injury for standing \n5  purposes.  Id. at 666.    \n6    The competitive injuries recognized in those cases do not exist here, however.  The courts \n7  readily accept that “competitive harm” to ongoing business interests can supply standing and be \n8  relevant in determining an appropriate remedy.  See, e.g., Viceroy Gold Corp. v. Aubry, 75 F.3d \n9  482, 488 (9th Cir. 1996); Wilcox v. First Interstate Bank of Or., N.A., 815 F.2d 522, 529 (9th Cir. \n10  1987).  But here, the plaintiff cannot complain of competitive harm to any business interests.  \n11  Rather, plaintiff’s only possible harm is losing a grant – one it would not win regardless. \n12  IV.  The Public Interest and the Balance of Equities Militate Against an Injunction \n13    Lastly, a party seeking a preliminary injunction must “establish . . . that the balance of \n14  equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  \n      \n15  These factors merge in a suit against the Federal Government.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \n16  (2009).  Here, the public interest weighs heavily against plaintiff’s attempt to enjoin statutorily \n17  authorized Executive Branch policies that are designed to promote enforcement of federal \n18  immigration law in jurisdictions that receive federal law enforcement funds.  Courts have \n19  routinely held that “[t]he United States has an interest in enforcing federal law . . . .”  Sec’y of \n20  Labor v. Fitzsimmons, 805 F.2d 682, 693 (7th Cir. 1986) (emphasis omitted).  The City’s \n21  requested relief threatens, in particular, “the public interest in the speedy and effective \n22  enforcement of the immigration laws . . . .”  Sofinet v. INS, 188 F.3d 703, 708 (7th Cir. 1999). \n23    As discussed in the accompanying declaration from DHS, the challenged CHP scoring \n24  factors – especially the access and notice factors – promote these interests by, for example, \n25  minimizing potentially hazardous public safety situations that may arise where criminal aliens are \n26  released into the community, minimizing officer safety risk by limiting potentially dangerous \n27  arrest situations, and promoting operational efficiency by conserving the resources needed by \n28  DHS to execute its mission.  See Declaration of Jim Brown ¶¶ 6-11 (Attachment 2 hereto).  At \n       24\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 31 of 32   Page ID #:821\n \n1  bottom, encouraging cooperation between local governments and DHS promotes the public \n2  interest in executing federal laws that require removal of criminal aliens.  Id.  These concrete \n3  interests tip the relevant equities sharply against the injunction sought here. \n4  V.  Any Injunction Herein Should Be Limited to the Plaintiff \n5    The proposed order on plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction would prohibit the \n6  COPS Office from relying on immigration-related factors across the board (Doc. 7-5).  If this \n7  Court were to conclude, however, that Los Angeles had satisfied the requirements for preliminary \n8  relief, any injunction should be limited to the plaintiff rather than applying to all CHP \n9  applicants.  “[A]n injunction must be narrowly tailored to affect only those persons over which \n10  [the court] has power, and to remedy only the specific harms shown by the plaintiffs, rather than \n11  to enjoin all possible breaches of the law.”  Price v. City of Stockton, 390 F.3d 1105, 1117 (9th \n12  Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, courts routinely deny requests for \n13  nationwide injunctive relief.  See Skydive Arizona, Inc. v. Quattrocchi, 673 F.3d 1105, 1116 (9th \n14  Cir. 2012) (affirming district court’s refusal to grant nationwide relief). \n      \n15    Moreover, Los Angeles has vigorously objected to the entry of a nationwide injunction in \n16  an analogous situation.  In Texas v. United States, the Fifth Circuit affirmed a nationwide injunc-\n17  tion against programs allowing certain non-citizens to remain in the United States.  809 F.3d 134 \n18  (5th Cir. 2015).  In an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court, Los Angeles and other jurisdic-\n19  tions urged the Court to vacate the injunction because the plaintiffs had failed “to establish injury \n20  sufficient to enjoin the [programs] nationwide.”  See Brief for Amici Curiae, United States v. \n21  Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (No. 15-674), 2016 WL 891345, at *20 (Attachment 3 hereto).  \n22  The City and its fellow amici argued that, to justify “an expansive nationwide injunction,” the \n23  plaintiffs there would have to “establish standing to justify the scope of the injunction.”  Id. at \n24  *19, *30.  In this case, the plaintiff has not even attempted to establish standing to seek a nation-\n25  wide injunction against the use of immigration-related factors in the COPS Hiring Program.  By \n26  its own arguments, any preliminary injunction herein should be limited to Los Angeles. \n27  CONCLUSION \n28    Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction should be denied.   \n       25\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 33   Filed 10/12/17   Page 32 of 32   Page ID #:822\n \n1  Dated:  October 12, 2017 \n \n2 \n              Respectfully submitted, \n \n3 \n              CHAD A.

Since 2013, an average of nearly \n8  1,300 law enforcement agencies have requested funding through CHP each year – \n9  requests that far exceed the available funds appropriated by Congress.  To ensure \n10  that these limited funds are allocated sensibly, Congress gave the Department of \n11  Justice (“DOJ”) broad discretion to determine which jurisdictions should receive \n12  CHP funding.  DOJ exercises that discretion to promote and support public safety \n13  objectives. \n14    DOJ’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (“COPS Office” or \n  \n15  “Office”) awards CHP grants.  To apply for funding, an agency must submit an \n16  application that (1) provides information about the jurisdiction’s needs and \n17  practices and (2) explains how the jurisdiction intends to utilize the new officers it \n18  will hire using CHP funds.  The COPS Office scores the applications according to \n19  both the comparative needs of the applicants and metrics that emphasize the Federal \n20  Government’s enforcement priorities in any given year.  To that end, every year the \n21  Office selects several key “focus areas” for law enforcement and gives extra points \n22  to applications that focus on those areas.  Over time, those focus areas have \n23  changed to reflect differing law enforcement priorities and pressing needs, ranging \n24  broadly from Homicide to Homeland Security to “Children Exposed to Violence.” \n25    For Fiscal Year 2017, the COPS Office included two new law-enforcement \n26  related immigration factors in its scoring system.  First, one of the focus areas was \n27  “Illegal Immigration,” such that applicants could earn extra points by proposing \n28  ways to contribute to combatting illegal immigration.  Second, applicants could \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 12 of 36   Page ID #:1469\n \n1  earn extra points by adopting policies to ensure (1) that the Department of \n2  Homeland Security (“DHS”) has access to the applicant’s detention facilities to \n3  meet with aliens who have, or may have, committed crimes, and (2) that upon its \n4  request, DHS receives advance notice of the scheduled release of a criminal alien in \n5  the jurisdiction’s custody. \n6    Los Angeles challenges the “decision” to include these factors in the FY \n7  2017 application and scoring system (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 85, 112, 128), claiming it was ultra \n8  vires and violated the Separation of Powers, limitations on the Spending Power, and \n9  the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  The City’s claims regarding that \n10  decision, however, are non-justiciable.  As the accompanying declaration makes \n11  clear, Los Angeles would not have received CHP funding this year even if all points \n12  related to illegal immigration had been excluded, such that the City has no legally \n13  cognizable interest in the FY 2017 factors.  Moreover, to the extent plaintiff seeks \n14  to rely on any interest in whatever factors will be used in the FY 2018 grant cycle, \n      \n15  its claims would be non-justiciable because one cannot assume that Los Angeles \n16  will seek a CHP grant at that time or that the same factors will be used.  \n17    But even if plaintiff’s claims were otherwise cognizable, they would fail on \n18  the merits.  The statutes give DOJ broad discretion to allocate scarce CHP funds \n19  among the many applicants that seek them, such that the Office was not acting ultra \n20  vires or encroaching on the congressional sphere.  As for the Spending Clause, the \n21  immigration-related factors – which were mere scoring criteria rather than condi-\n22  tions on federal funds – were unambiguous and clearly related to the CHP’s \n23  purposes.  The COPS Office offered to answer any questions from potential \n24  applicants (an offer Los Angeles did not accept), and facilitating federal access to \n25  criminal aliens in local custody promotes public safety.  Finally, as for plaintiff’s \n26  APA claim, the factors were consistent with the CHP’s purposes, and nothing in the \n27  statute suggests these factors are off limits.  Plaintiff may have a “difference in \n28  view,” but that is not an APA violation.  See, e.g., All. for the Wild Rockies v. Peña, \n       2\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 13 of 36   Page ID #:1470\n \n1  865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2017). \n2    For these reasons, plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment should be \n3  denied, and judgment should be entered dismissing Counts Four, Five, and Six of \n4  plaintiff’s Complaint.1 \n5  STATUTORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE BACKGROUND \n6  I.  COPS Hiring Program and the COPS Office \n7    A.  Governing Statutes and Creation of the Program \n8    In the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Congress \n9  authorized the Attorney General to “make grants to States, units of local \n10  government, [and] Indian tribal governments . . . to increase police presence, to \n11  expand and improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and \n12  members of the community to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise \n13  to enhance public safety.”  Pub. L. No. 103-322, Title I, § 10003(a), 108 Stat. 1808 \n14  (1994).  As later amended and currently codified, the statute provides authority to \n      \n15  make grants for any of several specific purposes, including –  \n \n16 \n  (1) to rehire law enforcement officers who have been laid off as \n17  a result of State, tribal, or local budget reductions for deployment in \ncommunity-oriented policing; [and] \n18 \n  (2) to hire and train new, additional career law enforcement \n19  officers for deployment in community-oriented policing across the \nNation, including by prioritizing the hiring and training of \n20 \nveterans . . . . \n21 \n34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2). \n22 \n  The Attorney General created the COPS Office to administer grants under \n23 \nthis enactment.  See Declaration of Andrew A. Dorr ¶ 2 (“Dorr Decl.”).  The Office \n24 \nis headed by a Director appointed by the Attorney General.  Id.; 28 C.F.R. §§ 0.119, \n25 \n                                              \n26 \n  1 Counts One, Two and Three relate to a different program, the Edward \n27  Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.  This Court has stayed proceed-\nings on those claims pending developments in City of Chicago v. Sessions, No. 17-\n28 \n2991 (7th Cir.). \n       3\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 14 of 36   Page ID #:1471\n \n1  0.120.  The COPS Office began implementing 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1) and (b)(2) \n2  in 1994.  Initially, the Office operated two programs, one for large grantees and one \n3  for small grantees.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 5.  The programs were combined in 1995 under the \n4  name Universal Hiring Program (“UHP”), which was renamed the COPS Hiring \n5  Program in 2010.  Id. \n6    Under CHP, the COPS Office makes grants to state and local governments to \n7  hire, rehire, or train law enforcement officers for deployment in “community-\n8  oriented policing.”  Id. ¶¶ 5, 7.  A COPS Hiring Program grant is discretionary, id. \n9  ¶ 4 – that is, it is a grant “for which the federal awarding agency generally may \n10  select the recipient from among all eligible recipients, may decide to make or not \n11  make an award based on the programmatic, technical, or scientific content of an \n12  application, and can decide the amount of funding to be awarded.”  See Discre-\n13  tionary Grant, Grant Terminology, https://www.grants.gov/ web/ grants/ learn-\n14  grants/ grant-terminology.html (last visited Jan. 11, 2018).  Discretionary grants \n      \n15  differ from formula grants, under which a “statutory device” “determines who the \n16  recipients are and how much money each shall receive.”  City of Los Angeles v. \n17  McLaughlin, 865 F.2d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir. 1989) (citation omitted). \n18    The operation of the CHP – like all other COPS Office programs – is subject \n19  to annual appropriations by Congress.  Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.  Each year, Congress \n20  appropriates a certain amount “for the hiring and rehiring of additional career law \n21  enforcement officers” under the Program.  See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 114-113, 129 Stat. \n22  2242, 2310-11 (2015); Pub. Law No. 113-235, 128 Stat. 2130, 2196 (2014).2  Those \n23  appropriated amounts have decreased over the last several years, making CHP \n24  increasingly competitive.  Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.  Each year, the applications that the \n25  COPS Office receives seek more funds than Congress has appropriated.  Id. ¶ 13. \n                                              \n26 \n  2 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b) provides statutory authority for several other potential \n27  grants, 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(3) - (22), but Congress has never appropriated funds \nfor most of them and, therefore, the COPS Office has never offered grants under \n28 \nmost of them.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 6.  \n       4\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 15 of 36   Page ID #:1472\n \n1    The statute sets forth certain specific requirements for the Program.  For \n2  example, the Office must award at least 0.5% of the available funding to grantees \n3  within any State that has eligible applicants (which helps ensure that smaller States \n4  are not excluded), 34 U.S.C. § 10381(f); Dorr Decl. ¶ 9; the Office must allocate \n5  50% of each year’s available funds to jurisdictions with a population over 150,000 \n6  and 50% of the funds to jurisdictions with lower population, 34 U.S.C. § 10381(h); \n7  see id. § 10261(a)(11)(B); and each grantee must provide a portion of the money \n8  used to hire or rehire officer that CHP funds, subject to discretionary waiver by the \n9  Attorney General, id. § 10381(g).  \n10    B.  Scoring Applications and Selecting Grantees \n11    Other than these broad rules, the statutes governing the Program do not \n12  prescribe any particular method or factors for evaluating applications or choosing \n13  which applications to fund.  Therefore, the COPS Office must necessarily exercise \n14  judgment and discretion in choosing among applications.  The Office has developed \n      \n15  methods to evaluate and score applications to determine how best to allocate the \n16  Program’s finite funds, and those scoring factors change from time to time to reflect \n17  varying public safety priorities.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 14.   \n18    A jurisdiction seeking a CHP grant submits an electronic application on the \n19  COPS Office web site.  Id. ¶ 10.  The application is part of a system that assigns a \n20  specific number of points for each answer given.  Id. ¶ 15.  Some of the factors that \n21  the Office uses in scoring are reflected in the statutes.  For example, the statute \n22  states that applicants “shall . . . demonstrate a specific public safety need [and] \n23  explain the applicant’s inability to address the need without Federal assistance.”  34 \n24  U.S.C. § 10382(c)(2), (3).  The Office has implemented this directive by requesting \n25  data reflecting each applicant’s crime statistics and financial need and by according \n26  extra points based on higher crime rates and comparatively greater fiscal need.  \n27  Dorr Decl. ¶ 16.  Similarly, the system scores the quality of the applicant’s \n28  community policing plan pursuant to the statutory requirement that applicants \n       5\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 16 of 36   Page ID #:1473\n \n1  “explain how the grant will be utilized to reorient the affected law enforcement \n2  agency’s mission toward community-oriented policing or enhance its involvement \n3  in or commitment to community-oriented policing.”  Id.; 34 U.S.C. § 10382(c)(10). \n4    Most of the factors that the COPS Office has historically used to score are \n5  adopted as an exercise of the Office’s discretion to evaluate applications and \n6  distribute scarce funding.  The Office has employed such discretionary factors since \n7  the inception of the Program, and Congress has continued to appropriate funding \n8  each year with a complete understanding of how the Office administers it.  The \n9  Office exercises its discretion through several mechanisms, without which the \n10  program’s limited funding could not be rationally awarded. \n11    First, each year, the COPS Office designates several broad areas of public \n12  safety and community policing, and applicants must indicate which areas their \n13  activities will support.  And each year, the Office prioritizes certain of the available \n14  areas; applicants that select those focus areas receive extra points in the system.  \n      \n15  Dorr Decl. ¶ 18.  The available areas and the focus areas have changed over the \n16  years, reflecting changes in both national law enforcement necessities and DOJ \n17  priorities.  For example, in FY 2014, after the Newtown (Conn.) Police Department \n18  failed to score high enough to receive a CHP grant after the 2012 Sandy Hook \n19  shooting, the COPS Office added a “catastrophic event” question and assigned it \n20  the highest level of extra points to ensure that the Office could assist agencies \n21  afflicted by unexpected catastrophes like that shooting.  Id.  For FY 2017, the \n22  available areas were Child and Youth Safety Focus; Child and Youth Safety Focus: \n23  School Based Policing; Illegal Immigration; Drug Abuse; Homeland Security \n24  Problems; Non-Violent Crime Problems and Quality-of-Life Policing; Building \n25  Trust and Respect; Traffic/Pedestrian Safety Problems; and Violent Crime \n26  Problems.  Id. ¶ 7.  Consistent with the statute, the areas often reflect priorities for \n27  which “cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies” at the federal and \n28 \n       6\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 17 of 36   Page ID #:1474\n \n1  local levels can be beneficial.   \n2    Second, certain questions on the CHP application that do not relate to focus \n3  areas are awarded more points than other questions based on their significance to \n4  advancing community policing or other law enforcement priorities.  Id. ¶ 18.  For \n5  example, the system accords extra points for certain management practices, \n6  including the regular assessment of employee satisfaction, the exercise of flexibility \n7  shift assignments to facilitate addressing problems, and the operation of an “early \n8  intervention system” to identify officers showing signs of stress.  Id.  Additionally, \n9  from FY 2013 through FY 2016, the COPS Office, based on the Attorney General’s \n10  priorities, assigned extra points for jurisdictions that preferred military veterans in \n11  hiring officers with CHP funds, although no such preference was then mandated in \n12  the statute.  Id. ¶ 19; see Pub. L. No. 115-37, 131 Stat. 854 (2017) (expressly \n13  authorizing “prioritizing the hiring and training of veterans”). \n14    Third, each individual factor on the application falls into one of three \n      \n15  categories:  Fiscal Health, Crime, or Community Policing.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 20.  After \n16  calculating each applicant’s raw scores, the Office gives different weights to the \n17  applicant’s scores in each of these categories, based on the Attorney General’s \n18  priorities and the needs of public safety.  Id.  For most years, the Fiscal Health \n19  category has been weighted as 20% of the final score, the Crime category has been \n20  weighted as 30% of the final score, and the Community Policing category has been \n21  weighted as 50% of the final score.  Id.  The Office changes these percentages from \n22  time to time.  In FY 2009, for example, in light of the fiscal issues that resulted in \n23  enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Office \n24  accorded 50% of the weighting to the “Fiscal Health” category.  Id. \n25    C.  Factors Related to Enforcement of Immigration Laws \n26    Beginning with Fiscal Year 2016, certain immigration-related requirements \n27  and scoring factors have been included in the COPS Hiring Program. \n28    CHP grantees, like all federal grantees, are required to comply with all \n       7\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 18 of 36   Page ID #:1475\n \n1  applicable federal laws.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 23.  Beginning with FY 2016, the Office has \n2  advised each applicant that this requirement includes compliance with 8 U.S.C. \n3  § 1373, which provides that “a Federal, State, or local government entity or official \n4  may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from \n5  sending to, or receiving from, [federal immigration authorities] information regard-\n6  ing the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.”  8 \n7  U.S.C. § 1373(a); Dorr Decl. ¶ 23.  In FY 2017, the Office required applicants to \n8  certify compliance with Section 1373 as a threshold eligibility requirement, \n9  although there was no scoring associated with it.  Id. \n10    For FY 2017, the priority areas on the CHP application included proposals \n11  that prioritized addressing problems with violent crime; those that focused on \n12  homeland security, such as protecting critical infrastructure; and those that focused \n13  on contributing to the control of illegal immigration or cooperating with federal \n14  authorities in enforcing immigration law.  Id. ¶ 18.  Thus, the system assigned extra \n      \n15  points for focusing on Illegal Immigration, although it also gave an equal or greater \n16  number of points for focusing on other specified areas.  Id. ¶ 24.  Seven jurisdic-\n17  tions chose Illegal Immigration as the focus area of their FY 2017 applications, but \n18  none scored high enough to receive funding prior to the addition of any points \n19  attributable to the access-and-notice factors described below.  Id.3 \n20    Lastly, beginning in FY 2017, the COPS Office offered applicants the \n21  opportunity to receive additional points by certifying that the applicant had \n22  implemented or would implement regulations or policies to ensure (1) that DHS \n23  would have access to the applicant’s detention facilities “to meet with an alien (or \n24  an individual believed to be an alien) and inquire as to his or her right to be or to \n25  remain in the United States,” and (2) that the applicant’s detention facilities would \n                                              \n26 \n3 Defendants’ opposition to plaintiff’s preliminary injunction motion stated \n27  that none of the applicants that chose Illegal Immigration scored high enough to \nreceive an award.  Shortly before the filing of the present motion, however, the \n28 \nCOPS Office realized that statement was in error.  Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 30-35 & n.5. \n       8\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 19 of 36   Page ID #:1476\n \n1  “provide advance notice as early as practicable (at least 48 hours, where possible) \n2  to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdic-\n3  tion’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the \n4  alien.”  Id. ¶ 25.  To inform applicants of the opportunity to receive points based on \n5  these factors, the Office electronically sent each applicant a letter, certification \n6  form, and background documents.  Id. ¶ 27 & Ex. B.  These materials stated that the \n7  certification would not commit applicants to detain any individuals beyond their \n8  scheduled time of release and that applicants would not be penalized if they did not \n9  operate detention facilities.  Id. ¶ 27.  A jurisdiction’s certification regarding these \n10  factors did not forbid the jurisdiction from informing detainees that they may \n11  choose not to meet with federal immigration authorities where the jurisdiction’s \n12  laws required providing that information.  Id. ¶ 26.  Nor did the certification require \n13  a jurisdiction to notify DHS before releasing an alien under short-term detention \n14  with an unknown release time.  Id.   \n      \n15  II.  Immigration and Nationality Act \n16    Enforcement of the immigration laws, including and especially the investiga-\n17  tion and apprehension of criminal aliens, is a quintessential law enforcement \n18  function.  Through the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. §§ \n19  1101-07, Congress granted the Executive Branch significant authority to control the \n20  conduct of foreign nationals in the United States.  These responsibilities are \n21  assigned to law enforcement agencies, as the INA authorizes DHS, DOJ, and other \n22  Executive agencies to administer and enforce the immigration laws.  The INA \n23  permits the Executive Branch to exercise considerable discretion to direct enforce-\n24  ment pursuant to federal policy objectives.  See, e.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 \n25  U.S. 387, 396 (2012).   \n26    The INA includes several provisions that protect the ability of federal \n27  officials to investigate the status of aliens and otherwise enforce the immigration \n28  laws.  For example, the statute provides that a federal immigration officer “shall \n       9\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 20 of 36   Page ID #:1477\n \n1  have power without warrant . . . to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an \n2  alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(1).  \n3  Separately, as noted above, 8 U.S.C. § 1373 provides that “a Federal, State, or local \n4  government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any govern-\n5  ment entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, [federal authorities] \n6  information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of \n7  any individual.”  Id. § 1373(a).  The INA provides that certain classes of aliens \n8  shall be removed from the United States upon the order of the Attorney General or \n9  the Secretary of Homeland Security.  See, e.g., id. §§ 1227(a), 1228. \n10    The INA also establishes immigration enforcement as a cooperative endeavor \n11  among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.  See, e.g., id. § 1357(g) \n12  (providing that DHS may enter into formal agreements with states and localities \n13  under which trained and qualified state and local officers may perform specified \n14  functions of a federal immigration officer); see also id. § 1324(c) (authorizing state \n      \n15  and local officers to make arrests for violations of the INA’s prohibition against \n16  smuggling aliens); id. § 1252c (authorizing state and local officers to arrest certain \n17  felons who have unlawfully returned to the United States).   \n18  III.  Los Angeles’s CHP/UHP Applications and Grants \n19    Since 1995, Los Angeles has applied for grants under the CHP or its \n20  predecessor nine times – in Fiscal Years 1995, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2009, 2011, 2012, \n21  2016, and 2017.  The 2011 and 2017 applications were denied, and the others were \n22  granted.  Dorr Decl. ¶¶ 30-32.  The City’s application for FY 2017 was denied \n23  because it scored below those of other large-population jurisdictions, even without \n24  regard to any immigration-related factors.  Id. ¶ 32.  The COPS Office has now \n25  completed reviewing all of the CHP applications for FY 2017, and has awarded all \n26  of the available CHP funds.  Id. ¶ 33. \n27  IV.  Procedural History \n28    Plaintiff commenced this action on September 29, 2017, and simultaneously \n       10\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 21 of 36   Page ID #:1478\n \n1  filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin use of the immigration-\n2  related scoring factors for FY 2017 (Doc. 7-1).  Defendants’ opposition to the \n3  motion explained that Los Angeles would not receive a CHP grant even without \n4  regarding to those factors (Doc. 33), and plaintiff withdrew its motion (Doc. 37). \n5  ARGUMENT \n6    A party may file a motion for summary judgment “at any time” until after the \n7  close of discovery.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(b).  “The court shall grant summary \n8  judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material \n9  fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n10  56(a).  A party may file a motion for summary judgment without having filed an \n11  answer, and the filing of such a motion tolls the time to answer.  See Mann v. Lee, \n12  No. C 07-00781 MMC (PR), 2009 WL 5178095, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 22, \n13  2009). \n14    In light of the governing statutes and the language of the challenged scoring \n      \n15  factors, “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the [defendants are] \n16  entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Plaintiff’s claims regarding the CHP are \n17  non-justiciable because it lacks a cognizable interest in the decisions to include \n18  immigration-related factors.  Alternatively, even if plaintiff’s claims were \n19  cognizable, they would be without merit.  Thus, plaintiff’s motion for partial \n20  summary judgment should be denied, and judgment should be entered for the \n21  defendants on these claims.4 \n22  I.  All of Plaintiff’s Claims Must Be Dismissed as Non-Justiciable \n23    Article III of the Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to live “Cases” \n24  and “Controversies.”  To satisfy the “irreducible constitutional minimum” of \n25 \n                                              \n  4 Even if this Court were to conclude that Los Angeles had established a right \n26 \nto judgment, any injunction should be limited to the plaintiff rather than applying to \n27  all CHP applicants.  See Price v. City of Stockton, 390 F.3d 1105, 1117 (9th Cir. \n2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Skydive Arizona, Inc. v. \n28 \nQuattrocchi, 673 F.3d 1105, 1116 (9th Cir. 2012). \n       11\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 22 of 36   Page ID #:1479\n \n1  standing to sue, a plaintiff must demonstrate an “injury in fact,” a “fairly traceable” \n2  causal connection between the injury and defendant’s conduct, and redressability.  \n3  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102-03 (1998).  Further, to \n4  establish standing to seek equitable relief, the plaintiff must show a likelihood of \n5  future injury.  See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983).  In Lyons, for \n6  example, the Supreme Court held that there was no “real and immediate threat” that \n7  the plaintiff would be subjected to certain police conduct in the future.  Id. at 105.  \n8  Thus, “the speculative nature of [plaintiff’s] claim that he [would] again experience \n9  injury” deprived him of standing.  Id. at 109.  This rule applies regardless of the \n10  type of equitable relief sought – whether declaratory or injunctive.  See Brown v. \n11  Or. Dep’t of Corr., 751 F.3d 983, 990 (9th Cir. 2014); Canatella v. California, 304 \n12  F.3d 843, 852 (9th Cir. 2002). \n13    Under these principles, plaintiff’s claims regarding the CHP factors must be \n14  dismissed as non-justiciable, whether focused forward on the eventual FY 2018 \n      \n15  factors or backward on the FY 2017 factors.5  Plaintiff purports to rely on a \n16  “competitive disadvantage . . . in future grant cycles” for CHP funds (Doc. 49 at \n17  23), and to seek declaratory and injunctive relief to eliminate that future “disadvan-\n18  tage.”  See Complaint at 39-40 (Doc. 1).  As noted above, however, Los Angeles \n19  has applied for CHP or UHP grants only nine times during the twenty-three years of \n20  the program’s existence.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 36.  Moreover, the focus areas and other \n21  scoring factors that the Office uses in selecting among applications change from \n22  time to time, and the Office has not determined the focus areas for FY 2018 or how \n23  immigration-related factors will be handled in the FY 2018 application.  Id. ¶¶ 14, \n24  18, 24, 29. \n25    In light of these circumstances, plaintiff lacks a cognizable “injury in fact” in \n                                              \n26 \n  5 Additionally, to the extent plaintiff seeks to challenge whatever factors the \n27  Office may decide to use in the FY 2018 grant season, the City’s claim under the \nAPA should be dismissed for lack of “final” agency action.  5 U.S.C. § 704.  See \n28 \nCal. Sea Urchin Comm’n v. Bean, 828 F.3d 1046, 1049 (9th Cir. 2016).  \n       12\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 23 of 36   Page ID #:1480\n \n1  relation to future grant cycles.  Plaintiff’s case for standing necessarily assumes \n2  both that it will seek a CHP grant in FY 2018 and that the same challenged factors \n3  will be used at that time.  Both assumptions are fatally “speculative.”  Lyons, 461 \n4  U.S. at 109.  Thus, there is no “real and immediate threat” that plaintiff will again \n5  be subjected to the scoring factors challenged here, and all of plaintiff’s claims \n6  must be dismissed for lack of Article III standing.  Id. at 105. \n7    Moreover, to the extent plaintiff relies on any interest in the FY 2017 scoring \n8  factors, its claims have become moot.  See Sanford v. MemberWorks, Inc., 625 F.3d \n9  550, 556 (9th Cir. 2010) (stating that the “requisite personal interest that must exist \n10  at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its \n11  existence (mootness)”) (quoting U.S. Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, \n12  397 (1980)).  Plaintiff would not have received a FY 2017 award regardless of \n13  those factors, and the COPS Office has awarded all 2017 funds; thus, the City can \n14  have no legally cognizable interest in the FY 2017 factors.  Also, the “capable-of-\n      \n15  repetition” exception (Doc. 49-1 at 10 n.4) cannot apply here because it requires “a \n16  reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same \n17  action again.”  See Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17 (1998) (internal quotation \n18  marks omitted).  There is no such “reasonable expectation,” especially given that \n19  Los Angeles has applied for CHP/UHP grants only nine times during the program’s \n20  twenty-three years – 39% of the time.  \n \n21 \nII.  Alternatively, the Court Should Enter Judgment for  \n22    Defendants on the Merits \n \n23 \n  A.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Consistent  \n24      with the Governing Statutes  \n25    Plaintiff’s Count Four alleges that the COPS Office acted beyond its \n26  authority and encroached upon that of Congress in adopting immigration-related \n27  factors in the CHP.  In this case, at least, the concepts of statutory authority and \n28  separation of powers are two ways of looking at the same issue.  Article I of the \n       13\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 24 of 36   Page ID #:1481\n \n1  Constitution confers on Congress the authority to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, \n2  Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and \n3  general Welfare of the United States.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  In exercising \n4  this power, Congress may – and often does – delegate to the Executive Branch the \n5  authority to make decisions regarding the expenditure of funds.  See, e.g., Clinton v. \n6  City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 488 (1998) (“Congress has frequently delegated \n7  the President the authority to spend, or not to spend, particular sums of money.”).  \n8    The Executive Branch is responsible for implementing the law.  The \n9  Supreme Court has held that an Executive “officer may be said to act ultra vires \n10  only when he acts without any authority whatever.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. \n11  v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101 n.11 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n12  Thus, claims that an agency has used its authority erroneously or inappropriately \n13  are insufficient to state an ultra vires claim.  Rather, ultra vires claims must be \n14  based on an “officer’s lack of delegated power”; merely claiming an “error in the \n      \n15  exercise of that power is . . . not sufficient.”  Larson v. Domestic & Foreign \n16  Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 690 (1949) (emphasis added).   \n17    Here, the Department of Justice, acting through the COPS Office, is \n18  responsible for disseminating the scarce funds appropriated under 34 U.S.C. \n19  § 10381(b)(1) and (b)(2).  The statute gives the Office discretion in disseminating \n20  those funds, and the inadequacy of the available funds to cover all applications \n21  requires DOJ to adopt and employ factors to rank and choose among them.  \n22  Although the statute imposes certain requirements on disseminating CHP funding, \n23  those requirements are only broad guidelines that are too general to actually \n24  allocate the awards.  Congress gave DOJ discretion to fill in the gaps.    \n25    By statute, CHP funds must be used to hire, rehire, and train officers “for \n26  deployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  The \n27  statute also provides a broad framework for DOJ’s discretionary awards.  \n28  Recognizing that there would likely not be enough money to fund every applicant, \n       14\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 25 of 36   Page ID #:1482\n \n1  Congress required that at least 0.5% of available funding be awarded to the grantees \n2  within any State that has eligible applicants, id. § 10381(f), that DOJ equally \n3  allocate the available funds between large and small jurisdictions, id. § 10381(h); \n4  id. § 10261(a)(11)(B), and that DOJ generally require local jurisdictions to provide \n5  matching funds, id. § 10381(g).  Congress also specified that each application must, \n6  among other things, “demonstrate a specific public safety need,” “explain the \n7  applicant’s inability to address the need without Federal assistance,” and “explain \n8  how the grant will be utilized to reorient the [applicant’s] mission toward \n9  community-oriented policing or enhance its involvement in or commitment to \n10  community-oriented policing.”  Id. § 10382(c)(2), (3), (10).     \n11    Beyond these basic requirements, the statute provides no comprehensive \n12  framework or formula for choosing among the many jurisdictions that satisfy the \n13  requirements.  Indeed, the statute does not even direct DOJ to prioritize applications \n14  that show the greatest “public safety need,” the most dire “inability to address the \n      \n15  need without Federal assistance,” or the greatest ability or willingness “to reorient \n16  the [applicant’s] mission toward community-oriented policing.”  It instead leaves \n17  the details to DOJ, which means the COPS Office must either choose the winning \n18  applicants via random lottery – an irrational method that losing applicants would \n19  surely challenge as arbitrary and capricious – or develop a logical method of select-\n20  ing worthy applicants that represents a reasonable exercise of DOJ’s discretion.  By \n21  taking the latter course, the Office is not encroaching on Congress.  It is simply \n22  filling in gaps that Congress delegated for it to fill, no doubt because Congress \n23  wanted DOJ to use its law-enforcement expertise to award these grants in ways that \n24  best promote Congress’s broad goal of making our communities safer through \n25  community-oriented policing.  Cf. United States v. Dang, 488 F.3d 1135, 1140 (9th \n26  Cir. 2007) (“Here, a plain reading of the statute indicates that Congress intended to \n27  leave a statutory gap for the administrative agency to fill.”).   \n28    Plaintiff’s arguments do not establish a right to judgment on the Separation \n       15\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 26 of 36   Page ID #:1483\n \n1  of Powers or ultra vires claim.  First, the discretionary considerations set forth at 34 \n2  U.S.C. § 10381(c) are not mandatory considerations, let alone exhaustive ones \n3  (Doc. 49-1 at 13).  They are, rather, bases on which “the Attorney General may give \n4  preferential consideration, where feasible.”  Id. (emphasis added).  And these \n5  factors obviously are not exhaustive, because merely prioritizing jurisdictions that \n6  provide greater than 25% matching funds, id. § 10381(c)(1), or that have certain \n7  laws related to child sex trafficking, id. § 10381(c)(2)-(3), would not be sufficient \n8  to allocate limited CHP funding among the many applicants.  Congress’s inclusion \n9  of a few factors that the Office “may” consider plainly does not foreclose the Office \n10  from developing additional factors to guide how it awards these discretionary \n11  grants.  See Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003).6 \n12    Over the last twenty-three years, the COPS Office has used many \n13  discretionary factors, not expressly reflected in the statute, to identify which \n14  applicants are most deserving of COPS hiring grants.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 18-20.  For \n      \n15  example, the statute says nothing about prioritizing different areas of public safety \n16  from year to year, which is an obvious means of directing priorities and distributing \n17  funds logically and equitably.  Id. ¶ 18.  Nor does the statute expressly direct the \n18  Office to favor localities that have recently experienced a catastrophic event (like \n19  the 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino, California, which resulted in a FY 2016 \n20  grant to that city’s police department), or to assign extra points for exercising \n21  flexibility in shift assignments, or for attempting to identify officers showing signs \n22  of stress.  Id.  Nor did the statute mandate the Office’s military veteran preference \n23  until Congress added it in 2017.  Id. ¶ 19.  In short, since Congress created the CHP \n24  discretionary grant program, DOJ has exercised its discretion to develop and use a \n25 \n                                              \n  6 This is confirmed by the fact that Congress added the human-trafficking \n26 \nprovisions only in 2015.  See Pub. L. No. 114-22, § 1002, 129 Stat. 227, 266-67 \n27  (2015).  If plaintiff’s construction of the statute were correct, prior to 2015, the \nCOPS Office would have been limited to ranking applicants based on a jurisdic-\n28 \ntion’s willingness to exceed the minimum matching requirement. \n       16\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 27 of 36   Page ID #:1484\n \n1  variety of factors to award funding.  The factors at issue here are just the latest \n2  example of that broad discretion.  If plaintiff’s theory were correct, all of these \n3  discretionary actions over the years – from prioritizing mass shootings to stressing \n4  officer safety – would have to be deemed ultra vires.  And Congress, knowing of \n5  this (purportedly) ultra vires activity, would have to be deemed to have ignored it \n6  repeatedly by appropriating funding for the program every year without restriction. \n7    Second, plaintiff misreads the statute in arguing that most of the factors on \n8  which the Office relies are not among the alleged “detailed list of twenty-two \n9  purposes” for the program in 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1) through (22) (Doc. 49-1 at \n10  17).  The COPS Hiring Program is authorized by only the first two paragraphs of \n11  Section 10381(b), which authorize providing grants for hiring, rehiring, and train-\n12  ing law enforcement officers “for deployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 \n13  U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  That language is reflected in Congress’s annual \n14  appropriations, which provide funds specifically “for the hiring and rehiring of \n      \n15  additional career law enforcement officers.”  See, e.g., Pub. Law No. 113-235, 128 \n16  Stat. 2130, 2196 (2014).  The other paragraphs of Section 10381(b) authorize other \n17  potential grants, when appropriated by Congress, such as grants “to establish \n18  innovative programs to reduce, and keep to a minimum, the amount of time that law \n19  enforcement officers must be away from the community while awaiting court \n20  appearances” or “to support the purchase by a law enforcement agency of no more \n21  than 1 service weapon per officer.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(10), (16).  Congress has \n22  never appropriated money to fund those other grants, and accordingly the COPS \n23  Office does not award funds for those purposes.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 6.7 \n24    Third, the challenged factors in the COPS Hiring Program do not \n25 \n                                              \n26 \n  7 Quoting subsection (a) of 34 U.S.C. § 10381, plaintiff argues that the \n27  statute Act created “a single grant program” (Doc. 49-1 at 19).  However, regard-\nless of whether subsections (b)(1) through (b)(22) are characterized as having \n28 \nauthorized  twenty-two potential programs or one program with twenty-two \n       17\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 28 of 36   Page ID #:1485\n \n1  impermissibly exercise “direction, supervision, or control over any police force or \n2  any other criminal justice agency” in violation of 34 U.S.C. § 10228 (contra Doc. \n3  7-1 at 14-15).  Merely encouraging cooperation with federal authorities by giving \n4  additional points as one portion of a broader scoring system to administer a discre-\n5  tionary program does not exercise “direction, supervision, or control.”  Indeed, \n6  concurrent with the enactment of 34 U.S.C. § 10228, Congress created the National \n7  Institute of Justice, see Pub. L. No. 96-157, §§ 202, 815, 93 Stat. 1167 (1979), \n8  which has as one of its express statutory purposes “to develop programs and \n9  projects . . . to improve and expand cooperation among the Federal Government, \n10  States, and units of local government . . . .”  34 U.S.C. § 10122(c)(2)(F). \n11    Fourth, Section 287(g) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(3), does not limit the \n12  means by which a state or local government can assist in the enforcement of immi-\n13  gration law or prohibit the COPS Office from assigning extra points to jurisdictions \n14  that opt to assist federal immigration enforcement (contra Doc. 49-1 at 17-18 & \n      \n15  n.5).  As the Supreme Court has observed, Section 287(g) only delineates some of \n16  the circumstances under which “state officers may perform the functions of an \n17  immigration officer,” Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 408 (2012), which \n18  include arresting aliens for “entering or attempting to enter the United States in \n19  violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the \n20  admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2).  No \n21  formal agreement is required for state and local officers to assist in other ways, such \n22  as by providing access to aliens they have detained or informing federal authorities \n23  of the impending release of such persons where practical.8 \n                                              \n24 \npotential purposes, the statute, in practice, is funded as one program with essentially \n25  one purpose. \n8 Also, although a willingness to enter into an agreement under that provision \n26 \nmay accord a CHP applicant additional points in the scoring process, any funds \n27  awarded would have to be used to hire or rehire officers pursuant to the require-\nments of the Program, not for any state or local expenses of such an agreement.  \n28 \nDorr Decl. ¶ 24 n.2. \n       18\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 29 of 36   Page ID #:1486\n \n1    Fifth, nothing in the governing statutes or case law prohibits DOJ from using \n2  scoring factors that “encourage states to pass laws or enact policies or practices that \n3  the federal government favors” (Doc. 49-1 at 13-15).9  Indeed, the Supreme Court \n4  has made clear that a federal agency can use grant conditions as a “relatively mild \n5  encouragement” for States and localities to change their laws and policies, \n6  including statutes on subjects like the purchase of alcohol.  See S. Dakota v. Dole, \n7  483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987).  Moreover, many of the other scoring factors in the CHP \n8  – factors not challenged here and never challenged elsewhere – “encourage” \n9  potential grantees to change their laws or policies, such as according extra points \n10  for exercising flexibility in shift assignments and for operating an “early interven-\n11  tion system” to identify officers showing signs of stress.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 18.   \n12    Sixth, the “clear statement” rule in Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 461 \n13  (1991), does not apply to the development and use of scoring factors in the COPS \n14  Hiring Program (contra Doc. 49-1 at 14).  In Gregory, the Court addressed whether \n      \n15  federal law would override a state constitutional provision requiring judges to retire \n16  at age seventy.  Id. at 455-61.  The Court held that it would not “upset the usual \n17  constitutional balance of federal and state powers” without a “clear statement” from \n18  Congress.  Id. at 460-61.  But this case does not involve overriding state or local \n19  law.  It is, rather, simply the latest iteration of an over-two-decades-old \n20 \n                                              \n21    9 Nor does the legislative history limit the COPS Office’s discretion (contra \nDoc. 49-1 at 15).  Indeed, that history supports the addition of the factors chal-\n22 \nlenged here.  The portion of the history quoted by the plaintiff reads in full:  “In \n23  establishing funding levels and selection criteria for these grants, the Attorney \nGeneral is expected to take into account local needs, costs, and other factors.  It is \n24 \ncontemplated . . . that the Attorney General will consider a wide range of relevant \n25  criteria, including – among other factors – the needs of areas with high crime rates, \nlow officer to population ratios, understaffing of law enforcement agencies in \n26 \nrelation to the size of the geographic areas for which they are responsible, high \n27  unemployment and economic dislocation rates that may contribute to increased \ncrime problems, and other relevant trends.”  H.R. Rep. No. 103-324 at 10 \n28 \n(emphasis added). \n       19\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 30 of 36   Page ID #:1487\n \n1  discretionary program that gives state and local agencies an opportunity to focus on \n2  federal enforcement priorities and thereby increase their chances of receiving a \n3  grant.  Nothing in this voluntary program risks “overriding” Los Angeles law.   \n \n4 \n  B.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Consistent  \n5      with the Spending Clause \n6    Plaintiff’s Count Five alleges that the challenge factors exceed federal power \n7  under the Spending Clause.10  As the Supreme Court has held, “Congress may \n8  attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds, and has repeatedly employed the \n9  power to further broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys \n10  upon compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and administrative \n11  directives.”  Dole, 483 U.S. at 206 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n12    The Court in Dole described certain limitations or potential limitations on the \n13  spending power.  Among other things, conditions on the receipt of federal funds \n14  must be stated “unambiguously” so that recipients can “exercise their choice \n      \n15  knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.”  Id. at 207.  Also, \n16  the Court observed, “our cases have suggested (without significant elaboration) that \n17  conditions on federal grants might be illegitimate if they are unrelated to the federal \n18  interest in particular national projects or programs.”  Id. at 207-08 (internal quota-\n19  tion marks omitted).  Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges that the challenged factors \n20  violate both of these aspects of Dole (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 124-125).  Although plaintiff now \n21                                                \n  10 Although the heading of Count Five also mentions the Tenth Amendment, \n22 \nit does not otherwise allege that the CHP factors violate that amendment (Doc. 1 at \n23  38-39).  In any event, such a claim would be without merit.  This case does not \ninvolve any direct federal mandate, but rather factors in the award or denial of a \n24 \ngrant that the City is free to accept or reject.  Moreover, the courts have rejected \n25  Tenth Amendment challenges to a number of federal statutes, including 8 U.S.C. § \n1373, that regulated the handling of information.  See City of New York v. United \n26 \nStates, 179 F.3d 29, 35 (2d Cir. 1999) (rejecting Tenth Amendment challenge to \n27  Section 1373); City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp. 3d 933 (N.D. Ill. 2017) \n(same); see also Reno v. Condon, 528 U.S. 141, 143-46, 149-150 (2000); Freilich v. \n28 \nUpper Chesapeake Health, Inc., 313 F.3d 205, 213-14 (4th Cir. 2002). \n       20\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 31 of 36   Page ID #:1488\n \n1  says it “does not intend to press” its allegation of ambiguity in light of post-\n2  Complaint developments (Doc. 49-1 at 20 n.6), plaintiff has not withdrawn that \n3  allegation.  In any event, assuming the challenged factors could be characterized as \n4  “conditions” at all, they satisfy these aspects of Dole.11  \n5      1.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Sufficiently Clear \n6    There is nothing “ambiguous” about the Illegal Immigration focus area or the \n7  access and notice factors, and applicants can choose those factors “knowingly, \n8  cognizant of the consequences of their [choices].”  Dole, 483 U.S. at 207.  In \n9  describing focus areas for potential applicants to choose from in FY 2017, the \n10  COPS Office provided brief examples of some specific activities an applicant could \n11  propose to perform in each area, but deliberately avoided telling applicants exactly \n12  what to do, so they could develop their own approaches and tactics based on local \n13  conditions and their local law enforcement expertise.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 8.  For example, \n14  in offering Drug Abuse as a potential focus area, the Office simply asked applicants \n      \n15  to “specify [their] focus on education, prevention, and intervention to combat drug \n16  use and abuse (e.g. marijuana, heroin, prescription opioids, etc.).”  Id.  Similarly, in \n17  giving potential applicants the option of focusing on Illegal Immigration, the Office \n18  asked interested jurisdictions to “specify [their] focus on partnering with federal \n19  law enforcement to combat illegal immigration through information sharing, 287(g) \n20  partnerships, task forces and honoring detainers.”  Id. ¶ 24.     \n21    In any event, to the extent the access and notice factors were unclear to Los \n22 \n                                              \n23    11 Contrary to plaintiff’s argument, the challenged factors cannot be \ncharacterized as “conditions” on the basis that an applicant unwilling to satisfy \n24 \nthem is “less likely” to receive a grant (contra Doc. 49-1 at 18-19).  As explained \n25  already, these factors are only a few among many factors used in selecting among \napplicants.  Indeed, choosing “Illegal Immigration” as a focus area in the FY 2017 \n26 \ncycle did not guarantee receipt of an award, and many jurisdictions that neither \n27  chose that focus area nor executed the access-and-notice certification were awarded \nfunds.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 33.  For the same reasons, the scoring factors cannot fairly be \n28 \ncalled “requirements” (contra Doc. 49-1 at 9, 12, 13, 19, 20 n.6). \n       21\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 32 of 36   Page ID #:1489\n \n1  Angeles (or any other jurisdiction), the COPS Office made clear that applicants \n2  were free to contact the Office with questions.  Id. ¶ 28.  The Office received \n3  numerous inquiries, some of which it referred to its Legal Division, but Los \n4  Angeles apparently did not inquire.  Id.  Plaintiff objects that state law requires \n5  informing detainees that they may refuse to meet with federal immigration \n6  authorities, and that it “cannot determine” how the access and notice factors would \n7  apply “in the context of short-term detention operations, like LAPD’s” (Doc. 1 \n8  ¶¶ 65-66).  As the Office has made clear in this filing – and as it would have made \n9  clear to Los Angeles had it asked these questions before – the Office does not \n10  understand these factors to forbid a jurisdiction from informing detainees, where \n11  required by law, that they may choose not to meet with immigration authorities, or \n12  to require that a jurisdiction notify DHS before the release of an alien under short-\n13  term detention whose release time is unknown.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 26.   \n \n14 \n           2.  The Immigration-Related Factors Are Sufficiently  \n15        Related to the Purposes of the COPS Hiring Program \n16    Plaintiff also argues that the challenged factors are not “reasonably related” \n17  to the goals of the CHP (Doc. 49-1 at 18).  But this aspect of Dole suggests only a \n18  “possible ground” for invalidating an enactment, and does not impose an “exacting \n19  standard”: \n \n20 \nThe Supreme Court has suggested that federal grants conditioned on \n21  compliance with federal directives might be illegitimate if the \nconditions share no relationship to the federal interest in particular \n22 \nnational projects or programs.  This possible ground for invalidating a \n23  Spending Clause statute, which only suggests that the legislation might \nbe illegitimate without demonstrating a nexus between the conditions \n24 \nand a specified national interest, is a far cry from imposing an exacting \n25  standard for relatedness. \n26  Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir. 2002).  Thus, conditions \n27  on federal funding must only “bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal \n28  spending.”  Id.; see Barbour v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 374 F.3d \n       22\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 33 of 36   Page ID #:1490\n \n1  1161, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (noting that Supreme Court has never “overturned \n2  Spending Clause legislation on relatedness grounds”). \n3    The factors at issue here easily meet this standard (assuming they are \n4  “conditions” at all).  Congress established the CHP to promote “community-\n5  oriented policing,” 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2), “to increase police presence, to \n6  expand and improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and \n7  members of the community to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise \n8  to enhance public safety,” Pub. L. No. 103-322, Title I, § 10003(a), 108 Stat. 1808 \n9  (1994) (emphasis added).  Assisting in the enforcement of immigration law helps \n10  achieve these goals.  The COPS Office believes the intersection of illegal immigra-\n11  tion and crime is a serious public safety issue that can be helpfully addressed \n12  through “cooperative efforts” among federal, state, and local law enforcement.  \n13  Dorr Decl. ¶ 29.  Indeed, Congress codified this very principle in the INA.  See, \n14  e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g) (providing for formal agreements under which state and \n      \n15  local officers may function as federal immigration officers); see also id. § 1324(c) \n16  (authorizing state and local officers to make arrests for violations of the INA’s \n17  prohibition against smuggling aliens); id. § 1252c (authorizing state and local \n18  officers to arrest certain felons who have unlawfully returned to the United States).   \n19    The access and notice factors relate to aliens who are under detention and \n20  who have either committed crimes or are suspected of having committed crimes.  \n21  Dorr Decl. ¶ 29.  Cooperating with the Federal Government by providing basic \n22  information and access allows effective enforcement of federal immigration law \n23  against aliens who are criminals or suspected criminals and makes communities \n24  safer.  Id.  The factors at issue directly advance the purposes of the CHP.  They thus \n25  easily clear the low bar of bearing “some relationship” to those purposes.  See \n26  Mayweathers, 314 F.3d at 1067.   \n27 \n28 \n       23\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 34 of 36   Page ID #:1491\n \n1    C.  The Challenged Factors Are Consistent with the APA \n2    Plaintiff’s final claim, in Count Six, is that the decision to include the chal-\n3  lenged factors for FY 2017 was “arbitrary and capricious [and] not in accordance \n4  with law” in violation of the APA.  This claim is also without merit.  The Court of \n5  Appeals has “described the arbitrary and capricious standard as deferential and \n6  narrow, establishing a high threshold for setting aside agency action.”  Alaska Oil \n7  & Gas Ass’n v. Jewell, 815 F.3d 544, 554 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks \n8  omitted).  Under this standard, a court “presume[es] the agency action to be valid \n9  and affirm[s] the agency action if a reasonable basis exists for its decision.”  Indep. \n10  Acceptance Co. v. California, 204 F.3d 1247, 1251 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal \n11  quotation marks omitted).  The court has also held in numerous cases that “[a]n \n12  agency action is arbitrary and capricious only if the agency relied on factors \n13  Congress did not intend it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important \n14  aspect of the problem, or offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence \n      \n15  before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in \n16  view or the product of agency expertise.”  E.g., All. for the Wild Rockies v. Peña, \n17  865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This \n18  review is even more deferential where, as here, the question relates to the interpre-\n19  tation of a statute the defendants are responsible for administering, especially where \n20  gaps in the statute require the agency to exercise discretion.  See Wash. Dep’t of \n21  Ecology v. EPA, 752 F.2d 1465, 1469 (9th Cir. 1985) (“By leaving a gap in the \n22  statute, Congress implicitly has delegated policy-making authority to the agency.”). \n23    The challenged factors violate none of these parameters.   As detailed above, \n24  Congress established the CHP to promote public safety, cooperation among law \n25  enforcement agencies, and community-oriented policing, and thus intended DOJ to \n26  consider those aims in awarding grants.  Those goals are enhanced by facilitating \n27  federal access to aliens who have violated immigration law and who have violated, \n28  or are suspected of violating, state or local criminal laws.  Nothing in the statutes \n       24\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 35 of 36   Page ID #:1492\n \n1  governing CHP suggests DOJ should not consider the extent to which a jurisdiction \n2  cooperates in the enforcement of immigration law when exercising its discretion to \n3  disseminate scarce federal resources.  Thus, the scoring factors have more than a \n4  “reasonable basis” and easily satisfy the “deferential and narrow” APA standard.  \n5  Indep. Acceptance Co., 204 F.3d at 1251; Alaska Oil & Gas Ass’n, 815 F.3d at 554.  \n6  This is especially true given that the COPS Office must necessarily develop and \n7  apply means of choosing among applicants beyond those stated in the statute. \n8    In response, plaintiff argues that the challenged factors are arbitrary and \n9  capricious because defendants have not presented “tangible evidence” to support \n10  them (Doc. 49-1 at 21).  But the City misunderstands the nature of APA review.  As \n11  noted already, this standard is satisfied if there is a “reasonable basis” for the \n12  agency’s decision, and the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the challenged \n13  action is arbitrary and capricious, not on the defendants to disprove plaintiff’s \n14  claim.  See Pierce v. SEC, 786 F.3d 1027, 1035 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Quechan Tribe of \n      \n15  Ft. Yuma Indian Reservation v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 927 F. Supp. 2d 921, 928 \n16  (S.D. Cal. 2013), aff’d, 673 F. App’x 709 (9th Cir. 2016). \n17     Moreover, in an apparent attempt to satisfy its burden, Los Angeles asserts \n18  that certain “studies show an inverse relationship” between violent crime and a \n19  refusal to cooperate with federal immigration authorities (Doc. 49-1 at 22).  On this \n20  basis, plaintiff contends that “DOJ’s policy actually undermines public safety” (id. \n21  at 23).  But those assertions only reflect a “difference in view” with the Federal \n22  Government regarding how best to promote public safety.  See All. for the Wild \n23  Rockies, 865 F.3d at 1217.  Los Angeles is entitled to its views, but its disagree-\n24  ment does not establish a violation of the APA. \n25  CONCLUSION \n26    Accordingly, plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment should be \n27  denied, and judgment should be entered for the defendants on Counts Four, Five, \n28  and Six.   \n       25\n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 36 of 36   Page ID #:1493\n \n1  Dated:  January 12, 2018 \n \n2 \n              Respectfully submitted, \n3   \n              CHAD A.

FISCAL YEAR 2017 BYRNE JAG CLAIMS \n3  On September 13, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiff City of Los Angeles (“City”) a \n4  preliminary injunction with respect to its claims that the immigration-related Notice and \n5  Access Conditions1 that Defendants imposed on the Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2017 Edward \n6  Byrne Memorial Justice Assistant Grant (“Byrne JAG”) program were unlawful.  ECF \n7  No. 93.  The Court held that the “Notice and Access Conditions exceed statutory \n8  authority, and trying to impose such conditions is a violation of the separation of powers \n9  doctrine and ultra vires.”  Id. at 4.  Defendants appealed this order (No. 18-56292).  On \n10  October 31, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Court’s preliminary \n11  injunction.  See City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 941 F.3d 931 (9th Cir. 2019).  The Ninth \n12  Circuit reasoned that the Notice and Access Conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG program \n13  awards were not authorized by statute and are therefore ultra vires.  Id. at 945.  \n14  Accordingly, the Court hereby ENTERS final judgment for the City with respect to the \n15  Notice and Access Conditions on the FY 2017 Byrne JAG program.  In addition, the \n16  Court hereby converts its preliminary injunction with respect to the Notice and Access \n17  Conditions on the FY 2017 Byrne JAG program, ECF No. 93, to a permanent injunction \n18  that prohibits Defendants from imposing or enforcing the 2017 Byrne JAG Notice and \n19 \n \n20 \n1 As relevant here, Defendants require the following: (1) “A local ordinance, -rule, -regulation, -policy, \nor -practice (or an applicable State statute, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice) must be in place that \n21 \nis designed to ensure that agents of the United States acting under color of federal law in fact are given \n22  access [to] a local-government (or local-government-contracted) correctional facility for the purpose of \npermitting such agents to meet with individuals who are (or are believed by such agents to be) \n23 \n[noncitizens] and to inquire as to such individuals’ right to be or remain in the United States” (“Access \nCondition”); and (2) “A local ordinance, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice (or an applicable State \n24 \nstatute, -rule, -regulation, -policy, or -practice) must be in place that is designed to ensure that, when a \nlocal-government (or local-government-contracted) correctional facility receives from [the Department \n25 \nof Homeland Security (“DHS”)] a formal written request authorized by the Immigration and Nationality \n26  Act that seeks advance notice of the scheduled release date and time for a particular [noncitizen] in such \nfacility, then such facility will honor such request and—as early as practicable . . . provide the requested \n27 \nnotice to DHS” (“Notice Condition”).

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that \n2  Defendants are PERMANENTLY ENJOINED from imposing, enforcing, or otherwise \n3  implementing the Notice and Access Conditions announced by the Justice Department on \n4  July 25, 2017, and subsequently modified by the Justice Department, in conjunction with \n5  Los Angeles’ FY 2017 Byrne JAG application and award. \n6  II.  FISCAL YEAR 2017 COPS HIRING PROGRAM CLAIMS \n7    On April 11, 2018, the Court granted summary judgment and a permanent \n8  injunction to the City on its claims that the immigration-related scoring considerations \n9  Defendants used in evaluating applications for the FY 2017 Community Oriented \n10  Policing Services (“COPS”) Hiring Program grant were unlawful.  ECF No. 75.  \n11  Defendants appealed this order (No. 18-55599), and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \n12  reversed the grant of summary judgment and the permanent injunction on July 12, 2019.  \n13  See City of Los Angeles v. Barr, 929 F.3d 1163 (9th Cir. 2019), reh’g denied, mandate \n14  issued (Dec. 17, 2019).  On December 20, 2019, Defendants filed an unopposed ex parte \n15  application to vacate the Court’s order granting summary judgment and a permanent \n16  injunction on the COPS claims.  See ECF No. 75 (order); ECF No. 112 (ex parte \n17  application to vacate).  On December 23, 2019, the Court ordered that its injunction of \n18  April 11, 2018 (ECF No. 75) be dissolved and vacated, effective immediately.  ECF No. \n19  113.  At the joint request of the parties, the Court now HEREBY ENTERS partial \n20  summary judgment in Defendants’ favor on Counts Four, Five, and Six of the City’s \n21  Complaint pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and those Counts \n22  are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.     \n23    IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n24    Dated:  March 20, 2020       \n25     \n                         \n26 \n                HON.

INTRODUCTION   \n2  This is a case about a federal agency abusing its power—offending the separation \n3  of powers and federalism all at once.  Congress created a grant program to support state \n4  and local governments in hiring officers for deployment in “community-oriented \n5  policing” (the “COPS Hiring Program” or “COPS”).  The U.S. Department of Justice \n6  (“DOJ”) is charged with administering that grant program.  DOJ’s stewardship over this \n7  program requires it to make discretionary judgments about what communities most need \n8  the money, what grant proposals are most likely to meet Congress’s goals, and other \n9  salient factors.  But Congress did not write DOJ a blank check.  DOJ cannot use its hold \n10  of the purse strings to pressure sovereign governments to change unrelated policies, or to \n11  misdirect funds away from the types of programs Congress directed DOJ to support. \n12  That is what DOJ has done in two unlawful manipulations of the COPS grant \n13  competition.  First, DOJ decided to award “additional consideration”—effectively bonus \n14  points—to applicants that adopt regulations, policies, and practices reflecting particular \n15  types of “partnership” with federal civil immigration authorities, and sign a “Certification \n16  of Illegal Immigration Cooperation.”  This necessarily means that communities that are \n17  not willing or able to certify that they have adopted these DOJ-preferred regulations or \n18  policies are disfavored in the grant process.  These disfavored communities are then less \n19  likely to receive federal support to hire officers for deployment in community-oriented \n20  policing.  This attempt to induce state and local governments to change their regulations, \n21  policies, and practices is directly contrary to DOJ’s statutory authority.  The COPS \n22  statute identifies just one narrow area (treatment of victims of human trafficking) where \n23  DOJ is authorized to favor applicants based on laws and policies unrelated to their use of \n24  grant funds.  DOJ plainly lacks broader authority to use the COPS grant program as \n25  leverage to extract policy concessions from state and local governments. \n26  Second, DOJ decided to award grants to applicants that focus on “Illegal \n27  Immigration”—and to give preferential treatment in the grant competition to applicants \n28  who choose that focus.  This too is unlawful.  No plausible interpretation of “community-\n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 9 of 33   Page ID #:1053\n \n1  oriented policing” includes participating in civil immigration enforcement.  Congress \n2  certainly does not think so; it enacted a detailed list of twenty-two statutory purposes it \n3  considered relevant to its goal of promoting community-oriented policing, and civil \n4  immigration enforcement is conspicuously absent.  DOJ’s attempt to fund state and local \n5  officers to perform the duties of federal civil immigration agents is not only contrary to \n6  the text and structure of the COPS statute, but squarely contradicts provisions of the \n7  immigration laws that DOJ purports to be championing. \n8  These forms of preferential treatment are no small detail.  In a recent press release \n9  announcing this year’s COPS awards, DOJ made clear that immigration-related \n10  considerations were critical to award decisions—and that the agency is treating its \n11  statutory mandate of promoting community-oriented policing as all but incidental.  See \n12  Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) Ex. H, DOJ, Office of Public Affairs, Attorney \n13  General Sessions Announces $98 Million To Hire Community Policing Officers (Nov. \n14  20, 2017) (“November Press Release”).   \n15  Defendants’ abuse of the COPS program must be rejected.  It is ultra vires and a \n16  violation of the separation of powers, it is an unconstitutional attempt to use Congress’s \n17  Spending Clause power, and it is arbitrary and capricious.  The Court should grant partial \n18  summary judgment and enter final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) \n19  in favor of Plaintiff on Counts Four, Five, and Six; declare that Defendants’ actions are \n20  unlawful; and enjoin them from administering the COPS program in this unlawful \n21  manner going forward. \n22 \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n23 \nA.  Congress Establishes the COPS Grant Program to Support the Hiring \n24  of Police Officers to Engage in Community-Oriented Policing.   \n25    Community-oriented policing, according to the component of DOJ responsible for \n26  promoting it, “begins with a commitment to building trust and mutual respect between \n27  police and communities.”  RJN Ex. A, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, \n28  “About”.  Congress created the COPS program to support state and local government \n2 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 10 of 33   Page ID #:1054\n \n1  efforts to engage in community-oriented policing.  To achieve that purpose, the COPS \n2  statute authorized the Attorney General to “make[] grants to States, units of local \n3  government, Indian tribal governments, other public and private entities, and multi-\n4  jurisdictional or regional consortia.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(a). \n5    Congress authorized the COPS program as a “single grant program” and \n6  enumerated twenty-two “purposes for which grants . . . may be made.”  Id. § 10381(b).  \n7  These purposes include “to rehire” and “to hire and train new” law enforcement officers \n8  “for deployment in community-oriented policing.”  Id. § 10381(b)(1), (2). \n9    DOJ administers the COPS grant program through its Office of Community \n10  Oriented Policing Services (“COPS Office”).  See Decl. of Stella Larracas, Ex. B, 2017 \n11  CHP Application Guide at 61.  The COPS Office administers several types of COPS \n12  programs each year, including the COPS Hiring Program (“CHP”) grant, which \n13  “provides funding directly to law enforcement agencies to hire and/or rehire career law \n14  enforcement officers in an effort to increase their community policing capacity and crime \n15  prevention efforts.”  Id. at 1, 7.  Each fiscal year, the COPS Office issues applications for \n16  the CHP grant and selects local government awardees to receive funds that can typically \n17  be used over a three-year period. \n18    Congress has generally not appropriated sufficient money to fund all of the grant \n19  requests the COPS Office receives.  Decl. of Andrew Dorr in Opposition to Plaintiff’s \n20  Motion for Preliminary Injunction, filed Oct. 12, 2017 (Doc. 33-1), at ¶ 12 (“Dorr. \n21  Decl.”).  The COPS Office has therefore created a scoring system tailored to the statutory \n22  purpose of awarding funds to communities that most need federal assistance to engage in \n23  community policing, and have the best plans for promoting that type of police work.  \n24  Thus, the Office awards points based on criteria falling in three categories: Fiscal Health, \n25  Crime, or Community Policing.  Id. ¶ 20.  “Community Policing” generally accounts for \n26  50% of the score, “Crime” for 30%, and “Fiscal Health” for 20%.  Id.   \n27    The COPS Office also generally allocates “additional consideration”—in the form \n28  of extra points under its scoring system—for specified reasons.  Applicants are directed \n3 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 11 of 33   Page ID #:1055\n \n1  to select particular “community policing problems or focus areas” that their proposed \n2  program will address, and the Office awards extra points to communities that select a \n3  focus area that is prioritized for that year.  See Larracas Decl., Ex. C, 2016 CHP \n4  Application Guide at 21; Dorr. Decl. ¶ 18 (“[T]he application system assigns extra points \n5  for applications that are focused on that year’s priority areas.”).  The COPS Office has in \n6  prior years also provided extra points under its scoring system to communities affected \n7  by an unanticipated catastrophic event, reflecting the heightened needs of such \n8  communities.  Larracas Decl., Ex. C, 2016 CHP Application Guide at 21. \n9    Congress has also authorized one basis for the COPS Office to award preferential \n10  consideration that does not relate to an applicant’s need for, or use of, COPS grant funds.  \n11  Section 10381(c) of the statute provides that DOJ “may” give an application “preferential \n12  consideration” if the applicant is in a state that has in effect particular types of laws that \n13  grant leniency to victims of human trafficking.  34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2), (3).  The COPS \n14  Office, acting on this express authorization, generally provides extra points to applicants \n15  in states with these congressionally-favored human trafficking laws.  See Larracas Decl. \n16  Ex. C, 2016 CHP Application Guide at 21. \n17    The COPS Office does not disclose the weight that individual factors are given in \n18  scoring, or the relative weight given to additional considerations in the overall scoring \n19  system.  See id.; Dorr Decl. ¶ 15.   \n20 \nB.  Defendants’ Attempts to Use Federal Funds as a Weapon to Pressure \n21  State and Local Governments to Participate in Federal Civil \nImmigration Enforcement. \n22 \n  Early in his presidency, President Donald J. Trump declared that he would use \n23 \nfederal funds as a “weapon” to require state and local support for his federal civil \n24 \nimmigration enforcement policies.1  His Administration has sought to make good on this \n25 \nannouncement by conditioning federal grants on state and local enforcement of federal \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n1 Harriet Taylor, Trump to Fox News: “I May Defund California as ‘a weapon’ to fight \n28  illegal immigration,” CNBC.com (Feb. 5, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/TaylorCNBC.   \n4 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 12 of 33   Page ID #:1056\n \n1  civil immigration law.  The Administration’s two prior attempts have thus far been \n2  enjoined as unconstitutional; the latest is the subject of this motion.   \n3    On January 25, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13768, directing the \n4  Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to withhold federal funds from \n5  what he called “Sanctuary Jurisdictions.”2  On November 20, 2017, a federal district \n6  court permanently enjoined Section 9(a) of the Executive Order, ruling that the order is \n7  unconstitutional, because: (1) the Executive Branch is attempting to usurp authority that \n8  belongs to Congress under the Spending Clause; (2) the order violates constitutional \n9  limits on federal spending authority; (3) the order violates the Tenth Amendment’s \n10  prohibition against commandeering local jurisdictions to administer a federal program; \n11  (4) the order is unconstitutionally vague; and (5) the order violates requirements of due \n12  process.  Cty. of Santa Clara v. Donald J. Trump; City and Cty. of San Francisco v. \n13  Trump, 2017 WL 5569835 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017).   \n14    DOJ then launched another effort to condition federal funds for states and localities \n15  on their participation in federal civil immigration enforcement, attempting to impose such \n16  conditions on receipt of funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance \n17  Grants (“Byrne JAG”) program.  Defendant Sessions announced in a press release that \n18  Byrne JAG grants would be awarded only to cities and states that, inter alia, “allow \n19  federal immigration access to detention facilities,” and “provide 48 hours notice before \n20  they release an illegal alien wanted by federal authorities.”  RJN Ex. B, DOJ, Office of \n21  Public Affairs, Attorney General Sessions Announces Immigration Compliance \n22  Requirements for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Programs (July 25, \n23  2017).  Again, this effort was rejected—by two different courts—as an overreach by DOJ \n24  of its statutory authority.  City of Chicago v. Sessions, 2017 WL 4081821 (N.D. Ill. Sept. \n25 \n                                                 \n26  2 The White House Office of the Press Secretary, “Executive Order: Enhancing the Public \nSafety on the Interior of the United States,” Whitehouse.gov (January 25, 2017), § 9(a), \n27 \navailable at https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/presidential-\n28  executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united.   \n5 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 13 of 33   Page ID #:1057\n \n1  15, 2017), appeal filed; City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 2017 WL 5489476 (E.D. Pa. \n2  Nov. 15, 2017).   \n3    Defendants now seek to use the COPS grant to pressure states and localities into \n4  changing their laws and policies, and otherwise participating in federal civil immigration \n5  enforcement.  In the fiscal year (“FY”) 2017 application cycle for the COPS grant \n6  program, the COPS Office added a “focus area” it called “Illegal Immigration.”  The \n7  Office described this focus area as involving “partnering with federal law enforcement to \n8  combat illegal immigration,” including by participating in “287(g) partnerships” and \n9  “honoring detainers.”  Dorr Decl. ¶ 24; see also Larracas Decl. Ex. B, 2017 CHP \n10  Application Guide at 27.3  Defendants did not just create this “Illegal Immigration” \n11  category as an available use of COPS grant funds, but encouraged applicants to select it \n12  by offering additional consideration in the form of extra points for that choice.  See \n13  Larracas Decl. Ex. B, 2017 CHP Application Guide at 27. \n14    Defendants further stated in the Application Guide that “[a]dditional consideration \n15  . . .  may  be given” to “applicants that partner with federal law enforcement to address \n16  illegal immigration.”  See id. at 27-28.  Defendants offered no additional explanation of \n17  this possibility until two months after the due date for grant applications.  Then, in early \n18 \n                                                 \n19 \n3 A “287(g) partnership” is a carefully limited and regulated statutory mechanism by \n20  which state and local police officers can be authorized to act as immigration officers.  See \n8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1).  “Honoring detainers,” though imprecise in its terminology, \n21 \npresumably refers to DHS’s practice of requesting state and local law enforcement to \n22  detain individuals who otherwise would be released, so that DHS can decide whether to \ntake custody and then do so.  See DHS, Form I-247A, Immigration Detainer-Notice of \n23 \nAction (2017).  Courts have held municipalities liable for violating the Fourth \n24  Amendment for “honoring detainers.”  See, e.g., Ochoa v. Campbell, 2017 WL 3476777 \nat *7, *14 (E.D. Wash. July 31, 2017), appeal filed, No. 17-35679; Santoyo v. United \n25 \nStates, 2017 WL 2896021 at **3-8 (W.D. Tex. June 5, 2017); Miranda-Olivares v. \n26  Clackamas Cty., 2014 WL 1414305 at *11 (D.

See Larracas Decl. Ex. A, E-mail from \n3  COPS Office (Sept. 7, 2017).  The e-mail attached a certification form that would have to \n4  be signed and returned within 12 days in order to qualify for the extra points. \n5    Defendants called the form “Certification of Illegal Immigration Cooperation,” and \n6  required it to be signed by the highest-ranking law enforcement official (e.g., police \n7  chief) and government executive (e.g., mayor).  Id.; see also id. Attachment 1.  These \n8  officials were required to certify versions of the “Access” and “Notice” requirements that \n9  DOJ has been enjoined from enforcing as conditions on Byrne JAG grants.  Specifically, \n10  an applicant was required to certify that it had implemented, or would implement, \n11  specific “rules, regulations, policies, and/or practices” relating to federal civil \n12  immigration enforcement: \n13 \n•  “The applicant entity and/or its governing body has implemented or, before \n14  drawing down grant funds if awarded, will implement rules, regulations, policies, \nand/or practices that ensure that U.S. Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’) \n15 \npersonnel have access to any of the governing body’s correctional or detention \n16  facilities in order to meet with an alien (or an individual believed to be an alien) \nand inquire as to his or her right to be or to remain in the United States.” (the \n17 \n“Access Requirement”) \n18 \n•  “The applicant entity and/or its governing body has implemented or, before \n19 \ndrawing down grant funds if awarded, will implement rules, regulations, policies, \nand/or practices that ensure that any of the governing body’s correctional and \n20 \ndetention facilities provide advance notice as early as practicable (at least 48 hours, \n21 \nwhere possible) to DHS regarding the scheduled release date and time of an alien \n22  in the jurisdiction’s custody when DHS requests such notice in order to take \ncustody of the alien. This certification does not require holding an alien beyond his \n23 \nor her scheduled time of release.”  (the “Notice Requirement”) \n24 \nId. Attachment 1.   \n25 \n  DOJ recognized that the effect of these changes to the COPS program was to give \n26 \n“additional consideration” to communities that “cooperate[d] with federal law \n27 \nenforcement to address illegal immigration.”  Id. at 1.

Los Angeles’ Applications for COPS Hiring Program Grant Funding. \n9 \n  Los Angeles has historically been a competitive applicant for COPS funds.  The \n10 \nCity applied for CHP grants in 2012 and 2016, and obtained grant funding in both years. \n11 \nLarracas Decl. ¶ 3.  In 2016, Los Angeles received one of the highest scores out of more \n12 \nthan one thousand applications.  Id. Ex. D, COPS Office, FY 2016 COPS Hiring Program \n13 \nApplicant Rankings. \n14 \n  In its FY 2017 application, Los Angeles applied for $3.125 million in CHP \n15 \nfunds—the same amount it received in 2016—to support hiring officers for its \n16 \nCommunity Safety Partnership (“CSP”) Program.  Larracas Decl. Ex. E, Los Angeles \n17 \n2017 CHP Application at 22.  The CSP program is a paradigmatic community-oriented \n18 \npolicing program.  It operates in selected public housing developments located \n19 \nthroughout the Los Angeles area.  The CSP program deploys officers to implement \n20 \nprograms for at-risk youth, ensure safe passage on school routes, and build relationships \n21 \nin the communities through neighborhood watch groups, quality of life committees, and \n22 \ncitizen-police enforcement teams.  Id. at 12.  In its application, Los Angeles identified \n23 \n“Building Trust and Respect” as the focus of its grant-supported program.  Id at 11.   \n24 \n  The City did not attempt to create a different program, unrelated to community-\n25 \noriented policing, in order to select “Illegal Immigration” as its focus area and receive \n26 \nextra points for its application.  In addition to its commitment to using grant funds for the \n27 \ncommunity policing purposes Congress intended, Los Angeles has made a longstanding \n28 \n8 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 16 of 33   Page ID #:1060\n \n1  decision that it can best protect public safety by not participating in federal civil \n2  immigration enforcement.  Specifically, Los Angeles has implemented “policies and \n3  practices designed to promote the public safety of all Los Angeles residents by \n4  engendering cooperation and trust between members of the City’s many immigrant \n5  communities and law enforcement.”  Decl. of Michael Hyams ¶ 4.  This includes the Los \n6  Angeles Police Department’s longstanding policy that “restricts an officer from initiating \n7  a police action with the objective of discovering a person’s immigration status, and also \n8  prohibits arrest based solely on civil immigration status.”  Id. ¶ 3. \n9    Los Angeles also did not submit a signed “Certification of Illegal Immigration \n10  Cooperation” in the twelve days it was allotted.  Los Angeles was unable to determine in \n11  that time whether DOJ would consider its detention facility practices to comply with the \n12  Access and Notice Requirements, or whether a “Certification of Illegal Immigration \n13  Cooperation,” bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Chief of the LAPD, would erode \n14  the community trust Los Angeles has long fostered.  Hyams Decl. ¶ 7.  Thus, because \n15  Los Angeles was unwilling to use a COPS grant in order to “partner[] with federal law \n16  enforcement to address illegal immigration,” Larracas Decl. Ex. B, 2017 CHP \n17  Application Guide at 28, or to complete a “Certification of Illegal Immigration \n18  Cooperation,” the deck was doubly stacked against the City in the competition for COPS \n19  funds. \n20    An official in the COPS Office has made the unsupported assertion that Los \n21  Angeles would not have received an FY 2017 grant even in the absence of the \n22  immigration-related considerations.  Dorr Decl. ¶ 32.  There is every reason to believe, \n23  however, that the COPS Office will continue to disfavor cities like Los Angeles in \n24  subsequent award decisions.  Indeed, in announcing FY 2017 awards, DOJ advertised \n25  that 80% of successful applicants completed the “Certification of Illegal Immigration \n26  Cooperation.”  See RJN Ex. H, November Press Release.  The City therefore seeks relief \n27  to restore an equal playing field for future grant cycles.  Specifically, Los Angeles seeks a \n28  declaration and an injunction preventing DOJ from giving applicants extra points if they \n9 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 17 of 33   Page ID #:1061\n \n1  adopt particular laws and policies supporting “Illegal Immigration Cooperation,” and if \n2  they commit to a grant-supported program involving partnership with federal authorities \n3  in combatting “Illegal Immigration.”4 \n4  III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n5  Rule 56 requires summary judgment be granted for the moving party where the \n6  evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, shows that there is \n7  no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment \n8  as a matter of law.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Tarin v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 123 F.3d \n9  1259, 1263 (9th Cir. 1997), superseded by statute on other grounds.  Partial summary \n10  judgment may be granted on particular claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \n11  Summary judgment is generally appropriate to decide challenges to administrative \n12  agency action that turn on the lawfulness of that action or whether, on the existing \n13  administrative record, the action is arbitrary and capricious.  See, e.g., City & Cty. of San \n14  Francisco v. United States, 130 F.3d 873, 877 (9th Cir. 1997) (“In reviewing an \n15  administrative agency decision, summary judgment is an appropriate mechanism for \n16 \n                                                 \n17 \n4 Los Angeles’ standing to bring this action is based on the uneven playing field \n18  Defendants created by favoring or disfavoring applicants on the basis of improper \nimmigration-related considerations.  This is precisely the sort of competitive injury that \n19 \nhas “often been recognized as grounds for standing.”  Bullfrog Films, Inc. v. Wick, 847 \n20  F.2d 502, 507 (9th Cir. 1988); see also Preston v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1359, 1365 (9th Cir. \n1984); Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 \n21 \nU.S. 656, 664-669 (1993) (summarizing competitive harm standing cases); Regents of the \n22  Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 281 n.14 (1978).   \n  The agency’s apparent decision not to award Los Angeles a grant in the 2017 cycle \n23 \ndoes not render Los Angeles’ claims moot.  The important issues raised by the City’s \n24  Complaint are capable of repetition in a manner that evades meaningful judicial review.  \nSee Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1969, 1976 (2016); \n25 \nWright & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 3533.8 (noting the “wide array of circumstances \n26  [that] have led courts to deny mootness” as capable of repetition yet evading review, \nincluding “disputes over the terms or awards of government contracts or grants [which] \n27 \noften involve short contract periods and repeat bidders”). \n28   \n10 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 18 of 33   Page ID #:1062\n \n1  deciding the legal question of whether the agency could reasonably have found the facts \n2  as it did.” (citation omitted)). \n3  IV.  ARGUMENT \n4  Defendants have transformed the COPS program from the one that Congress \n5  enacted.  Defendants are giving extra points in the application process to applicants that \n6  certify that they have in place particular regulations or policies reflecting what \n7  Defendants call “Illegal Immigration Cooperation.”  And Defendants are authorizing the \n8  use of grant funds for programs focusing not on community-oriented policing but on civil \n9  immigration enforcement—a job that belongs to the federal government—and giving \n10  extra points to applicants willing to adopt this focus.  Together, Plaintiff refers to these as \n11  the “Challenged Considerations.” \n12  The Challenged Considerations are unlawful.  First, they exceed the authority that \n13  Congress delegated to DOJ and thus violate the separation of powers.  Second, even if \n14  Congress had delegated to DOJ the authority to disfavor communities like Los Angeles \n15  on the basis of the Challenged Considerations, they would not pass constitutional muster \n16  under the Spending Clause.  Third, DOJ’s actions are arbitrary and capricious.       \n17 \nA.  The Challenged Considerations Are Ultra Vires and Violate the \n18  Separation of Powers. \n  An agency “has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon \n19 \nit.”  Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986).  The power \n20 \nconferred on DOJ in this case is to administer the COPS grant program to support state \n21 \nand local governments in hiring police officers to engage in community-oriented \n22 \npolicing.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381.  That authority certainly requires DOJ to exercise a \n23 \ndegree of discretion in determining how best to allocate the limited resources Congress \n24 \nappropriates for this statutory purpose.  But that discretion is not limitless.  “When \n25 \nCongress limits the purpose for which a grant can be made,” as it did with the COPS \n26 \nprogram, “it can be presumed that it intends that the dispersing agency make its \n27 \nallocations based on factors solely related to the goal of implementing the stated statutory \n28 \n11 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 19 of 33   Page ID #:1063\n \n1  purposes in a reasonable fashion, rather than taking irrelevant or impermissible factors \n2  into account.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 55, 48 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (emphasis \n3  added). \n4    DOJ has done exactly what it may not do: it has changed the COPS program to \n5  focus on irrelevant and impermissible factors.  There are two fundamental problems with \n6  DOJ’s actions.  First, by giving extra points to communities that certify specified forms \n7  of “partnership” with federal civil immigration authorities, DOJ is attempting to pressure \n8  state and local governments to change their laws and policies, in a way that has nothing \n9  to do with their use of, or need for, grant funds.  Second, by authorizing grant recipients \n10  to use funds to focus on “illegal immigration,” and then awarding extra points to \n11  communities that adopt that focus, DOJ is diverting COPS funds away from their \n12  statutorily-assigned purpose and disfavoring communities that are unwilling to participate \n13  in the diversion.   \n14    The text and structure of the COPS statute make clear that DOJ is not faithfully \n15  administering the COPS grant program but unilaterally altering it.  Indeed, it is striking \n16  that DOJ announced this year’s grant awards by boasting of the importance of its \n17  immigration-related considerations—rather than any achievement having to do with \n18  community-oriented policing.  RJN Ex. H, November Press Release.  DOJ’s actions are \n19  “an improper attempt to wield Congress’s exclusive spending power” and “a violation of \n20  the Constitution’s separation of powers principles.”  Cty. of Santa Clara v. Donald J. \n21  Trump; City and Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 2017 WL 5569835 at *12. \n22 \n1.  DOJ Cannot Use COPS Grant Decisions to Pressure State and \n23  Local Governments to Change Their Regulations, Policies, and \nPractices. \n24 \n25  DOJ favors COPS applications from state and local governments that are willing \n26  and able to certify particular forms of “partnership” with federal civil immigration \n27  enforcement efforts.  This “partnership” has nothing to do with how the COPS funding \n28  will actually be used.  The Access and Notice Requirements, which local law \n12 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 20 of 33   Page ID #:1064\n \n1  enforcement are asked to adopt in their detention operations, do not concern the hiring of \n2  local police officers to engage in community oriented policing.  The requirement of \n3  adopting such regulations and policies is focused only on whether and how local \n4  governments partner with federal immigration officers performing federal civil \n5  immigration enforcement duties.  Those duties fall squarely within the province of the \n6  federal government, not states or localities.  Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, \n7  2498 (2012) (“The Government of the United States has broad, undoubted power over the \n8  subject of immigration and the status of aliens.”); Valle de Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d, \n9  1006, 1023 (9th Cir. 2013) (“[p]ower to regulate immigration is unquestionably exclusive \n10  federal power” (quoting DeCanas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351, 354 (1976)).  DOJ is thus using \n11  its control over funds appropriated to support the hiring of police officers in order to \n12  advance an unrelated policy agenda.  See Philadelphia, 2017 WL 5489476 at *48 \n13  (“Immigration law has nothing to do with the enforcement of local criminal laws.”).  The \n14  COPS statute makes clear that this action oversteps DOJ’s delegated authority. \n15  Congress specifically defined the circumstances in which “the Attorney General \n16  may give preferential consideration” to COPS applicants.  34 U.S.C. § 10381(c).  In order \n17  for this authorization to make any sense, the agency cannot be permitted to invent \n18  entirely new grounds on which to award preferential treatment.  Otherwise, the statutory \n19  provision allowing limited grounds for preference would be wholly superfluous.  See \n20  Chubb Custom Ins. Co. v. Space Systems/Loral, Inc., 710 F.3d 946, 966 (9th Cir. 2013) \n21  (“It is a well-established rule of statutory construction that courts should not interpret \n22  statutes in a way that renders a provision superfluous.”). \n23  Significantly, the limited authorization to give preferential consideration is the only \n24  place in the statute where Congress contemplates DOJ looking beyond the actual need \n25  for, or use of, the grant funds involved, and awarding points simply to encourage states to \n26  pass laws or enact policies or practices that the federal government favors.  Thus, the \n27  Attorney General “may” give preferential consideration for a COPS “applicant in a State \n28  that has in effect a law” providing for lenient treatment of human trafficking victims.  See \n13 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 21 of 33   Page ID #:1065\n \n1  34 U.S.C. § 10381(c)(2)-(3).  In providing that DOJ “may” give preferential \n2  consideration for this carefully defined reason, Congress made clear that the agency does \n3  not have blanket authority to use COPS funding to encourage state and local governments \n4  to make any law or policy change DOJ desires.  Because the list of preferential factors \n5  the Attorney General may consider makes no mention of immigration enforcement at all, \n6  Congress cannot be said to have allowed the Attorney General to give preferential \n7  consideration to state and local governments that are willing to adopt laws, regulations, \n8  ordinances, or policies that support federal civil immigration enforcement efforts.   \n9  In our federal system, it is a serious matter when the federal government attempts \n10  to pressure a state or local government to change its laws and policies.  This is precisely \n11  the type of action requiring a “clear statement” from Congress, to ensure that the national \n12  legislature—not unaccountable bureaucrats—“in fact faced, and intended to bring into \n13  issue, the critical matters involved.”  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 461 (1991).  \n14  Thus, in the grant context, courts do not allow agencies to invent their own conditions on \n15  state and local governments, but require “unambiguous statutory expression of \n16  congressional intent to condition the States’ receipt of federal funds in a particular \n17  manner.”  Com. Va., Dep’t of Educ. v. Riley, 106 F.3d 559, 566 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc) \n18  (adopting the dissenting panel opinion of Luttig, J.), superseded by statute.  Congress \n19  paid heed to these federalism principles in spelling out the limited circumstances in \n20  which DOJ may favor a grant applicant because of the unrelated policies it has in effect.  \n21  It would subvert this canon of construction, in addition to the plain text of the statute \n22  itself, to read into the law a broader authorization for DOJ to give preferential treatment \n23  to jurisdictions with laws and policies the agency prefers—and to disfavor those that are \n24  unwilling to change their laws and policies to meet DOJ’s demands. \n25  Congress further recognized that seeking to change the policies of state and local \n26  law enforcement is especially sensitive.  Thus, Congress provided that nothing in DOJ’s \n27  grant-making authorities (or any other Act) “shall be construed to authorize any \n28  department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, \n14 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 22 of 33   Page ID #:1066\n \n1  supervision, or control over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any \n2  State or any political subdivision thereof.”  34 U.S.C. § 10228(a).  Here, DOJ seeks to \n3  direct, supervise, and control local police forces by pressuring them to change their \n4  policies and operations in order to compete for valuable federal resources on an even \n5  playing field.  Congress’s clear reason for including this rule of construction was its \n6  recognition that DOJ may attempt to do exactly what it is now doing—using its \n7  stewardship of federal grant funds, and the leverage that comes with it, to tell state and \n8  local law enforcement what unrelated policies they should adopt. \n9  Finally, although the text of the statute is more than sufficient to conclude that DOJ \n10  lacks this authority, the legislative history confirms that conclusion.  The House Report \n11  listed the types of factors Congress expected DOJ to consider in making grant decisions: \n12  “the needs of areas with high crime rates, low officer to population ratios, understaffing \n13  of law enforcement agencies in relation to the size of the geographic areas for which they \n14  are responsible, high unemployment and economic dislocation rates that may contribute \n15  to increased crime problems, and other relevant trends.”  H.R. Rep. 103-324, at 10.  What \n16  is notable about this list is that every item has to do with the need for police officers on \n17  the street to combat crime, and thus falls squarely within the statutory purposes of the \n18  COPS program.  Not one suggests that DOJ could use COPS funds as a tool to extract \n19  any policy commitments it wishes, including relating to civil immigration enforcement, \n20  from state and local governments. \n21  It is thus clear that DOJ lacks authority to award extra points to COPS applicants \n22  that adhere to the “partnership” policies DOJ demands.  DOJ’s contrary view—that it can \n23  discriminate against COPS applicants that are unwilling to change their laws and policies \n24  to accord with the agency’s preferences—lacks any limiting principle.  Today, the agency \n25  is using federal funds to promote state and local governments adopting particular laws \n26  and policies concerning federal civil immigration enforcement.  The next administration \n27  might wish to use federal grant funds to encourage states to abolish capital punishment, \n28  or to resort to capital punishment more frequently.  To stop prosecuting marijuana \n15 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 23 of 33   Page ID #:1067\n \n1  offenses, or to prosecute marijuana offenses more vigorously.  None of this fits within the \n2  role Congress assigned to DOJ in administering the COPS grant, a program designed to \n3  support the hiring of police officers to engage in community-oriented policing.  Congress \n4  did not authorize DOJ to take advantage of that administrative role to impose the \n5  agency’s own policy agenda on state and local governments, whatever that agenda \n6  happens to be.  \n7 \n2.  DOJ Cannot Redirect COPS Funds Toward Civil Immigration \n8  Enforcement and Disfavor Communities That Intend to Use \nCOPS Funds to Engage in Community-Oriented Policing.   \n9 \nDOJ also favors COPS applicants willing to use their grant funds to engage in civil \n10 \nimmigration enforcement.  Congress not only excluded immigration as a ground for \n11 \npreferential consideration, but it did not consider state and local participation in civil \n12 \nimmigration enforcement to be even an appropriate use of COPS funding at all.  The \n13 \nagency’s attempt to redirect COPS funding to promote federal civil immigration \n14 \nenforcement, and then to favor state and local governments willing to participate in that \n15 \nenforcement, is thus doubly flawed. \n16 \nDOJ has taken the position that the only statutory authority for the COPS Hiring \n17 \nProgram is paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of 34 U.S.C. § 10381.  (See Doc. 33 at 3).  These \n18 \nparagraphs expressly limit DOJ’s authority to support the hiring of police officers “for \n19 \ndeployment in community-oriented policing.”  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2).  Congress \n20 \ndid not include the “community-oriented” modifier as surplusage.  It did not intend for \n21 \ngrant funding to be used for any police activity DOJ wishes to support at a given time, \n22 \nbut rather for a subset of that work: community-oriented policing.   \n23 \nDOJ itself defines community-oriented policing as “begin[ning] with a \n24 \ncommitment to building trust and mutual respect between police and communities.”  See \n25 \nRJN Ex. A, COPS Office, “About”.  Law enforcement veterans, including the chiefs of \n26 \npolice of the country’s major cities, have concluded that state and local police \n27 \nparticipation in civil immigration enforcement “undermines the trust and cooperation \n28 \n16 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 24 of 33   Page ID #:1068\n \n1  with immigrant communities which are essential elements of community oriented \n2  policing.”  See RJN Ex. E, Major Cities Chiefs Association, Immigration Policy \n3  (emphasis added).  This Court need not go so far as to agree with that view.  But given \n4  the widespread recognition that civil immigration enforcement is in tension with \n5  community-oriented policing, it is highly unlikely that Congress intended funds \n6  appropriated for community-oriented policing to be used to subsidize state and local \n7  participation in civil immigration enforcement. \n8  Indeed, it is difficult to see how the particular activities DOJ wishes to subsidize \n9  bear any connection to “community-oriented policing.”  The agency has said, for \n10  example, that it intends to use the COPS program to fund “287(g) partnerships,” under \n11  which state and local police are empowered to act as immigration officers.  RJN Ex. F, \n12  DOJ FY 2018 COPS Office Congressional Justification at 31; see 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1).  \n13  Carrying out civil immigration raids in support of federal enforcement efforts bears no \n14  logical connection to “building trust and mutual respect between police and \n15  communities.”  Neither does “honoring detainers,” a practice that concerns a state or \n16  local government’s internal detention operations, and has led to several cases holding \n17  municipalities to be in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  See, e.g., Ochoa, 2017 WL \n18  3476777 at *7, *14; Santoyo, 2017 WL 2896021 at **3-8; Miranda-Olivares, 2014 WL \n19  1414305 at *11.  Unless all policing can be characterized as “community-oriented \n20  policing”—turning Congress’s carefully chosen words into surplusage—this is not an \n21  authorized use of COPS funds. \n22  The broader structure of the statute further demonstrates that DOJ is not authorized \n23  to redirect COPS funding toward civil immigration enforcement.  Congress enacted a \n24  detailed list of twenty-two purposes that the COPS grant, as “a single grant program,” \n25  could be used to advance.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(a), (b)(1)-(22).  These statutory \n26  purposes highlight, among other things, crime control and terrorism.  See id. \n27  § 10381(b)(4), (5), (8), (9), (11), (12), (15).  But civil immigration enforcement is notably \n28  absent from this long list of congressionally authorized purposes of COPS grants.  If \n17 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 25 of 33   Page ID #:1069\n \n1  Congress had reached the counterintuitive conclusion that funds for “community-oriented \n2  policing” can be spent to promote state and local participation in federal civil \n3  immigration enforcement, surely it would have given some hint of that somewhere in a \n4  statute that is otherwise quite specific. \n5  DOJ’s view is not just at odds with the COPS statute but with immigration laws as \n6  well.  Congress has mandated that state and local participation in civil immigration \n7  enforcement through 287(g) partnerships be undertaken “at the expense of the State or \n8  political subdivision.”  8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1) (emphasis added).  DOJ is contravening \n9  that clear mandate: it is offering federal funds, through the COPS program, to sponsor \n10  287(g) partnerships, even though Congress directed that such partnerships be at state and \n11  local expense.  And it does so in order to fund partnerships with the federal government \n12  that have nothing to do with “community-oriented policing.”5 \n13  DOJ’s decision to give extra points in the COPS application process to \n14  communities that are willing to focus on “illegal immigration” with their COPS funds \n15  only compounds its error.  Because civil immigration enforcement is not one of the \n16  purposes Congress recognized as relevant to community-oriented policing, DOJ plainly \n17  lacks authority to disfavor communities unwilling to participate in this diversion of COPS \n18  resources.   \n19 \nB.  The Challenged Considerations Violate the Spending Clause Because \n20  They Are Not Reasonably Related to Congress’s Purpose of Promoting \nCommunity-Oriented Policing.  \n21 \nThe Challenged Considerations operate as a type of condition on COPS funding.  \n22 \nIf a community is unwilling or unable to certify that it has in place certain laws or \n23 \npolicies demonstrating “partnership” with federal civil immigration authorities, it is less \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26  5 To the extent DOJ means to sponsor state and local governments to engage in civil \nimmigration enforcement without 287(g) agreements, it is exceeding Congress’s \n27 \n“limit[s]” on the “circumstances in which state officers may perform the functions of an \n28  immigration officer.”  Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2506. \n18 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 26 of 33   Page ID #:1070\n \n1  likely to get the grant.  Likewise, if a community is unwilling to pledge to use its COPS \n2  award to focus on “illegal immigration,” it is less likely to get the grant.  In at least some \n3  cases, a community’s unwillingness or inability to comply with the Challenged \n4  Considerations will be the difference between receiving a grant and not receiving a grant.  \n5  In fact, DOJ has emphasized that the vast majority of successful COPS applicants for FY \n6  2017 certified compliance with the Notice and Access Requirements, demonstrating how \n7  important that additional consideration was.  See RJN Ex. H, November Press Release. \n8  Accordingly, even if DOJ had statutory authority to adopt these funding \n9  conditions—which it does not—the agency would still need to comply with constitutional \n10  restrictions in exercising that authority.  See S. Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-09 \n11  (1987).  The Challenged Considerations violate at least one such restriction.     \n12  An exercise of Spending Clause authority is unconstitutional if it is not \n13  “reasonably related to the articulated goal” of the grant program Congress established.   \n14  Nevada v. Skinner, 884 F.2d 445, 447 (9th Cir. 1989).  Here, the program Congress \n15  established is concerned with hiring police officers to be deployed in community-oriented \n16  policing.  34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1), (2); see also id. § 10381(b)(1)-(22) (identifying \n17  twenty-two authorized purposes for the “single grant program” Congress created).  As the \n18  COPS Office itself recently explained, the goal of the program is to “advanc[e] public \n19  safety through the implementation of community policing strategies,” which “entails \n20  developing partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the communities they \n21  serve.”  RJN Ex. F, DOJ FY 2018 COPS Office Congressional Justification at 4. \n22  The Challenged Considerations are not at all related to this fundamental goal.  See \n23  Philadelphia, 2017 WL 5489476 at *48 (concluding that “the argument that enforcement \n24  of federal immigration laws is related to this objective [of enhancing local criminal \n25  justice under a different law enforcement assistance grant] is unsustainable”).  Whether \n26  or not a community’s regulations, policies, and practices provide the access to detention \n27  facilities that DOJ demands, or the notice of a detainee’s release time that DOJ demands, \n28  has nothing to do with its hiring of police officers to develop better “partnerships between \n19 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 27 of 33   Page ID #:1071\n \n1  law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.”  See supra 12-16.  Neither \n2  does developing a program to assist federal authorities in civil immigration enforcement \n3  have anything to do with community-oriented policing.  See supra 16-18.  Indeed, there \n4  is no mention of civil immigration enforcement in the COPS statute—an omission that is \n5  especially conspicuous in light of Congress’s detailed list of twenty-two authorized \n6  purposes of the grant program.  See 34 U.S.C. § 10381(b)(1)-(22); see also Schneider v. \n7  Chertoff, 450 F.3d 944, 954 (9th Cir. 2006) (“[I]t is a well-established maxim of statutory \n8  interpretation that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.”). \n9  Put simply, Defendants cannot show any reasonable relationship between its new \n10  immigration-related considerations and the express goals of the COPS program.  Under \n11  Dole, DOJ cannot penalize COPS applicants on the basis of these unrelated factors.6 \n12 \nC.  The Challenged Considerations Are Invalid Under the Administrative \n13  Procedure Act.  \nAgency actions must be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act if they \n14 \nare “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with  \n15 \nlaw.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  For the reasons noted above, the Challenged Considerations \n16 \nare not in accordance with law.  They also cannot survive scrutiny under the arbitrary and \n17 \ncapricious standard. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n                                                 \n21 \n6 The Notice and Access Requirements that DOJ articulated in its September 7, 2017 e-\n22  mail also fail to meet the requirement that conditions attached to grant funding be \nunambiguous on their face.  See Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, \n23 \n17 (1981); Dole, 483 U.S. at 207-09.  Implicitly acknowledging this defect, DOJ has \n24  taken the position in this lawsuit that it does not understand those Requirements to \n“forbid a jurisdiction from informing detainees, where required by law, that they may \n25 \nchoose not to meet with federal immigration authorities, or to require that a jurisdiction \n26  notify DHS before the release of a noncitizen under short-term detention whose release \ntime is unknown.”  Opp. to PI at 20 (Doc. 33) (citing Dorr Decl. ¶ 26).  Los Angeles does \n27 \nnot intend to press the ambiguity defect in the Notice and Access Requirements so long \n28  as DOJ adheres to its representations. \n20 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 28 of 33   Page ID #:1072\n \n1  In subjecting an agency decision to arbitrary-and-capricious review, the Court \n2  “must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors \n3  and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.”  San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water \n4  Auth. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 581, 601 (9th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted); Az. Cattle Growers’ \n5  Ass’n v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife, Bureau of Land Mgmt., 273 F.3d 1229, 1236 (9th Cir. \n6  2001) (“[W]e carefully review the record to ensure that agency decisions are founded on \n7  a reasoned evaluation of the relevant factors.” (citation omitted)).   \n8  Here, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that DOJ adopted the \n9  Challenged Considerations following any reasoned evaluation at all, nor is there any \n10  support for the agency’s attempt to tie federal civil immigration enforcement to \n11  Congress’s community policing goals in establishing and designing the COPS grant \n12  program.  Indeed, before announcing its new policy, or even at the time of its \n13  announcement, DOJ did not offer any justifiable basis for how that policy advances the \n14  purposes of the COPS program. \n15  Since then, DOJ has made vague allusions about how city and state cooperation \n16  with federal law enforcement “make all of us safer by helping remove dangerous \n17  criminals from our communities,” including by ending “violent crime stemming from \n18  illegal immigration.”  See RJN Ex. D, DOJ, Office of Public Affairs, Department of \n19  Justice Announces Priority Consideration Criteria for COPS Office Grants (Sept. 7, \n20  2017).  But these conclusory, post-hoc justifications have nothing to do with the statute \n21  DOJ purports to be administering.  In other words, DOJ has articulated no justification at \n22  all for how the extra points it is awarding for immigration-related reasons have anything \n23  to do with its statutory responsibility to allocate funds for use in community-oriented \n24  policing. \n25  DOJ’s thin justifications in any event do not amount to the sort of tangible \n26  evidence and reasoned justification required to survive arbitrary-and-capricious review.  \n27  See Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168-69 (1962) (stating \n28  that post-hoc rationalizations are irrelevant as “an agency’s discretionary order [must] be \n21 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 29 of 33   Page ID #:1073\n \n1  upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself”); \n2  Arrington v. Daniels, 516 F.3d 1106, 1111-12 (9th Cir. 2008) (holding that even when an \n3  agency had discretion to promulgate a rule, the rule was arbitrary and capricious because \n4  “the administrative record contains no rationale explaining the Bureau’s decision”).  \n5  Indeed, the agency has not pointed to any actual evidence to support its implied premise \n6  that undocumented immigrants or other non-citizens commit violent crimes at higher \n7  rates than the general population, or to indicate that the investigations of federal civil \n8  immigration violations facilitated by the Challenged Considerations are focused on \n9  individuals involved in violent crime.  See Philadelphia, 2017 WL 5489476 at *32 \n10  (concluding that DOJ’s imposition of a similar immigration enforcement condition on the \n11  Byrne JAG program was arbitrary and capricious where the court could not “find a link \n12  between, on one hand, imposing the Certification Condition, and on the other hand, \n13  ‘protect[ing] the public and reduc[ing] crime and violence’” (alterations in original)); see \n14  also Tongatapu Woodcraft Hawaii, Ltd. v. Feldman, 736 F.2d 1305, 1308 (9th Cir. 1984) \n15  (“We have held it an abuse of discretion for the [INS] to act if there is no evidence to \n16  support the decision . . . .”) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).   \n17  In fact, the little evidence the Attorney General has cited in other contexts belies \n18  his claim that there is a relationship between so-called “sanctuary” policies and violent \n19  crime, as that evidence indicates no such relationship at all, while other studies show an \n20  inverse relationship.  See RJN Ex. C, Nick Roll, Correcting Jeff Sessions, Inside Higher \n21  Ed (July 17, 2017); see also id. at Ex. G, Contrary to Trump’s Claims, Immigrants Are \n22  Less Likely to Commit Crimes, N.Y. Times (Jan. 26, 2017).7  These studies demonstrate \n23  that, not only does the agency lack any reasoned explanation for implementing the \n24  Challenged Considerations, but also that it failed to consider relevant and available \n25  evidence before announcing its new policy.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n7 Los Angeles introduces these articles to demonstrate the information that was publicly \n28  available at the time DOJ decided to implement the Challenged Considerations. \n22 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 30 of 33   Page ID #:1074\n \n1  v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (“[A]n agency rule would be \n2  arbitrary and capricious if the agency . . . offered an explanation for its decision that runs \n3  counter to the evidence before the agency.”).   \n4  The irony of Defendants’ position is that DOJ’s policy actually undermines public \n5  safety.  It deprives states and localities of critical funds needed to hire new police \n6  officers, or alternatively, forces them to adopt policies that erode the trust they have \n7  worked hard to cultivate.  Either way, the Challenged Considerations work against the \n8  purposes Congress had in mind when it created the COPS program, further demonstrating \n9  that the agency failed to adequately consider all relevant factors before announcing its \n10  new preferential criteria. \n11 \nD.  The Court Should Enter a Permanent Injunction. \n12 \nBecause the Challenged Considerations are unlawful, this Court should \n13 \npermanently enjoin Defendants from considering them in connection with any future \n14 \nevaluation of COPS grant applications.  A court may grant a permanent injunction if the \n15 \nmoving party demonstrates:  \n16 \n(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies \n17  available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to \ncompensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of \n18 \nhardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in \n19  equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be \ndisserved by a permanent injunction.   \n20 \nMonsanto Co v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 157-58 (2010); accord Sierra \n21 \nForest Legacy v. Sherman, 646 F.3d 1161, 1184 (9th Cir. 2011).  All four factors are met \n22 \nhere.   \n23 \n  First, it is well-established that “[a] rule putting plaintiffs at a competitive \n24 \ndisadvantage constitutes irreparable harm.”  Int’l Franchise Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Seattle, \n25 \n803 F.3d 389, 411 (9th Cir. 2015).  Absent an injunction, Los Angeles will be at a \n26 \ncompetitive disadvantage, and thus suffer irreparable harm, in future grant cycles.  The \n27 \nfact that DOJ used the Challenged Considerations in violation of the Constitution further \n28 \n23 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 31 of 33   Page ID #:1075\n \n1  confirms the existence of irreparable harm.  See Monterey Mechanical Co. v. Wilson, 125 \n2  F.3d 702, 715 (9th Cir. 1997) (“[A]n alleged constitutional infringement will often alone \n3  constitute irreparable harm.”). \n4    Second, monetary damages cannot adequately remedy the competitive injury Los \n5  Angeles has suffered.  The only way to prevent future harm is to ensure Los Angeles can \n6  compete on an even playing field in future grant cycles.  Moreover, the Ninth Circuit has \n7  held that a permanent injunction is an appropriate remedy for the government’s unlawful \n8  allocation of funds.  See Planned Parenthood Arizona Inc. v. Betlach, 727 F.3d 960, 975 \n9  (9th Cir. 2013) (granting a permanent injunction against Arizona’s ultra vires condition \n10  on Medicaid reimbursement).   \n11  Third, the balance of equities weighs strongly in favor of granting a permanent \n12  injunction.  The City has a strong interest in protecting itself against unwarranted federal \n13  pressure that the City change its long-held views on the public safety dangers of \n14  enmeshing local law enforcement in federal civil immigration enforcement.  See Hyams \n15  Decl. ¶¶ 3-5.  It also has a related interest in maintaining the trust and cooperation of Los \n16  Angeles residents to effectively police local communities and promote public safety \n17  amongst some of the City’s most vulnerable residents.  In contrast, the government has \n18  no legitimate interest in awarding funds on the basis of unconstitutional factors.  For \n19  similar reasons, an injunction is in the public interest, in addition to the fact that it is \n20  “always in the public interest” to issue an injunction in order to “prevent the violation of \n21  a party’s constitutional rights.”  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012). \n22  V.  CONCLUSION \n23  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant partial summary judgment to the \n24  City of Los Angeles as to each of its claims concerning the COPS grant program (Counts \n25  Four, Five, and Six), and enter final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) on those claims.  \n26  The Court should declare that the Challenged Considerations are (1) ultra vires and a \n27  violation of the Separation of Powers, (2) in violation of the Spending Clause, and (3) an \n28  arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  \n24 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 32 of 33   Page ID #:1076\n \n1  The Court should further enjoin Defendants from using the Challenged Considerations in \n2  making COPS grant determinations in future grant cycles. \n3     \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n25 \n  CITY OF LOS ANGELES’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n\nCase 2:17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 49-1   Filed 11/21/17   Page 33 of 33   Page ID #:1077",

No. 85).  Having been fully briefed by both parties, this Court took the matter under \n20  submission on September 12, 2018. \n21  The federal grant at issue in Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is awarded by the Edward \n22  Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (the “Byrne JAG grant”).  This grant supports \n23  state and local law enforcement efforts by providing additional funds for personnel, equipment, \n24  training, and other criminal justice needs.  34 U.S.C. § 10152.  The Byrne JAG grant is a formula \n25  grant meaning the funds are awarded according to a formula provided by statute based on the \n26  state’s population and rate of violent crime.  34 U.S.C. § 10156.  Plaintiff City of Los Angeles \n27  (“Los Angeles”) has been a recipient of the Byrne JAG grant every year since 1997, and each year \n28  has received more than $1 million in funding.  In 2017, Defendant Attorney General announced  \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 94   Filed 09/17/18   Page 2 of 7   Page ID #:2927\n1  immigration compliance requirements that the Bureau of Justice Assistance (“BJA”) would be \n2  imposing on Byrne JAG applicants to render certain jurisdictions ineligible for funds if they did \n3  not change their policies and operations to be in compliance.  The announcement explained that, \n4  “[f]rom now on, the Department will only provide Byrne JAG grants to cities and states that \n5  comply with federal law, allow federal immigration access to detention facilities [“Access \n6  Condition”], and provide 40 hours’ notice before they release an illegal alien wanted by federal \n7  authorities [“Notice Condition”].”  Los Angeles has not changed its policies and operations, and as \n8  a result has not received Byrne JAG funding for the 2017 fiscal year.  Now before this Court, \n9  Defendants seek to dismiss Counts One, Two, and Three of Plaintiff’s Complaint.   \n10  Defendant argues in its Motion to Dismiss that Plaintiff lacks standing and ripeness to \n \n  11  bring Counts One, Two, and Three in its Complaint because Plaintiff has not shown injury in fact.  \n12  Defendants also argue that Plaintiff’s allegation that the Notice and Access Conditions are ultra \n13  vires and violate the Constitution’s separation of powers (Count One) should be dismissed under \n14  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because Defendants were authorized to impose these \n15  Conditions.   Next, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s allegation that the Notice and Access \n16  Conditions violate the Spending Clause (Count Two) should be dismissed under Federal Rule of \n17  Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because the conditions are consistent with the Spending Clause.  Finally, \n18  Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s allegation that the Notice and Access Conditions are arbitrary or \n19  capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) (Count Three) should be \n20  dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because Plaintiff does not challenge \n21  “final agency action” as required under the APA.   \n22  Jurisdiction \n23  Before turning to the merits of the case, this Court first addresses the issue of standing \n24  under Rule 12(b)(1).  “A party invoking federal jurisdiction has the burden of establishing that it \n25  has satisfied the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III of the Constitution; standing is a \n26  ‘core component’ of that requirement.”  D’Lil v. Best Western Encina Lodge & Suites, 538 F.3d \n27  1031, 1036 (9th Cir. 2008).  Standing requires (1) injury in fact, (2) causation, and (3) \n28  redressability.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  In the context of a \n2 \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 94   Filed 09/17/18   Page 3 of 7   Page ID #:2928\n1  statutory violation, the Plaintiff must have suffered concrete injury.  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. \n2  Ct. 1540, 1549 (2016).   \n3  Here, Defendant challenges Plaintiff’s standing based on the injury in fact requirement.  \n4  Because the challenge is facial, this Court assumes the truth of the allegations in the Complaint \n5  and looks no further.  See Ewing v. SQM US, Inc., 211 F. Supp. 3d 1289, 1292 (S.D. Cal. 2016).  \n6  The Attorney General believes Plaintiff’s challenge to the conditions is premature because the \n7  Office of Justice Programs (”OJP”) has not yet reached a final decision on whether to award Los \n8  Angeles funds under the Byrne JAG grant, meaning the OJP has not yet consummated any “final \n9  agency action” that is ripe for judicial review.  However, this argument misses the mark.  Plaintiff \n10  is not challenging the Attorney General’s unfinalized decision whether to award the funds, but \n \n  11  instead the decision to impose the Notice and Access Conditions on the Byrne JAG grant.  \n12  In the context of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), for \n13  agency action to be considered “final,” two conditions must be met: (1) the imposition of the \n14  Conditions must “mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” and cannot \n15  be merely tentative, and (2) the imposition of the Conditions must be an act “by which ‘rights or \n16  obligations have been determined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences will flow.’”  Bennett v. \n17  Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997).   \n18  Both requirements are clearly met here.  As for the first requirement, the imposition of \n19  these Conditions is neither tentative nor interlocutory in nature.  Alan Hanson, the then-Acting \n20  Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs at the DOJ, stated in his declaration \n21  that every 2017 fiscal year award will include the Conditions.  See City of Chicago v. Sessions, \n22  2018 WL 3608564, at *5 (“[T]he Attorney General’s attachment of the Conditions is the end \n23  result of his decision-making process on this score.”).  Turning to the second requirement, the \n24  “Conditions attached to the Byrne JAG funds trigger important legal and practical consequences.”  \n25  Id.  Specifically, Los Angeles must “choose between accepting the award”―to which it is \n26  statutorily entitled―“with the Conditions or forgoing the award in favor of maintaining the City’s \n27  policy preferences.”  Id.  In sum, legal consequences clearly flow from the imposition of the \n28  Conditions.  Therefore, because most requirements have been met, this Court finds that the \n3 \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 94   Filed 09/17/18   Page 4 of 7   Page ID #:2929\n1  Attorney General’s decision to impose the Conditions constitutes final agency action that is ripe \n2  for judicial review. \n3  As for the other two claims at issue, Plaintiff’s injury is both impending and substantially \n4  likely to occur.  Under the 2017 fiscal year Byrne JAG formula grant, Los Angeles is expected to \n5  receive $1.9 million, with $1.5 million allocated directly to the City and the remainder allocated to \n6  the County of Los Angeles as a sub-grantee.  This is based on previous years’ funds award and the \n7  statutory formula.  Because the Attorney General has stated that the Department will only provide \n8  Byrne JAG grants to cities and states that accept and impose the Notice and Access Conditions, \n9  Los Angeles would be forced to certify to those conditions and that requirement alone is sufficient \n10  to establish standing.  Therefore, this Court rejects Defendants’ contention that Plaintiff lacks \n \n  11  standing required to qualify for judicial review.  \n12  Count One: Violation of Separation of Powers / Ultra Vires Agency Action \n13  This Court next addresses Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff’s separation of powers / \n14  ultra vires claim should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is \n15  proper when a complaint exhibits either “the lack of a cognizable legal theory or the absence of \n16  sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.”  Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., 901 \n17  F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988).  Under the heightened pleading standards of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \n18  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009), a plaintiff must allege \n19  “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,” so that the defendant receives \n20  “fair notice of what the…claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n21  555, 570.  The plaintiff must plead “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \n22  inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  Courts \n23  will not accept “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere \n24  conclusory statements. . . .”  Id.  “All allegations of material fact are taken as true and construed in \n25  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d \n26  979, 988 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).  \n27  The Attorney General moves to dismiss Count One (ultra vires and separation of powers), \n28  arguing that the Byrne JAG statute provides authority to impose the Conditions.  On September \n4 \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 94   Filed 09/17/18   Page 5 of 7   Page ID #:2930\n1  13, 2018, this Court granted Plaintiff’s Application for Preliminary Injunction, finding that \n2  Plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim that the Byrne JAG statute does not \n3  authorize the Conditions imposed and, thus, are ultra vires and violate the Constitution’s \n4  separation of powers.  For the reasons set forth in the September 13, 2018 Order, this Court denies \n5  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to this claim.  Defendants’ brief raises the same exact \n6  arguments that have already been rejected by the Seventh Circuit and two federal district courts.  \n7  Plaintiff contends that the language of the statute cannot be interpreted to delegate authority to the \n8  Attorney General to impose the Notice and Access Conditions on the Byrne JAG grant.  For the \n9  reasons already articulated by the courts in City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272 (7th Cir. \n10  2018) and City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 579 (E.D. Pa. 2017), and similar \n \n  11  reasons adopted by this Court with respect to the COPS program, this Court finds that Plaintiff has \n12  plausibly stated a claim that the Notice and Access Conditions are ultra vires and in violation of \n13  the separation of powers.  Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count One of the Complaint \n14  is DENIED.  \n15  Count Two: Violation of the Spending Clause \n16  This Court next addresses Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff’s claim that the Conditions \n17  violate the Spending Clause, should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).  “Congress may attach \n18  conditions on the receipt of federal funds, and has repeatedly employed the power ‘to further \n19  broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the \n20  recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives.’”  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. \n21  203, 206 (1987).  However, the congressional conditions on the receipt of federal funds “must. . . \n22  bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal spending.”  New York v. U.S., 505 U.S. 144, \n23  167 (1992).  Of the four requirements that must be satisfied to comply with the Spending clause, \n24  one requirement is that “. . . the conditions on receipt of federal funds must be reasonably related \n25  to the articulated goal.”  State of Nevada v. Skinner, 884 F.2d 445, 447 (1989).   \n26  Here, Plaintiff alleges that the Notice and Access Conditions violate the requirement that \n27  the conditions on receipt of federal funds be reasonably related to the articulated goal.  The \n28  purpose of the Byrne JAG program is to support programs “for criminal justice,” 34 U.S.C. § \n5 \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 94   Filed 09/17/18   Page 6 of 7   Page ID #:2931\n1  10152(a)(1).  The statute lists the types of programs that the grant is to fund, and Plaintiff contends \n2  that Congress did not include civil immigration regulation.  Further, Plaintiff has pleaded facts \n3  sufficient to show that the Conditions may not be reasonably related to the goal of enhancing local \n4  criminal justice.  As a result, the City has properly stated a claim that the Notice and Access \n5  Conditions violate the Spending Clause. Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count Two of \n6  the Complaint is DENIED. \n7  Count Three: Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n8  Finally, this Court next addresses Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff’s claim that the \n9  Conditions violate the APA, should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).  Defendants first argue that \n10  this claim must be dismissed because Plaintiff does not challenge “final agency action” as \n \n  11  necessary under the APA.  However, as analyzed above, this Court finds that the Conditions do \n12  constitute “final agency action.”   \n13  Now focusing on the merits for purposes of Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion, Plaintiff \n14  argues that the imposition of the Conditions should be set aside as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \n15  of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” while Defendants argue that the \n16  Conditions are reasonable because the conditions comport with the Spending Clause and are \n17  authorized by statute.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n18  An agency “must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its \n19  action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Motor \n20  Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  And \n21  an agency decision will be found to be arbitrary and capricious “if the agency has relied on factors \n22  which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of \n23  the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the \n24  agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of \n25  agency expertise.”  Id.  \n26  Los Angeles alleges that the Justice Department has not only failed to “examine the \n27  relevant data and articulate . . . a rational connection between the facts found and the choice \n28  made,” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2016) (citation omitted), it has \n6 \n \n\nCase 2 :17-cv-07215-R-JC   Document 94   Filed 09/17/18   Page 7 of 7   Page ID #:2932\n1  also ignored substantial contrary evidence.  Los Angeles further contends that there is an absence \n2  of evidence supporting the imposition of the Condition.  However, there is evidence that \n3  undermines the agency’s action and, consequently, the agency’s stated explanation runs counter to \n4  the evidence.  Organized Vill. Of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 966 (9th Cir. 2015) \n5  (“Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has . . . offered an explanation for its \n6  decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.”).  Los Angeles argues that the \n7  Justice Department’s reliance on an Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) Report and the \n8  Department’s “Backgrounder on Grant Requirements” is misplaced.  Specifically, Los Angeles \n9  cites to the court’s decision in City of Philadelphia v. Sessions holding that those documents “do \n10  not demonstrate any adequate basis for the attachment of the Challenged conditions.”  309 F. \n \n  11  Supp. 3d 271, 324 (E.D. Pa. 2018).  The OIG Report summarizes compliance with 8 U.S.C. §1373 \n12  and does not discuss the need to impose the Notice and Access Conditions on Byrne JAG awards.  \n13  Based on the facts alleged, this Court finds that the Plaintiff has plausibly stated a claim that the \n14  Notice and Access Conditions are arbitrary and capricious.  Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to \n15  Dismiss Count Three of the Complaint is DENIED. \n16    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.  (Dkt. No. \n17  85).  \n18  Dated: September 17, 2018. \n \n19 \n___________________________________      \n20 \n        MANUEL L.

For instance, each state that applies or that \n  contains an applying entity must receive, together with any grantees in the state, at least .5 percent of a fiscal year’s \ntotal allocation for the grant program. 34 U.S.C. § 10381(f). Second, allocated funds must be divided equally \nbetween  small  (fewer  than  150,000  people)  and  large  (more  than  150,000  people)  jurisdictions.  Id.  § \n10261(a)(11)(B). Third, a grant cannot account for more than 75 percent of a recipient program’s costs, although the \nAttorney General can waive this requirement. Id. § 10381(g). \n \n2  Contrary to the dissent, Dissent at 1183 n.1, 1187–88, Congress has set aside funds that could be expended for any \n  of § 10381’s purposes. Appropriations bills have directed funds “for community policing development activities in \nfurtherance of [§ 10381’s purposes]” and “for the collaborative reform model of technical assistance in furtherance \nof [§ 10381’s purposes],” Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 115-31, Div. B, Tit. II, 131 Stat. 135, 207 (2017), as \nwell as for the hiring and rehiring of additional career law enforcement officers. \n \n18 \n \n\n \n \nCity of Los Angeles v. Barr, 929 F.3d 1163 (2019)   \n19 Cal. Daily Op. Serv. 6790, 2019 Daily Journal D.A.R. 6511 \n \n3  A § 287(g) partnership is a written agreement between the Attorney General and a state or a local jurisdiction, \n  under which “an officer or employee of the State or subdivision, who is determined by the Attorney General to be \nqualified to perform a function of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention \nof aliens in the United States (including the transportation of such aliens across State lines to detention centers), \nmay carry out such function at the expense of the State or political subdivision and to the extent consistent with \nState and local law.” 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1). \n \n4  An “immigration detainer” is issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to advise another law \n  enforcement agency that DHS seeks custody of an alien for arrest and removal, and serves as “a request that such \nagency advise the Department, prior to release of the alien, in order for the Department to arrange to assume \ncustody, in situations when gaining immediate physical custody is either impracticable or impossible.” 8 C.F.R. § \n287.7(a). Upon DHS’s request, a law enforcement agency “shall maintain custody of the alien for a period not to \nexceed 48 hours,” excluding weekends and holidays, “in order to permit assumption of custody by” DHS. Id. § \n287.7(d). \n \n5  According to DOJ, it “does not disclose the number of points assigned to any particular answer, because disclosing \n  the scoring system could skew the application process and subject that process to manipulation.” \n \n6  Our analysis requires us to bridge one gap in existing Spending Clause precedent—that the principles of Dole and \n  NFIB apply to agency-drawn conditions on grants to states and localities just as they do to conditions Congress \ndirectly places on grants. In both Dole and NFIB, Congress had written the challenged conditions directly into the \nstatutes authorizing the grants. Here, conversely, Congress delegated the task of specifying these conditions to DOJ. \nWe see no reason why the addition of an agency middleman either expands or contracts Congress’s power to \n“provide for the ... general Welfare,” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1, and thus analyze DOJ’s conditions under the \nprinciples of Dole and NFIB. \n \n7  Because DOJ’s scoring process does not coerce an applicant or authorize the federal government to exercise any \n  control over state or local law enforcement, it does not violate 34 U.S.C. § 10228(a), which states: “Nothing in this \nchapter or any other Act shall be construed to authorize any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United \nStates to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of \nany State or any political subdivision thereof.” Id. § 10228(a). We reject Los Angeles’s argument to the contrary. \n \n8  In addition to listing the immigration focus area, the Application Guidelines list multiple other focus areas, including \n  violent crime, traffic and pedestrian problems, and “quality of life policing.” While the Act does not expressly \nmention any of these focus areas, its gives DOJ broad discretion to identify and rank such a range of goals. Given \nDOJ’s authority to administer the grant program along these lines, the dissent’s argument that immigration \nenforcement cannot be a permissible focus area because the Act makes no mention of immigration enforcement, \nDissent at 1187, is meritless. \n \n9  Los Angeles argues that § 287(g) partnerships cannot be part of a federally funded initiative because 8 U.S.C. § \n  1357(g)(1) requires § 287(g) partnerships to be undertaken “at the expense of the State or political subdivision.” See \nalso Dissent at 1193 (stating that a local officer’s participation in a § 287(g) partnership “must be ‘at the expense of \nthe State or political subdivision’ ” (emphasis added) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1))). Los Angeles and the dissent \nmisunderstand both § 1357(g)(1) and the grant program. Section 1357(g)(1) clarifies only that states and localities \nare not entitled to federal reimbursement for work carried out in a § 287(g) partnerships. See 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g)(1) \n(stating that an officer or employee of the state or subdivision who is qualified to perform certain functions of an \nimmigration officer “may carry out such function at the expense of the State or political subdivision”). The statute \ndoes not forbid the use of federal funds to assist a state or local entity that has entered into such a partnership. \nMoreover, DOJ has made clear that grant funds may be used only to hire or rehire officers, not for any state or local \n19 \n \n\n \n \nCity of Los Angeles v. Barr, 929 F.3d 1163 (2019)   \n19 Cal. Daily Op. Serv. 6790, 2019 Daily Journal D.A.R. 6511 \n \nexpenses of a § 287(g) agreement. \n \n10  The dissent offers a lengthy political history of community-oriented policing, and asserts that Congress incorporated \n  the dissent’s view of the term “community-oriented policing” in the statute. Dissent at –1184–86, 1185 n.39. But \nCongress enacts statutory text, not political history, and the contours of “community-oriented policing” are not \n“unambiguously expressed by the statutory language.” Zuni Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 89 v. Dep’t of Educ., 550 U.S. 81, 93, \n127 S.Ct. 1534, 167 L.Ed.2d 449 (2007). “Policing” that is “oriented” toward the “community” can describe a broad \nset of policing techniques. These techniques may include direct police interactions with the community in some \ncircumstances. But the statute does not limit community-oriented policing to such strategies, and other techniques \nmay  be  better  suited  to  address  the  community’s  priorities,  such  as  public  safety  issues  related  to  illegal \nimmigration. As the dissent acknowledges, problem solving—“the process through which the specific concerns of \ncommunities are identified and through which the most appropriate remedies to abate these problems are \nfound”—is a key component of community-oriented policing, Dissent at 1184–85, and a range of different remedies \nmay be valid for furthering the statute’s public safety goals. In light of the statute’s broad purposes, we conclude \n“the language of the statute is broad enough to permit” DOJ’s reasonable definition of community-oriented policing. \nZuni Pub. Sch. Dist., 550 U.S. at 100, 127 S.Ct. 1534. \n \n11  Although unnecessary to our analysis, the legislative history of the Act supports DOJ’s broad interpretation of \n  community-oriented policing. While facilitating increased interaction between law enforcement and members of \nthe community was one focus of community-oriented policing as described in the legislative history, see H.R. Rep. \nNo. 103-324, at 6 (1993), the Judiciary Committee report on the bill also notes intent to reduce law enforcement’s \nreliance on reactive policing and renew law enforcement’s ability “to anticipate and prevent crime by use of \ncommunity-oriented, problem solving techniques,” id. DOJ’s definition of community-oriented policing incorporates \nthe focus on community interaction with the additional goal of supporting proactive policing that involves “analyzing \ncrime and disorder problems, working with the community on a search for alternative solutions, implementing \nsolutions, and evaluating their effectiveness.” Id. at 7. \n \n12  See, e.g., Bianca E.

Both are related to public safety; neither is related to community-oriented policing. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n24 \n ",
