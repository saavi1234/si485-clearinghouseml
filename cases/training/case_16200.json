    "summary": "<p>On December 7, 2016, an individual formerly detained in a D.C. jail filed this putative class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sued the District of Columbia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sought injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. The plaintiff claimed the district had violated his Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. </p><p>The complaint labeled the plaintiff as both the \"Overdetained Named Plaintiff\" and the \"Strip Search Named Plaintiff.\" As the \"Overdetained Named Plaintiff,\" he sought to represent a class consisting of \"(a) Each person who has been, is, or in the future will be incarcerated in any District of Columbia Department of Corrections facility from August 1, 2013 forward; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future, will not be released by midnight on the date on which the person is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise expired (or within two hours of being ordered released or otherwise becoming entitled to release if the person was a court return).\"</p><p>As the \"Strip Search Named Plaintiff,\" he sought to represent a class consisting of \"each member of the class who was, or in the future will be, from August 1, 2013, forward: (i) in the custody of the Department of Corrections; (ii) taken to court from a Department of Corrections facility; (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to release by virtue of the court appearance because the charge on which he had been held was no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was acquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was not the subject of any other pending case or cases which imposed any condition of release other than personal recognizance; (v) was not the subject of any detainer or warrant; (vi) was returned from court to the DC Jail or CTF or other District facility, to be processed out of Department of Corrections custody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search and/or visual body cavity search without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was concealing contraband or weapons; before being released, regardless of whether he was over-detained.\"</p><p>On March 21, 2017, the District of Columbia moved to dismiss the case, alleging that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.  On April 5, 2017, the plaintiff submitted an amended complaint. The amended complaint claimed that the harm experienced by the plaintiff was part of the District's revived pattern and practice of overdetention. These claims were brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  On April 19, 2017, the defendant again moved to dismiss. The motion alleged the same arguments as the previous motion to dismiss.  </p><p>On August 22, 2018, Judge Dabney L. Friedrich granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion to dismiss.  The court granted the District's motion to dismiss as to the plaintiff's claim that his over-detention constituted an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.  Judge Friedrich denied the district's motion to dismiss the claim that the plaintiff's over-detention violated his substantive due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.  Judge Friedrich also denied the motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claim for municipal liability.  The court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the claims that the strip searched violated the Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment.  As for the plaintiff's common law claims, the court dismissed the the false imprisonment, false arrest claims, and invasion of privacy claims. 322 F.Supp.3d 78 (D.D.C. 2018).</p><p>Eight days later, the plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration.  The plaintiff asked the court to reconsider the only common law claims.  The court held oral argument on April 3, 2019 on the issue of the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.  Although the plaintiff had only requested reconsideration on the common law claims, the briefings made it clear that the arguments on the common law claims implicitly challenged the dismissal of the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claims.  Two months later, Judge Friederich issued an opinion granting the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.  The judge restored the common law claims for false imprisonment (based in over-detention) and invasion of privacy (illegal strip searches) in full.  Judge Friederich restored the section 1983 claims for over-detention and illegal strip searches only to the extent that they asserted claims under the Fourth Amendment. 2019 WL 5690341 (D.D.C. 2019).</p><p>In September of 2019, the parties issued a joint status report informing the court that the issues in the case had been resolved. On October 16, 2019 Judge Friederich issued a stipulation of dismissal.  The parties agreed that the plaintiff's claims against the District of Columbia were resolved.  Information on how the parties resolved this case is not available.  The case was dismissed with prejudice.  The case is now closed.</p>",

But these issues are immaterial at this stage; plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed because \nhe fails to allege that his detention during the release processing procedures, however long, \nactually violated his constitutional rights, or how. This Court should also dismiss plaintiff’s strip \nsearch claim because a search of an inmate entering the general population of a jail is lawful, \neven when there is no individualized suspicion. Finally, plaintiff has inadequately pled claims for \ninvasion of privacy and false imprisonment because for both claims plaintiff fails to allege facts \nto comprise all the required elements.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiff’s Monell Claim Alleging Overdetention Should Be Dismissed.  \n \nA.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim Sufficient to Establish a Fourth Amendment \nViolation. \n \nPlaintiff fails to state a claim for a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free \nfrom unreasonable seizure, because overdetention does not constitute a seizure. See Barnes v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 793 F. Supp. 2d 260, 273-74 (D.D.C. 2011). In his opposition to the \nDistrict’s  motion,  plaintiff  cites  two  Florida  cases  and  one  Illinois  case  where  plaintiffs \nmaintained Fourth Amendment claims based on alleged overdetentions. Pl’s Opp. at 3, 9 [18]. \nThese cases are not controlling, directly conflict with this Court’s ruling in Barnes, and should \nnot be considered. See Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 273-74; see also District’s Mot. at 6 [17-1]. \nPlaintiff’s Fourth Amendment claim should be dismissed. \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 19   Filed 05/09/17   Page 5 of 9\nB.  Plaintiff  Fails  to  State  a  Claim  Sufficient  to  Establish  a  Fifth  Amendment \nProcedural Due Process Violation. \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint does not specify whether his Fifth Amendment claim alleges a \nviolation of his procedural or substantive due process rights. First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 155-58 [12]. \nNow, in opposition to the District’s motion, plaintiff claims he asserted a procedural due process \nclaim. See Pl’s Opp. at 19. But plaintiff fails to state a procedural due process claim because he \nhas not alleged he was deprived a procedural process. Even in his opposition, plaintiff again only \nargues that he had a liberty interest in being released—without addressing the missing procedural \ncomponent of his claim. Id. \n“Procedural due process traditionally protects an individual’s right to be heard ‘at a \nmeaningful time and in meaningful manner.’” Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at n.11. Plaintiff fails to \nstate what pre-deprivation process would be appropriate in the overdetention context, and it is \nnot intuitive. Accordingly, in Barnes when the plaintiffs did not specify whether their due \nprocess claim was substantive or procedural, the Court found plaintiffs’ claim was properly \nanalyzed as a substantive due process claim, not procedural. Id.; see also Otero v. Dart, No. \n12C3148, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1389, at *30 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 7, 2016) (“After careful research, \nthe Court has not found any legal authority concerning what pre-deprivation process would be \nappropriate  for  Plaintiff’s  overdetention  claim—most  likely  because  the  protections  under \nsubstantive due process are a better fit under the circumstances.”). Similarly here, the allegations \nin the Complaint do not state a claim for a procedural due process violation. \nC.  Plaintiff  Fails  to  State  a  Claim  Sufficient  to  Establish  a  Fifth  Amendment \nSubstantive Due Process Violation. \n \nPlaintiff also fails to state a claim sufficient to establish a Fifth Amendment substantive \ndue process violation. His Complaint is void of allegations specific to his detention that, taken as \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 19   Filed 05/09/17   Page 6 of 9\ntrue, could mean the District was “deliberately indifferent to his constitutional rights and that \nsuch conduct shocks the conscious.” See Cohen v. District of Columbia, 744 F. Supp. 2d 236, \n243 (D.D.C. 2010); District’s Mot. at 9-10. In fact, in the Complaint plaintiff acknowledges that \nadministrative processing following a release order is necessary. First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 62-64. \nPlaintiff fails to give any reason why his detention during the processing was “egregious” or \n“shocks the conscious.” See Pl’s Opp. at 10-11.  \nAlthough at this stage plaintiff receives the benefit of the facts in the Complaint and all \nreasonable inferences, he still must plead facts which could form the basis of a finding that the \nDistrict acted with deliberate indifference; his legal conclusions do not suffice. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Because plaintiff has not satisfied the pleading standard, his Fifth \nAmendment substantive due process claim should be dismissed. \nD.  Plaintiff  Fails  to  Adequately  Allege  That  the  District  Was  Deliberately \nIndifferent to His Constitutional Rights to Establish Monell Liability. \n \nIn his opposition, plaintiff argues that basis for Monell liability is the District’s deliberate \nindifference. But instead of pleading allegations which relate to current District practices or \nplaintiff’s  own  claim  of  overdetention,  the  Complaint  spends  pages  reciting  the  history  of \nconcluded litigation against DOC and an alleged overdetention of “Mr. Smith,” a non-party to \nthis case. See First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13-126. Deliberate indifference for Monell liability means the \nDistrict had actual or constructive knowledge plaintiff’s constitutional rights would likely be \nviolated. Warren v. District of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Plaintiff’s Complaint \nfalls well short.  \nThe only allegation of “deliberate indifference” plaintiff makes which he attempts to tie \nto his own alleged overdetention is “the District’s [use of an] antiquated paper driven release \nsystem” between the Superior Court and the Record’s Office at the D.C. Jail. See First Am. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 19   Filed 05/09/17   Page 7 of 9\nCompl. ¶¶ 17, 46; Pl’s Opp. at 30. But in his Complaint, plaintiff alleges the travel time from the \ncourthouse to the D.C. Jail is just over 10 minutes. First Am. Compl. ¶ 106. His grievances \nregarding  the  paper  “sneaker”  system  are  inadequate  to  form  the  basis  for  a  deliberate \nindifference finding. Because plaintiff has not pled, with respect to his alleged overdetention, \nthat the District adopted a policy of action or inaction that the District knew or should have \nknown  would  violate  his  constitutional  rights,  he  thus  fails  to  state  a  claim  for  deliberate \nindifference. \nII.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for an Unconstitutional Search. \n \nPlaintiff argues that when he returned from court he should have been treated as an \narrestee arrested on a minor offense who was awaiting a probable cause hearing. Pl’s Opp. at 40. \nBut plaintiff’s own Complaint states he had been properly detained by DOC to serve out a \nsentence; he was not an arrestee awaiting a probable cause hearing. First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 128-29. \nFurther, the Complaint states that a release order given at the court does not necessarily entitle an \ninmate to release. First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 25, 62-64. Meaning, at the time of plaintiff’s search he \nwas still properly in DOC custody as a convicted inmate, waiting for the completion of necessary \nprocessing and the determination of whether  he could be legally released;  his posture was \ndistinct from an individual who has not yet had a probable cause hearing for their detention. \nBecause plaintiff was still an inmate, he was subject to search without individualized suspicion. \nSee District’s Mot. at 14-16. His strip search claim should be dismissed. \nIII.  Plaintiff’s Common Law Claims Should Be Dismissed For Failure to State a Claim. \n \nA.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for False Imprisonment or False Arrest. \n \nContrary to plaintiff’s argument, Pl’s Opp. at 31-33, it is not clear from the allegations of \nClaim 4 that plaintiff intended to allege false imprisonment. The Complaint fails to provide any \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 19   Filed 05/09/17   Page 8 of 9\nallegations beyond claiming that general legal principles regarding torts, e.g. respondeat superior \nand proximate cause, apply. The only other sentence in the claim merely alleges the District held \nJones beyond the time he was entitled to be released. This allegation is repeated throughout the \nComplaint and is not unique to a claim for false imprisonment. See First Am. Compl. ¶ 23. \nAs a result of plaintiff’s vague and inadequate pleading, plaintiff failed to plead the \nelements of false arrest or false imprisonment in Claim 4. Plaintiff also failed to meet his burden \nto provide sufficient allegations to put defendant on notice regarding his claim. Cf. Brown w. \nSessoms, 774 F.3d 1016, 1022 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (defendant had notice of the claims because of \nthe clear and concise allegations pled). For these reasons, the Court should dismiss Claim 4, \nentitled “Common Law Liability of District of Columbia for False Arrest.” \nB.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for Invasion of Privacy. \n \nPlaintiff’s invasion of privacy claim should be dismissed because plaintiff failed to allege \nthe search was subjectively offensive—an element to the claim of invasion of privacy. See Wolf \nv. Regardie, 553 A.2d 1213, 1217 (D.C. 1989). “Describing the strip search in detail,” Pl’s Opp. \nat 45, is inadequate to satisfy plaintiff’s pleading obligations. While the description of the search \nmay, arguably, be used to find that the search was objectively offensive, it does not provide a \nbasis from which to find the search was subjectively offensive to plaintiff. Plaintiff’s failure to \nplead the subjectivity element should be fatal to his claim.  \n    CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons and those stated in  the District’s Motion  to  Dismiss and \nmemorandum in support, the Court should dismiss the Complaint with prejudice. \nDated:  May 9, 2017.

This is an action brought by each of Richard Jones (the “Overdetention Named \nPlaintiff”) on his own behalf and on behalf of the class defined below injured (or presently subject \nto injury) by the Government of the District of Columbia’s recently revived pattern and practice of \nallowing its Department of Corrections to overdetain inmates, and by the District’s deliberate \nindifference to the effect of the practice of overdetention on the rights of inmates.  To overdetain \nmeans holding a detainee or prisoner in a District of Columbia Department of Corrections \n(\"Department of Corrections\") facility past midnight of his or her release date, as defined below.   \n2.  This is also an action brought by Richard Jones (the \"Strip Search Named Plaintiff\") \non his own behalf and on behalf of a Strip Search Class of individuals who were injured (or \npresently subject to injury) by the District’s conduct in subjecting them to blanket strip searches \nand visual body cavity searches (both described below) after they were returned to a Department of \nCorrections facility after a judicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their \ndetention, other than to be processed for release, and by District’s deliberate indifference to the \neffect of the practice of blanket strip searches and visual body cavity searches on the rights of \ninmates. \n3.  Mr. Jones also brings common law over-detention (false imprisonment) and strip-\nsearch (invasion of privacy) claims. Mr. Jones timely submitted “12-309” notice to the District \npursuant to D.C. Code § 12-309 on behalf of himself and the classes. \n4.   The Overdetained Named Plaintiff brings this action against the Government of \nthe District of Columbia under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to \nenforce the Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendments, for injuries suffered by them, because the \nDistrict overdetained them and other members of the class at a Department of Corrections facility. \n \n  2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 1   Filed 12/07/16   Page 3 of 14\n5.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiff brings this action against the Government of the \nDistrict of Columbia under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to \nenforce the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, for injuries suffered by them, because the District \nsubjected them and the class to the blanket strip searches. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Overdetained Named Plaintiff and Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiff’ § 1983 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3).   \n7.  Venue is appropriate in this District.  Each of the claims for relief arose in this \njudicial district. \nClass Action Allegations \n8.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiff bring this action under Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting of: (a) Each person who has \nbeen, is, or in the future will be incarcerated in any District of Columbia Department of \nCorrections facility from August 1, 2013 forward; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future, \nwill not be released by midnight on the date on which the person is entitled to be released by court \norder or the date on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise expired (or within two \nhours of being ordered released or otherwise becoming entitled to release if the person was a court \nreturn). \n9.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiff also bring this action under Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting of each member of the class \nwho was, or in the future will be, from August 1, 2013, forward: (i) in the custody of the \nDepartment of Corrections; (ii) taken to court from a Department of Corrections facility; (iii) \nordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to release by virtue of the court \n \n  3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 1   Filed 12/07/16   Page 4 of 14\nappearance because the charge on which he had been held was no longer pending or was \ndismissed at the hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, was \nsentenced to time served, was acquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was not the subject \nof any other pending case or cases which imposed any condition of release other than personal \nrecognizance; (v) was not the subject of any detainer or warrant; (vi) was returned from court to the \nDC Jail or CTF or other District facility, to be processed out of Department of Corrections \ncustody; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search and/or visual body cavity search without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was concealing \ncontraband or weapons; before being released, regardless of whether he was overdetained. \n10.  Certification of these two classes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate, because the District of Columbia has a pattern and practice that has uniformly \naffected all members of both classes, and injunctive relief against the District will benefit each and \nevery plaintiff and class member. Although the District had agreed to stop these practices, and \nindeed had done so in the context of the settlement of Bynum v. District of Columbia , Civil \nAction No. 02-956 (RCL) and Barnes v. District of Columbia, 06-315 (RCL), the practices stop \nhave not stopped based on public filings and discussions with attorneys practicing in the District \ncourts. \n11.  The classes are entitled to injunctive relief on their § 1983 claims, for example, \nsetting up an independent monitor to supervise the Department of Corrections' inmate \nmanagement system to ensure that all inmates are released on or before their release dates, and \nother relief as specified below. \n12.  Regarding the Overdetained Named Plaintiff, and members of the class, there are \nno individual questions on the issue of liability other than whether an individual has been \n \n  4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 1   Filed 12/07/16   Page 5 of 14\noverdetained, and the answer to that question can be determined by ministerial inspection of the \nDepartment of Corrections' records. \n13.  Computer records and DOC over-detention reports are available for inspection on \nthe overdetentions and the strip-searches.  \n14.  Regarding the Strip Search Named Plaintiff, and members of the Strip Search \nClass, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability, because neither the DC Jail nor \nCTF keeps records of the searches and therefore neither the DC Jail nor CTF can show that any \nof the searches were conducted based on an individual determination of reasonable suspicion. \n15.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the classes are: \na)   whether the Constitution provides a maximum length of time \nmeasured in hours beyond which the District cannot hold a person to perform \nadministrative tasks incident to release before releasing that person from jail;  \nb)   whether the District has exceeded that maximum for each class \nmember; \nc)  whether the District has a pattern and practice of holding detainees \nand inmates past their release dates; \nd)  whether the District has a pattern and practice of being deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of detainees and inmates by holding them past their release \ndates; \ne)  whether the District’s acts as alleged herein violate the Constitution \nof the United States by holding detainees and inmates past their release dates; \n \n  5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 1   Filed 12/07/16   Page 6 of 14\nf)  whether the District has a policy of and practice of subjecting \npersons to blanket strip searches and visual body cavity searches after they have \nbecome entitled to release; \ng)  whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fourth and/or \nFifth Amendments; and \nh)  whether plaintiffs and the members of the Overdetention Class and \nthe Strip Search Class and future members are entitled to equitable relief, and, if \nso, what is the nature of that relief. \n16.  Each of the Overdetention Class and the Strip Search Class is so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable.  The exact number of Overdetention Class and Strip \nSearch Class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is likely to consist of at least one \nhundred people, and likely substantially more than that. \n17.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiff’ claims are typical of the claims of the other \nmembers of the class, as plaintiffs and all other members of the class were injured by exactly the \nsame means, that is, by the overdetentions. \n18.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiff’ claims are typical of the claims of the other \nmembers of the Strip Search Class, as the Strip Search Named Plaintiff and all other members of \nthe Strip Search Class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the blanket strip \nsearches. \n19.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiff and the Strip Search Named Plaintiff will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the members of the Overdetention Class and Strip Search \nClass and have retained counsel who are competent and experienced in complex federal civil \nrights class action litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n \n  6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 1   Filed 12/07/16   Page 7 of 14\n20.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiff and Strip Search Named Plaintiff have no \ninterests that are contrary to or in conflict with those of the class or Strip Search Class. \nParties \n21.  Plaintiff Richard Jones held past his Release Date at the DC Jail and was strip \nsearched without reasonable suspicion after being ordered to be released from custody. \n22.  The District Government of the District of Columbia (hereinafter the District of \nColumbia or the District) is a municipal corporation capable of being sued under D.C. Code § 1-\n102. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nComponents of the Department of Corrections \n23.  The District of Columbia Department of Corrections holds prisoners committed \nby the District of Columbia Superior Court, the District of Columbia District Court, and other \nagencies, in the Central Detention Facility (“DC Jail”), the Correctional Treatment Facility (\"CTF\") \nand at various halfway houses located in the District of Columbia. \n24.  Most prisoners held in the custody of the Department of Corrections are either \npre-trial detainees, misdemeanants serving sentences, or parole and probation violators.  \nThe Inmate Management System \n25.  The records office located at the DC Jail (\"Records Office\") is responsible for \nadministering and maintaining the records, including the judgment and commitment files, of all \npersons housed at the DC Jail, CTF and the halfway houses. \n26.  The Records Office is responsible for ensuring that all persons housed at the DC \nJail, CTF and the halfway houses are released according to their Release Dates specified in their \ncourt orders. \n \n  7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 1   Filed 12/07/16   Page 8 of 14\n27.  The District of Columbia Superior Court enforces a policy pursuant to which an in-\ncustody-defendant or a defendant ordered into custody may not leave the courtroom without an \norder (commitment order or release order) for each case on which he appeared. \nThe Overdetention Problem \n28.  \"Overdetain\" means holding a detainee or prisoner in Department of Corrections' \ncustody past the person’s release date. \n29.  “Release Date” for each detainee or inmate is the day on which the person is \nentitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis for his or her detention has \notherwise expired. \n30.  “Exit Date” for each detainee or inmate is the day on which the person is actually \nreleased from the custody of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections. \n31.  The Department of Corrections had a long and documented history of \noverdetaining detainees and inmates past their release dates.   \n32.  The Department of Corrections, in response to a class action lawsuit, instituted \nreforms that ameliorated and for periods eliminated the overdetention problem. \n33.  However, on information and belief, and based on publically available filing, the \nDepartment of Corrections has again begun overdetaining large numbers of inmates. \nThe Court Return Strip Search Problem \n34.  Prior to late 2000 or early 2001, the Department of Corrections followed a practice \nunder which most inmates taken from custody of the Department of Corrections to court and \nordered released by a judicial officer because the charge was no longer pending or because of a \nchange in conditions of release was returned to the DC Jail or CTF for processing for release \nrather than being released from the courthouse. \n \n  8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 1   Filed 12/07/16   Page 9 of 14\n35.  In late 2000 or early 2001, the Department of Corrections instituted a policy under \nwhich every inmates taken from custody of the Department of Corrections to court and ordered \nreleased by a judicial officer because the charge was no longer pending or because of a change in \nconditions of release was returned to the DC Jail or CTF for processing for release rather than \nbeing released from the courthouse. \n36.  In August 2005 the Department of Corrections instituted a policy of diverting in-\ncustody defendants ordered released or otherwise entitled to release from the Superior Court of \nthe District of Columbia to a holding facility on the grounds of DC General Hospital where they \nwould not be subject to a strip search, absent individualized suspicion, while the record review for \ndetainers and warrants and property retrieval was conducted prior to release.  \n37.  However, the Department of Corrections has been returning some in-custody \ndefendants entitled to release from the courthouses to the DC Jail or CTF and subjecting them to \nstrip searches after a judge has ordered their release without a finding of individual reasonable \nsuspicion.  \n38.  The DOC is supposed to make releases from the courthouses but it does not \nreliably do so. \n39.  The exact cause of the recent overdetentions and illegal court return strip searches \nis not known, but the causes, on information and belief, include recurring problems with the DC \nJail’s computerized inmate population accounting system and the Records Office. \nPlaintiff Richard Jones’ Overdetention by the DC Jail \n40.  On or about 12/7/15 Plaintiff Richard Jones, while in the custody of the DOC was \nsent to the federal courthouse for a hearing.  \n \n  9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 1   Filed 12/07/16   Page 10 of 14\n41.  Mr. Jones was ordered released but instead of being released from the courthouse \nor the MHU the DOC transported him to the DC Jail and did not release him for several hours. \n42.  Plaintiff Jones has suffered damages as a result of the over detention. \nPlaintiff Richard Jones’s Strip Search \n43.  On 12/7/15 Plaintiff Richard Jones was taken to Court and the Judge ordered his \nrelease. \n44.  Plaintiff Richard Jones was entitled to release on 12/7/15. \n45.  But, instead of being released or diverted to the holding facility at DC General or \nreleased from the courthouse on 12/7/15, Plaintiff Carl A. Barnes was returned to the DC Jail’s \ngeneral population and subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity search without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was concealing \ncontraband or weapons even though a court had ordered his release. \n46.

Mr. Jones files this First Amended Complaint by right under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(a) \nbecause he files the First Amended Complaint within 21 days of the District’s filing its motion [10] \nto dismiss the original complaint. \n2.  This is an action brought by Richard Jones (the “Overdetention Named Plaintiff”) on his \nown behalf and on behalf of the class defined below injured (or presently subject to injury) by the \nGovernment of the District of Columbia’s (the “District’s”) revived pattern and practice of allowing \nits Department of Corrections to overdetain inmates, and by the District’s deliberate indifference \nto the effect of the practice of overdetention on the rights of inmates.  To overdetain means \nholding a detainee or prisoner in a District of Columbia Department of Corrections (\"Department \n \n  1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 2 of 28\nor DOC\") facility past 10 pm of the date on which they are entitled to release (“Release Date”) (or \nmore than two hours after being ordered released or otherwise becoming entitled to release if the \nperson was a court return), as defined below. The date and time on which a detainee is entitled to \nrelease is their Release Time. \n3.  Mr. Jones also brings the Over-detention Claim pursuant to the Due Process clause of the \nFifth Amendment because District of Columbia statutes create a liberty interest in release by 10 \npm on the Release Date per D.C. Code § 24-201.06 and D.C. Code § 24-211.02a and for an \ninmate ordered released pursuant to a court order within 5 hours of transfer from the custody of \nthe United States Marshals Service into the custody of the Department of Corrections per D.C. \nCode § 24-211.02a. \n4.  This is also an action brought by Richard Jones (the \"Strip Search Named Plaintiff\") on his \nown behalf and on behalf of a Strip Search Class of individuals who were injured (or presently \nsubject to injury) by the District’s conduct in subjecting them to blanket strip searches and visual \nbody cavity searches pursuant to the Department’s policy of subjecting all persons committed to \nthe DC Jail of a strip-search regardless of cause after they were returned to the DC Jail and strip-\nsearched after a judicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their detention. \n5.  Mr. Jones also brings common law over-detention (false imprisonment) and strip-search \n(invasion of privacy) claims. Mr. Jones timely submitted “12-309” notice to the District pursuant to \nD.C. Code § 12-309 on behalf of himself and the classes. \n6.   The Overdetained Named Plaintiff brings this action against the Government of the \nDistrict of Columbia under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to \nenforce the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and under District of Columbia common law, for \ninjuries suffered by him and the class members, because the District overdetained him and other \n \n  2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 3 of 28\nmembers of the class at a Department of Corrections facility. \n7.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiff brings this action against the Government of the District \nof Columbia under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, to enforce the \nFourth and Fifth Amendments, and under District of Columbia common law, for injuries suffered \nby him, because the District subjected him and the class members to the blanket strip searches. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Overdetained Named Plaintiff and Strip Search \nNamed Plaintiff’s § 1983 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3).  \n9.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the Overdetained Named Plaintiff and the \nStrip Search Named Plaintiff’s common law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  1367. \n10.  Venue is appropriate in this District.  Each of the claims for relief arose in this judicial \ndistrict. \nParties \n11.  Plaintiff Richard Jones was over-detained at the DC Jail and was strip searched at the DC \nJail without reasonable suspicion after being ordered to be released from custody. \n12.  The District Government of the District of Columbia (hereinafter the District of Columbia \nor the District) is a municipal corporation capable of being sued under D.C. Code § 1-102. \nFactual Allegations \n13.  For over 20 years the District has run a jail system that systemically holds people past their \nrelease dates and subjects court returns entitled to release to degrading and unnecessary blanket \npost release strip searches.  \n14.  The cause of the over-detentions and illegal post release strip searches of court returns \nentitled to release was and remains the District of Columbia’s maintaining a release system in the \n \n  3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 4 of 28\nDOC which in toto simply delays all releases until the system, in its sweet time, and with the \nresources the government of the District of Columbia chooses provide it, is ready to make releases \nof inmates from DOC facilities. \n15.  Regardless of the lawfulness of its release polices the District implements them in a way \nthat violates the constitutional rights of inmates.  \n16.  The District’s system gave great weight to the “only societal interests that justify delay \n[which] are ensuring that prisoners are not released if they have warrants, or detainers, and efficient \nmarshaling of scarce resources” and gave practically no weight to “the prisoner's absolute right to \nfreedom” in a prompt release. Barnes v. District of Columbia,  242 F.R.D. 113, 117-118 (D.D.C. \n2007). The system attaches weight to the governmental interests involved in releases but \ndisregarded the interests of the inmate in a prompt release. \n17.  The DOC with the full knowledge of the D.C. Council and the Mayor has blindly followed \npractices that required release dispositions to be transmitted from the Superior Court to the \nRecords Office at the DC Jail in paper format by hand in the first place, and then the District, \nespecially the DOC, “inefficiently implemented” the procedures in the system for transmitting \norders from the courtrooms to the Records Office in ways that caused significant delays and losses \nin the transmission of the orders.  \n18.  The DOC’s determination to (1) make releases at the DC Jail or and only occasionally at \nthe courthouses, and to process releases (2) on the basis of paper orders (as opposed to docket \nentries or electronically transmitted orders) (3) hand carried back to the Records Office, and the \n“inefficiently implemented” procedures in the system for transmitting orders added hours and \nsometimes days to the release process.  \n19.  The DOC’s “inefficient implementation” of its procedures for making releases added \n \n  4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 5 of 28\nfurther delay. The DOC runs a paper system for tracking cases and releases and misplaces jackets, \nmisfiles orders, and runs the system manually. The “inefficient implementation” of the District's \nrelease procedures is the result of official “acquiescence in a longstanding practice or custom which \nconstitutes the standard operation procedure of the local government entity.” \nDistrict of Columbia Department of Corrections \n20.  The District of Columbia Department of Corrections holds prisoners committed by the \nDistrict of Columbia Superior Court, the District of Columbia District Court, and other agencies, \nin the Central Detention Facility (“DC Jail”), the Correctional Treatment Facility (\"CTF\") and at \nvarious halfway houses located in the District of Columbia. \n21.  Most prisoners held in the custody of the Department of Corrections are either pre-trial \ndetainees, misdemeanants serving short sentences, or parole and probation violators.  \nThe Inmate Management System \n22.  The records office located at the DC Jail (\"Records Office\") is responsible for administering \nand maintaining the records, including the judgment and commitment files, of all persons housed \nat the DC Jail, CTF and the halfway houses. \n23.  The Records Office is responsible for ensuring that all persons housed at the DC Jail, CTF \nand the halfway houses are released according to their Release Dates and Release Times specified \nin their court orders. \n24.  The DOC through its Records Office enforces a policy of treating court return (each \nperson who leaves a DOC facility for court and returns on the same day) as subject to their original \ncommitment order if the court return returns to the Jail or other facility without a release order for \neach case on which they are being held/ \n \n  5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 6 of 28\n25.  A person may be subject to commitment on more than one case or charge. \nThe Overdetention Problem \n26.  \"Overdetain\" means holding a detainee or prisoner in Department of Corrections' custody \npast the person’s Release Time on their Release Date. \n27.  “Release Date” for each detainee or inmate is the day on which the person is entitled to be \nreleased by court order or the date on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise \nexpired. \n28.  “Release Time” is the date and time on which a detainee is entitled to release. \n29.  “Exit Date” for each detainee or inmate is the day on which the person is actually released \nfrom the custody of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections. \n30.  The Department of Corrections had a long and documented history of overdetaining \ndetainees and inmates past their Release Dates and Release Times.   \n31.  The Department of Corrections, in response to class action lawsuits, instituted reforms that \nameliorated and for periods eliminated the overdetention problem. \n32.  However, based on publically available filing, the Department of Corrections has again \nbegun overdetaining large numbers of inmates. \nThe Court Return Strip Search Problem \n33.  Prior to late 2000 or early 2001, the Department of Corrections followed a practice under \nwhich most inmates taken from custody of the Department of Corrections to court and ordered \nreleased by a judicial officer because the charge was no longer pending or because of a change in \nconditions of release was returned to the DC Jail or CTF for processing for release rather than \nbeing released from the courthouse. \n34.  In late 2000 or early 2001, the Department of Corrections instituted a policy under which \n \n  6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 7 of 28\nevery inmates taken from custody of the Department of Corrections to court and ordered released \nby a judicial officer because the charge was no longer pending or because of a change in conditions \nof release was returned to the DC Jail or CTF for processing for release rather than being released \nfrom the courthouse. \n35.  In August 2005 the Department of Corrections instituted a policy of diverting in-custody \ndefendants ordered released or otherwise entitled to release from the Superior Court of the \nDistrict of Columbia to a holding facility on the grounds of DC General Hospital (“MHU”) where \nthey would not be subject to a strip search, absent individualized suspicion, while the record review \nfor detainers and warrants and property retrieval was conducted prior to release.  \n36.  However, the Department of Corrections has been returning some in-custody defendants \nentitled to release from the courthouses to the DC Jail or CTF and subjecting them to strip \nsearches after a judge has ordered their release without a finding of individual reasonable \nsuspicion.  \n37.  The DOC is supposed to make releases from the courthouses but it does not reliably do \nso. \n38.  The exact cause of the recent overdetentions and illegal court return strip searches is not \nknown, but the causes, on information and belief, include recurring problems with the DC Jail’s \ncomputerized inmate population accounting system and the Records Office  and the problems \ndescribed below. \nSplit system connected by a “sneaker network” \n39.  The District, especially the DOC, compounded the inefficiencies inherent in the “split” \nsystem by the DOC’s solution to the problem of how to communicate data, especially release \ndispositions, between the two systems.  \n \n  7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 8 of 28\n40.  The DOC’s solution, largely dictated by the DOC’s longstanding practices by which DOC \ninsisted on making releases based on paper orders hand carried back to the Records Office at DC \nJail, and DOC’s insistence on making releases from either the DC Jail or MHU, was to set up a \n“sneaker” network in which orders and other paperwork associated with in-custody defendants \ntraveling to and from the courthouse and the jail was hand carried.  \n41.  Moreover, the District, especially the DOC, administered the “sneaker” network poorly in \nways that created significant delay in the release process because of the “split” system structure and \nthe inefficient and delay laden manner in which the DOC administered it. The DOC is the agency \nthat has responsibility for processing releases.   \n42.  Put another way, the DOC is the agency that blocks the releases of court returns entitled to \nrelease until the DOC has obtained their release dispositions in the form it wants (paper copies), \nand transported the “body1” to the place it chooses to make the release (DC Jail, MHU, and as of \nJuly 2008 the Superior Court).   \n43.  The DOC is the agency that has responsibility for obtaining orders for all inmates in its \ncustody so it can make prompt releases. \n44.  Once of the major causes of the District’s over-detention and court return strip-search \nproblem is that it runs a split system, that is, the DOC sends prisoners to the courthouses for \nhearings at which the court returns receive paper release or commitment orders, and then the \nDOC Records Office processes releases based on the paper orders.  \n                                                 \n1 Each court return going to the courthouse is “body” as distinguished from his “paperwork” \nsuch as a court order or a “buck slip” or a Form 40 (manifest listing all bodies on a transport \nvehicle).  Sometimes the body and the paperwork travel separately and sometimes they travel \ntogether.  Plaintiffs do not intend any disrespect in using the term “body” as opposed to \n \n  8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 9 of 28\n45.  Compounding the problem is that each system uses its own database (the Superior Court \nuses CourtView and the DOC uses JACCS) that cannot communicate directly over an electronic \nnetwork. \n46.  Instead, a “sneaker network” of DOC transport officers transmitting the orders by hand \nconnects the two systems. \n47.  In contrast, the MPD arrest booking database communicates via network with the Superior \nCourt booking system so data about arrestees is transmitted electronically from the MPD system to \nthe CourtView system. \n48.  This is both quicker and more error free. \n49.  Every release / commitment order issued by the Superior Court or the District Court has \nto be hand carried from the courtroom clerk by the courthouse Marshals to DOC staff in the \ncourthouse who carry it back to the Records Office with the court returns on the transport vehicles \nto the Records Office and then re-entered manually into the DOC system. \n50.  It is a fundamental premise of data management that every time data has to be re-entered \ninto a system by hand is an opportunity for error. \n51.  Despite years of knowing about the problems caused by transmitting papers orders by hand \nthe DOC has refused to engineer a system of electronically transmitting release / commitment data \nfrom the courthouses to the Records Office system. \n52.  Every release / commitment order issued by a judge is printed out in duplicate, one copy \nfor the court and one copy for the DOC. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nindividual or person.  Body is merely a translation of the venerable Latin term “corpus” (as in \n“habeas corpus”) and is intended to distinguish between the body and the paperwork. \n \n  9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 10 of 28\n53.  The District even refuses to set up a network to link the courtroom computers with the \nRecords Office so that paper orders printed out by the courtroom clerks will print in the Records \nOffice. \n54.  Networking printers at remote locations is so simple these days that people can go online \nand print documents remotely at their local copy/ print center.  \nDOC runs a paper system for tracking cases \n55.  The DOC’s Records Office maintains records for each inmate and processes their releases \nand commitments. \n56.  The DOC runs a paper system for tracking cases. \n57.  Each inmate has a paper hard copy file (their “jacket”). \n58.  Even though the DOC maintains an electronic inmate management system database \n(JACCS) each commitment and release requires a review of official hard copy documentation in \nan inmate's file and the review of hard copy documents provides the primary basis for making \nrelease determinations. \n59.  The District’s Records Office runs the system manually and frequently misplaces jackets, \nmisfiles orders, and fails to process commitments and releases reliably.  \nThe District’s system for handling court returns  \n60.  Every day that court is in session the District sends inmates to the Superior Court and the \nDistrict Court for court appearances. \n61.  After a court return appears in court the court return is ordered held or released. \n62.  Just because a court return receives a single release order does not mean that they are \nautomatically entitled to release. \n \n  10 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 11 of 28\n63.  A court return sent to court on more than charge or case may receive a release order in \none case and a commitment order in another. \n64.  Similarly, a court return who receives release orders in all cases on which they went to \ncourt may be subject to continued detention on other cases or subject to a detainer or a warrant. \n65.  And a court return who was convicted and sentenced may also be entitled to release on that \ncase even if they are convicted (e.g., person sentenced to time served or probation only). \n66.  It is the job of the Licensed Record Examiners (“LIEs or records examiners”) in the \nRecords Office to process releases by reviewing an inmate’s “jacket” and determining whether an \ninmate is entitled to release if they received release orders on all the cases on which they went to \ncourt or otherwise became entitled to release (e.g., prosecutor dismissed the case, person \nsentenced to time served or probation only) and there are no other cases on which the person is \nbeing held and they are not subject to detainers or warrants. \n67.  Until about 2000 the DOC maintained one or more records examiners in the Superior \nCourt courthouse to process releases of court returns entitled to release so they could be released \ndirectly from the Superior Court or District Court instead of being returned to the DC Jail for out-\nprocessing (all releases from the DC Jail or CTF are processed by the Records Office and all \npersons released from CTF or the DC Jail pass through the DC Jail’s R&D (Receiving and \nDischarge) post.  \n68.  But, because the Records Office became so inefficient and unreliable it could not process \nthe daily stream of court returns entitled to release and the DOC had to start returning all court \nreturns including court returns entitled to release back to the DC Jail for release processing. \n69.  Returning court returns entitled to release to the DC Jail for processing causes two types of \nproblems. \n \n  11 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 12 of 28\n70.  One, it reduces the Records Office’s ability to process releases because it burdens the \nsystem in the jail with inmates who should already have been released. This affects not only court \nreturns entitled to release but all other persons in the DOC entitled to release. \n71.  Two, it subjects court returns entitled to release to degrading and humiliating strip-searches \nbecause all persons committed to the DC Jail are (because of official written DOC policy) \nsubjected to blanket (i.e., all persons regardless of suspicion) strip-searches even court returns \nentitled to release. \n72.  In the Bynum Settlement (the class action settlement in Bynum v. District of Columbia, 02-\n956 (RCL), a class action brought against the District by persons who were over-detained and \nsubjected to unconstitutional post release strip-searches, the District addressed some of these \nproblems by agreeing to divert court returns entitled to release to a processing facility outside the \nDC Jail, the Medical Holding Unit or “MHU,” where they could stay while the Records Office \nprocessed their entitlement to release to avoid burdening the DC Jail with the flow of court returns \nentitled to release (which affected the Records Office’s capacity to process all releases) and so \ncourt returns entitled to release would not have to undergo strip-searches. \n73.  The DOC also agreed to build a new Inmate Processing Center outside the DC Jail to \nprocess releases of court returns entitled to release so they would not have to reenter the DC Jail \nfor out-processing. \n74.  But, in practice, the DOC did neither. The DOC never built the Inmate Processing Center \nand the DOC only sporadically diverted court returns entitled to release to the MHU for release.  \n75.  In fact, in the first year after the Bynum Settlement, the DOC over-detained at least 1,244 \ncourt returns entitled to release who did not get released because the DOC could not process \nreleases before 10:00 p.m. \n \n  12 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 13 of 28\n76.  Because of a District of Columbia statute enacted by the D.C. Council in early 2000s, the \nDC Jail could not make releases after 10 pm (the 10 pm cut-off statute).  \n77.       A new class action was filed against the District by persons who were over-detained and \nsubjected to unconstitutional post release strip-searches, Barnes v. District of Columbia, 06-315 \n(RCL). \n78.  As a result of the Barnes case, the DOC began making courthouse releases of \nmisdemeanor (and certain felony) releases and the DOC began diverting more court returns \nentitled to release to MHU for release processing. \n79.  Judge Lamberth also declared the 10 pm cut-off statute unconstitutional and the DOC \nbegan making releases after midnight. \n80.  For a certain period of time the over-detention and related strip-search problem was \nresolved. \n81.  But, by 2013, the problem had returned.  \nSnith v. District of Columbia and the District’s system for handling court returns \n82.  Discovery and the pleadings in the case of Snith v. District of Columbia, 15-161 (ABJ), \nillustrates the problems caused by the split system and its reliance of paper records which caused \nthe overdetentions and strip-searches of Mr. Jones and the class members as well as the over-\ndetention and strip-search of Mr. Smith.  \n83.  On March 18, 2014, Judge Juliet McKenna of the Superior Court ordered Mr. Gregory \nSmith to be released in the two cases on which he had been committed to the DC Jail. \n84.  She issued two paper release orders. \n85.  One was hand carried back to the Records Office in a matter of hours on the transport \nvehicle with Mr. Smith. \n \n  13 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 14 of 28\n86.  Mr. Smith was not released at the courthouse nor was he diverted to MHU even though he \nhad at least one release order. \n87.  When Mr. Smith arrived at the R&D post in the DC Jail (all persons committed to the \nDOC are processed into the system in R&D which examines their commitment paperwork as they \narrive), he told the R&D officers that he was entitled to release on both of his cases. \n88.  The other release order did not arrive until 9:33 that night. \n89.  R&D staff did not investigate his claims. \n90.  Because they found only one release order they assumed per DOC policy that he was still \nsubject to detention on his other case so they subjected him to a strip-search and retuned him to \nhis cell. \n91.  The Records Office processed one of his orders but not the other.  \n92.  As a result, because the DOC treats a court return coming back to the DC Jail without a \nrelease order as still subject to their original commitment, the Records Office continued to hold \nMr. Smith. \n93.  For some reason, even though the Records Office received the second order, the Records \nOffice never processed it. \n94.  As a result, Mr. Smith was over-detained for 23 days. \n95.  The Records Office obviously did not do any quality assurance on Mr. Smith’s release \ndecision after March 18, 2014.  \n96.  If they had, a simple check of the CourtView system (the online CourtView system is the \nofficial docket of the Superior Court) would have revealed that he was entitled to release in both \ncases. \n \n  14 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 15 of 28\n97.  The DOC never even discovered that he was over-detained even though Mr. Smith did not \nappear for an April 10, 2014 court appearance in one of the case. \n98.  Moreover, the Records Office never reported the over-detention after it was discovered so \nit was not entered into the early warning system used to track over-detentions and their causes so \nthe DOC can diagnose and correct problems in the system.   \n99.  The District’s deliberate indifference to inmate’s right to timely release is illustrated by how \nthe District’s implementation of its procedures disregard’s inmate rights. \n100.  The DOC is supposed to release court returns entitled to release from the courthouse or \ndivert them to MHU. The DOC failed to implement its policy here. \n101.  The DOC failed to promptly transport his release/ commitment orders to the Records \nOffice. Sending orders electronically would have obviated this long standing problem of failing to \npromptly get release orders to the Records Office. \n102.  Mr. Smith reported his right to release to R&D staff but they failed to investigate. \n103.  The Records Office failed to check CourtView to see his release status in his order case. \n104.  Most significantly and most indicative of a over-detention systemic problem is that a senior \nRecords Office manager failed to make an over-detention report when the over-detention was \ndiscovered. \nDeliberate indifference to over-detentions \n105.    Releasing inmates from custody within two hours from when they become entitled to \nrelease is the norm for any system of the District’s size that places any weight on the inmate’s \ninterest in a prompt release. \n \n  15 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 16 of 28\n106.  The DC jail is located at1901 E Street, SE, Washington, DC 20003. The superior \nCourthouse is located at 555 Indiana Ave., N.W., Washington, DC 20001. According to Google's \n“get directions,” the jail is 2.7 miles from the Superior Courthouse and the travel time is 10 \nminutes. \n107.  According to DOC data since 2013 the inmate population has gone down almost every \nyear since 2013 from 1718 inmates in 2013 to 1252 in 2016. \n108.  The number of releases the DOC processes has gone down every year from 12,976 in \n2013 to only 8,500 in 2016. \n109.  The maximum number of court returns sent to court on any day is approximately 100 to \n150 and of that number only about 10 percent become entitled to release as a result of their court \nevents. \n110.  A quick comparison with over-detention figures for the LA County Jail for similar periods \nunderscores the point. The LA County Jail System is the largest in the country. \n111.  The LA County Jail System books and releases about 200,000 individuals into the jail \nsystem in a given year (compared with the District’s current 11277 or less) through its Inmate \nReception Center. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, 17th Semiannual Report, by \nSpecial Counsel Merrick J. Bobb and Staff and Police Assessment Resource Center (PARC), \nNovember 2003. (“17th Semiannual Report”) http://file.lacounty.gov/lac/mbobb17.pdf.  \n112.  Every weekday nearly 1,300 inmates pass through the Inmate Reception Center from \ncounty facilities on their way to 12 Superior Court Districts and 49 courthouses in LA County \n(about the size of a small European country). 17th Semiannual Report, 17:72.  \n \n  16 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 17 of 28\n113.  On any given day, the District sends between 100 to 150 2 court returns to two courthouses \n3, the Superior Court house and the District Court courthouse, located across the street from each \nother, 2.7 miles from the Superior Courthouse and the travel time is 10 minutes.  \n114.  The LA County Jail instituted a courthouse release program in May 2001, the “In-Court \nRelease and Greenband Program.”   \n115.  The following chart shows over detentions in the LA County Jail in the years 1997 to 2003: \nYear  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003 \n \nOver  607  495  269  249  123  81  49 \ndetentions \n \nOver-detention numbers for the DOC \n116.  Exact over-detention numbers for the DC Jail and CTF (Central Treatment Facility) and \nthe Half Way Houses are not known to plaintiff without discovery. \n117.  But, publically available figures and discussions with knowledgeable people such as CJA \nlawyers indicates that the DOC routinely holds detainees past their Release Times. \n118.  First of all, the DOC has historically under-reported over-detentions even in its annual \n                                                 \n2 DOC newsletter. \n3 The DC jail is located at1901 E Street, SE, Washington, DC 20003. The superior Courthouse is \nlocated at 555 Indiana Ave., N.W., Washington, DC 20001. According to Google's “get \ndirections,” the jail is 2.7 miles from the Superior Courthouse and the travel time is 10 min.  \nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&tab=wl (last checked 1/27/2011). \n \n  17 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 18 of 28\ncompliance reports to the Judiciary and Public Safety Committee of the D.C. Council which has \noversight for the DOC. \n119.  The DOC even under-reports over-detentions in litigation. See e.g., Smith v. District of \nColumbia, 15-151 (DAR) [56] 12/6/2016 (District sanctioned for failing to disclose all over-\ndetentions in response to non-objectionable discovery requests). \n120.  The DOC reported about 12 over-detentions for 2013 to the D.C. Council for 2013 but \nthis number is under-reported. \n121.  The number of over-detentions the DOC ultimately disclosed to Mr. Smith is under seal \nand not known to Mr. Jones. \n122.  In 2015 the DOC over-detained Mr. Smith for 23 days a length which indicates a severe \nproblem in the Records Office. \n123.  In 2016 the District over-detained Mr. Perrow for about 20 days again a length which \nindicates a severe problem in the Records Office.  \n124.  Most significantly and most indicative of a over-detention systemic problem is that a senior \nRecords Office manager failed to make an over-detention report when Mr. Smith’s over-detention \nwas discovered. \n125.  One of the key tools which the DOC and other jails use to prevent over-detentions is to \nreport and track over-detentions so management can identify and fix problems that cause over-\ndetentions (and the flip side of over-detentions, early releases). \n126.  When senior supervisory staff in a Records Office fail to make reports is indicates a \n \n  18 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 19 of 28\nsystemic problem. \nPlaintiff Richard Jones’ Overdetention by the DC Jail \n127.  Without discovery Mr. Jones does not yet know why he was over-detained and strip-\nsearched but the following facts are clear. \n128.  On or about 12/7/15 Plaintiff Richard Jones, while in the custody of the DOC was sent to \nthe federal courthouse for a hearing.  \n129.  Mr. Jones was ordered released but instead of being released from the courthouse or the \nMHU the DOC transported him to the DC Jail. \n130.  At R&D Mr. Jones told the R&D staff that he was entitled to release but the R&D staff did \nnot investigate his claim and hold him in the R&D holding area without a strip-search or send him \nto MHU during the investigation. \n131.   Because they found no release order they assumed per DOC policy that he was still \nsubject to detention on the case he went to court on so they subjected him to a strip-search and \nretuned him to his cell. \n132.  They did not release him for several hours. \n133.  Mr. Jones pleads in the alternative that he was held more than five hours before release \nafter being transferred by the Marshals in the courthouse to the DOC transport officers.  \n134.  Plaintiff Jones has suffered damages as a result of the over detention. \nPlaintiff Richard Jones’s Strip Search \n135.  On 12/7/15 Plaintiff Richard Jones was taken to Court and the Judge ordered his release. \n136.  Plaintiff Richard Jones was entitled to release on 12/7/15. \n137.  But, instead of being released or diverted to the holding facility at MHU or released from \nthe courthouse on 12/7/15, Plaintiff Richard Jones was returned to the DC Jail’s general \n \n  19 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 20 of 28\npopulation and per official DOC policy he was subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity \nsearch without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons even though a court had ordered his release. \n138.  Plaintiff Jones has suffered damages as a result. \n139.  A DOC Sargent described the strip-searches performed on arrestees like Mr. Smith and \nMr. Jones -- what the corrections officers call the “dance” -- as follows. \n140.  The intake stands on a piece of green carpet in front of a long table, takes all their clothes \noff, and puts their clothes on the table. \n141.  The guards rifle the hair, pull the ears back, and then open the mouth wide and lift the \ncorners with their hands so that the guard can see left or right in the mouth.   \n142.  Then the intake lifts their arms in the air so the guard can see the arm pits and the backs of \nthe arms.  \n143.  Next the male intake lifts his genitals so the guards can see underneath and in between the \nlegs.  \n144.  A similar procedure is used for female intakes. \n145.  “At that point, they'll turn around and bend over--and spread their buttocks with their \nhands. Once that's done then they lift up their back feet, one, two, [the “dance”] and it's over.” \n146.  In fact, cells were added at MHU as part of the settlement in Bynum v. District of \nColumbia, 02-956 (RCL) so that court returns entitled to release after their hearings at court could \nbe held there while the DC Jail Records Office was administratively processing their releases. \nSubstantive Allegations \nClaim 1 \nPattern and Practice § 1983 Liability of District of Columbia for Overdetentions \n \n  20 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 21 of 28\n147.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all allegations \nset forth in this Complaint. \n148.  The District of Columbia, and its agents and employees, have had a longstanding custom \nand practice of detaining people past their entitlement to release, thereby causing unjustified \noverdetention of the Overdetained Named Plaintiff and all other Over-detention class members. \n149.  Court returns entitled to release such as Mr. Jones were entitled to release within two hours \nof receiving their court ordered releases and all inmates were entitled to release by 10 pm on their \nRelease Dates.  \n150.  The District's actions, and failure to act, as described above, directly and proximately and \naffirmatively were the moving force behind the violations of the Overdetained Named Plaintiff and \nall other class members’ Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. \n151.  The District was deliberately indifferent to their rights. \n152.  Named Plaintiff Mr. Jones and all other class members’ suffered thereby general damages \nsuch as loss of liberty and special damages such as emotional distress. \n153.  Accordingly, Mr. Jones and all other class members are entitled to damages to be \ndetermined at trial. \nClaim 2 \nLiberty Interest § 1983 Liability of District of Columbia for Overdetentions \n154.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all allegations \nset forth in this Complaint. \n155.  Mr. Jones also brings the Over-detention Claim pursuant to the Due Process clause of the \nFifth Amendment because the District of Columbia statutes create a liberty interest in release by 10 \npm on the Release Date per D.C. Code § 24-201.06 and D.C. Code § 24-211.02a and for an \n \n  21 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 22 of 28\ninmate ordered released pursuant to a court order within 5 hours of transfer from the custody of \nthe United States Marshals Service into the custody of the Department of Corrections per D.C. \nCode § 24-211.02a. \n156.  Named Plaintiff Mr. Jones and all other class members’ suffered thereby general damages \nsuch as loss of liberty and special damages such as emotional distress. \n157.  The DOC routinely held persons entitled to release longer than these deadlines. \n158.  Holding persons past their statutorily created liberty interest deadlines violated their Fifth \nAmendment Rights and the District was the moving force behind the violations. \nClaim 3 \n§ 1983 Monell Liability of District for Illegal Strip Searches \n159.  Mr. Jones the Strip Search Named Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all \nallegations set forth in this Complaint. \n160.  The DOC has an official written policy of subjecting all inmates entering the DC Jail to tes \nwithout any finding of cause. \n161.  The DOC applies the policy to all such persons even to court returns entitled to release. \n162.  The DOC’s policy as applied to court returns entitled to release was the moving force \nbehind the violations of the Strip Search Named Plaintiff and the Strip Search Class members’ \nFourth and Fifth Amendment rights.  \n163.  Named Plaintiff Mr. Jones and all other class members’ suffered thereby general damages \nsuch as loss of liberty and special damages such as emotional distress.  \n164.  Accordingly, Mr. Jones and the class are entitled to damages to be determined at trial. \nClaim 4 \nCommon Law Liability of District of Columbia for False Arrest \n \n  22 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 23 of 28\n165.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all allegations \nset forth in this Complaint. \n166.  The District of Columbia, and its agents and employees, held Mr. Jones and the over-\ndetention class members past the time they were entitled to release. \n167.  District’s employees were acting within the scope of their employment at all times. \n168.  The District is liable for the conduct of its employees in respondeat superior. \n169.  The District's actions, and failure to act, as described above, were the proximate cause of \nthe Overdetained Named Plaintiff and all other class members’ common law rights to be free from \nfalse arrest and cause them general damages such as loss of liberty and special damages such as \nemotional distress. \n170.  Accordingly, Mr. Jones and all the other Over-detention class members are entitled to \ndamages to be determined at trial. \nClaim 5 \nCommon Law Liability of District for Illegal Strip Searches \n171.  Mr. Jones the Strip Search Named Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all \nallegations set forth in this Complaint. \n172.  The conduct of the DOC employees in enforcing the District’s policy of strip-searching all \npersons entering the DC Jail as applied to court returns entitled to release violated their common \nlaw right to privacy. \n173.  The District's actions, and failure to act, as described above, were the proximate cause of \nthe Strip Search Named Plaintiff and the Strip Search Class members’ common law privacy rights.  \n174.  The District’s employees were acting within the scope of their employment at all times.  \n175.  The District is liable for the conduct of its employees in respondeat superior. \n \n  23 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 24 of 28\n176.  Named Plaintiff and all other class members’ suffered thereby general damages such as loss \nof liberty and special damages such as emotional distress. \n177.   Accordingly, Mr. Jones and all the other Strip-search class members are entitled to \ndamages to be determined at trial. \nClass Action Allegations \n178.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiff bring this action under Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting of: (a) Each person who has been, \nis, or in the future will be incarcerated in any District of Columbia Department of Corrections \nfacility from August 1, 2013 forward; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future, will not be \nreleased by 10 pm on the date on which the person is entitled to be released by court order or the \ndate on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise expired (or within two hours of \nbeing ordered released or otherwise becoming entitled to release if the person was a court return). \n179.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiff also bring this action under Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class consisting of each member of the class who \nwas, or in the future will be, from August 1, 2013, forward: (i) in the custody of the Department of \nCorrections; (ii) taken to court from a Department of Corrections facility; (iii) ordered released by \nthe court or otherwise became entitled to release by virtue of the court appearance because the \ncharge on which he had been held was no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was \nordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was \nacquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was not the subject of any other pending case or \ncases which imposed any condition of release other than personal recognizance; (v) was not the \nsubject of any detainer or warrant; (vi) was returned from court to the DC Jail or CTF or other \nDistrict facility, to be processed out of Department of Corrections custody; and (vii) was subjected \n \n  24 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 25 of 28\nto a strip search and/or visual body cavity search without any individualized finding of reasonable \nsuspicion or probable cause that they were concealing contraband or weapons; before being \nreleased, regardless of whether they were over-detained. The Strip-search class does not include \nfor the same strip-search any person who meets the strip-search class definition in Lewis v. District \nof Columbia, 15-352 (RBW). \n180.  Certification of these two classes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate, because the District of Columbia has a pattern and practice that has uniformly \naffected all members of both classes, and injunctive relief against the District will benefit each and \nevery plaintiff and class member. Although the District had agreed to stop these practices, and \nindeed had done so in the context of the settlement of Bynum v. District of Columbia, Civil Action \nNo. 02-956 (RCL) and Barnes v. District of Columbia, 06-315 (RCL), the practices stop have not \nstopped based on public filings and discussions with attorneys practicing in the District courts. \n181.  The classes are entitled to injunctive relief on their § 1983 claims, for example, setting up \nan independent monitor to supervise the Department of Corrections' inmate management system \nto ensure that all inmates are released on or before their release dates, and other relief as specified \nbelow. \n182.  Regarding the Overdetained Named Plaintiff, and members of the class, there are no \nindividual questions on the issue of liability other than whether an individual has been \noverdetained, and the answer to that question can be determined by ministerial inspection of the \nDepartment of Corrections' records. \n183.  Computer records and DOC over-detention reports are available for inspection on the \noverdetentions and the strip-searches.  \n \n  25 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 26 of 28\n184.  Regarding the Strip Search Named Plaintiff, and members of the Strip Search Class, there \nare no individual questions on the issue of liability, because neither the DC Jail nor CTF keeps \nrecords of the searches and therefore neither the DC Jail nor CTF can show that any of the \nsearches were conducted based on an individual determination of reasonable suspicion. \n185.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the classes are: \na)   whether the Constitution provides a maximum length of time \nmeasured in hours beyond which the District cannot hold a person to perform \nadministrative tasks incident to release before releasing that person from custody \nafter the basis for detention is over;  \nb)  Whether DC statutes create liberty interests entitling inmates to \nrelease by 10 pm of their Release Dates or for an inmate ordered released pursuant \nto a court order within 5 hours of transfer from the custody of the United States \nMarshals Service into the custody of the Department of Corrections.  \nc)   whether the District has exceeded that maximum for each class \nmember; \nd)  whether the District has a pattern and practice of holding detainees \nand inmates past their release dates; \ne)  whether the District has a pattern and practice of being deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of detainees and inmates by holding them past their release \ndates; \nf)  whether the District’s acts as alleged herein violate the Constitution \nof the United States by holding detainees and inmates past their release dates; \n \n  26 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 12   Filed 04/05/17   Page 27 of 28\ng)  whether the District has a policy of and practice of subjecting \npersons to blanket strip searches and visual body cavity searches after they have \nbecome entitled to release; \nh)  whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fourth and/or \nFifth Amendments. \n186.  Each of the Overdetention Class and the Strip Search Class is so numerous that joinder of \nall members is impracticable.  The exact number of Overdetention Class and Strip Search Class \nmembers is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is likely to consist of at least one hundred \npeople, and likely substantially more than that. \n187.  The Overdetained Named Plaintiff’ claims are typical of the claims of the other members \nof the class, as plaintiffs and all other members of the class were injured by exactly the same \nmeans, that is, by the overdetentions. \n188.  The Strip Search Named Plaintiff’ claims are typical of the claims of the other members of \nthe Strip Search Class, as the Strip Search Named Plaintiff and all other members of the Strip \nSearch Class were injured by exactly the same means, that is, by the blanket strip searches. \n189.

No. 16-cv-2405 (DLF) \n \nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,  \n \n    Defendant. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER \n  Richard Jones brought this action against the District of Columbia alleging that he was \ndetained and strip searched in D.C. Jail after a federal judge ordered him released from custody.  \nThis Court previously granted in part the District’s Motion to Dismiss and, as relevant here, \ndismissed Jones’s Fourth Amendment and common law claims.  Mem. Op. at 9, Dkt. 26.  Before \nthe Court is Jones’s motion to reconsider and restore those claims.1  For the reasons that follow, \nthe Court will grant the motion. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nOn December 7, 2015, a federal judge sentenced Jones to time served and ordered that he \nbe released from the custody of the Department of Corrections (DOC).  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 128, 129, \n                                                 \n1 Jones’s initial motion was limited to the dismissal of his common law claims, but the motion \nincluded arguments that implicitly challenged the dismissal of his Fourth Amendment claims as \nwell.  See Jan. 10, 2019 Minute Order (citing Pl.’s Mot. Recons. at 8–9, Dkt. 27).  The Court \nordered supplemental briefing on those claims and held a hearing at which Jones made clear that \nhe seeks reconsideration of both his common law and Fourth Amendment claims.  See Apr. 3, \n2019 Hr’g Tr. at 1–2. \n \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 2 of 16\n135, Dkt. 12; see also United States v. Jones, No. 11-cr-79, Dkt. 39 at 3.2  Jones was then \ntransferred to D.C. Jail, where he told the receiving and discharge staff that he had been ordered \nreleased.  Am. Compl. ¶ 130.  Unconvinced, the staff strip searched him and returned him to a \ncell in the jail’s general population.  Id. ¶¶ 130–31.  Jones was then held for “several hours” \nbefore he was eventually released.  Id. ¶ 132. \nAccording to Jones, his experience was not unique.  DOC “routinely” and \n“systematically” holds detainees past their release times, id. ¶¶ 13, 117, because it relies on a \nsystem of paper release orders that are often misplaced or delayed in transit between the \ncourthouse and the jail, id. ¶ 41.  Further, while DOC’s official policy is to transport inmates \nwho have been ordered released to a nearby medical facility for processing, it frequently fails to \nfollow that policy and instead transfers these inmates back to the general population, where they \nare strip searched upon arrival.  See id. ¶¶ 35–38, 160–63. \nJones filed this civil action challenging his over-detention and strip search, Dkt. 1, and \nthe District moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim, Dkt. 17.  This Court previously granted \nthe District’s motion in part and, as relevant here, dismissed Jones’s (1) Fourth Amendment \nchallenge to his detention, (2) Fourth Amendment challenge to his strip search, (3) common law \nfalse imprisonment claim, and (4) common law intrusion upon seclusion claim.  Mem. Op. at 3–\n10. \n  Jones now asks the Court to reconsider and restore all four claims. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nRule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “allows a litigant to move for \nreconsideration or modification of a district court’s interlocutory order disposing of ‘fewer than \n                                                 \n2 The facts here are recited as alleged in the plaintiff’s amended complaint. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 3 of 16\nall the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties’ ‘at any time’ before the \ncourt’s entry of final judgment.”  Cobell v. Jewell, 802 F.3d 12, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting \nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)).  A district court may reconsider an interlocutory order “as justice \nrequires.”  Capitol Sprinkler Inspection, Inc. v. Guest Servs., 630 F.3d 217, 227 (D.C. Cir. 2011) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Applying this standard, courts will reconsider a prior opinion \nwhen they have “patently misunderstood a party, [when they have] made an error not of \nreasoning but of apprehension, or where a controlling or significant change in the law or facts \nhas occurred since the submission of the issue to the Court.”  Scahill v. District of Columbia, 286 \nF. Supp. 3d 12, 17–18 (D.D.C. 2017) (alterations adopted and internal quotation marks omitted).  \n“The burden is on the moving party to show that reconsideration is appropriate and that harm or \ninjustice would result if reconsideration were denied.”  United States ex rel. Westrick v. Second \nChance Body Armor, Inc., 893 F. Supp. 2d 258, 268 (D.D.C. 2012).  \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  The Fourth Amendment Over-Detention Claim \nThe Court previously dismissed Jones’s Fourth Amendment over-detention claim \nbecause he did not allege a “fresh seizure” after he was ordered released from custody.  Jones \nnow argues that the Court clearly erred in two respects. \nFirst, he contends that the Court overlooked that a seizure that is reasonable at the outset \ncan become unreasonable through the passage of time, making a fresh seizure unnecessary for \nFourth Amendment purposes.  Pl.’s Supp. Br. at 2–6, Dkt. 35.  In the alternative, he argues that \nhe did allege a fresh seizure, either when DOC took him back into custody after a court ordered \nhim released or when DOC placed him back in the jail’s general population.  Id. at 4–5.  The \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 4 of 16\nCourt disagrees with Jones’s first argument but agrees with his second and will restore his Fourth \nAmendment claim on that basis. \nJones is correct that, to survive Fourth Amendment scrutiny, a seizure must not only be \nreasonable in the first instance but must also remain reasonable over time and in light of new \nfacts and circumstances.  See Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796, 812 (1984) (“[A] seizure \nreasonable at its inception because based upon probable cause may become unreasonable as a \nresult of its duration or for other reasons.”).  Courts have held, for example, that a vehicle seized \nfor evidentiary purposes cannot continue to be held for months after it has been searched and \nemptied of all relevant evidence.  See Avila v. Dailey, 246 F. Supp. 3d 347, 355 (D.D.C. 2017).  \nSimilarly, property reasonably seized under the community caretaking exception cannot remain \nimpounded long after the “exigency that justified the seizure [has] vanished.”  Brewster v. Beck, \n859 F.3d 1194, 1196 (9th Cir. 2017). \nBut this line of cases does not assist Jones because the Supreme Court has recognized a \n“constitutional division of labor” between the Fourth Amendment and the Due Process Clause.  \nManuel v. City of Joliet, 137 S. Ct. 911, 920 n.8 (2017).  The former governs pretrial detentions, \nwhile the latter takes over as soon as the jury has returned a verdict (or the judge has accepted a \nguilty plea).  Id.  In the Court’s words, “once a trial [or guilty plea] has occurred, the Fourth \nAmendment drops out,” and the plaintiff must challenge “any ensuing incarceration . . . under \nthe Due Process Clause.”  Id.  Jones’s guilty plea therefore serves as an intervening event that \nprevents him from challenging his continued post-conviction confinement under the Fourth \nAmendment. \nDeciding this much, however, only leads to Jones’s second argument: that the Court \nincorrectly assumed that he had not alleged a second seizure, when he had.  On this point, the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 5 of 16\nCourt agrees with Jones and confesses error.  Any confinement that Jones experienced as \npunishment for his underlying conviction ended the moment he was sentenced to time served and \nordered released.  And DOC’s subsequent decision to take him back into custody (either in the \ncourtroom or upon his return to D.C. Jail) constituted an actual or constructive re-seizure of his \nperson that required an independent justification.  See, e.g., Shultz v. Dart, No. 13 C 3641, 2013 \nWL 5873325, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 31, 2013) (collecting cases holding that a plaintiff who has \nbeen “sentenced to time served and told by the judge that he [i]s free to leave” becomes “a free \nperson protected by the Fourth Amendment”). \nAlthough the Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit have yet to resolve whether a brief period \nof confinement following a sentence of time served (or acquittal) qualifies as a distinct Fourth \nAmendment “seizure,” that conclusion follows from the distinction the Supreme Court has \nelsewhere drawn between punitive and regulatory confinement.  See United States v. Salerno, \n481 U.S. 739, 746–48 (1987).  In assessing which constitutional standards apply to a given \nconfinement, courts look to its nature and purpose.  Id.  If the confinement serves penological \ninterests, courts require a criminal conviction—with all the procedural and evidentiary \nsafeguards that entails.  But if the confinement serves purely regulatory interests, such as \ncommunity safety, courts balance those interests against the individual’s weighty liberty interest \nwithout regard for the specific protections that accompany a criminal trial.  See id. at 748–51. \nThis conceptual distinction between punitive and regulatory confinement sheds light on \nwhat happened to Jones in this case.  A judge sentenced him to “time served” (past tense) and, in \ndoing so, declared an end to any punitive confinement.  But, moments later, a new period of \nregulatory confinement began.  The District does not attempt to characterize this confinement as \nan extension of Jones’s sentence, which had unquestionably run.  Nor does it point to any \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 6 of 16\npunitive reason—such as retribution, incapacitation, or deterrence—for Jones’s continued \nconfinement.  Instead, it points to purely “administrative,” or regulatory, reasons: namely, the \nneed to check for other detention orders and outstanding warrants.  See Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss \nBr. at 9, Dkt. 17-1.  The different character and purpose of this second period of detention \ndemonstrates that it cannot be viewed as a mere extension of the same detention that began \nmonths before with Jones’s initial arrest.  Because it took on an entirely different character, it \nwas (or became) a distinct “seizure” that must be justified on its own terms.3 \nThat is not to say that the District necessarily lacks such a justification.  As Jones \nacknowledges, defendants who are released in one matter will often be subject to detention on \nother court matters, or subject to arrest on outstanding warrants.  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 25, 62–64.  This \nfar-from-remote possibility distinguishes former inmates from the general public and may well \njustify at least some brief period of additional custody for administrative processing.  See Brass \nv. Cty. of Los Angeles, 328 F.3d 1192, 1202 (9th Cir. 2003) (“‘[T]he Fourth Amendment \n. . . permit[s] a reasonable postponement’ of a prisoner’s release ‘while the County copes with \nthe everyday problem of processing’ the release of the large number of prisoners who pass \nthrough its incarceration system” (quoting Cty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 55 \n(1991)); Lewis v. O’Grady, 853 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1988) (similar).  At this stage, \nhowever, the Court is in no position to evaluate the reasons the District might offer for holding \nJones for processing.  Nor can the Court decide, as a matter of law, where (or for how long) the \n                                                 \n3 This conclusion honors the “constitutional division of labor” between the Fourth Amendment \nand due process discussed above.  Manuel, 137 S. Ct. at 920 n.8.  The Due Process Clauses \nprovide the exclusive standard for detention imposed as punishment for a criminal conviction \nbecause those Clauses, rather than the Fourth Amendment, govern the procedures and standards \nfor obtaining such a conviction.  But when detention is justified without regard for any criminal \nconviction, then the general prohibition on unreasonable seizures retains its force.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 7 of 16\nDistrict may have held Jones for processing without violating his Fourth Amendment rights.  See \nLewis, 853 F.2d at 1370 (“Reasonable time must be allowed for such matters as transportation, \nidentity verification, and processing,” and “[w]hat is a reasonable time for detaining a prisoner in \ncustody is a question best left open for juries to answer based on the facts presented in each \ncase.”); Arline v. City of Jacksonville, 359 F. Supp. 2d 1300, 1310 (M.D. Fla. 2005) (jury \nquestion whether a two-and-a-half hour detention following the plaintiff’s acquittal on all \ncharges violated the Fourth Amendment); Shultz, 2013 WL 5873325, at *5 (denying motion to \ndismiss where the reasons for and circumstances surrounding alleged over-detentions remained \nunclear and subject to dispute). \nIn short, the Court holds that Jones’s guilty plea forecloses any Fourth Amendment \nchallenge to his continued confinement.  However, Jones has adequately alleged that he was \nseized for a second time by DOC after he was ordered released.  Because this Court’s prior \ndecision to the contrary was premised on a misapprehension of Jones’s legal theory, it will \nrestore his Fourth Amendment over-detention claim.4 \nB.  Fourth Amendment Strip Search \nThe Court will also restore Jones’s Fourth Amendment challenge to his strip search in \nD.C. Jail.  In assessing that claim, the Court took the District’s decision to return him to D.C. \nJail’s general population as a given and evaluated his strip search in the context of his re-entry \n                                                 \n4 The parties have not briefed whether the standards for liability will differ under the Fourth \nAmendment and the Due Process Clause.  The Court does not resolve that question today but \nnotes the possibility that Jones’s two constitutional claims for over-detention may ultimately \nmerge as a practical matter.  Cf. Villanova v. Abrams, 972 F.2d 792, 797 (7th Cir. 1992) (noting \nthat “the distinction between . . . search and seizure, and due process” would “[p]robably not” \n“make any practical difference” in a related context because both provisions require the court to \ncompare “the benefits of confinement to the government” with “the costs to the person \nconfined”). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 8 of 16\ninto the general population.  But, in doing so, the Court overlooked Jones’s argument that the \ndecision to place Jones into the general population was itself an error that lacked any reasonable \njustification. \nAs the court in Barnes explained, the security and contraband concerns that justify strip-\nsearching all “persons who are legitimately introduced into the general jail population” do not \nnecessarily extend to prisoners like Jones who are “entitled to release.”  793 F. Supp. 2d at 289  \n(emphasis added).  That is because the latter class of prisoners “are subjected to strip searches \nsolely due to the fact that the DOC has made the unfortunate choice to bring them back into the \ngeneral inmate population . . ., rather than temporarily housing them apart from that population.”  \nId.  At least in the District of Columbia, “[t]hat choice” ignores other, existing “alternatives” for \ntemporarily housing court returns and “creates the security problem that the . . . strip searches are \ndesigned to solve.”  Id. \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Florence does not require a different conclusion.  To be \nsure, the Court held that prisoners who are properly introduced to a jail’s general population may \nbe subjected to a blanket strip-search policy upon entry.  See Florence v. Bd. of Chosen \nFreeholders of Cty. of Burlington, 566 U.S. 318, 328, 338 (2012).  But the Florence Court \nexpressly reserved whether those same search procedures could be constitutionally applied to \narrestees “who can be held in available facilities removed from the general population.”  Id. at \n339 (plurality opinion); see also id. at 340 (Roberts, C.J., concurring) (emphasizing that the \nCourt’s holding is limited to circumstances in which there is “no alternative” to “holding [the \nplaintiff] in the general jail population”); id. at 341–42 (Alito, J., concurring) (emphasizing that \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 9 of 16\n“admission to the general jail population, with the concomitant humiliation of a strip search, may \nnot be reasonable, particularly if an alternative procedure is feasible”). \nIn this case, Jones has alleged that the District had in place a readily available alternative \nto holding him in the general jail population.  In fact, DOC’s own stated policy is to “divert[] in-\ncustody defendants ordered released” to “a holding facility on the grounds of DC General \nHospital” where they can be processed without being subjected to a strip search.  Am. Compl. \n¶ 35.  Without discovery, Jones cannot know for sure why he was sent back to the general \npopulation instead of the hospital, but he alleges upon information and belief that his strip search \nwas one of many caused by “recurring problems” with D.C. Jail’s computer system, and by \nDOC’s decision to maintain a system of paper records that often get misplaced during transport \nto and from court hearings.  Id. ¶ 38; see also generally ¶¶ 39–104 (describing in detail the \nproblems with DOC’s system for handling court returns).  Under these circumstances, “the \nDOC’s invasion of [Jones’s] personal rights is balanced against nothing, because the DOC’s \nblanket strip searches of court returns entitled to release are needless” and inflicted on “persons \nwho are no longer prisoners in the eyes of the law.”  Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 290. \nOne additional wrinkle remains.  The Court previously treated Jones’s re-entry and strip \nsearch as an aberration that did not reflect a practice or policy of the District and therefore could \nnot establish municipal liability.  But although DOC’s official policy may be to divert court \nreturns entitled to release to the hospital for processing, the complaint alleges that DOC’s other \nofficial policies and practices have prevented it from doing so in a consistent fashion.  At this \nstage, assuming the truth of Jones’s allegations and drawing all reasonable inferences from those \nallegations in his favor, the Court cannot conclude that the District’s stated policy reflected its \nactual policy and practice.  Accordingly, Jones has stated a Fourth Amendment claim for an \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 10 of 16\nunreasonable strip search and has adequately alleged a basis for municipal liability against the \nDistrict.  The Court finds that justice requires Jones’s Fourth Amendment claim to be restored.5 \nC.  False Imprisonment \nJones next argues that the Court misapprehended his first common law claim by \nanalyzing it as a claim for false arrest, as opposed to a failure to release.  He also points to a \ndecision issued after the parties had fully briefed the motion to dismiss in which another Judge in \nthis District granted summary judgment for the plaintiff on a similar false imprisonment claim.  \nSee Smith v. District of Columbia, 306 F. Supp. 3d 223, 260–61 (D.D.C. 2018).  The Court \nagrees that Smith sheds light on the issues raised here and that justice requires the Court to \nreconsider its prior order. \nThe Court begins by clarifying the distinction between a common law false arrest claim \nand a common law false imprisonment claim.  Although the two are often practically \n“indistinguishable,” Enders v. District of Columbia, 4 A.3d 457, 461 (D.C. 2010), they differ in \nscope.  False imprisonment is an umbrella category that includes false arrest.  See 32 Am. Jur. 2d \nFalse Imprisonment § 3 (2019) (footnote omitted).  Specifically, “[f]alse arrest is a term that \ndescribes the setting for false imprisonment when it is committed by an officer or by one who \nclaims the power to make an arrest.”  Dan B. Dobbs, Paul T. Hayden & Ellen M. Bublick, The \nLaw of Torts § 41 (2d ed. 2019).  It follows that false arrest is not the only way to commit false \nimprisonment.  Indeed, the Second Restatement of Torts provides a list of the many ways that a \n                                                 \n5 Jones also challenged his strip search under the doctrine of substantive due process.  The Court \npreviously dismissed that claim because the Fourth Amendment “provides an explicit textual \nsource of constitutional protection” against the kind of search Jones challenges, making “the \ngeneralized notion of substantive due process” inapplicable.  Mem. Op. at 8 (quoting Albright v. \nOliver, 510 U.S. 266 (1994)).  Jones does not appear to seek reconsideration of that decision, but \nto the extent he does, his request is denied. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 11 of 16\ndefendant can commit false imprisonment, see, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 38–41 \n(1965), and the D.C. Court of Appeals has looked to that list to evaluate questions of unlawful \nconfinement, see Faniel v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 404 A.2d 147, 151 n.11 (D.C. \n1979). \nOne way to commit false imprisonment is through a “refusal to release.”  Restatement \n(Second) of Torts § 45 (capitalization omitted).  “If the actor is under a duty to release the other \nfrom confinement . . . his refusal to do so with the intention of confining the other is a sufficient \nact of confinement to make him subject to liability” for false imprisonment.  Id.  The Second \nRestatement provides the following illustration: “A is confined in jail under a sentence for a \nterm.  At the end of the term B, the jailor, is under a legal duty to release A, but refuses to do so.  \nB is subject to liability to A.”  Id. cmt. a, illus. 1. \nThat the labels “false arrest” and “false imprisonment” can be used to refer to the same \nact of confinement explains the frequent, but imprecise, observation that “[t]here is no real \ndifference as a practical matter between false arrest and false imprisonment.”  Barnhardt v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 723 F. Supp. 2d at 197, 214 (D.D.C. 2010) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  That observation holds true where the claim concerns only the illegality of the \nplaintiff’s initial confinement.  See, e.g., Enders, 4 A.3d at 466; Maldonado v. District of \nColumbia, 924 F. Supp. 2d 323, 330 n.6 (D.D.C. 2013).  But it does not apply where, as here, the \ndefendant refuses to release the plaintiff from confinement that began lawfully but has become \nunlawful over time.  See Dent v. May Dep’t Stores Co., 459 A.2d 1042, 1044 (D.C. 1982) (“[A] \ndetention which is unreasonable in length or manner could constitute a false imprisonment \ndespite the legality of the initial confinement.”); cf. Abourezk v. New York Airline, Inc., 705 F. \nSupp. 656, 664 (D.D.C. 1989) (the refusal to release a plaintiff from confinement upon request \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 12 of 16\ncan establish false imprisonment even if the plaintiff consented to the initial confinement), aff’d, \n895 F.2d 1456 (D.C. Cir. 1990). \nThe distinction between false arrest and false imprisonment leads to a related distinction \nbetween a Fourth Amendment false arrest claim and a common law false imprisonment claim.  \nIn its previous opinion, the Court concluded that Jones’s common law claim was coextensive \nwith his Fourth Amendment claim, and it dismissed both claims because Jones failed to allege a \n“fresh seizure.”  See Mem. Op. at 9.  In reaching that conclusion, however, the Court overlooked \nthat the cases equating Fourth Amendment and false imprisonment claims invariably involve the \nfalse arrest species of false imprisonment—not a failure to release.  See, e.g., Maldonado, 924 F. \nSupp. 2d at 330 n.6 (false imprisonment claim premised on police officers’ warrantless arrest); \nBarnhardt, 723 F. Supp. 2d at 215 (same).  By contrast, where false imprisonment arises from \nover-detention, courts do not apply Fourth Amendment principles or require a new seizure or \narrest.  See Smith, 306 F. Supp. 3d at 260–61 (concluding that holding a prisoner in D.C. Jail \nbeyond his court-ordered release time constituted false imprisonment without analyzing whether \na fresh seizure occurred); Whirl v. Kern, 407 F.2d 781, 791 (5th Cir. 1968) (collecting cases and \nobserving that “the breadth of a peace officer’s privilege in an arrest situation is not necessarily \nthe test of the breadth of a jailer’s privilege in the context of a false imprisonment” and \nconcluding that “the jailer is liable for false imprisonment” if “a prisoner is held in jail without a \ncourt order”). \nWithout an additional “seizure” requirement imported from the Fourth Amendment, \nJones’s claim requires only: “(1) the detention or restraint of one against his will, within \nboundaries fixed by the defendant, and (2) the unlawfulness of the restraint.”  Faniel, 404 A.2d \nat 150.  “Confinement, no matter how brief, suffices to establish a prima facie case of false \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 13 of 16\narrest,” Marshall v. District of Columbia, 391 A.2d 1374, 1381 (D.C. 1978), and a “showing of \ndetention without process raises a presumption of unlawful restraint and shifts to defendant the \nburden of justifying the restraint as lawful,” id. at 1380 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nUnder this standard, Jones has stated a false imprisonment claim.  Jones alleges that he \nwas restrained when he was taken to D.C. jail after a judge ordered his release.  Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 128–29.  He further alleges that this detention violated DOC policy and a settlement \nagreement that required the District to either make releases from courthouses or to take prisoners \nordered released to a holding facility at D.C. General Hospital while they await processing.  Id. \n¶¶ 67–74, 129.  The District did not raise any affirmative defenses in its Motion to Dismiss, and \nJones was not required to plead the absence of potential affirmative defenses.  See Flying Food \nGrp., Inc. v. NLRB, 471 F.3d 178, 183 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \nThis conclusion follows directly from Smith, which was decided after the completion of \nbriefing on the defendant’s motion to dismiss and which the Court considers persuasive.  The \nDistrict does not dispute that Smith was correctly decided.  See Def.’s Opp’n at 5–6.  Instead, it \ntries to distinguish Smith.  Id.  Its efforts are unpersuasive. \nFirst, the District argues that Smith involved a false imprisonment claim, whereas the \ncomplaint here alleges only a false arrest claim.  Id. at 5.  To support that interpretation of \nJones’s complaint, the District relies on the fact that Jones labeled his claim “False Arrest” in the \nheading of count 4.  See Def.’s Opp’n at 4 (citing Am. Compl. at 22).  Elsewhere, however, the \ncomplaint describes the same count as a “common law over-detention (false imprisonment) \n. . . claim[].”  Id. ¶ 5.  And, regardless, federal pleading rules “do not countenance dismissal of a \ncomplaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.”  Johnson v. \nCity of Shelby, 135 S. Ct. 346, 346 (2014) (per curiam).  The allegations in the complaint—\n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 14 of 16\nincluding those specific to count 4—clearly advance a false imprisonment claim premised on \nover-detention, see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 26, 130–32, 166, and no more is required. \nThe District next argues that Smith is distinguishable because it involved a longer period \nof detention—twenty-three days compared to a few hours here.  Def.’s Opp’n at 5.  But the \nlength of detention, while potentially relevant to damages and affirmative defenses, has no \nbearing on Jones’s prima facie case.  See Marshall, 391 A.2d at 1381 (“Confinement, no matter \nhow brief, suffices to establish a prima facie case of false arrest.”). \nLastly, the District argues that, unlike the detention in Smith, Jones’s detention was \nlawful because he was “sent directly back to D.C. Jail while his arrest was processed.”  Id. at 6.  \nThis argument simply ignores Jones’s allegations—which this Court must take as true at the \nmotion-to-dismiss stage—that his over-detention violated a federal court order, DOC policy, an \nexisting settlement agreement, and the D.C. Code.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2–3, 26–29, 37, 72, 129, \n166.  At a minimum, Jones has alleged continued confinement without process, and the burden \nnow shifts to the District to justify that confinement as lawful.  See Marshall, 391 A.2d at 1380.   \nGiven the Court’s error in analyzing Jones’s claim exclusively under Fourth Amendment \nprinciples of false arrest, as well as the existence of new and persuasive authority, the Court \nconcludes that justice requires the restoration of Jones’s common-law false imprisonment claim.6 \nD.  Intrusion upon Seclusion \nFinally, Jones argues that the Court clearly erred in dismissing his common law privacy \nclaim.  Pl.’s Mot. Recons. at 9.  The Court agrees. \n                                                 \n6 The Court has also now held that Jones did allege a fresh seizure under the Fourth Amendment.  \nThat holding provides another, independent basis for restoring Jones’s common law false \nimprisonment claim, though it is not necessary to the Court’s decision. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 15 of 16\n“The tort of intrusion upon seclusion has three elements: (1) an invasion or interference \nby physical intrusion, by use of a defendant’s sense of sight or hearing, or by use of some other \nform of investigation or examination; (2) into a place where the plaintiff has secluded himself; or \ninto his private or secret concerns; (3) that would be highly offensive to an ordinary, reasonable \nperson.”  Helton v. United States, 191 F. Supp. 2d 179, 181 (D.D.C. 2002) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  The Court previously concluded that Jones failed to establish the third element \nbecause a strip search would not be viewed as unreasonable in the context of Jones’s re-entry \ninto the general population.  Mem. Op. at 10.  In reaching that conclusion, however, the Court \nassumed that Jones’s strip search was constitutional under the Fourth Amendment—a position it \nhas now disavowed.  In addition, the Court underestimated the extent to which the District of \nColumbia might provide common law privacy protections that go beyond the minimum \nrequirements of the Constitution.  See Helton, 191 F. Supp. 2d at 183 (holding that plaintiffs \nstated a claim for intrusion upon seclusion based on strip searches conducted by the U.S. \nMarshals Service and rejecting the District’s contention “that District of Columbia law limits the \navailability of invasion of privacy to the bounds recognized by the United States Constitution”).  \nFor these reasons, justice requires that the Court restore Jones’s common law privacy claim. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants the plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration.  \nCounts 1 and 3 are restored to the extent they assert claims under the Fourth Amendment, and \ncounts 4 and 5 are restored in full. \n   \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 39   Filed 06/13/19   Page 16 of 16\n \n \n________________________ \n                DABNEY L.

Tilghman on behalf of\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Substituting for attorney\nAmanda J. Montee (Tilghman, Michael) (Entered: 12/20/2018)\n01/10/2019 MINUTE ORDER. The Court has reviewed the plaintiff's 27 Motion for\nReconsideration of the Court's August 22, 2018 memorandum opinion and order. The\nplaintiff limits his request for reconsideration to the Court's dismissal of his\ncommon−law claims. However, certain of the plaintiff's arguments, if accepted, would\nappear to impact the Court's holdings with respect to the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment\nclaims. See Pl.s' Mot. for Recons. at 8 (arguing that \"not every violation of a 4th\nAmendment requires a seizure or an 'arrest'\"); id. at 9 (arguing that the plaintiff's return\nto the general population of D.C. jail was caused by his false imprisonment and that\n\"[e]ven in the 4th Amendment context, neither Florence nor Bell ever suggested that\narrestees and other prisoners lose their expectations of privacy in their bodies just\nbecause they are in jail\"). The Court will therefore direct the parties to appear for a\nhearing at which they should be prepared to address both the merits of the plaintiffs'\nmotion for reconsideration and its relationship, if any, to the Fourth Amendment\nclaims previously dismissed. It is ORDERED that the parties shall file a joint status\nreport on or before January 15, 2019 proposing at least three possible dates for such a\nhearing and indicating whether either party seeks permission to file supplemental\nbriefing in advance of the hearing.

The Court expresses no view\non the plaintiff's intention to file a second motion for reconsideration or on the timing\nor merits of such a motion. Should the plaintiff file such a motion, the defendant may,\nif it wishes, consolidate its response to such motion with its response to the plaintiff's\nsupplemental brief. Signed by Judge Dabney L.

Plaintiff fails to allege a violation of a constitutional right as a result of his alleged \noverdetention.  \n3.

But plaintiff was \nreleased on the same day the court ordered his release: there was no overdetention. Plaintiff’s \nclaims should be dismissed. \nFACTS1 \n  Plaintiff Richard Jones, a DOC inmate at the D.C. Jail, attended a hearing at the federal \ncourthouse on December 7, 2015, during which DOC was ordered to release him. Compl. at ¶ \n43. Following the hearing, plaintiff was transported from the courthouse to D.C. Jail to await the \ncompletion of his release processing by DOC. Id. at ¶¶ 41, 45. Within “several hours” of his \nreturn to D.C. Jail plaintiff was released. Id. at ¶ 41. \n  The Complaint also alleges that “Carl A. Barnes was returned to the DC Jail’s general \npopulation and subject to a strip search and visual body cavity search.” Id. at ¶ 45. There is no \nplaintiff named Carl A. Barnes in this case. The District assumes the inclusion of this allegation \nwas erroneous. \nPlaintiff filed this lawsuit against the District alleging that he was unconstitutionally \noverdetained and strip searched and that he suffered a false arrest and invasion of privacy in \nviolation of District of Columbia common law. Id. at ¶¶ 47-68. \n \n \n                                                 \n1   The District does not dispute the allegations of the Complaint solely for purposes of this \nmotion. However, the District reserves the right to dispute the allegations for all other purposes.  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 6 of 17\nARGUMENT \nI.  Standard of Review  \n“A  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  tests  the  legal  sufficiency  of  a  complaint[.]”  Browning  v. \nClinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002). To survive, a complaint “must contain sufficient \nfactual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007)). The Court should not accept facts unsupported by allegations in the complaint or the \nplaintiff’s legal  conclusions.  Id. “Threadbare recitals  of the  elements  of a  cause of  action, \nsupported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id.  \nII.  Plaintiff’s Monell Claim Alleging Overdetention Should Be Dismissed.  \n \nA.  Plaintiff Was Not Overdetained. \n \nPlaintiff failed to plead facts to support a claim of overdetention. In the Complaint, \nplaintiff defines overdetention as “holding a detainee or prisoner in Department of Corrections’ \ncustody past the person’s release date.” Compl. at ¶ 28. The “release date” is “the day on which \nthe person is entitled to be released by court order or the date on which the basis for his or her \ndetention has otherwise expired.” Id. at ¶ 29.  \nAccording to plaintiff, on December 7, 2015, while in the custody of DOC, he was sent to \nthe federal courthouse for a hearing. Id. at ¶ 40. The court ordered him to be released. Id. at ¶ 41. \n“Several hours” later he was released. Id. Because plaintiff was released on his release date, he \nhas not alleged he was overdetained—even under his own definition of overdetention. \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 7 of 17\nB.  Plaintiff’s Detention for “Hours” While His Release Paperwork Was Processed \nWas Not Unconstitutional. \n \nPlaintiff’s hours-long release processing was not a violation of his constitutional rights. \nIn his Complaint, plaintiff alleges this delay violated his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and \nEighth Amendments. Not so. \n1.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim Sufficient to Establish a Fourth Amendment \nViolation. \n \nThe “several hours” it took for DOC to process plaintiff’s release does not meet the \nstandard for overdentention. But, even if it did, this Court has held that an overdetention does not \nconstitute a Fourth Amendment violation. See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 793 F. Supp. 2d \n260, 273-74 (2011). The Fourth Amendment protects the “right of people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” U.S. Const. \nAmend. IV. As the Court pointed out in Barnes, the plaintiff must show his overdetention \nconstituted a seizure of his person to establish a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Barnes, 793 \nF. Supp. 2d at 274. Like the plaintiffs in Barnes, plaintiff was already in the custody of DOC \nwhen he was ordered released. Id. As a result, his freedom of movement had already been \nterminated.  Id.  The  alleged  overdetention  did  not  constitute  a  seizure  under  the  Fourth \nAmendment. Id. \n2.  Plaintiff  Fails  to  State  a  Claim  Sufficient  to  Establish  a  Fifth  Amendment \nProcedural or Substantive Due Process Violation. \n \nPlaintiff  has  not  adequately  pled  a  procedural  due  process  claim  under  the  Fifth \nAmendment.  To  be  sure,  DOC  kept  plaintiff  in  its  custody  during  the  time  it  took  to \nadministratively process his release. But, “[t]emporarily retaining custody over an inmate who is \nentitled to release in order to accomplish an administrative task incident to that release is not per \nse unconstitutional.” Id. at 275. Several courts, including this Court, have recognized the need \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 8 of 17\nfor administrative processing following a release order, prior to actually releasing an inmate. See \nid. at 275-76; Lewis v. O’Grady, 853 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1988) (“We recognize that the \nadministrative task incident to a release of a prisoner may require some time to accomplish—in \nthis case perhaps a number of hours.”); Berry v. Baca, 379 F.3d 764 (9th Cir. 2004).  \nPlaintiff also has not adequately pled a substantive due process violation. “[T]he doctrine \nof  substantive  due  process  constrains  only  egregious  government  misconduct”  and  “grave \nunfairness.” George Washington Univ. v. District of Columbia, 318 F.3d 203, 209 (D.C. Cir. \n2003) (citing Silverman v. Barry, 845 F.2d 1072, 1080 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (doctrine prevents only \n“grave unfairness”)). In Silverman, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit \nidentified two ways a plaintiff might show such unfairness:  “a substantial infringement of state \nlaw prompted by personal or group animus, or a deliberate flouting of the law that trammels \nsignificant personal or property rights….” Silverman, 845 F.2d at 1080.  \nPlaintiff does not allege that DOC officials acted with animus. As a result, to prevail on a \nsubstantive  due  process  claim,  plaintiff  “must  show  that  the  state  actor  was  deliberately \nindifferent to his constitutional rights and that such conduct shocks the conscious.” Cohen v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 744 F. Supp. 2d 236, 243 (D.D.C. 2010); see also Cty. of Sacramento v. \nLewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 n.8 (1998) (“[T]he threshold question is whether the behavior…[was] so \negregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”).  \nPlaintiff cannot meet the standard set forth in Cohen, because there are no facts alleged in \nthe Complaint  sufficient  to  infer  that the  “detention”—which lasted  several  hours—was  so \negregious that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience. Cf. Berry, 379 F.3d at \n773 (a county knew its policy of delaying processing of releases until all information relating to \nprisoners scheduled for release had been entered into a computer system resulted in delays of up to \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 9 of 17\n48 hours). Plaintiff has not adequately alleged a Fifth Amendment due process violation, his \nComplaint should be dismissed. \n3.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim Sufficient to Establish an Eighth Amendment \nViolation. \n \nPlaintiff also fails to state a claim for an Eighth Amendment violation. Plaintiff “must \nidentify a deprivation that is ‘objectively, sufficiently serious’ in that it ‘result[s] in the denial of \nthe minimum civilized measure of life’s necessities.” Banks v. York, 515 F. Supp. 2d 89, 105 \n(D.D.C. 2007). Plaintiff does not allege he suffered any mistreatment during the time he was \nheld  to  complete  his  release  processing.  To  be  sure,  plaintiff  was  returned  to  the  general \npopulation at D.C. Jail, where he had been detained prior to attending court. Compl. at ¶ 45. But \nthe District’s decision to return him to the general population until his release paperwork was \nprocessed does not violate the protections found in the Eighth Amendment. “After incarceration, \nonly the ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain’… constitutes cruel and unusual punishment \nforbidden by the Eighth Amendment.” Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 664 (1977) (quoting \nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976)). The normal conditions of confinement that are “part \nof the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses” do not constitute cruel and unusual \npunishment under the Eighth Amendment. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981). \nC.  Plaintiff Fails to Allege That The District Has a Custom, Policy, or Practice of \nOverdetaining Inmates. \n \nAs explained above, plaintiff fails to state a constitutional violation related to his alleged \noverdetention. He also fails to state a basis for municipal liability. To state a claim against the \nDistrict  of  Columbia  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983,  plaintiff  must  allege  both  an  underlying \nconstitutional violation and a basis for municipal liability. Brown v. District of Columbia, 514 \nF.3d 1279, 1283 (D.C. Cir. 2008). First, a complaint must allege facts sufficient to support a \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 10 of 17\nreasonable inference that a person acting under color of District law subjected the plaintiff or \ncaused the plaintiff to be subjected to the deprivation of a constitutional right. Jones v. Delaney, \n610 F. Supp. 2d 46, 49 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 829 \n(1985)). Then, “[t]o impose liability on the District under … § 1983, [a plaintiff] must show ‘not \nonly a violation of his rights under the Constitution or federal law, but also that the District’s \ncustom or policy caused the violation.’” Feirson v. District of Columbia, 506 F.3d 1063, 1066 \n(D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Warren v. District of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  \nThe pleading requirement for a § 1983 claim is only met where the complaint “include[s] \nsome factual basis for the allegation of a municipal policy or custom,” sufficient to pass muster \n“under the standard set by the Supreme Court in Twombly and Iqbal.” Smith v. District of \nColumbia, 674 F. Supp. 2d 209, 213 n.2 (D.D.C. 2009). There are four basic categories of \nmunicipal action which, if proven, may subject a municipality to liability:  “(1) an expressed \nmunicipal  policy;  (2)  adoption  by  municipal  policymakers;  (3)  custom  or  usage;  and  (4) \ndeliberate indifference. Hunter v. District of Columbia, 824 F. Supp. 2d 125, 133 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(citing Monell v. New York City Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690-94 (1978)). \nPlaintiff alleges the District was deliberately indifferent, Compl. at ¶ 50, but provides no \nfactual support for the allegation. Deliberate indifference means that, “faced with actual or \nconstructive knowledge that its agents will probably violate constitutional rights, the city may \nnot adopt a policy of inaction.” Warren v. District of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C. Cir. \n2004). Plaintiff must show that the District knew or should have known his constitutional rights \nwould likely be violated. Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 283. He has not. The Complaint does not \nprovide any factual allegations which, if true, could prove the District had actual or constructive \nknowledge that plaintiff’s constitutional rights would be violated if he was returned to the jail \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 11 of 17\nwhile DOC processed his release. Plaintiff’s only claim is conclusory, stating, “[t]he District was \ndeliberately indifferent to [plaintiff’s] rights.” Compl. at ¶ 50. The Court should not accept \nplaintiff’s unsupported legal conclusions. Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678. \nPlaintiff alleges, without specific factual allegations, that the District has a policy or \npractice of overdetaining inmates. Compl. at ¶ 48. And, at the same time the plaintiff alleges that \nthe District instituted reforms that “ameliorated” and “eliminated” its “overdetention problem.” \nId. at ¶ 32. Plaintiff then contends, based “on information and belief, and based on publically \navailable filing[s]” the District “has again begun overdetaining large numbers of inmates.” Id. at \n¶ 33. But, as explained above, plaintiff was not overdetained; he was returned to D.C. Jail while \nhis release was processed by DOC, and he was released the same day he was ordered to be \nreleased—within several hours. Compare Compl. at ¶ 8 (proposing a class of “overdetained” \ninmates who were not released “by midnight on the date on which the person [was] entitled to be \nreleased  by  court  order”)  with  Compl.  at  ¶  41  (alleging  plaintiff  was  ordered  released  on \nDecember 7, 2015 and then was, in fact, released several hours later). If plaintiff does have \nsupport for his legal conclusion that the District has a practice of overdetaining inmates—\nwhether that support is from information in public filings or otherwise—he must plead those \nallegations to support his claim. “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, \nsupported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice” to satisfy a plaintiff’s obligation under \nRule 8. Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678. The Complaint fails to adequately plead a basis for municipal \nliability.  \n \n \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 12 of 17\nIII.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for a Search in Violation of His Fourth and Fifth \nAmendment Rights.  \n \nA.  Plaintiff Fails to Allege He Was Searched. \n \nPlaintiff’s claim alleging the District is conducting strip searches in violation of the \nFourth and Fifth Amendments should be dismissed because the Complaint fails to allege plaintiff \nRichard Jones was subject to a search. Plaintiff does, however, allege that an individual named \nCarl A. Barnes was subject to a strip search and visual body cavity search on December 7, 2015. \nCompl. at ¶ 45. While it is true that at the motion to dismiss stage, a plaintiff receives the benefit \nof all plausible allegations in the complaint and reasonable inferences, this Court “need not \naccept  inferences…unsupported  by  the  facts  set  out  in  the  complaint”  See  Kowal  v.  MCI \nCommc’ns Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678; Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 570. There is no basis to infer plaintiff suffered because of a search of which he alleges \nCarl A. Barnes was the subject. Plaintiff should not be afforded the assumption that he is alleging \nthe facts regarding the search on his own behalf. \nB.  Routine Searches of Inmates Prior to Admission to the General Population \nare Constitutional. \n \nEven  if  this  Court  construes  the  allegations  in  paragraph  45  of  the  Complaint  as \npertaining to Richard Jones, the routine search plaintiff describes is not unconstitutional. The \nsearch—conducted after plaintiff had been outside of the detention facility—did not violate \nplaintiff’s Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights. The Supreme Court and this Circuit have upheld \nthe use of routine body cavity searches in detention centers fraught with security concerns, such \nas D.C. Jail. \nThe seminal Supreme Court opinion on body cavity searches is Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. \n520 (1979). There, the Supreme Court rejected a Fourth Amendment challenge to a policy of \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 13 of 17\nvisual body cavity searches for all detainees following contact visits with outsiders. Id. at 560. \nThe Court applied a balancing test to determine the reasonableness of the search:  “Courts must \nconsider  the  scope  of  the  particular  intrusion,  the  manner  in  which  it  is  conducted,  the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.” Id. at 559. Following Bell, \ncircuits  (but  not  the  D.C.  Circuit)  have  split  when  considering  whether  the  balancing  test \ndemanded individualized suspicion before an arrestee could be subject to a body cavity search. \nCompare Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983), with Florence \nv. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 621 F.3d 296, 308 (3rd Cir. 2010), and Powell v. \nBarrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1314 (11th Cir. 2008),2 and Bull v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 595 \nF.3d 964, 975 (9th Cir. 2010). \nThe case law in this circuit is clear. The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit issued a decision directly on point in Bame v. Dillard, 637 F.3d 380 (D.C. Cir. 2011). In \nBame,  the  Court  considered  a  challenge  to  a  United  States  Marshal  Service  policy  which \nauthorized strip searches of all male arrestees upon arrival at the Superior Court of the District of \nColumbia before being housed in the cellblock. Id. The court proceeded directly to the question \nof  whether,  at  the  time  of  the  search  in  2002,  plaintiffs  had  a  clearly  established  Fourth \nAmendment right to be free from the search absent individualized suspicion. Id. at 386. The \ncourt found, “[t]he governing precedent was then, as it is now, Bell v. Wolfish, and nothing in \nBell requires individualized, reasonable suspicion before strip searching a person entering a \ndetention facility.” Id.; see also Johnson v. District of Columbia, 780 F. Supp. 2d 62, 74 (D.D.C. \n                                                 \n2   The Eleventh Circuit in Powell noted that most courts (and its own precedent) had \nmisinterpreted Bell as requiring reasonable suspicion for strip searching minor offenders where, \nin fact, that decision neither required individualized suspicion nor differentiated the degree of \nsuspicion required based on the type of offense. Id. at 1307–11. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 14 of 17\n2011). The court explained further that “the ‘Court’s rationale in Bell applies equally to any \ndetention facility that is ‘fraught with serious security dangers,’ as well as the cellblock at the \nSuperior Court.” Bame, 637 F.3d at 387 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 559).  \nThe following year, the United States Supreme Court concurred; explicitly rejecting the \nproposition that individualized, reasonable suspicion is required before an inmate entering the \ngeneral population may be subject to a routine, strip search or visual cavity search. Florence v. \nBd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 566 U.S. 318 (2012). The Supreme Court explained, \n“Correctional officials have a legitimate interest, indeed a responsibility, to ensure that jails are \nnot made less secure by reason of what new detainees may carry in on their bodies.” Id. at 318. \nThe Court granted deference to jail officials in their responses and procedures and maintained \nthat where contraband and safety within the prison are concerned, individualized reasonable \nsuspicion to conduct a search is not required. Id. at 330 (quoting Block v. Rutherford, 468 US \n576, 584).3 Although the Court discussed limited circumstances where individualized reasonable \nsuspicion may be necessary, those situations involve non-entry to general population, or minor, \nnon-violent or civil offenses. None of those circumstances apply here.  \nHere, when plaintiff was searched he was re-entering the general population at D.C. Jail. \nWhen a prisoner is entering the general population from the outside, regardless of the reason, \nprison officials do not need individualized reasonable suspicion to conduct a search; barring \npotential contraband from entry into the prison population is a constitutionally sound objective \nfor the search. As such, plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed.  \n \n                                                 \n3   Where contraband is concerned the Supreme Court opinion discussed the difficulties of \nfiltering  through  arbitrary  factors  such  as  the  severity  of  the  offense  or  prior  offenses  in \ndetermining whether or not an individual carries, or has been coerced to carry, contraband. \nFlorence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 566 U.S. 318, 334-39 (2012).  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 15 of 17\nIV.  Plaintiff’s Common Law Claims Should Be Dismissed For Failure to State a Claim. \n \nA.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for False Arrest. \n \nThe elements of a common law false arrest claim and a constitutional false arrest claim \nare practically identical. Barnhardt v. District of Columbia, 723 F. Supp. 2d 197, 214 (D.D.C. \n2010). “[T]he requisite elements in both cases are that the plaintiff was arrested against his will \nand that the arrest was unlawful.” McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 741 F.2d 1406, 1413, 239 U.S. App. \nD.C. 247 (D.C. Cir. 1984). To prevail, “plaintiff must demonstrate ‘that the [District] acted \nwithout probable cause, in an objective constitutional sense, to effectuate his arrest.’” Barnhardt, \n723 F. Supp. 2d at 214 (quoting Taylor v. District of Columbia, 691 A.2d 121, 125 (D.C. 1997)).  \nThis Court held in Barnes that “overdetention” does not provide a basis for a Fourth \nAmendment claim because there is no seizure where the individual is already in DOC custody. \nSee above Section II-B at 6 (citing Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 273-74). On that basis, plaintiff’s \nalleged overdetention cannot constitute a false arrest. Plaintiff was lawfully in DOC custody on \nDecember 7, 2015, when he was taken to the courthouse. Compl. at ¶ 40-41. He was not released \nfrom DOC custody at the courthouse, but was instead transported back to D.C. Jail until his \nrelease “several hours” later. Id. at ¶ 41. Simply put, there are no factual allegations anywhere in \nthe Complaint to support a false arrest claim. The claim should be dismissed. \nB.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for Invasion of Privacy. \n \nThe tort of invasion of privacy for “intrusion of seclusion” requires “(1) an invasion or \ninterference by physical intrusion, by use of a defendant's sense of sight or hearing, or by use of \nsome other form of investigation or examination; (2) into a place where the plaintiff has secluded \nhimself, or into his private or secret concerns; (3) that would be highly offensive to an ordinary, \nreasonable person.” Wolf v. Regardie, 553 A.2d 1213, 1217 (D.C. 1989) (internal citations \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 10-1   Filed 03/21/17   Page 16 of 17\nomitted). Plaintiff’s claim fails because he has not plead facts sufficient to establish that he had a \nreasonable expectation of privacy from search upon his reentry at D.C. Jail; or that the routine \nsearch would be highly offensive to an ordinary, reasonable person in his situation. But even \nmore detrimental to plaintiff’s claim however, is that plaintiff failed to even allege that the strip \nsearch was offensive to him.4 The Court should dismiss plaintiff’s invasion of privacy claim. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the District’s Motion to Dismiss and \ndismiss the action with prejudice. \nDated:  March 21, 2017.

Civil Action No.:  16-2405 (CKK) \n   \nGOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF   \nCOLUMBIA, \n \nDefendant. \n \nPLAINTIFF’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS THE FIRST \nAMENDED COMPLAINT  \n Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss [17] Mr. Jones’ First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) [12] \nshould be denied because Mr. Jones’ pleads sufficient plausible facts to state a claim for each \nclaim pled in the First Amended Complaint and the District does not raise any legally valid \narguments.1 \nStandard of Review \nA plaintiff's complaint need only provide \"a short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief\" in order to survive a motion to dismiss. A complaint \nmust give the defendants notice of the claims and the grounds upon which they rest, but \n\"[s]pecific facts are not necessary.\" Atherton v. D.C. Office of the Mayor, 567 F.3d 672, 681 \n(2009); Jones v. Kirchner, 835 F.3d 74, 79 (D.C. Cir. 2016). At the motion to dismiss stage the \nreviewing court must treat the complaint's factual allegations as true and must grant plaintiff the \n                                                 \n1 Mr. Jones does not plead an Eighth Amendment over-detention claim in the First Amended Complaint. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 2 of 46\nbenefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged. Atherton, 567 F.3d at 677; \nJones, 835 F.3d at 79.  \nI.  Mr. Jones States Over-Detention Claims on Both the Predicate Violation and the \nMonel Prong for all of his Constitutional Over-detention Claims. \nMr. Jones alleged that he was a court return entitled to release by virtue of a court ordered \nrelease obtained at a court hearing returned to the DC Jail after a federal Judge ordered his \nrelease and that he was held for several hours after R&D staff returned him to his cell, and \nsubjected to a degrading strip-search before being released. FAC, ¶ 127-134. The total period of \nhis over-detention from the time when the District Court judge ordered his release until he was \nreleased from the DC Jail was more than five hours. Id. \n\"[I]n considering whether a plaintiff has stated a claim for municipal liability, the district \ncourt must conduct a two-step inquiry. First, the court must determine whether the complaint \nstates a claim for a predicate constitutional violation. Second, if so, then the court must \ndetermine whether the complaint states a claim that a custom or policy of the municipality \ncaused the violation.\" Sheikh v. District of Columbia, 77 F. Supp. 3d 73, 84 (D.D.C. 2015) citing \nBaker v. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Mr. Jones satisfies both of \nthese steps as described below for all of his Constitutional over-detention claims. \nA.  Mr. Jones states a claim for a predicate constitutional violation for both a 5th \nAmendment and a 4th Amendment over-detention claim.  \nMr. Jones states a claim for a predicate constitutional violation for both a 5th Amendment \nsubstantive Due Process and a 4th Amendment over-detention claim.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 3 of 46\n1.  Even a thirty-minute overdetention of a court return after they have been \nordered released could work a violation of the person's constitutional liberty \nrights. \n“While there is no set definition for an \"overdetention,\" it generally means that once a \nprisoner was entitled to release -- because of a court order, the expiration of a sentence, or \notherwise -- the authority having custody over that person held them too long.” Barnes v. District \nof Columbia, 793 F. Supp. 2d 260, 266 (D.D.C. 2011). Even a thirty-minute overdetention of a \nprisoner after they have been ordered released could work a violation of the person's \nconstitutional liberty rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 276. \nDistrict Courts have held that over-detentions of court returns as short as two and a half \nto three hours state 4th Amendment over-detention claims. See e.g., Arline v. City of \nJacksonville, 359 F. Supp. 2d 1300, 1308 (M.D.Fla.2005) (jury question as to whether or not \nplaintiff's two and half hour detention following his acquittal on all criminal charges violated the \nFourth Amendment); Jones v. Cochran, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20625 (S.D. Fla. 1994)(three \nhours). A court return is someone who leaves a DOC facility for court and returns on the same \nday. FAC, ¶ 24. \nMr. Jones states a predicate claim because he was overdetained for more than five hours \nfrom the time the District Court ordered his release until the DOC released him from the DC Jail. \nFAC, ¶ 127-134. His over-detention included the time from when the Marshals handed him off \nto DOC transport staff at the DC Jail after the District Court Judge ordered his release, transport \ntime from the federal courthouse to the R&D post at the DC Jail, processing time in R&D, and \nthe several hour period from the R&D staff returned him to his cell until his eventual release \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 4 of 46\nfrom the DC Jail. FAC, ¶ ¶ 128-133. This period is sufficient to state a claim under the motion to \ndismiss standard under the case law and given the District’s concession in Barnes that it needed \nonly two to two and ½ hours to process a release. Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 278-79 (undisputed \nthat the DOC's release process should take from 2 to 2.5 hours to complete). See District’s \nmemorandum of law [17-1], p. 7 (“Memorandum”). \nNone of the reasons the District sets out in its motion to dismiss undermine these claims \nunder the motion to dismiss standard. The District’s reliance on Judge Lamberth’s summary \njudgment opinion in Barnes is misplaced because of the different standard employed at summary \njudgment, Atherton, 567 F.3d at 677, and because of the developed factual record available at \nsummary judgment which is not available here in a motion to dismiss. See Barnes v. District of \nColumbia, 242 F.R.D. 113, 116 (D.D.C. 2007).     \n2.  Mr. Jones’ over-detention in DOC custody runs from when the District \nCourt Judge ordered his release until the DOC released him from custody \nfrom the DC Jail.  \nMr. Jones alleged that he was over-detained for more than just “several hours.” FAC, ¶ \n132. He was held for “several hours” just at the DC Jail after the R&D staff returned him to his \ncell until his release. FAC, ¶ 130-132. To this “several hours” period must be added the time \nfrom when the District Court Judge ordered his release up until the R&D staff returned him from \nhis cell. FAC, ¶ 128-132.    \nFor purposes of Mr. Jones’ 4th Amendment and the 5th Amendment over-detention \nclaims, FAC, Claim 1, (and his common law false imprisonment claim, FAC, Claim 4) Mr. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 5 of 46\nJones’ over-detention in DOC custody is measured from when the District Court Judge ordered \nhis release until the DOC released him from custody. \nFor purposes of Mr. Jones’ procedural due process liberty interest claim Mr. Jones’ over-\ndetention in DOC custody is measured from when the courtroom Marshals handed him into the \ncustody of the DOC transport staff until the DOC released him from custody at the DC Jail. See \nD.C. Code § 24-211.02a(a)(2) (an inmate ordered released pursuant to a court order shall be \nreleased within 5 hours of transfer from the custody of the United States Marshals Service into \nthe custody of the Department of Corrections unless the inmate has other holds). FAC, Claim 2. \nMr. Jones pled that after a judge ordered his release at the federal courthouse, the DOC \ntransported him back to the DC Jail instead of releasing him from the courthouse or the MHU. \nFAC, ¶ ¶ 128-129. Upon arrival at the DC Jail R&D area Jail staff returned him to his cell \ninstead of holding him in the R&D area. FAC, ¶ ¶ 131-32. They DC Jail did not release for \nseveral hours after returning him to his cell. FAC, ¶ ¶ 131-32. Mr. Jones pled in the alternative \nthat he was held more than five hours before release “after being transferred by the Marshals in \nthe courthouse to the DOC transport officers. FAC, ¶ 133. \nThe District contends that this Court should not accept plaintiff’s alternatively pled facts. \nMemorandum, p. 7. But the District does not state any facts or law why this Court should not \naccept Mr. Jones’ alternatively pled facts. \nUntil plaintiffs take discovery on this issue they must plead facts in the alternative. This \nsituation – plaintiffs not having access to facts known solely to the defendant until after \ndiscovery – is so common that the drafters of the federal Rules specifically provided for it. Fed. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 6 of 46\nR. Civ. P. 8(d)(2); Elena v. Municipality of San Juan, 677 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2012); Whitney v. \nGuys, Inc., 700 F.3d 1118, 1130 (8th Cir. 2012). \nMr. Jones alleges that the DC Jail did not release him for “several hours” after returning \nhim to his cell after he was processed in the R&D post at the DC Jail. FAC, ¶ 132. Several is an \nindeterminate number that means “more than two but fewer than many.” Merriam Webster, \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/several. “Many” means consisting of or amounting \nto a large but indefinite number. So, based on this analysis, Mr. Jones was held for more than \nfive hours just after being sent to his cell from the R&D post after returning to the DC Jail. This \nseveral hour period is in addition to the separate period of time which elapsed from when the \nDistrict Court ordered his release in the courtroom at his hearing until the R&D staff returned \nhim to his cell. \nMr. Jones’s allegation in the alternative is that he was held more than five hours before \nrelease “after being transferred by the Marshals in the courthouse to the DOC transport officers. \nFAC, ¶ 133. See D.C. Code § 24-211.02a(a)(2) (an inmate ordered released pursuant to a court \norder shall be released within 5 hours of transfer from the custody of the United States Marshals \nService into the custody of the Department of Corrections unless the inmate has other holds). So, \nto the “several hours” Mr. Jones spent in DOC custody from the time he left the R&D post in the \nDC Jail until his release from the DC Jail must be added the period of time from when the \ncourtroom Marshals handed him over to the DOC transport people (after the District Court Judge \nordered his release), the time it took for the DOC transport people to process him and transport \nhim to the DC Jail R&D, and the time the R&D spent processing him before returning him to his \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 7 of 46\ncell. This time period easily exceeds five hours drawing inferences in favor of Mr. Jones as the \nmotion to dismiss standard requires. Atherton, 567 F.3d at 677. \n3.  Mr. Jones states a 5th Amendment over-detention claim.  \nCourts have uniformly recognized that over-detaining prisoners after they become \nentitled to release violates their 14th Amendment (or in the case of District prisoners, their 5th \nAmendment) due process liberty rights. Even a thirty-minute overdetention of a prisoner after \nthey have been ordered released could work a violation of the person's constitutional liberty \nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 276. \nFor example, in Young v. City of Little Rock, the Eighth Circuit affirmed a $100,000 \njury verdict in favor of a court return who was sent from court (where the judge ordered her \nreleased) back to the jail for “out-processing” and a strip-search violated due process even \nthough the over-detention was only thirty minutes and even though the defendant argued that it \nshould have been allowed some time for “out-processing,” that is, the administrative steps \nnecessary for release. 249 F.3d 730, 736 (8th Cir. 2001). Significantly, the Young Court rejected \nthe defendants’ contention that “some period of time must be allowed for an order of release to \nbe carried out, and that certain administrative formalities (referred to as \"out-processing\") are \npermissible,” holding that, “Certainly the jury might have accepted this argument, but we do not \nthink it had to.” Young, 249 F.3d at 735-36. \nNothing in Judge Lamberth’s summary judgment opinion in Barnes is to the contrary. As \nexplained in detail below, Judge Lamberth did not hold that delaying a court return’s release to \ncheck for other cases, warrants, or detainers is an automatic justification for over-detaining a \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 8 of 46\ncourt return entitled to release. Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 275. He merely stated that \n“Temporarily retaining custody over an inmate who is entitled to release in order to accomplish \nadministrative tasks incident to that release is not per se unconstitutional.” Barnes, 793 F. Supp. \n2d at 275. \nProvided that a pleading states a claim for relief under the plausibility standard, it is not \nnecessary for the pleading to also rebut other possible explanations for the conduct alleged, even \nif those alternatives might appear to be more likely. Jones v. Kirchner, 835 F.3d at 79–80 \n(plaintiff stated plausible Fourth Amendment claim for failure to knock-and-announce by \npleading that he did not hear any knock or announcement; not necessary to plead additional facts \nto rebut possibility that knock-and-announce occurred, but was simply not heard by plaintiff). \nTherefore, at this stage, “before evidence is available and before the Defendants have even \ndenied the allegations against them,” Mr. Jones is not required to plead facts showing that the \nover-detention was justified by out-processing tasks. 835 F.3d at 80. \nThus, under this precedent, at the motion to dismiss stage, Mr. Jones clearly states an \nover-detention claim under the 5th Amendment. \n4.  Mr. Jones states a 4th Amendment over-detention claim.  \nMoreover, courts routinely hold, especially at the motion to dismiss stage, that removing \ncourt returns entitled to release from the courtroom to send them back to the jail in irons for \nrelease processing violates the 4th Amendment. See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. \n113, 118 (D.D.C. 2007)(plaintiffs’ allegations of Fourth Amendment violations are sufficient to \nsurvive a motion to dismiss). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 9 of 46\nDistrict Courts have held that over-detentions of court returns as short as two and a half \nto three hours state 4th Amendment over-detention claims. See e.g., Arline v. City of \nJacksonville, 359 F. Supp. 2d at 1308 (jury question as to whether or not plaintiff's two and half \nhour detention following his acquittal on all criminal charges violated the Fourth Amendment); \nJones v. Cochran, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20625 (S.D. Fla. 1994)(three hour over-detention; \ndefendant’s motion for summary judgment denied as to both plaintiffs’ 4th Amendment and 14th \nAmendment over-detention claims where defendant had a practice or policy of returning \nacquitted court returns to jail for release and a strip-search instead of releasing them from the \ncourtroom; mere possibility that another warrant was in existence does not qualify as a \nparticularized suspicion justifying practice). Other District Courts have held that plaintiffs state \n4th Amendment claims for longer periods as well. Shultz v. Dart, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n156546, at *9, at *14-15  (N.D. Ill. Oct. 31, 2013)(court return states both 4th Amendment and \n14th Amendment claims for brief over-detention after he was returned from court where a judge \nordered his release back to the jail; “why send an unescorted free man into the general population \nof Cook County Jail?”).  \nThe rationale of these cases is that once a judge orders someone released in the \ncourtroom they are free, and taking them back into custody and transporting them back to the jail \nconstitutes a “re-seizure” under the 4th Amendment. See e.g., Shultz v. Dart, 2013 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 156546, at *14-15; Otero v. Dart, No. 12 C 3148, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1389, at *15 \n(N.D. Ill. Jan. 7, 2016). \nSo Mr. Jones also states a 4th Amendment claim for his “several hour” over-detention \nclaim. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 10 of 46\n5.  Defendant’s discussion of Mr. Jones’s 5th Amendment substantive due \nprocess over-detention claim. \nThe District discusses Mr. Jones’ 5th Amendment substantive due process over-detention \nclaim at pages 9 to 10. Memorandum, p. 9-10. First, the District contends that Plaintiff cannot \nmeet the standard set forth in Cohen, because there are no facts alleged in the Complaint \nsufficient to infer that the “detention”—which lasted several hours—was so egregious that it may \nfairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience. Memorandum, p. 10.  \nNot so. Mr. Jones satisfies this standard by pleading an over-detention in excess of \nseveral hours, more than five. Even a thirty-minute overdetention of a prisoner after they have \nbeen ordered released could work a violation of the person's constitutional liberty rights under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 276; Young, 249 F.3d at 736. \nThe cases the District cites are distinguishable. The liberty at issue in this case is a \nperson’s right to be free from unjustified confinement. This liberty interest is deeply rooted: \n\"[f]reedom from bodily restraint has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due \nProcess Clause from arbitrary governmental action.\" Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 275. \nIn contrast, George Wash. Univ. v. D.C., 355 U.S. App. D.C. 12, 318 F.3d 203, 205 \n(2003) and Silverman v. Barry, 269 U.S. App. D.C. 327, 845 F.2d 1072, 1074 (1988) are zoning \ndisputes. \nThe standard announced in Cohen is that “In order to establish a substantive Due Process \nclaim, a plaintiff must show that the state actor was deliberately indifferent to his constitutional \nrights and that such conduct shocks the conscience.” Cohen v. District of Columbia, 744 F. Supp. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 11 of 46\n2d 236, 243 (D.D.C. 2010). Without deciding whether the subjective or objective standard \napplies to deliberate indifference in the foster care context, the District Court held that at the \nsummary judgment stage the plaintiff failed to establish that the defendants “knew or should \nhave known” that the foster child was at substantial risk of harm, and that they failed to act in the \nface of such a risk.” Cohen, 744 F. Supp. 2d at 245. This case is at the motion to dismiss phase \nwhich present a different standard more favorable to plaintiff. A court may not grant a motion to \ndismiss for failure to state a claim \"even if it strikes a savvy judge that . . . recovery is very \nremote and unlikely.\" Atherton, 567 F.3d at 681. \nJudge Collyer’s comments about the applicable standard in Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. \n825, 837 (1994) are (1) dicta; and (2) distinguishable because that case deals with the level of \nsubjective knowledge required to hold an individual prison official liable in their individual \ncapacity. The District is an entity defendant. \nAnyway, with respect to an entity defendant, the “inquiry is an objective one—the \nfactfinder must ask \"whether the municipality knew or should have known of the risk of \nconstitutional violations.\"” Lightfoot v. District of Columbia, 273 F.R.D. 314, 321 (D.D.C. \n2011) citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 841, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1994). \nMr. Jones establishes that the First Amended Complaint states a claim for the District’s \nentity liability below in a separate section.  \n6.  The District’s citation to Judge Lamberth’s summary judgment opinion in \nBarnes with respect to the 4th Amendment claim is inapposite at the motion \nto dismiss phase. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 12 of 46\nThe District, citing Judge Lamberth’s summary judgment opinion in Barnes, contends \nthat “this Court has held that an overdetention does not constitute a Fourth Amendment \nviolation,.” 793 F. Supp. 2d at 273-74. Memorandum [17-1], p. 6. But, the District’s citation of \nthe Barnes summary judgment opinion on this point ignores the procedural posture of this case \nand the difference in standards between a 12(b)(6) motion and a summary judgment motion. At \nthe motion to dismiss stage the reviewing court must treat the complaint's factual allegations as \ntrue and must grant plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts \nalleged. Atherton, 567 F.3d at 677; Jones, 835 F.3d at 79. In Barnes, Judge Lamberth denied the \nDistrict’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ 4th Amendment over-detention claim holding that \nplaintiffs allegations that “they essentially were re-arrested or re-seized … are sufficient to \nsurvive a motion to dismiss, and further development of the record should disclose whether the \nseizures were reasonable.” Barnes, 242 F.R.D. at 118. \nSo District Courts routinely deny motions to dismiss over-detention claims based on the \n4th Amendment at the motion to dismiss stage. Barnes, 242 F.R.D. at 118 (plaintiffs’ allegations \nof Fourth Amendment violations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss); Shultz v. Dart, \n2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156546, at *14-15 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 31, 2013)(at motion to dismiss stage \ncourt return states both 4th Amendment and 14th Amendment claims for brief over-detention \nafter he was returned from court where a judge ordered his release back to the jail). The rationale \nof these cases is that once a judge orders someone released in the courtroom they are free, and \ntaking them back into custody and transporting them back to the jail constitutes a “re-seizure” \nunder the 4th Amendment. See e.g., Shultz v. Dart, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156546, at *9.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 13 of 46\nOf course, Courts even deny summary judgment to defendants where plaintiffs base their \nover-detention claims on the 4th Amendment. Otero v. Dart, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1389, at *20 \n(N.D. Ill. Jan. 7, 2016)(court return plaintiff presented sufficient evidence creating a genuine \nissue of material fact for trial that Defendant's overdetention policy is unreasonable under the \nFourth Amendment); Arline v. City of Jacksonville, 359 F. Supp. 2d at 1308 (jury question as to \nwhether or not plaintiff's two and half hour detention following his acquittal on all criminal \ncharges violated the Fourth Amendment); Jones v. Cochran, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20625, 13-\n17, 17-18 (S.D. Fla. 1994)(defendant’s motion for summary judgment denied as to both \nplaintiffs’ 4th Amendment and 14th Amendment over-detention claims where defendant had a \npractice or policy of returning acquitted court returns to jail for release and a strip-search instead \nof releasing them from the courtroom; mere possibility that another warrant was in existence \ndoes not qualify as a particularized suspicion justifying practice). \nMoreover, a careful reading of Judge Lamberth’s summary judgment opinion shows that \nhe did not rule as a matter of law that plaintiffs in an over-detention case could never prevail on a \n4th Amendment over-detention claim. Judge Lamberth wrote that, “plaintiffs were already in \ncustody at the time they were ordered released or their sentences expired. Their freedom of \nmovement had already been terminated,” so there was no “seizure” under the 4th Amendment. \nBarnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 274. But, Judge Lamberth also wrote, “plaintiffs haven't presented \nany facts suggesting that their overdetentions involved fresh \"seizures\" warranting a Fourth \nAmendment analysis.” Id. The cases cited above show that the Judge’s order releasing a court \nreturn is the legally significant event that legally ends the lawful detention. The Marshals’ \n“stepping back” a court return, or handing them off to the DOC, constitutes a physical-seizure \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 14 of 46\n7.  Detaining a court return after a judge has ordered their release to check for \nother cases, warrants, or detainers holding the court return is not an \nautomatic justification for over-detaining a court return entitled to release. \nThese cases cited above – whether decided under the 4th Amendment or the 5th/14th \nAmendment – also make clear that time spent “out-processing” a “court return” after their court \nappearance – checking for other cases, warrants, or detainers holding the court return – is not an \nautomatic justification for over-detaining a court return entitled to release. See e.g., Young, 249 \nF.3d at 735-36. These cases hold that checks for other cases, detainers, and warrants can or even \nshould be performed before the court appearance or at least while the defendant is still in the \ncourtroom. “[M]any, if not most, of the administrative tasks incident to an inmate's release can \nbe undertaken prior to the expiration of a sentence or before a jail's receipt of a paper court order \nauthorizing release -- unlike in the probable cause context, where all of the administrative tasks \nmust necessarily follow the detainee's arrest. Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 276 (explaining why the \nadministrative burdens in the over-detention context are much lighter than in the probable cause \nhearing context).  \nEven in his summary judgment opinion Judge Lamberth did not hold that checking for \nother cases, warrants, or detainers holding the court return – is not an automatic justification for \nover-detaining a court return entitled to release. He merely held that “Temporarily retaining \ncustody over an inmate who is entitled to release in order to accomplish administrative tasks \nincident to that release is not per se unconstitutional.” Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 275.  \nSome jails are able to perform the “warrant” check in as a little as 15 minutes. Jones v. \nCochran, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20625 at 9. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 15 of 46\nThe District maintains an inmate tracking database that contains all of the person’s \nwarrants, detainers, and other cases, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the DOC \ncould not perform these checks in fifteen minutes before a court return goes to court.  \n8.  Judge Lamberth actually wrote that “the maximum permissible \nadministrative delay in the overdetention context likely falls well short of the \n48-hour horizon set out in McLaughlin; Judge Lamberth set the outer time \nlimit at midnight of the date the person was entitled to release; Two to five \nhours now appropriate.” \nThe District contends that: \nAdditionally, in Barnes the plaintiffs asked this Court to impose a bright-line time \nlimit of two and a half hours for the DOC release process. Barnes, 793 F. Supp. \n2d at 274. The Barnes Court expressly declined, finding only that the maximum \npermissible administrative delay “likely” falls short of the 48 hours horizon set for \ndetentions pending probable cause determinations after warrantless arrests. Id. at \n275-76.  \nMemorandum, p. 7. \nThere are two ideas in play here, the minimum amount of time that can state a \nconstitutional over-detention claim, which is dispositive of the District’s motion to dismiss Mr. \nJones’s over-detention claims, and the maximum amount of time that the District has to make \nreleases of court returns entitled to release, which relates to the class definition. \nThe District’s passage suggests that Judge Lamberth was indicating that the “the \nmaximum permissible administrative delay” was closer to 42 hours than two hours. A careful \nreading of the passage in Judge Lamberth’s summary judgment opinion and the District’s \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 16 of 46\nsummary of it shows that the District’s summary of Judge Lamberth’s ruling omits words and \nthe omitted words are legally significant language \nThe omission of the legally significant words are part of the reason the passage suas \nquoted suggests other than what Judge Lamberth actually wrote. Whereas the District reports that \nJudge Lamberth wrote, “the maximum permissible administrative delay “likely” falls short of the \n48 hours horizon,” Judge Lamberth actually wrote that “the maximum permissible administrative \ndelay in the overdetention context likely falls well short of the 48-hour horizon set out \nin McLaughlin.” Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 275-76 (emphasis added).    \nThe relevant passage in Judge Lamberth’s summary judgment opinion reads: \nIn recognition of these facts, courts appear to agree that the maximum permissible \nadministrative delay in the overdetention context likely falls well short of the 48-\nhour horizon set out in McLaughlin.  \"[E]ven a thirty-minute detention after being \nordered released could work a violation of a prisoner's constitutional rights under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.\"  The Eighth Circuit has held that once a judge \norders the release of a prisoner, any continued detention unlawfully deprives the \nprisoner of his liberty because \"the state has lost its lawful authority\" to hold him.  \n \nBarnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 276 (internal citation omitted). \nSo, in the first sentence of this passage Judge Lamberth was contrasting the maximum \npermissible administrative delay in the probable cause hearing context (48 hours according to \nMcLaughlin) with the “the maximum permissible administrative delay in the overdetention \ncontext.” The backdrop to this contrast is that Judge Lamberth was rejecting the District’s \ncontention that by analogy to McLaughlin it should have 48 hours to make releases. Barnes, 793 \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 17 of 46\nF. Supp. 2d at 275-76. See also Barnes, 242 F.R.D. 113, 117-18 (rejecting same argument at \nmotion to dismiss stage). \nJudge Lamberth also used the phrase “the point at which overdetention becomes \npresumptively unreasonable is likely to fall well short of the 48-hour window in McLaughlin” in \nhis motion to dismiss opinion. Barnes, 242 F.R.D. at 118, \nThe reason that Judge Lamberth rejected the 48 hour McLaughlin rule in the over-\ndetention context is that in the over-detention context the administrative burdens on the \ngovernment are lighter, e.g., the government has already identified the person, and all they have \nto do is check for other cases, warrants, and detainers, and in the over-detention context the \nindividual’s interest is much greater – “absolute” in fact. Barnes, 242 F.R.D. at 117-18. \nThe second and third sentences in the summary judgment opinion illustrate Judge \nLamberth’s point that 48 hours is too long in the over-detention context. The reason is that \nbecause the minimum amount of time that states an over-detention claim is as brief as half an \nhour, the maximum bright line outer limit for making releases (maximum permissible \nadministrative delay) is way shorter than 48 hours.  \nIn fact, in his summary judgment opinion in Barnes Judge Lamberth did set a bright-line \nouter time limit of hours holding that for over-detentions occurring “during the first 16 months \nof the class period -- September 1, 2005 to December 31, 2006 -- the DOC violated the due \nprocess rights of the plaintiffs and the members of the overdetention class who were \noverdetained during that period by not releasing them by midnight on the day that they were \nentitled to release. No reasonable juror could find otherwise.” Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 280. So \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 18 of 46\nno matter what time a person was ordered released at court (Superior Court hearings in C 10 \nofter run quite late – till 7 or 8 pm), the release deadline was midnight. This means that for court \nreturns entitled to release released in the evening the District had only several hours to release \nthem. \nThe maximum bright line outer limit for making releases/ maximum permissible \nadministrative delay also has relevance to the certification issue. In their motions for class action \ntreatment in Bynum and Barnes (as in the First Amended Complaint in this case) plaintiffs \ncontended that there is bright-line period of time beyond which an over-detention is \npresumptively unreasonable, that is midnight on the day on which the person is entitled to be \nreleased. See e.g., Bynum v. District of Columbia, 214 F.R.D. 27, 32 (D.D.C. 2003). Plaintiffs \npled a bright-line outer time limit so that the over-detention class definition would “set[s] forth \ngeneral parameters that limit the scope of the class to such a degree that it is administratively \nfeasible for this Court to determine whether a particular individual is a member of the class. Id. \nat 32. How much time was “bound up with the merits of plaintiffs' claims.” Id. at 40. \nJudge Lamberth adopted this outer time limit in his summary judgment opinion. Barnes, \n793 F. Supp. 2d at 280. \nAs Judge Kamberth stated in certifying the over-detention class in Bynum, “such a \nquestion [the bright-line outer time limit for making releases] is bound up with the merits of \nplaintiffs' claims.” Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 40. The answer to the question – two hours as Mr. \nJones contends, five hours as the D.C. Council has decided – will ultimately be plugged into the \nclass definition if the Constitutional over-detention claim proceeds that far.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 19 of 46\nThe D.C. Council has now set a bright-line outer time limit of 5 hours for court returns \nand by noon on the date the sentence expires for others. D.C. Code § 24-211.02a(a)(2) and (3). \nMr. Jones maintains that bright-line outer time limit for making releases should be two \nhours for court returns entitled to release based on the time needed to process releases. \nB.  Mr. Jones states a claim for a predicate constitutional violation for his \nprocedural due process claim based on liberty interest created by D.C. Code \n§ 24-211.02a(a)(2). \nMr. Jones states a claim for a predicate constitutional violation of his procedural due \nprocess claim based on liberty interest created by D.C. Code § 24-211.02a(a)(2). \nIn Mr. Jones’ Claim 2 Mr. Jones alleges that the D.C. Council created a liberty interest by \nenacting D.C. Code § 24-211.02a(a)(2) which guarantees an inmate ordered released pursuant to \na court order (a court return) the right to be released within 5 hours of transfer from the custody \nof the United States Marshals Service into the custody of the Department of Corrections (unless \nthe inmate has other holds justifying their release). FAC, ¶¶ 154 to 158. \nThe relevant part of the statute provides: “For an inmate ordered released pursuant to a \ncourt order, the inmate shall be released within 5 hours of transfer from the custody of the United \nStates Marshals Service into the custody of the Department of Corrections.” D.C. Code § 24-\n211.02a(a)(2). \nThe mandatory language in the statute creates a liberty interest in court returns entitled to \nrelease. See e.g., Ellis v. District of Columbia, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21092, *22 (D.D.C. Mar. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 20 of 46\n30, 1995)(District of Columbia's regulations on parole use mandatory language like that in the \nstatutes in Greenholtz and Allen, thus creating an expectation of release). \nThe due process clause entitles a person to some process before the state may deprive \nthem of their liberty interest. The default position for due process is pre-deprivation notice and a \npre-deprivation hearing. Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 81-82 (1972). The rationale is the best \nway to prevent substantively unfair and mistaken deprivations of property interests is to give the \nowner an opportunity to speak up in their own defense, and to make the State listen to what they \nhave to say, before the deprivation occurs. Fuentes, 407 U.S. 81- 82; Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 \nU.S. 545, 551 (1965)(hearing on motion to set aside adoption decree did not restore father to the \nposition he would have been in had he got pre-deprivation notice and a hearing before the \ntermination of his parental rights). \nHere, the District gave Mr. Jones no process. This violates Due Process because however \nweighty the governmental interest may be in a given case the government may never reduce the \namount of “process” to zero. Propert v. District of Columbia, 948 F.2d 1327, 1332 (D.C. Cir. \n1991). \nMr. Jones pled in the alternative that “he was held more than five hours before release \nafter being transferred by the Marshals in the courthouse to the DOC transport officers.” FAC, ¶ \n132. Therefore Mr. Jones states a claim.  \nThe District addressed Mr. Jones’ procedural due process claim on pages 7 to 9 of its \nmemorandum of law. Memorandum, pgs. 7-9. The only objections the District raises are that (1) \nin his summary judgment opinion in Barnes Judge Lamberth refused to impose a bright-line time \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 21 of 46\nlimit of two and a half hours for the DOC release process, Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 274; (2) \nthis Court should not accept plaintiff’s alternatively pled facts, that is, “Mr. Jones pleads in the \nalternative that he was held more than five hours before release after being transferred by the \nMarshals in the courthouse to the DOC transport officers, FAC, ¶ 133; and (3) “[t]emporarily \nretaining custody over an inmate who is entitled to release in order to accomplish an \nadministrative task incident to that release is not per se unconstitutional.” Memorandum, p. 7-8. \nOddly enough the District did not challenge that the statute created a liberty interest or \nthat the DOC failed to give Mr. Jones the required pre-deprivation notice. \nTherefore, the District waived these objections because arguments raised for the first time \nin a reply brief are deemed waived. Estate of Gaither v. District of Columbia, 655 F. Supp. 2d \n69, 87 n.13 (D.D.C. 2009). \"Considering an argument advanced for the first time in a reply brief \n. . . is not only unfair to an [opponent], but also entails the risk of an improvident or ill-advised \nopinion on the legal issues tendered.\" Id. citing McBride v. Merrell Dow & Pharm., 800 F.2d \n1208, 1211 (D.C. Cir. 1986); Coates v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n117771, *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 31, 2016).     \nFirst, Mr. Jones addresses Judge Lamberth’s comment ““the maximum permissible \nadministrative delay in the overdetention context” above, and the same arguments apply here.  \nJudge Lamberth was discussing the “the maximum permissible administrative delay in \nthe overdetention context,” not the minimum delay that can give rise to an over detention claim \nunder the 5th Amendment, which is the issue in this motion to dismiss. Barnes v. District of \nColumbia, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 276. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 22 of 46\nBut more to the point, this is a procedural due process claim based on the D.C. Council’s \ncreation of a liberty interest by enacting D.C. Code § 24-211.02a(a)(2). The D.C. Council set the \nfive hour limit. Mr. Jones is not asking this Court to adopt that limit in this claim, the Council \nalready has.  \nSecond, Mr. Jones addresses the District’s objections to Mr. Jones’s alternatively pled \nallegation, FAC, ¶ 133, above, and the same arguments apply here. Anyway, the District’s \nsummary of Mr. Jones’ allegations omits words from Mr. Jones’ alternatively pled allegation and \nthe omitted words are legally significant language. Mr. Jones deserves to have his allegation \nevaluated on the merits, not on a rewritten version that omits legally significant language.  \nWhat the District wrote in its Memorandum was, ““Plaintiff alleges he was overdetained \nfor “several hours” or, in the alternative “that he was held for more than five hours.” \nWhat Mr. Jones actually pled in the alternative in the First Amended Complaint was, \n“Mr. Jones pleads in the alternative that he was held more than five hours before release after \nbeing transferred by the Marshals in the courthouse to the DOC transport officers.” FAC, ¶ 133. \nThis language tracks the language in D.C. Code § 24-211.02a(a)(2). \nMr. Jones does not allege that his over-detention in toto lasted five hours. He alleged that \nhis over-detention from the point that the R&D staff returned him to his cell lasted “several \nhours” which, drawing inferences in his favor, lasted at least five hours. \nHis alternatively pled allegation is that from the period of time from when the courtroom \nMarshals handed off custody of Mr. Jones’ “body” until the time of his eventual release from the \nDC Jail and DOC custody lasted more “than five hours.”    \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 23 of 46\nThird, as explained above, especially at the motion to dismiss stage, “[t]emporarily \nretaining custody over an inmate who is entitled to release in order to accomplish an \nadministrative task incident to that release is not per se unconstitutional.” But nor is it per se \nconstitutional. The time limit involved here was enacted by the D.C. Council and they were \nentitled to include time for out-processing but they were not obligated to. Young, 249 F.3d at \n736. Anyway, the District at this procedural posture can point to no evidence to say that the D.C. \nCouncil’s five hour deadline does not already accommodate time for “out-processing.’  \nC.  Plaintiff states a claim that the District has a custom, policy, or practice of \noverdetaining inmates and that the District is deliberately indifferent to the \nproblem. \nThe party moving for dismissal has the burden of showing that no claim has been stated. \n2-12 Moore's Federal Practice - Civil § 12.34 (2016). \nA court may not grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \"even if it strikes a \nsavvy judge that . . . recovery is very remote and unlikely.\" \"So long as the pleadings suggest a \n'plausible' scenario to 'sho[w] that the pleader is entitled to relief,' a court may not dismiss.\" \nAtherton, 567 F.3d at 681 (internal citations and punctuation omitted). \nAt the motion to dismiss stage the reviewing court must treat the complaint's factual \nallegations as true and must grant plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from \nthe facts alleged. Atherton, 567 F.3d at 677; Jones, 835 F.3d at 79; Bello v. Howard Univ., 898 \nF. Supp. 2d 213, 216 (D.D.C. 2012).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 24 of 46\nTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” \"A claim has facial \nplausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009). The plausibility standard is not akin to a “probability requirement,” but it asks \nfor more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. \nIn its discussion of the amount of factual content necessary to show “plausibility,” the \nIqbal court focused on the word “show” in Rule 8, which requires “a short and plain statement of \nthe claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” The Court stated that when “the well-\npleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the \ncomplaint has alleged—but it has not “show[n]”—that the pleader is entitled to relief.” \nAccordingly, the Court seems to be making a distinction between allegations, which merely \nestablish a possibility, and a factual “showing,” which need not establish a probability but must \nat least be sufficient to allow the court to “draw the reasonable inference” of liability. 2-8 \nMoore's Federal Practice - Civil § 8.04 (2016). \nNonetheless, \"detailed factual allegations\" are not necessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  \nMoreover, there is no heightened pleading standard in the context of the dismissal of a \nmunicipality in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 case. Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence & \nCoordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993) (heightened pleading for cases against \nmunicipalities rejected); Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 514–515 (2002). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 25 of 46\nMost cases granting a motion to dismiss a municipal liability claim against the District \ninvolve a plaintiff who pled no facts in support of the Monel claim, or no facts in support of the \nMonel claim beyond the facts of the predicate incident itself, Sheikh v. District of Columbia, 77 \nF. Supp. 3d 73, 84-85 (D.D.C. 2015), or the plaintiff omitted facts on a key element of the \ncomplaint, such as causation. Blue v. District of Columbia, 811 F.3d 14, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nThese cases are distinguishable from Mr. Jones’ First Amended Complaint because he \npled detailed sufficient facts identifying his deliberate indifference theory and showing the \nelements of the claim. \nThere are at least two 12(b)(6) decisions in which Judges of this Court have decided \nwhether plaintiffs successfully pled municipal liability on the part of the District for over-\ndetentions at the motion to dismiss stage, Barnes v. District of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. 113, 115, \n118 (D.D.C. 2007), and more recently, Page v. Mancuso, 999 F. Supp. 2d 269, 282 (D.D.C. \n2013). \nIn Barnes v. District of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. 113, 115, 118 (D.D.C. 2007) the Court \ndenied the motion to dismiss. In Page v. Mancuso the Court granted the motion to dismiss but \nthe case is disguisable from this case because plaintiff pled no facts in support of the Monel \nclaim beyond the facts of the predicate incident itself. Page v. Mancuso, 999 F. Supp. 2d 269, \n282 (D.D.C. 2013).  \nIn evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) the Court \"must first 'tak[e] note of \nthe elements a plaintiff must plead to state [the] claim' to relief, and then determine whether the \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 26 of 46\nplaintiff has pleaded those elements with adequate factual support to 'state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.'\" Blue v. District of Columbia, 811 F.3d 14, 20 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nFor his over-detention claims Mr. Jones pled a “deliberately indifferent” theory, that is,  \nThe critical question here is whether the government has failed \"to respond to a \nneed . . . in such a manner as to show 'deliberate indifference' to the risk that not \naddressing the need will result in constitutional violations.\"  The inquiry is an \nobjective one—the factfinder must ask \"whether the municipality knew or should \nhave known of the risk of constitutional violations.\"   \n \nLightfoot v. District of Columbia, 273 F.R.D. 314, 321 (D.D.C. 2011). \nMr. Jones pled detailed facts showing what his claim was and showing how the facts \nestablished the elements of his claim as follows.  \n13. For over 20 years the District has run a jail system that systemically holds \npeople past their release dates and subjects court returns entitled to release to \ndegrading and unnecessary blanket post release strip searches.  \n14. The cause of the over-detentions and illegal post release strip searches of court \nreturns entitled to release was and remains the District of Columbia's maintaining \na release system in the DOC which in toto simply delays all releases until the \nsystem, in its sweet time, and with the resources the government of the District of \nColumbia chooses provide it, is ready to make releases of inmates from DOC \nfacilities.  \n15. Regardless of the lawfulness of its release polices the District implements \nthem in a way that violates the constitutional rights of inmates. \nThe DOC with the full knowledge of the D.C. Council and the Mayor has blindly \nfollowed practices that required release dispositions to be transmitted from the \nSuperior Court to the Records Office at the DC Jail in paper format by hand in the \nfirst place, and then the District, especially the DOC, \"inefficiently implemented\" \nthe procedures in the system for transmitting orders from the courtrooms to the \nRecords Office in ways that caused significant delays and losses in the \ntransmission of the orders.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 27 of 46\n18. The DOC's determination to (1) make releases at the DC Jail or and only \noccasionally at the courthouses2, and to process releases (2) on the basis of paper \norders (as opposed to docket entries or electronically transmitted orders) (3) hand \ncarried back to the Records Office, and the \"inefficiently implemented\" \nprocedures in the system for transmitting orders added hours and sometimes days \nto the release process.  \n19. The DOC's \"inefficient implementation\" of its procedures for making releases \nadded further delay. The DOC runs a paper system for tracking cases and releases \nand misplaces jackets, misfiles orders, and runs the system manually. The \n\"inefficient implementation\" of the District's release procedures is the result of \nofficial \"acquiescence in a longstanding practice or custom which constitutes the \nstandard operation procedure of the local government entity.\" \n24. The DOC through its Records Office enforces a policy of treating court return \n(each person who leaves a DOC facility for court and returns on the same day) as \nsubject to their original commitment order if the court return returns to the Jail or \nother facility without a release order for each case on which they are being held. \n  Additionally Mr. Jones pled how the DOC operates a “Split system connected by a \n\"sneaker network\", that is, the DOC makes releases only on the basis of paper orders hand \ncarried between the courthouses and the DC Jail’s Records Office because the Jail and the \ncourthouses use separate computer systems. FAC, ¶ 39 to 59. The DOC insists on using paper \norders to make releases. FAC, ¶ 18, 40, 44, 58.  \nFurther, Mr. Jones pled: \nDespite years of knowing about the problems caused by transmitting papers \norders by hand the DOC has refused to engineer a system of electronically \ntransmitting release / commitment data from the courthouses to the Records \nOffice system. FAC, ¶ 51. \nThe District even refuses to set up a network to link the courtroom computers \nwith the Records Office so that paper orders printed out by the courtroom clerks \nwill print in the Records Office. FAC, ¶ 53. \n                                                 \n2 The allegation that the DOC “only occasionally [makes releases] at the courthouses” is factually inaccurate and \nMr. Jones through counsel withdraws this allegation. The First Amended Complaint, ¶ 42, shows that since 2008 the \nDOC has also made releases from the courthouses. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 28 of 46\nFurther, Mr. Jones pled how the DOC runs a paper system for tracking cases instead of \nusing its database for tracking inmates and their case, warrants, and detainers. FAC, ¶ 56 to 58. \nThe District's Records Office runs the system manually and frequently misplaces jackets, \nmisfiles orders, and fails to process commitments and releases reliably. FAC, ¶ 59. \nThe District’s system for handling court returns still maintains many of the same errors \nthat have plagued it for years. FAC, ¶ ¶ 60 to 104. \nAs part of the Bynum Settlement the District addressed some of these problems by \nagreeing to divert court returns entitled to release to a processing facility outside the DC Jail, the \nMedical Holding Unit or \"MHU ,\" where they could stay while the Records Office processed \ntheir entitlement to release to avoid burdening the DC Jail with the flow of court returns entitled \nto release (which affected the Records Office's capacity to process all releases) and so court \nreturns entitled to release would not have to undergo strip-searches. FAC, ¶ 72. \n   The DOC also agreed to build a new Inmate Processing Center outside the DC Jail to \nprocess releases of court returns entitled to release so they would not have to reenter the DC Jail \nfor out-processing. FAC, ¶ 73. \n    The DOC never built the Inmate Processing Center. FAC, ¶ 74. The DOC began making \ncourthouse releases and releases from MHU instead of returning all court returns back to the DC \nJail for release. FAC, ¶ 75 to 80. But, by 2013 problems with releasing court returns entitled to \nrelease from the courthouses or MHU had returned. FAC, ¶ 81.  \nMr. Jones pled a detailed analysis of how the DOC over-detained a court return entitled \nto release named Mr. Smith for over 29 days and how the problems detailed above caused the \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 29 of 46\nover-detention, and how the District’s over-detention of Mr. Smith and its response to his over-\ndetention illustrate the District’s deliberate indifference to the rights of inmates to timely \nreleases, and how these problems cause the over-detentions. FAC, ¶ 82-104.  \nThese allegations are not just a citation to a single over-detention. They “illustrates the \nproblems caused by the split system and its reliance of paper records which caused the \noverdetentions and strip-searches of Mr.Jones and the class members as well as the \nover detention and strip-search of Mr. Smith.” FAC, ¶ 82. \nMr. Jones also pled detailed allegations showing the District’s deliberate indifference to \nover-detentions. FAC, ¶ 105 to 126. He pled detailed allegations about over-detentions in the \nDOC and how they compare to over-detentions in the Los Angeles County Jail, a much larger \nsystem with relatively few over-detentions for the last two years for which figures are publically \navailable. Id. \nFinally, Mr. Jones pointed to concrete facts such as publically available figures and \ndiscussions with knowledgeable people such as CJA lawyers which show that the DOC routinely \nover-detentions prisoners including court returns entitled to release. FAC, ¶ 117 to 134. \nThese facts satisfy Mr. Jones’s pleading requirements for each of his constitutional over-\ndetention claims under Twombly and Iqbal as construed by the District of Columbia Circuit and \nthis Court. Blue v. District of Columbia, 811 F.3d 14, 20 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Lightfoot v. District \nof Columbia, 273 F.R.D. 314, 320-21 (D.D.C. 2011). \n  Mr. Jones’s well pled facts show the elements of his claim. Barnes v. District of \nColumbia, 242 F.R.D. 113, 115, 118 (D.D.C. 2007). \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 30 of 46\nHis case is thus distinguishable from Page v. Mancuso, 999 F. Supp. 2d 269, 282 (D.D.C. \n2013). In Page the only facts plaintiff pled in support of his Monel claim were the facts of the \npredicate incident itself.  \nThe District’s objections to Mr. Jones’s Monel claim. \n \n  The District’s main argument for granting its motion to dismiss on the Monel claim for \nover-detentions is that, “[t]emporarily retaining custody over an inmate who is entitled to release \nin order to accomplish an administrative task incident to that release is not per se \nunconstitutional.” Memorandum, p. 8. The arguments in opposition to Mr. Jones’s predicate 5th \nAmendment over-detention claim. Memorandum, p. 8-10. \nMr. Jones addressed these arguments in detail above. \nThe District also challenges the sufficiency of Mr. Jones’ allegations. \nThe District says, “The Complaint does not provide any factual allegations which, if true, \ncould prove the District had actual or constructive knowledge that plaintiff’s constitutional rights \nwould be violated if he was returned to the jail while DOC processed his release.” Memorandum, \np. 12. Au contraire. Mr. Jones pled that the problems with over-detaining court returns entitled to \nrelease have been known to the District for almost 20 years in the Bynum and Barnes cases and \nthrough its knowledge of over-detentions and its knowledge of the DOC’s release practices. \nMr. Jones allegations cited above show that the District’s antiquated paper driven release \nsystem and the other problems he identified are the moving force behind Mr. Jones’s over-\ndetention and the over-detentions of the other class members.    \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 31 of 46\nThe reviewing court should construe a plaintiff’s allegations liberally, because the rules \nrequire only general or “notice” pleading, rather than detailed fact pleading. For example, \nprovided that a pleading states a claim for relief under the plausibility standard, it is not \nnecessary for the pleading to also rebut other possible explanations for the conduct alleged, even \nif those alternatives might appear to be more likely. Jones v. Kirchner, 835 F.3d at 79–80 \n(plaintiff stated plausible Fourth Amendment claim for failure to knock-and-announce by \npleading that he did not hear any knock or announcement; not necessary to plead additional facts \nto rebut possibility that knock-and-announce occurred, but was simply not heard by plaintiff). \nII.  Mr. Jones states a common law over-detention claim. \nMr. Jones states a common law over-detention claim for false imprisonment in the \nsubstantive allegations of Claim 3. \nIn the heading to Mr. Jones’ Claim 3 he mistakenly refers to the claim as “false arrest.” \nBut, the operative language of the claim states, “The District of Columbia, and its agents and \nemployees, held Mr. Jones and the over-detention class members past the time they were entitled \nto release.” FAC, ¶ 166. \nOmitting or misstating the legal theory for a claim is inconsequential to whether the \npleading states a claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6) provided that the factual allegations \nunderlying a claim are sufficient under the plausibility standard of Twombly and Iqbal. 2-12 \nMoore's Federal Practice - Civil § 12.34 (2016); Johnson v. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. —, 135 S. \nCt. 346, 190 L. Ed. 2d 309, 309 (2014) (per curiam) (federal pleading rules “do not countenance \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 32 of 46\ndismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim \nasserted”); Brown v. Sessoms, 774 F.3d 1016, 1022 (2014). \nA complaint need not point to the appropriate statute or law to raise a claim for relief; a \ncomplaint sufficiently states a claim even if it points to no legal theory or even if it points to the \nwrong legal theory, as long as “relief is possible under any set of facts that could be established \nconsistent with the allegations.” Tolle v. Carroll Touch, Inc., 977 F.2d 1129, 1134 (7th Cir. \n1992). \nThe District ignores the language of the operative allegations and focuses on the heading. \nMemorandum, pgs. 16-17. But, “The defendant had notice of the claims against it because the \nplaintiffs \"stated simply, concisely, and directly events that, they alleged, entitled them to \ndamages from the city.\"” Brown v. Sessoms, 774 F.3d 1016, 1022 (2014).             \nThe District then argues that, “Simply put, there are no factual allegations anywhere in \nthe Complaint to support a false arrest claim.” Memorandum, p. 17. Plaintiffs do not concede \nthat when the DOC transport officers laid hands on Mr. Jones and they took custody of him from \nthe courtroom Marshals they did not effect a common law arrest. See e.g., Barnes, 242 F.R.D. at \n118 (plaintiffs’ allegations of Fourth Amendment violations are sufficient to survive a motion to \ndismiss). \nBut, a more elegant solution to this claim is to analyze it under the substantive allegations \nof the claim rather than the style of the claim. FAC, ¶ 166. \nThere are allegations in Claim 3 that support a claim for false imprisonment under both \ngeneral common law principles and the District of Columbia common law. FAC, ¶ 166. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 33 of 46\n1.  The common law elements of the tort of false imprisonment. \nThe sort of unlawful detention remediable by the tort of false imprisonment is \ndetention without legal process. Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 389 (2007). \nThe District contends that “The elements of a common law false arrest claim and a \nconstitutional false arrest claim are practically identical.” Memorandum, p. 16. This is not a \ncareful statement of the law of false imprisonment in the District of Columbia under the facts of \nthis case – there are “refinement[s] to be considered, arising from the common law's distinctive \ntreatment of the torts of false arrest and false imprisonment.” Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 388 \n(2007). \nAt common law, although false arrest and false imprisonment overlap, nonetheless false \narrest and false imprisonment are two distinctive torts. Wallace, 549 U.S. at 388. The former is a \nspecies of the latter. Id. \"Every confinement of the person is an imprisonment, whether it be in a \ncommon prison or in a private house, or in the stocks, or even by forcibly detaining one in the \npublic streets; and when a man is lawfully in a house, it is imprisonment to prevent him from \nleaving the room in which he is.\" Wallace, 549 U.S. at 388-89. Recently the Supreme Court \nchanged the law stated in Wallace v. Kato with respect to whether an arrestee may challenge his \npretrial detention on Fourth Amendment grounds holding that the Fourth Amendment governs \nunlawful pretrial detention claims even after legal process begins. Manuel v. City of Joliet, 137 \nS. Ct. 911 (2017). But, the case does not affect the Court’s observations in Wallace v. Kato about \nfalse imprisonment. \nThe Restatement of Torts, 2d, also defines the tort of false imprisonment this way:  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 34 of 46\n (1)  An actor is subject to liability to another for false imprisonment if \n(a)  he acts intending to confine the other or a third person within boundaries fixed by the \nactor, and \n(b)  his act directly or indirectly results in such a confinement of the other, and \n(c)  the other is conscious of the confinement or is harmed by it. \n \n(2)  An act which is not done with the intention stated in Subsection (1, a) does not make \nthe actor liable to the other for a merely transitory or otherwise harmless confinement, \nalthough the act involves an unreasonable risk of imposing it and therefore would be \nnegligent or reckless if the risk threatened bodily harm. \n \nRestat 2d of Torts, § 35 (2nd 1979). \nUnder the Restatement, malice is not an element of the tort of false imprisonment. “If an \nact which causes another's confinement is done with the intention of causing the confinement, \nthe actor is subject to liability although his act is not inspired by personal hostility or desire to \noffend.” Restat 2d of Torts, § 44 (2nd 1979). \n2.  The District of Columbia common law elements of the tort of false \nimprisonment. \nThe only two elements of the tort of false imprisonment under the common law of the \nDistrict of Columbia \"are (1) the detention or restraint of one against his will, within boundaries \nfixed by the defendant, and (2) the unlawfulness of the restraint.\" Faniel v. Chesapeake & \nPotomac Tel. Co., 404 A.2d 147, 150 (D.C. 1979)(false imprisonment is ''the restraint by one \nperson of the physical liberty of another without consent or legal justification.\"). \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 35 of 46\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals has held that “we are satisfied that neither \nmalice nor wrongful intent are controlling considerations in an action for false arrest or false \nimprisonment, and that such allegations, insofar as they refer to false arrest or false \nimprisonment, are mere surplusage.” Clarke v. District of Columbia, 311 A.2d 508, 511 (D.C. \n1973). \nThe DOC corrections officers held Mr. Jones in their custody and in the DC Jail after a \nDistrict Court Judge ordered his release, see FAC, ¶ 166, and this conduct constituted false \nimprisonment under the common law of the District of Columbia. Faniel, 404 A.2d at 150. Mr. \nJones is not required to plead or prove the element of malice. Clarke, 311 A.2d at 511.  \n3.  The District is liable for the conduct of its agents in falsely imprisoning Mr. \nJones because of the doctrine of respondeat superior.   \nThe District is liable for the conduct of its agents in falsely imprisoning Mr. Jones \nbecause of the doctrine of respondeat superior. The District of Columbia may be sued under the \ncommon law doctrine of respondeat superior even for the intentional torts of its employees \nacting within the scope of their employment. Wade v. District of Columbia, 310 A.2d 857, 863 \n(D.C. 1973) (en banc). Mr. Jones pled that the District’s agents were acting within the scope of \ntheir employment at all times, FAC, ¶ 167, and that their conduct was the proximate cause of his \nand the other class members’ injuries. FAC, ¶ 169.    \nIII.  The Strip-Searches Violated the 4th and 5th Amendments.  \n\"[I]n considering whether a plaintiff has stated a claim for municipal liability, the district \ncourt must conduct a two-step inquiry. First, the court must determine whether the complaint \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 36 of 46\nstates a claim for a predicate constitutional violation. Second, if so, then the court must \ndetermine whether the complaint states a claim that a custom or policy of the municipality \ncaused the violation.\" Sheikh, 77 F. Supp. 3d at 84 citing Baker v. District of Columbia, 326 \nF.3d 1302, 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  \nMr. Jones satisfies both of these steps as described below for both of his Constitutional strip-\nsearch claims. Bame v. Dillard, 637 F.3d 380, 384 (D.C. Cir. 2011) is not relevant to the case \nbecause it is a qualified immunity decision and the Bame Court held that the constitutional right \nwas not clearly established without reaching the question of “whether in fact there is such a \nright.\" In a similar case Judge Rogers concurred writing, “I write principally because this court, \nas in ten other circuits, should \"clearly establish[]\" that indiscriminate strip searching of \nindividuals awaiting presentment on non-violent, non-drug offenses who are not held in the \ngeneral population is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution in the absence of reasonable suspicion an individual possesses contraband or \nweapons. Johnson v. Gov't of the Dist. of Columbia, 734 F.3d 1194, 1205 (2013)(Rogers, J. \nconcurring)(internal citation omitted). \nA key fact is that instead of returning Mr. Jones to the DC Jail the DOC could have released \nhim from the courthouse or diverted him to MHU where court returns are not strip-searched. \nFAC, ¶ 35; ¶ 37, ¶ 146. \n1.  There are two ways to analyze the strip-search claim, as court return strip-\nsearches or under the Florence exception.   \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 37 of 46\nThere are two ways to analyze the strip-search claim, as court return strip-searches under \nBynum and Barnes or under the Florence exception.  And both ways compel the conclusion that \nthe DOC strip-search policy of strip-searching all prisoners who enter the DC Jail whether they \nhave been ordered released violates the Constitutional rights of Mr. Jones and the other class \nmembers.  \nDOC transport officers transported Mr. Jones and the other class members ordered \nreleased at their court hearings back to the DC Jail for out-processing in the DC Jail or CTF \ninstead of releasing them at the courthouse or diverting them to the “MHU” (the Medical \nHolding Unit of the DC Jail), the DOC facility set up by the DOC pursuant to the Bynum \nSettlement to hold court returns ordered released at their court hearings while the DOC \nadministratively processes their release from DOC custody. FAC, ¶ FAC, ¶ 33-34. Mr. Jones and \nother members of the class along with all persons booked at the DC Jail are subjected to \ndegrading and humiliating blanket (i.e., “suspicionless” strip-searches administered to all \nintakes) strip searches conducted in the R&D (Receiving and Discharge) areas as part of the \nbooking process. FAC, ¶ 35. Persons detained in MHU are not subjected to blanket strip-\nsearches. FAC, ¶ 41. 1. \nSuspicionless strip-searches violate the 4th Amendment. A strip-search must be \nreasonable under the 4th Amendment. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979); Barnes v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 793 F. Supp. 2d 260, 287 (D.D.C. 2011). Bell v. Wolfish articulated a test \nfor constitutionality of strip searches as a balance between the necessity for the particular search \nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entailed. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. This test \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 38 of 46\nrequires courts to weigh “the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.” Id.  \nThis Court found on a full record at summary judgment that there is no penological \njustification for subjecting court returns entitled to release to blanket strip-searches. Barnes, 793 \nF. Supp. 2d at 289. Moreover,  \nthe strip search class members are subjected to strip searches solely due to the fact \nthat the DOC has made the unfortunate choice to bring them back into the general \ninmate population while the Records Office processes their releases, rather than \ntemporarily housing them apart from that population. That choice creates the \nsecurity problem that the DOC's strip searches are designed to solve. \nId. \n2.  Court return strip-searches.     \nThese searches are the same court return strip-searches this Court held violated the 4th \nAmendment in Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 290. The strip-search plaintiffs in Barnes were persons \nheld pretrial in the DC Jail or CTF who had gone from the DC Jail or CTF to Superior Court or \nDistrict Court for court events, been ordered released or had otherwise become entitled to release \n(e.g., their cases were dismissed by the prosecutor) and returned to the DC Jail and subjected to \nthe intake strip-searches while their releases were being processed. Thus, this Court held that the \ncase was distinguishable from the intake strip-searches of pre-presentment arrestees held in a jail \npending presentment. “The assumption in those cases is that jails are processing new inmates \ninto the general population, and have determined that maintaining adequate security in that \npopulation requires a policy of blanket strip searches.” Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 289.    \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 39 of 46\nThe Barnes Court applied the Bell balancing test to the court return strip-searches and \nfound that the strip-searches were not justified by a security need and so they violated the 4th \nAmendment.        \nThe invasions in this case are particularly suspect given that they are happening to \npersons who are no longer prisoners in the eyes of the law, who are not individually suspected of \ncarrying contraband, and who are entitled to a restoration of the rights they enjoyed prior to their \nimprisonment. And the DOC's invasion of their personal rights is balanced against nothing, \nbecause the DOC's blanket strip searches of court returns entitled to release are needless, a \nproduct of the DOC's insistence on maintaining a policy that subjects free men and women to \ndegrading treatment when reasonable alternatives such as courthouse release and MHU are \nreadily available. Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 290.  \nAs Judge Feinerman of the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, wondered in a \nsimilar court return over-detention/ strip-search case, “why send an unescorted free man into the \ngeneral population of Cook County Jail?” Shultz v. Dart, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156546, at *9 \n(N.D. Ill. Oct. 31, 2013).   \nMr. Jones was in the exact same position as the Barnes strip-search plaintiffs. He was not \nheld on the basis of probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe that an offense had been \ncommitted and he had committed it. The opposite in fact was true – a judicial officer had ordered \nhis release.  \nThe mere possibility that another warrant was in existence does not qualify as a \nparticularized suspicion justifying the DOC strip-search policy, Jones v. Cochran, 1994 U.S. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 40 of 46\nDist. LEXIS 20625 (S.D. Fla. 1994), when reasonable alternatives such as courthouse release \nand MHU are readily available. Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 290.  \nBut, to add insult to injury to their over-detentions, instead of holding them in the MHU \nor some other “readily available” reasonable alternative place where they would not be strip-\nsearched, the government put them back in DC Jail or CTF where they were sure to be strip-\nsearched because of the policy of strip-searching all intakes into the DC Jail’s intake center, \nR&D.  \n3.  Intake strip-searches under the “Florence exception.”      \nThe strip searches in this case could also be analyzed under the “Florence exception” of \nFlorence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, 132 S. Ct. 1510 (2012) because Mr. Jones and the other \nclass members were in the position of arrestees arrested on minor offenses who were still \nawaiting their probable cause hearings, because they had actually been ordered released, and so \nthere was no probable cause or suspicion to hold them on any offense.     \nIn Florence the Supreme Court addressed the case of a person arrested on a warrant and \nstrip-searched before being placed in the general population sections of two jails which did not \nhave any place to hold people outside the general population. However, the Court’s following \nstatement  in the majority opinion is key to determining the outcome of this motion to dismiss:  \nThe circumstances before the Court, however, do not present the opportunity to \nconsider a narrow exception of the sort … which might restrict whether an \narrestee whose detention has not yet been reviewed by a magistrate or other \njudicial officer, and who can be held in available facilities removed from the \ngeneral population, may be subjected to the types of searches at issue here.   \nFlorence, 132 S. Ct. at 1523. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 41 of 46\nConcurring, Justice Alito emphasized the limits of the Court's holding and wrote that, for \nminor offenders, \"admission to the general jail population, with the concomitant humiliation of a \nstrip search, may not be reasonable, particularly if an alternative procedure is feasible.\" Id. at \n1524 (Alito, J., concurring). \nAs Judge Walton of this Court recently pointed out,  \nOne member of this Circuit has afforded particular weight to \nthe exceptions articulated in Florence, remarking that \"six Justices of the Supreme \nCourt have expressed unease with the type of indiscriminate strip searching . . . \nthat is challenged here.\" Johnson v. District of Columbia, 734 F.3d 1194, 1206, \n407 U.S. App. D.C. 152 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Rogers, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment) (challenge to District of Columbia Superior Court \ncellblock's policy of subjecting \"all incoming detainees\" to strip search, including \n\"pre-presentment arrestees charged with nonviolent, non-drug offenses\"). \nLewis v. Gov't of the Dist. of Columbia, 195 F. Supp. 3d 53, 64 (D.D.C. 2016). \nIn Lewis, plaintiffs were arrestees who were presented in Superior Court for their initial \nappearances on minor offenses who had been ordered held on 24 hour “Gerstein Perfection” \nholds because the “Gersteins” (arresting officer’s sworn probable cause statements) the \ngovernment offered to justify their arrests did not establish probable cause. Lewis, 195 F. Supp. \n3d at 56-57. The DOC transported them to the DC Jail and housed them there instead of \nreturning them to Central Cell Block (where they had been held pending presentment). As a \nresult, plaintiffs were subjected to the same degrading strip-searches to which the DOC subjected \nMr. Jones when they were committed to the DC Jail. \nPlaintiffs alleged that the “Florence exception” applied to their strip-search claims \nbecause the Superior Court judicial officers who ordered them held had effectively affirmatively \nmade findings of no probable cause in their cases by finding that the “Gersteins” did not \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 42 of 46\nestablish probable cause, and there were alternatives to holding them in the general population of \nthe DC Jail. Although Judge Walton questioned this characterization of the judicial officer's \nrulings, Judge Walton did rule that no affirmative findings of probable cause were made during \nthe plaintiffs' initial appearances. Lewis, 195 F. Supp. 3d at 65 n.8. \nJudge Walton ruled that the “Florence exception” applied because there was no finding of \nprobable cause and “there were other readily available facilities removed from the general \npopulation of the DC Jail in which [the plaintiffs] could have been held.\" Lewis, 195 F. Supp. 3d \nat 64-65.   \nOther Courts have reached the same result. See e.g., Holland v. City of San Francisco, \n2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34294, *22 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 11, 2013)(after Florence, a strip search of a \ndetainee charged with a minor offense who has not yet appeared before a magistrate is \npermissible if: (1) the detainee cannot be held apart from the general jail population; or (2) the \nofficer directing the search has a reasonable, individualized suspicion that the arrestee is carrying \ncontraband).    \nThus Claim 3 falls into the exception in Florence and into the class of cases Justice Alito \nhad in mind when he stated in his concurring opinion, in pertinent part, “the Court does not hold \nthat it is always reasonable to conduct a full strip search of an arrestee whose detention has not \nbeen fully reviewed by a judicial officer and who could be held in available facilities apart from \nthe general population.” Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1524, Alito, J.; Holland, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n34294, *22, concurring (emphasis in original). In fact this case is even stronger than the \n“Florence exception” because whereas the “Florence exception” has two elements: (1) the \narrestee’s detention has not yet been reviewed by a judicial officer, and (2) the arrestee can be \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 43 of 46\nheld apart from the general population,” Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1523 (emphasis in original), in \nthis case the judicial officer ordered the person’s release, and the arrestees could have been \nreleased at the cthe or sent to MHU. In fact, many of the class members were, like Mr. Jones, \nreleased the same day or the next day still without a finding of probable cause by a judicial \nofficer.    \n4.  Strip-searches violate the 5th Amendment. \nMr. Jones’s also states a 5th Amendment claim for the strip-searches at the motion to \ndismiss stage. Velarde v. Cnty. of Alameda, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53110, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Apr. \n20, 2016). \n5.  Mr. Jones states a Monel claim on the strip-searches because the DOC \nconducted the strip-searches pursuant to an official DOC policy. \nMr. Jones states a Monel claim on the strip-searches because the DOC conduced the \nstrip-searches pursuant to an official DOC policy. Mr. Jones pled that the DOC implemented the \nstrip-searches pursuant to an official DOC policy. FAC, ¶ 160-163. Because that policy was \npromulgated by an official with final authority to establish such policies for the District and \ncaused plaintiffs' and class members' constitutional deprivations, the District is liable. Barnes, \n793 F. Supp. 2d at 291. \nMonell established that alleging that a municipal policy or ordinance is itself \nunconstitutional is always sufficient to establish the necessary causal connection between the \nmunicipality and the constitutional deprivation, because an employee's act of enforcing an \nunconstitutional municipal policy may be considered the act of the municipality itself. Monell v. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 44 of 46\nDep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978); Amnesty Am. v. Town of W. Hartford, 361 F.3d \n113, 125 (2d Cir. 2004).  \nIV.  Mr. Jones States a Claim on His Invasion of Privacy Claim for the District’s Strip-\nSearch Policy. \nMr. Jones’ Claim 5 states a claim on his invasion of privacy claim under the common law \nof the District of Columbia. Helton v. United States, 191 F. Supp. 2d 179, 180 (D.D.C. 2002).   \nThe Helton plaintiffs were five women who were arrested for unlawful entry in \nconnection with an \"anti-fur\" demonstration at the Neiman Marcus store at Mazza Gallerie Mall \nand subjected to intake “strip and squat searches” in the cellblock at the District of Columbia \nSuperior Court where they were brought for initial appearances. Helton, 191 F. Supp. 2d at 180. \nThe women brought an FTCA claim against the United States. The government moved to \ndismiss. \nJudge Bates analyzed plaintiffs’ claims under the District of Columbia common law \n\"intrusion upon seclusion\" prong of the invasion of privacy tort under Wolf v. Regardie, 553 \nA.2d 1213, 1216-17 (D.C. 1989). Helton, 191 F. Supp. 2d at 181. \n[The Court] concludes that under District of Columbia law plaintiffs have stated a \nclaim for intrusion upon seclusion based on their allegations of a strip and \nsquat search ordered by the Marshals Service. Particularly in light of Section \n652B of the Restatement, specifically relied upon by the court in Wolf, this Court \nconcludes that the District of Columbia courts would find that the \nalleged strip search of plaintiffs satisfies the elements of the tort of an intrusion \nupon seclusion. \n \nHelton, 191 F. Supp. 2d at 182. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 18   Filed 05/03/17   Page 45 of 46\nJudge Bates held that plaintiffs could show that the alleged strip and \nsquat search conducted by the Marshals Service visually invaded or interfered with their \n\"interest\" in remaining clothed and shielding their naked bodies from others where plaintiffs \nhave secluded their naked bodies within their clothes and it was clear that a strip search can be \nhumiliating and degrading. Helton, 191 F. Supp. 2d at 182. Cf. District’s Memorandum, p. 17.    \nThe District is liable for the conduct of its agents in strip-searching Mr. Jones because of \nthe doctrine of respondeat superior. The District of Columbia may be sued under the common \nlaw doctrine of respondeat superior even for the intentional torts of its employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment. Wade, 310 A.2d at 863. Mr. Jones pled that the District’s agents \nwere acting within the scope of their employment at all times, and that their conduct was the \nproximate cause of his and the other class members’ injuries. FAC, ¶¶ 173-74. \nThe District contends that this claim fails because “plaintiff failed to even allege that the \nstrip search was offensive to him.” Memorandum, p. 17. Wrong. Mr. Jones described the strip-\nsearch in detail and pled that “suffered damages as a result” of the strip-search. FAC, ¶ 135-145. \nRelief Requested. \nFor the reasons stated above the District’s Motion [17] to Dismiss Plaintiff’s First \nAmended Complaint [12] should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted,  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n/s/ William Claiborne  /s/ Lynn E.

Civil Action No. 16-cv-2405 (DLF) \n \nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, \n \n  Defendant. \n \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n  The plaintiff Richard Jones asserts several claims against the District of Columbia \nstemming from his alleged overdetention and strip search.  Before the Court is the District’s \nMotion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  For the reasons discussed \nbelow, the Court grants in part and denies in part the District’s motion to dismiss.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nOn December 7, 2015, Jones attended a hearing at the federal courthouse and was \nordered released from the custody of the Department of Corrections.  First Amended Compl. ¶¶ \n128, 129, 135, Dkt. 12.  Following the hearing, the Marshals transferred Jones to Department of \nCorrections staff who then transported Jones to the D.C. Jail.  Id.  At the D.C. Jail, Jones \nallegedly told the receiving and discharge staff that he had been ordered released, but the staff \ncould not find a release order. Id. ¶¶ 130, 131.  Thus, staff subjected Jones to a strip-search and \nreturned him to his cell in the general population.  Id. ¶¶ 130, 131, 137.  Jones alleges that he was \nheld in the D.C. Jail for several hours.  Id. ¶¶ 132.  In the alternative, Jones alleges that he was \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 26   Filed 08/22/18   Page 2 of 10\nheld more than five hours from the moment the Marshals transferred him to the Department of \nCorrections transport officers at the federal courthouse.  Id. ¶ 133. \nJones further alleges that the Department of Corrections “routinely” and “systematically” \nholds detainees past their release times.  Id. ¶¶ 13, 117.  In particular, Jones claims that the \nDepartment of Corrections’ practice of not releasing inmates until it obtains inmates’ paper \nrelease dispositions leads to the unconstitutional overdetention of individuals who have been \nordered released.  Id. ¶ 41.  Jones also contends that the Department of Corrections “does not \nreliably” follow its own policy that requires transporting defendants who have been ordered \nreleased to D.C. General Hospital where they are not subjected to strip searches, absent \nindividualized suspicion.  Id. ¶ 37. \nJones asserts constitutional claims based on his overdetention and strip search.  \nAdditionally, he asserts common law claims for false arrest and invasion of privacy.  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD(S) \nIn evaluating a motion to dismiss, the Court must treat the complaint’s “factual \nallegations as true and must grant the plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be derived \nfrom the facts alleged.”  Center for Responsible Science v. Gottlieb, 311 F. Supp. 3d 5, 8 (D.D.C. \n2018) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  “The Court need not accept as true, \nhowever, a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation, nor an inference unsupported by the \nfacts set forth in the Complaint.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “A claim has facial plausibility when \nthe plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 26   Filed 08/22/18   Page 3 of 10\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.  Id. (internal citation omitted).  A “complaint \nattacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations.”  Bell \nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  But the factual allegations in the \ncomplaint “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Id.  \nHere, Jones attempts to state several claims for municipal liability.  To determine whether \nJones has stated a claim, the Court must conduct a two-step inquiry: “First, the court must \ndetermine whether the complaint states a claim for a predicate constitutional violation.  Second, \nif so, then the court must determine whether the complaint states a claim that a custom or policy \nof the municipality caused the violation.”  Baker v. District of Columbia, 326 F.3d 1302, 1306 \n(D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted).  \nIII.  ANALYSIS \n  Jones argues that his overdetention and strip search violated his Fourth and Fifth \nAmendment rights.1   He also asserts common law claims for false arrest and invasion of privacy.   \nA.  Constitutional Claims Stemming from Jones’s Overdetention  \nJones first argues that his overdetention constituted an unreasonable seizure under the \nFourth Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment guarantees the “right of the people to be secure in \ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”  U.S. \nConst. amend. IV.  “A seizure triggering the Fourth Amendment’s protections occurs when a \nperson’s freedom of movement is terminated or restrained, either by physical force or a show of \nauthority.”  See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 793 F. Supp. 2d 260, 273-74 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, Jones was already in custody when he was ordered \n                                                 \n1 In the motion to dismiss, the District argues that Jones has failed to state a claim sufficient to establish an \nEighth Amendment violation.  Jones clarified in his opposition that he did “not plead an Eighth Amendment \nover-detention claim in the First Amended Complaint.”  Pl.’s Opp’n at 1, n.1, Dkt. 18. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 26   Filed 08/22/18   Page 4 of 10\nreleased.  In other words, Jones’s “freedom of movement had already been terminated.”  Id. \n(internal citations omitted).  And Jones did not allege or provide any factual support in his \ncomplaint suggesting that his overdetention involved a fresh seizure, which would warrant a \nFourth Amendment analysis.  See id.  Moreover, “[m]ost courts that have considered \noverdetention claims have agreed that they are properly channeled through the Due Process \nClause” of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.”  Barnes v. District of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. \n113, 118 (D.D.C. 2007).  For these reasons, the Court will grant the District’s motion to dismiss \nas to Jones’s claim that his overdetention constituted an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth \nAmendment. \nJones next argues that his overdetention violated his substantive due process right under \nthe Fifth Amendment.2  The “doctrine of substantive due process constrains only egregious \ngovernment misconduct” and prevents “only grave unfairness.”  George Washington University \nv. District of Columbia, 318 F.3d 203, 209 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nA plaintiff can show grave unfairness in two ways. The plaintiff can either show that there was \n(i) “a substantial infringement of state law prompted by personal or group animus, or (ii) “a \ndeliberate flouting of the law that trammel[ed] significant personal or property rights.”  Id. \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   \nAn overdetention of the kind that Jones alleges potentially violates “the substantive \ncomponent of the Due Process Clause by infringing upon an individual’s basic liberty interest in \nbeing free from incarceration absent a criminal conviction.”  Barnes v. District of Columbia, 793 \n                                                 \n2 Jones asserts that he has stated “a claim for a predicate constitutional violation of his procedural due \nprocess claim.”  Pl.’s Opp’n at 19, Dkt. 18.  But Jones does not identify any specific procedure that he \nshould have received, and he characterizes the District’s violation as an infringement of his “liberty \ninterest.”  That language suggests that substantive due process protections are a better fit for Jones’s Fifth \nAmendment claim. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 26   Filed 08/22/18   Page 5 of 10\nF. Supp. 2d 260, 274-75 (D.D.C. 2011) (internal citation omitted).  But temporarily “retaining \ncustody over an inmate who is entitled to release in order to accomplish administrative tasks \nincident to that release is not per se unconstitutional.”  Id. at 275 (internal citation omitted).  \nThere is no established “bright-line rule for the maximum permissible delay in the overdetention \ncontext.”  Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 275 (internal citation omitted).  Nonetheless, “courts \nappear to agree that the maximum permissible administrative delay in the overdetention context \nlikely falls well short of the 48-hour horizon set out” for detentions pending probable cause \ndeterminations after warrantless arrests.”  Id. at 276 (internal citations omitted). \nHere, the District asks the Court to decide that certain delays, at least those for only a few \nhours, are per se reasonable.  “Yet it remains the case that courts have not settled on any concrete \nnumber of permissible hours of delay in the context of post-release detentions.”  Barnes v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 242 F.R.D. 113, 117 (D.D.C. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nIndeed, “the great weight of precedent suggests that release must occur within a matter of hours \nafter the right to it accrues, and that after some period of hours – not days – a presumption of \nunreasonableness, and thus unconstitutionality, will set in.”  Id.  At the motion to dismiss stage, \nthe Court cannot say that an overdetention lasting more than five hours is per se constitutional.  \nJones has, therefore, stated a claim for a predicate constitutional violation. \nTo state a claim for municipal liability, Jones also must state a claim that a custom or \npolicy of the municipality caused the predicate constitutional violation.  Jones’s complaint also \nsatisfies that burden.  “There are four basic categories of municipal action” that Jones “may rely \non to establish municipal liability: (1) express municipal policy; (2) adoption by municipal \npolicymakers; (3) custom or usage; and (4) deliberate indifference.”  Hunter v. District of \nColumbia, 824 F. Supp. 2d 125, 133 (D.D.C. 2011).  Jones identifies a practice or custom that \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 26   Filed 08/22/18   Page 6 of 10\nled to his overdetention: he argues that the “cause of the over-detentions and illegal post release \nstrip searches of court returns entitled to release was and remains the District of Columbia’s \nmaintaining a release system in the” Department of Corrections that “delays all releases.”  \nCompl. ¶ 14, Dkt. 12.  Specifically, Jones alleges that the Department of Corrections “runs a \npaper system for tracking cases and releases and misplaces jackets, misfiles orders, and runs the \nsystem manually.  The inefficient implementation of the District’s release procedures is the result \nof official acquiescence in a longstanding practice or custom which constitutes the standard” \noperating procedure of the District.  Id. ¶ 19.   \nIn short, Jones has stated a claim that the District’s release-processing system delays the \nrelease of individuals and leads to overdetention.  Accordingly, the Court denies the District’s \nmotion to dismiss as to Jones’s claim that his overdetention violated his rights under the Fifth \nAmendment.   \nB.  Constitutional Claims Stemming from Jones’s Strip Search \nNext, Jones argues that the strip search conducted before Jones was returned to his cell \nviolated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.   \nAccording to Jones, strip searching an inmate who has been ordered released before \nreturning that inmate to the general population violates the Fourth Amendment unless the \ncorrections officials have individualized, reasonable suspicion to search the inmate.  That \nargument is belied by D.C. Circuit and Supreme Court precedent.   \nIn Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court established a balancing test for courts to use when \nevaluating the reasonableness of inmate searches:  Courts must balance “the need for the \nparticular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.”  441 U.S. 520, \n559 (1979).  “Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.”  Id.  The D.C. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 26   Filed 08/22/18   Page 7 of 10\nCircuit has concluded that “nothing in Bell requires individualized, reasonable suspicion before \nstrip searching a person entering a detention facility.”  Bame v. Dillard, 637 F.3d 380, 386 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  And indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that “correctional officials must be \npermitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect and deter the possession of contraband in \ntheir facilities.”  Florence v. Bd. Of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 566 U.S. 318, 328 \n(2012).  The Supreme Court has even recognized the importance of allowing across-the-board \nsearches because “deterring the possession of contraband depends in part on the ability to \nconduct searches without predictable exceptions.”  Id. at 327-28.  The Supreme Court concluded \nthat prison officials have “a substantial interest in preventing any new inmate . . . from putting all \nwho live or work at these institutions at even greater risk when he is admitted to the general \npopulation.”  Id. at 333-34. \nHere, the District does not argue that it had individualized, reasonable suspicion to search \nJones.  Instead, the District argues that whenever a prisoner enters “the general population from \nthe outside” prison officials need to conduct a search to bar “potential contraband from entry into \nthe prison population.”  Def’s Mot. at 16, Dkt. 17.  The Supreme Court recognized that rationale \nas legitimate: prison officials have “a substantial interest in preventing any new inmate . . . from \nputting all who live or work at these institutions at even greater risk when he is admitted to the \ngeneral population.”  Florence, 566 U.S. at 333-34.  Prison officials do not need individualized \nreasonable suspicion to conduct a routine search before placing an inmate into the prison \npopulation.   \nJoints argues that this Court should follow the approach adopted in Barnes v. District of \nColumbia.  In Barnes, the plaintiffs also challenged the strip search policy of the District.  There, \nthe district court denied the District’s motion to dismiss.  See 242 F.R.D. 113 (D.D.C. 2007).  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 26   Filed 08/22/18   Page 8 of 10\nLater, the district court granted the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment because “the utter \nlack of a reasonable justification for the blanket strip searches of court returns” mandated a \nfinding that the “blanket strip search policy, as applied to court returns entitled to release, is \nunreasonable and violates the Fourth Amendment.”  Barnes v. District of Columbia, 793 F. \nSupp. 2d 260, 290 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  But here, the District has offered a justification for the \nsearch by arguing that strip searches of individuals who are going to join the prison population \nare necessary to bar contraband from entry into the prison.  More importantly, Barnes was \ndecided before the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit clarified the standards that govern inmate \nsearches.  See Florence, 566 U.S. 318; Bame, 637 F.3d 380.  Those later cases make clear that \nprison officials generally do not need individualized, reasonable suspicion to search individuals \nbefore they join the prison population. \nMoreover, even if Jones were correct that the strip search violated his rights under the \nFourth Amendment, Jones has not alleged that a custom or policy of the District caused the strip \nsearch.  In fact, Jones alleges that the District’s official policy is to divert defendants that have \nbeen ordered released “to a holding facility on the grounds of DC General Hospital . . . where \nthey would not be subject to a strip search, absent individualized suspicion.”  Compl. ¶ 35, Dkt. \n12.  Jones, therefore, has not alleged that an express policy or a custom or practice led to his strip \nsearch.  Thus, the Court grants the District’s motion to dismiss as to Jones’s claim that the strip \nsearch violated the Fourth Amendment.  \nJones’s Fifth Amendment claim also fails:  “Where a particular Amendment provides an \nexplicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of governmental \nbehavior, that Amendment, not the generalized notion of substantive due process, must be the \nguide for analyzing these claims.”  Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266 (1994).  The Fourth \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 26   Filed 08/22/18   Page 9 of 10\nAmendment is the explicit textual source of constitutional protection against unreasonable \nsearches.  Therefore, the Court grants the District’s Motion to Dismiss as to the plaintiff’s claim \nthat the strip search violated his Fifth Amendment rights.  \nC.  Common Law Claims  \nFinally, Jones argues that his overdetention and strip search violated the common law \ntorts of false arrest and invasion of privacy.  \nFirst, Jones argues that his overdetention constituted false arrest or false imprisonment.3  \n“The gist of any complaint for false arrest or false imprisonment is an unlawful detention.”  \nDingle v. District of Columbia, 571 F. Supp. 2d 87, 95 (D.D.C. 2008).  “In order to support a \nviable claim of false arrest, a plaintiff must allege that he was unlawfully detained.”  Dingle, 571 \nF. Supp. at 95.  The common law “cause of action for false arrest is essentially identical to a \ncause of action for false arrest under the Fourth Amendment.”  Maldonado v. District of \nColumbia, 924 F. Supp. 2d 323, 330 n.6 (D.D.C. 2013).  Therefore, the Court analyzes Jones’s \ncommon law claim in much the same way as it analyzes Jones’s Fourth Amendment claim.  \nJones’s Complaint does not contain allegations that he was newly arrested after the court ordered \nJones’s release.  Therefore, the Court grants the District’s motion to dismiss as to Jones’s claim \nfor false imprisonment or false arrest.  \nSecond, Jones argues that his strip search violated his “common law right to privacy.”  \nCompl. ¶ 172, Dkt. 12.  An invasion of privacy cause of action may be based on the intrusion \nupon one’s physical solitude or seclusion.”  Harris v. Department of Justice, 600 F. Supp. 2d \n129, 135 (D.D.C. 2009).  “The tort of intrusion upon seclusion has three elements: (1) an \ninvasion or interference by physical intrusion, by use of a defendant’s sense of sight or hearing, \n                                                 \n3 “There is no real difference as a practical matter between false arrest and false imprisonment.”  \nBarnhardt v. District of Columbia, 723 F. Supp. 2d 197, 214 (D.D.C. 2010).   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 26   Filed 08/22/18   Page 10 of 10\nor by use of some other form of investigation or examination; (2) into a place where the plaintiff \nhas secluded himself; or into his private or secret concerns; (3) that would be highly offensive to \nan ordinary, reasonable person.”  Helton v. United States, 191 F. Supp. 2d 179, 181 (D.D.C. \n2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, for the reasons discussed above, it is not \nunreasonable for the District to conduct strip searches of individuals before they enter the general \nprison population.  Jones did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy upon his reentry to the \ngeneral population at the D.C. Jail and thus has not satisfied the third element of the tort of \nintrusion upon seclusion.  The Court grants the District’s motion to dismiss as to Jones’s \ncommon law claim for invasion of privacy. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies in part and grants in part the District’s motion \nto dismiss.  Specifically, Counts 3, 4, and 5 are dismissed for failure to state a claim.  Counts 1 \nand 2 survive insofar as they allege that the District violated Jones’s rights under the Fifth \nAmendment by continuing to detain Jones after a court ordered Jones’s release.  Jones’s claim \nthat the District violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment by overdetaining him is \ndismissed.  Jones’s Motion for Leave to File supplemental authorities is denied as moot.  A \nseparate order consistent with this decision accompanies this memorandum opinion.  \n \n \n                ________________________ \n                DABNEY L.

But plaintiff was \nreleased on the day he was ordered released, within hours of his court hearing; he was not \noverdetained. \nFACTS1 \n  Plaintiff Richard Jones, a DOC inmate at the D.C. Jail, attended a hearing at the federal \ncourthouse on December 7, 2015, during which DOC was ordered to release him. First Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 128-29 [12]. Following the hearing, plaintiff was transported from the courthouse to \nD.C. Jail to await the completion of his release processing by DOC. Id. When plaintiff arrived at \nthe D.C. Jail, following his hearing, he was subject to a strip search and visual body cavity \nsearch before admission to the general population. Id. at ¶ 137. Within “several hours” of his \nreturn to D.C. Jail plaintiff was released. Id. at ¶ 132. He “pleads in the alternative” that he was \nheld for more than five hours before being released. Id. at ¶ 133. \nPlaintiff filed this lawsuit against the District alleging that he was unconstitutionally \noverdetained and strip searched, and that he suffered a false arrest and invasion of privacy in \nviolation of District of Columbia common law. Id. at ¶¶ 147-77. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1   The District does not dispute the allegations of the Complaint solely for purposes of this \nmotion. However, the District reserves the right to dispute the allegations for all other purposes.  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 6 of 18\nARGUMENT \nI.  Standard of Review  \n“A  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  tests  the  legal  sufficiency  of  a  complaint[.]”  Browning  v. \nClinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002). To survive, a complaint “must contain sufficient \nfactual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft \nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007)). The Court should not accept facts unsupported by allegations in the complaint or the \nplaintiff’s legal  conclusions.  Id. “Threadbare recitals  of the elements  of a  cause of  action, \nsupported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id.  \nII.  Plaintiff’s Monell Claim Alleging Overdetention Should Be Dismissed.  \n \nA.  Plaintiff’s Detention for “Hours” While His Release Paperwork Was Processed \nWas Not Unconstitutional. \n \nPlaintiff’s hours-long release processing was not a violation of his constitutional rights. \nIn his Complaint, plaintiff alleges this delay violated his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and \nEighth Amendments. Not so. \n1.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim Sufficient to Establish a Fourth Amendment \nViolation. \n \nThe “several hours” it took for DOC to process plaintiff’s release does not meet the \nstandard for overdentention. But, even if it did, this Court has held that an overdetention does not \nconstitute a Fourth Amendment violation. See Barnes v. District of Columbia, 793 F. Supp. 2d \n260, 273-74 (2011). The Fourth Amendment protects the “right of people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” U.S. Const. \nAmend. IV. As the Court pointed out in Barnes, the plaintiff must show his overdetention \nconstituted a seizure of his person to establish a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 274. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 7 of 18\nLike the plaintiffs in Barnes, plaintiff was already in the custody of DOC when he was ordered \nreleased. Id. As a result, his freedom of movement had already been terminated. Id. The alleged \noverdetention did not constitute a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Id. \n2.  Plaintiff  Fails  to  State  a  Claim  Sufficient  to  Establish  a  Fifth  Amendment \nProcedural or Substantive Due Process Violation. \n \nPlaintiff  has  not  adequately  pled  a  procedural  due  process  claim  under  the  Fifth \nAmendment. In his First Amended Complaint, plaintiff defines overdetention as “holding a \ndetainee or prisoner in Department of Corrections’ custody past the person’s Release Time on \ntheir Release Date.” First Am. Compl. ¶ 26 [12]. According to plaintiff, the “release time” is the \ndate and time on which a detainee is entitled to release and the “release date” is “the day on \nwhich the person is entitled to be released.” Id. at ¶ 27-28. With respect to the “release time,” \nplaintiff further alleges that an individual is per se overdetained if they are held for more than \ntwo hours following a court hearing ordering their release, or if they are released after 10 p.m. Id. \nat ¶ 2. These are legal conclusions—and this Court should not assume they are true, even at the \nmotion to dismiss stage. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Additionally, in Barnes the plaintiffs asked \nthis Court to impose a bright-line time limit of two and a half hours for the DOC release process. \nBarnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 274. The Barnes Court expressly declined, finding only that the \nmaximum permissible administrative delay “likely” falls short of the 48 hours horizon set for \ndetentions pending probable cause determinations after warrantless arrests. Id. at 275-76.  \nPlaintiff alleges he was overdetained for “several hours” or, in the alternative “that he \nwas held for more than five hours.” First Am. Compl. ¶ 132-33. This Court should not accept \nplaintiff’s alternatively pled facts. The length of time plaintiff was held after being ordered to be \nreleased is the heart of his claim against the District—he is alleging he was held for a length of \ntime which was so unreasonable that it violated his constitutional rights. And while Federal Rule \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 8 of 18\nof Civil Procedure 8(e)(2) “allows a party to plead inconsistent statements either alternatively or \nhypothetically within a single count,” “Rule 8(e)(2) specifically states that ‘all statements shall \nbe made subject to the obligations set forth in Rule 11.’”2 Great Lakes Higher Ed. Corp. v. \nAustin Bank of Chicago, 837 F. Supp. 892, 894 (N.D. Ill., E.D. 1993) (requiring claims alleging \n“mutually exclusive possibilities” to be re-pled); see also Osborn v. Haley, 549 U.S. 225, 235 n.6 \n(2007) (“subject to Rule 11 obligations, parties may plead claims or defenses ‘alternately or \nhypothetically”’). Because Rule 11 requires that the signer of a pleading certify that to the best of \nthe  signer’s  knowledge,  information,  and  belief  formed  after  reasonable  inquiry  it  is  well \ngrounded in fact, a party “is not at liberty to set forth variant statements of his claim or defense \nunless he is honestly in doubt as to what the evidence will show.” Banco Cont’l v. Curtiss Nat’l \nBank of Miami Springs, 406 F.2d 510, 513 (5th Cir. 1969). “It is a violation of Rule 11 to \nwithhold relevant factual evidence within the knowledge of the pleading party in order to gain \nthe advantage of being able to plead more causes of action than are appropriate.” Great Lakes \nHigher Ed Corp., 837 F. Supp. at 894 (citing Rule 11).  \nTo be sure, DOC kept plaintiff in its custody during the time it took to administratively \nprocess his release. But, “[t]emporarily retaining custody over an inmate who is entitled to \nrelease in order to accomplish an administrative task incident to that release is not  per se \nunconstitutional.” Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 275. Several courts, including this Court, have \nrecognized the need for administrative processing following a release order, prior to actually \n                                                 \n2   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8, Note to 2007 Amendment (“The former Rule 8(b) and 8(e) cross-\nreferences to Rule 11 are deleted as redundant. Rule 11 applies by its own terms. The force and \napplication of Rule 11 are not diminished by the deletion.”). “Accordingly, courts have held that \nRule 8(d)(3)’s “alternative pleadings rule” does not cover inconsistent assertions of fact when the \npleader holds the knowledge of which of the inconsistent facts is the true one.” Mrla v. Fed. \nNat’l Mortg. Ass’n, case no. 15-cv-13370, *4 (E.D. MI. S.D. July 21, 2016) (citations omitted). \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 9 of 18\nreleasing an inmate. See id. at 275-76; Lewis v. O’Grady, 853 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir. 1988) \n(“We recognize that the administrative task incident to a release of a prisoner may require some \ntime to accomplish—in this case perhaps a number of hours.”); Berry v. Baca, 379 F.3d 764 (9th \nCir. 2004). In his Complaint, plaintiff acknowledges the need for administrative processing \nfollowing a release order:  “A person may be subject to commitment on more than one case or \ncharge,” First Am. Compl. ¶ 25; “Just because a court return receives a single release order does \nnot mean that [the inmate is] automatically entitled to release,” id. at ¶ 62; “A court return sent to \ncourt on more than one charge or case may receive a release order in one case and a commitment \norder in another,” id. at ¶ 63; and “Similarly, a court return who receives release order in all \ncases on which they were sent to court may be subject to continued detention on other cases or \nsubject to a detainer or warrant,” id. at ¶ 64. But plaintiff fails to allege facts that, if true, would \nmake his detention for “hours” during the administrative processing unconstitutional. \nPlaintiff has not adequately pled a substantive due process claim. “[T]he doctrine of \nsubstantive  due  process  constrains  only  egregious  government  misconduct”  and  “grave \nunfairness.” George Washington Univ. v. District of Columbia, 318 F.3d 203, 209 (D.C. Cir. \n2003) (citing Silverman v. Barry, 845 F.2d 1072, 1080 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (doctrine prevents only \n“grave unfairness”)). In Silverman, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit \nidentified two ways a plaintiff might show such unfairness:  “a substantial infringement of state \nlaw prompted by personal or group animus, or a deliberate flouting of the law that trammels \nsignificant personal or property rights….” Silverman, 845 F.2d at 1080.  \nPlaintiff does not allege that DOC officials acted with animus. As a result, to prevail on a \nsubstantive  due  process  claim,  plaintiff  “must  show  that  the  state  actor  was  deliberately \nindifferent to his constitutional rights and that such conduct shocks the conscious.” Cohen v. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 10 of 18\nDistrict of Columbia, 744 F. Supp. 2d 236, 243 (D.D.C. 2010); see also Cty. of Sacramento v. \nLewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 n.8 (1998) (“[T]he threshold question is whether the behavior…[was] so \negregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”).  \nPlaintiff cannot meet the standard set forth in Cohen, because there are no facts alleged in \nthe Complaint  sufficient  to  infer  that the  “detention”—which lasted  several  hours—was  so \negregious that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience. Cf. Berry, 379 F.3d at \n773 (a county knew its policy of delaying processing of releases until all information relating to \nprisoners scheduled for release had been entered into a computer system resulted in delays of up to \n48  hours).  Plaintiff’s  allegations  regarding  another  inmate,  Mr.  Smith,  do  not  cure  this \ndeficiency. See First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 82-104. Mr. Smith is not a party to this litigation. Even if he \nwas overdetained for 23 days, as plaintiff alleges, Mr. Smith’s overdetention does not establish \nthat the District “routinely” overdetains inmates or is deliberately indifferent. The facts pled \nregarding Mr. Smith’s alleged overdetention, however, illustrate the inadequacies of plaintiff’s \nown allegations. According to the Complaint, Mr. Smith was ordered released through two \nrelease orders, but only one order was processed by the DOC Records Office. Id. at ¶¶ 84-91. \nThe Complaint further alleges Mr. Smith informed staff at the jail that he was entitled to release, \nbut DOC did not investigate his claims—instead, detaining him for an additional 23 days. Id. at \n¶¶ 89, 94. In contrast, plaintiff does not allege the District failed to properly process his release. \nHe alleges merely that  his release processing took longer than it should have, but without \npleading a factual basis for the allegation. In fact, he was released within “hours.” Id. at ¶ 132. \nPlaintiff has not adequately alleged a Fifth Amendment due process violation and his Complaint \nshould be dismissed. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 11 of 18\n3.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim Sufficient to Establish an Eighth Amendment \nViolation. \n \nPlaintiff also fails to state a claim for an Eighth Amendment violation. Plaintiff “must \nidentify a deprivation that is ‘objectively, sufficiently serious’ in that it ‘result[s] in the denial of \nthe minimum civilized measure of life’s necessities.” Banks v. York, 515 F. Supp. 2d 89, 105 \n(D.D.C. 2007). Plaintiff does not allege he suffered any mistreatment during the time he was \nheld  to  complete  his  release  processing.  To  be  sure,  plaintiff  was  returned  to  the  general \npopulation at D.C. Jail, where he had been detained prior to attending court. First Am. Compl. ¶ \n137.  But  the  District’s  decision  to  return  him  to  the  general  population  until  his  release \npaperwork was processed does not violate the protections found in the Eighth Amendment. \n“After incarceration, only the ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain’… constitutes cruel and \nunusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.” Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, \n664 (1977) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976)). The normal conditions of \nconfinement that are “part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses” do not \nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 \nU.S. 337, 347 (1981). \nB.  Plaintiff Fails to Allege That The District Has a Custom, Policy, or Practice of \nOverdetaining Inmates. \n \nAs explained above, plaintiff fails to state a constitutional violation related to his alleged \noverdetention. He also fails to state a basis for municipal liability. To state a claim against the \nDistrict  of  Columbia  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983,  plaintiff  must  allege  both  an  underlying \nconstitutional violation and a basis for municipal liability. Brown v. District of Columbia, 514 \nF.3d 1279, 1283 (D.C. Cir. 2008). First, a complaint must allege facts sufficient to support a \nreasonable inference that a person acting under color of District law subjected the plaintiff or \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 12 of 18\ncaused the plaintiff to be subjected to the deprivation of a constitutional right. Jones v. Delaney, \n610 F. Supp. 2d 46, 49 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 829 \n(1985)). Then, “[t]o impose liability on the District under … § 1983, [a plaintiff] must show ‘not \nonly a violation of his rights under the Constitution or federal law, but also that the District’s \ncustom or policy caused the violation.’” Feirson v. District of Columbia, 506 F.3d 1063, 1066 \n(D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Warren v. District of Columbia, 353 F.3d 36, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  \nThe pleading requirement for a § 1983 claim is only met where the complaint “include[s] \nsome factual basis for the allegation of a municipal policy or custom,” sufficient to pass muster \n“under the standard set by the Supreme Court in Twombly and Iqbal.” Smith v. District of \nColumbia, 674 F. Supp. 2d 209, 213 n.2 (D.D.C. 2009). There are four basic categories of \nmunicipal action which, if proven, may subject a municipality to liability:  “(1) an expressed \nmunicipal  policy;  (2)  adoption  by  municipal  policymakers;  (3)  custom  or  usage;  and  (4) \ndeliberate indifference. Hunter v. District of Columbia, 824 F. Supp. 2d 125, 133 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(citing Monell v. New York City Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690-94 (1978)). \nPlaintiff alleges the District was deliberately indifferent, First Am. Compl. ¶ 151, but \nprovides no factual support for the allegation. Deliberate indifference means that, “faced with \nactual or constructive knowledge that its agents will probably violate constitutional rights, the \ncity may not adopt a policy of inaction.” Warren, 353 F.3d at 39. Plaintiff must show that the \nDistrict knew or should have known his constitutional rights would likely be violated. Barnes, \n793 F. Supp. 2d at 283. He has not. The Complaint does not provide any factual allegations \nwhich, if true, could prove the District had actual or constructive knowledge that plaintiff’s \nconstitutional rights would be violated if he was returned to the jail while DOC processed his \nrelease. Plaintiff’s only claim is conclusory, stating, “[t]he District was deliberately indifferent to \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 13 of 18\n[plaintiff’s] rights.” First Am. Compl. ¶ 151. The Court should not accept plaintiff’s unsupported \nlegal conclusions. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \nPlaintiff  alleges  broadly  that  the  District  has  a  policy  or  practice  of  overdetaining \ninmates. First Am. Compl. ¶ 81. And, at the same time the plaintiff alleges that the District \ninstituted  reforms  that  “resolved”  and  its  “overdetention  problem.”  Id.  ¶  80.  Plaintiff  then \ncontends, based “based on publically available filing[s]” and “discussions with knowledgeable \npeople such as CJA lawyers,” the District “routinely holds detainees past their Release Times.” \nId. ¶ 117. But, as explained above, plaintiff was not overdetained; he was returned to D.C. Jail \nwhile his release was processed by DOC, and he was released the same day he was ordered to be \nreleased—within several hours. If plaintiff does have support for his legal conclusion that the \nDistrict has a practice of overdetaining inmates—whether that support is from information in \npublic filings or otherwise—he must plead those allegations to support his claim. “Threadbare \nrecitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not \nsuffice” to satisfy a plaintiff’s obligation under Rule 8. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  \nThe only policy or practice which plaintiff identifies in his Complaint is DOC’s practice \nof transmitting release orders to and from the courthouse by paper—a process which plaintiff \nrefers  to  as  a  “sneaker  system.”  First  Am.  Compl.  ¶  46.  Plaintiff  alleges  the  system  is \n“inefficiently implemented,” id. at ¶ 17, but he fails to allege the “sneaker system” actually \ncaused him to be overdetained. Plaintiff admits that the travel time from the courthouse to the \nD.C. Jail is only 10 minutes. Id. at ¶ 106. The Complaint makes no connection between the \nalleged “inefficient” “sneaker system” and plaintiff’s alleged overdetention. \n \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 14 of 18\nIII.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for a Search in Violation of His Fourth and Fifth \nAmendment Rights.  \n \nThe routine search plaintiff describes is not unconstitutional. The search—conducted \nafter plaintiff had been outside of the detention facility—did not violate plaintiff’s Fourth or \nFifth Amendment rights. The Supreme Court and United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit have upheld the use of routine body cavity searches in detention centers fraught with \nsecurity concerns, such as D.C. Jail. \nThe seminal Supreme Court opinion on body cavity searches is Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. \n520 (1979). There, the Supreme Court rejected a Fourth Amendment challenge to a policy of \nvisual body cavity searches for all detainees following contact visits with outsiders. Id. at 560. \nThe Court applied a balancing test to determine the reasonableness of the search:  “Courts must \nconsider  the  scope  of  the  particular  intrusion,  the  manner  in  which  it  is  conducted,  the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.” Id. at 559. Following Bell, \ncircuits  (but  not  the  D.C.  Circuit)  have  split  when  considering  whether  the  balancing  test \ndemanded individualized suspicion before an arrestee could be subject to a body cavity search. \nCompare Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983), with Florence \nv. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 621 F.3d 296, 308 (3rd Cir. 2010), and Powell v. \nBarrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1314 (11th Cir. 2008),3 and Bull v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 595 \nF.3d 964, 975 (9th Cir. 2010). \nThe case law in this circuit is clear. The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit issued a decision directly on point in Bame v. Dillard, 637 F.3d 380 (D.C. Cir. 2011). In \n                                                 \n3   The Eleventh Circuit in Powell noted that most courts (and its own precedent) had \nmisinterpreted Bell as requiring reasonable suspicion for strip searching minor offenders where, \nin fact, that decision neither required individualized suspicion nor differentiated the degree of \nsuspicion required based on the type of offense. Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1307-11 (11th \nCir. 2008). \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 15 of 18\nBame,  the  Court  considered  a  challenge  to  a  United  States  Marshal  Service  policy  which \nauthorized strip searches of all male arrestees upon arrival at the Superior Court of the District of \nColumbia before being housed in the cellblock. Id. The court proceeded directly to the question \nof  whether,  at  the  time  of  the  search  in  2002,  plaintiffs  had  a  clearly  established  Fourth \nAmendment right to be free from the search absent individualized suspicion. Id. at 386. The \ncourt found, “[t]he governing precedent was then, as it is now, Bell v. Wolfish, and nothing in \nBell requires individualized, reasonable suspicion before strip searching a person entering a \ndetention facility.” Id.; see also Johnson v. District of Columbia, 780 F. Supp. 2d 62, 74 (D.D.C. \n2011). The court explained further that “the ‘Court’s rationale in Bell applies equally to any \ndetention facility that is ‘fraught with serious security dangers,’ as well as the cellblock at the \nSuperior Court.” Bame, 637 F.3d at 387 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 559).  \nThe following year, the United States Supreme Court concurred; explicitly rejecting the \nproposition that individualized, reasonable suspicion is required before an inmate entering the \ngeneral population may be subject to a routine, strip search or visual cavity search. Florence v. \nBd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 566 U.S. 318 (2012). The Supreme Court explained, \n“Correctional officials have a legitimate interest, indeed a responsibility, to ensure that jails are \nnot made less secure by reason of what new detainees may carry in on their bodies.” Id. at 318. \nThe Court granted deference to jail officials in their responses and procedures and maintained \nthat where contraband and safety within the prison are concerned, individualized reasonable \nsuspicion to conduct a search is not required. Id. at 330 (quoting Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. \n576, 584 (1984)).4 Although the Court discussed limited circumstances where individualized \n                                                 \n4   Where contraband is concerned the Supreme Court opinion discussed the difficulties of \nfiltering  through  arbitrary  factors  such  as  the  severity  of  the  offense  or  prior  offenses  in \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 16 of 18\nreasonable suspicion may be necessary, those situations involve non-entry to general population, \nor minor, non-violent or civil offenses. None of those circumstances apply here.  \nHere, when plaintiff was searched he was re-entering the general population at D.C. Jail. \nWhen a prisoner is entering the general population from the outside, regardless of the reason, \nprison officials do not need individualized reasonable suspicion to conduct a search; barring \npotential contraband from entry into the prison population is a constitutionally sound objective \nfor the search. As such, plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed.  \nIV.  Plaintiff’s Common Law Claims Should Be Dismissed For Failure to State a Claim. \n \nA.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for False Arrest. \n \nThe elements of a common law false arrest claim and a constitutional false arrest claim \nare practically identical. Barnhardt v. District of Columbia, 723 F. Supp. 2d 197, 214 (D.D.C. \n2010). “[T]he requisite elements in both cases are that the plaintiff was arrested against his will \nand that the arrest was unlawful.” McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 741 F.2d 1406, 1413, 239 U.S. App. \nD.C. 247 (D.C. Cir. 1984). To prevail, “plaintiff must demonstrate ‘that the [District] acted \nwithout probable cause, in an objective constitutional sense, to effectuate his arrest.’” Barnhardt, \n723 F. Supp. 2d at 214 (quoting Taylor v. District of Columbia, 691 A.2d 121, 125 (D.C. 1997)).  \nThis Court held in Barnes that “overdetention” does not provide a basis for a Fourth \nAmendment claim because there is no seizure where the individual is already in DOC custody. \nSee above Section II-B at 6 (citing Barnes, 793 F. Supp. 2d at 273-74). On that basis, plaintiff’s \nalleged overdetention cannot constitute a false arrest. Plaintiff was lawfully in DOC custody on \nDecember 7, 2015, when he was taken to the courthouse. First Am. Compl. ¶¶  128-29 [12]. He \nwas not released from DOC custody at the courthouse, but was instead transported back to D.C. \n                                                                                                                                                             \ndetermining whether or not an individual carries, or has been coerced to carry, contraband. \nFlorence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington, 566 U.S. 318, 334-39 (2012).  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-02405-DLF   Document 17-1   Filed 04/19/17   Page 17 of 18\nJail until his release “several hours” later. Id. at ¶ ¶ 129, 132. Simply put, there are no factual \nallegations anywhere in the Complaint to support a false arrest claim. The claim should be \ndismissed. \nB.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim for Invasion of Privacy. \n \nThe tort of invasion of privacy for “intrusion of seclusion” requires “(1) an invasion or \ninterference by physical intrusion, by use of a defendant's sense of sight or hearing, or by use of \nsome other form of investigation or examination; (2) into a place where the plaintiff has secluded \nhimself, or into his private or secret concerns; (3) that would be highly offensive to an ordinary, \nreasonable person.” Wolf v. Regardie, 553 A.2d 1213, 1217 (D.C. 1989) (internal citations \nomitted). Plaintiff’s claim fails because he has not plead facts sufficient to establish that he had a \nreasonable expectation of privacy from search upon his reentry at D.C. Jail; or that the routine \nsearch would be highly offensive to an ordinary, reasonable person in his situation. But even \nmore detrimental to plaintiff’s claim however, is that plaintiff failed to even allege that the strip \nsearch was offensive to him.5 The Court should dismiss plaintiff’s invasion of privacy claim. \nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Court  should  grant  the  District’s  Motion  to  Dismiss \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint and dismiss the action with prejudice. \nDated:  April 19, 2017.
