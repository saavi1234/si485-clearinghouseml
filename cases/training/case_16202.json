    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit, brought on October 5, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenged President Trump's revocation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The plaintiffs were a group of nonprofit organizations and DACA recipients who sought to enjoin the federal government from ending the program. Not only did the plaintiffs stand to lose benefits and security they had relied upon, but the plaintiffs argued that the rescission was motivated by discriminatory animus toward individuals from Mexico and Central America. As a result, the plaintiffs contended that revoking DACA violated Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection, and the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought equitable estoppel, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgment.</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, the Obama Administration Department of Homeland Security had created the DACA program by issuing a series of policy changes. The program offered work permits and temporary protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children. As of 2017, there were an estimated 800,000 DACA recipients. On September 5, 2017, President Trump announced that he was ending the program in March unless Congress acted within the next six months. As the complaint highlighted, the Obama administration, in promoting DACA, made key promises to immigrants: that any information they provided in the application process would not be used for immigration enforcement, and that barring criminal activity or fraud in their DACA applications, DACA recipients would be able to renew their status and keep their benefits.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs included a series of nonprofit organizations devoted to civil rights, and in particular immigrant rights. The plaintiffs also included individuals who came to the U.S. as children from various nations in South America. Some were students, others were working, and still others had started families in the U.S. They argued that the DACA rescission would lead to loss of work authorization and many vital benefits, loss of the ability to attend college, risk of deportation, and fractured families. Further, the plaintiffs highlighted that the government had issued \"guidance suggesting an intention to welch on those promises and to share that information with ICE and CBP.\"</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Roger W. Titus.</p>\r\n<p>On November 15, 2017, the government moved to dismiss the case. The court denied in part and granted in part the government's motion to dismiss on March 5, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>The court enjoined the government from using or sharing information provided by DACA applicants through the DACA program for enforcement or deportation purposes. The court granted the plaintiffs' estoppel claim, finding that there would be \"substantial risk for irreparable harm.\" The court ordered that if the government \"needs to make use of an individual Dreamer&rsquo;s information for national security or some purpose implicating public safety or public interest,\" it could petition the court for permission on a case-by-case basis. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35373.</p>\r\n<p>The court also declared that the DACA rescission memo was valid and constitutional. The court found that the memo \"neither curtails DHS&rsquo;s discretion regarding individual immigration reviews, nor does it prevent the agency from granting Dreamers deferred action status again in the future,\" making \"DACA and its rescission...more akin to non-binding policy statements...not subject to notice-and-comment requirements\" under the APA. The court also found that the decision to rescind DACA was not arbitrary and capricious under the APA, \"but rather was a carefully crafted decision supported by the Administrative Record...[I]t is irrelevant whether this Court, a judge in California or New York, or even a justice on the Supreme Court might have made a different decision while standing in the shoes of DHS.\" Because the government rescinded the program under the \"reasonable belief that DACA was unlawful, the decision to wind down DACA in an orderly manner was rational.\" 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35373.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' equal protection and due process claims. The court found no merit in the equal protection claim because the executive branch was fulfilling its duty to enforce the law in rescinding DACA, there was no affirmative showing of bad faith, and a facially valid motive to rescind was sufficient. The court also found that DACA did not create any due process entitlements nor did it curtail DHS' discretion in individual immigration reviews. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35373.</p>\r\n<p>The court ordered the case closed. The government then expressed uncertainty about the scope of the injunction, and on March 12, the court directed the parties to collaborate to reach agreement on the specifics of implementing the injunction. On March 15, the court approved the parties' joint proposed textual revisions.</p>\r\n<p>On April 27, 2018, the plaintiffs appealed the case to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The parties' briefs can be found under the documents section of this page. Oral argument occurred before the Honorable Robert B. King, Albert Diaz and Julius N. Richardson on December 11, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>On May 17, 2019, the Fourth Circuit issued its opinion affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's decision. The appeals court affirmed the district court&rsquo;s rulings that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims are justiciable and that DACA&rsquo;s rescission did not require notice and comment under the APA. But it reversed the district court&rsquo;s ruling sustaining the rescission of the policy as valid under 5 U.S.C. &sect; 706(2)(A). The court vacated DACA&rsquo;s rescission as arbitrary and capricious and remanded the matter for further proceedings. On the issue of the use of information provided by DACA applicants, the court of appeals reversed the district court&rsquo;s ruling finding the plaintiffs entitled to injunctive relief on equitable estoppel grounds, reversed the grant of summary judgment in the plaintiffs&rsquo; favor, and vacated the injunction. Finally, the court of appeals found it unnecessary to decide the plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional challenges to DACA&rsquo;s rescission and the related changes to the Department&rsquo;s policies governing use of information provided by DACA applicants, and thus vacated the district court&rsquo;s judgment on those issues and dismissed those claims. 2019 WL 2147204.</p>\r\n<p>On May 24, 2019, the government filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Fourth Circuit's decision. The government also requested expedited consideration of its petition, which the Supreme Court denied on June 3, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On June 28, 2019, the Supreme Court agreed to view the petitions in three DACA cases: Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, Regents of the University of California v. DHS, and NAACP v. Trump.</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court heard oral argument on November 12, 2019, on the issues of whether DHS's decision to wind down the DACA policy is judicially reviewable and whether DHS&rsquo;s decision to rescind DACA is lawful. The decision of the Court was released in June 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Following its decision in Dep&rsquo;t of Homeland Security v. Regents, the Supreme Court denied the Government&rsquo;s petition for certiorari in this case, and effective June 30, 2020, the stay on the Fourth Circuit&rsquo;s mandate was lifted.</p>\r\n<p>After the Supreme Court released its decision in the three DACA cases and denied certiorari in this case, the plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel sent a letter to Judge Grimm on July 17, 2020 asking that the District Court retain jurisdiction to ensure appropriate relief will be granted. The letter raised questions about the government&rsquo;s compliance with the Fourth Circuit&rsquo;s mandate and asked that the government be required to explain the efforts it was taking to comply with the mandate including a discussion of its efforts:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(i) to rescind the memoranda issued by both Acting Secretary Duke and Secretary Nielsen as well as any associated guidance issued to DHS employees,</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(ii) to begin processing properly submitted initial DACA applications as it would have under the status quo ante restored by the Fourth Circuit&rsquo;s mandate, and</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">(iii) to begin processing properly submitted applications for advance parole</p>\r\n<p>Since the plaintiffs prevailed, and the government&rsquo;s effort to repeal deportation protections for Dreamers was &ldquo;arbitrary and capricious,&rdquo; the letter also asked for award of costs and fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act 28 USC Sec. 2412.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, Judge Grimm issued an order that:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">1. Declared the DACA recission and actions taken by the Government to rescind the DACA policy &ldquo;arbitrary and capricious, in violation of 5 U.S.C. &sect; 706(2)(A);&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">2. Restored the DACA policy to its pre-September 5, 2017 status; and</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">3. Enjoined the government from implementing or enforcing the DACA recission or taking any other action to rescind DACA that is not in compliance with applicable law.</p>\r\n<p>In the order, Judge Grimm also applied the doctrine of constitutional avoidance to deny the plaintiffs&rsquo; estoppel claim and injunction request, pertaining to DACA&rsquo;s information-sharing policies, because the policies in question were vacated.</p>\r\n<p>Following the order, the plaintiffs sent Judge Grimm a letter to notify him that the government did not appear to be complying with the order because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had not updated their website to reflect that the policies announced on September 5, 2017, had been declared void.</p>\r\n<p>On July 28, 2020, Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Chad Wolf issued a memorandum (Wolf Memorandum) outlining how the Department should proceed on DACA matters.</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that the &ldquo;Court issue an order to show cause why defendants should not be held in contempt or, in the alternative, to compel compliance with the Fourth Circuit mandate to restore DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017, status.&rdquo; Two weeks later, the defendants filed a response, which included an argument that there was no basis for an order restoring DACA to its pre-September 5, 2017 status because the plaintiffs did not challenge the Wolf Memorandum.</p>\r\n<p>On September 4, the plaintiffs filed a reply to the government&rsquo;s response where they, for the first time, questioned the validity of the Wolf Memorandum on the grounds that &ldquo;Acting Secretary&rdquo; Wolf was &ldquo;illegally appointed&rdquo; under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After a series of motions, on February 26, 2021, Judge Grimm denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; August 14, 2020 motion. In doing so, the district court largely relied on the defendant&rsquo;s informational notice of January 21, 2021, in which they informed the court of recently inaugurated President Biden&rsquo;s Memorandum, which directed the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to preserve and fortify DACA. However, in denying the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion, the court also ordered the parties to provide a joint status report every 45 days.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties filed the first joint status report on April 12, 2021. After a series of joint status reports, the parties attempted to reach an agreement regarding attorneys&rsquo; fees for the plaintiffs. On August 26, 2021, the parties informed the court in a joint status report that the discussions had not been successful and proposed a briefing schedule. Following a telephone conference approving the proposed briefing schedule, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) on October 8, 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 31, 2023, Judge Chuang denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for attorneys&rsquo; fees. The district court first found that the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion was timely. However, the district court further found that the government&rsquo;s position was substantially justified under EAJA, and therefore the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; failed. In finding so, the court noted that the plaintiffs only prevailed on one out of their seven claims and that &ldquo;the merits rulings at each stage did not uniformly reject the Government&rsquo;s position.&rdquo; 2023 WL 2744341.</p>",

As explained in their April 12, 2021 joint status report, ECF No. 130, the parties have \nbeen discussing whether Plaintiffs’ anticipated request for attorneys’ fees can be resolved without the \nneed for motions practice. \n2.  Since  that  filing,  Plaintiffs  have  made a fee demand from Defendants,  explaining \nPlaintiffs’  position that they are entitled  to a significant  award of attorney’s  fees under the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act (EAJA), and that a fee petition for such an award would be timely. \n3.  Although Defendants maintain their position that there is no legal basis for any award \nof any attorney’s fees in this case, and that any future fee petition under EAJA would be untimely, \nDefendants are currently  preparing a response to Plaintiffs’  demand, in the interest  of ascertaining \nwhether the matter can be resolved without the need for court involvement. \n4.  The parties also continue to discuss what Plaintiffs consider to be significant delays in \nthe processing of initial requests for DACA. \n5.  The parties agree that there is no need for the Court to take any action at this time. \n6.

As explained in their previous joint status reports, ECF Nos. 130, 132, 134, the parties \nhave been discussing whether Plaintiffs’ anticipated request for attorneys’ fees can be resolved without \nthe need for motions practice. \n2.  Those discussions were not successful.  The parties propose the following briefing \nschedule for Plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA):  \n(1) Plaintiffs’ fee petition to be filed on or before September 30, 2021; (2) Defendants’ opposition to \nPlaintiffs’ fee petition to be filed on or before October 29, 2021; (3) Plaintiffs’ reply in support of their \nfee petition to be filed on or before November 15, 2021. \n3.  While  the  parties  also  had  continued  to  discuss  what  Plaintiffs  consider  to  be \nsignificant delays in the processing of initial requests for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \n(DACA), that discussion has been overtaken by other court actions. On July 16, 2021, the United \nStates District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued an opinion and a permanent injunction \non the subject of DACA. See Texas v. United States, No. 1:18-cv-00068, 2021 WL 3022434, 2021 WL \n3025857 (S.D. Tex. July 16, 2021) (the “Texas Decision”).

On July 17, 2021, President Biden issued a statement about the Texas Decision, noting \n(among other things) that “[t]he Department of Justice intends to appeal this decision in order to \npreserve and fortify DACA.” Statement by President Joe Biden on DACA and Legislation for \nDreamers  (July  17,  2021),  available  at  https://perma.cc/XTY3-JKHA.  Secretary  of  Homeland \nSecurity Mayorkas also issued a statement, reiterating that DHS “will engage the public in a rulemaking \nprocess to preserve and fortify DACA,” and also “will continue processing DACA renewal requests, \nconsistent with the ruling.” Statement by Secretary Mayorkas on DACA Ruling (July 17, 2021), \navailable at https://perma.cc/YG2A-4L53. \n5.

The rescission of a program affecting the lives of nearly \n800,000 DACA recipients, their families, their employers, and their communities, \nall of whom had come to rely on DACA, followed a host of statements evidencing \ndiscriminatory intent by senior governmental officials, ignored standard \nadministrative procedures, lacked support in the Administrative Record, and was \nallegedly justified by inadequate legal reasoning predicated on a fundamental error.  \nAs set forth in the Opening Brief of Plaintiffs-Appellants, the District Court \nmisapplied this Circuit’s precedents and the established standards for addressing \nsummary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 for assessing whether \nan agency action is arbitrary and capricious or requires notice and comment under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and for evaluating Plaintiffs’ equal \nprotection and due process claims.  The District Court did, in the face of an \nundisputed factual record, properly enter a permanent nationwide injunction \nprohibiting the Government from sharing DACA applicants’ personally \nidentifiable information with enforcement officials.   \nRather than defend the District Court’s decision, the Government spends the \nfirst quarter of its brief urging an alternative basis for affirmance on the ground \nthat the rescission of DACA is non-justiciable—an argument that has been \n\nproperly rejected by all four courts that have ruled on challenges to the rescission, \nand which the Government concedes is inapplicable to Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nclaims.  See Opening and Response Brief for Appellees (“Gov. Br.”) 22 n.1.  Even \nmore telling are the Government’s: (i) failure to discuss the three other court \ndecisions that squarely rejected the arguments advanced in its brief; (ii) failure to \ndiscuss Rule 56 or this Circuit’s key precedents for how a court is supposed to \naddress a movants’ failure to propound a Rule 56(c) statement or an opponents’ \nrequest for discovery under Rule 56(d); (iii) acknowledgment that the District \nCourt applied the wrong standard of review in evaluating the equal protection \nclaim, Gov. Br. 54;  and (iv) reliance on arguments against the nationwide \ninjunction that were not made below and not supported by evidence in the Joint \nAppendix.  In sum, the Government’s brief confirms the legal defects of the \nDACA rescission. \nThis Court should sustain the District Court’s injunction, reverse the District \nCourt’s grant of summary judgment, and remand for further proceedings.   \nARGUMENT\nI. THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN GRANTING SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE GOVERNMENT ON PLAINTIFFS’ \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND APA CLAIMS \nAs the Government acknowledges, review of the District Court’s grant of \nsummary judgment is de novo.  Government Brief (“Gov. Br.”) 16.  This Court can \nand should correct the legal errors made below.  The District Court failed to \n2 \n\nproperly apply Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, and it made errors of law in its \nevaluation of each of Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.  Each of these errors \nwarrants reversal.  \nA. The District Court Failed to Properly Apply the Summary \nJudgment Standard for Plaintiffs’ Constitutional and APA \nClaims \nIn the Opening Brief, Plaintiffs demonstrated that the District Court failed \nto properly apply Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.  See Opening Brief of \nPlaintiffs-Appellants (“Pl. Br.”) 15-23.  In particular, the District Court failed to \naddress Plaintiffs’ Rule 56(d) affidavit or related draft discovery, (J.A. 1094-\n1105), as well as the Government’s failure to provide a statement of undisputed \nmaterial facts or respond to Plaintiffs’ Rule 56(c) statement of material facts as to \nwhich there is a genuine dispute (J.A. 473-78).  The District Court also failed to \nview the “facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to \nthe nonmoving party.”  Scinto v. Stansberry, 841 F.3d 219, 227 (4th Cir. 2016) \ncert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 447 (2017).  These failures warrant reversal.  See Balt. \nCtr. for Pregnancy Concerns v. Mayor, 721 F.3d 264, 280 (4th Cir. 2013) (en \nbanc) (a district court “must refuse summary judgment where the nonmoving \nparty has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to [its] \nopposition.”); Ray Commc’ns, Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc’ns, Inc., 673 F.3d \n294, 299 (4th Cir. 2012) (“where the movant fails to fulfill its initial burden of \nproviding admissible evidence of the material facts entitling it to summary \n3 \n\njudgment, summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary \nmatter is presented, for the non-movant is not required to rebut an insufficient \nshowing.”) (emphasis added).  \nThe Government does not address Baltimore Center or Scinto, and its efforts \nto distinguish Ray Communications on the grounds that it “did not involve an APA \nclaim” is cursory, cites no precedent, and lacks merit.  Gov. Br. 61.  This Circuit \nhas not established a different set of procedures to govern summary judgment in \nAPA cases.  Nor should it; unlike other Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 56 \ndoes not exempt APA claims from its requirements.  Compare Rule 26(a)(2)(B)(i) \n(exempting administrative review actions from initial disclosure requirements), \nwith Rule 56 (no such exemption).  Rather, these cases, which note that “the \nsummary judgment process presupposes the existence of an adequate record” —are \nequally relevant to an APA action.  Baltimore Center, 721 F.3d at 280.  Compare \nCitizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 419 (1971) (judicial \nreview under the APA is required to be conducted based on the “whole record”).  \nFor similar reasons, the Government’s assertion that the “district court did \nnot err in granting judgment for the government without discovery in this case,”  \nGov. Br. 61, ignores the fact that Plaintiffs brought non-APA claims, which clearly \n4 \n\nentitles Plaintiffs to discovery.  Pl. Br. 44 (collecting cases).1  Moreover, to meet \nits burden under Rule 56, the Government should have preserved its position below \nby filing an opposition to Plaintiffs’ Rule 56(c) proffer, which it failed to do.  (J.A. \n121).   \nThe Government also contends that the District Court “did not fail . . . to \nview the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs’ claims.”  Gov. Br. 62.  \nThe Government both misstates the standard (which requires the District Court to \nview both “facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party,” Scinto, 841 F.3d at 227) (emphasis added) and \nignores material facts that Plaintiffs cited and the District Court failed to address, \nincluding:  \n(i) the fact that the Government rescinded DACA (which was 93 percent \nLatino) but left in place numerous other deferred action programs that \ndid not impact predominantly Latino populations (J.A. 40-41, 46, 58-\n59, 90, 475, 1095, 1363-70, 1438-41); \n(ii) procedural irregularities leading up to the DACA rescission, including \nsuspension of renewal notices, failure to abide by the DACA program \nStandard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”), failure to use notice and \ncomment procedures, offering only the barest of reasons for the \ndecision, and the reversal of long-standing Government positions that \nDACA was lawful (J.A. 72-75, 81-82, 85-87, 91-93, 474-76; 588-95); \nand \n1 The Government’s effort to distinguish Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988), \ncited by Plaintiffs, misstates the relevance of that decision:  that a plaintiff who \nbrings both APA and constitutional claims against the federal government has the \nright to conduct discovery even if it “will entail extensive ‘rummaging around.”’  \nId. at 604.” \n5 \n\n(iii) the Government’s repeated promotion and representation to DACA \nrecipients prior to the rescission that they would be allowed to work, \nstudy, travel internationally, live free from the fear of deportation, and \ntheir application information would not be shared with immigration \nenforcement officials (J.A. 42, 60-63, 86-87, 473). \nPl. Br. 17.  Nor did the Government address the reasonable inference from the 22 \npublic statements from senior Government officials revealing racial animus against \nLatinos (J.A. 46, 69-72, 76-79, 83-84, 1096) that discovery would have revealed \nmore incendiary anti-Latino statements made in private, including with respect to \nthe rationale for DACA’s rescission.  Pl. Br. 18-19. \nThe Government has not argued, much less met its burden to show, that \nthese points are immaterial as a matter of law.  See, e.g., Ross v. Comm’ns  \nSatellite Corp., 759 F.2d 355, 364-65 (4th Cir. 1985) (“The burden is on defendant, \nas the moving party, to demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material \nfact.”).  Nor could it.  These facts and the additional discovery Plaintiffs sought on \nthese issues, are relevant to all of Plaintiffs’ claims.  (J.A. 1094-1105 & Pl. Br. 18-\n20, 29-30, 39-41, 48-51).  Nor did the District Court engage in any of the requisite \nevaluation of the factual record to conclude immateriality.  See generally Ross, 759 \nF.2d at 364 (“[T]he district court must perform a dual inquiry into the genuineness\nand materiality of any purported factual issues.  Whether an issue is genuine calls\nfor an examination of the entire record then before the court . . . .”) (emphasis in \noriginal).  These failures demonstrate why “[c]are is required in deciding whether \n6 \n\nthe evidence presents a genuine issue of motive,” and “summary judgment is \nseldom appropriate in cases wherein particular states of mind are decisive as \nelements of [a] claim or defense.”  Id.  The District Court failed to apply this \nstandard in evaluating Plaintiffs’ evidence that bad faith and impermissible animus \npermeated the administrative process. \nThe District Court’s misapplication of Rule 56 requires reversal. \nB. The District Court Erred in Dismissing the APA Claims \nIn the Opening Brief, Plaintiffs demonstrated that the District Court erred in \ngranting summary judgment on the APA claims for three reasons: (1) it failed to \naddress the incompleteness of the Administrative Record; (2) the Administrative \nRecord, as it stands, does not support the Government’s purported rationale for \nending DACA; and (3) DHS promulgated the September 5 memorandum \nrescinding DACA (the “Rescission Memorandum”) without notice-and-comment \nrulemaking.  Pl. Br. 20-37.  Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief noted numerous instances \nwhere the District Court diverged on these key issues from the three other Courts \nto consider these questions.  The Government fails to address any of these other \ndecisions in its brief, and its arguments are otherwise unavailing.   \n1. The Administrative Record Is Incomplete and Therefore Cannot \nSustain DHS’s Rescission of DACA \nUnder the APA, judicial review is required to be conducted based on the \n“whole record.”  Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 419.  The Government disputes that the \n7 \n\nDistrict Court erred by conducting its review of the APA claims on an incomplete \nAdministrative Record.  See Gov. Br. 43-48.  But as Plaintiffs’ proffer below \nshowed, the Administrative Record was incomplete on its face and lacked any \nwritten communication among the relevant personnel involved in the \nrecommendation and decision to rescind DACA.  (J.A. 498, 1094-1105).  \nMoreover, the District Court at no point made a finding that the Administrative \nRecord submitted was in fact complete.  Indeed, the District Court acknowledged \nthat two other district courts had declared the Administrative Record incomplete \nand ordered supplementation.  (J.A. 1099).  Without a predicate finding that the \nAdministrative Record was complete, it was improper for the District Court to rule \non whether the Administrative Record as presented fully supported the agency \naction.  Pl. Br. 20 (collecting cases). \nThe Government’s argument that the Administrative Record is complete, \nbecause the agency selected only the materials Acting Secretary Duke actually \nconsidered (Gov. Br. 44-46, J.A. 127,) is contrary to law.  Agencies are required to \nsubmit the “whole record” including all of the materials before the agency, not \nmerely a subset actually considered by a decision-maker, and not merely the subset \nthat purportedly support the ultimate decision.  See Pl. Br. 20-22 (citing cases);\nWalter O. Boswell Mem. Hosp. v. Heckler, 749 F.2d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n8 \n\n(“To review less than the full administrative record might allow a party to withhold \nevidence unfavorable to its case.”).\nThe Government raises several arguments that it did not make before the \nDistrict Court defending the completeness of the Administrative Record.  Gov. Br. \n44-48.  Even if these arguments had not been waived, they are without merit.  For \nexample, the Government posits that because the agency decision was an “informal \nagency action” and because of “the nature of the decision,” there should be a lesser \nstandard for assessing the completeness of the record.  Gov. Br. 44-45.  But none \nof the cases the Government cites stand for the proposition that judicial review can \nbe conducted on less than the “whole record,” as required by the APA.  See 5 \nU.S.C. § 706.  Similarly, the Government’s suggestion that there were no materials \n“in the possession of subordinates” or materials “indirectly considered by a \ndecisionmaker,” Gov. Br. 46, strains credulity, and is inconsistent with the proffers \nthe Government made to the Second and Ninth Circuits about the purported \n“burden” associated with complying with orders compelling completion of the \nAdministrative Record.  See Battalla Vidal, et al. v. Baran, et al., 16-cv-4756, ECF \nNo. 87 at 4 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2017) (reporting Defendants collected more than \n1.2 million documents from 100 DHS custodians pursuant to the order to \nsupplement the Administrative Record); Regents of Univ. of  California v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Security, 3:17-cv-5211, ECF No. 86-1 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 20, \n9 \n\n2017) (same).  Similarly, the Government’s claim that all materials that it withheld \nare “deliberative” (Gov. Br. 46) is both inconsistent with its representation that \nthere are no such materials, and is unsupported by the record.2\nThe Government’s attempt to distinguish Dopico v. Goldschmidt, 687 F.2d \n644 (2d Cir. 1982) also fails.  In Dopico, the Second Circuit recognized that \neffective judicial review requires courts’ “independent consideration” of the \ncompleteness of the Administrative Record, especially “where there is a strong \nsuggestion that the record before the Court was not complete . . . .”  Id. at 654.  The \nfact that the documents in Dopico came from outside the government was not \ndispositive; rather, the court focused on the “inconceivab[ility] that such \nfundamental documents —the very basis for federal decision-making . . . .” would \nbe excluded from the administrative record.  Id.  Similarly, the decision to rescind \nDACA could not have been reasonably reached without materials analyzing the \nimpact of this decision and the litigation risk of maintaining the program.  \nMaterials relating to both topics are conspicuously absent from the Administrative \nRecord.  The District Court could not rely on the Government’s “assurances” that \n2 The Government’s mere assertion that any undisclosed materials are privileged \ndoes not meet its burden to sustain such a privilege.  The Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure require a litigant to substantiate the basis for a purported privilege by \n“describ[ing] the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not \nproduced or disclosed—and do so in a manner that . . . will enable other parties to \nassess the claim.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(A)(ii).  In other words, the Government \ncannot evade effective review with a blanket assertion.   \n10 \n\nthe record was complete, especially when the Government’s “certification” made \nclear that the Administrative Record had been compiled using an erroneous legal \nstandard.  Compare J.A. 127 (materials directly relied upon by Acting Secretary \nDuke) with Walter O. Boswell, 749 F.2d at 793 (the “whole record before the \nagency at the time of its decision”).  The District Court should have undertaken its \nown review to ensure that it had a complete Administrative Record against which \nto evaluate Plaintiffs’ APA claims.\nFinally, the Government’s cited cases do not support its arguments.  In \nUnited States v. Nova Scotia Food Prods. Corp., the plaintiffs attempted to \nintroduce evidence into the Administrative Record that had never been presented to \nthe agency in its decision-making process.  568 F.2d 240, 249-50 (2d Cir. 1977).  \nHere, Plaintiffs are not seeking to introduce new evidence by supplementing the \nrecord, but rather noting that the Administrative Record in this case is incomplete.  \nIn Bar MK Raches v. Yuetter, which the Government also cites, the plaintiffs \nattempted to remove documents from the Administrative Record.  994 F.2d 735, \n739-40 (10th Cir. 1993).  Neither of these cases limits the ability of a court to \nrequire completion of the Administrative Record.   \nThe Government also argues that Plaintiffs were not entitled to extra-record \ndiscovery.  Gov. Br. 48.  Again, the District Court did not make any finding \nwhether or not the Plaintiffs had met the standard for such discovery.  See Overton \n11 \n\nPark, 401 U.S. at 420 (extra record discovery permitted where there is a “strong \nshowing of bad faith or improper behavior”); Nat’l Audubon Soc. v. Hoofman, 132 \nF.3d 7, 14 (2d Cir. 1997) (same); Air Transport Ass’n of America, Inc. v. National \nMediation Bd., 663 F.3d 476, 487-88 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (a district court should grant \nlimited discovery in APA cases if a party can show “that it will find material in the \nagency’s possession indicative of bad faith or an incomplete record . . . .”) \n(emphasis added).  Plaintiffs proffered strong evidence, based on the public record, \nof bad faith and improper behavior by the Government in rescinding DACA, \nincluding the 22 statements of anti-Latino animus (J.A. 69-72), the decision to \nrescind a deferred action program whose beneficiaries were predominantly Latino \nwhile maintaining other deferred action programs (J.A. 474-75), the procedural \nirregularities that preceded the rescission of DACA (J.A. 81-82, 502), and the \ninfirmities in the cited rationale for terminating DACA (J.A. 82-85).  That two \nfederal district courts reviewed the same facts and found that extra-record \ndiscovery was appropriate demonstrates that this standard is easily satisfied.3 See\nPl. Br. 23.  The District Court’s failure to evaluate Plaintiffs’ evidence was error. \n3 Both the Ninth Circuit and Second Circuit upheld district court orders to \nsupplement the Administrative Record in ruling on the Government’s mandamus \npetitions.  In re United States, 875 F.3d 1200, 1205-06 (9th Cir. 2017) rev’d on \nother grounds 138 S. Ct. 443 (2017) (delaying discovery proceedings until the \nDistrict Court ruled on the Government’s 12(b)(1) jurisdictional motion); In re \nNielsen, No. 17-3345, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 27681, at *13-14 (2d Cir. Dec. 27, \n2017). \n12 \n\n2. The DACA Rescission Was Arbitrary and Capricious \nIn the Opening Brief, Plaintiffs demonstrated that there was extensive public \nrecord evidence that the Government’s decision to rescind DACA was motivated \nby anti-Latino animus, and that agency action motivated by animus constituted \narbitrary and capricious action.  See Op. Br. 29-30.  The Government’s conclusory \nresponse, Gov. Br. 43, does not address the merits of this point, and the failure to \ndispute this argument warrants reversal.4\nIn the Opening Brief, Plaintiffs also demonstrated that the rescission of \nDACA was arbitrary and capricious because DHS failed to consider an “important \naspect of the problem”—reliance interests—and “offered an explanation for its \ndecision that runs counter to the evidence . . . .”  Pl. Br. 27-29.  See Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass’n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42-44 (1983).\nPlaintiffs also showed that the Government’s rescission of DACA was arbitrary \n4 The Government’s contention that Plaintiffs failed to cite evidence of animus “in \nthe administrative record” or that “Secretary Duke [personally] acted with animus” \nis not the relevant inquiry.  Plaintiffs cited to ample evidence in the Joint Appendix \nthat other senior government officials involved in the decision including the \nPresident, made anti-Latino statements contemporaneous with the decision, and \nthat DHS (directed by Duke) engaged in procedural irregularities and other \nmisconduct leading up to the decision.  Where there is bad faith or misconduct, it is \nappropriate to consider evidence outside of the Administrative Record itself, \nparticularly where it is clear that the Government has selectively cherry-picked \ndocuments and excluded unfavorable materials.  See Latecoere Int’l, Inc. v. U.S. \nDep’t of Navy, 19 F.3d 1342, 1365-66 (11th Cir. 1994); Tummino v. Torti, 603 F. \nSupp. 2d 519, 542-44 (E.D.N.Y. 2009); see generally Overton Park, 401 U.S. 402. \n13 \n\nand capricious because it was unsupported by the Administrative Record.  Pl. Br. \n30-33. \na. DHS Failed to Consider an Important Aspect of the \nProblem: The Significant Reliance Interests Engendered \nby DACA \nWhere, as here, an agency program has been in place for a significant period \nof time and individuals, including those directly regulated, have structured \nactivities based on that program, an agency must consider reliance interests before \nit undertakes a change or rescission of that program.  Pl. Br. 27 (citing Encino \nMotorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126 (2016)).  When an agency does \nnot explicitly account for such interests, the new policy must be set aside.  Id. \n(citing Jimenez-Cedillo v. Sessions, 885 F.3d 292, 299-300 (4th Cir. 2018)).   \nThe Government contends, without citing any authority, that a “discretionary \npolicy . . . cannot create legally cognizable reliance interests.”  Gov. Br. 40.  This \ncontention is directly contrary to Encino Motorcars, where the Supreme Court \nrecognized that “[a]gencies are free to change their existing policies” when \nimplementing statutes and acting in areas where Congress is silent or ambiguous, \nbut that “reliance interests . . . must be taken into account” when such changes \noccur and that “a reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and \ncircumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.” 136 S. Ct. at \n2125-26 (quoting FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515-16 \n(2009)).  The Government’s attempt to distinguish Encino Motorcars, Gov. Br. 41,\n14 \n\nmisses the Court’s core point:  the Encino Motorcar plaintiffs—like the DACA \nrecipients, their employers, their schools, and their communities—had all \n“structured” themselves around the guidance the agency provided.  136 S. Ct. at \n2126.  These reliance interests are quintessentially what Encino Motorcars requires \ncourts to consider in reviewing an agency action.  Rescission of a long-standing \ndiscretionary program requires an agency to consider and analyze the reliance \ninterests at play.  DHS did not do so in rescinding DACA. \nIn addition to being an incorrect statement of law, the Government \nfundamentally misconstrues the nature of DACA.  Once the Government exercised \nits discretion to implement the DACA program, DACA recipients—as well as their \nfamilies, employers, schools, and communities—were entitled to and did rely on \nthe many benefits that the program bestowed on them.  In addition to DACA status \nensuring that the recipient would not be deported from the United States, recipients \nenjoyed the ability to pursue employment, education, travel internationally, and \nreceive public benefits.  When the Government rescinded DACA, it failed to \nconsider those reliance interests as required by law.  It also did far more than just \nend renewals and new applications; it immediately ended certain of these benefits \nfor current DACA recipients, regardless of the expiration of their DACA status, \nwithout any analysis as to the rationale for or impact of each revocation.  (J.A. \n383).  It bears emphasis that every court that has considered the issue has found \n15 \n\nthat individual DACA recipients, community organizations, employers, and \neducational institutions have interests implicated by DACA sufficient to establish \nstanding to challenge its rescission, and thus the Government’s position that the \nDACA program created no interests lacks merit.5\nThe Government’s attempt to remedy this fatal flaw in the rescission process \nby citing to a June 22, 2018 memorandum issued by Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity Kirstjen Nielsen, Gov. Br. 41-42, also lacks merit.  This memorandum \nwas not and could not have been considered by the District Court, is not in the \nJoint Appendix, and has no weight here.6  In any event, post-hoc rationalizations \ncannot sustain DHS’s decision.  See Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 419.  In sum, the \nGovernment has failed entirely to consider an important part of the problem -- the \nreliance interests engendered by the DACA program. \n5 See J.A. 1384-89 (Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1033-39) (finding that the State \nand University plaintiffs had standing based on the enrollment and hiring of \nDACA recipients relying on representations of the DACA program); J.A. 550-56 \n(Batalla Vidal v. Duke, 295 F. Supp. 3d 127, 154-62 (E.D.N.Y. 2017)) (same); \nTexas v. United States, No. 18-CV-68 (S.D. Tex. June 25, 2018) (permitting New \nJersey to intervene to defend DACA on the same basis). \n6 It is improper for the Court to consider materials not part of the Administrative \nRecord or contained elsewhere in the Joint Appendix.  See United States v. Stone, \n866 F.3d 219, 230 (4th Cir. 2017).  For similar reasons, the Court should disregard \nthe Government’s citation of remarks from President Obama.  Gov. Br. 40.   \n16 \n\nb. DHS’s Decision Is Unsupported By the Administrative \nRecord \nThe Government argues that the District Court, alone among the courts that \nhave considered the issue, correctly found the rescission of DACA satisfied the \nAPA’s substantive requirement that an agency action not be arbitrary and \ncapricious.  Gov. Br. 32-39.  The Government’s arguments ignore the fundamental \nlegal principles that: (i) under the APA, a District Court’s review is required to be \n“searching and careful,” Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 416, and (ii) agencies are \nrequired to justify their decisions on the grounds asserted and explain how their \nconclusions relate to the facts before them.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 42-43 \n(emphasizing that an agency must consider all “the relevant factors . . . [including \nany] important aspect of the problem”).  The DACA rescission fails to meet these \nstandards on both counts.   \nNowhere in the Administrative Record can the Government find adequate \nsupport for its primary asserted rationale for the rescission:  litigation risk.  Gov. \nBr. 37-38.  Under the APA’s requirements, to posit a litigation-based risk for the \nrescission, DHS would have had to consider all relevant legal arguments, including \nthe merits of any challenge to DACA, critical distinctions between DACA and the \npreviously litigated DAPA program, and potential defenses.7  Pl. Br. 30-33; State \n7 In its Brief, the Government also attempts to support DHS’s changed view on the \nlegality of DACA based on the decision in Texas, the Attorney General’s letter, \nand the threat of litigation challenging DACA.  Gov.Br. 42-43.  However, neither \n17 \n\nFarm, 463 U.S. at 42-44.  But the Administrative Record reveals no such in-depth \nconsideration of litigation risk issues.  In the absence of such evidence, the \nGovernment responds that it is sufficient for it to assume the conclusion that \nDACA faced an imminent injunction based on the result of litigation over DAPA \nin the Fifth Circuit.  Gov. Br. 32-34.  The APA requires that DHS provide a \nreasoned, non-arbitrary explanation —rather than an ipse dixit—for rescinding the \nDACA program.  And, as every other reviewing court except the District Court \nbelow has found, the Government has not done so here.  Pl. Br. 10, 30.   \nThere is no analysis of DACA’s susceptibility to an injunction in the \nRescission Memorandum.  Pl. Br. 30-31.  A preliminary injunction requires a \nplaintiff to show “‘that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to \nsuffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of \nequities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.’”  Di Biase \nv. SPX Corp., 872 F.3d 224, 230 (4th Cir. 2017).  Other than expressing the view \nthat the DAPA litigation cast doubt on DACA’s legality, which is relevant to but \nnot determinative of the likelihood of success analysis, the Administrative Record \nnowhere indicates that DHS considered the three remaining factors.   \nthe Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Texas nor the Attorney General’s letter overturned or \ncritiqued the Office of Legal Counsel opinion explaining the legality of the DACA \nprogram.  In the absence of any explicit response to that opinion, the APA’s \nrequirement that such changes in policy be explained has not been met.  See Pl. Br. \n28. \n18 \n\nFor example, on the equities, the Government cites to nothing in the \nAdministrative Record for the proposition that DACA, as opposed to DAPA, \nwould be enjoined immediately.  The pre-implementation challenge to DAPA \nplainly presented different equitable considerations than would a challenge to the \nfive-year old DACA program, which benefitted roughly 800,000 recipients, each \nof whom daily relied upon the benefits they expected to maintain during the \npendency of their status, including the possibility for renewal.  See Pl. Br. 32-33; \nJ.A. 253.  See also Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 674 (S.D. Tex. \n2015), aff’d 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015), as revised (Nov. 25, 2015)) (recognizing \nthat enjoining DAPA prior to its implementation presented different equities than a \nsituation where “individuals are currently considered ‘legally present’ and an \ninjunction would remove that benefit . . . .”).   \nOn irreparable harm, the Government cites to nothing in the Administrative \nRecord addressing Texas’s five-year delay in commencing litigation, or analyzing \nother potentially applicable defenses such as laches.  See Pl. Br. 32-33; J.A. 1400-\n01.  See also White v. Daniel, 909 F.2d 99, 102 (4th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 501 \nU.S. 1260 (1991) (“[T]he greater the delay” in bringing the challenge, “the less the \nprejudice required” to successfully plead a laches defense); J.A. 252 (Texas, 86 F. \nSupp. 3d at 674)  (noting that enjoining DAPA after its implementation would \nprove challenging and perhaps “impossible for anyone to ‘unscramble the egg”’ or \n19 \n\nretract “benefits or licenses already provided to . . . beneficiaries”)).  Although the \nGovernment attempts to shift its burden, arguing that Plaintiffs never demonstrated \nthe viability of a laches defense (Gov. Br. 35), its argument misconstrues the \nrelevant inquiry: if DHS purportedly based the DACA rescission on the likelihood \nof a successful suit, it was arbitrary and capricious for DHS to fail to consider its \npotential defenses because it did not consider “an important aspect of the problem . \n. . .”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.   \nOn the likelihood of success on the merits, the Government’s brief relies \nprimarily on the Attorney General’s letter, and the threat of litigation challenging \nDACA.  Gov. Br. 42-43.  But both the Attorney General’s letter and the \nGovernment’s brief ignore several crucial differences between DACA and DAPA.  \nSee Pl. Br. 32-33; NAACP v. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209, 239 (D.D.C. 2018); J.A. \n1460-65 (Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 279 F. Supp. 3d 401, 423-29 (E.D.N.Y. 2018)); \nJ.A. 1395-96 (Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 279 F. \nSupp. 3d 1011, 1040-41 (N.D. Cal. 2018)).  For example, there is a direct conflict \nbetween DAPA and specific sections of the INA.  See Texas v. United States, 809 \nF.3d 134, 170-71, 182-83, 190-92 (5th Cir. 2015).  In contrast, the INA is silent \nwith respect to DACA.  This does not, as the Government contends, mean that \nCongress effectively prohibited DACA.  Gov. Br. 35.  Rather, it means that DHS \nhas latitude to promulgate a reasonable interpretation of the law as applied to the \n20 \n\ncircumstances of DACA recipients.  See J.A. 132-64; cf. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984) (“[A] court may not \nsubstitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable \ninterpretation made by . . . an agency.”) (emphasis added); Sijapati v. Boente, 848 \nF.3d 210, 216 (4th Cir. 2017) (applying Chevron deference to an agency \ninterpretation of the INA).  In addition, because the Government does not contest \nthat DACA lacks an analogue in the INA, the Government cannot rely on the Fifth \nCircuit’s inapposite statutory holdings.  See Pl. Br. 32; NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at \n239 (holding DHS’s conclusion “based only on an incongruous reference to the \nFifth Circuit’s decision on DAPA . . . cannot support the program’s rescission”). \nPlaintiffs emphasized that, in relying on the Attorney General’s letter, DHS \nincorporated its factual and legal errors, including the Attorney General’s \nattribution of constitutional holdings to the Fifth Circuit, which did not make any \nsuch holdings.  Pl. Br. 31-32.  Importantly, the Government does not contest that \ncourts never ruled on the constitutionality of DAPA or DACA.  Instead, the \nGovernment argues that the Attorney General’s letter “should not be read to \nattribute ‘constitutional’ holdings to . . . Texas.”  But the Attorney General’s letter \nstates that rescission is appropriate “[b]ecause the DACA policy has the same legal \nand constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA.”  (J.A. 370 \n(emphasis added)).  The Attorney General plainly relied on the misapprehension \n21 \n\nthat “courts recognized” “constitutional defects as to DAPA” when no court had \ndone so. \nThe Government also argues that the Rescission Memorandum “described \n[the DHS Acting Secretary’s views on the legality of DACA] in purely statutory \nterms.”  Gov. Br. 36.  But the sparse analysis (and justification) of the rescission \nsimply states:  “Taking into consideration the Supreme Court’s and Fifth Circuit’s \nruling in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney \nGeneral, it is clear that the . . . DACA program should be terminated.  (J.A. 383 \n(emphasis added)).  There is no support in the memo for the Government’s \ncontention that the Acting Secretary used “purely statutory terms.”  Nor is there \nsupport for the Government’s contentions that the Acting Secretary’s conclusions \n“did not depend in any way on whether DACA was unconstitutional, rather [that \nDACA was] ‘merely’ contrary to statute[,] and [was] likely to be enjoined \nregardless.”  Gov. Br. 36 (emphasis added).   \nBecause DHS did not distinguish between “legal . . . defects” and the \n“constitutional defects,” it is impossible to determine what weight the agency’s \nlegal analysis gave to the alleged constitutional defects.  Since a court cannot \nuphold an agency action “if the agency has misconceived the law,” SEC v. Chenery \nCorp., 318 U.S. 80, 94 (1943), this error and omission warrants reversal. \n22 \n\nFinally, the Government’s attempt to minimize the import of Organized \nVillage of Kake v. USDA, 795 F.3d 956 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc), cert. denied, 136 \nS. Ct. 159 (2016), is belied by the facts of this case.  In Kake, the Ninth Circuit \nmade clear that litigation risk alone is not a sufficient justification, especially when \nthe agency would just be “deliberately trad[ing] one lawsuit for another,” which is \nexactly what DHS did.  Id. at 970.  Rather than rescinding the program and \nenjoying the “benefit of mooting a near-certain injunction,” as the Government \nasserts, Gov. Br. 37, DHS now faces three nationwide injunctions resulting from \n10 active suits challenging its decision.  J.A. 1519 (D. Md. Order); J.A. 1484-85 \n(Batalla Vidal, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 437-38); J.A. 1407-09 (Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d \nat 1048-49).  DHS deliberately traded one lawsuit for several and, in the absence of \na supporting rationale, such action illustrates the arbitrary and capricious nature of \nthe agency’s decision.                                      \n3. In Dismissing the APA Notice and Comment Claim, the \nDistrict Court Misapplied the Law \nThe Government’s rescission of DACA required notice-and-comment \nrulemaking because it was a “substantive” rule within the meaning of the APA.  \nSee 5 U.S.C. § 553(d)(1).  In particular, in rescinding DACA, DHS: (1) created an \nimmediately binding norm; (2) narrowly limited the discretion of agency officials; \nand (3) had a substantial impact on those regulated.  Pl. Br. 35-38.  The \nGovernment’s contention that the DACA rescission was exempt from notice-and-\n23 \n\ncomment because it was a “general statement of policy” about how the agency \nprospectively intends to exercise its enforcement authority, Gov. Br. 49-52, is \nwrong as a matter of fact and law. \n  This Court recently reaffirmed that an agency action constitutes a \nsubstantive rule when it “adopts a new position inconsistent with existing \nregulations, or otherwise effects a substantive change in existing law or policy.” \nChildren’s Hosp. of the King’s Daughters, Inc. v. Azar, 896 F.3d 615, 620 (4th Cir. \n2018) (citing Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002, 1021 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (emphasis \nadded).  In contrast, an agency action is a general statement of policy if it “does not \nestablish a binding norm and leaves agency officials free to exercise their \ndiscretion.”  Chen Zhou Chai v. Carroll, 48 F.3d 1331, 1341 (4th Cir. 1995).   \nApplication of those standards to the facts of the DACA rescission makes \nclear that the rescission is a substantive rule requiring notice-and-comment.  The \nimplementation of the rescission indisputably effects a “substantive change in \nexisting . . . policy.”  Children’s Hosp. at 620.  In announcing Secretary Duke’s \ndecision, DHS expressly took away the rights of prior and potential DACA \nrecipients to travel internationally, work, attend school, and be free from \ndeportation.  See Pl. Br. 38 & n.6.  The Rescission Memorandum included \nnumerous mandates removing the discretion of agency officials by directing that \nthey “will” —rather than “may” —undertake specified steps to effectuate the \n24 \n\ndenial of those previous benefits.  See Pl. Br. 36-37 & n.5.  Tellingly, the \nGovernment does not address, much less refute, the critical significance of the \ncompulsory “will” language in the Rescission Memorandum as removing the \ndiscretion of agency personnel. \nSimilarly, by its own terms, the Rescission Memorandum was “effective \nimmediately” (J.A. 383), thereby binding agency officials to a new norm on the \nday it was issued.  Id.  It was not, as the Government contends, a mere “general \nstatement of policy [that] ‘advise[s] the public prospectively of the manner in \nwhich the agency proposes to exercise discretionary power.’”  See Gov. Br. 49 \n(citation omitted).  For example, in announcing the rescission, Acting Secretary \nDuke ordered DHS officials to immediately reject all new work authorizations and \nall pending and future applications for advance parole for international travel.  J.A. \n383. \nThese actions substantively affect the rights and obligations of individuals \nand the public.  See Pl. Br. 37-38.  The Government failed to address, and cannot \ndispute, the sweeping impact that the DACA rescission has on recipients, DACA-\neligible individuals, their communities, and other parties affected by the DACA \nprogram —including employers, schools, and universities.8  The rescission directly \nand severely harms roughly 800,000 DACA recipients, who are no longer able to \n8 Indeed, the Government concedes that an injunction of the DACA program \nwould cause an “immediate, disruptive” effect.  Gov. Br. 41. \n25 \n\ntravel, work, attend school, and live free from the risk of deportation.  The \nrescission harms their families, many of which include U.S. citizens.  It harms their \ncommunities.  And it harms numerous other interested parties (many of whom \nhave sued to enjoin the rescission), including employers and universities.  See J.A. \n1402-04 (Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1045). These serious and pervasive impacts \nreinforce the conclusion that the DACA rescission is a substantive rule, rather than \na general statement of policy.  See Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 \n(1979) (stating that an agency action “affecting individual rights and obligations” \nis a substantive rule); see also Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 653 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (reasoning that an agency regulation had the \n“hallmark of a substantive rule” because it “substantively affect[ed] the               \npublic. . . .”).   \nThese facts stand in stark contrast to Chen Zhou Chai, where this Court \nfound a regulation that provided “the Attorney General may grant asylum” to \ncertain groups to be a general statement of policy.  48 F.3d at 1341 (emphasis in \noriginal).  By its permissive language, that regulation did not establish a binding \nnorm; rather, it granted agency officials permission to exercise broader discretion.  \nThat is not the case here.  The Rescission Memorandum, by its own terms, \nmandated certain Government actions to be taken that have a substantive effect on \nhundreds of thousands of people to be “effective immediately.” (J.A. 383).  \n26 \n\nFor this reason (among others), the Government’s argument that, because \nDACA was implemented without notice and comment, the rescission of DACA \ncannot be compelled to undergo that process, Gov. Br. 51-52, is wrong as a matter \nof law.  As a matter of policy, the Government can establish enforcement priorities \nand consider applications for individuals who seek leniency.  But having granted \nsuch leniency to a broad class of individuals, the APA requires that substantive \nchanges to the rights and obligations of that class of individuals go through the \nnotice-and-comment process.  5 U.S.C. § 553. \nThe Government is also wrong as a matter of law because the rescission of a \nsubstantive rule requires notice and comment regardless of whether the rule was \nissued through notice and comment.  Consumer Energy Council v. FERC, 673 F.2d \n425, 448 (D.C. Cir. 1982), aff’d, 463 U.S. 1216 (1983) (“The argument that repeal \nwas required because the regulations were defective does not explain why notice \nand comment could not be provided” on the proposed repeal).  Underpinning that \nholding was the D.C. Circuit’s recognition that “[t]he value of notice and comment \nprior to repeal of a final rule is that it ensures that an agency will not undo all that \nit accomplished through its rulemaking without giving all parties an opportunity to \ncomment on the wisdom of repeal.”  Id. at 446.  While the Government argues \nConsumer Energy Council is inapplicable because the regulation there was \ndefective for a “substantive,” rather than a “procedural” reason, the APA does not \n27 \n\nrecognize such a distinction.  Whatever the alleged defect, once a substantive rule \nis in place the agency must, under the statute, to use proper procedures to rescind \nthe rule.  Thus, the assertion that DACA initially should have gone through notice \nand comment does not relieve the Government of its statutory obligation to follow \nsuch requirements when it proposes to rescind DACA. \nC. The District Court Erred in Granting Summary Judgment on \nPlaintiffs’ Equal Protection Claim By Erroneously Applying a \nHeightened Standard of Review \nPlaintiffs’ Opening Brief explained that the District Court applied the wrong \nstandard of review to Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  The complaint, as well as \nmaterials submitted with Plaintiffs’ Opposition to the Government’s Motion to \nDismiss or, in the Alternative for Summary Judgment, made out well-pled factual \nallegations showing the rescission of DACA discriminated against Latinos:  (i) key \nstakeholders involved in the decision to rescind DACA demonstrated \ndiscriminatory intent (J.A. 69-72);  (ii) DACA recipients are 93 percent Latino, and \nthe Government permitted other, non-predominantly Latino immigration deferred \naction programs to continue (J.A. 90, 474); and (iii) there were significant \nprocedural irregularities in the termination of DACA (J.A. 501).   \nEqual protection claims are governed by Village of Arlington Heights v. \nMetropolitan Housing Development Corporation., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), which \nestablishes that discriminatory intent can be inferred from: (1) the history of a \ndecision, “particularly if it reveals a series of official actions taken for invidious \n28 \n\npurposes”; (2) “[t]he . . . sequence of events leading up [to] the challenged \ndecision”; (3) “[d]epartures from the normal procedural sequence”; and (4) [t]he \nlegislative or administrative history . . . especially where there are contemporary \nstatements by members of the decision-making body, minutes of its meetings, or \nreports.” Id. at 267-68.  Plaintiffs presented ample allegations and evidence under \nthis standard to make out a prima facie equal protection claim, and the District \nCourt’s grant of summary judgment was in error and should be overturned.  At a \nminimum, Plaintiffs should have been afforded discovery to flesh out their equal \nprotection allegations further before the District Court ruled on the Government’s \nsummary judgment motion.  See supra at I.A.  \nThe District Court incorrectly applied the framework from Kleindeinst v. \nMandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972), which is inapposite here, because Mandel addresses \nonly the entry of aliens not yet present in the United States, rather than the rights of \nindividuals already in the United States.  Pl. Br. 12, 41-43; see also Trump v. \nHawaii,138 S. Ct. 2392, 2419-20 (2018) (applying Mandel to an executive order \naffecting the entry of foreign nationals to the United States because, in part, of “the \nPresident’s constitutional responsibilities in the area of foreign affairs”).   Relying \non Mandel, the District Court erroneously concluded that the Government merely \nneeded to show a “facially legitimate and bona fide” rationale for the DACA \nRescission, Opinion at 21, and therefore failed to consider how Plaintiffs’ evidence \n29 \n\nmet the threshold requirements for stating an equal protection claim under the \ncorrect Arlington Heights standard.   \nThe Government does not argue that Mandel should apply.  Instead, it \ncontends that the DACA rescission should be viewed as an exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion, and that under Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee, 525 U.S. 471 (1999) (“AADC”), Plaintiffs failed to \nmake the requisite showing of “outrageous” discrimination for a selective \nprosecution claim.  See Gov. Br. 52-62.  But, as the District Court correctly \nconcluded, the DACA rescission was not an exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  \n(J.A. 1508).  Consequently, AADC also is inapplicable here.      \nIndeed, Plaintiffs here do not claim unconstitutional selective prosecution, \nbut instead that the Government violated the Equal Protection Clause by rescinding \nthe DACA program in order to target a class defined by race and national origin.  \nThis contrasts with AADC, where individual Plaintiffs alleged that they each were \ntargeted for deportation based on their political beliefs.  525 U.S. at 472.  \nMoreover, both AADC and Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427 (2d Cir. 2008) (also \ncited by the Government), relied on national security and intelligence-gathering \nconcerns which are entirely absent here.  Compare AADC, 525 U.S. at 490-91 \n(noting concerns regarding “disclosure of foreign policy objectives and . . . foreign \nintelligence products and techniques”) and Rajah, 544 F.3d at 438-39 (noting that \n30 \n\nthe program that was the basis for the deportations “was designed to monitor more \nclosely aliens from certain countries selected on the basis of national security \ncriteria”) with J.A. 379-84 (rescinding DACA because the Attorney General \ndetermined that DACA was unlawful).  Arlington Heights supplies the correct \nframework, and neither Mandel nor AADC have any application here.9\nThe Government does not dispute Plaintiffs’ factual showings that: (i) only \nthe DACA program, which predominantly benefitted Latinos, was targeted for \nrescission, whereas numerous other deferred action programs not primarily \nbenefitting Latinos were left in place; and (ii) there were significant procedural \nirregularities in the termination of DACA.  Pl. Br. 1, 7-8, 40-41, J.A. 90.  The \nGovernment does contend that Plaintiffs’ evidence of a pattern of derogatory \nstatements by government officials (Pl. Br. 40-41;  J.A. 69-72) is insufficient to \nstate a claim of racial animus.  Gov. Br. 57-59.  However, as Arlington Heights\nmakes clear, that is wrong as a matter of law.  Statements of officials \ndemonstrating discriminatory intent are evidence of impermissible government \naction.  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268; see also Centro Presente, 2018 WL \n3543535 at *15 (noting a series of derogatory statements by President Trump were \n9  In a similar equal protection challenge concerning the rescission of a temporary \nprotected status immigration program, a district court rejected the Government’s \nmotion to dismiss on the grounds that AADC barred the claim.  Centro Presente v. \nUnited States Department of Homeland Security, No. 18-10340, 2018 WL \n3543535, at *12-13 (D. Mass. July 23, 2018).  \n31 \n\nevidence of “statements of animus by people plausibly alleged to be involved in \nthe decision-making process” because a supervisor’s influence on a subordinate \ncan be considered in analyzing discriminatory intent).10   The statements of senior \nofficials, referenced in the Complaint, established a plausible basis for finding \ndiscriminatory intent behind the rescission.  And here, Plaintiffs presented \nadditional Arlington Heights evidence of animus, including the decision to \nmaintain non-predominantly Latino deferred action programs, procedural \nirregularities in the rescission decision, and the sequence of events leading to the \nrescission. \nFinally, the Government incorrectly argues that the District Court \nappropriately granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ constitutional claim solely \non the basis of the Administrative Record and without permitting discovery.  This \ntoo fails because “the summary judgment process presupposes the existence of an \nadequate record” and district courts “must refuse summary judgment where the \nnonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is \n10 The cases cited by the District Court and the Government do not hold otherwise.  \nIn McCreary County, Ky. v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.S. 844 \n(2005), the Court noted that “examination of purpose is a staple of statutory \ninterpretation” where “an understanding of official objective emerges from readily \ndiscoverable fact.”  Id. at 861-862.  And in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, \n623-624 n.52 (2006), while the Court declined to substitute statements made by \nGovernment officials to the media for the official presidential determination \nregarding procedures for courts-martial for alien detainees, that case did not \nsuggest such evidence would be irrelevant in an intentional discrimination case. \n32 \n\nessential to its opposition.”  Baltimore Center, 721 F.3d at 280-81 (citations and \ninternal punctuation omitted).  Contrary to the Defendants’ arguments, when a \nplaintiff asserts both APA and constitutional claims, discovery beyond the \nAdministrative Record is permitted on the constitutional claims.  See. e.g., Webster \nv. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 604 (1988) (permitting discovery for constitutional claims); \nRydeen v. Quigg, 748 F. Supp. 900, 906 (D.D.C. 1990), aff’d, 937 F.2d 623 (Fed.  \nCir. 1991) cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1075 (1992) (“When reviewing constitutional \nchallenges to agency decisionmaking, courts make an independent assessment of \nthe facts and the law.”).11\nHere, Plaintiffs correctly pled an equal protection violation, presented \nevidence of discriminatory intent in targeting the DACA program, and requested \nlimited discovery relating to the decision to rescind DACA.  The District Court did \nnot, as it is required to do, “viewing the facts and the reasonable inferences \ntherefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,” Scinto, 841 F.3d at \n227, and its decision therefore should be reversed.     \n11 Similarly, the Government’s reliance on Western Radio Services Co. v. U.S. \nForest Services, 578 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 559 U.S. 1106 (2010) \nis unavailing.  This case did not address the appropriate scope of discovery in a \ncase involving both APA and constitutional claims.  Id. at 1122-23. \n33 \n\nD. The District Court Erred in Granting Summary Judgment on \nPlaintiffs’ Due Process Claims Because the Rescission Impacted \nSignificant Protectable Interests \nDACA was a promise—made by the Government and relied upon by \nhundreds of thousands of young people —that if applicants, at the discretion of the \nGovernment, were granted DACA status, they could receive the benefits flowing \nfrom that status, including the right to work (through a work authorization), the \nright to travel internationally (through advance parole), and the right to pursue an \neducation.   Dreamers also relied on the promise from the Government that they \ncould presumptively renew their legal protection under DACA. \nThe program created constitutionally protected interests that the Government \nrevoked without affording Plaintiffs the right to be heard, and the Government’s \nposition that it is free to breach its promise not to use DACA applicants’ personal \ninformation for enforcement purposes constitutes a violation of Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process rights.  The District Court incorrectly granted summary \njudgment for the Government as to Plaintiffs’ due process claims.  It failed to \nrecognize the rights conferred by DACA and to acknowledge the facts pled by \nPlaintiffs in establishing such due process violations.  The Government’s \narguments to the contrary are wrong. \n1. The Government Extended Constitutionally Protected Interests \nto DACA Recipients \nThe District Court and the Government point to the Government’s initial \nDACA guidance in support of their assertion that DACA did not create any \n34 \n\nsubstantive rights or interests.  Gov. Br. 63.  But the Government’s argument, like \nthe District Court’s ruling, ignores that following each discretionary decision to \ngrant deferred action under DACA, the Government subsequently conveyed \nconstitutionally protected interests on the recipient by “enabl[ing] [him or her] to \ndo a wide range of things open to [citizens]…[such as] be[ing] gainfully employed \nand [being] free to be with family and friends and to form the other enduring \nattachments of normal life.”  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972). \nPerhaps more critically, both the District Court and the Government ignore \nthe liberty interests created by DACA’s presumptive right of renewal.  This Court \nand others have held that individuals may have constitutionally protected interests \nin the renewal of government-created benefits, especially where an “entitlement to \n[such] renewal may be implied…from policies, practices, and understandings . . . \n.”  Richardson v. Town of Eastover, 922 F.2d 1152, 1157 (4th Cir. 1991). \nThere is no doubt that the Government intended DACA to be presumptively \nrenewable.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum explicitly directed that DACA be \n“subject to renewal” (J.A. 131).  While the Government enforced age restrictions \nfor initial applications to the program, there were no such restrictions for renewal; \ninstead, DACA recipients could apply to renew as long as they [w]ere under the \nage of 31 as of June 15, 2012.”  (J.A. 1008).  The Government also used \n“nondiscretionary criteria for renewal” (J.A. 86, 130-31), and it approved more \n35 \n\nthan 99% of DACA renewal applications.  See USCIS, Form I-821D \nConsideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals by Fiscal Year, Quarter, \nIntake, Biometric and Case Status, Fiscal Year 2012-2017 (Mar. 31, 2017), cited at \nJ.A. 46.  Those facts demonstrate more than a plausible inference that the \nGovernment knew it was offering DACA recipients the opportunity for renewal; \nindeed, the Government made repeated statements to that effect, characterizing the \nprogram as a “commitment” and telling Dreamers that they should “rest easy.”  \n(J.A. 83, 1374).  The District Court failed to consider any of these facts in granting \nsummary judgment for the Government. \nBoth Plaintiffs and the Government understood that DACA status, once \ngranted, was presumptively renewable, and that such renewability and other \ninterests that flowed from the initial grant of DACA status—the ability to work, \npursue an education, and to travel internationally—are constitutionally protected.   \nThose interests are at the core of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause.  \n“The fundamental liberties protected by this Clause include most of the rights \nenumerated in the Bill of Rights,” and they “extend to certain personal choices \ncentral to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define \npersonal identity and beliefs.”  Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2597 \n(2015).   \n36 \n\nThe Government “is surely free to extend existing forms of liberty to new \nclasses of persons – liberty that the government may then take only after affording \ndue process.”  Sessions v. Dimaya, 138 S. Ct. 1204, 1230 (2018) (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  Having extended such liberties \nto DACA recipients, the Government cannot revoke them without providing \nprocedural or substantive due process as provided by the Constitution. \n2. The Government’s Rescission of DACA Violated Plaintiffs’ \nProcedural Due Process Rights \nThe District Court erroneously granted summary judgment as to Plaintiffs’ \nprocedural due process claim, stating, without elaboration, that “procedural due \nprocess applies only to individualized deprivations, not policy-based deprivations \nfor an entire class.”  (J.A. 1512).  The Government does little more than parrot that \nlanguage in its opposition.  Gov. Br. 63. \nBoth the District Court and the Government are wrong.  In reaching this \nerroneous conclusion, the District Court failed to address any of the evidence \nPlaintiffs put forth regarding their individualized deprivation of rights, including \nrevocation of permission to travel internationally and loss of employment.  Pl. Br. \n52 (J.A. 44, 50-57, 73-75, 85-89).  That failure alone warrants reversal of summary \njudgment. \nMoreover, the District Court erred in its application of Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. \nv. State Bd. Of Equalization, 239 U.S. 441, 444-45 (1915).  As the Government \n37 \n\nacknowledges, the Bi-Metallic Court found no procedural due process violation in \nthat specific instance because “individuals subject to a general policy may have \nrecourse to political processes.”  Gov. Br. 64.  Here, the Government afforded \nPlaintiffs no “political process [that] serve[d] as an effective alternative.”  (J.A. \n1512).  Indeed, Plaintiffs and other Dreamers were afforded no alternative or \nprocess whatsoever.   \nFinally, the Government argues that due process is not required “for the \nrescission of generally applicable policies.”  Gov. Br. 64.  Both the District Court \nand the Government assume that because DACA impacted a large number of \npeople, application for and granting of DACA status was not an individualized \nprocess.  The rescission of DACA did impact a large number of people —the lives \nof roughly 800,000 people were thrown into chaos—but each one of those 800,000 \npeople individually applied, was individually approved, and individually enrolled \nin the program.  DHS officers denied approximately 8% of initial applications, \nincluding on discretionary grounds.  USCIS Form I-821D, cited at J.A. 46.  It was \nonly after this application process, approval, and enrollment in the program that \nconstitutionally-protected benefits were extended to successful applicants.  The \nIndividual Plaintiffs cited the specific deprivations of these rights that they suffered \nwithout process.  (J.A. 50-57, 73-75, 85-89).  The District Court erred in not \nconsidering those facts.\n38 \n\n3. The Government’s Change to Its Information-Sharing Policy \nViolated Plaintiffs’ Substantive Due Process Rights \nFinally, the District Court erred in granting summary judgment as to \nPlaintiff’s substantive due process claim.  In so ruling, it wholly failed to address \nany facts related to the Government’s alteration of its information-sharing policy.  \nAs the District Court noted elsewhere in its ruling: \n• In introducing DACA, “the Government promised not to transfer or \nuse the information gathered from Dreamers for immigration \nenforcement” (J.A. 1515); \n• After making such a promise, “the government, having induced these \nimmigrants  to  share  their  personal  information  under  the  guise  of \nimmigration protections, could now use that same information to track \nand remove them” (J.A. 1516); and \n• Any such use potentially would be “affirmative misconduct” (id.). \nThe Government’s only mention of the District Court’s failure to address the \nsubstantive due process violations accompanying changes to the information-\nsharing policy is to tell this Court that the Government’s “information-sharing \npolicy has not changed,” Gov. Br. 65, an unsupported assertion that is contrary to \nthe record evidence, untrue, and in direct conflict with the findings of other district \ncourts. \nPlaintiffs presented evidence to the District Court that the Government \ninitially told DACA applicants that the information they provided would be \n“protected from disclosure to ICE and [CBP] for the purpose of immigration \nenforcement proceedings” with very limited exceptions.  (J.A. 1011).  Plaintiffs \n39 \n\nalso presented evidence that in September 2017, the Government amended that \ninformation-sharing policy to state, “[g]enerally, information provided in DACA \nrequests will not be proactively provided to other law enforcement entities[.]”  \n(J.A. 1143).   And Plaintiffs alleged detailed facts identifying specific actions by \nGovernment officials stating their intent to change the policy and other related \npolicies, as well as specific individual DACA recipients who had been targeted by \nthe Government for enforcement proceedings following these announcements.  \n(J.A. 76-78; 475).  In evaluating this explicit change to the information-sharing \npolicy, the Northern District of California held that plaintiffs there had plausibly \nalleged a “broken promise” that “shock[s] the conscience and offend[s] the \ncommunity’s sense of fair play and decency.”  Regents of Univ. of California v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1312 (N.D. Cal. 2018) \n(internal quotation omitted).  \nWhile the Government argues the DACA’s information-sharing policy “was \nalways expressly subject to change,” Gov. Br. 65, Plaintiffs presented evidence \nthat the Government did not consistently provide this disclaimer.  (J.A. 380).  And \nalthough the Government did state in certain communications that the \n“information-sharing policy may be ‘modified, superseded, or rescinded at any \ntime’”  (J.A. 1004), that language “simply allows the government to change its \n40 \n\npolicy in connection with future applicants” (J.A. 1417-18), not to renege on \npromises made to prior applicants and DACA enrollees.   \nAt  best,  the  Government’s  position—that  it  did  not  change  the  DACA \ninformation-sharing policy and that any such change could, in any event, apply \nretroactively to individuals already enrolled in DACA—creates a disputed issue of \nfact.  The District Court therefore erred in granting summary judgment on this \nissue.   \nE. Challenges to the Rescission of DACA Are Justiciable  \nThe Government spends the first fifteen pages of its argument asserting that \nfederal courts have no jurisdiction to hear a challenge to the DACA rescission.  \nGov. Br. 15-30.  As noted, these arguments properly have been rejected by every \ncourt to consider them, including the court below.  (J.A. 1501).12  Contrary to the \nGovernment’s contention, id. at 16-18, the conclusion that there is jurisdiction here \nis consistent with the strong presumption courts are required to apply supporting \njudicial review of agency decisions, see Mach Mining, L.L.C. v. E.E.O.C., 135 S. \nCt. 1645, 1651 (2015), including in the immigration context, see, e.g., McNary v. \n12 See also J.A. 547-48 (Batalla Vidal, 295 F. Supp. 3d at 147) (“Defendants first \nargue that these cases are non-justiciable because the decision to end the DACA \nprogram was committed to DHS’s exclusive discretion by law.  The court \ndisagrees.”)); J.A. 1382 (Regents, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1029-31) (finding that “there \nis law to apply” and DACA’s rescission was not committed to agency discretion by \nlaw)) (emphasis in original); NAACP, 298 F. Supp. at 234  (“Thus, like every other \ncourt that has considered the question thus far, the Court concludes that DACA's \nrescission was not ‘committed to agency discretion by law.’”).   \n41 \n\nHaitian Refugee Ctr., 498 U.S. 479, 483-84 (1991) (“[G]iven the absence of clear \ncongressional language mandating preclusion of federal jurisdiction . . . the District \nCourt had jurisdiction to hear respondents’ constitutional and statutory challenges \nto INS procedures.”).  Although Congress may overcome the presumption by \ncommitting agency action “to agency discretion by law” or by enacting an express \njurisdiction-stripping provision, neither of those exceptions applies here.  \nQuinteros-Mendoza v. Holder, 556 F.3d 159, 162 (4th Cir. 2009); 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 701(a)(1)-(2).  The Government’s arguments to the contrary are unavailing. \n1. The Decision to Rescind DACA Was Not Committed to \nAgency Discretion by Law \nEvery court that has considered the Government’s arguments that the \nrescission of DACA was committed to agency discretion by law, Gov. Br. 16-18, \nhas rejected that assertion and found that challenges to the rescission of DACA are \njusticiable.  (J.A. 1501).  Courts have uniformly ruled this way for a reason:  the \nrescission of DACA is not an enforcement action, discretionary or otherwise.  \nRather, through the Rescission Memorandum, the Government eliminated a \nprogram governing the consideration of deferred action (and related benefits) for a \nclass of individuals meeting specific criteria.  This broad directive was not a \ndecision to enforce the nation’s immigration laws with respect to any particular \nindividual.   \n42 \n\nPlaintiffs are not challenging a decision to prosecute but rather the \nGovernment’s “affirmative decision to eliminate a program by which DHS \nexercised prosecutorial discretion with respect to a large number of undocumented \nimmigrants.”  (J.A. 547).  The Government’s decision regarding that program—\nwith its accompanying protections and benefits—is not committed to agency \ndiscretion by law and is therefore reviewable.  There are two fundamental flaws in \nthe Government’s reasoning to the contrary. \nFirst, the rescission of DACA was not “committed to agency discretion by \nlaw” as that term is defined in the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  The APA \nprovides broad jurisdiction, stating that any “person suffering legal wrong because \nof agency action . . . is entitled to judicial review thereof.”  See 5 U.S.C. § 702.  \nConsistent with this jurisdiction, courts interpret the agency discretion exception \n“extremely narrowly, applying it only ‘in those rare circumstances where the \nrelevant statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against \nwhich to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.’”  Quinteros-Mendoza, 556 \nF.3d at 162 (citing Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993)).   \nHere, there is clearly applicable procedural and substantive law and thus a \n“meaningful standard” for review.  The APA provides the relevant procedural law.  \nCourts can—and should—evaluate whether the Rescission Memorandum complies \nwith the procedural requirements of the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 553, 604.  \n43 \n\nRegardless of whether the substance of an agency action is reviewable, the \nagency’s process in making that decision is reviewable for compliance with the \nprocedural requirements (e.g., for notice-and-comment) established by Congress.  \nSee Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 195-98 (explaining that whether an agency “was required \nto abide by the familiar notice-and-comment rulemaking provisions of the APA” is \na question “quite apart from the matter of substantive reviewability . . . .”). See \nalso Am. Med. Ass’n v. Reno, 57 F.3d 1129, 1134 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“under the \nAPA the ultimate availability of substantive judicial review is distinct from the \nquestion of whether the basic rulemaking strictures of notice and comment and \nreasoned explanation apply.”).  Rather than address these precedents that squarely \nprovide a basis for review, the Government urges this Court to adopt a strained \nreading of I.C.C. v. Brotherhood Of Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.S. 270 (1987) \n(“BLE”).  Gov. Br. 19-20.  But BLE stands for the unremarkable proposition that \nan agency’s decisionmaking rationale cannot convert an otherwise unreviewable \naction into a reviewable one.  482 U.S. at 283.  The Government’s reliance on BLE\npresumes the answer to the threshold question of whether the action at issue is \n“otherwise reviewable.”  Here, the decision to rescind DACA is reviewable and \naccordingly, BLE is not applicable.13\n13 See NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 232 (distinguishing BLE); J.A. 547 (Batalla \nVidal, 295 F. Supp. 3d at 149) (“While it may be true that a presumptively \nunreviewable decision does not become subject to judicial review simply because \n44 \n\nThe relevant substantive law also provides a reviewable standard.  As the \nGovernment concedes, the Plaintiffs brought constitutional claims and \n“constitutional constraints on enforcement discretion are traditionally reviewable \nand provide meaningful standards to apply . . . [and] review of plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claims is therefore not precluded by § 701(a)(2). . . .”  Gov. Br. 22 \nn.1.   \nWith regard to the APA claims, the Government’s suggestion that Plaintiffs \nwere required to cite a provision of the INA, Gov. Br. 22, misconstrues the \nrelevant question under § 701(a)(2) — it is not whether any law constrains the \nagency’s action, but whether that action is expressly committed by statute to \nagency discretion.  As discussed below, the INA contains no such provision.  And \nthere are judicially manageable standards here: in claiming that the termination \nwas grounded on DACA’s alleged illegality, the Government cited several legal \npropositions, which a court is well-suited to evaluate.  The inclusion of legal \nanalyses in the Administrative Record—reflected in the Office of Legal Counsel’s \nDAPA opinion (J.A. 132-64), court decisions in Texas v. United States (J.A. 170-\n343), and the Attorney General’s opinion (J.A. 379) —as the basis of DHS’s \ndecision to rescind DACA (J.A. 382-83), confirms that such decision is squarely \nthe decisionmaker expresses a ‘reviewable rationale’ . . . the decision to rescind the \nDACA program was not inherently such a decision . . . .”); J.A. 1382 (Regents, 279 \nF. Supp. 3d at 1031 n.7) (noting “the rescission of DACA was not such an \nunreviewable decision”). \n45 \n\nwithin the competence of this Court to review.  Whether or not the Government’s \nlegal conclusions were “not in accordance with the law” provides a judicially \nmanageable standard that allows a reviewing court to evaluate Plaintiffs’ APA \nclaims.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, \n177 (1803) (“It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to \nsay what the law is.”). \nIndeed, there is a fundamental inconsistency in the Government \nsimultaneously arguing that DACA was legally infirm and required rescission (J.A. \n379), and that DACA and its rescission were fully discretionary and thus immune \nfrom judicial review, Gov. Br. 16-22.  As Judge Bates found: “where an agency \nasserts that a nonenforcement policy is unlawful and then asserts ‘litigation risk’ as \na separate ground for the policy’s rescission, there are reasons to be more \nsuspicious.”  NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 233 (emphasis in original).  The District \nCourt below also noted this irreconcilable tension, citing it as further evidence in \nfavor of justiciability:  “Furthermore, it is important to note that the Government’s \nexplanation for rescinding DACA was the Secretary’s belief that the program was \nunlawful and would face lengthy legal challenges.”  (J.A. 1501).  See also J.A. 547 \n(Batalla Vidal, 295 F. Supp. 3d at 150) (“Instead, Defendants stated that they were \nrequired to rescind the DACA program because it was unlawful, which suggests \nboth that Defendants did not believe that they were exercising discretion when \n46 \n\nrescinding the program and that their reasons for doing so are within the \ncompetence of this court to review.”)). \nSecond, the Government’s brief fails to address the distinction between a \nprogrammatic determination that affected a class of persons and a decision whether \nto prosecute a particular person – a factor that was critical to the reasoning of all \nfour district courts that have found jurisdiction over the DACA rescission.  Where, \nas here, the Government bases a programmatic decision on its interpretation of the \nlaw, the decision is subject to judicial review.  See Crowley Caribbean Transp., \nInc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 676-77 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (distinguishing individual \nenforcement proceedings from “an agency’s statement of a general enforcement \npolicy [which] may be reviewable for legal sufficiency . . . .”) (emphasis in \noriginal); NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 232 (noting “general enforcement policies \nare exempt from Chaney’s presumption of unreviewability when they are \npredicated solely on the agency’s view of what the law requires”).14\n14  The Government’s proposed distinction between the reviewability of a \nsupporting rationale and the non-reviewability of an enforcement decision is \nunavailing.  See Gov. Br. 19-20 (citing UAW v. Brock, 783 F.2d 237 (D.C. Cir. \n1986) and Crowley, 37 F.3d at 675-76).  Rather, as Judge Bates recently reaffirmed \nin this context, when an enforcement policy is predicated on the agency’s view of \nwhat the law requires, that “agency action is not ‘non-reviewable’ in the first place \nif it is ‘based entirely on its interpretation of the statute.’”  NAACP v. Trump, No. \nCV 17-1907 (JDB), 2018 WL 3702588, at *8 n.9  (D.D.C. Aug. 3, 2018) (quoting \nCREW v. FEC, 892 F.3d 434, 441 n. 11) (emphasis added). \n47 \n\nFor this reason, the Government’s reliance on cases involving its exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion is misplaced.  The Government’s main case—Heckler v. \nChaney —involved a challenge by several prison inmates sentenced to death by \nlethal injection to the FDA’s decision not to commence an enforcement action \nagainst the drug manufacturers whose drugs were proposed to be used in the \nexecutions.  470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985).  Similarly, Speed Mining, Inc. v. Federal \nMine Safety and Health Review Commission involved a challenge to the Labor \nDepartment’s decision as to which party, among jointly and severally liable \npersons, to cite for a violation of the Mine Act.  528 F.3d 310, 313 (4th Cir. 2008).  \nBoth cases involved specific potential enforcement actions against specific \nidentified entities.  Chaney is further inapposite because it relied on the fact that \nplaintiffs in that case were attempting to obtain judicial review of an agency \ndecision not to act, which the Supreme Court carefully distinguished from an \nagency decision to act.  470 U.S. at 832 (“when an agency refuses to act it \ngenerally does not exercise its coercive power over an individual’s liberty or \nproperty rights . . . when an agency does act to enforce, that action itself provides a \nfocus for judicial review . . . .”) (emphasis in original).  As the D.C. Circuit held in \nRobbins v. Reagan: \nDecisions not to take enforcement action generally do not involve \nexercise of coercive power over individual’s liberty or property rights, \nand thus do not infringe upon areas that courts are called upon to \nprotect.  By contrast, rescissions of commitments, whether or not they \n48 \n\ntechnically implicate liberty and property interests as defined under \nthe  fifth  and  fourteenth  amendments,  exert  much  more  direct \ninfluence  on  the  individuals  or  entities  to  whom  the  repudiated \ncommitments were made . . . . Rescissions of prior obligations clearly \nfall  into  the  ‘forced  action’  category  [giving  courts  a]  specific \naffirmative action to be reviewed. \n780 F.2d 37, 47 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (emphasis in original).15  Here, Plaintiffs seek \njudicial review of an affirmative agency action rescinding commitments that have \nbeen made to DACA recipients, providing a clear focus for judicial review. \nSimilarly, the Government’s analogy of shifting priorities in prosecuting \ndrug crimes is inapt.  Gov. Br. 27.  The individualized considerations that go into \ncharging decisions are simply not present here with respect to the Government’s \ndecision to eliminate an entire program.  Unlike a charging decision that \nnecessarily involves a balancing of factors uniquely within the agency’s \nexpertise,16 here the Government concluded that it was without power to continue \n15 The Government disputes the relevance of Robbins because it “did not involve \nan exercise of enforcement discretion.”  Gov. Br. 26 n.3.  That is the point—in \nrescinding DACA, the Government, as in Robbins, refused to abide by a \n“previously agreed upon” commitment.  The Government also contends that this \ndistinction is unavailing because Speed Mining involved a decision “to act.”  Gov. \nBr. 25.  But the Government misconstrues the discretionary act in Speed Mining.  \nThere, the statute required the Labor Department to issue a citation if it believed \nthat a violation occurred, but was silent as to which party to cite – in other words, \nthe latter decision was within the agency’s discretion.  528 F.3d at 317.  When an \nagency does decide to “exercise[] its power in some manner,” as DHS did here, \nChaney instructs that the agency action is reviewable. \n16   Nor is there any evidence in the Administrative Record that the Government \nundertook such a balancing of factors in rescinding the DACA program. \n49 \n\nthe DACA program, under which it exercised its discretion, because the program \nwas legally infirm and required rescission.  (J.A. 379-84).  See also J.A. 547 \n(Batalla Vidal v. Duke, 295 F. Supp. 3d 127, 150 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (“This \naffirmative decision to constrain DHS’s prosecutorial discretion cannot be \nanalogized to an exercise of prosecutorial discretion . . . .”)).   \nMoreover, DACA was not merely a decision not to enforce immigration \nlaws, like the decision not to enforce drug laws in the Government’s analogy.  In \npromulgating DACA, the Government made affirmative promises and took \nproactive measures.  It actively encouraged individuals not lawfully present to \nreveal themselves to law enforcement authorities in exchange for select benefits.  \nIn other words, the Government did not merely look the other way while a \nviolation of immigration laws occurred, but openly encouraged the ongoing \nviolation.  The Government’s analogy ignores that DACA is not just a grant of \ndeferred action, but includes this exchange of benefits and burdens.   \n2. Section 1252(g) Does Not Strip the District Court of \nJurisdiction \nEvery court that has considered the Government’s argument that 8 U.S.C. § \n1252(g) forecloses judicial review, Gov. Br. 28-31, has properly rejected that \nproposition.  See J.A. 1501 (“the notion that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) precludes judicial \n50 \n\nreview has been rejected repeatedly”).17  The unanimous view of these courts is \ncorrect, as the Government’s position cannot be reconciled with the Supreme \nCourt’s interpretation of §1252(g) in AADC.  There, eight resident aliens \nchallenged their deportation on the grounds that it was politically motivated.  525 \nU.S. at 472. The Government took the position—similar to the position it takes \nhere—that §1252(g) precludes review of “all deportation-related claims” short of a \nfinal order of removal.  Id. at 506.  Based on the plain language of the provision, \nthe Supreme Court held that § 1252(g) “applies only to three discrete actions”:  the \n“decision or action” to (1) “commence proceedings,” (2) “adjudicate cases,” or (3) \n“execute removal orders.”  Id. at 482 (emphasis in original).  The Government \nconcedes that the decision to rescind DACA is not one of these “three discrete \nactions,” instead characterizing the rescission as “an ingredient to commencement \n17 See also J.A. 549-50 (Batalla Vidal, 295 F. Supp. 3d at 152) (“Nor does the INA \ndivest the court of jurisdiction to hear this case. … [8 U.S.C. § 1252(g)] has no \nbearing on these cases, which do not arise from one of the three specifically \nenumerated actions by immigration authorities that trigger application of the \nstatute.”)); Regents of Univ. of California, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1031–33 (“Nor does \nSection 1252(g) bar judicial review of the agency action in question.”); NAACP, \n298 F. Supp. 3d at 223–24 (“The government’s position contradicts not only the \nplain language of § 1252(g) but also the Supreme Court's interpretation of that \nlanguage in Reno v. American–Arab Anti–Discrimination Committee . . . . Because \nthe rescission of DACA is neither the commencement of a proceeding, the \nadjudication of a case, nor the execution of a removal order, § 1252(g) is \ninapplicable here pursuant to the provision’s plain language.”).  See also Texas v. \nUnited States, 809 F.3d 134, 156-63 (5th Cir. 2015) (holding Section 1252(g) did \nnot preclude judicial review of DAPA and that such an expansive reading of \nSection 1252(g) would render numerous other jurisdiction-stripping provisions of \nthe INA “superfluous”).    \n51 \n\nof removal.”  Gov. Br. 30-31 (emphasis added).  But, AADC expressly rejected the \nargument that ancillary “decisions or actions [in the] deportation process” are \nencompassed by the jurisdiction-stripping provision of § 1252(g).  AADC, 525 U.S. \nat 482. The Government again conflates the programmatic determination that \naffected a class of persons and a decision whether or not to commence proceedings \nagainst particular persons.  The rescission of DACA is no closer to the \ncommencement of removal proceedings than other ancillary actions, “such as the \ndecisions to open an investigation [or] to surveil that suspected violator,” that the \nSupreme Court found not covered in AADC.  Id.\nThe Supreme Court’s recent decision in Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. \n830 (2018), likewise rejects the Government’s position.  The plurality reaffirmed \nAADC’s narrow interpretation of § 1252(g), stating:   “We did not interpret this \nlanguage [in § 1252(g)] to sweep in any claim that can technically be said to ‘arise \nfrom’ the three listed actions of the Attorney General.  Instead, we read the \nlanguage to refer to just those three specific actions themselves.”  138 S. Ct. at 841.  \nPlaintiffs are not challenging a decision to commence proceedings against them, as \nno such decision has been made.  They are challenging the Government’s \ntermination of a Government-sponsored program pursuant to which roughly \n52 \n\n800,000 people, their families, employers, schools, and communities restructured \ntheir activities.  Section 1252 simply does not bar such challenges.18\nThe clear command of AADC and Jennings is that there are three—and only \nthree—circumstances under which § 1252(g) would preclude jurisdiction.   None \nof those circumstances is present here.  The Court should affirm the District \nCourt’s finding that the Plaintiffs’ claims are justiciable. \nII. THE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY ENJOINED THE \nGOVERNMENT FROM USING DACA APPLICANTS’ PERSONAL \nINFORMATION FOR ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES \nThe District Court below properly imposed an injunction to stop the \nGovernment from using for enforcement purposes personal information DACA \nrecipients provided during the application process.  DHS actively encouraged and \ninduced individuals to apply for DACA and to disclose personally-identifying \ninformation about themselves and family members by promising that such \ninformation would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes.  Since the \nchange in Administration, DHS has foresworn its promise to DACA applicants and \nsignaled its belief that it is free to renege on its representations if it chooses to do \nso by changing its information-sharing policy.  (J.A. 1004).  The District Court \ncorrectly recognized that the law prohibits the government from doing that.  \n18 The Government also argues that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) bars Plaintiffs’ claims.  \nGov. Br. 31.  This argument was not raised in the District Court, but in any event, \nit also fails because Section 1252(b) applies only to “review of an order of removal \nunder [§1252(a)(1)].”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b).  No such orders are at issue here. \n53 \n\nA. The Undisputed Record Below Demonstrated the \nAppropriateness for Injunctive Relief \nPlaintiffs presented evidence below—in the form of a Rule 56(c) Statement \nof Material Facts, as well as extensive affidavits and public record evidence—\nshowing that: \n•  the Government made unqualified representations to DACA applicants that \ninformation provided as part of their application would not be used for \nenforcement purposes.  (J.A. 473). \n• DACA applicants relied on this information.  (J.A. 526).   \n• the Government changed its information sharing policy.  (J.A. 531-1093).   \n• the Government had used (and could use) personal information in a manner \ninconsistent with its representations to DACA Applicants.  (J.A. 475). \n• such use did constitute (and could constitute) irreparable harm to recipients.  \n(J.A. 1516). \nAt no point did the Government provide its own statement of material facts in \ndispute under Rule 56(c) to contest Plaintiffs’ assertions.  Even after the District \nCourt provided notice to the Government that “it may grant summary judgment for \nthe nonmovants” pursuant to FRCP 56(f) (J.A. 1290), the Government still did not \nprovide a statement of material facts in dispute, nor did it contest Plaintiffs’ \nStatement of Material Facts.  Indeed, at oral argument, when the District Court \nasked the Government if it was prepared to state that it had no intention of \n“changing the information-sharing assurances that were given in connection with \nDACA,” the Government refused to make this commitment, explicitly reserving \n54 \n\nthe right to use for enforcement purposes the information voluntarily provided by \nDreamers.  (J.A. 1307-08). \nBased on the record before it, the District Court issued an injunction barring \nthe Government from changing its policy on information sharing.  In particular, the \nDistrict Court found the Government “induced these immigrants to share their \npersonal information under the guise of immigration protections” and the “use of \nthat same information to track and remove them . . . potentially would be \n‘affirmative misconduct’ by the [G]overnment.”  (J.A. 1516).  Thus, with the \nGovernment’s refusal “to provide any assurance that the Government would not \nmake changes [to the information sharing policy],” the District Court enjoined the \nGovernment from making any such changes “given the substantial risk for \nirreparable harm in using Dreamers’ DACA-provided information. . . . for \nenforcement purposes.”  Id. at 1516-17.  \nThis evidence more than satisfies the traditional elements of estoppel: (1) the \nGovernment, and not the DACA recipients, “knew the true facts” regarding the \nGovernment’s intentions with regard to the personal information; (2) the \nGovernment intended its promises regarding personal information “to be acted \nupon or acted in such a way that” the DACA recipients “had a right to believe that \nit was intended;” (3) the DACA recipients were “ignorant of the true facts” \nregarding the Government’s intention to use their personal information for \n55 \n\nenforcement purposes; and (4) the Government’s “misconduct was relied upon to \nthe detriment of” the DACA recipients.  Dawkins v. Witt, 318 F.3d 606, 611 n.6 \n(4th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 960 (2003) (noting “affirmative \nmisconduct” must also be found to estop the government).19  Having failed to \ncontest these facts before the District Court, the Government cannot assert on \nappeal that the District Court abused its discretion in barring the Government from \nchanging its information sharing policy.     \nIndeed, the Government challenges only one element of estoppel, asserting \nthat the claim fails because, in the absence of a finding that the information policy \nhas changed, the “district court’s speculation fails to satisfy the requirement of \n‘affirmative misconduct,’” and relatedly that Plaintiffs have not shown irreparable \nharm.  Gov. Br. 67.  The Government’s arguments are wrong. \nThe District Court, “based on the evidence before it,” correctly found the \nGovernment’s retention of DACA applicants’ personal information, combined with \nits refusal to commit to not using that information for enforcement purposes, \npresented “substantial risk for irreparable harm” and constituted “affirmative \nmisconduct” sufficient to satisfy even the heightened requirements for finding \n19 The District Court, citing Chawla v. Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co., 440 \nF.3d 639, 646 (4th Cir. 2006), described equitable estoppel as comprising “three \nbasic elements: (1) a voluntary misrepresentation of one party, (2) that is relied on \nby the other party, (3) to the other party’s detriment.”  J.A. 1514-15.  While \nChawla applied Maryland’s equitable estoppel law, it presents no meaningful \ndistinction from the Fourth Circuit’s familiar test espoused in Dawkins.  \n56 \n\nestoppel against the Government.  (J.A. 1515-16).  This easily comports with the \nSupreme Court’s determination that “[a]n allegation of future injury may suffice \n[for Article III standing] if . . . there is a ‘substantial risk’ that the harm will occur.”  \nSusan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341 (2014); see also N.C. \nState Conference of NAACP v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections, 283 F. Supp. 3d 393, \n399 (M.D.N.C. 2017) (“When a plaintiff seeks redress for a prospective harm, the \nplaintiff can demonstrate that an alleged injury is sufficiently imminent for \nstanding purposes by showing . . . that the plaintiff faces a ‘substantial risk’ of its \noccurrence.”).  The District Court made this finding.   \nThis Court has recently recognized that “fear and risk of future arrest” based \non “a credible threat of prosecution” satisfies “the injury-in-fact requirement for \nprospective relief.” Kenny v. Wilson, 885 F.3d 280, 288 (4th Cir. 2018); see also \nCapital Associated Indus. v. Stein, 283 F. Supp. 3d 374, 380 (M.D.N.C. 2017), \nappeal filed, 17-2218 (4th Cir. Oct. 18, 2017) (recognizing that plaintiffs bringing \na “‘pre-enforcement challenge”’ “‘need not . . . be proactively threatened with \nprosecution”’ when “‘the State has not disclaimed any intention of enforcing the \nchallenged statute”’).   Here, the Government affirmatively maintains that the \nrescission of DACA is “an ingredient to the commencement of removal.”  Gov. Br. \n30-31.  Thus, the Government cannot now assert that Plaintiffs do not face a \ncredible threat of being subject to an immigration enforcement action. \n57 \n\nThe District Court likewise recognized that the “use [of DACA applicants’ \npersonal information] to track and remove them would result in irreparable harm to \nthose deported.  (J.A. 1516).  It is “self-evident” both that removal constitutes \nirreparable harm and that detrimental reliance on the Government’s representations \n—that information provided would not be used for such enforcement purposes— \nconstitutes affirmative misconduct.  Id.  In fact, the Government does not contest \neither proposition.  Nor could it.  This Court has found sufficient affirmative \nmisconduct to justify estoppel against the Government on arguably far less \negregious facts.  See U.S. v. Cox, 964 F.2d 1431, 1434-35 (4th Cir. 1992) (finding \nthat the Government was estopped from reneging on a commitment to pay the \ncosts of a psychiatric examination of an inmate in a federal prison). \nThe Government’s efforts to raise for the first time before this Court \narguments it did not present to the District Court that past statements regarding the \ninformation-sharing policy “be converted into ‘misrepresentation[s] for purposes \nof equitable estoppel” (Gov. Br. 68) are, of course, too little, too late.  But even if \nthe Government’s arguments were not procedurally barred, they are without merit.  \nThe Government’s suggestion that the potential modification language gives it the \nright years later to go back on its word to those who relied on it makes no sense \nwhen considered in the context in which the DACA policy was promulgated.  The \nGovernment encouraged DACA-eligible candidates to apply for that program’s \n58 \n\nbenefits, and its success in getting hundreds of thousands of individuals to apply \nwould not have been possible without its promise not to use their personal \nidentifying information for enforcement purposes.  It makes no sense for the \nGovernment, at the same time, to be telling those applicants that the promise was \nworthless, and may be broken at any time.   \nThe Government’s argument is also inconsistent with the underlying factual \nrecord, which contains documents made available to the public, including DACA \napplicants and enrollees, lacking the disclaimer that the Government could share \ninformation proactively or change its policy at any time.  (J.A. 1090).  Moreover, \nas the Northern District of California found, to the extent the Government actually \nprovided the “disclaimer,” at most it preserved the Government’s ability to change \nits policy prospectively after providing adequate notice—not to do so retroactively.  \nSee J.A. 1417-18 (Regents, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 1312) (potential modification \nlanguage “simply allows the government to change its policy in connection with \nfuture applicants.”) \nFinally, the Supreme Court has rejected the Government’s argument that \nthere is a per se rule barring estoppel against the Government.  Compare Gov. Br. \n68 with Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 423 (1990) \n(declining to adopt a “sweeping rule” establishing that “no estoppel [claim could \never succeed] against the Government”).  Contrary to the Government’s view, it \n59 \n\ncan be estopped where, as here, the Government acts in a manner that violates “the \ninterest of citizens in some minimum standard of decency, honor, and reliability in \ntheir dealing with the Government,” Heckler v. Cmty. Health Servs. of Crawford \nCty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 60-61 (1984), or where “justice and fair play require it . . . \n.”  Watkins v. U.S. Army, 875 F.2d 699, 706 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. \n957 (1990) (citations omitted); Cox, 964 F.2d at 1435.      \nThe District Court correctly recognized that DACA applicants gave the \nGovernment their personal information for a specific use, and estoppel was \nappropriate to ensure the government only uses their information for its authorized \nuse.      \nB. The District Court Acted Within its Discretion in Enjoining the \nGovernment From Changing Its Information-Sharing Policy \nWith Respect to All DACA Applicants  \nAs a threshold matter, the Government does not contend that the District \nCourt erred in finding that the requisite elements for an injunction are present here; \nrather, it only argues that the scope of the District Court’s injunction is overbroad.  \nId. at 69-73.20  Specifically, the Government contends that the nationwide scope of \n20  The factors for a permanent injunction are:  “(1) that [a plaintiff] has suffered an \nirreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, \nare inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of \nhardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and \n(4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.”  \nChristopher Phelps & Assocs., LLC v. Galloway, 492 F.3d 532, 543 (4th Cir. \n2007).  Except as addressed above in its estoppel arguments, the Government does \nnot contest that these factors have been met.  \n60 \n\nthe injunction “violate[s] the requirements of Article III and equity” because the \nrelief granted is not plaintiff-specific.  Gov. Br. 69.  This argument is unavailing. \nThe District Court enjoys “broad discretion when fashioning injunctive \nrelief,” Ostergren v. Cuccinelli, 615 F.3d 263, 268 (4th Cir. 2010), and is vested \nwith “the judicial Power of the United States” which applies to the Government \nand extends nationwide.  U.S. CONST. art. III, § 1; see also City of Chicago v. \nSessions, 888 F.3d 272, 289-90 (7th Cir. 2018) (upholding a nationwide injunction \nand recognizing “the district court had the authority to fashion the terms of that \ninjunction as it determined necessary for the public interest . . . .”).   \nThe District Court was well within its discretion in granting a nationwide \ninjunction in light of the facts of this case.  Plaintiffs reside throughout the United \nStates and include organizations that serve communities in the Second, Third, \nFourth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits and that had organizational and \nassociational standing to pursue this litigation.  (J.A. 1503).  Accordingly, \nnationwide relief is well within the power of the District Court.  See Richmond \nTenants Org. v. Kemp, 956 F.2d 1300, 1308 (4th Cir. 1992); see also Madsen v. \nWomen’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (where plaintiffs reside \nthroughout the country, only a nationwide injunction can provide “complete relief \nto the plaintiffs”).  “[F]or issues of widespread national impact, a nationwide \ninjunction” can “be beneficial in terms of . . . avoidance of irreparable harm and in \n61 \n\nfurtherance of the public interest.”  City of Chicago, 888 F.3d at 288.  For this \nreason, the Government’s reliance on Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916 (2018), \nGov. Br. 70, is inapt —a broader injunction was unnecessary to ensure the \nplaintiffs relief in that case; however, here to ensure adequate protection a broader \nremedy is required.   \nThe need for national uniformity in the application of immigration laws also \nfavors a nationwide injunction.  See Texas v. U.S., 809 F. 3d at 187-88 (upholding \na nationwide injunction on the DAPA program due to the need for immigration \nlaws to be “enforced vigorously and uniformly”) (emphasis in original).21  This \ncase is also well-suited to a nationwide injunction because the Government’s \nmisuse of Dreamers’ personal information “presents purely a narrow issue of law; \nit is not fact dependent and will not vary from one locality to another.”  City of \nChicago, 888 F.3d at 291-92.  Indeed, one of the cases the Government cites \nsupports Plaintiffs’ position.  In Virginia Society for Human Life, Inc. v. Federal \nElection Com’n, 263 F.3d 379, 392-93 (4thCir. 2001), this Court found that a \nnationwide injunction was overly broad because an injunction addressing the sole \nplaintiff in the case “adequately protects it.”  But the Court contrasted that situation \n21 Moreover, DHS has not demonstrated that it has the capacity to ensure that prior \nto using DACA applicant’s information for enforcement purposes, it “would \ninquire . . . into whether [an applicant] was among the named plaintiffs or a \nmember of” one of the organizationalplaintiffs.  Easyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. v. \nHannigan, 92 F.3d 1486, 1502 (9th Cir. 1996).   \n62 \n\nto a circumstance where plaintiffs were seeking relief “from across the country,” \nwhere a nationwide injunction “was appropriate.”  Id., citing Richmond Tenants \nOrg., 956 F.2d at 1302.  Those are precisely the facts here: Plaintiffs include \nindividual members and organizations throughout the country who can obtain \nrelief only through a nationwide injunction.  Accordingly, the District Court did \nnot abuse its discretion in issuing a nationwide injunction.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed in this brief and in Plaintiffs’ Opening Brief, this \nCourt should reverse the District Court’s decision with respect to Plaintiffs’ APA \nand constitutional claims, remand with instructions for discovery to commence and \nthe Government to complete the Administrative Record, and affirm the District \nCourt’s permanent, nationwide injunction on Plaintiffs’ estoppel claim. \nDated:  August 31, 2018    Respectfully submitted, \n/s/  John A.

At the time the DACA policy was \nimplemented in 2012, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a \n“frequently asked questions (FAQ)” webpage that included guidance stating that \ninformation would be “protected from disclosure to” U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection “for the purpose of \nimmigration enforcement proceedings,” except that information could be disclosed \nwhere the criteria for issuance of a Notice to Appear are satisfied (for example, where \nnational security, public safety, or significant criminal activity interests are implicated). \nU.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs. (USCIS), Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \nFrequently Asked Questions, No. 19 (DHS DACA FAQ 19), https://go.usa.gov/xngCd \n(last visited Sept. 12, 2018); see also id. (explaining that information may be used for \ncertain purposes other than removal). Notably, this policy was subject to the \nsignificant caveat that the policy “may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any \ntime.” DHS DACA FAQ 19. \nIn our cross-appeal opening brief, the government demonstrated that the \ndistrict court erroneously employed a free-floating “equitable estoppel” theory to \nenjoin preemptively any potential modification of this information-sharing policy. \n \n\nPlaintiffs’ cross-appeal response brief fails to overcome the myriad flaws in the district \ncourt’s holding. First, there is no affirmative cause of action for equitable estoppel \nagainst the government, and plaintiffs identify no legal basis for inferring one. Second, \neven if such a claim did exist, plaintiffs concede it would require a showing of \naffirmative misconduct, but any potential change in the policy would not be \nmisconduct given that DHS expressly reserved the right to modify or even rescind the \npolicy at any time, a reservation of rights that must be given effect. Third, even if it \nwould be affirmative misconduct to change the policy, the policy has not in fact \nchanged, plaintiffs have failed to show otherwise, and DHS’s mere refusal to commit \nthat it will not change the policy in the future does not, contrary to plaintiffs’ \nsuggestion, even support their standing to sue now, let alone constitute affirmative \nmisconduct. No other court has accepted plaintiffs’ freestanding equitable estoppel \ntheory, and this Court should not either. The district court’s injunction should be \nvacated.  \nAt a minimum, the scope of the nationwide relief issued by the district court \nreaches far too broadly. Plaintiffs’ cross-appeal response brief fails to refute the \ngovernment’s showing that bedrock principles of standing and equitable discretion \nrequire, at the very least, limiting the scope of any injunction to plaintiffs and their \nDACA-recipient members.  \n2 \n \n\nARGUMENT \nThe District Court’s Nationwide Injunction Should Be Vacated, or, at a \nMinimum, Limited to the Parties Before the Court. \nA.  The district court erred in relying on an equitable estoppel theory \nto enjoin the government from changing its information-sharing \npolicy. \n1. As explained in the government’s cross-appeal opening brief (at 68-69), and \nrecognized by the Supreme Court, there is a “substantial” question as to whether \nequitable estoppel could ever apply against the federal government. Heckler v. \nCommunity Health Servs., 467 U.S. 51, 60 (1984); see also OPM v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, \n423 (1990). And plaintiffs make no attempt to explain how a freestanding equitable \nestoppel claim can exist, given that only Congress can create a “private right[] of \naction to enforce federal law.” Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286 (2001). \nPlaintiffs simply note (as we acknowledged) that the Supreme Court has reserved the \nquestion whether estoppel might ever apply against the government. Resp. Br. 59-60. \nBut plaintiffs cannot dispute that the Supreme Court has never applied principles of \nequitable estoppel against the government, let alone allowed such a theory to provide \na freestanding cause of action.  \nPlaintiffs’ reliance (Resp. Br. 60) on Community Health Services fails to advance \ntheir claim. In that case, the Supreme Court declined to apply principles of equitable \nestoppel. 467 U.S. at 60-61. And although the Court there left open the possibility \nthat an equitable estoppel claim might be available if necessary to maintain “minimum \n3 \n \n\nstandard[s] of decency, honor, and reliability in [individuals’] dealing with the[] \ngovernment,” id., that was in the context of equitable estoppel as a defense against \ngovernment action. Contrary to plaintiffs’ suggestion, the Court nowhere suggested in \nCommunity Health Services that a plaintiff might bring a freestanding claim to enjoin a \ngovernment policy on the ground that the policy decision was not “decent” enough, \nand Alexander v. Sandoval squarely forecloses implying such a cause of action. The \ngovernment’s policies may be subject to statutory or constitutional constraints; but \nthe district court did not find a constitutional or statutory problem with respect to the \ninformation-sharing policy. JA.1514-15. The district court instead imposed a free-\nfloating additional constraint on the government’s policy decisions. This was error: \n“the government should not be unduly hindered from changing its position if that \nshift is the result of a change in public policy.” United States v. Owens, 54 F.3d 271, 275 \n(6th Cir. 1995). \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on United States v. Cox, 964 F.2d 1431, 1434-35 (4th Cir. \n1992), is also misplaced. See Resp. Br. 58. That case involved the question of which \npart of the federal government (the federal defender’s office or the Department of \nJustice) would pay for a psychiatric examination, and this Court simply followed the \nguidelines promulgated by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Cox, \n964 F.2d at 1433.  \n2. Even assuming there were a freestanding cause of action for equitable \nestoppel against the government, “it is well settled that the Government may not be \n4 \n \n\nestopped on the same terms as any other litigant.” Community Health Servs., 467 U.S. at \n60. As plaintiffs acknowledge, Resp. Br. 55-56, an estoppel claim against the \ngovernment requires a showing of “affirmative misconduct.” Dawkins v. Witt, 318 \nF.3d 606, 611 (4th Cir. 2003) (collecting cases). And, as the Tenth Circuit has \nexplained, assuming equitable estoppel may lie against the government, there is “an \nextremely high bar to claims of equitable estoppel against the government, particularly \nin the immigration context.” Kowalczyk v. INS, 245 F.3d 1143, 1150 (10th Cir. 2001). \nPlaintiffs’ contention that the district court “correctly found” that the \ngovernment’s behavior “constituted ‘affirmative misconduct’” is without basis in the \nrecord. Resp. Br. 56. Any potential change in the information policy could not \nconstitute affirmative misconduct. From the outset of the DACA policy, the \ngovernment expressly stated that the information-sharing policy “may be modified, \nsuperseded, or rescinded at any time.” DHS DACA FAQ 19. It cannot be affirmative \nmisconduct to change a policy that was expressly subject to change from its inception \n(as explained below, the policy has not, in fact, been changed, infra p. 7-9). To hold \notherwise would render the reservation of rights without effect and could deter the \ngovernment from publicly announcing internal policies in the first place.1   \n                                                 \n1 Without elaboration or citation, plaintiffs appear to suggest (Resp. Br. 58) that \nthe government failed to argue below that the information-sharing policy was always \nsubject to modification, but that suggestion is belied by the record. See JA.1280.   \n5 \n \n\nPlaintiffs are also wrong to assert that the government’s 2012 statement that \nthe information-sharing policy could be modified at any time applied only to future \nDACA requestors, not to those who requested DACA under the original policy. Resp. \nBr. 59. The policy’s reservation of rights that it could be modified or rescinded “at any \ntime” and “without notice” unambiguously applies to those who had already requested \nand received deferred action under DACA, as there would be no meaningful reason \nto include those caveats for those who had not yet requested DACA in the first place. \nPlaintiffs assert that it would “make[] no sense for the Government” to have \nencouraged individuals to request deferred action under DACA while simultaneously \ntelling them the policy regarding the sharing of their information could be rescinded \nat any time. Resp. Br. 58-59. But it makes perfect sense both that the Government \nwould not wish to bind itself to a particular policy even as to existing DACA \nrecipients and that individuals without lawful status were willing to request deferred \naction under DACA even on those terms.  \nIndeed, the district court implicitly acknowledged that the policy’s reservation \nof rights applied to plaintiffs. In its order, the court ordered the government to \ncomply with its information-sharing policy except that “the language in the Policy \nspecifying that it ‘may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without \nnotice’ is hereby ENJOINED pending further order of this Court or relief on \nappeal.” JA.1532-33. If that language did not apply to plaintiffs, there would be no \npoint in enjoining its application. \n6 \n \n\n3. Even assuming plaintiffs are correct that changing the information-sharing \npolicy would amount to affirmative misconduct sufficient to subject the government \nto an equitable estoppel claim, the information-sharing policy has not in fact changed, \nand the government’s mere refusal to commit to never changing the policy cannot \nconstitute affirmative misconduct. Nor have plaintiffs demonstrated standing to sue \nunder this theory.  \nThe government’s information-sharing policy has not changed. As explained, at \nthe time of DACA’s implementation, recipients were informed that information \nwould be “protected from disclosure . . . for the purpose of immigration enforcement \nproceedings,” subject to exceptions where the criteria for issuance of a Notice to \nAppear are satisfied (for example, where national security, public safety, or significant \ncriminal activity interests are implicated). DHS DACA FAQ 19; USCIS, Revised \nGuidance for the Referral of Cases and Issuance of Notices to Appear (NTAs) (Nov. 7, 2011), \nhttps://go.usa.gov/xncPK (last visited Sept. 12, 2018); USCIS, Guidance for the Referral \nof Cases and Issuance of Notices to Appear (NTAs) (June 28, 2018), \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/2018/ \n2018-06-28-PM-602-0161-DACA-Notice-to-Appear.pdf (last visited Sept. 12, 2018). \nNothing in the Acting Secretary’s memorandum rescinding the DACA policy changes \nthat approach—in fact, the memorandum makes no reference to information sharing \nat all, a point the district court recognized, JA.1505 n.24. And DHS had made clear in \nadditional guidance issued after the rescission that “[t]his information-sharing policy \n7 \n \n\nhas not changed in any way since it was first announced, including as a result of the Sept. \n5, 2017 memo starting a wind-down of the DACA policy.” USCIS, Guidance on Rejected \nDACA Requests Q5 (Dec. 27, 2017) (emphasis added), www.uscis.gov/daca2017/ \nguidance-rejected-daca2017 (last visited Sept. 12, 2018). In fact, even the district court \nappeared to recognize that the policy had not changed; rather it faulted the \ngovernment for being “unable to provide any assurance that the Government would \nnot make changes” in the future. JA.1516; see also JA.1528 (enjoining the provision in \nthe information-sharing policy permitting modification of that policy).  \nIn response, plaintiffs point to several record items that they contend \ndemonstrate that the information-sharing policy has changed. Although plaintiffs \nprovide numerous record citations, Resp. Br. 54, the referenced documents fail to \nsupport plaintiffs’ contentions. For example, JA.475 references increased deportations \nand makes a cross-citation to the fact that the rescission memorandum did not itself \nreiterate the information-sharing policy. But neither of these facts indicate that any \nchange in policy has occurred, especially in light of DHS’s later public affirmation that \nthe policy has not changed. USCIS, Guidance on Rejected DACA Requests Q5 (Dec. 27, \n2017), www.uscis.gov/daca2017/guidance-rejected-daca2017. Plaintiffs also point out \nthat one description of the information-sharing policy was slightly reworded in DHS’s \n2017 FAQs concerning the rescission of the DACA policy. JA.75-76. But the addition \nof the word “generally” to the FAQ does not have the meaning plaintiffs ascribe—it \nwas always the case that information received from DACA requestors could be used \n8 \n \n\nby DHS in certain circumstances connected with enforcement proceedings, and \nnothing in the revised FAQ suggests that “special” or “non-proactive” releases will \nhenceforth be allowed when they would not previously have been permitted. See DHS \nDACA FAQ 19.  \nInstead of finding existing affirmative misconduct by the government, allegedly \nin the form of a change in policy, the district court relied on its conjecture that “[l]ogic \nwould dictate that it is possible that the government . . . could now use . . .  information \nto track and remove [DACA recipients]. This potentially would be ‘affirmative \nmisconduct’ by the government.” JA.1516 (emphases added). Plaintiffs have pointed \nto no case, and the government is aware of none, in which speculation about \n“potential” affirmative misconduct in the future would suffice to establish an \nequitable estoppel claim now. And plaintiffs have not presented any basis upon which \nto conclude that the government has any imminent plans to change its policy.  \nMore fundamentally, as pointed out in the government’s cross-appeal opening \nbrief (at 67), given the lack of a district court finding concerning any current or imminent \nchange of policy, plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claim fails to satisfy the requirements of \nboth standing, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 563 (1992), and irreparable \nharm, eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). Indeed, the mere fact \nthat the government declined to commit not to change the policy does not even \ndemonstrate a “substantial risk” that it will change the policy.  Resp. Br. 57 (quoting \nSusan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341 (2014)). Plaintiffs confuse \n9 \n \n\nmatters in relying on this Court’s precedent concerning a “credible threat of \nprosecution” under immigration laws generally. See id. (quoting Kenny v. Wilson, 885 \nF.3d 280, 288 (4th Cir. 2018)). In determining whether relief with respect to the \ninformation-sharing policy is appropriate, the question is whether plaintiffs have put \nforth any plausible contention that their information is likely to be shared in a way \nthat conflicts with the information-sharing policy. Whether plaintiffs face a “credible \nthreat of being subject to an immigration enforcement action,” as plaintiffs contend \n(Resp. Br. 57), is not relevant to the question whether plaintiffs have an imminent \ninjury stemming from the government’s information-sharing policy.  \nAnd plaintiffs cannot evade their failure to show an actual change in policy by \nsuggesting that the affirmative misconduct here is the mere refusal to commit not to \nchange the policy. Plaintiffs assert (Resp. Br. 56) that in obtaining information from \nDACA requestors (the information necessary to determine whether the requestors \nmet DACA’s guidelines) and “refus[ing] to commit to not us[e] that information for \nenforcement purposes,” the government engaged in affirmative misconduct. But, the \ngovernment’s unwillingness to commit to never changing that policy is not \nmisconduct: it is simply a recognition that government policies may change—a fact \nabout which potential DACA recipients were expressly made aware. See supra p. 5-6.  \nB.   The district court erred in granting nationwide relief. \nFor the reasons explained above, the district court’s injunction is erroneous and \nshould be vacated. But at a minimum, as explained in the government’s cross-appeal \n10 \n \n\nopening brief (at 69-72), the court’s injunction should be limited to the parties before \nit. In granting nationwide relief broader than necessary to redress any cognizable \ninjuries of the plaintiffs, the district court violated the requirements of Article III and \nprinciples of equity.  \n1. As an initial matter, plaintiffs completely ignore the government’s showing \n(Br. 72) that granting a nationwide injunction in these circumstances creates an \ninequitable result that the law should not and does not permit. Plaintiffs in other suits \nchallenging the rescission of the DACA policy have attempted to obtain relief barring \nthe government from changing its information-sharing policy on an equitable estoppel \ntheory. No other plaintiffs have succeeded. Yet all of those unsuccessful plaintiffs will \nbenefit from the district court’s injunction here. At the same time, plaintiffs here are \nnot bound by the dismissal of the equitable estoppel claims in the other lawsuits \nchallenging the rescission of the DACA policy. Under plaintiffs’ theory, litigants may \nbring suit in multiple district courts, secure in the knowledge that all will benefit if \neven one suit succeeds, and none will be bound by suits that fail.  \nThis result is untenable, as voices throughout the federal judiciary have \nrecognized. As Justice Thomas recently explained, nationwide injunctions “take a toll \non the federal court system—preventing legal questions from percolating through the \nfederal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national \nemergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch.” Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. \n2392, 2425 (Thomas, J., concurring); see also City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 298 \n11 \n \n\n(7th Cir. 2018) (Manion, J., dissenting in part) (criticizing the “one-way-ratchet” \ncreated by nationwide injunctions), reh’g en banc granted, 2018 WL 4268817 (7th Cir. \nJune 4, 2018) (vacating panel judgment “insofar as it sustained the district court’s \ndecision to extend preliminary relief nationwide”), reh’g en banc vacated as moot, 2018 WL \n4268814 (7th Cir. Aug. 10, 2018).  \n2. Ignoring the fundamental inequity of their approach, plaintiffs argue that the \ndistrict court correctly exercised its discretion to grant nationwide relief “in light of \nthe facts of this case.” Resp. Br. 61. Plaintiffs erroneously contend that because they \nreside, and provide services to residents, in various parts of the United States, a \nnationwide injunction is required. Id.  \nAs the government explained in its cross-appeal opening brief (at 70-71), a \n“plaintiff’s remedy must be ‘limited to the inadequacy that produced [his] injury in \nfact.’ ” Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1930 (2018) (alteration in original) (quoting \nLewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996)); see also Virginia Soc’y for Human Life, Inc. v. \nFEC, 263 F.3d 379, 393 (4th Cir. 2001) (explaining that that an injunction covering \nthe plaintiff alone would “adequately protec[t] it,” and that preventing enforcement of \nthe regulation “against other parties in other circuits does not provide any additional \nrelief ” to the plaintiff). Although plaintiffs assert that “a broader remedy is required” \nhere “to ensure adequate protection,” Br. 62, the mere fact that they purport to \n12 \n \n\nrepresent DACA recipients throughout the United States does not explain how their \ninjuries are remedied by further extending relief to other, unrelated DACA recipients.2  \nIn attempting to paint nationwide relief as the default, plaintiffs rely to a great \nextent on the Seventh Circuit’s decision in City of Chicago, overlooking the fact that, as \nnoted above, see supra p. 12, the panel’s decision in that case was subsequently vacated \nwhen the court granted rehearing en banc on whether the nationwide scope of the \ninjunction in that case was proper. Although the Seventh Circuit subsequently vacated \nits order granting rehearing en banc on mootness grounds, that order does not \nresurrect the panel decision or eliminate the significant problems with nationwide \ninjunctions that caused the Seventh Circuit to decide to hear the case en banc in the \nfirst place.  \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on Richmond Tenants Organization, Inc. v. Kemp, 956 F.2d 1300, \n1308 (4th Cir. 1992), fares no better. See Resp. Br. 61. To the extent that decision \nextended relief to numerous individuals not before the court and entirely unrelated to \nthe parties before it, it is inconsistent with subsequent Supreme Court precedent \n                                                 \n2 In a footnote, plaintiffs suggest that “DHS has not demonstrated that it has \nthe capacity” to ascertain whether a given DACA recipient would be covered by an \ninjunction limited to those purportedly represented by plaintiffs. Resp. Br. 62 n.21. \nBut this argument improperly shifts the burden, as it is plaintiffs who must \ndemonstrate why relief going beyond their own injuries is necessary. Moreover, \nalthough the record is thus undeveloped on the issue, there does not appear to be any \nlogical or operational reason that DHS would be unable to comply with a plaintiff-\nspecific injunction, and even if there were, DHS could always choose to extend the \nsame treatment to non-plaintiffs to whatever extent was necessary to ensure its \ncompliance with a properly tailored, plaintiff-specific injunction. \n13 \n \n\nmaking clear that a remedy must be limited to the injury of the plaintiffs. See Gill, 138 S. \nCt. at 1930. Indeed, although plaintiffs also invoke Madsen v. Women’s Health Center, \nInc., 512 U.S. 753 (1994), that case reaffirmed that an injunction should be no broader \nthan necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs, and it nowhere suggested \nthat this entailed a universal injunction merely because plaintiffs are geographically \ndispersed. Id. at 765. \nFinally, plaintiffs argue that a nationwide injunction is appropriate here to \nmaintain uniform enforcement of the immigration laws. Resp. Br. 62. But the \nrequirements of Article III and equity that limit overbroad injunctions apply equally in \nthe immigration context, and nothing in federal immigration law even arguably \nrequires that the same exact information-sharing policy that applies to the DACA \nrecipients purportedly represented by plaintiffs must also be applied to all other \nDACA recipients in the country. \n   \n14 \n \n\nCONCLUSION \nThe district court’s permanent injunction should be vacated, or, at a minimum, \nrestricted to the parties before this Court. \nRespectfully submitted, \n  JOSEPH H.

On  March  12,  2018,  Judge  Titus  granted  in  part  and  denied  in  part \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.  Memorandum \nOrder, ECF No. 46, amended by ECF No. 49 (Mar. 15, 2018).  On appeal, the Fourth Circuit \naffirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, dismissed in part, and remanded.  Judgment, \nECF No. 83, published at Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 924 F.3d 684 (4th \nCir. 2019). \nThe Fourth Circuit held that “the Department’s decision to rescind DACA was arbitrary \nand capricious and must be set aside.”  Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 924 \nF.3d at 705.  Therefore, the Fourth Circuit “reverse[d] the district court’s ruling sustaining the \nrescission of the policy as valid under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)” and “vacated [DACA’s rescission] \nas  arbitrary  and  capricious.”    Id.  at  706.    Likewise,  in  separate  challenges  to  the  DACA \nrescission, on June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court held that the rescission of DACA “was arbitrary \nand capricious in violation of the APA.”  Dep't of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-PWG   Document 97   Filed 07/17/20   Page 2 of 4\nCalifornia, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915 (2020).  The DACA rescission occurred on September 5, 2017.  \nSee Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 924 F.3d at 693–94.  Therefore, the \nFourth Circuit explained that its Judgment vacating the DACA rescission “restores DACA to its \npre-September 5, 2017, status . . . .”  Id. at 706. \nPlaintiffs also challenged the September 5, 2017 changes to DACA’s information-sharing \npolicy  and  requested  an  injunction  based  on  equitable  estoppel.    Judge  Titus  granted  the \ninjunction, but the Fourth Circuit held that “Plaintiffs could not reasonably believe that the \ninformation  they  provided  as  part  of  their  DACA  application  would  never  be  used  for \nimmigration enforcement purposes” and “Plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claim thus necessarily \nfails.”  Id. at 705–06.  Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit “reverse[d] the district court’s ruling \nfinding Plaintiffs entitled to injunctive relief on equitable estoppel grounds, reverse[d] the grant \nof  summary  judgment  in  Plaintiffs’  favor,  and  vacate[d]  the  injunction.”    Id.  at  706.  \nNonetheless,  the  Fourth  Circuit  explained  that  its  decision  “restor[ing]  DACA  to  its  pre-\nSeptember 5, 2017, status, render[ed] a nullity the information-sharing policies announced on \nSeptember 5.”  Id. at 706. \nFinally, the Fourth Circuit dismissed Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.  The Fourth Circuit \n“decline[d] to decide whether DACA’s rescission violates the Fifth Amendment’s due process \nand equal protection guarantees under the ‘well established principle governing the prudent \nexercise of this [c]ourt’s jurisdiction that normally the [c]ourt will not decide a constitutional \nquestion  if  there  is  some  other  ground  upon  which  to  dispose  of  the  case.’”   Id.  (quoting \nEscambia Cty. v. McMillan, 466 U.S. 48, 51 (1984) (per curiam)) (alterations in original).  The \nFourth  Circuit  “also  decline[d]  to  decide  whether  Plaintiffs’  Fifth  Amendment  rights  were \nviolated by the policies announced on September 5, 2017, regarding the sharing of personal \n  2    \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-PWG   Document 97   Filed 07/17/20   Page 3 of 4\ninformation  from  DACA  applicants”  given  that  its  decision  “render[ed]  a  nullity  the \ninformation-sharing policies announced on September 5.”  Id.  Therefore, the Fourth Circuit \n“vacate[d] the district court’s judgment on these issues and dismiss[ed] those claims.”  Id. at \n706–07. \nThe Fourth Circuit remanded this case to this Court for further proceedings consistent \nwith  its  Judgment.    Id.    Based  on  the  foregoing,  all  of  the  issues  in  this  case  have  been \ndetermined.  Therefore, in accordance with the Judgment of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nECF No. 83, and the Supreme Court’s decision in Dep't of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. \nof California, 140 S. Ct. 1891 (2020), it is this 17th day of July, 2020, by the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Maryland, hereby ORDERED that: \n1.  The Court ADJUDGES AND DECLARES that the DACA rescission and actions \ntaken by Defendants to rescind the DACA policy are arbitrary and capricious, in \nviolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A);1  \n \n2.  The rescission of the DACA policy is VACATED, and the policy is restored to its \npre-September 5, 2017 status;2 \n \n3.  Defendants and their agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and all persons in \nactive  concert  or  participation  with  any  of  them,  are  ENJOINED  from \nimplementing or enforcing the DACA rescission and from taking any other action \nto rescind DACA that is not in compliance with applicable law;3 \n \n4.  Plaintiff’s estoppel claim and request for an injunction as it pertains to DACA’s \ninformation-sharing policies are DENIED;4 \n                                                 \n1 See Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 924 F.3d at 705–06 (holding that the \nDACA rescission was arbitrary and capricious under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)); Dep't of Homeland \nSec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. at 1913–15 (same). \n2 See Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 924 F.3d at 693–94, 706 (“Our decision \n2 See Casa De Maryland v.

See ECF No. 1.  Plaintiffs are a number of \nindividual participants in that program known as “Dreamers,” as well as a series of special \ninterest organizations that deal with immigration policy issues and work directly with immigrants \nin the community.  Id. at 11–21.  Defendants are President Donald Trump, Attorney General Jeff \nSessions, and a series of government agencies—the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), \nU.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services  (“USCIS”),  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”)—as well as each agency’s \nacting leader (secretary, director, or commissioner).  Defendants collectively will be referred to \nas the “Government.”  Each individual defendant is being sued in his or her official capacity.  Id. \nat 21–22.   \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint alleges a number of causes of action—both administrative and \nconstitutional—which they believe are proper grounds for relief.  Plaintiffs assert that rescission \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 2 of 30\nof the DACA program was unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) both \n(1) as an arbitrary and capricious decision and (2) for failure to follow notice-and-comment \nprocedures.  Id. at 54–58.  Plaintiffs further allege that the DACA rescission was a violation of \nthe Fifth Amendment on the grounds of procedural due process, substantive due process, and \nequal protection.  Id. at 49–54.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief on the basis of equitable estoppel \nboth as to the DACA rescission itself and its information sharing policy.  Id. at 58–59.  Lastly, \nPlaintiffs seek declaratory relief that the DACA program is lawful.  Id. at 59–60.   \nOn November 1, 2017, the Court held an in-person status conference in order to resolve \nthe scheduling and logistical issues of this case.  ECF No. 19.  Thereafter on November 15, 2017, \nthe  Government  filed  a  Motion  to  Dismiss  or, in  the  Alternative,  for  Summary  Judgment.  \nECF No. 27.  On November 28, 2017, Plaintiffs responded in opposition, ECF No. 29, and on \nDecember 5, 2017, the Government replied in support of its Motion, ECF No. 30.  The Court \nissued an Order on December 11, 2017 giving notice to the parties in accordance with Rule 56(f) \nthat  it  may  grant  summary  judgment  for  the  non-moving  party.

BACKGROUND \n“Can we all get along?” – Rodney King1 \nIn recent years, many Americans have found themselves sharing Mr. King’s sentiment.  \nThis Court previously noted, albeit in the context of congressional gerrymandering, that “[n]ever \nbefore has the United States seen such deep political divisions as exist today, and while the \ncourts are struggling in their efforts to find a standard [for the adjudication of gerrymandering \nclaims],  the  fires  of  excessive  partisanship  are  burning  and  our  national  government  is \n                                                            \n1  See  Richard  A.  Serrano,  Rodney  King:  ‘Truth  will  come  out’,  L.A.  Times  (May  2,  1992), \nhttp://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-king-case-aftermath-city-in-crisis-19920502-story.html. \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 3 of 30\nencountering  deadlock  as  never  before.”    Fletcher  v.  Lamone,  831  F.  Supp.  2d  887,  905 \n(D. Md. 2011)  (Titus,  J.,  concurring), aff’d, 567  U.S.  930  (2012).    Unfortunately,  that  2011 \nobservation still holds true today—perhaps even more so.   \nThis case is yet another example of the damaging fallout that results from excessive \npolitical partisanship.  The highly politicized debate surrounding the DACA program has thus far \nproduced only rancor and accusations.  During the recent debate over the rescission of DACA, \nthe program even turned into a bargaining chip that resulted in a brief shutdown of the entire \nfederal government earlier this year.2  In order to adequately resolve the legal issues of this case, \nit is important to step back from the heated rhetoric and understand the context under which \nDACA was promulgated and rescinded.   \nThe Dream Act—a Lengthy History of Failed Legislation \nThe Constitution reserves the power to enact immigration policy to the legislative branch.  \nU.S.  Const.  art.  I,  §  8  (“[T]o  establish  a  uniform  rule  of  naturalization”).    However,  the \n“supervision of the admission of aliens into the United States may be intrusted by [C]ongress” to \nthe executive branch.  Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, 142 U.S. 651, 659 (1892).  For over a \ndecade at the start of the 21st century, Congress quarreled over policies regarding illegal aliens \nwho entered the country as children, and who may have no memory or connection with their \ncountry of origin.  Would the world’s beacon of freedom—a nation founded by immigrants—\ncast out an immigrant population that was likely brought here without choice and who likely now \nknows no other home?  While “no” would seem to be the obvious answer, ordinary logic has \neluded our Congress.   \n                                                            \n2  See  Gregory  Krieg,  The  DACA  shutdown  is  over.  Now  What?,  CNN  (Jan.  22,  2018), \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2018/01/22/politics/shutdown-immigration-daca-outcomes/index.html. \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 4 of 30\n“Dreamers” are neither constitutionally nor statutorily defined.  Rather, the concept of \nprotection for “Dreamers” arises from repeated congressional failures to act, and presidential \naction taken in their wake.  A series of congressional sessions marked by bitter strife and \ninaction left the country without any protections for persons brought here illegally as children.  \nThe first attempt at a Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (“DREAM”) Act \ncame in 2001, and although it took on many names in subsequent years, the repeated attempts to \npass this legislation were filibustered, abandoned, or defeated on the floor.3  As illustrated by the \nfrequency of bills proposed, Dreamer legislation reached its zenith during late 2010 in the 111th \nSession of Congress.  On December 8, 2010, the House of Representatives actually passed the \nDREAM Act.4  However, like all other iterations of this controversial legislation, its fate was \ndoomed—this time, less than two weeks later on the Senate floor.5   \nDACA—an Act of Desperation Born of Frustration with a Paralyzed Congress \n  President Obama’s administration, faced with the reality that Congress could do little \nmore  than  squabble  regarding  the  Dreamers,  decided  to  take  action  on  its  own.    On \nJune 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, issued a memorandum \npromulgating by executive action what is now known as DACA (“DACA Memo”).6  DACA \n                                                            \n3 See Immigrant Children’s Educational Advancement and Dropout Prevention Act of 2001, H.R. 1582, 107th Cong. \n(2001); Student Adjustment Act of 2001, H.R. 1918, 107th Cong.

The primary qualifications for DACA protections were that an \nindividual must (1) have come to the U.S. before the age of sixteen, (2) meet various education \nor military service requirements, (3) not have a criminal record, and (4) register prior to the age \nof thirty.7   \nDACA was issued under a theory of “prosecutorial discretion” and “deferred action” and \nessentially permitted otherwise illegal aliens to remain in the United States without fear of \ndeportation.8    While  some  heralded  DACA  as  a  victory,  others  decried  it  as  executive \noverreach—usurping the powers of Congress to promulgate immigration policy.9  Over the \ncourse of the next five years, approximately 800,000 Dreamers registered for DACA protections.   \nPhase II:  DAPA \n  Soon thereafter, the executive branch sought to expand its use of deferred action beyond \nthe Dreamers.  On November 20, 2014, then-Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Charles \nJohnson, issued a pair of memoranda in an attempt to promulgate what is now known as \nDeferred Action for Parents of Americans (“DAPA”), as well as a series of minor expansions for \nDACA.10   \nLess  than  a  month  later,  DAPA  was  met  with  a  legal  challenge  when  Texas  and \ntwenty-five other states sued to enjoin implementation of the program.  See generally Texas v. \nUnited States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (S.D. Tex. 2015).  In that case, DAPA was struck down by the \n                                                            \n7 See id.   \n8 See id.   \n9  See  Obama  suspends  deportation  for  thousands  of  illegals,  tells  GOP  to  pass  DREAM  Act,  Fox  News \n(June 15, 2012), http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/06/15/obama-administration-to-offer-immunity-to-younger-\nimmigrants.html.   \n10 Memorandum from U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Policies for the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of \nUndocumented  Immigrants  (Nov.  20,  2014);  Memorandum  from  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Homeland  Sec.,  Exercising \nProsecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children and with Respect to \nCertain Individuals Who Are the Parents of U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents (Nov. 20, 2014).   \n5 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 6 of 30\ndistrict court, see id., and a divided Fifth Circuit panel affirmed the decision, see 809 F.3d 134 \n(5th Cir. 2015).  In June 2016, an equally divided Supreme Court affirmed the decision.  See \nUnited States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271, 2272 (2016).  In addition to finding DAPA and the \nexpansions of DACA unlawful, the judicial decisions throughout the DAPA litigation illustrate \ntwo key realities:  (1) challenges to DAPA or analogous immigration programs promulgated by \nDHS without approval by Congress are justiciable; and (2) reasonable legal minds may differ \nregarding their lawfulness.   \nAside from the classes of immigrants to which each applies, DACA and DAPA are \nlargely similar programs addressing different classes or subcategories of immigrants.  While \nDACA affects a population of approximately 800,000 otherwise illegal aliens, DAPA would \nhave affected nearly half of the 11,000,000 immigrants currently in the United States unlawfully.  \nSee Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 745 (5th Cir. 2015).  DAPA was challenged and \ndefeated  before  the  program  was  ever  successfully  promulgated,  while  DACA  has  run  for \napproximately half of a decade before the threat of any litigation.   \nA Change in Administration and a Corresponding Change in Immigration Philosophy \n  The 2016 presidential election brought a change in leadership of the executive branch \nand, with it, significant changes in immigration views and philosophies.11  In June of 2017, and \nwith the defeat of DAPA directly in the rear-view mirror, Texas and other state plaintiffs sent a \nletter threatening to challenge DACA if it were not rescinded by September 6, 2017.12  Attorney \nGeneral Jeff Sessions advised the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Elaine Duke, that \n                                                            \n11 See, e.g., Tessa Berenson, Middle Schoolers in Michigan Chant ‘Build That Wall’ After Trump Victory, TIME \n(Nov. 11, 2016), http://time.com/4567812/donald-trump-middle-school-build-wall/. \n12 See Admin. R., ECF No. 26-1 at 238–40.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 7 of 30\nDACA was likely unlawful and headed for another legal battle.13  On September 5, 2017, Acting \nSecretary Duke issued a memorandum (“DACA Rescission Memo”) outlining a six-month wind \ndown of DACA to expire March 5, 2018.14   \nAccording to the Administrative Record, the basis for the decision to rescind DACA was \nits presumed unlawfulness in the wake of the DAPA litigation and the threat of imminent legal \nchallenge.  The agency’s reasoning is substantiated by the legal advice of the Attorney General \nand the fact that the memorandum was issued the day before the state parties had threatened to \nact.  A six-month wind down period was provided to avoid the potential for chaos if a court \ndecision  resulted  in  immediate  termination,  and  the  President  urged  Congress  to  pass \nDreamer-protection legislation.15   \nComplicating the picture for some observers is the unfortunate and often inflammatory \nrhetoric used by President Trump during the campaign, as well as his Twitter pronouncements, \nboth before and after his election.  Thoughtful and careful judicial review is not aided when the \nPresident lobs verbal hand grenades at the federal courts, the Department of Justice, and anyone \nelse with whom he disagrees.   \nAs disheartening or inappropriate as the President’s occasionally disparaging remarks \nmay be, they are not relevant to the larger issues governing the DACA rescission.  The DACA \nRescission Memo is clear as to its purpose and reasoning, and its decision is rationally supported \nby the Administrative Record.  See generally Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 770 (1972) \n(“[W]hen the Executive exercises [a congressionally delegated power of immigration policies \n                                                            \n13 See Admin.

Rumsfeld, \n548 U.S. 557, 623–24 n.52 (2006) (“We have not heretofore, in evaluating the legality of \nexecutive action, deferred to comments made by such officials to the media.”).16   \nThe executive branch may have the authority to exercise or not exercise prosecutorial \ndiscretion as it sees fit, and an agency certainly may refrain from action it reasonably believes to \nbe  unlawful.    Under  the  Constitution,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  Congress  to  determine \nimmigration  policy,  and  the  executive  branch  must  only  act  within  its  constitutional  and \ndelegated  legislative  authority.    Although  Congress  has  repeatedly  failed  to  pass  Dreamer \nlegislation in the past, the ball is again in its court.  And with 87 percent of Americans favoring \nsome sort of DACA-esque protections, the elected members of Congress should understandably \nfeel the pressure now that the President has deferred to them—in short, Congress needs to get the \njob done now that their authority has been recognized by court decisions and the President.17   \nOther DACA Litigation \n  Various plaintiffs have filed lawsuits seeking to enjoin the DACA rescission throughout \nthe country—specifically in this Court, the Eastern District of New York, the Northern District \nof California, and the District of the District of Columbia.  These cases are at various stages, but \n                                                            \n16 See also Washington v. Trump, 858 F.3d 1168, 1174 (9th Cir. 2017) (Kozinski, J., dissenting):   \nEven if a politician’s past statements were utterly clear and consistent, using them to yield a \nspecific constitutional violation would suggest an absurd result—namely, that the policies of an \nelected official can be forever held hostage by the unguarded declarations of a candidate.  If a \ncourt  were  to  find  that  campaign  skeletons  prevented  an  official  from  pursuing  otherwise \nconstitutional policies, what could he do to cure the defect?  Could he stand up and recant it all \n(“just kidding!”) and try again?  Or would we also need a court to police the sincerity of that mea \nculpa—piercing into the public official’s “heart of hearts” to divine whether he really changed his \nmind, just as the Supreme Court has warned us not to?

Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 709 \n(1952).21   \nThe decisions to date by courts in California and New York are premised on the legal \nconclusion that DACA is lawful, and therefore, a decision to rescind DACA on the basis of \nunlawfulness  is  necessarily  arbitrary  and  capricious.    Respectfully,  this  Court  disagrees.  \nRegardless of the lawfulness of DACA, the appropriate inquiry is whether or not DHS made a \n                                                            \n18 See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v.

But public respect for Article III courts calls for \nheightened  discipline  and  sharpened  focus  on  only  the  applicable  legal  principles  to  avoid \nsubstituting judicial judgment for that of elected representatives.   \nInt’l Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump, No. 17-2231, 2018 WL 894413, at *104 (4th Cir. Feb. 15, 2018) \n(Niemeyer, J., dissenting).   \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 10 of 30\nreasoned  decision  to  rescind  DACA  based  on  the  Administrative  Record.    Any  alternative \ninquiry would impermissibly require a court to “substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  \nSee Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \nGiven the fate of DAPA, the legal advice provided by the Attorney General, and the threat of \nimminent litigation, it was reasonable for DHS to have concluded—right or wrong—that DACA \nwas unlawful and should be wound down in an orderly manner.  Therefore, its decision to \nrescind DACA cannot be arbitrary and capricious.   \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nMotion to Dismiss.  The purpose of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is “to test \nthe sufficiency of a complaint.”  Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir. \n1999).  The Supreme Court has further articulated the standard applicable to Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotions.    See  Ashcroft  v.  Iqbal,  556  U.S.  662  (2009);  Bell  Atlantic  Corp.  v.  Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544  (2007).    Rule  8  “requires  a  ‘showing,’  rather  than  a  blanket  assertion,  of \nentitlement to relief.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 n.3.  To survive a motion to dismiss, a \ncomplaint must put forth “plausible claim[s] for relief.”  Francis v. Giacomelli, 588 F.3d 186, \n192 (4th Cir. 2009).  “But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than \nthe mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not ‘show[n]’—‘that \nthe pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).   \nMotion for Summary Judgment.  Summary judgment is proper under Fed. R. Civ. P. \nRule 56(a) if there is no genuine dispute over any material facts, and the moving party is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); Francis v. \nBooz, Allen & Hamilton, Inc., 452 F.3d 299, 302 (4th Cir. 2006).  A material fact is one that \n“might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \n10 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 11 of 30\n477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A dispute of material fact is genuine if the evidence would allow the \ntrier of fact to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.  Id.  When considering a summary \njudgment motion, the court has “an affirmative obligation . . . to prevent ‘factually unsupported \nclaims or defenses’ from proceeding to trial.”  Felty v. Grave-Humphreys Co., 818 F.2d 1126, \n1128 (4th Cir. 1987) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323-24).  Thus, the court may only rely on facts \nsupported in the record, not assertions made in the pleading.  Id.  Moreover, the court must view \nall facts and make all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  \nMatsuhita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  The nonmoving \nparty must present more than a “mere scintilla” of evidence to demonstrate a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact that would preclude summary judgment.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.   \nIII.  ANALYSIS \na.  Justiciability \n“Federal  courts  are  courts  of  limited  jurisdiction.  They  possess  only  that  power \nauthorized by Constitution and statute.”  See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).  Congress has the authority to expand or limit federal district court \njurisdiction by statute.  However, federal courts possess an inherent jurisdiction (under Article III \nand the fundamental principles of due process) over certain cases relating to the enforcement of \nthe Constitution that cannot be limited by Congress.  See, e.g., Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, \n603 (1988) (permitting federal district court jurisdiction when necessary “to avoid the serious \nconstitutional question that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial \nforum for a colorable constitutional claim.”).   \nThe Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to “Cases” and “Controversies.”  \nU.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  However, federal courts may only review “cases and controversies” if \n11 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 12 of 30\nthey are justiciable.  See generally Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 94–99 (1968) (discussing the \ndoctrine of justiciability as “a blend of constitutional requirements and policy considerations”).  \nA case may lack justiciability when it involves a political question and implicates concerns \nregarding the separation of powers between the judiciary and one of the other branches of \ngovernment.  See, e.g., Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 210–11 (1962) (“Deciding whether a matter \nhas in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or \nwhether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed . . . is a \nresponsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.”).  While executive actions \nmay often involve otherwise unreviewable political questions, federal courts always retain the \npower to review matters of constitutional violations.  See id.  Accordingly, the Court need not \nreach back to Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), to support the conclusion that Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claims are justiciable.   \nTurning to Plaintiffs’ remaining claims, the Court is required to determine if judicial \nreview  has  been  limited  by  Congress  under  the  APA.    The  plain  language  of  the  APA—\nspecifically, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701, 702—indicates a presumption for judicial review, at least to the \nprocedures surrounding agency decision-making (but not necessarily to the substance of those \ndecisions).  See generally Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967) (restating “the \nbasic presumption of judicial review” for APA claims “so long as no statute precludes such relief \nor the action is not one committed by law to agency discretion”).22  Under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a), the \nonly two exceptions are when:  “(1) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is \ncommitted to agency discretion by law.”   \n                                                            \n22 abrogated on other grounds by statute, Pub. L. 94-574, 90 Stat. 2721, as recognized in Califano v. Sanders, \n430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977) (finding the statutory amendment to “eliminate the requirement of a specified amount in \ncontroversy as a prerequisite to the maintenance of any (§ 1331) action brought against the United States, any \nagency thereof, or any officer or employee thereof in his official capacity”).   \n12 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 13 of 30\nThe Government argues both exceptions—that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) precludes judicial \nreview, and that the DACA rescission is “committed to agency discretion” because it is a matter \nof  prosecutorial  discretion,  see  United  States  v.  Armstrong,  517  U.S.  456,  464  (1996), \nimmigration enforcement, see Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396–97 (2012), and \ndeferred action generally, see Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (AADC), 525 U.S. \n471, 485 (1999).  See ECF No. 27-1 at 29–30.   \nHowever, the notion that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) precludes judicial review has been rejected \nrepeatedly.  See, e.g., AADC, 525 U.S. at 482 (explicitly rejecting that § 1252(g) serves as a \nzipper clause that functions to prohibit all judicial review).  Furthermore, while DHS possesses \nspecified delegated authority over immigration enforcement, Congress never explicitly granted \nDHS a blanket authority to disparately enforce policies. \nPlaintiffs’ APA claims are justiciable because they relate to the procedures followed by \nDHS—not to the substance of its policy or its decision of a specific case.  The Court may review \nwhether the repeal of DACA followed the correct APA procedures.  Furthermore, it is important \nto note that the Government’s explanation for rescinding DACA was the Secretary’s belief that \nthe program was unlawful and would face lengthy legal challenges.  The similarities between \nDACA and DAPA support justiciability in this case because review of DAPA was also found to \nbe justiciable.  See Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 155–64 (5th Cir. 2015) (“Congress has \nexpressly limited or precluded judicial review of many immigration decisions . . . but DAPA is \nnot one of them.”), aff’d, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016).23   \n                                                            \n23 See also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 165–170 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d, 136 S. Ct. 906 (2016).   \nCongress did not intend to make immune from judicial review an agency action that reclassifies \nmillions of illegal aliens in a way that imposes substantial costs on states that have relied on the \nprotections conferred by § 1621. . . .  \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 14 of 30\nAccordingly, the Court finds all claims in Plaintiffs’ Complaint are justiciable.   \nb.  Standing \nDirect standing exists for plaintiffs who have an injury-in-fact that is traceable to the \ndefendants  and  which  is  redressable  through  adjudication.    See  Lujan  v.  Defs.  of  Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 590 (1992).  The injury must be more than a generalized grievance, which is an \nideological objection or an injury widely shared by all members of the public.  See id. at 575.  \nOrganizations have direct standing when government action has impaired the organization’s own \nlegal  rights.    See,  e.g.,  Hunt  v.  Wash.  State  Apple  Advert.  Comm’n,  432  U.S.  333,  342 \n(U.S. 1977).  However, association standing also exists for organizational plaintiffs when (1) its \nmembers would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, (2) the interests it seeks to \nprotect are germane to the purpose of the organization, and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the \nrelief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.  See id. at 343.   \nThe Government does not contest the standing of the individual plaintiffs.  However, it \nargues that the organizational plaintiffs lack direct standing because they are not “the object of \nany government policy” and are merely seeking to “vindicate their own value preferences.”  See \nECF No. 27-1 at 38–39 (equating the organizational plaintiffs’ injury to a mere “generalized \n                                                            \n(continued from previous page) \nChaney’s presumption against judicial review of agency inaction [exists] because there are no \nmeaningful standards against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.  But where there \nis affirmative agency action—as with DAPA’s issuance of lawful presence and employment \nauthorization—and in light of the INA’s intricate regulatory scheme for changing immigration \nclassifications and issuing employment authorization, the action at least can be reviewed to \ndetermine whether the agency exceeded its statutory powers. . . .  \nAt its core, this case is about the Secretary’s decision to change the immigration classification of \nmillions of illegal aliens on a class-wide basis.  The states properly maintain that DAPA’s grant of \nlawful presence and accompanying eligibility for benefits is a substantive rule that must go \nthrough notice and comment, before it imposes substantial costs on them, and that DAPA is \nsubstantively contrary to law.  The federal courts are fully capable of adjudicating those disputes.  \nBecause the interests that Texas seeks to protect are within the INA’s zone of interests, and \njudicial review is available, we address whether Texas has established a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on its claim that DAPA must be submitted for notice and comment.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 15 of 30\ngrievance”).  The Government also argues that the organizational plaintiffs lack representational \nstanding for failing to identify members of their organizations who are directly harmed by the \nrepeal of DACA, see id. at 41–42, or reside within DACA’s zone-of-interests, see id. at 42 \n(citing Clarke v. Secs. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 395–96 (1987)).   \nThe Government’s challenges to the standing of the organizational plaintiffs miss the \nmark.  Casa De Maryland and the rest of the organizational plaintiffs are special interest groups \ndirectly focused on aiding immigrants and their communities.  The fact that one of their primary \nfunctions has been assisting their members with “tens of thousands of DACA initial and renewal \napplications” is sufficient for standing in and of itself.  See ECF No. 29 at 33.  In addition to \ndirect standing, the organizational plaintiffs possess association standing.  Each organization has \nidentified a number of its members who are Dreamers, and who unquestionably would have \nstanding in this case.  Furthermore, the purpose of these organizations is to aid and represent \nimmigrants  in  their  communities,  including  compliance  with  immigration  procedures.  \nTherefore,  the  rescission  of  DACA  has  an  absolute  nexus  to  the  organizations’  purpose.  \nAdditionally, the relief sought is injunctive and declaratory relief—not damages or any other \nremedy  requiring  the  individual  Dreamers.    Hence,  these  organizational  plaintiffs  are  the \nprototypical examples of possessing association standing.   \nAccordingly, the Court finds all Plaintiffs have standing in the instant case.   \nc.  APA Claims \nRulemaking is a common method federal agencies use to promulgate decisions.  See \ngenerally  Bi-Metallic  Inv.  Co.  v.  State  Bd.  of  Equalization,  239  U.S.  441,  445–46  (1915); \nLondoner  v.  City  &  Cty.  of  Denver,  210  U.S.  373,  385  (1908).    Informal  rulemaking  is \nstandardized under the APA and requires notice-and-comment procedures.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553; \n15 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 16 of 30\ne.g., United States v. Nova Scotia Food Prod. Corp., 568 F.2d 240, 253 (2d Cir. 1977).  Informal \nrulemaking does not include non-legislative rulemaking, such as procedural rules, interpretive \nrules, or policy statements.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b); e.g., McLouth Steel Prod. Corp. v. Thomas, \n838 F.2d 1317, 1324–25 (D.C. Cir. 1988).   \nAfter the notice-and-comment requirements, if applicable, have been met, courts must \ntake  a  hard  look  at  whether  the  decision  to  promulgate  or  repeal  a  rule  is  “arbitrary  or \ncapricious”—which is to say that there must be a rational correlation between the facts reviewed \nand the decision made.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 42–44 (1983) (explaining that an agency must examine relevant data, articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation contemporaneously with its decision, using rationale that comes from \nthe agency (and not from a court inferring after the fact logic that is not explicitly stated in the \nrecord)).  See id.  However, even when notice-and-comment requirements do not apply, agency \ndecisions are subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. § 706.  By statute, “[t]he reviewing court \nshall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . \narbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2).   \nThe  DACA  program  is  a  deferral  of  action,  which  by  definition  is  an  exercise  of \ndiscretion rather than a rule with the force of law.  Furthermore, the DACA Rescission Memo \nwas not immediately binding, but rather a statement of intended policy beginning March 5, 2018.  \nTo the extent that Plaintiffs aver that, in practice, immigration reviews absent DACA protections \nlack individualized discretion, their dispute is merely with how the agency applies its policy, and \n16 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 17 of 30\nnot with the policy itself.24  Although a substantial paradigm shift, the DACA Rescission Memo \nneither curtails DHS’s discretion regarding individual immigration reviews, nor does it prevent \nthe agency from granting Dreamers deferred action status again in the future.  Hence, DACA and \nits rescission are more akin to non-binding policy statements, and thus not subject to notice-and-\ncomment requirements.   \nPlaintiffs argue that the decision to rescind DACA must be arbitrary and capricious \nbecause the Administrative Record is “insufficient” to make a decision of such magnitude.   See \nECF No. 29 at 35–39 (noting that the Administrative Record is only 256 pages long—192 of \nwhich are court opinions related to DAPA); see also In re United States, No. 17-72917, 2017 \nWL 5505730, at *2 (9th Cir. Nov. 16, 2017) (“The notion that the head of a United States agency \nwould decide to terminate a program giving legal protection to roughly 800,000 people based on \n256 pages of publicly available documents is not credible.”).   \nHowever, based on the historical and political context outlined in the introductory pages \nof this Opinion, the decision to rescind DACA was neither arbitrary nor capricious, but rather \nwas a carefully crafted decision supported by the Administrative Record.  It is well established \nthat “[t]he scope of review under the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard is narrow and a court is \nnot to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \nTherefore, it is irrelevant whether this Court, a judge in California or New York, or even a justice \non the Supreme Court might have made a different decision while standing in the shoes of DHS \non September 5, 2017.  Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether the decision was made with a \n                                                            \n24 Plaintiffs’ APA claim regarding DACA’s information sharing policy also lacks merit.  Nothing in the DACA \nRescission Memo outlines any change—let alone implements a substantive rule—with regard to the use of any \nindividual’s information gathered during DACA’s implementation.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 18 of 30\n“satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.”  Id. (internal quotations omitted).   \nDHS’s rationale provided in the DACA Rescission Memo was a belief, based on recent \ncourt decisions and the advice of the Attorney General, that DACA was unlawful.  Assuming \nthat a reasonable basis for that belief exists in the Administrative Record, how could trying to \navoid unlawful action possibly be arbitrary and capricious?  Quite simply, it cannot.  Regardless \nof whether DACA is, in fact, lawful or unlawful, the belief that it was unlawful and subject to \nserious legal challenge is completely rational.   \nDAPA—an analogous program, promulgated by analogous means—had been defeated \nless than a year prior.  The litigation that stopped DAPA included expansions of DACA itself.  \nThe same plaintiffs who defeated DAPA threatened to challenge DACA imminently.  The \nAttorney General of the United States—the nation’s chief legal officer—provided legal advice \nthat DACA was likewise unlawful and likely ill-fated against a legal challenge.  All of this is in \nthe  Administrative  Record—the  remnants  of  the  DAPA  litigation,25  the  threatened  legal \nchallenge,26 and the Attorney General’s advisory letter.27   \nTherefore,  what  did  the  Acting  Secretary  of  DHS  do?    She  opted  for  a  six-month \nwind-down period instead of the chaotic possibility of an immediate termination, which would \ncome at a time known only to the judge resolving a future challenge to the DACA program.  This \ndecision took control of a pell-mell situation and provided Congress—the branch of government \ncharged  with  determining  immigration  policy—an  opportunity  to  remedy  it.    Given  the \n                                                            \n25 See Admin. R., ECF No. 26-1 at 42–228.   \n26 See Admin. R., ECF No. 26-1 at 238–40.   \n27 See Admin. R., ECF No. 26-1 at 251.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 19 of 30\nreasonable belief that DACA was unlawful, the decision to wind down DACA in an orderly \nmanner was rational.   \nAccordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ APA claims to lack merit; the rescission of \nDACA  neither  required  notice-and-comment  procedures,  nor  was  it  decided  arbitrarily  or \ncapriciously.  \nd.  Equal Protection \nEqual protection is the legal mechanism by which the law prevents disparate treatment \nbetween groups.  See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  A \nviolative statute or action may provide for disparate treatment facially or in its application.  See \nid. at 447–48.  In reviewing legislation, which creates disparate impacts ‘as applied,’ courts \nreview whether the action is covertly based on a suspect classification or if it can be plausibly \nexplained on neutral grounds.  See Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., \n429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977).  Probative considerations include a history of hostility towards the \ngroup,  the  sequence  of  events  leading  to  the  government  action,  departures  from  previous \npolicies, and the legislative history.  See id. at 265–67.  The level of judicial scrutiny depends on \nthe nature of the class targeted for disparate treatment.   \nThe Complaint asserts that strict scrutiny should apply because the disparate treatment \nallegedly involves suspect classes—race, alienage, and national origin.  See, e.g., Ambach v. \nNorwick, 441 U.S. 68, 84 (1979) (finding alienage as a suspect class).  When strict scrutiny \napplies, the government has the burden to demonstrate a compelling state interest, for which the \ngovernmental action is narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means.  See, e.g., Fisher v. \nUniv. of Tex. at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 308 (2013).   \n19 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 20 of 30\nThe Government’s equal protection argument analogizes the rescission of DACA to \n“selective prosecution”—which is afforded a presumption of non-discriminatory motives absent \n“clear evidence to the contrary.”  See ECF No. 27-1 at 58–61 (citing United States v. Armstrong, \n517 U.S. 456, 463–68 (1996) where the court denied discovery on a selective prosecution claim \nregarding  24  drug-trafficking  offenses  (all  of  which  were  against  African-American \ndefendants)).  Plaintiffs correctly note that the Armstrong court accepted the proposition that “the \ndecision whether to prosecute may not be based on an unjustifiable standard such as race, \nreligion, or other arbitrary classification.”  Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464 (1996).  Plaintiffs aver \nthat the DACA rescission was “a discriminatory policy decision (not a challenge to a particular \nprosecution) that has a discriminatory impact and was motivated by discriminatory animus.”  See \nECF No. 29 at 55 (noting that Hispanics comprise 93 percent of the 800,000 immigrants affected \nby DACA).  To substantiate their claim, Plaintiffs cite to some of President Trump’s unfortunate, \nless-than-politically-correct, statements.  See ECF No. 29 at 54.   \nBoth  sides  miss  the  mark.    While  DACA  was  promulgated  under  a  theory  of \nprosecutorial discretion, its rescission was not based on an exercise of that discretion.  Rather, its \nrescission was premised on a legitimate belief that DACA was unlawful and should be wound \ndown in an orderly manner, while giving Congress a window to act and adopt an appropriate \nlegislative solution.  The Administrative Record—the basis from which the Court must make its \njudicial review—does not support the notion that it was targeting a subset of the immigrant \npopulation, and it does not support any supposition that the decision was derived on a racial \nanimus.  That is where the judicial inquiry should end.   \nThe Court rejects Plaintiffs’ reliance on the President’s misguided, inconsistent, and \noccasionally  irrational  comments  made  to  the  media  to  establish  an  ulterior  motive.    See \n20 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 21 of 30\ngenerally Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 770 (1972) (finding that courts should defer to \nany “facially legitimate and bona fide reason” for executive action and not “look behind the \nexercise of that discretion”); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 623–24 n.52 (2006) (noting \nthat courts have never, “in evaluating the legality of executive action, deferred to comments \nmade by such officials to the media”); County of McCreary v.

[Precedent] clearly affords the political branches \nsubstantial deference,” but “also accounts for those very rare instances in which a challenger \nplausibly  alleges  that  a  government  action  runs  so  contrary  to  the  basic  premises  of  our \nConstitution as to warrant more probing review.”  Int’l Refugee Assistance Project v.

Trump, No. 17-2231, 2018 WL 894413, at *102 (4th Cir. Feb. 15, \n2018) (Niemeyer, J., dissenting): \nBecause of their nature, campaign statements and other similar statements, including Tweets, are \nunbounded resources by which to find intent of various kinds.  They are often short-hand for \nlarger ideas; they are explained, modified, retracted, and amplified as they are repeated and as new \ncircumstances and arguments arise.  And they are often susceptible to multiple interpretations, \ndepending on the outlook of the recipient. . . . \nAt bottom, the danger of this new rule is that it will enable a court to justify its decision to strike \ndown  any  executive  action  with which it  disagrees.   It need  only  find one  statement  that \ncontradicts the official reasons given for a subsequent executive action and thereby pronounce that \nthe official reasons were a pretext. \n21 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 22 of 30\nin  Kleindienst  v.  Mandel,  408  U.S.  753  (1972)  “through  the  lens  of  Justice  Kennedy’s \n[concurring] opinion in” Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128 (2015)).   \n  In  that  case,  Chief  Judge  Gregory,  writing  for  the  majority,  explained  that  Mandel \nrequires  courts  to  “first  ask  whether  the  proffered  reason  for  the  Proclamation  is  ‘facially \nlegitimate and bona fide.’”  Id. (citing Mandel, 408 U.S. at 770).  Under Din, however, a district \ncourt “may ‘look behind’ the Government’s proffered justification for its action” upon “an \n‘affirmative  showing  of  bad  faith,’  which  [plaintiffs]  must  ‘plausibly  allege  with  sufficient \nparticularity.’”  Id. (citing Din, 135 S. Ct. at 2139–41 (Kennedy, J., concurring)).  However, \nwhile the plaintiffs in the “travel ban” case offered “undisputed evidence” of an “anti-Muslim \nbias,” see id. at *13, the Plaintiffs cannot here make a similarly substantial showing.  The Fourth \nCircuit found that then-candidate Trump regularly disparaged Islam as a religion and repeatedly \nproposed banning Muslims from the United States.  See id. at *13–*16.  Implicit to the issue was \na direct nexus between the discriminatory statements and the executive action in question in that \ncase—a travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim nations.   \nThe instant case is factually very different.  The President certainly made statements of \nhis strong views on immigration policy, including advocacy for the rescission of the DACA \nprogram.29    However,  his  statements  have  frequently  shifted  but  have  moderated  since  his \nelection.  He has referred to the Dreamers as “terrific people;” he has pledged to “show great \nheart;” and he has referred to Dreamers as “incredible kids.”30  He referred to the “DACA \n                                                            \n29 See Gregory Krieg, Trump’s many shifting positions on DACA, from the campaign to right now, CNN (Jan. 25, \n2018), https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/politics/donald-trump-positions-daca/index.html.    \n30 See id.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 23 of 30\nsituation” as a “very difficult thing for me.  Because, you know, I love these kids.”31  He added \nthat “the existing law is very rough.  It’s very, very rough.”32   \nThe rescission of the DACA program merely fulfills the duty of the executive branch to \nfaithfully enforce the laws passed by Congress.  Accordingly, no affirmative showing of bad \nfaith can follow.  In fact, the President actually urged Congress to pass Dreamer-protection \nlegislation during DACA’s wind down period33—simply put, this case is wholly dissimilar to the \n“extraordinary case” regarding the recent “travel ban.”34  As a result, the Court need not go \nfurther than the facially legitimate motivation offered in the DACA Rescission Memo and \nsupported by the Administrative Record.   \nAccordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims to lack merit \ne.  Procedural Due Process \nProcedural due process ensures that the government must satisfy certain procedures prior \nto depriving a person of his or her rights.  See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332–33 \n(1976).  Procedural due process applies whenever the government seeks to deprive a person of a \nliberty or property interest.  See id.  Liberty interests include physical restraint, a substantial \ninfringement of a fundamental right, harm to one’s reputation affecting another tangible interest, \nor the unjustified intrusion of one’s personal security.  See, e.g., Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, \n488 (1980).  Property interests include real property, personal property, intellectual property, or \nany legitimate claim of entitlement.  See, e.g., Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, \n                                                            \n31 See id.   \n32 See id.   \n33 See supra Note 15.   \n34 Accord Int’l Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump, No. 17-2231, 2018 WL 894413, at *13 (4th Cir. Feb. 15, 2018) \n(“In the extraordinary case before us, resolution of that question [regarding pretext] presents little difficulty. \nUnlike Din and Mandel, in which the Government had a “bona fide factual basis” for its actions, Din, 135 S. Ct. at \n2140 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment), here the Government’s proffered rationale for the Proclamation lies \nat odds with the statements of the President himself.”).   \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 24 of 30\n429 (1982).  Entitlements—rights to things like education, public employment, and welfare—are \ngrounded in the law and cannot be removed except for cause.  See id.  In determining the amount \nof process owed, courts balance (1) the importance of the right the individual is trying to \npreserve, (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation of that right given the existing level of due \nprocess, and (3) the level of governmental burden for the additional levels of due process sought.  \nSee Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 334–35.   \nPlaintiffs allege that under DACA, Dreamers were afforded, and are now being deprived \nof, a number of protected interests, including the ability to (1) obtain employment authorization, \n(2) travel internationally, (3) attend schools, (4) pay into and receive payment from Social \nSecurity and disability, (5) secure other opportunities like obtaining bank accounts or credit \ncards, and (6) otherwise be considered “lawfully present.”  See ECF No. 29 at 58.   \nFirst, Plaintiffs’ claim fails because procedural due process only applies to individualized \ndeprivations, not policy-based deprivations for an entire class.  See Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State \nBd.  of  Equalization,  239  U.S.  441,  445  (1915)  (holding  that  individualized  hearings  are \nunnecessary when impractical and when the challenged policy affects a large number of people; \nin these instances, the political process serves as an effective alternative).   \nSecond,  even  assuming  arguendo  that  due  process  did  attach  to  class-wide  policy \ndeprivations,  Plaintiffs’  due  process  claim  would  fail  because  DACA  did  not  create  an \nentitlement.  Facially, the June 15, 2012 DACA Memo explicitly denied the creation of any such \nrights:   \nThis memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status \nor pathway to citizenship.  Only the Congress, acting through its \nlegislative authority, can confer these rights.  It remains for the \nexecutive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of \ndiscretion within the framework of the existing law.  I have done \nso here.   \n24 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 25 of 30\nMemorandum from U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with \nRespect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children (June 15, 2012).   \nWhile entitlements are not always self-labeled or created with bright flashing lights, the \nexercise or restraint of prosecutorial discretion is not traditionally the sort of governmental action \nthat creates substantive rights.  The DACA Memo did not guarantee any individual immigrant \nparticular benefits, and the DACA Rescission Memo did not curtail DHS’s discretion regarding \nindividual immigration reviews.  Therefore, even if due process could attach to DACA, no de \nfacto entitlements were created by the program itself.    \nAccordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim to lack merit. \nf.  Substantive Due Process \nWhile procedural due process outlines the manner by which the government may deprive \na person of his or her rights, substantive due process bars the government from depriving a \nperson of a right altogether.  See, e.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 167–68 (1973) (Stewart, J., \nconcurring).  If the right being deprived is a “fundamental right,” courts apply strict scrutiny; if \nthe right being deprived is not fundamental, courts apply rational basis.  \nCertain rights have been adjudicated formally as fundamental (right to associate, right to \neducate one’s children, right to procreate, right to marry, etc.).  E.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, \n381 U.S. 479, 482–86 (1965).  In determining whether a non-previously-adjudicated right is \nfundamental, courts have applied different approaches—whether the absence of the right would \nmake other fundamental rights “less secure,” see id. at 482–83, whether the right is “deeply \nrooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” see Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720–\n21 (1997) (quoting Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977)), and whether the \n25 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 26 of 30\nright is a basic value “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” see Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at \n720–21 (quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937)).   \nIn the instant case, Plaintiffs claim a “denial of fundamental fairness.”  See ECF No. 29 at \n63–64.  However, for the “denial of fundamental fairness” to rise to the level of a substantive due \nprocess violation, it must be “so egregious” and “so outrageous” as “to shock the contemporary \nconscience.”  See Manion v. N. Carolina Med. Bd., 693 F. App’x 178, 181 (4th Cir. 2017) \n(quoting County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 n.8, 850 (1998), abrogated on other \ngrounds by Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001)).  Plaintiffs believe they have met this burden \nby alleging a discriminatory intent in DACA’s rescission—an allegation unsupported by the \nrecord before this Court.   \nThe  rescission  of  a  policy  relating  to  prosecutorial  discretion  does  not  shock  the \nconscience of this Court.  Absent congressional action, the benefits given to Dreamers by DACA \nwere in potential violation of congressional immigration laws; the only thing that has changed is \nthat deferred status will expire, and enforcement of immigration laws may recommence in the \nabsence of action by Congress, which the President has requested.  There is nothing surprising or \nunfair  about  policies,  laws,  or  enforcement  thereof  changing  with  an  election  cycle.  \nFurthermore,  the  election  process,  and  not  federal  litigation,  is  the  appropriate  method  for \nresolving any fairness implicated in DACA’s rescission.   \nAccordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim to lack merit. \ng.  Estoppel \nThe doctrine of estoppel is traditionally founded in the principles of fraud as applied in \ncontract law, but the doctrine may be applied elsewhere in the law as well.  See generally W. \nAugusta Dev. Corp. v. Giuffrida, 717 F.2d 139, 141 (4th Cir. 1983) (discussing the outgrowth of \n26 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 27 of 30\nthe doctrine of estoppel as a claim against the government).  In general, “equitable estoppel is \ncomprised of three basic elements: (1) a voluntary misrepresentation of one party, (2) that is \nrelied on by the other party, (3) to the other party’s detriment.”  Chawla v. Transamerica \nOccidental Life Ins. Co., 440 F.3d 639, 646 (4th Cir. 2006).  In this Circuit, when raising such a \nclaim against the government, there is a heightened standard for the first element, and an \nadditional showing of “affirmative misconduct” by the government actors.  See Dawkins v. Witt, \n318 F.3d 606, 611 (4th Cir. 2003).   \nAs with Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim, estoppel cannot apply to DACA’s \nrescission.  The rescission of a policy relating to prosecutorial discretion does not amount to a \nmisrepresentation by the government.  DACA was promulgated with an express disclaimer that it \nwas not conferring any rights.  Nothing in the DACA Memo or in DACA’s implementation \nsuggested to Dreamers that the program was permanent, and individuals in the program were \naware that their protections were subject to renewal every two years.  DACA’s rescission lacks \nany serious injustice—let alone, affirmative misconduct by any of the defendants.    \nHowever, while estoppel does not apply to DACA’s rescission, it potentially would apply \nto any use for immigration enforcement of the information collected from Dreamers during \nDACA registrations.  With regard to this narrow issue, and based on the evidence before it, the \nCourt finds that the Government promised not to transfer or use the information gathered from \nDreamers for immigration enforcement.  See ECF No. 29 at 42–44, 60–61; ECF No. 29-3 at 15–\n27, 32–41, 52–76, 96–98, 109–13.  And now that the government is in possession of this \ninformation, the potential for use or sharing of it is theoretically possible.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 28 of 30\nOn  the  one  hand,  the  Government  claims  that  no  changes  have  been  made  to  the \ninformation-sharing policy.  However, at oral argument, counsel for the Government was unable \nto provide any assurance that the Government would not make changes.   \n[Mr. Shumate:] The rescission policy that is being challenged here \nsays  nothing  about  the  sharing  of  information  for  enforcement \npurposes.  There’s nothing more that the plaintiffs have raised \nother than a speculative fear that this might happen in the future.  \nBut DHS has been quite clear and they said on the FAQ section – \nThe Court: Are you prepared to say that from representing the \ndefendants that there is no intention of changing the information-\nsharing assurances that were given in connection with DACA? \nMr. Shumate: No. I’m not making that representation, Your Honor.  \nEven from the beginning, DHS has been quite clear that this policy \non information-sharing can change. . . . But they also I think take \nliberties with what that policy is.  There has never been a promise \nor  assurance  that  that  information  would  never  be  changed.  \nFAQ 19  quite  clearly  says  that  the  information  is  generally \nprotected and will not be shared for enforcement purposes, but \nthere may be circumstances where it will be to adjudicate a DACA \napplication or for law enforcement purposes if the individual meets \nthe status of the test for notice to appear.  But also quite clearly, \nDHS has said from the start that the information policy – sharing \npolicy can change, but it has not.  So that really should be the end \nof the debate about the information-sharing.   \nTr. of Mot. Hr’g (Dec. 15, 2017) at 16–17.   \nThe Court disagrees that this “should be the end of the debate about the information-\nsharing.”  Id.  Logic would dictate that it is possible that the government, having induced these \nimmigrants to share their personal information under the guise of immigration protections, could \nnow use that same information to track and remove them.  This potentially would be “affirmative \nmisconduct” by the government, and the Dreamers’ detrimental reliance would be self-evident in \nthe information-sharing itself.   \nTherefore, while the Government will not be enjoined from rescinding DACA, given the \nsubstantial risk for irreparable harm in using Dreamers’ DACA-provided information, the Court \n28 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 29 of 30\nwill enjoin the Government from using information provided by Dreamers through the DACA \nprogram for enforcement purposes.  In the event that the Government needs to make use of an \nindividual Dreamer’s information for national security or some purpose implicating public safety \nor  public  interest,  the  Government  may  petition  the  Court  for  permission  to  do  so  on  a \ncase-by-case basis with in camera review.   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIn concluding this Opinion, the Court notes the recent opinion of Judge Gonzalo P. \nCuriel, of the Southern District of California, in which he made observations that aptly apply to \nthis case.  In a case involving a challenge to President Trump’s proposed “border wall,” he noted \nthat the case was “currently the subject of heated political debate,” but that in its review of the \ncase, “the Court cannot and does not consider whether underlying decisions . . . are politically \nwise or prudent.”  In re Border Infrastructure Envtl. Litig., No. CV 17-1215 GPC (WVG), 2018 \nWL 1071702, at *1 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 27, 2018).  For this proposition, he cited the opinion of his \nfellow Indiana native, Chief Justice Roberts, in Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 538 (2012):  “Court[s] are vested with the authority to interpret the law; we possess neither \nthe expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments.  Those decisions are entrusted to our \nNation’s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them.  It is \nnot our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.”   \n  The result of this case is not one that this Court would choose if it were a member of a \ndifferent  branch  of  our  government.    An  overwhelming  percentage  of  Americans  support \nprotections for “Dreamers,” yet it is not the province of the judiciary to provide legislative or \nexecutive actions when those entrusted with those responsibilities fail to act.  As Justice Gorsuch \nnoted during his confirmation hearing, “a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is probably \n29 \n \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 42   Filed 03/05/18   Page 30 of 30\na  pretty  bad  judge,  stretching  for  the  policy  results  he  prefers  rather  than  those  the  law \ncompels.”35   \nThis  Court  does  not  like  the  outcome  of  this  case,  but  is  constrained  by  its \nconstitutionally limited role to the result that it has reached.  Hopefully, the Congress and the \nPresident will finally get their job done.   \n \nDate:  March 5, 2018                         /s/        \nROGER W.

Under \nthat policy, individuals illegally in this country who met certain criteria could receive \ndeferred action, a temporary forbearance from removal that may also entail certain \ncollateral benefits. From its inception, the policy was a stop-gap measure in \nanticipation of potential legislative action, and the government made clear that the \npolicy did not grant any substantive rights, lawful immigration status, or pathway to \ncitizenship. The government later expanded the criteria for DACA and created a new \npolicy known as DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful \nPermanent Residents). Texas and twenty-five other states brought suit challenging the \nlatter policies. The suit led to a nationwide injunction that was affirmed by the Fifth \nCircuit and by an equally divided Supreme Court. Texas then threatened to challenge \nthe original DACA policy. \nIn September 2017, in light of the prior litigation and a legal assessment by the \nAttorney General, the then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security rescinded the \nDACA policy through an orderly wind-down. Plaintiffs in these and other suits \nchallenged that enforcement decision on a variety of grounds under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution.  \nAs an initial matter, the Acting Secretary’s decision is not subject to judicial \nreview in this action. The rescission of DACA was an exercise of enforcement \n \n\ndiscretion that is traditionally committed to agency discretion under the APA. 5 \nU.S.C. § 701(a)(2); Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830-32 (1985). And, assuming \narguendo that judicial review of this deferred-action rescission were available, under the \nterms of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), review could take place only on \nreview of a final removal decision. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b), (g); Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 485 (1999) (AADC). \nAlthough the district court erroneously concluded that it could review the \nActing Secretary’s decision, it properly recognized that any such review would be \nhighly deferential. The court acknowledged that while there is significant room for \ndisagreement over immigration enforcement generally and DACA in particular, such \npolicy decisions belong in the hands of the political branches, and it declined to \ndisturb the Acting Secretary’s decision. The district court was correct.  \nFirst, the rescission of the DACA policy was not arbitrary and capricious under \nthe APA. For this purely discretionary enforcement decision, the INA prescribes no \nlegal or factual determinations that must be made or even considered. There is thus \nno warrant for setting aside the Acting Secretary’s rational decision to discontinue the \nDACA policy in light of the prior nationwide injunction against other closely related \npolicies, as well as the Attorney General’s opinion regarding the legal viability of \nDACA itself.    \nSecond, the district court’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ notice-and-comment challenge \nto the DACA rescission comports with both precedent and common sense. The APA \n2 \n \n\nexempts “general statements of policy” from notice and comment, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(b)(3)(A), and this type of reordering of deferred-action enforcement priorities \nreadily qualifies. Moreover, if the rescission of DACA required notice-and-comment \nrulemaking, the promulgation of that policy surely did as well.  \nThird, the district court correctly rejected plaintiffs’ claim that the Acting \nSecretary’s decision violated the Constitution. There was no denial of equal protection \nbecause the rescission of DACA applies equally to all persons without regard to their \nethnicity. This immigration enforcement policy is not subject to challenge based on \nthe common circumstance that it has a greater impact on members of certain \nethnicities than others, especially given the lack of any evidence that it was a \nsignificant factor in the Acting Secretary’s rescission of a policy of such questionable \nlegality that the aliens lacking lawful status who benefitted from the policy happened \nto be predominantly Latino. Nor was there any denial of due process. Plaintiffs have \nno protected liberty or property interest—DACA expressly conferred no substantive \nrights and was revocable at any time—and plaintiffs regardless have failed to \ndemonstrate any government conduct rising to the level of a substantive-due-process \nviolation. \nFourth, the district court correctly ruled in the government’s favor on the basis \nof the administrative record before it. Plaintiffs come nowhere near demonstrating \nbad faith—or any other ground—for supplementing the administrative record or \nobtaining discovery in this record-review case. \n3 \n \n\nThe district court correctly rejected all of plaintiffs’ challenges to the rescission \nof DACA, but erred in enjoining the government from modifying its policy regarding \nthe sharing of DACA requestors’ information. The court issued this injunction even \nthough (as it acknowledged) plaintiffs had no evidence that the policy had changed, \nand the original policy expressly stated that it could “be modified, superseded, or \nrescinded at any time.” JA.1532. In any event, there is no basis for an equitable \nestoppel claim against the government. The court’s nationwide permanent injunction \nshould be vacated. \nSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION \nPlaintiffs invoked the district court’s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. JA.47. \nOn March 5, 2018, the district court granted in part and denied in part the \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment, and it \ngranted plaintiffs permanent injunctive relief. JA.1519-20. On March 15, the district \ncourt modified the scope of its injunction. JA.1531. Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of \nappeal on April 27, 2018, and the government filed a timely notice of appeal on May \n4, 2018. JA.1534-36; JA.1537-38. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES \n1. Whether plaintiffs’ APA claims are not subject to review because the Acting \nSecretary’s decision to wind down the DACA non-enforcement policy was \n“committed to agency discretion by law,” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). \n4 \n \n\n2. Whether the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs’ claims in \nlight of the jurisdiction-channeling provisions in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) and (g). \n3. Whether, assuming judicial review is available, the district court correctly \nheld that the Acting Secretary’s decision was not arbitrary and capricious on the basis \nof the administrative record. \n4. Whether the district court correctly concluded that the rescission of a non-\nenforcement policy is not required to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  \n5. Whether the district court correctly rejected plaintiffs’ contentions that the \nActing Secretary’s decision violated equal-protection and due-process requirements. \n6. Whether the district court erred in entering a nationwide injunction barring \nthe government from altering its information-sharing policy. \nPERTINENT STATUTES AND REGULATIONS \nPertinent statutes and regulations are reproduced in the addendum to this brief. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA.  Overview of “deferred action” and the Acting Secretary’s \ndecision to wind down the discretionary DACA non-\nenforcement policy \n1. The INA charges the Secretary of Homeland Security “with the \nadministration and enforcement” of the INA and “all other laws relating to the \nimmigration and naturalization of aliens.” 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1). Individuals are \nsubject to removal if, inter alia, “they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have been \n5 \n \n\nconvicted of certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law.” Arizona v. United \nStates, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012); see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a), 1227(a).  \nAs a practical matter, the federal government cannot remove every removable \nalien, and a “principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised \nby immigration officials.” Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396. The Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity is vested with authority to “[e]stablish[ ] national immigration enforcement \npolicies and priorities.” 6 U.S.C. § 202(5). In light of such policies and priorities, \nofficials of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must first “decide whether \nit makes sense to pursue removal at all.” Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396. “At each stage” of \nthe process, moreover, “the Executive has discretion to abandon the endeavor.” \nAADC, 525 U.S. at 483. Like other exercises of enforcement discretion, this may \ninvolve “a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within \n[the agency’s] expertise.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831.  \n2. This case concerns an application of the practice of “deferred action” by \nwhich the Secretary of Homeland Security may exercise discretion to forbear from \nseeking the removal of an alien for a designated period. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 483-\n84; 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) (describing “deferred action” as “an act of administrative \nconvenience to the government which gives some cases lower priority”). In addition \nto the temporary relief from removal directly flowing from a grant of deferred action, \ncertain collateral consequences may flow under pre-existing laws and regulations, \nincluding the ability to obtain work authorization in certain circumstances. See, e.g.,  \n6 \n \n\n8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14). However, DHS retains the discretion to revoke deferred \naction unilaterally, and an individual with deferred action remains removable at any \ntime. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 484-85. \nOn June 15, 2012, DHS announced the policy known as DACA, which makes \ndeferred action available to “certain young people who were brought to this country \nas children.” JA.129. Following successful completion of a background check and \nreview, an alien who met certain age, residence, and other guidelines could receive \ndeferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal. JA.130-31. The DACA \nMemorandum stated that it “confer[red] no substantive right, immigration status or \npathway to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can \nconfer these rights.” JA.131. In implementing DACA, DHS stated that information \nprovided in the DACA request process would be protected from disclosure for the \npurpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless certain criteria related to \nnational security or public safety were satisfied, or the individual met the requirements \nfor a Notice to Appear. USCIS, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Frequently Asked \nQuestions, No. 19 (last updated Oct. 6, 2017; last visited July 31, 2018), \nhttps://go.usa.gov/xngCd (DHS DACA FAQ). The instructions also stated, \nhowever, that the information-sharing policy “may be modified, superseded or \nrescinded at any time without notice,” and that it “may not be relied upon to create \nany right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any \nadministrative, civil, or criminal matter.” DHS DACA FAQ 19.  \n7 \n \n\nOn November 20, 2014, DHS expanded DACA by broadening certain \nguidelines and extending the period of deferred action to three years. JA.167. It also \ncreated a new, similar policy known as DAPA for parents of American citizens and \nlawful permanent residents. JA.168-69. \nThe District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a nationwide \npreliminary injunction against DAPA and the expansion of DACA. Texas v. United \nStates, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (S.D. Tex. 2015). The Fifth Circuit affirmed, concluding \nthat the policy violated both the INA and the APA’s notice-and-comment \nrequirements. Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015). The Supreme Court \naffirmed the injunction by an equally divided Court. United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. \n2271 (2016) (per curiam). In response, then-Secretary John Kelly rescinded DAPA \nand the DACA expansion in June 2017. JA.363. Shortly thereafter, Texas threatened \nto challenge the original DACA policy. JA.366-68. \n3. On September 5, 2017, DHS issued a memorandum explaining its decision \nto wind down the remaining DACA policy in an orderly fashion. JA.380. As then-\nActing Secretary Elaine Duke explained in the memorandum, “[t]aking into \nconsideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing \nlitigation, and [a] September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that \nthe June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated.” JA.383. Therefore, “[i]n the \nexercise of [her] authority in establishing national immigration policies and priorities,” \nthe Acting Secretary determined to begin an orderly wind-down of the policy. Id. The \n8 \n \n\nmemorandum provides that DHS will “adjudicate—on an individual, case-by-case \nbasis—properly filed pending DACA renewal requests . . . from current beneficiaries \nwhose benefits will expire between the date of this memorandum and March 5, 2018 \nthat have been accepted by the Department as of October 5, 2017.” Id. The \nmemorandum further provides that DHS “[w]ill not terminate the grants of \npreviously issued deferred action or revoke Employment Authorization Documents \nsolely based on the directives in this memorandum” for the remaining periods of \ndeferred action. Id.  \nUpon the rescission of DACA, DHS reiterated that “[g]enerally, information \nprovided in DACA requests will not be proactively provided to other law \nenforcement entities . . . for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings” \nunless national security or public safety exceptions apply or the individual “meets the \ncriteria for issuance of Notice to Appear.” JA.1143. In December 2017, DHS further \nclarified that the “information-sharing policy has not changed in any way since it was \nfirst announced, including as a result of the Sept. 5, 2017” DACA rescission. USCIS, \nGuidance on Rejected DACA Requests, www.uscis.gov/daca2017/guidance-rejected-\ndaca2017 (Q5). \n4. On June 22, 2018, in response to an order from the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia in NAACP v. Trump, No. 17-1907 (D.D.C.), the \nSecretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum further explaining the decision \nto rescind DACA. The new memorandum agrees with the reasoning of the Duke \n9 \n \n\nmemorandum and declines to disturb it. Memorandum from Secretary Kirstjen M. \nNielsen 2-3 (Nielsen Memo), https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ \n18_0622_S1_Memorandum_DACA.pdf. In particular, the Secretary confirms that, \nalthough she agrees that DACA is unlawful, the rescission is not predicated solely on \nthat legal determination. The Nielsen Memo explains that, whether or not DACA is \nactually unlawful, “there are, at a minimum, serious doubts about [the policy’s] \nlegality” that warrant its discontinuation. Id. at 2. The Nielsen Memo also offers other \nenforcement policy reasons wholly independent of DACA’s legality that support the \npolicy’s rescission, and explains why the asserted reliance interests of DACA \nrecipients do not lead to a different result. Id. at 2-3.  \nB.  Prior proceedings  \n1. Plaintiffs in this case are individual DACA recipients and nonprofit \nimmigrant services and policy organizations. Their complaint seeks to invalidate the \nrescission of DACA on APA, constitutional, and equitable grounds. See JA.85-96. \nPlaintiffs also challenge DHS’s authority to change its policy regarding how it may use \ninformation provided by DACA requesters. See JA.87-89, JA.94-95.  \n  2. In March 2018, the district court issued an order granting in part and denying \nin part the government’s motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary \njudgment, and granting summary judgment in part for the plaintiffs and in part for the \ngovernment. JA.1533. The district court first held that plaintiffs’ claims were \njusticiable, rejecting the argument that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) precluded judicial review \n10 \n \n\nand concluding that the APA’s exception for decisions “committed to agency \ndiscretion” by law does not preclude procedural review of agency action, which it \ncharacterized plaintiffs’ APA claims to be. JA.1501.  \n  On the merits of the APA claims, the district court held that DACA and the \nDACA rescission are “akin to non-binding policy statements” and therefore are not \nsubject to notice-and-comment requirements. JA.1505. The district court also \nconcluded that the DACA rescission was not arbitrary and capricious because “the \nbelief that it was unlawful and subject to serious legal challenge [was] completely \nrational,” and the rescission “was a carefully crafted decision supported by the \nAdministrative Record.” JA.1505-06. \n  The district court likewise rejected plaintiffs’ constitutional claims. With respect \nto the equal protection claim, the court concluded that the administrative record \n“does not support the notion that [the government] was targeting a subset of the \nimmigrant population” or that the decision was motivated by racial animus. JA.1508. \nThe district court also held that plaintiffs were not deprived of a protected procedural \ndue process interest because the DACA decision did not create any such interest. \nJA.1512-13. And the court further found no substantive due process violation because \nthe DACA rescission did “not shock the conscience of th[e] Court.” JA.1514. The \ndistrict court also granted summary judgment for the government with respect to \nplaintiffs’ claim that the government was estopped from rescinding DACA, \n11 \n \n\nconcluding that estoppel did not apply because DACA was expressly subject to \nrevocation at any time and did not confer any rights. JA.1515. \nThe district court granted relief to plaintiffs, however, on their estoppel claim \nregarding the government’s information-sharing policy. The district court concluded \nwithout analysis that the government “promised not to transfer or use the \ninformation gathered from Dreamers for immigration enforcement.” JA.1515. \nAlthough the district court did not dispute the government’s assurance that the \ninformation-sharing policy has not changed, it noted that “counsel for the \nGovernment was unable to provide any assurance that the Government would not \nmake changes” in the future. JA.1516. Accordingly, the court entered a permanent \ninjunction that, as amended, requires the government to comply with its 2012 policy, \nexcept that the government may no longer modify or rescind that policy. The \ninjunction further requires “any requests for deviation to be submitted to the district \ncourt for in camera review.” JA.1532-33.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe district court correctly declined to disturb Acting Secretary Duke’s \nmemorandum rescinding the discretionary DACA enforcement policy. The district \ncourt erred, however, in enjoining the government from modifying its information-\nsharing policy in the future. \nI. As an initial matter, the district court should have dismissed plaintiffs’ APA \nclaims as non-justiciable. In rescinding the previous non-enforcement policy \n12 \n \n\nembodied in DACA, the Acting Secretary reset the agency’s enforcement priorities. A \ndetermination of general enforcement policy, like other enforcement decisions, is \ntraditionally committed to agency discretion by law and thus not subject to APA \nclaims. See 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985). That is \nparticularly true in the immigration context, where the “broad discretion exercised by \nimmigration officials” is a “principal feature of the removal system.” Arizona v. United \nStates, 567 U.S. 387, 396-97 (2012). That the Acting Secretary’s discretionary \nenforcement decision was based on legal analysis is immaterial, because the fact that \nan “agency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action” does not \nmean that “the action becomes reviewable.” ICC v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng’rs, 482 \nU.S. 270, 283 (1987) (BLE) (emphases added).  \nNothing in the INA cabins that discretion here. To the contrary, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g) precludes jurisdiction over challenges to “‘no deferred action’ decisions and \nsimilar discretionary determinations . . . outside the streamlined process that Congress \nhas designed” for litigating an alien’s removal. Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination \nComm., 525 U.S. 471, 485 & n.9 (1999) (AADC); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9). Thus, \neven if the Acting Secretary’s exercise of enforcement discretion were subject to \nreview at all, that review could take place only in a petition from a final removal order.  \nII. In any event, the district court correctly concluded that the decision plainly \nsatisfies the APA’s deferential standard. Regardless whether the original DACA policy \nwas consistent with the INA, there is no claim that it was mandated by the statute or \n13 \n \n\nthat rescinding it violated the statute. And the Acting Secretary’s discretionary \nrescission of DACA based on her clearly expressed concern that it would be \nenmeshed in litigation and likely enjoined nationwide was eminently reasonable, given \nthe Texas litigation invalidating DAPA and expanded DACA, as well as the Attorney \nGeneral’s opinion that DACA would and should meet the same fate. Neither \nprecedent nor the APA required the Secretary to spell out the subsidiary legal reasons \nwhy it is illusory to distinguish DACA from expanded DACA and DAPA, and there \nlikewise is no basis for a court to set aside the Secretary’s purely discretionary \nenforcement decision based on mere disagreement with her reasonable legal \nconclusion. All the more so now that Secretary Nielsen has issued a memorandum \nfurther explaining the rescission and agreeing with Acting Secretary Duke’s decision.  \nContrary to plaintiffs’ contentions, the district court properly ruled based on \nthe administrative record before it. “The APA specifically contemplates judicial review \non the basis of the agency record,” and “[t]he focal point for judicial review should be \nthe administrative record already in existence, not some new record made initially in \nthe reviewing court.” Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 743-44 (1985). \nPlaintiffs have wholly failed to make the strong showing of bad faith required to rebut \nthe rule that discovery is not permitted in an APA suit. See Citizens to Preserve Overton \nPark v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971). \nThe district court also correctly concluded that plaintiffs’ procedural APA \nclaims fail. The rescission memorandum was plainly a general statement of policy, not \n14 \n \n\na substantive rule. See Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1016 (9th Cir.1987). It \nthus was not required to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking. \nThe district court was similarly correct that the Acting Secretary’s decision in \nno way violates the Constitution. The DACA rescission applies equally to persons of \nall ethnicities, although, like virtually all immigration policies, it has a disproportionate \neffect on certain ethnicities—here, Latinos from Central and South America. A \nchallenge to such a facially-neutral immigration enforcement policy based on \nallegations of discriminatory motive is not permitted under AADC. 525 U.S. at 488-\n92. And, even assuming such a challenge could proceed at all under AADC, plaintiffs \nhave come nowhere near alleging the clear evidence of outrageous government \nconduct necessary to make out a claim of discriminatory enforcement in the \nimmigration context. Id. The district court also correctly rejected plaintiffs’ \ncontentions that the rescission of DACA violated the protections of the Due Process \nClause. DACA itself created no protected liberty or property interest, and its \nrescission does not shock the conscience.  \nIII. Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate entitlement to the injunction entered \nby the district court. Even assuming a freestanding equitable estoppel claim against \nthe government were permissible, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate any change in \nthe government’s information-sharing policy, which has always permitted \nmodification. And, even assuming a change occurred, plaintiffs have not \ndemonstrated the affirmative misconduct required to make out an equitable estoppel \n15 \n \n\nclaim. At a minimum, the district court erred in granting plaintiffs nationwide relief. \nBedrock principles of standing and equitable discretion limit the scope of any \ninjunction to plaintiffs in these cases. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA district court’s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. Hill v. \nLockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., 354 F.3d 277, 283 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc). \nSummary judgment may be granted where there are no disputes of “material fact,” and \n“facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there \nis a ‘genuine’ dispute as to those facts.” Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007) \n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). The district court’s grant of a permanent injunction is \nreviewed for abuse of discretion, but it is per se an abuse of discretion to commit an \nerror of law, which is reviewed de novo. Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon, Inc. v. Alpha of \nVirginia, Inc., 43 F.3d 922, 939 (4th Cir. 1995). \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Acting Secretary’s Rescission of the Discretionary DACA \nEnforcement Policy Is Not Subject to Judicial Review. \nA.  The decision is not subject to APA review because it is \ncommitted to agency discretion by law. \n1.  The APA precludes review of agency actions that are “committed to agency \ndiscretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). This provision applies to various types of \nagency decisions that “traditionally” have been regarded as unsuitable for judicial \nreview, Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993), including the decision whether or not \n16 \n \n\nto institute enforcement actions, Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. Such decisions are similar in \nsignificant ways to a prosecutor’s decision whether or not to indict—“a decision \nwhich has long been regarded as the special province of the Executive Branch.” Id. at \n832; United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (“[T]he decision whether or not \nto prosecute . . . generally rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s] discretion.” (emphasis \nadded)). Such discretionary enforcement actions “cannot be the subject of judicial \nreview” even when an agency (or a prosecutor) bases them on what would be “a \n‘reviewable’ reason” in another context. BLE, 482 U.S. at 283. \nThe Acting Secretary’s decision to discontinue a prior non-enforcement policy \nfalls well within the types of enforcement decisions that traditionally have been \nunderstood as “committed to agency discretion.” Like the decision to adopt a policy \nof selective non-enforcement, the decision whether to retain such a policy can \n“involve[] a complicated balancing” of factors that are “peculiarly within [the \nagency’s] expertise,” including determining how the agency’s resources are best spent \nand how the non-enforcement policy fits with the agency’s overall policies. Chaney, \n470 U.S. at 831. Likewise, a decision to abandon an existing non-enforcement policy \nwill not, in itself, affect “an individual’s liberty or property rights, and thus does not \ninfringe upon areas that courts often are called upon to protect.” Id. at 832. Indeed, an \nagency’s decision to reverse a prior policy of civil non-enforcement is akin to changes \nin policy as to criminal prosecutorial discretion, which regularly occur within the \nDepartment of Justice both during and across presidential administrations, and which, \n17 \n \n\nas noted, are generally not amenable to judicial review. Judicial review is available if a \ndecision to enforce results in an adverse final determination that deprives an \nindividual of liberty or property, but that review is limited to the substance of the final \ndetermination; an individual cannot escape guilt of the criminal or civil offense by \nbringing an APA challenge to an agency’s discretionary decision to enforce the law.    \nThis presumption of non-reviewability applies with particular force in the \ncontext of immigration enforcement discretion. In general, the “broad discretion \nexercised by immigration officials” has become a “principal feature of the removal \nsystem.” Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396; see also, e.g., 6 U.S.C. § 202(5) (vesting authority in \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to “[e]stablish[] national immigration enforcement \npolicies and priorities”). And more specifically, a suit challenging a discretionary \ndecision to enforce the immigration laws would entail the extraordinary relief of \nordering the government to allow a “continuing violation of United States law.” \nAADC, 525 U.S. at 490. The revocation of a prior immigration non-enforcement \npolicy is thus plainly a decision that is “committed to agency discretion by law,” 5 \nU.S.C. § 701(a)(2), and not subject to attack under the APA. \n2.  The district court did not engage with any of this precedent. Instead, the \ncourt held that “[p]laintiffs’ APA claims are justiciable because they relate to the \nprocedures followed by DHS—not to the substance of its policy” and a court “may review \nwhether the repeal of DACA followed the correct APA procedures.” JA 1501. Even \non its own terms, this reasoning overlooks that plaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious \n18 \n \n\nclaim is substantive, not procedural. See, e.g., National Ass’n of Home Builders v. EPA, 682 \nF.3d 1032, 1042 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (distinguishing “the APA’s procedural dictates” \nfrom “its substantive command that agency decisionmaking not be ‘arbitrary’ or \n‘capricious’”). The district court then declared it “important to note” that the Acting \nSecretary had rescinded DACA based on her “belief that the program was unlawful \nand would face lengthy legal challenges.” JA.1501. To the extent that the court found \nplaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious claim justiciable on that basis, it further erred.   \nIn BLE, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the proposition that “if the \nagency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action, the action \nbecomes reviewable.” 482 U.S. at 283. By way of example, the Court observed that “a \ncommon reason for failure to prosecute an alleged criminal violation is the \nprosecutor’s belief (sometimes publicly stated) that the law will not sustain a \nconviction,” yet “it is entirely clear that the refusal to prosecute cannot be the subject \nof judicial review” notwithstanding that the prosecutor’s belief “is surely an eminently \n‘reviewable’ proposition.” Id. Thus, after BLE, a court cannot justify judicial review of \nan agency’s discretionary enforcement decision (an “otherwise unreviewable action”) \nsimply on the ground that the decision was based on a general interpretation of law. \nSee Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 675-76 (D.C. Cir. 1994) \n(explaining that BLE settles the question whether “Chaney’s presumption of non-\nreviewability is inapplicable when the agency bases its refusal to enforce in an \nindividual case solely on a legal interpretation without explicitly relying on its \n19 \n \n\nenforcement discretion”). A legal rationale cannot provide a hook to support review \nof the underlying enforcement decision. \nIn some circumstances, though, the legal rationale can be reviewable on its own, \nfor example when an agency provides a definitive interpretation of a statute’s \nsubstantive command in the course of announcing a general policy. See Crowley, 37 \nF.3d at 677 (explaining that there was no substantive interpretation in the single-shot \nenforcement action at issue, but that a reviewable embedded interpretation might be \n“more likely” to exist in a general enforcement policy). This distinction between the \nunreviewability of an enforcement decision and the possible reviewability of its legal \nrationale is well illustrated by UAW v. Brock, 783 F.2d 237 (D.C. Cir. 1986). In Brock, \nthe D.C. Circuit explained that “there is no review available from [an] agency’s \nspecific nonenforcement decision . . . or its overall pattern of decisions not to pursue \nenforcement action in these areas.” Id. at 245; see also id. (“If the Union had challenged \nonly the Department’s decision not to take enforcement action against [certain \nentities], or even against this entire genus of practices, our task would be completed.” \n(emphasis added)). But the court went on to hold that “when a legal challenge focuses \non an announcement of a substantive statutory interpretation,” judicial review is \navailable. Id.  \nThese cases demonstrate (1) where an enforcement decision is otherwise \nunreviewable, a court may not use the fact that the decision rests on a general legal \nrationale as a hook to permit judicial review of the underlying enforcement decision; \n20 \n \n\nand (2) where an unreviewable enforcement decision rests on a general legal \ninterpretation of the statute’s substantive commands, a court may in certain situations \n“carve out” that embedded interpretive rule for review and vacatur (assuming that \nother prerequisites to judicial review are met), but it may not set aside the underlying \nenforcement decision.  \nApplying these principles, plaintiffs’ substantive APA claim is not subject to \njudicial review. Even assuming arguendo that the sole rationale for the Acting \nSecretary’s decision was that DACA is unlawful, that legal rationale could not be used \nas a hook to review the otherwise unreviewable enforcement decision to rescind \nDACA. As explained, such review is directly contrary to BLE. Nor would review of \nthe legal rationale alone, as an interpretive rule embedded in the underlying \nenforcement policy decision, justify setting aside the rescission of DACA itself. Any \nembedded legal interpretation here would concern, at most, the scope of the Acting \nSecretary’s enforcement discretion. But that interpretation does not govern the \nbehavior of the parties—no one disputes that DACA recipients are removable under \nthe statute. Indeed, the decision at issue here rests on enforcement discretion all the \nway down.  \n3. Plaintiffs did not address this aspect of the district court’s ruling in their \nopening brief on appeal, but they did advance several arguments below in support of \ntheir position that their substantive APA claim is justiciable. None has merit. \n21 \n \n\nFirst, plaintiffs suggested that “the relevant substantive law that the government \ncited as the basis for the rescission” provided “judicially manageable standards by \nwhich a court can evaluate Plaintiffs’ APA claims.” JA.482. As explained above, it is \nboth well established and common sense that an agency’s discretionary decision \nwhether to enforce a law is not made reviewable because it is based on an \nunderstanding of governing law. See supra pp. 18-21.     \nRather, for an enforcement decision to be reviewable, the “law to apply” must \ndepart from tradition by “circumscrib[ing] agency enforcement discretion” and \n“provid[ing] meaningful standards for defining the limits of that discretion.” Chaney, \n470 U.S. at 834. Such limits might be found in the statute that provides the agency \nwith enforcement discretion, if Congress has set “substantive priorities” or otherwise \nlimited “an agency’s power to discriminate among issues or cases it will pursue.” Id. at \n833; see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 168 (5th Cir. 2015) (holding that court \ncould review whether DAPA ran afoul of alleged INA constraints on enforcement \ndiscretion). But neither plaintiffs nor the district court have identified anything in the \nINA that limited DHS’s discretion in rescinding DACA.1   \n                                                 \n1 Constitutional constraints on enforcement discretion also are traditionally \nreviewable and provide meaningful standards to apply. See Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. \n592, 603-04 (1988). Review of plaintiffs’ constitutional claims is therefore not \nprecluded by § 701(a)(2), although those claims are separately barred here by 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g) and are meritless in any event. See infra Part II.C . \n22 \n \n\nSecond, plaintiffs argued that Chaney’s presumption does not apply because that \ncase is “based on the recognition that courts are not well placed to second-guess an \nagency’s balancing of . . . factors which are particularly in within its expertise,” and \n“the Government has not engaged in any ‘balancing’ of individualized factors.” \nJA.484-85; see also JA.482-83. But this argument merely repackages the analysis \nforeclosed by BLE and Chaney. Where a discretionary enforcement decision is \ntraditionally unreviewable because there is no statutory or regulatory constraint on the \nexercise of that discretion, a court may not review the agency’s decision regardless of \nwhat factors the agency chooses to consider in making that decision, including even if \nthe agency believes for legal reasons that it lacks any discretion at all. Notably, Chaney \nidentified the balancing of discretionary factors as only one of “many” reasons for the \n“general unsuitability for judicial review” of agency enforcement decisions, and \nemphasized as well that enforcement decisions have “long been regarded as the \nspecial province of the Executive Branch.” 470 U.S. at 831-32. \nIndeed, this argument is in significant tension with the facts of Chaney itself. \nThe FDA’s decision not to take enforcement actions with respect to lethal injection \ndrugs relied on both enforcement discretion policy and a perceived lack of \njurisdiction. 470 U.S. at 824. The Supreme Court did not call into question the nature \nof the agency’s policy decision despite the agency’s alternative conclusion. And, in any \nevent, the DACA rescission did involve discretionary balancing, because it rested in \npart on enforcement-discretion concerns about legality and litigation risk.  \n23 \n \n\nThird, plaintiffs argued that the DACA rescission is reviewable because it is “a \nbroad agency enforcement policy.” JA.483. This argument is also inconsistent with the \nfacts of Chaney. The non-enforcement decision in that case was not an individualized \ndecision by the FDA to forgo enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct against a single alleged violator. Rather, the plaintiffs in Chaney requested the FDA \nto enforce the statute’s misbranding prohibition against the use of certain drugs for \ncapital punishment, by taking “various investigatory and enforcement actions” against \n“drug manufacturers,” “prison administrators,” and “all [others] in the chain of \ndistribution”; the FDA, however, categorically concluded that its enforcement discretion \n“should not be exercised to interfere with this particular aspect of state criminal \njustice systems.” 470 U.S. at 824-25. In short, the question under Section 701(a)(2) is \nwhether the type of agency decision at issue is inherently discretionary in nature, not \nthe number of people to whom it applies. \nCommon sense would dictate this conclusion even if it were not already settled \nlaw. Individual enforcement decisions are regularly informed by general \ninterpretations of the agency’s substantive statute to determine “whether a violation \nhas occurred.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831; see BLE, 482 U.S. at 283 (“[A] common reason \nfor failure to prosecute an alleged criminal violation is the prosecutor’s belief \n(sometimes publicly stated) that the law will not sustain a conviction.”). Similarly, \nagency decisions about how its “resources are best spent” or how certain \nenforcement activity “best fits the agency’s overall policies,” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831, \n24 \n \n\nare at least as susceptible to implementation through broad guidance as through case-\nby-case enforcement decisions. See, e.g., Alaska Fish & Wildlife Federation & Outdoor \nCouncil, Inc. v. Dunkle, 829 F.2d 933, 935, 938 (9th Cir. 1987) (holding unreviewable “a \nwritten policy stating that subsistence hunting in Alaska during the closed season \nwould not be punished” because “traditional methods of enforcing game laws are not \neffective in the vast reaches of rural Alaska”).2  \nFourth, plaintiffs argue that the Acting Secretary’s decision was reviewable \nbecause, rather than adopting a non-enforcement policy, it rescinded one. Their \nsuggestion that the Chaney presumption applies only to “attempt[s] to obtain judicial \nreview of an agency decision not to act,” JA.485, is foreclosed by this Court’s decision \nin Speed Mining, Inc. v. Federal Mine Safety & Health Review Commission, 528 F.3d 310 (4th \nCir. 2008). In that case, the owner-operator of a coal mine contended that the \nSecretary of Labor abused her discretion in issuing citations for safety violations. The \nCourt held that the decision was unreviewable, explaining that an “agency’s exercise \nof its enforcement discretion,” even when that discretion is exercised to enforce the law, \nis “an area in which the courts have traditionally been most reluctant to interfere.” Id. \nat 318. \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiffs below cited Kenney v. Glickman, 96 F.3d 1118, 1124 (8th Cir. 1996), \nbut that case involved “policy decisions based on the [agency’s] interpretation” of the \nsubstantive commands of a statute, not the scope of its enforcement discretion. \n25 \n \n\nFifth, plaintiffs further suggested that the Acting Secretary’s “affirmative . . . \naction rescinding protected interests that have been granted to Dreamers provid[es] a \nclear focus for judicial review.” JA.486. But the premise of this argument—that DHS \nmade a commitment to certain persons unlawfully in the country—is incorrect. \nIndeed, DHS made explicit when it adopted the DACA non-enforcement policy that \n“[t]his memorandum confers no substantive right.” JA.131.3  \nMore fundamentally, any reliance interests would not justify judicial review of \notherwise-non-reviewable acts of discretion. In Lincoln, for example, the Indian Health \nService had operated its regional program for seven years, providing important \nmedical treatment to disabled children on which the recipients had undoubtedly come \nto rely. See 508 U.S. at 185-88. Notwithstanding that reliance, the Supreme Court held \nthat the Service’s discretionary decision to discontinue the program by reallocating a \nlump-sum appropriation was non-reviewable. Id. at 193-94.   \nNor does the availability of review turn on the significance of a plaintiff’s \nasserted interest in an agency’s discretionary enforcement decision. The Supreme \nCourt made this clear in Chaney, where plaintiffs offered “evidence that use of the \ndrugs [that FDA declined to regulate] could lead to a cruel and protracted death.” 470 \n                                                 \n3 Robbins v. Regan, 780 F.2d 37, 47 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam), which involved \na “rescission of commitments,” is therefore inapposite. That case also did not involve \nan exercise of enforcement discretion—the challenged agency action was the alleged \nrefusal to provide previously agreed upon funding for renovations of a homeless \nshelter. \n26 \n \n\nU.S. at 827. Holding that it could not properly review the agency’s decision, the \nSupreme Court emphasized that “[t]he fact that the drugs involved in this case are \nultimately to be used in imposing the death penalty must not lead this Court or other \ncourts to import profound differences of opinion over the meaning of the Eighth \nAmendment . . . into the domain of administrative law.” Id. at 838.   \nIn sum, none of plaintiffs’ reasons, individually or collectively, justify applying \nAPA review to the Acting Secretary’s discretionary decision to rescind the DACA \nnon-enforcement policy. And it warrants emphasis that those reasons, if accepted by \nthis Court, would lead to a radical and untenable intrusion on agencies’ enforcement \ndiscretion. Consider the following example of a quintessential exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion: one chief prosecutor adopts a general policy of not enforcing \ndrug laws against low-level, non-violent offenders because she views them as victims \nof circumstance who should receive treatment and support; but her successor then \nrescinds that non-enforcement policy based on her legal concerns that the policy \nwould violate her duty to faithfully execute the laws and provide equal treatment to \ndefendants. The district court’s analysis in this case would allow drug offenders in that \ncircumstance, who are concededly guilty, to nevertheless seek judicial review of the \nlegal reasoning underlying the second prosecutor’s discretionary decision to enforce \nthe drug laws in a different manner than her predecessor. That is not, and cannot \npossibly be, the law. \n27 \n \n\nB.  8 U.S.C. § 1252 bars pre-enforcement review of plaintiffs’ \nclaims. \n1. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252, judicial review of DHS enforcement decisions is \ngenerally available, if at all, only through the procedures for reviewing removal orders \nset forth in that section. As relevant here, section 1252(g) states that “[e]xcept as \nprovided in this section . . . no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim \nby or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the [Secretary] to \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien \nunder this subchapter.” As the Supreme Court explained in AADC, section 1252(g) \nis “designed to give some measure of protection to ‘no deferred action’ decisions and \nsimilar discretionary determinations, providing that if they are reviewable at all, they at \nleast will not be made the bases for separate rounds of judicial intervention outside \nthe streamlined process that Congress has designed.” See 525 U.S. at 485 & n.9.   \nThe Acting Secretary’s rescission of DACA is such a “‘no deferred action’ \ndecision[],” AADC, 525 U.S. at 485, and is an initial “action” in the agency’s \n“commence[ment] [of ] proceedings” against aliens who are unlawfully in the country, \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Thus, even assuming that the DACA rescission were reviewable, it \nwould be reviewable only as otherwise “provided in [Section 1252],” id.—that is, \nthrough “[ j]udicial review of a final order of removal,” id. § 1252(a)(1). See, e.g., \nVasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898, 901 (3d Cir. 2016); Botezatu v. INS, 195 F.3d 311, \n314 (7th Cir. 1999). That review of a final order of removal is the sole avenue for \n28 \n \n\njudicial review is underscored by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9), which channels into the review \nof final removal orders all questions of law or fact arising from any action taken to \nremove an alien. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 483 (characterizing section 1252(b)(9) as an \n“unmistakable ‘zipper’ clause”); see also Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, \n207 (1994).  \nThe limitation on review here is consistent with the review procedures for \nother kinds of discretionary DHS actions. For example, under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B), “no court shall have jurisdiction to review” judgments regarding the \ngrant or denial of specified forms of discretionary relief—including cancellation of \nremoval, voluntary departure, certain waivers of inadmissibility, and adjustment of \nstatus. See id. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, \n1255). Congress provided a limited exception to that jurisdictional bar for “review of \nconstitutional claims or questions of law,” id. § 1252(a)(2)(D), but it mandated that \nany such review occur only “upon a petition for review [of a final order of removal] \nfiled with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section,” id.; see, e.g., \nGreen v. Napolitano, 627 F.3d 1341, 1347 (10th Cir. 2010).  \n2. The district court failed to grapple with the government’s argument that \nreview here is barred by the INA, stating only that “the notion that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) \nprecludes judicial review has been rejected repeatedly” and citing AADC. JA.1501.  \nBut AADC supports the government’s position in this case. As explained, in \nAADC, the Supreme Court recognized the INA is “designed to give some measure \n29 \n \n\nof protection to ‘no deferred action’ decisions and similar discretionary \ndeterminations, providing that if they are reviewable at all, they at least will not be \nmade the bases for separate rounds of judicial intervention outside the streamlined \nprocess that Congress has designed.” See 525 U.S. at 485 & n.9. The INA affords such \nprotection by channeling legal challenges to such decisions into review of final \nremoval orders, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) and 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9). Plaintiffs \ncannot frustrate the INA’s reticulated review scheme by filing suit before the agency \nhas officially initiated an enforcement proceeding. \nThe Supreme Court’s recent decision in Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 \n(2018), does not counsel a different result. The plurality opinion described AADC as \nhaving interpreted section 1252(g) not “to sweep in any claim that can technically be \nsaid to ‘arise from’ the three listed actions of the Attorney General,” but rather “to \nrefer to just those three specific actions themselves.” Id. at 841. But the opinion \nmerely emphasized that the plaintiffs there fell outside of AADC ’s interpretation of \nsection 1252(g) because they were challenging the conditions and length of detention \nancillary to the removal process—in other words, “[they were] not asking for review \nof an order of removal; they [were] not challenging the decision to detain them in the \nfirst place or to seek removal; and they [were] not even challenging any part of the \nprocess by which their removability will be determined.” Id. Here, by contrast, the \nlegal questions at issue arise from a challenge to an ingredient to commencement of \n30 \n \n\nremoval—the rescission of deferred-action forbearance from removal—and review is \ntherefore barred under section 1252(g) and AADC. Id. at 841 n.3.  \nIf anything, Jennings underscores the fact that section 1252(b)(9), which \nchannels all legal and factual questions “arising from any action taken or proceeding \nbrought to remove an alien” into final removal orders, also bars plaintiffs’ claims. \nUnder both the plurality’s and concurrence’s interpretation of section 1252(b)(9), see \n138 S. Ct. at 839-41 (plurality op.); id. at 852-53 (Thomas, J., concurring in the \njudgment), plaintiffs’ claims in this case “aris[e] from” an “action taken” in the \nremoval process.  \nII.  The District Court Correctly Held That the Rescission of DACA \nWas Lawful. \nA.  The district court correctly held that the DACA rescission \nwas not arbitrary and capricious. \nEven if the Acting Secretary’s decision were reviewable under the APA, it was \nplainly not “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). As the district court correctly emphasized \nin so holding, JA.1505, the APA standard of review is “narrow,” Motor Vehicles Mfrs. \nAss’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983): “[A] court is not to \nsubstitute its judgment” for the agency’s reasonable judgment, id., and should “uphold \na decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned,” \nBowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974).  \n31 \n \n\n1.  The district court correctly concluded that it was not \narbitrary and capricious to rescind DACA because it \nwas subject to serious legal challenge. \na. It is uncontroverted that nothing in the INA requires any aspect of the \nDACA policy. Plaintiffs’ claim, instead, is that once an agency has adopted a purely \ndiscretionary non-enforcement policy, it must provide a robust explanation for a \ndecision to pursue a different enforcement policy. Unsurprisingly, plaintiffs have not \nidentified any authority for this proposition. Nor can they seriously dispute the district \ncourt’s conclusion that it was reasonable for the Secretary to act based on the \nsignificant legal risks presented by maintaining a policy (original DACA) that was \nmaterially indistinguishable to ones (expanded DACA and DAPA) that had been \nenjoined nationwide by the Fifth Circuit in a decision affirmed by an equally divided \nSupreme Court. This is especially so in the face of a threat by Texas and other States \nto challenge DACA on the same grounds. As the district court explained, “[r]egardless \nof whether DACA is, in fact, lawful or unlawful, the belief that it was unlawful and \nsubject to serious legal challenge is completely rational.” JA.1506. “DAPA—an \nanalogous program, promulgated by analogous means,” the court explained “had been \ndefeated less than a year prior” and “[t]he same plaintiffs who defeated DAPA \nthreatened to challenge DACA imminently.” Id. “[I]nstead of the chaotic possibility of \nan immediate termination,” the Acting Secretary “opted for a six-month wind-down \nperiod.” Id.  \n32 \n \n\nThe district court was correct. In Texas v. United States, the Fifth Circuit had \nconcluded that DAPA and expanded DACA were unlawful on both procedural and \nsubstantive grounds. 809 F.3d at 178; see id. at 147 n.11 (including the “DACA \nexpansions” within the opinion’s references to “DAPA”). The entirety of the Fifth \nCircuit’s reasoning applies equally to the original DACA policy.   \nWith respect to procedure, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the memorandum \nexpanding DACA and creating DAPA was not exempt from notice and comment as a \nstatement of policy because of how the original DACA policy had been implemented. \nTexas, 809 F.3d. at 171-78. The court found that, “[a]lthough the DAPA Memo \nfacially purports to confer discretion,” in fact it would operate as a binding statement \nof eligibility for deferred action because that is how the original DACA policy had \nbeen implemented. Id. at 171, 174 n.139.   \nWith respect to substance, the Fifth Circuit held that DAPA and expanded \nDACA were contrary to the INA because (1) “[i]n specific and detailed provisions,” \nthe INA already “confers eligibility for ‘discretionary relief,’ ” including “narrow \nclasses of aliens eligible for deferred action,” Texas, 809 F.3d at 179; (2) the INA’s \notherwise “broad grants of authority” could not reasonably be construed to assign to \nthe Secretary the authority to create additional categories of aliens of “vast ‘economic \nand political significance,’ ” id. at 182-83; (3) DAPA and expanded DACA were \ninconsistent with historical deferred-action policies because they neither were \n33 \n \n\nundertaken on a “country-specific basis . . . in response to war, civil unrest, or natural \ndisasters,” nor served as a “bridge[] from one legal status to another,” id. at 184; and \n(4) “Congress ha[d] repeatedly declined to enact the Development, Relief, and \nEducation for Alien Minors Act (‘DREAM Act’), features of which closely resemble \nDACA and DAPA,” id. at 185 (footnote omitted). Every one of those factors likewise \napplies to the original DACA policy. \nb. Plaintiffs posit various reasons they believe distinguish DACA from DAPA \nand expanded DACA, and fault the Acting Secretary for failing to expressly address \nthem. Pl. Br. 30. But plaintiffs provide no authority (because none exists) for the \nproposition that the APA required the Acting Secretary to provide the equivalent of a \nbench memo setting out the subsidiary legal arguments to be made by each side in the \ncourse of protracted litigation, with an accompanying evaluation of the likelihood of \nsuccess in various district courts, the courts of appeals, and the Supreme Court. \nIndeed, as this Court has explained, an agency “explanation need not be a ‘model of \nanalytic precision’” to satisfy the APA’s requirements. Downey v. U.S. Dep’t of Army, \n685 F. App’x 184, 190 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Inova Alexandria Hosp. v. Shalala, 244 \nF.3d 342, 350 (4th Cir. 2001)); see also Bowman, 419 U.S. at 286 (rationale need only be \nreasonably discernable). So long as the ultimate litigation judgment was reasonable, \nthe Acting Secretary’s decision is not arbitrary and capricious. All of plaintiffs’ \narguments to the contrary fail. \n34 \n \n\nFirst, plaintiffs urge that DAPA might have been more vulnerable to challenge \nbecause “unlike DAPA, DACA has no analogue in the INA.” Pl. Br. 32 (quoting \nNAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d. 239). The basis of the Fifth Circuit’s Texas decision was \nnot, however, the existence of a particular statutory pathway to lawful presence, but \nrather the “specific and intricate provisions” of the INA as a whole addressing \ndiscretionary relief (which, of course, no more include DACA recipients than DAPA \nrecipients). 809 F.3d at 186. Indeed, a pathway to lawful presence could not have been \ndecisive to the Fifth Circuit’s rationale, because, as that court itself noted, some DAPA \nrecipients (i.e., the parents of lawful permanent residents) had no such pathway to \ncitizenship, id. at 179-80, and neither did expanded DACA recipients (who differed \nfrom DACA recipients only with respect to age and length of residence). Given all \nthis, plaintiffs’ proposed distinction is entirely backward. If anything, the fact that \nCongress had legislated only for certain individuals similarly situated to DAPA \nrecipients—and not DACA recipients—would make DACA more inconsistent with \nthe INA. \nSecond, plaintiffs contend that the district erred in failing to consider whether a \ndefense like laches might apply to a suit seeking to enjoin DACA. Pl. Br. 32. But \nlaches requires a showing of prejudice, Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 155 \n(1967), and plaintiffs do not explain how the government (or, indeed, anyone else) \nwas prejudiced by Texas’s failure to bring suit earlier, which simply would have caused \nDACA to end sooner. \n35 \n \n\nThird, plaintiffs contend that the Acting Secretary failed to consider the \n“injunction prerequisites, such as how any plaintiff challenging DACA could claim \nimmediate or irreparable harm.” Pl. Br. 33. This argument ignores the fact that the \nFifth Circuit already affirmed the DAPA injunction, and, as explained, there are no \nmaterial differences between the two policies.  \nFourth, plaintiffs cannot undermine the reasonableness of the Acting Secretary’s \ndecision by arguing that the Attorney General erroneously stated that the Fifth Circuit \nhad found “constitutional” defects in DAPA and expanded DACA. Pl. Br. 31. The \nActing Secretary made her decision after “[t]aking into consideration” the Attorney \nGeneral’s letter and the Fifth Circuit’s ruling, but nothing in her memorandum \nsuggests that she misunderstood the nature of that ruling, which she herself described \nin purely statutory terms. JA.383. Moreover, even the Attorney General’s letter in its \nentirety should not be read to attribute “constitutional” holdings to the Texas courts, \nbut rather to invoke the “legal grounds” the courts adopted in support of his own \nview that DACA was “unconstitutional.” JA.379. In any event, any error in attributing \na finding of unconstitutionality to the Texas courts was plainly harmless because the \nAttorney General did not rescind DACA. Rather, the Acting Secretary did, and it is \nclear from her memorandum that her decision did not depend in any way on whether \nDACA was unconstitutional, rather than “merely” contrary to statute and likely to be \nenjoined regardless.   \n36 \n \n\nFifth, plaintiffs err in contending that Organized Village of Kake v. USDA, 795 \nF.3d 956 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc), held that reliance on litigation risk renders agency \naction arbitrary and capricious. Pl. Br. 31. Kake held no such thing. There, USDA \ninitially had determined not to exempt a particular forest from a rule prohibiting roads \nin certain areas of national parks, but then reversed course two years later on the \nidentical factual record. Kake, 795 F.3d at 959. As a tertiary rationale for its changed \nposition, USDA suggested that granting the exemption would “reduce[ ] the potential \nfor conflicts” in light of “litigation over the last two years” concerning its rule. Id. at \n970. The Ninth Circuit rejected that rationale because the “other lawsuits involved \nforests other than the [one exempted],” and thus it was “impossible to discern how \n[the] exemption . . . would affect them,” and USDA “[a]t most . . . [had] deliberately \ntraded one lawsuit for another.” Id. Kake is thus entirely inapposite. It involved the \nscope of a substantive rule rather than a purely discretionary enforcement policy, and \nit involved speculative litigation benefits rather than the significant litigation benefit of \nmooting a near-certain injunction. In short, the government’s position here is not that \nit may “trade[ ] one lawsuit for another,” but instead that it may choose an orderly \nwind-down of a purely discretionary non-enforcement policy rather than litigate to the \nbitter end in the face of adverse precedent.   \nc. Nor is there any basis to reject the Acting Secretary’s litigation-risk concern \nas a “post hoc rationalization.” The memorandum focuses from beginning to end \nprincipally on litigation concerns, not the legality of DACA per se. The memorandum \n37 \n \n\nrecounted in significant detail the litigation surrounding the DAPA and expanded \nDACA policies. JA.381-82. It noted that the agency’s prior June 2017 decision to \ndiscontinue DAPA and expanded DACA was made after “considering the \n[government’s] likelihood of success on the merits of th[at] ongoing litigation.” \nJA.382. It described the subsequent letter from Texas and other States to the Attorney \nGeneral notifying him of those States’ intention to amend the existing lawsuit to \nchallenge the original DACA policy. Id. It quoted the Attorney General’s qualified \nstatement that “it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar \nresults with respect to DACA.” Id. (emphasis added). And it concluded that, in light \nof the foregoing, and “[i]n the exercise of [her] authority in establishing national \nimmigration policies and priorities” under 6 U.S.C. § 202(5), the Acting Secretary had \ndecided merely that the DACA policy “should” be terminated and wound down in \n“an efficient and orderly fashion,” not that it “must” be.  \nThe Nielsen Memo reaffirms this understanding of the Texas litigation and the \nrisk it posed. It spells out why “[a]ny arguable distinctions between the DAPA and \nDACA policies” were not “sufficiently material” to resolve the agency’s doubts over \nDACA’s legality, and explains that, whether or not courts ultimately would uphold \nDACA, “[t]here are sound reasons for a law enforcement agency to avoid \ndiscretionary policies that are legally questionable.” Nielsen Memo 2. Indeed, \nregardless of whether the Duke Memo adequately explained this legal-doubt rationale, \n38 \n \n\nthe Nielsen Memo’s further explanation provides sufficient basis to affirm the district \ncourt’s rejection of plaintiffs’ challenge to DHS’s rescission of the DACA policy. \nd. In any event, Acting Secretary Duke’s decision is independently supported \nby her reasonable conclusion, informed by the Attorney General’s advice, that \nindefinitely continuing the DACA policy would itself have been unlawful. As detailed \nabove, the Fifth Circuit had already concluded that DAPA and expanded DACA were \nprocedurally and substantively invalid, in a decision that four Justices of the Supreme \nCourt voted to affirm. See supra pp.33-34. The Attorney General expressed his \nagreement with the conclusion reached by the Fifth Circuit in a decision that applies \nequally to the original DACA policy. See JA.379 (concluding that DACA was \n“effectuated . . . without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, \nafter Congress’ repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have \naccomplished a similar result”). The Acting Secretary’s decision to rescind the purely \ndiscretionary DACA non-enforcement policy on the basis of the Fifth Circuit’s \ndecision, the Supreme Court’s equally divided affirmance, and the Attorney General’s \nopinion was not the type of “clear error of judgment,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, that \nwould make it arbitrary and capricious under the APA. As the district court put it, \n“[H]ow could trying to avoid unlawful action possibly be arbitrary and capricious?” \nJA.1506. \n39 \n \n\n2.   Plaintiffs’ additional arguments that the rescission \nmemorandum was arbitrary and capricious are \nmeritless. \na. Plaintiffs are equally mistaken in arguing that the Acting Secretary’s decision \nwas arbitrary and capricious in failing to consider the reliance interests at stake. Pl. Br. \n27-29. Because of the nature of the decision to rescind DACA, reliance interests are \nnot a sufficiently “important aspect” of the question to require express consideration. \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. On its face, DACA confers no legitimate reliance interests. \nDACA made deferred action available for only two-year periods, which could “be \nterminated at any time” at the agency’s discretion. JA.1013. When he announced \nDACA in 2012, President Obama explained that it was a “temporary stopgap \nmeasure,” not a “permanent fix.” Remarks by the President on Immigration (June 15, 2012), \nhttps://go.usa.gov/xnZFY. And he urged Congress to act “because these kids \ndeserve to plan their lives in more than two-year increments.” Id. A purely \ndiscretionary policy that can be revoked at any time cannot create legally cognizable \nreliance interests—and certainly not beyond the stated duration (generally two years) \nof existing deferred-action grants, which the Acting Secretary left untouched. Nothing \nin the INA prevents the Secretary of Homeland Security from changing her “national \nimmigration enforcement policies and priorities.” 6 U.S.C. § 202(5). And any reliance \nwas even less justified, of course, to the extent that DACA was unlawful. \nAt a minimum, the asserted reliance interests plainly failed to overcome the \nsubstantial change in circumstances resulting from the Supreme Court’s affirmance of \n40 \n \n\nthe Fifth Circuit’s decision, which significantly increased the risk that DACA would \nbe enjoined nationwide and thus drastically reduced the degree to which DACA \nrecipients could rely on the continuation of what was already a purely discretionary \nnon-enforcement policy. Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117 (2016), \nupon which plaintiffs rely, is entirely inapposite. That case involved the Department \nof Labor’s interpretation of whether automotive service advisors were covered by a \nstatutory exemption from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. \nUnlike the policy at issue here, the one in Encino Motorcars concerned private parties’ \nsubstantive statutory rights, had been in place for thirty-three years, and was not \nsubject to a significant risk of imminent judicial invalidation. Id. at 2126-27. The \nrelevant industry stakeholders had therefore developed a strong and justified reliance \ninterest that necessitated consideration under the APA.  \nIn any event, the Acting Secretary’s decision suitably respected the interests of \nexisting DACA recipients. Based on her reasonable evaluation of the litigation risk \nposed by the imminent lawsuit against the DACA policy, the choice she faced was \nbetween a gradual, orderly, administrative wind-down of the policy, and the risk of an \nimmediate, disruptive, court-imposed one. Her decision to phase out the policy over a \ntwo-and-a-half-year period—permitting a period of additional renewals and \npermitting renewed and existing grants of deferred action to expire by their terms—\nwas, by far, the more humane choice. \nAgain, the Nielsen Memo underscores this conclusion. Although not required, \n41 \n \n\nSecretary Nielsen addressed whether any claimed reliance justified the continuation of \nthe DACA policy. As the Secretary explained, she is “keenly aware that DACA \nrecipients have availed themselves of the policy in continuing their presence in this \ncountry and pursuing their lives.” Nielsen Memo 3. “Nevertheless,” she concluded \nthat “in considering DHS enforcement policy” she “d[id] not believe that the asserted \nreliance interests outweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy” and the \nother discretionary enforcement policy considerations that she articulated, especially \nin light of DACA’s temporary nature. Id. Instead, the Secretary determined that \n“issues of reliance would best be considered by Congress, which can assess and weigh \na range of options.” Id. Ultimately, “[i]n [her] judgment, neither any individual’s \nreliance on the expected continuation of the DACA policy nor the sympathetic \ncircumstances of DACA recipients as a class overcomes the legal and institutional \nconcerns with sanctioning the continued presence of hundreds of thousands of aliens \nwho are illegally present in violation of the laws passed by Congress.” Id. All that said, \nshe also emphasized that any reliance concerns were further mitigated by the \nimportant fact that Acting Secretary Duke’s “rescission of the DACA policy does not \npreclude the exercise of deferred action in individual cases if circumstances warrant.” \nId. \nb. Plaintiffs similarly err by arguing that the rescission memorandum is arbitrary \nand capricious because it does not “cite[] any facts or changed circumstances that \nsupported the change.” Pl. Br. 28. The Acting Secretary’s memorandum makes clear \n42 \n \n\nthat DHS changed its position because the Texas injunction against DAPA and \nexpanded DACA was affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court; the Attorney \nGeneral has disavowed the prior position; and Texas and other States were \nthreatening to challenge DACA. That is more than sufficient to satisfy the APA’s \nrequirement to acknowledge and explain a changed position. FCC v. Fox, 556 U.S. \n502, 514-15 (2009). \nc. Plaintiffs also miss the mark in speculating that “animus” motivated the \nrescission of DACA. Pl. Br. 29-30. Plaintiffs point to no evidence in the \nadministrative record, or anywhere else, to support their contention that Acting \nSecretary Duke acted with animus in rescinding the DACA policy. See also infra Part \nII.C.1 (explaining the correctness of district court’s rejection of plaintiffs’ equal \nprotection claims).  \n3.   The administrative record provided an adequate basis \non which to sustain the Acting Secretary’s decision. \nAs a final matter, plaintiffs err in asserting that the district court could not \nuphold the Acting Secretary’s decision based on the record before it. The district \ncourt correctly relied on the administrative record submitted by the agency and held \nthat it supported the agency’s decision. \nIn agency review cases, “[t]he APA specifically contemplates judicial review on \nthe basis of the agency record.” Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 \n(1985). In so doing, “[t]he focal point for judicial review should be the administrative \n43 \n \n\nrecord already in existence, not some new record made initially in the reviewing \ncourt.” Id. at 743-44. Rather than permit wide-ranging discovery, “the task of the \nreviewing court is to apply the appropriate APA standard of review to the agency \ndecision based on the record the agency presents to the reviewing court.” Id.. If the \nagency’s action “is not sustainable on the administrative record made,” then the \nadministrative “decision must be vacated and the matter remanded to [the agency] for \nfurther consideration.” Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 143 (1973) (per curiam). \nPlaintiffs argue both that the district court should have ordered the \ngovernment to “complete” the record and that the district court should have granted \ndiscovery in order to consider extra-record materials. Pl. Br. 20-23. Both arguments \nare in error.  \nFirst, the record was not incomplete. In formal administrative proceedings, the \nAPA provides that the “exclusive record for decision” consists of “[t]he transcript of \ntestimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding.” \n5 U.S.C. § 556(e). The administrative record is composed “exclusive[ly]” of the \nmaterials affirmatively admitted by the agency in the course of the proceeding. \nMaterials that are not “filed in the proceeding” pursuant to the agency’s own \nprocedures, such as internal agency documents memorializing the agency’s own \ndeliberations, are categorically outside the scope of the administrative record under \nsection 556(e)—just like deliberative materials in the Judicial Branch such as draft \nopinions, bench memoranda, and communications among judges are not part of the \n44 \n \n\nrecord in a case in court. See also 28 U.S.C. § 2112; Fed. R. App. P. 16 & note \n(imposing the same rule). Although the APA does not contain a parallel provision \nprescribing the scope of the administrative record for informal agency actions (such as \nthe statement of agency policy here), there is no reason why materials should be \ntreated any differently than when they are created in a formal proceeding. Indeed, the \nAPA’s lack of instruction and the informal character of the action give the agency \nmore, rather than less, latitude in deciding what is material to its decision and thus \nbelongs in the record. See Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 549 (1978) (court may “not stray beyond the judicial \nprovince . . . to impose upon the agency its own notion of which procedures are \n‘best’”).  \nIn arguing that the record here is incomplete, plaintiffs wholly ignore the nature \nof the decision at issue. It is common sense that “[w]hat will constitute an adequate \nrecord for meaningful review may vary with the nature of the administrative action to \nbe reviewed.” United States v. Nova Scotia Food Prods. Corp., 568 F.2d 240, 249 (2d Cir. \n1977). Here the challenged agency act is the formulation of a policy concerning \nprosecutorial discretion; the agency record permitted review of that policy (assuming \nreview were available at all). Because that discretionary enforcement decision did not \nrequire the development of any particular evidentiary basis and turned instead on legal \nand policy assessment, there is no risk that the government could try to insulate its \ndecisions by “withhold[ing] evidence unfavorable to its case.” Pl. Br. 22.  \n45 \n \n\nPlaintiffs further allege that the administrative record is facially suspect because \nit did not include documents from subordinates. Pl. Br. 21-22. In making this \nargument, plaintiffs disregard the “presumption of regularity” that attaches to the \nagency’s action in designating the record. Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F.2d 735, 740 \n(10th Cir. 1993). In any event, plaintiffs recognize that the reason it may be \nappropriate to include materials from subordinates is that an agency decisionmaker \nmay have based her decision on facts and evidence gathered and provided by \nsubordinates. Pl. Br. 21. But the fact that materials in the possession of subordinates \nmay, in certain circumstances, be indirectly considered by a decisionmaker does not mean \nthat the absence of such materials renders an administrative record suspect and \nsubject to “completion” in every case. The administrative record in this case included \nall non-deliberative materials considered by the Acting Secretary in reaching her \ndecision. \nIn arguing (incorrectly) that the administrative record was incomplete because \nit “contained no materials explaining prior decisions to maintain the DACA program \nor the Government’s departure from its prior view that DACA was legal,” plaintiffs \nreveal their goal to uncover the deliberative processes of the agency in reaching its \nconclusion. Pl. Br. 22. But deliberative materials have no place in an administrative \nrecord. “[A]gency officials should be judged by what they decided, not for matters \nthey considered before making up their minds.” National Sec. Archive v. CIA, 752 F.3d \n460, 462 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Indeed, deliberative materials are not merely protected \n46 \n \n\nfrom disclosure—they do not form part of the administrative record at all. See San \nLuis Obispo Mothers for Peace v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 789 F.2d 26, 44-45 (D.C. \nCir. 1986) (plurality opinion) (explaining that “[j]udicial examination of [internal \nagency] transcripts would represent an extraordinary intrusion into the realm of the \nagency,” and that the petitioners must make a “‘strong showing of bad faith or \nimproper behavior’” before the court would be “warranted in examining the \ndeliberative proceedings of the agency”); Comprehensive Cmty. Dev. Corp. v. Sebelius, 890 \nF. Supp. 2d 305, 312-13 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (“[C]ourts have consistently recognized that, \nfor the purpose of judicial review of agency action, deliberative materials antecedent \nto the agency’s decision fall outside the administrative record.”). \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on Dopico v. Goldschmidt, 687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982), is \nmisplaced. Pl. Br. 20. Plaintiffs there alleged that a federal agency had improperly \nfunded projects. But the state plans that were being funded—“the very basis for \nfederal decision-making” and documents that were required by regulation—were not \nincluded in the administrative record, thus creating a “strong suggestion that the \nrecord before the Court was not complete.” Dopico, 687 F.2d at 654. The agency \naction at issue here does not involve consideration of documents submitted to the \ngovernment from the outside, and plaintiffs have not identified a comparable \ndocument that is missing from the record. Rather, this case involves the formulation \nof a policy with respect to enforcement discretion, and plaintiffs have not identified \n47 \n \n\nany non-deliberative materials outside the administrative record relevant to that legal \npolicy decision that the Acting Secretary necessarily considered. \nSecond, plaintiffs are not entitled to extra-record evidence. The general rule is \nthat discovery is not appropriate in an APA suit absent a “strong showing of bad faith \nor improper behavior.” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 \n(1971); Air Transp. Ass’n of Am., Inc. v. National Mediation Board, 663 F.3d 476, 487 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011). Here the Acting Secretary explained the reasons for her action in a \nmemorandum that was both publicly released and included in the administrative \nrecord. If the administrative record were insufficient for review (which it was not, see \nsupra pp. 44-47), the proper remedy would be for the district court to remand the case \nto the agency, not to order discovery. Florida Power, 470 U.S. at 744.  \nIn their attempt to evade the general rule forbidding discovery in APA cases, \nplaintiffs attempt to demonstrate that agency officials acted in bad faith. In making \nthis argument, plaintiffs rely on statements made by “Government officials” that \npurportedly demonstrate racial animus and the reversal of the government’s previous \nsupport of the DACA policy. Pl. Br. 22-23. But neither of these grounds could \nsupport a finding of bad faith. First, plaintiffs have made no showing whatsoever that \nActing Secretary Duke, the decisionmaker here, acted on the basis of animus. See infra \nPart II.C.1 (explaining that the district court correctly rejected plaintiffs’ equal \nprotection claims). Second, the administrative record adequately explains the \ngovernment’s change in position. See supra p. 43. \n48 \n \n\nB.  The district court correctly held that the rescission of DACA \ndid not require notice-and-comment rulemaking. \n1. The APA generally requires that agencies give notice of proposed rules to \nthe public and provide interested persons with an opportunity to comment on the \nproposal. 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)-(c). These requirements do not apply, however, to \n“general statements of policy.” Id. § 553(b)(3)(A). Accordingly, the rescission of the \nDACA policy did not require notice-and-comment rulemaking, as the district court \ncorrectly recognized (joining all the other courts to have considered the issue). See \nJA.1504-05. \nA general statement of policy “advise[s] the public prospectively of the manner \nin which the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.” Lincoln, 508 U.S. at \n197 (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General’s Manual on the Administrative \nProcedure Act 30 n.3 (1947)). “[L]ike a press release,” a general statement of policy \n“encourages public dissemination of the agency’s policies prior to their actual \napplication in particular situations,” such as by announcing “the course which the \nagency intends to follow in future adjudications.” Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Federal \nPower Comm’n, 506 F.2d 33, 38 (D.C. Cir. 1974). Significantly, however, policy \nstatements “are binding on neither the public nor the agency,” and the agency “retains \nthe discretion and the authority to change its position . . . in any specific case.” Syncor \nInt’l Corp. v. Shalala, 127 F.3d 90, 94 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citations omitted).  \nBy contrast, “a substantive or legislative rule, pursuant to properly delegated \n49 \n \n\nauthority, has the force of law, and creates new law or imposes new rights or duties.” \nJerri’s Ceramic Arts, Inc. v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 874 F.2d 205, 207 (4th Cir. \n1989); see also Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 (1979); Perez v. Mortgage Bankers \nAss’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1203 (2015) (“Rules issued through the notice-and-comment \nprocess are often referred to as ‘legislative rules’ because they have the ‘force and \neffect of law.’”).  \nThe rescission memo was issued as an “exercise of [the Secretary’s] authority in \nestablishing national immigration policies and priorities,” JA.383, and explains how \nthe agency intends to exercise its enforcement authority on a prospective basis. The \ndecision “does not . . . create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \nenforceable at law by any party,” JA.384, and does not affect anyone’s immigration \nstatus. As the district court explained, “[a]lthough a substantial paradigm shift, the \nDACA Rescission Memo neither curtails DHS’s discretion regarding individual \nimmigration reviews, nor does it prevent the agency from granting . . . deferred action \nstatus in the future.” JA.1505. It simply returns to the prior status quo, reflecting the \nbackground principle that deferred action is “an act of prosecutorial discretion” that \nmay be exercised “on an individualized case-by-case basis,” JA.381, and places “no \nlimitations” on the agency’s exercise of such “otherwise lawful enforcement . . . \nprerogatives,” JA.384. Nothing in the rescission memo evidences an intent to be \nbound.  \n2.  Plaintiffs contend that the DACA rescission is a substantive rule because it \n50 \n \n\nwithdrew officials’ discretion to grant deferred action under DACA. Pl. Br. 36-37. But \nthat cannot be the test, because a change in policy always withdraws discretion to act \nunder the repudiated policy. Setting aside that truism, the essence of plaintiffs’ \nargument is that they are less likely to receive deferred action based on a totality of the \ncircumstances inquiry than under the DACA policy’s guidelines. But a reduced \nlikelihood of relief does not transform a general statement of policy into a substantive \nrule. See Mada–Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1016 (9th Cir. 1987). \nThis Court’s decision in Chen Zhou Chai v. Carroll, 48 F.3d 1331, 1340-41 (4th \nCir. 1995), relied on by plaintiffs, only underscores the correctness of the district \ncourt’s holding. Contrary to plaintiffs’ contention, this Court in Chen Zhou Chai did \nnot hold that a general statement of policy is required to undergo notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking if it “substantively impacts” individuals. Pl. Br. 38. Indeed, the \nCourt held that an interim asylum policy was a general statement of policy, 48 F.3d at \n1341 (citing Mada–Luna, 813 F.2d at 1015), even though it undoubtedly substantively \nimpacted a number of individuals and the likelihood of their being granted asylum.  \nIf the Acting Secretary’s memorandum requiring a return to fully individualized \ndiscretion for deferred action is a substantive rule, then a fortiori the restriction on \ndiscretion imposed by DACA itself was a substantive rule, as the Fifth Circuit held. \nTexas, 809 F.3d at 171-78. And that provides an independent and sufficient basis to \nreject the plaintiffs’ claim. See Chen Zhou Chai, 48 F.3d at 1341 n.8. It would offend \nboth law and equity for this Court to set aside the DACA rescission for failure to \n51 \n \n\nfollow notice-and-comment procedures when that rationale necessarily implies that \nDACA itself was invalid for the same reason. Not only would such a ruling effectively \norder the maintenance of an illegally enacted legislative rule, but any relief it provides \nwould necessarily be short-lived, as such a decision would create binding precedent \nunder which opponents of DACA could immediately obtain an injunction against it.   \nPlaintiffs respond that, even where a substantive rule is invalid, agencies must \ngo through notice-and-comment before repealing it. Pl. Br. 34 n.4. But that argument \nrests on an inapposite case involving a substantive rule promulgated through notice-\nand-comment rulemaking and claimed to be defective for some other reason. See \nConsumer Energy Council of Am. v. FERC, 673 F.2d 425, 438 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (holding \nthat agency had not sufficiently evaluated the original rule). By contrast, it would make \nno sense to permit an agency official to violate notice-and-comment requirements in \nadopting a rule and then require her successors to go through the very hurdle of those \nrequirements to undo the prior invalid rule.  \nC.  The district court correctly held that the rescission of DACA \ndid not violate the Constitution. \n1.   The DACA rescission did not violate equal protection. \na. In AADC, the Supreme Court rejected an attempt by a group of aliens to \ndefend against removal by asserting that the Government was discriminating against \nthem based on their First Amendment activity. 525 U.S. at 488-92. The Court began \nwith the principle that “[e]ven in the criminal-law field, a selective prosecution claim is \n52 \n \n\na rara avis.” AADC, 525 U.S. at 489 (citing, inter alia, Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463-65). As \nthe Court reaffirmed, “[b]ecause such claims invade a special province of the \nExecutive—its prosecutorial discretion—we have emphasized that the standard for \nproving them is particularly demanding, requiring a criminal defendant to introduce \n‘clear evidence’ displacing the presumption that a prosecutor has acted lawfully.” Id.  \nThe Supreme Court in AADC then held that an even more restrictive rule than \nArmstrong’s clear-evidence standard was required when the claim of selective \nenforcement arises in the immigration context, because the concerns raised by such \nclaims are “greatly magnified.” 525 U.S. at 489-90. The Court observed that the \n“delay” associated with challenges to immigration enforcement decisions is more \nharmful because it “permit[s] and prolong[s] a continuing violation of United States \nlaw,” especially given that “[p]ostponing justifiable deportation (in the hope that the \nalien’s status will change . . . or simply with the object of extending the alien’s \nunlawful stay) is often the principal object of resistance to a deportation proceeding.” \nId. at 490. The Court also recognized that heightened separation-of-powers concerns \narise in this context because inquiring into the motives behind immigration \nenforcement entails “not merely the disclosure of normal domestic law enforcement \npriorities and techniques,” but also “the disclosure of foreign-policy objectives and [in \nsome cases, like AADC itself,] foreign-intelligence products and techniques.” Id. at \n490-91. Given all this, the Court dismissed “[t]he contention that a violation [of \nfederal law] must be allowed to continue because it has been improperly selected” as \n53 \n \n\n“not powerfully appealing.” Id. at 491.  \nAccordingly, the Court held that, “[a]s a general matter,” “an alien unlawfully in \nthis country has no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense \nagainst his deportation.” AADC, 525 U.S. at 488. Although the Court did “not rule \nout the possibility of a rare case in which the alleged basis of discrimination is so \noutrageous that the . . . considerations [against discriminatory-enforcement claims] \ncan be overcome,” it also did not decide “[w]hether or not there be such exceptions.” \nId. at 491.  \nb. Although it reached the right result, the district court disagreed with the \ngovernment on the framework under which to analyze plaintiffs’ equal protection \nclaims. The court stated that even though “DACA was promulgated under a theory of \nprosecutorial discretion, its rescission was not based on an exercise of that discretion.” \nJA.1508. As already explained, the DACA policy itself was as an act of prosecutorial \ndiscretion (whether or not the exercise of that discretion was lawful) and the \nrescission of that policy reset the agency’s enforcement policies to no longer provide a \ncategorical grant of deferred action to certain individuals. The rescission is thus \nprecisely the kind of selective enforcement decision to which AADC applies, because \nplaintiffs do not dispute the government’s authority to enforce the immigration laws \nagainst them but instead argue that the government has a discriminatory reason for \nenforcing those laws against them (by declining to renew their deferred action).    \n54 \n \n\nPlaintiffs contend (Br. 41) that the district court erred in applying the standard \nderived from Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972). It is, however, not clear that \nthe court applied Mandel in the sense asserted by plaintiffs. The district court \ndiscussed a number of cases for the proposition that courts should be wary of looking \nbehind facially neutral statutes in a variety of contexts, see JA.1509-10, and then came \nto the reasonable conclusion that plaintiffs here had made nothing like the showing \nmade in International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) v. Trump, 883 F.3d 233 (4th Cir.), \ncert. granted, and judgment vacated Trump v. IRAP, No. 17-1270, 2018 WL 1256938 (U.S. \n2018), a showing which the Supreme Court has now deemed insufficient. See Trump v. \nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2423 (2018).  \nIn Trump v. Hawaii the Supreme Court rejected statutory and constitutional \nchallenges to the President’s Proclamation imposing entry restrictions on certain \nnationals of eight foreign countries. In vacating a preliminary injunction against the \nProclamation, the Court reaffirmed that facially neutral immigration policies are \nsubject to only limited, deferential review. 138 S. Ct. at 2419-20. Although the \nproclamation under review in Trump v. Hawaii specifically concerned the admission of \naliens abroad, and thus was reviewed at most for rational basis, the Supreme Court \nrecognized that deferential review may apply “across different contexts and \nconstitutional claims.” Id. at 2419 (citing, among other cases, Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 \nF.3d 427, 433, 438-39 (2d. Cir. 2008), which concerned a special registration policy for \n55 \n \n\naliens from certain countries who were already in the country). The district court \ncorrectly applied such deferential review. \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on this Court’s decision in Sylvia Development Corp. v. Calvert \nCounty, 48 F.3d 810, 829 (4th Cir. 1995), fails to advance their claim. That case—\nwhich found no constitutional violation—involved a claim that a zoning law had been \napplied discriminatorily, not a claim of selective enforcement of immigration law. \nc. Analyzed under the proper framework, it is clear that the district court \nreached the correct result in rejecting plaintiffs’ equal protection claim. A claim that a \nfacially neutral policy like the DACA rescission was motivated by racial animus is \ninsufficient to overcome AADC ’s general bar on discriminatory-motive challenges to \nimmigration-enforcement decisions. See 525 U.S. at 491-92 (holding that even \nselectively targeting particular aliens on the basis of their First Amendment activity did \nnot rise to the level of the possible exception for “outrageous” discrimination). \nVirtually any immigration policy is likely to have a disparate impact on aliens of some \nethnicity, and thus would be vulnerable to a discriminatory-motive allegation from \naliens merely seeking to continue their unlawful presence in this country. Even if all \nsuch claims were ultimately proven baseless, the very act of adjudicating them leads \nprecisely to the delay and foreign policy concerns the Court described in AADC. See \nid. at 490. The district court correctly recognized that with respect to the facially \nneutral rescission of an immigration-enforcement discretion policy, plaintiffs’ claim of \nanimus—unsupported by anything in the administrative record—was insufficient to \n56 \n \n\nsupport an equal protection claim. JA.1508. As the court explained, “[t]he rescission \nof the DACA program merely fulfills the duty of the executive branch to faithfully \nenforce the laws passed by Congress.” JA.1511. \nAt a minimum, if racial discriminatory-motive claims are cognizable in the \nimmigration-enforcement context at all under AADC, they must meet the \n“particularly demanding” standard applicable in the criminal-enforcement context: \nplaintiffs must plausibly allege the existence of “clear evidence” of “outrageous” \ndiscrimination, thus “displacing the presumption that a [federal enforcement official] \nhas acted lawfully,” before the claim may proceed past the pleadings. AADC, 525 \nU.S. at 489, 491 (citing Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463-65). This standard is extremely \ndemanding, and plaintiffs have identified no case where a court has held it to be \nsatisfied. Indeed, several courts of appeals rejected equal protection challenges to a \nregistration requirement for male immigrants from certain (predominantly Muslim) \ncountries—which led to removal for those without lawful status—on the ground that \n“outrageous” discrimination had not been sufficiently demonstrated. See, e.g., \nKandamar v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir. 2006); Hadayat v. Gonzalez, 458 F.3d \n659, 664-65 (7th Cir 2006). \nPlaintiffs’ allegations supporting their equal protection claim (Pl. Br.40-41) \nconsist of statements made by government officials other than the Acting Secretary of \nHomeland Security, JA.46, 69-72, 76-79, 474; and certain events that plaintiffs \n57 \n \n\ncharacterize as “procedural irregularities.” None of these allegations is sufficient to \nestablish an equal protection claim. \nAs an initial matter, plaintiffs disregard the absence of any statement by the \nactual decisionmaker—Acting Secretary Duke—that could give rise to an inference of \nanimus. Acting Secretary Duke was the only government official with the legal \nauthority to rescind a DHS policy that DHS had operated for the previous five years, \n8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)—regardless of the (undisputed) involvement by the White House. \nFor plaintiffs to succeed, it is the Acting Secretary’s decision that must be infected by \ndiscriminatory animus, and the mere fact that her decision was preceded by certain \nstatements of the President cannot ipso facto taint her decision given her independent \noath and duty to obey the Constitution.  \nMoreover, even if the President’s statements are taken on their own terms, they \nare insufficient. First, nationality, as opposed to ethnicity, is not an invidious \nclassification for purposes of federal immigration law. Rajah, 544 F.3d at 435. And \nsecond, most of the statements did not refer to DACA, or indeed any official policy, \nsince they occurred on the campaign trail and preceded the President’s inauguration \nand oath of office. See JA.69-72. Indeed, as the district court recognized, the \n58 \n \n\nstatements directly related to DACA have largely been favorable to that policy. \nJA.1510-11.4  \nSimply put, the statements relied on by plaintiffs do not come close to plausibly \nalleging clear evidence of discriminatory motive. Indeed, it is utterly implausible that, \nin deciding whether to retain a policy that affirmatively sanctions the ongoing \nviolation of federal law by nearly 700,000 aliens without lawful status, it was a \nsignificant factor that those aliens are predominantly Latino, especially given the \nserious questions about whether the policy itself was illegal.  \nNor do plaintiffs advance their claim by invoking “procedural irregularities.” \nPlaintiffs entirely fail to draw any causal connection between these supposed \nirregularities (which were not irregular at all, see, e.g., infra pp. 66-67 (information-\nsharing policy)) and racial animus. See Pl. Br. 41.  \nd. Lacking sufficient evidence to carry their burden, Plaintiffs argue that the \ndistrict court could not properly grant summary judgment on their equal protection \nclaim without permitting them to take discovery. Pl. Br. 18-19.  \nFor the reasons explained above, plaintiffs failed to state a claim that the \nrescission of DACA violated equal protection, and the district court could therefore \n                                                 \n4 The statements by the Attorney General and a White House policy advisor \ncited in the complaint are also insufficient, see JA.72, as is plaintiffs’ reliance on a \ngeneral increase in immigration enforcement, JA.76-79. Statements and actions \nindicating an increase in immigration enforcement simply underscore that the \nmotivation of the agency action challenged here was not racial or ethnic animus, but \nrather the resetting of agency enforcement priorities.  \n59 \n \n\nproperly grant the government’s motion to dismiss. No discovery was warranted for \nthis reason alone, and this Court may affirm on that basis. \nEven if this Court were to evaluate the appropriateness of granting summary \njudgment on this claim, the district court correctly recognized that plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claims could be decided on the basis of the administrative record.  \nJA.1508. The APA expressly provides that agency action may be set aside as contrary \nto “constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \nAccordingly, the APA’s “comprehensive remedial scheme,” Western Radio Servs. Co. v. \nUnited States Forest Serv., 578 F.3d 1116, 1122-23 (9th Cir. 2009), for a “person \n‘adversely affected’ . . . by agency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 702, including its provisions \ngoverning record review, applies to constitutional claims for non-monetary relief \nagainst federal agencies and officials. See also Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.S. 537, 551-554 \n(2007) (describing the APA as the remedial scheme for vindicating complaints against \n“unfavorable agency actions”). \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988) (cited at Pl. \nBr. 44), is not to the contrary. The Court’s reference in that case to “any discovery \nprocess which may be instituted” after remand is hardly a holding that the APA’s \nrequirement of record review has no application to constitutional claims. Id. at 604. \nPlaintiffs further err in relying on this Court’s statement in Ray Communications, \nInc. v. Clear Channel Communications, Inc., 673 F.3d 294, 299 (4th Cir. 2012), that “where \nthe movant fails to fulfill its initial burden of providing admissible evidence of the \n60 \n \n\nmaterial facts entitling it to summary judgment, summary judgment must be denied, \neven if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented, for the non-movant is not \nrequired to rebut an insufficient showing.” Ray Communications did not involve an APA \nclaim, and here the government met its burden by submitting the administrative \nrecord.  \nEven assuming some discovery might be permitted for constitutional claims \nunder the APA, the district court did not err in granting judgment for the government \nwithout discovery in this case. The Supreme Court has addressed when discovery is \nappropriate in selective enforcement contexts. Indeed, the whole point of Armstrong’s \nholding that there must be “clear evidence” of discrimination before prosecutorial \ndiscretion can be challenged, supra p. 53, was to limit discovery in selective prosecution \nclaims. 517 U.S. at 463-65; see also AADC, 525 U.S. at 489-90 (relying on Armstrong in \nholding that aliens defending against removal by alleging selective enforcement need \nnot be given access to district court fact-finding procedures). As explained, plaintiffs \nhave not put forth any evidence that DACA was motivated by animus, let alone the \nkind of “clear evidence” of discriminatory intent required under Armstrong and \nAADC. The inappropriateness of discovery in this case is further underscored by the \nbreadth of plaintiffs’ discovery requests, see, e.g., JA.1117-22 (asking for all documents \nand communications within and between DHS, DOJ, “the executive branch,” and “the \nTrump administration” on a variety of topics). Instead of “clear evidence” of \ndiscriminatory intent, plaintiffs asked the district court to permit them to go on a \n61 \n \n\nhighly intrusive fishing expedition of precisely the sort that Armstrong and AADC \nforbid. The district court quite properly denied the request. \nAs a final matter, the district court did not, as plaintiffs contend, fail to view the \nfacts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs’ claim. See Pl. Br. 46. In so arguing, \nplaintiffs confuse factual findings with their legal relevance. For example, plaintiffs set \nforth as “disputed” the fact that 93% of DACA recipients were Latino. Pl. Br. 17. The \ngovernment disputed the legal relevance of that fact, to be sure, but the government \nhas never disputed that DACA recipients were predominantly Latino (whatever the \nprecise figure). The same is true of the various statements made by the President that \nplaintiffs cited in their complaint. See Pl. Br. 46. The district court did not proceed as \nthough the statements were not made, but rather recognized that the statements were \nlegally insufficient to support plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  \n2.   The DACA rescission did not violate due process. \nThe district court also correctly rejected plaintiffs’ due process challenges to the \nrescission of DACA. JA.1512-14.  \na. The DACA guidance could not have been clearer that it did not create any \n“substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.” JA.131. As then-\nSecretary Napolitano explained, “[o]nly the Congress, acting through its legislative \nauthority, can confer these rights.” Id. In the face of this clear language, a subjective \n“belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how sincerely or reasonably \nheld, does not create a property right.” Gerhart v. Lake County, 637 F.3d 1013, 1020-21 \n62 \n \n\n(9th Cir. 2011) (citing Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458, 465 (1981)). \nPlaintiffs try in vain to identify any express commitment on the part of the \ngovernment to indefinitely maintain the DACA policy. See Pl. Br. 50, 51. But as the \ndistrict court correctly held, DACA simply created no protected liberty or property \ninterest. JA.1512-13. That alone disposes of plaintiffs’ due process claims. \nb. Even assuming a protected interest, the procedural due process claim would \nstill fail. Plaintiffs’ theory is not that individual DACA requests were adjudicated \nincorrectly (for example, due to factual error) and that notice and a hearing could \ncorrect those errors. Instead, plaintiffs claim that DHS cannot alter the DACA policy, \neven on a prospective basis, without providing individualized notice and hearings to \nnearly 800,000 recipients. As the district court recognized, however, JA.1512, where a \ngovernment policy “applies to more than a few people, it is impracticable that \neveryone should have a direct voice in its adoption,” and thus due process does not \nrequire individualized pre-deprivation notice. Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of \nEqualization, 239 U.S. 441, 445 (1915); see also Yassini v. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356, 1359, \n1363 (9th Cir. 1980) (per curiam) (rejecting procedural due process challenge to \nrescission of deferred action policy).  \nIn response to this clear precedent, plaintiffs argue that their complaint \ncontained “specific allegations by specific individuals of the benefits they had lost.” Pl. \nBr. 51, 52. But due process obviously does not prohibit the rescission of a general \npolicy on a categorical rather than individualized basis, and thus notice and an \n63 \n \n\nopportunity to be heard on these specific allegations is neither necessary nor \nappropriate. Plaintiffs further miss the mark in relying on Kapps v. Wing, 404 F.3d 105, \n118 (2d Cir. 2005) (cited at Pl. Br. 53), to argue that individualized process may be \nrequired even for large numbers of individuals. The fact that notice and a hearing for \nindividual decisions, where otherwise required, cannot be dispensed with merely \nbecause of the number of individuals affected does not mean that notice and a \nhearing are required for the rescission of generally applicable policies. \nPlaintiffs’ argument that Bi-Metallic is limited to legislative actions, Pl. Br. 52, \nfinds no support in law or logic. Although the Supreme Court there noted that \nindividuals subject to a general policy may have recourse to political processes, the \ndecision did not require a showing of any particular process. Any time a rule of \nconduct applies generally, an individual’s “rights are protected in the only way that \nthey can be in a complex society, by their power, immediate or remote, over those \nwho make the rule.” Bi-Metallic, 239 U.S. at 445. The ongoing Congressional and \npublic debates over DACA vividly illustrate this principle.  \nc. Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim likewise fails. As the district court \ncorrectly held, “[t]he rescission of a policy relating to prosecutorial discretion does not \nshock the conscience.” JA.1514. “[T]he only thing that has changed,” the court \nobserved “is that deferred status will expire . . . in the absence of action by Congress.” \nId. “There is nothing surprising or unfair about policies, laws, or enforcement thereof \nchanging with an election cycle.” Id. Because plaintiffs’ only attempt to demonstrate \n64 \n \n\nconscience-shocking behavior hinges on their allegations of animus, see Pl. Br. 54 \n(citing cases not involving substantive due process), their substantive due process \nchallenge collapses into their flawed equal protection claim, supra Part II.C.1.  \nd. Although the district court did not separately address plaintiffs’ due process \nclaims with respect to the DACA information-sharing policy, see Pl. Br. 54-55, those \nclaims are no more successful than plaintiffs’ claims challenging the rescission of \nDACA. The DACA information-sharing policy created no protected property or \nliberty interest, as it was always expressly subject to change, see infra pp. 66. And \nplaintiffs have failed to show that any alleged change to the information-sharing \npolicy shocks the conscience or that individualized process was due. The information-\nsharing policy has not changed, see infra pp. 67, and has, in any event, always been \nsubject to a number of exceptions. \nIII.  The District Court Erred in Enjoining the Government from \nChanging the Information-Sharing Policy. \nNo other court has accepted the theory advanced by plaintiffs and adopted by \nthe district court that the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevents the government \nfrom modifying an information-sharing policy that has been expressly subject to \nmodification since the inception of DACA. This Court should not either, and at a \nminimum it should vacate the nationwide injunction insofar as it extends beyond the \nplaintiffs in this case. \n65 \n \n\nA.  The district court erred in holding that the government was \nsubject to equitable estoppel. \n1. When the DACA policy was implemented in 2012, DHS published a \n“frequently asked questions” webpage that included guidance regarding DHS’s policy \non the sharing of information provided in connection with DACA requests. The \nguidance stated that information would be “protected from disclosure to ICE and \n[Customs and Border Protection (CBP)] for the purpose of immigration enforcement \nproceedings,” subject to exceptions where the criteria for issuance of a Notice to \nAppear are satisfied (for example, where national security, public safety, or significant \ncriminal activity interests are implicated), and subject to the caveat that the policy \n“may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time.” DHS DACA FAQ 19; see \nalso id. (explaining that information may be used for certain purposes other than \nremoval); USCIS, Revised Guidance for the Referral of Cases and Issuance of Notices to Appear \n(NTAs) (Nov. 7, 2011), https://go.usa.gov/xncPK (last visited July 30, 2018).  \nNothing in the Acting Secretary’s memorandum changes that approach—in \nfact, the memorandum makes no reference to information sharing at all, a point the \ndistrict court recognized, JA.1505 n.24. And DHS made clear in guidance issued after \nthe rescission that “[t]his information-sharing policy has not changed in any way since it \nwas first announced, including as a result of the Sept. 5, 2017 memo starting a wind-\ndown of the DACA policy.” USCIS, Guidance on Rejected DACA Requests Q5 (Dec. 27, \n2017), www.uscis.gov/daca2017/guidance-rejected-daca2017 (emphasis added) (last \n66 \n \n\nvisited July 30, 2018). In fact, even the district court did not conclude that the policy \nhad changed; rather it faulted the government for being “unable to provide any \nassurance the Government would not make changes” in the future. JA.1516. \n2.a. The district court erred in holding that plaintiffs were entitled to a \npermanent injunction on equitable estoppel grounds. The Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly indicated that estoppel against the government “may only be justified, if \never, in the presence of affirmative misconduct by government agents.” Dawkins v. \nWitt, 318 F.3d 606, 611 (4th Cir. 2003) (collecting cases). But the district court did not \nfind any affirmative misconduct, or even that the policy had changed in any way. \nInstead, the court speculated that “it is possible that the government, having induced \nthese immigrants to share personal information under the guise of immigration \nprotections, could now use that same information to track and remove them,” which \n“potentially would be ‘affirmative misconduct.’ ” JA.1516.  \nThe district court’s speculation fails to satisfy the requirement of “affirmative \nmisconduct” for two independent reasons. First, and most obviously, the policy has \nnot changed, and the court did not find that it had. Unquantified “potential[]” for future \naction cannot establish the current “presence” of actual misconduct. JA.1516; see \nDawkins, 318 F.3d at 611. Indeed, given the lack of a finding concerning any current or \neven imminent change of policy, this claim fails to satisfy the requirements of both \nstanding, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 563 (1992), and irreparable harm, \neBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). \n67 \n \n\nSecond, the government did not “promise” that information obtained through \nDACA requests would never, under any circumstances, be used for immigration \nenforcement or that the policy would not change. Rather, DHS explained that \ninformation would be “protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of \nimmigration enforcement proceedings,” subject to exceptions where the criteria for \nissuance of a Notice to Appear are satisfied. JA.1011. And this was subject to the \ncaveat that the policy “may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without \nnotice,” id., a fact the district court acknowledged yet failed to address in its analysis, \nJA.1532-33. Thus, even if the government changed its policy at a future date, DHS’s \nstatements regarding the prior policy would not be converted into \n“misrepresentation[s]” for purposes of equitable estoppel, Chawla v. Transamerica \nOccidental Life Ins. Co., 440 F.3d 639, 646 (4th Cir. 2006), let alone “affirmative \nmisconduct,” Dawkins, 318 F.3d at 611-12. \nb. As a more fundamental matter, the district court erred because an equitable \nestoppel claim is not available against the government, even assuming the typical \nelements of such a claim might be demonstrated.  \nOnly Congress can create a “private right[] of action to enforce federal law.” \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286 (2001). Yet Congress has created no applicable \nright of action for a freestanding equitable estoppel cause of action against the \ngovernment. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that the arguments in favor of \nbarring equitable estoppel against the government are “substantial,” while declining to \n68 \n \n\nrule on the issue. Heckler v. Community Health Servs., 467 U.S. 51, 60 (1984); OPM v. \nRichmond, 496 U.S. 414, 423 (1990). Courts of appeals have similarly recognized the \nstrong reasons for reticence in applying estoppel against the government, particularly \nin its exercise of policymaking discretion. See United States v. Owens, 54 F.3d 271, 275 \n(6th Cir. 1995) (“[T]he government should not be unduly hindered from changing its \nposition if that shift is the result of a change in public policy.”). And, at most, \napplication of the doctrine of estoppel could be “justified only where ‘it does not \ninterfere with underlying government policies.’ ” Emery Mining Corp. v. Secretary of Labor, \n744 F.2d 1411, 1416 (10th Cir. 1984). The district court’s injunction here does just \nthat—it constrains DHS’s enforcement and policymaking discretion with respect to \nwhether and how to use information it possesses in connection with immigration \nproceedings. The injunction should be vacated. \nB.   The district court erred in granting injunctive relief that was \nnationwide in scope. \nThe district court’s injunction must be vacated for an additional reason: in \ngranting nationwide relief, the district court violated the requirements of Article III \nand equity. The injunction prohibits the changing of an information policy as it \napplies to hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who are not parties before the \ncourt and who do not need to be covered to provide plaintiffs here with complete \nrelief. \n69 \n \n\n1. To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff “must allege personal injury fairly \ntraceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by \nthe requested relief.” DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342 (2006). \n“[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross,” and the plaintiff must establish standing \n“separately for each form of relief sought.” Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. \nCt. 1645, 1650 (2017).  \nThe Supreme Court recently reaffirmed these principles in Gill v. Whitford, 138 \nS. Ct. 1916 (2018), concluding that a set of voters had not demonstrated standing to \nchallenge alleged statewide partisan gerrymandering of Wisconsin legislative districts.  \nThe plaintiffs alleged that voters who shared their political views were disadvantaged \nby the way district lines were drawn statewide, and that they were therefore entitled to \nchallenge the entire state map. Id. at 1924-25. But the Court concluded that a \n“plaintiff’s remedy must be ‘limited to the inadequacy that produced [his] injury in \nfact,’ ” and that a voter’s “harm [from] the dilution of [his] vote[] . . . is district \nspecific” because it “results from the boundaries of the particular district in which he \nresides.” Id. at 1930 (quoting Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996)). Accordingly, \nthe Court held that “the remedy that is proper and sufficient lies in the revision of the \nboundaries of the individual’s own district,” not the broader remedy of “restructuring \nall of the State’s legislative districts.” Id. at 1930-31. And the Court “caution[ed]” that, \non remand, any “remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff ’s particular injury.” \n70 \n \n\nId. at 1934; accord id. at 1933 (“The Court’s constitutionally prescribed role is to \nvindicate the individual rights of the people appearing before it.”). Other courts have \nrecognized the same. See, e.g., McKenzie v. City of Chicago, 118 F.3d 552, 555 & n.* (7th \nCir. 1997).  \n2. Even apart from Article III’s requirements, fundamental principles of equity \nsupport the same rule. The Supreme Court has cautioned that “injunctive relief \nshould be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete \nrelief to the plaintiffs” before the court. Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979); \nsee also Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994); Samuel L. Bray, \nMultiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 428-37 \n(2017) (explaining the lack of historical basis for nationwide injunctions). \nThis Court applied that teaching to vacate a nationwide injunction in Virginia \nSociety for Human Life, Inc. v. FEC, 263 F.3d 379 (4th Cir. 2001). There, the district \ncourt had issued a nationwide injunction preventing the Federal Election Commission \nfrom enforcing a challenged regulation “against any party anywhere in the United \nStates.” Id. at 393. This Court explained that an injunction covering the plaintiff alone \nwould “adequately protec[t] it,” and that preventing the Commission from enforcing \nthe regulation “against other parties in other circuits does not provide any additional \nrelief ” to the prevailing plaintiff. Id. The Court also rejected the argument that a \nnationwide injunction was necessary to set aside unlawful agency action, noting that \n71 \n \n\n“[n]othing in the language of the APA” requires the exercise of “such far-reaching \npower.” Id. at 394. \nMoreover, nationwide injunctions “take a toll on the federal court system—\npreventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging \nforum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for \nthe Executive Branch.” Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2425 (Thomas, J., concurring); see also \nVirginia Soc’y for Life, 263 F.3d at 393. They also create an inequitable “one-way-\nratchet” under which any prevailing plaintiff obtains relief on behalf of all others, but \na victory by the government would not preclude other potential plaintiffs from \n“run[ning] off to the 93 other districts for more bites at the apple.” City of Chicago v. \nSessions, 888 F.3d 272, 298 (7th Cir. 2018) (Manion, J., dissenting in part), reh’g en banc \ngranted, Order of June 4, 2018 (No. 17-05270) (vacating panel judgment “insofar as it \nsustained the district court’s decision to extend preliminary relief nationwide”); cf. \nUnited States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 158-62 (1984) (holding that non-parties to an \nadverse decision against the federal government may not invoke the decision to \npreclude the government from continuing to defend the issue in subsequent \nlitigation). Here, there are multiple cases across the country challenging the rescission \nof the DACA policy and the alleged change to the information-sharing policy. Each \ncourt should adjudicate the claims of the plaintiffs before it, and the plaintiffs in other \ncases should not benefit from the government’s loss in this case on the information-\n72 \n \n\nsharing policy, just as they are not bound by the government’s win here on the DACA \nrescission. \nCONCLUSION \nThe district court’s permanent injunction should be vacated, and its grant of \nsummary judgment to the government should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted, \n  CHAD A.

American democracy rests on fundamental principles of fairness and equality.  \nOur system of justice does not punish people for things that they did not do or that they could not \ncontrol.  And we expect our government to abide by its commitments.  In its rescission of the \n  3 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 4 of 61\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program, and its draconian immigration \nenforcement efforts, the federal government has abandoned these fundamental principles. \n2.  In the three decades leading up to 2012, hundreds of thousands of children \nimmigrated to the United States.  Many of them crossed the border of the United States without \nauthorization, fleeing violence and desperate circumstances in their home countries, but with no \nroute to lawful entry under our nation’s immigration laws.  Others came through lawful means, \nbut, for a variety of reasons, later lost their authorization to remain in the United States and did \nnot return to their countries of origin.  For many of these children, it was not their choice to come \nto the United States.  All of them have grown up in this country, gone to school, and contributed \nto the fundamental fabric of American society.  Lacking legal status, these young people grew up \nin the shadows of American life, facing the fear of deportation, family separation, and hardship.  \nThey were stigmatized, through no fault of their own.  \n3.   Many of these children dreamed of a better life – where they could live freely and \nstudy, work, and defend their country – a life without fear of their government.   \n4.  On June 15, 2012, at the direction of President Obama, Janet Napolitano, then-\nSecretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, helped this dream come closer to \nreality.  On that date, she established the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \nprogram.  \n5.  Under DACA, individuals who came to the United States as children and meet \nspecific criteria may request “deferred action” for two years, subject to renewal.  “Deferred \naction” is a long-standing mechanism under immigration laws allowing the government to \nforbear from removal action against an individual for a designated period.  In addition to DACA, \n  4 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 5 of 61\nfederal law designates other classes as eligible for deferred action.2   Individuals granted deferred \naction are eligible for certain rights and privileges associated with lawful presence status in the \nUnited States.   \n6.  In establishing DACA, the federal government recognized that \"certain young \npeople . . . were brought to this country as children and know only this country as home\" and that \nimmigration laws are not \"designed to remove productive young people to countries where they \nmay not have lived or even speak the language.”  The government also recognized, among other \nthings, that children brought to this country had no intent to violate the law and that, with limited \nresources, there were more appropriate priorities for immigration enforcement.  \n7.  DACA provides some sense of stability to individuals who came to the United \nStates as children and have grown up to become productive members of American society.  \nCollectively, this group of young people are often referred to as “Dreamers.”   \n8.  To apply for DACA, Dreamers had to (1) submit extensive documentation to the \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) establishing that they meet the eligibility \ncriteria; (2) pay a $495 fee; and (3) submit to a rigorous DHS background check, including \nsubmission of biometric data.   \n9.  When DACA was first implemented, many eligible Dreamers were reluctant to \napply because of concern that they would be required to disclose information that could help \nfacilitate their removal from the United States and place their family members at risk.  This \nconcern was understandable -- the average Dreamer entered the United States at the age of six, \nand many had lived their whole lives in fear of deportation.  \n                                                 \n2 See generally U.S. Dep’t of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, The Department of Homeland Security’s Authority to \nPrioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present in the United States and to Defer Removal of Others, Op. \nO.L.C.  (November 19, 2014).   \n  5 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 6 of 61\n10.  In an effort to encourage reluctant people to apply for DACA, the government \nlaunched an aggressive outreach campaign urging Dreamers to apply.  These efforts included \nwell organized efforts to provide DACA application materials to organizations that serve the \nimmigrant community,3 enlisting the White House to promote the stories of individual DACA \nrecipient “Champions of Change,”4 and targeted outreach to select populations whose \nparticipation in the program lagged.5   DHS officials routinely engaged with immigration service \nproviders and advocates, soliciting their assistance in expanding participation in DACA and \ndealing with issues in its implementation.  USCIS officials attended DACA clinics hosted by \nnon-profits and immigration service providers across the country and held numerous engagement \nsessions in person, by phone and via webinar6 to encourage participation in the program.  In \nconjunction with this campaign, USCIS made five promises to Dreamers. \n11.   First, USCIS repeatedly promised Dreamers that information they provided about \nthemselves as part of the DACA application process would be \"protected\" from use for \nimmigration enforcement purposes.7    \n12.   Second, USCIS promised Dreamers that \"information related to your family \nmembers or guardians that is contained in your request will not be referred to ICE [U.S. \n                                                 \n3 See generally A.

Third, USCIS promised employers of Dreamers that, except in limited \ncircumstances, if they provided their employees \"with information regarding [their] employment \nto support a request for consideration of DACA . . . . This information will not be shared with \nICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes.\"9 \n14.  Fourth, by establishing internal procedures, USCIS promised that once Dreamers \nreceived DACA, they would not be terminated from the program unless they posed an \n“Egregious Public Safety” issue.  In addition, USCIS promised to provide them with a “Notice of \nIntent to Terminate” which “thoroughly explain[ed]” the grounds for the termination.”10  \n15.  Fifth, USCIS promised  Dreamers that they could seek renewal of their status at \nthe expiration of their two-year DACA term.  USCIS represented that Dreamers “may be \nconsidered for renewal of DACA” if they meet the guidelines for consideration and other criteria \nwhich “must be met for consideration of DACA renewal.”11  \n16.   These repeated and unequivocal assurances were critical to the success of the \nDACA initiative.  Relying on these representations, more than 800,000 Dreamers brooked the \npotential risks of deportation and removal and applied for DACA.  Employers, too, relied on \nthese representations to assist their employees in applying for DACA, despite the potential risk \nof liability for the employers.  \n                                                 \n8 See USCIS, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Frequently Asked Questions (“DACA FAQs”) (April 25, \n2017) Q20  \n9 DACA FAQs Q76. \n10 See  DHS, National Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Apr. 4, 2013) \n(“SOP”). \n11   DACA FAQs Q51 \n  7 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 8 of 61\n17.  DACA has been a tremendous success, allowing the Dreamers -- -- such as \nPlaintiffs Angel Aguiluz, Luis Aguilar, Estefany Rodriguez, Annabelle Martinez Herra, Heymi \nElvir Maldonado, Maricruz Abarca, Nathaly Uribe Robledo, Eliseo Mages, Jeus Eusebio Perez, \nJosue Aguiluz, Missael Garcia, Jose Aguiluz, and Brenda Moreno Martinez --  to live, study, and \nwork in the United States, and to become stable and even more productive members of their \ncommunities, without fear that they could be arrested and placed in deportation proceedings at \nany moment. \n18.  All of this changed on September 5, 2017, when Attorney General Jefferson \nSessions (“Sessions”) announced the rescission of DACA.  Several hours after the \nannouncement, Acting Secretary of DHS Elaine Duke (\"Duke\") issued a memorandum \nrescinding DACA (the “Rescission Memorandum”).12 At Acting Secretary Duke’s direction, \nUSCIS immediately stopped accepting new applications under DACA, ended DACA recipients’ \neligibility to apply for permission to leave the United States and reenter with advance parole, and \ndeclared that DHS will consider DACA renewal applications only for Dreamers whose DACA \nexpires between September 5, 2017 and March 5, 2018 if, even then, only if these Dreamers \napply for renewal by October 5, 2017. \n19.  The consequence of the administration’s decision  to rescind DACA is that \napproximately 800,000 Dreamers who have received benefits and received protection against \ndeportation under the program in reliance on the government’s assurances will ultimately lose \ntheir benefits and protection, and will be exposed to deportation when their DACA \nauthorizations expire and they cannot seek renewal.    In addition, hundreds of thousands of other \n                                                 \n12 Memorandum from Elaine C. Duke, Acting Sec'y of Homeland Security to James W. McCament, Acting Dir., \nUSCIS, et al., Rescission of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with \nRespect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\" (Sept. 5, 2017). \n  8 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 9 of 61\npotential beneficiaries, many of whom were preparing to submit their requests for DACA, are \nnow unable to benefit from the program. \n20.  Specifically, as a direct result of the decision to eliminate DACA, among other \nthings, Dreamers (i) will lose their work authorization, requiring their employers to terminate \ntheir employment, (ii) have lost the ability to travel internationally, and (iii) will lose their right \nto qualify under applicable state law for in-state admissions preferences and tuition.  As a result, \nmany Dreamers will leave college because their inability to work will make higher education \nunaffordable or because they no longer qualify for in-state tuition.  Still others will leave college \nbecause they may no longer be able to achieve career objectives commensurate with their skills \nand qualifications.  \n21.  Furthermore, all of the Dreamers are at risk of having their application \ninformation shared with immigration enforcement authorities.  Welching on its prior assurances, \non September 5, USCIS released guidance suggesting that it may share Dreamer applicant \ninformation with ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  The guidance substantively \nchanges USCIS’s policy in a manner that places Dreamers at heightened risk of deportation \nbased on information previously disclosed to USCIS in good faith and in reliance on the \npromises outlined above.  The Rescission Memorandum does not provide any assurances that \nimmigration enforcement agents will not be provided such information to find and remove those \nwho applied for and/or received benefits or protection under DACA.   \n22.  Indeed, on September 27, 2017, Acting Secretary Duke shockingly testified \nbefore Congress that she had never seen any guidance telling Dreamers their information would  \nnot be used for immigration enforcement.   \n  9 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 10 of 61\n23.  The Defendants’ decision to terminate DACA is a double-cross.  It is not only \nunjustified, but offensive to the basic values of this Nation.  It is arbitrary, capricious, and \ncontrary to law, and therefore it cannot stand.   \n24.  The decision to rescind DACA is illegal because it is predicated on discriminatory \nanimus against persons of Mexican or Central American origin.  Of the 800,000 DACA \nrecipients, more than 90 percent of DACA recipients are of Mexican or Central American \norigin.13  \n25.  The evidence of discriminatory animus leading to the rescission is palpable.  The \nrescission is the culmination of a series of well-publicized statements made by President Trump \nstarting as early as February 2015 revealing an anti-Mexican or anti-Central American immigrant \nanimus and threatening Dreamers.   \n  Starting on February 24, 2015, President Trump made a series of defamatory \nand incendiary claims about immigrants from Mexico and Central America.  \nFor example, on that date, then-candidate Trump characterized immigrants \nfrom Mexico as “criminals.”   \n  During his announcement speech on June 16, 2015, Trump referred to \nimmigrants from Mexico as “rapists.”   \n  In October 2016, Trump referred to immigrants from Mexico and Latin \nAmerica as “bad hombres.”   \n  On August 22, 2017, President Trump described unauthorized immigrants as \n“animals’ who bring “the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, [and] the crisis of \nsmuggling and trafficking.” \n26.  The Trump Administration's rescission of DACA is unlawful on a number of \ngrounds.  First, the decision to rescind DACA unconstitutionally violates the due process \n                                                 \n13 See USCIS, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Fiscal Years 2012-2017 (data as of March \n31)  (June 8, 2017), \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20\nData/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca_performancedata_fy2017_qtr2.pdf. \n  10 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 11 of 61\nguarantee of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution by reneging on DHS's prior \nassurances regarding DACA (including the pledges not to use of information contained in \nDACA applications).  Second, the decision also violates the equal protection guarantee contained \nin the Fifth Amendment by treating Dreamers differently than other similarly situated recipients \nof deferred action, obstructing them, without justification, from earning a living and furthering \ntheir education.  Third, the rescission violates the Administrative Procedure Act in numerous \naspects.  To begin with, the rescission is contrary to various provisions of law, including the \nPrivacy Act and the e-Government Act.  It is also arbitrary and capricious because it (1) is \nunsupported by a reasoned analysis that addresses the prior conclusion of the government that \nthe program was legal and constitutional or explains how the justification for the rescission can \nbe reconciled with the six-month wind down period; (2) is based on discriminatory animus; and \n(3) contains deadlines that are arbitrary and treat similarly situated individuals differently based \non caprice.  Finally, the rescission was adopted without a legally sufficient justification and \nwithout notice or the opportunity to comment.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27.   This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201(a).  \n28.   Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 139l(b)(2) and \n1391(e)(I). A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this \ndistrict; Plaintiff CASA and many of the Individual Plaintiffs reside in this district.  This is a \ncivil action in which Defendants are agencies of the United States or officers of such an agency. \nPARTIES \n29.  CASA de Maryland, Inc. (CASA) is a non-profit membership organization \nheadquartered in Langley Park, Maryland, with offices in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.  \n  11 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 12 of 61\nFounded in 1979, CASA is the largest membership-based immigrant rights organization in the \nmid-Atlantic region, with more than 90,000 members.  CASA’s mission is to create a more just \nsociety by building power and improving the quality of life in low-income immigrant \ncommunities.  In furtherance of this mission, CASA offers a wide variety of social, health, job \ntraining, employment, and legal services to immigrant communities in Maryland, as well as the \ngreater Washington DC metropolitan area, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.  CASA has provided \nassistance on nearly 4,000 DACA and DACA renewal applications since 2012, and counts more \nthan 2,300 DACA beneficiaries as members.  Since the September 5, 2017 DACA rescission, \nCASA has had to reallocate significant resources to counsel and assist Dreamers who are eligible \nto renew their DACA in the arbitrarily narrow window the administration announced.  CASA’s \nsmall legal team, composed of three attorneys and five support staff, have suspended the \nmajority of their work to assist DACA renewal applicants, depriving community members of \naccess to other vital legal services.  In addition, members of CASA’s community organizing \ndepartment, as well as other CASA departments, have reprioritized their work to engage with the \ncommunity and educate them about the rescission of DACA and connect eligible individuals to \napplication assistance services.  The rescission of DACA has had a significant negative impact \non CASA’s mission, as DACA members and their families who live in our communities face an \nuncertain future that may include loss of employment and potential permanent separation from \ntheir families.    \n30.

On June 15, 2012, Secretary Napolitano issued a memorandum establishing the \nDACA program (the “2012 DACA Memorandum”). Under DACA, individuals who came to the \nUnited States as children and meet specific criteria may request deferred action for a period of \ntwo years, subject to renewal.  \n68.  Deferred action is a long-standing mechanism under the immigration laws \npursuant to which the government forbears from taking removal action (i.e., starting the process \nof expelling an immigrant from the United States) against an individual for a designated period.  \nIn addition to DACA, federal law and the federal government by executive action have declared \nvarious other classes of individuals as eligible for deferred action.  For example:  \n  In 1990, the Immigration and Naturalization Service implemented a “Family \nFairness” program to protect approximately 1.5 million spouses and children \n  22 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 23 of 61\nof immigrants who had been granted legal status under the 1986 immigration \nlaw.14   \n  Certain aliens who have suffered abuse by U.S. Citizens or LPR spouses or \nparents may self-petition under the Violence Against Women Act for deferred \naction status.  8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii)–(iv), (vii)). \n  Certain aliens who are victims of human trafficking and their family members \nare eligible for deferred action status.  8 U.S.C.§ 1101(a)(15)(T)(i). \n  Certain aliens who are victims of certain crimes and their family members are \neligible for deferred action status.  8 U.S.C.§ 1101(a)(15)(U)(i). \n  In 2009, DHS implemented a deferred action program for certain widows and \nwidowers of U.S. Citizens.15 \n  The U.S. government has, in the wake of major natural disasters, allowed \nforeign students who can no longer satisfy the requirements to maintain their \nstudent visas to be eligible for deferred action.16     \n  The U.S. government has, from time to time, allowed aliens of particular \nnationalities to be eligible for deferred action.17     \n69.  Under the 2012 DACA Memorandum, applicants had to demonstrate that they (i) \ncame to the United States under the age of sixteen; (ii) had continuously resided in the United \nStates since June 15, 2007; (iii) were currently in school, had graduated from high school, had \nobtained a general education development certificate, or were an honorably discharged veteran; \n(iv) had not been convicted of a felony,  significant misdemeanor, three or more misdemeanor \noffenses, or otherwise posed a threat to national security or public safety; and (v) were not over \nthirty years old as of June 15, 2012. \n                                                 \n14 See Memorandum for Regional Commissioners, INS, from Gene McNary, Commissioner, INS, Re: Family \nFairness: Guidelines for Voluntary Departure under 8 CFR 242.5 for the Ineligible Spouses and Children of \nLegalized Aliens (Feb. 2, 1990) \n15 Memorandum for Field Leadership, USCIS, from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, USCIS, Re: \nGuidance Regarding Surviving Spouses of Deceased U.S. Citizens and Their Children at 1 (Sept. 4, 2009) \n16 See, e.g., USCIS, Interim Relief for Certain Foreign Academic Students Adversely Affected by Hurricane \nKatrina: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) at 1 (Nov. 25, 2005) \n17 See, e.g., Exec.

USCIS promised Dreamers that their applications would be considered under a \nfair process.  Specifically, USCIS assured Dreamers that “[a]ll individuals who believe they meet \nthe guidelines . . . may affirmatively request consideration of DACA from USCIS through this \nprocess,” and after USCIS receives the applicant’s forms, evidence, supporting documents and \napplication fee, “USCIS will review them for completeness.” USCIS further affirmatively \nrepresented to Dreamers that if it determines that the request is complete, USCIS will send the \napplicant notices of receipt and for needed appointments, and then review the applications “on an \nindividual, case-by-case basis” and notify applicants of its determination in writing.18   \nBACKGROUND:  APPLICANTS WERE ADVISED THAT PARTICIPATION \nIN DACA ENTITLED THEM TO TANGIBLE BENEFITS  \n71.  In publicizing DACA, the government emphasized that deferred action status \nmade Dreamers eligible for numerous benefits and privileges.   \n72.  For example, USCIS promised Dreamers if their DACA applications were \ngranted, they “may obtain employment authorization” to work for up to two years.19  This \ncommitment was authorized under federal law; under 8 CFR 274a(a)(11) & (c)(14), deferred \naction recipients (including, but not limited to, Dreamers) may apply for work authorization to be \nlegally employed.  This representation was important to Plaintiffs Josue Aguilaz, Jose Eusebio \nPerez, and Missael Garcia who were working in low skill, minimum wage jobs; since receiving \nDACA, Augilaz has been able to obtain employment as an accountant, Garcia has been able to \nobtain employment as a school mentor, and Perez has been able to obtain employment as a \nResearch Assistant at Johns Hopkins University. \n                                                 \n18 DACA FAQs Q7; USCIS, F5 General Information ― How do I request consideration of DACA? at 2 (June \n2014). \n19 DACA FAQs Q4. \n  24 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 25 of 61\n73.  USCIS promised Dreamers that if their DACA applications were granted, they \nwould be eligible to travel outside the United States for educational, employment, or \nhumanitarian purposes.20  In particular, USCIS told Dreamers that they would be eligible to \napply for “advance parole,” parole,” which permits recipients to leave the country temporarily \nwithout risk that they will be denied readmission.  This commitment opened the door to allow \ninternational travel for Dreamers.  For example, DACA recipients were allowed to briefly depart \nthe U.S. and legally return under certain circumstances, such as to visit an ailing relative, attend \nfuneral services for a family member, seek medical treatment, or further educational or \nemployment purposes. This commitment was authorized under federal law; under 8 USC \n212(d)(5)(A), deferred action recipients (including Dreamers) may apply for “parole” to travel \ninternationally without risk that they will be barred from re-entering the United States.21  \nPlaintiff Jose Aguilaz and Luis Aguilar successfully obtained advance parole to visit family \nmembers in Honduras and Mexico respectively.  \n74.  USCIS promised Dreamers that if their DACA applications were granted, they \ncould attend educational institutions.22  In particular, USCIS told Dreamers they could attend \n“elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school, alternative program,” “education, \nliteracy, or career training program (including vocational training)” as well as an “education \nprogram assisting students in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized \nequivalent under state law.”  This commitment was authorized under federal law; under 42 USC \n2000c-6, educational institutions may not discriminate on the basis of national origin, and under \n42 USC 2000d, 28 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(2), and 34 C.F.R. § 100.3(b)(2), individuals may not be \n                                                 \n20 DACA FAQs Q57. \n21 DACA FAQs Q57.    \n22 DACA FAQs 32-34. \n  25 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 26 of 61\ndiscriminated against in the receipt of federal financial educational assistance on the basis of \ntheir national origin.  See also Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982).  Plaintiff Josue Aguilaz \ncredits DACA (which allowed him to take his certification to become a Registered Nurse) with \nhis decision to return to school to obtain an advance nursing degree.  Similarly, Plaintiffs Eliseo \nMages, Brenda Moreno Martinez, Nathaly Uribe Robledo, and Angel Aguilaz all credit DACA \nwith allowing them to attend college. \n75.  In publicizing DACA, the federal government emphasized that Dreamers would \npay into and be eligible for certain public benefits such as Social Security and disability.23    This \ncommitment was authorized under federal law; unlike other undocumented immigrants, under 8 \nUSC 1611(b)(2) & (b)(3) and 8 U.S.C. 1621(d), deferred action recipients are eligible for public \nbenefits, such as Social Security, Medicare, and disability benefits. \n76.  USCIS promised Dreamers that if their DACA application was granted, they \nwould be “authorized by DHS to be present in the United States,” “considered by DHS to be \nlawfully present,” and that their “period of stay is authorized by DHS.” 24  This commitment was \nauthorized under federal law; under 8 CFR 109.1, deferred action recipients are granted \nsuspended accrual of unlawful presence for purposes of admission. \n77.  In addition to the benefits directly provided by the federal government, these \nbenefits enabled Dreamers to secure equal access to other benefits and opportunities on which \nAmericans depend, including opening bank accounts, obtaining credit cards, starting businesses, \npurchasing homes and cars, and conducting other aspects of daily life that are often unavailable \nfor undocumented immigrants.  \n                                                 \n23 Karen Tumulty, Illegal Immigrants could receive Social Security, Medicare under Obama Action, Wash.

DHS recognized that DACA created rights that the government could not take \naway without affording due process.  Under the DACA \"National Standard Operating Procedures \n(SOP): Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“SOP”), established by USCIS and DHS, \nindividuals admitted into DACA are not to be terminated from the program absent an “Egregious \nPublic Safety” issue.25  In this event, the procedures require USCIS to provide a “Notice of Intent \nto Terminate” which “thoroughly explain[s]” the grounds for the termination.”  Other materials \ninformed Dreamers that only \" fraud or misrepresentation\" in the application process or \n\"[s]ubsequent criminal activity\" would be grounds for revocation of DACA.26  The SOP further \ndirected that the recipients of such notice should receive 33 days to “file a brief or statement \ncontesting the grounds cited in the Notice of Intent to Terminate” prior to termination of \nparticipation in DACA.27 \nBACKGROUND: THE PRIVACY COMMITMENT TO DREAMERS \n79.  The DACA application form required applicants to provide a wealth of personal, \nsensitive information, including the applicant's lack of lawful immigration status, address, Social \nSecurity number, and the name and location of his or her school.  DACA applicants were also \nrequired to provide DHS with a detailed history of their criminal arrests and convictions, \nincluding all misdemeanors, however minor, and to affirmatively declare whether they had ever \nbeen placed in removal proceedings in the past.  The application process also required that all \nDACA applicants undergo biographic and biometric background checks, which included \nfingerprinting, before USCIS considered their DACA requests.  \n                                                 \n25 SOP at 132-34. \n26 USCIS Approval Notice, Form 1-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. \n27 SOP at 132. \n  27 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 28 of 61\n80.  To induce participation in DACA, USCIS made numerous commitments to \nDreamers regarding their rights under the program.   \n81.  Foremost among these commitments was the promise that DACA applicants’ \ninformation would not be shared with the DHS components responsible for immigration \nenforcement – ICE and CBP.  In providing this information, DACA applicants relied on \nDefendants' promises about the terms of the program and the manner in which their information \nwould be protected.  These promises were documented, among other places:  \n  In the “Instructions” to Form I-821D -- the DACA application which every \nDACA applicant had to complete -- stated that “information provided in this \nrequest is protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of \nimmigration enforcement proceedings unless the individual meets the \nguidelines for the issuance of a Notice to Appear (NTA) or a referral to ICE \nunder the guidelines set forth in USCIS’s Notice to Appear Guidance.”28   \n  In the Frequently Asked Questions for DACA applicants, USCIS \naffirmatively represented to Dreamers that, except in limited circumstances \n(i.e., the individual meets the guidelines for a Notice to Appear), their \ninformation would not be shared with immigration enforcement authorities.  \nSee, e.g., FAQ Q19 (\"[i]nformation provided in [a DACA request] is protected \nfrom disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement \nproceedings”). \n  In the Frequently Asked Questions for DACA applicants, USCIS \naffirmatively represented to Dreamers that their information would not be \nshared with immigration enforcement authorities even if their request for \nDACA was denied.  See, e.g., FAQ Q26 (\"[i]f you have submitted a request \nfor consideration of DACA and USCIS decides not to defer your case ... your \ncase will not be referred to ICE for purposes of removal proceedings”). \n  In other materials as well, USCIS promised Dreamers that it would not share \ntheir information with immigration enforcement authorities.  For example, one \nslide in a Powerpoint presentation staed: “Protecting Your Information: We \nwill not share any information about you with ICE or U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection (CBP) for the purpose of immigration enforcement \nproceedings unless you meet the criteria for: the issuance of an NTA; or a \nreferral to ICE under the criteria set forth in our NTA guidance.”29  \n                                                 \n28 Instructions to Form I-821D. \n29 June 2014 PPT at 30. \n  28 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 29 of 61\n  The general guidance on the USCIS website reassured applicants that their \napplications would be submitted to a “lockbox” and would not be shared with \nimmigration enforcement:  “If your case does not involve a criminal offense, \nfraud, or a threat to national security or public safety, we will not refer your \ncase to ICE for purposes of removal proceedings except where DHS \ndetermines there are exceptional circumstances.” 30 \n  Other guidance also stated “What protections are in place to protect the \ninformation I share in my request from being used for immigration \nenforcement practices?  The information you provide in your request is \nprotected from disclosure to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the purpose of \nimmigration enforcement proceedings unless you meet the criteria for \nissuance of a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria explained \nin USCIS’ Notice to Appear . . . Individuals whose cases are deferred under \nthe consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals process will not be \nreferred to ICE.”31 \n  USCIS also promised employers of Dreamers that any information they \nprovided verifying employment would not be used for enforcement purposes \nagainst them or their company absent “evidence of egregious violations of \ncriminal statutes or widespread abuses.”32 \n82.  In their receipt, use, maintenance, and protection of personally identifiable \ninformation, DHS and USCIS, among other federal government agencies, are required to comply \nwith the Privacy Act of 1974 (“Privacy Act”).  5 U.S.C. § 552a.  Among other things, the \nPrivacy Act prohibits an agency’s disclosure of information about “individuals” to another \nagency or person unless a specific exemption applies.33  The Privacy Act also provides that a \n                                                 \n30 Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, “Filing Process” & “If USCIS does not grant DACA in \nyour case.” \n31  USCIS, F5 General Information ― How do I request consideration of DACA? at 3 (June 2014). \n32 DACA FAQs 76. \n33 See 5 U.S.C. § 552a (b) (“No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any \nmeans of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the \nprior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains”).     \n  29 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 30 of 61\ngovernment agency may not maintain information in its records that is not necessary to \naccomplish a purpose required to be accomplished by statute or by executive decree.34 \n83.  Under the Privacy Act, USCIS and DHS stored DACA applicant information in \none of four pre-existing systems of records -- the “Alien File, Index, and National Tracking \nSystem of Records,” the “Background Check Service,” the “Biometric Storage System,” and the \n“Benefits Information System.”35   \n84.  DHS and USCIS, like other federal government agencies, also are required to \ncomply with the e-Government Act of 2002.  Pub. L. 107-347 (2002).  Among other things, the \ne-Government Act requires a government agency to prepare a Privacy Impact Assessment that \naddresses “with whom the information will be shared.”  Id. § 208(b). \n  Under the e-Government Act, on August 15, 2012, USCIS and DHS \nconducted a Privacy Impact Assessment (“PIA-45”) for DACA.36   \n  PIA-45 repeatedly refers to DACA applicants as “individuals” (a key statutory \nterm under the Privacy Act) and states that “prior to the submission of any \ninformation, individuals are presented with a Privacy Act Statement, as \nrequired by Section (e)(3) of the Privacy Act.”  PIA-45 4.1.   \n  PIA-45 instructs that “any [personally identifiable information] that is \ncollected, used, maintained, and/or disseminated . . . are to be treated as \nSystem of Records subject to the Privacy Act regardless of whether the \ninformation pertains to a U.S. citizen, Legal Permanent Resident, visitor, or \nalien.”  PIA-45 7.1. \n  PIA-45 expressly declares that “[i]nformation provided in this request is \nprotected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration \nenforcement proceedings unless the individual meets the guidelines for the \nissuance of a Notice to Appear (NTA) or a referral to ICE under the guidelines \nset forth in USCIS’s Notice to Appear Guidance.”  PIA-45 3.3. \n                                                 \n34 See 5 U.S.C. § 552a (c)(1) (an agency “shall maintain in its records only such information about an individual as \nis relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or by \nexecutive order of the President”) (emphasis added). \n35  DHS/USCIS/PIA-045, Privacy Impact Assessment for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals at 9 ((Aug. 15, \n2012). \n36 Id.   \n  30 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 31 of 61\n  When USCIS updated the DACA Application Form (I-821D) to request \nadditional information, DHS issued an updated PIA to provide notice of the \nnew information requested.  That updated form similarly said that information \nprovided is “protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of \nimmigration enforcement proceedings.”37 \n85.  PIA-45’s treatment of DACA applicant data as covered by the Privacy Act was \nconsistent with DHS policy.  Well before the establishment of DACA, DHS set forth its policy to \ntreat all persons’ personally identifiable information, regardless of citizenship, the same under \nthe Privacy Act.38 \n86.  Although the Privacy Act prohibition on disclosure includes exceptions that allow \nan agency to disclose information pursuant to a “routine use” or to “another agency . . . for a civil \nor criminal law enforcement activity,” 5 USC 552a(b)(3&7), USCIS and DHS expressly waived \nthose exceptions insofar as they relate to immigration enforcement activities regarding DACA \napplicants.   \n87.  As detailed above in paragraph 84, USCIS and DHS waived the disclosure \nexceptions by repeatedly and consistently promising Dreamers in agency publications that their \ndata would not be shared with immigration enforcement authorities.   \n88.  The waiver of the exemptions from the Privacy Act’s prohibition on disclosure of \npersonally identifiable information in a system of records is further documented in the USCIS \nSOP for DACA, which sets forth the standards that DHS applies to DACA applications with \nnearly 150 pages of specific instructions for granting or denying deferred action.  The SOP \nemphasizes that the “additional measures . . . necessary to ensure that enforcement resources are \n                                                 \n37 DHS/USCIS/PIA-045(a), Privacy Impact Assessment Update for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals at 2, \n6 (April 2014) (“There is no change in the DHS external sharing and disclosure of information as described in the \nDHS/USCIS/PIA-045 DACA PIA.”)  \n38 Guidance Memorandum from Hugo Teufel III, Chief Privacy Officer, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, \n2007-01: DHS Privacy Policy Regarding Collection, Use, Retention, and Dissemination of Information on Non-U.S. \nPersons (Jan. 7, 2009) \n  31 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 32 of 61\nnot expended on these low priority cases,” and includes provisions regarding the “lockbox” to \nwhich applicants were directed to submit data, as well as “Revised Guidance for the Referral of \nCases and Issuance of Notices to Appear” that restricted the referral of cases to ICE. 39 \n89.  In addition, USCIS and DHS senior leadership confirmed the waiver.  For \nexample, in December 2016, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson sent a letter to \nmembers of Congress regarding the need to protect DACA-related information, acknowledging \nthat there were, at the time, 750,000 DACA recipients who had \"relied on the U.S. government's \nrepresentations\" about prohibitions on the use of such information for immigration enforcement \npurposes. Johnson unequivocally stated: \"We believe these representations made by the U.S. \ngovernment, upon which DACA applicants most assuredly relied, must continue to be \nhonored.\" (emphasis added). \n90.  The government's representations that information provided by a DACA applicant \nwould not be used against him or her for later immigration enforcement proceedings are \nunequivocal and atypical.  For example, the federal government does not make the same \nrepresentations for individuals with similar statuses, such as Temporary Protected Status.40  \n91.  Because every DACA applicant was advised that applicant information would not \nbe shared with ICE or CBP, and because the government explicitly acknowledged, Dreamers \nrelied on this commitment in submitting their data, the Due Process Clause and the doctrine of \nequitable estoppel preclude Defendants from taking actions breaching their commitments. \n                                                 \n39 SOP at 18, 20, 23-24 & App. B. \n40 See, e.g., USCIS, Temporary Protected Status, https://www.uscis.go v/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status \n(last updated May 24, 2017). \n  32 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 33 of 61\nTHE ROAD TO RESCISSION \n92.  DACA fundamentally changed the lives of Dreamers. By no longer having to hide \nin the shadows, they obtained employment, sought higher education, pursued career paths, and \nbecame fully contributing members of society who paid taxes and participated in civic life.  As \nSecretary Johnson stated in December 2016, DACA has enabled hundreds of thousands of young \npeople “to enroll in colleges and universities, complete their education, start businesses that help \nimprove our economy, and give back to our communities as teachers, medical professionals, \nengineers, and entrepreneurs— all on the books.”41  \n93.  As the Secretary of Homeland Security recognized less than 10 months ago, the \nUnited States “continue[s] to benefit . . . from the contributions of those young people who have \ncome forward and want nothing more than to contribute to our country and our shared future .”42  \n94.  Ending DACA, whose participants are mostly of Mexican and Central American \norigin, fulfills President’s Trump, Attorney General Sessions, and their subordinates oft-stated \ndesire to punish and disparage people with Mexican and/or Central American  roots or Latinos \ngenerally, as a group, without acknowledging their individual personalities, attributes or \ncircumstances, a failure to differentiate that is the essence of prejudice.  For example: \n  In announcing his presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump compared \nMexican immigrants to rapists, stating: “When Mexico sends its people, \nthey’re not sending their best. . . . They’re sending people that have lots of \nproblems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing \ndrugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. . . . It’s coming from more \nthan Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America.”43  \n  During the first Republican presidential debate, then-candidate Trump again \nrestated his distaste for immigrants from Mexico: “The Mexican government . \n                                                 \n41  Letter to Judy Chu, Representative, U.S. House of Representatives, from Jeh Johnson, Secretary, U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“Letter from Sec’y Johnson”) (Dec. 30, 2016)  \n42  Letter from Sec’y Johnson \n43 Transcript of Donald Trump’s Presidential Bid Announcement, Washington Post (June 16, 2015). \n  33 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 34 of 61\n. . send the bad ones over because they don’t want to pay for them. They don’t \nwant to take care of them.”44 \n  In May 2016, then-candidate Trump referred to anti-Trump protestors who \ncarried the Mexican flag on Twitter as “criminals” and “thugs.”45  \n  On August 21, 2015, two men urinated on a sleeping Latino man and then \nbeat him with a metal pole. At the police station, they stated “Donald Trump \nwas right; all these illegals need to be deported.” When asked about the \nincident, then-candidate Trump failed to condemn the men, instead stating that \nthey were “passionate.” Specifically, Trump stated, “[i]t would be a shame . . . \nI will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love \nthis country and they want this country to be great again. They are \npassionate.”46 \n  In June 2016, then-candidate Trump stated that Judge Gonzalo Curiel could \nnot be fair in presiding over a lawsuit because he was Mexican-American and \nTrump was “very, very strong on the border” and Judge Curiel was \n“Hispanic” and “pro-Mexican.”47  . . . Now, he is Hispanic, I believe. He is a \nvery hostile judge to me.” Ex.  \n  In August 2016, during a speech in Phoenix, then-candidate Trump said: “We \nagree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and \npeople across our border. . . most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers \nwith less education . . . these illegal workers draw much more out from the \nsystem than they can ever possibly pay back. And they're hurting a lot of our \npeople that cannot get jobs under any circumstances. . . We will immediately \nterminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he \ndefied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five \nmillion illegal immigrants, five million. . . . [N]o one will be immune or \nexempt from enforcement.  . . . Anyone who has entered the United States \nillegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to \nhave a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.”48 \n                                                 \n44 Andrew O’Reilly, At GOP debate, Trump says ‘stupid’ U.S. leaders are being duped by Mexico, Fox News (Aug. \n6, 2015). \n45; Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump), TWITTER (May 25, 2016 6:39AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/735465352436408320?lang=en (“The protestors in New Mexico were \nthugs who were flying the Mexican Flag);  Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump), TWITTER (June 4, 2016 6:04AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/739080401747120128?lang=en (“Many of the thugs that attacked \npeaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals”).  \n46 Adrian Walker, ‘Passionate’ Trump fans behind homeless man’s beating?, The Boston Globe (Aug. 21, 2015). \n47Transcript of Face the Nation, CBS News, June 5, 2016; Jose A.

They’re tougher \nthan any people you’ve ever met. They’re killing and raping everybody out \nthere. They’re illegal. And they are finished.”50  \n  On January 26, 2017, referring to immigrants, President Trump said “\"We are \ngoing to get the bad ones out . . . The criminals and the drug deals, and gangs \nand gang members and cartel leaders. The day is over when they can stay in \nour country and wreak havoc.\"51 \n  On January 27, 2017, newly-inaugurated President Trump and Mexico’s \nPresident Peña Nieto discussed President Trump’s proposal for a border wall \nover the phone. During that transcribed conversation, President Trump once \nagain referred to Mexicans as “tough hombres.”52  \n  In February 2017, President Trump said \"What has been allowed to come into \nour country, when you see gang violence that you've read about like never \nbefore, and all of the things — much of that is people that are here illegally .  . \n. They're rough and they're tough . . . So we're getting them out.”53 \n  On June 21, 2017, President Trump – implied that thousands of immigrants \nare members of the Central American gang MS-13.  He said “These are true \nanimals. WE are moving them out of the country by the thousands, by the \nthousands.”54 \n  Similarly, on June 28, 2017, President Trump said “They are bad people. And \nwe’ve gotten many of them out already. . .  We’re actually liberating towns, if \nyou can believe that we have to do that in the United States of America.  But \nwe’re doing it, and we’re doing it fast.”55On August 16, 2017  at President \nTrump’s direction, DHS terminated the Central American Minors Program, \n                                                 \n49 Katie Zezima, Trump on immigration: There are ‘bad hombres’ in the United States, The Washington Post (Aug. \n30, 2017). \n50 Michael Scherer, Person of the Year 2016, TIME Magazine (Dec. 2016). \n51 Shannon Dooling, Mayor Walsh Vows to Keep Boston a Safe Place For Immigrants Following Trump’s Orders , \nWBUR News (Jan. 26, 2017). \n52 Greg Miller et. al., Full Transcripts of Trump’s Calls with Mexico and Australia,  Wash.

President Trump’s discriminatory statements about people with Mexican and \nCentral American roots show the root motivation for the DACA rescission. \n96.  Other senior officials of the administration have echoed this animus.  For \nexample: \n  On March 27, 2017, Attorney General Sessions cited two crimes committed by \nLatino immigrants and said “the American people are justifiably angry . . . DUIs, \nassaults, burglaries, drug crimes, rapes, crimes against children and murders.  \nCountless Americans would be alive today-- and countless loved ones would not \nbe grieving today  . . . The President has rightly said that this disregard for the \nlaw must end. . . . ”58  \n  On July 28, 2017, White House Senior Policy Advisor Stephen Miller said: “a \nmessage of tolerance toward illegal immigration is the number-one boon to \nsmugglers and traffickers. And we’ve seen the results of that over the last eight \nyears in terms of massive human rights violations associated with the Central \nAmerican migrant surge. . . that permissive approach, we’ve seen the results, and \nthe results have been deadly and horrific. . .  We also need to get expedited \nremoval for illegal immigrants from Central America.”59 \nTHE DACA RESCISSION \n97.  On September 5, 2017-- more than five years after first making numerous \npromises to induce individuals to participate in DACA-- DHS abruptly rescinded DACA and \n                                                 \n56 Mica Rosenberg, U.S. ends program for Central American minors fleeing violence, Reuters (Aug.16, 2017). \n57 Julie Hirschfield Davis and Maggie Haberman, Trump Pardons Joe Arpaio, Who Became Face of Crackdown on \nIllegal Immigration, N.Y.

Defendant Sessions announced the rescission of DACA.  On the same \nday, Defendant Duke issued a memorandum formally rescinding DACA.  The Rescission \nMemorandum created a new legal regime governing DACA recipients, which imposed rights and \nobligations and is legally binding.   \n98.  Under the Rescission Memorandum, the government will immediately cease \naccepting applications under DACA.  Dreamers who were too young to be eligible, such as \nPlaintiff A.M, can no longer apply for DACA. \n99.  Under the Rescission Memorandum, the federal government will issue renewals \nonly for recipients whose DACA permits expire between September 5, 2017 and March 5, 2018, \nand only if they apply for renewal by October 5, 2017.  DACA recipients who let their status \nlapse in the weeks leading up to September 5, 2017, such as Plaintiffs Heymi Elvir Maldonado, \nMaricruz Abarca, Annabelle Martinez Herra, and Missael Garcia, can no longer renew their \nDACA. \n100.  Under the Rescission Memorandum, the federal government will not issue \nrenewals for recipients whose permits expire after March 5, 2018.  Individuals whose DACA \nexpires after that date, such as Plaintiff J.M.O. (whose DACA expires on March 6, 2018), Angel \nAguiluz, Luis Aguilar, Eliseo Mages, and Brenda Moreno Martinez, will not be allowed to renew \ntheir DACA. \n101.   Under the Rescission Memorandum, the government will not approve any new or \npending applications for advanced parole for DACA recipients, meaning that Dreamers are \nprevented from traveling abroad and returning to the United States, even where there are \ncompelling humanitarian or other reasons for such travel.   Dreamers can no longer travel outside \nthe United States during their benefit period, including for those who have already submitted \n  37 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 38 of 61\nrequests for advance parole in reliance on DHS's assurances that advance parole was available to \nthem.  Those who have pending applications are therefore denied advance parole without any \nassessment under the criteria DHS has used for advance parole requests.  Many Dreamers, such \nas Plaintiffs Brenda Moreno Martinez and Nathaly Uribe Robdelo have cancelled plans to visit \nelderly relatives abroad. \n102.  Under the Rescission Memorandum, thousands of Dreamers will lose their work \nauthorization each day beginning March 6, 2018. Many Dreamers, such as Plaintiffs Angel \nAguiluz, Heymi Elvir Maldonado, Nathaly Uribe Robledo, Eliseo Mages, Jesus Eusebio Perez, \nJosue Aguiluz, Jose Aguiluz, and Brenda Moreno Martinez are worried they will lose their jobs \nwhen their work authorization expires.  Other Dreamers, including Annabelle Martinez Herra, \nhave already lost their employment. \n103.   Under the Rescission Memorandum, thousands of Dreamers face the risk of \nlosing their employment, as well as vital benefits, such as driver licenses, financial aid, disability \nand health benefits, among others. They will also lose their protection from deportation, meaning \nthat they risk permanent separation from their family and community. \n104.  Under the Rescission Memorandum, the federal government will break up \nhundreds of thousands of families.  Many Dreamers, including Plaintiffs A.M, Annabelle \nMartinez Herra, and Maricruz Abarca live in households with American citizen family members. \nDeporting Dreamers will split these recipients from their citizen family members.   \n105.   Under the Rescission Memorandum, Dreamers enrolled in colleges and \nuniversities, including Plaintiffs Angel Aguiluz, Estefany Rodriguez, Maricruz Abarca, and \nJosue Aguiluz, will be unable to plan for the future, apply for and obtain internships, study \n  38 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 39 of 61\nabroad, simultaneously work to pay costs and fees, and obtain certain financial aid and \nscholarships -- forcing many to withdraw from their college or university. \n106.  Under the Rescission Memorandum, Dreamers who applied for and received \nadvance parole from USCIS and have paid the required fees have no assurances that they will be \nreadmitted into the United States if they travel abroad.  Instead, the Rescission Memorandum \nstates only that DHS will “generally’ honor previously approved applications.  Even individuals \ncurrently travelling abroad based on advance parole granted before September 5, 2017 are at risk \nof being denied re-admission. \n107.  Despite the federal government’s repeated promises that it would not use the \ninformation submitted by DACA applicants to conduct enforcement measures, the Rescission \nMemorandum provides no assurance to Dreamers, or direction to USCIS, ICE, and CBP that \ninformation contained in DACA applications or renewal requests cannot be used for the purpose \nof future immigration enforcement proceedings.   \n108.  To the contrary, USCIS and other government agencies have released guidance \nsuggesting an intention to welch on those promises and to share that information with ICE and \nCBP.  While the FAQs to the DACA Memorandum unequivocally represented that, with limited \nand specified exceptions, information provided pursuant to a DACA application would be kept \nconfidential and not used for immigration enforcement, the Rescission FAQs state: \"Generally, \ninformation provided in DACA requests will not be proactively provided to other law \nenforcement entities (including ICE and CBP) for the purpose of immigration enforcement \nproceedings unless the requestor poses a risk to national security or public safety, or meets the \ncriteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear [\"NTA''] or a referral to ICE under the [NTA] \n  39 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 40 of 61\ncriteria.\"60  The addition of the qualifiers \"generally\" and “proactively” makes the representation \nnearly meaningless, arrogating to USCIS the ability to make the sensitive information submitted \nby individual DACA applciants available to ICE for previously prohibited purposes, including \nimmigration enforcement, so long as it does so “specifically” and  not “proactively.”  For \nexample, the language indicates that USCIS would provide DACA applicant data in response to \na request from ICE; such action would be directly contrary to the positions USCIS adopted in its \nPrivacy Impact Assessment. \n109.   As noted earlier, the DACA application form required applicants to provide a \nwealth of personal, sensitive information.   DACA applicants were also required to provide DHS \nwith a detailed history of their criminal arrests and convictions, including all misdemeanors, \nhowever minor.  In addition, applicants were required to affirmatively declare whether they had \never been placed in removal proceedings in the past.   \n110.  Many DACA recipients have final orders of removal, generally issued in absentia \nwhen they were minors.  If their information is shared with ICE or CBP, these individuals will be \nsubject to an extreme risk of expedited deportation, which can occur within days or even hours, \nwith minimal procedural safeguards. \n111.  Plaintiffs and other Dreamers cannot but be worried, as the Defendants have \nthreatened them both directly and indirectly (by refusing to reaffirm the privacy of their applicant \ndata, and by targeting immigrants for deportation who have not been convicted of criminal \nactivity):  \n  President Trump has taken affirmative steps to reduce the privacy protections \napplicable to DACA data. In January 2017, President Trump issued Executive \n                                                 \n60 DHS, Frequently Asked Questions: Rescission of Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA) (“Rescission \nFAQs”) Q8 (emphasis added), https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/frequently-asked-questions-rescission-\ndeferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca (last published Sept. 5, 2017). \n  40 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 41 of 61\nOrder 13,768 directing all agencies, including DHS, to “ensure that their \nprivacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful \npermanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding \npersonally identifiable information.”61  \nPursuant to Executive Order 13,768, on April 25, 2017, DHS issued a new \nPrivacy Policy Guidance Memorandum introducing new “legal and policy \nobligations.”  Among these obligations is a new “transparency” obligation that \nrequires “all information sharing that relates to immigrants and non-\nimmigrants must be described and justified in the appropriate PIA… ”  \nAnother obligation listed is “purpose specification,” which states that use of \nany information collected “must be compatible with the purpose for which \nDHS originally collected the information; the PIA must identify and explain \nthis compatibility.” 62  Notwithstanding these commitments, DHS also stated \nthat its new privacy policy “permits the sharing of information about \nimmigrants and non-immigrants with federal, state, and local law \nenforcement.” 63  \n  In February 2017, DHS announced a change in immigration enforcement \npriorities.  Previously, DHS enforcement priorities were generally consistent \nwith the DACA Memorandum, prioritizing people who had committed serious \nfelonies, serious misdemeanors, or multiple less serious misdemeanors, and \nmaking Dreamers (and others similarly situated) the lowest enforcement \npriority.  The February 2017 Enforcement Priorities Memorandum radically \nbroadened the categories of people who are to be prioritized for removal, to \ninclude people “convicted of any criminal offense” (no matter how minor), \n“charged with any criminal offense” (even if unadjudicated or dismissed), or \n“committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offense” (an \nastoundingly vague proposition).64    \n  In February 2017, ICE reportedly implemented a new policy authorizing \nimmigration arrests of collateral, nontargeted individuals (i.e., individual \nbystanders who are not otherwise enforcement priorities) found at the scene of \nenforcement operations.65  Pursuant to this change, a number of Dreamers \nhave been arrested and subjected to immigration enforcement proceedings. \n                                                 \n61 Exec.

Sessions \nstated in an interview on Fox News’ “Happening Now,” program—in \nresponse to a question regarding the deportation of a Dreamer—that \n“[e]verybody in the country illegally is subject to being deported, so people \ncome here and they stay here a few years and somehow they think they are not \nsubject to being deported -- well, they are. . . . we can’t promise people who \nare here unlawfully that they aren’t going to be deported.”67 \n  On June 13, 2017, Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan testified in front of \nthe House Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Homeland Security, \nstating as to “every immigrant in the country without papers,” that they \n“should be uncomfortable. You should look over your shoulder. And you need \nto be worried. . . . No population is off the table. . . . If we wait for them to \nviolate yet another law against a citizen of this country, then it’s too late. We \nshouldn’t wait for them to become a criminal.”68 \n  On June 29, Homan stated: “people that enter this country illegally violate \nthe laws of this country.  You can't want to be a part of this great nation and \nnot respect its laws.. . .  they already committed one crime by entering the \ncountry illegally. . . . As far as fear in the immigrant community. . . My \npurpose is to dispel the notion that if you enter this country illegally and \nviolate the laws of this nation, you should not be comfortable. . . if you enter \nthis country illegally, you should be concerned that someone is looking for \nyou.  You should be concerned because you violated the laws of this \ncountry.”69 \n                                                 \n66 See Jenny Jarvie, Immigrant rights groups denounce new ICE policy that targets parents of child migrants, L.A. \nTimes (Jun. 30, 2017). \n67 Adam Shaw, Sessions defends immigration policies after reported ‘DREAMer’ deportation, Fox News (Apr. 19, \n2017). \n68 Hearing on the ICE and CBP F.Y. 2018 Budget Before the Subcomm. on Homeland Security of the H.

And that message is clear.”70 \n  An internal White House memo reported on by CNN stated that DHS now is \nurging Dreamers “to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United \nStates” when their DACA terms end.71  \n  A CBP memo reportedly issued on September 6 directed agents to detain \nindividuals claiming DACA at CPB checkpoints until their DACA and work \npermit could be verified, and that if there is any derogatory information \nindicating ineligibility, CPB is to commence deportation proceedings \nimmediately.72  \n  On September 27, 2017, Acting Secretary Duke testified that she had never \nseen DHS’s guidance assuring Dreamers their information would not be used \nfor immigration purposes. \n112.  These changes all signal Defendants' intent to renege on their promises and \nsubject Dreamers to immigration enforcement. Dreamers immediately face increased risk that \ninformation they provided to the federal government, in reliance of promises not to use it against \nthem, could be used against them, without notice, for purposes of immigration enforcement, \nincluding detention or deportation.  At the very least, these changes create confusion about the \nnew risk faced by current and former Dreamers and former applicants, particularly those whose \nDACA protection is ending under the Rescission Memorandum.  \n113.   The Rescission Memorandum does not explain how DHS or USCIS could legally \nprovide DACA applicant information to ICE or CBP.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552a (b) (“No agency shall \ndisclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to \n                                                 \n70 Press Release, The White House Office of the Press Secretary, Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee \nSanders et al.

The Rescission Memorandum also does not explain how DHS or USCIS  can \njustify continuing to maintain applicant data collected for DACA, from individuals relying on \nprior agency representations and policies, when the administration has rescinded DACA.   See 5 \nUSC § 552a (c)(1) (an agency “shall maintain in its records only such information about \nan individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be \naccomplished by statute or by executive order of the President”). \n115.  The Rescission Memorandum does not state how providing DACA applicant \ninformation to enforcement authorities would be consistent with DHS’ self-adopted privacy \npolicies or consistent with the agency’s procedures and precedent. \n116.  The Rescission Memorandum does not state how providing DACA applicant \ninformation to enforcement authorities would not be a retroactive revision to an agency policy \nupon which Dreamers relied. \n117.  The Rescission Memorandum does not explain how the government will keep \npreviously-provided DACA applicant information secure, nor does it provide any reason to \nbelieve that immigration enforcement agents will not use such information to find and remove \nthose who applied for DACA.  This retreat from prior assurances of privacy protection is \nparticularly alarming in light of Defendant Homan’s threats that immigrants should be \n“uncomfortable,” “should look over your shoulder,” and “be worried.   \n  44 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 45 of 61\n  DHS RESCINDS DACA WITHOUT NOTICE, COMMENT, OR ANY \nSUFFICIENT EXPLANATION FOR ITS CHANGE IN POSITION  \n118.  The Rescission Memorandum is a final, substantive agency action that required \nDHS to comply with the notice and comment requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. § 553(b).  But \nthe agency provided no opportunity for notice and comment before taking this action.  \n119.  By failing to comply with these notice and comment requirements, DHS deprived \nPlaintiffs, and all other interested parties, of the opportunity to present important evidence to the \nagency about DACA.  \n120.   In the Rescission Memorandum, DHS did not sufficiently explain its abrupt \ndeparture from prior agency statements regarding the necessity and legality of DACA.  \na.  In issuing the Rescission Memorandum, the federal government and \nDefendant Sessions misleadingly claimed that DACA was \nunconstitutional, although no court has so held.73  The single paragraph in \nthe Rescission Memorandum explaining the rationale behind this sudden \nshift merely asserts that DACA \"should be terminated\" based on \nconsideration of two factors: (I) the appellate rulings in a case regarding a \n2014 memorandum from then-DHS Secretary Johnson that expanded \nDACA and created a new program, Deferred Action for Parents of \nAmericans and Lawful Permanent Residents (\"DAPA\"), Texas v. United \nStates, 809 F.3d 134 3 (5th Cir. 20 15), aff'd by an equally divided court \nsub nom. United States v. Texas,_ U.S. _, 4 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016); and \n(2) a September 4, 2017, letter from Attorney General Jefferson B. \nSessions arguing that DACA was \"unconstitutional\" because it had been \n“effectuated . . . through executive action” and was invalid for the same \nreasons the Fifth Circuit struck down DAPA in the Texas case.74  \nb.  DHS and DOJ ignored differences between DACA and DAPA when \nreaching this conclusion.  Further, DHS ignored the fact that the legality of \nDACA was never directly at issue in the Texas v. United States case, and \nnot ruled on by the Fifth Circuit.  \nc.  In concluding that DACA was unconstitutional, Defendant Sessions failed \nto consider a November 19, 2014 opinion from the Department of Justice \n                                                 \n73 Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks on DACA, \nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-daca (September 5, 2017). \n74 Letter from Jefferson B.

The Rescission Memorandum’s conclusion that DACA is unconstitutional \nis impossible to reconcile with the Defendants decision to continue DACA \nfor six additional months. \n121.  The rescission is inconsistent with promises the government made to Dreamers, \non which they relied, that only \"fraud or misrepresentation\" in the application process or \n\"[s]ubsequent criminal activity\" are grounds for revocation of DACA.76  \n122.  Beyond Defendant Sessions’s conclusory assertions of DACA's legal infirmity, \nDHS failed to offer any explanation of its own why it believed that rescinding DACA was \nwarranted. The Rescission Memorandum did not address the rationale that DHS expressed in \n2012 in the DACA Memorandum regarding the use of prosecutorial discretion to focus resources \nand priorities on lowest priority individuals, much less offer any explanation as to why those \nfactors had changed so radically as to justify rescinding DACA now.  \n123.  Hours after DACA was rescinded, President Trump tweeted that, if Congress fails \nto provide similar protections through legislation, \"I will revisit this issue!\" This statement \nundermines DHS’ faux constitutional rationale for rescission because it confirms that the \nPresident has authority to reinstate some or all of DACA without Congressional authorization.  \n124.   President Trump’s September 5, 2017 statement is the latest in a series of \nadmissions he has made that expressly or implicitly recognize the DACA program was legal, \nundermining the purported rationale for rescinding the program.  For example: \n                                                 \n75 See, e.g., Memorandum to Att’ys of the Office of Legal Counsel, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, from David Barron, \nActing Assistant Att’y General, Best Practices for OLC Legal Advice and Written Opinions (July 16, 2010). \n76 USCIS Approval Notice, Form 1-821 D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.   \n  46 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 47 of 61\n  On December 8, 2016, then-President-elect Trump stated in an interview with \nTIME magazine that he would find an accommodation for Dreamers, stating, \n“We’re going to work something out that’s going to make people happy and \nproud.”77 \n  On January 18, 2017, then President-elect Trump promised in an interview \nwith Fox & Friends that he was “working on a plan right now. And that plan, \nover the next two to three months, is going to come out. And it’s a plan that’s \ngoing to be very firm, but it’s going to have a lot of heart.”78  \n  On March 29, 2017, Secretary Kelly reaffirmed that “DACA status” is a \n“commitment . . . by the government towards the DACA person, or the so-\ncalled Dreamer.”79  \n  On April 21, 2017, President Trump confirmed that his Administration’s \npolicy is not to deport Dreamers, and suggested that they “should rest easy.”80  \n125.  These statements directly contravening Defendants' purported justification for \nrescinding DACA confirm that the rescission rests on racist animus against Mexican and Central \nAmerican immigrants.  Other false and misleading statements by the President and \nadministration officials confirm that the legal justification offered for the rescission is pretextual:  \n  On September 5, 2017, President Trump issued a written statement on the \nrescission of DACA that stated: \"The temporary implementation of DACA . . . \nhelped spur a humanitarian crisis -- the massive surge of unaccompanied \nminors from Central America including, in some cases, young people who \nwould become members of violent gangs throughout our country, such as MS-\n13.\"81  \n  On the same day, just prior to Attorney General Sessions's announcement \nrescinding DACA, President Trump tweeted, \"No longer will we incentivize \nillegal immigration. LAW AND ORDER! #MAGA,\" and \"Make no mistake, \nwe are going to put the interest of AMERICAN CITIZENS FIRST!\"82  \n                                                 \n77  Michael Scherer, Person of the Year 2016, TIME Magazine (Dec. 2016). \n78 Francesca Chambers, Trump signals he’s softening on immigration as he says he’s ‘working on a plan’ that will \nmake DREAMers ‘very happy,’ Daily Mail (Jan. 18, 2017). \n79 Ted Hesson & Seung Min Kim, Wary Democrats Look to Kelly for Answers on Immigration, Politico (Mar. 29, \n2017). \n80Transcript of interview with Trump, Associated Press (Apr. 21, 2017). \n81 Press Release, The White House Office of the Press Secretary, Statement from President Donald J.

The Rescission Memorandum makes no reference to unaccompanied minors, \npublic safety concerns, or economic interests to explain the agency's action.  These shifting, \nconflicting, and factually inaccurate statements by the Trump Administration -- that DACA \ncreated a surge in illegal immigration, and that DACA recipients take jobs away from other \nAmerican workers -- expose the cursory legal rationale in the Rescission Memorandum's as a \nsham.  The APA requires governmental agencies to publicly state a sufficient justification for \ntheir actions, particularly where, people have relied upon DHS's prior statements to their \ndetriment.  \n127.  Moreover, these statements are wholly controverted by available evidence \ndemonstrating the contributions of Dreamers to the United States, as explained above. See Motor \nVeh. Mfrs. Ass 'n of U.S. , Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

In making a decision contradicted by the available evidence, providing a false \njustification for the rescission and promoting the rescission because of discriminatory animus, \nDefendants abused their discretion and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in violation \nof the APA.  \n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nFIRST COUNT \nFIFTH AMENDMENT – DUE PROCESS \n(All Defendants) \n \n129.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \nin the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n130.  Immigrants who are physically present in the United States are guaranteed the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause.  \n131.  The Constitution imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive \nindividuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment. \n132.  The property interests protected by the Due Process Clause extend beyond \ntangible property and include anything to which a plaintiff has a legitimate claim of entitlement. \nA legitimate claim of entitlement is created by rules or understandings that secure certain \nbenefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits. \n133.  The term “liberty” also encompasses the ability to work, raise a family, and form \nthe other enduring attachments of normal life.  \n134.  Dreamers, including Plaintiffs, have constitutionally protected liberty and \nproperty interests in their DACA and the numerous benefits conferred thereunder, including the \nability to renew their DACA every two years. These protected interests exist by virtue of the \n  49 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 50 of 61\ngovernment’s decision to grant Dreamers certain benefits and its repeated representations and \npromises regarding DACA.  \n135.  In promoting DACA, USCIS affirmatively promised Dreamers that if their case \nwas deferred, they would be eligible for benefits, including employment authorization, advance \nparole to travel internationally, and to attend educational institutions. \n136.  Dreamers, including certain of the plaintiffs, were granted employment \nauthorization, advance parole to travel internationally, the right to attend educational institutions, \npublic benefits (including Social Security, Medicare, and disability benefits).  They were able to \nsecure equal access to other benefits and opportunities on which Americans depend, including \nopening bank accounts, obtaining credit cards, starting businesses, purchasing homes and cars, \nand conducting other aspects of daily life that are otherwise often unavailable for undocumented \nimmigrants. \n137.  In establishing and continuously operating DACA under a well-defined \nframework of highly specific criteria—including nearly 150 pages of specific instructions for \nmanaging the program—the government created a reasonable expectation among Plaintiffs and \nother Dreamers that they are entitled to the benefits provided under the program, including the \nability to seek renewal of their DACA, as long as they continue to play by the rules and meet the \nprogram’s nondiscretionary criteria for renewal. \n138.  The government deprived Plaintiffs and other Dreamers of their property and \nliberty interests under this program, including their ability to seek renewal of their DACA, their \nright to work authorization, and their right to travel internationally without a right to be heard or \nother individualized procedural protections.   \n  50 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 51 of 61\n139.  The government’s arbitrary termination of DACA and deprivation of the \nopportunity to renew DACA violates the due process rights of Plaintiffs and other Dreamers. \n140.  The government’s decision to terminate DACA after vigorously promoting the \nprogram and coaxing hundreds of thousands of highly vulnerable young people to step forward is \nan unconstitutional bait-and-switch.  The government promised Plaintiffs and other young people \nthat if they disclosed highly sensitive personal information, passed a background check, and \nplayed by the rules, they would be able to live and work in the United States. \n141.  The government did not follow its normal procedures in reversing course and \nterminating DACA.  In 2014, the OLC concluded, after conducting a detailed analysis, that \nDACA was a lawful exercise of the Executive Branch’s discretion. By contrast, Attorney \nGeneral Sessions’s one-page letter to Acting Secretary Duke contains virtually no legal analysis, \nand Acting Secretary Duke’s Rescission Memorandum relied largely on Attorney General \nSessions’s letter. \n142.  The Due Process Clause also requires that the federal government’s immigration \nenforcement actions be fundamentally fair. Here, the government’s arbitrary decisions to \nterminate DACA is fundamentally unfair. \n143.  Defendants’ violations of the Due Process Clause have harmed Plaintiffs and will \ncontinue to cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and other Dreamers. \nSECOND COUNT \nFIFTH AMENDMENT – DUE PROCESS \n(All Defendants) \n \n144.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \nin the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n  51 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 52 of 61\n145.  Immigrants who are physically present in the United States are guaranteed the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause.   \n146.  The Constitution imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive \nindividuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.  \n147.  Dreamers, including Plaintiffs, have constitutionally protected liberty and \nproperty interests in the sensitive personal information they disclosed to the government in \nreliance on the government’s explicit and repeated assurances that it would not be used for \nimmigration enforcement purposes and would in fact be “protected from disclosure” to ICE and \nCBP.    \n148.  The protected interest in the nondisclosure of sensitive personal information exists \nby virtue of the government’s decision to make repeated assurances to Dreamers that this \ninformation would not be used for enforcement purposes.  \n149.  The government’s decision to terminate DACA after vigorously promoting the \nprogram and coaxing hundreds of thousands of highly vulnerable young people to step forward is \nan unconstitutional bait-and-switch.  The government promised Plaintiffs and other young people \nthat if they disclosed highly sensitive personal information, passed a background check, and \nplayed by the rules, they would be able to live and work in the United States. \n150.  The government’s retraction of its publicly declared and repeatedly reaffirmed \npolicy not to share with ICE and CPB Dreamers’ DACA application information violates due \nprocess.  The government has already violated other assurances regarding DACA, and there is \nimminent danger that it will similarly breach its representations regarding information-sharing. \nIndeed, the government already has breached its prior commitments to affirmatively “protect[] \n  52 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 53 of 61\n[sensitive information] from disclosure,” now asserting only that it will not “proactively \nprovide[]” such information to ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement \nproceedings. \n151.  The government deprived Plaintiffs and other Dreamers of their property and \nliberty interests as to their sensitive personal information without a right to be heard or other \nindividualized procedural protections.   \n152.  The Due Process Clause also requires that the federal government’s immigration \nenforcement actions be fundamentally fair. Here, the government’s arbitrary decisions to \nterminate DACA and change the policy regarding the use of information provided by Dreamers \nare fundamentally unfair. \n153.  Defendants’ violations of the Due Process Clause have harmed Plaintiffs and will \ncontinue to cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and other Dreamers. \n \nTHIRD COUNT \nFIFTH AMENDMENT – EQUAL PROTECTION \n(All Defendants) \n \n154.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \nin the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n155.  The equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment forbids federal officials \nfrom acting with a discriminatory intent or purpose.  \n156.  To succeed on an equal protection claim, plaintiffs must show that the defendants \ndiscriminated against them as members of an identifiable class and that the discrimination was \nintentional. Determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor \ndemands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be \navailable.  \n  53 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 54 of 61\n157.  As set forth above, the termination of DACA was motivated by improper \ndiscriminatory intent and bias against Mexican nationals, individuals of Mexican and Central \nAmerican descent, and Latinos, who together account for 93 percent of approved DACA \napplications. \n158.  President Trump’s history and that of other senior administration officials of \nalleging that Mexican, Central American, and Latino immigrants are rapists, criminals, and \notherwise bad people demonstrate discriminatory animus. It is this animus that motivated the \nDACA rescission. \n159.  The government allows other classes of immigrants to remain eligible for deferred \naction, and remain eligible for benefit associated with deferred action.  Because Mexican, \nCentral American, and Latinos account for 93 percent of approved DACA applications, they will \nbe disproportionately impacted by the termination of DACA. \n160.  The history, procedure, substance, context, and impact of the decision to \nterminate DACA demonstrate that the decision was motivated by discriminatory animus against \nMexican, Central American, and Latino immigrants. Because it was motivated by a \ndiscriminatory purpose, the decision to terminate DACA violates the equal protection guarantee \nof the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n161.  Defendants’ violations of the Equal Protection Clause have caused ongoing harm \nto Plaintiffs and other Dreamers. \nFOURTH COUNT \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n(All Defendants Except Trump) \n \n162.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \nin the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n  54 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 55 of 61\n163.  Defendants are subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). See 5 \nU.S.C. § 703.  \n164.  The termination of DACA is final agency action subject to judicial review \nbecause it marks the consummation of the decisionmaking process and is one from which legal \nconsequences will flow.  The comprehensive scope of the APA provides a default remedy for all \ninteractions between individuals and all federal agencies. \n165.  The APA requires that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law . . . [or] contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (B). \na.  As detailed in Counts I and II, the decision to terminate DACA is \nunconstitutional in numerous respects and therefore must be vacated. \nb.  The decision to terminate DACA is arbitrary and capricious and contrary \nto law because, among other reasons, the government failed to consider \nimportant aspects of the issue, offered explanations for its decision \ninconsistent with the evidence before it, and its explanations are so \nimplausible that its decision cannot be due to a difference in opinion or the \nproduct of agency expertise.  And because the government failed to \nprovide a reasoned analysis sufficient to justify its change of policy in \nlight of the serious reliance interests created by DACA.   \ni.  The purported rationales for rescission of the program contradict \nthe available evidence.  Among other things, the rescission does \nnot provide a reasoned analysis for the rescission, nor does it \naddress the prior Department of Justice OLC analysis concluding \nthe program was constitutional.   \nii.  The purported rationale for rescission of the program – that the \nExecutive Branch purportedly lacked authority to conduct the \nprogram -- is inconsistent with the ongoing continuation of the \nprogram and the admissions by the President and various \nadministration officials that the President has the authority to \ncontinue the program. \niii.  The government’s decision not to accept any DACA renewal \napplications after October 5, 2017 is also arbitrary. The Rescission \n  55 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 56 of 61\nMemorandum does not provide a reasoned analysis to support this \ndeadline, and the government has failed to provide sufficient time \nand notice to Dreamers. \niv.  The government’s decision not to accept new applications after \nSeptember 5, 2017 is arbitrary.  The Rescission Memorandum does \nnot provide a reasoned analysis to support this deadline. \nv.  The government’s decision not to accept renewal requests for \nDreamers whose status expired before September 5, 2017 is \narbitrary. The Rescission Memorandum does not provide a \nreasoned analysis to support this deadline. \nvi.  The government’s decision not to accept renewal requests for \nDACA recipients whose status expires after March 5, 2018 is \narbitrary.  The Rescission Memorandum does not provide a \nreasoned analysis to support this decision. \nvii.  The government’s decision to terminate DACA is also in violation \nof the APA because the stated rationale for ending the program is \npretextual and incorrect as a matter of law. \nc.  The government’s decision regarding potential sharing of personal \ninformation collected from DACA applicants is arbitrary and capricious \nand contrary to law. \ni.  The government’s failure to abide by the specific and consistent \npromise that information obtained from DACA applicants would \nnot be used for immigration enforcement purposes violates the \nPrivacy Act’s prohibition on agency sharing records with another \nagency.  5 U.S.C. § 552a(b). \nii.  The government’s failure to abide by the specific promise in the \nDACA Privacy Impact Assessment that information collected from \nDACA applicants would not be used for immigration enforcement \npurposes violates the e-Government Act provision requiring an \nagency abide by its Privacy Impact Assessment.  44 U.S.C. § 3501 \net seq. \niii.  The government’s maintenance of records for Dreamers following \nrescission of DACA violates the Privacy Act prohibition on an \nagency maintaining records beyond those which are necessary to \naccomplish a purpose required to be accomplished by executive \norder of the President.   5 U.S.C. § 552a(c)(1). \niv.  The stated change in the government’s protection of DACA \napplicant data from use for immigration enforcement proceedings \nis invalid under APA 5 U.S.C. § 551(4) because it carries an \n  56 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 57 of 61\nunreasonable retroactive effect, incurring new and harmful legal \nconsequences where individuals submitted their data in detrimental \nreliance on prior DHS policies and representations.   \nv.  The government’s retention of applicants’ personally identifiable \ninformation and declaration of the potential disclosure of this \ninformation for immigration enforcement purposes violates DHS’ \nown policies and established practices without providing a \nreasoned justification for deviation from its own policies.   \nvi.  The change in the government’s policy regarding protection of \nDACA applicant data from use for immigration enforcement \nproceedings is not based on a reasoned analysis contained in the \nRescission Memorandum. \nvii.  The change in the government’s policy regarding protection of \nDACA applicant data from use for immigration enforcement \nproceedings is not adequately explained in the Rescission \nMemorandum, particularly in light of the DACA recipients’ strong \nreliance on the government’s commitment not to use this \ninformation for enforcement purposes.  \n166.  Defendants’ violations of the APA have caused ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and \nother Dreamers. \nFIFTH COUNT \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n(All Defendants Except Trump) \n \n167.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 553 and 706(2)(D), requires that federal agencies conduct \nrulemaking before engaging in action that impacts substantive rights. \n168.  DHS and USCIS are each an “agency” under the APA, and the Rescission \nMemorandum and the actions that DHS and USCIS has taken to implement the Rescission \nMemorandum are “rules” under the APA. See 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), (4). \n169.  In implementing the Rescission Memorandum, federal agencies have changed the \nsubstantive criteria by which individual Dreamers work, live, attend school, obtain credit, and \ntravel in the United States, thus imposing rights and obligations on Dreamers.  The Rescission \n  57 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 58 of 61\nMemorandum modifies substantive rights and interests and so is subject to notice and comment \nrulemaking.   \n170.  With exceptions that are not applicable here, agency efforts that change \nsubstantive rights and interests must go through notice-and-comment rulemaking. See 5 U.S.C. § \n553. \n171.  Defendants promulgated and implemented these changes to Dreamer rights and \ninterests without notice-and-comment rulemaking in violation of the APA. \n172.  Plaintiffs will be impacted because they have not had the opportunity to comment \non the rescission of DACA. \n173.  Defendants’ violation of the APA has caused ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and other \nDreamers. \nSIXTH COUNT \nESTOPPEL \n174.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \nin the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n175.  Through its conduct and statements, the government represented to Plaintiffs and \nother Dreamers that DACA was lawful and that information collected in connection with DACA \nwould not be used for immigration enforcement purposes absent special circumstances. \n176.  In reliance on the government’s repeated assurances, Plaintiffs and other \nDreamers risked removal and deportation and came forward and identified themselves to the \ngovernment, and provided sensitive personal information, including their fingerprints and \npersonal history, in order to participate in DACA. \n177.  Throughout the life of DACA, the government has continued to make affirmative \nrepresentations about the use of information as well as the validity and legality of DACA. \n  58 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 59 of 61\nPlaintiffs and other Dreamers relied on the government’s continuing representations to their \ndetriment. \n178.  DACA beneficiaries rearranged their lives to become fully visible and \ncontributing members of society, including by seeking employment, pursuing higher education, \nand paying taxes, but are now at real risk of removal and deportation. \n179.  Accordingly, Defendants should be equitably estopped from terminating DACA \nor from using information provided pursuant to DACA for immigration enforcement purposes, \nexcept as previously authorized under DACA. \n180.  An actual controversy between Plaintiffs and Defendants exists as to whether \nDefendants should be equitably estopped. \n181.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that Defendants are equitably estopped.  \nSEVENTH COUNT \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT DACA IS LAWFUL \n182.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \nin the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n183.  DACA was a lawful exercise of the Executive Branch’s discretion to enforce the \nimmigration laws. Indeed, after performing a thorough analysis, the government itself concluded \nthat DACA was lawful.  However, the government now claims, as the basis for its rescission of \nthe program, that DACA is unlawful.  \n184.  The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, allows the court, “[i]n a case of \nactual controversy within its jurisdiction,” to “declare the rights and other legal relations of any \ninterested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.” 28 \nU.S.C. § 2201(a). \n  59 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 60 of 61\n185.  As DACA beneficiaries, Plaintiffs have an interest in the legality of DACA. The \ngovernment’s decision to terminate DACA on the purported basis that DACA was unlawful has \nharmed Plaintiffs and continues to cause ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \n \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA.  Declare that the Rescission and actions taken by Defendants to rescind DACA are \nvoid and without legal force or effect; \nB.  Declare that the Rescission and actions taken by Defendants to rescind DACA are \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, and without \nobservance of procedure required by law in violation of 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-706; \nC.  Declare that the Rescission and actions taken by Defendants to rescind DACA are \nin violation of the Constitution and contrary to the laws of the United States; \nD.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin and restrain Defendants, their agents, \nservants, employees, attorneys, and all persons in active concert or participation with any of \nthem, from implementing or enforcing the Rescission and from taking any other action to rescind \nDACA that is not in compliance with applicable law; \nE.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin and restrain Defendants, their agents, \nservants, employees, attorneys, and all persons in active concert or participation with any of \nthem, from disclosing any DACA applicant information to immigration enforcement activities in \na manner inconsistent with their prior commitments; \nF.  Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n  60 \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-RWT   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 61 of 61\n \nDated: October 5, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n    \n   \n   \n   \n__/s/ Dennis A.

Under \nthat policy, individuals illegally in this country who met certain criteria could receive \ndeferred action, a temporary forbearance from removal that may also entail certain \ncollateral benefits. From its inception, the policy was a stop-gap measure in \nanticipation of potential legislative action, and the government made clear that the \npolicy did not grant any substantive rights, lawful immigration status, or pathway to \ncitizenship. The government later expanded the criteria for DACA and created a new \npolicy known as DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful \nPermanent Residents). Texas and twenty-five other states brought suit challenging the \nlatter policies. The suit led to a nationwide injunction that was affirmed by the Fifth \nCircuit and by an equally divided Supreme Court. Texas then threatened to challenge \nthe original DACA policy. \nIn September 2017, in light of the prior litigation and a legal assessment by the \nAttorney General, the then-Acting Secretary of Homeland Security rescinded the \nDACA policy through an orderly wind-down. Plaintiffs in these and other suits \nchallenged that enforcement decision on a variety of grounds under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution.  \nAs an initial matter, the Acting Secretary’s decision is not subject to judicial \nreview in this action. The rescission of DACA was an exercise of enforcement \n \n\ndiscretion that is traditionally committed to agency discretion under the APA. 5 \nU.S.C. § 701(a)(2); Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830-32 (1985). And, assuming \narguendo that judicial review of this deferred-action rescission were available, under the \nterms of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), review could take place only on \nreview of a final removal decision. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b), (g); Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 485 (1999) (AADC). \nAlthough the district court erroneously concluded that it could review the \nActing Secretary’s decision, it properly recognized that any such review would be \nhighly deferential. The court acknowledged that while there is significant room for \ndisagreement over immigration enforcement generally and DACA in particular, such \npolicy decisions belong in the hands of the political branches, and it declined to \ndisturb the Acting Secretary’s decision. The district court was correct.  \nFirst, the rescission of the DACA policy was not arbitrary and capricious under \nthe APA. For this purely discretionary enforcement decision, the INA prescribes no \nlegal or factual determinations that must be made or even considered. There is thus \nno warrant for setting aside the Acting Secretary’s rational decision to discontinue the \nDACA policy in light of the prior nationwide injunction against other closely related \npolicies, as well as the Attorney General’s opinion regarding the legal viability of \nDACA itself.    \nSecond, the district court’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ notice-and-comment challenge \nto the DACA rescission comports with both precedent and common sense. The APA \n2 \n \n\nexempts “general statements of policy” from notice and comment, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(b)(3)(A), and this type of reordering of deferred-action enforcement priorities \nreadily qualifies. Moreover, if the rescission of DACA required notice-and-comment \nrulemaking, the promulgation of that policy surely did as well.  \nThird, the district court correctly rejected plaintiffs’ claim that the Acting \nSecretary’s decision violated the Constitution. There was no denial of equal protection \nbecause the rescission of DACA applies equally to all persons without regard to their \nethnicity. This immigration enforcement policy is not subject to challenge based on \nthe common circumstance that it has a greater impact on members of certain \nethnicities than others, especially given the lack of any evidence that it was a \nsignificant factor in the Acting Secretary’s rescission of a policy of such questionable \nlegality that the aliens lacking lawful status who benefitted from the policy happened \nto be predominantly Latino. Nor was there any denial of due process. Plaintiffs have \nno protected liberty or property interest—DACA expressly conferred no substantive \nrights and was revocable at any time—and plaintiffs regardless have failed to \ndemonstrate any government conduct rising to the level of a substantive-due-process \nviolation. \nFourth, the district court correctly ruled in the government’s favor on the basis \nof the administrative record before it. Plaintiffs come nowhere near demonstrating \nbad faith—or any other ground—for supplementing the administrative record or \nobtaining discovery in this record-review case. \n3 \n \n\nThe district court correctly rejected all of plaintiffs’ challenges to the rescission \nof DACA, but erred in enjoining the government from modifying its policy regarding \nthe sharing of DACA requestors’ information. The court issued this injunction even \nthough (as it acknowledged) plaintiffs had no evidence that the policy had changed, \nand the original policy expressly stated that it could “be modified, superseded, or \nrescinded at any time.” JA.1532. In any event, there is no basis for an equitable \nestoppel claim against the government. The court’s nationwide permanent injunction \nshould be vacated. \nSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION \nPlaintiffs invoked the district court’s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. JA.47. \nOn March 5, 2018, the district court granted in part and denied in part the \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment, and it \ngranted plaintiffs permanent injunctive relief. JA.1519-20. On March 15, the district \ncourt modified the scope of its injunction. JA.1531. Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of \nappeal on April 27, 2018, and the government filed a timely notice of appeal on May \n4, 2018. JA.1534-36; JA.1537-38. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES \n1. Whether plaintiffs’ APA claims are not subject to review because the Acting \nSecretary’s decision to wind down the DACA non-enforcement policy was \n“committed to agency discretion by law,” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). \n4 \n \n\n2. Whether the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs’ claims in \nlight of the jurisdiction-channeling provisions in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) and (g). \n3.

Overview of “deferred action” and the Acting Secretary’s \ndecision to wind down the discretionary DACA non-\nenforcement policy \n1. The INA charges the Secretary of Homeland Security “with the \nadministration and enforcement” of the INA and “all other laws relating to the \nimmigration and naturalization of aliens.” 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1). Individuals are \nsubject to removal if, inter alia, “they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have been \n5 \n \n\nconvicted of certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law.” Arizona v. United \nStates, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012); see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a), 1227(a).  \nAs a practical matter, the federal government cannot remove every removable \nalien, and a “principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised \nby immigration officials.” Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396. The Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity is vested with authority to “[e]stablish[ ] national immigration enforcement \npolicies and priorities.” 6 U.S.C. § 202(5). In light of such policies and priorities, \nofficials of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must first “decide whether \nit makes sense to pursue removal at all.” Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396. “At each stage” of \nthe process, moreover, “the Executive has discretion to abandon the endeavor.” \nAADC, 525 U.S. at 483. Like other exercises of enforcement discretion, this may \ninvolve “a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within \n[the agency’s] expertise.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831.  \n2. This case concerns an application of the practice of “deferred action” by \nwhich the Secretary of Homeland Security may exercise discretion to forbear from \nseeking the removal of an alien for a designated period. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 483-\n84; 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) (describing “deferred action” as “an act of administrative \nconvenience to the government which gives some cases lower priority”). In addition \nto the temporary relief from removal directly flowing from a grant of deferred action, \ncertain collateral consequences may flow under pre-existing laws and regulations, \nincluding the ability to obtain work authorization in certain circumstances. See, e.g.,  \n6 \n \n\n8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14). However, DHS retains the discretion to revoke deferred \naction unilaterally, and an individual with deferred action remains removable at any \ntime. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 484-85. \nOn June 15, 2012, DHS announced the policy known as DACA, which makes \ndeferred action available to “certain young people who were brought to this country \nas children.” JA.129. Following successful completion of a background check and \nreview, an alien who met certain age, residence, and other guidelines could receive \ndeferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal. JA.130-31. The DACA \nMemorandum stated that it “confer[red] no substantive right, immigration status or \npathway to citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can \nconfer these rights.” JA.131. In implementing DACA, DHS stated that information \nprovided in the DACA request process would be protected from disclosure for the \npurpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless certain criteria related to \nnational security or public safety were satisfied, or the individual met the requirements \nfor a Notice to Appear. USCIS, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Frequently Asked \nQuestions, No. 19 (last updated Oct. 6, 2017; last visited July 31, 2018), \nhttps://go.usa.gov/xngCd (DHS DACA FAQ). The instructions also stated, \nhowever, that the information-sharing policy “may be modified, superseded or \nrescinded at any time without notice,” and that it “may not be relied upon to create \nany right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any \nadministrative, civil, or criminal matter.” DHS DACA FAQ 19.  \n7 \n \n\nOn November 20, 2014, DHS expanded DACA by broadening certain \nguidelines and extending the period of deferred action to three years. JA.167. It also \ncreated a new, similar policy known as DAPA for parents of American citizens and \nlawful permanent residents. JA.168-69. \nThe District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a nationwide \npreliminary injunction against DAPA and the expansion of DACA. Texas v. United \nStates, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (S.D. Tex. 2015). The Fifth Circuit affirmed, concluding \nthat the policy violated both the INA and the APA’s notice-and-comment \nrequirements. Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015). The Supreme Court \naffirmed the injunction by an equally divided Court. United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. \n2271 (2016) (per curiam). In response, then-Secretary John Kelly rescinded DAPA \nand the DACA expansion in June 2017. JA.363. Shortly thereafter, Texas threatened \nto challenge the original DACA policy. JA.366-68. \n3. On September 5, 2017, DHS issued a memorandum explaining its decision \nto wind down the remaining DACA policy in an orderly fashion. JA.380. As then-\nActing Secretary Elaine Duke explained in the memorandum, “[t]aking into \nconsideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing \nlitigation, and [a] September 4, 2017 letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that \nthe June 15, 2012 DACA program should be terminated.” JA.383. Therefore, “[i]n the \nexercise of [her] authority in establishing national immigration policies and priorities,” \nthe Acting Secretary determined to begin an orderly wind-down of the policy. Id. The \n8 \n \n\nmemorandum provides that DHS will “adjudicate—on an individual, case-by-case \nbasis—properly filed pending DACA renewal requests . . . from current beneficiaries \nwhose benefits will expire between the date of this memorandum and March 5, 2018 \nthat have been accepted by the Department as of October 5, 2017.” Id. The \nmemorandum further provides that DHS “[w]ill not terminate the grants of \npreviously issued deferred action or revoke Employment Authorization Documents \nsolely based on the directives in this memorandum” for the remaining periods of \ndeferred action. Id.  \nUpon the rescission of DACA, DHS reiterated that “[g]enerally, information \nprovided in DACA requests will not be proactively provided to other law \nenforcement entities . . . for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings” \nunless national security or public safety exceptions apply or the individual “meets the \ncriteria for issuance of Notice to Appear.” JA.1143. In December 2017, DHS further \nclarified that the “information-sharing policy has not changed in any way since it was \nfirst announced, including as a result of the Sept. 5, 2017” DACA rescission. USCIS, \nGuidance on Rejected DACA Requests, www.uscis.gov/daca2017/guidance-rejected-\ndaca2017 (Q5). \n4. On June 22, 2018, in response to an order from the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia in NAACP v. Trump, No. 17-1907 (D.D.C.), the \nSecretary of Homeland Security issued a memorandum further explaining the decision \nto rescind DACA. The new memorandum agrees with the reasoning of the Duke \n9 \n \n\nmemorandum and declines to disturb it. Memorandum from Secretary Kirstjen M. \nNielsen 2-3 (Nielsen Memo), https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ \n18_0622_S1_Memorandum_DACA.pdf. In particular, the Secretary confirms that, \nalthough she agrees that DACA is unlawful, the rescission is not predicated solely on \nthat legal determination. The Nielsen Memo explains that, whether or not DACA is \nactually unlawful, “there are, at a minimum, serious doubts about [the policy’s] \nlegality” that warrant its discontinuation. Id. at 2. The Nielsen Memo also offers other \nenforcement policy reasons wholly independent of DACA’s legality that support the \npolicy’s rescission, and explains why the asserted reliance interests of DACA \nrecipients do not lead to a different result. Id. at 2-3.  \nB.  Prior proceedings  \n1. Plaintiffs in this case are individual DACA recipients and nonprofit \nimmigrant services and policy organizations. Their complaint seeks to invalidate the \nrescission of DACA on APA, constitutional, and equitable grounds. See JA.85-96. \nPlaintiffs also challenge DHS’s authority to change its policy regarding how it may use \ninformation provided by DACA requesters. See JA.87-89, JA.94-95.  \n  2. In March 2018, the district court issued an order granting in part and denying \nin part the government’s motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary \njudgment, and granting summary judgment in part for the plaintiffs and in part for the \ngovernment. JA.1533. The district court first held that plaintiffs’ claims were \njusticiable, rejecting the argument that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) precluded judicial review \n10 \n \n\nand concluding that the APA’s exception for decisions “committed to agency \ndiscretion” by law does not preclude procedural review of agency action, which it \ncharacterized plaintiffs’ APA claims to be. JA.1501.  \n  On the merits of the APA claims, the district court held that DACA and the \nDACA rescission are “akin to non-binding policy statements” and therefore are not \nsubject to notice-and-comment requirements. JA.1505. The district court also \nconcluded that the DACA rescission was not arbitrary and capricious because “the \nbelief that it was unlawful and subject to serious legal challenge [was] completely \nrational,” and the rescission “was a carefully crafted decision supported by the \nAdministrative Record.” JA.1505-06. \n  The district court likewise rejected plaintiffs’ constitutional claims. With respect \nto the equal protection claim, the court concluded that the administrative record \n“does not support the notion that [the government] was targeting a subset of the \nimmigrant population” or that the decision was motivated by racial animus. JA.1508. \nThe district court also held that plaintiffs were not deprived of a protected procedural \ndue process interest because the DACA decision did not create any such interest. \nJA.1512-13. And the court further found no substantive due process violation because \nthe DACA rescission did “not shock the conscience of th[e] Court.” JA.1514. The \ndistrict court also granted summary judgment for the government with respect to \nplaintiffs’ claim that the government was estopped from rescinding DACA, \n11 \n \n\nconcluding that estoppel did not apply because DACA was expressly subject to \nrevocation at any time and did not confer any rights. JA.1515. \nThe district court granted relief to plaintiffs, however, on their estoppel claim \nregarding the government’s information-sharing policy. The district court concluded \nwithout analysis that the government “promised not to transfer or use the \ninformation gathered from Dreamers for immigration enforcement.” JA.1515. \nAlthough the district court did not dispute the government’s assurance that the \ninformation-sharing policy has not changed, it noted that “counsel for the \nGovernment was unable to provide any assurance that the Government would not \nmake changes” in the future. JA.1516. Accordingly, the court entered a permanent \ninjunction that, as amended, requires the government to comply with its 2012 policy, \nexcept that the government may no longer modify or rescind that policy. The \ninjunction further requires “any requests for deviation to be submitted to the district \ncourt for in camera review.” JA.1532-33.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe district court correctly declined to disturb Acting Secretary Duke’s \nmemorandum rescinding the discretionary DACA enforcement policy. The district \ncourt erred, however, in enjoining the government from modifying its information-\nsharing policy in the future. \nI. As an initial matter, the district court should have dismissed plaintiffs’ APA \nclaims as non-justiciable. In rescinding the previous non-enforcement policy \n12 \n \n\nembodied in DACA, the Acting Secretary reset the agency’s enforcement priorities. A \ndetermination of general enforcement policy, like other enforcement decisions, is \ntraditionally committed to agency discretion by law and thus not subject to APA \nclaims. See 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985). That is \nparticularly true in the immigration context, where the “broad discretion exercised by \nimmigration officials” is a “principal feature of the removal system.” Arizona v. United \nStates, 567 U.S. 387, 396-97 (2012). That the Acting Secretary’s discretionary \nenforcement decision was based on legal analysis is immaterial, because the fact that \nan “agency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action” does not \nmean that “the action becomes reviewable.” ICC v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Eng’rs, 482 \nU.S. 270, 283 (1987) (BLE) (emphases added).  \nNothing in the INA cabins that discretion here. To the contrary, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g) precludes jurisdiction over challenges to “‘no deferred action’ decisions and \nsimilar discretionary determinations . . . outside the streamlined process that Congress \nhas designed” for litigating an alien’s removal. Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination \nComm., 525 U.S. 471, 485 & n.9 (1999) (AADC); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9). Thus, \neven if the Acting Secretary’s exercise of enforcement discretion were subject to \nreview at all, that review could take place only in a petition from a final removal order.  \nII. In any event, the district court correctly concluded that the decision plainly \nsatisfies the APA’s deferential standard. Regardless whether the original DACA policy \nwas consistent with the INA, there is no claim that it was mandated by the statute or \n13 \n \n\nthat rescinding it violated the statute. And the Acting Secretary’s discretionary \nrescission of DACA based on her clearly expressed concern that it would be \nenmeshed in litigation and likely enjoined nationwide was eminently reasonable, given \nthe Texas litigation invalidating DAPA and expanded DACA, as well as the Attorney \nGeneral’s opinion that DACA would and should meet the same fate. Neither \nprecedent nor the APA required the Secretary to spell out the subsidiary legal reasons \nwhy it is illusory to distinguish DACA from expanded DACA and DAPA, and there \nlikewise is no basis for a court to set aside the Secretary’s purely discretionary \nenforcement decision based on mere disagreement with her reasonable legal \nconclusion. All the more so now that Secretary Nielsen has issued a memorandum \nfurther explaining the rescission and agreeing with Acting Secretary Duke’s decision.  \nContrary to plaintiffs’ contentions, the district court properly ruled based on \nthe administrative record before it. “The APA specifically contemplates judicial review \non the basis of the agency record,” and “[t]he focal point for judicial review should be \nthe administrative record already in existence, not some new record made initially in \nthe reviewing court.” Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 743-44 (1985). \nPlaintiffs have wholly failed to make the strong showing of bad faith required to rebut \nthe rule that discovery is not permitted in an APA suit. See Citizens to Preserve Overton \nPark v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971). \nThe district court also correctly concluded that plaintiffs’ procedural APA \nclaims fail. The rescission memorandum was plainly a general statement of policy, not \n14 \n \n\na substantive rule. See Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1016 (9th Cir.1987). It \nthus was not required to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking. \nThe district court was similarly correct that the Acting Secretary’s decision in \nno way violates the Constitution. The DACA rescission applies equally to persons of \nall ethnicities, although, like virtually all immigration policies, it has a disproportionate \neffect on certain ethnicities—here, Latinos from Central and South America. A \nchallenge to such a facially-neutral immigration enforcement policy based on \nallegations of discriminatory motive is not permitted under AADC. 525 U.S. at 488-\n92. And, even assuming such a challenge could proceed at all under AADC, plaintiffs \nhave come nowhere near alleging the clear evidence of outrageous government \nconduct necessary to make out a claim of discriminatory enforcement in the \nimmigration context. Id. The district court also correctly rejected plaintiffs’ \ncontentions that the rescission of DACA violated the protections of the Due Process \nClause. DACA itself created no protected liberty or property interest, and its \nrescission does not shock the conscience.  \nIII. Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate entitlement to the injunction entered \nby the district court. Even assuming a freestanding equitable estoppel claim against \nthe government were permissible, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate any change in \nthe government’s information-sharing policy, which has always permitted \nmodification. And, even assuming a change occurred, plaintiffs have not \ndemonstrated the affirmative misconduct required to make out an equitable estoppel \n15 \n \n\nclaim. At a minimum, the district court erred in granting plaintiffs nationwide relief. \nBedrock principles of standing and equitable discretion limit the scope of any \ninjunction to plaintiffs in these cases. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA district court’s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. Hill v. \nLockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., 354 F.3d 277, 283 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc). \nSummary judgment may be granted where there are no disputes of “material fact,” and \n“facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there \nis a ‘genuine’ dispute as to those facts.” Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007) \n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). The district court’s grant of a permanent injunction is \nreviewed for abuse of discretion, but it is per se an abuse of discretion to commit an \nerror of law, which is reviewed de novo. Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon, Inc. v. Alpha of \nVirginia, Inc., 43 F.3d 922, 939 (4th Cir. 1995). \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Acting Secretary’s Rescission of the Discretionary DACA \nEnforcement Policy Is Not Subject to Judicial Review. \nA.  The decision is not subject to APA review because it is \ncommitted to agency discretion by law. \n1.  The APA precludes review of agency actions that are “committed to agency \ndiscretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). This provision applies to various types of \nagency decisions that “traditionally” have been regarded as unsuitable for judicial \nreview, Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993), including the decision whether or not \n16 \n \n\nto institute enforcement actions, Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. Such decisions are similar in \nsignificant ways to a prosecutor’s decision whether or not to indict—“a decision \nwhich has long been regarded as the special province of the Executive Branch.” Id. at \n832; United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (“[T]he decision whether or not \nto prosecute . . . generally rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s] discretion.” (emphasis \nadded)). Such discretionary enforcement actions “cannot be the subject of judicial \nreview” even when an agency (or a prosecutor) bases them on what would be “a \n‘reviewable’ reason” in another context. BLE, 482 U.S. at 283. \nThe Acting Secretary’s decision to discontinue a prior non-enforcement policy \nfalls well within the types of enforcement decisions that traditionally have been \nunderstood as “committed to agency discretion.” Like the decision to adopt a policy \nof selective non-enforcement, the decision whether to retain such a policy can \n“involve[] a complicated balancing” of factors that are “peculiarly within [the \nagency’s] expertise,” including determining how the agency’s resources are best spent \nand how the non-enforcement policy fits with the agency’s overall policies. Chaney, \n470 U.S. at 831. Likewise, a decision to abandon an existing non-enforcement policy \nwill not, in itself, affect “an individual’s liberty or property rights, and thus does not \ninfringe upon areas that courts often are called upon to protect.” Id. at 832. Indeed, an \nagency’s decision to reverse a prior policy of civil non-enforcement is akin to changes \nin policy as to criminal prosecutorial discretion, which regularly occur within the \nDepartment of Justice both during and across presidential administrations, and which, \n17 \n \n\nas noted, are generally not amenable to judicial review. Judicial review is available if a \ndecision to enforce results in an adverse final determination that deprives an \nindividual of liberty or property, but that review is limited to the substance of the final \ndetermination; an individual cannot escape guilt of the criminal or civil offense by \nbringing an APA challenge to an agency’s discretionary decision to enforce the law.    \nThis presumption of non-reviewability applies with particular force in the \ncontext of immigration enforcement discretion. In general, the “broad discretion \nexercised by immigration officials” has become a “principal feature of the removal \nsystem.” Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396; see also, e.g., 6 U.S.C. § 202(5) (vesting authority in \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to “[e]stablish[] national immigration enforcement \npolicies and priorities”). And more specifically, a suit challenging a discretionary \ndecision to enforce the immigration laws would entail the extraordinary relief of \nordering the government to allow a “continuing violation of United States law.” \nAADC, 525 U.S. at 490. The revocation of a prior immigration non-enforcement \npolicy is thus plainly a decision that is “committed to agency discretion by law,” 5 \nU.S.C. § 701(a)(2), and not subject to attack under the APA. \n2.  The district court did not engage with any of this precedent. Instead, the \ncourt held that “[p]laintiffs’ APA claims are justiciable because they relate to the \nprocedures followed by DHS—not to the substance of its policy” and a court “may review \nwhether the repeal of DACA followed the correct APA procedures.” JA 1501. Even \non its own terms, this reasoning overlooks that plaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious \n18 \n \n\nclaim is substantive, not procedural. See, e.g., National Ass’n of Home Builders v. EPA, 682 \nF.3d 1032, 1042 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (distinguishing “the APA’s procedural dictates” \nfrom “its substantive command that agency decisionmaking not be ‘arbitrary’ or \n‘capricious’”). The district court then declared it “important to note” that the Acting \nSecretary had rescinded DACA based on her “belief that the program was unlawful \nand would face lengthy legal challenges.” JA.1501. To the extent that the court found \nplaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious claim justiciable on that basis, it further erred.   \nIn BLE, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the proposition that “if the \nagency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action, the action \nbecomes reviewable.” 482 U.S. at 283. By way of example, the Court observed that “a \ncommon reason for failure to prosecute an alleged criminal violation is the \nprosecutor’s belief (sometimes publicly stated) that the law will not sustain a \nconviction,” yet “it is entirely clear that the refusal to prosecute cannot be the subject \nof judicial review” notwithstanding that the prosecutor’s belief “is surely an eminently \n‘reviewable’ proposition.” Id. Thus, after BLE, a court cannot justify judicial review of \nan agency’s discretionary enforcement decision (an “otherwise unreviewable action”) \nsimply on the ground that the decision was based on a general interpretation of law. \nSee Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 675-76 (D.C. Cir. 1994) \n(explaining that BLE settles the question whether “Chaney’s presumption of non-\nreviewability is inapplicable when the agency bases its refusal to enforce in an \nindividual case solely on a legal interpretation without explicitly relying on its \n19 \n \n\nenforcement discretion”). A legal rationale cannot provide a hook to support review \nof the underlying enforcement decision. \nIn some circumstances, though, the legal rationale can be reviewable on its own, \nfor example when an agency provides a definitive interpretation of a statute’s \nsubstantive command in the course of announcing a general policy. See Crowley, 37 \nF.3d at 677 (explaining that there was no substantive interpretation in the single-shot \nenforcement action at issue, but that a reviewable embedded interpretation might be \n“more likely” to exist in a general enforcement policy). This distinction between the \nunreviewability of an enforcement decision and the possible reviewability of its legal \nrationale is well illustrated by UAW v. Brock, 783 F.2d 237 (D.C. Cir. 1986). In Brock, \nthe D.C. Circuit explained that “there is no review available from [an] agency’s \nspecific nonenforcement decision . . . or its overall pattern of decisions not to pursue \nenforcement action in these areas.” Id. at 245; see also id. (“If the Union had challenged \nonly the Department’s decision not to take enforcement action against [certain \nentities], or even against this entire genus of practices, our task would be completed.” \n(emphasis added)). But the court went on to hold that “when a legal challenge focuses \non an announcement of a substantive statutory interpretation,” judicial review is \navailable. Id.  \nThese cases demonstrate (1) where an enforcement decision is otherwise \nunreviewable, a court may not use the fact that the decision rests on a general legal \nrationale as a hook to permit judicial review of the underlying enforcement decision; \n20 \n \n\nand (2) where an unreviewable enforcement decision rests on a general legal \ninterpretation of the statute’s substantive commands, a court may in certain situations \n“carve out” that embedded interpretive rule for review and vacatur (assuming that \nother prerequisites to judicial review are met), but it may not set aside the underlying \nenforcement decision.  \nApplying these principles, plaintiffs’ substantive APA claim is not subject to \njudicial review. Even assuming arguendo that the sole rationale for the Acting \nSecretary’s decision was that DACA is unlawful, that legal rationale could not be used \nas a hook to review the otherwise unreviewable enforcement decision to rescind \nDACA. As explained, such review is directly contrary to BLE. Nor would review of \nthe legal rationale alone, as an interpretive rule embedded in the underlying \nenforcement policy decision, justify setting aside the rescission of DACA itself. Any \nembedded legal interpretation here would concern, at most, the scope of the Acting \nSecretary’s enforcement discretion. But that interpretation does not govern the \nbehavior of the parties—no one disputes that DACA recipients are removable under \nthe statute. Indeed, the decision at issue here rests on enforcement discretion all the \nway down.  \n3. Plaintiffs did not address this aspect of the district court’s ruling in their \nopening brief on appeal, but they did advance several arguments below in support of \ntheir position that their substantive APA claim is justiciable. None has merit. \n21 \n \n\nFirst, plaintiffs suggested that “the relevant substantive law that the government \ncited as the basis for the rescission” provided “judicially manageable standards by \nwhich a court can evaluate Plaintiffs’ APA claims.” JA.482. As explained above, it is \nboth well established and common sense that an agency’s discretionary decision \nwhether to enforce a law is not made reviewable because it is based on an \nunderstanding of governing law. See supra pp. 18-21.     \nRather, for an enforcement decision to be reviewable, the “law to apply” must \ndepart from tradition by “circumscrib[ing] agency enforcement discretion” and \n“provid[ing] meaningful standards for defining the limits of that discretion.” Chaney, \n470 U.S. at 834. Such limits might be found in the statute that provides the agency \nwith enforcement discretion, if Congress has set “substantive priorities” or otherwise \nlimited “an agency’s power to discriminate among issues or cases it will pursue.” Id. at \n833; see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 168 (5th Cir. 2015) (holding that court \ncould review whether DAPA ran afoul of alleged INA constraints on enforcement \ndiscretion). But neither plaintiffs nor the district court have identified anything in the \nINA that limited DHS’s discretion in rescinding DACA.1   \n                                                 \n1 Constitutional constraints on enforcement discretion also are traditionally \nreviewable and provide meaningful standards to apply. See Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. \n592, 603-04 (1988). Review of plaintiffs’ constitutional claims is therefore not \nprecluded by § 701(a)(2), although those claims are separately barred here by 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g) and are meritless in any event. See infra Part II.C . \n22 \n \n\nSecond, plaintiffs argued that Chaney’s presumption does not apply because that \ncase is “based on the recognition that courts are not well placed to second-guess an \nagency’s balancing of . . . factors which are particularly in within its expertise,” and \n“the Government has not engaged in any ‘balancing’ of individualized factors.” \nJA.484-85; see also JA.482-83. But this argument merely repackages the analysis \nforeclosed by BLE and Chaney. Where a discretionary enforcement decision is \ntraditionally unreviewable because there is no statutory or regulatory constraint on the \nexercise of that discretion, a court may not review the agency’s decision regardless of \nwhat factors the agency chooses to consider in making that decision, including even if \nthe agency believes for legal reasons that it lacks any discretion at all. Notably, Chaney \nidentified the balancing of discretionary factors as only one of “many” reasons for the \n“general unsuitability for judicial review” of agency enforcement decisions, and \nemphasized as well that enforcement decisions have “long been regarded as the \nspecial province of the Executive Branch.” 470 U.S. at 831-32. \nIndeed, this argument is in significant tension with the facts of Chaney itself. \nThe FDA’s decision not to take enforcement actions with respect to lethal injection \ndrugs relied on both enforcement discretion policy and a perceived lack of \njurisdiction. 470 U.S. at 824. The Supreme Court did not call into question the nature \nof the agency’s policy decision despite the agency’s alternative conclusion. And, in any \nevent, the DACA rescission did involve discretionary balancing, because it rested in \npart on enforcement-discretion concerns about legality and litigation risk.  \n23 \n \n\nThird, plaintiffs argued that the DACA rescission is reviewable because it is “a \nbroad agency enforcement policy.” JA.483. This argument is also inconsistent with the \nfacts of Chaney. The non-enforcement decision in that case was not an individualized \ndecision by the FDA to forgo enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \nAct against a single alleged violator. Rather, the plaintiffs in Chaney requested the FDA \nto enforce the statute’s misbranding prohibition against the use of certain drugs for \ncapital punishment, by taking “various investigatory and enforcement actions” against \n“drug manufacturers,” “prison administrators,” and “all [others] in the chain of \ndistribution”; the FDA, however, categorically concluded that its enforcement discretion \n“should not be exercised to interfere with this particular aspect of state criminal \njustice systems.” 470 U.S. at 824-25. In short, the question under Section 701(a)(2) is \nwhether the type of agency decision at issue is inherently discretionary in nature, not \nthe number of people to whom it applies. \nCommon sense would dictate this conclusion even if it were not already settled \nlaw. Individual enforcement decisions are regularly informed by general \ninterpretations of the agency’s substantive statute to determine “whether a violation \nhas occurred.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831; see BLE, 482 U.S. at 283 (“[A] common reason \nfor failure to prosecute an alleged criminal violation is the prosecutor’s belief \n(sometimes publicly stated) that the law will not sustain a conviction.”). Similarly, \nagency decisions about how its “resources are best spent” or how certain \nenforcement activity “best fits the agency’s overall policies,” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831, \n24 \n \n\nare at least as susceptible to implementation through broad guidance as through case-\nby-case enforcement decisions. See, e.g., Alaska Fish & Wildlife Federation & Outdoor \nCouncil, Inc. v. Dunkle, 829 F.2d 933, 935, 938 (9th Cir. 1987) (holding unreviewable “a \nwritten policy stating that subsistence hunting in Alaska during the closed season \nwould not be punished” because “traditional methods of enforcing game laws are not \neffective in the vast reaches of rural Alaska”).2  \nFourth, plaintiffs argue that the Acting Secretary’s decision was reviewable \nbecause, rather than adopting a non-enforcement policy, it rescinded one. Their \nsuggestion that the Chaney presumption applies only to “attempt[s] to obtain judicial \nreview of an agency decision not to act,” JA.485, is foreclosed by this Court’s decision \nin Speed Mining, Inc. v. Federal Mine Safety & Health Review Commission, 528 F.3d 310 (4th \nCir. 2008). In that case, the owner-operator of a coal mine contended that the \nSecretary of Labor abused her discretion in issuing citations for safety violations. The \nCourt held that the decision was unreviewable, explaining that an “agency’s exercise \nof its enforcement discretion,” even when that discretion is exercised to enforce the law, \nis “an area in which the courts have traditionally been most reluctant to interfere.” Id. \nat 318. \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiffs below cited Kenney v. Glickman, 96 F.3d 1118, 1124 (8th Cir. 1996), \nbut that case involved “policy decisions based on the [agency’s] interpretation” of the \nsubstantive commands of a statute, not the scope of its enforcement discretion. \n25 \n \n\nFifth, plaintiffs further suggested that the Acting Secretary’s “affirmative . . . \naction rescinding protected interests that have been granted to Dreamers provid[es] a \nclear focus for judicial review.” JA.486. But the premise of this argument—that DHS \nmade a commitment to certain persons unlawfully in the country—is incorrect. \nIndeed, DHS made explicit when it adopted the DACA non-enforcement policy that \n“[t]his memorandum confers no substantive right.” JA.131.3  \nMore fundamentally, any reliance interests would not justify judicial review of \notherwise-non-reviewable acts of discretion. In Lincoln, for example, the Indian Health \nService had operated its regional program for seven years, providing important \nmedical treatment to disabled children on which the recipients had undoubtedly come \nto rely. See 508 U.S. at 185-88. Notwithstanding that reliance, the Supreme Court held \nthat the Service’s discretionary decision to discontinue the program by reallocating a \nlump-sum appropriation was non-reviewable. Id. at 193-94.   \nNor does the availability of review turn on the significance of a plaintiff’s \nasserted interest in an agency’s discretionary enforcement decision. The Supreme \nCourt made this clear in Chaney, where plaintiffs offered “evidence that use of the \ndrugs [that FDA declined to regulate] could lead to a cruel and protracted death.” 470 \n                                                 \n3 Robbins v. Regan, 780 F.2d 37, 47 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam), which involved \na “rescission of commitments,” is therefore inapposite. That case also did not involve \nan exercise of enforcement discretion—the challenged agency action was the alleged \nrefusal to provide previously agreed upon funding for renovations of a homeless \nshelter. \n26 \n \n\nU.S. at 827. Holding that it could not properly review the agency’s decision, the \nSupreme Court emphasized that “[t]he fact that the drugs involved in this case are \nultimately to be used in imposing the death penalty must not lead this Court or other \ncourts to import profound differences of opinion over the meaning of the Eighth \nAmendment . . . into the domain of administrative law.” Id. at 838.   \nIn sum, none of plaintiffs’ reasons, individually or collectively, justify applying \nAPA review to the Acting Secretary’s discretionary decision to rescind the DACA \nnon-enforcement policy. And it warrants emphasis that those reasons, if accepted by \nthis Court, would lead to a radical and untenable intrusion on agencies’ enforcement \ndiscretion. Consider the following example of a quintessential exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion: one chief prosecutor adopts a general policy of not enforcing \ndrug laws against low-level, non-violent offenders because she views them as victims \nof circumstance who should receive treatment and support; but her successor then \nrescinds that non-enforcement policy based on her legal concerns that the policy \nwould violate her duty to faithfully execute the laws and provide equal treatment to \ndefendants. The district court’s analysis in this case would allow drug offenders in that \ncircumstance, who are concededly guilty, to nevertheless seek judicial review of the \nlegal reasoning underlying the second prosecutor’s discretionary decision to enforce \nthe drug laws in a different manner than her predecessor. That is not, and cannot \npossibly be, the law. \n27 \n \n\nB.  8 U.S.C. § 1252 bars pre-enforcement review of plaintiffs’ \nclaims. \n1. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252, judicial review of DHS enforcement decisions is \ngenerally available, if at all, only through the procedures for reviewing removal orders \nset forth in that section. As relevant here, section 1252(g) states that “[e]xcept as \nprovided in this section . . . no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim \nby or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the [Secretary] to \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien \nunder this subchapter.” As the Supreme Court explained in AADC, section 1252(g) \nis “designed to give some measure of protection to ‘no deferred action’ decisions and \nsimilar discretionary determinations, providing that if they are reviewable at all, they at \nleast will not be made the bases for separate rounds of judicial intervention outside \nthe streamlined process that Congress has designed.” See 525 U.S. at 485 & n.9.   \nThe Acting Secretary’s rescission of DACA is such a “‘no deferred action’ \ndecision[],” AADC, 525 U.S. at 485, and is an initial “action” in the agency’s \n“commence[ment] [of ] proceedings” against aliens who are unlawfully in the country, \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Thus, even assuming that the DACA rescission were reviewable, it \nwould be reviewable only as otherwise “provided in [Section 1252],” id.—that is, \nthrough “[ j]udicial review of a final order of removal,” id. § 1252(a)(1). See, e.g., \nVasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898, 901 (3d Cir. 2016); Botezatu v. INS, 195 F.3d 311, \n314 (7th Cir. 1999). That review of a final order of removal is the sole avenue for \n28 \n \n\njudicial review is underscored by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9), which channels into the review \nof final removal orders all questions of law or fact arising from any action taken to \nremove an alien. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 483 (characterizing section 1252(b)(9) as an \n“unmistakable ‘zipper’ clause”); see also Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, \n207 (1994).  \nThe limitation on review here is consistent with the review procedures for \nother kinds of discretionary DHS actions. For example, under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B), “no court shall have jurisdiction to review” judgments regarding the \ngrant or denial of specified forms of discretionary relief—including cancellation of \nremoval, voluntary departure, certain waivers of inadmissibility, and adjustment of \nstatus. See id. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, \n1255). Congress provided a limited exception to that jurisdictional bar for “review of \nconstitutional claims or questions of law,” id. § 1252(a)(2)(D), but it mandated that \nany such review occur only “upon a petition for review [of a final order of removal] \nfiled with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section,” id.; see, e.g., \nGreen v. Napolitano, 627 F.3d 1341, 1347 (10th Cir. 2010).  \n2. The district court failed to grapple with the government’s argument that \nreview here is barred by the INA, stating only that “the notion that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) \nprecludes judicial review has been rejected repeatedly” and citing AADC. JA.1501.  \nBut AADC supports the government’s position in this case. As explained, in \nAADC, the Supreme Court recognized the INA is “designed to give some measure \n29 \n \n\nof protection to ‘no deferred action’ decisions and similar discretionary \ndeterminations, providing that if they are reviewable at all, they at least will not be \nmade the bases for separate rounds of judicial intervention outside the streamlined \nprocess that Congress has designed.” See 525 U.S. at 485 & n.9. The INA affords such \nprotection by channeling legal challenges to such decisions into review of final \nremoval orders, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) and 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9). Plaintiffs \ncannot frustrate the INA’s reticulated review scheme by filing suit before the agency \nhas officially initiated an enforcement proceeding. \nThe Supreme Court’s recent decision in Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 \n(2018), does not counsel a different result. The plurality opinion described AADC as \nhaving interpreted section 1252(g) not “to sweep in any claim that can technically be \nsaid to ‘arise from’ the three listed actions of the Attorney General,” but rather “to \nrefer to just those three specific actions themselves.” Id. at 841. But the opinion \nmerely emphasized that the plaintiffs there fell outside of AADC ’s interpretation of \nsection 1252(g) because they were challenging the conditions and length of detention \nancillary to the removal process—in other words, “[they were] not asking for review \nof an order of removal; they [were] not challenging the decision to detain them in the \nfirst place or to seek removal; and they [were] not even challenging any part of the \nprocess by which their removability will be determined.” Id. Here, by contrast, the \nlegal questions at issue arise from a challenge to an ingredient to commencement of \n30 \n \n\nremoval—the rescission of deferred-action forbearance from removal—and review is \ntherefore barred under section 1252(g) and AADC. Id. at 841 n.3.  \nIf anything, Jennings underscores the fact that section 1252(b)(9), which \nchannels all legal and factual questions “arising from any action taken or proceeding \nbrought to remove an alien” into final removal orders, also bars plaintiffs’ claims. \nUnder both the plurality’s and concurrence’s interpretation of section 1252(b)(9), see \n138 S. Ct. at 839-41 (plurality op.); id. at 852-53 (Thomas, J., concurring in the \njudgment), plaintiffs’ claims in this case “aris[e] from” an “action taken” in the \nremoval process.  \nII.  The District Court Correctly Held That the Rescission of DACA \nWas Lawful. \nA.  The district court correctly held that the DACA rescission \nwas not arbitrary and capricious. \nEven if the Acting Secretary’s decision were reviewable under the APA, it was \nplainly not “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). As the district court correctly emphasized \nin so holding, JA.1505, the APA standard of review is “narrow,” Motor Vehicles Mfrs. \nAss’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983): “[A] court is not to \nsubstitute its judgment” for the agency’s reasonable judgment, id., and should “uphold \na decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned,” \nBowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974).  \n31 \n \n\n1.  The district court correctly concluded that it was not \narbitrary and capricious to rescind DACA because it \nwas subject to serious legal challenge. \na. It is uncontroverted that nothing in the INA requires any aspect of the \nDACA policy. Plaintiffs’ claim, instead, is that once an agency has adopted a purely \ndiscretionary non-enforcement policy, it must provide a robust explanation for a \ndecision to pursue a different enforcement policy. Unsurprisingly, plaintiffs have not \nidentified any authority for this proposition. Nor can they seriously dispute the district \ncourt’s conclusion that it was reasonable for the Secretary to act based on the \nsignificant legal risks presented by maintaining a policy (original DACA) that was \nmaterially indistinguishable to ones (expanded DACA and DAPA) that had been \nenjoined nationwide by the Fifth Circuit in a decision affirmed by an equally divided \nSupreme Court. This is especially so in the face of a threat by Texas and other States \nto challenge DACA on the same grounds. As the district court explained, “[r]egardless \nof whether DACA is, in fact, lawful or unlawful, the belief that it was unlawful and \nsubject to serious legal challenge is completely rational.” JA.1506. “DAPA—an \nanalogous program, promulgated by analogous means,” the court explained “had been \ndefeated less than a year prior” and “[t]he same plaintiffs who defeated DAPA \nthreatened to challenge DACA imminently.” Id. “[I]nstead of the chaotic possibility of \nan immediate termination,” the Acting Secretary “opted for a six-month wind-down \nperiod.” Id.  \n32 \n \n\nThe district court was correct. In Texas v. United States, the Fifth Circuit had \nconcluded that DAPA and expanded DACA were unlawful on both procedural and \nsubstantive grounds. 809 F.3d at 178; see id. at 147 n.11 (including the “DACA \nexpansions” within the opinion’s references to “DAPA”). The entirety of the Fifth \nCircuit’s reasoning applies equally to the original DACA policy.   \nWith respect to procedure, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the memorandum \nexpanding DACA and creating DAPA was not exempt from notice and comment as a \nstatement of policy because of how the original DACA policy had been implemented. \nTexas, 809 F.3d. at 171-78. The court found that, “[a]lthough the DAPA Memo \nfacially purports to confer discretion,” in fact it would operate as a binding statement \nof eligibility for deferred action because that is how the original DACA policy had \nbeen implemented. Id. at 171, 174 n.139.   \nWith respect to substance, the Fifth Circuit held that DAPA and expanded \nDACA were contrary to the INA because (1) “[i]n specific and detailed provisions,” \nthe INA already “confers eligibility for ‘discretionary relief,’ ” including “narrow \nclasses of aliens eligible for deferred action,” Texas, 809 F.3d at 179; (2) the INA’s \notherwise “broad grants of authority” could not reasonably be construed to assign to \nthe Secretary the authority to create additional categories of aliens of “vast ‘economic \nand political significance,’ ” id. at 182-83; (3) DAPA and expanded DACA were \ninconsistent with historical deferred-action policies because they neither were \n33 \n \n\nundertaken on a “country-specific basis . . . in response to war, civil unrest, or natural \ndisasters,” nor served as a “bridge[] from one legal status to another,” id. at 184; and \n(4) “Congress ha[d] repeatedly declined to enact the Development, Relief, and \nEducation for Alien Minors Act (‘DREAM Act’), features of which closely resemble \nDACA and DAPA,” id. at 185 (footnote omitted). Every one of those factors likewise \napplies to the original DACA policy. \nb. Plaintiffs posit various reasons they believe distinguish DACA from DAPA \nand expanded DACA, and fault the Acting Secretary for failing to expressly address \nthem. Pl. Br. 30. But plaintiffs provide no authority (because none exists) for the \nproposition that the APA required the Acting Secretary to provide the equivalent of a \nbench memo setting out the subsidiary legal arguments to be made by each side in the \ncourse of protracted litigation, with an accompanying evaluation of the likelihood of \nsuccess in various district courts, the courts of appeals, and the Supreme Court. \nIndeed, as this Court has explained, an agency “explanation need not be a ‘model of \nanalytic precision’” to satisfy the APA’s requirements. Downey v. U.S. Dep’t of Army, \n685 F. App’x 184, 190 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Inova Alexandria Hosp. v. Shalala, 244 \nF.3d 342, 350 (4th Cir. 2001)); see also Bowman, 419 U.S. at 286 (rationale need only be \nreasonably discernable). So long as the ultimate litigation judgment was reasonable, \nthe Acting Secretary’s decision is not arbitrary and capricious. All of plaintiffs’ \narguments to the contrary fail. \n34 \n \n\nFirst, plaintiffs urge that DAPA might have been more vulnerable to challenge \nbecause “unlike DAPA, DACA has no analogue in the INA.” Pl. Br. 32 (quoting \nNAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d. 239). The basis of the Fifth Circuit’s Texas decision was \nnot, however, the existence of a particular statutory pathway to lawful presence, but \nrather the “specific and intricate provisions” of the INA as a whole addressing \ndiscretionary relief (which, of course, no more include DACA recipients than DAPA \nrecipients). 809 F.3d at 186. Indeed, a pathway to lawful presence could not have been \ndecisive to the Fifth Circuit’s rationale, because, as that court itself noted, some DAPA \nrecipients (i.e., the parents of lawful permanent residents) had no such pathway to \ncitizenship, id. at 179-80, and neither did expanded DACA recipients (who differed \nfrom DACA recipients only with respect to age and length of residence). Given all \nthis, plaintiffs’ proposed distinction is entirely backward. If anything, the fact that \nCongress had legislated only for certain individuals similarly situated to DAPA \nrecipients—and not DACA recipients—would make DACA more inconsistent with \nthe INA. \nSecond, plaintiffs contend that the district erred in failing to consider whether a \ndefense like laches might apply to a suit seeking to enjoin DACA. Pl. Br. 32. But \nlaches requires a showing of prejudice, Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 155 \n(1967), and plaintiffs do not explain how the government (or, indeed, anyone else) \nwas prejudiced by Texas’s failure to bring suit earlier, which simply would have caused \nDACA to end sooner. \n35 \n \n\nThird, plaintiffs contend that the Acting Secretary failed to consider the \n“injunction prerequisites, such as how any plaintiff challenging DACA could claim \nimmediate or irreparable harm.” Pl. Br. 33. This argument ignores the fact that the \nFifth Circuit already affirmed the DAPA injunction, and, as explained, there are no \nmaterial differences between the two policies.  \nFourth, plaintiffs cannot undermine the reasonableness of the Acting Secretary’s \ndecision by arguing that the Attorney General erroneously stated that the Fifth Circuit \nhad found “constitutional” defects in DAPA and expanded DACA. Pl. Br. 31. The \nActing Secretary made her decision after “[t]aking into consideration” the Attorney \nGeneral’s letter and the Fifth Circuit’s ruling, but nothing in her memorandum \nsuggests that she misunderstood the nature of that ruling, which she herself described \nin purely statutory terms. JA.383. Moreover, even the Attorney General’s letter in its \nentirety should not be read to attribute “constitutional” holdings to the Texas courts, \nbut rather to invoke the “legal grounds” the courts adopted in support of his own \nview that DACA was “unconstitutional.” JA.379. In any event, any error in attributing \na finding of unconstitutionality to the Texas courts was plainly harmless because the \nAttorney General did not rescind DACA. Rather, the Acting Secretary did, and it is \nclear from her memorandum that her decision did not depend in any way on whether \nDACA was unconstitutional, rather than “merely” contrary to statute and likely to be \nenjoined regardless.   \n36 \n \n\nFifth, plaintiffs err in contending that Organized Village of Kake v. USDA, 795 \nF.3d 956 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc), held that reliance on litigation risk renders agency \naction arbitrary and capricious. Pl. Br. 31. Kake held no such thing. There, USDA \ninitially had determined not to exempt a particular forest from a rule prohibiting roads \nin certain areas of national parks, but then reversed course two years later on the \nidentical factual record. Kake, 795 F.3d at 959. As a tertiary rationale for its changed \nposition, USDA suggested that granting the exemption would “reduce[ ] the potential \nfor conflicts” in light of “litigation over the last two years” concerning its rule. Id. at \n970. The Ninth Circuit rejected that rationale because the “other lawsuits involved \nforests other than the [one exempted],” and thus it was “impossible to discern how \n[the] exemption . . . would affect them,” and USDA “[a]t most . . . [had] deliberately \ntraded one lawsuit for another.” Id. Kake is thus entirely inapposite. It involved the \nscope of a substantive rule rather than a purely discretionary enforcement policy, and \nit involved speculative litigation benefits rather than the significant litigation benefit of \nmooting a near-certain injunction. In short, the government’s position here is not that \nit may “trade[ ] one lawsuit for another,” but instead that it may choose an orderly \nwind-down of a purely discretionary non-enforcement policy rather than litigate to the \nbitter end in the face of adverse precedent.   \nc. Nor is there any basis to reject the Acting Secretary’s litigation-risk concern \nas a “post hoc rationalization.” The memorandum focuses from beginning to end \nprincipally on litigation concerns, not the legality of DACA per se. The memorandum \n37 \n \n\nrecounted in significant detail the litigation surrounding the DAPA and expanded \nDACA policies. JA.381-82. It noted that the agency’s prior June 2017 decision to \ndiscontinue DAPA and expanded DACA was made after “considering the \n[government’s] likelihood of success on the merits of th[at] ongoing litigation.” \nJA.382. It described the subsequent letter from Texas and other States to the Attorney \nGeneral notifying him of those States’ intention to amend the existing lawsuit to \nchallenge the original DACA policy. Id. It quoted the Attorney General’s qualified \nstatement that “it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar \nresults with respect to DACA.” Id. (emphasis added). And it concluded that, in light \nof the foregoing, and “[i]n the exercise of [her] authority in establishing national \nimmigration policies and priorities” under 6 U.S.C. § 202(5), the Acting Secretary had \ndecided merely that the DACA policy “should” be terminated and wound down in \n“an efficient and orderly fashion,” not that it “must” be.  \nThe Nielsen Memo reaffirms this understanding of the Texas litigation and the \nrisk it posed. It spells out why “[a]ny arguable distinctions between the DAPA and \nDACA policies” were not “sufficiently material” to resolve the agency’s doubts over \nDACA’s legality, and explains that, whether or not courts ultimately would uphold \nDACA, “[t]here are sound reasons for a law enforcement agency to avoid \ndiscretionary policies that are legally questionable.” Nielsen Memo 2. Indeed, \nregardless of whether the Duke Memo adequately explained this legal-doubt rationale, \n38 \n \n\nthe Nielsen Memo’s further explanation provides sufficient basis to affirm the district \ncourt’s rejection of plaintiffs’ challenge to DHS’s rescission of the DACA policy. \nd. In any event, Acting Secretary Duke’s decision is independently supported \nby her reasonable conclusion, informed by the Attorney General’s advice, that \nindefinitely continuing the DACA policy would itself have been unlawful. As detailed \nabove, the Fifth Circuit had already concluded that DAPA and expanded DACA were \nprocedurally and substantively invalid, in a decision that four Justices of the Supreme \nCourt voted to affirm. See supra pp.33-34. The Attorney General expressed his \nagreement with the conclusion reached by the Fifth Circuit in a decision that applies \nequally to the original DACA policy. See JA.379 (concluding that DACA was \n“effectuated . . . without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, \nafter Congress’ repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have \naccomplished a similar result”). The Acting Secretary’s decision to rescind the purely \ndiscretionary DACA non-enforcement policy on the basis of the Fifth Circuit’s \ndecision, the Supreme Court’s equally divided affirmance, and the Attorney General’s \nopinion was not the type of “clear error of judgment,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, that \nwould make it arbitrary and capricious under the APA. As the district court put it, \n“[H]ow could trying to avoid unlawful action possibly be arbitrary and capricious?” \nJA.1506. \n39 \n \n\n2.   Plaintiffs’ additional arguments that the rescission \nmemorandum was arbitrary and capricious are \nmeritless. \na. Plaintiffs are equally mistaken in arguing that the Acting Secretary’s decision \nwas arbitrary and capricious in failing to consider the reliance interests at stake. Pl. Br. \n27-29. Because of the nature of the decision to rescind DACA, reliance interests are \nnot a sufficiently “important aspect” of the question to require express consideration. \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. On its face, DACA confers no legitimate reliance interests. \nDACA made deferred action available for only two-year periods, which could “be \nterminated at any time” at the agency’s discretion. JA.1013. When he announced \nDACA in 2012, President Obama explained that it was a “temporary stopgap \nmeasure,” not a “permanent fix.” Remarks by the President on Immigration (June 15, 2012), \nhttps://go.usa.gov/xnZFY. And he urged Congress to act “because these kids \ndeserve to plan their lives in more than two-year increments.” Id. A purely \ndiscretionary policy that can be revoked at any time cannot create legally cognizable \nreliance interests—and certainly not beyond the stated duration (generally two years) \nof existing deferred-action grants, which the Acting Secretary left untouched. Nothing \nin the INA prevents the Secretary of Homeland Security from changing her “national \nimmigration enforcement policies and priorities.” 6 U.S.C. § 202(5). And any reliance \nwas even less justified, of course, to the extent that DACA was unlawful. \nAt a minimum, the asserted reliance interests plainly failed to overcome the \nsubstantial change in circumstances resulting from the Supreme Court’s affirmance of \n40 \n \n\nthe Fifth Circuit’s decision, which significantly increased the risk that DACA would \nbe enjoined nationwide and thus drastically reduced the degree to which DACA \nrecipients could rely on the continuation of what was already a purely discretionary \nnon-enforcement policy. Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117 (2016), \nupon which plaintiffs rely, is entirely inapposite. That case involved the Department \nof Labor’s interpretation of whether automotive service advisors were covered by a \nstatutory exemption from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. \nUnlike the policy at issue here, the one in Encino Motorcars concerned private parties’ \nsubstantive statutory rights, had been in place for thirty-three years, and was not \nsubject to a significant risk of imminent judicial invalidation. Id. at 2126-27. The \nrelevant industry stakeholders had therefore developed a strong and justified reliance \ninterest that necessitated consideration under the APA.  \nIn any event, the Acting Secretary’s decision suitably respected the interests of \nexisting DACA recipients. Based on her reasonable evaluation of the litigation risk \nposed by the imminent lawsuit against the DACA policy, the choice she faced was \nbetween a gradual, orderly, administrative wind-down of the policy, and the risk of an \nimmediate, disruptive, court-imposed one. Her decision to phase out the policy over a \ntwo-and-a-half-year period—permitting a period of additional renewals and \npermitting renewed and existing grants of deferred action to expire by their terms—\nwas, by far, the more humane choice. \nAgain, the Nielsen Memo underscores this conclusion. Although not required, \n41 \n \n\nSecretary Nielsen addressed whether any claimed reliance justified the continuation of \nthe DACA policy. As the Secretary explained, she is “keenly aware that DACA \nrecipients have availed themselves of the policy in continuing their presence in this \ncountry and pursuing their lives.” Nielsen Memo 3. “Nevertheless,” she concluded \nthat “in considering DHS enforcement policy” she “d[id] not believe that the asserted \nreliance interests outweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy” and the \nother discretionary enforcement policy considerations that she articulated, especially \nin light of DACA’s temporary nature. Id. Instead, the Secretary determined that \n“issues of reliance would best be considered by Congress, which can assess and weigh \na range of options.” Id. Ultimately, “[i]n [her] judgment, neither any individual’s \nreliance on the expected continuation of the DACA policy nor the sympathetic \ncircumstances of DACA recipients as a class overcomes the legal and institutional \nconcerns with sanctioning the continued presence of hundreds of thousands of aliens \nwho are illegally present in violation of the laws passed by Congress.” Id. All that said, \nshe also emphasized that any reliance concerns were further mitigated by the \nimportant fact that Acting Secretary Duke’s “rescission of the DACA policy does not \npreclude the exercise of deferred action in individual cases if circumstances warrant.” \nId. \nb. Plaintiffs similarly err by arguing that the rescission memorandum is arbitrary \nand capricious because it does not “cite[] any facts or changed circumstances that \nsupported the change.” Pl. Br. 28. The Acting Secretary’s memorandum makes clear \n42 \n \n\nthat DHS changed its position because the Texas injunction against DAPA and \nexpanded DACA was affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court; the Attorney \nGeneral has disavowed the prior position; and Texas and other States were \nthreatening to challenge DACA. That is more than sufficient to satisfy the APA’s \nrequirement to acknowledge and explain a changed position. FCC v. Fox, 556 U.S. \n502, 514-15 (2009). \nc. Plaintiffs also miss the mark in speculating that “animus” motivated the \nrescission of DACA. Pl. Br. 29-30. Plaintiffs point to no evidence in the \nadministrative record, or anywhere else, to support their contention that Acting \nSecretary Duke acted with animus in rescinding the DACA policy. See also infra Part \nII.C.1 (explaining the correctness of district court’s rejection of plaintiffs’ equal \nprotection claims).  \n3.   The administrative record provided an adequate basis \non which to sustain the Acting Secretary’s decision. \nAs a final matter, plaintiffs err in asserting that the district court could not \nuphold the Acting Secretary’s decision based on the record before it. The district \ncourt correctly relied on the administrative record submitted by the agency and held \nthat it supported the agency’s decision. \nIn agency review cases, “[t]he APA specifically contemplates judicial review on \nthe basis of the agency record.” Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 \n(1985). In so doing, “[t]he focal point for judicial review should be the administrative \n43 \n \n\nrecord already in existence, not some new record made initially in the reviewing \ncourt.” Id. at 743-44. Rather than permit wide-ranging discovery, “the task of the \nreviewing court is to apply the appropriate APA standard of review to the agency \ndecision based on the record the agency presents to the reviewing court.” Id.. If the \nagency’s action “is not sustainable on the administrative record made,” then the \nadministrative “decision must be vacated and the matter remanded to [the agency] for \nfurther consideration.” Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 143 (1973) (per curiam). \nPlaintiffs argue both that the district court should have ordered the \ngovernment to “complete” the record and that the district court should have granted \ndiscovery in order to consider extra-record materials. Pl. Br. 20-23. Both arguments \nare in error.  \nFirst, the record was not incomplete. In formal administrative proceedings, the \nAPA provides that the “exclusive record for decision” consists of “[t]he transcript of \ntestimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding.” \n5 U.S.C. § 556(e). The administrative record is composed “exclusive[ly]” of the \nmaterials affirmatively admitted by the agency in the course of the proceeding. \nMaterials that are not “filed in the proceeding” pursuant to the agency’s own \nprocedures, such as internal agency documents memorializing the agency’s own \ndeliberations, are categorically outside the scope of the administrative record under \nsection 556(e)—just like deliberative materials in the Judicial Branch such as draft \nopinions, bench memoranda, and communications among judges are not part of the \n44 \n \n\nrecord in a case in court. See also 28 U.S.C. § 2112; Fed. R. App. P. 16 & note \n(imposing the same rule). Although the APA does not contain a parallel provision \nprescribing the scope of the administrative record for informal agency actions (such as \nthe statement of agency policy here), there is no reason why materials should be \ntreated any differently than when they are created in a formal proceeding. Indeed, the \nAPA’s lack of instruction and the informal character of the action give the agency \nmore, rather than less, latitude in deciding what is material to its decision and thus \nbelongs in the record. See Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 549 (1978) (court may “not stray beyond the judicial \nprovince . . . to impose upon the agency its own notion of which procedures are \n‘best’”).  \nIn arguing that the record here is incomplete, plaintiffs wholly ignore the nature \nof the decision at issue. It is common sense that “[w]hat will constitute an adequate \nrecord for meaningful review may vary with the nature of the administrative action to \nbe reviewed.” United States v. Nova Scotia Food Prods. Corp., 568 F.2d 240, 249 (2d Cir. \n1977). Here the challenged agency act is the formulation of a policy concerning \nprosecutorial discretion; the agency record permitted review of that policy (assuming \nreview were available at all). Because that discretionary enforcement decision did not \nrequire the development of any particular evidentiary basis and turned instead on legal \nand policy assessment, there is no risk that the government could try to insulate its \ndecisions by “withhold[ing] evidence unfavorable to its case.” Pl. Br. 22.  \n45 \n \n\nPlaintiffs further allege that the administrative record is facially suspect because \nit did not include documents from subordinates. Pl. Br. 21-22. In making this \nargument, plaintiffs disregard the “presumption of regularity” that attaches to the \nagency’s action in designating the record. Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F.2d 735, 740 \n(10th Cir. 1993). In any event, plaintiffs recognize that the reason it may be \nappropriate to include materials from subordinates is that an agency decisionmaker \nmay have based her decision on facts and evidence gathered and provided by \nsubordinates. Pl. Br. 21. But the fact that materials in the possession of subordinates \nmay, in certain circumstances, be indirectly considered by a decisionmaker does not mean \nthat the absence of such materials renders an administrative record suspect and \nsubject to “completion” in every case. The administrative record in this case included \nall non-deliberative materials considered by the Acting Secretary in reaching her \ndecision. \nIn arguing (incorrectly) that the administrative record was incomplete because \nit “contained no materials explaining prior decisions to maintain the DACA program \nor the Government’s departure from its prior view that DACA was legal,” plaintiffs \nreveal their goal to uncover the deliberative processes of the agency in reaching its \nconclusion. Pl. Br. 22. But deliberative materials have no place in an administrative \nrecord. “[A]gency officials should be judged by what they decided, not for matters \nthey considered before making up their minds.” National Sec. Archive v. CIA, 752 F.3d \n460, 462 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Indeed, deliberative materials are not merely protected \n46 \n \n\nfrom disclosure—they do not form part of the administrative record at all. See San \nLuis Obispo Mothers for Peace v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 789 F.2d 26, 44-45 (D.C. \nCir. 1986) (plurality opinion) (explaining that “[j]udicial examination of [internal \nagency] transcripts would represent an extraordinary intrusion into the realm of the \nagency,” and that the petitioners must make a “‘strong showing of bad faith or \nimproper behavior’” before the court would be “warranted in examining the \ndeliberative proceedings of the agency”); Comprehensive Cmty. Dev. Corp. v. Sebelius, 890 \nF. Supp. 2d 305, 312-13 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (“[C]ourts have consistently recognized that, \nfor the purpose of judicial review of agency action, deliberative materials antecedent \nto the agency’s decision fall outside the administrative record.”). \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on Dopico v. Goldschmidt, 687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982), is \nmisplaced. Pl. Br. 20. Plaintiffs there alleged that a federal agency had improperly \nfunded projects. But the state plans that were being funded—“the very basis for \nfederal decision-making” and documents that were required by regulation—were not \nincluded in the administrative record, thus creating a “strong suggestion that the \nrecord before the Court was not complete.” Dopico, 687 F.2d at 654. The agency \naction at issue here does not involve consideration of documents submitted to the \ngovernment from the outside, and plaintiffs have not identified a comparable \ndocument that is missing from the record. Rather, this case involves the formulation \nof a policy with respect to enforcement discretion, and plaintiffs have not identified \n47 \n \n\nany non-deliberative materials outside the administrative record relevant to that legal \npolicy decision that the Acting Secretary necessarily considered. \nSecond, plaintiffs are not entitled to extra-record evidence. The general rule is \nthat discovery is not appropriate in an APA suit absent a “strong showing of bad faith \nor improper behavior.” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 \n(1971); Air Transp. Ass’n of Am., Inc. v. National Mediation Board, 663 F.3d 476, 487 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011). Here the Acting Secretary explained the reasons for her action in a \nmemorandum that was both publicly released and included in the administrative \nrecord. If the administrative record were insufficient for review (which it was not, see \nsupra pp. 44-47), the proper remedy would be for the district court to remand the case \nto the agency, not to order discovery. Florida Power, 470 U.S. at 744.  \nIn their attempt to evade the general rule forbidding discovery in APA cases, \nplaintiffs attempt to demonstrate that agency officials acted in bad faith. In making \nthis argument, plaintiffs rely on statements made by “Government officials” that \npurportedly demonstrate racial animus and the reversal of the government’s previous \nsupport of the DACA policy. Pl. Br. 22-23. But neither of these grounds could \nsupport a finding of bad faith. First, plaintiffs have made no showing whatsoever that \nActing Secretary Duke, the decisionmaker here, acted on the basis of animus. See infra \nPart II.C.1 (explaining that the district court correctly rejected plaintiffs’ equal \nprotection claims). Second, the administrative record adequately explains the \ngovernment’s change in position. See supra p. 43. \n48 \n \n\nB.  The district court correctly held that the rescission of DACA \ndid not require notice-and-comment rulemaking. \n1. The APA generally requires that agencies give notice of proposed rules to \nthe public and provide interested persons with an opportunity to comment on the \nproposal. 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)-(c). These requirements do not apply, however, to \n“general statements of policy.” Id. § 553(b)(3)(A). Accordingly, the rescission of the \nDACA policy did not require notice-and-comment rulemaking, as the district court \ncorrectly recognized (joining all the other courts to have considered the issue). See \nJA.1504-05. \nA general statement of policy “advise[s] the public prospectively of the manner \nin which the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.” Lincoln, 508 U.S. at \n197 (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General’s Manual on the Administrative \nProcedure Act 30 n.3 (1947)). “[L]ike a press release,” a general statement of policy \n“encourages public dissemination of the agency’s policies prior to their actual \napplication in particular situations,” such as by announcing “the course which the \nagency intends to follow in future adjudications.” Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Federal \nPower Comm’n, 506 F.2d 33, 38 (D.C. Cir. 1974). Significantly, however, policy \nstatements “are binding on neither the public nor the agency,” and the agency “retains \nthe discretion and the authority to change its position . . . in any specific case.” Syncor \nInt’l Corp. v. Shalala, 127 F.3d 90, 94 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citations omitted).  \nBy contrast, “a substantive or legislative rule, pursuant to properly delegated \n49 \n \n\nauthority, has the force of law, and creates new law or imposes new rights or duties.” \nJerri’s Ceramic Arts, Inc. v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 874 F.2d 205, 207 (4th Cir. \n1989); see also Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 (1979); Perez v. Mortgage Bankers \nAss’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1203 (2015) (“Rules issued through the notice-and-comment \nprocess are often referred to as ‘legislative rules’ because they have the ‘force and \neffect of law.’”).  \nThe rescission memo was issued as an “exercise of [the Secretary’s] authority in \nestablishing national immigration policies and priorities,” JA.383, and explains how \nthe agency intends to exercise its enforcement authority on a prospective basis. The \ndecision “does not . . . create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, \nenforceable at law by any party,” JA.384, and does not affect anyone’s immigration \nstatus. As the district court explained, “[a]lthough a substantial paradigm shift, the \nDACA Rescission Memo neither curtails DHS’s discretion regarding individual \nimmigration reviews, nor does it prevent the agency from granting . . . deferred action \nstatus in the future.” JA.1505. It simply returns to the prior status quo, reflecting the \nbackground principle that deferred action is “an act of prosecutorial discretion” that \nmay be exercised “on an individualized case-by-case basis,” JA.381, and places “no \nlimitations” on the agency’s exercise of such “otherwise lawful enforcement . . . \nprerogatives,” JA.384. Nothing in the rescission memo evidences an intent to be \nbound.  \n2.  Plaintiffs contend that the DACA rescission is a substantive rule because it \n50 \n \n\nwithdrew officials’ discretion to grant deferred action under DACA. Pl. Br. 36-37. But \nthat cannot be the test, because a change in policy always withdraws discretion to act \nunder the repudiated policy. Setting aside that truism, the essence of plaintiffs’ \nargument is that they are less likely to receive deferred action based on a totality of the \ncircumstances inquiry than under the DACA policy’s guidelines. But a reduced \nlikelihood of relief does not transform a general statement of policy into a substantive \nrule. See Mada–Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1016 (9th Cir. 1987). \nThis Court’s decision in Chen Zhou Chai v. Carroll, 48 F.3d 1331, 1340-41 (4th \nCir. 1995), relied on by plaintiffs, only underscores the correctness of the district \ncourt’s holding. Contrary to plaintiffs’ contention, this Court in Chen Zhou Chai did \nnot hold that a general statement of policy is required to undergo notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking if it “substantively impacts” individuals. Pl. Br. 38. Indeed, the \nCourt held that an interim asylum policy was a general statement of policy, 48 F.3d at \n1341 (citing Mada–Luna, 813 F.2d at 1015), even though it undoubtedly substantively \nimpacted a number of individuals and the likelihood of their being granted asylum.  \nIf the Acting Secretary’s memorandum requiring a return to fully individualized \ndiscretion for deferred action is a substantive rule, then a fortiori the restriction on \ndiscretion imposed by DACA itself was a substantive rule, as the Fifth Circuit held. \nTexas, 809 F.3d at 171-78. And that provides an independent and sufficient basis to \nreject the plaintiffs’ claim. See Chen Zhou Chai, 48 F.3d at 1341 n.8. It would offend \nboth law and equity for this Court to set aside the DACA rescission for failure to \n51 \n \n\nfollow notice-and-comment procedures when that rationale necessarily implies that \nDACA itself was invalid for the same reason. Not only would such a ruling effectively \norder the maintenance of an illegally enacted legislative rule, but any relief it provides \nwould necessarily be short-lived, as such a decision would create binding precedent \nunder which opponents of DACA could immediately obtain an injunction against it.   \nPlaintiffs respond that, even where a substantive rule is invalid, agencies must \ngo through notice-and-comment before repealing it. Pl. Br. 34 n.4. But that argument \nrests on an inapposite case involving a substantive rule promulgated through notice-\nand-comment rulemaking and claimed to be defective for some other reason. See \nConsumer Energy Council of Am. v. FERC, 673 F.2d 425, 438 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (holding \nthat agency had not sufficiently evaluated the original rule). By contrast, it would make \nno sense to permit an agency official to violate notice-and-comment requirements in \nadopting a rule and then require her successors to go through the very hurdle of those \nrequirements to undo the prior invalid rule.  \nC.  The district court correctly held that the rescission of DACA \ndid not violate the Constitution. \n1.   The DACA rescission did not violate equal protection. \na. In AADC, the Supreme Court rejected an attempt by a group of aliens to \ndefend against removal by asserting that the Government was discriminating against \nthem based on their First Amendment activity. 525 U.S. at 488-92. The Court began \nwith the principle that “[e]ven in the criminal-law field, a selective prosecution claim is \n52 \n \n\na rara avis.” AADC, 525 U.S. at 489 (citing, inter alia, Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463-65). As \nthe Court reaffirmed, “[b]ecause such claims invade a special province of the \nExecutive—its prosecutorial discretion—we have emphasized that the standard for \nproving them is particularly demanding, requiring a criminal defendant to introduce \n‘clear evidence’ displacing the presumption that a prosecutor has acted lawfully.” Id.  \nThe Supreme Court in AADC then held that an even more restrictive rule than \nArmstrong’s clear-evidence standard was required when the claim of selective \nenforcement arises in the immigration context, because the concerns raised by such \nclaims are “greatly magnified.” 525 U.S. at 489-90. The Court observed that the \n“delay” associated with challenges to immigration enforcement decisions is more \nharmful because it “permit[s] and prolong[s] a continuing violation of United States \nlaw,” especially given that “[p]ostponing justifiable deportation (in the hope that the \nalien’s status will change . . . or simply with the object of extending the alien’s \nunlawful stay) is often the principal object of resistance to a deportation proceeding.” \nId. at 490. The Court also recognized that heightened separation-of-powers concerns \narise in this context because inquiring into the motives behind immigration \nenforcement entails “not merely the disclosure of normal domestic law enforcement \npriorities and techniques,” but also “the disclosure of foreign-policy objectives and [in \nsome cases, like AADC itself,] foreign-intelligence products and techniques.” Id. at \n490-91. Given all this, the Court dismissed “[t]he contention that a violation [of \nfederal law] must be allowed to continue because it has been improperly selected” as \n53 \n \n\n“not powerfully appealing.” Id. at 491.  \nAccordingly, the Court held that, “[a]s a general matter,” “an alien unlawfully in \nthis country has no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense \nagainst his deportation.” AADC, 525 U.S. at 488. Although the Court did “not rule \nout the possibility of a rare case in which the alleged basis of discrimination is so \noutrageous that the . . . considerations [against discriminatory-enforcement claims] \ncan be overcome,” it also did not decide “[w]hether or not there be such exceptions.” \nId. at 491.  \nb. Although it reached the right result, the district court disagreed with the \ngovernment on the framework under which to analyze plaintiffs’ equal protection \nclaims. The court stated that even though “DACA was promulgated under a theory of \nprosecutorial discretion, its rescission was not based on an exercise of that discretion.” \nJA.1508. As already explained, the DACA policy itself was as an act of prosecutorial \ndiscretion (whether or not the exercise of that discretion was lawful) and the \nrescission of that policy reset the agency’s enforcement policies to no longer provide a \ncategorical grant of deferred action to certain individuals. The rescission is thus \nprecisely the kind of selective enforcement decision to which AADC applies, because \nplaintiffs do not dispute the government’s authority to enforce the immigration laws \nagainst them but instead argue that the government has a discriminatory reason for \nenforcing those laws against them (by declining to renew their deferred action).    \n54 \n \n\nPlaintiffs contend (Br. 41) that the district court erred in applying the standard \nderived from Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972). It is, however, not clear that \nthe court applied Mandel in the sense asserted by plaintiffs. The district court \ndiscussed a number of cases for the proposition that courts should be wary of looking \nbehind facially neutral statutes in a variety of contexts, see JA.1509-10, and then came \nto the reasonable conclusion that plaintiffs here had made nothing like the showing \nmade in International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) v. Trump, 883 F.3d 233 (4th Cir.), \ncert. granted, and judgment vacated Trump v. IRAP, No. 17-1270, 2018 WL 1256938 (U.S. \n2018), a showing which the Supreme Court has now deemed insufficient. See Trump v. \nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2423 (2018).  \nIn Trump v. Hawaii the Supreme Court rejected statutory and constitutional \nchallenges to the President’s Proclamation imposing entry restrictions on certain \nnationals of eight foreign countries. In vacating a preliminary injunction against the \nProclamation, the Court reaffirmed that facially neutral immigration policies are \nsubject to only limited, deferential review. 138 S. Ct. at 2419-20. Although the \nproclamation under review in Trump v. Hawaii specifically concerned the admission of \naliens abroad, and thus was reviewed at most for rational basis, the Supreme Court \nrecognized that deferential review may apply “across different contexts and \nconstitutional claims.” Id. at 2419 (citing, among other cases, Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 \nF.3d 427, 433, 438-39 (2d. Cir. 2008), which concerned a special registration policy for \n55 \n \n\naliens from certain countries who were already in the country). The district court \ncorrectly applied such deferential review. \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on this Court’s decision in Sylvia Development Corp. v. Calvert \nCounty, 48 F.3d 810, 829 (4th Cir. 1995), fails to advance their claim. That case—\nwhich found no constitutional violation—involved a claim that a zoning law had been \napplied discriminatorily, not a claim of selective enforcement of immigration law. \nc. Analyzed under the proper framework, it is clear that the district court \nreached the correct result in rejecting plaintiffs’ equal protection claim. A claim that a \nfacially neutral policy like the DACA rescission was motivated by racial animus is \ninsufficient to overcome AADC ’s general bar on discriminatory-motive challenges to \nimmigration-enforcement decisions. See 525 U.S. at 491-92 (holding that even \nselectively targeting particular aliens on the basis of their First Amendment activity did \nnot rise to the level of the possible exception for “outrageous” discrimination). \nVirtually any immigration policy is likely to have a disparate impact on aliens of some \nethnicity, and thus would be vulnerable to a discriminatory-motive allegation from \naliens merely seeking to continue their unlawful presence in this country. Even if all \nsuch claims were ultimately proven baseless, the very act of adjudicating them leads \nprecisely to the delay and foreign policy concerns the Court described in AADC. See \nid. at 490. The district court correctly recognized that with respect to the facially \nneutral rescission of an immigration-enforcement discretion policy, plaintiffs’ claim of \nanimus—unsupported by anything in the administrative record—was insufficient to \n56 \n \n\nsupport an equal protection claim. JA.1508. As the court explained, “[t]he rescission \nof the DACA program merely fulfills the duty of the executive branch to faithfully \nenforce the laws passed by Congress.” JA.1511. \nAt a minimum, if racial discriminatory-motive claims are cognizable in the \nimmigration-enforcement context at all under AADC, they must meet the \n“particularly demanding” standard applicable in the criminal-enforcement context: \nplaintiffs must plausibly allege the existence of “clear evidence” of “outrageous” \ndiscrimination, thus “displacing the presumption that a [federal enforcement official] \nhas acted lawfully,” before the claim may proceed past the pleadings. AADC, 525 \nU.S. at 489, 491 (citing Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463-65). This standard is extremely \ndemanding, and plaintiffs have identified no case where a court has held it to be \nsatisfied. Indeed, several courts of appeals rejected equal protection challenges to a \nregistration requirement for male immigrants from certain (predominantly Muslim) \ncountries—which led to removal for those without lawful status—on the ground that \n“outrageous” discrimination had not been sufficiently demonstrated. See, e.g., \nKandamar v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir. 2006); Hadayat v. Gonzalez, 458 F.3d \n659, 664-65 (7th Cir 2006). \nPlaintiffs’ allegations supporting their equal protection claim (Pl. Br.40-41) \nconsist of statements made by government officials other than the Acting Secretary of \nHomeland Security, JA.46, 69-72, 76-79, 474; and certain events that plaintiffs \n57 \n \n\ncharacterize as “procedural irregularities.” None of these allegations is sufficient to \nestablish an equal protection claim. \nAs an initial matter, plaintiffs disregard the absence of any statement by the \nactual decisionmaker—Acting Secretary Duke—that could give rise to an inference of \nanimus. Acting Secretary Duke was the only government official with the legal \nauthority to rescind a DHS policy that DHS had operated for the previous five years, \n8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)—regardless of the (undisputed) involvement by the White House. \nFor plaintiffs to succeed, it is the Acting Secretary’s decision that must be infected by \ndiscriminatory animus, and the mere fact that her decision was preceded by certain \nstatements of the President cannot ipso facto taint her decision given her independent \noath and duty to obey the Constitution.  \nMoreover, even if the President’s statements are taken on their own terms, they \nare insufficient. First, nationality, as opposed to ethnicity, is not an invidious \nclassification for purposes of federal immigration law. Rajah, 544 F.3d at 435. And \nsecond, most of the statements did not refer to DACA, or indeed any official policy, \nsince they occurred on the campaign trail and preceded the President’s inauguration \nand oath of office. See JA.69-72. Indeed, as the district court recognized, the \n58 \n \n\nstatements directly related to DACA have largely been favorable to that policy. \nJA.1510-11.4  \nSimply put, the statements relied on by plaintiffs do not come close to plausibly \nalleging clear evidence of discriminatory motive. Indeed, it is utterly implausible that, \nin deciding whether to retain a policy that affirmatively sanctions the ongoing \nviolation of federal law by nearly 700,000 aliens without lawful status, it was a \nsignificant factor that those aliens are predominantly Latino, especially given the \nserious questions about whether the policy itself was illegal.  \nNor do plaintiffs advance their claim by invoking “procedural irregularities.” \nPlaintiffs entirely fail to draw any causal connection between these supposed \nirregularities (which were not irregular at all, see, e.g., infra pp. 66-67 (information-\nsharing policy)) and racial animus. See Pl. Br. 41.  \nd. Lacking sufficient evidence to carry their burden, Plaintiffs argue that the \ndistrict court could not properly grant summary judgment on their equal protection \nclaim without permitting them to take discovery. Pl. Br. 18-19.  \nFor the reasons explained above, plaintiffs failed to state a claim that the \nrescission of DACA violated equal protection, and the district court could therefore \n                                                 \n4 The statements by the Attorney General and a White House policy advisor \ncited in the complaint are also insufficient, see JA.72, as is plaintiffs’ reliance on a \ngeneral increase in immigration enforcement, JA.76-79. Statements and actions \nindicating an increase in immigration enforcement simply underscore that the \nmotivation of the agency action challenged here was not racial or ethnic animus, but \nrather the resetting of agency enforcement priorities.  \n59 \n \n\nproperly grant the government’s motion to dismiss. No discovery was warranted for \nthis reason alone, and this Court may affirm on that basis. \nEven if this Court were to evaluate the appropriateness of granting summary \njudgment on this claim, the district court correctly recognized that plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claims could be decided on the basis of the administrative record.  \nJA.1508. The APA expressly provides that agency action may be set aside as contrary \nto “constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \nAccordingly, the APA’s “comprehensive remedial scheme,” Western Radio Servs. Co. v. \nUnited States Forest Serv., 578 F.3d 1116, 1122-23 (9th Cir. 2009), for a “person \n‘adversely affected’ . . . by agency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 702, including its provisions \ngoverning record review, applies to constitutional claims for non-monetary relief \nagainst federal agencies and officials. See also Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.S. 537, 551-554 \n(2007) (describing the APA as the remedial scheme for vindicating complaints against \n“unfavorable agency actions”). \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988) (cited at Pl. \nBr. 44), is not to the contrary. The Court’s reference in that case to “any discovery \nprocess which may be instituted” after remand is hardly a holding that the APA’s \nrequirement of record review has no application to constitutional claims. Id. at 604. \nPlaintiffs further err in relying on this Court’s statement in Ray Communications, \nInc. v. Clear Channel Communications, Inc., 673 F.3d 294, 299 (4th Cir. 2012), that “where \nthe movant fails to fulfill its initial burden of providing admissible evidence of the \n60 \n \n\nmaterial facts entitling it to summary judgment, summary judgment must be denied, \neven if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented, for the non-movant is not \nrequired to rebut an insufficient showing.” Ray Communications did not involve an APA \nclaim, and here the government met its burden by submitting the administrative \nrecord.  \nEven assuming some discovery might be permitted for constitutional claims \nunder the APA, the district court did not err in granting judgment for the government \nwithout discovery in this case. The Supreme Court has addressed when discovery is \nappropriate in selective enforcement contexts. Indeed, the whole point of Armstrong’s \nholding that there must be “clear evidence” of discrimination before prosecutorial \ndiscretion can be challenged, supra p. 53, was to limit discovery in selective prosecution \nclaims. 517 U.S. at 463-65; see also AADC, 525 U.S. at 489-90 (relying on Armstrong in \nholding that aliens defending against removal by alleging selective enforcement need \nnot be given access to district court fact-finding procedures). As explained, plaintiffs \nhave not put forth any evidence that DACA was motivated by animus, let alone the \nkind of “clear evidence” of discriminatory intent required under Armstrong and \nAADC. The inappropriateness of discovery in this case is further underscored by the \nbreadth of plaintiffs’ discovery requests, see, e.g., JA.1117-22 (asking for all documents \nand communications within and between DHS, DOJ, “the executive branch,” and “the \nTrump administration” on a variety of topics). Instead of “clear evidence” of \ndiscriminatory intent, plaintiffs asked the district court to permit them to go on a \n61 \n \n\nhighly intrusive fishing expedition of precisely the sort that Armstrong and AADC \nforbid. The district court quite properly denied the request. \nAs a final matter, the district court did not, as plaintiffs contend, fail to view the \nfacts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs’ claim. See Pl. Br. 46. In so arguing, \nplaintiffs confuse factual findings with their legal relevance. For example, plaintiffs set \nforth as “disputed” the fact that 93% of DACA recipients were Latino. Pl. Br. 17. The \ngovernment disputed the legal relevance of that fact, to be sure, but the government \nhas never disputed that DACA recipients were predominantly Latino (whatever the \nprecise figure). The same is true of the various statements made by the President that \nplaintiffs cited in their complaint. See Pl. Br. 46. The district court did not proceed as \nthough the statements were not made, but rather recognized that the statements were \nlegally insufficient to support plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  \n2.   The DACA rescission did not violate due process. \nThe district court also correctly rejected plaintiffs’ due process challenges to the \nrescission of DACA. JA.1512-14.  \na. The DACA guidance could not have been clearer that it did not create any \n“substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.” JA.131. As then-\nSecretary Napolitano explained, “[o]nly the Congress, acting through its legislative \nauthority, can confer these rights.” Id. In the face of this clear language, a subjective \n“belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how sincerely or reasonably \nheld, does not create a property right.” Gerhart v. Lake County, 637 F.3d 1013, 1020-21 \n62 \n \n\n(9th Cir. 2011) (citing Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458, 465 (1981)). \nPlaintiffs try in vain to identify any express commitment on the part of the \ngovernment to indefinitely maintain the DACA policy. See Pl. Br. 50, 51. But as the \ndistrict court correctly held, DACA simply created no protected liberty or property \ninterest. JA.1512-13. That alone disposes of plaintiffs’ due process claims. \nb. Even assuming a protected interest, the procedural due process claim would \nstill fail. Plaintiffs’ theory is not that individual DACA requests were adjudicated \nincorrectly (for example, due to factual error) and that notice and a hearing could \ncorrect those errors. Instead, plaintiffs claim that DHS cannot alter the DACA policy, \neven on a prospective basis, without providing individualized notice and hearings to \nnearly 800,000 recipients. As the district court recognized, however, JA.1512, where a \ngovernment policy “applies to more than a few people, it is impracticable that \neveryone should have a direct voice in its adoption,” and thus due process does not \nrequire individualized pre-deprivation notice. Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of \nEqualization, 239 U.S. 441, 445 (1915); see also Yassini v. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356, 1359, \n1363 (9th Cir. 1980) (per curiam) (rejecting procedural due process challenge to \nrescission of deferred action policy).  \nIn response to this clear precedent, plaintiffs argue that their complaint \ncontained “specific allegations by specific individuals of the benefits they had lost.” Pl. \nBr. 51, 52. But due process obviously does not prohibit the rescission of a general \npolicy on a categorical rather than individualized basis, and thus notice and an \n63 \n \n\nopportunity to be heard on these specific allegations is neither necessary nor \nappropriate. Plaintiffs further miss the mark in relying on Kapps v. Wing, 404 F.3d 105, \n118 (2d Cir. 2005) (cited at Pl. Br. 53), to argue that individualized process may be \nrequired even for large numbers of individuals. The fact that notice and a hearing for \nindividual decisions, where otherwise required, cannot be dispensed with merely \nbecause of the number of individuals affected does not mean that notice and a \nhearing are required for the rescission of generally applicable policies. \nPlaintiffs’ argument that Bi-Metallic is limited to legislative actions, Pl. Br. 52, \nfinds no support in law or logic. Although the Supreme Court there noted that \nindividuals subject to a general policy may have recourse to political processes, the \ndecision did not require a showing of any particular process. Any time a rule of \nconduct applies generally, an individual’s “rights are protected in the only way that \nthey can be in a complex society, by their power, immediate or remote, over those \nwho make the rule.” Bi-Metallic, 239 U.S. at 445. The ongoing Congressional and \npublic debates over DACA vividly illustrate this principle.  \nc. Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim likewise fails. As the district court \ncorrectly held, “[t]he rescission of a policy relating to prosecutorial discretion does not \nshock the conscience.” JA.1514. “[T]he only thing that has changed,” the court \nobserved “is that deferred status will expire . . . in the absence of action by Congress.” \nId. “There is nothing surprising or unfair about policies, laws, or enforcement thereof \nchanging with an election cycle.” Id. Because plaintiffs’ only attempt to demonstrate \n64 \n \n\nconscience-shocking behavior hinges on their allegations of animus, see Pl. Br. 54 \n(citing cases not involving substantive due process), their substantive due process \nchallenge collapses into their flawed equal protection claim, supra Part II.C.1.  \nd. Although the district court did not separately address plaintiffs’ due process \nclaims with respect to the DACA information-sharing policy, see Pl. Br. 54-55, those \nclaims are no more successful than plaintiffs’ claims challenging the rescission of \nDACA. The DACA information-sharing policy created no protected property or \nliberty interest, as it was always expressly subject to change, see infra pp. 66. And \nplaintiffs have failed to show that any alleged change to the information-sharing \npolicy shocks the conscience or that individualized process was due. The information-\nsharing policy has not changed, see infra pp. 67, and has, in any event, always been \nsubject to a number of exceptions. \nIII.  The District Court Erred in Enjoining the Government from \nChanging the Information-Sharing Policy. \nNo other court has accepted the theory advanced by plaintiffs and adopted by \nthe district court that the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevents the government \nfrom modifying an information-sharing policy that has been expressly subject to \nmodification since the inception of DACA. This Court should not either, and at a \nminimum it should vacate the nationwide injunction insofar as it extends beyond the \nplaintiffs in this case. \n65 \n \n\nA.  The district court erred in holding that the government was \nsubject to equitable estoppel. \n1. When the DACA policy was implemented in 2012, DHS published a \n“frequently asked questions” webpage that included guidance regarding DHS’s policy \non the sharing of information provided in connection with DACA requests. The \nguidance stated that information would be “protected from disclosure to ICE and \n[Customs and Border Protection (CBP)] for the purpose of immigration enforcement \nproceedings,” subject to exceptions where the criteria for issuance of a Notice to \nAppear are satisfied (for example, where national security, public safety, or significant \ncriminal activity interests are implicated), and subject to the caveat that the policy \n“may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time.” DHS DACA FAQ 19; see \nalso id. (explaining that information may be used for certain purposes other than \nremoval); USCIS, Revised Guidance for the Referral of Cases and Issuance of Notices to Appear \n(NTAs) (Nov. 7, 2011), https://go.usa.gov/xncPK (last visited July 30, 2018).  \nNothing in the Acting Secretary’s memorandum changes that approach—in \nfact, the memorandum makes no reference to information sharing at all, a point the \ndistrict court recognized, JA.1505 n.24. And DHS made clear in guidance issued after \nthe rescission that “[t]his information-sharing policy has not changed in any way since it \nwas first announced, including as a result of the Sept. 5, 2017 memo starting a wind-\ndown of the DACA policy.” USCIS, Guidance on Rejected DACA Requests Q5 (Dec. 27, \n2017), www.uscis.gov/daca2017/guidance-rejected-daca2017 (emphasis added) (last \n66 \n \n\nvisited July 30, 2018). In fact, even the district court did not conclude that the policy \nhad changed; rather it faulted the government for being “unable to provide any \nassurance the Government would not make changes” in the future. JA.1516. \n2.a. The district court erred in holding that plaintiffs were entitled to a \npermanent injunction on equitable estoppel grounds. The Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly indicated that estoppel against the government “may only be justified, if \never, in the presence of affirmative misconduct by government agents.” Dawkins v. \nWitt, 318 F.3d 606, 611 (4th Cir. 2003) (collecting cases). But the district court did not \nfind any affirmative misconduct, or even that the policy had changed in any way. \nInstead, the court speculated that “it is possible that the government, having induced \nthese immigrants to share personal information under the guise of immigration \nprotections, could now use that same information to track and remove them,” which \n“potentially would be ‘affirmative misconduct.’ ” JA.1516.  \nThe district court’s speculation fails to satisfy the requirement of “affirmative \nmisconduct” for two independent reasons. First, and most obviously, the policy has \nnot changed, and the court did not find that it had. Unquantified “potential[]” for future \naction cannot establish the current “presence” of actual misconduct. JA.1516; see \nDawkins, 318 F.3d at 611. Indeed, given the lack of a finding concerning any current or \neven imminent change of policy, this claim fails to satisfy the requirements of both \nstanding, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 563 (1992), and irreparable harm, \neBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006). \n67 \n \n\nSecond, the government did not “promise” that information obtained through \nDACA requests would never, under any circumstances, be used for immigration \nenforcement or that the policy would not change. Rather, DHS explained that \ninformation would be “protected from disclosure to ICE and CBP for the purpose of \nimmigration enforcement proceedings,” subject to exceptions where the criteria for \nissuance of a Notice to Appear are satisfied. JA.1011. And this was subject to the \ncaveat that the policy “may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without \nnotice,” id., a fact the district court acknowledged yet failed to address in its analysis, \nJA.1532-33. Thus, even if the government changed its policy at a future date, DHS’s \nstatements regarding the prior policy would not be converted into \n“misrepresentation[s]” for purposes of equitable estoppel, Chawla v. Transamerica \nOccidental Life Ins. Co., 440 F.3d 639, 646 (4th Cir. 2006), let alone “affirmative \nmisconduct,” Dawkins, 318 F.3d at 611-12. \nb. As a more fundamental matter, the district court erred because an equitable \nestoppel claim is not available against the government, even assuming the typical \nelements of such a claim might be demonstrated.  \nOnly Congress can create a “private right[] of action to enforce federal law.” \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286 (2001). Yet Congress has created no applicable \nright of action for a freestanding equitable estoppel cause of action against the \ngovernment. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that the arguments in favor of \nbarring equitable estoppel against the government are “substantial,” while declining to \n68 \n \n\nrule on the issue. Heckler v. Community Health Servs., 467 U.S. 51, 60 (1984); OPM v. \nRichmond, 496 U.S. 414, 423 (1990). Courts of appeals have similarly recognized the \nstrong reasons for reticence in applying estoppel against the government, particularly \nin its exercise of policymaking discretion. See United States v. Owens, 54 F.3d 271, 275 \n(6th Cir. 1995) (“[T]he government should not be unduly hindered from changing its \nposition if that shift is the result of a change in public policy.”). And, at most, \napplication of the doctrine of estoppel could be “justified only where ‘it does not \ninterfere with underlying government policies.’ ” Emery Mining Corp. v. Secretary of Labor, \n744 F.2d 1411, 1416 (10th Cir. 1984). The district court’s injunction here does just \nthat—it constrains DHS’s enforcement and policymaking discretion with respect to \nwhether and how to use information it possesses in connection with immigration \nproceedings. The injunction should be vacated. \nB.   The district court erred in granting injunctive relief that was \nnationwide in scope. \nThe district court’s injunction must be vacated for an additional reason: in \ngranting nationwide relief, the district court violated the requirements of Article III \nand equity. The injunction prohibits the changing of an information policy as it \napplies to hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who are not parties before the \ncourt and who do not need to be covered to provide plaintiffs here with complete \nrelief. \n69 \n \n\n1. To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff “must allege personal injury fairly \ntraceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by \nthe requested relief.” DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342 (2006). \n“[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross,” and the plaintiff must establish standing \n“separately for each form of relief sought.” Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. \nCt. 1645, 1650 (2017).  \nThe Supreme Court recently reaffirmed these principles in Gill v. Whitford, 138 \nS. Ct. 1916 (2018), concluding that a set of voters had not demonstrated standing to \nchallenge alleged statewide partisan gerrymandering of Wisconsin legislative districts.  \nThe plaintiffs alleged that voters who shared their political views were disadvantaged \nby the way district lines were drawn statewide, and that they were therefore entitled to \nchallenge the entire state map. Id. at 1924-25. But the Court concluded that a \n“plaintiff’s remedy must be ‘limited to the inadequacy that produced [his] injury in \nfact,’ ” and that a voter’s “harm [from] the dilution of [his] vote[] . . . is district \nspecific” because it “results from the boundaries of the particular district in which he \nresides.” Id. at 1930 (quoting Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996)). Accordingly, \nthe Court held that “the remedy that is proper and sufficient lies in the revision of the \nboundaries of the individual’s own district,” not the broader remedy of “restructuring \nall of the State’s legislative districts.” Id. at 1930-31. And the Court “caution[ed]” that, \non remand, any “remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff ’s particular injury.” \n70 \n \n\nId. at 1934; accord id. at 1933 (“The Court’s constitutionally prescribed role is to \nvindicate the individual rights of the people appearing before it.”). Other courts have \nrecognized the same. See, e.g., McKenzie v. City of Chicago, 118 F.3d 552, 555 & n.* (7th \nCir. 1997).  \n2. Even apart from Article III’s requirements, fundamental principles of equity \nsupport the same rule. The Supreme Court has cautioned that “injunctive relief \nshould be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete \nrelief to the plaintiffs” before the court. Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979); \nsee also Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994); Samuel L. Bray, \nMultiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 428-37 \n(2017) (explaining the lack of historical basis for nationwide injunctions). \nThis Court applied that teaching to vacate a nationwide injunction in Virginia \nSociety for Human Life, Inc. v. FEC, 263 F.3d 379 (4th Cir. 2001). There, the district \ncourt had issued a nationwide injunction preventing the Federal Election Commission \nfrom enforcing a challenged regulation “against any party anywhere in the United \nStates.” Id. at 393. This Court explained that an injunction covering the plaintiff alone \nwould “adequately protec[t] it,” and that preventing the Commission from enforcing \nthe regulation “against other parties in other circuits does not provide any additional \nrelief ” to the prevailing plaintiff. Id. The Court also rejected the argument that a \nnationwide injunction was necessary to set aside unlawful agency action, noting that \n71 \n \n\n“[n]othing in the language of the APA” requires the exercise of “such far-reaching \npower.” Id. at 394. \nMoreover, nationwide injunctions “take a toll on the federal court system—\npreventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging \nforum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for \nthe Executive Branch.” Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2425 (Thomas, J., concurring); see also \nVirginia Soc’y for Life, 263 F.3d at 393. They also create an inequitable “one-way-\nratchet” under which any prevailing plaintiff obtains relief on behalf of all others, but \na victory by the government would not preclude other potential plaintiffs from \n“run[ning] off to the 93 other districts for more bites at the apple.” City of Chicago v. \nSessions, 888 F.3d 272, 298 (7th Cir. 2018) (Manion, J., dissenting in part), reh’g en banc \ngranted, Order of June 4, 2018 (No. 17-05270) (vacating panel judgment “insofar as it \nsustained the district court’s decision to extend preliminary relief nationwide”); cf. \nUnited States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 158-62 (1984) (holding that non-parties to an \nadverse decision against the federal government may not invoke the decision to \npreclude the government from continuing to defend the issue in subsequent \nlitigation). Here, there are multiple cases across the country challenging the rescission \nof the DACA policy and the alleged change to the information-sharing policy. Each \ncourt should adjudicate the claims of the plaintiffs before it, and the plaintiffs in other \ncases should not benefit from the government’s loss in this case on the information-\n72 \n \n\nsharing policy, just as they are not bound by the government’s win here on the DACA \nrescission. \nCONCLUSION \nThe district court’s permanent injunction should be vacated, and its grant of \nsummary judgment to the government should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted, \n  CHAD A.

Established in 2012, \nDACA allowed individuals who were brought to the United States as children to \napply for legal status, providing critical stability by allowing them to work, study, \ntravel internationally, and live free from the risk of deportation.  DACA was \nsimilar to a long line of other deferred action programs, and the Government \ncontinuously had defended its legality.  The Government’s change of position \nannounced on September 5 upended the lives of the 800,000 individuals granted \nDACA, as well their families and their communities.   \nThe circumstances of the September 5 decision leave no doubt that it rested \non invidious racial discrimination.  The decision followed repeated statements \nfrom senior Government officials, including the President, expressing anti-Latino \nanimus and threatening Latino immigrants with expulsion.  The rescission of \nDACA was consistent with those statements.  Ninety-three percent of DACA \nrecipients were Latino.  And while rescinding DACA, the Government continued \nother deferred action programs with higher proportions of non-Latino \nbeneficiaries.  \nProcedural irregularities also signaled invidious purposes at work.  Having \ncontinuously defended DACA as legal, the Government abruptly changed its \n1 \n\nposition on September 5 with no prior notice, no opportunity to comment, and no \nmechanism for individual recipients to be heard before losing their benefits.  The \nGovernment’s approach was harmful and unfair.   \nIndeed, the Government flouted the most fundamental attribute of a fair \nadministrative process:  the requirement of a reasoned explanation for its decisions.  \nIn rescinding DACA, the Government offered only the most threadbare \njustification—a one-page letter from Attorney General Jefferson Sessions (the \n“Sessions Letter”) announcing without elaboration that DACA had unspecified \n“legal and constitutional defects” and a five-page memorandum from Acting U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) Secretary Elaine Duke (the \n“Rescission Memo”) citing the same amorphous “legal and constitutional defects.”  \nThe Administrative Record subsequently produced to support the decision \nconsisted of 14 documents totaling 256 pages, almost all of which were either \ncopies of court decisions concerning a challenge to a different deferred action \nprogram or an Office of Legal Counsel opinion that DACA was legal.  Despite the \nrequirement that the Government carefully assess the impact of the change in \nposition, neither the Sessions Letter nor the Rescission Memo nor the \nAdministrative Record mentioned the impact of the rescission on the 800,000 \nDACA recipients and their families, communities, and employers, much less a \nreasoned explanation for its sudden reversal of position.   \n2 \n\nTen lawsuits were filed across the country challenging the DACA rescission.  \nFaced with the same Sessions Letter, Rescission Memo, and Administrative \nRecord, the judges in nine of those suits (consolidated before three other courts) \nconcluded that the DACA rescission was illegal and unsupported by the \nAdministrative Record, and they ordered appropriate relief, including the entry of \nnationwide injunctions.  \nThe District Court here was the lone outlier, not only finding that the DACA \nrescission was “valid and constitutional in all respects,” J.A. 1520, but also giving \nshort shrift to problems other courts had found were substantial violations of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  The other courts: \n• concluded the Administrative Record was incomplete and insufficient to \nsupport the decision, J.A. 1377-79, 1453-54;\n• ordered discovery to proceed, given the inadequate Administrative Record, \nJ.A. 1377;\n• recognized that the “arbitrary and capricious” standard required an analysis \nof whether the decision was “in accordance of the law,” J.A. 1390, 1454.  \nThose courts found the rescission was based on a “flawed legal premise” \n(J.A. 1390, 1454) and reflected an “obvious factual mistake,” J.A. 1465, \n1395-96;\n• noted the disparate impact of terminating a program that was 93 percent \nLatino, J.A. 1420; and\n• noted the legal significance of the expressions of “racial animus towards \nLatinos” by the President. J.A. 1420. \n3 \n\nThe District Court discounted, ignored, or quarreled with each and every one of \nthese points.  A review of the District Court’s treatment of Rule 56, the APA, and \nthe applicable Equal Protection and Due Process precedent confirm that this Court \nshould reverse and remand this case. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT\nThe District Court’s jurisdiction was invoked under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n2201(a).  J.A. 47.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.  On March \n5, 2018, the District Court entered its order granting in part and denying in part the \nAppellees’ motion for summary judgment and granting in part Appellants’ request \nfor injunctive relief.  J.A. 1519-20.  On March 15, the District Court entered an \norder modifying the scope of that injunctive relief.  J.A. 1531.  The District Court \nentered an amended order later that day, reiterating its ruling on summary \njudgment and injunctive relief, declaring that the DACA rescission was “valid and \nconstitutional in all respects,” and directing the Clerk of Court to close the case.  \nJ.A. 1532-33.  Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal on April 27, 2018, J.A. \n1534-36, and the Appellees filed a notice of appeal on May 4, 2018, J.A. 1537-38.  \nSTATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW \n1.  Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment (a) \nwhere the Administrative Record produced by Appellees was facially incomplete; \n4 \n\n(b) without permitting Appellants to conduct any discovery; and (c) where there \nwere material facts in dispute. \n2.  Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for \nAppellees with respect to Appellants’ Administrative Procedure Act claims by \nfailing to recognize that the rescission of DACA was arbitrary and capricious and \nthat the Government’s action constituted a substantive determination requiring \nnotice and comment.   \n3.  Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for \nAppellees with respect to Appellants’ Equal Protection claims by applying an \nimproper and overly deferential standard of review and failing to construe facts in \nthe light most favorable to Plaintiffs. \n4.  Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment on \nAppellants’ Due Process claims by failing to recognize that (a) DACA created \nconstitutionally protected interests, the mass rescission of which violated due \nprocess; and (b) the rescission of DACA and changes to DHS’s information-\nsharing policy violated substantive due process rights.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPlaintiffs are sixteen individuals who participated in or were eligible for the \nDACA program, along with nine social service organizations that serve applicants \nfor and recipients of DACA program benefits.  J.A. 47-57.  The DACA program \n5 \n\nallowed immigrants who were brought to the United States as children (known as \n“Dreamers”)—who thus were in no way culpable—to apply for legal status.  J.A. \n40-41, 58-60.  Many of these individuals were brought by parents fleeing violence \nand horrific circumstances in their countries of origin or economic hardship, and \nthe DACA program gave them the ability to live in the United States free from the \nrisk of deportation.  J.A. 40, 44, 50-57. \nThe Government publicly promoted participation in the DACA program \nwith the promise that it would make recipients eligible for certain rights and \nprivileges associated with lawful presence in the United States, including the right \nto receive work permits and travel internationally.  J.A. 41-42, 60-63.  The \nGovernment also assured applicants that their personal information would not be \nused for immigration enforcement.  J.A. 42-43, 63-68. \nOn September 5, 2017, Attorney General Jefferson Sessions announced the \nrescission of DACA.  J.A. 44, 72-73.  Hours later, then-Acting Homeland Security \nSecretary Elaine Duke released the Rescission Memo directing the Government to \nimmediately cease accepting new DACA applications and to stop issuing to \nDreamers work permits and permission to travel internationally.  J.A. 44-45, 73-\n75.  A few days later, DHS issued guidance hedging its prior commitment to \nDreamers to keep their applicant information from enforcement officials.  J.A. 45, \n75-80.  These actions upended the lives of almost 800,000 Dreamers, ending their \n6 \n\nability to remain in the United States legally, to continue working, to enroll in \ncollege, and to lead the lives they had established based on DACA’s grant of \nforbearance.  J.A. 50-57, 73-75, 1237-39, 1242-45, 1248-51.   \nOn October 5, 2017, Plaintiffs sued DHS, Acting Secretary Duke, Attorney \nGeneral Sessions, and other Government officials and agencies in the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Maryland.  J.A. 37-97.  The Complaint asked the Court to \nenjoin and declare illegal the termination of the DACA program, as well as the \nGovernment’s threat to share personal information of DACA applicants and \nbeneficiaries with immigration enforcement authorities, under the APA, the Fifth \nAmendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection guarantees, and common law \nestoppel.  J.A. 85-96.  The Complaint: \n• Identified the anomaly that DACA program enrollees were 93 percent \nLatino, while other deferred action programs that were not \npredominantly Latino continued, J.A. 46, 58-59, 90, 1095;   \n• Documented a string of 22 public statements by the President, \nAttorney General, and other senior Government officials prior to the \nDACA rescission threatening expulsion or otherwise expressing anti-\nLatino animus.  Among other things, the Complaint noted the \nPresident’s statements that Latino immigrants were “criminals,” \n“rapists,” “thugs,” “bad hombres,” and “true animals,” were in \nconjunction with his threats that “we’re going to get them out,” “they \nare finished,” and “we’re getting them out,” J.A. 46, 69-72, 76-79, \n83-84, 1096; and   \n• Identified significant procedural irregularities in the rescission of \nDACA, including the failure to provide prior notice of the reversal of \nthe Government’s long-standing position that DACA was lawful or to \n7 \n\noffer any explanation for the decision beyond the barest of reasoning.  \nJ.A. 82-85, 90-93, 1096-99.   \nSee generally J.A. 37-97.   \nBy a letter dated October 10, 2017 and at a hearing on November 1, 2017, \nPlaintiffs requested leave to commence discovery prior to the Government’s \nresponse to the Complaint.  J.A. 98-99, 100-123. The District Court orally denied \nthat request at the hearing on November 1.  J.A. 30, 109-111, 121.   \nOn November 15, 2017, the Government filed the Administrative Record, \nJ.A. 129-384, and certified that it included only “non-privileged documents that \nwere actually considered” by Acting Secretary Duke.  J.A. 127.  The filed record \nconsisted of 14 documents totaling 256 pages; 217 pages were copies of court \ndecisions concerning a different deferred action program, and 32 pages were a \nDepartment of Justice Office of Legal Counsel opinion confirming the legality of \nthe DACA program.  J.A. 125-384.  The record did not include any materials \nconsidered by other participants in the decision-making process; any cost or legal \nanalysis of the impact of the decision on DACA recipients, their families, \nemployers, and communities; or any justification for the change in the \nGovernment’s longstanding legal positions beyond a few conclusions devoid of \nany analysis. \nThat same day, the Government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction \nunder Rule 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) and in the \n8 \n\nalternative for summary judgment under Rule 56 (“Motion”).  J.A. 385-86.  \nPlaintiffs filed an opposition with supporting declarations on November 28.  J.A. \n461-1252.  This filing included a statement of material facts as to which there was \na genuine dispute, J.A. 473-476, and public records further substantiating the \nprocedural irregularities, as well as other evidence underpinning the APA, Due \nProcess, and estoppel claims.  J.A. 531-1093.  The opposition also included a Rule \n56(d) declaration explaining the need for discovery on the completeness of the \nAdministrative Record, as well as discovery on the constitutional claims.  J.A. \n1094-1105.  The Rule 56(d) declaration attached draft discovery requests, as well \nas discovery that had been propounded in parallel proceedings seeking, among \nother things, discovery relevant to the incompleteness of the Administrative \nRecord; Plaintiffs’ intentional discrimination claim (including further evidence of \nanimus by senior Government officials regarding Latinos, evidence regarding the \nhistory leading up to the rescission decision, departures from agency practice, and \nthe discriminatory impact of the decision); and Plaintiffs’ due process and estoppel \nclaims (concerning the Government’s representations regarding benefits and data \nprivacy).  J.A. 1106-1234. \nOn December 11, 2017, the District Court issued an order giving notice “that \nit may grant summary judgment for the nonmovants (Plaintiffs).”  J.A. 1290.   Oral \nargument was held on December 15, 2017.  J.A. 32, 1292-1358.  \n9 \n\nFollowing oral argument, Plaintiffs submitted notices of supplemental \nauthority noting that two other District Courts considering similar challenges had \nenjoined the Government’s rescission of DACA.  J.A. 1359-1424 (Regents of Univ. \nof Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2018)).  \nJ.A. 1429-1485 (Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 279 F. Supp. 3d. 401 (E.D.N.Y. 2018)).  \nSince then, a third court has also found the DACA rescission to be arbitrary and \ncapricious.  NAACP v. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209 (D.D.C. 2018).   \nOn March 5, 2018, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the \nGovernment’s Motions.  Specifically, the Court denied the Government’s Rule \n12(b)(1) motion, finding that Plaintiffs had standing and rejecting the \nGovernment’s arguments that the claims were not justiciable.  The Court then \ngranted summary judgment to the Government on all counts of the Complaint with \nthe exception of Plaintiffs’ estoppel claim.  The Court granted summary judgment \nto Plaintiffs on the estoppel claim concerning the sharing of DACA applicant \ninformation and it entered an injunction prohibiting the Government from using or \nsharing applicant-provided information through the DACA program for \nimmigration-enforcement or deportation purposes.  J.A. 1489-1520.  On March 15, \nthe District Court entered a stipulated order clarifying the scope of the injunctive \nrelief.  J.A. 1531-33.  Plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal on April 27, 2018, \nand the Government filed a notice of appeal on May 4, 2018.  J.A. 1534-38. \n10 \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThis case is an outlier.  Three other courts have considered the issues \npresented here, and all three reached precisely the opposite conclusion than the \nDistrict Court reached here.  The other courts were right.  The District Court’s \ngrant of summary judgment for the Government rests on a series of legal errors, \neach sufficient by itself to require reversal and remand.   \nFirst, the District Court misapplied Rule 56.  It did so by granting summary \njudgment without allowing the requested discovery and without requiring the \nmoving party to submit a statement of undisputed facts.  And it did so by failing to \nconstrue critical facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff.  \nThe District Court similarly misapplied the APA judicial review provisions by \nfailing to ensure its review was conducted based on the “whole record,” 5 U.S.C. § \n706, when the 14-document, 256-page Administrative Record submitted by the \nGovernment was glaringly incomplete. \nSecond, in dismissing the APA claims, the District Court failed to apply the \ncorrect standards for assessing whether agency action is arbitrary and capricious.  \nBoth the agency and District Court failed to consider important aspects of the \nproblem, including the Government’s lack of explanation for its reversal of \nposition and the reliance interests of 800,000 DACA recipients (as well as their \nfamilies, employers, and communities).  The District Court also disregarded this \n11 \n\nCourt’s precedent in excusing the Government’s failure to provide notice and an \nopportunity to comment before rescinding DACA. \nThird, in dismissing the Equal Protection claim, the District Court applied \nthe wrong standard of review, holding incorrectly that this Court’s decision in \nInternational Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) v. Trump, 883 F.3d 233 (4th Cir. \n2018) (“IRAP”), cert. granted, vacated on other grounds, No. 17-1270, 2018 WL \n1256938 (Sup. Ct. June 28, 2018) (overturning the judgment of the Fourth Circuit \nwhile limiting the analysis to individuals yet to be admitted into the United States), \nmandated deferential review under Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972).   \nAs the Supreme Court has now reiterated, the Mandel standard is predicated on the \nGovernment’s national security powers and it applies when individuals are seeking \nentry into the United States.  Trump v. Hawaii, No. 17-965, 2018 WL 3116337 (S. \nCt. Jun. 26, 2018).  The Mandel standard is not the right one here because (i) the \nGovernment raised no national security interests in rescinding DACA, and (ii) the \nPlaintiffs are claiming intentional discrimination against persons already in the \nUnited States, dictating more rigorous standards of review for Government action.  \nThe District Court also failed to construe in the light most favorable to non-movant \nPlaintiffs significant evidence of animus, the events leading to the termination, the \nGovernment’s departures from normal agency procedures, the discriminatory \n12 \n\nimpact of the rescission on DACA recipients, and the striking coalescence of all \nthese factors at the same time for the same decision. \nFourth, in dismissing the Due Process claim, the District Court overstepped \nits role in deciding a summary judgment motion and failed to credit Plaintiffs’ \nallegations and evidence regarding each of the rights and benefits that the \nGovernment had conferred on DACA recipients, and it misapplied precedent in \nconcluding that the Due Process clause did not apply to the stripping of these rights \nen masse.  The District Court also failed to construe in the light most favorable to \nthe non-movant Plaintiffs the evidence of a substantive Due Process violation (the \novertly anti-Latino statements by senior Government officials).  And the District \nCourt dismissed without analysis the Plaintiffs’ claim that the threat to use \napplicant information in immigration enforcement proceedings violated substantive \nDue Process. \nFor each of these reasons, and all of them together, this Court should reverse \nand remand this matter. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nAn appellate court reviews de novo district court orders granting summary \njudgment.  Roland v. United States Citizen and Immigration Servs., 850 F.3d 625, \n628 (4th Cir. 2017).  Summary judgment is appropriate only when the record \nshows there is no genuine issue of material fact.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.  The Court \n13 \n\nmust determine “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require \nsubmission to a [factfinder] or whether it is so one-sided that one party must \nprevail as a matter of law.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 \n(1986).   \nIn making this determination, this Court must view the evidence, and all \njustifiable inferences from the evidence, in the light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party.  Halperin v. Abacus Tech. Corp., 128 F.3d 191, 196 (4th Cir. 1997).  \nIt must also draw all inferences in favor of the non-movant.  Williams v. Griffin, \n952 F.2d 820, 823 (4th Cir. 1991).  Particularly where motive and intent play \n“leading roles,” summary judgment should be granted “sparingly.”  Poller v. CBS, \n368 U.S. 464, 491 (1962).  “Credibility determinations, the weighing of the \nevidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury \nfunctions, not those of a judge.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255.  Failure to credit \nplausible evidence offered by a party, or the failure to draw inferences in favor of \nthe non-movant, requires reversal.  \nARGUMENT \nI. The District Court Misapplied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and \nthe APA in Prematurely Granting Summary Judgment  \nNotwithstanding the momentous issues at stake in this litigation, the District \nCourt made some very basic procedural errors.  The District Court erred in \ngranting summary judgment on an incomplete Administrative Record and without \n14 \n\nany opportunity for discovery.  First, the District Court misapplied Rule 56 with \nrespect to all claims by refusing to afford Plaintiffs the opportunity to conduct \ndiscovery, by failing to consider material facts in dispute, and by failing to \nconstrue certain key facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most \nfavorable to the non-moving Plaintiffs.  Second, the District Court ruled on \nPlaintiffs’ APA claims without establishing that the entire record was before it, in \nviolation of the APA.  For each of these reasons, the Court should reverse and \nremand. \nA. The District Court’s Summary Judgment Ruling Failed To Meet \nThe Requirements of Rule 56 \nThe District Court misapplied Rule 56 in three ways: (1) it failed to afford \nPlaintiffs a reasonable opportunity for discovery; (2) it failed to consider Plaintiffs’ \nstatement of material facts in dispute; and (3) it failed to construe facts in the light \nmost favorable to Plaintiffs. \nFirst, the District Court improperly adjudicated the Government’s alternative \nRule 56 motion without affording Plaintiffs “a reasonable opportunity for \ndiscovery.”  Baltimore Ctr. for Pregnancy Concerns v. Mayor, 721 F.3d 264, 281 \n(4th Cir. 2013) (en banc) (citations and internal punctuation omitted).  This failure \namounts to clear error:  a district court “must refuse summary judgment where the \nnonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is \nessential to [its] opposition.’”  Baltimore Ctr., 721 F.3d at 280 (citation omitted).  \n15 \n\nFrom the outset and throughout the course of the litigation, Plaintiffs \nrequested discovery on their claims.   J.A. 32, 98-99, 106, 115-16, 120, 477-78, \n1094-1105, 1106-1234.  To this end, Plaintiffs drafted and included with their Rule \n56(d) affidavit model discovery that had been propounded in parallel proceedings, \nas well as draft supplemental discovery requests.  J.A. 1106-1234. \nIt is axiomatic that “the summary judgment process presupposes the \nexistence of an adequate record.”  Baltimore Ctr., 721 F.3d at 280 (citation \nomitted).  Yet in its decision, the District Court failed to address Plaintiffs’ Rule \n56(d) affidavit or their proposed discovery.  J.A. 1094-1105.  The District Court \nfurther failed to explain why it thought discovery was unnecessary prior to \ngranting summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims.    \nSecond, the District Court failed to consider or address Plaintiffs’ statement \nof material facts as to which there is a genuine dispute, J.A. 473-78, or the \nGovernment’s failure to provide the required statement of undisputed material \nfacts.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Such failure also required the District Court to deny \nthe Government’s motion: “where the movant fails to fulfill its initial burden of \nproviding admissible evidence of the material facts entitling it to summary \njudgment, summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary \nmatter is presented, for the non-movant is not required to rebut an insufficient \n16 \n\nshowing.”  Ray Commc’ns, Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc’ns, Inc., 673 F.3d 294, \n299 (4th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added and citation omitted).   \nThe District Court wholly failed to address Plaintiffs’ statement of material \nfacts in dispute.  J.A. 473-476.  Among other things, Plaintiffs’ statement \ncontained evidence of material facts (disputed by the Government) that:   \n(i) the decision to rescind DACA followed a long series of threats and \nderogatory statements by senior Government officials against \nLatinos, J.A. 46, 69-72, 76-79, 474; \n(ii) 93 percent of DACA beneficiaries were Latino, J.A. 46, 90, 474;  \n(iii) at the same time the Government rescinded DACA, it left in place \nnumerous other deferred action programs that did not impact \npredominantly Latino populations, J.A. 40-41, 58-59, 90, 475, \n1363-70, 1438-41;  \n(iv) there were procedural irregularities leading up to the DACA \nrescission, including suspension of renewal notices, failure to abide \nby the DACA program Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”), \nfailure to use notice and comment procedures, offering only the \nbarest of reasons for the decision, and the reversal of long-standing \nGovernment positions that DACA was lawful, J.A. 72-75, 81-82, \n85-87, 91-93, 474-76; 588-95; and  \n(v) the Government repeatedly promoted and represented to DACA \nrecipients prior to the rescission that they would be allowed to \nwork, study, travel internationally, live free from the fear of \ndeportation, and their application information would not be shared \nwith immigration enforcement officials, J.A. 42, 60-63, 86-87, 473. \nThis evidence, at a minimum, raised issues of material disputed facts that should \nhave precluded the District Court from granting summary judgment in favor of the \nGovernment. \n17 \n\nThird, at three critical points in its analysis, the District Court failed to view \n“the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the \nnonmoving party.”  Scinto v. Stansberry, 841 F.3d 219, 227 (4th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); cert. denied, sub nom, Phillip v. Scinto, 138 S. Ct. 447 (2017).  \na. An agency action is arbitrary and capricious if based on invidious criteria.  \nSee, e.g., Latecoere Int'l, Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Navy, 19 F.3d 1342, 1356 (11th \nCir.1994); Tummino v. Torti, 603 F. Supp. 2d 519, 542 (E.D.N.Y. 2009).  Evidence \nof invidious intent is also relevant to establishing a Fifth Amendment violation.  \nSee, e.g., Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 263-\n64 (1977).  The Complaint cites 22 separate statements by senior Administration \nofficials, including the President, threatening or otherwise revealing racial animus \nagainst Latinos in the period preceding the decision to rescind DACA.  J.A. 46, 69-\n72, 76-79.  All 22 statements are public statements and were gathered without the \nbenefit of discovery; Plaintiffs requested the opportunity to conduct discovery \nregarding non-public evidence of animus.  J.A. 32, 98-99, 106, 115-16, 120, 477-\n78, 1094-1105, 1106-1234.      \nNotwithstanding this evidence, the District Court “reject[ed] Plaintiffs’ \nreliance on the President’s . . . comments . . . to establish an ulterior motive,” \nobserving the President’s views “have moderated since his election,” and \nselectively citing comments made by the President that neither side put into \n18 \n\nevidence.  J.A. 1508-11.  The District Court’s selection of extra-record and post-\ndecision statements was not balanced and failed to consider notorious post-\ndecision statements from Government officials that are as incendiary as those cited \nin the Complaint.  And the District Court failed to draw the reasonable inference \nthat given these 22 public statements, discovery would have revealed more \nincendiary anti-Latino statements made in private.   \nb. Although the District Court acknowledged Plaintiffs’ evidence that \nDACA beneficiaries were overwhelmingly (93 percent) Latino, J.A. 1508, it \nignored Plaintiffs’ evidence that the Government allowed other deferred action \nprograms with higher Caucasian or Asian participation to continue.  J.A. 40-41, 46, \n58-59, 90, 474-75.  This evidence was central to Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim. \nc. The District Court failed to acknowledge or otherwise consider Plaintiffs’ \nevidence that there were substantial procedural irregularities in the decision to \nterminate DACA, including DHS’s (i) unannounced decision to suspend mailing of \nrenewal notices to DACA recipients several months before rescission; (ii) changed \nposition from its commitment not to share applicant information for enforcement \npurposes; (iii) failure to abide by the DACA program SOPs; (iv) offer of only the \nbarest of records to document the basis for the decision; and (v) abandonment of its \nlong-standing position on DACA’s legality.  J.A. 45-46, 72-75, 81-87, 91-93, 132-\n19 \n\n64, 474-76, 588-95, 602, 609, 714-977, 1092-93.  This evidence was central to \nPlaintiffs’ APA, Due Process, and estoppel claims. \nB. The District Court Misapplied the APA in Granting Summary \nJudgment on an Incomplete Administrative Record \nThe District Court granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ APA claims \nwithout addressing Plaintiffs’ contention that the Administrative Record was \nincomplete.  The APA requires that reviewing courts examine the “whole record.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 706.  A “District Court could not properly grant summary judgment \nwhen such a basic factual issue [as to the completeness of the Administrative \nRecord] was in dispute, without at least permitting plaintiffs some limited \ndiscovery to explore whether some portions of the full record were not supplied to \nthe Court . . . .  This is particularly true in a case like this, where there is a strong \nsuggestion that the record before the Court was not complete . . . .”  Dopico v. \nGoldschmidt, 687 F.2d 644, 654 (2d Cir. 1982); see also Citizens to Preserve \nOverton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 419-20 (1971) (reversing and \nremanding grant of summary judgment for further proceedings to complete the \nAdministrative Record); Walter O. Boswell Mem. Hosp. v. Heckler, 749 F.2d 788, \n792 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (same).   \nDHS certified that the Administrative Record was limited to only “non-\nprivileged documents that were actually considered by Elaine C. Duke . . . .”  J.A. \n127 (emphasis added).  Before the District Court, Plaintiffs noted deficiencies in \n20 \n\nthe Administrative Record demonstrating it was incomplete.  J.A. 531-34, 1094-\n1105.  In failing to address these deficiencies or ensure the record was complete, \nthe District Court misapplied the APA. \nFirst, the District Court misapplied the APA by failing to recognize that \nwhen an agency decisionmaker bases her decision “on the work and \nrecommendations of subordinates, those materials should be included [in the \nAdministrative Record] as well.”  Amfac Resorts, L.L.C. v. U.S. Dep’t of the \nInterior,143 F. Supp. 2d 7, 12 (D.D.C. 2001) (citing Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, \n994 F.2d 735, 739 (10th Cir. 1993)).  “[T]he mere fact that [those documents] were \nnot ultimately passed on to the final decisionmaker does not lead to the conclusion \nthat they were not before the agency.”  Styrene Info. and Research Center v. \nSebelius, 851 F. Supp. 2d 57, 64 (D.D.C. 2012).  Plaintiffs identified nineteen \ncurrent or former DHS employees and another six individuals from other agencies \nwho were involved in the decision to rescind DACA whose records were not \nincluded in the Administrative Record.  J.A. 1100.  The exclusion of any work or \nrecommendations from other agency officials who were involved in the decision to \nrescind DACA was enough to indicate that the Administrative Record was \nincomplete.   \nSecond, the District Court misapplied the APA by failing to recognize that \nan Administrative Record is not properly limited only to documents “actually \n21 \n\nconsidered” by the decisionmaker:  “[A]n agency may not exclude information on \nthe ground that it did not ‘rely’ on that information in its final decision.”  Tafas v. \nDudas, 530 F. Supp. 2d 786, 793 (E.D. Va. 2008) (citation omitted).  A contrary \nrule “might allow a party to withhold evidence unfavorable to its case . . . .”  \nWalter O. Boswell Mem’l Hosp., 749 F.2d at 792.  DHS cannot “skew the record \nby excluding unfavorable information but must produce the full record that was \nbefore the agency at the time the decision was made.”  Animal Legal Defense Fund \nv. Vilsack, 110 F. Supp. 3d 157, 159-60 (D.D.C. 2015) (citation omitted).  \nPlaintiffs demonstrated that the Administrative Record contained no materials \nexplaining prior decisions to maintain the DACA program or the Government’s \ndeparture from its prior view that DACA was legal.  J.A. 498, 1094-1105.    \nThird, the District Court misapplied the APA by failing to recognize that \nevidence of “bad faith or improper behavior by agency decisionmakers serves as a \nbasis for expanding the scope of review, and thereby the scope of discovery . . . .”  \nTummino v. Von Eschenbach, 427 F. Supp. 2d 212, 230 (E.D.N.Y. 2006); see also \nNat’l Audubon Soc. v. Hoffman, 132 F.3d 7, 14 (2d Cir. 1997).  In granting \nsummary judgment, the District Court failed to consider evidence of bad faith and \nimproper behavior by Government officials, including evidence of racial animus \n(e.g., the 22 statements referencing Latino as “criminals,” “thugs” and threatening \nexpulsion) and substantial departures from administrative practice (e.g., the \n22 \n\nreversal of long standing Government position that DACA was legal with de \nminimis reasoning).  J.A. 461-530, 1094-1105.   \nIn declining to permit the limited discovery requested by Plaintiffs to \nascertain whether the Administrative Record was complete, the District Court \nfailed to address any of these points.  The District Court then proceeded to conduct \nits review of an Administrative Record that, at the time, had been declared \nincomplete by two other courts.  J.A. 1099.1\nThe APA specifically requires judicial review to be conducted based on the \n“whole record.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.  The District Court prematurely granted summary \njudgment on a demonstrably incomplete Administrative Record.   \nAccordingly, this court should reverse and remand the case to allow for \ndiscovery and further proceedings. \n1 Although the Government sought mandamus, the orders to supplement the record \nwere affirmed by the appellate courts.  See In re Nielsen, No. 17-3345 (2d Cir. \nDec. 27, 2017); In re United States, 875 F.3d 1200, 1206 (9th Cir. 2017) (“the \nnotion that the head of a United States agency would decide to terminate a program \ngiving legal protection to roughly 800,000 people based on 256 pages of publicly \navailable documents is not credible”) (footnotes omitted), affirmed sub nom. In re: \nUnited States, 138 S. Ct. 443, 445 (2017) (directing District Court to rule on the \nGovernment’s 12(b)(1) jurisdictional motion and then to consider whether \n“amendments to the record are necessary and appropriate”).   \n23 \n\nII. The Court Erred in Granting Summary Judgment on the APA Claims \nThe District Court erred in granting summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ APA \nclaims.  First, the District Court failed to recognize that the Government’s action \nwas arbitrary and capricious.  Second, the District Court failed to conclude that the \nGovernment’s decision was a substantive determination requiring notice-and-\ncomment. \nA. The Rescission of DACA was Arbitrary and Capricious \nIn assessing the Government’s action, the District Court failed to properly \nanalyze whether the DACA rescission was arbitrary and capricious.  A reviewing \ncourt must set aside an agency action if it is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).2  This \nCourt has emphasized that “the arbitrary-and-capricious standard does not ‘reduce \njudicial review to a rubber stamp of agency action.’”  Friends of Back Bay v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 681 F.3d 581, 586-87 (4th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).  \nRather, the court “must ‘engage in a ‘searching and careful’ inquiry of the record,’ \n‘so that we may ‘consider whether the agency considered the relevant factors and \nwhether a clear error of judgment was made.’”  Id. (citation omitted). \n2 As discussed below, Plaintiffs also claim that the DACA rescission violates the \nEqual Protection and Due Process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment of the \nConstitution, and accordingly, as an unconstitutional agency action, it would also \nbe contrary to law in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n24 \n\nIt is axiomatic that “an agency must give adequate reasons for its decisions.”  \nJimenez-Cedillo v. Sessions, 885 F.3d 292, 297 (4th Cir. 2018).  In assessing \nwhether DHS “articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including . . . \n[a] rational connection,” the District Court should have:   \nconsider[ed]  whether  the  decision  was  based  on  a \nconsideration of the relevant factors . . . [including] on \nfactors which Congress has not intended it to consider, \nentirely  failed  to  consider  an  important  aspect  of  the \nproblem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs \ncounter  to  the  evidence  before  the  agency,  or  is  so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in \nview or the product of agency expertise.   \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n42-44 (1983) (“State Farm”).  In performing the review function, “reviewing \ncourt[s] should not attempt . . . to make up for such deficiencies” by supplying a \nreasoned basis for an agency action “that the agency itself has not given.”  State \nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43 (citation omitted).  If “an agency’s decision [is] unreasonable \nas a matter of law, it is likely to have been arbitrary and capricious.”  Friends of \nBack Bay, 681 F.3d at 587 (citation omitted).  And when an agency changes its \nposition, it “must ‘provide a reasoned explanation for the change . . . display[ing \nan] awareness that it is changing position and show that there are good reasons for \nthe new policy.’”  Jimenez-Cedillo, 885 F.3d at 298 (quoting Encino Motorcars, \nLLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125-26 (2016)).  A change in  policy further \nrequires the agency to address the “serious reliance interests” “engendered” “[by] \n25 \n\nlong standing policies.”  Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2126 (internal quotations \nand citation omitted).   \nThe District Court did not engage in any of this analysis, concluding that its \nscope of review was “narrow” and limited to determining whether there was a \n“satisfactory explanation” for the action.  J.A. 1505-07.   \nAs the other courts considering the DACA rescission have now concluded, it \nis clear that the decision to rescind DACA was arbitrary and capricious.  The \nGovernment: (1) failed entirely to consider important aspects of the problem, \nincluding the serious reliance interests created by the five-year old DACA program \nand the reversal of long-standing positions; (2) acted with improper motive; and \n(3) asserted a “litigation risk” rationale unsupported by the Administrative Record, \nincluding making factual and legal errors in concluding that “the DACA policy has \nthe same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, \n[and] it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results \nwith respect to DACA.”3  J.A. 379.  This Court should reverse and remand.  \n3 “DAPA” refers to the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful \nPermanent Residents program, which was proposed in November 2014 and \nenjoined in February 2015 before it was implemented.  Texas v. United States, 86 \nF. Supp. 3d 591, 677 (S.D. Tex. 2015). \n26 \n\n1. The District Court Failed to Consider DHS’s Change in \nPolicy and Failure to Account for the Significant Reliance \nInterests \nThe District Court ignored DHS’s failure to consider the existing reliance \ninterests affected by the rescission of DACA, contrary to Supreme Court \ndirectives.  Reliance interests are created where the regulation in question has been \nin place for more than a de minimis period of time and where the regulated \npopulation has structured activities “against [the] background understanding” of \nthe regulation.  Encinco Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2126.   Unless the Administrative \nRecord explicitly accounts “for the prospect that its prior policy may have \n‘engendered serious reliance interests,’” and the impact of the new policy on those \ninterests, the new policy must be set aside as arbitrary and capricious.  See \nJimenez-Cedillo, 885 F.3d at 299-300 (quoting Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at \n2126).   \nIn this case, the five-year-old DACA program has engendered serious \nreliance interests for the 800,000 direct DACA beneficiaries.  Since the \nestablishment of the DACA program in 2012, recipients have used their legal \nstatus to receive a host of benefits and to enjoy freedom from fear of deportation as \na result of their deferred action status.  The rescission decision immediately ended \nsome of those protections and benefits, while phasing out the rest, without \nconsidering the reliance interests created.  Employers, educational institutions, \n27 \n\ncommunities, and family members of DACA recipients similarly relied on the \nprogram.  See Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 279 F. Supp. 3d at 1045.  None of this \nis discussed in the Administrative Record. \nSimilarly, the Government had repeatedly affirmed the legality of DACA—\nin a 2014 Office of Legal Counsel opinion, in litigation in other courts, and in \ncorrespondence with Congress.  J.A. 132-164, 531-35, 1091-93.  At two earlier \njunctures in 2017, the Government decided to maintain the program.  J.A. 531-35, \n600-06, 607-10.  These actions promoted reliance on the program by DACA \nrecipients and others.  In such circumstances, reasoned agency decision-making \n“demand[s] that [the agency] display awareness that it is changing position” and \n“show that there are good reasons for the new policy.” FCC v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (emphasis in original and internal citation \nomitted).  See generally Greater Bos. Television Corp. v. FCC, 444 F.2d 841, 852 \n(D.C. Cir. 1970) (“[A]n agency changing its course must supply a reasoned \nanalysis . . . .”) (footnotes omitted).    \nSuch analysis is entirely lacking from the Administrative Record.  Neither \nthe Rescission Memo nor anything else in the Administrative Record cites any \nfacts or changed circumstances that supported the change.  Rather, the \nAdministration was faced with exactly the same facts available at the time the \n28 \n\nDACA program was established.  This is a textbook example of “arbitrary” agency \naction.   \nThe reliance interests and change from the prior policy were “important \naspect(s) of the problem,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, that the agency and the \nDistrict Court ignored. \n2. The District Court Failed to Consider the Evidence of Bad \nFaith and Animus Underlying the Decision to Rescind DACA \nThe District Court failed to consider much of the evidence of anti-Latino \nanimus by senior Administration officials that was presented in the Complaint.  \nThis error manifested itself in two ways.  First, as discussed above, the District \nCourt refused to compel the Government to produce, inter alia, any additional, \nnon-public evidence of animus that may have underlay the decision.  See Nat'l \nAudubon Soc. v. Hoffman, 132 F.3d 7, 14 (2d Cir. 1997) (“an extra-record \ninvestigation by the reviewing court may be appropriate when there has been a \nstrong showing in support of a claim of bad faith or improper behavior on the part \nof agency decisionmakers . . . .”). \nSecond, the District Court failed to evaluate appropriately the significance of \nthe evidence of discriminatory animus to the Government’s decision making.  For \npurposes of the APA, “proof of subjective bad faith by [agency decision-makers] \n. . . generally constitutes arbitrary and capricious action.” Tummino, 603 F. Supp. \n2d at 542 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (citations omitted) (collecting cases).  See also \n29 \n\nLatecoere Int'l, Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Navy, 19 F.3d 1342 (11th Cir. 1994) (finding \nagency action arbitrary when motivated by impermissible bias against a foreign \nfirm).  This understanding comports with the Supreme Court’s warning that “a bare \n[] desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate \ngovernment interest.”  U.S. Dept. of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 536 (1973).   \n3. The District Court Erred in Assessing DHS’s Purported \nRationale \nThe District Court erred in finding that the Government’s proffered rationale \nfor the rescission of DACA was “satisfactory” under the standard of State Farm.  \nThis is evident in two aspects of the District Court’s reasoning. \nFirst, the District Court cited a rationale for the decision— “litigation risk,” \nJ.A. 1506 —that is not fully analyzed in the Administrative Record.   \nThere is no evidence in the Administrative Record that the Government \nanalyzed the litigation risk associated with rescinding DACA.  The importance of \nthis missing analysis is underscored by the nine other lawsuits in which courts have \nfound the decision to rescind DACA to be or likely to be arbitrary and capricious.  \nAs another reviewing court observed, “it is simply not plausible that DHS reversed \npolicy between February and September because of one threatened lawsuit (never \nactually filed) without having generated any materials analyzing the lawsuit or \nother factors militating in favor of and against the switch in policy.”  Regents of \nUniv. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. C 17-05211, 2017 WL 4642324, \n30 \n\nat *4 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 17, 2017).  The Government’s decision to trade one lawsuit \nfor ten is another textbook example of arbitrariness.  See, e.g., Organized Vill. of \nKake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 970 (9th Cir. 2015).   \nMoreover, nothing in the Administrative Record analyzes the factors \nnecessary for an injunction to issue, despite the Government’s post-hoc assertion \nthat the rescission was warranted by the threat and disorder of an imminent, \nnationwide injunction.  In considering this rationale, the District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia properly concluded that “it strains credulity to suggest that [a] \ncourt would have enjoined DACA immediately and completely without allowing \nDHS any opportunity to wind the program down.”  NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at \n242.  Again, the District Court failed to address the deficient Administrative \nRecord.\nSecond, the District Court failed to consider that the DHS decision was \npredicated on a factual error and a series of mistaken legal conclusions.  An agency \n“action . . . may not stand if the agency has misconceived the law.”  SEC v. \nChenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94 (1943).  As referenced in the Rescission Memo, \nthe only source of legal analysis was the Sessions Letter.  J.A. 383.  The only \nguidance from Attorney General Sessions concluded, without further analysis, that \n“the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts \nrecognized as to DAPA.”  J.A. 379.  But the Attorney General’s conclusion is \n31 \n\npremised on a factual error:  no court ever found “constitutional defects” in DAPA.  \nThe Southern District of Texas enjoined DAPA solely based on the procedural \nAPA claims raised by plaintiffs.  It explicitly did not address “Plaintiffs’ likelihood \nof success on their substantive APA claims or their constitutional claims under the \nTake Care Clause/separation of powers doctrine.”  Texas v. United States, 86 F. \nSupp. 3d 591, 677 (S.D. Tex. 2015) (emphasis in original).  Nor did the Fifth \nCircuit find any constitutional defect in DAPA.  Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d \n134, 154 (5th Cir. 2015).\nThe District Court also failed to consider that the Attorney General’s \nconclusions were based on a faulty analogy between DACA and DAPA that would \nbe essential to any analysis of the legality of the DACA.  For example, the Fifth \nCircuit held that DAPA was contrary to the INA.  809 F.3d at 170--71, 182-83, \n190-92.  But “unlike DAPA, DACA has no analogue in the INA.”  NAACP, 298 F. \nSupp. 3d at 239 (finding it arbitrary and capricious not to consider distinctions \nbetween the programs) (internal quotations omitted).  Further, the Administrative \nRecord contains no evidence the Government ever considered that the five-year-\nold DACA program, unlike the DAPA program (enjoined pre-implementation), is \nlegally defensible on numerous grounds, including laches:  any litigant seeking to \nenjoin DACA would have to explain why they delayed commencing suit for five \nyears.  Cf. Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 279 F. Supp. 3d \n32 \n\n1011, 1044 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (criticizing Administrative Record’s lack of analysis \nof litigation defenses).  The Administrative Record is similarly devoid of any \nevidence the Government analyzed injunction prerequisites, such as how any \nplaintiff challenging DACA could claim immediate or irreparable harm, or why \nsuch harm would outweigh the competing interests of DACA recipients, their \nemployers, educational institutions, and communities.  See, e.g., Real Truth about \nObama v. FEC, 575 F.3d 342, 345-48 (4th Cir. 2009).  Yet the District Court \nignored these factors and failed to recognize that DHS’s “decision [was] \nunreasonable as a matter of law.”  Friends of Back Bay, 681 F.3d at 587.\nB. The DACA Rescission Required Notice and Comment \nThe District Court improperly granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ \nprocedural APA claims.  The rescission of DACA was a substantive rule requiring \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553.  The District \nCourt—without analyzing or citing any case law—incorrectly concluded that the \nDACA rescission was not a substantive rule because it “was not immediately \nbinding, but rather a statement of intended policy beginning March 5, 2018.”  J.A. \n1504.  The District Court failed to consider or properly apply the relevant legal \nstandard, concluding that because DACA was not promulgated through notice-and-\n33 \n\ncomment rulemaking, it could be rescinded.4  The DACA Rescission is a \nsubstantive determination subject to the notice-and-comment requirements of the \nAPA because:  (1) it established immediately binding norms for DHS; (2) it \nprecluded agency officials from exercising discretion to grant status previously \navailable under DACA; and (3) it had a substantive impact on DACA recipients.  \nSubstantive rules have “the force and effect of law,” impose new rights or \nduties, or have a substantive impact on those the agency seeks to regulate.  Chen \nZhou Chai v. Carroll, 48 F.3d 1331, 1340 (4th Cir. 1995) (citations omitted).  By \ncontrast, general statements of policy—which are exempt from notice-and-\ncomment requirements:  (1) do not establish a binding norm; (2) leave agency \nofficials the freedom to exercise their own discretion; and (3) do not have a \nsubstantive impact on those regulated.  See Chen Zhou Chai, 48 F.3d at 1341.  \nImportantly, “Congress expected, and the courts have held, that the various \nexceptions to the notice-and-comment provisions of section 553 will be narrowly \nconstrued and only reluctantly countenanced.”  N.C. Growers’ Ass’n, Inc. v. United \nFarm Workers, 702 F.3d 755, 767 (4th Cir. 2012) (citations omitted).  \n4  The manner of a policy’s promulgation does not determine whether its rescission \nrequires notice-and-comment.  See Consumer Energy Council v. F.E.R.C., 673 \nF.2d 425, 447 n.79 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (noting agencies cannot avoid notice-and-\ncomment by “merely by confessing that the regulations were defective . . . .”). \n34 \n\n1. The Rescission Memo Established an Immediately Binding \nNorm and Precluded Agency Officials From Exercising \nDiscretion \nThe District Court incorrectly found that the rescission of DACA “was not \nimmediately binding, but rather a statement of intended policy beginning March 5, \n2018.”  J.A. 1504-05.  This analysis failed to address the ways in which the \nrescission had an immediate impact on both DACA recipients and DACA-eligible \nindividuals beginning September 5, 2017. \nThe DACA rescission was an immediately binding rule that stripped DHS \nofficials of discretion.  A “critical factor” in determining whether an agency action \nconstitutes a substantive rule is the “extent to which the challenged [rule or \nregulation] leaves the agency, or its implementing official, free to exercise \ndiscretion to follow, or not follow, the [announced] policy in an individual case.”  \nMunicipality of Anchorage v. United States, 980 F.2d 1320, 1324 (9th Cir. 1992).  \nA rule “cabining . . . an agency’s prosecutorial discretion can in fact rise to the \nlevel of a substantive, legislative rule” when it “is in purpose or likely effect one \nthat narrowly limits administrative discretion . . . .”  Cmty. Nutrition Inst. v. Young,\n818 F.2d 943, 948 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (“CNI”) (per curiam) (emphasis added and \ninternal citation omitted); see also Alaska v. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 868 F.2d 441, \n447 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (finding “mandatory language cabining DOT’s enforcement \ndiscretion” created a substantive rule). \n35 \n\nIn evaluating whether an agency action is binding or constitutes policy, \ncourts need to carefully scrutinize the language chosen by an agency to determine \nwhether a rule has a present binding effect or conveys an agency’s tentative \nintention for the future, frequently citing the distinction between a “will” directive \nand a “may” option.5  The District Court failed to consider that, consistent with a \nbinding norm—and substantive rule—the Rescission Memo contained several non-\ndiscretionary mandates and stated that “effective immediately” DHS: \n• “Will reject all DACA initial requests and associated applications for \nEmployment Authorization Documents filed after the date of this \nmemorandum.” \n• “Will reject all DACA renewal requests and associated applications for \nEmployment Authorization filed outside of the parameters specified \nabove.”  \n• “Will not approve any new Form I-131 applications for advance parole \nunder standards associated with the DACA program . . . .” \n5 Compare Am. Bus Ass’n v. United States., 627 F.2d 525, 532 (D.C. Cir. 1980) \n(use of “will” indicates statement is binding) and McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. \nThomas, 838 F.2d 1317, 1320-21 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (“[t]he use of the word ‘will’ \nsuggests the rigor of a rule, not the pliancy of a policy”) and CNI, 818 F.2d at 946 \n(D.C. Cir. 1987) (“[W]e have . . . found decisive the choice between the words \n‘will’ and ‘may’”) with Chen Zhou Chai, 48 F.3d at 1341 (use of “may” “did not \ncreate a binding norm . . . .”) and Guardian Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Fed. Sav. & \nLoan Ins. Corp., 589 F.2d 658, 666 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (use of “may” indicates \n“general statement of policy”). \n36 \n\n• “Will administratively close all pending Form I-131 applications for \nadvance parole filed under standards associated with the DACA program \n. . . .” \nJ.A. 73-75, 383, 1007.   The Rescission Memo mandates how DHS officials must\nact.  They are forbidden from approving pending (or new) requests for advance \nparole from current DACA recipients and from considering case-by-case \nexceptions to any DACA recipient seeking a renewal.  As the D.C. Circuit \nobserved in CNI, “[t]his type of mandatory, definitive language is a powerful, even \npotentially dispositive, factor suggesting that [agency policy statements] are \nsubstantive rules.”  818 F.2d at 947.   \nThus, the Rescission Memo made substantive determination subject to the \nAPA’s notice-and-comment requirements.  \n2. The Rescission of DACA Had a Significant Substantive \nImpact on DACA Recipients \n  The District Court failed to analyze that the impact of the rescission on \nDACA recipients warranted notice and comment.  J.A. 1505.  Where an agency \naction “affect[s] individual rights and obligations” or has the “force of law,” it \nrequires notice and comment.  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 (1979); \nsee, e.g., Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 653 F.3d 1, 6 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011) (finding a TSA decision to screen airline passengers using \n“advanced imaging technology” in place of traditional “magnetometers” \n37 \n\nimplicated passengers’ privacy and had the “hallmark of a substantive rule” \nbecause it “substantively affect[ed] the public”). \nThe rescission of DACA substantively impacts its recipients and potential \nrecipients, who will no longer be able to travel, work, attend school, and live free \nfrom the risk of deportation.6  For example, the rescission requires that all pending \nrequests for advance parole be rejected, foreclosing the opportunity for any DACA \nrecipient to travel outside the United States.   \nThese impacts confirm that the Rescission Memo constituted a substantive \nrule subject to the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements.   \nIII. The Court Erred in Granting Summary Judgment on the Equal \nProtection Claim  \nThe District Court erred by granting summary judgment to the Government \non Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim based on an incorrect and overly deferential \nstandard of review.  It compounded that error by limiting its review to the \nAdministrative Record and misapplying the Rule 56 standard. \n6 See, e.g., Medina v. U.S. Dep’t Of Homeland Sec., No. C17-0218, 2018 WL \n2214085 at *11 (W.D. Wash. May 15, 2018) (DACA recipients “enjoy[] \nsignificant liberty and property interests, including the right to obtain lawful \nemployment authorization and the right to be considered lawfully present” and \nfinding the plaintiff would likely prevail on his procedural APA claim) (quoting \nTorres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, No. 17-cv-1840, 2018 WL 1757668, at \n*9 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 12, 2018)). \n38 \n\nIt is well-established that non-citizens, as well as citizens, may bring equal \nprotection claims.  See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210 (1982); Yick Wo v. \nHopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 368-69 (1886).  The equal protection claim in this case was \nbrought as a claim of intentional discrimination based on race, national origin, and \nethnicity.  See J.A. 90.   When “a prima facie case of discriminatory purpose [has \nbeen] made out, ‘the burden of proof shifts to the [Government] to rebut the \npresumption of unconstitutional action . . . .’”  Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, \n241 (1976) (citations omitted).   \nBuilding on Washington, the framework established by the Supreme Court \nin Vill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. 252, provides clear instructions as to what \nconstitutes evidence of discriminatory purpose.  In addition to disparate impact \nevidence, courts must undertake “a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and \ndirect evidence of intent as may be available.”  Id. at 266.  The non-exhaustive list \nof proper subjects for inquiry include: (1) “[t]he historical background of the \ndecision . . . particularly if it reveals a series of official actions taken for invidious \npurposes”; (2) “[t]he . . . sequence of events leading up [to] the challenged \ndecision”; (3) “[d]epartures from the normal procedural sequence”; and (4) “[t]he \nlegislative or administrative history . . . especially where there are contemporary \nstatements by members of the decision-making body, minutes of its meetings, or \nreports.  In some extraordinary instances the members might be called to the stand \n39 \n\nat trial to testify concerning the purpose of the official action . . . .”  Id. at 267-68 \n(citations omitted).  And once discriminatory purpose has been established and the \nburden shifts to the Government, this Court has held, “a classification based on . . . \nethnic origin—if established—requires the most rigid scrutiny, demanding a \ncompelling state interest for its justification.”  Sylvia Dev. Corp. v. Calvert Cty., \nMd., 48 F.3d 810, 820 (4th Cir. 1995) (discussing application of Arlington Heights \nto treatment of a Czech immigrant).  Other circuits have similarly applied the \nArlington Heights framework to non-citizens.  See, e.g., Spath v. NCAA, 728 F.2d \n25, 28-29 (1st Cir. 1984).   \nPlaintiffs’ allegations and evidence tracked this framework, as demonstrated \nby the following table:   \nSubject of Inquiry  Plaintiffs’ Evidence \nThe decision was motivated by racial  Plaintiffs cited the long series of threats \nanimus.  Specifically, “the legislative  and derogatory statements by senior \nor administrative history” of the  Government officials, including the \nDACA Rescission was littered with  President, the Attorney General, the \n“contemporary statements by  President’s Senior Advisor for Domestic \nmembers of the decision-making  Affairs, and the Director of Immigrations \nbody” reflecting racial animus.   and Customs Enforcement against \nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268.    Latinos – twenty-two examples of which \nwere cited in the Complaint.  J.A. 46, 69-\n72, 76-79, 474.   \n“[T]he historical background of the  Plaintiffs cited a series of twelve \n[DACA rescission]. . . reveal[ed] a  administration actions or policy \nseries of official actions taken for  statements leading up to the DACA \ninvidious purposes.”  Arlington  rescission, all of which manifest \nHeights 429 U.S. at 267.    Administration hostility to DACA \nrecipients or Latino immigrants.  J.A.  \n76-79. \n40 \n\nSubject of Inquiry  Plaintiffs’ Evidence \n“[T]he specific sequence of events  Plaintiffs cited procedural irregularities \nleading up [to] the [DACA  leading up to the DACA rescission, \nrescission]. . [including] [d]epartures  including DHS’s unannounced decision \nfrom the normal procedural sequence  to suspend the mailing of renewal \nalso might afford evidence that  notices to DACA recipients several \nimproper purposes are playing a  months before the termination, the \nrole.”  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at  reneging of the Government’s \n267.    commitment not to share DACA \napplicant information for enforcement \npurposes, DHS’s failure to abide by the \nDACA program SOPs, and offering only \nthe barest of records to document the \nbasis for the decision.  J.A. 45-46, 72-75, \n81-87, 91-93, 474-76, 559-99. \nBy presenting these allegations and evidence, Plaintiffs have met their burden to \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination, and under Washington and Arlington \nHeights, the burden of proof then should have shifted to the Government to \nadvance a sufficient non-discriminatory justification for the rescission.  \nThe District Court failed to apply the standard established in Arlington \nHeights and instead improperly evaluated the Rescission Memo under Kleindienst \nv. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972).  According to the District Court, its review was \nlimited to determining whether there was a “facially legitimate and bona fide” \nreason for Government action absent an “affirmative showing of bad faith.”  J.A. \n1510.  That was error.  The Mandel standard does not apply here:  Mandel and its \nprogeny are predicated on national security interests (to protect the United States \nfrom threats such as communism or terrorism) and involve challenges to denials of \n41 \n\npermission to enter the United States.  Id. at 754.  The Mandel Court held that, in \nthe special context of “policies and rules for exclusion of aliens,” it would not look \nbehind a facially legitimate national security reason offered by the government for \nits exercise of discretion not to provide a waiver.  Id. at 769.  As the Supreme \nCourt recently emphasized, Mandel “constrain[s] . . . inquiry into matters of  \n[alien] entry and national security . . .” Hawaii, No. 17-965, 2018 WL 3116337, at \n*21. \nThe District Court’s reliance on Mandel is misplaced: the Government cited \nno national security rationale for the DACA rescission.  Moreover, the Mandel \nCourt predicated its decision on the long-recognized distinction between \nexcludable aliens (those seeking entry at the border) and aliens already in the \nUnited States—like DACA recipients.  Aliens already residing in the United \nStates, even those without legal immigrant status, enjoy greater constitutional \nprotection than those seeking entry.  See, e.g., Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. \nMezei, 345 U.S. 206, 212 (1953) (“[i]t is true that aliens who have once passed \nthrough our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings \nconforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of \nlaw”).  See also Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 115-16 (1976) \n(exclusion of lawful aliens from civil service positions violated equal protection);\n42 \n\nPlyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210 (1982) (state may not deny undocumented \nschool-age children free education provided to citizens). \nNotably, the Government did not rely in either its briefing or argument on \nMandel.7  Nor does this Circuit’s decision in IRAP, 883 F.3d at 264, require the \napplication of Mandel, as the District Court incorrectly concluded.  J.A. 1508-09.   \nIRAP, like Mandel, concerned the Government’s invocation of a national security \nrationale to bar classes of aliens outside the United States seeking entry into the \nUnited States, not the rights of persons already in the United States when the \nGovernment does not invoke national security considerations.  The Supreme Court \nemphasized the importance of this distinction in Trump v. Hawaii, No. 17-965, \n2018 WL 3116337.  The District Court failed to address that critical distinction, \nand in doing so, failed to apply the correct standard of review.   \nThe District Court also incorrectly concluded that its review of the Equal \nProtection claim was necessarily limited to the Administrative Record.  It stated:  \nThe  Administrative  Record—the  basis  from  which  the \nCourt must make its judicial review—does not support \nthe notion that [the Government] was targeting a subset \n7 The Government urged the District Court to analyze the matter as a “selective \nprosecution” claim under United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456 (1996).  The \nDistrict Court properly rejected this argument.  As the District Court noted, (i) the \ndecision to rescind DACA was not justified as an exercise in prosecutorial \ndiscretion, and (ii) the Armstrong court held that “the decision to prosecute may \nnot be based on an unjustifiable standard such as race” and Plaintiffs had averred \nrace discrimination.  J.A. 1508. \n43 \n\nof the immigrant population, and it does not support any \nsupposition  that  the  decision  was  derived  on  a  racial \nanimus.  That is where the judicial inquiry should end.  \nThe Court rejects Plaintiffs’ reliance on the President’s \nmisguided,  inconsistent,  and  occasionally  irrational \ncomments  made  to  the  media  to  establish  an  ulterior \nmotive.  See generally Kleindienst . . .   \nJ.A. 1508-09.  The District Court notably failed to cite any authority for the \nproposition that its consideration of the Equal Protection claim should be limited to \nthe Administrative Record.  Nor could it.  Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim was \nnot an APA claim, and it therefore is not subject to the APA’s requirement that the \nDistrict Court consider only the Administrative Record.  Consequently, Plaintiffs \nshould have been afforded discovery.  See, e.g., Puerto Rico Pub. Hous. Admin. v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 59 F. Supp. 2d 310, 328 (D. P.R. 1999) (“The \nSupreme Court has held that a plaintiff who is entitled to judicial review of its \nconstitutional claims under the APA is entitled to discovery in connection with \nthose claims”) (citing Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 604 (1988)); Rydeen v. \nQuigg, 748 F. Supp. 900, 905-06 (D.D.C. 1990) (considering extra-record \naffidavits because “[w]hen reviewing constitutional challenges to agency \ndecisionmaking, courts make an independent assessment of the facts and the law”) \n(citation omitted); aff’d, 937 F.2d 623 (Fed. Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 205 U.S. 1075 \n(1992). \n44 \n\nThe District Court further erred in holding that under Mandel and IRAP, \nPlaintiffs had to meet a “heavy burden” to make an “affirmative showing of bad \nfaith” with “particularity” and “undisputed evidence” before a court could look \nbehind the DACA rescission for “discriminatory motivation.”   J.A. 1509-10.  In so \nruling, the District Court concluded that IRAP “implicit[ly]” held that Mandel\ncould be overcome only on a showing of “a direct nexus between the \ndiscriminatory statements and the executive action in question in that case,” and \nthat in contrast to IRAP, Plaintiffs “cannot here make a similarly substantial \nshowing” because the President’s statements “have moderated since his election,” \nciting statements by the President presented in a January 25, 2018 article.  J.A. \n1510-11.  But this Court never held, implicitly or otherwise, that a “direct nexus” \nwas required between discriminatory statements and the challenged action.   \nRegardless, where the President “regularly and repeatedly disparaged Islam \nas a religion and repeatedly proposed banning Muslims from the United States,” \nJ.A. 1510, here the Plaintiffs documented a series of statements from the President \nthat “regularly and repeatedly disparaged” Latinos in direct connection (often in \nthe same sentence) with statements directly proposing to exclude or remove \nLatinos from the country.  See J.A. 46, 69-72 (references to Latinos as “criminals,” \n“rapists,” “thugs,” “bad hombres,” and “true animals” in conjunction with \nstatements “we’re going to get them out,” “they are finished,” and “we’re getting \n45 \n\nthem out”).  It is hard to imagine a closer nexus between discriminatory animus \nand policy.  \nMoreover, the District Court failed to view “facts and [] reasonable \ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,” Scinto, \n841 F.3d 227, and it construed allegations and evidence in favor of the \nGovernment.  This error is clearest in the Court’s evaluation of the 22 separate, \ndetailed statements made by senior Administration officials threatening or \notherwise revealing racial animus against Latinos leading up to the September 5 \ndecision to rescind DACA.  J.A. 46, 69-72, 76-79.8  Such well-pled factual \nallegations must be accepted as true.  Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Matkari, 7 F.3d 1130, \n1134 (4th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1197 (1994).  These statements make \nout a prima facie case for an equal protection claim.  And what reasonable \ninferences can be drawn from the fact that senior Administration officials made 22 \nseparate public statements of anti-Latino animus?  Why is it not reasonable to infer \nthat they made far more incendiary statements outside the public view?   \nBased on these public statements, Plaintiffs requested the opportunity to \nconduct discovery regarding non-public evidence of animus, J.A. 98-99, 106, 115-\n16, 120, 477-78, 1094-1105, 1106-1234, 1334-41.  But rather than credit Plaintiffs’ \n8 Similarly, the District Court ignored other key facts, including Plaintiffs’ \nevidence that the Government allowed other deferred action programs with higher \nCaucasian or Asian participation to continue, J.A. 40-41, 46, 58-59, 90, 474-75. \n46 \n\nallegations, the District Court—relying on evidence neither of the parties put \nbefore it—found the President’s views “have moderated since his election.”  J.A. \n1510.  In so failing to view all facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the \nDistrict Court plainly misapplied Rule 56.   \nFor these reasons, the District Court erred in granting summary judgment on \nPlaintiffs’ equal protection claim. \nIV. The Court Erred in Granting Summary Judgment on the Due Process \nClaims \nThe District Court improperly granted summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ Due \nProcess claims.  Plaintiffs alleged detailed facts establishing violations of \nprocedural and substantive due process.  J.A. 85-89.  The District Court failed to \ncredit Plaintiffs’ allegations and evidence regarding the benefits conferred to \nDACA recipients, and it misapplied precedent in concluding that due process did \nnot apply to their deprivation.  And the facts establish outrageous conduct \nsufficient to violate substantive due process.   \nA. The District Court Erred in Dismissing the Procedural Due \nProcess Claims \nThe District Court erred in in failing to recognize that the Government, \nthrough its actions, conferred rights and benefits on DACA recipients.  The District \nCourt further erred in concluding that such benefits could be stripped en masse \nwithout affording any process. \n47 \n\nFirst, the District Court failed to credit Plaintiffs’ allegations and evidence—\nas it must on a dispositive motion—that the Government had conferred on DACA \nrecipients legally protected liberty and property interests.   \nSuch interests protected by the Due Process Clause “are defined by existing \nrules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law— \nrules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of \nentitlement to those benefits.”  Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. \n564, 577 (1972).  The source of such rights can be a statute, a regulation, \n“[e]xplicit contractual provisions,” “implied” agreements, or “rules or mutually \nexplicit understandings.”  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601-02 (1972); see \nalso Richardson v. Town of Eastover, 922 F.2d 1152, 1157 (4th Cir. 1991) (an \n“entitlement . . . may be implied . . . from policies, practices, and understandings . . \n. .”). \nDACA recipients were afforded — and are now being deprived of — the \nability to obtain lawful employment authorization, to travel internationally, to \npursue education, to pay and receive benefits such as Social Security, to open bank \naccounts, and to be considered lawfully present.  Such benefits, when conferred by \nthe Government, are precisely the types of entitlements covered by Due Process.  \nRoth, 408 U.S. at 572 (1972); Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 431 \n(1982) (“Entitlement[s — rights to] other things like high school education, \n48 \n\ngovernment employment, and welfare benefits — are grounded in the law and \ncannot be removed except for cause”). \nThe rules, guidelines, and Government communications created an “explicit \nunderstanding” regarding the benefits conferred by DACA.  To induce applicants \nto participate in DACA, the Government promoted the right to work (authorized \nunder 8 C.F.R. § 274a(a)(11) & (c)(14)), to travel internationally (authorized under \n8 U.S.C. § 212(d)(5)(A)), and to attend educational institutions and apply for \nfinancial assistance (authorized under 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, 28 C.F.R. § \n42.104(b)(2), and 34 C.F.R. § 100.3(b)(2)).  J.A. 60-68, 86.  The Government \nfurther promoted the right to participate in Social Security and Medicare \n(authorized under 8 U.S.C. § 1611(b)(2) & (b)(3) and 8 U.S.C. § 1621(d)) and to \nbe considered “lawfully present” in the United States (authorized under 8 C.F.R. § \n109.1). J.A. 62.  The Government unequivocally promised not to share sensitive \npersonal information with immigration enforcement authorities.  J.A. 63-68.   \nPlaintiffs also cited official statements from senior Government officials that \nthese rights and benefits “upon which DACA applicants most assuredly relied, \nmust continue to be honored.”  J.A. 68-69, 1091-93.  The Complaint further \nspecifically identified individuals who have availed themselves of these benefits, \nand who have averred that their enjoyment of these benefits was stripped away \nwhen DACA was rescinded.  J.A. 60-62, 73-75, 1237-39, 1242-45, 1248-49.   \n49 \n\nPlaintiffs further presented evidence that the conferring of these benefits was \nnon-discretionary.  The Complaint cited the eligibility criteria in the 2012 DACA \nMemorandum, which instructed DHS agents not to apprehend or place eligible \npersons into removal proceedings.  J.A. 59, 63.  It averred that DACA required \nICE agents to use a checklist to determine whether individuals qualified for \nDACA; such agents were required to follow the 150-page DACA SOP manual; \nthose guidelines were “applicable to all personnel performing adjudicative \nfunctions and the procedures to be followed [were] not discretionary.”  J.A. 43, 63, \n67-68, 714-986.  See also Coyotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp. 3d 1328, 1334 (N.D. Ga. \n2017); Gonzales Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 17-cv-1840, 2017 WL \n4340385, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017) (finding that DACA’s SOPs are “non-\ndiscretionary”).  Such “substantive limitation on the discretion” of government \nofficials creates a “protectable property interest.”  Wedges/Ledges of Cal., Inc. v. \nCity of Phoenix, Ariz., 24 F.3d 56, 64 (9th Cir. 1994).  And Plaintiffs sought to \nbolster this evidence by requesting targeted discovery regarding these benefits.  \nJ.A. 1097, 1107-23, 1115-17, 1128-29. \nThe District Court incorrectly found that “DACA did not create an \nentitlement” because “the exercise or restraint of prosecutorial discretion is not \ntraditionally the sort of government action that creates substantive rights.”  J.A. \n1512-13.  The District Court also cited the disclaimer in the DACA Memo that the \n50 \n\nDACA program it “confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to \ncitizenship.”  J.A. 1512.   \nIn adopting the Government’s characterization of the benefits, the District \nCourt misapplied the appropriate legal standard:  a court must independently \nreview a government program to determine whether a protectable interest exists.  \nSee Jerri’s Ceramic Arts, Inc. v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 874 F.2d 205, \n207 (4th Cir. 1989).  Moreover, the District Court failed to consider that, as alleged \nin the Complaint, Congress and the federal government did confer rights of which \nPlaintiffs were deprived.  Nor did it consider Plaintiffs’ allegations that, \nnotwithstanding the disclaimer, the Government repeatedly promoted these rights \nas independent benefits.  See J.A. 42-43, 60-62, 64-65.  In so doing, the District \nCourt improperly failed to consider these “facts and the reasonable inferences \ntherefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Scinto, 841 F.3d at \n227 (internal quotation omitted).   \nSecond, the District Court misconstrued the Complaint and the law when it \nconcluded “procedural due process only applies to individualized deprivations, not \npolicy-based deprivations for an entire class.”  J.A. 1512 (citing Bi-Metallic Inv. \nCo. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 239 U.S. 441, 445 (1915)).  The Complaint and \ndeclarations submitted in opposition to summary judgment included specific \nallegations by specific individuals of the benefits they had lost.  J.A. 50-57, 73-75, \n51 \n\n1237-39, 1242-45, 1248-49.  And in holding that Bi-Metallic obviated the need for \nprocess, the Court disregarded extensive authority holding that Due Process is \nrequired for revocation of rights and benefits.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, \n333 (1976). \nThe District Court failed to address that individual Plaintiffs had been \nstripped of benefits without notice or any opportunity to be heard, J.A. 50-57, 73-\n75, 86, in contravention of the DACA SOPs.  J.A. 43, 63, 67-68, 86.  For example, \nPlaintiffs Brenda Moreno Martinez and Nathaly Uribe Robdelo had pending \napplications for permission to travel internationally that were summarily revoked.  \nJ.A. 52-53, 55, 73-75.  Likewise, Plaintiff Annabelle Martinez Herra was told her \nwork authorization could not be renewed.  J.A. 56, 74.  In granting summary \njudgment, the District Court failed to consider any of these individual deprivations, \nor the other individuals discussed in the record.  J.A. 1237-39, 1242-45, 1248-49. \nThe District Court’s reliance on Bi-Metallic also was error.  By its terms, Bi-\nMetallic applies only when a legislature—not an agency—enacts a statute of \ngeneral application, such that the District Court’s observation Bi-Metallic means \nno process is due where “the political process serves as an effective alternative,” \nJ.A. 1512, makes no sense as applied to this case.  The rescission of DACA was an \nadministrative action, taken without the opportunity for public comment, and there \nwas no “political process that served as an effective alternative.”   \n52 \n\nMoreover, DACA is not a program of general application.  It requires \nindividual application, approval, and enrollment, only after which participants are \nentitled to the rights and benefits conferred by the program.  In comparable \ncircumstances, courts have concluded that en masse deprivations of rights by an \nagency are subject to Due Process claims.  See, e.g., Kapps v. Wings, 404 F.3d 105, \n118 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that where administrator’s rules arbitrarily denied \ngroup of applicants the right to appeal, applicants were entitled to individualized \nnotice and an opportunity to be heard). \nThe law is unequivocal:  it is unconstitutional to deprive any individual, \nincluding the Plaintiffs, of a protected right without due process of law.  Kerr v. \nMarshall Univ. Bd. of Governors, 824 F.3d 62, 80 (4th Cir. 2016).  Such \nprocedural due process “[a]t a minimum . . . requires notice and some opportunity \nto be heard.”  Mallette v. Arlington Cty. Employees’ Supplemental Ret. Sys. II, 91 \nF.3d 630, 640 (4th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted).  The District Court misapplied the \nlaw and should be reversed. \nB. The District Court Failed to Recognize That the Rescission of \nDACA and Changes to DHS’s Information-Sharing Policy \nViolated the Substantive Protections of the Due Process Clause \nThe District Court erred in granting summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process claim.  A denial of fundamental fairness may constitute a \nviolation of substantive due process rights when it is so egregious or so outrageous \n53 \n\nas to “shock the contemporary conscience.”  J.A. 1514.  Governmental speech and \nactions based on animus satisfy this standard.  See generally Masterpiece \nCakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm’n, No. 16-111, __ S.Ct. __, 2018 WL \n2465172, at *12 (S. Ct. June 4, 2018) (“official expressions of hostility . . . were \ninconsistent with what the [Constitution] requires”); Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. \n620, 634-35 (1996) (“[D]esire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot \nconstitute a legitimate governmental interest.”) (emphasis in original).   \nAs discussed above, the 22 statements of anti-Latino bias cited in the \nComplaint—threats to expel Latino immigrants because they are “criminals,” \n“thugs,” “rapists,” and “bad hombres” (J.A. 69-72) that preceded the DACA \nrescission evidence racial animus—should shock the conscience of any reasonable \nobserver because they are ‘‘intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any \ngovernment interest.” Hawkins v. Freeman, 195 F.3d 732, 738, 742 (4th Cir. 1999) \n(emphasis in original and citation omitted).  Taken as true, as they must be on a \nmotion for summary judgment, such conduct is unjustifiable by any legitimate \ngovernment interest.   \nThe District Court further erred in failing entirely to address Plaintiffs’ \nallegations that the Government’s reneging on its promise not to share DACA \napplicant data with enforcement authorities implicates Due Process.  As the \nDistrict Court found elsewhere in its decision, Plaintiffs provided evidence that \n54 \n\n“the Government promised not to transfer or use the information gathered from \nDreamers for immigration enforcement,” J.A. 713-977, 1028-1093, 1515, and the \nGovernment refused to provide any assurance that it would adhere to this promise.  \nThe District Court further observed that “the government, having induced these \nimmigrants to share their personal information under the guise of immigration \nprotections, could now use that same information to track and remove them,” J.A. \n1516, and accurately characterized such action as “affirmative misconduct.”  The \nDistrict Court, however, failed to address Plaintiffs’ claim that such misconduct \nviolates Plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights.  See J.A. 88-89.  To renege on \nthat promise to DACA applicants is egregious, outrageous, and “shock[s] the \nconscience . . . .”  Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.

Under this policy, certain noncitizens who came \nto the United States as children could receive deferred action—a decision forbearing their \nremoval from the country.  Hundreds of thousands of individuals, including those who \nappear as Plaintiffs in these appeals, applied for and received grants of deferred action \nunder DACA.   \nIn 2017, the Acting  Secretary  of Homeland Security  rescinded  DACA,  which \nprompted a flurry of lawsuits across the country challenging the action.  Plaintiffs in \nthese appeals (a group of individuals and organizations) allege that the government’s \ndecision to rescind DACA (and its changes to policies governing the use of information \nprovided by DACA applicants) violates the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as \nwell as the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq., and common \nlaw principles of estoppel.   \n  On the government’s motion for summary judgment, the district court determined \nthat Plaintiffs’ challenges were subject to judicial review, that the rescission of DACA \nand changes to the government’s policies on use of DACA applicant information did not \nviolate the APA, that the constitutional claims were without merit, and that DACA’s \nrescission  did  not  violate  principles  of  estoppel.    The court,  however,  ordered  the \ngovernment (on grounds of estoppel) to comply with the policies promulgated in 2012 on \nthe use of information provided by DACA applicants and enjoined it from altering these \npolicies.   \n4 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 5 of 60\n  As we explain, we agree with the district  court that Plaintiffs’ challenges are \nsubject to judicial review.  We also agree with the district court that the government’s \ndecision to rescind DACA did not require notice and comment under the APA.  But the \ndecision  nonetheless  violated the  APA  because—on  the  administrative  record  before \nus—it was not adequately explained and thus was arbitrary and capricious.  We also \nconclude that the district court erred in ordering the government to comply  with its \npolicies promulgated in 2012 on the use of information provided by DACA applicants \nand enjoining it from altering those policies.   \nGiven our resolution, we decline, under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, to \ndecide whether Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment rights were violated.  Nor do we address \nPlaintiffs’  remaining  arguments  challenging  the  district  court’s  grant  of  summary \njudgment.   \n \nI. \nA. \n  Before turning to the record material, some context is in order.  The Secretary of \nHomeland  Security  is  “charged  with  the  administration  and  enforcement”  of  the \nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”).    8  U.S.C.  § 1103(a)(1).    One  of  the \nenforcement tools available under the INA is the removal of aliens from the United \nStates.  “Aliens may be removed if they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have been \nconvicted of certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law.”  Arizona v. United \n5 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 6 of 60\nStates, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012); see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a), 1227(a) (listing classes of \ndeportable and inadmissible aliens).   \nBecause  of  the  “practical  fact,”  however,  that  the  government  can’t  possibly \nremove all such aliens, the Secretary has discretion to prioritize the removal of some and \nto deprioritize the removal of others.  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015); \nsee 6 U.S.C. § 202(5) (charging the Secretary of Homeland Security with “[e]stablishing \nnational immigration enforcement policies and priorities”).  One form of discretion the \ngovernment  exercises  is  deferred  action,  which  “is  a  decision  by  Executive  Branch \nofficials  not  to  pursue  deportation  proceedings  against  an  individual  or  class  of \nindividuals otherwise eligible for removal from this country.”  Regents of the Univ. of \nCal. v. DHS, 908 F.3d 476, 487 (9th Cir. 2018), petition for cert. filed, 87 U.S.L.W. 3201 \n(U.S. Nov. 5 & 19, 2018) (No. 18-587).   \nImmigration authorities have granted deferred action and related forms of relief \nfrom deportation or removal since at least the early 1960s.  See id. at 487-89;  The \nDepartment of Homeland Security’s Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens \nUnlawfully Present in the United States and to Defer Removal of Others, 38 Op. O.L.C. \n____,  2014  WL  10788677,  at  *10-13  (Nov.  19,  2014)  (“2014  OLC  Opinion”)1 \n                                              \n1 The Office of Legal Counsel, or OLC, is an office within the U.S. Department of \nJustice that drafts legal opinions of the Attorney General and provides its own written \nopinions  and  other  advice  in  response  to  requests  from  various  agencies  within  the \nexecutive branch.  See 28 U.S.C. § 512 (providing that agency heads may seek legal \nadvice  from  the  Attorney  General);  28  C.F.R.  § 0.25  (delegating  Attorney  General’s \nauthority to render legal advice to OLC); “Office of Legal Counsel,” The United States \nDepartment of Justice, https://www.justice.gov/olc (saved as ECF opinion attachment).  \n(Continued) \n6 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 7 of 60\n(addressing the Department’s practices of granting deferred action ad hoc and through \nbroad policies making relief from removal available to particular groups of aliens).  The \nSupreme  Court  also  has  recognized  deferred  action  by  name,  describing  it  as  the \nexecutive  branch’s  “regular  practice . . . of  exercising . . . discretion  for  humanitarian \nreasons or simply for its own convenience.”  Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination \nComm. (“AAADC”), 525 U.S. 471, 484 (1999).   \nB. \n  Turning now to the record material, the essential undisputed facts are as follows.  \nTo ensure government resources were not spent on the “low priority cases” of “certain \nyoung people who were brought to [the United States] as children and know only this \ncountry  as  home,”  J.A.  129,  then  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  Janet  Napolitano \nannounced  in  a  June  15,  2012,  memorandum  the  policy  that  has  become  known  as \nDACA.  The DACA Memo made renewable two-year terms of deferred action from \nremoval and authorization for employment  available to individuals who came to the \nUnited  States  as  children,  satisfied  certain  other  eligibility  criteria,2  and  passed \nbackground checks.   \n                                              \n \nAlthough  not  binding  on  courts,  OLC  opinions  “reflect[]  the  legal  position  of  the \nexecutive branch” and “are generally viewed as providing binding interpretive guidance \nfor executive agencies.”  United States v. Arizona, 641 F.3d 339, 385 n.16 (9th Cir. 2011) \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (Bea, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), \naff’d in part, rev’d in part, 567 U.S. 387 (2012).   \n2 In its original form, deferred action was available to individuals who were under \nage 16 when they came to the United States, were not above age 30, had continuously \n(Continued) \n7 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 8 of 60\nTo be considered for deferred action under DACA, applicants had to submit to \nbiometric screening and provide extensive personal information to the Department of \nHomeland Security.  The Department informed applicants that the information provided \nwas  “protected  from  disclosure . . . for  the  purpose  of  immigration  enforcement \nproceedings” unless the requestor met criteria for commencement of removal proceedings \nor referral to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a determination whether to \ncommence removal proceedings.3  J.A. 1004.  The Department warned, however, that \nthese policies could be “modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice” \nand  were  “not  intended  to”  and  did  not  “create  any  right  or  benefit,  substantive  or \nprocedural, enforceable at law by any party.”  Id.   \nThe  DACA  Memo  made  clear  that  it  “confer[red]  no  substantive  right, \nimmigration status[,] or pathway to citizenship.”  J.A. 131.  DACA recipients, however, \nwere eligible to receive a host of other benefits under preexisting statutes and regulations, \nincluding advance parole allowing reentry  into the United States after travel abroad, \nsocial  security  benefits,  and  certain  forms  of  public  assistance.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§§ 1182(d)(5)(A), 1611(b)(1), 1621(b)(1), (d); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1.3(a)(4)(vi), 212.5.  DACA \n                                              \n \nresided in the United States for at least five years preceding June 15, 2012, and were \npresent in the country on June 15, 2012, and satisfied certain other requirements relative \nto public safety and education or military service.   \n3 Separately, the Department noted that the information provided could be shared \nwith national security and law enforcement agencies “for purposes other than removal.”  \nJ.A. 1004.   \n8 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 9 of 60\nrecipients  also  were  eligible  to  receive  employment  authorization  on  a  showing  of \neconomic necessity.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).   \n  In November 2014, then Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson announced \na separate deferred action policy for certain parents of United States citizens and lawful \npermanent residents that became known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \n(“DAPA”).4    The  DAPA  memorandum  also  expanded  DACA  by  (1)  extending  the \ndeferred  action  and  employment  authorization  terms  from  two  to  three  years;  (2) \nremoving  the  “age  cap”  that  previously  excluded  certain  individuals  from  DACA \neligibility; and (3) reducing the period of time that someone needed to be physically \npresent in the United States to be eligible for DACA.  See J.A. 167-68.   \nA coalition of states led by Texas sued to block implementation of the DAPA \npolicy (and its proposed expansions to DACA) on the grounds that it violated the APA \nand  the  Take  Care  Clause  of  the  Constitution,  U.S.  Const.  art.  II,  § 3  (the  “Texas \nlitigation”).  See Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 604 & n.1, 607 (S.D. Tex. \n2015).  The district court in that case granted injunctive relief, id. at 671-72, 677-78 & \nn.111, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 178-79, 186, \n                                              \n4 The 2014 OLC Opinion concluded that DAPA “would constitute a permissible \nexercise of [the Department of Homeland Security]’s enforcement discretion under the \nINA.”  J.A. 162; 2014 WL 10788677, at *23.  While the opinion doesn’t directly address \nthe Department’s authority to implement DACA, it does recount that, before DACA was \nannounced,  the  OLC  had  “orally  advised”  the  Department  that  the  policy  would  be \npermissible  “provided  that  immigration  officials  retained  discretion  to  evaluate  each \napplication on an individualized basis.”  J.A. 149 n.8; 2014 WL 10788677, at *13 n.8.   \n9 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 10 of 60\n188 (5th Cir. 2015).  The Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote.  United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per curiam).   \n  In June 2017 (approximately five months after the Trump administration took \noffice), then Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly rescinded DAPA but left in \nplace  DACA  and  the  deferred  action  relief  and  employment  authorizations  granted \nbetween the issuance of the DAPA Memo and the district court’s decision in the Texas \nlitigation.   \n  On September 4, 2017, Attorney General Jefferson Sessions wrote to then Acting \nSecretary  Elaine  Duke,  advising  her  to  rescind  DACA.    According  to  the  Attorney \nGeneral:   \nDACA was effectuated by the previous administration through executive \naction, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, \nafter Congress’ repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have \naccomplished  a  similar  result.    Such  an  open-ended  circumvention  of \nimmigration  laws  was  an  unconstitutional  exercise  of  authority  by  the \nExecutive  Branch.    The  related . . . DAPA . . . policy  was  enjoined  on  a \nnationwide basis in a decision affirmed by the Fifth Circuit on the basis of \nmultiple  legal  grounds  and  then  by  the  Supreme  Court  by  an  equally \ndivided  vote. . . . Because  the  DACA  policy  has  the  same  legal  and \nconstitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that \npotentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to \nDACA.[5]   \n \nIn light of the costs and burdens that will be imposed on DHS associated \nwith rescinding this policy, DHS should consider an orderly and efficient \nwind-down process.   \n                                              \n5 Plaintiffs in the Texas litigation had written to General Sessions in June 2017, \nrequesting that the Secretary of Homeland Security rescind DACA and prohibit new \ngrants and renewals of deferred action.  The letter warned that, if the Executive Branch \nfailed to so act, plaintiffs there would amend their complaint to challenge DACA.   \n10 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 11 of 60\nJ.A. 379 (internal citations omitted).   \n  The next day, Acting Secretary Duke rescinded DACA and instructed Department \npersonnel to “wind-down” the policy.  J.A. 380, 383.  The Secretary’s Rescission Memo \nrecounts in a “Background” section the DACA and DAPA policies, the Texas litigation, \nSecretary Kelly’s rescission of DAPA, the letter to Attorney General Sessions from the \nplaintiffs  in  the  Texas  litigation,  and  General  Sessions’s  September  4  letter.  \nThe Rescission Memo then states:   \nTaking  into  consideration  the  Supreme  Court’s  and  the  Fifth  Circuit’s \nrulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017[,] letter from \nthe Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012[,] DACA program \nshould be terminated.   \n \nJ.A. 383.   \nThe Rescission Memo—which issued without notice or an opportunity for public \ncomment—did not end DACA outright.   Rather, it allowed for  a case-by-case basis \nadjudication  of  initial  applications  for  deferred  action  and  employment  authorization \naccepted by September 5, 2017, and renewal requests accepted by October 5, 2017, from \ncurrent DACA beneficiaries whose benefits would expire between September 5, 2017, \nand March 5, 2018.   \nThe  Memo  stated  that the  Department  would  not  terminate  existing  grants  of \ndeferred  action  and  employment  authorization  under  DACA  “solely  based  on  the \ndirectives”  in  the  Memo  and  would  “generally  honor”  approved  applications  for \nadvanced parole.  Id.  But it made clear that the Department would reject all other DACA \napplications, including initial applications filed after September 5, 2017, and all pending \n11 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 12 of 60\nand future applications for advance parole under DACA.  Id.  The Memo, however, \nexplicitly  placed  “no  limitations”  on  the  Department’s  “otherwise  lawful \nenforcement . . . prerogatives.”  J.A. 384.   \n  The Department also announced that once an individual’s deferred action under \nDACA expired, information provided by applicants would not be “proactively provided \nto [law enforcement agencies] for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings” \nunless the requestor met criteria for commencement of removal proceedings or referral to \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a determination whether to commence \nremoval proceedings.  J.A. 1142.  For individuals whose pending DACA requests were \ndenied,  the  announcement  stated  that  “[g]enerally,  information  provided  in  DACA \nrequests will not be proactively provided to other law enforcement entities . . . for the \npurpose of immigration enforcement proceedings” unless the requestor posed “a risk to \nnational  security  or  public  safety”  or  met  criteria  for  commencement  of  removal \nproceedings  or  referral  to  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  for  a \ndetermination whether to commence removal proceedings.  J.A. 1143.   \nNearly 800,000 individuals have received deferred action under DACA since its \ninception.   \nC. \n  Plaintiffs’ complaint raises a host of challenges to the government’s decision to \nrescind DACA.  First, the complaint alleges that the rescission is a substantive rule and \nthus requires notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA.  Next, it asserts that the \ngovernment’s decisions to rescind DACA and change the way the government proposed \n12 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 13 of 60\nto share personal information collected from DACA applicants were arbitrary, capricious, \nand contrary to law, in violation of the APA, and violated the substantive and procedural \ndue process protections of the Fifth Amendment.  Plaintiffs also allege that the decision \nto  rescind  DACA  violates  the  equal  protection  guarantee  of  the  Fifth  Amendment.  \nFinally, Plaintiffs say that the government should be equitably estopped from rescinding \nDACA or using information provided by DACA applicants for immigration enforcement \npurposes beyond those first announced in 2012, when the government’s information-\nsharing policies were first implemented.   \n  The district court granted partial summary judgment to the government.  The court \nfound (contrary to the government’s contention) that Plaintiffs’ claims were justiciable.  \nCasa De Maryland v. DHS, 284 F. Supp. 3d 758, 768-71 (D. Md. 2018).  But on the \nmerits, the court determined that DACA’s rescission and the government’s changes to its \npolicies on information-sharing did not violate the APA and that Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nclaims lacked merit.  Id. at 771-77.  The court also determined that DACA’s rescission \ndid not violate the doctrine of estoppel.  Id. at 777-78.   \nThe court, however, granted summary judgment to Plaintiffs on the portion of \ntheir estoppel claim pertaining to the sharing of DACA applicant information.  The court \nordered the government to comply with the policies as originally announced in 2012 and \nenjoined it from altering these policies.  Id. at 778-79; J.A. 1531-33.   \nThese appeals followed.  We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment \nde novo.  Roland v. USCIS, 850 F.3d 625, 628 (4th Cir. 2017).  “We can affirm a grant of \nsummary judgment only where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the \n13 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 14 of 60\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, \nLondon  v.  Cohen,  785  F.3d  886,  889-90  (4th  Cir.  2015)  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted).  We review a district court’s grant of an injunction for abuse of discretion.  \nSouth Carolina v. United States, 907 F.3d 742, 753 (4th Cir. 2018).   \n \nII. \n  We  begin  with  the  government’s  argument  that  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  not \njusticiable, an issue we consider de novo.  See Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352, 370 \n(4th Cir. 2014); Angelex Ltd. v. United States, 723 F.3d 500, 505 (4th Cir. 2013).   \nA. \n  The government contends that Plaintiffs’ claims are immune from judicial review \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), a provision of the INA stating, “no court shall have jurisdiction \nto hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action \nby the [Secretary of Homeland Security] to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or \nexecute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.”   \n  According to the government, § 1252(g) bars review here in two ways.  First, \nnoting  that  the  Supreme  Court  in  AAADC  observed  that  § 1252(g)  “seems  clearly \ndesigned to give some measure of protection to ‘no deferred action’ decisions and similar \ndiscretionary  determinations,”  525  U.S.  at  485,6  the  government  contends  that  this \n                                              \n6  The  Supreme  Court  said  as  much  after  reviewing  a  treatise  describing  the \npractice of deferred action and litigation that would result when it was  not granted.  \nAAADC, 525 U.S. at 484-85.  That treatise, however, referred explicitly to “[e]fforts to \n(Continued) \n14 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 15 of 60\nsection bars review because DACA’s rescission is a “no deferred action” decision.  But \nthis contention ignores both the plain language of § 1252(g) and the Supreme Court’s \ndetermination in AAADC that this section “applies only to three discrete actions that the \n[Secretary  of  Homeland  Security]  may  take:  her  ‘decision  or  action’  to  ‘commence \nproceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’”  Id. at 482 (first emphasis \nadded).  In rescinding DACA, the Acting Secretary did none of these things.   \n  Second, the government says that § 1252(g) precludes review because DACA’s \nrescission is an initial “action” in the commencement of removal proceedings.  As the \ngovernment would have it, review of its decision to rescind DACA must await a final \norder of removal.  The Supreme Court in AAADC though “specifically rejected a broad \nreading of the three discrete actions listed in [§] 1252(g).”  Regents, 908 F.3d at 504.  \nSpecifically, “decisions to open an investigation, [or] to surveil the suspected violator” \nare not encompassed by § 1252(g)’s jurisdictional bar, even though these decisions “may \nbe part of the deportation process.”  AAADC, 525 U.S. at 482; see Jennings v. Rodriguez, \n138 S. Ct.  830,  841  (2018)  (Alito,  J.,  plurality)  (“[In  AAADC,  w]e  did  not  interpret \n[§ 1252(g)] to sweep in any claim that can technically be said to ‘arise from’ the three \nlisted  actions. . . . Instead,  we  read  the  language  to  refer  to  just  those  three  specific \nactions themselves.” (emphasis added)).   \n                                              \n \nchallenge the refusal to exercise [deferred action] on behalf of specific aliens.”  Id. at 485 \n(emphasis added).  Plaintiffs don’t challenge the refusal to grant deferred action to a \nparticular individual.   \n15 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 16 of 60\nAnd while we accept that § 1252(g) “is specifically directed at the deconstruction, \nfragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal proceedings,” AAADC, 525 U.S. at \n487, the government hasn’t moved to remove any of the Plaintiffs.  The two Circuit \ndecisions on which the government relies to support the proposition that judicial review \nof DACA’s rescission is available only through review of a final order of removal—\nVasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898 (3d Cir. 2016), and Botezatu v. INS, 195 F.3d 311 \n(7th  Cir.  1999)—are  inapposite.    Those  cases  involved  challenges  to  individual  “no \ndeferred action” decisions by aliens adjudicated removable.  Vasquez, 639 F. App’x at \n901; Botezatu, 195 F.3d at 314.  The government’s reliance on AAADC is therefore \nmisplaced, and we reject its argument that § 1252(g) bars review of Plaintiffs’ claims.7   \nB. \nThe  government  argues  that  another  provision  of  the  INA—8  U.S.C. \n§ 1252(b)(9)—bars  review  of  Plaintiffs’  claims.    The  government  did  not  press  this \nargument  in  the  district  court.    But  because  a  party  may  challenge  subject  matter \njurisdiction for the first time on appeal, Am. Canoe Ass’n, Inc. v. Murphy Farms, Inc., \n326 F.3d 505, 515 (4th Cir. 2003), we consider this issue.   \n                                              \n7 Accord Regents, 908 F.3d at 504 (holding § 1252(g) doesn’t deprive courts of \njurisdiction to review DACA’s rescission); NAACP v. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209, 224 \n(D. D.C. 2018) (rejecting as “misplaced” government’s reliance on AAADC and finding \n§ 1252(g) didn’t bar review of challenges to DACA’s rescission), appeals docketed, Nos. \n18-5243, 18-5245 (D.C. Cir.

July \n5, 2018), petition for cert. before judgment filed, 87 U.S.L.W. 3201 (U.S. Nov. 5, 2018) \n(No. 18-589).   \n16 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 17 of 60\nSection 1252(b)(9) provides that “[j]udicial review of all questions of law and \nfact . . . arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the \nUnited States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final \norder under this section.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  But that provision doesn’t help the \ngovernment here because it “applies only with respect to review of an order of removal \nunder [8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1)].”  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 313 (2001) (emphases \nadded; internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); see Calcano-Martinez v. INS, \n232 F.3d 328, 340 (2d Cir. 2000) (“Congress enacted [§ 1252(b)(9)] for the important \npurpose of consolidating all claims that may be brought in removal proceedings into one \nfinal petition for review of a final order in the court of appeals.” (emphasis added)), aff’d, \n533 U.S. 348 (2001).   \nThe government’s contention that § 1252(b)(9) bars review thus is without merit.   \nC. \n  Next, the government contends that judicial review is foreclosed under the APA \nbecause the decision to rescind DACA is committed to agency discretion by law.  We do \nnot agree.   \n“Although there is a ‘strong presumption’ in favor of judicial review of agency \naction,” Speed Mining, Inc. v. Fed. Mine Safety & Health Review Comm’n, 528 F.3d 310, \n316 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, \n670  (1986)),  the  APA  bars  judicial  review  of  agency  action  “committed  to  agency \ndiscretion  by  law.”    5  U.S.C.  § 701(a)(2).    The  government  says  that  the  Acting \nSecretary’s decision to rescind DACA is a type of agency enforcement decision that is \n17 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 18 of 60\npresumptively unreviewable under the Supreme Court’s decision in Heckler v. Chaney, \n470 U.S. 821 (1985).8  Invoking the “broad discretion exercised by immigration officials” \nthat  is  a  “principal  feature  of  the  removal  system,”  Arizona,  567  U.S.  at  396,  the \ngovernment urges that the concerns driving Chaney’s presumption of unreviewability \napply with “particular force” in the removal context, a context in which allowing delay \nwould result in ordering the government to allow a “continuing violation” of federal law, \nAAADC, 525 U.S. at 490.   \nAnd  while  conceding  that  an  agency’s  expression  of  a  legal  interpretation \nannounced in a broad or general enforcement policy may be reviewable, the government \nsays  that  the  decision  to  rescind  DACA  is  distinguishable  because  it  rested  on \ndiscretionary  enforcement  concerns  and  expressed  the  Department  of  Homeland \nSecurity’s  view  about  the  scope  of  its  enforcement  authority,  not  the  substantive \nunlawfulness  of  the  policy.    Finally,  relying  on  the  Supreme  Court’s  post-Chaney \ndecision  in  ICC  v.  Bhd.  of  Locomotive  Eng’rs  (“BLE”),  482  U.S.  270  (1987),  the \ngovernment argues that, even if the sole rationale for the rescission decision was the view \nthat DACA was unlawful, such rationale cannot provide a “hook” to support review of \nthe decision.   \n                                              \n8 The government doesn’t appear to seriously contest that Plaintiffs’ procedural \nAPA  claim  challenging  the  decision  to  rescind  DACA  is  subject  to  judicial  review.  \nAccord Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 195-98 (1993) (process by which an agency makes \na  rule  may  be  reviewed  for  compliance  with  applicable  procedural  requirements, \nregardless of reviewability of the substance of the rule).   \n18 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 19 of 60\nBecause the government relies so heavily on Chaney for its argument, we turn to \nthat  decision.    There,  a  group  of  death  row  inmates  petitioned  the  Food  and  Drug \nAdministration to prevent the use in lethal injections of certain drugs that the agency had \nnot approved for that purpose.  470 U.S. at 823-24.  The agency refused to act, based on \nits view that its jurisdiction to act under the substantive law was unclear and, even if it \nhad jurisdiction, it would decline to exercise that jurisdiction under its inherent discretion \nto do so.  Id. at 824-25.  The petitioners filed suit, seeking an order directing the agency \nto act.  Id. at 825.   \nWithout  addressing  the  jurisdictional  issue,  the  Court  held  that  the  agency’s \ndiscretionary decision not to enforce the substantive law was unreviewable under the \nAPA.  Id. at 828, 837-38.  As the Court explained, such decisions “often involve[] a \ncomplicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within [the agency’s] \nexpertise,”  including  “whether  agency  resources  are  best  spent  on  this  violation  or \nanother, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, [and] whether the particular \nenforcement action . . . best fits the agency’s overall policies.”  Id. at 831.   \nNonenforcement  decisions,  the  Court  observed,  generally  do  not  involve  the \nexercise  of  “coercive  power  over  an  individual’s  liberty  or  property  rights,”  and, \naccordingly, do “not infringe upon areas that courts often are called upon to protect.”  Id. \nat 832.  Such decisions also “share[] to some extent the characteristics of the decision of a \nprosecutor  in  the  Executive  Branch  not  to  indict—a  decision  which  has  long  been \nregarded as the special province of the Executive Branch.”  Id.  For these reasons, the \nCourt found, such decisions have “traditionally been committed to agency discretion,” \n19 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 20 of 60\nand Congress, in “enacting the APA[,] did not intend to alter that tradition.”  Id. (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Thus, the Court concluded, “an agency’s decision not to take \nenforcement action should be presumed immune from judicial review under § 701(a)(2).”  \nId.   \nHere, however, the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to rescind DACA \nis not a “Chaney-type enforcement action[].”  Kenney v. Glickman, 96 F.3d 1118, 1123 \n(8th Cir. 1996).  For starters, the Acting Secretary did not exercise her discretion in an \nindividual case.9  Nor did she identify a violation of the INA against which to act, \ndetermine whether government resources would be best spent enforcing one violation \nover another, or decide whether the Department would succeed if it pursued a particular \nviolation.  Rather, Acting Secretary Duke rescinded a general enforcement policy in \nexistence for over five years and affecting hundreds of thousands of enrollees based on \nthe view that the policy was unlawful.   \n  Major  agency  policy  decisions  are  “quite  different  from  day-to-day  agency \n[]enforcement decisions.”  Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Horner, 854 F.2d 490, 496 \n(D.C. Cir. 1988).  Where an agency expresses a broad or general enforcement policy, \ndifferent  considerations  than  those  driving  Chaney’s  presumption  are  at  play.  \n                                              \n9 The government correctly observes that an agency’s discretionary decision to \nenforce the law may be unreviewable under § 701(a)(2).  See Speed Mining, 528 F.3d at \n311,  317-18  (holding  agency’s  discretionary  decision  to  enforce  substantive  law  by \nissuing citations for safety violations was committed to agency discretion and therefore \nunreviewable).  But Speed Mining is distinguishable because it involved a discretionary \nenforcement decision in an individual case.   \n20 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 21 of 60\n“As general statements, they are more likely to be direct interpretations of the commands \nof the substantive statute rather than the sort of mingled assessments of fact, policy, and \nlaw that drive an individual enforcement decision and that are, as Chaney recognizes, \npeculiarly within the agency’s expertise and discretion.”  Crowley Caribbean Transp., \nInc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 677 (D.C. Cir. 1994).   \nAccordingly, as courts have recognized, an agency’s expression of a broad or \ngeneral  enforcement  policy  based  on  the  agency’s  legal  interpretation  is  subject  to \nreview.  OSG Bulk Ships, Inc. v. United States, 132 F.3d 808, 811-12 (D.C. Cir. 1998) \n(holding courts had jurisdiction under APA because challenged agency action was a \ngeneral policy of refusing to enforce provision of substantive law and not a “single-shot \nnon-enforcement decision” (citing Crowley, 37 F.3d at 674-76)); see Kenney, 96 F.3d at \n1123-24 (concluding Chaney applies to “individual, case-by-base determinations of when \nto  enforce  existing  [law]  rather  than  permanent  policies  or  standards”  and  did  not \nencompass  agency’s  adoption  of  general  policies  stating  standards  agency  deemed \nacceptable to implement statutory goals); Crowley, 37 F.3d at 672-73, 675 (Chaney’s \npresumption applies if “agency bases its refusal to enforce in an individual case solely on \na legal interpretation without explicitly relying on its enforcement discretion”); see also \nEdison Elec. Inst. v. EPA, 996 F.2d 326, 333 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding challenge to \nagency’s interpretation of law and regulations advanced in enforcement policy statement \nwas “not the type of discretionary judgment concerning the allocation of enforcement \nresources  that  [Chaney]  shields  from  judicial  review”);  Nat’l  Wildlife  Fed’n v.  EPA, \n980 F.2d 765, 767, 773 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding Chaney’s presumption “is inapplicable \n21 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 22 of 60\nor at least rebutted [where plaintiff] raise[d] a facial challenge to the [agency’s] statutory \ninterpretation embodied in [a regulation] and d[id] not contest a particular enforcement \ndecision”  and  citing  authority  in  support).    DACA’s  rescission  fits  well  within  this \nrubric.10   \nThe  government  attempts  to  distinguish  this  authority,  but  its  efforts  are \nunavailing.  It claims DACA’s rescission involved discretionary balancing because it was \nbased on concerns about its legality and “litigation risk,” a term that appears to refer to \nthe likelihood the policy would have been invalidated had it been challenged in the Texas \nlitigation.    But  the  Rescission  Memo  doesn’t  identify  the  “risk”  of  litigation  as  a \n“consideration” on which the Acting Secretary relied in rescinding the policy.  Rather, \nthe Memo relies on the Attorney General’s conclusion that DACA needed to be rescinded \nbecause  it  was  unlawful.11    True,  the  Attorney  General’s  letter  also  proffers  the \nconclusion that “potentially imminent litigation” would invalidate DACA, as was the \ncase with DAPA in the Texas litigation.  But we agree with the determination of our \ndistrict  court  colleague  Judge  Bates  in  his  opinion  resolving  challenges  to  DACA’s \n                                              \n10  Our  dissenting  colleague  contends  that  decisions  from  the  D.C.  Circuit \nsupporting our view that DACA’s rescission is reviewable don’t explain how they can be \nreconciled with Chaney.  Dis. op. at 48-51.  We disagree.  See Crowley, 37 F.3d at \n675-77; Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 980 F.2d at 772-73.   \n11 See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1) (“[D]etermination[s] and ruling[s] by the Attorney \nGeneral with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling [on the Secretary of \nHomeland Security].”); see Yanez-Marquez v. Lynch, 789 F.3d 434, 450 n.6 (4th Cir. \n2015) (finding Attorney General’s position controlling where Department of Homeland \nSecurity  and  Attorney  General  had  conflicting  views  about  applicability  of  a  legal \ndoctrine).   \n22 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 23 of 60\nrescission that this justification “was too closely bound up with [the Attorney General’s] \nevaluation of DACA’s legality,” NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 234, and thus cuts against \nChaney’s presumption of unreviewability.   \nNor are we persuaded by the government’s claim that DACA’s rescission rested \non the Department’s view of the scope of its enforcement authority, not the substantive \nunlawfulness of the policy.  As Judge Bates aptly noted when presented with the same \nargument, “this strikes the [c]ourt as a distinction without a difference.  To say that a \nparticular agency action is ‘without statutory authority’ is simply to say that no statutory \nprovision  authorizes  that  action;  in  a  sense,  therefore,  it  is  a  determination  of  the \nsubstantive content of each statutory provision that might plausibly apply.” Id. at 232.  \nWe, like Judge Bates, “fail[] to perceive any meaningful difference between an agency’s \nconclusion that it lacks statutory authority and its interpretation of a specific statutory \nprovision.”  Id. 12   \n                                              \n12 Our dissenting colleague notes that Acting Secretary Duke didn’t say in the \nRescission Memo “that DACA must be terminated or that she lacked the legal authority \nto enforce DACA or a DACA-like program.”  Dis. op. at 54.  It is true that Acting \nSecretary Duke wrote only that it was clear DACA “should” be terminated.  J.A. 383.  \nStanding alone, however, “should” can express the notion of requirement or obligation.  \nShould, Webster’s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged (2002) (“used . . . to \nexpress duty, obligation, [or] necessity”).  Given the Attorney General’s evaluation of \nDACA’s legality and the absence of any reference to litigation risk in the Rescission \nMemo’s list of considerations, this use of the word “should” supports our conclusion, \nante, at 20, 22, that the Secretary rescinded DACA based on her view that the policy was \nunlawful.    Contrary  to  our  dissenting  colleague’s  view,  our  decision  today  does  not \nintrude on discretionary prerogatives of the Executive Branch (see Dis. op. at 50-52); \nrather, it “preserves the judiciary’s role as the ultimate arbiter of statutory meaning while \nat the same time affording agencies breathing space to adopt enforcement policies for \ndiscretionary reasons,” NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 234.   \n23 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 24 of 60\nThe government also relies on the Supreme Court’s decision in BLE as further \nsupport for the view that Plaintiffs’ claims are unreviewable.  But there, the Supreme \nCourt held only that “where a party petitions an agency for reconsideration on the ground \nof material error, i.e., on the same record that was before the agency when it rendered its \noriginal decision, an order which merely denies rehearing of the prior order is not itself \nreviewable.”  482 U.S. at 280 (internal quotation marks, ellipsis, and alteration omitted).  \nThe government is correct that the Court also rejected the principle that, if an “agency \ngives  a  ‘reviewable’  reason  for  otherwise  unreviewable  action,  the  action  becomes \nreviewable,” citing as an example a prosecutor’s refusal to institute criminal proceedings \nbased on the belief that the law will not sustain a conviction.  Id. at 283.  But BLE still \ndoes not advance the government’s argument.   \nFor one thing, Plaintiffs here filed a timely challenge to the government’s original \ndecision to rescind DACA.  BLE doesn’t bar review of that type of challenge.  Moreover, \nas  the  government  itself  concedes,  Appellees’  Opening  &  Response  Br.  at  19,  BLE \naddressed the scope of judicial review in the context of agency non-enforcement action in \nan  individual  case.    See Crowley,  37  F.3d  at  675-77  (explaining  the  basis  for \ndistinguishing—for  purposes  of  judicial  review—between  individual  enforcement \ndecisions  and  implementation  of  broad  enforcement  policies).    DACA’s  rescission \ninvolves a broad enforcement policy, not an individual decision. 13   \n                                              \n13 We accept that agency action doesn’t become reviewable simply because “the \nagency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action.”  BLE, 482 U.S. at \n283.  But, as we’ve explained, DACA’s rescission is not such an unreviewable decision.  \n(Continued) \n24 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 25 of 60\nIn sum, we hold that Plaintiffs’ claims are reviewable.14   \n \nIII. \nA. \nWe turn now to the merits and consider first whether the district court erred in \ngranting summary judgment to the government on Plaintiffs’ procedural APA claim.  The \ncourt determined that DACA’s rescission was akin to a policy statement and thus was not \nsubject to notice and comment under the APA.  Casa, 284 F. Supp. 3d at 772.  We review \nthis determination de novo.  Children’s Hosp. of the King’s Daughters, Inc. v. Azar \n(“CHKD”), 896 F.3d 615, 619 (4th Cir. 2018).   \nThe APA generally requires that agencies provide notice of proposals to create, \namend, or repeal a rule15 and an opportunity for interested persons to comment on the \nproposal.    See  5  U.S.C.  §§ 551(4)-(5),  553(a)-(c).    “Rules  issued  through  the \n                                              \n \nSee NAACP,  298  F. Supp. 3d  at  231  (“[A]n  otherwise  reviewable  interpretation  of  a \nstatute  does  not  become  presumptively  unreviewable  simply  because  the  agency \ncharacterizes it as an exercise of enforcement discretion.”).   \n14  The  government  has  not  cross-appealed  from  the  district  court’s  additional \ndetermination that all Plaintiffs had standing, Casa, 284 F. Supp. 3d at 771, and  the \nparties have not briefed this issue on appeal.  Nonetheless, reviewing this issue de novo, \nBostic,  760 F.3d  at  370,  we  agree  with  the  district  court  that  the  individual  DACA \nrecipient Plaintiffs have standing to sue.  We consequently need not consider whether the \nother Plaintiffs have standing.  See id. at 370-71.   \n15 The parties don’t dispute that DACA’s rescission qualifies as a “rule” for APA \npurposes.  See 5 U.S.C. § 551(4).   \n25 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 26 of 60\nnotice-and-comment process are often referred to as legislative rules because they have \nthe force and effect of law.”  Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1203 \n(2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “[T]he APA provides[, however,] that, unless \nanother statute states otherwise, the notice-and-comment requirement ‘does not apply’ to \n‘interpretative  rules,  general  statements  of  policy,  or  rules  of  agency  organization, \nprocedure, or practice.’”  Id. at 1203-04 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A)).   \n  Plaintiffs argue that DACA’s rescission required notice and comment under the \nAPA because the Rescission Memo is a legislative rule that mandates how Department \nofficials must act and substantively affects DACA recipients.  The government rejects \nthis premise, countering that the Memo is a general statement of policy.  We agree with \nthe government.16   \n  The  critical  question  in  distinguishing  between  legislative  rules  and  general \nstatements of policy is whether the statement “is of present binding effect; if it is, then the \nAPA calls for notice and comment.”  Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. DHS (“EPIC”), 653 F.3d \n1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted).  “[S]ubstantive or \nlegislative rule[s], pursuant to properly delegated authority, ha[ve] the force of law, and \ncreate[] new law or impose[] new rights or duties.”  CHKD, 896 F.3d at 620 (internal \n                                              \n16  Accord  Regents,  908  F.3d  at  512-14  (holding  DACA’s  rescission  is  not  a \nbinding rule of substantive law); NAACP, 298 F.

Supp. 3d  260,  270-73  (E.D.N.Y.  2018)  (dismissing \nnotice-and-comment claims because Rescission Memo is not a legislative rule), appeals \ndocketed, Nos. 18-1521, 18-1525, 18-1986 (2d Cir. May 21 & July 5, 2018).   \n26 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 27 of 60\nquotation marks omitted); see Nat’l Latino Media Coal. v. FCC, 816 F.2d 785, 788 \n(D.C. Cir. 1987) (“A valid legislative rule is binding upon all persons, and on the courts, \nto the same extent as a congressional statute.”).  “To that end, a rule is legislative if it \nsupplements a statute, adopts a new position inconsistent with existing regulations, or \notherwise effects a substantive change in existing law or policy.”  CHKD, 896 F.3d at \n620 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).   \n  By contrast, general statements of policy “advise the public prospectively of the \nmanner in which the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.”  Vigil, 508 U.S. \nat 197 (internal quotation marks omitted).  A directive that doesn’t establish a “binding \nnorm” and leaves agency officials free to exercise their discretion qualifies as a general \nstatement of policy.  Chen Zhou Chai v. Carroll, 48 F.3d 1331, 1341 (4th Cir. 1995) \n(citing  Am.  Hosp.  Ass’n  v.  Bowen,  834  F.2d  1037,  1046  (D.C.  Cir.  1987),  and \nMada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1015 (9th Cir. 1987)).   \n  The  Rescission  Memo  removes  a  mechanism  under  which  individuals  could \nreceive  deferred  action  but  places  “no  limitations”  on  other  lawful  enforcement \nprerogatives of the Department of Homeland Security.  J.A. 384.  As the district court \nobserved,  Casa,  284  F. Supp. 3d at  772,  the  Memo  doesn’t  curtail  the  Department’s \ndiscretion to make deferred action available on a case-by-case or ad hoc basis.  Nor does \nthe  Memo,  by  its  terms,  create  “right[s]  or  benefit[s]”  enforceable  “by  any  party.”  \nJ.A. 384.   \nAdditionally, although DACA was rescinded based on the government’s view that \nthe policy was unlawful, the Rescission Memo doesn’t bind subsequent Secretaries who \n27 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 28 of 60\nmight  disagree  with  this  reasoning  or  bar  the  Department  from  implementing  other \ndeferred  action  policies  in  the  future.    Contrary  to  Plaintiffs’  arguments,  the  Memo \ndoesn’t “replace[] agency discretion with a new binding rule of substantive law,” Mada-\nLuna, 813 F.2d at 1014 (internal quotation marks omitted), affecting the rights of people \nregulated  by  the  Department,  see EPIC,  653  F.3d  at  7  (agency’s  statement  “cast  in \nmandatory language so the affected private parties are reasonably led to believe that \nfailure to conform will bring adverse consequences” qualifies as binding on those subject \nto it (internal quotation marks omitted)).  It therefore falls on the policy “end of the \nspectrum,” CHKD, 896 F.3d at 620-21 (internal quotation marks omitted), and thus was \nexempt from notice and comment under the APA.  \nB. \n  We consider next whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to \nthe government on Plaintiffs’ claim that DACA’s rescission is substantively invalid under \nthe APA. \n1. \n  The  APA  requires  a  reviewing  court  to  “hold  unlawful  and  set  aside  agency \naction . . . found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  These “criteria render our oversight highly \ndeferential, with a presumption in favor of finding the agency action valid.”  Friends of \nBack Bay v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 681 F.3d 581, 587 (4th Cir. 2012) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  This standard, however, “does not reduce judicial review to a \nrubber stamp of agency action.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Rather, “we \n28 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 29 of 60\nmust engage in a searching and careful inquiry of the [administrative] record, so that we \nmay consider whether the agency considered the relevant factors and whether a clear \nerror of judgment was made.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Where agency \naction qualifies as “unreasonable as a matter of law, it is likely to have been arbitrary and \ncapricious.”  Id. (citing Marsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 377 n.23 (1989)).  \n“We evaluate [this issue] de novo[.]”  Id.   \n  To comply  with § 706(2)(A), an agency “must examine the relevant data and \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  The giving of “adequate reasons” for \nan agency’s decision is “[o]ne of the basic procedural requirements of administrative \nrulemaking.”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2016).  In a \nchallenge under § 706(2)(A), “an agency’s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis \narticulated by the agency itself.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 50; see Jimenez–Cedillo v. \nSessions, 885 F.3d 292, 299 (4th Cir. 2018) (“[A] reviewing court may not speculate on \nreasons that might have supported a change in agency position []or supply a reasoned \nbasis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given.” (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted)).   \nAn agency satisfactorily explains a decision when it provides “enough clarity that \nits ‘path may reasonably be discerned.’”  Jimenez–Cedillo, 885 F.3d at 297 (quoting \nBowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974)).  If \nthe agency provides such an explanation, “we will uphold its decision.”  Id. at 297-98.  \n29 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 30 of 60\n“But where the agency has failed to provide even that minimal level of analysis, its action \nis arbitrary and capricious and so cannot carry the force of law.”  Encino Motorcars, \n136 S. Ct. at 2125.   \nThese principles apply with equal force to a change in agency position.  Jimenez–\nCedillo, 885 F.3d at 298.  Thus, in changing policies, agencies “must ‘provide a reasoned \nexplanation for the change.’”  Id. (quoting Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2125).  “At a \nminimum, an agency must ‘display awareness that it is changing position and show that \nthere are good reasons for the new policy.’”  Id. (quoting Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at \n2126).  The agency’s explanation must address the “facts and circumstances that underlay \nor  were  engendered  by  the  prior  policy,”  including  any  “serious  reliance  interests.”  \nEncino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2126 (quoting FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 \nU.S. 502, 515-16 (2009)).  “An ‘unexplained inconsistency’ in agency policy indicates \nthat the agency’s action is arbitrary and capricious, and therefore unlawful.”  Jimenez–\nCedillo, 885 F.3d at 298 (quoting Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2125).  \n2. \n  Plaintiffs argue that DACA’s rescission was arbitrary and capricious because the \nDepartment of Homeland Security failed to give a reasoned explanation for the change in \npolicy, particularly given the significant reliance interests involved.  We agree.17   \n                                              \n17 Plaintiffs also assert that (1) the district court failed to consider evidence of “bad \nfaith”  and  “animus”  underlying  the  decision  to  rescind  DACA  presented  in  their \ncomplaint and (2) the Department’s conclusions about DACA’s legality are substantively \nincorrect.  Given our disposition, we decline to address these arguments.   \n30 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 31 of 60\nAs we have explained, DACA was rescinded based on the Department’s view that \nthe policy was unlawful.

Ct. at 2127 (rejecting as insufficient \nagency statement regarding statutory exemption proffered in support of policy change \nwhere agency did not “analyze or explain” why statute should be interpreted as agency \nsuggested).   \nThe Attorney General’s letter does mention that the Fifth Circuit affirmed the \ninjunction against the DAPA policy on “multiple legal grounds” in the Texas litigation, \nJ.A. 379, and the Rescission Memo cites to this ruling.  The Fifth Circuit’s ruling was \nbased in part on its determination that the DAPA policy likely ran counter to the INA’s \n“intricate process for illegal aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification from their \nchildren’s  immigration  status.”    Texas,  809  F.3d  at  179.    There  is  no  dispute  here, \nhowever, that “DACA has no analogue in the INA.”  NAACP, 298 F. Supp. 3d at 239 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, as the Fifth Circuit explained in reaching its \nconclusion, “DACA and DAPA are not identical.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 174.   \nThe Attorney General’s letter also asserts that DACA suffered from the same \n“constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA.”  J.A. 379.  The courts in \nthe  Texas  litigation,  however,  did  not  address  constitutional  claims.    And  while  the \nAttorney General urged in his letter that his office had a duty to “defend the Constitution” \nand “faithfully execute the laws passed by Congress,” J.A. 379, he does not explain how \nallowing the DACA policy to remain in effect would violate that duty.   \n31 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 32 of 60\nThe Attorney General’s letter and the Rescission Memo also proffer the concern—\nbased on the Attorney General’s determination that the DAPA and DACA policies share \nthe same legal defects—that “potentially imminent” litigation would result in a ruling in \nthe Texas litigation enjoining DACA.  Entirely absent, however, is an explanation why it \nwas likely that the district court in the Texas litigation would have enjoined DACA.   \nFurther, the 2014 OLC Opinion outlining the Department’s authority to implement \nthe  DAPA  policy  identified “from  the  nature  of  the  Take  Care  duty”  at  least  “four \ngeneral . . . principles  governing  the  permissible  scope  of  enforcement  discretion,” \nJ.A. 137-38; 2014 WL 10788677, at *5-6, and noted that concerns “animating DACA \nwere . . . consistent with the types of concerns that have customarily guided the exercise \nof immigration enforcement discretion,” J.A. 149 n.8; 2014 WL 10788677, at *13 n.8.   \nThe point is that the Department had before it at the time it rescinded DACA a \nreasoned analysis from the office tasked with providing legal advice to all executive \nbranch agencies that supported the policy’s legality.  Yet the Department changed course \nwithout any explanation for why that analysis was faulty.  Cf. Fox Television Stations, \n556 U.S.  at  516  (“[A]  reasoned  explanation  is  needed  for  disregarding  facts  and \ncircumstances that underlay . . . the prior policy.”).   \nNor did the Department adequately account for the reliance interests that would be \naffected by its decision.  Hundreds of thousands of people had structured their lives on \nthe availability of deferred action during the over five years between the implementation \nof DACA and the decision to rescind.  Although the government insists that Acting \n32 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 33 of 60\nSecretary Duke18 considered these interests in connection with her decision to rescind \nDACA, her Memo makes no mention of them.   \nAccordingly,  we  hold  that  the  Department’s  decision  to  rescind  DACA  was \narbitrary and capricious and must be set aside.   \n \nIV. \n  We turn next to the district court’s rulings (1) granting summary judgment to \nPlaintiffs on the portion of their estoppel claim pertaining to sharing of DACA applicant \ninformation, and (2) ordering the government to comply with the information-sharing \npolicies promulgated in 2012 and enjoining it from altering those policies.   \n  “Equitable estoppel is a well-established concept invoked by courts to aid a party \nwho, in good faith, has relied, to his detriment, upon the representations of another.”  \nUnited States ex rel. Humble Oil & Ref. Co. v. Fid. & Cas. Co. of N.Y., 402 F.2d 893, 897 \n(4th Cir. 1968) (internal footnote omitted).  To establish equitable estoppel, “[i]t is only \nnecessary to show that the person [sought to be] estopped, by . . . statements or conduct, \nmisled another to his prejudice.”  Id. at 898 (quoting United States ex rel. Noland Co. v. \nWood, 99 F.2d 80, 82 (4th Cir. 1938)).  As against the government, “estoppel may only \n                                              \n18 The government urges us to consider the June 2018 memorandum from former \nSecretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen belatedly proffered by the government \nas  a  basis  for  upholding  DACA’s  rescission.    We  decline  to  do  so  because  the \nmemorandum was not part of the administrative record in this appeal.  Fla. Power & \nLight Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 743 (1985).   \n33 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 34 of 60\nbe justified, if ever, in the presence of affirmative misconduct by government agents.”  \nDawkins v. Witt, 318 F.3d 606, 611 (4th Cir. 2003).   \nIn  enjoining  the  government,  the  district  court  determined  that  estoppel \n“potentially would apply to any use for immigration enforcement of the information \ncollected . . . during  DACA  registrations”  because  “the  Government  promised  not  to \ntransfer  or  use  the  information  gathered  from  [DACA  applicants]  for  immigration \nenforcement.”  Casa, 284 F. Supp. 3d at 778.   \nWe disagree with the district court.  The government did not make such a promise \nor  suggest  in  any  other  way  that  its  policies  governing  the  sharing  of  information \nprovided by DACA applicants would never change.  Rather, the government warned \nDACA  applicants  that  information  they  provided  could  be  used  for  immigration \nenforcement where criteria for commencement of removal proceedings or referral to law \nenforcement for a determination whether to commence such proceedings were met.  It \nalso warned that its policies governing the sharing of applicant information could be \n“modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice” and created no “right or \nbenefit.”  J.A. 1004.  In view of these clear and unequivocal warnings, Plaintiffs could \nnot  reasonably  believe  that  the  information  they  provided  as  part  of  their  DACA \napplication  would  never  be  used  for  immigration  enforcement  purposes.    Cf.  Volvo \nTrucks of N. Am., Inc. v. United States, 367 F.3d 204, 212 (4th Cir. 2004) (“Equitable \nestoppel  requires  reasonable  reliance.”).    Plaintiffs’  equitable  estoppel  claim  thus \nnecessarily fails.   \n \n34 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 35 of 60\nV. \n  We turn finally to Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, which were dismissed by the \ndistrict  court.    We  decline  to  decide  whether  DACA’s  rescission  violates  the  Fifth \nAmendment’s due process and equal protection guarantees under the “well established \nprinciple governing the prudent exercise of this [c]ourt’s jurisdiction that normally the \n[c]ourt will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which \nto dispose of the case.”  Escambia Cty. v. McMillan, 466 U.S. 48, 51 (1984) (per curiam).  \nBecause we have determined that DACA’s rescission violates the APA, we need go no \nfurther.  See, e.g., Veasey v. Abbott, 830 F.3d 216, 265 (5th Cir. 2016).   \nWe  also  decline  to  decide  whether  Plaintiffs’  Fifth  Amendment  rights  were \nviolated  by  the  policies  announced  on  September  5,  2017,  regarding  the  sharing  of \npersonal information from DACA applicants.19  McMillan, 466 U.S. at 51.  Our decision \ntoday  restores  DACA  to  its  pre-September  5,  2017,  status,  rendering  a  nullity  the \ninformation-sharing policies announced on September 5.  It therefore is unnecessary to \naddress Plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge to these policies.  See Veasey, 830 F.3d at \n265.20   \n                                              \n19 Although the district court found Plaintiffs’ due process claims lacked merit, its \nanalysis addressed DACA’s rescission, not information-sharing.  Casa, 284 F. Supp. 3d \nat 775-77.   \n20 Plaintiffs also contend that the district court misapplied Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 by \nfailing to (1) afford them a reasonable opportunity for discovery on their claims, (2) \nconsider or address their statement of material facts in dispute, and (3) view the facts in \nthe light most favorable to them.  They allege further that the district court misapplied the \nAPA  by  granting  summary  judgment  to  the  government  without  addressing  their \n(Continued) \n35 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 36 of 60\nVI. \n  To  sum  up:    We  affirm  the  district  court’s  rulings  that  Plaintiffs’  claims  are \njusticiable and that DACA’s rescission did not require notice and comment under the \nAPA.  We reverse the district court’s ruling sustaining the rescission of the policy as \nvalid  under  5  U.S.C.  § 706(2)(A).    DACA’s  rescission  is  vacated  as  arbitrary  and \ncapricious,  and  the  matter  is  remanded  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this \nopinion.  We reverse the district court’s ruling finding Plaintiffs entitled to injunctive \nrelief on equitable estoppel grounds, reverse the grant of summary judgment in Plaintiffs’ \nfavor, and vacate the injunction.  Because we find it unnecessary to decide Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional  challenges  to  DACA’s  rescission  and  the  related  changes  to  the \nDepartment’s policies governing use of information provided by DACA applicants, we \nvacate the district court’s judgment on these issues and dismiss those claims.     \nAFFIRMED IN PART, \nREVERSED IN PART,  \nVACATED IN PART, \nDISMISSED IN PART, \nAND REMANDED\n                                              \n \ncontention  that  the  administrative  record  was  incomplete  and  by  failing  to  consider \nevidence  of  “bad  faith  and  improper  behavior”  by  government  officials.    Given  our \ndisposition, we find it unnecessary to address these issues.   \n36 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 37 of 60\n \nRICHARDSON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part: \n  The plaintiffs ask this Court to invalidate the rescission of DACA, a seven-year-\nold  program  explained  at  its  inception  as  an  act  of  prosecutorial  discretion.    The \nMajority’s  opinion  grants  this  request,  reasoning  that  the  Department  of  Homeland \nSecurity  behaved  in  an  arbitrary  and  capricious  manner  by  giving  what  my  good \ncolleagues decide are faulty legal reasons for rescinding the discretionary policy. \n  I disagree with the premise that the Administrative Procedure Act permits this \nreview of the Executive Branch’s rescission of DACA.  Enforcement discretion lies at the \nheart of executive power.  The Executive may decide to prosecute, or not prosecute, an \nindividual or a group so long as the reasons for that decision are constitutionally sound \nand the decision does not violate or abdicate the Executive’s statutory duties.  Here, the \nExecutive’s proper exercise of that discretion to rescind DACA is judicially unreviewable \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act, regardless of one’s view of the policy questions \nunderlying DACA.  To hold otherwise permits the Judicial Branch to invade the province \nof the Executive and impair the carefully constructed separation of powers laid out in our \nConstitution.   \nI.  Background \nThe Secretary  of  Homeland Security  is  charged  by  statute  with  enforcing  the \nnation’s immigration laws.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a); 6 U.S.C. § 202(5).  Among those \nresponsibilities  is  removing  individuals  subject  to  removal  under  federal  law.    See \nArizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012).  “A principal feature of the removal \nsystem is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials.”  Id.  At each stage of \n37 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 38 of 60\n \nthe process—from investigation to execution of a removal order—the Secretary has the \ndiscretion to pursue removal or forbear doing so.  Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination \nComm., 525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999).  \nThe  Secretary  has  used  this  discretion  to  prioritize  the  removal  of  certain \ncategories  of  aliens  and  deprioritize  others.    See,  e.g.,  Memorandum  from  Doris \nMeissner,  Commissioner,  Dep’t  of  Justice,  Immigration  &  Naturalization  Service, \n“Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion” 7–9 (Nov. 17, 2000) (deprioritizing the removal of \naliens who, for instance, resided in the United States for a long time, had little to no \ncriminal  history,  and  had  greater  ties  to  the  United  States  than  another  country); \nMemorandum from John Morton, Director, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Immigration & \nCustoms Enforcement, “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion Consistent with the Civil \nImmigration Enforcement Priorities of the Agency for the Apprehension, Detention, and \nRemoval of Aliens” 2 (June 17, 2011) (deprioritizing the removal of veterans, minors, \nelderly individuals, pregnant women, and various other groups).  On top of these general, \ndepartment-wide  enforcement  policies,  individual  agents  have  been  empowered  to \nexercise enforcement discretion based on specific circumstances.  See, e.g., Meissner \nMemorandum at 1–2.  Just as a highway patrolman has discretion whether to pull over a \ngiven driver (and even after pulling someone over, whether to give that person a ticket), \nimmigration  agents  can  weigh  individual  and  country-specific  humanitarian \ncircumstances  when  deciding  whether  to  exercise  their  prosecutorial discretion.   See \nMorton Memorandum at 4.    \n38 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 39 of 60\n \n  Relying on this broad enforcement discretion to set enforcement priorities and to \nguide agents in rendering their individualized enforcement decisions, the Secretary of \nHomeland  Security  established  the  DACA  program.    Memorandum  from  Janet \nNapolitano,  Secretary,  Dep’t  of  Homeland  Sec.,  “Exercising  Prosecutorial  Discretion \nwith Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children” (June 15, 2012).  \nDACA authorized agents to grant deferred action1 to certain people brought illegally to \nthe United States as children.  Under DACA, aliens who applied and satisfied certain \ngateway  criteria  were  “granted”  or  “denied”  deferred  action,  ostensibly  on  an \nindividualized, case-by-case basis.  Id.  Even when granted, deferred action could be \nrevoked unilaterally by the Department.  See AAADC, 525 U.S. at 484–85.  The DACA \nmemorandum stated expressly that it conferred upon recipients of deferred action “no \nsubstantive  right,  immigration  status  or  pathway  to  citizenship.”    Napolitano \nMemorandum at 3.   \n  Two years later, the Secretary expanded DACA by loosening some restrictions \nand extending the period of deferred action from two years to three.  Memorandum from \nJeh  Johnson,  Secretary,  Dep’t  of  Homeland  Sec.,  “Policies  for  the  Apprehension, \nDetention and Removal of Undocumented Immigrants” (Nov. 20, 2014).  In the same \naction,  the  Secretary  also  created  a  new  enforcement  policy,  known  as  “DAPA,” \n                                              \n1  “Deferred  action”  means  “an  act  of  administrative  convenience  to  the \ngovernment which gives some cases lower priority.”  8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14). \n39 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 40 of 60\n \nextending “deferred action, on a case-by-case basis,” to parents of American citizens and \nlawful permanent residents.  Id. at 4. \n  Led by Texas, a coalition of states challenged this new policy in federal court, \narguing that DAPA (and the DACA expansion) violated the Administrative Procedure \nAct as well as the President’s Article II duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.”  U.S. CONST. art. II, § 3.  The district court preliminarily enjoined DAPA, \nholding that the Department had “legislated a substantive rule without complying with \nthe procedural requirements under the” APA.  Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, \n677 (S.D. Tex. 2015).  The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court, finding that the \nDepartment had promulgated DAPA in violation of the APA and that it was “manifestly \ncontrary” to the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”).  Texas v. United States, 809 \nF.3d 134, 182 (5th Cir. 2015).2 \n  The Supreme Court granted certiorari and directed the parties to brief not only the \nissues decided by the Fifth Circuit, but also whether “the Guidance violates the Take \nCare Clause of the Constitution, Art. II, § 3.”  United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 906 \n(2016).  But after oral argument, the Fifth Circuit decision was summarily affirmed by an \nequally divided Court.  United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271, 2272 (2016). \n                                              \n2 In finding DAPA subject to review under the APA, the Fifth Circuit held that \ndeferred action “is much more than nonenforcement.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 166.  The court \nreasoned that since recipients are conferred “lawful presence” and may receive associated \nbenefits such as driver’s licenses and unemployment insurance, deferred action was not \nan exercise of enforcement discretion.  Id. at 168, 168 n.108.    \n40 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 41 of 60\n \n  In  response,  the  Secretary  rescinded  the  enjoined  DAPA  program  and DACA \nexpansion.    Memorandum  from  John  Kelly,  Secretary,  Dep’t  of  Homeland  Sec., \n“Rescission of November 20, 2014 Memorandum” (June 15, 2017).  And several months \nlater, after Texas threatened to challenge the original DACA policy, the Acting Secretary \nsimilarly rescinded DACA.  Memorandum from Elaine Duke, Acting Secretary, Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., “Rescission of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum” (Sept. 5, 2017).   \n  In justifying her decision to rescind DACA, the Acting Secretary referred to the \nSupreme Court and Fifth Circuit decisions in the DAPA litigation.  She also relied on a \nletter from the Attorney General that asserted that because DACA “has the same legal \nand  constitutional  defects  that  the  courts  recognized  as  to  DAPA,  it  is  likely  that \npotentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.”  Id. at \n3–4.  The Acting Secretary nonetheless ordered that DACA be wound down in stages \nover a six-month period.  Id. \nII.  Administrative Procedure Act Review \nThe plaintiffs primarily contend that the rescission of DACA violates the APA.  \nBecause I find that immigration enforcement decisions are committed to the discretion of \nthe Department, I part with my colleagues and conclude that the rescission of DACA is \njudicially unreviewable under the APA.3   \n                                              \n3 The plaintiffs’ constitutional claims are, of course, reviewable, and I address \nthem separately below.  \n41 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 42 of 60\n \nA.  Discretionary enforcement decisions are presumptively unreviewable. \n  The APA regulates the decisionmaking process of federal agencies.  As such, the \nstatute provides for the judicial review of a “final agency action for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Even so, the statute does not permit \nreview of agency action that “is committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2).  This provision applies to a variety of agency decisions that are unsuitable \nfor judicial review.  See Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993); Citizens to Pres. \nOverton  Park,  Inc.  v.  Volpe,  401  U.S.  402,  410  (1971).    One  essential  category  of \ndecisions  “generally  committed  to  an  agency’s  absolute  discretion”  consists  of \nenforcement decisions, both in the civil and criminal arenas.  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 \nU.S. 821, 831 (1985).    \n  Discretion  in  prosecutorial  enforcement  is  deeply  rooted  in  the  Constitution’s \nseparation of powers.  See, e.g., In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 264 (D.C. Cir. 2013); \nSaikrishna Prakash, The Chief Prosecutor, 73 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 521, 537–63 (2005).  \nIndeed, the division of labor with respect to enforcement is among the most critical \nprotections the Constitution affords:  The Executive Branch decides whether and when to \nbegin  enforcement  actions  while  the  Judicial  Branch  adjudicates  the  government’s \nclaims.  This division reflects the Framers’ recognition that, “in the long term, structural \nprotections against abuse of power were critical to preserving liberty.”  Bowsher v. Synar, \n478 U.S. 714, 730 (1986).     \nEncroachment  by  the  judiciary  into  enforcement  decisions  upsets  this \nconstitutional  balance.    If judges could decide  which cases  to  prosecute,  that  would \n42 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 43 of 60\n \ncombine the role of prosecutor and judge in one branch of government, seriously risking \nindividual liberty.  See In re United States, 345 F.3d 450, 454 (7th Cir. 2003); see also 1 \nBARON DE MONTESQUIEU, THE SPIRIT OF LAWS 154 (Thomas Nugent trans., 6th ed. \n1792) (“[T]here is no liberty, if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative \nand  executive.”).   And  if  the  judiciary  could  decide  which  meritorious  cases  not  to \nprosecute, that would improperly divest the President, who unlike judges is elected by the \npeople, of the executive authority that the Constitution affords to protect public safety \nand enhance public welfare.  Thus, in “the ordinary case, ‘so long as the prosecutor has \nprobable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the \ndecision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury, \ngenerally rests entirely in his discretion.’”  United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 \n(1996) (quoting Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 364 (1978)); see also United \nStates  v.  Nixon,  418  U.S.  683,  693  (1974)  (“[T]he  Executive  Branch  has  exclusive \nauthority  and  absolute  discretion  to  decide  whether  to  prosecute  a  case.”).    The \njudiciary’s role is to protect individuals by properly adjudicating the charges against \nthem—for example, by dismissing meritless enforcement actions after they are filed.  It is \nnormally  neither  appropriate  nor  necessary  for  judges  to  involve  themselves  in  the \ndecision to bring, or not to bring, enforcement actions. \n  Though  perhaps  more  often  discussed  in  the  criminal  context,  this  broad \nenforcement discretion also encompasses civil enforcement decisions.  See Speed Mining, \nInc. v. Federal Mine Safety, 528 F.3d 310, 317 (4th Cir. 2008); see also Southern Ry. Co. \nv. Seaboard Allied Milling Corp., 442 U.S. 444, 448 (1979).  Indeed, the Supreme Court \n43 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 44 of 60\n \nhas recognized that the concerns that counsel against reviewing criminal enforcement \ndecisions are even stronger in the context of immigration removal decisions.  AAADC, \n525 U.S. at 490 (noting that the “systemic costs” of judicial supervision of enforcement \ndecisions are “greatly magnified in the deportation context”); see also Mathews v. Diaz, \n426 U.S. 67, 81–82 (1976). \n  The nature of civil enforcement discretion led the Supreme Court in Heckler v. \nChaney  to  hold  that  an  agency’s  nonenforcement  decision  was  presumptively \nunreviewable under the APA.  In that case, the Food and Drug Administration refused to \ntake  civil  enforcement  action  against  a  class  of  drug  manufacturers  and  others  who \nproduced and distributed drugs used by states to perform executions.  The FDA explained \nits decision not to institute any enforcement action as a product of concerns that it lacked \njurisdiction to address the use of drugs in such a way.  Yet even if it could, the FDA \nnoted that it would decline to exercise jurisdiction over those manufacturers under its \ninherent  enforcement  discretion.    The  Court  found  the  decision  to  be  presumptively \nunreviewable  under  the  APA  because  agency  enforcement  decisions  “involve[]  a \ncomplicated balancing of a number of factors,” like allocating resources and prioritizing \npolicies,  that  “are  peculiarly  within  [the  FDA’s]  expertise”  and  are  thus  generally \nunsuitable for judicial review.  Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831; cf. Wayte v. United States, 470 \nU.S. 598, 607 (1985) (noting that the factors that underlie prosecution decisions are of the \ntype that courts are not competent to evaluate).  \n  While civil enforcement decisions are presumptively unreviewable, Congress can \novercome that presumption by “circumscrib[ing] agency enforcement discretion” through \n44 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 45 of 60\n \na substantive statute.  Chaney, 470 U.S. at 834; see also id. at 830 (noting that judicial \nreview is unavailable under the APA if the statute provides “no judicially manageable \nstandards . . . for judging how and when an agency should exercise its discretion”).  In \nthis way, Congress retains the ability to restrict the Executive’s enforcement discretion.  \nIn Chaney, to decide whether the FDA was so restricted, the Court examined the relevant \nstatutory provisions and determined that the statutes provided no dictate about when \nenforcement discretion must be exercised.  Since the FDA’s enforcement discretion was \nboth  statutorily  authorized  and  unconstrained,  the  Court  held  that  the  enforcement \ndecision was not subject to APA review.   \n  Chaney also noted, without deciding, two other possible bases for judicial review \nof civil nonenforcement decisions:  if (1) the decision was based “solely on belief that \n[the agency] lacked jurisdiction”; or (2) an agency expressly adopted a “general policy \nthat is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities.”  470 \nU.S.  at  833  n.4.    The  Supreme  Court  later  rejected  the  first  possibility  in  I.C.C.  v. \nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, finding that an agency’s reliance on a “reviewable \nreason”  for  an  otherwise  unreviewable  discretionary  decision  did  not  transform  the \ndecision into one subject to APA review.  482 U.S. 270, 283 (1987).  The second, which \nmight be thought related to the Take Care Clause, U.S. CONST. art II, § 3, remains a \nnarrow  exception  theoretically  permitting  judicial  review  of  agency  enforcement \ndecisions in some rare cases.   \n45 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 46 of 60\n \nB.  The rescission of DACA is not reviewable. \nThe decision to rescind DACA is precisely the sort of enforcement decision that is \n“traditionally . . . ‘committed to agency discretion’” and not reviewable by the courts.  \nChaney, 470 U.S. at 832.  None of the recognized exceptions to that limitation apply, and \nso the rescission of DACA is not reviewable under the APA. \n  The Supreme Court has recognized that a “principal feature of the removal system \nis the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials.”  Arizona v. United States, 567 \nU.S. 387, 396 (2012).  Indeed, executive decisions about immigration enforcement are \neven further beyond the capacity of judicial review than criminal enforcement decisions, \nwhich are otherwise thought to represent the peak of executive discretion.  AAADC, 525 \nU.S. at 489–90.    \n  As a result, with or without DACA, government agents have discretion to grant \ndeferred action in individual cases.  Id. at 483–84, 484 n.8.  At least by its own terms, \nDACA did not eliminate the individualized discretion over enforcement decisions:  it \ncreated procedural and substantive scaffolding to guide that discretion.  See Napolitano \nMemorandum at 2.  Rescinding DACA took away the scaffolding but left the underlying \ncore—individualized  discretion—untouched.    Thus,  insofar  as  DACA  is  merely  a \nprogrammatic enforcement decision, so is its rescission, and both are unreviewable. \n  The best argument in favor of reviewability is that DACA itself was something \nother than an enforcement decision.  Once granted, deferred action makes recipients \neligible  for  benefits  such  as  the  ability  to  work  legally  in  the  country.    These  are \nsubsidiary or collateral benefits that arise from other legal provisions not challenged here.  \n46 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 47 of 60\n \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3) (“‘[U]nauthorized alien’ means . . . that the alien is not at that \ntime . . . authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the Attorney General.”); see \nalso 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  Yet the Fifth Circuit found DAPA reviewable because it \n“would affirmatively confer ‘lawful presence’ and associated benefits.”  Texas, 809 F.3d \nat  166.    Moreover,  some  have  argued  that  DACA  only  masquerades  as  a  program \ninvolving individualized discretion and in fact amounts to an entitlement of benefits for \nthe class of aliens who meet the program’s threshold criteria.  Again, the Fifth Circuit \nreached a similar conclusion about DAPA.  See id. at 171–76.      \n  But neither side presses such an argument in this case, and for good reason.  The \ngovernment does not because it claims DACA’s rescission is unreviewable.  Nor do the \nplaintiffs, because if they did, their case would be much harder on the merits.  DACA \nrelied on identified individualized enforcement as a necessary predicate for the program’s \nexistence.  See The Department of Homeland Security’s Authority to Prioritize Removal \nof Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present in the United States and to Defer Removal of \nOthers, 38 Op. O.L.C. ____, 2014 WL 10788677, at *13 n.8 (Nov. 19, 2014).  If that \npredicate  was  false,  then  DACA  was  almost  surely  procedurally  and  substantively \ninvalid.    And  that  would  mean  one  of  the  Department’s  proffered  explanations  for \nrescinding DACA—that it was likely unlawful—was valid.  Unsurprisingly then, the \nplaintiffs do not rely on this point, giving us no occasion to consider whether DACA \nmight be anything other than what it claimed to be:  a program for a specific exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion. \n47 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 48 of 60\n \n  No other exception makes the plaintiffs’ APA claims reviewable.  In particular, \nnothing  in  the  INA  overcomes  Chaney’s  presumption  of  unreviewability.    That \npresumption “may be rebutted where the substantive statute has provided guidelines for \nthe agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers.”  Chaney, 470 U.S. at 832–33; \nsee  also  Webster  v.  Doe,  486  U.S.  592,  600  (1988)  (“§ 701(a)(2)  requires  careful \nexamination of the statute on which the claim of agency illegality is based[.]”).  Nothing \nin the INA cabins the government’s broad immigration enforcement discretion.  To the \ncontrary, the INA expansively vests the Secretary of Homeland Security with authority \nfor “establishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. \n§ 202(5); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1).  Our nation’s immigration laws do not limit the \nSecretary’s authority to enforce those laws by removing illegal aliens.  As a result, the \nINA does not overcome the presumptive unreviewability of the DACA rescission.        \n \nC.  The generalized nature of DACA does not render its rescission reviewable.  \nThe  Majority  adopts  a  new  exception,  contending  that  general  enforcement \npolicies, unlike individual enforcement decisions, are reviewable.  While this exception \nhas some support in out-of-circuit precedent, I would reject it. \nThis exception is grounded in dictum from Chaney, which left open the possibility \nof review when an agency adopts a “general policy that is so extreme as to amount to an \nabdication of its statutory responsibilities.”  Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4 (emphasis \nadded).  That is, a general policy that licensed illegal conduct across the board or that \ncategorically excluded a class of individuals from complying with the law might well be \nreviewable.   But nobody here is arguing that the rescission of DACA should be so \n48 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 49 of 60\n \ncharacterized.  Nor could they.  A return to the pre-DACA regime would increase the \nDepartment’s enforcement of the immigration laws, not abandon it.     \nA few cases from the D.C. Circuit seem to stretch Chaney’s dictum to encompass \nany  “general  enforcement  policy,”  as  opposed  to  a  “single-shot  nonenforcement \ndecision.”  E.g., OSG Bulk Ships, Inc. v. United States, 132 F.3d 808, 812 (D.C. Cir. \n1998) (quoting Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 676 (D.C. Cir. \n1994)).  The facts of these cases suggest this principle may be narrower than it appears at \nfirst blush.  For example, in some cases, the agency’s policy was promulgated as a \nbinding  regulation  after  notice-and-comment  rulemaking,  which  would  of  course  be \nmuch more amenable to judicial review than a program like DACA, announced by an \ninformal memorandum.  See National Wildlife Federation v. EPA, 980 F.2d 765 (D.C. \nCir. 1992).  It also appears that these cases did not involve programs that, like DACA, \nwere expressly predicated on the agency’s exercise of individualized discretion. \nTo the extent that the D.C. Circuit has embraced the broad principle that any \n“general enforcement policy” is judicially reviewable, that principle simply cannot be \nreconciled  with  Chaney.    There,  the  Supreme  Court  held  unreviewable  the  FDA’s \ncategorical  decision  not  to  take  enforcement  action  against  a  class  of  actors  (drug \nmanufacturers, prison administrators, and others in the drug distribution chain).  470 U.S. \nat 824–25, 837–38.  The fact that the decision was made by the FDA Commissioner \nmade no difference.  See id. at 824.  The D.C. Circuit’s decisions in this area do not even \nattempt  to  explain  how  this  sweeping  principle  can  be  reconciled  with  the  facts  of \n49 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 50 of 60\n \nChaney.  See, e.g., Crowley, 37 F.3d at 675–77.  Indeed, they often have no reasoning, \nsimply reciting language (often dicta) from earlier circuit cases. \nSuch a broad exception for “generalized enforcement policies” would also unduly \ntrammel the Executive Branch in carrying out its duties.  The head of an agency has \nevery right to exercise enforcement discretion.  Standardizing (i.e., generalizing) how \nagents  use  their  prosecutorial  discretion  does  not  alter  its  character.    Whether  the \nSecretary exercises her discretion over an individual case or provides guidance for how \ndiscretion should be applied in a class of cases, the decision is unreviewable as one \n“committed to agency discretion by law.”  Under the plaintiffs’ view, a line agent’s \ndecision not to remove a cancer-stricken alien would be unreviewable, but a front-office \npolicy  directing  line  agents  to  consider  whether  an  alien  is  terminally  ill  would  be \nreviewable.  That distinction is untenable.  See Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1048 \n(5th Cir. 1990) (holding that § 701(a)(2) precluded review of a categorical refusal by a \ndistrict office to grant work authorization and pre-hearing voluntary departure to a certain \nclass of eligible aliens over a three-year period). \nAs anyone who has exercised enforcement discretion knows, supervisory control \nover  that  discretion  is  necessary  to  avoid  arbitrariness  and  ensure  consistency.  \nSupervision  through  generalized  guidance  that  directs  the  exercise  of  enforcement \ndiscretion cannot transform the enforcement directive into a reviewable action.  To find \nthat discretionary enforcement decisions are unreviewable only when inferior officers \nexercise single-shot enforcement decisions also brushes aside the separation of powers \nthat the Constitution lays out.  The President is empowered by Article II to “take Care \n50 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 51 of 60\n \nthat the Laws be faithfully executed,” and thus may hire officers to assist in these duties.  \nBut the constitutional responsibility remains firmly at the President’s feet, and therefore, \nthe President remains responsible for his subordinates’ exercise of executive power.  Free \nEnter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 484 (2010) (“The \nPresident cannot ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed’ if he cannot oversee the \nfaithfulness of the officers who execute them.”).4 \nDACA—at  least  on  its  face—was  just  such  an  unreviewable  exercise  of \nsupervisory enforcement discretion.  It was issued by the Secretary and instructed her \nsubordinates when and how to exercise their discretion, emphasizing that “requests for \nrelief  pursuant  to  this  memorandum  are  to  be  decided  on  a  case  by  case  basis.”  \nNapolitano Memorandum at 2.  Such general decisions on enforcement policy, no less \nthan the individual decisions that flow from them, cannot be reviewed by the courts \n                                              \n4 The supervisory use of prosecutorial discretion is not a novel phenomenon.  See, \ne.g., Treasury Department Circular to the Supervisors of the Revenue (Sept. 30, 1791), in \n9 PAPERS OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON 248–49 (Harold C. Syrett ed., 1965) (advising \nTreasury officials that “a great relaxation appears unavoidable” in enforcing provisions \nfor seizing spirits without required certificates); Ruth Wedgewood, The Revolutionary \nMartyrdom of Jonathan Robbins, 100 YALE L.J. 229, 278, 339–53 (1990) (describing \nPresident Adams’s decision to direct the federal prosecutor to enter a nolle prosequi for \nan allegedly mutinous sailor and describing then-Representative John Marshall’s floor \nspeech defending the Executive’s prosecutorial discretion, see 10 ANNALS OF CONG., 6th \nCong.  1st  Sess.  614–17  (Mar.  7,  1800));  DAVID  P.  CURRIE,  THE  CONSTITUTION  IN \nCONGRESS, THE JEFFERSONIANS: 1801–1829, at 5–6 (2001) (noting President Jefferson’s \n“decision to pardon two individuals who had been convicted under the Sedition Act and \nto quash the pending prosecution of a third”); Letter from Thomas Jefferson to William \nDuane  (May  23,  1801),  in  8  THE  WRITINGS  OF  THOMAS  JEFFERSON  54,  55  (Paul \nLeicester Ford ed., 1897) (explaining that whenever President Jefferson should be met \nwith a prosecution under the Sedition law he would treat it as a nullity and order a nolle \nprosequi).    \n51 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 52 of 60\n \nwithout intruding on the prerogatives of the Executive Branch.  And that is necessarily \ntrue  of  DACA’s  rescission,  which  merely  removed  one  avenue  for  exercising \nindividualized discretion.  As a result, the rescission is an even less viable candidate for \njudicial review than is the promulgation of DACA. \nD.  The Acting Secretary’s use of legal reasoning in rescinding DACA does not \nrender her decision reviewable.  \n  The plaintiffs also argue that the Acting Secretary’s use of legal reasoning in \ndeciding to rescind DACA makes the decision subject to judicial review.  In their view, \ncourts can evaluate legal determinations.   \n  This argument is foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent.  The Supreme Court has \nmatter-of-factly explained that there is no “principle that if the agency gives a reviewable \nreason for otherwise unreviewable action, the action becomes reviewable.”  BLE, 482 \nU.S.  at  283  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    Enforcement  decisions  are  often \nintertwined with legal reasoning,  most obviously “the prosecutor’s belief (sometimes \npublicly stated) that the law will not sustain a conviction.”  Id.  The Court found it \n“entirely clear” that this “reviewable” proposition cannot render the prosecutor’s “refusal \nto prosecute” subject to judicial review.  Id. \n  Efforts to distinguish BLE factually cannot avoid its holding.  In BLE, an agency \nhad refused to reconsider a prior decision on the ground of material error.  The Court \nfound that such denials of reconsideration have “traditionally been ‘committed to agency \ndiscretion by law.’”  Id. at 282 (quoting Chaney, 470 U.S. at 832).  As here, the plaintiffs \nargued  that  the  particular  decision  before  the  Court  should  be  reviewable  anyway, \n52 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 53 of 60\n \nbecause  the  agency  had  based  its  refusal  on  a reviewable  issue  of  law.   The  Court \ndisagreed and held, as noted, that an unreviewable decision does not become reviewable \nby virtue of the reasons provided.  Id. at 280–81.  That holding is plainly not limited to \ncases involving requests for reconsideration.  After BLE, the scope of permissible judicial \nreview must be determined by the type of agency action at issue and not the agency’s \nreasons for acting. \n  Just as in BLE, there is a nonsensical implication in the plaintiffs’ position:  that \nthe Executive’s discretion is more constrained when it gives a “reviewable” reason for its \nactions than when it gives no reason at all.  If the Acting Secretary was wrong about the \nlikely illegality of DACA,5 then this might mean that she had provided no lawful reason \nfor the rescission.  But in the context of the Executive’s enforcement discretion, this is \nperfectly  appropriate.    The  Executive  need  not  explain  why  it  makes  particular \nenforcement  and  non-enforcement  decisions.    The  Judicial  Branch  cannot  bootstrap \nreview of decisions committed to the discretion of the other branches simply because the \nreasons provided are of a type that judges consider themselves competent to evaluate.  \n                                              \n5 Evaluating the actual legality of DACA requires considering whether and how a \ncourt may adjudicate an alleged violation of the Take Care Clause.  See Kendall v. United \nStates ex rel. Stokes, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 524, 613 (1838).  But it also requires addressing \nthe distinct question of whether and how one presidential administration may determine \nthat a previous administration’s policy was inconsistent with the constitutional obligation \nto take care that the nation’s immigration laws be faithfully executed.  Cf. Letter from \nPresident George Washington to Sec’y Alexander Hamilton, U.S. Dep’t of the Treasury \n(Sept. 7, 1792) in 32 WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON 144 (John C. Fitzpatrick ed., \n1939)  (writing  in  1792  about  enforcing  unpopular  tax  laws,  President  Washington \nexplained that it was his “duty to see the Laws executed:  to permit them to be trampled \nupon with impunity would be repugnant to it”).    \n53 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 54 of 60\n \n  In  any  event,  the  Acting  Secretary’s  rescission  memorandum  was  not a  mere \nstatement on the legality of DACA.  Instead, the memorandum considered various court \nrulings  as  well  as  the  Attorney  General’s  letter  before  concluding  that  the  “DACA \nprogram should be terminated.”  Duke Memorandum at 4 (emphasis added).  She did not \nsay that DACA must be terminated or that she lacked the legal authority to enforce \nDACA or a DACA-like program.  And in declaring the rescission of DACA after a six-\nmonth  wind-down  period,  the  Acting  Secretary  invoked  her  statutory  authority  to \n“establish[] national immigration policies and priorities.”  Id.  The Acting Secretary’s \nlegal analysis was only one aspect of her reasoning for rescinding DACA, and, of course, \na prosecutor may consider beliefs about the law when setting enforcement policy, see \nBLE, 482 U.S. at 283.   \n  For these reasons, I conclude that the plaintiffs’ APA claims are not reviewable \nand would dismiss them. \n  \nIII.  Constitutional Claims \nBecause they rule for the plaintiffs under the APA, my colleagues in the Majority \ndecline to address the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.  But because I find the plaintiffs’ \nAPA claims to be unreviewable, I must briefly address their claims that the rescission of \nDACA  also  violates  the  Fifth  Amendment’s  guarantees  of  Due  Process  and  Equal \nProtection.6  I have little trouble concluding that it did not.   \n                                              \n6  Of  course,  courts  may  review  the  exercise  of  enforcement  discretion  for \ncompliance with the Constitution.  See Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464.    \n54 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 55 of 60\n \nA.  Due Process \nThe plaintiffs’ due process claim fails to articulate a constitutionally protected life, \nliberty,  or  property  interest  impacted  by  the  rescission  of  DACA.    And  without  a \nprotected interest, there can be no unconstitutional deprivation.   \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees that “[n]o person \nshall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. \nCONST. amend. V, cl. 4.  A plaintiff raising a due process claim must thus begin by \nidentifying a relevant liberty or property interest.  Wooten v. Clifton Forge Sch. Bd., 655 \nF.2d 552, 554 (4th Cir. 1981).  While a government benefit may create such an interest, \n“a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for [the benefit] . . . .  \nHe must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.”  Bd. of Regents of State \nColleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). \nWhile the plaintiffs argue that DACA created such a claim of entitlement, it did \nnot.  On its face, DACA explicitly conferred no protected property or liberty interest, \nmaking deferred action putatively available on a discretionary case-by-case basis for two-\nyear periods that could be terminated at any time at the Secretary’s discretion.  See \nNapolitano Memorandum at 2–3; AAADC, 525 U.S. at 484–85.  The memorandum itself \nacknowledged that such rights could be conferred only by “Congress, acting through its \nlegislative authority.”  Id. at 3; see also Smith v. Ashcroft, 295 F.3d 425, 429 (4th Cir. \n2002) (noting that for a statute to create a liberty or property interest, “it must confer \nmore than a mere expectation (even one supported by consistent government practice) of \n55 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 56 of 60\n \na benefit”).  Having failed to show a protected interest, the plaintiffs’ due process claim \nfails.   \nThe plaintiffs may have serious concerns about our nation’s immigration laws and \nthe Department’s policy of enforcing those laws.  But an understandable policy concern \nis not a legally cognizable right.  The rescission of DACA simply does not generate a due \nprocess claim.  \nB.  Equal Protection  \nThe  plaintiffs  also  argue  that  the  rescission  of  DACA  violates  the  Fifth \nAmendment’s guarantee of equal protection by targeting a class of aliens for removal \nbased on their race and national origin.  See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954).  \nThey have failed to plausibly allege such a claim.   \nAs  both  parties  acknowledge,  DACA  is  an  enforcement  policy,  and  so  the \nplaintiffs’ challenge to its rescission is necessarily a selective-prosecution claim.7  In an \nordinary  selective-prosecution  case,  the  plaintiffs  would  have  to  show  that  the \ngovernment’s  conduct  “had  a  discriminatory  effect  and  that  it  was  motivated  by  a \ndiscriminatory purpose.”  Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 608 (1985); see also \n                                              \n7 The plaintiffs assert that they are not claiming selective prosecution “but instead \nthat  the  Government  violated  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  by  rescinding  the  DACA \nprogram in order to target a class defined by race and national origin.”  Appellants’ \nResponse Brief at 30.  This attempted rewording makes no difference.  The rescission of \nDACA reset the agency’s enforcement policies to no longer channel the exercise of \nenforcement  discretion  in  a  certain  way.    As  the  plaintiffs  cannot  dispute  that  the \ngovernment has the statutory authority to enforce the immigration laws against them, any \nequal protection claim in this context must necessarily be a selective-prosecution claim.  \n56 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 57 of 60\n \nArmstrong, 517 U.S. at 465 (noting that “the decision whether to prosecute may not be \nbased  on  ‘an  unjustifiable  standard  such  as  race,  religion,  or  other  arbitrary \nclassification’”) (emphasis added) (quoting Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 456 (1962)).  \nThere  is  also  a  “presumption  that  a  prosecutor  has  acted  lawfully,”  which  can  be \ndisplaced only by “clear evidence.”  AAADC, 525 U.S. at 489.  But the plaintiffs’ burden \nis even higher in this case, because the rescission of DACA only applies to aliens who are \nin this country illegally.  Such an alien “has no constitutional right to assert selective \nenforcement as a defense against his deportation,” with a possible exception for “rare” \ncases of particularly “outrageous” discrimination.  Id. at 488, 491.     \nHere, both DACA and its rescission are, on their face, neutral policies.  Logically, \nthe presumption of lawfulness that applies in individual selective-prosecution cases is at \nleast as strong when applied to neutral policies promulgated by senior Executive Branch \nofficials.  And the plaintiffs must allege facts that, if true, plausibly suggest that this \npresumption  can  be  overcome  and  replaced  with  an  inference  of  outrageous \ndiscrimination. \nThe  plaintiffs  have  alleged  two  sets  of  facts  to  support  their  claim  of \ndiscrimination.  First, they argue that since 93% of DACA recipients are Latino, the \nprogram’s rescission had a disparate impact.  A selective-prosecution claim normally \nrequires  differential  treatment  of  “similarly  situated  individuals  of  a  different  race.”  \nArmstrong, 517 U.S. at 465.  Yet who is “similarly situated” to DACA recipients except \nother DACA recipients?  Setting aside the closely related and now-rescinded DAPA \nprogram, DACA stands alone as a unique exercise of Executive authority.  While there \n57 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 58 of 60\n \nare other deferred action programs (many of which are statutory), none resembles DACA.  \nAnd the Department rescinded DACA for all recipients, not just for those of a particular \nethnicity or nationality.    \nSecond, the plaintiffs rely on presidential campaign tweets, which they claim show \ninvidious animus.  But the plaintiffs must create a plausible inference that the same \nanimus allegedly underlying these statements also motivated the Attorney General and \nthe Acting Secretary to take the official government actions at issue.  Their complaint \nsimply lacks the connective tissue required to draw that inference.  There is also an \n“obvious alternative explanation” for these officials’ actions.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n662, 682 (2009).  As the record shows, DACA has long been politically controversial.  It \n“should come as no surprise,” id., that well-known policy differences would lead cabinet \nofficials  in  a  new  administration  to  change  a  controversial  government  policy.    See \nMemorandum from John Kelly, Secretary, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., “Enforcement of the \nImmigration Laws to Serve the National Interest” 2 (Feb. 20, 2017) (setting out the \nAdministration’s new enforcement policies and stating “the Department no longer will \nexempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement”).  Changes \nin government policy are perfectly lawful, and for a selective-prosecution claim, we must \npresume that the Attorney General and the Acting Secretary were motivated by such a \nlawful  purpose.    AAADC,  525  U.S.  at  489.    The  plaintiffs  allege  no  facts  plausibly \ndisplacing that presumption. \n58 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 59 of 60\n \nIn short, the plaintiffs have presented no evidence that racial motivations played \nany part in either the former Attorney General’s advice or the former Acting Secretary’s \ndecision to rescind DACA.  Therefore, I would dismiss the equal protection claim.   \nIV.  Information-Sharing Policy \nThe Majority is correct that the plaintiffs’ estoppel claim against the Department is \nbaseless.  The availability of equitable estoppel against the government is controversial \nunder any circumstances.  See Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 419–21 \n(1990).  The issue remains unresolved by the Supreme Court.  See id. at 423.  And we \nhave recognized that if such a doctrine is ever justified in this context, there must be \n“affirmative misconduct by government agents.”  Dawkins v. Witt, 318 F.3d 606, 611 \n(4th Cir. 2003) (citing INS v. Hibi, 414 U.S. 5, 8 (1973)).   \nIn any case, the mere fact that the Department explicitly told applicants that its \ninformation-sharing policy “may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time” and \nthat the policy “may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit,” J.A. 1004, is \nenough to end our analysis.  There was nothing for the plaintiffs to rely on for the \nproposition that their information was immune from disclosure.   \nAdditionally, even if the doctrine of estoppel applied here, that would not justify \nthe district court’s nationwide injunction.  See Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1930–31, \n1934 (2018); Virginia Society for Human Life, Inc. v. FEC, 263 F.3d 379, 394 (4th Cir. \n2001) (abrogated on other grounds).  This potent judicial tool was largely unheard-of \nuntil the mid-twentieth century.  Samuel L. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the \nNational Injunction, 131 HARV. L. REV. 417, 428 (2017).  These broad injunctions pose \n59 \n \n\nUSCA4 Appeal: 18-1521      Doc: 60            Filed: 05/17/2019      Pg: 60 of 60\n \nmany drawbacks that can quickly outweigh their benefits, particularly when they are \noverused  (and  overused  repeatedly).    Among  other  things,  such  injunctions  sharpen \nplaintiffs’ incentives to forum-shop while inhibiting the proper ventilation of difficult \nlegal issues by deterring other lower courts from grappling with them.  See id. at 460–61.  \nUnder our decentralized and  multifaceted judicial system, judges must scrutinize the \nscope of the injunctive remedies they fashion.  Even assuming a nationwide injunction \ncould be appropriate in some case, an injunction that is limited to the plaintiffs should \ngenerally suffice.   \n*     *    * \nWe in the Judicial Branch have a narrowly circumscribed role.  It is not our place \nto second-guess the wisdom of the discretionary decisions made by the other Branches.  \nThe rescission of DACA was a controversial and contentious decision, but one that was \ncommitted to the Executive Branch.  For this reason, I respectfully dissent.  \n \n60 \n ",

GRIMM     GREENBELT, MARYLAND 20770 \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE     (301) 344-0670 \n       (301) 344-3910 FAX \n \nFebruary 26, 2021 \nRE:  Casa de Maryland et al. v. DHS et al.    \n        17-cv-2942-PWG \nLETTER ORDER \nDear Parties: \n  Pending is the Plaintiffs’ motion for an order to show cause why Defendants should not be \nheld in contempt or, in the alternative, to compel compliance with the Fourth Circuit mandate, \nECF No. 115.  The motion has been fully briefed. ECF Nos. 116, 117.   \nThe Supreme Court, Fourth Circuit, and this Court have each ruled that DHS’s decision to \nrescind the DACA program was arbitrary and capricious.  Pl.’s Mot. 17, ECF No. 115-11 (citing \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915 (2020); Casa de \nMd. v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 924 F.3d 684, 706 (4th Cir. 2019); July 17, 2020 Order, ECF No. \n97 at 3). These decisions required Defendants to accept and consider initial requests for the \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program and applications for advance parole, \nwhich the Government acknowledged.  Ex. A to Pls.’ Mot., ECF 115-2.  Despite this knowledge, \nPlaintiffs state, Defendants “willfully ignored their obligation to restore the status quo ante” (that \nis, to DACA’s status prior to its September 5, 2017 recession), defying the Fourth Circuit’s \nmandate and my July 17 order.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a contempt order against Defendants \nfor their failure to restore the DACA program to its pre-September 5, 2017 status.  Pl.’s Mot. 17.  \nUpon ordering that the rescission of the DACA policy was to be vacated, my July 17, 2020 \norder dismissed the Plaintiff’s constitutional claims in this case and directed the clerk to close the \ncase.  However, the issue of Defendants’ compliance with the Fourth Circuit mandate remained, \nand I held video conference calls on July 24 and 31, 2020 where I ordered the parties to reach an \nagreement for limited discovery prior to Plaintiff’s show cause motion and directed them to submit \na briefing schedule. I approved the parties briefing schedule, ECF No. 111, and the parties \nproceeded to submit their briefs.   \n  On  January  21,  2021,  Defendants  filed  a  Notice  informing  the  Court  of  recently \ninaugurated President Biden’s Memorandum titled “Preserving and Fortifying Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (DACA).”  ECF No. 128.  The memo directs the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity and the Attorney General to preserve and fortify DACA.  \n  In light of this directive from the new administration, it is apparent to me that the issues \nsurrounding compliance with the Fourth Circuit’s mandate and my July 17, 2020 order are being \n \n1   Citations to page number correspond to the CM/ECF pagination, not pagination of the \nparties.  \n\nCase 8:17-cv-02942-TDC   Document 129   Filed 02/26/21   Page 2 of 2\nre-reviewed.  In the interests of judicial economy, the pending motion for an order to show cause, \nECF No. 115, is hereby denied without prejudice while the administration reviews the DACA \nprogram.  The motion is subject to reinstatement by the Plaintiffs if the policy review fails to \naddress the issues raised in Plaintiff’s motion.   \nIt is further ordered that the parties provide the Court with joint status reports every 45 \ndays, the first one due on April 12, 2021, updating me on the status of the administration’s review \nand any other issues pertinent to the resolution of this case.   \nAlthough informal, this is an Order of Court and will be docketed accordingly.    \n  \nSincerely, \n               /s/                        \nPaul W.
