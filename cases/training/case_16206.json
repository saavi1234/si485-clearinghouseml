    "state": "California",
    "summary": "<p>On Oct. 5, 2017, the Inland Empire Immigrant Youth Collective and one of its members sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its components U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and the ACLU's national Immigrants' Rights Project, plaintiffs filed their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.</p><p>The organizational plaintiff is a grassroots association led by immigrant youth. The individual plaintiff, a 23-year-old three-time Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient, is one of its members. In Feb. 2017, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested him and placed him into removal proceedings, on grounds that he had smuggled undocumented immigrants. However, the Immigration Judge rejected this allegation and plaintiff was never charged with any crime. Nevertheless, defendants revoked his DACA status, including his work authorization, and he could not have it reinstated.</p><p>Plaintiffs alleged that in addition to this one incident, defendants were revoking other DACA recipients' status based not on disqualifying convictions, but on minor incidents in criminal records or unsubstantiated suspicions of criminal conduct, including arrests and charges later resolved in the applicants' favor. These status terminations lacked advance notice, a hearing, or an opportunity for reinstatement. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as certification of a nationwide class of people whose DACA status had been unlawfully revoked. Plaintiff argued that, in terminating DACA status without notice and hearing, defendants violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). </p><p>On Oct. 6, this case was assigned to Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald.</p><p>Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on Oct. 18. They argued they were likely to succeed on the merits and that the individual plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm without reinstatement of his DACA status. Plaintiffs pointed to two recent preliminary injunctions of revocation of DACA status without due process, in <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16152\">Gonzales Torres</a></i> and <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15883\">Colotl Coyotl</a></i>.</p><p>On Oct. 30, defendants responded, opposing plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion. Defendants argued that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits, first because the District Court lacked jurisdiction over immigration removal proceedings, and also because DACA was a discretionary DHS program not protected by the Constitution. Plaintiffs replied on Nov. 6. The case was transferred to Judge Philip S. Gutierrez on Nov. 14.</p><p>After a Nov. 20 motion hearing, Judge Gutierrez granted plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion. Judge Gutierrez first held that the individual plaintiff had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his APA claim that defendants' revocation of his DACA, based solely on his deportation proceedings, was arbitrary and capricious. The individual plaintiff had also demonstrated the existence of irreparable harm due to loss of income and job opportunities. Further, neither a balancing of hardships nor the public interest favored defendants. Judge Gutierrez enjoined USCIS's decision to terminate the individual plaintiff's DACA status and accompanying work authorization. 2017 WL 5900061. </p><p>On Dec. 21-29, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, motion for class certification, and motion for preliminary injunction. The amended complaint added two more individual plaintiffs who had also lost DACA status after ICE initiated removal proceedings against them. Plaintiffs sought to certify two nationwide classes of DACA recipients lacking disqualifying criminal convictions: a \"notice class\" (whose status was revoked without notice), and an \"enforcement priority class\" (whose status was revoked after being classified as an enforcement priority). In the preliminary injunction motion, plaintiffs asked the Court to enjoin DHS's revocation of the individual plaintiffs' and proposed class members' DACA and work permits.</p><p>Defendants opposed plaintiffs' amended complaint and motions on Feb. 1-14, 2018. Regarding the class certification motion, defendants argued that they had discretion to revoke DACA without notice once enforcement proceedings started and without court intervention, making class certification instead of individual evaluation improper. As for the preliminary injunction motion and amended complaint, defendants argued that plaintiffs lacked standing and ripeness, the Court lacked jurisdiction, or plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits, because defendants' discretion in revoking DACA was unconstrained by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), APA, or Constitution. Plaintiffs responded on Feb. 12 and later on Mar. 26; defendants replied on Apr. 2. The Court will hold a hearing on Apr. 16.</p><p>On Feb. 26, Judge Gutierrez granted plaintiffs' motions for class certification and a class-wide preliminary injunction. Regarding the class certification motion, Judge Gutierrez held that because plaintiffs committed no disqualifying criminal convictions, they were entitled to notice and opportunity to respond, and so they were properly class members. The class was certified as:<blockquote> All recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") who, after January 19, 2017, have had or will have their DACA grant and employment authorization revoked without notice or an opportunity to respond, even though they have not been convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense.</blockquote>Regarding the preliminary injunction motion, Judge Gutierrez first held that the Court had jurisdiction. Next, he held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claim (that automatic termination was arbitrary and capricious) and would suffer irreparable without an injunction (because of loss of earnings, job opportunities, and drivers' licenses without DACA). 2018 WL 1061408.</p><p>A Mar. 26 order clarified that the class consisted of DACA recipients, not subject to certain disqualifying categories, who have had or will have their DACA and employment authorization terminated without notice or opportunity to respond. The rest of the order specified the procedures by which defendants had to identify and notify the class. </p><p>On Apr. 19, Judge Gutierrez denied defendants' motion to dismiss. First, he held that the organizational and individual plaintiffs had standing, and that the INA did not bar jurisdiction. Next, he held that plaintiffs had stated valid claims under the APA (i.e., that the applicable regulations do not allow automatic DACA revocation on the basis of a removal order, rendering it arbitrary and capricious) and under the due process doctrine (i.e., that the DACA grant is a conferred benefit that requires procedural safeguards before termination).</p><p>Defendants then, on Apr. 26, appealed the preliminary injunction order to the Ninth Circuit, which opened a new docket (No. 18-55564).</p><p>As the parties prepared to file their respective motions for summary judgment and the plaintiffs prepared to file a motion for permanent injunction, on Dec. 21, 2018, Judge Guitierrez ordered the defendants to certify the administrative record (AR) in this case. On Feb. 8, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting the court to order the defendants to complete the AR. The plaintiffs asserted that the AR that the defendants provided was incomplete and did not include all documents directly or indirectly considered by agency decision-makers. The defendants asserted that these \"predecisional documents regarding the policy of terminating DACA with notice were properly withheld from the termination AR because they are protected by deliberative process privilege.\" On Apr. 8, 2019, Judge Guiterrez ordered that the defendants either add these \"predecisional documents\" to the AR or provide a privilege log. The court concluded that the plaintiffs' argument was \"more in line with the Ninth Circuit’s</p><p>instruction that the administrative record should consist all documents directly or <i>indirectly</i> considered by agency decision-makers.'\"</p><p>On June 28, 2019, a Ninth Circuit panel (Circuit Judges Kim Wardlaw, Jay Bybee, and John Owens) issued an order staying the appeal proceedings pending resolution by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\"><i>Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i></a>.</p><p>Following the stay of the appeal proceedings, on July 25, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion to stay further district court proceedings pending the Ninth Circuit's resolution of the preliminary injunction appeal. The defendants opposed this motion, arguing that the plaintiffs would not suffer any irreparable harm absent a stay and requested instead that the court enter an order setting a briefing schedule on cross-motions for summary judgment. Judge Gutierrez granted the plaintiffs' motion on November 7, 2019, concluding that the court cannot properly decide the legal questions here without guidance from the Ninth Circuit in this case and the Supreme Court in <i>Regents</i>. Judge Gutierrez also found that the defendants did not establish that a stay would cause them any damage.  2019 WL 8011739. The Supreme Court heard oral argument in <i>Regents</i> on Nov. 12, 2019, on the issues of whether the DHS's decision to wind down the DACA policy is judicially reviewable and whether DHS’s decision to wind down the DACA policy is lawful.  </p><p>On June 18, 2020, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts (joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor), the Court held  in <i>Regents</i> that the DACA rescission was subject to judicial review under the APA, that the DHS secretary had offered insufficient justification to rescind the program, and that the rescission was unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious in violation of the APA. 140 S. Ct. 1891. </p><p>Following the Supreme Court's decision, the Ninth Circuit lifted the stay on the appeal of the preliminary injunction in this case on June 23, 2020. The Court directed the parties to file briefs addressing the impact of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Regents</i> on this case. In early July 2020, the parties filed their briefs. </p><p>In January 2021, President Biden took office and immediately signed a memorandum directing DHS and the Attorney General “to preserve and fortify DACA.\" The Ninth Circuit again stayed the case on April 7, 2021, pending anticipated rulemaking concerning DACA. The government is to file a status report every three months. As of May 14, 2021, this case is ongoing.</p>",

The Court twice granted preliminary injunctions as well as class certification; defendants have appealed to the 9th Cir. The case was stayed pending resolution of <i>Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i> by the Supreme Court.

Nos. 32, 39, Plaintiffs’ seek a \n4 \nclass-wide preliminary injunction for their proposed class of individuals who have had, or \n5 \nwho will have, their Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) and employment \n6 \nauthorization document (“EAD”) terminated without notice or an opportunity to respond. \n7 \nDkt. No. 40-1, Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Classwide \n8 \nPreliminary Injunction (“PI Motion”). In a separate filing, Defendants oppose the \n9 \nproposed class for lack of jurisdiction and for failure of the proposed class to meet the \n10 \nrequirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b). See Dkt. No. 53.  \n11 \nThe Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief because the class \n12 \nshould not be certified, and even if it is, Plaintiffs’ fail to establish that they can succeed \n13 \non the merits of their claim. This Court lacks jurisdiction to review actions that are \n14 \npredicates to commencing removal proceedings, Plaintiffs cannot state a Constitutional \n15 \nclaim, and Defendants have fully complied with their internal policies, which Plaintiffs \n16 \nmisrepresent and misconstrue. In sum, Plaintiffs cannot establish that an NTA based on \n17 \nunlawful presence is insufficient to terminate DACA without advanced notice, \n18 \nparticularly where the decision to issue the NTA is based on additional findings that the \n19 \nDACA recipient is an EPS concern, or otherwise an enforcement priority. Additionally, \n20 \nthe balance of the equities weigh against Plaintiffs.   \n21 \nBACKGROUND \n22 \nWhen U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) or U.S. Customs and \n23 \nBorder Protection (“CBP”) issues a notice to appear (“NTA”) to a DACA grantee, \n24 \nregardless of the reason selected, there is no requirement in the DACA SOP or elsewhere \n25 \nfor USCIS to make a separate decision to terminate the individual’s DACA or EAD.1 \n26 \n                                                 \n27  1 Defendants incorporate by reference the explanation of the DACA policy, the EAD application process \nfor individuals with no lawful status, and the process by which removal proceedings are initiated through \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n1 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 12 of 35   Page ID #:1746\n \n1 \nRather, the decision to issue an NTA to an individual with DACA is the decision to no \n2 \nlonger defer action against that individual, and the charge selected for the NTA does not \n3 \nhave to reflect DHS’s full reasoning. Nothing restricts DHS’s authority to issue an NTA \n4 \nbecause someone was previously found to warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial \n5 \ndiscretion in the form of deferred action, nor is a criminal conviction or criminal charge \n6 \nnecessary to justify termination of DACA. While the Napolitano Memo and DACA SOP \n7 \nidentify and explain threshold criteria for DACA consideration, nothing limits DHS’s \n8 \ndiscretion to grant, deny, or terminate DACA on a case by case basis.2 Nor is the DACA \n9 \nSOP the only authority establishing the process by which deferred action terminates. \n10 \nOn September 20, 2017, Plaintiff Gil-Robles was arrested and charged with two \n11 \nfelonies, including Assault in the First Degree and transferring a firearm without a \n12 \nbackground check to a prohibited person. See Exhibits A, Decl. of Jeremy Anderson, \n13 \nDkt. No. 53-1 at 4-7; A.1, Gil-Robles Notice to Appear (“NTA”) and Form I-213, dated \n14 \nOct. 23, 2017, Dkt. No. 53-1 at 9-15. On November 6, 2017, ICE issued Gil-Robles an \n15 \nNTA charging him with unlawful presence. Id. On November 14, 2017, USCIS issued \n16 \nPlaintiff a Notice of Action, stating his DACA and EAD terminated automatically with \n17 \nthe NTA. See Pl. Amended Complaint, Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 109.  \n18 \nOn November 3, 2017, Plaintiff De Souza was arrested for Forgery in the First \n19 \nDegree, a felony.3 See Exhibits B, Decl. of Derrick A. Eleazer, Dkt. 53-1 at 17-18; B.1, \n20 \nDe Souza-Moreira NTA and Form I-213, dated Nov. 5, 2017, Dkt. No. 53-1 at 20-24. \n21 \n22                                                   \nNTA issuance, provided in Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Class Certification, Section \n23 \nII.A and B. Dkt. No. 53 at 7-13. \n24  2 In fact, USCIS may still grant DACA to an individual with a disqualifying criminal conviction, See Dkt. \nNo. 53-1 at 70; or deny DACA to an individual with no criminal history. Id. at 38 (“Individuals may be \n25 \nconsidered for DACA upon showing that they meet the prescribed guidelines . . .”); id. at 78 (“USCIS \nlacks the authority to consider requests from individuals who are in immigration detention under the \n26 \ncustody of ICE at the time of filing”). \n27 \n3  Plaintiffs  incorrectly  assert  that  Plaintiff  De  Souza  was  arrested  for  “possession  of  an  altered \n28  identification document—a misdemeanor.” Dkt. No. 40-1 at 12. \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n2 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 13 of 35   Page ID #:1747\n \n1 \nDe Souza admitted to police that he had altered the expiration date on his driver’s \n2 \nlicense due to it expiring. Id. On November 5, 2017, ICE issued De Souza an NTA \n3 \ncharging unlawful presence, and on November 10, 2017, USCIS issued a Notice of \n4 \nAction informing De Souza his DACA and EAD terminated automatically with the \n5 \nNTA. Id. \n6 \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n7 \nRegardless of how the arguments are framed, Plaintiffs directly challenge DHS’s \n8 \nauthority to initiate removal proceedings, which this Court should dismiss for lack of \n9 \nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and 8 \n10 \nU.S.C. § 1252. A claim to restore deferred action that terminated by the initiation of \n11 \nremoval proceedings by definition challenges the agency’s determination to initiate \n12 \nremoval proceedings. Any interpretation of these statutes that permits district court \n13 \nchallenges to actions inextricably linked to the initiation of removal proceedings would \n14 \nrun counter to Congress’s intent, to Supreme Court case law, and to the law of this \n15 \nCircuit. Plaintiffs’ due process challenges must also fail, because they cannot show a \n16 \nprotected interest in DACA or EAD. In fact, to reinstate individual EADs would violate \n17 \nDHS regulations that operate independent of, and superior to, DACA policy. Since ICE \n18 \nalready issued NTA’s with the knowledge of each Plaintiffs’ DACA, and based on DHS’s \n19 \ndeterminations that Plaintiffs’ criminal conduct rendered them enforcement priorities, \n20 \nthere is no reason to expect a different result on a second review.  \n21 \nWere the Court to find it has jurisdiction over these challenges, it should deny \n22 \nPlaintiffs’ motion for failing to meet the requirements necessary to grant a preliminary \n23 \ninjunction. Plaintiffs fail to show a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, or \n24 \nan irreparable harm that this Court can relieve. First, contrary to Plaintiffs’ arguments, \n25 \nDACA policy guides ICE and CBP to continue exercising their prosecutorial discretion \n26 \non a case-by-case basis, and the DACA SOP explicitly recognizes, in multiple places, the \n27 \neffect of NTA issuance on DACA termination. When an NTA issues, DACA terminates \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n3 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 14 of 35   Page ID #:1748\n \n1 \nwith no input from USCIS. Plaintiffs point to nothing that supports their charge that \n2 \nUSCIS must do more, nor have they overcome the presumption that an NTA, even one \n3 \ncharging only unlawful presence, is properly issued. \n4 \nThough it may be a harsh reality, neither Congress nor the Constitution has \n5 \nprovided these Plaintiffs a protected interest in remaining or working in the United \n6 \nStates.4 There is nothing remarkable about these cases: Plaintiffs were apprehended in the \n7 \ncommission of various criminal actions, which DHS law enforcement officers determined \n8 \nwarranted their removal, regardless of any prior eligibility for deferred action. Any \n9 \nclaims arising out of those decisions and actions must be brought in immigration court, \n10 \nand then in a petition for review in a court of appeals if necessary. For these reasons, the \n11 \nCourt should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. \n12 \nARGUMENT \n13 \nI.  Standard of Review \n14 \n“The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative \n15 \npositions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” Univ. of Texas v. \n16 \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). As a result, it is generally inappropriate at the \n17 \n“preliminary-injunction stage to give a final judgment on the merits.” Id.; see Senate of \n18 \nState of Cal. v. Mosbacher, 968 F.2d 974, 978 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that “judgment on \n19 \nthe merits in the guise of preliminary relief is a highly inappropriate result”). \n20 \n  An injunction is “a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should not be granted \n21 \nas a matter of course.” Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 142 (2010). \n22 \nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction “must establish” that: (1) it is likely to \n23 \nsucceed on the merits of its claims; (2) it is likely to suffer irreparable harm absent \n24 \npreliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in its favor; and (4) an injunction is in \n25 \n                                                 \n26  4 Nor is the Government actively pursuing DACA recipients for wholesale termination. Plaintiffs and \nnearly every putative class member they describe had their DACA terminated by DHS because of their \n27 \ninvolvement in criminal activity, a consequence each was informed of since the inception of DACA \n28  policy.  \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n4 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 15 of 35   Page ID #:1749\n \n1 \nthe public interest. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. Preliminary injunctive relief is an \n2 \nextraordinary remedy never awarded as of right, id., and the party seeking such relief \n3 \nbears the burden of establishing the prerequisites to this extraordinary remedy. Earth \n4 \nIsland Inst. v. Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010). In a mandatory injunction \n5 \nrequest such as this, where Plaintiffs seek to order the Government to act, a moving party \n6 \n“must establish that the law and facts clearly favor [their] position, not simply that [they] \n7 \n[are] likely to succeed.” Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015). \n8 \nII.  To the extent the Court does not certify a class, a preliminary injunction \n9 \nproviding class-wide relief is inappropriate. \n10  Where an injunction provides class-wide relief, “effective review of the injunction \n11  requires review of the class certification.” Paige v. California, 102 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th \n12  Cir. 1996). Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 999 (9th Cir. 2012); see also Zepeda v. \n13  INS, 753 F.2d 719, 728 n.1 (9th Cir. 1983). Because class certification is inappropriate \n14  here, see Dkt. No. 53, this Court should find granting Plaintiffs’ class-wide relief is also \n15  inappropriate.5 Relatedly, even if a class is certified, “system-wide injunctive relief is not \n16  available based on alleged injuries to unnamed members of a proposed class.” Hodgers-\n17  Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1045 (9th Cir. 1999) (citations omitted).  \n18 \nIII.  Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits. \n19  Plaintiffs are not likely, and indeed, cannot succeed on the merits of their claims because \n20  the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s APA and Constitutional claims, and Plaintiff’s \n21  arguments fail on the merits. First, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review any putative class \n22  member’s challenge to DHS’s discretionary determination to issue an NTA which had the \n23  result of automatically terminating DACA and EADs. The putative class cannot state a \n24  claim because there is no protected entitlement to DACA or employment authorization. \n25 \n                                                 \n26  5 Defendants maintain that no class should be certified. In part, DHS found all three named plaintiffs to \nbe enforcement priorities, which disqualifies them from joining the putative class, and certainly from \n27 \nrepresenting class members. Dkt. No. 39-1 at 9 n.2 (“This motion does not address the proposed \n28  ‘Enforcement Priority’ Class pled in Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, filed this same date.”). \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n5 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 16 of 35   Page ID #:1750\n \n1 \nFinally, nothing in the APA or constitutional jurisprudence, nor Defendants’ own policies \n2 \nand guidance, supports a right to review or constrain DHS’s exercise of discretion or to \n3 \ngrant Plaintiffs procedural rights other than those available through removal proceedings.  \n4 \nA. DHS’s discretion to initiate removal proceedings and their effect on the \n5 \ntermination of Plaintiffs’ DACA is not reviewable. \n6  The APA permits persons aggrieved by final agency action to obtain judicial review in \n7  federal court where “there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” See 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. A \n8  reviewing court shall set aside agency action found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n9  discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” or “without observance of procedure \n10  required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). However, the APA precludes judicial review of \n11  agency decisions when “statutes preclude judicial review,” or when the decision is “committed \n12  to agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), (a)(2); see Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, \n13  830 (1985) (“even where Congress has not affirmatively precluded review, review is not to be \n14  had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to \n15  judge the agency's exercise of discretion.”).  \n16  Congress enacted 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) to specifically preclude judicial review of the \n17  discretionary decision to initiate removal proceedings, and the actions and decisions arising out \n18  of such decisions. See Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (“AADC”), 525 U.S. 471, \n19  483-85 (1999) (finding section 1252(g) also precludes review of the discretionary decision to \n20  not initiate removal proceedings). Furthermore, in Heckler, the Supreme Court held that “an \n21  agency’s decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed immune from \n22  judicial review under § 701(a)(2).” 470 U.S. 821, 832. Thus, there are two reasons APA \n23  jurisdiction is not available here. First, there is no separate decision to terminate DACA in these \n24  cases because a DHS law enforcement officer decided, in consideration of each plaintiff’s \n25  felonious criminal activity, to initiate removal proceedings and issued an NTA that \n26  automatically terminated DACA; and second, even if the Court found a separate decision was \n27 \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n6 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 17 of 35   Page ID #:1751\n \n1 \nmade, there is still no standard in the SOP or otherwise by which the Court may review a \n2 \ndecision that deferring action is no longer in the Government’s interest.  \n3 \nAdditionally, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims \n4 \nbecause Plaintiffs necessarily lack a protected constitutional interest in the process by \n5 \nwhich their DACA is terminated, because the ultimate relief they seek – deferred action – \n6 \nis discretionary. Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).  \n7 \ni.  The INA Limits Review of Plaintiffs’ Claims, which Arise from \n8 \nDHS’s Decision to Commence Plaintiffs’ Removal Proceedings. \n9  Congress eliminated judicial review over “any cause or claim by or on behalf of \n10  any alien . . . arising from the decision or action . . . to . . . adjudicate cases . . .” 8 U.S.C. \n11  § 1252(g). The issuance of an NTA is a necessary predicate to commencing removal \n12  proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). Through section 1252(g), Congress explicitly precluded \n13  judicial review of any challenge arising from any decision or action to commence \n14  removal proceedings. See AADC, 525 U.S. 471, 483-85. The Supreme Court explained \n15  that section 1252(g) was “directed against a particular evil: attempts to impose judicial \n16  constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.” Id. at 485 n.9; see AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 \n17  (treating “‘no deferred action’ decisions” as “discretionary determinations”); cf. Silva v. \n18  United States, 866 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir. 2017) (§ 1252(g) precludes review of decision \n19  to execute removal order even where claim that agency lacked discretion because \n20  removal violated law).  \n21  Section 1252(g) encompasses “cause[s] or claim[s]” that arise from the decision \n22  “or action” to “commence proceedings” against any individual. See, e.g., Sissoko v. \n23  Rocha, 509 F.3d 947, 948-50 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding claim of money damages arose \n24  from decision or action to commence removal proceedings and was, thus, barred by 8 \n25  U.S.C. § 1252(g)).6 A DACA grant is acknowledgement that DHS is not presently \n26                                                   \n6 Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2004), is distinguishable from this case and Sissoko, where \n27 \nthe issuance of Plaintiffs’ NTAs occurred before, and were the direct cause of, termination of Plaintiffs’ \n28  DACA and EADs.  \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n7 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 18 of 35   Page ID #:1752\n \n1 \npursuing removal against an individual. Thus, when DHS finds an individual has become \n2 \nan enforcement priority and issues an NTA, DACA will logically terminate.  \n3 \nIndeed, because issuance of an NTA and termination of DACA are steps “leading \n4 \nup to” a final order of removal, they are squarely within the scope of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). \n5 \nSee, e.g., Botezatu v. INS, 195 F.3d 311, 314 (7th Cir. 1999) (citing AADC, 525 U.S. at \n6 \n944 (discussing the scope of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) as including “various decision . . . \n7 \nleading up to order consequent upon final orders of deportation.”)); Alcaraz v. INS, 384 \n8 \nF.3d 1150, 1160-61 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding review of the reopening of removal \n9 \nproceedings, but not the administrative closure of proceedings, was barred from review as \n10 \nan action related to the decision to commence removal). To hold otherwise would render \n11 \nsection 1252(g) a dead letter because any individual could seek to enjoin or otherwise \n12 \nchallenge the commencement of removal proceedings through this type of creative \n13 \npleading. See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, 246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that “a \n14 \npetitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by \n15 \ncloaking [a claim] in constitutional garb”).7  \n16 \nThere can be no reasonable argument that DACA termination by NTA issuance \n17 \ndoes not arise out of the decision to initiate removal proceedings, such that 8 U.S.C. \n18 \n§ 1252(g) would not bar this Court from reviewing that hypothetical second decision. \n19 \nSee, e.g., Vilchiz-Soto v. Holder, 688 F.3d 642, 644 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding section \n20 \n1252(g) barred jurisdiction to review the BIA’s discretionary decision to not reopen \n21 \nremoval proceedings to consider a DACA request).8 \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n7 In analogous circumstances, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the applicability of Section \n24  1252(g)  to  bar  district  court  review  of  the  automatic  termination  of  discretion-based  employment \nauthorization documents following the commencement of removal proceedings, in accordance with 8 \n25 \nC.F.R. § 274a.12(c). See Gupta v. Holder, No. 611CV1731ORL35GJK, 2011 WL 13174873, at *1 (M.D. \nFla. Oct. 31, 2011), aff’d sub nom. Gupta v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 485 F. App’x 386 (11th Cir. 2012)  \n26 \n8 This authority is consistent with earlier case law interpreting the 1981 Operating Instructions, a previous \n27 \npolicy that provided guidelines for the exercise of deferred action.  See Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 \n28  F.2d 1021, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985). \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n8 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 19 of 35   Page ID #:1753\n \n1 \nTo the extent that Plaintiffs have any viable claims, the REAL ID Act, codified at 8 \n2 \nU.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9), bars them from raising those claims in district \n3 \ncourt, even before a final order of removal issues. Section 1252(a)(5), entitled \n4 \n“[e]xclusive means of review,” requires that “a petition for review filed with an \n5 \nappropriate court of appeals . . . shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review \n6 \nof an order of removal . . . .” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5). Section 1252(b)(9) provides \n7 \n“[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application \n8 \nof constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding \n9 \nbrought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available \n10 \nonly in judicial review of a final order under this section.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) \n11 \n(emphasis added); see, e.g., J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1038 (district court lacked jurisdiction \n12 \nover challenge to adequacy of removal procedures, and instead court of appeals has \n13 \nauthority to resolve questions of constitutional rights on review of a final removal order).  \n14 \nImportantly, the Ninth Circuit found that Section 1252(b)(9) is “a clear statutory \n15 \nprescription against district court review” of challenges arising from removal proceedings \n16 \nfor plaintiffs who had not yet received final orders of removal. See J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at \n17 \n1035-38 (“The minors . . . attempt to get around [section 1252(b)(9)] by claiming that \n18 \nthey have been (or will be) denied meaningful judicial review in light of their juvenile \n19 \nstatus.”) (emphasis added). While the Court acknowledged that “an unrepresented minor \n20 \nin immigration proceedings poses an extremely difficult situation,” it also found “these \n21 \nconsiderations cannot overcome a clear statutory prescription against district court \n22 \nreview. Relief is through review in the court of appeals or executive or congressional \n23 \naction.” Id. at 1036-1038.9 \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n9 The Court’s previous reliance on Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2007), to support section \n1252(b)(9) applying only to a final order of removal is misplaced because that language is dicta and \n26 \nconflicts with the plain language of the statute. Dkt. No. 31 at 7. Singh brought a challenge of ineffective \n27  assistance of counsel through a habeas petition, and the Court found that the challenge was not tied to \nremoval proceedings, so section 1252(b)(9) did not apply regardless of whether a final order had issued. \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n9 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 20 of 35   Page ID #:1754\n \n1 \nThus, Congress’s intent was simple and uncontroversial: if the issue is one that can \n2 \nbe raised in removal proceedings, and ultimately in a petition for review, then the statute \n3 \nprecludes district court review. See id. at 1034 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 173 \n4 \n(statute was “intended to preclude all district court review of any issue raised in a removal \n5 \nproceeding”)); cf. Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 9-10 (“Congress plainly intended to put an end to \n6 \nthe scattershot and piecemeal nature of the review process . . . .”). This approach \n7 \neffectuates the general rule precluding simultaneous review of a question by both an \n8 \nadministrative body and a federal court. See Acura of Bellevue v. Reich, 90 F.3d 1403, \n9 \n1408-9 (9th Cir. 1996).  \n10 \nHere, Plaintiffs challenge the Secretary’s discretion to issue NTAs that have the \n11 \neffect of terminating DACA. See Dkt. No. 40-1 at 8-9. Thus, Plaintiffs’ challenges \n12 \nnecessarily arise from “action taken or proceedings brought to remove an alien,” for \n13 \nwhich district courts lack jurisdiction. Accordingly, this Court should find that Plaintiffs \n14 \ncannot show either a likelihood of success or that the law and facts clearly favor their \n15 \nposition. Garcia, 786 F.3d at 740. \n16 \nii.  Judicial Review of DACA Termination Based on NTA Issuance is \n17 \nalso Barred under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). \n18  There is no judicial review under the APA of decisions that “courts traditionally \n19  have regarded as ‘committed to agency discretion.’” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 \n20  (1993) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)). These decisions are typically unreviewable \n21  because there exists “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \n22  exercise of discretion.” Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985). This bar applies \n23  even when “the agency gives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action.” \n24  ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng’rs, 482 U.S. 270, 283 (1987) (“BLE”). \n25                                                   \nSingh, 499 F.3d at 978-79. To interpret Singh as permitting district court challenges such as those raised \n26  here runs counter to Congressional intent, and would effectively excise the words “any action taken” from \nthe statute. See Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 10; cf. Martinez v. Napolitano, 704 F.3d 620, 623 (9th Cir. 2012) (an \n27 \nAPA claim “challeng[ing] the procedure and substance of an agency determination that is ‘inextricably \n28  linked’ to the order of removal” must be channeled through the petition for review process). \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n10 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 21 of 35   Page ID #:1755\n \n1 \nThe decisions committed to executive discretion include “an agency’s exercise of \n2 \nenforcement power.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. Such judgments involve “a complicated \n3 \nbalancing of factors which are peculiarly within [an agency’s] expertise,” including \n4 \n“whether agency resources are best spent on this violation or another, whether the agency \n5 \nis likely to succeed if it acts, whether the particular enforcement action requested best fits \n6 \nthe agency’s overall priorities, and, indeed, whether the agency has enough resources to \n7 \nundertake the action at all.” Id. As there is “no meaningful standard against which to \n8 \njudge the agency’s exercise of discretion” in weighing these factors, an agency’s exercise \n9 \nof enforcement powers is “presumed immune from judicial review under § 701(a)(2).” Id. \n10 \nat 830, 832. For instance, an “agency decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether \n11 \nthrough civil or criminal process, is a decision generally committed to an agency’s \n12 \nabsolute discretion.” Id. at 831. \n13 \nAn agency’s decision to enforce the law against a particular individual is likewise \n14 \npresumptively unreviewable. Just as “the decision whether or not to prosecute” \n15 \npresumptively “rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s] discretion,” United States v. Armstrong, \n16 \n517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (citation omitted), an agency’s decision to bring a civil \n17 \nenforcement action is generally not open to judicial scrutiny. Considerations such as the \n18 \nChaney factors are equally present in enforcement decisions as in nonenforcement \n19 \ndecisions. See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831; see also Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, \n20 \n607-8 (1985) (“[T]he decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review”). \n21 \nOne form of that broad discretion is deferred action, a “discretionary and \n22 \nreversible” decision to notify an alien that DHS has chosen not to seek his removal for a \n23 \nspecific period of time. Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Like other \n24 \nagency nonenforcement decisions, grants of deferred action rest on a complex balancing \n25 \nof policy considerations that cannot serve as “meaningful standard against which to judge \n26 \nthe agency’s exercise of discretion.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. The converse is equally \n27 \ntrue: denials of deferred action are also committed to agency discretion. See AADC, 525 \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n11 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 22 of 35   Page ID #:1756\n \n1 \nU.S. at 485 (treating “‘no deferred action’ decisions” as “discretionary determinations”). \n2 \nBecause “[g]ranting an illegally present alien permission to remain and work in this \n3 \ncountry” is fundamentally “a dispensation of mercy,” there are “no standards by which \n4 \njudges may patrol its exercise.” Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1051 (5th Cir. 1990) \n5 \n(INS’s decision not to grant pre-hearing voluntary departures and work authorizations to \n6 \na group of aliens was non-justiciable).  \n7 \nEven in situations in which an agency has promulgated regulations or provided \n8 \ninternal guidance, decisions involving the exercise of prosecutorial discretion are \n9 \ngenerally not subject to judicial review. See Pasquini v. Morris, 700 F.2d 658, 659 (11th \n10 \nCir. 1983) (holding that Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) Operating \n11 \nInstructions regarding deferred action did not confer substantive rights on an alien and \n12 \ncourts could not review a claim that INS failed to comply with these internal \n13 \ninstructions); see also Carranza, v. I.N.S., 277 F.3d 65, 72-3 (1st Cir. 2002) (“Whether or \n14 \nnot the INS exercised its discretion is therefore beside any relevant point” as “petitioner \n15 \ndid not have a right to demand the exercise of this discretion in the first place”); cf. \n16 \nUnited States v. Lee, 274 F.3d 485, 492 (8th Cir. 2001) (reversing a finding that a criminal \n17 \ndefendant can force the Department of Justice to comply with its death penalty protocol). \n18 \nThus, individual DACA terminations, especially where based on issuance of NTAs, \n19 \nfall squarely within that category of agency discretion for which judicial review is \n20 \nimproper. See Chaney, 470 F.3d at 830; see also Morales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822, \n21 \n828 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting that “the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a type of \n22 \ngovernment action uniquely shielded from and unsuited to judicial intervention”).10 In the \n23 \ncases of putative class members, there is no legal question with regard to the DACA \n24 \n                                                 \n25  10  Plaintiffs’  reliance  on  cases  that  discuss  violations  of  non-discretionary  procedures  in  agency \nregulations are inapposite where deferred action and related employment authorization are entirely \n26  discretionary concepts not tied to statute or regulation. See Dkt. No. 16-2 at 18, 20, citing Singh v. Bardini, \nNo. 09-cv-3382, 2010 WL 308807, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2010) & Singh v. Vasquez, No. 08-cv-1901, \n27 \n2009 WL 3219266, at *5 (D. Ariz. Sept. 30, 2009), aff’d 448 F. App’x 776 (9th Cir. 2011) (both addressing \n28  questions of regulatory procedures for asylum termination outside of removal proceedings).  \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n12 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 23 of 35   Page ID #:1757\n \n1 \nguidelines, because the DACA guidelines merely allow an individual to seek a \n2 \ndiscretionary administrative grace in the form of DACA. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 38 \n3 \n(“Individuals may be considered for DACA upon showing that they meet the prescribed \n4 \nguidelines . . .”). DACA is unlike immigration benefits where eligibility is defined by \n5 \nstatute or regulation, and for which Courts have found that review of the non-\n6 \ndiscretionary denial of such benefits may be reviewed.11  \n7 \nHere, Plaintiffs are challenging DHS’s exercise of its enforcement power granted \n8 \nby Congress. See Dkt. 40-1 at 30 (seeking to “enjoin Defendants from terminating \n9 \nPlaintiffs’ and proposed class members’ DACA and EADs”). This is a classic challenge to \n10 \nDHS’s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. This type of \n11 \nenforcement decision involves a balancing of factors committed to agency discretion by \n12 \nlaw, including how to allocate agency resources. See id.; Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464. The \n13 \nquestion for DHS was not whether it could exercise its discretion in favor of the \n14 \nPlaintiffs, but rather whether it should do so under the circumstances of each case. \n15 \nBecause this type of discretionary determination is committed to DHS discretion by law, \n16 \nthis Court lacks jurisdiction to review Plaintiffs’ claims. \n17 \niii.  Plaintiffs Cannot State a Constitutional Claim because the \n18 \nTermination of DACA does not Implicate a Constitutional Interest. \n19  Plaintiffs assert incorrectly that they have “gained a protected interest in their \n20  DACA, which authorized them to live and work in the United States until the expiration \n21  date of their DACA grants, and therefore have a right to a fair procedure before it can be \n22  revoked.” Dkt. No. 40-1 at 21. However, Plaintiffs necessarily lack a protected \n23                                                   \n11 The Court’s reliance on United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc) and \n24 \nMadu v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 470 F.3d 1362 (11th Cir. 2006) is misplaced. In both cases, courts reviewed \n25  a “purely legal question” that set the stage for a discretionary decision. However, the DACA SOP \nidentifies threshold criteria for DACA consideration, but it does not mandate granting DACA if those \n26  threshold criteria are met. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 38 (“Individuals may be considered for DACA upon \nshowing that they meet the prescribed guidelines . . .”). Even if the Court finds those criteria enforceable, \n27 \nthey are not the subject of the exercises of prosecutorial discretion to issue NTAs based on criminal \n28  conduct, which terminate DACA notwithstanding compliance with the threshold criteria.  \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n13 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 24 of 35   Page ID #:1758\n \n1 \nconstitutional interest in their DACA and in the process to terminate DACA, because the \n2 \nultimate relief sought – deferred action – is discretionary, and because the Government \n3 \nnever expressed a mutual intention to confer a protected benefit in DACA.  \n4 \nThe “Due Process Clause does not protect everything that might be described as a \n5 \n‘benefit.’” Castle Rock, 545 U.S. at 756. Particular due process rights must be established \n6 \non the basis of entitlement to a property or liberty interest, the risks of loss associated \n7 \nwith deprivation of that interest, and the competing interests of the government in not \n8 \nproviding that interest. Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982), quoting Mathews v. \n9 \nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334-335 (1976). DACA recipients face these circumstances \n10 \ngiven that they are living illegally in a country where they are not citizens. The Court \n11 \nmay view this circumstance as unfortunate, but neither the Constitution nor Congress \n12 \nprovides an individual in unlawful status a protected interest in living or working in the \n13 \nUnited States, or in discretionary relief from removal. Garcia v. Holder, No., 07-60271, \n14 \n320 F. App’x 288, 290 (9th Cir. April 9, 2009); Pilapil v. INS, 424 F.2d 6, 11 (10th Cir. \n15 \n1970), cert denied, 400 U.S. 908 (1970).  \n16 \nNor can Plaintiffs claim a Constitutional interest based on entitlement. “To have a \n17 \nproperty interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or \n18 \ndesire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have \n19 \na legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Blantz v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr. & Rehab., 727 F.3d \n20 \n917, 922 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, \n21 \n577 (1972)); see also Mendez-Garcia v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 655, 665 (9th Cir. 2016) \n22 \n(underscoring that aliens cannot claim a cognizable due process interest in discretionary \n23 \nimmigration relief or benefits). The Supreme Court has held that even a practice of \n24 \n“generously” granting a “wholly and expressly discretionary state privilege” does not \n25 \ncreate a legal entitlement to that benefit. See Regents of Univ. of California v. United \n26 \nStates Dep’t of Homeland Sec. (“Regents”), No. C 17-05211 WHA, 2018 WL 339144, at \n27 \n*4  (citing Gerhart v. Lake Cnty., Mont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020-21 (9th Cir. 2011)) (“A \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n14 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 25 of 35   Page ID #:1759\n \n1 \nperson’s belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how sincerely or \n2 \nreasonably held, does not create a property right if that belief is not mutually held by the \n3 \ngovernment.”). \n4 \nPlaintiffs’ proposed class consists exclusively of individuals with no lawful status, \n5 \nthus no protected interest in living or working in the United States. DACA policy has \n6 \nnever purported to alter that, nor may this Court. Landon, 459 U.S. at 35 (“The role of the \n7 \njudiciary . . . does not extend to imposing procedures that merely displace congressional \n8 \nchoices of policy.”). Because DACA is discretionary, it does not give rise to a protected \n9 \nright to work in the United States. See Dkt. No. 16-28, Pl. Exhibit 24, DACA Grant \n10 \nApproval letter, dated August 20, 2016, at 2 (“This form does not constitute employment \n11 \nauthorization, nor may it be used in place of an [EAD].”). Nor does DACA confer lawful \n12 \nstatus. See Dkt. No. 16-13, Pl. Exhibit 9, 2012 Napolitano Memo (“This memorandum \n13 \nconfers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.”). A grant of \n14 \nDACA is not protection from removal. See Dkt. No. 16-23, DACA FAQ at Q:27 (“DACA \n15 \nis an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be terminated at any \n16 \ntime, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.”).  \n17 \nPlaintiffs’ claims regarding an interest in employment authorization and other \n18 \npublic benefits like driver’s licenses are particularly misplaced, because there is no right \n19 \nto the receipt of either, and no judicial review of the decision to terminate EAD once \n20 \ngranted. Pilapil, 424 F.2d at 11; see also Perales, 903 F.2d at 1047-48 (“[T]here is \n21 \nnothing in the [INA] expressly providing for the grant of employment authorization . . . to \n22 \naliens who are the beneficiaries of approved petitions”) (vacating the challenged portion \n23 \nof the injunction); Gupta, 2011 WL 13174873 at *1 (finding a challenge to the \n24 \ntermination of EAD upon initiation of removal proceedings was an impermissible \n25 \nchallenge to the discretionary decision to initiate removal proceedings). In the context of \n26 \nPlaintiffs’ claims here that they have a right to DACA and therefore EADs, the Ninth \n27 \nCircuit has refused the same proposition. See Neri, 229 F. App'x at 508 (an individual \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n15 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 26 of 35   Page ID #:1760\n \n1 \n“has no substantive due process right to discretionary relief from removal or \n2 \ndeportation.”); Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding no liberty \n3 \ninterest in discretionary forms of relief from deportation).  \n4 \nPlaintiffs’ reference to cases addressing U.S. citizens’ constitutional interest in \n5 \nchoosing their own field of employment, see Dkt. No. 40-1 at 25, simply misses the \n6 \npoint. Noncitizens who are here illegally do not have a constitutional right to remain in \n7 \nthe United States, much less a right to work in the United States. Cf. Hoffman Plastic \n8 \nCompounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U.S. 137, 151-52 (2002) (holding, as a general matter, an \n9 \nindividual who is not authorized to work in the United States does not have a right to \n10 \nwork). In fact, every individual with employment authorization based on 8 C.F.R. \n11 \n§ 274a.12(c), including those with deferred action, is subject to automatic termination of \n12 \ntheir EAD with the filing of an NTA with an immigration court. See 8 C.F.R. \n13 \n§ 274a.14(a)(1)(ii); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.13, 1003.14. No notice or opportunity to respond is \n14 \nafforded to any deferred action recipient in this posture, and Plaintiffs point to nothing \n15 \nthat supports a contrary finding. Cf. Gupta, 2011 WL 13174873 at *1 (denying challenge \n16 \nto automatic EAD termination). Because EAD termination is not tied to operation of the \n17 \nDACA SOP, Plaintiffs’ claims of harm regarding EAD loss must fail. Further, the DACA \n18 \nSOP instructs USCIS to defer to existing law and regulations where there is any conflict \n19 \nwith the SOP. See Dkt. No. 16-24 at 17, DACA SOP Chapter One (“Any provision of the \n20 \n[INA] or 8 C.F.R. found . . . to be in conflict with this SOP will take precedence over the \n21 \nSOP.”). Thus, it is inappropriate to find the SOP’s silence regarding termination of \n22 \nDACA-based EAD due to NTA issuance by CBP or ICE creates entitlement to a process \n23 \nnot provided for by the duly promulgated regulation. \n24 \nFurthermore, under DHS regulations, an individual with deferred action who has \n25 \nlost his EAD due to having been placed into removal proceedings may reapply for an \n26 \nEAD if he or she becomes eligible again under a category of subsection 274a.12(c). Only \n27 \nif employment authorization is granted again would the individual then be eligible to \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n16 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 27 of 35   Page ID #:1761\n \n1 \napply to their state authority for a driver’s license or Social Security card. ADAC, 757 \n2 \nF.3d at 1061; Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 149 (5th Cir. 2015) (an individual’s \n3 \naccess to a Social Security number is predicated on possession of EAD, not DACA). \n4 \nThus, the peripheral benefits Plaintiffs cite to illustrate the urgency of the relief they seek \n5 \nare two steps removed from the relief this Court can grant.12  \n6 \nFor these reasons, and because Plaintiffs by definition concede removability and \n7 \nchallenge only termination of a discretionary temporary grant of deferred action from \n8 \nremoval, “the Court cannot conclude that the government has deprived [plaintiffs] of \n9 \n[their] liberty interest in remaining in the United States without due process of law.” \n10 \nMendez de Leon v. Reno, No. C 97-02482 CW, 1998 WL 289321, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Mar. \n11 \n26, 1998). Therefore, the Court should deny their request for injunctive relief. \n12 \nB. Nothing in the Constitution or APA Establishes a Right that Constrains \n13 \nDHS’s Exercise of Discretion. \n14  Even if this Court finds that it would have jurisdiction over any of Plaintiffs’ \n15  claims, the Court should still deny Plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief because \n16  Plaintiffs’ merits claims fail as a matter of law. Here, Plaintiffs cannot establish either an \n17  administrative or a constitutional right to receive any process regarding the termination of \n18  DACA because deferred action is necessarily an exercise of the Executive’s prosecutorial \n19  discretion. See Regents, 2018 WL 339144 at *18 (“Congress has been free to constrain DHS’s \n20  discretion with respect to granting deferred action, but it has yet to do so.”). In fact, DHS acted \n21  based on that discretion by issuing an NTA based on Plaintiffs’ criminal activity. At that \n22  point, the limited grace a temporary grant of DACA serves to recognize was overridden \n23  by the Government’s determination that Plaintiffs had become enforcement priorities. See \n24  Dkt. No. 53-1 at 4-7, 17-18. Defendants respectfully disagree with the Court’s prior order \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n12 None of the provisions that Plaintiffs cite at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)–(3) and 1621(d) depends directly \n28  on the receipt of DACA. \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n17 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 28 of 35   Page ID #:1762\n \n1 \ngranting a preliminary injunction to Plaintiff Arreola, see Dkt. No. 31, and endeavor to address \n2 \nthat order here. Id. at 9, 11, 12. \n3 \ni.  Agency Guidance Places no Limit on ICE or CBP’s Authority to Act \n4 \nAgainst Identified Enforcement Priorities by Issuing an NTA that \n5  terminates DACA. \nPlaintiffs frame their argument as a challenge to USCIS’s failure to follow \n6 \nprocedures required by the DACA SOP before terminating their DACA and EADs. See \n7 \nDkt. No. 40-1 at 15-17. Plaintiffs argue that there is no process in the SOP that provides \n8 \nfor termination of DACA based solely on an NTA issued by ICE or CBP. Id. at 16. The \n9 \nCourt too, has similarly accepted this argument, finding that: \n10 \nThere appears to be only one narrow circumstance in which automatic termination \n11 \nbased on an NTA is appropriate—when an NTA is issued after USCIS determines \n12 \nthat a disqualifying offense or public safety concern is deemed to be “Egregious \n13  Public Safety” (“EPS”). DACA SOP at 137. This is not the case here, as Plaintiff’s \nNTA was issued on the basis of presence without admission, not EPS. \n14 \n15  Dkt. No. 31 at 11. These conclusions are inconsistent with the law and agency policy for \n16  the reasons stated below. \n17  ii.  DACA termination by NTA is provided for in the DACA SOP and \npolicy documents, and in DHS policy and regulations.  \n18 \nThere is no support in the Napolitano Memo for the proposition that DACA policy \n19 \nlimits ICE or CBP’s authority to issue NTAs that will have the effect of terminating \n20 \ngrants of deferred action, like DACA. See Dkt. No. 16-13. Contrary to the Court’s \n21 \nprevious finding, the Napolitano memo does not limit this authority only for the period \n22 \n“as DACA was developed.” Dkt. No. 31 at 12.  \n23 \nNor does DHS guidance prevent immigration enforcement agencies from \n24 \nterminating DACA by issuing an NTA. The authority to issue an NTA is vested with all \n25 \nDHS immigration officers. See 8 C.F.R. § 239.1(a). However, DHS divides NTA \n26 \nissuance responsibility between USCIS in its administrative capacity, and ICE and CBP \n27 \nin their law enforcement capacities. See 2011 NTA Memo, Dkt. No. 16-25. USCIS is \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n18 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 29 of 35   Page ID #:1763\n \n1 \nrequired to refer all cases involving criminal conduct, not limited to Egregious Public \n2 \nSafety (“EPS”), to ICE. Id. at 5. USCIS’s decision to issue an NTA on its own under \n3 \nsuch circumstances must follow ICE’s lead. Id. at 5 & 6 (“USCIS will not issue an NTA \n4 \nin these cases if ICE declines to issue an NTA.”) (emphasis added); id. at 2 (“USCIS \n5 \nmust ensure that its issuance of NTAs fits within and supports the Government’s overall \n6 \nremoval priorities . . . .”). When a case is referred by USCIS, ICE may issue an NTA \n7 \nthat automatically terminates DACA, with no additional notice or opportunity to \n8 \nrespond. See Dkt. No. 16-24 at 39.  \n9 \nThe effect of NTA issuance on DACA termination is unremarkable, and is \n10 \nrecognized elsewhere in the DACA SOP. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 91-92 (providing that \n11 \nUSCIS will deny, without advance notice and an opportunity to respond, a DACA \n12 \nrequest from an individual in immigration detention who ICE intends to release but who \n13 \nICE indicates is an enforcement priority). While the SOP instructs USCIS to “discuss” a \n14 \ndisagreement it may have with ICE’s finding, id., there is no provision permitting USCIS \n15 \nto reverse ICE’s decision. See Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898, 901 (3d Cir. 2016) \n16 \n(finding no jurisdiction based on Section 1252(g) to review an ICE officer’s unilateral \n17 \ndenial of a DACA request to a detained individual because “that decision involves the \n18 \nexercise of prosecutorial discretion not to grant a deferred action.”).13 \n19 \nIndeed, where DHS has worked to ensure that ICE’s determination that someone is \n20 \nan enforcement priority would not be conflicted by a later discretionary exercise by \n21 \nUSCIS to grant deferred action in the form of DACA, and where the Napolitano Memo \n22 \nspecifically preserves the NTA authority of ICE and CBP upon consideration of the \n23 \n                                                 \n24 \n13 The Court’s prior order improperly concludes that the SOP termination chapter requires USCIS to \n25  adjudicate a termination after ICE has issued an NTA for EPS. Dkt. No. 31 at 9. While the NTA Memo \nstates “ICE’s issuance of an NTA allows USCIS to proceed with adjudication . . . ,” Dkt. No. 16-25 at 5 \n26  (emphasis added), the guidance is optional and the DACA SOP explicitly diverges from it in important \nways. The DACA SOP termination chapter instructs USCIS to follow the NTA Memo, but also states that \n27 \nICE’s issuance of an NTA on an EPS referral from USCIS “will result in the termination of DACA.” Dkt. \n28  No. 16-24 at 38; see also id. at 34 (“USCIS “will deny the DACA request.”) (emphasis added).  \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n19 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 30 of 35   Page ID #:1764\n \n1 \nDACA guidelines, it takes a particularly strained reading of the Napolitano Memo and \n2 \nDACA SOP to find that ICE and CBP cannot issue NTAs that have the effect of \n3 \nterminating DACA. In fact, the scenario that the Court’s and Plaintiffs’ interpretation of \n4 \nDefendants’ guidance would create, that ICE would institute new administrative removal \n5 \nproceedings against an individual while that individual seeks additional separate legal \n6 \nprocess regarding the termination of their DACA, is absurd – stripping the immigration \n7 \nenforcement agencies of their most critical authority. Regents, 2018 WL 339144, at *1 \n8 \n(“One of the key enforcement tools under the INA is removal, i.e., deportation. In turn, \n9 \n‘[a] principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by \n10 \nimmigration officials.’”), citing Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012).14 \n11 \nDHS’s discretion to initiate removal proceedings that have the effect of terminating \n12 \nDACA is not impeded by DACA policy in any way.  Accordingly, the Court should deny \n13 \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  \n14 \niii.  There is no requirement that an NTA charge more than unlawful \n15 \npresence, nor is it arbitrary to rely on the decision to issue an NTA. \n16  Plaintiffs argue, and this Court agreed, that USCIS impermissibly relies on only \n17  unlawful presence as the charge listed in an NTA as the sole basis to terminate DACA. \n18  Dkt. No. 31 at 6, 10: Dkt. No. 32 at ¶¶ 159, 165. However, that conclusion relies on a \n19  starkly oversimplified consideration of the NTA decision process. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 53-1 \n20  at 9-15, 20-24 (summaries of the information considered in Plaintiffs’ NTA issuances). \n21  Plaintiffs also assert an inaccurate reading of Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42 (2011), for \n22  the mistaken proposition that an immigration officer’s charging decision to issue an NTA \n23  that only charges unlawful presence is categorically capricious and cannot be the basis to \n24  terminate an individual’s DACA and EAD. Dkt. No. 40-1 at 14-18. There is no basis in \n25                                                   \n14 The fact that USCIS may grant DACA to nondetained aliens in removal proceedings or with final \n26  orders of removal does not change this analysis. Just as USCIS has the discretion to grant DACA to those \nrequestors based on the totality of circumstances, nothing in DHS policy or guidance prohibits ICE, CBP, \n27 \nor USCIS from similarly exercising discretion to terminate DACA on a case by case basis as an exercise \n28  of agency discretion. \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n20 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 31 of 35   Page ID #:1765\n \n1 \nthe SOP or other DACA-related guidance for the Court to find that an NTA charging \n2 \nremovability on the basis of presence without admission is not sufficient to terminate \n3 \nDACA. Nor can Plaintiffs establish that an individual in receipt of an NTA based on \n4 \nunlawful presence cannot also have been found to be an EPS concern, or otherwise an \n5 \nenforcement priority.  \n6 \nFirst, the charges listed in an NTA are not dispositive of the reasons for issuing an \n7 \nNTA.15 DHS is under no obligation to charge an individual with anything more than \n8 \nunlawful presence. Addy v. Sessions, 696 F. App’x 801, 804 (9th Cir. 2017) (rejecting \n9 \nargument that petitioner should have been charged with removability under a different \n10 \nstatute, because “[t]he Attorney General has prosecutorial discretion over the initiation of \n11 \nremoval proceedings, and that discretion is not reviewable.”). Rather, the decision to \n12 \nissue an NTA is based on the immigration officer’s experience and information, and – \n13 \nmost importantly – his or her discretion. See Hernandez v. Gonzales, 221 F. App’x 588, \n14 \n589–90 (9th Cir. 2007) (“Absent evidence to the contrary, we presume that the \n15 \nimmigration officers properly discharged their duties when issuing Hernandez’s NTA.”) \n16 \n(citations omitted). Notably, an NTA also need not include charges used to support the \n17 \ndenial of relief from removal. Salviejo–Fernandez v. Gonzales, 455 F.3d 1063, 1066 (9th \n18 \nCir. 2006) (denying due process claim where the BIA found petitioner ineligible for \n19 \ncancellation of removal based on a conviction not alleged in the NTA). \n20 \nHere, the nature of discretion exercised in issuing an NTA that has the effect of \n21 \nterminating DACA is nothing like the process the Judulang Court found arbitrary. The \n22 \nJudulang Court rejected the BIA process of interpreting and comparing the removability \n23 \ncharges on an individual’s NTA against a list of charges under 8 U.S.C. § 1182 that \n24 \n25                                                   \n15 This proposition is wholly consistent with the denial portion of the DACA SOP, which provides that, \n26  while to be considered, the charges filed in an NTA are not determinative to the ultimate discretion \ndecision regarding DACA. Dkt. No. 53-1 at 65 (“Do not rely solely on the grounds listed in the charging \n27 \ndocument [. . . ;] review all derogatory information in its totality and then make an informed assessment \n28  regarding the appropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion for DACA.”).  \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n21 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 32 of 35   Page ID #:1766\n \n1 \ncomposed grounds for exclusion of an arriving alien, to determine whether the individual \n2 \nfacing removal was eligible for a form of discretionary relief from removal originally \n3 \nreserved for arriving aliens. 565 U.S. at 489-90. The Court equated the process to flipping \n4 \na coin, such that some violent criminals would be eligible for relief while some LPRs \n5 \nwith lesser offenses would be excluded. Id. at 487 (finding the process had “no \n6 \nconnection to the goals of the deportation process or the rational operation of the \n7 \nimmigration laws.”). Here, DACA termination does not hinge on how the NTA is \n8 \nselected, but rather whether the NTA is selected. \n9 \nMoreover, the facts here demonstrate that immigration officer decisions to issue \n10 \nNTAs that have the result of terminating DACA are not “happenstance,” Dkt. No. 40-1 at \n11 \n17; but rather, NTA issuance that results in the termination of DACA represents a valid \n12 \nand thoughtful exercise of agency discretion. The facts here demonstrate that immigration \n13 \nenforcement officers: (1) were specifically aware of each Plaintiffs’ DACA, see Dkt. No. \n14 \n53-1 at 9-15, 20-24; (2) did not rely solely on unlawful presence in decisions to initiate \n15 \nremoval against Plaintiffs. Id.; see also Dkt. No. 23-2 at 26 (“Prosecution for Alien \n16 \nSmuggling was declined for ARREOLA.”); id. (Agency chief “approved removal \n17 \nproceedings for ARREOLA in the furtherance of the United States Government \n18 \ninterest.”); and (3) may issue NTAs after supervisory review or consultation with agency \n19 \ncounsel. See Dkt. No 53-1 at 6 ¶ 11.   \n20 \niv.  DACA termination by NTA is not a reversal of agency policy.  \n21 \nPlaintiffs’ charge that the termination of their DACA is a “reversal” in violation of \n22 \nthe APA is also mistaken. See Dkt. No 40-1 at 18, citing FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \n23 \nInc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). Fox only applies to changes in agency policy. See 556 \n24 \nU.S. at 514 (holding that when an agency changes policy, it must show no more than that \n25 \nit “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.”). \n26 \nHere, Defendants’ policy has not changed. The initial grant of DACA is heavily qualified \n27 \nwith warnings that it is not protection from removal or a change in legal status, and that it \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n22 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 33 of 35   Page ID #:1767\n \n1 \nmay be terminated at any time, specifically for subsequent criminal activity. See, e.g., \n2 \nDkt. No. 16-23, DACA FAQ at Q:27 (DACA “may be terminated at any time, with or \n3 \nwithout a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.”); Dkt. No. 16-28 (DACA \n4 \ntermination is “likely” following subsequent criminal activity). The automatic \n5 \ntermination of Plaintiffs’ DACA and EADs here, as a result of the decision to pursue \n6 \nremoval proceedings against plaintiffs due to criminal activity, is well within DACA SOP \n7 \npolicy and practice, and demonstrates that there is no change in policy or practice as it \n8 \napplies to the putative class or individuals. Dkt. No. 23-2, Declaration of Ron Thomas, ¶ \n9 \n5 (identifying examples of automatic termination of DACA due to NTA issuance going \n10 \nback to 2013); see also Chemehuevi Indian Tribe v. Brown, No. \n11 \nEDCV161347JFWMRWX, 2017 WL 2971864, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2017) (“The \n12 \nagency's consistent practice of approving compacts with duration provisions . . . in an \n13 \narea within its expertise is itself entitled to at least traditional deference under Skidmore v. \n14 \nSwift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), due, in part, to the agency's specialized experience in \n15 \n[these] matters.”). Indeed, all that has happened in cases like those of the putative class is \n16 \nthat DHS has determined that those DACA recipients have become enforcement \n17 \npriorities, often based on their unlawful activity. Such entirely appropriate changes of \n18 \nmind regarding this exercise of discretion are analogous to the Ninth Circuit’s holding \n19 \nthat Fox did not apply to an agency’s “evolving analysis” that “was not a change in a \n20 \npublished regulation or official policy”). Sierra Club v. Bureau of Land Management, 786 \n21 \nF.3d 1219, 1226 (9th Cir. 2015). \n22 \nEven if Fox were applicable, the notices of action issued by USCIS following NTA \n23 \nissuance that automatically terminate DACA are not arbitrary and capricious under Fox, \n24 \nbecause USCIS demonstrates an awareness that it has taken a different position regarding \n25 \na putative class member’s DACA, see, e.g., Dkt. No. 16-12 (acknowledging prior DACA \n26 \ngrant and notifying recipient “that your deferred action as a childhood arrival and your \n27 \nemployment authorization terminated as of the date your NTA was issued.”); and that \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n23 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 34 of 35   Page ID #:1768\n \n1 \nthere is a good reason for the different position, see id. (basing the termination on ICE’s \n2 \nissuance of an NTA). Fox requires nothing more. 556 U.S. at 515 (requiring an agency \n3 \n“display awareness that it is changing position,” and “show that there are good reasons \n4 \nfor the new policy. . . .”, but the agency “need not demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction \n5 \nthat the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices \n6 \nthat the new policy is permissible under the statute”). \n7 \nC. The Remaining Preliminary Injunction Factors Favor Defendants. \n8 \nWhere the Government is the opposing party, the balance of equities and public \n9 \ninterest factors merge. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). Defendants have strong \n10 \ninterests in enforcing U.S. immigration laws effectively and consistent with the statutory \n11 \nremoval scheme. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 490 (“There is always a public interest in prompt \n12 \nexecution of removal orders [to end] a continuing violation of United States law.”). Here, \n13 \nthe process Plaintiffs have received is adequate given the ultimately discretionary policy \n14 \nat issue and the Government’s strong interest regarding immigration enforcement. And \n15 \nwhile the loss of the ability to work is a significant harm, it is outweighed by the need for \n16 \nDefendants to pursue removal for individuals like the named Plaintiffs who have misused \n17 \nthe trust given to them with the administrative grace of DACA.  \n18 \nMoreover, Plaintiffs’ effort to reinterpret DHS’s consistent position regarding \n19 \nNTA issuance and DACA and EAD terminations would create absurd results. First, a \n20 \nclass-wide injunction requiring the reinstatement of DACA and employment \n21 \nauthorization would be contrary to DHS regulations regarding the termination of \n22 \nemployment authorization upon the initiation of removal proceedings. Second, the \n23 \nefficacy of the additional process that Plaintiffs seek is questionable because DHS and its \n24 \ncomponents have already exercised prosecutorial discretion to end the putative class \n25 \nmembers’ DACA by deciding instead to place them into removal proceedings – \n26 \nregardless of their original or continued ability to meet the threshold criteria to request \n27 \nDACA. Indeed, where Plaintiffs hang everything on proving that they meet the threshold \n28 \n   \n \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n24 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 54   Filed 02/01/18   Page 35 of 35   Page ID #:1769\n \n1 \nDACA guidelines, they fail to establish any likelihood Defendants would come to a \n2 \ndifferent conclusion were the Court to order such a re-adjudication of their claims. \n3 \nCONCLUSION \n4 \n  Where injunctive relief is not appropriate to the extent the Court denies Plaintiffs’ \n5 \nmotion for class certification, and alternatively, where Plaintiffs can neither meet the \n6 \nlesser burden of establishing a likelihood of success on the merits to be granted a \n7 \ntemporary injunction nor the higher standard necessary to obtain a permanent reversal of \n8 \nDefendants’ termination of their DACA through issuance of NTAs, the Court should deny \n9 \nPlaintiffs’ motion for class-wide injunctive relief. \n10 \n \n11 \nDATED: February 1, 2018  Respectfully Submitted, \n12   \nCHAD A.

The Court held that Defendants’ automatic termination of Mr. \n6  Arreola’s DACA based on the filing of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) that charged him \n7  with removal for being present in the United States without admission was arbitrary \n8  and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n9  (“APA”). See Doc. No. 31, Order Granting Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (“PI Order”) at \n10  3-13. Defendants’ revocation of his DACA, despite the absence of any disqualifying \n11  convictions, also violated the APA by arbitrarily reversing, without a reasoned \n12  explanation, the agency’s decision to grant him DACA in the first place. See id. at 10-\n13  11. And Defendants’ failure to provide Mr. Arreola with notice and an opportunity to \n14  respond to its termination decision violated the rules of the DACA program. See id. at \n15  10-11. \n16  Mr. Arreola’s example reflects Defendants’ widespread practice of unlawfully \n17  revoking similarly situated immigrants’ DACA grants and work permits without \n18  process, even though they continue to meet the requirements of the DACA program. \n19  Like Mr. Arreola, Plaintiff José Eduardo Gil Robles lost his DACA after being \n20  charged with driving after cancellation of his license, and Plaintiff Ronan Carlos De \n21  Souza Moreira lost his DACA after being charged with possession of an altered \n22  identification document—both misdemeanor offenses that do not disqualify them \n23  from DACA. Indeed, Defendants have admitted that U.S. Citizenship and \n24  Immigration Services (“USCIS”) has a practice of automatically terminating DACA \n25  based solely on the issuance of an NTA and argued that, under its own policies, \n26  USCIS may terminate DACA without providing individuals notice or an opportunity \n27  to respond. See Doc. No. 23-2 (Decl. of Ron Thomas) at 79-81. Countless young \n28  immigrants have been unlawfully stripped of their DACA and work authorization \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 7 of 30   Page ID\n #:1490\n1  pursuant to Defendants’ policies and practices or face the unlawful termination of \n2  their DACA in the future. \n3  As this Court has already recognized, Defendants’ revocation of proposed class \n4  members’ DACA and employment authorization is arbitrary, capricious, contrary to \n5  law, and conflicts with the government’s own rules, in violation of the APA. The \n6  revocation also violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. As with Mr. \n7  Arreola, Defendants’ actions have caused proposed class members ongoing \n8  irreparable harm, including severe emotional distress and loss of employment and the \n9  ability to support themselves and their families. Issuance of a preliminary injunction is \n10  particularly urgent here. Because of the imminent end of the DACA program, \n11  proposed class members have only limited time remaining on their DACA grants and \n12  will lose that limited time absent preliminary relief from this Court.  \n13    For these reasons, and because they satisfy the other injunction factors, \n14  Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to grant a classwide preliminary injunction; \n15  vacate and enjoin Defendants’ unlawful revocation of Plaintiffs Gil’s, Plaintiff \n16  Moreira’s, and proposed class members’ DACA and work permits; and enjoin \n17  Defendants from revoking Plaintiffs’ and proposed class members’ DACA and work \n18  permits pursuant to their unlawful policies and practices in the future.  \n19  BACKGROUND1 \n20    I.  The DACA Program \n21    Deferred action is a longstanding form of administrative action by which the \n22  federal Executive Branch decides, for humanitarian or other reasons, to refrain from \n23  seeking a noncitizen’s removal and to authorize his continued presence in the United \n24  States. Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 484 (1999). On \n                                           \n25 \n1   Along with Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification filed this same day, \n26  Plaintiffs have filed declarations in support of both that motion and the instant motion. \nThose declarations are the Declaration of Katrina L. Eiland, Declaration of José \n27 \nEduardo Gil Robles, and Declaration of Ronan Carlos De Souza Moreira, cited herein.  \n28  Plaintiffs incorporate these declarations by reference. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 8 of 30   Page ID\n #:1491\n1  June 15, 2012, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) \n2  announced DACA—a deferred action program specifically for young immigrants who \n3  came to the United States as children and are present in the country without formal \n4  immigration status.2 \n5    Under DACA, young immigrants who entered the United States as children \n6  who meet specified educational and residency requirements, and who pass extensive \n7  criminal background checks, are eligible to receive deferred action. Napolitano Memo \n8  at 1-2. These enumerated eligibility criteria include the requirements that DACA \n9  recipients not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor,3 or multiple \n10  other misdemeanors. Id. \n11    A predicate for eligibility for the DACA program is that the individual must \n12  lack a lawful immigration status (because he or she is present without admission, or \n13  overstayed a visa). Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 at 44 (DHS DACA Standard Operating \n14  Procedures). In addition, the fact that a noncitizen is, has been, or will be in removal \n15  proceedings does not disqualify the individual from the program. Napolitano Memo at \n16  2. \n17    Deferred action through DACA is provided for a renewable period of two years, \n18  and DACA recipients may obtain an Employment Authorization Document (“EAD”) \n19  and a Social Security Number. See id.at 3. A decision to grant or deny a deferred \n20                                             \n2   See Doc.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference Doc. Nos. 16-4 to 16-29 \n23 \n(Kwon Decl. and exhibits). \n24  3   A significant misdemeanor is a conviction for an offense of “domestic violence; \nsexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug \n25 \ndistribution or trafficking; or, driving under the influence; or . . . [a conviction] for \n26  which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days.” Kwon \nDecl. ¶ 20, Ex. 19 at 19-20 (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Frequently \n27 \nAsked Questions about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (updated Oct. 6, \n28  2017)).  \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 9 of 30   Page ID\n #:1492\n1  action application or renewal is independent of any proceedings in immigration court; \n2  a noncitizen who is in removal proceedings can apply for DACA separately and \n3  simultaneously. Id.at 2. See also, e.g., Gonzalez Torres v. DHS, No. 17-cv-1840, 2017 \n4  WL 4340385, at *6 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017) (noting that “an immigration judge has \n5  no jurisdiction to reinstate DACA status, or to authorize an application for renewal of \n6  DACA status”). USCIS is the division of DHS responsible for evaluating requests for \n7  DACA. DHS’ DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“DACA SOPs”) set forth the \n8  procedures that the agency must follow in adjudicating and granting DACA \n9  applications, as well as in terminating DACA and EADs granted through the program. \n10  See PI Order at 2; Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 (“DACA SOPs”) at 16 (“This SOP is \n11  applicable to all Service Center personnel performing adjudicative and clerical \n12  functions or review of those functions. Personnel outside of Service Centers \n13  performing duties related to DACA processing will be similarly bound by the \n14  provisions of this SOP.”); id.

PI Order at \n4  1-2.7 \n5   \n6    II.  Defendants’ Unlawful DACA Termination Practices  \n7  Defendants have engaged in a widespread practice of unlawfully revoking \n8  individuals’ DACA grants and work permits without process, even though these \n9  individuals have not violated the terms of the program and continue to be eligible for \n10  it. \n11  Multiple DACA recipients around the country have been detained by \n12  immigration authorities since President Trump took office. For example, in early \n13  September, ten DACA recipients were detained for hours by CBP at a checkpoint in \n14  Texas even though they have valid DACA.8 Although they were ultimately released, \n                                           \n15 \n6   Kwon Decl. ¶ 15, Ex. 14 (Memorandum from Acting Secretary Elaine C.

Plaintiff José Eduardo Gil Robles (“Gil”), now 24 years old, has \n3  lived in the United States since he was five. Declaration of José Eduardo Gil Robles \n4  (“Gil Decl.”) ¶ 1. He has five younger siblings, all of whom are U.S. citizens, and is \n5  very active in his Catholic church. Id. ¶¶ 3, 5. USCIS granted him DACA in 2015 and \n6  renewed it in August 2017. Id. ¶¶ 9, 10. Until he lost his DACA, he worked at a \n7  logistics company, and paid about half his family’s rent and bills. Id. ¶¶ 11-12. On \n8  September 20, 2017, he was arrested and ultimately charged with driving on a \n9  cancelled license, which was linked to the validity of his first DACA grant. Id. ¶ 14. \n10  Even if convicted, the offense would not have disqualified him for DACA. But a \n11  month later, he was arrested at work by immigration agents, who placed him in \n12  removal proceedings. Id. ¶ 15. Like Mr. Arreola, whose preliminary injunction motion \n13  this Court already granted, Mr. Gil found out that USCIS automatically terminated his \n14  DACA upon the issuance of a Notice to Appear in removal proceedings—even though \n15  Mr. Gil was charged only with presence without admission. Id. ¶¶ 15, 22. Losing his \n16  DACA has caused Mr. Gil to lose his job and has harmed his family, which relied on \n17  him for support. Id. ¶¶ 24-26. It has also caused him emotional harm, leading him to \n18  become hopeless and depressed. Id.   \n19  Plaintiff Ronan Carlos De Souza Moreira (“Moreira”) lives in the Atlanta area \n20  with his family, most of whom are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. \n21  Declaration of Ronan Carlos De Souza Moreira (“Moreira Decl.”) ¶¶ 1, 5-6.  He is 24 \n22  years old and has lived in the United States since middle school, becoming a youth \n23  leader in his church, volunteering and traveling, and rising to the position of \n24  installation manager at a flooring firm. Id. ¶¶ 2-3, 6, 9. The government approved Mr. \n25  Moreira’s application for DACA three times—in 2013, 2015, and 2017.  Id. ¶ 7; see \n26  also id. ¶ 27, Ex. C. But after being charged with possession of an altered \n27  identification document—a misdemeanor that would not per se render him ineligible \n28  for DACA even if he were convicted—Mr. Moreira lost his DACA without any \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 13 of 30   Page ID\n #:1496\n1  notice, process, or explanation. Id. ¶¶ 14, 18-19. Like Mr. Arreola and Mr. Gil, Mr. \n2  Moreira found out that his DACA was automatically terminated upon the issuance of \n3  a Notice to Appear in removal proceedings—even though Mr. Moreira was charged \n4  only with overstaying a visa. Id. The loss of DACA has upended Mr. Moreira’s life, \n5  causing him emotional harm and leaving him unable to plan for the future. Id. ¶¶ 20-\n6  22. \n7   \n8  ARGUMENT \n9  The Court should issue a preliminary injunction. To prevail, Plaintiffs must \n10  show: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) likely irreparable harm in the \n11  absence of such relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in their favor, and (4) that \n12  an injunction is in the public interest. Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 \n13  F.3d 1053, 1060 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, \n14  20 (2008)). Plaintiffs satisfy all four factors.  \n15   \n16  I.  THE PLAINTIFF CLASS IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS. \n17  Plaintiffs and the proposed class are likely to succeed on their APA claims, \n18  which are substantially the same as the claims raised by Plaintiff Arreola, and as to \n19  which this Court has already found a substantial likelihood of success. See PI Order at \n20  3-13. The proposed Plaintiff class is also likely to succeed on the merits of the \n21  procedural due process claim. \n22  First, as this Court has concluded, Defendants’ practice of automatically \n23  terminating DACA when immigration authorities file a NTA—including based solely \n24  on presence without admission to the United States or overstaying a visa—is arbitrary \n25  and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA. See PI Order at 8-13. \n26  Second, Defendants’ practice of revoking DACA for individuals who lack any \n27  disqualifying criminal convictions without process is unlawful under the APA because \n28 \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 14 of 30   Page ID\n #:1497\n1  it reflects the agency’s reversal of its decision to grant DACA in the first place, \n2  without providing a reasoned explanation for the change. See PI Order at 10-11. \n3  Third, Defendants’ failure to provide DACA recipients with notice and an \n4  opportunity to respond violates the rules governing the DACA program, see PI Order \n5  at 10-11, is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA, and \n6  violates the Due Process Clause.  \n \n7 \nA. DHS’ Automatic Termination of DACA Based Solely on the Issuance of an \n8  NTA Is Arbitrary and Capricious in Violation of the APA. \n9  For multiple reasons, Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA based solely \n10  on the issuance of an NTA charging the DACA recipient with presence without \n11  admission or overstaying a visa is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in \n12  violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  See PI Order at 8-13. \n13  The Supreme Court has made clear that under § 706(2)(A), “agency action must \n14  be based on non-arbitrary, ‘relevant factors.’” Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 55 \n15  (2011) (citation omitted). Judulang emphasized that “courts retain a role, and an \n16  important one, in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.” \n17  Id. at 53. “When reviewing an agency action, [courts] must assess, among other \n18  matters, ‘whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and \n19  whether there has been a clear error of judgment.’” Id. (citation omitted). \n20  In Judulang, the Supreme Court considered a Board of Immigration Appeals \n21  (“BIA”) rule governing eligibility for a form of relief—suspension of deportation—\n22  which was not provided for in the Immigration and Nationality Act, and was therefore \n23  entirely discretionary. 565 U.S. at 46-47. Although the relief was ultimately within the \n24  agency’s discretion, the Court made clear that the rules applied by the agency with \n25  respect to that relief must still reflect reasoned decisionmaking. The Court emphasized \n26  that “[a] method for disfavoring deportable aliens . . . that neither focuses on nor \n27  relates to an alien’s fitness to remain in the country—is arbitrary and capricious.” Id. \n28  at 55. The Supreme Court ultimately invalidated the BIA rule because it was based on \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 15 of 30   Page ID\n #:1498\n1  “a matter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this country,” and concluded that \n2  the BIA therefore “has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.” Id. at \n3  53.  See also PI Order at 8-9 (discussing Judulang). \n4  Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA based solely on the issuance of an \n5  NTA charging unlawful presence in the United States fails this test for multiple \n6  reasons. First, as this Court has concluded, DHS’ practice is arbitrary and irrational \n7  because “a noncitizen’s deportability due to unauthorized presence in the United \n8  States . . . provides no relevant basis for terminating DACA.” PI Order at 9. As the \n9  Court has explained, the Napolitano Memorandum and DACA SOPs “enumerate the \n10  relevant considerations for a DACA grant, and not only is unauthorized presence an \n11  unmentioned factor, but the program was specifically designed for persons without \n12  lawful immigration status.” PI Order at 9. Nothing in those rules suggests that the fact \n13  that a noncitizen is subject to removal because he lacks a lawful immigration status is \n14  a basis for denial or termination. Indeed, the DACA rules indicate the opposite—the \n15  fact that a person is present without admission or has overstayed his visa is irrelevant. \n16  See, e.g., DACA SOPs at 44. This is because the lack of a lawful immigration status in \n17  the United States is a predicate for eligibility for DACA and is a fact that is therefore \n18  true of every DACA recipient. Id. Because the lack of a lawful immigration status is a \n19  factor common to every single DACA recipient, and is wholly irrelevant to whether an \n20  individual is eligible for DACA, the issuance of an NTA charging presence without \n21  admission or visa overstay does not provide a reasoned basis for terminating DACA. \n22  Second, as this Court has concluded, “[t]he program’s rules also make clear that \n23  even noncitizens who are, have been, or will be placed in removal proceedings are \n24  nonetheless eligible for DACA.” PI Order at 9. The rules thus reinforce the conclusion \n25  that an NTA based on presence without admission to the United States does not \n26  provide a reasoned basis for termination. The Napolitano Memorandum itself requires \n27  that the eligibility “criteria are to be considered whether or not an individual is already \n28  in removal proceedings or subject to a final order of removal.” Napolitano Memo at 2. \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 16 of 30   Page ID\n #:1499\n1  See also Kwon Decl. ¶ 17, Ex. 16 (Dougherty Statement) (“The 2012 memorandum \n2  also made clear that individuals could be considered for DACA even if they were \n3  already in removal proceedings or were subject to a final removal order.”). \n4  Implementing this command, the SOPs provide that “[i]ndividuals in removal \n5  proceedings may file a DACA request.” DACA SOPs at 71. Indeed, even individuals \n6  with final removal orders can be granted DACA. See, e.g., id. at 74 (providing that \n7  individuals with final removal orders may be considered for DACA); id. at 75 \n8  (providing that an individual who has been removed after issuance of a final removal \n9  order, re-entered, and is subject to reinstatement of that removal order continues to be \n10  eligible for DACA). Cf. Matter of Quintero, 18 I. & N. Dec. 348, 350 (BIA 1982) \n11  (explaining in context of removal proceedings that “the respondent can request \n12  deferred action status at any stage in the proceeding”). Further, the DACA SOPs \n13  provide that if an NTA is issued against a DACA applicant while his application is \n14  pending with USCIS—even if the NTA is based on a public safety concern—USCIS \n15  should “proceed with adjudication . . . , taking into account the basis for the NTA.” \n16  See Kwon Decl. ¶ 22, Ex. 21 (Revised Guidance for the Referral of Cases and \n17  Issuance of Notices to Appear (NTAs) in Cases Involving Inadmissible and \n18  Removable Aliens (Nov. 7, 2011)) , at 4 ( “ICE’s issuance of an NTA allows USCIS \n19  to proceed with adjudication . . . , taking into account the basis for the NTA”); DACA \n20  SOPs at 93 (providing that if ICE accepts a case referred to it by USCIS during the \n21  DACA application process, then USCIS “will follow the standard protocols outlined \n22  in the November 7, 2011 NTA memorandum”).   \n23  In such cases, USCIS is required to review all relevant circumstances, and may \n24  grant the DACA request “[i]f a DACA requestor has been placed in proceedings on a \n25  ground that does not adversely impact the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.” \n26  DACA SOPs at 75. See also PI Order at 9; DACA SOPs at 74 (providing that for \n27  DACA applicants with final removal orders, “[f]inal removal orders . . . should be \n28  reviewed carefully to examine the underlying grounds for removal”). As this Court \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 17 of 30   Page ID\n #:1500\n1  has concluded, given that the filing of an NTA against a DACA applicant, or even the \n2  issuance of a final order of removal against a DACA applicant, does not render the \n3  individual ineligible for the program, DHS’ practice of automatically terminating \n4  DACA on this basis is arbitrary and irrational.  PI Order at 9-10. \n5  Third, DHS’ practice of automatically and categorically terminating DACA \n6  based on an NTA is arbitrary and capricious because the agency fails, despite \n7  proposed class members’ continued eligibility for the program, to consider the \n8  relevant facts and circumstances and exercise its individualized discretion. This failure \n9  to consider each individual’s specific circumstances undermines the very purpose of \n10  the DACA program. See Napolitano Memorandum at 2 (explaining that “[o]ur \n11  Nation’s immigration laws . . . . are not designed to be blindly enforced without \n12  consideration given to the individual circumstances of each case”). The agency’s \n13  failure to exercise its individualized discretion is also inconsistent with its own rules, \n14  as described above. Those rules make clear that if someone is the subject of an NTA, \n15  USCIS should consider all of the relevant circumstances, including the ground for \n16  removal charged in the NTA, to determine whether DACA is appropriate or whether \n17  the individual is disqualified. The DACA rules also make clear that when the ground \n18  in the NTA does not adversely impact a DACA grant—including, presumably, when \n19  the ground is one that all or most DACA recipients could be charged with—the \n20  individual is not disqualified from DACA.  \n21    Fourth, and as this Court has held, USCIS’ practice of terminating DACA \n22  automatically based on the filing of an NTA is arbitrary and capricious because it \n23  leaves the question of whether an individual continues to warrant a DACA grant and \n24  EAD solely up to a CBP or ICE officer’s charging decision in issuing an NTA. PI \n25  Order at 10.  In Judulang, the Supreme Court emphasized that an additional reason \n26  why the BIA’s rule was impermissibly arbitrary was that under the rule, whether a \n27  noncitizen would be granted discretionary relief may “rest on the happenstance of an \n28  immigration official’s charging decision.” 565 U.S. at 57. See also id. at 58 \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 18 of 30   Page ID\n #:1501\n1  (recognizing “the high stakes for an alien who has long resided in this country,” and \n2  noting that the Court has “reversed an agency decision that would ‘make his right to \n3  remain here dependent on circumstances so fortuitous and capricious’”) (quoting \n4  Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 391 (1947)). The same is true here: where a \n5  class member’s “DACA [i]s revoked automatically due to the issuance of the NTA, \n6  everything h[angs] on the fortuity of one CBP officer’s decision.” PI Order at 10. \n7  Fifth, in terminating proposed class members’ individual DACA grants and \n8  EADs and finding that the issuance of an NTA automatically renders them ineligible \n9  for DACA, DHS is departing from its prior position without “a reasoned analysis for \n10  the change,” in violation of the APA. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. \n11  Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983). See also PI Order at 10-11; 5 U.S.C. \n12  § 706(2)(A). An agency may depart from its prior decision, but it is black letter law \n13  that if it does so, it “is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change.” State \n14  Farm, 463 U.S. at 42. See also FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, \n15  515 (2009) (“[T]he agency must show that there are good reasons for the new \n16  policy.”). \n17  In these cases, DHS has previously determined that the individual proposed \n18  class member is eligible for and warrants a DACA grant on at least one occasion, and \n19  in many cases on multiple occasions. The agency reached these individual \n20  determinations after evaluating each DACA applicant’s school records and other \n21  circumstances, as well as conducting extensive background checks. PI Order at 10. \n22    In terminating DACA, the agency is abruptly reversing course. The agency does \n23  so even though now, as before, each proposed class member continues to be eligible \n24  for DACA. Nonetheless, USCIS provides class members with a boilerplate one-\n25  sentence statement that his or her DACA and EAD have been “terminated \n26  automatically” because a NTA was issued. See, e.g., Kwon Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 8; Moreira \n27  Decl. ¶ 26, Ex. B; Gil Decl. ¶ 30, Ex. B. As this Court has concluded, USCIS’s one-\n28  sentence explanation fails to provide “good reasons” for the agency’s change in \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 19 of 30   Page ID\n #:1502\n1  position, as required by the APA. PI Order at 10. See also Fox Television Stations, \n2  Inc., 556 U.S. at 515; Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, \n3  968 (9th Cir. 2015) (explaining that the agency is “required to provide a ‘reasoned \n4  explanation . . . for disregarding’ the ‘facts and circumstances’ that underlay its \n5  previous decision”) (citations omitted). As this Court explained, “[g]iven that all \n6  DACA recipients are necessarily removable due to their unauthorized presence, the \n7  agency’s reliance on an NTA citing . . . presence without admission simply fails to \n8  explain, much less justify, an agency’s decision to reverse course and terminate [] \n9  DACA.” PI Order at 10-11 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n10    As this Court has recognized, the agency’s failure to explain its decision is also \n11  invalid because it fails to mention, let alone account for, each proposed class \n12  member’s “substantial reliance interests.” PI Order at 11. Plaintiffs and the proposed \n13  class members have lived in the United States since a young age, and have relied on \n14  DACA to build a life, obtain rewarding employment as young adults, and help support \n15  themselves and their families. See Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 515 \n16  (explaining that an agency must give a “more detailed justification” for a policy \n17  change if its “prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken \n18  into account”). DHS’ failure to provide a reasoned explanation for its change in \n19  position is arbitrary and capricious. See, e.g., Organized Vill. of Kake, 795 F.3d at \n20  967-68 (holding that the defendant agency failed to provide “good reasons” for \n21  reversing its old policy). \n22    For all these reasons, DHS’ practices of changing its position without providing \n23  a reasoned explanation and terminating Plaintiffs’ and class members’ DACA based \n24  merely on an NTA charging unlawful presence is arbitrary and capricious in violation \n25  of the APA. \n \n26 \nB. DHS’ Revocation of Class Members’ DACA and EAD Without Process \n27  Violates the Agency’s Own Procedures and Procedural Due Process. \n \n28 \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 20 of 30   Page ID\n #:1503\n1.  DHS’ Revocation Without Notice Violates Its Own Rules and the \n1 \nAPA. \n2 \nDHS’ automatic termination of proposed class members’ DACA and EAD \n3 \nwithout notice or an opportunity to be heard also violates DHS’ own rules and is \n4 \ntherefore arbitrary and capricious under the APA.   \n5 \nThe DACA SOPs provide that USCIS generally will not terminate a recipient’s \n6 \nDACA and EAD without prior notice and an opportunity to respond. See, e.g., DACA \n7 \nSOPs Chapter 14, Termination, at 136-38 (if DACA granted in error, or granted as a \n8 \nresult of fraud, officer is directed to issue a “Notice of Intent to Terminate,” allow \n9 \nrecipient “33 days to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited in [the \n10 \nnotice],” and terminate only where the adverse grounds are not overcome). See also \n11 \nColotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *7 (“[T]he SOP provides that, in the usual circumstance, \n12 \na termination of an individual’s DACA status will not occur without prior notice to \n13 \nthat individual.”). As this Court has recognized, “unless there are criminal, national \n14 \nsecurity, or public safety concerns, the DACA termination guidelines prescribe the \n15 \nissuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate and require that the individual should be \n16 \nallowed 33 days to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited.” PI Order at \n17 \n11 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although the DACA SOPs contain \n18 \na procedure for termination of DACA if ICE issues an NTA, such termination is \n19 \npermitted only under narrow circumstances involving certain serious public safety \n20 \nconcerns, and only after DHS follows specific procedures. See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 \n21 \nWL 4340385, at *6 (finding that USCIS’ termination of DACA in response to “NTA \n22 \nissued by USCBP in connection with removal proceedings” charging recipient with \n23 \nbeing present without admission did not comply with DACA SOPs); see also DACA \n24 \nSOPs Chapter 14, Termination, at 137 (enumerating procedures to be followed in \n25 \ncases involving disqualifying criminal offenses or public safety concerns).11 \n26                                             \n11   Defendants may attempt to argue that, where a noncitizen otherwise eligible for \n27 \nDACA is an enforcement priority under the Kelly Memorandum, the DACA rules do \n28  not require notice and an opportunity to respond prior to termination. However, the \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 21 of 30   Page ID\n #:1504\n1  In sum, because Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA without process \n2  violates Defendants’ own termination procedures, the practice is arbitrary and \n3  capricious. See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5 (“Defendants’ failure to \n4  follow the termination procedures set forth in the DACA SOP is arbitrary, capricious, \n5  and an abuse of discretion.”); Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 n.6 (“Defendants’ \n6  actions were likely arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA by . . . terminating \n7  her DACA status in contravention of DHS’s own procedures.”). \n2.  DHS’ Practice of Revoking DACA Without Process Violates \n8 \nProcedural Due Process.  \n9 \nIn addition to violating its own procedures, DHS’ practice of revoking DACA \n10 \nwithout providing any process violates proposed class members’ procedural due \n11 \nprocess rights. Plaintiffs and the proposed class members have gained a protected \n12 \ninterest in their DACA, which authorized them to live and work in the United States \n13 \nuntil the expiration date of their DACA grants, and therefore have a right to a fair \n14 \nprocedure before it can be revoked. Yet DHS has reversed these decisions without \n15 \nproviding Plaintiffs and proposed class members with adequate notice, a reasoned \n16 \nexplanation, or an opportunity to present arguments and evidence to demonstrate that \n17 \nthey remain eligible for the program and did not engage in any disqualifying criminal \n18 \nactivity. \n19 \n   The Constitution “imposes constraints on governmental decisions which \n20 \ndeprive individuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests.” Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. \n21 \n                                                                                                                                             \n22  Kelly Memorandum on its face makes clear that the new enforcement priorities do not \naffect the DACA program.  See Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 (holding that “the \n23 \nKelly Memo, by its own terms, has no application to the DACA program”); id. at *7 \n24  (emphasizing that the Kelly Memorandum “specifically excludes” the DACA \nprogram); id. at *8 (noting that DHS’s public guidance is “clear and unambiguous” \n25 \nthat the Kelly Memorandum does not affect the DACA program); Colotl v. Kelly, No. \n26  1:17-cv-01670-MHC (N.D. Ga. July 31, 2017) (Doc. No. 43) (Order Denying \nReconsideration at 7-8).  Moreover, applying the Kelly Memorandum to revoke \n27 \nDACA based on conduct or criminal history that the DACA SOPs and DACA \n28  Memorandum provide is not disqualifying is inconsistent with the program rules. \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 22 of 30   Page ID\n #:1505\n1  319, 332 (1976). Regardless of whether the individual had a claim of entitlement \n2  before it was granted, once an important benefit is conferred, recipients have a \n3  protected property interest sufficient to require a fair process before the government \n4  may take it away. See Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971) (holding that,“[o]nce \n5  [driver’s] licenses are issued, . . . their continued possession may become essential in \n6  the pursuit of a livelihood,” such that they cannot “be taken away without” due \n7  process); Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972) (holding that parole \n8  revocation requires due process; parolees may “have been on parole for a number of \n9  years and may be living a relatively normal life[,]” all the while “[having] relied on at \n10  least an implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if [the parolee] fails to live \n11  up to the parole conditions”); Nnebe v. Daus, 644 F.3d 147, 158-69 (2d Cir. 2011) \n12  (recognizing that taxi drivers have a protected property interest in the continued \n13  possession of their operating licenses and remanding to determine if suspension \n14  hearing satisfied due process); Singh v. Bardini, No. 09-cv-3382, 2010 WL 308807, at \n15  *7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2010) (“Even if there is no constitutional right to be granted \n16  asylum, that does not mean that, once granted, asylum status can be taken away \n17  without any due process protections.”) (internal citation omitted). \n18  Plaintiffs and the proposed class members’ DACA and EADs are essential to \n19  their ability to remain lawfully present in the United States and earn a livelihood to \n20  support themselves and their families. See Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Long Beach, 951 \n21  F.2d 977, 986 (9th Cir. 1991) (finding ordinance permitting airport to automatically \n22  reduce flights already allocated to air carriers by license violated air carriers’ due \n23  process rights where allocations were crucial to enterprise); Jones v. City of Modesto, \n24  408 F. Supp. 2d 935, 951 (E.D. Cal. 2005) (finding that city could not revoke existing \n25  massage license without due process) (citing Greenwood v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 28 \n26  F.3d 971, 975 (9th Cir. 1994) (“The Ninth Circuit specifically recognized that an \n27  existing license, in contrast to an applied for license, constitutes a legitimate \n28  entitlement of which one cannot be deprived without due process.”)). Plaintiffs and \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 23 of 30   Page ID\n #:1506\n1  the proposed class members have reasonably relied on the implicit promise that they \n2  could retain their DACA grants and EADs so long as they satisfied the program’s \n3  eligibility requirements. See Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 482. The government’s reversal of \n4  its previous decision that they were eligible for and warranted DACA inflicts precisely \n5  the kind of “serious loss” that requires due process protections. Mathews, 424 U.S. at \n6  348 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n7  Determining the procedure necessary to meet constitutional standards requires \n8  evaluation of three distinct factors:  \n \n9 \nFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; \nsecond, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the \n10 \nprocedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or \nsubstitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, \n11 \nincluding the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens \nthat the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.   \n12 \nId. at 335.  \n13 \n14 \nEvaluation of these factors demonstrates that Plaintiffs and the proposed class \n15 \nmembers must be afforded at least the pre-termination process that DHS generally \n16 \nprovides for under its own rules—i.e., adequate notice of the allegedly adverse \n17 \ngrounds and an opportunity to respond and contest the decision. The private interest at \n18 \nstake could not be more significant. The termination of DACA rescinds proposed \n19 \nPlaintiffs and class members’ authorization to live and work in the United States—the \n20 \ncountry they have called home from a young age. Instead of following its own \n21 \nprescribed process, DHS’s practice is to terminate proposed class members’ DACA \n22 \nwithout notice. The lack of any opportunity to contest the termination decision creates \n23 \nan unacceptably high risk of erroneous deprivation. See Singh v. Vasquez, No. 08-cv-\n24 \n1901, 2009 WL 3219266, at *5 (D. Ariz. Sept. 30, 2009), aff’d, 448 F. App’x 776 (9th \n25 \nCir. Aug. 31, 2011) (“[T]here is a substantial risk of erroneous deprivation through the \n26 \nprocedures utilized by INS in rescinding asylum via a mailed letter. This manner of \n27 \ntermination does not account for anything other than post hoc notice that . . . he or she \n28 \nis no longer entitled to protection.”). Providing Plaintiffs and proposed class members \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 24 of 30   Page ID\n #:1507\n1  with a reasoned explanation for the government’s actions and an opportunity to \n2  present arguments and evidence could make all the difference, because it will allow \n3  proposed class members to demonstrate that they have not engaged in any \n4  disqualifying criminal activity (or even been charged with any crime) and remain \n5  eligible for DACA. Indeed, Mr. Arreola’s circumstances highlight the value of the “an \n6  opportunity to contest the [termination] determination at a meaningful time,” as he \n7  would have been able to show that CBP’s allegations had been mistaken, as the \n8  immigration judge had concluded. See Villa-Anguiano v. Holder, 727 F.3d 873, 882 \n9  (9th Cir. 2013). See also id.at 881 (holding that BIA “must consider all favorable and \n10  unfavorable factors relevant to the exercise of its discretion; failure to do so \n11  constitutes an abuse of discretion”). And both Mr. Gil and Mr. Moreira could \n12  demonstrate that the minor offenses that they have been charged with do not \n13  disqualify them from DACA, and that they have deep family ties, strong work \n14  histories, and other positive equities favoring continuation of DACA in the totality of \n15  the circumstances. See Gil Decl. ¶¶ 1-6, 11-14; Moreira Decl. ¶¶ 1-6, 9-14, 21. The \n16  fact that DHS’ rules already provide for these basic pre-deprivation protections in \n17  most circumstances reinforces both that the value of such safeguards is high, and that \n18  providing such limited process would not place undue fiscal or administrative burdens \n19  on the government. Vasquez, 2009 WL 3219266, at *6 (“To conclude, all of the \n20  Mathews factors weigh in favor of a finding that due process requires more than \n21  sending an after the fact letter of rescission when the government terminates a grant of \n22  asylum.”).  \n23  II.  THE PLAINTIFF CLASS IS SUFFERING IRREPARABLE HARM. \n24  Absent an injunction, Plaintiffs and the proposed class will continue to \n25  experience irreparable harm that cannot be cured by their ultimate success on the \n26  merits in this case. \n27  There is no question that revocation of proposed class members’ DACA and \n28  loss of their EADs has derailed their careers and undermined their employment. \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 25 of 30   Page ID\n #:1508\n1  Indeed, a recent survey concluded that, like Plaintiffs, 91 percent of DACA recipients \n2  were employed, including at top Fortune 500 companies such as Walmart, Apple, \n3  General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Home Depot, and Wells Fargo. Sixty-\n4  nine percent of DACA recipients reported that their earnings “helped [them] become \n5  financially independent.”12  Stripping DACA recipients of their DACA and EADs \n6  directly results in loss of employment and earnings, as well as lost opportunities to \n7  gain education and experience: 94% of DACA recipients have “pursued educational \n8  opportunities that [they] previously could not” because of DACA.13 As this Court has \n9  held, “the deprivation of Plaintiff’s earnings and job opportunities caused by the loss \n10  of his DACA and EAD constitutes irreparable harm.”  See PI Order at 13-14. \n11  Consistent with this Court’s holding, the Ninth Circuit has made clear that the “loss of \n12  opportunity to pursue [one’s] chosen profession” constitutes irreparable harm. Enyart \n13  v. Nat’l Conference of Bar Exam’rs, Inc., 630 F.3d 1153, 1165 (9th Cir. 2011); see \n14  also Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 543 (1985) (“We have \n15  frequently recognized the severity of depriving a person of the means of livelihood.”). \n16  The harms faced by Plaintiffs illustrate the adverse effects on proposed class members \n17  of losing one’s DACA and EAD. For example, because he lost his EAD, Mr. Arreola \n18  had to leave his job as a cook at Chateau Marmont, and because CBP took possession \n19  of his car, he has been unable to work as a driver. Arreola Decl. ¶ 40. See also, e.g., \n20  Gil Decl. ¶ 24. The classwide effects are similar.14 \n                                           \n21 \n12   See Eiland Decl. ¶ 31, Ex. 16 at 3, 4 (Tom K.

In Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir. 2014), for \n3  example, the Ninth Circuit reversed a district court’s denial of a preliminary \n4  injunction on harm grounds, and held that the DACA recipients had established \n5  irreparable harm because the defendants’ policy had “diminished [plaintiffs’] \n6  opportunity to pursue their chosen professions.” Id. at 1068. See also PI Order at 13-\n7  14; Enyart, 630 F.3d at 1165; Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *6 (finding that \n8  irreparable harm caused by defendants’ termination of DACA without notice \n9  “includes the loss of employment, a core benefit under DACA” and that such \n10  “deprivation of employment impacts Plaintiff’s ability to financially provide for \n11  himself and his family”). Moreover, setbacks at an early stage in proposed class \n12  members’ careers may never be recoverable. Time without DACA is “productive time \n13  irretrievably lost” that the proposed class members could be spending in their chosen \n14  career paths, building toward the future for themselves and their families. Chalk v. \n15  United States Dist. Court, 840 F.2d 701, 710 (9th Cir. 1988). See also Arizona Dream \n16  Act Coal., 757 F.3d at 1068 (“The irreparable nature of Plaintiffs’ injury is heightened \n17  by Plaintiffs’ young age and fragile socioeconomic position. Setbacks early in their \n18  careers are likely to haunt Plaintiffs for the rest of their lives.”).   \n19  In addition, losing DACA has rendered many proposed class members’ \n20  ineligible for driver’s licenses, which in the vast majority of states are conditioned on \n21  showing lawful presence in the United States.15 Indeed, 90 percent of DACA \n22  recipients obtained driver’s licenses or state identification card for the first time after \n23  receiving DACA.16 Without driver’s licenses, proposed class members are unable to \n24                                             \n15   See Eiland Decl. ¶ 32, Ex. 17 at 2 (Nat’l Immigration Law Center, Access to \n25 \nDriver’s Licenses for Immigrant Youth Granted DACA, May 31, 2015, \n26  https://www.nilc.org/issues/drivers-licenses/daca-and-drivers-licenses/). \n16   See Eiland Decl. ¶ 42, Ex. 27 at 4 (Tom K.

See, e.g., Arreola Decl. ¶ 40; Gil Decl. ¶ 26 (loss of \n5  DACA has left plaintiff feeling “depressed” and “hopeless and stressed”); Moreira \n6  Decl. ¶ 20, 22 (describing fear and depression resulting from uncertainty following the \n7  loss of DACA). These harms are common to the class. Numerous studies have shown \n8  that both DACA recipients themselves and their family members—especially their \n9  children—suffer psychological harm from the fear and uncertainty that accompany the \n10  loss of benefits.17 Thus even if the proposed class members could later recover their \n11  lost income, their emotional distress in the interim constitutes an irreparable injury in \n12  itself. See Chalk, 840 F.2d at 709. See also Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 \n13  (“Plaintiff’s emotional distress . . . is another factor in determining that Plaintiff will \n14  suffer irreparable injury without the entry of a preliminary injunction.”).18 \n                                                                                                                                             \n15 \nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2016/10/18/146290/new-\n16  study-of-daca-beneficiaries-shows-positive-economic-and-educational-outcomes/) \n17   See, e.g., Eiland Decl. ¶ 40, Ex. 25 at 3 (Anna Maria Barry-Jester, The End of \n17 \nDACA Will Ripple Through Families and Communities, FiveThirtyEight, Sept. 6, \n18  2017, https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-end-of-daca-will-ripple-through-\nfamilies-and-communities/) (describing, inter alia, anxiety suffered by children of \n19 \nundocumented parents); Eiland Decl. ¶ 41, Ex. 26 at 1 (Dinah Wiley, New Study \n20  Findings on Mixed-Status Immigrant Families: Threat of Family Separation Affects \nHealth of the Children, Georgetown University Health Policy Institute Center for \n21 \nChildren and Families, June 13, 2013, https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2013/06/13/new-\n22  study-findings-on-mixed-status-immigrant-families-threat-of-family-separation-\naffects-health-of-the-children/) (describing, inter alia, anxiety suffered by children of \n23 \nundocumented parents); Declaration of Jens Hainmueller and Duncan Lawrence \n24  (describing declarants’ research, published in Science, demonstrating that mothers’ \neligibility for DACA improves the mental health of their children). \n25 \n18   See Eiland Decl. ¶ 33, Ex. 18 (Tiziana Rinaldi, DACA recipients saw their \n26  mental health improve.

THE REMAINING FACTORS SUPPORT PRELIMINARY RELIEF.\n2  Preliminary relief will not harm the government. The government will not be\n3  adversely affected by enjoining the revocation of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ \n4  DACA, since the proposed class includes only individuals who remain eligible for the \n5  program. \n6  By contrast, the public interest strongly favors a preliminary injunction. The \n7  public interest is served when the government complies with its obligations under the \n8  APA and the Constitution and follows its own procedures. As the Ninth Circuit has \n9  emphasized, “[I]t is clear that it would not be equitable or in the public’s interest to \n10  allow the state . . . to violate the requirements of federal law, especially when there are \n11  no adequate remedies available.” Arizona Dream Act Coal., 757 F.3d at 1069 (citation \n12  and internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration and ellipsis in original). See also \n13  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[I]t is always in the public \n14  interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.”) (citation and \n15  internal quotation marks omitted); Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 (“[T]he public \n16  has an interest in government agencies being required to comply with their own \n17  written guidelines instead of engaging in arbitrary decision making.”).  \n18  Further, stripping class members of their professions and authorization to work \n19  is not in the public interest. The vast majority (71%) of DACA recipients have been \n20  able to help their families financially through their earnings; 19 job loss means that \n21  many DACA recipient’s families would lose a crucial support, and many of those \n22  family members are U.S. citizens—78% of DACA recipients have an American \n23  citizen spouse, sibling, or child.20 For example, Mr. Arreola’s family relies on him \n24  heavily.

Upon due consideration, the Court \n4  hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Classwide Preliminary Injunction. \n5  Defendants and their agents, employees, assigns, and all those acting in concert with \n6  them are enjoined as follows: \n7  1. It is hereby ORDERED that Defendants are preliminarily enjoined from\n8  terminating grants of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) and related \n9  employment authorization documents (“EADs”) of class members absent a fair \n10  procedure that complies with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) DACA \n11  Standard Operating Procedures as well as the Memorandum from Janet Napolitano, \n12  Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the \n13  United States as Children (June 15, 2012), available at \n14  https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-\n15  individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf, and which includes, at a minimum, \n16  notice, a reasoned explanation, and an opportunity to be heard prior to termination.  \n17  2. It is hereby ORDERED that Defendants are preliminarily enjoined from\n18  terminating grants of DACA and related EADs based solely on the issuance of a \n19  Notice to Appear (“NTA”) that charges the DACA recipient as removable due to his \n20  or her presence in the United States without admission or having overstayed a visa. \n21  3. It is hereby ORDERED that Defendants’ decisions after January 19, 2017 to\n22  terminate the DACA grants and EADs of class members, without notice, a reasoned \n23  explanation, or an opportunity to respond prior to termination, are preliminarily \n24  enjoined. Defendants immediately will restore those individuals’ DACA and EADs, \n25  subject to their original date of expiration.  \n26  4. It is hereby ORDERED that Defendants accept and adjudicate any applications\n27  to renew DACA by individuals whose DACA grant and EAD would have expired on \n28  or before March 5, 2018, but were unable to apply for or obtain a renewal as a result \n1 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-2   Filed 12/29/17   Page 4 of 5   Page ID #:1517\n1  of Defendants’ unlawful revocation decision, consistent with the terms of this Order. \n2  Implementation Procedures \n3  5. Within seven days of this Order, the parties will meet and confer to develop a\n4  notice that explains the requirements of this Order and provides class members with \n5  contact information for Class Counsel. Within 14 days of this Order, Defendants will \n6  send the notice to all individuals whose DACA grant and EAD was revoked after \n7  January 19, 2017 without advance issuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate \n8  (“NOIT”) and provide copies of those notices to Class Counsel. \n9  Within 14 days of this Order: \n10  6. Defendants shall identify all DACA recipients whose DACA grant and EAD\n11  was revoked after January 19, 2017 without issuance of a NOIT and determine if they \n12  have been convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense. If the individual has not been \n13  convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense, Defendants immediately will restore the \n14  individual’s DACA grant and issue the individual a new EAD.  \n15  7. If the individual’s restored DACA grant and EAD have expired as of the date of\n16  this Order or will expire on or before March 5, 2018, Defendants will permit the \n17  individual 60 days from the date of this Order to submit a DACA renewal application \n18  to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If the individual’s restored DACA \n19  grant and EAD expired on or before the date of this Order, Defendants temporarily \n20  will restore that individual’s DACA grant and EAD for the 60-day period to submit a \n21  renewal application. \n22  8. Defendants shall provide Class Counsel with a list of all DACA recipients\n23  whose DACA grant and EAD was revoked after January 19, 2017 without issuance of \n24  a NOIT. That list shall include the following information for each person: \n25  • Name, Alien Number, Mailing Address, and Phone Number;\n26  • The date the individual’s most recent DACA grant and EAD was granted;\n27  • The date the individual’s most recent DACA grant and EAD was set to expire;\n28  • The date the individual’s most recent DACA grant and EAD was revoked;\n2 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-2   Filed 12/29/17   Page 5 of 5   Page ID #:1518\n1  • Whether the individual was found to have a disqualifying criminal conviction\n2  and, if so, what conviction(s);\n3  • If applicable, the date the individual’s DACA grant and EAD was restored.\n4  For each such person, Defendants also will provide Class Counsel with copies of the \n5  Notices of Action previously terminating the person’s DACA grant and EAD, as well \n6  as the Notices of Action and EADs for individuals whose DACA grants and EADs are \n7  restored pursuant to this Order, including those DACA grants and EADs that are \n8  temporarily restored pursuant to paragraph 7. \n9 \n10  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n11 \n12  DATED: ___________, 2018  ____________________________________ \nTHE HONORABLE PHILIP S.

Jens Hainmueller is a Professor of Political Science and Faculty Co-\n2 \ndirector of the Immigration Policy Lab (“IPL”) at Stanford University, Stanford, \n3 \nCalifornia. Duncan Lawrence is the Executive Director of  IPL. We write this \n4 \ndeclaration in our personal capacity as experts in support of Plaintiffs.  \n5 \na. Jens Hainmueller is a Professor of Political Science at Stanford\n6 \nUniversity and is the Co-founder and Faculty Co-director of\n7 \nIPL. Mr. Hainmueller received his PhD from Harvard University\n8 \nand also studied at the London School of Economics, Brown\n9 \nUniversity, and the University of Tübingen. Before joining\n10 \nStanford, he served on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of\n11 \nTechnology.  He has published more than 40 articles in peer-\n12 \nreviewed journals. A copy of his curriculum vitae is attached\n13 \n(Exhibit A).\n14 \nb. Duncan Lawrence is the Executive Director of IPL. Mr. Lawrence\n15 \nreceived his PhD in political science from the University of\n16 \nColorado Boulder, and has published several peer-reviewed articles\n17 \non immigration.  A copy of his curriculum vitae is attached (Exhibit\n18 \nB).\n19 \n2. In 2017, we (along with other colleagues) co-authored a peer-reviewed\n20 \nstudy about the intergenerational effects of parental immigration status on children’s \n21 \nhealth.  This study was published in Science, and a copy is attached to this declaration \n22 \n(Exhibit C). \n23 \n3. Our study focused on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)\n24 \nprogram, which is one of the most extensive policies directed toward unauthorized \n25 \nimmigrants in recent decades. It builds on prior studies that have found that DACA is \n26 \nrelated to higher rates of employment and improved health outcomes.  \n27 \n28 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-3   Filed 12/29/17   Page 4 of 8   Page ID #:1522\n4. Our study used data from Emergency Medicaid, a government program\n1 \nthat provides coverage for emergencies and labor and delivery services for low-\n2 \nincome individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid.  The program serves \n3 \nunauthorized immigrants and lawful permanent residents with less than 5 years of \n4 \nresidency.  Estimates from states such as California indicate that 90 to 99% of \n5 \nEmergency Medicaid recipients are unauthorized immigrants.  In addition, because \n6 \nU.S.-born children of unauthorized immigrants are U.S. citizens, they are eligible for \n7 \nfull-scope Medicaid benefits (if meeting all requirements) and can be tracked with \n8 \nMedicaid claims data.  We limited our sample to children whose mothers were under \n9 \nage 31 as of June 15, 2012—a date tied to the DACA eligibility criterion announced \n10 \nwhen DACA was adopted on June 15, 2012.  Our data did not reflect whether \n11 \nmothers apply for DACA, but given that mothers who were born just before or after \n12 \nthe DACA birthdate cutoff are similar in confounding characteristics, we can isolate \n13 \nthe intention-to-treat effect of DACA eligibility on the health of their children. \n14 \n5. Using this sampling criteria, we used Medicaid claims data from Oregon to\n15 \nidentify 5,653 mothers born between 1980 and 1982 who were covered by \n16 \nEmergency Medicaid and gave birth to 8,610 children between 2003 and 2015.  We \n17 \nthen tracked the children’s mental health outcomes by using their Medicaid claims.  \n18 \nThe children in our sample were born in Oregon and are therefore U.S. citizens by \n19 \nbirth; 49% are female, 73% are Hispanic, and they were between 0 and 12 years old \n20 \nin 2015. \n21 \n6. Although parental DACA eligibility could affect a broad range of child\n22 \nhealth outcomes, we focused on the impacts on children’s mental health.  Because \n23 \nDACA offered the mothers immediate relief from the risk of deportation, maternal \n24 \nstress might have declined, and their children would no longer have had to fear being \n25 \nseparated from them.  Therefore, the children’s mental well-being could have \n26 \nimproved.  Moreover, examining mental health disorders that originate in childhood \n27 \nis important because they are associated with long-term health issues, low education, \n28 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-3   Filed 12/29/17   Page 5 of 8   Page ID #:1523\nand welfare dependence, which generate considerable private and social costs.  Our \n1 \nmain child outcome is a broad measure of any diagnoses of adjustment disorder, \n2 \nacute stress disorder, or anxiety disorder, measured using all diagnoses in the \n3 \nInternational Classification of Diseases 9 (ICD-9) categories 309, 308, and 300: \n4 \na.  Adjustment disorder is a reaction to an identified stressor, leading to \n5 \nan inability to function normally.  It is diagnosed on the basis of \n6 \nsymptoms of anxiety, depressed mood, and conduct disturbances and \n7 \noften results in considerable impairment in important areas of \n8 \nfunctioning, such as social activities, school performance, and sleep. \n9 \nb.  Acute stress disorder can be a precursor to a diagnosis of a more \n10 \nlasting posttraumatic stress disorder (included in the ICD-9 category \n11 \n309, adjustment disorder).  It is characterized by symptoms or \n12 \nbehaviors similar to those that arise from exposure to a traumatic or \n13 \nstressful event, but acute stress disorders cannot (by definition) last \n14 \nlonger than 1 month.  \n15 \nc.  Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive fear, anxiety, and \n16 \nrelated behavioral disturbances that can lead to substantial distress or \n17 \nimpairment.  An external stressor might not be clearly identified, and \n18 \nanxiety disorders can be caused by environmental, genetic, or \n19 \nphysiological factors. \n20 \nThese mental health disorders in childhood are associated with considerable \n21 \ndevelopmental, psychosocial, and psycho-pathological complications for children and \n22 \ntheir families. \n23 \n7.  We found that mothers’ eligibility for DACA protection led to a significant \n24 \nimprovement in their children’s mental health.  Specifically, Mothers’ DACA \n25 \neligibility reduced adjustment and anxiety disorder diagnoses in their children by 4.3 \n26 \npercentage points (P = 0.023) from a baseline rate of 7.9% among children of \n27 \nineligible mothers at the threshold.  This reduction represents more than a 50% drop \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-3   Filed 12/29/17   Page 6 of 8   Page ID #:1524\nin the rate of these disorders (albeit with a wide 95% confidence interval (CI) for the \n1 \nmagnitude of the estimated effect) and provides evidence that mothers’ DACA \n2 \neligibility sharply improved their children’s mental health.  \n3 \n8.  The causal link between parental DACA eligibility and positive child \n4 \nmental health outcomes is based on the idea that the DACA birthdate cutoff is an \n5 \narbitrary date, and, therefore, children of ineligible mothers born just before the \n6 \nbirthdate cutoff should be similar in all respects, including in possible confounding \n7 \ncharacteristics, to children of DACA-eligible mothers born just after the cutoff.  We \n8 \ncorroborated this continuity assumption by testing for differences in the prevalence of \n9 \ndisorder diagnoses in the children during a similar time period pre-DACA (2003 to \n10 \nquarter 2, 2012) and at the cutoff date. We confirmed that there were no discernible \n11 \ndifference in the prevalence of disorder diagnoses at the same cutoff date for the pre-\n12 \nDACA period. The difference in diagnosis rates at the cutoff was a statistically \n13 \ninsignificant 0.4 percentage points.  All our tests suggested that we can isolate the \n14 \ncausal effects of mothers’ DACA eligibility at the birthdate cutoff. \n15 \n9.  We also confirmed that there were no discernible differences in diagnoses \n16 \nat the same birthdate cutoff among children of mothers who were covered by \n17 \nstandard Medicaid at the time they gave birth.  These mothers should not be affected \n18 \nby DACA eligibility, given that standard Medicaid in Oregon is open only to low-\n19 \nincome U.S. citizens and long-term lawful permanent residents.  This check again \n20 \nunderscores that, in the absence of changes in DACA eligibility, there is no evidence \n21 \nof confounders associated with having a mother who is born just before or after the \n22 \ncutoff date that could explain the observed post-DACA difference in child mental \n23 \nhealth outcomes. \n24 \n10. Because health care utilization could be affected by immigration status, we \n25 \nalso checked for the possibility that the drop in diagnoses reflects a DACA-induced \n26 \nchange in health care visits, which could affect the probability of detection of mental \n27 \nhealth disorders.  We found no support for this.  Mothers’ DACA eligibility had no \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-3   Filed 12/29/17   Page 7 of 8   Page ID #:1525\ndiscernible impact on their children’s health care utilization during the post-DACA \n1 \nperiod, as measured either by the total number of visits, the number of emergency \n2 \nroom (ER) and urgent care visits, or the number of outpatient visits.  Consistent with \n3 \nthis, in a non-prespecified analysis, we also found that the effects of mothers’ DACA \n4 \neligibility on child mental health were similar when we restricted the sample to \n5 \nchildren who had at least one health care visit in the post-DACA period. \n6 \n11. Our results provide causal evidence supporting the theory that parental\n7 \nunauthorized immigration status has important intergenerational effects on the well-\n8 \nbeing and development of children in immigrant families.  Protecting unauthorized \n9 \nimmigrants from deportation led to immediate and sizable improvements in the \n10 \nmental health of their U.S. citizen children.  This suggests that parents’ unauthorized \n11 \nstatus is a substantial stressor that stymies normal child development and perpetuates \n12 \nhealth inequalities by transferring parental disadvantages to children. \n13 \n12. Our findings have important implications for DACA policy.  Prior research\n14 \nhas suggested that early childhood exposure to stress and adversity does not only \n15 \ncause poor health and impaired development in the short term; the issues can also \n16 \npersist into adulthood.  Anxiety and psychosocial stress have been identified as risk \n17 \nfactors for depression, substance abuse, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity.  \n18 \nTreatment of mental disorders also carries considerable economic costs. Prior \n19 \nresearch indicates that they account for the highest total health care expenditures of \n20 \nall children’s medical conditions and that they are associated with poor long-term \n21 \noutcomes for school performance and welfare reliance.  By reducing mental health \n22 \nproblems, deferred action can therefore have important multiplier effects through \n23 \nimproving the future prospects of the children of unauthorized immigrants. \n24 \n13. Conversely, the termination of recipients’ DACA is likely to erode the\n25 \nmental health gains we measured and lead to corresponding economic and public \n26 \nhealth costs in both the short-term and long term.  \n27 \n28 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 40-3   Filed 12/29/17   Page 8 of 8   Page ID #:1526\nWe declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the \n1 \nforegoing is true and correct and that this declaration was executed on December 20, \n2 \n2017 in Stanford, California. \n3 \n4 \n5  ___________________________ \nJENS HAINMUELLER \n6 \n7 \n___________________________ \n8  DUNCAN LAWRENCE \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 ",

USCIS \n9  has abruptly revoked these young immigrants’ valid DACA and work authorization \n10  even though they remain eligible for the program.  Losing the protection of DACA \n11  and, with it, the ability to work and plan for the future, is devastating to these young \n12  immigrants who have called the United States home since they were children.   \n13  Mr. Gil is a 24-year-old who has lived in the United States for more than 19 \n14  years.  USCIS found him eligible for and granted him DACA in both 2015 and 2017.  \n15  His DACA allowed him to work as a bakery manager and for a logistics company, and \n16  he used his earnings to help support his five younger U.S. citizen siblings.  Mr. Gil \n17  was also able to get a driver’s license, which allowed him to drive to work and church, \n18  and to give his siblings rides to school.  However, USCIS suddenly revoked Mr. Gil’s \n19  DACA and work authorization in November 2017—just three months after USCIS \n20  renewed it—without providing him with a reasoned explanation or a process to \n21  challenge the revocation.   \n22  Mr. Moreira is also 24 years old and has lived in the United States since he was \n23  a child.  In high school, Mr. Moreira was active in school sports and other activities \n24  and received various certificates of achievement for his academic performance.  After \n25  Mr. Moreira graduated, USCIS granted him DACA, which allowed him to secure a \n26  good job with a flooring company, where he excelled and was quickly promoted from \n27  an assistant manager to a manager position.  USCIS granted Mr. Moreira DACA twice \n28 \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 8 of 29   Page ID\n #:1175\n1  more—most recently in November 2017—just days before USCIS abruptly \n2  terminated it.1  \n3  Plaintiffs are not alone.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ counsel are aware of at least 17 \n4  DACA recipients across the country who have had their DACA and work permits \n5  terminated without notice or process since January 2017, even though they still \n6  qualify for the program.  Declaration of Katrina L. Eiland (“Eiland Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-14.  \n7  Hundreds of thousands more DACA recipients nationwide are at risk of having their \n8  DACA terminated pursuant to Defendants’ unlawful policies and practices.  Id. ¶ 48, \n9  Ex. 33.  \n10  Indeed, Defendants have conceded in this lawsuit that USCIS engages in a \n11  practice of terminating DACA without notice or an opportunity to respond, including \n12  by automatically terminating DACA based on the issuance of a Notice to Appear \n13  (“NTA”) in immigration court, without regard to whether the recipient remains \n14  eligible for the program.  See Doc No. 23-2, Declaration of Ron Thomas (“Thomas \n15  Decl.”) ¶ 4.  Defendants also have conceded that this practice is widespread.  In fact, \n16  Defendants have represented that the number of individuals subjected to its practice is \n17  such that identifying “all automatic terminations of DACA would . . . involve a \n18  manual review of hundreds of cases.”  Id. ¶ 5 (emphasis added).   \n19  However, as this Court and others have ruled, USCIS’s admitted practice of \n20  terminating DACA without notice or process violates the agency’s own rules and is, \n21  therefore, arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law under the Administrative \n22  Procedure Act (“APA”).  As described in Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Classwide \n23  Preliminary Injunction, filed this same date, Defendants’ termination practice is also \n24  arbitrary and capricious because it fails to provide good reasons for changing course \n25  with respect to the agency’s determination that the individual merits DACA, and is \n26  based on arbitrary, irrelevant factors.  Terminating DACA without notice and an \n27  1 The termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA is described in detail in Plaintiff \nArreola’s Memorandum of Law in Support of his Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.  \n28  See Doc.

Plaintiffs seek to certify the following nationwide Notice Class under \n5  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2): \n6  All recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) \n7  who, after January 19, 2017, have had or will have their DACA grant \n8  and employment authorization revoked without notice or an \n9  opportunity to respond, even though they have not been convicted of a \n10  disqualifying criminal offense.2 \n11  The proposed class readily satisfies the requirements of numerosity, \n12  commonality, typicality, and adequacy in Rule 23(a) and is readily ascertainable.  The \n13  proposed class includes at least 17 and likely many more individuals whose DACA \n14  already has been unlawfully terminated, which is sufficient to satisfy numerosity.  See, \n15  e.g., Ark. Educ. Ass’n v. Board Of Educ. of Portland, Ark. Sch. Dist., 446 F.2d 763, \n16  765-66 (8th Cir. 1971) (class of 17 sufficient); Hum v. Dericks, 162 F.R.D. 628, 634 \n17  (D. Haw. 1995) (noting that courts have certified classes with as few as 13 members).  \n18  The class raises numerous common legal questions that generate common answers: \n19  namely, whether Defendants’ challenged policies and practices violate the APA and \n20  the Due Process Clause.  The class also raises common factual issues because \n21  Plaintiffs and class members are subject to the same policies and practices.  Plaintiffs’ \n22  APA and Due Process Clause claims are typical of those whom they seek to \n23  represent—that is, other DACA recipients who have or will have their DACA and \n24  work authorization terminated without notice or process pursuant to Defendants’ \n25  unlawful policies and practices, despite having no disqualifying convictions.  And as \n26  to adequacy, a team of seasoned attorneys from the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project \n27                                             \n2 This motion does not address the proposed “Enforcement Priority” Class pled in \n28  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, filed this same date.  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 10 of 29   Page ID\n #:1177\n1  and the ACLU of Southern California, with significant experience in immigrants’ \n2  rights and class action cases, represents Plaintiffs. \n3  Plaintiffs’ proposed class likewise satisfies Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendants \n4  have “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \n5  injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class \n6  as a whole.”  Because the government has a policy or practice of terminating DACA \n7  without notice, process, or a reasoned explanation, including based solely on the \n8  issuance of an NTA, even where a DACA recipient has never engaged in any \n9  disqualifying conduct, Defendants have necessarily acted in the same way as to all \n10  class members.  Injunctive and declaratory relief to stop Defendants’ unlawful \n11  practices is therefore appropriate with respect to the class as a whole.   \n12  Accordingly, this Court should grant class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) for \n13  purposes of entering Plaintiffs’ requested classwide preliminary injunction.3  See \n14  Carrillo v. Schneider Logistics, Inc., No. 11-cv-8557CAS-DTBX, 2012 WL 556309, \n15  at *9 (C.D. Cal.

Defendants’ have engaged in this \n9  practice despite the fact that USCIS’s own SOPs governing the DACA program do \n10  not allow for termination without notice in the vast majority of cases, including in \n11  Plaintiffs’ and the proposed class members.  See, e.g., Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL \n12  4340385, at *3 (“In short, except in EPS cases [i.e., certain cases involving an \n13  egregious risk to public safety], the DACA SOP requires notice and an ability to \n14  contest the [Notice of Intent to Terminate] before DACA status may be terminated.”). \n15  Second, USCIS has a practice of automatically terminating DACA and work \n16  permits based on the issuance of an NTA where the sole basis for the NTA is the \n17  individual’s lack of immigration status in the United States.  Defendants themselves \n18  have asserted in this litigation that USCIS has a “consistent practice” of automatically \n19  terminating DACA “with the issuance of NTAs.”  Doc No. 23, Defs.’ Opp. to PI at \n20  26; see also Thomas Decl. ¶ 4 (“The issuance of a Notice to Appear (NTA) by U.S. \n21  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n22  (CBP) automatically terminates DACA. . . . This has been USCIS’ practice since FY \n23  2013 when such terminations began.”).  As this Court has observed, however, all \n24  DACA recipients could be charged with unlawful presence, and DACA is available to \n25  noncitizens who are in removal proceedings.  PI Order at 9.   \n26  Plaintiffs and Proposed Class Members  \n27  The termination of Plaintiffs’ DACA and work authorization illustrates \n28  Defendants’ unlawful policies and practices.

Declaration of José Eduardo Gil Robles (“Gil Decl.”) ¶¶ 1-2, \n4  11-12.  Mr. Gil was arrested in September 2017 and ultimately charged with a \n5  misdemeanor for driving on a cancelled license, which is still pending.7  Id. ¶ 14.  Mr. \n6  Gil was not aware of any problem with his driver’s license, which was allegedly \n7  cancelled because it required a “status check” when his previous grant of DACA \n8  expired a few weeks before.  Id.  Mr. Gil was released on bond and went back to his \n9  work and family.  Id. ¶ 15.  However, a month later, ICE appeared at his job, arrested \n10  him, and took him to an immigration detention facility.  Id.  ICE subsequently issued \n11  him an NTA charging him with being present without admission.  Id.  Mr. Gil was \n12  released on bond after an immigration judge found that he was not a danger to the \n13  community or a flight risk.  Id. ¶¶ 18-20.  However, while he was in detention, Mr. Gil \n14  received a notice from USCIS terminating his renewed DACA based on ICE’s \n15  issuance of an NTA.  Id. ¶¶ 22-23, 30, Ex. B.  He received no notice or explanation \n16  beyond the single sentence in the notice, and he had no chance to respond.

During middle school and high school, \n21  Mr. Moreira played soccer and tennis, participated in school clubs, and earned \n22  certificates of achievement for his academic performance and attendance.

Id. ¶¶ 2, 9.  On November 2, 2017, Mr. Moreira was arrested after \n26  a police officer concluded that the expiration date on his license had been changed.  \n27 \n7 Such traffic violations do not even count as a misdemeanor that could disqualify an \n28  individual from DACA.  See Kwon Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. 19 at 20.\n7 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 14 of 29   Page ID\n #:1181\n1  He was ultimately charged with a misdemeanor for possession of an altered \n2  identification document, but has not been convicted.  Id. ¶¶ 12-14.  Although Mr. \n3  Moreira was quickly granted bail, ICE detained him and issued him an NTA charging \n4  him with overstaying a visa.  Id. ¶ 14.  Mr. Moreira was released from immigration \n5  detention after about a month.  When he appeared for a bond hearing, the lawyer for \n6  the government conceded that he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the \n7  community, and offered him a bond, which he accepted.  Id. ¶ 16.  However, like Mr. \n8  Gil, Mr. Moreira received a notice from USCIS terminating his DACA based on \n9  ICE’s issuance of an NTA.  Id. ¶¶ 18, 26, Ex. B.  Mr. Moreira also did not receive any \n10  notice or explanation beyond the single sentence in the notice, and he had no chance \n11  to respond.  Id. ¶ 19. \n12  Plaintiffs’ experiences are representative of DACA terminations nationally.  \n13  According to government statistics, DACA revocations increased by 25 percent in the \n14  first three months after President Trump’s inauguration in January 2017.8  Plaintiffs’ \n15  counsel are aware of at least 17 individuals around the country who, in the last ten \n16  months alone, have had their DACA and work authorization terminated without \n17  notice, a reasoned explanation, or an opportunity to respond, even though they \n18  continue to be eligible for DACA.  Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 2-14.  Given that there are \n19  currently nearly 700,000 DACA recipients across the country, id. ¶ 48, Ex. 33, there \n20  are likely at least dozens—if not many more—in the same situation whose stories \n21  have not reached Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Moreover, hundreds of thousands of individuals \n22  nationwide are at risk of having their DACA and work authorization terminated \n23  pursuant to Defendants’ unlawful policies and practices in the future as the program \n24  winds down over the next two years.  In fact, Plaintiffs’ counsel are aware of two \n25  additional DACA recipients to whom ICE recently issued NTAs despite their \n26  continued DACA eligibility, and who are at risk of receiving DACA termination \n27  8 Eiland Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. 5 (Keegan Hamilton, Targeting Dreamers, VICE News, Sept. \n8, 2017, https://news.vice.com/story/ice-was-going-after-dreamers-even-before-\n28  trump-killed-daca). \n8 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 15 of 29   Page ID\n #:1182\n1  letters from USCIS.  Id. ¶ 15.  In at least one of those cases, counsel for ICE has \n2  already represented that the individual’s DACA has been terminated.  Id. \n3  Moreover, federal immigration authorities have been instructed to screen every \n4  DACA recipient they encounter.  Id. ¶¶ 21-23, Exs. 6-8.  Just recently, in early \n5  September, ten DACA recipients were detained for hours by Customs and Border \n6  Patrol (“CBP”) agents in Texas even though they have valid DACA.  Id. ¶ 23, Ex. 8.  \n7  Although they were ultimately released, CBP scrutinized their records, presumably \n8  looking for a reason to hold them and revoke their DACA status.  Id.  This targeting of \n9  DACA recipients is likely to result in additional unlawful terminations. \n10  Moreover, Defendants’ actions demonstrate that they have been targeting \n11  DACA recipients for revocation even though they have committed no disqualifying \n12  conduct and remain eligible for the program.  On February 20, 2017, former DHS \n13  Secretary John Kelly issued a memorandum setting forth enforcement priorities that \n14  DHS would follow in its enforcement of the immigration laws (hereinafter, the “Kelly \n15  Memo”).9  The Kelly Memo states that, “[e]ffective immediately, . . . Department \n16  personnel shall faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States against all \n17  removable aliens.”  The memorandum provides that even noncitizens who have no \n18  criminal convictions, but merely have been “charged with any criminal offense that \n19  has not been resolved,” as well as any noncitizen who has “committed acts which \n20  constitute a chargeable criminal offense” will be prioritized for removal from the \n21  United States.  USCIS has revoked DACA grants of individuals who do not have \n22  criminal history disqualifying them from DACA under the carefully crafted DACA \n23  Memo and SOPs, but who have had minor encounters with law enforcement that \n24  could make them a priority under the Kelly Memo’s general expanded enforcement \n25  priorities.  See, e.g., Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *7 (N.D. Ga. June 12, 2017). \n26                                             \n9 Eiland Decl. ¶ 18, Ex. 3 (Memorandum from John Kelly, Enforcement of the \n27  Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest 2 (Feb. 20, 2017), available at \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Enforcement-of-the-\n28  Immigration-Laws-to-Serve-the-National-Interest.pdf). \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 16 of 29   Page ID\n #:1183\n1  The Kelly Memo and related DHS guidance, however, expressly exempt the \n2  DACA program from the Kelly Memo’s expanded priorities.  See Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 17-\n3  17, Exs. 2-3; see also Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *7-8, *12 (finding that “the Kelly \n4  Memo, by its own terms, has no application to the DACA program”).  Indeed, the \n5  Kelly Memo directly conflicts with the DACA Memo and SOPs, which define those \n6  eligible for DACA as low enforcement priorities and provide the relevant rules for \n7  termination of DACA.  See Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 at 18, 136-38.  Even so, USCIS \n8  has targeted for revocation individuals who remain eligible for DACA, thus further \n9  reinforcing that numerous DACA recipients are at risk of unlawful termination in the \n10  future.  \n11  ARGUMENT \n12  A  plaintiff  whose  suit  meets  the  requirements  of  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \n13  Procedure 23 has a “categorical” right “to pursue his claim as a class action.”  Shady \n14  Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 398 (2010).  To \n15  meet these requirements, the “suit must satisfy the criteria set forth in [Rule 23(a)] \n16  (i.e., numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also \n17  must fit into one of the three categories described in subdivision (b).”  Id. \n18  As set forth below, Plaintiffs’ proposed class satisfies all four of the Rule 23(a) \n19  prerequisites, as well as the judicially implied requirement of ascertainability.  The \n20  proposed class likewise meets the requirements for certification under Rule 23(b)(2).   \n21  This Court should certify the proposed class in keeping with the numerous court \n22  decisions certifying classes in similar actions challenging the federal government’s \n23  administration of immigration programs.  See, e.g., Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032 \n24  (9th Cir. 1998) (affirming certification of nationwide class of individuals challenging \n25  adequacy  of  notice  in  document  fraud  cases);  Arnott  v.

The Proposed Class Satisfies Rule 23(a)’s Requirements. \n10  A. Numerosity: The Proposed Class Consists of at Least Seventeen and \nLikely Many More DACA Recipients. \n11 \nRule 23(a)(1) requires that a class be “so numerous that joinder of all members \n12 \nis  impracticable.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a)(1).    “‘[I]mpracticability’  does  not  mean \n13 \n‘impossibility,’ but only the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the \n14 \nclass.”  Franco-Gonzales v. Napolitano, No. 10-cv-02211-DMG-DTBX, 2011 WL \n15 \n11705815, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011) (quoting Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine \n16 \nEstates, Inc., 329 F. 2d 909, 913-14 (9th Cir. 1964)).  No fixed number of class \n17 \nmembers is required.  Perez-Funez v. Dist. Dir., I.N.S., 611 F. Supp. 990, 995 (C.D. \n18 \nCal. 1984).  Moreover, where a plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, the \n19 \n“requirement is relaxed and plaintiffs may rely on [] reasonable inference[s] arising \n20 \nfrom plaintiffs’ other evidence that the number of unknown and future members of \n21 \n[the] proposed subclass . . . is sufficient to make joinder impracticable.”  Arnott v. U.S. \n22 \nCitizenship & Immigration Servs., 290 F.R.D. 579, 586 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (quoting \n23 \nSueoka v. United States, 101 Fed. App’x 649, 653 (9th Cir. 2004)).   \n24 \nHere, the number of class members far exceeds the requirement for numerosity.  \n25 \nFirst, Plaintiffs’ counsel is aware of at least 17 DACA recipients who, in the last ten \n26 \nmonths alone, have had their DACA terminated without notice or process, despite \n27 \nremaining eligible for the program.  Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 2-14.  Given the increasing \n28 \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 18 of 29   Page ID\n #:1185\n1  number of DACA revocations nationwide in 2017, see id. ¶ 20, Ex. 5, the targeting of \n2  DACA recipients by federal immigration authorities, and the overall scale of the \n3  program, with hundreds of thousands of current DACA recipients, id. ¶ 48, Ex. 33, \n4  there are likely at least dozens—if not many more—who have already had their \n5  DACA terminated pursuant to Defendants’ challenged practices.  Indeed, Defendants \n6  have submitted a declaration in the instant litigation representing that the number of \n7  DACA recipients subjected to terminations without process is such that identifying \n8  “all automatic terminations of DACA would . . . involve a manual review of hundreds \n9  of cases.”  Thomas Decl. ¶ 5 (emphasis added).  The Court can thus reasonably \n10  conclude that the proposed class is sufficiently numerous.  See Cervantez v. Celestica \n11  Corp., 253 F.R.D. 562, 569 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citations \n12  omitted) (noting that “where the exact size of the class is unknown but general \n13  knowledge and common sense indicate that it is large, the numerosity requirement is \n14  satisfied”); see also, e.g., Hum, 162 F.R.D. at 634 (courts have certified classes with \n15  as few as 13 members); Ark.

Los Angeles Cty., 669 F.2d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. 1982) (class of 39 \n17  sufficient), vacated on other grounds, 459 U.S. 810 (1982). \n18  Second, in addition to the number of individuals who have already had their \n19  DACA unlawfully terminated, Plaintiffs’ proposed class also includes individuals who \n20  will have their DACA terminated without notice or process, despite continuing to be \n21  eligible, if Defendants’ policies and practices are not enjoined.  Hundreds of \n22  thousands of DACA recipients are at risk of losing their deferred action if Defendants’ \n23  challenged practices are permitted to continue while the DACA program winds down \n24  over the next two years.  Indeed, Defendants themselves have conceded that USCIS \n25  engages in a practice of automatically terminating DACA without notice or process, \n26  based solely on the issuance of an NTA, without regard to whether the individual \n27  remains eligible for DACA.  See Thomas Decl. ¶ 4.  Immigration authorities’ \n28  increased screening of DACA recipients, as well as the large number of already-\n12 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 19 of 29   Page ID\n #:1186\n1  identified class members, further supports the inference that there will be additional \n2  class members in the future.   \n3  The presence of such future class members renders joinder inherently \n4  impractical, thereby satisfying the purpose behind the numerosity requirement.  See, \n5  e.g, Ali v. Ashcroft, 213 F.R.D. 390, 408 (W.D. Wash. 2003), aff’d, 346 F.3d 873 (9th \n6  Cir. 2003), vacated on other grounds, 421 F.3d 795 (9th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation \n7  marks and citation omitted) (“[W]here the class includes unnamed, unknown future \n8  members, joinder of such unknown individuals is impracticable and the numerosity \n9  requirement is therefore met, regardless of class size.” (quoting Natl. Assn. of \n10  Radiation Survivors v. Walters, 111 F.R.D. 595, 599 (N.D. Cal. 1986)); Smith v. \n11  Heckler, 595 F. Supp. 1173, 1186 (E.D. Cal. 1984) (in injunctive relief cases, \n12  “[j]oinder in the class of persons who may be injured in the future has been held \n13  impracticable without regard to the number of persons already injured”); Hawker v. \n14  Consovoy, 198 F.R.D. 619, 625 (D.N.J. 2001) (“The joinder of potential future class \n15  members who share a common characteristic, but whose identity cannot be \n16  determined yet is considered impracticable.”). \n17  B. The Class Presents Common Questions of Law and Fact. \n18  To satisfy commonality, Plaintiffs must show that “there are questions of law or \n19  fact common to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality \n20  requirement “has been construed permissively.”  Preap v. Johnson, 303 F.R.D. 566, \n21  585 (N.D. Cal. 2014), aff’d, 831 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Hanlon v. \n22  Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998)) (internal quotation marks \n23  omitted).  A plaintiff “need not show . . . that every question in the case, or even a \n24  preponderance of questions, is capable of class wide resolution.”  Parsons v.Ryan, 754 \n25  F.3d 657, 675 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Rather, \n26  even one shared legal issue can be sufficient.  See, e.g., Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor \n27  Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 589 (9th Cir. 2012) (noting that “commonality only requires a \n28  single significant question of law or fact”); Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046 (“What makes \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 20 of 29   Page ID\n #:1187\n1  the plaintiffs’ claims suitable for a class action is the common allegation that the \n2  INS’s procedures provide insufficient notice.”); Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, \n3  1122 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he commonality requirement[] asks us to look only for \n4  some shared legal issue or a common core of facts.”).  Moreover, “[i]ndividual \n5  variation among plaintiffs’ questions of law and fact does not defeat underlying legal \n6  commonality, because ‘the existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual \n7  predicates is sufficient’ to satisfy Rule 23.”  Santillan v. Ashcroft, No. C 04-2686 \n8  MHP, 2004 WL 2297990, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 12, 2004) (quoting Hanlon, 150 F.3d \n9  at 1019).  The commonality standard is even more liberal in a civil rights suit like this \n10  one, in which “the lawsuit challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all \n11  of the putative class members.”  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. \n12  2001), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 504-05 \n13  (2005).  \n14  Here, Plaintiffs’ lawsuit raises numerous legal questions common to the \n15  proposed class,10 including: \n16  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA and work authorization \n17  without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to be heard violates \n18  Defendants’ own rules for the DACA program and is therefore arbitrary and \n19  capricious under the APA; \n20  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of revoking an existing grant of DACA and work \n21  authorization without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to be \n22  heard is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA \n23  because it fails to provide a good reason for the agency’s change in position;  \n24  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA and work authorization \n25  without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to be heard violates \n26  the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution; and \n27                                             \n10   Plaintiffs’ claims are described in greater detail in their Motion for a Classwide \n28  Preliminary Injunction, filed this same date.\n \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 21 of 29   Page ID\n #:1188\n1  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA and work authorization \n2  based solely on the issuance of an NTA charging the individual with unlawful \n3  presence in the United States, is arbitrary and capricious under the APA \n4  because it is based on arbitrary, irrelevant factors.   \n5  Any one of these common issues, standing alone, is enough to satisfy Rule \n6  23(a)(2)’s permissive standard.  See Perez-Olano v. Gonzalez, 248 F.R.D. 248, 257 \n7  (C.D. Cal. 2008) (“Courts have found that a single common issue of law or fact is \n8  sufficient.”) (citation omitted); Sweet v. Pfizer, 232 F.R.D. 360, 367 (C.D. Cal. 2005) \n9  (observing that “there must only be one single issue common to the proposed class”) \n10  (quotation and citation omitted). \n11  Plaintiffs and proposed class members also share a common core of facts: (1) \n12  The determination of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ DACA is subject to the same \n13  rules, namely the DACA Memo and SOPs; (2) Plaintiffs and proposed class members \n14  all had their DACA terminated without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an \n15  opportunity to respond; and (3) Plaintiffs and proposed class members do not have \n16  any convictions that would disqualify them from the program.   \n17  Finally, Plaintiffs and proposed class members “have suffered the same injury,” \n18  in that Defendants have terminated each of their DACA without notice, a meaningful \n19  explanation, or an opportunity to be hear pursuant to the same unlawful policies or \n20  practices.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011) (quoting Gen. \n21  Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982)).  Should the Court agree that \n22  Defendants’ policies or practices violate the APA and/or the Due Process Clause, all \n23  who fall within the class will benefit from the requested relief—a nationwide \n24  injunction preventing the termination of their DACA pursuant to those practices.  \n25  Thus, a common answer as to the legality of the challenged policies and practices will \n26  “drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, \n27  981 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350). \n28 \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 22 of 29   Page ID\n #:1189\n1  Defendants may argue that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy commonality because the \n2  agency’s decision to revoke DACA is based on particular facts and circumstances \n3  unique to each recipient.  But this argument would misconstrue and misapply the \n4  commonality requirement.  Instead, “[w]here the circumstances of each particular \n5  class member vary but retain a common core of factual or legal issues with the rest of \n6  the class, commonality exists.”  Evon v. Law Offices of Sidney Mickell, 688 F.3d \n7  1015, 1029 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also \n8  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046 (“Differences among the class members with respect to the \n9  merits of their actual document fraud cases, however, are simply insufficient to defeat \n10  the propriety of class certification.  What makes the plaintiffs’ claims suitable for a \n11  class action is the common allegation that the INS’s procedures provide insufficient \n12  notice.”); Arnott, 290 F.R.D. at 586-87 (variation in business plans and investment \n13  projects did not defeat certification in light of common question of permissibility of \n14  retroactively applying new policy to those who “already received approval of I-526 \n15  petitions”).  Moreover, any factual differences that may exist among Plaintiffs and \n16  proposed class members are immaterial to their claims, which challenge Defendants’ \n17  common termination policies and practices as categorically violating the APA and the \n18  Due Process Clause—not the agency’s ultimate exercise of discretion with respect to \n19  each recipient.  See Orantes-Hernandez v. Smith, 541 F. Supp. 351 (C.D. Cal. 1982) \n20  (rejecting defendants’ argument that certification was unwarranted because class \n21  members’ suitability for relief was individualized where plaintiff challenged common \n22  agency practice, not ultimate outcome of cases).  \n23  C. Typicality: Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Typical of Those of Other Class \nMembers. \n24 \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defense of the representative parties \n25 \n[be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  The purpose of this requirement is \n26 \nto “assure that the interest of the named representative aligns with the interests of the \n27 \nclass” as a whole.  Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992).  \n28 \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 23 of 29   Page ID\n #:1190\n1  “Under the rule’s permissive standards, representative claims are ‘typical’ if they are \n2  reasonably coextensive with those of the absent class members.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at \n3  685 (quoting Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020).  “The test of typicality is ‘whether other \n4  members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct \n5  which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have \n6  been injured by the same course of conduct.’”  Id. (citation omitted).  As with \n7  commonality, factual differences among class members do not defeat typicality.  \n8  LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1332 (9th Cir. 1985) (“The minor differences in the \n9  manner in which the representative’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated does not \n10  render their claims atypical of those of the class.”) \n11  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed class.  Each Plaintiff, \n12  just like each proposed class members, had valid DACA and work authorization that \n13  USCIS terminated without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to be \n14  heard, pursuant to Defendants’ unlawful policies or practices.  Plaintiffs and class \n15  members assert that such action was arbitrary and capricious under the APA and \n16  violated the Due Process Clause.  Any factual variations among Plaintiffs and \n17  proposed class members in ways relevant to USCIS’s ultimate decision of whether to \n18  terminate DACA do not defeat typicality because, as described above, Plaintiffs’ \n19  claims do not implicate such differences.  See, e.g., Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1124 (“The \n20  particular characteristics of the Petitioner or any individual detainee will not impact \n21  the resolution of this general statutory question and, therefore, cannot render \n22  Petitioner’s claim atypical.”). \n23  D. Adequacy: Plaintiffs Will Adequately Protect the Interests of the \nProposed Class, and Plaintiffs’ Counsel Are More Than Qualified to \n24 \nLitigate this Action. \n25 \nRule 23(a)(4) requires that “[t]he representative parties will fairly and \n26 \nadequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  “Whether the \n27 \nclass representatives satisfy the adequacy requirement depends on ‘the qualifications \n28 \nof counsel for the representatives, an absence of antagonism, a sharing of interests \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 24 of 29   Page ID\n #:1191\n1  between representatives and absentees, and the unlikelihood that the suit is \n2  collusive.’”  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1125 (citing Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046). \n3  Plaintiffs’ counsel are deemed qualified when they can establish their \n4  experiences in previous class actions and cases involving the same area of law.  Lynch \n5  v. Rank, 604 F. Supp. 30, 37 (N.D. Cal. 1984), aff’d 747 F.2d 528 (9th Cir. 1984), \n6  amended on reh’g, 763 F.2d 1098 (9th Cir. 1985).  Here, putative Class Counsel are \n7  attorneys from the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project and ACLU of Southern \n8  California.  See Declaration of Jennifer Chang Newell (“Newell Decl.”).  \n9  Collectively, putative Class Counsel have extensive and diverse experience in \n10  complex immigration cases and class action litigation, and Class Counsel also have \n11  sufficient resources to litigate this matter to completion.  Id. ¶¶ 2-27.  Attorneys from \n12  the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project and ACLU of Southern California have been \n13  appointed class counsel and successfully litigated similar class action lawsuits in this \n14  district and in courts across the country.  Id.; see also, e.g., Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at \n15  1111; Alfaro Garcia v. Johnson, No. 14-cv-1775, 2014 WL 6657591, at *15 (N.D. \n16  Cal. 2014); Rivera v. Johnson, 307 F.R.D. 539 at 542-43 (W.D. Wa 2015); Franco-\n17  Gonzales, 2011 WL 11705815, at *1; Preap, 303 F.R.D. at 570; Khoury v. Asher, 3 F. \n18  Supp. 3d 877, 878 (W.D. Wash. 2014); RILR v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 181 \n19  (D.D.C. 2015). \n20  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class, \n21  and therefore are adequate class representatives.  Plaintiffs do not seek any unique or \n22  additional benefit from this litigation that may make their interests different from or \n23  adverse to those of absent class members.  Instead, Plaintiffs’ aim is to secure \n24  injunctive relief that will protect themselves and the entire class from the Defendants’ \n25  challenged practices and enjoin the Defendants from further violations.  See Arreola \n26  Decl. ¶¶ 42-43; Gil Decl. ¶¶ 27-28; Moreira Decl. ¶ 23-24.  Plaintiffs and Class \n27  Counsel do not seek financial gain at the cost of absent class members’ rights. \n28  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they lack any antagonism with the \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 25 of 29   Page ID\n #:1192\n1  class, that they share interests with proposed class members, and that no collusion is \n2  present. \n3  E. The Class Is Sufficiently Ascertainable. \n4  Although the Ninth Circuit has not yet ruled whether the judicially implied \n5  ascertainability requirement applies to classes certified under Rule 23(b)(2), other \n6  circuits have found that it does not.  See Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 563 (3d \n7  Cir. 2015) (“The nature of Rule 23(b)(2) actions, the Advisory Committee’s note on \n8  (b)(2) actions, and the practice of many [] other federal courts all lead us to conclude \n9  that ascertainability is not a requirement for certification of a (b)(2) class seeking only \n10  injunctive and declaratory relief . . . .”); Shook v. El Paso Cnty., 386 F.3d 963, 972 \n11  (10th Cir. 2004) (“[M]any courts have found Rule 23(b)(2) well suited for cases where \n12  the composition of the class is not readily ascertainable.”); Cole v. City of Memphis, \n13  839 F.3d 530, 542 (6th Cir. 2016), cert. denied 137 S. Ct. 2220 (2017) \n14  (“[A]scertainability is not an additional requirement for certification of a (b)(2) class \n15  seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief.”); Yaffe v. Powers, 454 F.2d 1362, \n16  1366 (1st Cir.1972) (no ascertainability requirement for Rule 23(b)(2) classes); see \n17  also, e.g., In re Yahoo Mail Litig., 308 F.R.D. 577, 597 (N.D. Cal. 2015).   \n18  In any event, the proposed class is sufficiently ascertainable because it is \n19  “administratively feasible” to ascertain whether an individual is a member.  Greater \n20  Los Angeles Agency on Deafness, Inc. v. Reel Servs. Mgmt. LLC, No. 13-cv-7172 PSG \n21  (ASX), 2014 WL 12561074, at *5 (C.D. Cal. May 6, 2014) (Gutierrez, J.) (internal \n22  quotation marks omitted) (finding ascertainable proposed class of individuals who are \n23  deaf or hard of hearing and require closed captioning).  Here, membership in the class \n24  is defined by clear and objective criteria: (1) the individual’s DACA has been or will \n25  be terminated without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to \n26  respond—that is, without the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate and a \n27  sufficient opportunity to respond to the reason for termination and (2) the individual \n28  has not been convicted of any disqualifying crime as set forth in the DACA Memo \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 26 of 29   Page ID\n #:1193\n1  and SOPs.  See supra at 3.  This definition is “‘precise, objective, and presently \n2  ascertainable.’”  O’Connor v. Boeing N. Am., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D. Cal. \n3  1998) (observing that class definitions of actions maintained under Rule 23(b)(2) \n4  command less precision than actions for damages requiring notice to the class); see \n5  also, e.g., Lamumba Corp. v. City of Oakland, No. 05-cv-2712 MHP, 2007 WL \n6  3245282, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2007) (“Plaintiffs putative class is based on the \n7  objective factors of business ownership, race, and indebtedness to the City, and \n8  therefore is sufficiently defined.”).  The fact that some administrative process may be \n9  required to identify class members does not undermine ascertainability.  See, e.g., \n10  Moreno v. Napolitano, No. 11-cv-5452, 2014 WL 4911938, at *6-7 (N.D. Ill. Sept. \n11  30, 2014) (finding that the necessity of manually reviewing tens of thousands of \n12  detainer forms to identify class members did not undermine ascertainability) (citing \n13  Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 693 F.3d 532, 539 (6th Cir. 2012)).  This is \n14  particularly true here, where USCIS keeps detailed records regarding DACA \n15  terminations, see Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 at 138 (instructing adjudicators to update \n16  systems), and routinely evaluates whether DACA recipients have disqualifying \n17  convictions.  See Dunnigan v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 214 F.R.D. 125, 136 (S.D.N.Y. \n18  2003) (holding that even a slow and burdensome process for identifying class \n19  members would not defeat the ascertainability requirement).  Moreover, Plaintiffs \n20  have proposed a practical process for implementing the requested preliminary \n21  injunction, which includes a procedure for identifying class members whose DACA \n22  USCIS has already unlawfully revoked.  See Pls.’ PI Proposed Order.  \n23  II.  This Action Satisfies the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). \n24  In addition to satisfying the four requirements of Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs also \n25  must meet one of the subsections of Rule 23(b).  Certification of a class under Rule \n26  23(b)(2) requires that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \n27  grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \n28 \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 27 of 29   Page ID\n #:1194\n1  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. \n2  R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n3  In the Ninth Circuit, “‘[i]t is sufficient’ to meet the requirements of Rule \n4  23(b)(2) [when] ‘class members complain of a pattern or practice that is generally \n5  applicable to the class as a whole.’”  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1125 (quoting Walters, \n6  145 F.3d at 1047); Lyon v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 308 F.R.D. 203, 213 \n7  (N.D. Cal. 2015) (injunctive or declaratory relief under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate \n8  when “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \n9  generally to the class”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, Rule “23(b)(2) \n10  was adopted in order to permit the prosecution of civil rights actions” like this one.  \n11  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047; Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1126 (finding that class of non-\n12  citizens detained during immigration proceedings met Rule 23(b)(2) criteria because \n13  “all class members’ [sought] the exact same relief as a matter of statutory or, in the \n14  alternative, constitutional right”). \n15  Importantly, “[t]he rule does not require [the court] to examine the viability or \n16  bases of class members’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, but only to look \n17  at whether class members seek uniform relief from a practice applicable to all of \n18  them.”  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1125.  “‘The key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible \n19  nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the conduct \n20  is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members \n21  or as to none of them.’”  Lyon, 308 F.R.D. at 213 (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, 131 S.Ct. \n22  at 2557). \n23  Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirements are plainly met.  Here, Plaintiffs ask the Court to \n24  declare Defendants’ termination policies and practices, which have impacted Plaintiffs \n25  and proposed class members, to be unlawful and to enjoin USCIS from: (1) enforcing \n26  the termination of DACA and related work authorization for Plaintiffs and class \n27  members whose DACA USCIS has already unlawfully terminated and (2) terminating \n28  DACA grants and work authorization in the future based solely on the issuance of an \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 28 of 29   Page ID\n #:1195\n1  NTA charging unlawful presence or otherwise absent a fair procedure that complies \n2  with the agency’s rules, including notice, a reasoned explanation, and an opportunity \n3  to be heard prior to termination.  See Pls.’ PI Proposed Order. \n4  This relief would benefit Plaintiffs as well as all members of the proposed \n5  classes in the same fashion.  No individual class member would be entitled to a \n6  different injunction or declaratory judgment.  The requested relief would address these \n7  policies or practices in a single stroke, and thus the proposed class plainly warrants \n8  certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 689 (finding declaratory \n9  and injunctive relief proper as to the whole class where “every [member] in the \n10  proposed class is allegedly suffering the same (or at least a similar) injury and that \n11  injury can be alleviated for every class member by uniform changes in . . . policy and \n12  practice”); Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1126 (certifying class of immigrant detainees under \n13  Rule 23(b)(2) where “relief from a single practice is requested by all class members”). \n14  Given the nature of Plaintiffs’ claims, which challenge USCIS’s centralized and \n15  uniform DACA termination practices, class certification should be nationwide.  \n16  Defendants have indicated that USCIS has a practice of automatically terminating \n17  individual DACA grants, without process.  See Thomas Decl. ¶ 4.  Plaintiffs have \n18  identified at least 17 examples of Defendant’s unlawful DACA terminations from \n19  various states around the country (including Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Minnesota, \n20  South Dakota, North Carolina, New Jersey, and California).  See Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 2-14.  \n21  And given the nationwide scope and scale of the program, there are nearly 700,000 \n22  DACA recipients in all 50 states who are potentially at risk of having their DACA \n23  unlawfully terminated pursuant to Defendants’ practices.  Id. ¶ 48, Ex. 33. \n24  Certification that is not nationwide in scope would result in Defendants continuing to \n25  apply an unlawful policy to DACA recipients simply by virtue of their geographic \n26  location.  Such piecemeal relief would lead to arbitrary and unjust results.  See \n27  Gorbach v. Reno, 181 F.R.D. 642, 644 (W.D. Wash. 1998), aff’d, 219 F.3d 1087 (9th \n28  Cir. 2000) (holding certification of a nationwide class was particularly fitting because \n22 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-1   Filed 12/29/17   Page 29 of 29   Page ID\n #:1196\n1  “anything less [than] a nationwide class would result in an anomalous situation \n2  allowing the INS to pursue denaturalization proceedings against some citizens, but not \n3  others, depending on which district they reside in”).  \n4  Because Plaintiffs and proposed class members all have suffered or will suffer \n5  the same statutory and constitutional violations as a result of the government’s \n6  challenged practices or policies, and because they seek singular injunctive and \n7  corresponding declaratory relief that remedy those injuries, the Court should certify \n8  the class under Rule 23(b)(2). \n9  CONCLUSION \n10  Plaintiffs respectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion and enter an \n11  order certifying the proposed class under Rule 23(b)(2); appoint Plaintiffs as Class \n12  Representatives; and appoint the Plaintiffs’ Counsel from ACLU Immigrants’ Rights \n13  Project and the ACLU of Southern California as Class Counsel. \n14 \n15  Dated: December 29, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n16 \n/s/ Katrina L.

I am duly licensed to practice law in the State of California and am a Managing \n3  Attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”) Immigrants’ Rights \n4  Project (“IRP”). I am counsel of record for Plaintiffs Inland Empire-Immigrant Youth \n5  Collective, Jesús Alonso Arreola Robles, José Eduardo Gil Robles, and Ronan Carlos \n6  De Souza Moreira in the above-entitled action. I have knowledge of the facts set forth \n7  herein, and if called upon to testify as a witness thereto, I could and would \n8  competently do so under oath. \n9  2.  I have been practicing law as an attorney with ACLU IRP since 2004. IRP is a \n10  project of the national legal department of the ACLU. I have been admitted to practice \n11  in California and have been admitted to the bars of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. \n12  Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and District of \n13  Columbia Circuits, and the U.S. District Courts for the Northern, Central, and \n14  Southern Districts of California, as well as the Eastern District of Michigan. I am a \n15  2003 graduate of Stanford Law School, where I was a member of the Order of the \n16  Coif. From 2003 to 2004, I served as law clerk to the Honorable Marsha S. Berzon of \n17  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Previously, I was a Skadden Fellow at \n18  IRP from 2004 to 2006, before becoming a member of IRP’s permanent staff. I was \n19  named one of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association’s Best Lawyers \n20  Under 40 in 2014, and I am the 2013 recipient of Stanford Law School’s Miles Rubin \n21  Public Interest Award. In January 2017, I was selected to serve a three-year term as a \n22  Ninth Circuit Appellate Lawyer Representative. I have published articles on the rights \n23  of undocumented immigrants and housing discrimination in the Hofstra Labor & \n24  Employment Law Journal, California Labor & Employment Law Review, and \n25  Stanford Law Review. \n26  3.  I am an expert on legal and policy issues related to the Deferred Action for \n27  Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program. I am counsel in Colotl v. Duke, No. 17-1670, \n28  2017 WL 2889681 (N.D. Ga. June 12, 2017), a lawsuit challenging the arbitrary \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-3   Filed 12/29/17   Page 4 of 13   Page ID\n #:1203\n1  revocation of an individual’s DACA status and employment authorization. I also serve \n2  as counsel in Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 855 F.3d 957 (9th Cir. 2017), a \n3  legal challenge to Arizona’s policy denying drivers’ licenses to DACA recipients, and \n4  served as counsel in One Michigan v. Johnson, 2:12-cv-15551 (filed E.D. Mi. Dec. 19, \n5  2012), a legal challenge to a similar policy in Michigan. In Arizona Dream Act \n6  Coalition, we obtained a permanent injunction against Arizona’s discriminatory \n7  driver’s license policy, potentially benefitting over 25,000 DACA recipients residing \n8  in Arizona. \n9  4.  I am also an expert on federal court jurisdiction in immigration cases. My \n10  jurisdictional cases have included Luna v. Holder, 637 F.3d 85 (2d Cir. 2011) (court-\n11  appointed amicus in pro se case involving federal court jurisdiction over untimely \n12  appeal caused by ineffective assistance of counsel); Thompson v. Holder, 637 F.3d 85 \n13  (2d Cir. 2011) (court-appointed amicus in pro se case involving federal court \n14  jurisdiction over noncitizen’s claim that federal government interference precluded \n15  timely filing of his appeal); Castro et al. v. Dep’t of Homeland Security (3d Cir. No. \n16  16-1339, E.D. Penn. No. 5-15-cv-06153) (consolidated habeas petitions on behalf of \n17  28 Central American families seeking judicial review of expedited removal orders); \n18  Ramadan v. Gonzales 479 F.3d 646 (9th Cir. 2007) (judicial review of removal \n19  orders) (amicus); and Chen v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 315 (2d Cir. 2006) (judicial review \n20  of removal orders) (amicus). I have also served as faculty on the topic of immigration \n21  jurisdiction for the Federal Judiciary Center’s National Seminar for Appellate Staff \n22  Attorneys. \n23  5.  In my over 13 years’ of practice as a lawyer, I have served as counsel in \n24  numerous other complex cases involving immigrants’ rights. For example, I served as \n25  nationwide class co-counsel in Orantes-Hernandez v. Gonzales, Nos. 07-56509, 08-\n26  55231, 321 Fed. Appx. 625, 2009 WL 905454 (9th Cir. April 6, 2009), in which I \n27  successfully helped defeat the federal government’s motion to dissolve a nationwide \n28  injunction benefitting a class of Salvadoran asylum seekers detained by immigration \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-3   Filed 12/29/17   Page 5 of 13   Page ID\n #:1204\n1  authorities. See also Orantes-Hernandez v. Gonzales, 504 F.Supp.2d 825 (C.D. Cal. \n2  2007). My other cases have included Morales v. Chadbourne, 235 F.Supp.3d 388 (D. \n3  R.I. 2017) (won summary judgment in Fourth Amendment challenge to detention of \n4  U.S. citizen based on an immigration detainer); Utah Coalition of La Raza et al. v. \n5  Herbert, 26 F.

City of Hazleton, 724 \n7  F.3d 297 (3d Cir. 2013) (won permanent injunction in constitutional challenge to local \n8  immigration-related employer sanctions and housing ordinance); Villas at Parkside \n9  Partners v. City of Farmers Branch, 726 F.3d 524 (5th Cir. 2013) (en banc) (won \n10  permanent injunction in constitutional challenge to local immigration-related housing \n11  ordinance); AFL-CIO v. Chertoff, 552 F. Supp. 2d 999 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (won \n12  preliminary injunction against Department of Homeland Security Social Security “no-\n13  match” regulation); Buck v. Stankovic 485 F. Supp. 2d 576 (M.D. Pa. 2007) (won \n14  preliminary injunction in due process and Equal Protection challenge to denial of \n15  marriage license to an undocumented immigrant and his U.S. citizen fiancée). \n16  6.  Through these cases and others, I have come to have distinctive knowledge and \n17  specialized skill in the area of immigrants’ rights litigation in the federal courts. \n18  7.  Michael Tan has worked as a Staff Attorney at IRP since 2012. He is admitted \n19  in to practice in New York and has been admitted to the bars of the U.S. Supreme \n20  Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the First, Third, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh \n21  Circuits, and the U.S. District Courts for the Eastern District of Michigan and \n22  Northern District of California.

Ms. Eiland received her J.D. from Stanford Law School in 2010 and her B.A. \n17  from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2003.  Following a year-long \n18  clerkship with the Honorable Keith P.

My name is José Eduardo1 Gil Robles.  I am 24 years old and I live in \n5  Coon Rapids, Minnesota, near Minneapolis.  I have lived in the United States since I \n6  was five years old.  I was born in Mexico in January 1993, but I came to the United \n7  States in 1998 without inspection at a border crossing.  I consider the United States to \n8  be my home.  I don’t really remember living in Mexico.  \n9  2.  I attended public schools in the Minneapolis area starting in kindergarten, \n10  and I graduated from Coon Rapids High School.   \n11  3.  I have five younger siblings, ages nine to 19 years old.  They were all \n12  born in this country and are U.S. citizens.  I am very close to my younger sisters and \n13  brother, and I spend a lot of my free time hanging out with them at home and taking \n14  them to do activities.  I also help my youngest sister with her homework. \n15  4.  I have a steady girlfriend who is also a U.S. citizen.  I like to spend time \n16  with her and her family.  I have attended many of my girlfriend’s family gatherings \n17  and I sometimes take my girlfriend’s little sister and my little sister on outings to \n18  places like Chuck E. Cheese’s and to go swimming at a pool during the summer. \n19  5.  I am a member of my local Catholic church, St. Stephens, in Anoka, \n20  Minnesota.  I have been an active member of the Catholic Church throughout my life, \n21  and I have regularly attended services at St. Stephens for about eight years.  In high \n22  school, I was an Altar Server there.  I also participate in a smaller Bible study and \n23  prayer group on Thursday nights, where I meet with others to pray and discuss Bible \n24  stories and what they teach us about everyday life and how to be a good person.  In \n25  addition  to  being  a  welcoming  and  tight-knit  religious  community,  my  church \n26  encourages us to do community service to help others.  For example, a few years ago, \n27  after Hurricane Sandy, I traveled to the New York City area with members of my \n                                           \n28  1   Some of my friends and family call me by my middle name, Eduardo.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-4   Filed 12/29/17   Page 4 of 8   Page ID #:1216\n1  church to help rebuild a church there that was damaged in the storm.  I spent about ten \n2  days working on a team to replace rotten wood and damaged flooring, install new \n3  sheet rock, fix sidewalks, and clean up the yard.  I have also volunteered to help with \n4  various landscaping projects at another local church where I am involved in the youth \n5  ministry.   \n6  6.  One of my main hobbies is training at a boxing gym.  I’ve been doing it \n7  since I was about 14 years old and I practice almost every day.  Although I don’t \n8  compete in matches, the training helps me stay in shape and be disciplined.  It requires \n9  me to stick with a routine and to get up early so that I have time to train and fulfill my \n10  other  responsibilities.    I  also  really  enjoy  learning  the  skills  and  techniques  and \n11  spending time at the gym with other people who love the sport.  I find that it helps me \n12  keep a calm mind even when things get hectic. \n13  The Impact of DACA on My Life  \n14  7.  When I heard about DACA, I was really happy because it would allow \n15  me to apply for a work permit and a driver’s license, which I wasn’t able to get before.  \n16  I applied as soon as I could save up the money for the application fee.   \n17  8.  When I first applied for deferred action and work authorization in 2015, I \n18  gave the government my school records and information about where I lived.  I also \n19  went to an appointment so that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) \n20  could take my fingerprints and photographs.   \n21  9.  I was granted DACA and work authorization in August 2015.  My first \n22  grant of DACA was valid for two years, until August 26, 2017. \n23  10.  In  April  2017,  I  filed  a  DACA  renewal  application  and,  again,  the \n24  government  granted  me  deferred  action  and  work  authorization.    I  received  the \n25  approval notice in August 2017, which said that my DACA was supposed to be valid \n26  until August 13, 2019.  I trusted the U.S. government to stay true to its word that, if I \n27  followed all the rules, my DACA would not be taken away. \n28 \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-4   Filed 12/29/17   Page 5 of 8   Page ID #:1217\n1  11.  Being granted DACA had a huge positive impact on my life.  I was able \n2  to work full time as a baker at a local restaurant chain called Key’s Café & Bakery.  I \n3  learned fast and was promoted to bakery manager after about a year and a half.  In that \n4  position, it was my job to make the bakery schedule for the other bakery employees, \n5  decorate and deliver wedding cakes, order and stock ingredients, make sure we were \n6  making enough cakes and pies, and handle customer complaints.  I enjoyed the job a \n7  lot—especially decorating cakes.  Many people have told me that I have a real talent \n8  for it.  I worked at Key’s Café & Bakery until the summer of 2017.  Soon after that, I \n9  started  working  for  a  logistics  company,  making  deliveries  of  large  items  like \n10  furniture and appliances to homes and businesses in the Minneapolis area.  I liked that \n11  the job allowed me to be active and spend time outside.   \n12  12.  Since I got DACA, I used my work authorization to help my family by \n13  contributing  money  towards  our  rent  and  other  living  expenses.    Until  I  lost  my \n14  DACA, I was paying about half of our rent and bills.  My jobs also allowed me to start \n15  saving up money so that I can take college classes one day.  My goal is to get my \n16  associate’s degree to help me be more competitive for jobs and figure out what I want \n17  to do professionally in the long term. \n18  13.  DACA also allowed me to get a Social Security Number and a driver’s \n19  license for the first time.  Having a license meant that I could drive to work and \n20  church and give my siblings rides to school and to their extracurricular activities.  I \n21  also helped with grocery shopping and did other errands for my family using the car I \n22  purchased with my money from my paychecks. \n23  My Arrest and Revocation of My DACA and Work Permit \n24  14.  On September 20, 2017, I was pulled over by the police while driving in \n25  my car with two passengers.  I went to high school with one of the young men and the \n26  other is a friend of my classmate.  The officer said that my driver’s license wasn’t \n27  valid anymore.  I was arrested and taken to the local jail and later charged with the \n28  misdemeanor traffic violation of driving after cancellation of my driver’s license.  It \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-4   Filed 12/29/17   Page 6 of 8   Page ID #:1218\n1  was supposedly cancelled because it required a “status check” when my previous \n2  DACA grant expired a few weeks before.  I wasn’t aware that there was any problem \n3  with my license. \n4  15. I was released from jail the next day, but about a month later, agents from\n5  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) showed up at my work and arrested \n6  me in the parking lot.  I told them that I had DACA, but they still sent me to an \n7  immigration detention center and gave me a Notice to Appear on October 23, 2017, \n8  which charged me with being removable because I was present in the United States \n9  without admission.  I couldn’t understand why they put me in deportation proceedings \n10  since I had been granted a two-year DACA renewal just two months before.  And a \n11  minor traffic offense like driving on a cancelled license is not supposed to disqualify \n12  someone from DACA.   \n13  16. Being  in  the  detention  center  was  terrible.    I  had  trouble  eating  and\n14  sleeping and I felt depressed and sad.  It was really difficult to talk to my family on \n15  the phone and hear them tell me they were having a hard time because I was in \n16  detention—especially my youngest sister who is only nine years old.  It broke my \n17  heart to hear her cry. \n18  17. Fortunately, my family was able to call an attorney who came to see me\n19  at the detention center.  \n20  18. I first had a bond hearing before an immigration judge on November 6,\n21  2017, which was continued to November 27, 2017.  During the bond hearings, the \n22  government attorney raised the events that led to my arrest and charge for driving on a \n23  cancelled  license.    The  government  attorney  argued  that  I  was  a  danger  to  the \n24  community because one of the passengers in the car when I was pulled over had a toy \n25  pellet gun and had supposedly shot it from the car window.  But my immigration \n26  lawyer argued that I was not a danger to anyone.  She explained to the judge that the \n27  pellet gun was a toy, not a firearm, and that it was not mine.  My lawyer also told the \n28  judge that I did not touch the pellet gun or shoot it.  In fact, I was concentrating on \n4 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-4   Filed 12/29/17   Page 7 of 8   Page ID #:1219\n1  driving and didn’t even know that my passenger had brought a pellet gun.  I don’t own \n2  any kind of gun—even a toy one.  My lawyer also emphasized that the only crime I \n3  was charged with was driving on a cancelled license.  My lawyer also gave the judge \n4  many  letters  from  my  relatives,  friends,  employers,  and  members  of  my  church \n5  speaking about my good character. \n6  19.  After hearing all the evidence, including  reviewing the police records \n7  from my arrest, the immigration judge concluded that I was not a danger to the public \n8  and ordered my release on a $5,000 bond. \n9  20.  On November 28, 2017, I posted bond and was released from detention. \n10  21.  I was detained for over a month, which was really hard on me and my \n11  family, both emotionally and financially.  \n12  22.  But things got worse.  I found out that, while I was in detention, on \n13  November 14, 2017, USCIS sent me a Notice of Action terminating my DACA and \n14  work permit “as of the date [my] NTA was issued.”  The Notice of Action says that an \n15  “appeal or motion to reopen/reconsider this notice of action may not be filed.” \n16  23.  I never received any prior notice that USCIS intended to terminate my \n17  DACA and work permit, nor did I have any opportunity to respond to the notice or \n18  otherwise contest the termination of my DACA or work permit beforehand.  I also got \n19  no explanation for the decision beyond the one sentence in the Notice of Action. \n20  24.  Losing my DACA has changed everything for me.  I am no longer able to \n21  work at my job with the logistics company, which paid me approximately $2,400 per \n22  month.  Being in detention for over a month was really frightening for both me and \n23  my family.  I missed them very much and still have bad memories about my time in \n24  detention. \n25  25.  Everything is more difficult after losing my DACA, both because I am \n26  not authorized to work, and because I don’t know what will happen to me next.  \n27  26.  I’m no longer able to contribute to my family’s resources the way that I \n28  could before, and I am not able to plan for my future, including saving up money to \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-4   Filed 12/29/17   Page 8 of 8   Page ID #:1220\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-9   Filed 12/29/17   Page 1 of 7   Page ID #:1249\n1  Jennifer Chang Newell (SBN 233033) \njnewell@aclu.org \n2  Katrina L.

My name is Ronan Carlos De Souza Moreira.  I am 24 years old and I \n6  live in Kennesaw, Georgia, near Atlanta.  I have lived in the United States for almost \n7  twelve years.  I was born in Brazil in December 1992. I came to the United States in \n8  2006 with my two brothers and my mother on a visitor’s visa.  My father already lived \n9  here at that time.  I have never left the country since I arrived. I consider the United \n10  States to be my home.   \n11  2.   I attended public schools in Marietta, Georgia starting in middle school, \n12  and I graduated from Wheeler High School.  In school, I played soccer and tennis, and \n13  participated in art club and French club.  During middle school and high school, I \n14  received various certificates of achievement for my excellent attendance in school, as \n15  well as for getting good grades and working hard to improve my English language \n16  skills.  I graduated from high school in 2012. \n17  3.  While I was in high school, I also attended a Brazilian Protestant church \n18  called  The  Vine  in  Atlanta.  I  took  spiritual  maturity  courses  at  that  church  and \n19  eventually  became  a  youth  leader,  which  meant  that  I  led  youth  meetings  at  my \n20  parents’ house every Wednesday.  While at the church, I also collected food for the \n21  homeless and organized free yard sales.  I also often volunteered at church events. \n22  4.  About a year after graduating from high school, I started working on a \n23  college degree at Perimeter College at Georgia State University in Atlanta.  However, \n24  I was unable to complete my college degree due to my family’s financial situation.  I \n25  hope someday to go back to college.   \n26  5.  My mom is a Lawful Permanent Resident, and my older brother is a U.S. \n27  citizen.  My older brother’s wife is pregnant, and they’re expecting a child in January.  \n28  I’m  excited  to  be  an  uncle.   My  younger  brother,  who  recently  turned  18,  has  a \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-9   Filed 12/29/17   Page 4 of 7   Page ID #:1252\n1  pending application for permanent residence.  My father is also seeking permanent \n2  residence.  My aunt and two cousins, who are all U.S. citizens, also live in Georgia.   \n3  6.  I am very close to my family.  We live together, and when my parents \n4  need my help, I contribute to household expenses. We spend all our holidays and \n5  birthdays together, and whenever we can, we travel together—for example, I often go \n6  fishing with my dad in Florida.  I love to travel, and have visited at least ten states. \n7  Eventually, I would like to start my own travel business. \n8  The Impact of DACA on My Life  \n9  7.  When I first heard about DACA, I was really happy because it would \n10  allow me to apply for a work permit and a driver’s license, which I wasn’t able to get \n11  before.  I first applied for DACA in May 2013, and was approved in August 2013.  I \n12  applied  for  renewal in  July  2015,  and  was  again  approved for  a  DACA  grant in \n13  October 2015, this one lasting until October 2017.  I again applied for renewal in \n14  August 2017, and I was approved on November 2, 2017.   \n15  8.  When I first applied for deferred action and work authorization in 2013, I \n16  gave the government my school records and information about where I lived.  I also \n17  went to an appointment so that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) \n18  could take my fingerprints and photographs.   \n19  9.  Being granted DACA had a huge—and good—effect on my life.  After I \n20  stopped school in the fall of 2013, I took several temporary jobs, including at AT&T, \n21  at a flooring company, and at a bakery.  Starting in August, 2014, I began working for \n22  a new flooring company permanently.  I started out as an assistant to the installation \n23  manager, but within six months I took over as installation manager. That job involved \n24  supervising about 20 flooring installers, dispatching them to jobs throughout the day, \n25  speaking frequently with them and our customers, solving problems as they arose, and \n26  addressing payroll, delivery, and inventory issues. \n27  10.  I used my work authorization to help my family and to travel around the \n28  United States when I had time off.  My job also allowed me to start saving up money \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-9   Filed 12/29/17   Page 5 of 7   Page ID #:1253\n1  so that I can take college classes again one day.  My goal is to get my college degree \n2  in business administration eventually and to start my own business, maybe in travel. \n3  11.  DACA also allowed me to get a Social Security Number and a driver’s \n4  license for the first time.  Having a license meant that I could drive to work and travel.   \n5  My Arrest and Revocation of My DACA and Work Permit \n6  12.  On November 2, 2017, I was out with a friend, and we stopped at a gas \n7  station.  We got into an argument there, and although it wasn’t a serious fight, we \n8  raised our voices.  Someone overheard us and called the police, even though neither of \n9  us threatened or touched the other.  When the police arrived, they realized that our \n10  argument was not serious, but they nonetheless asked to see our IDs.   \n11  13.  When the officer looked at my ID, he said the expiration date had been \n12  altered.  The officers arrested me, but not my friend. \n13  14.  I appeared before a judge soon, who immediately granted me bail, but \n14  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) had already placed a hold on me, and \n15  I had to stay in jail for several more days, until immigration officers came to pick me \n16  up.  The immigration officers brought me to Irwin Detention Center, where I was \n17  given a Notice To Appear (“NTA”) charging me with overstaying a visa.  I have been \n18  charged with the misdemeanor of possession of an altered identification document. \n19  15.  My parents found an immigration attorney for me, who requested a bond \n20  hearing for me, but that hearing was repeatedly postponed, first for ICE to collect \n21  documents related to the charge against me, then for Thanksgiving, and then because \n22  the hearing was reassigned to a different immigration judge.   \n23  16.  I finally had a bond hearing on December 7, 2017.  At that hearing, the \n24  lawyer for the government did not contest that I was neither a flight risk nor a danger \n25  to the community, and offered me a bond, which I accepted.  I posted the bond and \n26  was released the next day. \n27 \n28 \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-9   Filed 12/29/17   Page 6 of 7   Page ID #:1254\n1  17.  Being in detention was traumatic.  Although I’m 25 years old, I look \n2  much younger, and I was afraid of the older men.  I got very depressed, and I missed \n3  my family.  I didn’t know when I would be able to see them again. \n4  18.  While I was detained, USCIS sent me a Notice of Action terminating my \n5  DACA and work permit “automatically as of the date [my] NTA was issued.”  The \n6  Notice of Action says that an “appeal or motion to reopen/reconsider this notice of \n7  action may not be filed.” \n8  19.  I never received any prior notice that USCIS intended to terminate my \n9  DACA and work permit, nor did I have any opportunity to respond to the notice or \n10  otherwise contest the termination of my DACA or work permit beforehand.  I also got \n11  no explanation for the decision beyond the one sentence in the Notice of Action. \n12  20.  Now that I’ve lost my DACA, I don’t know what to do.  I’m no longer \n13  authorized to work or drive, and I am not able to plan for my future.  I’ve lost the \n14  freedom to be a normal part of society.  I’m really afraid about what will happen to me \n15  now.   \n16  21.  I also feel that it’s not fair that I’ve lost my DACA just because of a \n17  possible minor misdemeanor charge that would not per se disqualify me from DACA \n18  even if I were convicted.  Everything is more difficult after losing my DACA. I don’t \n19  know what will happen to me next.  \n20  22.  The  uncertainty  has  made  me  depressed.    I  feel  very  hopeless  and \n21  stressed. \n22  23.  I understand that I am a named plaintiff in this proposed class action \n23  lawsuit.  I understand that I need to stay informed about what is happening in the case \n24  and that I need to think about the interests of other proposed class members and act on \n25  those interests.  I am prepared to represent the proposed class in this case and will take \n26  my responsibilities seriously. \n27  24.  I know that there are many other people like me who have lost their \n28  DACA despite doing nothing to make them ineligible for the program.  I want to be a \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-9   Filed 12/29/17   Page 7 of 7   Page ID #:1255\n1  class representative to help all the people like me who have lost their DACA withou \n2  notice  or process  and  despite  doing  nothing  to  make  them  disqualified  from  th \n3  program. \n4  My Documents \n5  25.

Eiland, make this declaration based on my own personal \n2 \nknowledge and if called to testify I could and would do so competently as follows: \n3 \n1.  I am an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation.  I am \n4 \nlicensed in the state of California and have been admitted to practice in this court.  I \n5 \nam counsel of record for Plaintiffs Inland Empire-Immigrant Youth Collective, Jesús \n6 \nAlonso Arreola Robles, José Eduardo Gil Robles, and Ronan Carlos De Souza \n7 \nMoreira in the above-entitled action. \n8 \nDACA Terminations \n9 \n2.  In March 2017, I began collecting information about the U.S. Department of \n10 \nHomeland Security’s terminations of grants of Deferred Action for Childhood \n11 \nArrivals (“DACA”) and associated employment authorization.  Between March 2017 \n12 \nand the present, I and other staff members reviewed news reports and corresponded \n13 \nand spoke with numerous former DACA recipients and immigration attorneys across \n14 \nthe country.   \n15 \n3.  This investigation revealed that, since January 2017, there have been dozens of \n16 \ninstances around the country in which the United States Citizenship and Immigration \n17 \nServices (“USCIS”) has terminated individuals’ DACA and work authorization \n18 \nwithout notice, a reasoned explanation, or an opportunity to be heard.  In at least 17 of \n19 \nthose cases, I determined based on publicly available information, conversations \n20 \nand/or correspondence with the former DACA recipients and/or their immigration \n21 \nlawyers, and/or review of criminal record documents, that the individual did not have \n22 \nany disqualifying criminal convictions as set forth in the DACA Memorandum and \n23 \nStandard Operating Procedures.   \n24 \n4.  For example, all three of the named plaintiffs had their DACA and work \n25 \nauthorization terminated since February 2017, without notice, a meaningful \n26 \nexplanation, or an opportunity to respond.  None of them have any criminal \n27 \nconvictions that would disqualify them from DACA.  \n28 \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-13   Filed 12/29/17   Page 4 of 13   Page ID\n #:1269\n1  5.  In addition, in April, immigration authorities detained a 26-year-old DACA \n2  recipient in Georgia and issued him a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) after he was arrested \n3  on a misdemeanor charge.  Although the prosecutor subsequently dropped the charge \n4  and an immigration judge ordered the DACA recipient released on bond, USCIS had \n5  already revoked his DACA, without notice or an opportunity to be heard.    \n6  6.  In May, immigration authorities arrested and detained a 19-year-old DACA \n7  recipient in North Carolina and issued him an NTA after he was arrested on a \n8  misdemeanor charge.  He pled guilty to a minor misdemeanor that did not disqualify \n9  him from DACA, but USCIS nonetheless revoked his DACA, without notice or an \n10  opportunity to be heard.      \n11  7.  In May, USCIS also revoked the DACA grant and work permit of then-28-year-\n12  old Georgia resident and paralegal Jessica Colotl without notice, denying her renewal \n13  request and denying her an opportunity to be heard.  Federal authorities publicly stated \n14  that the revocation was based on minor, non-disqualifying criminal history—namely, \n15  driving without a license—that Ms. Colotl had disclosed in her prior DACA \n16  applications.  See Exhibit 5, below. \n17  8.  In June, immigration authorities arrested and detained a 22-year-old DACA \n18  recipient in California for twelve days.  ICE issued him an NTA, even though he had \n19  valid DACA and had done nothing to change his eligibility for the program.  Although \n20  ICE voluntarily released him from detention and cancelled his removal proceedings, \n21  USCIS nonetheless revoked his DACA, without notice or an opportunity to be heard.  \n22  See Exhibit 23, below. \n23  9.  In July, USCIS revoked the DACA grant and work permit of a 32-year-old \n24  South Dakota resident without notice or an opportunity to be heard, despite granting \n25  him a two-year renewal only seven months before in December 2016.  Federal \n26  authorities did not provide a clear reason for revoking his DACA, even though he has \n27  only a single, non-disqualifying misdemeanor conviction that he had disclosed in all \n28  prior DACA applications. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-13   Filed 12/29/17   Page 5 of 13   Page ID\n #:1270\n1  10.  In September, USCIS revoked the DACA grant and work permit of a 30-year-\n2  old Minnesota resident and mother without notice or an opportunity to be heard. \n3  Federal authorities did not provide a clear reason for revoking her DACA, even \n4  though she has only minor traffic violations and remains eligible for the program. \n5  11.  In November, USCIS revoked the DACA and work permit of Felipe Abonza \n6  Lopez, a 20-year-old from Texas.  In October, Customs and Border Protection \n7  (“CBP”) detained Mr. Abonza Lopez, who wears a prosthetic leg, when the car he was \n8  riding in with undocumented family members was pulled over by local police who \n9  handed the passengers over to CBP.  Although CBP claimed that Mr. Abonza Lopez \n10  was arrested as part of an alien smuggling investigation, he was never charged with a \n11  crime and an immigration judge ordered him released on bond after finding that he did \n12  not pose a danger to the community.  Even so, USCIS revoked his DACA, without \n13  notice or an opportunity to be heard.  See Exhibit 22, below. \n14  12.  In October, USCIS revoked the DACA grant and work permit of a young \n15  California resident without notice or an opportunity to be heard.  USCIS did not \n16  provide a clear reason for revoking his DACA, even though he does not have any \n17  disqualifying criminal conviction. \n18  13.  In February, immigration authorities arrested and detained 23-year-old Daniel \n19  Ramirez Medina, a Washington state resident.  ICE issued him an NTA, even though \n20  he had valid DACA and had done nothing to change his eligibility for the program. \n21  An immigration judge determined that he is not a flight risk or danger to the \n22  community, and ordered him released on bond, but USCIS nonetheless revoked his \n23  DACA, without notice or opportunity to be heard.  See Exhibit 4, below. \n24  14.  In addition to these cases, I am aware of five other individuals whose DACA \n25  was revoked without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to be heard, \n26  despite having no disqualifying criminal convictions, in California, Louisiana, \n27  Georgia, Minnesota, and New Jersey. \n28 \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 39-13   Filed 12/29/17   Page 6 of 13   Page ID\n #:1271\n1  15.  I recently learned of two additional DACA recipients, in Colorado and \n2  Minnesota, respectively, who have been issued NTAs in immigration court, despite \n3  having no disqualifying criminal convictions, but who have not yet received a notice \n4  of termination from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.  In at \n5  least one of those cases, counsel for ICE represented in immigration court that the \n6  individual’s DACA had been terminated.   \n7  Attached Documents \n8  16.

Likewise, Defendants repeat their failed arguments \n6  concerning Plaintiffs’ Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) claims.  \n7  Notwithstanding that this Court has issued two preliminary injunctions based on \n8  Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on these APA claims, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs \n9  have failed even to state a claim.  The Court need not consider and reject Defendants’ \n10  arguments for a third time, and it should summarily deny the motion. \n11    The remaining arguments Defendants raise simply need not be decided, and the \n12  Court should therefore deny the remainder of Defendants’ motion as well.  Defendants \n13  ask the Court to hold that Plaintiffs Arreola and Inland Empire-Immigrant Youth \n14  Collective (IEIYC) lack standing, yet Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs Gil and \n15  Moreira, whose DACA grants were terminated and whose work permits were \n16  canceled, have standing to sue.  Defendants’ standing arguments as to Mr. Arreola and \n17  IEIYC are not only meritless, they are wholly irrelevant: it is black letter law \n18  that “[t]he presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy Article III’s case-\n19  or-controversy requirement.”  Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, \n20  Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 53, n.2 (2006).  As a result, because Mr. Gil and Mr. Moreira \n21  indisputably have standing, the Court need not decide whether additional plaintiffs \n22  have standing. \n23    In any event, were the Court to reach the issue, it is clear that Mr. Arreola and \n24  IEIYC have standing.  Defendants do not dispute that Mr. Arreola had standing at the \n25  outset of the litigation—the relevant point in time for determining standing—and his \n26  claim is not moot just because Defendants’ unlawful actions have been preliminarily \n27  enjoined by this Court.  And IEIYC clearly has standing on behalf of its members, \n28  who are DACA recipients at risk of being subjected to Defendants’ illegal practices. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 7 of 21   Page ID #:2051\n1    Defendants’ repeated arguments that Plaintiffs have failed to state a procedural \n2  due process claim must also be rejected.  As Plaintiffs have explained, the Supreme \n3  Court has held that where the government seeks to revoke an important benefit—even \n4  if that benefit is ultimately a discretionary one—it must first provide a meaningful \n5  opportunity to be heard.  However, the Court need not resolve this constitutional \n6  question, since it has granted the preliminary relief the plaintiffs requested on other \n7  grounds and potentially may grant permanent relief on those other grounds as well.  \n8  As the Ninth Circuit has emphasized, “We do not decide federal constitutional \n9  questions where a dispositive nonconstitutional ground is available.”  Arizona \n10  DREAM Act Coalition v. Brewer, 855 F.3d 962, 970-71 (9th Cir. 2017) (citation and \n11  quotation marks omitted), cert denied, --- S.Ct. ----, 2018 WL 1369140 (March 19, \n12  2018).  See also id. at 963 (“Applying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, . . . we \n13  need not and should not come to rest on the [constitutional] issue, . . . so long as there \n14  is a viable alternate, nonconstitutional ground to reach the same result.”) (citation \n15  omitted).   \n16  Accordingly, the Court should deny the motion.  \n17  LEGAL STANDARD \n18  “For purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss for want of standing, both the \n19  trial and reviewing courts must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint \n20  and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.”  Maya v. Centex \n21  Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1068 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  \n22  Moreover, even “general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s \n23  conduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss [the Court] presum[es] that \n24  general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the \n25  claim.”  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  \n26    On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n27  12(b)(6), “[a]ll factual allegations in the complaint are accepted as true, and the \n28  pleadings construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Doe I v. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 8 of 21   Page ID #:2052\n1  Nestle USA, Inc., 766 F.3d 1013, 1018 (9th Cir. 2014) (citation and quotation marks \n2  omitted).1 \n3  ARGUMENT \n4  I.  MR. ARREOLA AND IEIYC HAVE STANDING. \n5  Because Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs Gil and Moreira have \n6  standing to sue, there is no need for the Court to consider Defendants’ standing \n7  arguments as to the remaining plaintiffs.  Where “one plaintiff ha[s] standing to bring \n8  the suit, the court need not consider the standing of the other plaintiffs.”  Laub v. U.S. \n9  Dept. of Int., 342 F.3d 1080, 1086 (9th Cir. 2003).  Defendants’ standing arguments \n10  can be summarily rejected on this basis alone, without prejudice to their ability to \n11  renew these arguments should they ever become relevant.  Should the Court reach the \n12  question, however, as shown below, it is clear that Mr. Arreola and IEIYC have \n13  standing to sue. \n14 \nA. Mr. Arreola Had Standing at the Commencement of the Litigation and \nHis Claims Are Not Moot. \n15 \nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed that standing is the “requisite \n16 \npersonal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation.”  Friends of \n17 \nthe Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) \n18 \n(citation and quotation marks omitted and emphasis added).  See also, e.g., White v. \n19 \nLee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1243 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Standing is examined at ‘the \n20 \ncommencement of the litigation.’”) (quoting Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189).  \n21 \nMr. Arreola had standing at the commencement of this litigation because the \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n1 Defendants’ motion, in arguing that Plaintiffs’ complaint should be dismissed \n24  for failure to state a claim, improperly attempts to rely on evidence that Defendants \nhave submitted into the record.  See, e.g., Mot. at 3, 22-23 (citing exhibits).  However, \n25 \nit is well established that a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim must be \n26  decided on the basis of the allegations in the complaint.  See, e.g., Lee v. City of Los \nAngeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[A] district court may not consider any \n27 \nmaterial beyond the pleadings in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.”) (citation and \n28  quotation marks omitted). \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 9 of 21   Page ID #:2053\n1  government terminated his DACA and Employment Authorization Document, causing \n2  him to lose his job and harming his ability to provide for his family.  See Compl., Dkt. \n3  1, at ¶¶ 76-83; Am. Compl., Dkt. 32, at ¶¶ 78-85.  Defendants apparently do not \n4  dispute that Mr. Arreola had standing at the outset, and that ends the inquiry. \n5  Attempting to avoid this simple point, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs, by \n6  amending Mr. Arreola’s complaint to add allegations concerning subsequent events \n7  and additional plaintiffs, somehow defeated Mr. Arreola’s original standing in the \n8  case.  But the fact that Mr. Arreola filed an amended complaint, which contains \n9  additional procedural history concerning the preliminary injunction and the \n10  government’s subsequent actions, does not change his undisputed injury at the outset \n11  of the litigation.  The fact that a plaintiff who had standing at the commencement of \n12  the case has amended his complaint to include additional allegations does not \n13  somehow negate his standing—which, as discussed, is determined at the outset.  See, \n14  e.g., McFalls v. Purdue, No. 16-2116, 2018 WL 785866, at *8 (D. Or. Feb. 8, 2018); \n15  N.W. Envtl. Def. Ctr. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, No. 3:10-01129, 2013 WL \n16  1294647, at *7 (D. Or. Mar. 27, 2013).   \n17  For example, in McFalls, the district court considered and rejected precisely the \n18  argument raised by Defendants here.  2018 WL 785866, at *8 (explaining that \n19  defendants “challenge Plaintiffs’ standing, based on the facts as they exist as of the \n20  filing of the Second Amended Complaint”).  The district court explained that “Article \n21  III standing is evaluated by considering the facts as they existed at the time of the \n22  commencement of the action.”  Id. (citing Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 180).  \n23  Accordingly, the court held that notwithstanding the filing of an amended complaint \n24  reflecting subsequent events, “Plaintiffs had standing at the time they commenced the \n25  action.”  Id. at *9.  The court concluded that the defendants’ arguments based on \n26  subsequent events alleged in the amended complaint were properly analyzed under \n27  mootness principles.  Id.  Accord N.W. Envtl. Def. Ctr., 2013 WL 1294647, at *7 \n28  (rejecting defendants’ argument that standing should be considered based on the facts \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 10 of 21   Page ID #:2054\n1  at the time of the amended complaint, and explaining the difference between standing \n2  and mootness).  In N.W. Envtl. Def. Ctr., the court specifically rejected the notion that \n3  the inclusion of additional allegations in an amended complaint could defeat standing \n4  that existed at the outset of the case.  2013 WL 1294647, at *7 (explaining that the \n5  “claim alleged in the Second Amended Complaint is nearly identical to that in the \n6  original Complaint except that it has been supplemented by an additional paragraph \n7  . . . . The addition of this paragraph does little, if anything, to change the contours of \n8  [the] claim and does not deprive this court of jurisdiction on the basis of standing”).2  \n9  See also Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91-92 (2013) (holding that where \n10  subsequent events occurred that “call[ed] into question the existence of any continuing \n11  case or controversy,” those events did not require a reappraisal of the parties’ standing \n12  but rather raised questions of mootness).3  The amended complaint in this case, far \n13  from withdrawing the allegations explaining Mr. Arreola’s original DACA \n14  termination, repeated them.  Compare Compl., Dkt. No. 1, at ¶¶ 43-83 with Am. \n15  Compl., Dkt. No. 32, at ¶¶ 45-85.  It therefore did nothing to alter Mr. Arreola’s \n16  standing.4   \n                                           \n17 \n2 Defendants invoke Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 473 \n18  (2007), which did not concern standing and is irrelevant here.  In any event, as that \nopinion explained, an amended complaint is only relevant for establishing jurisdiction \n19 \nto the extent that that complaint “withdraw[s] . . . allegations [supporting jurisdiction], \n20  unless they are replaced by others that establish jurisdiction.”  Id.   \n3 Where there were standing deficiencies in a plaintiff’s original complaint, of \n21 \ncourse, a court may look to an amended complaint to cure those deficiencies.  See, \n22  e.g., United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers, and Allied Trades No. 40 v. Ins. Corp. \nof Am., 919 F.2d 1398, 1402 (9th Cir. 1990).  Once a plaintiff has demonstrated \n23 \nstanding, either in an original or an amended complaint, the burden shifts to the \n24  defendant to show that a cause has become moot. \n4 For the same reasons, Mr. Arreola’s challenge to his unlawful DACA \n25 \ntermination remains ripe. See, e.g., Malama Makua v. Rumsfeld, 136 F. Supp. 2d \n26  1155, 1161 (D. Haw. 2001) (noting that ripeness “is measured at the time an action is \ninstituted; ripeness is not a moving target affected by a defendant’s action”).  Further, \n27 \nwith respect to the government’s stated intent to terminate Mr. Arreola’s DACA once \n28  again, “a plaintiff ‘does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 11 of 21   Page ID #:2055\n1  Since Mr. Arreola had standing at the outset of the litigation, the only \n2  conceivable question at this stage is whether his claim is moot.  See, e.g., Jackson v. \n3  California Dept. of Mental Health, 399 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005) (explaining \n4  that “mootness” involves the question “whether, after the case had been brought, \n5  something happened to cause [the plaintiff] to lose his continuing interest in the \n6  case”), amended on other grounds, 417 F.3d 1029 (9th Cir. 2005).  Defendants bear a \n7  “heavy burden” in establishing mootness, Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189, and \n8  have not remotely shouldered that burden here.  The factual developments on which \n9  the government relies—the reinstatement of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and the issuance of \n10  a Notice of Intent to Terminate—are the results of the government’s compliance with \n11  this Court’s preliminary injunction.  It is clear that compliance with a preliminary \n12  injunction does not moot a case; any other rule would systematically prevent courts \n13  from entering final judgments.  Thus, the Ninth Circuit has emphasized that “a \n14  government agency’s moratorium that ‘by its terms was not permanent’ would not \n15  moot ‘an otherwise valid claim for injunctive relief.’”  White, 227 F.3d at 1243 (9th \n16  Cir. 2000) (quoting Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 190).  See also, e.g., N.L.R.B. v. \n17  Raytheon Co., 398 U.S. 25, 27 (1970) (“We think it plain from the cases that the \n18  employer’s compliance with an order of the [National Labor Relations] Board does \n19  not render the cause moot.”); Rosemere Neighborhood Ass’n v. EPA, 581 F.3d 1169, \n20  1173 (9th Cir. 2009) (“[T]he mere cessation of illegal activity in response to pending \n21  litigation does not moot a case, unless the party alleging mootness can show that the \n22  ‘allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.’”) (quoting \n23  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189). \n24    The government must therefore show that, absent the preliminary injunction, it \n25  would not attempt to terminate Mr. Arreola’s DACA unlawfully.  First, without the \n26                                                                                                                                               \nobtain preventive relief.’”  Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1015 (9th Cir. \n27 \n2013) (quoting Babbitt v. United Farm Workers, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979) (internal \n28  quotation marks omitted)). \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 12 of 21   Page ID #:2056\n1  preliminary injunction, the government could again rescind Mr. Arreola’s DACA \n2  based merely on the earlier issuance of a Notice to Appear, providing no advance \n3  notice or opportunity to respond.  And second, despite this Court’s injunction, and far \n4  from showing that its wrongful behavior will not recur, the government has expressed \n5  its formal intent, with a Notice of Intent to Terminate, to repeat the harm that it \n6  originally caused Mr. Arreola, this time by terminating his DACA on the ground that \n7  he is an enforcement priority, Am. Compl., Dkt. 32, at ¶¶ 86-89—also an unlawful \n8  ground for termination described in the original complaint.  Compl., Dkt. 1, at ¶¶ 112, \n9  117.   \n10  Mr. Arreola’s standing was established at the outset of this case, and his claim \n11  is clearly not moot. \n12  B. IEIYC Has Standing on Behalf of Its Members.  \n13  IEIYC clearly has standing to sue on behalf of its members, who reasonably \n14  feared, at the outset of this litigation, that their DACA would be unlawfully terminated \n15  as a result of the policy that this Court has enjoined.  To establish standing on behalf \n16  of its members, IEIYC must show that “its members would have standing to sue on \n17  their own behalf, the interests at issue are germane to [its] mission, and neither the \n18  substantive claim nor the remedy sought necessitates the participation of any \n19  individual member of [IEIYC].”  Ocean Advocates v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \n20  402 F.3d 846, 861 (9th Cir. 2005).   \n21  IEIYC easily satisfies all three requirements. \n22  IEIYC’s members would themselves have standing because they plainly face \n23  imminent injury: this case is about a widespread practice of unlawful DACA \n24  terminations that the government has explicitly acknowledged and that IEIYC \n25  members may be subjected to at any time.  That injury is imminent because IEIYC \n26  members are DACA recipients and the government has an admitted policy of \n27  terminating DACA without notice or process, even where a recipient has not violated \n28  the program rules.  Indeed, for example, the government has “admitted that USCIS \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 13 of 21   Page ID #:2057\n1  has a practice of automatically terminating DACA based solely on the issuance of a \n2  Notice to Appear.”  Am. Compl., Dkt. 32, at ¶ 156 (emphasis added).  And if these \n3  unlawful practices were not enough, DHS officials have repeatedly made clear that \n4  they do not intend to exempt DACA recipients from their enforcement efforts.  For \n5  example, Defendant Homan has stated that “[i]f you’re in this country illegally, . . . \n6  [y]ou should look over your shoulder,” id. at ¶ 140, and an ICE spokeswoman has \n7  confirmed that “ICE does not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from \n8  enforcement,” id. at ¶ 141.  Indeed, the former Acting Secretary of DHS has even said \n9  that she is unaware of any guidance stating that DHS will not use DACA recipients’ \n10  confidential information to remove them.  Id. at ¶ 142.  See also, e.g., id. at ¶¶ 138-39 \n11  (similar statements from administration officials).  \n12  Those fears are all the more reasonable, and the members’ injuries all the more \n13  imminent, because IEIYC members are particularly likely to be subjected to USCIS’s \n14  policy of unlawful terminations.  There are multiple CBP sub-stations in Riverside \n15  County (in Murrieta, Temecula, and Indio), and multiple CBP checkpoints and roving \n16  patrols, id. at ¶ 135, as well as a new border patrol complex under construction in \n17  Moreno Valley, id.  IEIYC members therefore are forced to “live, work, attend school, \n18  and carry out IEIYC work” in an area with pervasive CBP presence.  Id.  That \n19  presence poses a direct threat to IEIYC members, since “[a] September 6, 2017 CBP \n20  memorandum directs that, after encountering a DACA recipient, immigration agents \n21  must run various systems checks to determine whether removal proceedings are \n22  appropriate,” id. at ¶ 144 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  The risk of being \n23  placed in removal proceedings is particularly high for IEIYC members who have had \n24  or will have contact with local law enforcement, id. at ¶ 136, since CBP officials may \n25  place DACA recipients whom they encounter in removal proceedings—even on the \n26  basis of an arrest, id. at ¶ 144.  And that risk is compounded by USCIS’s practice of \n27  automatically terminating DACA on the basis of the issuance of a Notice to Appear in \n28  removal proceedings.  Id. at ¶ 159.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 14 of 21   Page ID #:2058\n1  This evidence of a systematic practice is more than enough to support standing.  \n2  For example, in Valle del Sol Inc., 732 F.3d 1006, 1018 (9th Cir. 2013), the Ninth \n3  Circuit held—at the more demanding summary judgment stage—that two \n4  organizations faced imminent injury from an Arizona law prohibiting the \n5  transportation of undocumented immigrants in furtherance of their illegal presence.  \n6  The organizations alleged that they feared their staff would be prosecuted because \n7  they provide transportation to undocumented immigrants.  Id.  The court held that the \n8  organizations had standing, and IEIYC’s members have standing for the same reason: \n9  they reasonably fear that the government, absent an injunction, will continue its \n10  established practice by unlawfully terminating their DACA.  Similarly, in Hawai‘i v. \n11  Trump, 859 F.3d 741 (9th Cir. 2017), vacated, 138 S. Ct. 377 (2017), the Ninth \n12  Circuit held that family members of visa applicants “understandably and reasonably \n13  fear[ed]” that the President’s ban would prevent their reunification with family \n14  members, id. at 762, even though that ban allowed them to apply for waivers. \n15  Indeed, courts have held that similarly situated plaintiffs had standing to \n16  challenge policies even where the risk of enforcement was far lower than the risk here.  \n17  For example, in Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights (GLAHR) v. Gov. of \n18  Georgia, 691 F.3d 1250 (11th Cir. 2012), the plaintiffs challenged (among other \n19  things) a provision of state law that allowed officers to detain individuals for \n20  immigration purposes where the officer had probable cause to believe the individual \n21  had committed a crime.  The court held that an individual plaintiff with deferred \n22  action status faced an imminent injury because she lacked required immigration \n23  documentation—even though she never suggested that she would commit a crime or \n24  that an officer would have probable cause to arrest her on that basis.  Id. at 1258-60.  \n25  The injuries facing IEIYC members are far more imminent: the government asserts \n26  that it may terminate their DACA for any reason or no reason, and at any time, \n27  without notice or an opportunity to respond.  Like the plaintiff in GLAHR, who feared \n28  being stopped and detained by state officers, id.; the plaintiffs in Valle del Sol, who \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 15 of 21   Page ID #:2059\n1  feared their staff would be arrested and prosecuted for transporting undocumented \n2  immigrants, 732 F.3d at 1014-15; and the family members of visa applicants in \n3  Hawai‘i, 859 F.3d at 762, who feared that they would not be provided waivers from \n4  the travel ban and thereby be separated from their family; IEIYC members fear that \n5  their DACA will be terminated pursuant to the government’s conceded practices, and \n6  therefore have standing.   \n7  IEIYC also meets the second requirement for standing on behalf of its \n8  members: Defendants do not even dispute (nor could they) that the claims in this case \n9  are germane to IEIYC’s mission.   \n10  Finally, IEIYC meets the third requirement: its members would not be required \n11  to participate in this challenge.  Defendants suggest that IEIYC’s members would \n12  need to participate because determining whether an individual’s DACA has been \n13  unlawfully terminated requires a “very fact-specific inquiry.”  Mot. 6.  But this Court \n14  has already found that “this is not a case where rigorous, individualized inquiries are \n15  necessary.”  Class PI Order, Dkt. No. 61, at 20.  The fact that determinations of class \n16  membership might be necessary is not an obstacle to membership standing.  Indeed, in \n17  the very case on which Defendants rely, the Supreme Court held that a union had \n18  standing on behalf of its members to challenge a guideline interpretation that limited \n19  their access to benefits, even “though the unique facts of each [union] member’s claim \n20  will have to be considered by the proper state authorities before any member will be \n21  able to receive the benefits allegedly due him.”  Intl. Union, United Auto., Aerospace \n22  and Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 288 (1986). \n23  Finally, Defendants assert that IEIYC members lack standing because the harm \n24  they fear “would only occur if [they] first engage[] in unlawful behavior.”  Mot. 7.  \n25  That assumes away the central allegations in this case: that the government has a \n26  policy  of  unlawfully  terminating  DACA  for  individuals  who  lack  disqualifying \n27  criminal convictions.  See, e.g., Am. Compl., Dkt. 32, at ¶¶ 78-85 (describing the \n28  termination  of  Mr.  Arreola’s  DACA  despite  the  government’s  decision  never  to \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 16 of 21   Page ID #:2060\n1  charge him with any crime); id. at ¶ 150 (describing the DACA termination of Jessica \n2  Colotl, whose only conviction was for driving without a license—a conviction she had \n3  disclosed in each of her successful DACA applications).  The Ninth Circuit explained, \n4  in the case on which Defendants rely for this proposition, that “there is no tenable \n5  argument that plaintiff should avoid driving near the Mexican border in order to avoid \n6  another stop by the Border Police.”  Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, \n7  1041 (9th Cir. 1999).  Here, too, there is no tenable argument that IEIYC members \n8  should cease their daily routines to avoid the checkpoints that subject them to a risk of \n9  unlawful DACA termination. \n10 \nII.  THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT AND \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT DO NOT DEPRIVE THE \n11 \nCOURT OF JURISDICTION. \n12 \nThis Court has twice correctly determined that it has jurisdiction under the INA \n13 \nand the APA to enjoin the unlawful termination of individuals’ DACA and work \n14 \nauthorization.  See Arreola PI Order, Dkt. 31, at 4-8; Class PI Order, Dkt. 61, at 22-\n15 \n26; see also Arreola PI Reply, Dkt. 25, at 2-11.5  The same reasoning applies on this \n16 \nmotion to dismiss, in which Defendants’ argument is copied nearly verbatim from \n17 \ntheir opposition to the Plaintiffs’ motion for a classwide preliminary injunction.  \n18 \nCompare Class PI Opp., Dkt. 54, at 6-13, with Mot. at 8-15.  The Court need not once \n19 \nagain explain why these identical arguments are incorrect. \n20 \n  First, Defendants again suggest that review of USCIS’s failure to provide notice \n21 \nand process in terminating DACA is precluded by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  Yet that \n22 \nprovision insulates from review only a “‘decision or action’ to ‘commence \n23 \nproceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’”  Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-\n24 \nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 482 (1999) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g)).  \n25 \nDefendants again assert that “no reasonable argument can be made that the \n26 \n                                           \n27 \n5 Plaintiffs incorporate their previous jurisdictional arguments, see Arreola PI \n28  Reply, Dkt. 25, at 2-11, by reference here.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 17 of 21   Page ID #:2061\n1  terminations did not arise out of [the decision to initiate removal proceedings].”  Mot. \n2  at 4.  But as this Court twice explained, and multiple courts have agreed, class \n3  members are “challeng[ing] neither the issuance of NTAs nor the [government’s] \n4  decision to commence removal proceedings,” but instead “USCIS’s separate and \n5  independent decision to revoke [their] DACA on the basis of an NTA, which is \n6  independent of the limited category of decisions covered by § 1252(g).”  Class PI \n7  Order, Dkt. 61, at 24; see also Arreola PI Order, Dkt. 31, at 6; accord Arreola PI \n8  Reply at 2-6; Ramirez Medina v. DHS, No. 17-cv-0218, 2017 WL 5176720, at *6-7 \n9  (W.D. Wash. Nov. 8, 2017); Gonzalez Torres v. DHS, No. 17-cv-1840, 2017 WL \n10  4340385, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017); Colotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp. 3d 1328, \n11  1338-40 (N.D. Ga. 2017).  \n12  The Court was also correct to hold that in any event, § 1252(g) does not bar \n13  review of legal questions related to discretionary decisions, and that Plaintiffs’ claims \n14  are therefore reviewable on that basis.  Class PI Order, Dkt. 61, at 24-25; Arreola PI \n15  Order, Dkt. 31, at 6.  Defendants do not contest that such legal questions are \n16  reviewable, but instead mischaracterize Plaintiffs’ claims as seeking to require the \n17  agency to exercise its discretion not to terminate DACA.  Mot. at 15 n.9.  But as this \n18  Court found and Plaintiffs have explained, Plaintiffs seek review not of USCIS’s \n19  ultimate exercise of discretion to grant or deny DACA, but rather of the agency’s \n20  compliance with its own rules, the APA, and due process.  Compare id. with Class PI \n21  Order, Dkt. 61, at 25; Arreola PI Order, Dkt. 31, at 6; accord Arreola PI Reply, Dkt. \n22  25, at 1.   \n23    Second, Defendants once again repeat their suggestion that Plaintiffs’ claims \n24  are precluded by 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(b)(9) and 1252(a)(5), which require that challenges \n25  to removal orders be raised through a petition for review of a final removal order in \n26  the courts of appeal.  Yet Defendants fail even to acknowledge this Court’s \n27  observation that “[a]n immigration judge in a removal proceeding does not have the \n28  power to grant or deny deferred action, or to review or reverse an agency’s decision to \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 18 of 21   Page ID #:2062\n1  revoke it.”  Class PI Order, Dkt. 61, at 26; Arreola PI Order, Dkt. 31, at 7.  That fact \n2  alone is decisive because, in the government’s own words, “if the issue is one that can \n3  be raised in removal proceedings, and ultimately in a petition for review, then the \n4  statute precludes district court review.”  Mot. at 12 (emphasis added); accord Arreola \n5  PI Reply, Dkt. 25, at 7.  Because Plaintiffs are unable to challenge the termination of \n6  their DACA in removal proceedings, §§ 1252(b)(9) and 1252(a)(5) do not preclude \n7  them from raising their challenge in district court.  Accord Arreola PI Reply, Dkt. 25, \n8  at 6-8; Ramirez Medina, 2017 WL 5176720, at *8; Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL \n9  4340385, at *5; Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1339-40. \n10    Finally, Defendants argue once again that USCIS need not provide notice or \n11  process in terminating DACA because the decision is “committed to agency discretion \n12  by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); see also Mot. 13-15.  But again, Defendants simply \n13  ignore this Court’s prior decision and the controlling Ninth Circuit cases, which rely \n14  on the established proposition that review is available where “‘discretion has been \n15  legally circumscribed by various memoranda.’”  Class PI Order, Dkt. 61, at 23; \n16  Arreola PI Order, Dkt. 31, at 4 (quoting Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir. \n17  2004)); accord Arreola PI Reply, Dkt. 25, at 9-11; Ramirez Medina, 2017 WL \n18  5176720, at *8; Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1340-41.  As this Court correctly held, \n19  “[h]ere, the decision to revoke DACA is governed by both the Napolitano Memo and \n20  the DACA SOPs.”  Class PI Order, Dkt. 61, at 23; Arreola PI Order, Dkt. 31, at 4.  \n21  Review is therefore available under those authorities, the APA, and the Constitution. \n22 \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE STATED A CLAIM UNDER THE APA. \n23 \nDefendants repeat, verbatim, their arguments that USCIS may automatically \n24 \nterminate DACA on the basis of an NTA charging unlawful presence.  Compare Mot. \n25 \n19-23 with Class PI Opp., Dkt. 54, at 18-22.  This Court has already rejected precisely \n26 \nthe same arguments twice.  See Class PI Order, Dkt. 61, at 26-31; Arreola PI Order, \n27 \n28 \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 19 of 21   Page ID #:2063\n1  Dkt. 31, at 8-13.6  It should do so again here for the same reasons. \n2 \nIV.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE STATED A PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \nCLAIM. \n3 \nAs explained above, the Court need not reach Plaintiffs’ due process claim \n4 \nbecause it may grant permanent relief—and has already granted preliminary relief—\n5 \non the basis of Plaintiffs’ APA claims.  If the court does reach those claims, however, \n6 \nit should reject Defendants’ arguments, which fail to address Plaintiffs’ central \n7 \ncontentions.  That procedural due process argument is based on a controlling line of \n8 \ncases holding that, even absent a claim of entitlement to an important benefit, once it \n9 \nis conferred, recipients have a protected property interest that requires a fair process \n10 \nbefore the government may take that benefit away.  See Class PI Mot., Dkt. 40, at 17 \n11 \n(citing, inter alia, Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971)); see also Class PI Reply, \n12 \nDkt. 58, at 9-11; Arreola PI Mot., Dkt. 16-2, at 18-21; Arreola PI Reply, Dkt. 25, at \n13 \n19-21.7  Thus, even though DACA is ultimately discretionary, once granted, the \n14 \ngovernment cannot take it away without due process.  \n15 \nThe government makes no attempt to refute this principle. Instead, it cites cases \n16 \nholding that, as a general matter, discretionary benefits do not give rise to a protected \n17 \nproperty interest.  See Mot. 15-18 (citing cases).  But the Plaintiffs never make that \n18 \ncontention, and none of those cases involve the revocation of a discretionary benefit \n19 \nthat has already been conferred. \n20 \nThe government further argues that the DACA guidance does not give rise to a \n21 \nprotected property interest, see Mot. 16-18, but again this argument is a straw man.  \n22 \nThe Plaintiffs do not argue that the DACA program itself establishes a protected \n23 \ninterest.  Instead, they argue only that, having previously granted them DACA, the \n24 \n25 \n                                           \n26  6 Plaintiffs incorporate by reference their previous arguments with respect to the \nAPA claims.  See Class PI Mot., Dkt. 40, at  8-16; Class PI Reply, Dkt. 58, at 4-9. \n27 \n7 Plaintiffs incorporate the procedural due process arguments made in prior \n28  filings by reference here. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 20 of 21   Page ID #:2064\n1  government may not strip them of it without a fair procedure.  Class PI Mot., Dkt. 40, \n2  at 16-19.  Defendants’ remaining arguments likewise miss the mark.  The Plaintiffs do \n3  not premise their claim on a substantive “right to work in the United States,” nor have \n4  they alleged a “right to DACA.”  Mot. at 16-17.8 \n5  Finally, Defendants do not even attempt to suggest that their actions satisfy due \n6  process.  Indeed, they could not since—as they concede, see Class PI Opp., Dkt. 54, at \n7  2-3—their policy allows them to strip Plaintiffs of DACA without any process \n8  whatsoever.  This is especially true given that USCIS already provides a procedure \n9  whereby DACA recipients are afforded a reasoned explanation for its actions and an \n10  opportunity to present arguments and evidence.  See Class PI Mot., Dkt. 40, at 19.  In \n11  sum, the termination of Plaintiffs’ DACA and EADs in the absence of a fair process \n12  violates their procedural due process rights. \n13  CONCLUSION \n14  For these reasons, the Court should summarily deny the motion to dismiss. \n \n15  Dated: March 26, 2018 \nRespectfully submitted, \n16     \n/s/ David Hausman  \n17   \nDavid Hausman \n18    Jennifer Chang Newell \n                                           \n19 \n8 Defendants also half-heartedly attempt to suggest, again and incorrectly, that a \n20  federal regulation provides for automatic termination of a DACA EAD when an NTA \nis filed with the immigration court.  Mot. 17 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii)).)).  \n21 \nThis Court has already rejected that argument twice.  Class PI Order, Dkt. 61, at 31 \n22  n.13; Arreola PI Order, Dkt. 31, at 11 n.2.  Although the cited regulation provides for \ntermination in some cases, it also contains a specific exception stating that “this shall \n23 \nnot preclude the authorization of employment pursuant to § 274a.12(c) of this part \n24  where appropriate.”  8 C.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii)) (emphasis added).  See Alfaro-\nOrellana v. Ilchert, 720 F. Supp. 792, 794 (N.D. Cal. 1989)1989) (recognizing that 8 \n25 \nC.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii)) “creates an exception for appropriate work authorizations \n26  under § 274a.12(c)).”).  In any event, the Supreme Court has held that the government \n“may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of [a property] interest, once \n27 \nconferred, without appropriate procedural safeguards.”  Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. \n28  Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541-42 (1985).). \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 73   Filed 03/26/18   Page 21 of 21   Page ID #:2065\nKatrina L.

USCIS \n9  has abruptly revoked these young immigrants’ valid DACA and work authorization \n10  even though they remain eligible for the program.  Losing the protection of DACA \n11  and, with it, the ability to work and plan for the future, is devastating to these young \n12  immigrants who have called the United States home since they were children.   \n13  Mr. Gil is a 24-year-old who has lived in the United States for more than 19 \n14  years.  USCIS found him eligible for and granted him DACA in both 2015 and 2017.  \n15  His DACA allowed him to work as a bakery manager and for a logistics company, and \n16  he used his earnings to help support his five younger U.S. citizen siblings.  Mr. Gil \n17  was also able to get a driver’s license, which allowed him to drive to work and church, \n18  and to give his siblings rides to school.  However, USCIS suddenly revoked Mr. Gil’s \n19  DACA and work authorization in November 2017—just three months after USCIS \n20  renewed it—without providing him with a reasoned explanation or a process to \n21  challenge the revocation.   \n22  Mr. Moreira is also 24 years old and has lived in the United States since he was \n23  a child.  In high school, Mr. Moreira was active in school sports and other activities \n24  and received various certificates of achievement for his academic performance.  After \n25  Mr. Moreira graduated, USCIS granted him DACA, which allowed him to secure a \n26  good job with a flooring company, where he excelled and was quickly promoted from \n27  an assistant manager to a manager position.  USCIS granted Mr. Moreira DACA twice \n28 \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 8 of 29   Page ID #:781\n1  more—most recently in November 2017—just days before USCIS abruptly \n2  terminated it.1  \n3  Plaintiffs are not alone.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ counsel are aware of at least 17 \n4  DACA recipients across the country who have had their DACA and work permits \n5  terminated without notice or process since January 2017, even though they still \n6  qualify for the program.  Declaration of Katrina L. Eiland (“Eiland Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-14.  \n7  Hundreds of thousands more DACA recipients nationwide are at risk of having their \n8  DACA terminated pursuant to Defendants’ unlawful policies and practices.  Id. ¶ 48, \n9  Ex. 33.  \n10  Indeed, Defendants have conceded in this lawsuit that USCIS engages in a \n11  practice of terminating DACA without notice or an opportunity to respond, including \n12  by automatically terminating DACA based on the issuance of a Notice to Appear \n13  (“NTA”) in immigration court, without regard to whether the recipient remains \n14  eligible for the program.  See Doc No. 23-2, Declaration of Ron Thomas (“Thomas \n15  Decl.”) ¶ 4.  Defendants also have conceded that this practice is widespread.  In fact, \n16  Defendants have represented that the number of individuals subjected to its practice is \n17  such that identifying “all automatic terminations of DACA would . . . involve a \n18  manual review of hundreds of cases.”  Id. ¶ 5 (emphasis added).   \n19  However, as this Court and others have ruled, USCIS’s admitted practice of \n20  terminating DACA without notice or process violates the agency’s own rules and is, \n21  therefore, arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law under the Administrative \n22  Procedure Act (“APA”).  As described in Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Classwide \n23  Preliminary Injunction, filed this same date, Defendants’ termination practice is also \n24  arbitrary and capricious because it fails to provide good reasons for changing course \n25  with respect to the agency’s determination that the individual merits DACA, and is \n26  based on arbitrary, irrelevant factors.  Terminating DACA without notice and an \n                                           \n27  1   The termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA is described in detail in Plaintiff \nArreola’s Memorandum of Law in Support of his Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.  \n28  See Doc. No. 16-2 at 5-10.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 9 of 29   Page ID #:782\n1  opportunity to be heard also violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n2  to the U.S. Constitution.   \n3  A class action lawsuit is appropriate to challenge Defendants’ unlawful policies \n4  and practices.  Plaintiffs seek to certify the following nationwide Notice Class under \n5  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2): \n6  All recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) \n7  who, after January 19, 2017, have had or will have their DACA grant \n8  and employment authorization revoked without notice or an \n9  opportunity to respond, even though they have not been convicted of a \n10  disqualifying criminal offense.2 \n11  The proposed class readily satisfies the requirements of numerosity, \n12  commonality, typicality, and adequacy in Rule 23(a) and is readily ascertainable.  The \n13  proposed class includes at least 17 and likely many more individuals whose DACA \n14  already has been unlawfully terminated, which is sufficient to satisfy numerosity.  See, \n15  e.g., Ark. Educ. Ass’n v. Board Of Educ. of Portland, Ark. Sch. Dist., 446 F.2d 763, \n16  765-66 (8th Cir. 1971) (class of 17 sufficient); Hum v. Dericks, 162 F.R.D. 628, 634 \n17  (D. Haw. 1995) (noting that courts have certified classes with as few as 13 members).  \n18  The class raises numerous common legal questions that generate common answers: \n19  namely, whether Defendants’ challenged policies and practices violate the APA and \n20  the Due Process Clause.  The class also raises common factual issues because \n21  Plaintiffs and class members are subject to the same policies and practices.  Plaintiffs’ \n22  APA and Due Process Clause claims are typical of those whom they seek to \n23  represent—that is, other DACA recipients who have or will have their DACA and \n24  work authorization terminated without notice or process pursuant to Defendants’ \n25  unlawful policies and practices, despite having no disqualifying convictions.  And as \n26  to adequacy, a team of seasoned attorneys from the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project \n27                                             \n2 This motion does not address the proposed “Enforcement Priority” Class pled in \n28  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, filed this same date.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 10 of 29   Page ID\n #:783\n1  and the ACLU of Southern California, with significant experience in immigrants’ \n2  rights and class action cases, represents Plaintiffs. \n3  Plaintiffs’ proposed class likewise satisfies Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendants \n4  have “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \n5  injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class \n6  as a whole.”  Because the government has a policy or practice of terminating DACA \n7  without notice, process, or a reasoned explanation, including based solely on the \n8  issuance of an NTA, even where a DACA recipient has never engaged in any \n9  disqualifying conduct, Defendants have necessarily acted in the same way as to all \n10  class members.  Injunctive and declaratory relief to stop Defendants’ unlawful \n11  practices is therefore appropriate with respect to the class as a whole.   \n12  Accordingly, this Court should grant class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) for \n13  purposes of entering Plaintiffs’ requested classwide preliminary injunction.3  See \n14  Carrillo v. Schneider Logistics, Inc., No. 11-cv-8557CAS-DTBX, 2012 WL 556309, \n15  at *9 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 31, 2012) (“courts routinely grant provisional class certification \n16  for purposes of entering [preliminary] injunctive relief” under Rule 23(b)(2), where \n17  the plaintiff establishes that the four prerequisites in Rule 23(a) are also met) (citing \n18  Baharona-Gomez v. Reno, 167 F.3d 1228, 1233 (9th Cir. 1999)). \n19  BACKGROUND \n20  The DACA Program4 \n21  Under DACA, young immigrants who entered the United States as children \n22  who meet specified educational and residency requirements, and who pass extensive \n23  criminal background checks, are eligible to receive deferred action.  Doc. No. 16-4, \n24  Declaration of Dae Keun Kwon (“Kwon Decl.”) ¶ 10, Ex. 9 (“Napolitano Memo” at \n25                                             \n3   Plaintiffs also request that they be appointed Class Representatives, and that \n26  undersigned counsel be appointed Class Counsel.  \n4   Additional background about the DACA program is provided in Plaintiffs’ \n27  Amended Complaint, filed concurrently with this Motion, and Plaintiff Arreola’s \nMemorandum of Law in support of his Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Doc No. \n28  16-2. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 11 of 29   Page ID\n #:784\n1  1-2).  The enumerated eligibility criteria include the requirements that DACA \n2  recipients not have been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor,5 or three or \n3  more other misdemeanors.  Napolitano Memo at 1.   \n4  USCIS is the agency charged with making DACA determinations.  Id. at 2-3.  \n5  The DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) set forth the uniform procedures \n6  that the agency must follow in adjudicating all DACA applications, as well as in \n7  terminating DACA and EADs granted through the program.  See Doc No. 31, Order \n8  Granting Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (“PI Order”) at 2; Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 at 16 \n9  (“This SOP is applicable to all Service Center personnel performing adjudicative and \n10  clerical functions or review of those functions.  Personnel outside of Service Centers \n11  performing duties related to DACA processing will be similarly bound by the \n12  provisions of this SOP.”); id. (“This SOP describes the procedures Service Centers are \n13  to follow when adjudicating DACA requests.”); see also Colotl v. Kelly, No. 17-cv-\n14  1670-MHC, 2017 WL 2889681, at *4 (N.D. Ga. June 12, 2017); Gonzalez Torres v. \n15  U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 17-cv-1840 JM(NLS), 2017 WL 4340385, at *3 \n16  (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017).   \n17  On September 5, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) \n18  announced that it was winding down the DACA program.  Although the program is \n19  ending, DHS officials have confirmed that the same program rules continue to apply \n20  until it ends.  PI Order at 1-2. \n21  Defendants’ Unlawful DACA Revocation Policies and Practices \n22  Despite President Trump’s assurances that DACA recipients “have nothing to \n23  worry about”6 and despite the critically important interests at stake once an individual \n24  has received a grant of DACA, Defendants have engaged in a policy and practice of \n                                           \n25  5 Significant misdemeanors are convictions for domestic violence; sexual abuse or \nexploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or \n26  trafficking; and, driving under the influence; and any offense for which an individual \nwas sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days.  Kwon Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. 19 at \n27  20. \n6 Eiland Decl. ¶ 30, Ex. 15 (@realDonaldTrump, TWITTER (Sept. 7, 2017, 6:42 \n28  AM), https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/905788459301908480). \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 12 of 29   Page ID\n #:785\n1  unlawfully revoking individuals’ DACA and work permits without notice, a reasoned \n2  explanation, or an opportunity to respond, even though these individuals remain \n3  eligible for the program.   \n4  Defendants’ unlawful termination of qualified individuals’ DACA and work \n5  authorization involves at least two systemic policies and practices: \n6  First, Defendants have a practice of revoking DACA without providing notice, \n7  a reasoned explanation, an opportunity to be heard prior to revocation, or a process for \n8  reinstatement where the revocation is in error.  Defendants’ have engaged in this \n9  practice despite the fact that USCIS’s own SOPs governing the DACA program do \n10  not allow for termination without notice in the vast majority of cases, including in \n11  Plaintiffs’ and the proposed class members.  See, e.g., Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL \n12  4340385, at *3 (“In short, except in EPS cases [i.e., certain cases involving an \n13  egregious risk to public safety], the DACA SOP requires notice and an ability to \n14  contest the [Notice of Intent to Terminate] before DACA status may be terminated.”). \n15  Second, USCIS has a practice of automatically terminating DACA and work \n16  permits based on the issuance of an NTA where the sole basis for the NTA is the \n17  individual’s lack of immigration status in the United States.  Defendants themselves \n18  have asserted in this litigation that USCIS has a “consistent practice” of automatically \n19  terminating DACA “with the issuance of NTAs.”  Doc No. 23, Defs.’ Opp. to PI at \n20  26; see also Thomas Decl. ¶ 4 (“The issuance of a Notice to Appear (NTA) by U.S. \n21  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n22  (CBP) automatically terminates DACA. . . . This has been USCIS’ practice since FY \n23  2013 when such terminations began.”).  As this Court has observed, however, all \n24  DACA recipients could be charged with unlawful presence, and DACA is available to \n25  noncitizens who are in removal proceedings.  PI Order at 9.   \n26  Plaintiffs and Proposed Class Members  \n27  The termination of Plaintiffs’ DACA and work authorization illustrates \n28  Defendants’ unlawful policies and practices.  Mr. Gil, who has lived in the United \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 13 of 29   Page ID\n #:786\n1  States since he was five years old, was working for a logistics company in Minnesota \n2  and helping to support his five U.S. citizen siblings when USCIS revoked his DACA \n3  and work authorization.  Declaration of José Eduardo Gil Robles (“Gil Decl.”) ¶¶ 1-2, \n4  11-12.  Mr. Gil was arrested in September 2017 and ultimately charged with a \n5  misdemeanor for driving on a cancelled license, which is still pending.7  Id. ¶ 14.  Mr. \n6  Gil was not aware of any problem with his driver’s license, which was allegedly \n7  cancelled because it required a “status check” when his previous grant of DACA \n8  expired a few weeks before.  Id.  Mr. Gil was released on bond and went back to his \n9  work and family.  Id. ¶ 15.  However, a month later, ICE appeared at his job, arrested \n10  him, and took him to an immigration detention facility.  Id.  ICE subsequently issued \n11  him an NTA charging him with being present without admission.  Id.  Mr. Gil was \n12  released on bond after an immigration judge found that he was not a danger to the \n13  community or a flight risk.  Id. ¶¶ 18-20.  However, while he was in detention, Mr. Gil \n14  received a notice from USCIS terminating his renewed DACA based on ICE’s \n15  issuance of an NTA.  Id. ¶¶ 22-23, 30, Ex. B.  He received no notice or explanation \n16  beyond the single sentence in the notice, and he had no chance to respond.  Id. ¶ 23. \n17  Similarly, Mr. Moreira has lived in the United States since middle school, after \n18  entering on a visitor’s visa.  Declaration of Ronan Carlos De Souza Moreira (“Moreira \n19  Decl.”) ¶ 1.  His mother is a Legal Permanent Resident and his older brother, who is \n20  expecting a child, is a U.S. citizen.  Id. ¶ 5.  During middle school and high school, \n21  Mr. Moreira played soccer and tennis, participated in school clubs, and earned \n22  certificates of achievement for his academic performance and attendance.  Id. ¶ 2.  \n23  After graduating from high school and getting DACA, Mr. Moreira secured a good \n24  job with a flooring company in Georgia, working his way up to a job managing 20 \n25  flooring installers.  Id. ¶¶ 2, 9.  On November 2, 2017, Mr. Moreira was arrested after \n26  a police officer concluded that the expiration date on his license had been changed.  \n27                                             \n7 Such traffic violations do not even count as a misdemeanor that could disqualify an \n28  individual from DACA.  See Kwon Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. 19 at 20. \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 14 of 29   Page ID\n #:787\n1  He was ultimately charged with a misdemeanor for possession of an altered \n2  identification document, but has not been convicted.  Id. ¶¶ 12-14.  Although Mr. \n3  Moreira was quickly granted bail, ICE detained him and issued him an NTA charging \n4  him with overstaying a visa.  Id. ¶ 14.  Mr. Moreira was released from immigration \n5  detention after about a month.  When he appeared for a bond hearing, the lawyer for \n6  the government conceded that he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the \n7  community, and offered him a bond, which he accepted.  Id. ¶ 16.  However, like Mr. \n8  Gil, Mr. Moreira received a notice from USCIS terminating his DACA based on \n9  ICE’s issuance of an NTA.  Id. ¶¶ 18, 26, Ex. B.  Mr. Moreira also did not receive any \n10  notice or explanation beyond the single sentence in the notice, and he had no chance \n11  to respond.  Id. ¶ 19. \n12  Plaintiffs’ experiences are representative of DACA terminations nationally.  \n13  According to government statistics, DACA revocations increased by 25 percent in the \n14  first three months after President Trump’s inauguration in January 2017.8  Plaintiffs’ \n15  counsel are aware of at least 17 individuals around the country who, in the last ten \n16  months alone, have had their DACA and work authorization terminated without \n17  notice, a reasoned explanation, or an opportunity to respond, even though they \n18  continue to be eligible for DACA.  Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 2-14.  Given that there are \n19  currently nearly 700,000 DACA recipients across the country, id. ¶ 48, Ex. 33, there \n20  are likely at least dozens—if not many more—in the same situation whose stories \n21  have not reached Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Moreover, hundreds of thousands of individuals \n22  nationwide are at risk of having their DACA and work authorization terminated \n23  pursuant to Defendants’ unlawful policies and practices in the future as the program \n24  winds down over the next two years.  In fact, Plaintiffs’ counsel are aware of two \n25  additional DACA recipients to whom ICE recently issued NTAs despite their \n26  continued DACA eligibility, and who are at risk of receiving DACA termination \n                                           \n27  8 Eiland Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. 5 (Keegan Hamilton, Targeting Dreamers, VICE News, Sept. \n8, 2017, https://news.vice.com/story/ice-was-going-after-dreamers-even-before-\n28  trump-killed-daca). \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 15 of 29   Page ID\n #:788\n1  letters from USCIS.  Id. ¶ 15.  In at least one of those cases, counsel for ICE has \n2  already represented that the individual’s DACA has been terminated.  Id. \n3  Moreover, federal immigration authorities have been instructed to screen every \n4  DACA recipient they encounter.  Id. ¶¶ 21-23, Exs. 6-8.  Just recently, in early \n5  September, ten DACA recipients were detained for hours by Customs and Border \n6  Patrol (“CBP”) agents in Texas even though they have valid DACA.  Id. ¶ 23, Ex. 8.  \n7  Although they were ultimately released, CBP scrutinized their records, presumably \n8  looking for a reason to hold them and revoke their DACA status.  Id.  This targeting of \n9  DACA recipients is likely to result in additional unlawful terminations. \n10  Moreover, Defendants’ actions demonstrate that they have been targeting \n11  DACA recipients for revocation even though they have committed no disqualifying \n12  conduct and remain eligible for the program.  On February 20, 2017, former DHS \n13  Secretary John Kelly issued a memorandum setting forth enforcement priorities that \n14  DHS would follow in its enforcement of the immigration laws (hereinafter, the “Kelly \n15  Memo”).9  The Kelly Memo states that, “[e]ffective immediately, . . . Department \n16  personnel shall faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States against all \n17  removable aliens.”  The memorandum provides that even noncitizens who have no \n18  criminal convictions, but merely have been “charged with any criminal offense that \n19  has not been resolved,” as well as any noncitizen who has “committed acts which \n20  constitute a chargeable criminal offense” will be prioritized for removal from the \n21  United States.  USCIS has revoked DACA grants of individuals who do not have \n22  criminal history disqualifying them from DACA under the carefully crafted DACA \n23  Memo and SOPs, but who have had minor encounters with law enforcement that \n24  could make them a priority under the Kelly Memo’s general expanded enforcement \n25  priorities.  See, e.g., Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *7 (N.D. Ga. June 12, 2017). \n26                                             \n9 Eiland Decl. ¶ 18, Ex. 3 (Memorandum from John Kelly, Enforcement of the \n27  Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest 2 (Feb. 20, 2017), available at \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Enforcement-of-the-\n28  Immigration-Laws-to-Serve-the-National-Interest.pdf). \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 16 of 29   Page ID\n #:789\n1  The Kelly Memo and related DHS guidance, however, expressly exempt the \n2  DACA program from the Kelly Memo’s expanded priorities.  See Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 17-\n3  17, Exs. 2-3; see also Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *7-8, *12 (finding that “the Kelly \n4  Memo, by its own terms, has no application to the DACA program”).  Indeed, the \n5  Kelly Memo directly conflicts with the DACA Memo and SOPs, which define those \n6  eligible for DACA as low enforcement priorities and provide the relevant rules for \n7  termination of DACA.  See Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 at 18, 136-38.  Even so, USCIS \n8  has targeted for revocation individuals who remain eligible for DACA, thus further \n9  reinforcing that numerous DACA recipients are at risk of unlawful termination in the \n10  future.  \n11  ARGUMENT \n12  A  plaintiff  whose  suit  meets  the  requirements  of  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \n13  Procedure 23 has a “categorical” right “to pursue his claim as a class action.”  Shady \n14  Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 398 (2010).  To \n15  meet these requirements, the “suit must satisfy the criteria set forth in [Rule 23(a)] \n16  (i.e., numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also \n17  must fit into one of the three categories described in subdivision (b).”  Id. \n18  As set forth below, Plaintiffs’ proposed class satisfies all four of the Rule 23(a) \n19  prerequisites, as well as the judicially implied requirement of ascertainability.  The \n20  proposed class likewise meets the requirements for certification under Rule 23(b)(2).   \n21  This Court should certify the proposed class in keeping with the numerous court \n22  decisions certifying classes in similar actions challenging the federal government’s \n23  administration of immigration programs.  See, e.g., Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032 \n24  (9th Cir. 1998) (affirming certification of nationwide class of individuals challenging \n25  adequacy  of  notice  in  document  fraud  cases);  Arnott  v.  U.S.  Citizenship  & \n26  Immigration Servs., 290 F.R.D. 579 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (certifying nationwide class of \n27  immigrant  investors  challenging  USCIS’  retroactive  application  of  new  rules \n28  governing approval petitions to remove permanent residency conditions); Santillan v. \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 17 of 29   Page ID\n #:790\n1  Ashcroft,  No.  04-cv-2686MHP,  2004  WL  2297990  (N.D.  Cal.  Oct.  12,  2004) \n2  (certifying  nationwide  class  of  lawful  permanent  residents  challenging  delays  in \n3  receiving  documentation  of  their  status);  Wagafe  v.  Trump,  No.  17-cv-0094-RAJ, \n4  2017 WL 2671254, at *1 (W.D. Wash. June 21, 2017) (certifying nationwide class of \n5  naturalization applicants challenging national security screening procedures); Mendez \n6  Rojas,  et  al.  v.  Johnson,  No.  16-cv-1024-RSM,  (W.D.  Wash.  Jan.  10,  2017) \n7  (certifying two nationwide classes of asylum seekers challenging defective asylum \n8  application procedures).   \n9  I.  The Proposed Class Satisfies Rule 23(a)’s Requirements. \n10  A. Numerosity: The Proposed Class Consists of at Least Seventeen and \nLikely Many More DACA Recipients. \n11 \nRule 23(a)(1) requires that a class be “so numerous that joinder of all members \n12 \nis  impracticable.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a)(1).    “‘[I]mpracticability’  does  not  mean \n13 \n‘impossibility,’ but only the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the \n14 \nclass.”  Franco-Gonzales v. Napolitano, No. 10-cv-02211-DMG-DTBX, 2011 WL \n15 \n11705815, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011) (quoting Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine \n16 \nEstates, Inc., 329 F. 2d 909, 913-14 (9th Cir. 1964)).  No fixed number of class \n17 \nmembers is required.  Perez-Funez v. Dist. Dir., I.N.S., 611 F. Supp. 990, 995 (C.D. \n18 \nCal. 1984).  Moreover, where a plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, the \n19 \n“requirement is relaxed and plaintiffs may rely on [] reasonable inference[s] arising \n20 \nfrom plaintiffs’ other evidence that the number of unknown and future members of \n21 \n[the] proposed subclass . . . is sufficient to make joinder impracticable.”  Arnott v. U.S. \n22 \nCitizenship & Immigration Servs., 290 F.R.D. 579, 586 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (quoting \n23 \nSueoka v. United States, 101 Fed. App’x 649, 653 (9th Cir. 2004)).   \n24 \nHere, the number of class members far exceeds the requirement for numerosity.  \n25 \nFirst, Plaintiffs’ counsel is aware of at least 17 DACA recipients who, in the last ten \n26 \nmonths alone, have had their DACA terminated without notice or process, despite \n27 \nremaining eligible for the program.  Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 2-14.  Given the increasing \n28 \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 18 of 29   Page ID\n #:791\n1  number of DACA revocations nationwide in 2017, see id. ¶ 20, Ex. 5, the targeting of \n2  DACA recipients by federal immigration authorities, and the overall scale of the \n3  program, with hundreds of thousands of current DACA recipients, id. ¶ 48, Ex. 33, \n4  there are likely at least dozens—if not many more—who have already had their \n5  DACA terminated pursuant to Defendants’ challenged practices.  Indeed, Defendants \n6  have submitted a declaration in the instant litigation representing that the number of \n7  DACA recipients subjected to terminations without process is such that identifying \n8  “all automatic terminations of DACA would . . . involve a manual review of hundreds \n9  of cases.”  Thomas Decl. ¶ 5 (emphasis added).  The Court can thus reasonably \n10  conclude that the proposed class is sufficiently numerous.  See Cervantez v. Celestica \n11  Corp., 253 F.R.D. 562, 569 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citations \n12  omitted) (noting that “where the exact size of the class is unknown but general \n13  knowledge and common sense indicate that it is large, the numerosity requirement is \n14  satisfied”); see also, e.g., Hum, 162 F.R.D. at 634 (courts have certified classes with \n15  as few as 13 members); Ark. Educ. Ass’n, 446 F.2d at 765-66 (class of 17 sufficient); \n16  Jordan v. Los Angeles Cty., 669 F.2d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. 1982) (class of 39 \n17  sufficient), vacated on other grounds, 459 U.S. 810 (1982). \n18  Second, in addition to the number of individuals who have already had their \n19  DACA unlawfully terminated, Plaintiffs’ proposed class also includes individuals who \n20  will have their DACA terminated without notice or process, despite continuing to be \n21  eligible, if Defendants’ policies and practices are not enjoined.  Hundreds of \n22  thousands of DACA recipients are at risk of losing their deferred action if Defendants’ \n23  challenged practices are permitted to continue while the DACA program winds down \n24  over the next two years.  Indeed, Defendants themselves have conceded that USCIS \n25  engages in a practice of automatically terminating DACA without notice or process, \n26  based solely on the issuance of an NTA, without regard to whether the individual \n27  remains eligible for DACA.  See Thomas Decl. ¶ 4.  Immigration authorities’ \n28  increased screening of DACA recipients, as well as the large number of already-\n12 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 19 of 29   Page ID\n #:792\n1  identified class members, further supports the inference that there will be additional \n2  class members in the future.   \n3  The presence of such future class members renders joinder inherently \n4  impractical, thereby satisfying the purpose behind the numerosity requirement.  See, \n5  e.g, Ali v. Ashcroft, 213 F.R.D. 390, 408 (W.D. Wash. 2003), aff’d, 346 F.3d 873 (9th \n6  Cir. 2003), vacated on other grounds, 421 F.3d 795 (9th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation \n7  marks and citation omitted) (“[W]here the class includes unnamed, unknown future \n8  members, joinder of such unknown individuals is impracticable and the numerosity \n9  requirement is therefore met, regardless of class size.” (quoting Natl. Assn. of \n10  Radiation Survivors v. Walters, 111 F.R.D. 595, 599 (N.D. Cal. 1986)); Smith v. \n11  Heckler, 595 F. Supp. 1173, 1186 (E.D. Cal. 1984) (in injunctive relief cases, \n12  “[j]oinder in the class of persons who may be injured in the future has been held \n13  impracticable without regard to the number of persons already injured”); Hawker v. \n14  Consovoy, 198 F.R.D. 619, 625 (D.N.J. 2001) (“The joinder of potential future class \n15  members who share a common characteristic, but whose identity cannot be \n16  determined yet is considered impracticable.”). \n17  B. The Class Presents Common Questions of Law and Fact. \n18  To satisfy commonality, Plaintiffs must show that “there are questions of law or \n19  fact common to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality \n20  requirement “has been construed permissively.”  Preap v. Johnson, 303 F.R.D. 566, \n21  585 (N.D. Cal. 2014), aff’d, 831 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Hanlon v. \n22  Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998)) (internal quotation marks \n23  omitted).  A plaintiff “need not show . . . that every question in the case, or even a \n24  preponderance of questions, is capable of class wide resolution.”  Parsons v.Ryan, 754 \n25  F.3d 657, 675 (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Rather, \n26  even one shared legal issue can be sufficient.  See, e.g., Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor \n27  Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 589 (9th Cir. 2012) (noting that “commonality only requires a \n28  single significant question of law or fact”); Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046 (“What makes \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 20 of 29   Page ID\n #:793\n1  the plaintiffs’ claims suitable for a class action is the common allegation that the \n2  INS’s procedures provide insufficient notice.”); Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, \n3  1122 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he commonality requirement[] asks us to look only for \n4  some shared legal issue or a common core of facts.”).  Moreover, “[i]ndividual \n5  variation among plaintiffs’ questions of law and fact does not defeat underlying legal \n6  commonality, because ‘the existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual \n7  predicates is sufficient’ to satisfy Rule 23.”  Santillan v. Ashcroft, No. C 04-2686 \n8  MHP, 2004 WL 2297990, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 12, 2004) (quoting Hanlon, 150 F.3d \n9  at 1019).  The commonality standard is even more liberal in a civil rights suit like this \n10  one, in which “the lawsuit challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all \n11  of the putative class members.”  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. \n12  2001), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 504-05 \n13  (2005).  \n14  Here, Plaintiffs’ lawsuit raises numerous legal questions common to the \n15  proposed class,10 including: \n16  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA and work authorization \n17  without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to be heard violates \n18  Defendants’ own rules for the DACA program and is therefore arbitrary and \n19  capricious under the APA; \n20  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of revoking an existing grant of DACA and work \n21  authorization without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to be \n22  heard is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA \n23  because it fails to provide a good reason for the agency’s change in position;  \n24  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA and work authorization \n25  without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to be heard violates \n26  the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution; and \n27                                             \n10   Plaintiffs’ claims are described in greater detail in their Motion for a Classwide \n28  Preliminary Injunction, filed this same date. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 21 of 29   Page ID\n #:794\n1  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA and work authorization \n2  based solely on the issuance of an NTA charging the individual with unlawful \n3  presence in the United States, is arbitrary and capricious under the APA \n4  because it is based on arbitrary, irrelevant factors.   \n5  Any one of these common issues, standing alone, is enough to satisfy Rule \n6  23(a)(2)’s permissive standard.  See Perez-Olano v. Gonzalez, 248 F.R.D. 248, 257 \n7  (C.D. Cal. 2008) (“Courts have found that a single common issue of law or fact is \n8  sufficient.”) (citation omitted); Sweet v. Pfizer, 232 F.R.D. 360, 367 (C.D. Cal. 2005) \n9  (observing that “there must only be one single issue common to the proposed class”) \n10  (quotation and citation omitted). \n11  Plaintiffs and proposed class members also share a common core of facts: (1) \n12  The determination of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ DACA is subject to the same \n13  rules, namely the DACA Memo and SOPs; (2) Plaintiffs and proposed class members \n14  all had their DACA terminated without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an \n15  opportunity to respond; and (3) Plaintiffs and proposed class members do not have \n16  any convictions that would disqualify them from the program.   \n17  Finally, Plaintiffs and proposed class members “have suffered the same injury,” \n18  in that Defendants have terminated each of their DACA without notice, a meaningful \n19  explanation, or an opportunity to be hear pursuant to the same unlawful policies or \n20  practices.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011) (quoting Gen. \n21  Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982)).  Should the Court agree that \n22  Defendants’ policies or practices violate the APA and/or the Due Process Clause, all \n23  who fall within the class will benefit from the requested relief—a nationwide \n24  injunction preventing the termination of their DACA pursuant to those practices.  \n25  Thus, a common answer as to the legality of the challenged policies and practices will \n26  “drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, \n27  981 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350). \n28 \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 22 of 29   Page ID\n #:795\n1  Defendants may argue that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy commonality because the \n2  agency’s decision to revoke DACA is based on particular facts and circumstances \n3  unique to each recipient.  But this argument would misconstrue and misapply the \n4  commonality requirement.  Instead, “[w]here the circumstances of each particular \n5  class member vary but retain a common core of factual or legal issues with the rest of \n6  the class, commonality exists.”  Evon v. Law Offices of Sidney Mickell, 688 F.3d \n7  1015, 1029 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also \n8  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046 (“Differences among the class members with respect to the \n9  merits of their actual document fraud cases, however, are simply insufficient to defeat \n10  the propriety of class certification.  What makes the plaintiffs’ claims suitable for a \n11  class action is the common allegation that the INS’s procedures provide insufficient \n12  notice.”); Arnott, 290 F.R.D. at 586-87 (variation in business plans and investment \n13  projects did not defeat certification in light of common question of permissibility of \n14  retroactively applying new policy to those who “already received approval of I-526 \n15  petitions”).  Moreover, any factual differences that may exist among Plaintiffs and \n16  proposed class members are immaterial to their claims, which challenge Defendants’ \n17  common termination policies and practices as categorically violating the APA and the \n18  Due Process Clause—not the agency’s ultimate exercise of discretion with respect to \n19  each recipient.  See Orantes-Hernandez v. Smith, 541 F. Supp. 351 (C.D. Cal. 1982) \n20  (rejecting defendants’ argument that certification was unwarranted because class \n21  members’ suitability for relief was individualized where plaintiff challenged common \n22  agency practice, not ultimate outcome of cases).  \n23  C. Typicality: Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Typical of Those of Other Class \nMembers. \n24 \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defense of the representative parties \n25 \n[be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  The purpose of this requirement is \n26 \nto “assure that the interest of the named representative aligns with the interests of the \n27 \nclass” as a whole.  Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992).  \n28 \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 23 of 29   Page ID\n #:796\n1  “Under the rule’s permissive standards, representative claims are ‘typical’ if they are \n2  reasonably coextensive with those of the absent class members.”  Parsons, 754 F.3d at \n3  685 (quoting Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020).  “The test of typicality is ‘whether other \n4  members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct \n5  which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have \n6  been injured by the same course of conduct.’”  Id. (citation omitted).  As with \n7  commonality, factual differences among class members do not defeat typicality.  \n8  LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1332 (9th Cir. 1985) (“The minor differences in the \n9  manner in which the representative’s Fourth Amendment rights were violated does not \n10  render their claims atypical of those of the class.”) \n11  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed class.  Each Plaintiff, \n12  just like each proposed class members, had valid DACA and work authorization that \n13  USCIS terminated without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to be \n14  heard, pursuant to Defendants’ unlawful policies or practices.  Plaintiffs and class \n15  members assert that such action was arbitrary and capricious under the APA and \n16  violated the Due Process Clause.  Any factual variations among Plaintiffs and \n17  proposed class members in ways relevant to USCIS’s ultimate decision of whether to \n18  terminate DACA do not defeat typicality because, as described above, Plaintiffs’ \n19  claims do not implicate such differences.  See, e.g., Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1124 (“The \n20  particular characteristics of the Petitioner or any individual detainee will not impact \n21  the resolution of this general statutory question and, therefore, cannot render \n22  Petitioner’s claim atypical.”). \n23  D. Adequacy: Plaintiffs Will Adequately Protect the Interests of the \nProposed Class, and Plaintiffs’ Counsel Are More Than Qualified to \n24 \nLitigate this Action. \n25 \nRule 23(a)(4) requires that “[t]he representative parties will fairly and \n26 \nadequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  “Whether the \n27 \nclass representatives satisfy the adequacy requirement depends on ‘the qualifications \n28 \nof counsel for the representatives, an absence of antagonism, a sharing of interests \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 24 of 29   Page ID\n #:797\n1  between representatives and absentees, and the unlikelihood that the suit is \n2  collusive.’”  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1125 (citing Walters, 145 F.3d at 1046). \n3  Plaintiffs’ counsel are deemed qualified when they can establish their \n4  experiences in previous class actions and cases involving the same area of law.  Lynch \n5  v. Rank, 604 F. Supp. 30, 37 (N.D. Cal. 1984), aff’d 747 F.2d 528 (9th Cir. 1984), \n6  amended on reh’g, 763 F.2d 1098 (9th Cir. 1985).  Here, putative Class Counsel are \n7  attorneys from the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project and ACLU of Southern \n8  California.  See Declaration of Jennifer Chang Newell (“Newell Decl.”).  \n9  Collectively, putative Class Counsel have extensive and diverse experience in \n10  complex immigration cases and class action litigation, and Class Counsel also have \n11  sufficient resources to litigate this matter to completion.  Id. ¶¶ 2-27.  Attorneys from \n12  the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project and ACLU of Southern California have been \n13  appointed class counsel and successfully litigated similar class action lawsuits in this \n14  district and in courts across the country.  Id.; see also, e.g., Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at \n15  1111; Alfaro Garcia v. Johnson, No. 14-cv-1775, 2014 WL 6657591, at *15 (N.D. \n16  Cal. 2014); Rivera v. Johnson, 307 F.R.D. 539 at 542-43 (W.D. Wa 2015); Franco-\n17  Gonzales, 2011 WL 11705815, at *1; Preap, 303 F.R.D. at 570; Khoury v. Asher, 3 F. \n18  Supp. 3d 877, 878 (W.D. Wash. 2014); RILR v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 181 \n19  (D.D.C. 2015). \n20  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class, \n21  and therefore are adequate class representatives.  Plaintiffs do not seek any unique or \n22  additional benefit from this litigation that may make their interests different from or \n23  adverse to those of absent class members.  Instead, Plaintiffs’ aim is to secure \n24  injunctive relief that will protect themselves and the entire class from the Defendants’ \n25  challenged practices and enjoin the Defendants from further violations.  See Arreola \n26  Decl. ¶¶ 42-43; Gil Decl. ¶¶ 27-28; Moreira Decl. ¶ 23-24.  Plaintiffs and Class \n27  Counsel do not seek financial gain at the cost of absent class members’ rights. \n28  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they lack any antagonism with the \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 25 of 29   Page ID\n #:798\n1  class, that they share interests with proposed class members, and that no collusion is \n2  present. \n3  E. The Class Is Sufficiently Ascertainable. \n4  Although the Ninth Circuit has not yet ruled whether the judicially implied \n5  ascertainability requirement applies to classes certified under Rule 23(b)(2), other \n6  circuits have found that it does not.  See Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 563 (3d \n7  Cir. 2015) (“The nature of Rule 23(b)(2) actions, the Advisory Committee’s note on \n8  (b)(2) actions, and the practice of many [] other federal courts all lead us to conclude \n9  that ascertainability is not a requirement for certification of a (b)(2) class seeking only \n10  injunctive and declaratory relief . . . .”); Shook v. El Paso Cnty., 386 F.3d 963, 972 \n11  (10th Cir. 2004) (“[M]any courts have found Rule 23(b)(2) well suited for cases where \n12  the composition of the class is not readily ascertainable.”); Cole v. City of Memphis, \n13  839 F.3d 530, 542 (6th Cir. 2016), cert. denied 137 S. Ct. 2220 (2017) \n14  (“[A]scertainability is not an additional requirement for certification of a (b)(2) class \n15  seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief.”); Yaffe v. Powers, 454 F.2d 1362, \n16  1366 (1st Cir.1972) (no ascertainability requirement for Rule 23(b)(2) classes); see \n17  also, e.g., In re Yahoo Mail Litig., 308 F.R.D. 577, 597 (N.D. Cal. 2015).   \n18  In any event, the proposed class is sufficiently ascertainable because it is \n19  “administratively feasible” to ascertain whether an individual is a member.  Greater \n20  Los Angeles Agency on Deafness, Inc. v. Reel Servs. Mgmt. LLC, No. 13-cv-7172 PSG \n21  (ASX), 2014 WL 12561074, at *5 (C.D. Cal. May 6, 2014) (Gutierrez, J.) (internal \n22  quotation marks omitted) (finding ascertainable proposed class of individuals who are \n23  deaf or hard of hearing and require closed captioning).  Here, membership in the class \n24  is defined by clear and objective criteria: (1) the individual’s DACA has been or will \n25  be terminated without notice, a meaningful explanation, or an opportunity to \n26  respond—that is, without the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate and a \n27  sufficient opportunity to respond to the reason for termination and (2) the individual \n28  has not been convicted of any disqualifying crime as set forth in the DACA Memo \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 26 of 29   Page ID\n #:799\n1  and SOPs.  See supra at 3.  This definition is “‘precise, objective, and presently \n2  ascertainable.’”  O’Connor v. Boeing N. Am., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D. Cal. \n3  1998) (observing that class definitions of actions maintained under Rule 23(b)(2) \n4  command less precision than actions for damages requiring notice to the class); see \n5  also, e.g., Lamumba Corp. v. City of Oakland, No. 05-cv-2712 MHP, 2007 WL \n6  3245282, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2007) (“Plaintiffs putative class is based on the \n7  objective factors of business ownership, race, and indebtedness to the City, and \n8  therefore is sufficiently defined.”).  The fact that some administrative process may be \n9  required to identify class members does not undermine ascertainability.  See, e.g., \n10  Moreno v. Napolitano, No. 11-cv-5452, 2014 WL 4911938, at *6-7 (N.D. Ill. Sept. \n11  30, 2014) (finding that the necessity of manually reviewing tens of thousands of \n12  detainer forms to identify class members did not undermine ascertainability) (citing \n13  Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 693 F.3d 532, 539 (6th Cir. 2012)).  This is \n14  particularly true here, where USCIS keeps detailed records regarding DACA \n15  terminations, see Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 at 138 (instructing adjudicators to update \n16  systems), and routinely evaluates whether DACA recipients have disqualifying \n17  convictions.  See Dunnigan v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 214 F.R.D. 125, 136 (S.D.N.Y. \n18  2003) (holding that even a slow and burdensome process for identifying class \n19  members would not defeat the ascertainability requirement).  Moreover, Plaintiffs \n20  have proposed a practical process for implementing the requested preliminary \n21  injunction, which includes a procedure for identifying class members whose DACA \n22  USCIS has already unlawfully revoked.  See Pls.’ PI Proposed Order.  \n23  II.  This Action Satisfies the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). \n24  In addition to satisfying the four requirements of Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs also \n25  must meet one of the subsections of Rule 23(b).  Certification of a class under Rule \n26  23(b)(2) requires that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \n27  grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \n28 \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 27 of 29   Page ID\n #:800\n1  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. \n2  R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n3  In the Ninth Circuit, “‘[i]t is sufficient’ to meet the requirements of Rule \n4  23(b)(2) [when] ‘class members complain of a pattern or practice that is generally \n5  applicable to the class as a whole.’”  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1125 (quoting Walters, \n6  145 F.3d at 1047); Lyon v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 308 F.R.D. 203, 213 \n7  (N.D. Cal. 2015) (injunctive or declaratory relief under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate \n8  when “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \n9  generally to the class”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, Rule “23(b)(2) \n10  was adopted in order to permit the prosecution of civil rights actions” like this one.  \n11  Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047; Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1126 (finding that class of non-\n12  citizens detained during immigration proceedings met Rule 23(b)(2) criteria because \n13  “all class members’ [sought] the exact same relief as a matter of statutory or, in the \n14  alternative, constitutional right”). \n15  Importantly, “[t]he rule does not require [the court] to examine the viability or \n16  bases of class members’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, but only to look \n17  at whether class members seek uniform relief from a practice applicable to all of \n18  them.”  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1125.  “‘The key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible \n19  nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the conduct \n20  is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members \n21  or as to none of them.’”  Lyon, 308 F.R.D. at 213 (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, 131 S.Ct. \n22  at 2557). \n23  Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirements are plainly met.  Here, Plaintiffs ask the Court to \n24  declare Defendants’ termination policies and practices, which have impacted Plaintiffs \n25  and proposed class members, to be unlawful and to enjoin USCIS from: (1) enforcing \n26  the termination of DACA and related work authorization for Plaintiffs and class \n27  members whose DACA USCIS has already unlawfully terminated and (2) terminating \n28  DACA grants and work authorization in the future based solely on the issuance of an \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 28 of 29   Page ID\n #:801\n1  NTA charging unlawful presence or otherwise absent a fair procedure that complies \n2  with the agency’s rules, including notice, a reasoned explanation, and an opportunity \n3  to be heard prior to termination.  See Pls.’ PI Proposed Order. \n4   This relief would benefit Plaintiffs as well as all members of the proposed \n5  classes in the same fashion.  No individual class member would be entitled to a \n6  different injunction or declaratory judgment.  The requested relief would address these \n7  policies or practices in a single stroke, and thus the proposed class plainly warrants \n8  certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 689 (finding declaratory \n9  and injunctive relief proper as to the whole class where “every [member] in the \n10  proposed class is allegedly suffering the same (or at least a similar) injury and that \n11  injury can be alleviated for every class member by uniform changes in . . . policy and \n12  practice”); Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1126 (certifying class of immigrant detainees under \n13  Rule 23(b)(2) where “relief from a single practice is requested by all class members”). \n14  Given the nature of Plaintiffs’ claims, which challenge USCIS’s centralized and \n15  uniform DACA termination practices, class certification should be nationwide.  \n16  Defendants have indicated that USCIS has a practice of automatically terminating \n17  individual DACA grants, without process.  See Thomas Decl. ¶ 4.  Plaintiffs have \n18  identified at least 17 examples of Defendant’s unlawful DACA terminations from \n19  various states around the country (including Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Minnesota, \n20  South Dakota, North Carolina, New Jersey, and California).  See Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 2-14.  \n21  And given the nationwide scope and scale of the program, there are nearly 700,000 \n22  DACA recipients in all 50 states who are potentially at risk of having their DACA \n23  unlawfully terminated pursuant to Defendants’ practices.  Id. ¶ 48, Ex. 33. \n24  Certification that is not nationwide in scope would result in Defendants continuing to \n25  apply an unlawful policy to DACA recipients simply by virtue of their geographic \n26  location.  Such piecemeal relief would lead to arbitrary and unjust results.  See \n27  Gorbach v. Reno, 181 F.R.D. 642, 644 (W.D. Wash. 1998), aff’d, 219 F.3d 1087 (9th \n28  Cir. 2000) (holding certification of a nationwide class was particularly fitting because \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 33-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 29 of 29   Page ID\n #:802\n1  “anything less [than] a nationwide class would result in an anomalous situation \n2  allowing the INS to pursue denaturalization proceedings against some citizens, but not \n3  others, depending on which district they reside in”).  \n4  Because Plaintiffs and proposed class members all have suffered or will suffer \n5  the same statutory and constitutional violations as a result of the government’s \n6  challenged practices or policies, and because they seek singular injunctive and \n7  corresponding declaratory relief that remedy those injuries, the Court should certify \n8  the class under Rule 23(b)(2). \n9  CONCLUSION \n10  Plaintiffs respectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion and enter an \n11  order certifying the proposed class under Rule 23(b)(2); appoint Plaintiffs as Class \n12  Representatives; and appoint the Plaintiffs’ Counsel from ACLU Immigrants’ Rights \n13  Project and the ACLU of Southern California as Class Counsel. \n14   \n15  Dated: December 21, 2017    Respectfully submitted, \n \n16 \n/s/ Katrina L.

See Dkt. # 16 (“Mot.”).  Defendants Elaine C. Duke, James\nMcCament, Mark J. Hazuda, Susan M. Curda, Thomas D. Homan, David Marin, and Kevin K.\nMcAleenan (“Defendants”) oppose the motion, see Dkt. # 23 (“Opp.”), and Plaintiff timely\nreplied, see Dkt. # 25 (“Reply”).  The Court held a hearing on this matter on November 20, 2017,\nand also consulted supplemental authority.  Having considered the moving papers and oral\narguments, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion.\nI. Background\nThis action stems from the termination of Plaintiff’s Deferred Action for Childhood\nArrivals (“DACA”).\nA. The DACA Program\nDeferred action is a longstanding form of administrative action by which the Executive\nBranch decides, for humanitarian or other reasons, to refrain from seeking a noncitizen’s\nremoval and to authorize his or her continued presence in the United States.  See Reno v.\nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 484 (1999).  On June 15, 2012, the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) announced DACA, a deferred action program for\nyoung immigrants who came to the United States as children and are present in the United States\nwithout formal immigration status, in a memorandum issued by Secretary Janet Napolitano (“the\nNapolitano Memo”).  See Declaration of Dae Kuen Kwon, Dkt. # 16-4 (“Kwon Decl.”), ¶ 10, Ex.\n9 (“Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United\nStates as Children”) at 2 (“Napolitano Memo”).

Elaine C. Duke et al.\n2017 that it was planning to rescind the DACA program, officials confirmed that the same\nprogram rules would continue to apply until its end.  Mot. 5:6–8.\nUnder DACA, young immigrants who entered the United States as children and meet\nspecified educational and residency requirements, and who pass extensive criminal background\nchecks, are eligible to receive deferred action.  See Napolitano Memo at 1–2.  A necessary\npredicate for DACA eligibility is that an individual must lack a lawful immigration status.  See\nKwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 (“National Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Deferred Action for\nChildhood Arrivals (DACA)”) at 44 (“DACA SOP”).  Deferred action under DACA is granted to\nqualifying individuals for a period of two years, subject to renewal, see Napolitano Memo at\n2–3, and DACA recipients may obtain an Employment Authorization Document (“EAD”) and a\nSocial Security Number.  Mot. 4:8–10.\nDHS’s DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“DACA SOPs”) set forth the procedures\nthat U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) must follow in both granting and\nterminating DACA.  See DACA SOP at 16; see also Colotl v. Kelly, No. 1:17-CV-1670-MHC,\n2017 WL 2889681, at *4 (N.D. Ga. June 12, 2017) (“The SOP states that it is applicable to all\npersonnel performing adjudicative functions and the procedures to be followed are not\ndiscretionary.”).\nB. Plaintiff’s History\nPlaintiff is a 23-year-old resident of Los Angeles who has lived in the United States since\nthe age of one and has received deferred action through DACA three times—in 2012, 2014, and\n2016.  Mot. 1:2–6; Declaration of Jesus Alonso Arreola Robles, Dkt. # 16-3 (“Arreola Decl.”),\n¶¶ 1, 10–11; Kwon Decl. ¶¶ 5–6, 23–25, Exs. 4 (2012 DACA Application), 5 (2012 DACA\nApproval Notice), 22 (2014 DACA Renewal Application), 23 (2016 DACA Renewal\nApplication), 24 (2016 DACA Renewal Approval Notice).  This final grant was set to be valid\nuntil August 19, 2018.  Mot. 6:23–26; Kwon Decl. ¶ 25, Ex. 24.  Using the accompanying EAD,\nPlaintiff worked two jobs, as a dishwasher and then a cook at Chateau Marmont in West\nHollywood and as a driver for Uber and Lyft.  Mot. 7:1–5; Arreola Decl. ¶¶ 13–15.  He shared\nhis earnings with his family and paid half the rent for their home.  Mot. 7:5–6; Arreola Decl.\n¶ 16.  Plaintiff has never been charged with or convicted of any crime.  Mot. 7:7; Arreola Decl.\n¶ 17.\nIn February 2017, Plaintiff claims that a friend asked him to drive his cousin from the Los\nAngeles area to the San Diego area, to pick up the friend’s uncle and another cousin and bring\nthem back to Los Angeles—a task for which he would be paid $600.

Defendants note that, at the time, Plaintiff provided authorities\nconflicting information, both in terms of the nature of his assignment and the amount he was to\nbe paid for completing it.  See Opp. 7:1–8:5.\nCBP detained Plaintiff and issued him a Notice to Appear (“NTA”), initiating removal\nproceedings and charging him as removable due to his presence in the United States without\nadmission under the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”).  Mot. 8:3–7; Kwon Decl. ¶ 4, Ex.\n3 (Notice to Appear).  Plaintiff was not, however, charged with any crime.  Mot. 8:7–8; Arreola\nDecl. ¶ 29.  On March 2, 2017, Plaintiff received a bond hearing before an immigration judge\nand was released from immigration detention the following day.  Mot. 8:9–9:3; Arreola Decl.\n¶¶ 32, 35–36.  Shortly thereafter, on March 6, Plaintiff received a Notice of Action from USCIS\nnotifying him that his DACA and EAD were “terminated automatically as of the date [his] NTA\nwas issued.”  Kwon Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 8 (Notice of Action) at 1.  Plaintiff reports that he was not\nprovided with prior notice of his DACA termination, a reasoned explanation for the decision, or\nan opportunity to respond to the Notice of Action or otherwise contest the decision.  Mot.\n9:10–13; Arreola Decl. ¶ 38.  Subsequent efforts by Plaintiff to seek redress from USCIS were\nunsuccessful.  Mot. 9:14–22.\nAs a result of losing his DACA and EAD, Plaintiff lost his job at Chateau Marmont and\ncan no longer work as a driver for Uber of Lyft.  Id. 9:23–10:1; Arreola Decl. ¶ 40.  His hardship\nhas been magnified by the fact that he and his partner are expecting their first child later this\nyear.  Id. 10:1–3; Arreola Decl. ¶ 40.\nII. Legal Standard\nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary and drastic remedy.”  Munaf v. Geren, 553\nU.S. 674, 689 (2008).  A party seeking a preliminary injunction must make a “clear showing” of:\n(1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a likelihood of irreparable injury to the plaintiff if\ninjunctive relief is not granted, (3) a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff, and (4) an\nadvancement of the public interest.  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20, 22\n(2008).\nIII. Discussion\nA.

Elaine C. Duke et al.\ni. Jurisdiction\nAs a threshold matter, Defendants challenge this Court’s ability to review the revocation\nof Plaintiff’s DACA, based on both the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the REAL\nID Act of 2005.\na. Jurisdiction under the APA\nAlthough the APA permits judicial review of agency actions where “there is no other\nadequate remedy in a court,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, Defendants note that the APA precludes review of\nagency decisions that are “committed to agency discretion by law,” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), and\nthat the Supreme Court has held that “an agency’s decision not to take enforcement action\nshould be presumed immune from judicial review under § 701(a)(2).”  Heckler v. Chaney, 470\nU.S. 821, 832 (1985).  Because “[i]ndividual DACA decisions fall squarely within that category\nof agency discretion,” Defendants conclude that “[t]he APA specifically precludes review of the\naction that Plaintiff challenges.”  Opp. 13:24, 14:15.\nThe Court disagrees.  The jurisdictional bar cited by Defendants applies only where there\nis “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Mendez-\nGutierrez v. Ashcroft, 340 F.3d 865, 868 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830).  By\ncontrast, a court can review an agency decision when, like here, there are “statutes, regulations,\nestablished agency policies, or judicial decisions that provide a meaningful standard against\nwhich to assess” an agency’s action.  Mendez-Gutierrez, 340 F.3d at 868; see also ASSE Int’l,\nInc. v. Kerry, 803 F.3d 1059, 1069 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Spencer Enters., Inc. v. United\nStates, 345 F.3d 683, 688 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. Immigration & Naturalization\nServ., 208 F.3d 838, 844 (9th Cir. 2000)) (“Even where statutory language grants an agency\n‘unfettered discretion,’ its decision may nonetheless be reviewed if regulations or agency\npractice provide a ‘meaningful standard by which this court may review its exercise of\ndiscretion.’”).\nHere, the decision to revoke DACA is governed by both the Napolitano Memo and the\nDACA SOPs, and the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly found that APA jurisdiction exists where\n“discretion has been legally circumscribed by various memoranda.”  Alcaraz v. Immigration &\nNaturalization Serv., 384 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 648 F.3d 708, 719 (9th Cir. 2011) (looking to an agency’s interim certification\nstandards to “supply the standard against which we can judge the agency’s decision-making”);\nMendez-Gutierrez, 340 F.3d at 868 (noting that the absence of a specific statute or regulation\n“does not . . . mean that there are no meaningful standards against which to evaluate” an\nagency’s decision where other rules and regulations apply).

See\nGonzalez Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 17cv1840 JM(NLS), 2017 WL 4340385,\nat *5 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017) (citing United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S.\n260, 268 (1954); Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1162) (“Defendants’ failure to follow the termination\nprocedures set forth in the DACA SOP is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.”);\nColotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *10 (“Defendants’ argument that § 701(a) of the APA bars this\nCourt from reviewing an agency’s non-discretionary review process fails.”); see also Texas v.\nUnited States, 809 F.3d 134, 170 (5th Cir. 2015), as revised (Nov. 25, 2015), cert. granted, 136\nS. Ct. 906 (2016) (determining that the “grant of lawful presence and accompanying eligibility\nfor benefits is a substantive rule”).\nPlaintiff correctly notes that he “challenges USCIS’ determination that his DACA should\nbe automatically terminated based on CBP’s issuance of an NTA, not any eventual enforcement\ndecision in removal proceedings.”  Reply 11:3–5.  Because DACA eligibility and revocation is\ngoverned by the aforementioned regulations, the Court has a meaningful standard on which to\nbase the agency’s decision, and so judicial review is not barred by the APA.  See Ramirez\nMedina v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. C17-0218RSM, 2017 WL 5176720, at *8 (W.D.\nWash. Nov. 8, 2017) (“Defendants’ alleged failure to follow the procedures detailed in the\nDACA SOP does not implicate agency discretion.  Therefore, the jurisdiction-stripping\nprovisions of . . . § 701(a) are not applicable to prevent this Court from determining whether\nDefendants complied with their non-discretionary procedures.”).\nb. Jurisdiction under § 1252(g)\nDefendants next point to statutory language amended by the REAL ID Act, which\nmandates that “no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any\nalien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings,\nadjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  The\nSupreme Court has explained that § 1252(g) is “directed against a particular evil: attempts to\nimpose judicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.”  Reno, 525 U.S. at 944 n.9. \nAccordingly, Defendants assert that “regardless of how Plaintiff seeks to frame the issue, 8\nU.S.C. § 1252(g) precludes judicial review of the Government’s exercise of its prosecutorial\ndiscretion.”  Opp. 17:15–16.\nDefendants interpret § 1252(g) too broadly, as evidenced by the Supreme Court’s Reno\ndecision.  There, in response to the “unexamined assumption that § 1252(g) covers the universe\nof deportation claims—that it is a ‘zipper’ clause that says ‘no judicial review in deportation\ncases unless this section provides judicial review,’” the Supreme Court opined that “what\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 5 of 16\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 31   Filed 11/20/17   Page 6 of 16   Page ID #:711\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date November 20, 2017\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Elaine C. Duke et al.\n§ 1252(g) says is much narrower.”  Reno, 525 U.S. at 482.  It concluded that “[t]he provision\napplies only to three discrete actions that the Attorney General may take: her ‘decision or action’\nto ‘commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’”  Id. (emphases in\noriginal).  Section 1252(g) does not preclude review of “many other decisions or actions that\nmay be part of the deportation process.”  Id.  Consistent with this guidance, the Ninth Circuit has\nnarrowly construed § 1252(g), distinguishing between the narrow category of actions that courts\ncannot review and those adjacent actions that are within their jurisdiction.  In Alcaraz, for\nexample, the Ninth Circuit held that even a claim closely related to the initiation of removal\nproceedings is not barred by § 1252(g), so long as it does not challenge the decision to\ncommence proceedings itself.  Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1160–61; see also Catholic Soc. Servs. v.\nImmigration & Naturalization Serv., 232 F.3d 1139, 1150 (“[Section 1252(g)] applies only to\nthe three specific discretionary actions mentioned in its text, not to all claims relating in any way\nto deportation proceedings.”).\nHere, Plaintiff is challenging neither the issuance of the NTA nor the CBP’s decision to\ncommence removal proceedings.  Instead, he challenges the USCIS’s separate and independent\ndecision to revoke his DACA on that basis, which is independent of the limited category of\ndecisions covered by § 1252(g).  See Ramirez Medina, 2017 WL 5176720, at *6 (“[T]he Court\nultimately finds that none of the statutes relied upon by Defendants applies to the narrower\nissues presented in this case; specifically, whether Defendants complied with their own non-\ndiscretionary procedures.”); Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *4–5.  \nFurthermore, the Ninth Circuit has held that while § 1252(g) precludes review of the three\nspecified discretionary decisions, it does not bar review of legal questions relating to those\ndiscretionary decisions.  See United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(en banc) (“The district court may consider a purely legal question that does not challenge the\nAttorney General’s discretionary authority, even if the answer to that legal question—a\ndescription of the relevant law—forms the backdrop against which the Attorney General later\nwill exercise discretionary authority.”); see also Madu v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 470 F.3d 1362,\n1368 (11th Cir. 2006) (“While this provision bars courts from reviewing certain exercises of\ndiscretion by the attorney general, it does not proscribe substantive review of the underlying\nlegal bases for those discretionary decisions and actions.”).  Here, Plaintiff brings a legal\nchallenge to his revocation under the APA and the due process clause.  This is the sort of purely\nlegal question that, although related to a discretionary decision, is nevertheless permitted by the\nNinth Circuit.\nBecause Plaintiff is offering a legal challenge to a decision that is not within the limited\ncategory of discretionary actions enumerated by the statute, the Court concludes that § 1252(g)\ndoes not deprive it of jurisdiction over this action.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 6 of 16\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 31   Filed 11/20/17   Page 7 of 16   Page ID #:712\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date November 20, 2017\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Elaine C. Duke et al.\nc. Jurisdiction under §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9)\nLastly, Defendants contend that other sections of the REAL ID Act “bar [Plaintiff] from\nraising his claims in district court.”  Opp. 18:2–3.  Section 1252(a)(5) requires that “a petition\nfor review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the\nsole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any\nprovision of this chapter.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5).  Section 1252(b)(9) further provides that\n“[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of\nconstitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to\nremove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial\nreview of a final order under this section.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  As one court characterized it,\nthis statutory scheme was designed to “put an end to the scattershot and piecemeal nature of the\nreview process that previously had held sway in regard to removal proceedings.”  Aguilar v. U.S.\nImmigration & Customs Enf’t, 510 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2007).\nHowever, although the Supreme Court has explained that the purpose of § 1252(b)(9) is\n“to consolidate ‘judicial review’ of immigration proceedings into one action in the court of\nappeals,” it “applies only ‘[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection\n(a)(1).’”  Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 313 (2001).  Section\n1252(a)(1), like § 1252(a)(5), refers to “[j]udicial review of a final removal” order.  8 U.S.C.\n§ 1252(a)(1); see also Singh v. Gonzalez, 499 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir. 2007) (“By virtue of their\nexplicit language, both §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) apply only to those claims seeking judicial\nreview of orders of removal.”).\nAgain, Plaintiff does not seek judicial review of an order of removal; indeed, his\nchallenge is independent of any removal proceeding.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385,\nat *5 (“Plaintiff brings a procedural challenge to termination of his DACA status, an issue\nindependent from any removal proceedings.”).  Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit has held that\n§ 1252(b)(9) does not deprive district courts of jurisdiction where a claim could not have been\nlitigated in removal proceedings and the noncitizen would otherwise “have had no legal avenue\nto obtain judicial review of this claim.”  J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1032 (9th Cir. 2016);\nsee also Mamigonian v. Biggs, 710 F.3d 936, 945 (9th Cir. 2013) (permitting an APA action\nwhere the immigration judge “would be without jurisdiction” to adjudicate the claim and so\n“review would be unavailable” to plaintiff).  An immigration judge in a removal proceeding does\nnot have the power to grant or deny deferred action, or to review or reverse an agency’s decision\nto revoke it.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *6 (“[A]n immigration judge has no\njurisdiction to reinstate DACA status.”); see also Napolitano Memo at 2–3 (conveying power to\ngrant DACA to agencies); Matter of Quintero, 18 I. & N.

Elaine C. Duke et al.\n(“[N]either the immigration judge nor the Board may grant [deferred action] status or review a\ndecision of the District Director to deny it.”).  Therefore, Plaintiff could not have challenged the\nrevocation of his DACA at a removal proceeding, and so under Ninth Circuit precedent,\njurisdiction is not barred.\nPlaintiff here is not challenging a final removal order, and the action he brings is\npremised on a claim that could not have been brought in a removal proceeding.  Therefore,\n§§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) do not apply and do not deprive this Court of jurisdiction.\nii. Merits of Plaintiff’s Claims\nBecause the Court concludes that it has jurisdiction over this action, it will now consider\nthe merits of Plaintiff’s claims.\na. APA Claim\nPlaintiff argues that “Defendants have indicated that they terminated [his] DACA based\non the issuance of an NTA—one that charges [Plaintiff] with being removable because of\npresence without admission in the United States.  For multiple reasons, that decision was\narbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA.”  Mot. 10:28–11:3.\nUnder the APA, “agency action must be based on non-arbitrary, ‘relevant factors.’” \nJudulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 55 (2011) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v.\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983)).  The “courts retain a role, and an\nimportant one, in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.”  Judulang,\n565 U.S. at 53.  “When reviewing an agency action, we must assess, among other matters,\n‘whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has\nbeen a clear error of judgment.’”  Id. (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).\nThe Court agrees with Plaintiff that his case is analogous to that which the Supreme Court\nconsidered in Judulang.  See Mot. 11:12–22.  There, the Supreme Court considered a Board of\nImmigration Appeals (“BIA”) rule governing eligibility for a form of relief—suspension of\ndeportation—which, like DACA, was not provided for in the INA and was therefore\ndiscretionary.  See Judulang, 565 U.S. at 46–47.  Despite this discretionary quality, the Supreme\nCourt nonetheless determined that the rules applied by the agency must reflect reasoned\ndecisionmaking, admonishing that “[a] method for disfavoring deportable aliens that bears no\nrelation to these matters—that neither focuses on nor relates to an alien’s fitness to remain in the\ncountry—is arbitrary and capricious.”  Id. at 55.  The BIA’s rule was invalidated because it was\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 8 of 16\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 31   Filed 11/20/17   Page 9 of 16   Page ID #:714\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date November 20, 2017\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Elaine C. Duke et al.\nbased on “a matter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this country,” which indicated that\n“the BIA ha[d] failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.”  Id. at 53.\nPlaintiff has put forth a compelling argument that, like the BIA’s invalidated rule in\nJudulang, the decision to automatically terminate Plaintiff’s DACA and EAD based on the\nissuance of an NTA fails the requirements of the APA.  First, based on the Napolitano Memo\nand the DACA SOPs, a noncitizen’s deportability due to unauthorized presence in the United\nStates—the basis for Plaintiff’s NTA—provides no relevant basis for terminating DACA.  These\nguidelines enumerate the relevant considerations for a DACA grant, and not only is unauthorized\npresence an unmentioned factor, but the program was specifically designed for persons without\nlawful immigration status.  See, e.g., DACA SOC at 44 (indicating that an individual “may be\nfavorably considered for DACA if” he/she “[e]ntered without inspection” or his/her “lawful\nimmigration status expired”).  The program’s rules also make clear that even noncitizens who\nare, have been, or will be placed in removal proceedings are nonetheless eligible for DACA.  See\nNapolitano Memo at 2; DACA SOP at 71 (“Individuals in removal proceedings may file a\nDACA request.”); Kwon Decl. ¶ 17, Ex. 16 (Statement of Assistant Secretary Michael\nDougherty and Acting Director James McCament) at 2 (“The 2012 memorandum also made\nclear that individuals could be considered for DACA even if they were already in removal\nproceedings or were subject to a final removal order.”).  Accordingly, the Court agrees that “the\nissuance of an NTA charging presence without admission does not provide a reasoned basis for\nterminating DACA.”  Mot. 12:10–11.\nFurthermore, the guidelines even address the issuance of an NTA.  The DACA SOPs\nprovide that if an NTA is issued against a DACA applicant, USCIS should “proceed with\nadjudication . . . , taking into account the basis for the NTA”—even if the NTA is based on a\npublic service concern.  See Kwon Decl., ¶ 22, Ex. 21 (“Revised Guidance for the Referral of\nCases and Issuance of Notices to Appear (NTAs) in Cases Involving Inadmissible and Removal\nAliens”) at 4 (“[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”)]’s issuance of an NTA\nallows USCIS to proceed with adjudication . . . , taking into account the basis for the NTA.”);\nDACA SOP at 93 (providing that if ICE accepts a case referred to it by USCIS during the DACA\napplication process, then USCIS “will follow the standard protocols outlined in the\n[aforementioned] NTA memorandum”).  In these cases, USCIS is required to review all relevant\ncircumstances, and may still grant a DACA request despite an NTA “[i]f a DACA requestor has\nbeen placed in proceedings on a ground that does not adversely impact the exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.”  DACA SOP at 75; see also id. at 74 (“Final removal orders . . . should\nbe reviewed carefully to examine the underlying grounds for removal.”).  Consequently, the\nCourt agrees with Plaintiff’s conclusion that, “[g]iven that the filing of an NTA against a DACA\napplicant, or even the issuance of a final order of removal against a DACA applicant, does not\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 9 of 16\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 31   Filed 11/20/17   Page 10 of 16   Page ID #:715\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date November 20, 2017\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Elaine C. Duke et al.\nrender noncitizens ineligible for the program, DHS’ decision to find [Plaintiff] ineligible on this\nbasis and automatically terminate his DACA is arbitrary and irrational.”  Mot. 13:17–21.\nIn addition, as Plaintiff notes, “USCIS’s decision to terminate DACA automatically based\non the filing of an NTA . . . left the question of whether [Plaintiff] continued to warrant a DACA\ngrant and EAD solely up to a CBP officer’s charging decision in issuing an NTA”—a result that\nis at odds with the Supreme Court’s decision in Judulang.  Mot. 14:17–20.  That opinion\nemphasized that “yet another” arbitrary quality of the BIA’s rule was that “the outcome of the\nBoard’s comparable-grounds analysis itself may rest on the happenstance of an immigration\nofficial’s charging decision.”  Judulang, 565 U.S. at 57.  The Supreme Court objected to the fact\nthat “everything hangs on the fortuity of an individual official’s decision,” noting that it had\npreviously “reversed an agency decision that would ‘make [an alien’s] right to remain here\ndependent on circumstances so fortuitous and capricious.’”  Id. at 58 (quoting Delgadillo v.\nCarmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 391 (1947)).  This is precisely the case here.  Because Plaintiff’s\nDACA was revoked automatically due to the issuance of the NTA, everything hung on the\nfortuity of one CBP officer’s decision.\nFinally, there is the issue of departure.  Agencies are free to change course and depart\nfrom a prior decision, but they are also “obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change.” \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 42; see also Federal Commc’ns Comm’n v. Fox Television Stations,\nInc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (“[T]he agency must show that there are good reasons for the new\npolicy.”).  Here, on three occasions—in 2012, 2014, and 2016—DHS evaluated Plaintiff’s\nDACA applications and determined that he was eligible for deferred action and an EAD.  See\nKwon Decl. ¶¶ 4–5, 23–25, Exs. 3–4, 22–24.  These decisions were based on extensive\nbackground checks and a review of Plaintiff’s school records and other documentation.  His\n2016 approval notice provided that “[u]nless terminated, this decision to defer removal action\nwill remain in effect for 2 years,” indicating its validity through August 19, 2018.  Kwon Decl.\n¶ 25, Ex. 24 at 1.  The notice specified that “[s]ubsequent criminal activity . . . is likely to result\nin termination of your deferred action.”  Id.  However, although Plaintiff has not been charged or\nconvicted of any criminal activity, this decision was reversed and his DACA was revoked.  The\nonly explanation for this reversal provided to Plaintiff was that it was “terminated automatically”\ndue to the NTA.  Kwon Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 8 at 1.  The Court agrees that “USCIS’s one-sentence\nexplanation” fails to “provide ‘good reasons’ for the agency’s change in position, as required by\nthe APA.”  Mot. 16:1–3; see also Organized Vill. Of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956,\n968 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 516; Perez v. Mortgage\nBankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1209 (2015)) (explaining that an agency is “required to provide\na ‘reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding’ the ‘facts and circumstances’ that underlay its\nprevious decision”) (alternation in original).  As Plaintiff accurately concludes, given that all\nDACA recipients are necessarily removable due to their unauthorized presence, “[t]he agency’s\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 10 of 16\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 31   Filed 11/20/17   Page 11 of 16   Page ID #:716\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date November 20, 2017\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Elaine C. Duke et al.\nreliance on an NTA citing [Plaintiff’s] presence without admission simply fails to explain, much\nless justify, the agency’s decision to reverse course and terminate his DACA.”  Mot. 16:10–12. \nSuch an arbitrary and unexplained decision fails to address Plaintiff’s substantial reliance\ninterests, which also runs counter to the Supreme Court’s mandate.  See Fox Television Stations,\n556 U.S. at 515 (holding that an agency must “provide a more detailed justification” when “its\nprior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account”).\nIn opposition, Defendants argue that that DHS did not violate its internal guidelines\nbecause “where CBP or ICE issues a Notice to Appear [NTA], the DACA SOP provides that\nDACA and the EAD terminate automatically.”  Opp. 25:3–4.  However, the DACA SOPs do not\nsupport this assertion.  There appears to be only one narrow circumstance in which automatic\ntermination based on an NTA is appropriate—when an NTA is issued after USCIS determines\nthat a disqualifying offense or public safety concern is deemed to be “Egregious Public Safety”\n(“EPS”).  DACA SOP at 137.  This is not the case here, as Plaintiff’s NTA was issued on the\nbasis of presence without admission, not EPS.  Defendants point to no provision in the DACA\nSOPs that permits automatic termination as a result of an NTA based on unauthorized presence.1 \nIndeed, “unless there are criminal, national security, or public safety concerns,” the DACA\ntermination guidelines prescribe the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate and require that\n“[t]he individual should be allowed 33 days to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds\ncited.”  Id. at 137–38.  When the Gonzalez Torres court was presented with a similar argument\nfrom the government—that “the NTA issued by [CBP] in connection with removal proceedings\nfor Plaintiff was tantamount to ICE issuing a NTA terminating DACA status pursuant to the\nDACA SOP”—the Court deemed the government’s position “indefensible,” noting that NTAs\nbased on an EPS designation and NTAs based on unauthorized presence “are not fungible, or\n‘flip sides of the same coin.’”  Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *6.2  \nDefendants further suggest that the Napolitano Memo “instructed ICE and CBP to\n‘immediately exercise their discretion on an individual basis’ in determining whether to issue an\nNTA or defer action.”  Opp. 25:23–26:1.  The Court agrees with Plaintiff that “Defendants\n1 Defendants point to the DACA SOPs’ appendix, which includes the form language for the\ntermination notice that Plaintiff received, but this language itself does not indicate when such a\nnotice should be dispatched.  See DACA SOP App. I at 2.\n2 As for the EAD, Defendants also cite statutory authority for its automatic revocation.  See Opp.\n25 n.16.  Although the regulations do provide for termination of work authorization when an\nNTA is issued in some cases, see 8 C.F.R. § 274a.14(1)(ii), it also contains an exception for\nwork permits granted to, among others, “alien[s] who [have] been granted deferred action.”  8\nC.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14); see also Alfaro-Orellana v. Ilchert, 720 F. Supp. 792, 794 (N.D. Cal.\n1989) (noting that § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii) “is itself ambiguous, because it creates an exception for\nappropriate work authorizations under § 274a.12(c)”).\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 11 of 16\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 31   Filed 11/20/17   Page 12 of 16   Page ID #:717\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date November 20, 2017\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

See Napolitano Memo at 2–3 (“USCIS should establish a\nclear and efficient process for exercising prosecutorial discretion, on an individual basis, by\ndeferring action against individuals.”).  The role of ICE and CBP was not to develop or manage\nthe program, but instead to “immediately exercise their discretion, on an individual basis, in\norder to prevent low priority individuals from being placed into removal proceedings” as DACA\nwas developed.  Id. at 2.  The Court agrees that “[n]othing in the Napolitano Memo supports the\nnotion that, once USCIS implemented the DACA adjudication process and made a considered\njudgment to grant an individual DACA, the decision could be unilaterally undone by any ICE or\nCBP officer”—indeed, if such were the case, “then the SOPs’ careful and detailed procedures\ngoverning DACA terminations would be negated.”  Reply 17:20–21, 18:8–11.\nAlternatively, Defendants argue that “Defendant DHS’s reading of its own authority to\nprovide for automatic termination of DACA with the issuance of NTAs is well supported by\nDefendant’s consistent practice, and is thus ‘entitled to substantial weight.’”  Opp. 26:1–9\n(quoting Chemehuevi Indian Tribe v. Brown, No. ED CV 16-1347-JFW (MRWx), 2017 WL\n2971864, at *8 n.9 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2017)).  The Court does not find this availing.  The\nevidence Defendants point to for this “consistent practice” is fourteen instances when DACA\nwas automatically terminated due to an NTA.  See Declaration of Ron Thomas, Dkt. # 23-2, ¶ 5. \nThe Court does not find such a practice “consistent” when “USCIS has granted DACA to more\nthan 800,000 applicants since 2012 and approximately 1,500 grants have been terminated.” \nReply 18:19–20.  At any rate, Defendants imply that such a practice is only entitled to deference\nunder Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), and is therefore due “respect only insofar\nas [it has] the power to persuade, which is a function of the thoroughness evident in [its]\nconsideration and the validity of [its] reasoning.”  Resident Councils of Wash. v.

The Court cannot afford\nthis practice much respect given that it apparently conflicts with the plain language of the DACA\nSOPs and would mean that “any individual enforcement officer could reverse USCIS’\nconsidered judgement with the stroke of a pen, notwithstanding the fact that the individual\ncontinues to be eligible for DACA and that all DACA recipients, by definition, lack lawful\nimmigration status.”  Reply 18:28–19:3.\nFinally, Defendants point to additional information regarding Plaintiff’s\narrest—“including an interview in which Plaintiff first lied about and later admitted to his illegal\nactivity”—to argue that “Defendants reasonably relied on these facts to find that Plaintiff was\ninvolved in a human smuggling operation, and led to the discretionary determination to issue an\nNTA, which simultaneously terminated Plaintiff’s DACA and EAD.”  Opp. 26:11–23. \nWhatever inconsistencies may be found in, and whatever suspicions may arise from, the\nevidence surrounding Plaintiff’s arrest, they are not relevant to his APA claim.

Elaine C. Duke et al.\nagency action according to the contemporaneous reasons given by the agency and disregard\nalternative rationales presented during litigation.  See Independence Mining Co., Inc. v. Babbitt,\n105 F.3d 502, 511 (9th Cir. 1997) (“The rule barring consideration of post hoc agency\nrationalizations operates where an agency has provided a particular justification for a\ndetermination at the time the determination is made, but provides a different justification for that\nsame determination when it is later reviewed by another body.”); see also Toor v. Lynch, 789\nF.3d 1055, 1064 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Arrington v. Daniels, 516 F.3d 1106, 1113 (9th Cir.\n2008)) (“[W]e may affirm the BIA based only on ‘the explanations offered by the agency.’”);\nShirrod v. Director, Office of Workers’ Comp. Programs, 809 F.3d 1082, 1087 n.4 (9th Cir.\n2015) (“[W]e review only what [the agency] did, not what [it] could have done.”).  Here, USCIS\nmade clear to Plaintiff that his DACA was terminated automatically due to CBP’s issuance of\nthe NTA.  This was the only rationale provided, and so it is the only one that the Court will\nconsider, especially since there is no evidence that USCIS relied on anything other than the NTA\nitself in making its decision.  See Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv.,\n450 F.3d 930, 943 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142 (1973)) (“When\nreviewing an agency decision, ‘the focal point for judicial review should be the administrative\nrecord already in existence, not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.’”).\nIn short, Defendants’ arguments in opposition do not sway the Court from its conclusion\nthat Plaintiff makes a compelling argument that the decision to terminate his DACA was\narbitrary and capricious and in violation of the APA.  Accordingly, he has demonstrated a\nsufficient likelihood of success on the merits, and so the first factor in the preliminary injunction\ninquiry tips in Plaintiff’s favor.\nb. Due Process Claim\nBecause the Court finds that Plaintiff’s APA claim satisfies the first requirement, it need\nnot consider his due process claim at this time.\nB. Irreparable Injury\nIn describing the nature of his irreparable harm, Plaintiff focuses on the economic\nconsequences of losing his DACA and EAD, arguing that the revocation “has derailed [his]\ncareer.”  Mot. 21:9.  He lost his job at Chateau Marmont (despite what he characterizes as his\nexpectation to “move up through the ranks”) and can no longer work as a driver.  Id. 21:14–16,\n21:26–28.  This argument is compelling, as the Ninth Circuit has held that “loss of opportunity\nto pursue [one’s] chosen profession” constitutes irreparable harm.  Enyart v. National\nConference of Bar Exam’rs, Inc., 630 F.3d 1153, 1165 (9th Cir. 2011); see also Cleveland Bd. of\nEduc. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 543 (1985) (“We have frequently recognized the severity of\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 13 of 16\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 31   Filed 11/20/17   Page 14 of 16   Page ID #:719\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date November 20, 2017\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Elaine C. Duke et al.\ndepriving a person of the means of livelihood.”).  Moreover, the Ninth Circuit has specifically\nfound irreparable harm in a similar case involving DACA recipients.  See Arizona Dream Act\nCoal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding irreparable harm where\nprofessional opportunities are limited); see also id. (“The irreparable nature of Plaintiffs’ injury\nis heightened by Plaintiffs’ young age and fragile socioeconomic position.  Setbacks early in\ntheir careers are likely to haunt Plaintiffs for the rest of their lives.”).  Plaintiff has demonstrated\nthat his earnings are used to support his family, see Arreola Decl. ¶¶ 2–5, 16, which also\nsuggests irreparable harm.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *6 (“The potential harm\ncaused by Defendants’ conduct includes the loss of employment, a core benefit under DACA. \nThe deprivation of employment impacts Plaintiff’s ability to financially provide for himself and\nhis family.”).\nIn opposition, Defendants suggest that “the imminence of the harm Plaintiff cites is\ndoubtful given the period of time that has elapsed between his loss of employment authorization\nand the filing of this action,” noting that “Defendants terminated Plaintiff’s DACA eight months\nago, and Plaintiff’s failure to raise this action until now casts doubt on his claims of urgent,\nirreparable harm unless his DACA and employment authorization are reinstated immediately.” \nOpp. 11:13–26.  The Court is not persuaded by this argument.  Plaintiff asserts, and Defendants\ndo not dispute, that the cause of this delay was his “good faith attempts to advocate with the\nagency to reconsider its unreasoned decision.”  Reply 21:25–22:2.  This fact distinguishes\nPlaintiff’s situation from the case cited by Defendants, Quach v. Bank of Am., Nat’l Ass’n, No.\n5:12-cv-05037 EJD, 2012 WL 4498873 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2012), where a plaintiff waited until\ntwo days before a trustee sale to seek a temporary restraining order challenging it.  Id. at *4. \nHere, there is no indication that Plaintiff’s delay was in bad faith, and even if it were, that alone\nwould not change the fact that Plaintiff’s harm is “ongoing and worsening” given that he is soon\nexpecting a child.  Reply 22:12–14; see also Arc of Cal. v. Douglas, 757 F.3d 975, 990 (9th Cir.\n2014) (“[T]ardiness is not particularly probative in the context of ongoing, worsening injuries.”).\nBecause the Court concludes that the deprivation of Plaintiff’s earnings and job\nopportunities caused by the loss of his DACA and EAD constitutes irreparable harm, this factor\nweighs in Plaintiff’s favor. \nC. Balance of Hardships and Public Interest\nThe remaining two factors—balance of hardships and the public interest—merge when,\nas here, the government is the opposing party.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).\nThere is undoubtedly a strong interest to be found in the effective and efficient\nenforcement of the nation’s immigration laws.  See, e.g., Reno, 525 U.S. at 490–91 (“[T]he\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 14 of 16\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 31   Filed 11/20/17   Page 15 of 16   Page ID #:720\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date November 20, 2017\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Elaine C. Duke et al.\nconsequence of delay . . . in deportation proceedings . . . is to permit and prolong a continuing\nviolation of United States law.”).  However, the Court does not conclude that this interest\noutweighs the ongoing harm that Plaintiff is experiencing as a result of losing his DACA and\nEAD, especially in light of the facts that (1) his DACA was slated to continue until August 2018,\nand (2) the Court is “simply requiring Defendants to comply with DHS’s written procedures as\nto the adjudication of DACA applications and the termination of DACA status.”  Colotl, 2017\nWL 2889681, at *12.  Defendants suggest that granting this motion would allow Plaintiff “to\nmaintain a government grace that he may again abuse for the purpose of breaking the law.” \nOpp. 31:26–27.  The Court is hard-pressed to accept this histrionic conclusion considering that,\nwhatever inconsistencies may exist in Plaintiff’s recollection of the events that led to his\ndetainment, he has not been charged with any crime.\nFurthermore, Plaintiff persuasively notes the public interest that exists in ensuring that the\ngovernment complies with its obligations under the law and follows its own procedures.  Mot.\n22:18–20; see also Brewer, 757 F.3d at 1069 (“[I]t is clear that it would not be equitable or in\nthe public’s interest to allow the state . . . to violate the requirements of federal law, especially\nwhen there are no adequate remedies available.”) (alternations in original); Melendres v. Arpaio,\n695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation\nof a party’s constitutional rights.”); Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 (“[T]he public has an\ninterest in government agencies being required to comply with their own written guidelines\ninstead of engaging in arbitrary decision making.”).  This is in addition to the public’s interest in\nensuring that Plaintiff remains employed and that his family remains supported.\nIn short, the Court concludes that the harms that would be experienced by Plaintiff and\nhis family if this motion were denied outweigh any potential injury to Defendants.  In addition,\nthe public has a strong interest in ensuring that the nation’s immigration laws are robustly—and\nfairly—enforced.  These factors therefore weigh in Plaintiff’s favor. \nIV. Conclusion\nPlaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his APA claim and the\nexistence of irreparable harm, and neither a balancing of hardships nor the public interest favors\nDefendants.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff Jesus Alonso Arreola Robles’s motion for\na preliminary injunction.\nIt is hereby ORDERED that USCIS’s decision to terminate Plaintiff’s status under the\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, memorialized in the March 6, 2017 Notice of\nAction, is preliminarily enjoined.  This preliminary injunction also applies to enjoin termination\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 15 of 16\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 31   Filed 11/20/17   Page 16 of 16   Page ID #:721\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date November 20, 2017\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

Mr. Arreola \n4  was granted permission three times to live and work in the United States through the \n5  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program—in 2012, 2014, and \n6  2016. Mr. Arreola used his DACA to work two jobs to help support his family—one \n7  as a cook at the famed Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, and one as a driver for \n8  Uber and Lyft. Mr. Arreola’s earnings helped support his parents, both of whom are \n9  lawful permanent residents, and his three U.S. citizen sisters, one of whom has \n10  significant disabilities. \n11    In March 2017, the government abruptly terminated Mr. Arreola’s DACA grant \n12  and work permit, without notice, a reasoned explanation, or any opportunity to contest \n13  the decision. The government revoked Mr. Arreola’s DACA even though Mr. Arreola \n14  does not have a single criminal conviction—or even a criminal charge—on his record \n15  and he continues to meet all of the DACA eligibility requirements. Mr. Arreola’s \n16  DACA was revoked after he was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”) \n17  while he was working as a driver—and CBP mistakenly believed he had been \n18  involved in alien smuggling. CBP detained Mr. Arreola and initiated removal \n19  proceedings against him by issuing him a “Notice to Appear.” However, shortly \n20  afterward, an immigration judge rejected the government’s allegation and concluded \n21  that CBP had been mistaken, ordering Mr. Arreola released on bond. The government \n22  nonetheless subsequently terminated Mr. Arreola’s DACA and work permit, without \n23  considering its own immigration judge’s findings. In fact, the government has \n24  indicated that it terminated Mr. Arreola’s DACA automatically—without any \n25  reasoning whatsoever—because CBP had issued Mr. Arreola a Notice to Appear, \n26  which charged him as removable for being present in the United States without \n27  admission. However, under the terms of the DACA program, neither placement in \n28  removal proceedings nor the lack of a lawful immigration status disqualifies an \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 7 of 28   Page ID #:78\n1  individual from the DACA program. Indeed, as with all DACA recipients, Mr. \n2  Arreola’s lack of a lawful immigration status is the reason he applied for DACA in the \n3  first place, and DACA was expressly made available to noncitizens in removal \n4  proceedings. \n5  The government’s revocation of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and employment \n6  authorization is arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and conflicts with its own rules, \n7  in violation of the Administration Procedure Act (“APA”). The revocation also \n8  violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The government’s actions have \n9  caused Mr. Arreola ongoing irreparable harm: he lost his job and his ability to help \n10  support his family.  \n11  Two different federal courts have recently issued preliminary injunctions \n12  against the government’s revocation of individual DACA grants without process. See \n13  Gonzalez Torres v. DHS, No. 17-cv-1840, 2017 WL 4340385, at *7 (S.D. Cal. Sept. \n14  29, 2017); Colotl v. Kelly, No. 17-cv-1670, 2017 WL 2889681, at *13 (N.D. Ga. June \n15  12, 2017). These decisions reinforce not only that Mr. Arreola has a high likelihood of \n16  success on the merits of his claims, but also that the government’s termination of \n17  DACA causes serious irreparable harm that warrants preliminary injunctive relief. \n18  Issuance of a preliminary injunction is particularly urgent, not only because of \n19  the ongoing serious harms to Mr. Arreola, but because his terminated DACA grant \n20  would have expired in August 2018. Thus, without preliminary relief enjoining the \n21  government’s unlawful termination of his DACA and work permit, Mr. Arreola may \n22  lose all opportunity for a meaningful remedy. \n23    For these reasons, and because Mr. Arreola satisfies the other injunction \n24  factors, Mr. Arreola respectfully asks this Court to grant a preliminary injunction and \n25  vacate Defendants’ unlawful revocation of his DACA and work permit or, in the \n26  alternative, order Defendants to temporarily reinstate his DACA and work permit \n27  pending a fair procedure—including notice, a reasoned explanation, and an \n28  opportunity to be heard.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 8 of 28   Page ID #:79\n1  BACKGROUND \n2    I.  The DACA Program \n3    Deferred action is a longstanding form of administrative action by which the \n4  federal Executive Branch decides, for humanitarian or other reasons, to refrain from \n5  seeking a noncitizen’s removal and to authorize his continued presence in the United \n6  States. Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 484 (1999). On \n7  June 15, 2012, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) \n8  announced DACA—a deferred action program specifically for young immigrants who \n9  came to the United States as children and are present in the country without formal \n10  immigration status.1 As former President Barack Obama explained, these young \n11  immigrants “are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: \n12  on paper.”2 Similarly, President Trump has described DACA recipients as “absolutely \n13  incredible kids,” who have “worked here” and “gone to school here,” and he publicly \n14  stated that they “should rest easy” about being permitted to remain in the country.3  \n15    Under DACA, young immigrants who entered the United States as children \n16  who meet specified educational and residency requirements, and who pass extensive \n17  criminal background checks, are eligible to receive deferred action. Napolitano Memo \n18  at 1-2. These enumerated eligibility criteria include the requirements that DACA \n19  recipients not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor,4 or three or \n20                                             \n1   Declaration of Dae Kuen Kwon (“Kwon Decl.”) ¶ 10, Ex. 9 at 2 (Janet \n21 \nNapolitano, Memorandum on Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to \n22  Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children, (June 15, 2012) (“Napolitano \nMemo”). \n23 \n2   Kwon Decl. ¶ 11, Ex. 10 at 2.  \n24  3   Kwon Decl. ¶ 12, Ex. 11 at 2; Kwon Decl. ¶ 18, Ex. 17 at 30; Kwon Decl. ¶ 19, \nEx. 18 at 16.  \n25 \n4   A significant misdemeanor is a conviction for an offense of “domestic violence; \n26  sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug \ndistribution or trafficking; or, driving under the influence; or . . . [a conviction] for \n27 \nwhich the individual was sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days.”  Kwon \n28  Decl. ¶ 20, Ex. 19 at 20 (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Frequently \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 9 of 28   Page ID #:80\n1  more other misdemeanors. Id. \n2    A predicate for eligibility for the DACA program is that the individual must \n3  lack a lawful immigration status (because he or she is present without admission, or \n4  overstayed a visa). Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 at 44 (DHS DACA Standard Operating \n5  Procedures).  In addition, the fact that a noncitizen is, has been, or will be in removal \n6  proceedings does not disqualify the individual from the program. Napolitano Memo at \n7  2. \n8    Deferred action through DACA is provided for a renewable period of two years, \n9  and DACA recipients may obtain an Employment Authorization Document (“EAD”) \n10  and a Social Security Number. See id. A decision to grant or deny a deferred action \n11  application or renewal is independent of any proceedings in immigration court; a \n12  noncitizen who is in removal proceedings can apply for DACA separately and \n13  simultaneously. Id. See also, e.g., Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *6 (noting \n14  that “an immigration judge has no jurisdiction to reinstate DACA status, or to \n15  authorize an application for renewal of DACA status”). The United States Citizenship \n16  and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is the division of DHS responsible for \n17  evaluating requests for DACA. DHS’ DACA Standard Operating Procedures \n18  (“DACA SOPs”) set forth the procedures that the agency must follow in adjudicating \n19  and granting DACA applications, as well as in terminating DACA and EADs granted \n20  through the program. Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 at 16 (“This SOP is applicable to all \n21  Service Center personnel performing adjudicative and clerical functions or review of \n22  those functions. Personnel outside of Service Centers performing duties related to \n23  DACA processing will be similarly bound by the provisions of this SOP.”); id. (“This \n24  SOP describes the procedures Service Centers are to follow when adjudicating DACA \n25  requests.”). See also Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *4 (“The SOP states that . . . \n26  procedures to be followed are not discretionary.”); Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL \n                                                                                                                                             \n27 \nAsked Questions about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (updated Apr. 25, \n28  2017)).  \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 10 of 28   Page ID #:81\n1  4340385, at *3.  \n2    On February 20, 2017, DHS Secretary John Kelly issued a memorandum setting \n3  forth DHS’ immigration enforcement priorities.5 Although that memorandum \n4  rescinded other existing DHS guidance, it expressly kept the DACA program in \n5  place.6 \n6    On September 5, 2017, DHS announced that it was rescinding the DACA \n7  program and winding it down.7 Although the program is soon ending, DHS officials \n8  have confirmed that the same program rules continue to apply until it ends.8 \n9    II.

Id. ¶ 18. In \n11  February 2017, a friend asked Mr. Arreola to drive his cousin from the Los Angeles \n12  area to the San Diego area to pick up the friend’s uncle and another cousin, and bring \n13  them back to the Los Angeles area. Id. The friend offered to pay Mr. Arreola $600 for \n14  the long-distance ride. Id. \n15  Mr. Arreola agreed and picked up his customer—his friend’s cousin—near \n16  North Hollywood. Id. ¶ 19. Mr. Arreola had never previously met the customer. Id. \n17  ¶ 26. The customer entered an address near San Diego into Mr. Arreola’s GPS and \n18  told him to drive to that location. Id. ¶ 19. Mr. Arreola was unfamiliar with the San \n19  Diego area and so relied on the GPS instructions to route him to the customer’s \n20  destination.

After the customer exited the car to get his uncle and \n23  cousin, the customer encountered a CBP agent who arrested him. Id. ¶¶ 21-23. \n24  Although Mr. Arreola informed the CBP agent that he had valid DACA status and had \n25  permission to live and work in the United States, the CBP agent also arrested Mr. \n26  Arreola, apparently suspecting that he was aiding in smuggling undocumented \n27  immigrants into the United States.

As a driver, it was not Mr. Arreola’s practice to ask about the immigration \n2  status of his customers. Id. \n3  CBP detained Mr. Arreola and issued him a Notice to Appear (“NTA”), \n4  initiating removal proceedings against him and charging him as removable because he \n5  was present in the United States without admission under the Immigration and \n6  Nationality Act (“INA”) § 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).

Arreola Decl. ¶ 29. \n9  On March 2, 2017, Mr. Arreola received a bond hearing before an immigration \n10  judge. Id.¶ 32. During the bond hearing, the DHS attorney suggested that Mr. Arreola \n11  was a danger to the community because he attempted to smuggle undocumented \n12  immigrants into the United States. Kwon Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. 6 at 52, 54.  However, Mr. \n13  Arreola testified, just as he had told CBP after he was arrested, that he regularly \n14  worked as a driver, id. at 8-9, and that a friend offered him $600 to pick up his \n15  friend’s uncle and cousin near the San Diego area and drive them back to the Los \n16  Angeles area, id. at 12-16. He further testified that he had no knowledge of the \n17  immigration status of the individuals he was supposed to pick up, id. at 16-17, 38, and \n18  denied the DHS attorney’s allegations that he was involved with smuggling \n19  unauthorized persons into the United States, id. at 38-39. \n20  The immigration judge rejected the DHS attorney’s arguments, found Mr. \n21  Arreola credible, determined that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community, \n22  and ordered Mr. Arreola’s release on $2,500 bond. Id. at 58-59. The immigration \n23  judge stated that he was “not going to accept the conclusions” by the CBP agents that \n24  Mr. Arreola was involved in “smuggling aliens for financial gains.” Id. at 58. The \n25  immigration judge observed that Mr. Arreola is “an Uber and Lyft driver. He’s in \n26  Hollywood, some three, three and a half hours away. Somebody is going to pay him to \n27  go all that way and come back.” Id. The immigration judge added that the CBP agents \n28  made the incorrect “assumption that [Mr. Arreola] was being paid to smuggle” the \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 14 of 28   Page ID #:85\n1  uncle and cousin “as opposed to pick up a fare, what would have been a lucrative \n2  fare.” Id. \n3  Mr. Arreola posted bond and was released from immigration detention. He \n4  spent a total of 21 days in detention. Arreola Decl. ¶¶ 35-36. He has been living in the \n5  Los Angeles area since being released. Id. ¶ 36. \n6 \n \nTermination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and Work Permit \n7 \nAfter his release, on March 6, 2017, Mr. Arreola received a Notice of Action \n8 \nfrom USCIS notifying him that his DACA and EAD were “terminated automatically \n9 \nas of the date [his] NTA was issued.”9 Mr. Arreola was never provided with any prior \n10 \nnotice that USCIS intended to terminate his DACA and EAD, a reasoned explanation \n11 \nfor this decision, or any opportunity to respond to such a notice or otherwise contest \n12 \nthe termination of his DACA or EAD.

On May 9, 2017, USCIS declined to revisit the issue. \n16 \nUSCIS stated that, among other things, that “when [U.S. Immigration and Customs \n17 \nEnforcement (“ICE”)] issues and serves the Notice to Appear on the DACA requestor \n18 \nduring the DACA validity period, that action alone terminates the DACA.

Arreola Decl. ¶ 40. Losing his DACA and EAD has been \n2  especially difficult for Mr. Arreola because he and his partner are expecting their first \n3  child later this year. Defendants’ actions have prevented him from saving for his \n4  family and planning for their future. Id. \n5  ARGUMENT \n6  This Court should issue a preliminary injunction. To prevail, Plaintiff must \n7  show: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) likely irreparable harm in the \n8  absence of such relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and (4) that an \n9  injunction is in the public interest. Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d \n10  1053, 1060 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n11  (2008)). Mr. Arreola satisfies all four factors.  \n12  I.  MR. ARREOLA IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS. \n13  Mr. Arreola is likely to succeed on his APA and procedural due process claims. \n14  Defendants’ revocation decision was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. \n15  Defendants automatically terminated Mr. Arreola’s DACA on the basis of an NTA \n16  issued by CBP, despite the Napolitano Memorandum’s explicit provision that \n17  noncitizens in removal proceedings—and even noncitizens with final orders of \n18  removal—remain eligible for DACA. Moreover, the agency reversed its previous \n19  position on Mr. Arreola’s eligibility for DACA without explanation and without \n20  accounting for the serious reliance interests at stake. Defendants’ automatic \n21  termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and EAD was also arbitrary and capricious \n22  because they did not follow the agency’s own termination procedures, as dictated by \n23  the DACA SOPs. Finally, Defendants’ actions also violated the Due Process Clause \n24  by failing to provide Mr. Arreola with notice and a meaningful process by which to \n25  contest the termination. \n \n26 \nA. DHS’ Automatic Termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA Based on the \n27  Issuance of an NTA Is Arbitrary and Capricious in Violation of the APA. \n28  Defendants have indicated that they terminated Mr. Arreola’s DACA based on \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 16 of 28   Page ID #:87\n1  the issuance of an NTA—one that charges Mr. Arreola with being removable because \n2  of presence without admission in the United States. For multiple reasons, that decision \n3  was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. \n4  § 706(2)(A). \n5  The Supreme Court has made clear that under § 706(2)(A), “agency action must \n6  be based on non-arbitrary, ‘relevant factors.’” Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 55 \n7  (2011). Judulang emphasized that “courts retain a role, and an important one, in \n8  ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.” Id. at 53. “When \n9  reviewing an agency action, we must assess, among other matters, ‘whether the \n10  decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has \n11  been a clear error of judgment.’” Id. (citation and internal punctuation omitted). \n12  In Judulang, the Supreme Court considered a Board of Immigration Appeals \n13  (“BIA”) rule governing eligibility for a form of relief—suspension of deportation—\n14  which was not provided for in the INA, and was therefore entirely discretionary. 565 \n15  U.S. at 46-47. Although the relief was ultimately within the agency’s discretion, the \n16  Court made clear that the rules applied by the agency with respect to that relief must \n17  still reflect reasoned decisionmaking. The Court emphasized that “[a] method for \n18  disfavoring deportable aliens . . . that neither focuses on nor relates to an alien’s \n19  fitness to remain in the country—is arbitrary and capricious.” Id. at 55. The Supreme \n20  Court ultimately invalidated the BIA rule because it was based on “a matter irrelevant \n21  to the alien’s fitness to reside in this country,” and concluded that the BIA therefore \n22  “has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.” Id. at 53.   \n23  Here, DHS’ March 6, 2017 decision to terminate Mr. Arreola’s DACA and \n24  EAD “automatically” because an NTA was issued against him charging presence \n25  without admission fails this test for multiple reasons. First, and fundamentally, DHS’ \n26  decision was arbitrary and irrational because a noncitizen’s deportability for presence \n27  without admission to the United States does not provide a relevant basis for \n28  terminating a DACA grant. The Napolitano Memorandum and DACA SOPs \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 17 of 28   Page ID #:88\n1  enumerate the relevant considerations for a DACA grant, and none of those rules \n2  suggests that the fact that a noncitizen is subject to removal because he is present \n3  without admission, and therefore lacks a lawful immigration status, is a basis for \n4  denial or termination. Indeed, the DACA rules indicate the opposite—the fact that a \n5  person is present without admission is irrelevant. See, e.g., DACA SOPs at 44. This is \n6  because the lack of a lawful immigration status in the United States is a predicate for \n7  eligibility for DACA and is a fact that is therefore true of every DACA recipient. Id. \n8  Because the lack of a lawful immigration status is a factor common to every single \n9  DACA recipient, and is wholly irrelevant to whether an individual is eligible for \n10  DACA, the issuance of an NTA charging presence without admission does not \n11  provide a reasoned basis for terminating DACA. \n12  Second, the program rules make clear that noncitizens who are, have been, or \n13  will be placed in removal proceedings continue to be eligible for DACA. The rules \n14  thus reinforce the conclusion that an NTA based on presence without admission to the \n15  United States does not provide a reasoned basis for termination. The Napolitano \n16  Memorandum itself requires that the eligibility “criteria are to be considered whether \n17  or not an individual is already in removal proceedings or subject to a final order of \n18  removal.” Napolitano Memo at 2. See also Kwon Decl. ¶ 17, Ex. 16 (Dougherty \n19  Statement) (“The 2012 memorandum also made clear that individuals could be \n20  considered for DACA even if they were already in removal proceedings or were \n21  subject to a final removal order.”). Implementing this command, the SOPs provide \n22  that “[i]ndividuals in removal proceedings may file a DACA request.” DACA SOPs at \n23  71. Indeed, even individuals with final removal orders can be granted DACA. See, \n24  e.g., id. at 74 (providing that individuals with final removal orders may be considered \n25  for DACA); id. at 75 (providing that an individual who has been removed after \n26  issuance of a final removal order, re-entered, and is subject to reinstatement of that \n27  removal order continues to be eligible for DACA). Cf. Matter of Quintero, 18 I. & N. \n28  Dec. 348, 350 (BIA 1982) (explaining in context of removal proceedings that “the \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 18 of 28   Page ID #:89\n1  respondent can request deferred action status at any stage in the proceeding”). Further, \n2  the DACA SOPs provide that if an NTA is issued against a DACA applicant while his \n3  application is pending with USCIS—even if the NTA is based on a public safety \n4  concern—USCIS should “proceed with adjudication . . . , taking into account the basis \n5  for the NTA.” See Kwon Decl. ¶ 22, Ex. 21 (Revised Guidance for the Referral of \n6  Cases and Issuance of Notices to Appear (NTAs) in Cases Involving Inadmissible and \n7  Removable Aliens (Nov. 7, 2011)) , at 4 ( “ICE’s issuance of an NTA allows USCIS \n8  to proceed with adjudication . . . , taking into account the basis for the NTA”); DACA \n9  SOPs at 93 (providing that if ICE accepts a case referred to it by USCIS during the \n10  DACA application process, then USCIS “will follow the standard protocols outlined \n11  in the November 7, 2011 NTA memorandum”).   \n12  In such cases, USCIS is required to review all relevant circumstances, and may \n13  grant the DACA request “[i]f a DACA requestor has been placed in proceedings on a \n14  ground that does not adversely impact the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.” \n15  DACA SOPs at 75. See also id. at 74 (providing that for DACA applicants with final \n16  removal orders, “[f]inal removal orders . . . should be reviewed carefully to examine \n17  the underlying grounds for removal”). Given that the filing of an NTA against a \n18  DACA applicant, or even the issuance of a final order of removal against a DACA \n19  applicant, does not render noncitizens ineligible for the program, DHS’ decision to \n20  find Mr. Arreola ineligible on this basis and automatically terminate his DACA is \n21  arbitrary and irrational. \n22  Third, DHS’ decision to automatically and categorically terminate Mr. \n23  Arreola’s DACA is arbitrary and capricious because the agency failed, despite Mr. \n24  Arreola’s continued eligibility for the program, to consider the relevant facts and \n25  circumstances and exercise its individualized discretion. This failure to consider Mr. \n26  Arreola’s specific circumstances undermines the very purpose of the DACA program. \n27  See Napolitano Memorandum at 2 (explaining that the purpose of DACA was to \n28  ensure that “[o]ur Nation’s immigration laws . . . . are not designed to be blindly \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 19 of 28   Page ID #:90\n1  enforced without consideration given to the individual circumstances of each case”). \n2  The agency’s failure to exercise its individualized discretion is also inconsistent with \n3  its own rules, as described above. Those rules make clear that if someone is the \n4  subject of an NTA, USCIS should consider all of the relevant circumstances, \n5  including the ground for removal charged in the NTA, to determine whether DACA is \n6  appropriate or whether the individual is disqualified. The DACA rules also make clear \n7  that when the ground in the NTA does not adversely impact a DACA grant—\n8  including, presumably, when the ground is one that all or most DACA recipients \n9  could be charged with—the individual is not disqualified from DACA. DHS’ failure \n10  to consider all the relevant circumstances and exercise its discretion is all the more \n11  problematic where, as here, prior to the decision to terminate DACA, an immigration \n12  judge had already considered and rejected the government’s allegations that Mr. \n13  Arreola had committed any criminal conduct. Cf. Villa-Anguiano v. Holder, 727 F.3d \n14  873, 881-82 (9th Cir. 2013) (explaining that “[d]ue process . . . entitles an unlawfully \n15  present alien to consideration of issues relevant to the exercise of an immigration \n16  officer’s discretion,” including “new, relevant circumstances [that] had arisen”). \n17    Fourth, USCIS’s decision to terminate DACA automatically based on the filing \n18  of an NTA was arbitrary and capricious because it left the question of whether Mr. \n19  Arreola continued to warrant a DACA grant and EAD solely up to a CBP officer’s \n20  charging decision in issuing an NTA. In Judulang, the Supreme Court emphasized \n21  that an additional reason why the BIA’s rule was impermissibly arbitrary was that \n22  under the rule, whether a noncitizen would be granted discretionary relief may “rest \n23  on the happenstance of an immigration official’s charging decision.” 565 U.S. at 57. \n24  See also id. at 58 (recognizing “the high stakes for an alien who has long resided in \n25  this country,” and noting that the Court has “reversed an agency decision that would \n26  make his right to remain here dependent on circumstances so fortuitous and \n27  capricious”) (citing Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 391 (1947)) (internal \n28  quotation marks omitted). The same is true here. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 20 of 28   Page ID #:91\n1  Finally, in terminating Mr. Arreola’s DACA grant and EAD and finding that \n2  the NTA automatically rendered him ineligible for DACA, DHS departed from its \n3  prior position without “a reasoned analysis for the change,” in violation of the APA. \n4  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983). \n5  See also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). An agency may depart from its prior decision, but it is \n6  black letter law that if it does so, it “is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the \n7  change.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 42. See also FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n8  556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (“[T]he agency must show that there are good reasons for \n9  the new policy.”). \n10  DHS’ settled position—spanning about half a decade, from 2012 to 2017, was \n11  that Mr. Arreola warrants a grant of DACA and an EAD. In 2012, 2014, and again in \n12  2016, DHS carefully evaluated Mr. Arreola’s applications for DACA and repeatedly \n13  determined that he was eligible for a grant of deferred action and an EAD. Arreola \n14  Decl. ¶¶ 10-11; Kwon Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, 23-25, Exs. 4-5, 22-24. The agency reached this \n15  conclusion after evaluating Mr. Arreola’s school records and other circumstances, as \n16  well as conducting extensive background checks. Mr. Arreola’s most recent approval \n17  notice, from 2016, provides that “[u]nless terminated, this decision to defer removal \n18  action will remain in effect for 2 years” and is valid to August 19, 2018. Arreola Decl. \n19  ¶ 12; Kwon Decl. ¶ 25, Ex. 24. The approval notice informed Mr. Arreola that his \n20  deferred action could be terminated if he engaged in “[s]ubsequent criminal activity.” \n21  Kwon Decl. ¶ 25, Ex. 24.  \n22    However, in March 2017, the agency abruptly reversed course, concluding that \n23  Mr. Arreola’s DACA and EAD should be automatically revoked. Now, as before, Mr. \n24  Arreola continues to be eligible for DACA; now, as before, Mr. Arreola has never \n25  engaged in any criminal activity or been convicted of (or even charged with) any \n26  crime. Nonetheless, in its March 6, 2017 Notice of Action, USCIS notified Mr. \n27  Arreola that his DACA and EAD were “terminated automatically” because an NTA \n28  was issued charging him with presence without admission. Kwon Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 8. \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 21 of 28   Page ID #:92\n1  USCIS’s one-sentence explanation, however, fails to acknowledge that Mr. Arreola \n2  remains eligible for DACA under the applicable criteria, much less provide “good \n3  reasons” for the agency’s change in position, as required by the APA. Fox Television \n4  Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 515. See also, e.g., Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of \n5  Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 968 (9th Cir. 2015) (explaining that the agency is “required to \n6  provide a ‘reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding’ the ‘facts and circumstances’ \n7  that underlay its previous decision”) (citations omitted). As discussed above, the vast \n8  majority of DACA recipients, like Mr. Arreola, are removable due to “presence \n9  without admission” or for overstaying a visa, and this was true of Mr. Arreola every \n10  time he applied for and received DACA. The agency’s reliance on an NTA citing Mr. \n11  Arreola’s presence without admission simply fails to explain, much less justify, the \n12  agency’s decision to reverse course and terminate his DACA. \n13    The agency’s failure to explain its decision is also invalid because it fails to \n14  mention, let alone account for, Mr. Arreola’s serious reliance interests: Mr. Arreola \n15  has lived in the United States since infancy, and has relied on DACA to build a life, \n16  obtain rewarding employment as a young adult, and help support his family, who are \n17  all United States citizens or lawful permanent residents. See Fox Television Stations, \n18  Inc., 556 U.S. at 515 (explaining that an agency must give a “more detailed \n19  justification” for a policy change if its “prior policy has engendered serious reliance \n20  interests that must be taken into account”). DHS’ failure to provide a reasoned \n21  explanation for its change in position is arbitrary and capricious. See, e.g., Organized \n22  Vill. of Kake, 795 F.3d at 967-68 (holding that the defendant agency failed to provide \n23  “good reasons” for reversing its old policy). \n24    For all these reasons, DHS’ decision to change its position and terminate Mr. \n25  Arreola’s DACA based merely on an NTA charging presence without admission was \n26  arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. \n \n27 \n \n28 \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 22 of 28   Page ID #:93\nB. DHS’ Automatic Revocation of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and EAD Violates Its \n1 \nOwn Procedures and Mr. Arreola’s Procedural Due Process Rights. \n2   \n1.  DHS’ Revocation Without Notice Violates Its Own Rules. \n3 \nDHS’ automatic termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and EAD without notice \n4 \nor an opportunity to be heard also violates DHS’ own rules and is therefore arbitrary \n5 \nand capricious. Indeed, two district courts in closely analogous cases have held that \n6 \nthe government’s failure to comply with the termination procedures in the DACA \n7 \nSOPs violates the APA. See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5 (“Defendants’ \n8 \nfailure to follow the termination procedures set forth in the DACA SOP is arbitrary, \n9 \ncapricious, and an abuse of discretion.”); Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 n.6 \n10 \n(“Defendants’ actions were likely arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA \n11 \nby . . . terminating her DACA status in contravention of DHS’s own procedures.”).  \n12 \nThe DACA SOPs provide that USCIS generally will not terminate a recipient’s \n13 \nDACA and EAD without prior notice and an opportunity to respond. See, e.g., DACA \n14 \nSOPs Chapter 14, Termination, at 136-38 (if DACA granted in error, or granted as a \n15 \nresult of fraud, officer is directed to issue a “Notice of Intent to Terminate,” allow \n16 \nrecipient “33 days to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited in [the \n17 \nnotice],” and terminate only where the adverse grounds are not overcome). See also \n18 \nColotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *7 (“[T]he SOP provides that, in the usual circumstance, \n19 \na termination of an individual’s DACA status will not occur without prior notice to \n20 \nthat individual.”). Although the DACA SOPs contain a procedure for termination of \n21 \nDACA if ICE issues an NTA, such termination is permitted only under narrow \n22 \ncircumstances involving certain public safety concerns, and only after DHS follows \n23 \nspecific procedures that did not occur here. See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, \n24 \nat *6 (finding that USCIS’ termination of DACA in response to “NTA issued by \n25 \nUSCBP in connection with removal proceedings” charging recipient with being \n26 \npresent without admission did not comply with DACA SOPs); see also DACA SOPs \n27 \nChapter 14, Termination, at 137 (enumerating procedures to be followed in cases \n28 \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 23 of 28   Page ID #:94\n1  involving disqualifying criminal offenses or public safety concerns). In sum, because \n2  Defendants wholly failed to follow their own termination procedures, the revocation \n3  of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and EAD was arbitrary and capricious. \n4   \n2.  DHS’ Automatic Revocation Violates Mr. Arreola’s Due Process \n5 \nRights.  \n6 \nIn addition to violating its own procedures, DHS’ sudden revocation of Mr. \n7 \nArreola’s DACA violates his procedural due process rights. Mr. Arreola has gained a \n8 \nprotected interest in his DACA, which authorized him to live and work in the United \n9 \nStates for the last five years and until August 2018, and therefore has a right to a fair \n10 \nprocedure before it can be revoked. Yet DHS has reversed its decision without \n11 \nproviding Mr. Arreola with adequate notice, a reasoned explanation for its decision, or \n12 \nan opportunity to present arguments and evidence to demonstrate that he remains \n13 \neligible for the program and did not engage in any disqualifying criminal activity. \n14 \n   The Constitution “imposes constraints on governmental decisions which \n15 \ndeprive individuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests.” Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. \n16 \n319, 332 (1976). Regardless of whether the individual had a claim of entitlement \n17 \nbefore it was granted, once an important benefit is conferred, recipients have a \n18 \nprotected property interest sufficient to require a fair process before the government \n19 \nmay take it away. See Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971) (holding that,“[o]nce \n20 \n[driver’s] licenses are issued, . . . their continued possession may become essential in \n21 \nthe pursuit of a livelihood,” such that they cannot “be taken away without” due \n22 \nprocess); Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972) (holding that parole \n23 \nrevocation requires due process; parolees may “have been on parole for a number of \n24 \nyears and may be living a relatively normal life[,]” all the while “[having] relied on at \n25 \nleast an implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if [the parolee] fails to live \n26 \nup to the parole conditions”); Nnebe v.

Long Beach, 951 F.2d 977 (9th Cir. 1992) (finding \n8  ordinance permitting airport to automatically reduce flights already allocated to air \n9  carriers by license violated air carriers’ due process rights where allocations were \n10  crucial to enterprise); Jones v. City of Modesto, 408 F. Supp. 2d 935, 951 (E.D. Cal. \n11  2005) (finding that city could not revoke existing massage license without due \n12  process) (citing Greenwood v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 28 F.3d 971, 975 (9th Cir. 1994) \n13  (“The Ninth Circuit specifically recognized that an existing license, in contrast to an \n14  applied for license, constitutes a legitimate entitlement of which one cannot be \n15  deprived without due process.”)). In continuing to build his life in the United States, \n16  Mr. Arreola has reasonably relied on the implicit promise that he could retain his \n17  DACA grant and EAD so long as he satisfied the program’s eligibility requirements. \n18  See Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 482. The government’s reversal of its previous decision \n19  that he was eligible for and warranted DACA inflicts precisely the kind of “serious \n20  loss” that requires due process protections. Mathews, 424 U.S. at 348 (internal \n21  quotation marks omitted). \n22  Determining the procedure necessary to meet constitutional standards requires \n23  evaluation of three distinct factors:  \n \n24 \nFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; \nsecond, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the \n25 \nprocedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or \nsubstitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, \n26 \nincluding the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens \nthat the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.   \n27 \nId. at 335.  \n28 \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 25 of 28   Page ID #:96\n1  Evaluation of these factors demonstrates that Mr. Arreola must be afforded at \n2  least the pre-termination process that DHS generally provides for under its own \n3  rules—i.e., adequate notice of the allegedly adverse grounds and an opportunity to \n4  respond and contest the decision. The private interest at stake for Mr. Arreola could \n5  not be more significant. The termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA rescinds his \n6  longstanding authorization to live and work in the United States—the country he has \n7  called home since he was an infant. Instead of following its own prescribed process, \n8  DHS terminated Mr. Arreola’s DACA suddenly and without notice, based solely on \n9  CBP’s issuance of an NTA charging him with being present without admission. Nor \n10  has DHS afforded him any opportunity to contest its action, creating an unacceptably \n11  high risk—in Mr. Arreola’s case, a certainty—of erroneous deprivation. See Singh v. \n12  Vasquez, No. 08-cv-1901, 2009 WL 3219266, at *5 (D. Ariz. Sept. 30, 2009), aff’d, \n13  448 F. App’x 776 (9th Cir. 2011) (“[T]here is a substantial risk of erroneous \n14  deprivation through the procedures utilized by INS in rescinding asylum via a mailed \n15  letter. This manner of termination does not account for anything other than post hoc \n16  notice that . . . he or she is no longer entitled to protection.”). Providing Mr. Arreola \n17  with a reasoned explanation for the government’s actions and an opportunity to \n18  present arguments and evidence could make all the difference in his case, because it \n19  will allow him to demonstrate that CBP’s suspicions were mistaken, as the \n20  government’s own immigration judge concluded, and that he has not engaged in any \n21  disqualifying criminal activity (or even been charged with any crime) and remains \n22  eligible for DACA. Mr. Arreola’s circumstances highlight the value of the “an \n23  opportunity to contest the termination determination at a meaningful time.” Villa-\n24  Anguiano, 727 F.3d at 882. See also id.at 881 (holding that the BIA “must consider all \n25  favorable and unfavorable factors relevant to the exercise of its discretion; failure to \n26  do so constitutes an abuse of discretion”). The fact that DHS’ rules already provide for \n27  these basic pre-deprivation protections in most circumstances reinforces both that the \n28  value of such safeguards is high, and that providing such limited process would not \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 26 of 28   Page ID #:97\n1  place undue fiscal or administrative burdens on the government. Vasquez, 2009 WL \n2  3219266, at *6 (“To conclude, all of the Mathews factors weigh in favor of a finding \n3  that due process requires more than sending an after the fact letter of rescission when \n4  the government terminates a grant of asylum.”).  \n5  II.  MR. ARREOLA IS SUFFERING IRREPARABLE HARM. \n6  Absent an injunction restoring Mr. Arreola’s DACA, he will continue to \n7  experience irreparable harm that cannot be cured by his ultimate success on the merits \n8  in this case.   \n9  The revocation of Mr. Arreola’s DACA has derailed Mr. Arreola’s career. The \n10  Ninth Circuit has made clear that the “loss of opportunity to pursue [one’s] chosen \n11  profession” constitutes irreparable harm. Enyart v. Nat’l Conference of Bar Exam’rs, \n12  Inc., 630 F.3d 1153, 1165 (9th Cir. 2011); see also Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. \n13  Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 543 (1985) (“We have frequently recognized the severity of \n14  depriving a person of the means of livelihood.”).  Because he has lost his EAD, Mr. \n15  Arreola has had to leave his job as a cook at Chateau Marmont, and because CBP took \n16  possession of his car, he has been unable to work as a driver. Arreola Decl. ¶ 40. Such \n17  harm is more than enough to justify an injunction in this circuit. In Arizona Dream Act \n18  Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir. 2014), for example, the Ninth Circuit \n19  reversed a district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction on harm grounds, and \n20  held that the DACA recipients had established irreparable harm because the \n21  defendants’ policy had “diminished [plaintiffs’] opportunity to pursue their chosen \n22  professions.”  Id. at 1068. See also Enyart, 630 F.3d at 1165; Gonzalez Torres, 2017 \n23  WL 4340385, at *6 (finding that irreparable harm caused by defendants’ termination \n24  of DACA without notice “includes the loss of employment, a core benefit under \n25  DACA” and that such “deprivation of employment impacts Plaintiff’s ability to \n26  financially provide for himself and his family”). Moreover, setbacks at this early \n27  moment in Mr. Arreola’s career may never be recoverable: before he lost his job at the \n28  Chateau Marmont, Mr. Arreola expected to move up through the ranks. Arreola Decl. \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 27 of 28   Page ID #:98\n1  ¶¶ 14, 41. Time without DACA is “productive time irretrievably lost” that Mr. Arreola \n2  could be spending in his chosen career path, building toward the future for himself \n3  and his family. Chalk v. U.S. Dist. Ct., 840 F.2d 701, 710 (9th Cir.1988). See also \n4  Arizona Dream Act Coal., 757 F.3d at 1069 (“The irreparable nature of Plaintiffs’ \n5  injury is heightened by Plaintiffs’ young age and fragile socioeconomic position. \n6  Setbacks early in their careers are likely to haunt Plaintiffs for the rest of their lives.”). \n7  As it is, Mr. Arreola is unable to plan for his family or save to provide for his child. \n8  Arreola Decl. ¶ 40. Even if Mr. Arreola could later recover his lost income, his \n9  emotional distress in the interim constitutes an irreparable injury in itself. See Arreola \n10  Decl. ¶ 40; Chalk, 840 F.2d at 709. See also Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 \n11  (“Plaintiff’s emotional distress . . . is another factor in determining that Plaintiff will \n12  suffer irreparable injury without the entry of a preliminary injunction.”). \n13  III.  THE REMAINING FACTORS SUPPORT PRELIMINARY RELIEF. \n14  Preliminary relief will not harm the government. The government will not be \n15  adversely affected by restoring Mr. Arreola’s DACA, since he remains eligible for the \n16  program, the government’s own immigration judge found that the CBP’s allegations \n17  against him were unfounded, and there has been no relevant change in circumstances. \n18  By contrast, the public interest strongly favors a preliminary injunction. The \n19  public interest is served when the government complies with its obligations under the \n20  APA and the Constitution and follows its own procedures. As the Ninth Circuit has \n21  emphasized, “[I]t is clear that it would not be equitable or in the public’s interest to \n22  allow the state ... to violate the requirements of federal law, especially when there are \n23  no adequate remedies available.” Arizona Dream Act Coal., 757 F.3d at 1068 (citation \n24  and internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration and ellipsis in original). See also \n25  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[I]t is always in the public \n26  interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.”) (citation and \n27  internal quotation marks omitted); Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 (“[T]he public \n28  has an interest in government agencies being required to comply with their own \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 16-2   Filed 10/18/17   Page 28 of 28   Page ID #:99\n1  written guidelines instead of engaging in arbitrary decision making.”). Further, \n2  stripping Mr. Arreola of his profession and his family is not in the public interest. Mr. \n3  Arreola’s family relies on him heavily. He plays a critical role in the care of his sister \n4  who has serious disabilities, and he contributes to the support of his family. Arreola \n5  Decl. ¶¶ 4-5, 16. He was also a valued employee at the Chateau Marmont. Id. ¶¶ 14, \n6  40-41. \n7  CONCLUSION \n8  For the reasons given, the Court should grant Plaintiff’s Motion for a \n9  Preliminary Injunction, vacate Defendants’ unlawful revocation of Plaintiff’s DACA \n10  and EAD or, in the alternative, order Defendants to temporarily reinstate Mr. \n11  Arreola’s DACA and work authorization pending a fair procedure—including \n12  reasonable notice, a reasoned explanation, and an opportunity to be heard—through \n13  which he may challenge the revocation decision consistent with the APA and the Due \n14  Process Clause.  \n15   \n16  Dated: October 18, 2017     Respectfully submitted, \n \n17 \n/s/ Jennifer Chang Newell \n18  Jennifer Chang Newell \nKatrina L.

President Trump has said that “dreamers should rest easy,”1 yet his \n3  administration has placed these young immigrants, who came to the United States as \n4  children, directly at risk. Since 2012, the federal government’s Deferred Action for \n5  Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program has provided temporary protection from \n6  deportation (known as “deferred action”) and authorization to work in the United \n7  States for nearly 800,000 young immigrants.2 Now, not only is President Trump \n8  sunsetting the protections provided to these immigrant youth under DACA, but his \n9  Administration is eroding the strength of those protections even while the program \n10  winds down. On his watch, federal immigration authorities have targeted numerous \n11  DACA recipients and unlawfully revoked the grants of deferred action and work \n12  permits they have received even though these individuals have abided by all the \n13  program rules and have not engaged in any conduct that would disqualify them from \n14  the program. This lawsuit challenges these unlawful revocation practices. \n15  2.  For over half a decade, the DACA program has provided permission to live and \n16  work in the United States for these young people who have known no other country as \n17  home. The DACA program has allowed these talented young immigrants to come out \n18  of the shadows, obtain higher education, begin their careers, and contribute more fully \n19  to their communities. To establish eligibility for the program, DACA recipients must \n20  undergo extensive background checks, in addition to meeting multiple other stringent \n21 \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n1 Transcript of AP Interview with President Trump, Associated Press, Apr. 23, \n24  2017, https://apnews.com/c810d7de280a47e88848b0ac74690c83. \n2 See U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., Number of I-821D, Consideration of \n25 \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals by Fiscal Year, Quarter, Intake, Biometrics \n26  and Case Status: Fiscal Year 2012-2017 (June 30, 2017), \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studie\n27 \ns/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca_performance\n28  data_fy2017_qtr3.pdf. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 4 of 48   Page ID #:725\n1  criteria. Noncitizens granted DACA are eligible to receive employment authorization \n2  and a Social Security Number.3 \n3  3.  As former President Obama explained when first announcing the DACA \n4  program, these young people “are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every \n5  single way but one: on paper.”4 President Obama recognized that “it makes no sense” \n6  to deport these “young people who study in our schools, . . . play in our \n7  neighborhoods, [are] friends with our kids, [and] pledge allegiance to our flag.”5   \n8  4.  Despite the critically important interests at stake once an individual has \n9  received a grant of DACA, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has a \n10  practice of unlawfully and arbitrarily revoking DACA grants and work authorization \n11  based (apparently) on alleged conduct or minor criminal history that does not \n12  disqualify the individual from the program—including mere arrests or charges that are \n13  later resolved in the individual’s favor. As a result, many young noncitizens who grew \n14  up in this country have had their permission to remain and ability to work stripped \n15  away from them, instantaneously losing their ability to support themselves and their \n16  families, even though they have done nothing to change their eligibility for DACA. \n17  5.  Because of the government’s unlawful practices, other young immigrants across \n18  the country are at likewise at risk of wrongfully losing their DACA protections. \n19  6.  Plaintiff Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective (“IEIYC”) is a grassroots \n20  organization based in Ontario, California, that serves the immigrant community in the \n21  Inland Empire region by engaging in outreach and advocacy. IEIYC has multiple \n22                                             \n3 See Frequently Asked Questions, DHS DACA FAQs, U.S. Citizenship & \n23 \nImmigration Servs., https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-\n24  action-childhood-arrivals-process/frequently-asked-questions (hereinafter “USCIS \nDACA FAQs”). \n25 \n4 President Barack Obama, Remarks on Immigration Reform and Exchange with \n26  Reporters, 2012 DAILY COMP. PRES. DOC. 1 (June 15, 2012),  \nhttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/15/remarks-president-\n27 \nimmigration. \n28  5 Id. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 5 of 48   Page ID #:726\n1  members whose lives have been changed by DACA, which has made it possible for \n2  them to pursue their education and careers, contribute to their communities, and \n3  achieve economic stability. Like hundreds of thousands of other immigrants, IEIYC’s \n4  members have relied on the promises made by the federal government in the DACA \n5  program. However, because of the government’s arbitrary revocation practices, \n6  IEIYC’s members fear that their DACA grants and work permits could be unlawfully \n7  terminated. \n8  7.  Plaintiff Jesús Alonso Arreola Robles (“Arreola”) is a 23-year-old resident of \n9  the Los Angeles area whose DACA grant and work permit was terminated without \n10  any process. He has known the United States as his only home since he was just one \n11  year old. DHS found him eligible for and granted him DACA in 2012, 2014, and \n12  again in 2016. At the time that DHS terminated his DACA, Mr. Arreola was working \n13  two jobs to help support his family—one as a cook at the famed Chateau Marmont in \n14  West Hollywood, and one as a driver for Uber and Lyft. Mr. Arreola’s earnings \n15  helped support his parents, both of whom are lawful permanent residents, and his \n16  three U.S. citizen sisters—one of whom has significant disabilities. \n17  8.  Despite his valid DACA grant and lack of any criminal history, federal \n18  immigration authorities arrested Mr. Arreola in February 2017 while he was driving a \n19  customer; falsely alleged that he was trying to help his customer smuggle people into \n20  the United States; and placed him in removal proceedings. Even though an \n21  immigration judge promptly rejected the smuggling allegation, and he was never \n22  charged with any crime, DHS nonetheless revoked his DACA grant and employment \n23  authorization.  Although this Court issued a preliminary injunction on November 20, \n24  2017, enjoining the government’s termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and \n25  employment authorization, the government has now indicated that it intends to \n26  terminate his DACA again, even though he remains eligible under the DACA program \n27  rules.  The government is targeting Mr. Arreola as an “enforcement priority,” even \n28 \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 6 of 48   Page ID #:727\n1  though, because he is eligible for DACA, he is by definition a low priority under the \n2  DACA rules. \n3  9.  Like Mr. Arreola, Plaintiffs José Eduardo Gil Robles (“Gil”) and Ronan Carlos \n4  De Souza Moreira (“Moreira”) had their DACA grants and employment authorization \n5  documents abruptly stripped from them, without any notice or opportunity to respond, \n6  even though they had not done anything to disqualify themselves from the program.  \n7  Plaintiffs Arreola, Gil, and Moreira are just a few of the many young immigrants who \n8  have had their DACA suddenly and unlawfully cut off.   \n9  10.  The government’s practice of terminating DACA, apparently based on \n10  unsubstantiated allegations or minor criminal history, even though the individual has \n11  never engaged in any disqualifying conduct, violates the federal Administrative \n12  Procedure Act (“APA”) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the \n13  U.S. Constitution. Individual Plaintiffs Arreola, Gil, and Moreira (hereinafter \n14  collectively, “Individual Plaintiffs”), on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class \n15  of others similarly situated, respectfully request that this Court: declare the \n16  government’s revocation practices unlawful; order that the government vacate and \n17  enjoin the revocation of the Individual Plaintiffs’ DACA grants and employment \n18  authorization, as well as those of class members who have suffered unlawful \n19  revocation; order the government to accept renewal applications from Individual \n20  Plaintiffs and class members; and enjoin the government from revoking DACA grants \n21  and work authorization pursuant to its unlawful policies and practices in the future. \n22  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n23  11.  Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343, and the APA, 5 \n24  U.S.C. § 702. \n25  12.  Declaratory and injunctive relief are available pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-\n26  2202 and the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-703. \n27  13.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Defendants \n28  Kirstjen Nielsen, James McCament, Mark J. Hazuda, Susan M. Curda, Thomas D. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 7 of 48   Page ID #:728\n1  Homan, David Marin, and Kevin K. McAleenan are Officers of the United States \n2  acting in their official capacities, and DHS, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n3  Services (“USCIS”), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), and U.S. \n4  Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) are agencies of the United States. \n5  Additionally, Plaintiffs Arreola and IEIYC, as well as Defendants Susan M. Curda \n6  and David Marin, all reside in this judicial district. \n7  14.  In addition, numerous DACA recipients similarly situated to the Individual \n8  Plaintiffs, and who are members of the proposed class, reside in this district. With \n9  over 200,000 DACA recipients residing in the state, California has the most DACA \n10  recipients of any state in the country. \n11  PARTIES \n12  15.  Plaintiff Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective is a grassroots, \n13  immigrant youth-led organization located in Ontario, California. Since 2010, the \n14  organization has served the undocumented immigrant community in the Inland \n15  Empire and has sought to empower those most impacted by immigration policy \n16  through outreach and policy advocacy. The majority of IEIYC’s active membership \n17  are current DACA recipients who depend on having DACA to attend school, build \n18  their careers, and participate in IEIYC’s work throughout Riverside and San \n19  Bernardino Counties.  \n20  16.  Plaintiff Jesús Alonso Arreola Robles is a 23-year-old resident of the Los \n21  Angeles area. He was brought to the United States from Mexico in 1995, when he was \n22  one year old, and has lived in the United States ever since. From August 2012 to \n23  August 2018, federal immigration authorities granted Mr. Arreola permission to live \n24  and work in the United States pursuant to the DACA program. In February 2017, \n25  however, Defendants terminated his DACA grant and employment authorization \n26  without notice or an opportunity to be heard, and without any opportunity for \n27  reinstatement.  Mr. Arreola’s DACA grant was revoked even though he remains \n28 \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 8 of 48   Page ID #:729\n1  eligible for the program and has never been convicted of any disqualifying criminal \n2  offense. \n3  17.  Plaintiff José Eduardo Gil Robles is 24-year-old resident of Coon Rapids, \n4  Minnesota, near Minneapolis. He has lived in the United States since he was five \n5  years old, when he entered the country from Mexico. From August 2015 to August \n6  2019, federal immigration authorities granted Mr. Gil permission to live and work in \n7  the United States pursuant to the DACA program. In November 2017, however, \n8  Defendants terminated his DACA grant and employment authorization without notice \n9  or an opportunity to be heard, and without any opportunity for reinstatement. Mr. \n10  Gil’s DACA grant was revoked even though he remains eligible for the program and \n11  has never been convicted of any disqualifying criminal offense. \n12  18.  Plaintiff Ronan Carlos De Souza Moreira is a 24-year-old resident of \n13  Kennesaw, Georgia, near Atlanta.

On June 15, 2012, then-DHS Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano \n4  issued a memorandum establishing the DACA program (the “2012 DACA \n5  Memorandum”).6 Under the DACA framework, individuals who were brought to the \n6  United States as children and meet certain specific criteria may request deferred action \n7  for a renewable period of two years. In exchange, DACA applicants are required to \n8  provide the government with highly sensitive personal information, submit to a \n9  rigorous background check, and pay a considerable fee.  \n10  27.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum explained that DACA covers “certain young \n11  people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as \n12  home” and that the immigration laws are not “designed to remove productive young \n13  people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language.”7 \n14  28.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum established the following criteria for \n15  individuals to be eligible for DACA. The applicant must: \n16  •  have come to the United States before the age of sixteen;  \n17  •  have resided continuously in the United States for at least five years preceding \n18  the date of the memorandum and been present in the United States on the date \n19  of the memorandum;  \n20  •  be currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a \n21  general education development certificate, or be an honorably discharged \n22  veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States;  \n23 \n24                                             \n6 Memorandum from Secretary Janet Napolitano, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion \n25 \nwith Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children (June 15, \n26  2012), https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-\nindividuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf (hereinafter “2012 DACA \n27 \nMemorandum”). \n28  7 Id. \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 11 of 48   Page ID #:732\n1  •  have not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, \n2  or multiple misdemeanor offenses;  \n3  •  not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety; and  \n4  •  not be above the age of thirty as of June 15, 2012.8  \n5  29.  USCIS describes DACA as a form of deferred action, “a discretionary \n6  determination to defer a removal action of an individual as an act of prosecutorial \n7  discretion . . . . An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS \n8  to be present in the United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be lawfully \n9  present during the period deferred action is in effect.”9  \n10  30.  Because of the possibility that many DACA-eligible individuals might be \n11  reluctant to voluntarily disclose information that could help facilitate their removal \n12  from the United States, DHS repeatedly promised applicants that the information they \n13  provided as part of the DACA application process would “not later be used for \n14  immigration enforcement purposes.”10 \n15  31.  To apply for DACA, applicants must submit extensive documentation \n16  establishing that they meet the above-mentioned criteria.11  \n17  32.  Applicants must submit a Form I-765 Application for Employment \n18  Authorization, and pay hundreds of dollars in fees.12 If work authorization is granted, \n19  DACA recipients are issued federal employment authorization documents (“EADs”), \n20  and can apply for a Social Security Number.   \n21  33.  DACA applicants must also undergo biometric and biographic background \n22  checks. When conducting these checks, DHS reviews the applicant’s biometric and \n23 \n                                           \n24  8 Id. \n9 USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 1.   \n25 \n10 Letter from Secretary Jeh Charles Johnson to Rep. Judy Chu (Dec. 30, 2016), \n26  https://chu.house.gov/sites/chu.house.gov/files/documents/DHS.Signed%20Response\n%20to%20Chu%2012.30.16.pdf. \n27 \n11 USCIS DACA FAQs, Questions 28–41. \n28  12 USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 7.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 12 of 48   Page ID #:733\n1  biographic information “against a variety of databases maintained by DHS and other \n2  federal government agencies.”13 If any information “indicates that [the applicant’s] \n3  presence in the United States threatens public safety or national security,” the \n4  applicant will be ineligible for DACA absent “exceptional circumstances.”14 Under \n5  the DACA program, deferred action is available for a period of two years, subject to \n6  renewal.  \n7  34.  A decision to grant or deny a DACA application or renewal is separate and \n8  independent from any removal proceedings in immigration court. A noncitizen who is \n9  in removal proceedings can apply for DACA separately and simultaneously.15 If that \n10  application is granted, the removal proceedings continue unless the immigration judge \n11  closes or terminates the proceedings. Further, an immigration judge has no power to \n12  grant or deny DACA, or to review or reverse USCIS’ decision to deny DACA. \n13  35.  DACA recipients are eligible to receive certain benefits. These include Social \n14  Security, retirement, and disability benefits, and, in certain states, benefits such as \n15  driver’s licenses or unemployment insurance.16 \n16  36.  DACA also confers other advantages. For example, DACA recipients do not \n17  accrue unlawful presence under Section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) of the Immigration and \n18  Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i), which could otherwise bar an \n19  individual from adjusting to lawful permanent resident status in the future.17 \n20  37.  The DACA program has been a huge success, allowing nearly 800,000 young \n21  people to go to school, advance in their careers, and serve their communities. In \n22  California alone, over 220,000 young people have benefitted from DACA. \n23 \n24 \n                                           \n25 \n13 USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 23. \n26  14 USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 65. \n15 2012 DACA Memorandum at 2. \n27 \n16 See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)–(3), 1621(d). \n28  17 USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 5.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 13 of 48   Page ID #:734\n1  38.  DACA’s benefits to young immigrants and the U.S. economy have been \n2  remarkable, as reported by a recent survey of DACA recipients.18 According to the \n3  survey: \n \n4 \n•  91 percent of respondents were employed, including at top Fortune 500 \n5  companies such as Walmart, Apple, General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan \nChase, Home Depot, and Wells Fargo.  \n6   \n•  The average hourly wage of respondents increased by 69 percent since \n7 \nreceiving DACA; 69 percent of survey respondents responded that their \n8 \nincreased earnings had “helped me become financially independent” and 71 \npercent responded that their increased earnings had “helped my family \n9 \nfinancially.” These higher wages increased tax revenues and economic growth \n10 \nat the local, state, and federal levels.  \n \n11 \n•  16 percent of respondents purchased their first home after receiving DACA, \n12  leading to broader positive economic effects such as job creation and the \ninfusion of new spending in local economies.  \n13 \n \n14  •  94 percent reported that, because of DACA, they were able to pursue \neducational opportunities they could not have pursued otherwise.  \n15 \nAnother study found that, altogether, DACA recipients stood to contribute more than \n16 \n$460 billion to the gross domestic product over the next ten years.19 \n17 \n39.  Not only has the program resulted in huge benefits to the American economy, \n18 \nbut in addition, more than 86 percent of Americans support allowing DACA recipients \n19 \nto remain in the United States.20 \n20 \n                                           \n21 \n18 Tom K.

After President Trump took office, his Administration continued the DACA \n2  program for more than seven months. From January to September 2017, USCIS \n3  continued to process and grant more than 250,000 new DACA applications and \n4  applications for renewals. \n5  The Rescission of the DACA Program \n6  41.  Notwithstanding the success of the DACA program and the public’s \n7  overwhelming support for it, DHS announced on September 5, 2017, that it was \n8  rescinding the DACA program and winding it down. \n9  42.  Current DACA recipients will maintain their deferred action grants and work \n10  permits until they expire. DHS will not consider new applications for DACA dated \n11  after September 5, 2017. In addition, certain individuals were eligible for two-year \n12  renewals. Individuals with a DACA grant expiring between September 5, 2017, and \n13  March 5, 2018, could apply for a two-year renewal if the application was received by \n14  October 5, 2017. Individuals whose DACA expires on or after March 6, 2018 will not \n15  have an opportunity to renew.21 \n16  43.  All DACA grants are expected to expire by the spring of 2020. In the \n17  meantime, hundreds of thousands of young immigrants will continue to benefit from \n18  grants of DACA and work authorization for varying lengths of time as the program \n19  winds down. \n20  44.  Although the program is sunsetting, the Administration has confirmed on \n21  September 8, via Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, that “[d]uring this six-\n22  month time, there are no changes that are being made to the program at this point.”22 \n                                                                                                                                             \n23 \nstrong-support-for-dreamers/2017/09/24/df3c885c-a16f-11e7-b14f-\n24  f41773cd5a14_story.html?utm_term=.cea6f0719cc6. \n21 Memorandum from Acting Secretary Elaine C.

Mr. Arreola was born in Mexico in May of 1994 and was brought to the United \n4  States by his parents in 1995, when he was only one year old. They entered without \n5  being inspected at a border crossing. He has lived in the United States continuously \n6  since his arrival—indeed, this country is the only place he can call home. \n7  46.  Mr. Arreola attended and graduated from Los Angeles-area schools. He \n8  graduated from Lankershim Elementary School in 2005, Walter Reed Middle School \n9  in 2008, and East Valley High School in 2012. Mr. Arreola also attended a year of \n10  college at Glendale Community College, but could not continue his studies as he had \n11  to work full-time to help financially support his family. \n12  47.  In addition to his parents, Mr. Arreola has three younger sisters, who are all \n13  U.S. citizens by birth. His oldest sister is seventeen years old. Since birth, she has had \n14  progeria, autism, Down’s syndrome, and diabetes, and requires special care, around \n15  the clock, from her family members.   \n16  48.  Mr. Arreola has played a critical role in caring for his sister, including checking \n17  her blood; giving her insulin shots; helping her move around the house; and driving \n18  her to the hospital when she needs medical care. He also does everything he can to \n19  help her feel “normal,” comfortable, and loved.  \n20  49.  Although Mr. Arreola’s parents entered the United States without inspection, \n21  they now have lawful permanent resident status, having obtained immigration relief in \n22  the form of cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b). \n23  50.  Mr. Arreola is the only member of his family without permanent lawful \n24  immigration status in the United States. \n25 \n26 \n                                                                                                                                             \n27 \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/08/press-briefing-press-\n28  secretary-sarah-sanders-and-homeland-security. \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 16 of 48   Page ID #:737\n1  Mr. Arreola’s Grant and Renewals of DACA \n2  51.  Based on the government’s assurances that confidential information would not \n3  be used to remove DACA recipients, Mr. Arreola first applied for deferred action and \n4  employment authorization pursuant to DACA in August 2012. As part of this process, \n5  Mr. Arreola provided the government with his school records and information about \n6  where he lived. He was also required to attend a biometrics appointment so that \n7  USCIS could take his fingerprints and photographs.  \n8  52.  Mr. Arreola was granted DACA and work authorization on September 26, \n9  2012. Mr. Arreola’s initial DACA grant remained in effect for two years, until \n10  September 25, 2014. \n11  53.  In 2014 and again in 2016, Mr. Arreola reapplied for DACA, and each time was \n12  granted deferred action and work authorization after being subject to rigorous vetting. \n13  As part of this process, the government sent Mr. Arreola approval notices informing \n14  him that his request for deferred action had been granted.   \n15  54.  Mr. Arreola’s 2016 approval notice provides that “[u]nless terminated, this \n16  decision to defer removal action will remain in effect for 2 years” and is valid until \n17  August 19, 2018. The approval notice informed Mr. Arreola that his deferred action \n18  could be terminated if he engaged in “[s]ubsequent criminal activity.” \n19  55.  Since he was granted DACA, Mr. Arreola has used his work authorization to \n20  help his family by working two jobs. Starting in approximately 2013, he worked at the \n21  Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, first as a dishwasher and then as a cook. In \n22  April 2016, he also began working as a driver for Uber and Lyft.   \n23  56.  The money Mr. Arreola obtained from these jobs helped his family in many \n24  ways. Mr. Arreola shared his earnings and paid half the rent for the family home.  \n25  57.  Until his DACA grant and employment authorization were unlawfully revoked, \n26  Mr. Arreola had been a model employee at the Chateau Marmont and a successful \n27  driver for Uber and Lyft. \n28  58.  Mr. Arreola has never been charged with or convicted of any crime. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 17 of 48   Page ID #:738\n1  Mr. Arreola’s Arrest and Detention \n2  59.  As a driver, Mr. Arreola regularly provided rides to customers for a fee, both \n3  through the Uber and Lyft apps and through referrals from friends. On February 11, \n4  2017, a friend offered Mr. Arreola $600 to drive his cousin from the Los Angeles area \n5  to the San Diego area to pick up the friend’s uncle and another cousin, and bring them \n6  back to the Los Angeles area. \n7  60.  Mr. Arreola agreed to the long-distance ride and picked up his customer—his \n8  friend’s cousin—in Sun Valley near North Hollywood. The customer entered an \n9  address near San Diego into Mr. Arreola’s GPS and told him to drive to that location.  \n10  Being unfamiliar with the San Diego area, Mr. Arreola did not know anything about \n11  the destination address and merely followed the GPS instructions. \n12  61.  After driving for about three and a half hours, Mr. Arreola and his customer \n13  reached the destination either late in the evening on February 11, 2017 or early the \n14  next morning.    \n15  62.  His customer told Mr. Arreola to stop the car and wait while he went to get the \n16  uncle and cousin.  \n17  63.  The customer exited the car and walked toward a figure who was standing in \n18  the dark, who he apparently thought was the uncle. Instead of the uncle, that \n19  individual was a CBP agent. The CBP agent arrested the customer. \n20  64.  Although Mr. Arreola informed the CBP agent that he had been granted DACA \n21  and had permission to live and work in the United States, the CBP agent also arrested \n22  Mr. Arreola, apparently suspecting that he was aiding in smuggling individuals into \n23  the United States. \n24  65.  The CBP agent brought Mr. Arreola to Forest Gate Processing Center in \n25  Campo, California, where Mr. Arreola’s property was confiscated, including his car \n26  and cell phone. \n27  66.  Mr. Arreola was subsequently detained and questioned by another CBP agent.  \n28  Mr. Arreola also informed that CBP agent of his valid DACA grant. \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 18 of 48   Page ID #:739\n1  67.  The CBP agent questioned Mr. Arreola about his trip. Mr. Arreola explained \n2  that he was a driver, and that he had been offered $600 to pick up his friend’s uncle \n3  and cousin near the San Diego area and drive them back to the Los Angeles area. Mr. \n4  Arreola explained that he had never met his customer before that day.  \n5  68.  Mr. Arreola did not know the immigration status of his friend’s uncle and \n6  cousin whom he was supposed to pick up. As a driver, it was not Mr. Arreola’s \n7  practice to ask about the immigration status of the individuals to whom he gave rides. \n8  69.  Nonetheless, the CBP agents refused to release Mr. Arreola from custody. \n9  70.  Instead, on February 12, 2017, CBP issued Mr. Arreola a Notice to Appear \n10  (“NTA”), initiating removal proceedings against him and charging him as removable \n11  because he was present in the United States without admission under INA \n12  § 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). \n13  71.  Mr. Arreola was never charged with any smuggling-related crime or any \n14  smuggling-related ground of removability. \n15  72.  For the first two days of his detention, Mr. Arreola was not allowed to make a \n16  phone call. His family had no knowledge of his whereabouts and became very worried \n17  about him. Subsequently, Mr. Arreola was transferred to multiple detention centers in \n18  California, Arizona, and Georgia, eventually ending up in Folkston, Georgia—nearly \n19  2,500 miles away from his home. \n20  73.  On March 2, 2017, Mr. Arreola finally received a bond hearing before an \n21  immigration judge. During the bond hearing, the ICE attorney questioned Mr. Arreola \n22  at length regarding the circumstances that led to his arrest by CBP. The ICE attorney \n23  suggested that Mr. Arreola was a danger to the community because he attempted to \n24  smuggle people into the United States. \n25  74.  At the hearing, Mr. Arreola testified that he was a driver for Uber and Lyft, and \n26  that he was offered $600 by his friend to pick up his friend’s uncle and cousin near the \n27  San Diego area and drive them back to the Los Angeles area. He further testified that \n28  he had no knowledge of the immigration status of the individuals he was supposed to \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 19 of 48   Page ID #:740\n1  pick up, and denied the ICE attorney’s allegations that he was involved with \n2  smuggling. \n3  75.  The immigration judge rejected the ICE attorney’s arguments, found Mr. \n4  Arreola credible, determined that he is not a flight risk or danger to the community, \n5  and ordered Mr. Arreola’s release on $2,500 bond. \n6  76.  The immigration judge stated that he was “not going to accept the conclusions” \n7  by the CBP agents that Mr. Arreola was involved in “smuggling aliens for financial \n8  gains.” The immigration judge observed that Mr. Arreola is “an Uber and Lyft driver.  \n9  He’s in Hollywood, some three, three and a half hours away. Somebody is going to \n10  pay him to go all that way and come back.” The immigration judge added that the \n11  CBP agents made the incorrect “assumption that [Mr. Arreola] was being paid to \n12  smuggle” the uncle and cousin “as opposed to pick up a fare, what would have been a \n13  lucrative fare.”  \n14  77.  On March 3, 2017, Mr. Arreola posted bond and was released from detention. \n15  Mr. Arreola was detained a total of 21 days. He has been living in the Los Angeles \n16  area since being released.  \nTermination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA Grant and Employment \n17 \nAuthorization \n18 \n78.  On March 6, 2017, Mr. Arreola received a Notice of Action from USCIS \n19 \nnotifying him that his DACA and EAD were “terminated automatically as of the date \n20 \n[his Notice to Appear] was issued.”23 The Notice of Action states that an “appeal or \n21 \nmotion to reopen/reconsider this notice of action may not be filed.” \n22 \n79.  Mr. Arreola was never provided with any prior notice that Defendants intended \n23 \nto terminate his DACA and EAD, nor was he provided any opportunity to respond to \n24 \nsuch a notice or otherwise contest the termination of his DACA or EAD. Neither was \n25 \nhe provided with a reasoned explanation for the decision. \n26                                             \n23 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs., Notice of Action to Jesus Alonso Arreola \n27 \nRobles Re I-821D, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Mar. 6, 2017) (hereinafter \n28  “Notice of Action”) (emphasis added). \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 20 of 48   Page ID #:741\n1  80.  Defendants failed to provide Mr. Arreola with any notice or process even \n2  though the DACA program rules, including the Standard Operating Procedures \n3  (“SOPs”) that govern the DACA program, require that advance notice and an \n4  opportunity to respond be provided in most termination cases. Further, although the \n5  SOPs envision certain circumstances in which terminations might occur without \n6  notice, Defendants failed even to follow the procedures governing such terminations. \n7  81.  On March 17, 2017, Mr. Arreola’s counsel submitted a letter to USCIS \n8  requesting that USCIS reopen and reconsider the termination of his DACA and EAD.  \n9  82.  On May 9, 2017, USCIS responded, declining to revisit the issue. USCIS stated \n10  that, among other things, that “when ICE issues and serves the Notice to Appear on \n11  the DACA requestor during the DACA validity period, that action alone terminates \n12  the DACA. USCIS will send a Notice of Action and update our system as Deferred \n13  Action Terminated but that is only as a follow up to ICE’s action of termination.”  \n14  However, Mr. Arreola’s NTA was issued by CBP, not ICE. \n15  83.  Mr. Arreola has suffered significant and irreparable harm as a result of \n16  Defendants’ actions. After his 21-day detention and subsequent release, Mr. Arreola \n17  was unable to fully piece his life back together. After Mr. Arreola lost his DACA and \n18  work authorization, he lost his job with Chateau Marmont, and was no longer able to \n19  work as a driver for Lyft or Uber. \n20  84.  The revocation of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and work permit was particularly \n21  difficult for him given that he and his long-term partner recently had their first child. \n22  Because of Defendants’ actions, Mr. Arreola’s ability to save for his new family was \n23  curtailed. \n24  85.  Defendants’ termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA grant and work permit failed \n25  to comply with the DACA program rules and procedures, and violated the \n26  Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n27   \n28   \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 21 of 48   Page ID #:742\nThe Court’s Preliminary Injunction Order and Defendants’ Subsequent \n1 \nActions \n2 \n86.  On November 20, 2017, this Court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining \n3 \nDefendants’ unlawful termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA grant and employment \n4 \nauthorization. The Court held that Defendants’ automatic termination of Mr. Arreola’s \n5 \nDACA based on the filing of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) that charged him with \n6 \nremoval for being present in the United States without admission was arbitrary and \n7 \ncapricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA.  The Court held that \n8 \nDefendants’ revocation of his DACA, despite the absence of any disqualifying \n9 \nconvictions, also violated the APA by arbitrarily reversing the agency’s decision to \n10 \ngrant him DACA in the first place without a reasoned explanation for doing so. \n11 \nFurther, the Court recognized that Defendants’ failure to provide Mr. Arreola with \n12 \nnotice and an opportunity to respond to its termination decision violated the rules of \n13 \nthe DACA program.   \n14 \n87.  As a result, Defendants reinstated Mr. Arreola’s DACA grant and employment \n15 \nauthorization. On December 20, 2017, however, Defendants issued Mr. Arreola a \n16 \nNotice of Intent to Terminate (“NOIT”) his DACA and work authorization. The NOIT \n17 \nasserted that ICE had determined that Mr. Arreola is “an enforcement priority,” and \n18 \nexplained that “ICE informed USCIS that you are an enforcement priority and that \n19 \nICE is actively pursuing your removal in immigration court.”  Further, it stated that \n20 \n“USCIS finds that continuing to exercise prosecutorial discretion to defer DHS \n21 \nremoval action against you is not consistent with the Department of Homeland \n22 \nSecurity’s enforcement priorities.”   \n23 \n88.  The NOIT also misstates the relevant facts of Mr. Arreola’s case in numerous \n24 \nrespects, and erroneously alleges among other things that Mr. Arreola admitted to \n25 \nsmuggling undocumented immigrants.   \n26 \n89.  Defendants’ decision to terminate DACA based on the conclusion that the \n27 \nindividual is an enforcement priority even though he remains eligible for DACA \n28 \nviolates the rules for the DACA program, including the Standard Operating \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 22 of 48   Page ID #:743\n1  Procedures, and is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the \n2  APA.  Among other things, the DACA program rules provide that when an individual \n3  meets the eligibility criteria for DACA, the individual is a low priority for \n4  immigration enforcement.  Defendants’ application of new enforcement priorities that \n5  are inconsistent with the DACA program rules as a basis for termination of DACA is \n6  unlawful.  Further, to the extent Defendants have changed the DACA program rules \n7  without providing a reasoned explanation or otherwise complying with the APA, \n8  Defendants’ actions are further unlawful. \n9  Plaintiff José Eduardo Gil Robles  \n10  90.  Mr. Gil is 24 years old and lives in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, near Minneapolis.  \n11  He has lived in the United States since he was five years old. He was born in Mexico \n12  in January 1993; he came to the United States in 1998 without inspection at a border \n13  crossing. He considers the United States his home.  \n14  91.  Mr. Gil attended public schools in the Minneapolis area starting in kindergarten, \n15  and is a graduate of Coon Rapids High School. He has five younger siblings, ages \n16  nine to 19 years old, who were all born in this country and are U.S. citizens. He is \n17  close to his siblings, taking them to do activities and helping his youngest sister with \n18  her homework. \n19  92.  Mr. Gil has a steady girlfriend who is a U.S. citizen. He enjoys spending time \n20  with her and her family: he has attended many of her family gatherings and he \n21  sometimes takes her little sister and his little sister on outings to places like Chuck E. \n22  Cheese’s and to go swimming at a pool during the summer. \n23  93.  Mr. Gil is a member of his local Catholic church, St. Stephens, in Anoka \n24  Minnesota. He has been an active member of the Catholic Church throughout his life, \n25  and has regularly attended services at St. Stephens for about eight years. In high \n26  school, he was an Altar Server. He also participates in a smaller Bible study and \n27  prayer group on Thursday nights, where he meets with others to pray and discuss the \n28  Bible. He also participates in community service through his church. For example, a \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 23 of 48   Page ID #:744\n1  few years ago after Hurricane Sandy, he traveled to the New York City area for about \n2  ten days with members of the church to help rebuild a church there that was damaged \n3  in the storm. He has also volunteered to help with various landscaping projects at \n4  another local church where he is involved in the youth ministry.   \n5  94.  Mr. Gil also enjoys training at a boxing gym.  He has been training since he was \n6  about 14 years old and goes to the gym almost every day. Although he does not \n7  compete in matches, the training helps him stay in shape and be disciplined.   \n8  The Impact of DACA on Mr. Gil’s Life  \n9  95.  Mr. Gil first applied for DACA in 2015. In doing so, he gave the government \n10  his school records, information about where he lived, his fingerprints, and \n11  photographs.   \n12  96.  He was granted DACA and work authorization in August 2015. His first grant \n13  of DACA was valid for two years, until August 26, 2017. \n14  97.  In April 2017, Mr. Gil filed a DACA renewal application and, again, the \n15  government granted him deferred action and work authorization. He received the \n16  approval notice in August 2017, stating that his DACA would be valid until August \n17  13, 2019. \n18  98.  Being granted DACA had a huge positive impact on Mr. Gil’s life. He worked \n19  full time as a baker at a local restaurant chain called Key’s Café & Bakery. At that \n20  job, he was promoted to bakery manager after about a year and a half. As bakery \n21  manager, he made the bakery schedule for the other bakery employees; decorated and \n22  delivered wedding cakes; ordered and stocked ingredients; made sure the bakery was \n23  making enough cakes and pies; and handled customer complaints. He worked at Key’s \n24  Café & Bakery until the summer of 2017. After that, he started working for a logistics \n25  company, making deliveries of large items like furniture and appliances to homes and \n26  businesses in the Minneapolis area. He liked that the job allowed him to be active and \n27  spend time outside.   \n28 \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 24 of 48   Page ID #:745\n1  99.  Since he obtained DACA, Mr. Gil used his work authorization to help his \n2  family by contributing money towards rent and other living expenses. Until he lost his \n3  DACA, he was paying about half of the family rent and bills. His jobs also allowed \n4  him to start saving up money so that he could reach his goal of taking college classes \n5  and, eventually, getting a degree. \n6  100.  DACA also allowed Mr. Gil to get a Social Security Number and a driver’s \n7  license for the first time. Having a license meant that he could drive to work and \n8  church and give his siblings rides to school and to their extracurricular activities. He \n9  also helped with grocery shopping and did other errands for his family using the car \n10  he purchased with money from his paychecks. \n11  Mr. Gil’s Arrest and Revocation of His DACA and Work Permit \n12  101.  On September 20, 2017, Mr. Gil was pulled over by the police while driving in \n13  his car with two passengers—a high school classmate and a friend of that classmate. \n14  The officer told Mr. Gil that his driver’s license had been cancelled. Mr. Gil was \n15  arrested and taken to the local jail and later charged with the misdemeanor traffic \n16  offense of driving after cancellation of his driver’s license. Mr. Gil’s driver’s license \n17  was supposedly cancelled because it required an immigration “status check” when his \n18  previous DACA grant expired a few weeks before. Mr. Gil was not aware that there \n19  was any problem with his license. Mr. Gil was released from jail the next day. The \n20  misdemeanor charge against Mr. Gil is still pending.  \n21  102.  About a month later, ICE agents appeared at his workplace and arrested him in \n22  the parking lot. Mr. Gil told the agents that he had DACA, but they detained him \n23  nonetheless.   \n24  103.  On October 23, 2017, ICE gave Mr. Gil a Notice to Appear, which charged him \n25  with being removable because he was present in the United States without admission. \n26  ICE put Mr. Gil in deportation proceedings even though Mr. Gil had been granted a \n27  two-year DACA renewal just two months before, and a minor traffic offense, like \n28  driving on a cancelled license, did not disqualify him from DACA.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 25 of 48   Page ID #:746\n1  104.  Mr. Gil suffered in detention. He had trouble eating and sleeping, and he \n2  became depressed. He found it especially difficult to talk on the phone to his family, \n3  which was having a hard time because he was in detention—especially his youngest \n4  sister who is only nine years old. He hated to hear her cry. \n5  105.  Mr. Gil appeared at bond hearings before the immigration judge on November \n6  6, 2017 and November 27, 2017. At those hearings, the government raised the events \n7  that led to his arrest and charge for driving after cancellation of his license. The \n8  government argued that Mr. Gil was a danger to the community because one of the \n9  passengers in the car he was driving had a toy pellet gun and had allegedly shot it out \n10  of the car window. Mr. Gil’s immigration attorney explained to the court that the \n11  pellet gun was a toy, not a firearm, and did not belong to Mr. Gil; indeed, Mr. Gil \n12  never touched the pellet gun and did not even know that his passenger had brought it \n13  with him. His lawyer also gave the judge many letters from relatives, friends, \n14  employers, and members of his church attesting to Mr. Gil’s good character. \n15  106.  After hearing the evidence, the immigration judge concluded that Mr. Gil was \n16  not a danger to the public and ordered his release on a $5,000 bond. \n17  107.  On November 28, 2017, Mr. Gil posted bond and was released from detention. \n18  108.  Mr. Gil was detained for over a month, which injured him and his family, both \n19  emotionally and financially.  \n20  109.  Upon release, Mr. Gil found out that while he was in detention, on November \n21  14, 2017, USCIS had sent him a Notice of Action terminating his DACA and work \n22  permit “as of the date [his] NTA was issued.” The Notice of Action stated that an \n23  “appeal or motion to reopen/reconsider this notice of action may not be filed.” \n24  110.  Mr. Gil never received any prior notice that USCIS intended to terminate his \n25  DACA and work permit, nor did he have any opportunity to respond to the notice or \n26  otherwise contest the termination of his DACA or work permit beforehand. He also \n27  received no explanation for the decision beyond the one sentence in the Notice of \n28  Action. \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 26 of 48   Page ID #:747\n1  111.  Losing his DACA has changed everything for Mr. Gil. He is no longer able to \n2  work at his job with the logistics company. He is no longer able to contribute to his \n3  family’s resources in the way he did before, and he is not able to plan for his future, \n4  including saving up money to attend college.   \n5  112.  Being in detention for over a month was frightening for both Mr. Gil and his \n6  family. He missed them very much and still has bad memories of that time. Losing his \n7  DACA has also created uncertainty for Mr. Gil: he is unsure what he will be able to do \n8  next. The uncertainty has made him feel depressed, hopeless, and stressed. \n9  Plaintiff Ronan Carlos De Souza Moreira \n10  113.  Mr. Moreira is 24 years old and lives in Kennesaw, Georgia, near Atlanta. He \n11  has lived in the United States for almost twelve years. He was born in Brazil in \n12  December 1992, and came to the United States in 2006 on a visitor’s visa with his two \n13  brothers and mother. His father already lived in the United States at that time. He has \n14  never left the country since, and considers the United States his home.   \n15  114.   Mr. Moreira attended public schools in Marietta, Georgia, starting in middle \n16  school, and graduated from Wheeler High School. In school, he played soccer and \n17  tennis, and participated in art club and French club. During middle school and high \n18  school, he received various certificates of achievement for his excellent attendance in \n19  school, as well as for getting good grades and working hard to improve his English \n20  language skills. He graduated from high school in 2012. \n21  115.  While Mr. Moreira was in high school, he also attended a Brazilian Protestant \n22  church called The Vine in Atlanta. He took spiritual maturity courses at that church \n23  and eventually became a youth leader, leading youth meetings every week. While at \n24  the church, he also collected food for the homeless, organized free yard sales, and \n25  often volunteered at church events. \n26  116.  About a year after graduating from high school, Mr. Moreira started working on \n27  a college degree at Perimeter College at Georgia State University in Atlanta. \n28 \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 27 of 48   Page ID #:748\n1  However, he was unable to complete his college degree due to his family’s financial \n2  situation. He hopes someday to go back to college.   \n3  117.  Mr. Moreira’s mother is a Lawful Permanent Resident, and his older brother is \n4  a U.S. citizen. Mr. Moreira’s younger brother, who recently turned 18, has a pending \n5  application for permanent residence. His father is also seeking permanent residence.  \n6  His aunt and two cousins, who are all U.S. citizens, also live in Georgia.   \n7  118.  Mr. Moreira is very close to his family. They live together, and he contributes \n8  to household expenses. The family spends all holidays and birthdays together, and \n9  whenever they can, they travel together.  \n10  The Impact of DACA on Mr. Moreira’s Life  \n11  119.  Mr. Moreira first applied for DACA in May 2013, and was approved in August \n12  2013. He applied for renewal in July 2015, and was again approved for a DACA grant \n13  in October 2015, this one lasting until October 2017. Mr. Moreira again applied for \n14  renewal in August 2017, and was approved on November 2, 2017.  \n15  120.  When Mr. Moreira first applied for deferred action and work authorization in \n16  2013, he gave the government his school records and information about where he \n17  lived.  He also went to an appointment so that USCIS could take his fingerprints and \n18  photographs.   \n19  121.  Being granted DACA changed Mr. Moreira’s life. After he stopped school in \n20  the fall of 2013, he took several temporary jobs, including at AT&T, a flooring \n21  company, and a bakery. Starting in August 2014, Mr. Moreira began working for a \n22  new flooring company permanently. He started out as an assistant to the installation \n23  manager, but within six months he took over as installation manager. In that job, he \n24  supervised about 20 flooring installers, dispatching them to jobs throughout the day, \n25  speaking frequently with them and the company’s customers, and solving problems as \n26  they arose. He also worked on payroll, delivery, and inventory issues. \n27  122.  Mr. Moreira used his work authorization to help his family and to travel around \n28  the United States when he had time off work. His job also allowed him to start saving \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 28 of 48   Page ID #:749\n1  up money, which he could use to take college classes again one day. His goal is to get \n2  his college degree in business administration eventually and to start his own business, \n3  perhaps in the travel industry. \n4  123.  DACA also allowed Mr. Moreira to get a Social Security Number and a driver’s \n5  license for the first time. Having a license meant that he could drive to work and \n6  travel.   \n7  Mr. Moreira’s Arrest and Revocation of His DACA and Work Permit \n8  124.  On November 2, 2017, Mr. Moreira was out with a friend, and they stopped at a \n9  gas station. They got into an argument there, and although it was not a serious fight, \n10  they raised their voices. Someone overheard Mr. Moreira and his friend and called the \n11  police. When the police arrived, they realized that the argument was not serious, but \n12  they nonetheless asked to see Mr. Moreira’s identification.   \n13  125.  Upon examining Mr. Moreira’s identification, the officer concluded that the \n14  expiration date had been altered and arrested him. Mr. Moreira subsequently was \n15  charged with the misdemeanor of possession of an altered identification document.  \n16  126.  Mr. Moreira appeared before a judge, who immediately granted him bail, but \n17  ICE had already placed an immigration hold on him, and he had to stay in jail for \n18  several more days, until immigration officers came to pick him up. The immigration \n19  officers brought Mr. Moreira to Irwin Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia, where he \n20  was given a Notice to Appear charging him with overstaying a visa.  \n21  127.  Mr. Moreira had a bond hearing before the immigration judge on December 7, \n22  2017. At that hearing, the government conceded that Mr. Moreira was neither a flight \n23  risk nor a danger to the community, and offered him a bond, which he accepted. Mr. \n24  Moreira posted the bond and was released the next day. \n25  128.  Being in detention for more than a month was traumatic for Mr. Moreira. \n26  Although he is 25 years old, he looks younger, and he was afraid of the older men. \n27  Mr. Moreira became depressed, and he missed his family.  \n28 \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 29 of 48   Page ID #:750\n1  129.  While Mr. Moreira was detained, USCIS sent him a Notice of Action \n2  terminating his DACA and work permit “automatically as of the date [his] NTA was \n3  issued.” The Notice of Action states that an “appeal or motion to reopen/reconsider \n4  this notice of action may not be filed.” \n5  130.  Mr. Moreira never received any prior notice that USCIS intended to terminate \n6  his DACA and work permit, nor did he have any opportunity to respond to the notice \n7  or otherwise contest the termination of his DACA or work permit beforehand. Mr. \n8  Moreira also received no explanation for the decision beyond the one sentence in the \n9  Notice of Action. \n10  131.  After losing his DACA, Mr. Moreira has lost his work authorization, his \n11  temporary authorization to remain in the United States, and his license to drive, and is \n12  uncertain about his future. The uncertainty has made him depressed.  He feels \n13  hopeless and stressed. \n14  Plaintiff Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective  \n15  132.  The Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective is a grassroots, immigrant \n16  youth-led organization located in Ontario, California. IEIYC serves the immigrant \n17  community in the Inland Empire region, which encompasses Riverside and San \n18  Bernardino Counties. IEIYC’s mission is to advocate for the needs of the \n19  undocumented immigrant community in the Inland Empire, including equal access to \n20  higher education for undocumented youth, and to achieve justice for immigrant \n21  communities by empowering those most affected by immigration policy. Since 2010, \n22  IEIYC has focused its efforts on creating a safe space for undocumented youth to \n23  share resources; organizing other youth to educate and mobilize their peers; and \n24  advocating for regional, state, and federal policies that benefit immigrant \n25  communities, including DACA recipients.   \n26  133.  Since 2012, IEIYC has coordinated numerous DACA workshops during which \n27  approximately 5,000 individuals have received immigration consultation and \n28  assistance with their DACA applications. IEIYC has provided approximately 30 \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 30 of 48   Page ID #:751\n1  scholarships to immigrant youth since 2015, for a total of about $15,000, to help \n2  undocumented youth pursue their educational goals or to assist with the cost of DACA \n3  application fees. In addition, IEIYC recently raised another $15,000 to assist \n4  individual DACA applicants with their renewal fees. IEIYC also runs a Mentorship \n5  Academy for local high school and college students, including DACA recipients, to \n6  provide professional and leadership development training. In addition, IEIYC has held \n7  informational sessions on topics important to DACA recipients, such as their legal \n8  rights when encountering law enforcement, and puts on an annual health conference to \n9  provide health information and resources. IEIYC also assists in documenting and \n10  responding to immigration enforcement activities in the Inland Empire and \n11  collaborates with other local organizations to ensure a rapid response from the \n12  community.   \n13  134.  IEIYC currently has approximately 28 active members in Riverside and San \n14  Bernardino Counties, including a staff of three part-time employees and a board of \n15  directors comprised of five individuals. In various locations throughout the Inland \n16  Empire, IEIYC’s members help plan events and other programming, conduct \n17  outreach, and attend membership meetings. Because IEIYC only has three part-time \n18  staff, it is heavily dependent on its members’ ability to contribute their time and \n19  efforts.  \n20  135.  At least 18 of IEIYC’s members are current DACA recipients who also have \n21  work authorization through the program (collectively “IEIYC DACA recipients”). \n22  Defendants’ unlawful termination policies and practices are likely to harm IEIYC \n23  DACA recipients. IEIYC DACA recipients live, work, attend school, and carry out \n24  IEIYC work throughout the Inland Empire, where there is a significant CBP presence. \n25  For example, there are three CBP sub-stations in Riverside County, located in \n26  Murrieta, Temecula, and Indio, and a new Border Patrol complex is under \n27  construction in the Moreno Valley of Riverside County. There are CBP checkpoints \n28  located in Riverside County, and roving CBP patrols are also common in the area. \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 31 of 48   Page ID #:752\n1  IEIYC DACA recipients are at risk of coming into contact with CBP officers and \n2  being screened for possible revocation of their DACA when carrying out their day-to-\n3  day activities. \n4  136.  Some of IEIYC’s DACA recipients have had or may in the future have contact \n5  with local law enforcement, which could also put them at even greater risk of having \n6  their DACA terminated under the challenged practices, even though they have not \n7  engaged in any disqualifying conduct. \n8  Defendants’ Unlawful DACA Revocation Practices \n9  137.  Notwithstanding President Trump’s claims that DACA recipients “have nothing \n10  to worry about,”24 Defendants have engaged in a widespread practice of unlawfully \n11  revoking individuals’ DACA grants and work permits, apparently based on \n12  unsubstantiated suspicions of criminal activity or minor criminal history, even though \n13  these individuals have not violated the terms of the program and continue to be \n14  eligible for it. \n15  138.  The targeting of DACA recipients for revocation has coincided with broader \n16  changes in immigration enforcement under the Trump Administration. Administration \n17  officials have made numerous public statements indicating that “anyone who is in this \n18  country in violation of immigration law is subject to possible arrest.”  \n19  139.  In April 2017, in response to questions about a DACA recipient who was \n20  removed from the country, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, “We can’t promise \n21  people who are here unlawfully that they’re not going to be deported.”25  \n22  140.  In June 2017, Defendant Homan said, “If you’re in this country illegally, and \n23  you committed a crime by entering this country, you should be uncomfortable . . . . \n24  You should look over your shoulder.”26  \n25                                             \n24 @realDonaldTrump, TWITTER (Sept. 7, 2017, 6:42 AM), \n26  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/905788459301908480. \n25 Ted Hesson, Sessions: ‘We can’t promise’ Dreamers won’t be deported,’ Politico, \n27 \nApr. 19, 2017, http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/jeff-sessions-dreams-\n28  deported-237369. \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 32 of 48   Page ID #:753\n1  141.  In August 2017, ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez confirmed that “ICE does \n2  not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. All \n3  of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, \n4  detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States.”27 \n5  142.  In September 2017, the former Acting Secretary of DHS, Elaine Duke, \n6  reportedly stated that she has never seen DHS guidance telling DACA applicants that \n7  their information would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes.28  \n8  143.  Multiple DACA recipients have been detained by immigration authorities since \n9  President Trump took office. For example, in February, immigration authorities \n10  detained Josue Romero, a 19-year-old DACA recipient and arts scholarship student \n11  residing in Texas, after he was arrested by local police on a misdemeanor charge.29  In \n12  August, ICE apprehended 22-year-old Riccy Enriquez Perdomo, a DACA recipient, \n13  mother of two young children, and former Amazon employee residing in Kentucky.  \n14  Although she had no criminal history and a valid DACA grant, immigration \n15  authorities nonetheless confiscated her work permit and detained her for a week after \n16  she went to an immigration detention center to post a bond for a friend.30 Just recently, \n                                                                                                                                             \n17 \n26 Maria Sacchetti, ICE chief tells lawmakers agency needs much more money for \n18  immigration arrests, Wash.

Indeed, immigration officers have been expressly instructed to screen any \n6  DACA recipient they encounter in the field for potential enforcement actions. A \n7  September 6, 2017 CBP memorandum directs that, after encountering a DACA \n8  recipient, immigration agents must run various systems checks to determine “whether \n9  removal proceedings are appropriate.”32 Specifically, “[w]here an agent finds \n10  derogatory information indicating that deferred action under DACA may no longer be \n11  appropriate, the agent should contact USCIS to determine if the deferred action can be \n12  terminated immediately.”33 Consistent with this directive, a CBP official in Arizona \n13  confirmed that DACA recipients whom officers encounter are screened through \n14  databases and may be detained for several hours while being screened. If the officers \n15  find an indication of a new conviction, or even simply an arrest, they may place the \n16  DACA recipient in removal proceedings, thereby revoking their DACA grants.  \n17  145.   According to government data, DACA revocations increased by 25 percent \n18  after President Trump’s inauguration.34 \n19 \n                                           \n20  31 Lorenzo Zazueta-Castro, UPDATED: Family, Immigration Attorney: DACA \nRecipients Being Held at Checkpoint, The Monitor, Sept. 11, 2017, \n21 \nhttp://www.themonitor.com/news/article_1ced27f4-970e-11e7-a609-\n22  47c4564b53ec.html. \n32 @ValOnTheBorder, TWITTER (Sept. 25, 2017, 7:35PM), \n23 \nhttps://twitter.com/ValOnTheBorder/status/912505757958119426; see also Valerie \n24  Gonzalez, “Border Patrol Memo States Procedures to Process All DACA Recipients,” \nKRGV.com, Sept. 25, 2017, http://www.krgv.com/story/36450600/border-patrol-\n25 \nmemo-states-procedures-to-process-all-daca-recipients. \n26  33 ValOnTheBorder, TWITTER (Sept. 25, 2017, 7:35PM). \n34 Keegan Hamilton, Targeting Dreamers, Vice News, Sept. 8, 2017, \n27 \nhttps://news.vice.com/story/ice-was-going-after-dreamers-even-before-trump-killed-\n28  daca. \n31 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 34 of 48   Page ID #:755\n1  146.  Upon information and belief, since January 2017 alone, there have been \n2  numerous cases in which immigration authorities have targeted DACA recipients by \n3  revoking their DACA grants and work permits, without providing any notice or \n4  process, even though they have engaged in no disqualifying conduct and continue to \n5  be eligible for the program. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ counsel are aware of at least 17 such \n6  terminations nationwide. \n7  147.  For example, in February, immigration authorities arrested and detained 23-\n8  year-old Daniel Ramirez Medina, a Washington state resident. ICE issued him an \n9  NTA, even though he had valid DACA and had done nothing to change his eligibility \n10  for the program. Although he has no criminal history, immigration authorities claimed \n11  that he was suspected of being a gang member and issued him an NTA. An \n12  immigration judge determined that he is not a flight risk or danger to the community, \n13  and ordered him released on bond, but USCIS had already revoked his DACA, \n14  without notice or opportunity to be heard.35 \n15  148.  In April, immigration authorities detained a 26-year-old DACA recipient in \n16  Georgia and issued him an NTA after he was arrested on a misdemeanor charge. \n17  Although the prosecutor subsequently dropped the charge and an immigration judge \n18  ordered the DACA recipient released on bond, USCIS had already revoked his \n19  DACA, without notice or an opportunity to be heard.    \n20  149.  In May, immigration authorities arrested and detained a 19-year-old DACA \n21  recipient in North Carolina and issued him an NTA after he was arrested on a \n22  misdemeanor charge. He pled guilty to a minor misdemeanor that did not disqualify \n23  him from DACA, but USCIS had already revoked his DACA, without notice or an \n24  opportunity to be heard.      \n25 \n26                                             \n35 Emily Goldberg, What Immigration Raids Mean for Students, The Atlantic, Feb. 17, \n27 \n2017, https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/02/why-was-a-daca-\n28  recipient-detained-by-ice/517134/.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 35 of 48   Page ID #:756\n1  150.  In May, USCIS also revoked the DACA grant and work permit of then-28-year-\n2  old Georgia resident and paralegal Jessica Colotl without notice, denying her renewal \n3  request and denying her an opportunity to be heard. Federal authorities publicly stated \n4  that the revocation was based on minor, non-disqualifying criminal history—namely, \n5  driving without a license—that Ms. Colotl had disclosed in her prior DACA \n6  applications. \n7  151.  In June, immigration authorities arrested and detained a 22-year-old DACA \n8  recipient in California for twelve days. ICE issued him an NTA, even though he had \n9  valid DACA and had done nothing to change his eligibility for the program. Although \n10  immigration authorities later claimed that he was suspected of being affiliated with a \n11  gang, ICE voluntarily released him from detention and cancelled his removal \n12  proceedings, indicating that the suspicion was not substantiated. However, USCIS had \n13  already revoked his DACA, without notice or an opportunity to be heard. \n14  152.  In July, USCIS revoked the DACA grant and work permit of a 32-year-old \n15  South Dakota resident without notice or an opportunity to be heard, despite granting \n16  him a two-year renewal only seven months before in December 2016. Federal \n17  authorities did not provide a clear reason for revoking his DACA, even though he has \n18  only a single, non-disqualifying misdemeanor conviction that he had disclosed in his \n19  prior DACA applications. \n20  153.  In September, USCIS revoked the DACA grant and work permit of a 30-year-\n21  old Minnesota resident and mother without notice or an opportunity to be heard. \n22  Federal authorities did not provide a clear reason for revoking her DACA, even \n23  though she remains eligible for the program and her only contact with law \n24  enforcement is limited to minor traffic violations. \n25  154.  In November, USCIS revoked the DACA and work permit of Felipe Abonza \n26  Lopez, a 20-year-old from Texas.  In October, CBP detained Mr. Abonza Lopez, who \n27  wears a prosthetic leg, when the car he was riding in with undocumented family \n28  members was pulled over by local police who handed the passengers over to CBP.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 36 of 48   Page ID #:757\n1  Although CBP claimed that Mr. Abonza Lopez was arrested as part of an alien \n2  smuggling investigation, he was never charged with a crime.  Even so, USCIS \n3  revoked his DACA, without notice or an opportunity to be heard, based solely on \n4  CBP’s issuance of an NTA.36 \n5  155.  In October, USCIS revoked the DACA grant and work permit of a young \n6  California resident without notice or an opportunity to be heard.  USCIS did not \n7  provide a clear reason for revoking his DACA, even though he does not have any \n8  disqualifying criminal conviction. \n9  156.  In addition, thousands of individuals nationwide are subject to having their \n10  DACA and work authorization terminated pursuant to Defendants’ unlawful policies \n11  and practices.  Indeed, in the course of opposing the preliminary injunction motion \n12  filed in the instant litigation, Defendants admitted that USCIS has a practice of \n13  automatically terminating DACA based solely on the issuance of a Notice to Appear.   \n14  157.  Defendants’ unlawful termination of qualified individuals’ DACA and work \n15  authorization involves three systemic practices.  \n16  158.  First, Defendants have a practice of revoking DACA grants without providing \n17  notice, a reasoned explanation, or an opportunity to be heard prior to revocation, and \n18  without providing a process for reinstatement where the revocation is in error. \n19  Defendants’ practice is to terminate without providing a reasoned explanation, even \n20  though the termination represents a reversal of the agency’s position because \n21  Defendants had previously granted the individual DACA on one or more occasions. \n22  159.  Second, Defendants have engaged in a widespread practice of automatically \n23  terminating DACA grants and work permits of individuals who remain eligible for \n24  DACA based on the filing of a Notice to Appear by immigration authorities, including \n25  where the sole basis for the NTA is the individual’s presence without admission in the \n26                                             \n36 Nicole Rodriguez, Immigrant Who Had Prosthetic Leg Mocked by Trump Officials \n27  to be Freed After ‘Inhumane’ Detention, Newsweek, \nhttp://www.newsweek.com/immigrant-mocked-federal-officials-disability-be-freed-\n28  715251. \n34 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 37 of 48   Page ID #:758\n1  United States or having overstayed a visa—charges that apply essentially to all DACA \n2  recipients—and even though DACA is available to noncitizens who are already in \n3  removal proceedings.   \n4  160.  Third, Defendants have targeted DACA recipients for revocation, even though \n5  they have committed no disqualifying conduct, based on the Trump administration’s \n6  articulation of new immigration enforcement priorities. On February 20, 2017, former \n7  DHS Secretary Kelly issued a memorandum setting forth priorities for DHS’s \n8  enforcement of the immigration laws.37 The Memorandum prioritizes for removal \n9  even noncitizens who have no criminal convictions, but merely have been “charged \n10  with any criminal offense that has not been resolved,” as well as any noncitizen who \n11  has “committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offense.” These broad \n12  categories presume guilt for offenses that have not been proven in court. They also \n13  include minor misdemeanors that do not disqualify individuals from the DACA \n14  program, such as traffic offenses or crimes related to immigration status like unlawful \n15  entry into the United States.  \n16  161.  Although the Kelly Memorandum rescinded prior guidance concerning \n17  immigration enforcement priorities issued during the Obama administration, it \n18  expressly kept the DACA guidance in place. Thus, the Memorandum provides that \n19  “the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from \n20  potential enforcement” “[e]xcept as specifically noted above”—referring specifically \n21  to the DACA program.38 DHS also issued a “Q&A” document concerning this \n22  memorandum which states (at Question 22): \n23  Q22: Do these memoranda affect recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood \n24  Arrivals (DACA)? \n                                           \n25 \n37 See Memorandum from John Kelly, Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve \n26  the National Interest 2 (Feb. 20, 2017), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Enforcement-of-the-\n27 \nImmigration-Laws-to-Serve-the-National-Interest.pdf. \n28  38 See id. \n35 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 38 of 48   Page ID #:759\n1  A22: No.39 \n2  162.  Notwithstanding the express language in the Kelly Memorandum and the \n3  accompanying FAQ, immigration authorities have claimed that the Kelly \n4  Memorandum justifies revoking the DACA grants of individuals who would fall \n5  within the new, extremely broad enforcement priorities. Immigration authorities have \n6  taken this position even though the rules of the DACA program expressly provide that \n7  certain minor criminal history is not disqualifying. Under Defendants’ view, \n8  apparently any DACA recipient who is charged with or has allegedly committed any \n9  criminal offense, no matter how minor, and without any charge or conviction, can \n10  have his or her DACA grant and work permit stripped—in many cases, without \n11  notice.  Defendants’ issuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate Mr. Arreola’s DACA \n12  based on their conclusion that he is an “enforcement priority” is an example of this \n13  practice. \n14  163.  Defendants’ policies and practices violate the Administrative Procedures Act \n15  (“APA”) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \n16  Constitution.  \n17  164.  Defendants’ failure to provide DACA recipients with notice, a reasoned \n18  explanation, and an opportunity to be heard prior to revocation, as well as a process \n19  for reinstatement where the revocation is in error, violates the Due Process Clause and \n20  the rules governing the DACA program, and is arbitrary and capricious and contrary \n21  to law in violation of the APA. Individuals who have been granted DACA have \n22  important constitutionally protected interests in their DACA grant and employment \n23  authorization. The revocation of an individual’s grant of deferred action and work \n24  permit under the DACA program harms those interests. Before the immigration \n25 \n                                           \n26  39 See Q&A: DHS Implementation of the Executive Order on Enhancing Public Safety \nin the Interior of the United States, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Feb. 21, 2017, \n27 \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/02/21/qa-dhs-implementation-executive-order-\n28  enhancing-public-safety-interior-united-states. \n36 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 39 of 48   Page ID #:760\n1  authorities may revoke a DACA grant and work permit, they must provide, at a \n2  minimum, notice, a reasoned explanation for the decision, and an opportunity to be \n3  heard. This is particularly important where immigration authorities seek revocation \n4  based on mere allegations. In addition, the rules for the DACA program require that \n5  detailed procedures be followed before a DACA grant can be terminated, including \n6  notice and an opportunity to respond in most cases. Yet Defendants fail even to follow \n7  their own procedures. \n8  165.  In addition, Defendants’ practice of automatically terminating DACA when \n9  immigration authorities file a Notice to Appear—including based solely on presence \n10  without admission to the United States or overstaying a visa—is arbitrary and \n11  capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA. An individual’s presence \n12  without admission or overstay of a visa does not provide a relevant basis for \n13  terminating DACA. Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA based on an NTA \n14  charging presence without admission or overstaying a visa is irrational and arbitrary \n15  because all DACA recipients are present in the country without lawful immigration \n16  status; indeed that circumstance is what made it necessary for them to apply for \n17  DACA in the first place. Further, the practice is contrary to the rules for the DACA \n18  program, which do not allow for termination based merely on presence without \n19  admission or overstaying a visa, and also do not permit automatic termination unless \n20  certain procedures are followed. Indeed, Defendants’ own rules expressly provide that \n21  individuals who are in removal proceedings, or who have received a final order of \n22  removal, remain eligible to apply for and receive DACA. Defendants’ practice is also \n23  unlawful because, in automatically revoking DACA based on an NTA, the agency \n24  fails to consider the relevant facts and circumstances and exercise individualized \n25  discretion in deciding whether to continue or revoke DACA. In addition, Defendants’ \n26  practice improperly rests the decision of whether an individual’s DACA grant \n27  continues to be warranted on the capricious charging decision of an individual \n28 \n37 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 40 of 48   Page ID #:761\n1  immigration agent. For these reasons and others, Defendants’ automatic termination of \n2  DACA based on an NTA is unlawful. \n3  166.  Further, Defendants’ practice of revoking DACA for individuals who lack any \n4  disqualifying criminal convictions without process is unlawful under the APA because \n5  it reflects the agency’s reversal of its decision to grant DACA in the first place, \n6  without providing a reasoned explanation for the change. The granting and renewal of \n7  DACA reflects the agency’s reasoned determination that the individual is eligible for \n8  and deserving of deferred action and work authorization. A revocation reflects an \n9  abrupt change in the agency’s considered position, yet the agency’s practice is to \n10  revoke DACA in these cases without providing a reasoned explanation that would \n11  justify such a change. \n12  167.  Finally, Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA for individuals who have \n13  committed no disqualifying conduct and continue to be eligible for the DACA \n14  program, based on a determination that they are an “enforcement priority” (apparently \n15  in reliance on the Kelly Memorandum), is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law \n16  in violation of the APA. This is so because such terminations violate Defendants’ own \n17  rules for the DACA program, and are inconsistent with the express language of the \n18  Kelly Memorandum. Among other things, applying DHS’ new enforcement priorities \n19  to DACA recipients would eviscerate the DACA program because DACA recipients \n20  by definition lack a lawful immigration status, and a large number of them have \n21  engaged in activities related to their lack of status—such as entering the country \n22  without authorization or driving without a license—that would make them an \n23  immigration enforcement priority were the Memorandum to apply to them. Moreover, \n24  individuals who remain eligible for DACA are, by definition, considered a low \n25  priority for enforcement under the DACA program. Thus, by terminating DACA \n26  based on a determination that such individuals are an enforcement priority, \n27  Defendants have also changed their position without providing a reasoned explanation \n28  for the change, in violation of the APA. \n38 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 41 of 48   Page ID #:762\n1  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n2  168.  Together with IEIYC, representative Individual Plaintiffs bring this action \n3  pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and a \n4  nationwide class of all other persons similarly situated.  \n5  169.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following nationwide classes: \n6  A Notice Class defined as: All recipients of Deferred Action for \n7  Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) who, after January 19, 2017, have had \n8  or will have their DACA grant and employment authorization revoked \n9  without notice or an opportunity to respond, even though they have \n10  not been convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense. \n11  An “Enforcement Priority” Class defined as: All recipients of \n12  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) who, after January \n13  19, 2017, have had or will have their DACA grant and employment \n14  authorization revoked based on Defendants’ determination that they \n15  are an enforcement priority, even though they have not been convicted \n16  of a disqualifying criminal offense. \n17  170.  Plaintiffs Arreola, Gil, and Moreira are each adequate representatives of the \n18  Notice Class.  Plaintiff Arreola is an adequate representative of the “Enforcement \n19  Priority” Class. \n20  171.  The proposed classes satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because each is \n21  so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \n22  172.  With respect to the Notice Class, Plaintiffs’ counsel are currently aware of at \n23  least 17 individuals across the country who have had their DACA and work \n24  authorization revoked without any process, even though they lack a disqualifying \n25  conviction. Moreover, many more such individuals will continue to have their DACA \n26  and work authorization revoked without process in the future, making joinder \n27  impracticable. Indeed, thousands of current DACA recipients nationwide are subject \n28  to having their DACA and work authorization revoked pursuant to Defendants’ \n39 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 42 of 48   Page ID #:763\n1  policies and practices, without notice or an opportunity to respond to Defendants’ \n2  allegations, even though they remain eligible for the program. The risk is reinforced \n3  by Defendants’ concession in this case that they have a practice of terminating DACA \n4  without process. \n5  173.  With respect to the “Enforcement Priority” Class, Plaintiffs’ Counsel are \n6  likewise aware of at least several cases in which Defendants have terminated DACA \n7  based on a determination that the individual is an “enforcement priority,” even though \n8  the individual has no disqualifying criminal conviction.  Further, Defendants have \n9  taken the position in other litigation that they may terminate DACA when the \n10  recipient is considered an enforcement priority under the Kelly Memorandum, even \n11  though the Kelly Memorandum on its face does not apply to the DACA program and \n12  even though the individual is already defined as low priority under the DACA \n13  program rules. \n14  174.  The classes each meet the commonality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n15  Procedure 23(a)(2). The members of the Notice Class are subject to two common \n16  practices or policies: (1) the revocation of DACA and work authorization without \n17  notice, a reasoned explanation, and an opportunity to be heard prior to revocation, or a \n18  process for reinstatement where the revocation is in error; (2) the automatic \n19  termination of DACA grants and work permits based on the filing of a Notice to \n20  Appear, even where the sole basis for the NTA is presence in the country without \n21  admission or overstaying a visa. The members of the “Enforcement Priority” Class are \n22  subject to the termination of DACA grants and work permits based on DHS’ new, \n23  expanded immigration enforcement priorities, even though the individual has no \n24  disqualifying conviction. The lawsuit raises numerous questions of law and fact \n25  common to members of the proposed classes, including but not limited to: \n26  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of revoking DACA without notice, a reasoned \n27  explanation of the reason for such termination, or an opportunity to be heard is \n28  arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA; \n40 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 43 of 48   Page ID #:764\n1  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of revoking DACA without notice, a meaningful \n2  explanation of the reason for such termination, or an opportunity to be heard \n3  violates the Due Process Clause. \n4  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of revoking DACA without providing a reasoned \n5  explanation for the agency’s change in position is arbitrary and capricious and \n6  contrary to law in violation of the APA; \n7  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of automatically terminating DACA when \n8  immigration authorities file a Notice to Appear—including based solely on \n9  presence without admission to the United States or overstaying a visa—is \n10  arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA. \n11  •  Whether Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA based on criminal history \n12  or alleged conduct, even though the individual remains eligible for the program, \n13  pursuant to new immigration enforcement priorities (such as those set forth in \n14  the Kelly Memorandum), is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in \n15  violation of the APA. \n16  175.  The proposed classes meet the typicality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n17  Procedure 23(a)(3) because the claims of the representative Individual Plaintiffs are \n18  typical of the claims of their respective classes. Plaintiffs Arreola, Gil, and Moreira, \n19  and the proposed Notice Class members are all individuals who have had or will have \n20  their DACA and employment authorization revoked without notice or an opportunity \n21  to be heard even though they have not been convicted of a disqualifying criminal \n22  offense. Plaintiff Arreola and the proposed “Enforcement Priority” Class members are \n23  all subject to Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA and employment \n24  authorization based on Defendants’ new enforcement priorities even though they have \n25  not been convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense. Individual Plaintiffs and their \n26  respective proposed classes also share the same legal claims, which challenge the \n27  legality of these revocation policies and practices under the APA and/or the Due \n28  Process Clause. \n41 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 44 of 48   Page ID #:765\n1  176.  The proposed classes each meet the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule of \n2  Civil Procedure 23(a)(4).  Individual Plaintiffs seek the same relief as the other \n3  members of the Notice Class—namely, a declaration that Defendants’ policies and \n4  practices violate the APA and Due Process Clause, and an order enjoining Defendants \n5  from terminating DACA and work authorization on arbitrary grounds and in the \n6  absence of adequate procedures. As to the “Enforcement Priority” Class, Plaintiff \n7  Arreola likewise seeks the same relief as the other members of the class:  a declaration \n8  that Defendants’ policies and practices violate the APA, and an order enjoining \n9  Defendants from terminating DACA and work authorization based on the application \n10  of new enforcement priorities even though under the DACA program rules, class \n11  members are not an enforcement priority. Moreover, Individual Plaintiffs have no \n12  interests adverse to those of their respective classes as a whole. In defending their own \n13  rights, Plaintiffs Arreola, Gil, and Moreira will defend the rights of all proposed class \n14  members fairly and adequately. \n15  177.  In addition, the proposed classes are represented by counsel from the American \n16  Civil Liberties Union Immigrants’ Rights Project and the American Civil Liberties \n17  Union of Southern California. Counsel have extensive experience litigating class \n18  action lawsuits and other complex cases in federal court, including civil rights \n19  lawsuits on behalf of noncitizens. \n20  178.  The members of each of the classes are readily ascertainable through \n21  Defendants’ records. \n22  179.  Finally, each of the proposed classes satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23  23(b)(2). The immigration authorities have acted on grounds generally applicable to \n24  each of the classes by arbitrarily stripping class members of DACA and employment \n25  authorization, without adequate procedures through which they can challenge those \n26  revocation decisions, and by terminating DACA based on Defendants’ new \n27  enforcement priorities that conflict with the DACA program rules. Thus, final \n28 \n42 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 45 of 48   Page ID #:766\n1  injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to each of the classes as a \n2  whole. \n3  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \n4 \nFirst Claim \n5  Administrative Procedure Act \n6  180.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \n7  forth herein. \n8  181.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-06, provides that \n9  courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, \n10  capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n11  § 706(2)(A). \n12  182.  Defendants’ practice of terminating or revoking DACA grants and employment \n13  authorization without notice, a reasoned explanation, an opportunity to be heard, or a \n14  reinstatement procedure is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the \n15  APA because a DACA grant cannot be terminated without first providing a \n16  meaningful process and complying with the DACA program rules, including the \n17  SOPs. \n18  183.  Defendants’ practice of automatically terminating or revoking DACA and \n19  employment authorization as a result of the filing of an NTA—including an NTA \n20  solely charging removability for being present without admission or for having \n21  overstayed a visa—is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the \n22  APA for multiple reasons, including that such an NTA fails to provide a reasoned \n23  basis for terminating DACA; terminating on this basis is inconsistent with and \n24  violates the rules of the DACA program; the practice reflects a failure of the agency to \n25  exercise individualized discretion; and it rests the termination decision on the arbitrary \n26  charging decision of an ICE or CBP officer. \n27  184.  Defendants’ practice of terminating or revoking DACA based on non-\n28  disqualifying criminal history or unsubstantiated allegations is arbitrary and capricious \n43 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 46 of 48   Page ID #:767\n1  and contrary to law in violation of the APA because it represents a departure from the \n2  agency’s considered decision to grant DACA, without providing a reasoned \n3  explanation for their change in position. \n4  185.  Defendants’ practice of relying on the Kelly Memorandum or other \n5  enforcement priorities to terminate or revoke DACA for individuals who have \n6  committed no disqualifying conduct and continue to be eligible for the DACA \n7  program is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA \n8  because it is contrary to Defendants’ own rules for the DACA program, as well as the \n9  language of the Kelly Memorandum itself.  Further, in terminating DACA based on a \n10  determination that individuals who remain eligible for DACA are an enforcement \n11  priority even though such individuals are by definition considered low priority under \n12  the DACA program, Defendants have also violated the APA by failing to provide a \n13  reasoned explanation for their change in position. \n \n14 \nSecond Claim \n15  Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n16  186.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \n17  forth herein. \n18  187.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n19  provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without \n20  due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. V. \n21  188.  Defendants have a policy and practice of revoking DACA recipients’ DACA \n22  and work authorization without providing any process. Once DACA has been granted, \n23  it cannot be taken away without adequate process. Defendants’ policy and practice \n24  violates procedural due process because it fails to provide DACA recipients with \n25  notice, a reasoned explanation for the revocation decision, and an opportunity to \n26  respond, and to present arguments and evidence to demonstrate that the individual \n27  continues to be eligible for and warrants the continuation of his or her DACA grant. \n28 \n44 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 47 of 48   Page ID #:768\n1  Defendants’ process also fails to provide for reinstatement in cases where the \n2  revocation decision was in error. \n3  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n4  IEIYC and Individual Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others similar \n5  situated, ask this Court to grant the following relief: \n6  a)  Certify this case as a class action lawsuit as proposed herein, appoint Plaintiffs \n7  Arreola, Gil, and Moreira as class representatives of their respective classes and \n8  the undersigned counsel as class counsel; \n9  b) Declare Defendants’ DACA revocation practices and policies unlawful and \n10  unconstitutional; \n11  c)  Enjoin Defendants from terminating Notice Class members’ and IEIYC DACA \n12  recipients’ DACA grants and EADs absent a fair procedure—including \n13  reasonable notice, a reasoned explanation, and an opportunity to be heard—\n14  through which to challenge the termination consistent with the APA and the \n15  Due Process Clause;  \n16  d) Enjoin Defendants from revoking the DACA grants and EADs of Notice Class \n17  members and IEIYC DACA recipients based on the filing of an NTA charging \n18  solely presence without admission to the United States or overstaying a visa,  \n19  e)  Enjoin Defendants from revoking the DACA grants and EADs of “Enforcement \n20  Priority” Class members and IEIYC DACA recipients based on the \n21  enforcement priorities set forth in the Kelly Memorandum or other enforcement \n22  priorities inconsistent with the rules of the DACA program; \n23  f)  Vacate Defendants’ unlawful revocation of DACA and work authorization for \n24  Individual Plaintiffs and all class members, and enjoin Defendants from \n25  enforcing the revocations; \n26  g) In the alternative, order Defendants to temporarily reinstate DACA and work \n27  authorization for Plaintiffs Gil and Moreira and such Notice Class members \n28  pending a fair procedure—including reasonable notice, a reasoned explanation, \n45 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 32   Filed 12/21/17   Page 48 of 48   Page ID #:769\n1  and an opportunity to be heard—through which they may challenge the \n2  revocation decision consistent with the APA and the Due Process Clause; \n3  h) Order Defendants to accept renewal applications from Individual Plaintiffs and \n4  class members whose DACA protections were unlawfully revoked;   \n5  i)  Grant an award of attorneys’ fees and costs; and \n6  j)  Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper. \n7   \n8              Respectfully submitted, \n               \n9 \nDated:  December 21, 2017    /s/ Jennifer Chang Newell \n10  Jennifer Chang Newell \nKatrina L.

The Court held that Defendants’ automatic termination of Mr. \n6  Arreola’s DACA based on the filing of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) that charged him \n7  with removal for being present in the United States without admission was arbitrary \n8  and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n9  (“APA”). See Doc. No. 31, Order Granting Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (“PI Order”) at \n10  3-13. Defendants’ revocation of his DACA, despite the absence of any disqualifying \n11  convictions, also violated the APA by arbitrarily reversing, without a reasoned \n12  explanation, the agency’s decision to grant him DACA in the first place. See id. at 10-\n13  11. And Defendants’ failure to provide Mr. Arreola with notice and an opportunity to \n14  respond to its termination decision violated the rules of the DACA program. See id. at \n15  10-11. \n16  Mr. Arreola’s example reflects Defendants’ widespread practice of unlawfully \n17  revoking similarly situated immigrants’ DACA grants and work permits without \n18  process, even though they continue to meet the requirements of the DACA program. \n19  Like Mr. Arreola, Plaintiff José Eduardo Gil Robles lost his DACA after being \n20  charged with driving after cancellation of his license, and Plaintiff Ronan Carlos De \n21  Souza Moreira lost his DACA after being charged with possession of an altered \n22  identification document—both misdemeanor offenses that do not disqualify them \n23  from DACA. Indeed, Defendants have admitted that U.S. Citizenship and \n24  Immigration Services (“USCIS”) has a practice of automatically terminating DACA \n25  based solely on the issuance of an NTA and argued that, under its own policies, \n26  USCIS may terminate DACA without providing individuals notice or an opportunity \n27  to respond. See Doc. No. 23-2 (Decl. of Ron Thomas) at 79-81. Countless young \n28  immigrants have been unlawfully stripped of their DACA and work authorization \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 7 of 30   Page ID\n #:1096\n1  pursuant to Defendants’ policies and practices or face the unlawful termination of \n2  their DACA in the future. \n3  As this Court has already recognized, Defendants’ revocation of proposed class \n4  members’ DACA and employment authorization is arbitrary, capricious, contrary to \n5  law, and conflicts with the government’s own rules, in violation of the APA. The \n6  revocation also violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. As with Mr. \n7  Arreola, Defendants’ actions have caused proposed class members ongoing \n8  irreparable harm, including severe emotional distress and loss of employment and the \n9  ability to support themselves and their families. Issuance of a preliminary injunction is \n10  particularly urgent here. Because of the imminent end of the DACA program, \n11  proposed class members have only limited time remaining on their DACA grants and \n12  will lose that limited time absent preliminary relief from this Court.  \n13    For these reasons, and because they satisfy the other injunction factors, \n14  Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to grant a classwide preliminary injunction; \n15  vacate and enjoin Defendants’ unlawful revocation of Plaintiffs Gil’s, Plaintiff \n16  Moreira’s, and proposed class members’ DACA and work permits; and enjoin \n17  Defendants from revoking Plaintiffs’ and proposed class members’ DACA and work \n18  permits pursuant to their unlawful policies and practices in the future.  \n19  BACKGROUND1 \n20    I.  The DACA Program \n21    Deferred action is a longstanding form of administrative action by which the \n22  federal Executive Branch decides, for humanitarian or other reasons, to refrain from \n23  seeking a noncitizen’s removal and to authorize his continued presence in the United \n24  States. Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 484 (1999). On \n                                           \n25 \n1   Along with Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification filed this same day, \n26  Plaintiffs have filed declarations in support of both that motion and the instant motion. \nThose declarations are the Declaration of Katrina L. Eiland, Declaration of José \n27 \nEduardo Gil Robles, and Declaration of Ronan Carlos De Souza Moreira, cited herein.  \n28  Plaintiffs incorporate these declarations by reference. \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 8 of 30   Page ID\n #:1097\n1  June 15, 2012, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) \n2  announced DACA—a deferred action program specifically for young immigrants who \n3  came to the United States as children and are present in the country without formal \n4  immigration status.2 \n5    Under DACA, young immigrants who entered the United States as children \n6  who meet specified educational and residency requirements, and who pass extensive \n7  criminal background checks, are eligible to receive deferred action. Napolitano Memo \n8  at 1-2. These enumerated eligibility criteria include the requirements that DACA \n9  recipients not have been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor,3 or multiple \n10  other misdemeanors. Id. \n11    A predicate for eligibility for the DACA program is that the individual must \n12  lack a lawful immigration status (because he or she is present without admission, or \n13  overstayed a visa). Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 at 44 (DHS DACA Standard Operating \n14  Procedures). In addition, the fact that a noncitizen is, has been, or will be in removal \n15  proceedings does not disqualify the individual from the program. Napolitano Memo at \n16  2. \n17    Deferred action through DACA is provided for a renewable period of two years, \n18  and DACA recipients may obtain an Employment Authorization Document (“EAD”) \n19  and a Social Security Number. See id.at 3. A decision to grant or deny a deferred \n20                                             \n2   See Doc.

USCIS is the division of DHS responsible for evaluating requests for \n7  DACA. DHS’ DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“DACA SOPs”) set forth the \n8  procedures that the agency must follow in adjudicating and granting DACA \n9  applications, as well as in terminating DACA and EADs granted through the program. \n10  See PI Order at 2; Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 (“DACA SOPs”) at 16 (“This SOP is \n11  applicable to all Service Center personnel performing adjudicative and clerical \n12  functions or review of those functions.

Defendants’ Unlawful DACA Termination Practices  \n7  Defendants have engaged in a widespread practice of unlawfully revoking \n8  individuals’ DACA grants and work permits without process, even though these \n9  individuals have not violated the terms of the program and continue to be eligible for \n10  it. \n11  Multiple DACA recipients around the country have been detained by \n12  immigration authorities since President Trump took office. For example, in early \n13  September, ten DACA recipients were detained for hours by CBP at a checkpoint in \n14  Texas even though they have valid DACA.8 Although they were ultimately released, \n                                           \n15 \n6   Kwon Decl. ¶ 15, Ex. 14 (Memorandum from Acting Secretary Elaine C.

Indeed, Plaintiffs’ counsel are aware of at least 17 cases nationwide.  See \n11  Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 2-15 (providing examples). \n12  Critically, Defendants have admitted in the course of the instant litigation that \n13  USCIS has a practice of automatically terminating DACA based solely on the \n14  issuance of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”), and have taken the position that under its \n15  own policies, USCIS may terminate DACA without providing any notice or \n16  meaningful process.

Plaintiff José Eduardo Gil Robles (“Gil”), now 24 years old, has \n3  lived in the United States since he was five. Declaration of José Eduardo Gil Robles \n4  (“Gil Decl.”) ¶ 1. He has five younger siblings, all of whom are U.S. citizens, and is \n5  very active in his Catholic church. Id. ¶¶ 3, 5. USCIS granted him DACA in 2015 and \n6  renewed it in August 2017. Id. ¶¶ 9, 10. Until he lost his DACA, he worked at a \n7  logistics company, and paid about half his family’s rent and bills. Id. ¶¶ 11-12. On \n8  September 20, 2017, he was arrested and ultimately charged with driving on a \n9  cancelled license, which was linked to the validity of his first DACA grant. Id. ¶ 14. \n10  Even if convicted, the offense would not have disqualified him for DACA. But a \n11  month later, he was arrested at work by immigration agents, who placed him in \n12  removal proceedings. Id. ¶ 15. Like Mr. Arreola, whose preliminary injunction motion \n13  this Court already granted, Mr. Gil found out that USCIS automatically terminated his \n14  DACA upon the issuance of a Notice to Appear in removal proceedings—even though \n15  Mr. Gil was charged only with presence without admission. Id. ¶¶ 15, 22. Losing his \n16  DACA has caused Mr. Gil to lose his job and has harmed his family, which relied on \n17  him for support. Id. ¶¶ 24-26. It has also caused him emotional harm, leading him to \n18  become hopeless and depressed. Id.   \n19  Plaintiff Ronan Carlos De Souza Moreira (“Moreira”) lives in the Atlanta area \n20  with his family, most of whom are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. \n21  Declaration of Ronan Carlos De Souza Moreira (“Moreira Decl.”) ¶¶ 1, 5-6.  He is 24 \n22  years old and has lived in the United States since middle school, becoming a youth \n23  leader in his church, volunteering and traveling, and rising to the position of \n24  installation manager at a flooring firm. Id. ¶¶ 2-3, 6, 9. The government approved Mr. \n25  Moreira’s application for DACA three times—in 2013, 2015, and 2017.  Id. ¶ 7; see \n26  also id. ¶ 27, Ex. C. But after being charged with possession of an altered \n27  identification document—a misdemeanor that would not per se render him ineligible \n28  for DACA even if he were convicted—Mr. Moreira lost his DACA without any \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 13 of 30   Page ID\n #:1102\n1  notice, process, or explanation. Id. ¶¶ 14, 18-19. Like Mr. Arreola and Mr. Gil, Mr. \n2  Moreira found out that his DACA was automatically terminated upon the issuance of \n3  a Notice to Appear in removal proceedings—even though Mr. Moreira was charged \n4  only with overstaying a visa. Id. The loss of DACA has upended Mr. Moreira’s life, \n5  causing him emotional harm and leaving him unable to plan for the future. Id. ¶¶ 20-\n6  22. \n7   \n8  ARGUMENT \n9  The Court should issue a preliminary injunction. To prevail, Plaintiffs must \n10  show: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) likely irreparable harm in the \n11  absence of such relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in their favor, and (4) that \n12  an injunction is in the public interest. Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 \n13  F.3d 1053, 1060 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, \n14  20 (2008)). Plaintiffs satisfy all four factors.  \n15   \n16  I.  THE PLAINTIFF CLASS IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS. \n17  Plaintiffs and the proposed class are likely to succeed on their APA claims, \n18  which are substantially the same as the claims raised by Plaintiff Arreola, and as to \n19  which this Court has already found a substantial likelihood of success. See PI Order at \n20  3-13. The proposed Plaintiff class is also likely to succeed on the merits of the \n21  procedural due process claim. \n22  First, as this Court has concluded, Defendants’ practice of automatically \n23  terminating DACA when immigration authorities file a NTA—including based solely \n24  on presence without admission to the United States or overstaying a visa—is arbitrary \n25  and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA. See PI Order at 8-13. \n26  Second, Defendants’ practice of revoking DACA for individuals who lack any \n27  disqualifying criminal convictions without process is unlawful under the APA because \n28 \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 14 of 30   Page ID\n #:1103\n1  it reflects the agency’s reversal of its decision to grant DACA in the first place, \n2  without providing a reasoned explanation for the change. See PI Order at 10-11. \n3  Third, Defendants’ failure to provide DACA recipients with notice and an \n4  opportunity to respond violates the rules governing the DACA program, see PI Order \n5  at 10-11, is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA, and \n6  violates the Due Process Clause.  \n \n7 \nA. DHS’ Automatic Termination of DACA Based Solely on the Issuance of an \n8  NTA Is Arbitrary and Capricious in Violation of the APA. \n9  For multiple reasons, Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA based solely \n10  on the issuance of an NTA charging the DACA recipient with presence without \n11  admission or overstaying a visa is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in \n12  violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  See PI Order at 8-13. \n13  The Supreme Court has made clear that under § 706(2)(A), “agency action must \n14  be based on non-arbitrary, ‘relevant factors.’” Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 55 \n15  (2011) (citation omitted). Judulang emphasized that “courts retain a role, and an \n16  important one, in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.” \n17  Id. at 53. “When reviewing an agency action, [courts] must assess, among other \n18  matters, ‘whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and \n19  whether there has been a clear error of judgment.’” Id. (citation omitted). \n20  In Judulang, the Supreme Court considered a Board of Immigration Appeals \n21  (“BIA”) rule governing eligibility for a form of relief—suspension of deportation—\n22  which was not provided for in the Immigration and Nationality Act, and was therefore \n23  entirely discretionary. 565 U.S. at 46-47. Although the relief was ultimately within the \n24  agency’s discretion, the Court made clear that the rules applied by the agency with \n25  respect to that relief must still reflect reasoned decisionmaking. The Court emphasized \n26  that “[a] method for disfavoring deportable aliens . . . that neither focuses on nor \n27  relates to an alien’s fitness to remain in the country—is arbitrary and capricious.” Id. \n28  at 55. The Supreme Court ultimately invalidated the BIA rule because it was based on \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 15 of 30   Page ID\n #:1104\n1  “a matter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this country,” and concluded that \n2  the BIA therefore “has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.” Id. at \n3  53.  See also PI Order at 8-9 (discussing Judulang). \n4  Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA based solely on the issuance of an \n5  NTA charging unlawful presence in the United States fails this test for multiple \n6  reasons. First, as this Court has concluded, DHS’ practice is arbitrary and irrational \n7  because “a noncitizen’s deportability due to unauthorized presence in the United \n8  States . . . provides no relevant basis for terminating DACA.” PI Order at 9. As the \n9  Court has explained, the Napolitano Memorandum and DACA SOPs “enumerate the \n10  relevant considerations for a DACA grant, and not only is unauthorized presence an \n11  unmentioned factor, but the program was specifically designed for persons without \n12  lawful immigration status.” PI Order at 9. Nothing in those rules suggests that the fact \n13  that a noncitizen is subject to removal because he lacks a lawful immigration status is \n14  a basis for denial or termination. Indeed, the DACA rules indicate the opposite—the \n15  fact that a person is present without admission or has overstayed his visa is irrelevant. \n16  See, e.g., DACA SOPs at 44. This is because the lack of a lawful immigration status in \n17  the United States is a predicate for eligibility for DACA and is a fact that is therefore \n18  true of every DACA recipient. Id. Because the lack of a lawful immigration status is a \n19  factor common to every single DACA recipient, and is wholly irrelevant to whether an \n20  individual is eligible for DACA, the issuance of an NTA charging presence without \n21  admission or visa overstay does not provide a reasoned basis for terminating DACA. \n22  Second, as this Court has concluded, “[t]he program’s rules also make clear that \n23  even noncitizens who are, have been, or will be placed in removal proceedings are \n24  nonetheless eligible for DACA.” PI Order at 9. The rules thus reinforce the conclusion \n25  that an NTA based on presence without admission to the United States does not \n26  provide a reasoned basis for termination. The Napolitano Memorandum itself requires \n27  that the eligibility “criteria are to be considered whether or not an individual is already \n28  in removal proceedings or subject to a final order of removal.” Napolitano Memo at 2. \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 16 of 30   Page ID\n #:1105\n1  See also Kwon Decl. ¶ 17, Ex. 16 (Dougherty Statement) (“The 2012 memorandum \n2  also made clear that individuals could be considered for DACA even if they were \n3  already in removal proceedings or were subject to a final removal order.”). \n4  Implementing this command, the SOPs provide that “[i]ndividuals in removal \n5  proceedings may file a DACA request.” DACA SOPs at 71. Indeed, even individuals \n6  with final removal orders can be granted DACA. See, e.g., id. at 74 (providing that \n7  individuals with final removal orders may be considered for DACA); id. at 75 \n8  (providing that an individual who has been removed after issuance of a final removal \n9  order, re-entered, and is subject to reinstatement of that removal order continues to be \n10  eligible for DACA). Cf. Matter of Quintero, 18 I. & N. Dec. 348, 350 (BIA 1982) \n11  (explaining in context of removal proceedings that “the respondent can request \n12  deferred action status at any stage in the proceeding”). Further, the DACA SOPs \n13  provide that if an NTA is issued against a DACA applicant while his application is \n14  pending with USCIS—even if the NTA is based on a public safety concern—USCIS \n15  should “proceed with adjudication . . . , taking into account the basis for the NTA.” \n16  See Kwon Decl. ¶ 22, Ex. 21 (Revised Guidance for the Referral of Cases and \n17  Issuance of Notices to Appear (NTAs) in Cases Involving Inadmissible and \n18  Removable Aliens (Nov. 7, 2011)) , at 4 ( “ICE’s issuance of an NTA allows USCIS \n19  to proceed with adjudication . . . , taking into account the basis for the NTA”); DACA \n20  SOPs at 93 (providing that if ICE accepts a case referred to it by USCIS during the \n21  DACA application process, then USCIS “will follow the standard protocols outlined \n22  in the November 7, 2011 NTA memorandum”).   \n23  In such cases, USCIS is required to review all relevant circumstances, and may \n24  grant the DACA request “[i]f a DACA requestor has been placed in proceedings on a \n25  ground that does not adversely impact the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.” \n26  DACA SOPs at 75. See also PI Order at 9; DACA SOPs at 74 (providing that for \n27  DACA applicants with final removal orders, “[f]inal removal orders . . . should be \n28  reviewed carefully to examine the underlying grounds for removal”). As this Court \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 17 of 30   Page ID\n #:1106\n1  has concluded, given that the filing of an NTA against a DACA applicant, or even the \n2  issuance of a final order of removal against a DACA applicant, does not render the \n3  individual ineligible for the program, DHS’ practice of automatically terminating \n4  DACA on this basis is arbitrary and irrational.  PI Order at 9-10. \n5  Third, DHS’ practice of automatically and categorically terminating DACA \n6  based on an NTA is arbitrary and capricious because the agency fails, despite \n7  proposed class members’ continued eligibility for the program, to consider the \n8  relevant facts and circumstances and exercise its individualized discretion. This failure \n9  to consider each individual’s specific circumstances undermines the very purpose of \n10  the DACA program. See Napolitano Memorandum at 2 (explaining that “[o]ur \n11  Nation’s immigration laws . . . . are not designed to be blindly enforced without \n12  consideration given to the individual circumstances of each case”). The agency’s \n13  failure to exercise its individualized discretion is also inconsistent with its own rules, \n14  as described above. Those rules make clear that if someone is the subject of an NTA, \n15  USCIS should consider all of the relevant circumstances, including the ground for \n16  removal charged in the NTA, to determine whether DACA is appropriate or whether \n17  the individual is disqualified. The DACA rules also make clear that when the ground \n18  in the NTA does not adversely impact a DACA grant—including, presumably, when \n19  the ground is one that all or most DACA recipients could be charged with—the \n20  individual is not disqualified from DACA.  \n21    Fourth, and as this Court has held, USCIS’ practice of terminating DACA \n22  automatically based on the filing of an NTA is arbitrary and capricious because it \n23  leaves the question of whether an individual continues to warrant a DACA grant and \n24  EAD solely up to a CBP or ICE officer’s charging decision in issuing an NTA. PI \n25  Order at 10.  In Judulang, the Supreme Court emphasized that an additional reason \n26  why the BIA’s rule was impermissibly arbitrary was that under the rule, whether a \n27  noncitizen would be granted discretionary relief may “rest on the happenstance of an \n28  immigration official’s charging decision.” 565 U.S. at 57. See also id. at 58 \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 18 of 30   Page ID\n #:1107\n1  (recognizing “the high stakes for an alien who has long resided in this country,” and \n2  noting that the Court has “reversed an agency decision that would ‘make his right to \n3  remain here dependent on circumstances so fortuitous and capricious’”) (quoting \n4  Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 391 (1947)). The same is true here: where a \n5  class member’s “DACA [i]s revoked automatically due to the issuance of the NTA, \n6  everything h[angs] on the fortuity of one CBP officer’s decision.” PI Order at 10. \n7  Fifth, in terminating proposed class members’ individual DACA grants and \n8  EADs and finding that the issuance of an NTA automatically renders them ineligible \n9  for DACA, DHS is departing from its prior position without “a reasoned analysis for \n10  the change,” in violation of the APA. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. \n11  Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983). See also PI Order at 10-11; 5 U.S.C. \n12  § 706(2)(A). An agency may depart from its prior decision, but it is black letter law \n13  that if it does so, it “is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change.” State \n14  Farm, 463 U.S. at 42. See also FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, \n15  515 (2009) (“[T]he agency must show that there are good reasons for the new \n16  policy.”). \n17  In these cases, DHS has previously determined that the individual proposed \n18  class member is eligible for and warrants a DACA grant on at least one occasion, and \n19  in many cases on multiple occasions. The agency reached these individual \n20  determinations after evaluating each DACA applicant’s school records and other \n21  circumstances, as well as conducting extensive background checks. PI Order at 10. \n22    In terminating DACA, the agency is abruptly reversing course. The agency does \n23  so even though now, as before, each proposed class member continues to be eligible \n24  for DACA. Nonetheless, USCIS provides class members with a boilerplate one-\n25  sentence statement that his or her DACA and EAD have been “terminated \n26  automatically” because a NTA was issued. See, e.g., Kwon Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 8; Moreira \n27  Decl. ¶ 26, Ex. B; Gil Decl. ¶ 30, Ex. B. As this Court has concluded, USCIS’s one-\n28  sentence explanation fails to provide “good reasons” for the agency’s change in \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 19 of 30   Page ID\n #:1108\n1  position, as required by the APA. PI Order at 10. See also Fox Television Stations, \n2  Inc., 556 U.S. at 515; Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, \n3  968 (9th Cir. 2015) (explaining that the agency is “required to provide a ‘reasoned \n4  explanation . . . for disregarding’ the ‘facts and circumstances’ that underlay its \n5  previous decision”) (citations omitted). As this Court explained, “[g]iven that all \n6  DACA recipients are necessarily removable due to their unauthorized presence, the \n7  agency’s reliance on an NTA citing . . . presence without admission simply fails to \n8  explain, much less justify, an agency’s decision to reverse course and terminate [] \n9  DACA.” PI Order at 10-11 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n10    As this Court has recognized, the agency’s failure to explain its decision is also \n11  invalid because it fails to mention, let alone account for, each proposed class \n12  member’s “substantial reliance interests.” PI Order at 11. Plaintiffs and the proposed \n13  class members have lived in the United States since a young age, and have relied on \n14  DACA to build a life, obtain rewarding employment as young adults, and help support \n15  themselves and their families. See Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 515 \n16  (explaining that an agency must give a “more detailed justification” for a policy \n17  change if its “prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken \n18  into account”). DHS’ failure to provide a reasoned explanation for its change in \n19  position is arbitrary and capricious. See, e.g., Organized Vill. of Kake, 795 F.3d at \n20  967-68 (holding that the defendant agency failed to provide “good reasons” for \n21  reversing its old policy). \n22    For all these reasons, DHS’ practices of changing its position without providing \n23  a reasoned explanation and terminating Plaintiffs’ and class members’ DACA based \n24  merely on an NTA charging unlawful presence is arbitrary and capricious in violation \n25  of the APA. \n \n26 \nB. DHS’ Revocation of Class Members’ DACA and EAD Without Process \n27  Violates the Agency’s Own Procedures and Procedural Due Process. \n \n28 \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 20 of 30   Page ID\n #:1109\n1.  DHS’ Revocation Without Notice Violates Its Own Rules and the \n1 \nAPA. \n2 \nDHS’ automatic termination of proposed class members’ DACA and EAD \n3 \nwithout notice or an opportunity to be heard also violates DHS’ own rules and is \n4 \ntherefore arbitrary and capricious under the APA.   \n5 \nThe DACA SOPs provide that USCIS generally will not terminate a recipient’s \n6 \nDACA and EAD without prior notice and an opportunity to respond. See, e.g., DACA \n7 \nSOPs Chapter 14, Termination, at 136-38 (if DACA granted in error, or granted as a \n8 \nresult of fraud, officer is directed to issue a “Notice of Intent to Terminate,” allow \n9 \nrecipient “33 days to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited in [the \n10 \nnotice],” and terminate only where the adverse grounds are not overcome). See also \n11 \nColotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *7 (“[T]he SOP provides that, in the usual circumstance, \n12 \na termination of an individual’s DACA status will not occur without prior notice to \n13 \nthat individual.”). As this Court has recognized, “unless there are criminal, national \n14 \nsecurity, or public safety concerns, the DACA termination guidelines prescribe the \n15 \nissuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate and require that the individual should be \n16 \nallowed 33 days to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited.” PI Order at \n17 \n11 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although the DACA SOPs contain \n18 \na procedure for termination of DACA if ICE issues an NTA, such termination is \n19 \npermitted only under narrow circumstances involving certain serious public safety \n20 \nconcerns, and only after DHS follows specific procedures. See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 \n21 \nWL 4340385, at *6 (finding that USCIS’ termination of DACA in response to “NTA \n22 \nissued by USCBP in connection with removal proceedings” charging recipient with \n23 \nbeing present without admission did not comply with DACA SOPs); see also DACA \n24 \nSOPs Chapter 14, Termination, at 137 (enumerating procedures to be followed in \n25 \ncases involving disqualifying criminal offenses or public safety concerns).11 \n26                                             \n11   Defendants may attempt to argue that, where a noncitizen otherwise eligible for \n27 \nDACA is an enforcement priority under the Kelly Memorandum, the DACA rules do \n28  not require notice and an opportunity to respond prior to termination. However, the \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 21 of 30   Page ID\n #:1110\n1  In sum, because Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA without process \n2  violates Defendants’ own termination procedures, the practice is arbitrary and \n3  capricious. See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5 (“Defendants’ failure to \n4  follow the termination procedures set forth in the DACA SOP is arbitrary, capricious, \n5  and an abuse of discretion.”); Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 n.6 (“Defendants’ \n6  actions were likely arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA by . . . terminating \n7  her DACA status in contravention of DHS’s own procedures.”). \n2.  DHS’ Practice of Revoking DACA Without Process Violates \n8 \nProcedural Due Process.  \n9 \nIn addition to violating its own procedures, DHS’ practice of revoking DACA \n10 \nwithout providing any process violates proposed class members’ procedural due \n11 \nprocess rights. Plaintiffs and the proposed class members have gained a protected \n12 \ninterest in their DACA, which authorized them to live and work in the United States \n13 \nuntil the expiration date of their DACA grants, and therefore have a right to a fair \n14 \nprocedure before it can be revoked. Yet DHS has reversed these decisions without \n15 \nproviding Plaintiffs and proposed class members with adequate notice, a reasoned \n16 \nexplanation, or an opportunity to present arguments and evidence to demonstrate that \n17 \nthey remain eligible for the program and did not engage in any disqualifying criminal \n18 \nactivity. \n19 \n   The Constitution “imposes constraints on governmental decisions which \n20 \ndeprive individuals of ‘liberty’ or ‘property’ interests.” Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. \n21 \n                                                                                                                                             \n22  Kelly Memorandum on its face makes clear that the new enforcement priorities do not \naffect the DACA program.  See Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 (holding that “the \n23 \nKelly Memo, by its own terms, has no application to the DACA program”); id. at *7 \n24  (emphasizing that the Kelly Memorandum “specifically excludes” the DACA \nprogram); id. at *8 (noting that DHS’s public guidance is “clear and unambiguous” \n25 \nthat the Kelly Memorandum does not affect the DACA program); Colotl v. Kelly, No. \n26  1:17-cv-01670-MHC (N.D. Ga. July 31, 2017) (Doc. No. 43) (Order Denying \nReconsideration at 7-8).  Moreover, applying the Kelly Memorandum to revoke \n27 \nDACA based on conduct or criminal history that the DACA SOPs and DACA \n28  Memorandum provide is not disqualifying is inconsistent with the program rules. \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 22 of 30   Page ID\n #:1111\n1  319, 332 (1976). Regardless of whether the individual had a claim of entitlement \n2  before it was granted, once an important benefit is conferred, recipients have a \n3  protected property interest sufficient to require a fair process before the government \n4  may take it away. See Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971) (holding that,“[o]nce \n5  [driver’s] licenses are issued, . . . their continued possession may become essential in \n6  the pursuit of a livelihood,” such that they cannot “be taken away without” due \n7  process); Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972) (holding that parole \n8  revocation requires due process; parolees may “have been on parole for a number of \n9  years and may be living a relatively normal life[,]” all the while “[having] relied on at \n10  least an implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if [the parolee] fails to live \n11  up to the parole conditions”); Nnebe v. Daus, 644 F.3d 147, 158-69 (2d Cir. 2011) \n12  (recognizing that taxi drivers have a protected property interest in the continued \n13  possession of their operating licenses and remanding to determine if suspension \n14  hearing satisfied due process); Singh v. Bardini, No. 09-cv-3382, 2010 WL 308807, at \n15  *7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2010) (“Even if there is no constitutional right to be granted \n16  asylum, that does not mean that, once granted, asylum status can be taken away \n17  without any due process protections.”) (internal citation omitted). \n18  Plaintiffs and the proposed class members’ DACA and EADs are essential to \n19  their ability to remain lawfully present in the United States and earn a livelihood to \n20  support themselves and their families. See Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Long Beach, 951 \n21  F.2d 977, 986 (9th Cir. 1991) (finding ordinance permitting airport to automatically \n22  reduce flights already allocated to air carriers by license violated air carriers’ due \n23  process rights where allocations were crucial to enterprise); Jones v. City of Modesto, \n24  408 F. Supp. 2d 935, 951 (E.D. Cal. 2005) (finding that city could not revoke existing \n25  massage license without due process) (citing Greenwood v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 28 \n26  F.3d 971, 975 (9th Cir. 1994) (“The Ninth Circuit specifically recognized that an \n27  existing license, in contrast to an applied for license, constitutes a legitimate \n28  entitlement of which one cannot be deprived without due process.”)). Plaintiffs and \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 23 of 30   Page ID\n #:1112\n1  the proposed class members have reasonably relied on the implicit promise that they \n2  could retain their DACA grants and EADs so long as they satisfied the program’s \n3  eligibility requirements. See Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 482. The government’s reversal of \n4  its previous decision that they were eligible for and warranted DACA inflicts precisely \n5  the kind of “serious loss” that requires due process protections. Mathews, 424 U.S. at \n6  348 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n7  Determining the procedure necessary to meet constitutional standards requires \n8  evaluation of three distinct factors:  \n \n9 \nFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; \nsecond, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the \n10 \nprocedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or \nsubstitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, \n11 \nincluding the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens \nthat the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.   \n12 \nId. at 335.  \n13 \n14 \nEvaluation of these factors demonstrates that Plaintiffs and the proposed class \n15 \nmembers must be afforded at least the pre-termination process that DHS generally \n16 \nprovides for under its own rules—i.e., adequate notice of the allegedly adverse \n17 \ngrounds and an opportunity to respond and contest the decision. The private interest at \n18 \nstake could not be more significant. The termination of DACA rescinds proposed \n19 \nPlaintiffs and class members’ authorization to live and work in the United States—the \n20 \ncountry they have called home from a young age. Instead of following its own \n21 \nprescribed process, DHS’s practice is to terminate proposed class members’ DACA \n22 \nwithout notice. The lack of any opportunity to contest the termination decision creates \n23 \nan unacceptably high risk of erroneous deprivation. See Singh v. Vasquez, No. 08-cv-\n24 \n1901, 2009 WL 3219266, at *5 (D. Ariz. Sept. 30, 2009), aff’d, 448 F. App’x 776 (9th \n25 \nCir. Aug. 31, 2011) (“[T]here is a substantial risk of erroneous deprivation through the \n26 \nprocedures utilized by INS in rescinding asylum via a mailed letter. This manner of \n27 \ntermination does not account for anything other than post hoc notice that . . . he or she \n28 \nis no longer entitled to protection.”). Providing Plaintiffs and proposed class members \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 24 of 30   Page ID\n #:1113\n1  with a reasoned explanation for the government’s actions and an opportunity to \n2  present arguments and evidence could make all the difference, because it will allow \n3  proposed class members to demonstrate that they have not engaged in any \n4  disqualifying criminal activity (or even been charged with any crime) and remain \n5  eligible for DACA. Indeed, Mr. Arreola’s circumstances highlight the value of the “an \n6  opportunity to contest the [termination] determination at a meaningful time,” as he \n7  would have been able to show that CBP’s allegations had been mistaken, as the \n8  immigration judge had concluded. See Villa-Anguiano v. Holder, 727 F.3d 873, 882 \n9  (9th Cir. 2013). See also id.at 881 (holding that BIA “must consider all favorable and \n10  unfavorable factors relevant to the exercise of its discretion; failure to do so \n11  constitutes an abuse of discretion”). And both Mr. Gil and Mr. Moreira could \n12  demonstrate that the minor offenses that they have been charged with do not \n13  disqualify them from DACA, and that they have deep family ties, strong work \n14  histories, and other positive equities favoring continuation of DACA in the totality of \n15  the circumstances. See Gil Decl. ¶¶ 1-6, 11-14; Moreira Decl. ¶¶ 1-6, 9-14, 21. The \n16  fact that DHS’ rules already provide for these basic pre-deprivation protections in \n17  most circumstances reinforces both that the value of such safeguards is high, and that \n18  providing such limited process would not place undue fiscal or administrative burdens \n19  on the government. Vasquez, 2009 WL 3219266, at *6 (“To conclude, all of the \n20  Mathews factors weigh in favor of a finding that due process requires more than \n21  sending an after the fact letter of rescission when the government terminates a grant of \n22  asylum.”).  \n23  II.  THE PLAINTIFF CLASS IS SUFFERING IRREPARABLE HARM. \n24  Absent an injunction, Plaintiffs and the proposed class will continue to \n25  experience irreparable harm that cannot be cured by their ultimate success on the \n26  merits in this case. \n27  There is no question that revocation of proposed class members’ DACA and \n28  loss of their EADs has derailed their careers and undermined their employment. \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 34-1   Filed 12/21/17   Page 25 of 30   Page ID\n #:1114\n1  Indeed, a recent survey concluded that, like Plaintiffs, 91 percent of DACA recipients \n2  were employed, including at top Fortune 500 companies such as Walmart, Apple, \n3  General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Home Depot, and Wells Fargo. Sixty-\n4  nine percent of DACA recipients reported that their earnings “helped [them] become \n5  financially independent.”12  Stripping DACA recipients of their DACA and EADs \n6  directly results in loss of employment and earnings, as well as lost opportunities to \n7  gain education and experience: 94% of DACA recipients have “pursued educational \n8  opportunities that [they] previously could not” because of DACA.13 As this Court has \n9  held, “the deprivation of Plaintiff’s earnings and job opportunities caused by the loss \n10  of his DACA and EAD constitutes irreparable harm.”  See PI Order at 13-14. \n11  Consistent with this Court’s holding, the Ninth Circuit has made clear that the “loss of \n12  opportunity to pursue [one’s] chosen profession” constitutes irreparable harm. Enyart \n13  v. Nat’l Conference of Bar Exam’rs, Inc., 630 F.3d 1153, 1165 (9th Cir. 2011); see \n14  also Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 543 (1985) (“We have \n15  frequently recognized the severity of depriving a person of the means of livelihood.”). \n16  The harms faced by Plaintiffs illustrate the adverse effects on proposed class members \n17  of losing one’s DACA and EAD. For example, because he lost his EAD, Mr. Arreola \n18  had to leave his job as a cook at Chateau Marmont, and because CBP took possession \n19  of his car, he has been unable to work as a driver.

In Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir. 2014), for \n3  example, the Ninth Circuit reversed a district court’s denial of a preliminary \n4  injunction on harm grounds, and held that the DACA recipients had established \n5  irreparable harm because the defendants’ policy had “diminished [plaintiffs’] \n6  opportunity to pursue their chosen professions.” Id. at 1068. See also PI Order at 13-\n7  14; Enyart, 630 F.3d at 1165; Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *6 (finding that \n8  irreparable harm caused by defendants’ termination of DACA without notice \n9  “includes the loss of employment, a core benefit under DACA” and that such \n10  “deprivation of employment impacts Plaintiff’s ability to financially provide for \n11  himself and his family”). Moreover, setbacks at an early stage in proposed class \n12  members’ careers may never be recoverable. Time without DACA is “productive time \n13  irretrievably lost” that the proposed class members could be spending in their chosen \n14  career paths, building toward the future for themselves and their families. Chalk v. \n15  United States Dist. Court, 840 F.2d 701, 710 (9th Cir. 1988). See also Arizona Dream \n16  Act Coal., 757 F.3d at 1068 (“The irreparable nature of Plaintiffs’ injury is heightened \n17  by Plaintiffs’ young age and fragile socioeconomic position. Setbacks early in their \n18  careers are likely to haunt Plaintiffs for the rest of their lives.”).   \n19  In addition, losing DACA has rendered many proposed class members’ \n20  ineligible for driver’s licenses, which in the vast majority of states are conditioned on \n21  showing lawful presence in the United States.15 Indeed, 90 percent of DACA \n22  recipients obtained driver’s licenses or state identification card for the first time after \n23  receiving DACA.16 Without driver’s licenses, proposed class members are unable to \n24                                             \n15   See Eiland Decl. ¶ 32, Ex. 17 at 2 (Nat’l Immigration Law Center, Access to \n25 \nDriver’s Licenses for Immigrant Youth Granted DACA, May 31, 2015, \n26  https://www.nilc.org/issues/drivers-licenses/daca-and-drivers-licenses/). \n16   See Eiland Decl. ¶ 42, Ex. 27 at 4 (Tom K.

See, e.g., Arreola Decl. ¶ 40; Gil Decl. ¶ 26 (loss of \n5  DACA has left plaintiff feeling “depressed” and “hopeless and stressed”); Moreira \n6  Decl. ¶ 20, 22 (describing fear and depression resulting from uncertainty following the \n7  loss of DACA). These harms are common to the class. Numerous studies have shown \n8  that both DACA recipients themselves and their family members—especially their \n9  children—suffer psychological harm from the fear and uncertainty that accompany the \n10  loss of benefits.17 Thus even if the proposed class members could later recover their \n11  lost income, their emotional distress in the interim constitutes an irreparable injury in \n12  itself.

THE REMAINING FACTORS SUPPORT PRELIMINARY RELIEF. \n2  Preliminary relief will not harm the government. The government will not be \n3  adversely affected by enjoining the revocation of Plaintiffs’ and class members’ \n4  DACA, since the proposed class includes only individuals who remain eligible for the \n5  program. \n6  By contrast, the public interest strongly favors a preliminary injunction. The \n7  public interest is served when the government complies with its obligations under the \n8  APA and the Constitution and follows its own procedures. As the Ninth Circuit has \n9  emphasized, “[I]t is clear that it would not be equitable or in the public’s interest to \n10  allow the state . . . to violate the requirements of federal law, especially when there are \n11  no adequate remedies available.” Arizona Dream Act Coal., 757 F.3d at 1069 (citation \n12  and internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration and ellipsis in original). See also \n13  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[I]t is always in the public \n14  interest to prevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.”) (citation and \n15  internal quotation marks omitted); Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12 (“[T]he public \n16  has an interest in government agencies being required to comply with their own \n17  written guidelines instead of engaging in arbitrary decision making.”).  \n18  Further, stripping class members of their professions and authorization to work \n19  is not in the public interest. The vast majority (71%) of DACA recipients have been \n20  able to help their families financially through their earnings; 19 job loss means that \n21  many DACA recipient’s families would lose a crucial support, and many of those \n22  family members are U.S. citizens—78% of DACA recipients have an American \n23  citizen spouse, sibling, or child.20 For example, Mr. Arreola’s family relies on him \n24  heavily. He plays a critical role in the care of his sister who has serious disabilities, \n25 \n                                                                                                                                             \n26  emotions, depression and anxiety”) (quoting Catlin Patler, Ph.D). \n19   See Eiland Decl. ¶ 31, Ex. 16 at 3. \n27 \n20   See Eiland Decl. ¶ 49, Ex. 34, at 2 (U.C.

That list shall include the following \ninformation for each person, which Defendants should endeavor \n20\nto update on a weekly basis: \n21  \n   \n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 74   Filed 03/27/18   Page 5 of 7   Page ID #:2070\n \n   \n  Whether the individual was found to have a \n1\ndisqualifying criminal conviction and, if so, what \n2\nconviction(s), as described in paragraph 1.a. of \n3 this Order; \n  Whether the individual was found to have \n4\ndeparted the United States without a grant of \n5 advance parole, as described in paragraph 1.b. of \nthis Order; \n6\n  Whether the individual was found to have been \n7\nphysically removed from the United States \n8 pursuant to an order of removal, voluntary \ndeparture order, or voluntary return agreement, as \n9\ndescribed in paragraph 1.c. of this Order; \n10   Whether the individual was found to have \nobtained a nonimmigrant or immigrant status, as \n11\ndescribed in paragraph 1.d. of this Order; \n12\n  Whether the individual was found to have a \n13 pending criminal charge for a crime that would \nsatisfy the Egregious Public Safety (“EPS”) \n14\ngrounds referenced in USCIS’s DACA Standard \n15 Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) and USCIS’s \n2011 NTA Memorandum, and meets the criteria \n16\nenumerated in paragraph 1.e. of this Order; \n17\n  Whether the individual was found to have a \n18 pending criminal charge for a crime described in 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii), (iv) or \n19\n1227(a)(4)(A)(i), as described in paragraph 1.f. of \n20 this Order. \n  If applicable, the date the individual’s DACA \n21\ngrant and EAD were restored. \n22\n \n23 For each individual identified on the list, Defendants \nwill provide Class Counsel with, on a rolling basis, in \n24\nweekly batches, through the term: \n25  \n  Copies of the Notices of Action and Notices of \n26\nTermination previously sent to the DACA \n27\nrecipient notifying them of the termination of \n28 DACA grant and EAD; \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 74   Filed 03/27/18   Page 6 of 7   Page ID #:2071\n \n   \n  Copies of the reinstatement notices, and printouts \n1\nof the information contained on new EADs for \n2\nindividuals whose DACA grants and EADs are \n3 restored pursuant to this Order, including those \nDACA grants and EADs that are extended \n4\npursuant to this Order. \n5  \ne.  All class members shall have until June 18, 2018, to submit a renewal \n6\nrequest under the terms of this Order. Notwithstanding whether \n7 USCIS otherwise continues to adjudicate DACA requests, USCIS \nshall adjudicate DACA requests from class members whose original \n8\nexpiration dates were between September 5, 2017, and March 5, 2018, \n9\ninclusive, if: \n10  \ni.  their DACA was terminated on or before \n11\nOctober 5, 2017; or \n12 ii. they filed a renewal request on or before \nOctober 5, 2017, and that request remains \n13\npending as of the date of this Order, but whose \n14\nDACA was terminated prior to February 26, \n15 2018. \n \n16\nTo the extent USCIS continues to accept renewal \n17 requests after that date, no class member shall be \nprecluded by this Order from submitting such a \n18\nrequest after June 18, 2018. \n19\n \n20 f.  USCIS will treat new initial DACA requests submitted by class \nmembers prior to the reinstatement of their DACA as timely \n21\nsubmitted renewal requests upon reinstatement based on this \n22 Order. However, if a class member’s reinstated DACA is \nsubsequently terminated after notice and an opportunity to \n23\nrespond, nothing precludes USCIS from taking into \n24 consideration that subsequent termination in adjudication of the \nrenewal request, in accordance with existing USCIS DACA \n25\npolicies. \n26\n \ng.  The parties shall meet and confer to develop a procedure to permit \n27\nindividuals whom Defendants determine fall within paragraphs 1.e. or \n28\n1.f. of this Order, to contest that determination, through Class \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 74   Filed 03/27/18   Page 7 of 7   Page ID #:2072\n \n   \nCounsel, if the individual believes it to be incorrect. For individuals \n1\nwho are determined to be class members, the parties shall meet and \n2 confer to determine how to effectuate that relief consistent with the \nspirit of the injunction and this Order. \n3\n \n4\nh.  To facilitate paragraph g., on or before April 17, 2018, Defendants \n5 shall mail all individuals excluded under paragraphs 1.e. or 1.f. a \nnotice explaining that USCIS has determined that they have a pending \n6\ncriminal charge that is described in paragraphs 1.e. or 1.f. of this \n7 Order, and that as a result they are not a member of the class.  The \nNotice shall advise recipients that if they believe the government’s \n8\ninformation is incorrect, or if they disagree with the government’s \n9\ndetermination, they should contact Class Counsel on or before May \n10 17, 2018. If Class Counsel agrees that an individual meets the class \ndefinition, Class Counsel shall provide all relevant documents and \n11\ninformation to Defendants on or before May 24, 2018. \n12  \ni.  Individuals described in paragraphs 1.e. and 1.f. of this Order whose \n13\npending criminal charges are resolved (other than if the result is a \n14\ndisqualifying conviction for DACA purposes) on or before June 6, \n2018, may notify USCIS through Class Counsel that their charges \n15\nwere favorably resolved, and once confirmed, USCIS will process \n16\ntheir pending DACA request as a renewal request, or otherwise allow \n17 the individual to submit a DACA renewal request before June 18, \n2018. To the extent USCIS continues to accept DACA requests after \n18\nthat date, no such individual shall be precluded by this Order from \n19 submitting an initial DACA request after June 18, 2018. \n \n20\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n21\n \n22 DATED:  March 26, 20-18    ________________________________ \nHon.

The \n7  effect of such an injunction would be to prevent DACA from being promptly rescinded \n8  when removal proceedings are initiated, a state of affairs that turns immigration law – \n9  where enforcement action is only deferred until enforcement action commences – on its \n10  head. It would create a court-imposed obstacle to immigration enforcement where \n11  Congress has spoken clearly and instructed Courts to stay their hand until removal \n12  proceedings have been concluded. Such an order would be inconsistent with the law, and \n13  Plaintiffs’ request should be rejected.  \n14  Defendants ask this Court to deny Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification for \n15  failure to meet the requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b). First, \n16  Plaintiffs assert an overbroad class and fail to meet the numerosity or commonality \n17  requirements, because the class definition unnecessarily seeks nationwide certification \nand relies on faulty legal and factual premises. Second, the three named Plaintiffs were \n18 \nall arrested committing crimes, subsequently determined to be enforcement priorities, and \n19 \nissued NTAs that had the effect of terminating their DACA and employment \n20 \nauthorizations automatically. Their claims are in no way representative of this proposed \n21 \nclass of individuals plaintiffs assert had or will have their DACA terminated despite no \n22 \n“disqualifying conduct,” rendering class certification impossible. Third, relatedly, the \n23 \nfacts underlying each putative plaintiff’s situation require individualized analysis, \n24 \ndisqualifying their claims from class treatment.  \n25 \nBACKGROUND \n26 \nOn December 21, 2017, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint claiming \n27 \nDefendants “have targeted numerous DACA recipients and unlawfully revoked the grants \n28 \n \n    1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 9 of 33   Page ID #:1618\n \n \n1  of deferred action and work permits they have received even though these individuals \n2  have abided by all the program rules and have not engaged in any conduct that would \n3  disqualify them from the program.” Amended Complaint, Dkt. No. 32 at 3. Plaintiffs \n4  moved to certify a class they define as follows:  \n5  All recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) who, \nafter  January  19,  2017,  have  had  or  will  have  their  DACA  grant  and \n6 \nemployment  authorization  revoked  without  notice  or  an  opportunity  to \n7  respond, even though they have not been convicted of a disqualifying criminal \noffense. \n8 \n9  Class Cert. Motion, Dkt. No. 39 at 3; see also Dkt. No. 39-1 at 9 n.2 (“This motion does \n10  not address the proposed ‘Enforcement Priority’ Class pled in Plaintiffs’ Amended \n11  Complaint.”). \n12  Plaintiff Arreola had his DACA and EAD terminated automatically through the \n13  issuance of an NTA, after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) encountered him \n14  engaged in alien smuggling, the facts of which he conceded to in an interview with CBP \n15  agents. See Dkt. 23-2 at 26, 56-57. Mr. Arreola’s DACA and EAD were then reinstated \n16  on November 22, 2017, and on December 20, 2017, DHS issued a Notice of Intent to \n17  Terminate pursuant to this Court’s Order. See Dkt. No. 31; Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 87. \n18  Named Plaintiffs Gil Robles and De Souza Moreira were found to be enforcement \n19  priorities upon investigation by ICE, following plaintiffs’ respective arrests for felony \n20  crimes. See Exhibits A, Decl. of Jeremy Anderson; A.1, Gil-Robles Notice to Appear \n21  (“NTA”) and Form I-213, dated Oct. 23, 2017; B, Decl. of Derrick A. Eleazer; B.1, De \n22  Souza-Moreira NTA and Form I-213, dated Nov. 5, 2017. On September 20, 2017, \n23  Plaintiff Gil-Robles was arrested and charged with two felonies, including First Degree \n24  Assault and transferring a firearm without a background check to a prohibited person. See \n25  Exhibit A. On Nov. 6, 2017, ICE issued Gil-Robles an NTA charging him with unlawful \n26  presence, and on Nov. 14, 2017, USCIS issued him a Notice of Action, stating his DACA \n27  and EAD terminated automatically with the NTA.

Plaintiff admitted to police that he had altered the expiration \n3  date on his driver’s license due to it expiring. Id. On November 5, 2017, ICE issued De \n4  Souza an NTA charging unlawful presence, and on November 10, 2017, USCIS issued \n5  him a Notice of Action explaining his DACA and EAD terminated automatically with the \n6  NTA. Id.; Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 129. \n7  Contrary to Plaintiffs’ allegations, the DHS law enforcement officers who issued \n8  each Plaintiffs’ NTA relied on the criminal conduct described herein, and were also \n9  aware of Plaintiffs’ previous DACA grants. See Exhibits A, B; Dkt. No 23-2 at 34, 62. As \n10  explained below, the decision to charge only unlawful presence on their respective NTAs \n11  is not indicative of the full reasoning DHS employed to issue the NTAs.  \n12  Putative class member Jessica Colotl, Dkt. No. 39-13, Eiland Decl., at ¶ 7, is not \n13  subject to DACA termination. Rather, following the issuance of a preliminary injunction \n14  in her case, USCIS reinstated her previous DACA grant, which subsequently expired. \n15  USCIS denied Ms. Colotl’s DACA renewal request after providing her with notice of its \n16  intent to do so, and an opportunity to respond. See Colotl v. Kelly, No. 1:17-CV-1670-\n17  MHC (N.D. Ga.) at Dkt. No. 50-2.  \nPutative class member Felipe Abonza Lopez, had his DACA terminated \n18 \nautomatically through the issuance of an NTA after CBP encountered him engaged in \n19 \nalien smuggling. Dkt.

Nos. 39, 39-1, and 40, 40-1], Plaintiffs cite to the exhibits they previously filed with their first \nmotion for injunctive relief [Dkt. Nos. 16, 16-2 and 16-4 (Kwon Decl.) to 16-29]. For the sake of \n28 \njudicial efficiency, Defendants do the same in their response briefs to both motions.  \n \n    3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 11 of 33   Page ID #:1620\n \n \n1  Putative class member Daniel Ramirez Medina, Dkt.

Melendez at ¶¶ 4-5; \n4  Dkt. No. 16-25 at 4-5 (classifying a “known or suspected street gang member” as a “top \n5  immigration enforcement priority”). Of the remaining seven proposed class members, \n6  two of them have not had their DACA terminated at all. Dkt. No. 39-13 at ¶¶ 14-15. \n7  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n8  As an initial matter, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification \n9  to the extent that Plaintiffs’ claims are subject to dismissal. Congress enacted 8 U.S.C. \n10  § 1252(g) with the specific intent of preventing judicial review of the Department of \n11  Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) prosecutorial discretion to decide whether and when to \n12  initiate removal proceedings, as well as actions and decisions that arise out of that \n13  decision.3 Congress also mandated through 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9) a single \n14  opportunity in a court of appeals for individuals to challenge their removal orders, \n15  including claims of constitutional violations arising from the initiation of or conduct of \n16  their removal proceedings. Any interpretation of these statutes that permits a district court \n17  challenge to actions inextricably linked to the initiation of removal proceedings, such as \nPlaintiffs’ challenge here, would run counter to Congress’s intent, to Supreme Court case \n18 \nlaw, and to the law of this Circuit.  \n19 \nEven if the Court believes that it would have jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims, it \n20 \nshould nonetheless deny the motion for class certification where Plaintiffs fail to meet \n21 \nany of the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) or (b)(2). To begin with, Plaintiffs offer \n22 \nan overbroad definition of their putative class based on an incorrect understanding of \n23 \nDACA policy, such that it captures many DACA terminations not requiring any notice or \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n3 Plaintiffs imply at least some of their class members have or  will have lost DACA and EADs \n26  automatically without the issuance of an NTA, but fail to identify any examples or offer any argument in \nsupport of such a possible class member. Regardless, all three named plaintiffs’ DACA was terminated as \n27  a consequence of NTA issuance based on criminal conduct, so there is no class representative for an \nindividual whose DACA was terminated for some reason other than an NTA issuance based on criminal \n28 \nconduct.  \n \n    4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 12 of 33   Page ID #:1621\n \n \n1  opportunity to respond, while also carving out a significant subcategory of DACA \n2  terminations based on DHS finding an individual to be an enforcement priority. See Pls.’ \n3  Mem. in Supp. of Class Certification, Dkt. No. 39-1 at 9 n.2 (“This motion does not \n4  address the proposed ‘Enforcement Priority’ Class pled in Plaintiffs’ Amended \n5  Complaint, filed this same date.”). Because the enforcement priority exception would \n6  exclude all three of the named plaintiffs, and likely most of the unnamed potential class \n7  members; and because any relief a potential class member may be entitled to differs \n8  depending on an individual analysis of the facts and law pertaining to their DACA \n9  terminations, Plaintiffs fail to meet the numerosity, commonality, typicality, or adequacy \n10  of representation requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) or (b)(2). For these reasons, class \n11  certification should be denied.  \n12  ARGUMENT \n13  I.  Standard of Review for Class Certification \n14  Courts should take great care in determining whether to certify a class, especially a \n15  nationwide class against the federal government. Although the Supreme Court declined to \n16  adopt a blanket prohibition on such classes, it cautioned that “a federal court when asked \n17  to certify a nationwide class should take care to ensure that nationwide relief is indeed \nappropriate in the case before it, and that certification of such a class would not \n18 \nimproperly interfere with the litigation of similar issues in other judicial districts.” \n19 \nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702-03 (1979). The Court further acknowledged \n20 \n“the force of the [government’s] contentions that nationwide class actions may have a \n21 \ndetrimental effect by foreclosing adjudication by a number of different courts and judges, \n22 \nand of increasing, in certain cases, the pressures on this Court’s docket.” Id. at 702; see \n23 \nalso United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 160 (1984) (“Allowing only one final \n24 \nadjudication would deprive this Court of the benefit it receives from permitting several \n25 \ncourts of appeals to explore a difficult question before this Court grants certiorari.”). \n26 \nOther class challenges to immigration policies in this Court have decidedly not sought the \n27 \ncertification of a nationwide class. See, e.g., Franco-Gonzales v. Napolitano, No. CV 10-\n28 \n \n    5 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 13 of 33   Page ID #:1622\n \n \n1  02211 DMG DTBX, 2011 WL 11705815, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011); Rodriguez v. \n2  Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1111 (9th Cir. 2010). \n3  A party seeking certification of a proposed class must demonstrate the existence of \n4  the four required elements set forth in Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n5  Specifically, the moving party must show that:  \n6  (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable \n(“numerosity”); \n7 \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class (“commonality”); \n8  (3) the claims or defenses of the named plaintiffs are typical of claims or \ndefenses of the class (“typicality”); and \n9 \n(4) the named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n10 \nclass (“adequacy of representation”). \n11 \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); see also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 345 \n12  (2011) (“Class certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.”). In \n13  addition to meeting the requirements set forth in Rule 23(a), the proposed class must also \n14  qualify under Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3). Dukes, 564 U.S. at 345; see also Zinser v. Accufix \n15  Research Inst., Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001). Plaintiffs seek certification \n16  under Rule 23(b)(2). Dkt. No. 17 at 25-29. Rule 23(b)(2) permits class actions for \n17  declaratory or injunctive relief where “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to \n18  act on grounds that generally apply to the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The “key to the \n19  (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—\n20  the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to \n21  all of the class members or as to none of them.” Id. at 360 (citation omitted).  \n22  The party seeking class certification bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that \n23  it has met all four Rule 23(a) prerequisites and that the class lawsuit falls within one of \n24  the three types of actions permitted under Rule 23(b). Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1186. \n25  Moreover, a complaint’s failure to meet “any one of Rule 23’s requirements destroys the \n26  alleged class action.” Rutledge v. Elec. Hose & Rubber Co., 511 F.2d 668, 673 (9th Cir. \n27  1975) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court has held that “actual, not presumed, \n28  conformance with Rule 23(a) [is] indispensable.” Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, \n \n    6 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 14 of 33   Page ID #:1623\n \n \n1  160 (1982); Zinser, 253 F.3d at 350 (Rule 23 “does not set forth a mere pleading \n2  standard.”). A court should only certify a class “if the trial court is satisfied, after a \n3  rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.” Zinser, 253 \n4  F.3d at 350-51 (internal quotation omitted). \n5  A district court, therefore, must conduct a rigorous analysis to determine that an \n6  action meets all the requirements of Rule 23. Gen. Tel. Co., 457 U.S. at 161. Even if a \n7  court finds that an action meets all of Rule 23’s requirements, that court retains “broad \n8  discretion” to determine whether it should certify the proposed class. Zinser, 253 F.3d at \n9  1186. Toward that end, a court may “probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on \n10  the certification question.” Gen. Tel. Co., 457 U.S. at 160. This is because “the class \n11  determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and \n12  legal issues comprising the plaintiff’s cause of action.” Id. (internal quotation omitted). \n13  Nonetheless, the ultimate decision regarding class certification must necessarily \n14  “involve[] a significant element of discretion.” Yokoyama v. Midland Nat’l Life Ins. Co., \n15  594 F.3d 1087, 1090 (9th Cir. 2010). \n16  II.  Deferred Action and the DACA Policy \n17  A. The Notice to Appear process \nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) charges the Secretary of Homeland \n18 \nSecurity “with the administration and enforcement” of the INA and “all other laws \n19 \nrelating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.” 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1). \n20 \nIndividuals are removable if, inter alia, “they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have \n21 \nbeen convicted of certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law.” Arizona v. \n22 \nUnited States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012); see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a), 1227(a). The \n23 \nissuance of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) is a necessary predicate step to commencing \n24 \nremoval proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14(a). The authority to \n25 \nissue an NTA is vested with all DHS immigration officers. See 8 C.F.R. § 239.1(a). \n26 \nHowever, DHS divides NTA issuance responsibility between U.S. Citizenship and \n27 \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”) in its administrative capacity, and U.S. Immigration and \n28 \n \n    7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 15 of 33   Page ID #:1624\n \n \n1  Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) in their \n2  law enforcement capacities. See Dkt. No 16-25, USCIS Memorandum: Revised Guidance \n3  for the Referral of Cases and Issuance of Notices to Appear (NTAs) in Cases Involving \n4  Inadmissible and Removable Aliens, (“NTA Memo”) dated Nov. 7, 2011. In adjudicating \n5  applications for immigration benefits, USCIS is authorized to issue an NTA in cases \n6  where a statute or regulation requires it, such as in the termination of Conditional \n7  Permanent Resident Status or the termination of refugee status; or where “a Statement of \n8  Findings (“SOF”) substantiating fraud” is part of the individual’s record. Id. at 3-4.  \n9  In any case where USCIS has “information indicat[ing an individual] is under \n10  investigation for, has been arrested for (without disposition), or has been convicted of” a \n11  crime, whether defined as an Egregious Public Safety (“EPS”) case or not, USCIS is \n12  required to refer the case to ICE. Id. at 5 (“All EPS cases must be referred to ICE . . . .”); \n13  id. at 6 (“[F]or a criminal offense not included on the EPS list, USCIS will complete the \n14  adjudication and then refer the case to ICE.”). The memo is clear: “USCIS will not issue \n15  an NTA in these cases if ICE declines to issue an NTA.” Id. at 5 and 6 (emphasis added); \n16  see id. at 2 (“USCIS must ensure that its issuance of NTAs fits within and supports the \n17  Government’s overall removal priorities . . . .”). \nB. Deferred Action  \n18 \nThe federal government cannot practicably remove every removable alien. Rather, \n19 \n“[a] principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by \n20 \nimmigration officials.” Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. DHS, “as an initial matter, must \n21 \ndecide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.” Id. “At each stage the Executive \n22 \nhas discretion to abandon the endeavor.” Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., \n23 \n525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999) (“AADC”). As with other agencies exercising enforcement \n24 \ndiscretion, DHS must balance a number of factors within its expertise. See Heckler v. \n25 \nChaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985).  \n26 \nDeferred action is “a regular practice” in which the Secretary exercises her \n27 \ndiscretion “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [her] own convenience,” to notify an \n28 \n \n    8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 16 of 33   Page ID #:1625\n \n \n1  alien of a non-binding decision to forbear from seeking his removal for a designated \n2  period. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 483-84; 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) (“an act of \n3  administrative convenience to the government which gives some cases lower priority”). \n4  Through “[t]his commendable exercise in administrative discretion, developed without \n5  express statutory authorization,” AADC, 525 U.S. at 484 (citations omitted), a removable \n6  individual may remain present in the United States so long as DHS continues to forbear, \n7  but always at the discretion of the Secretary. \n8  It is important to note, of course, that deferred action does not confer lawful \n9  immigration status or provide any defense to removal. Cf. Chaudhry v. Holder, 705 F.3d \n10  289, 292 (7th Cir. 2013) (discussing the difference between “unlawful presence” and \n11  “unlawful status” as two distinct concepts). An individual with deferred action remains \n12  removable at any time, and DHS never surrenders or otherwise loses the discretion to \n13  revoke deferred action unilaterally. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 484-85. \n14  On June 15, 2012, DHS issued a memorandum entitled, “Exercising Prosecutorial \n15  Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children” (the \n16  “Napolitano Memo”). See Pl. Exhibit 9, Dkt. No. 16-13. That memorandum outlines a \n17  policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) that is available to a \ncertain subset of individuals unlawfully present in this country. The Napolitano Memo \n18 \nrecognizes both USCIS and ICE authority to grant DACA. Id. at 4 (“For individuals who \n19 \nare granted deferred action by either ICE or USCIS . . . .”). The memo also clarifies that \n20 \nDACA “confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship. Only \n21 \nthe Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights.” Id. at 3. \n22 \nConversely, the Napolitano Memo does not address the topics of arrest by DHS or the \n23 \ngrounds that DHS will consider in terminating deferred action. Rather, it directs ICE and \n24 \nCBP agents to “immediately exercise their discretion, on an individual basis” to \n25 \ndetermine whether to issue an NTA or defer action, without reference to whether an \n26 \nindividual already has deferred action. Id. (“With respect to individuals who meet the \n27 \nabove criteria, ICE and CBP should immediately exercise their discretion, on an \n28 \n \n    9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 17 of 33   Page ID #:1626\n \n \n1  individual basis, in order to prevent low priority individuals from being placed into \n2  removal proceedings.”). Thus, CBP or ICE have discretion to issue an NTA if the facts \n3  and circumstances available at the time an individual is encountered counsel against the \n4  continuation of deferred action, including where there is a criminal offense or public \n5  safety concern presented. Id.; see Regents of Univ. of California v. United States Dep’t of \n6  Homeland Sec. (“Regents”), No. C 17-05211 WHA, 2018 WL 339144, at *27-28 (N.D. \n7  Cal. Jan. 9, 2018) (“Nothing in this order [enjoining termination of DACA policy] \n8  prohibits the agency from proceeding to remove any individual, including any DACA \n9  enrollee, who it determines poses a risk to national security or public safety, or otherwise \n10  deserves, in its judgment, to be removed.”); Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 16, 24 (D.C. \n11  Cir. 2015) (“Even after they are approved for deferred action . . . beneficiaries are subject \n12  to the Department’s overall enforcement priorities”), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 900, (2016), \n13  reh’g denied, 136 S. Ct. 1250 (2016).  \n14  In mid-August 2012, USCIS published on its website a webpage entitled, \n15  “Frequently Asked Questions,” which is now archived on the USCIS webpage.4 See Pl. \n \n16  Exhibit 19, Dkt. No. 16-23. These FAQs provide guidance on the DACA policy and \n17  state, “DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be \nterminated at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s \n18 \ndiscretion.” Id. at Q:27. The FAQs also explain that the phrase “national security or \n19 \npublic safety threat” includes but is not limited to “gang membership, participation in \n20 \ncriminal activities, or participation in activities that threaten the United States.” See id. at \n21 \nQ:65. The Form I-821D, entitled, “Instructions for Consideration of Deferred Action for \n22 \nChildhood Arrivals” states, “[i]ndividuals who receive deferred action will not be placed \n23 \ninto removal proceedings or removed from the United States for a specified period of \n24 \ntime, unless the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) chooses to terminate the \n25 \ndeferral.” See Form I-821D Instructions, Dkt. No. 23-2 at 4.  \n26 \nDACA, as a form of deferred action, confers the ability to apply for an \n27 \n                                                 \n28 \n4 Available at https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-questions (last visited Jan. 30, 2018). \n \n    10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 18 of 33   Page ID #:1627\n \n \n1  employment authorization document (“EAD”) which may be granted upon a showing of \n2  economic necessity for employment. See 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14). While regulations \n3  provide for automatic and largely unconditional employment authorization for some \n4  individuals with a legal status, such as legal permanent residents and some temporary \n5  visa holders, see 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(a)-(b), individuals with no lawful status, including \n6  those with any form of deferred action, must apply for temporary and conditional \n7  employment authorization. 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c). Regulations also provide that \n8  employment authorization granted under subsection (c) is automatically terminated, \n9  without notice, upon the institution of removal proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii).  \n10  Through an internal USCIS guidance document entitled the “National Standard \n11  Operating Procedures (SOP); Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA),” USCIS \n12  has provided officers in the Service Center Operations directorate with procedural \n13  guidance for terminating deferred action in three circumstances, one of which includes \n14  issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate (“NOIT”) and providing a chance for a DACA \n15  recipient to respond, and two in which such notice and an opportunity to respond is not \n16  required, including when the individual is served with an NTA. See Pl. Exhibit 20, \n17  National Standard Operating Procedures, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \n \n(“DACA SOP”) dated Aug. 28, 2013, Dkt. No. 16-24 at 37-39; id. at 41-44, Appendix I.  \n18 \nNothing in the Napolitano Memo limits CBP or ICE from exercising their \n19 \nauthority to issue an NTA to an individual with DACA. Rather, pursuant to the DACA \n20 \nSOP and Appendix I, and in conjunction with the NTA Memo, when USCIS discovers \n21 \ncertain conduct that suggests DACA should be terminated, USCIS should refer such \n22 \nconduct to ICE, who may issue an NTA that automatically terminates DACA, with no \n23 \nadditional notice or opportunity to respond. See Dkt. No. 16-24 at 38-39. Logically, \n24 \nlawfully, and pursuant to the Napolitano Memo, where an ICE or CBP officer encounters \n25 \nan individual engaged in criminal behavior, the officer may issue an NTA or defer action \n26 \nwithout consulting with USCIS, who in any event would be required to refer the case \n27 \nback to ICE to decide whether to issue an NTA – creating an absurd circular result.  \n28 \n \n    11 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 19 of 33   Page ID #:1628\n \n \n1  Thus, USCIS’s only role in a case where ICE or CBP issues an NTA is to issue a \n2  “Notice of Action” to the individual, informing him or her that deferred action under \n3  DACA and his or her EAD automatically terminated as of the date the NTA was issued. \n4  Id. at 42. This “Notice of Action” serves only as an administrative notice. USCIS, \n5  through the Notice of Action, does not “decide” to terminate DACA or the EAD, which \n6  are likely already terminated by the time USCIS becomes involved. \n7  Analogously, the DACA SOP provides that if a DACA requestor is in immigration \n8  detention and ICE intends to release the individual, USCIS will deny the DACA request \n9  if ICE notifies USCIS that the requestor is an enforcement priority. See Exhibit D, Decl. \n10  of Brandon M. Robinson; D.1, DACA SOP, Chapter 8, dated August 28, 2013, at 47-49.5  \n11  In those cases, and in conjunction with the 2011 NTA Memo and the Napolitano Memo, \n12  USCIS makes no further examination of the reason for detention or for the basis of the \n13  initiation of removal proceedings. Id. USCIS may “discuss” its disagreement with ICE, \n14  but the SOP does not say that USCIS may override ICE’s determination. Id. at 48. \n15  Additionally, if USCIS refers a non-detained DACA requestor to ICE as an EPS case and \n16  ICE declines to act, USCIS is required to deny the DACA request. Id. at 49. In both \n17  cases, the individual is provided no additional reasons for the denial, nor a notice of \nintent to deny, nor an opportunity to respond.  \n18 \nOn September 5, 2017, DHS announced a plan to end the DACA policy in an \n19 \norderly fashion. See Pl. Exhibit 14, “Memorandum on Rescission of Deferred Action for \n20 \nChild Arrivals” from Elaine C. Duke, dated Sept. 5, 2017 (“Duke Memo”), Dkt. No. 16-\n21 \n18. The memorandum, inter alia, provides that DHS will “adjudicate – on an individual, \n22 \ncase by case basis – properly filed pending DACA renewal requests and associated \n23 \napplications for Employment Authorization Documents . . . from current beneficiaries \n24 \nwhose benefits will expire between the date of this memorandum and March 5, 2018 that \n25 \nhave been accepted by the Department as of October 5, 2017.” Id.

USCIS issued guidance thereafter that allows, \n4  in part, individuals who previously received DACA and whose DACA expired on or after \n5  Sept. 5, 2017 to file a DACA renewal request, and individuals who previously received \n6  DACA which expired before Sept. 5, 2016 or whose DACA was previously terminated to \n7  submit an initial DACA request.6  \n8  III.

See Forrand, 2009 WL 648966, \n14 \nat *3 (denying class certification for employees claiming FedEx prevented them from \n15 \ntaking meal breaks because it would have had to determine not just whether an employee \n16 \ndid not take breaks, but the reasons why). Plaintiffs define their class as all DACA \n17 \nrecipients who have had their DACA terminated without advanced notice or an \n18 \nopportunity to respond, and “without a disqualifying criminal conviction.” Dkt. No. 39 at \n19 \n3; see also Dkt. No. 32 (asserting the requirement to terminate DACA is a “disqualifying \n20 \ncriminal conviction”). Additionally, Plaintiffs carve out of that proposed group \n21 \nindividuals who had their DACA terminated without notice due to DHS’s determination \n22 \nthat the individual is an enforcement priority. Dkt. No. 39 at 9 n.2.8  \n23 \n                                                 \n24 \n8 Plaintiffs misapply the term “enforcement priority” to distinguish a sub-class of individuals who \n25  received an NTA and are no longer “eligible” for DACA, from those who received an NTA but remain \n“eligible” for DACA. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 32 at 21 (“Defendants’ decision to terminate DACA based on \n26 \nthe conclusion that the individual is an enforcement priority even though he remains eligible for DACA \nviolates the rules for the DACA program”). In reality, DHS considers every individual it issues an NTA \n27 \nto an enforcement priority. Further, Plaintiffs point out the obvious sticking point that contradicts their \n28  claim that DHS is applying stricter enforcement priority definitions to target DACA grantees:  \n \n    14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 22 of 33   Page ID #:1631\n \n \n1  This definition does not in itself identify an injury common to the putative class, \n2  because DACA policy provides for automatic termination in several scenarios, regardless \n3  of a criminal conviction. In addition to Defendants’ position that an NTA issued by ICE \n4  and CBP works to automatically terminate DACA, DACA also terminates automatically \n5  if a DACA recipient travels outside the United States on or after August 15, 2012 without \n6  first receiving advance parole. Dkt. No. 16-23 at Q57. Additionally, DACA may also be \nterminated without advanced notice and an opportunity to respond when DHS deems a \n7 \nDACA recipient an enforcement priority or when USCIS finds that a person is an EPS \n8 \nconcern but ICE declines to issue an NTA. See Dkt. No 16-24 at 39. Conversely, the \n9 \nDACA SOP provides that USCIS should notify an individual of its intent to terminate \n10 \nDACA and provide an opportunity to respond to intended DACA termination when \n11 \nUSCIS believes there was error in the DACA grant, the requestor committed fraud in \n12 \nseeking DACA, or when subsequent criminal activity comes to USCIS’s attention that is \n13 \nnot EPS or if ICE does not accept the case, and the circumstances require additional \n14 \ninformation to resolve USCIS’s concerns. Dkt. No. 16-24 at 38-39.  \n15 \nThe Court here would have to determine not just that an individual’s DACA was \n16 \nterminated without advance notice and an opportunity to respond, but the reason why no \n17 \nadvance notice and opportunity to respond was provided, and what process was followed \n18 \nprior to termination. Such mini-trials of each DACA termination makes class certification \n19 \nimpractical and underscores the inappropriateness of adding an additional layer of \n20 \nprocess that Congress explicitly precluded – process that is entirely outside of the \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n“Among other things, applying DHS’ new enforcement priorities to DACA recipients \n23 \nwould eviscerate the DACA program because DACA recipients by definition lack a lawful \n24  immigration status, and a large number of them have engaged in activities related to their \nlack of status—such as entering the country without authorization or driving without a \n25 \nlicense—that  would  make  them  an  immigration  enforcement  priority  were  the \n26  Memorandum to apply to them.”  \nDkt. No. 32 at 40. Relying on a proposed class where the named plaintiffs were all issued NTAs as a \n27  result of their criminal conduct fails to demonstrate how DHS is implementing one set of enforcement \npriorities or another, or that DHS is “targeting” DACA grantees. See Dkt. No. 32 at ¶¶ 8, 138, 146, 160; \n28 \nDkt. No. 39-1 at 15, 16, 18. \n \n    15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 23 of 33   Page ID #:1632\n \n \n1  established removal proceeding process. Similarly, Plaintiffs indicate only that putative \n2  class members lost DACA despite having no “disqualifying criminal convictions,” which \n3  is insufficient to determine whether each individual was an enforcement priority, received \n4  some sort of process, or whether the DACA SOP provides for process prior to \n5  termination in their cases. Rather, given the nature of the proposed class and the limited \n6  facts provided by Plaintiffs, each claim would have to be assessed individually – which \ncounsels against class certification. Flores, 2010 WL 3656807 at *5. As explained above, \n7 \neven a cursory review of Plaintiffs’ proposed putative class members identifies the \n8 \nproblem with Plaintiffs’ class. Here, numerous of the putative class members identified \n9 \nby Plaintiffs can claim no injury, and Rule 23(b)(2) requires that the challenged practice \n10 \nresult in a readily ascertainable injury to every member. Were the Court to grant the class \n11 \nthat Plaintiffs seek, countless individuals could not receive relief for insufficient injuries. \n12 \nFor example, putative class member Jessica Colotl, can no longer claim an injury based \n13 \non the termination of her DACA because, following the issuance of a preliminary \n14 \ninjunction in her case, USCIS denied her DACA renewal request after notice and an \n15 \nopportunity respond. Dkt. No. 39-13, Eiland Decl., at ¶ 7. Relatedly, at least two \n16 \nproposed class members (unnamed by Plaintiffs) have not had their DACA terminated at \n17 \nall. Id. at ¶ 15. Thus, Plaintiffs’ class definition encompasses individuals who were not \n18 \nsubject to the challenged policy, and therefore have not been injured. Colapinto, 2011 \n19 \nWL 913251 at *4.  \n20 \nMoreover, even under Plaintiffs’ incorrect interpretation of the DACA SOP, \n21 \nautomatic termination of DACA absent a criminal offense or criminal conviction does not \n22 \nnecessarily violate the SOP. And the named Plaintiffs cannot dispute that their treatment \n23 \n– having their DACA terminated following arrest on criminal grounds that ICE has \n24 \ndeemed enforcement priorities – distinguishes Defendants’ treatment of their DACA \n25 \nterminations from its treatment of other putative class members. Even if the Court found \n26 \nthat the automatic termination by NTA of Gil’s and De Souza’s DACA could be \n27 \nunlawful, there remain putative class members for whom the DACA SOP provides for \n28 \n \n    16 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 24 of 33   Page ID #:1633\n \n \n1  termination of DACA without notice, and even by NTA, following proscribed \n \n2  procedures. See Dkt. No. 16-24 at 37-39; id. at 41-44. This distinction clarifies that \n3  Plaintiffs cannot show that Defendants have acted consistently such that “a single \n4  injunction [could] protect all class members’ . . . rights.” Saravia v. Sessions, No. 17-CV-\n5  03615-VC, 2017 WL 5569838, at *23 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017) (citing Dukes, 564 U.S. \n6  at 360). This Court must deny Plaintiffs’ motion, therefore, because they have failed to \nmeet their burden under Rule 23(b)(2).  \n7 \n8  IV.  This Court must deny the motion for class certification because Plaintiffs fail \nto satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a). \n9 \nA. The Proposed Class Lacks Numerosity.  \n10 \nTo satisfy the numerosity requirement, Plaintiffs must show “that joinder of all \n11 \nmembers is impracticable.’” Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. \n12 \n1998) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1)). In their attempt to do so, Plaintiffs baldly state \n13 \nthat ‘[t]he proposed class readily satisfies the requirements of numerosity . . . and is \n14 \nreadily ascertainable.” Dkt. No. 39-1 at 9. They specify that the proposed class includes \n15 \n“at least 17 DACA recipients who, in the last ten months alone, have had their DACA \n16 \nterminated without notice or process” and add, with no support, that the proposed class \n17 \nincludes “likely many more individuals whose DACA already has been unlawfully \n18 \nterminated, which is sufficient to satisfy numerosity.” Id. (citing Ark. Educ. Ass’n v. \n19 \nBoard Of Educ. of Portland, Ark. Sch. Dist., 446 F.2d 763, 765-66 (8th Cir. 1971); Hum \n20 \nv. Dericks, 162 F.R.D. 628, 634 (D. Haw. 1995). However, at least seven of the 17 \n21 \nindividuals Plaintiffs assert belong in the class – including all named Plaintiffs – are not \n22 \nproperly considered as members of the class Plaintiffs seek to certify. See Dkt. No. 39-13, \n23 \nEiland Decl., at ¶¶ 3-15. As discussed above, the named plaintiffs are disqualified from \n24 \nrepresenting the proposed group, while proposed class members Lopez and Ramirez were \n25 \nissued NTAs because of conduct rendering each a “top enforcement priority.” See NTA \n26 \nMemo, Dkt. No. 16-25 at 4-5. At least two more of the remaining proposed class \n27 \nmembers have not had their DACA terminated, Dkt. No 39-13 at ¶ 15, and, absent an \n28 \nactionable injury, they are also not appropriate class members. See Hodgers-Durgin v. de \n \n    17 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 25 of 33   Page ID #:1634\n \n \n1  la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1045 (9th Cir. 1999). \n2  Of the remaining ten proposed class members, Plaintiffs indicate only that they are \n3  aware that these individuals lost DACA despite having no “disqualifying criminal \n4  convictions,” which, as explained above, is insufficient to determine whether each \n5  individual received process or whether the DACA SOP provides for process prior to \n6  termination in their cases. Rather, given the nature of the proposed class and the limited \nfacts provided by Plaintiffs, each claim would have to be assessed individually – which \n7 \ncounsels against class certification. Flores, 2010 WL 3656807 at *5.  \n8 \n Notably, Plaintiffs cite no Ninth Circuit cases to support their claim that 17 – \n9 \nmuch less 10 – identified class members meet the numerosity requirement, which is \n10 \nunderstandable, as, “in general, courts find the numerosity requirement satisfied when a \n11 \nclass includes at least 40 members.” Rannis v. Recchia, 380 Fed. Appx. 646, 651 (9th Cir. \n12 \n2010); Harik v. Cal. Teachers Ass'n, 326 F.3d 1042, 1051 (9th Cir. 2003) (“The Supreme \n13 \nCourt has held fifteen is too small. The certification of those classes must be vacated on \n14 \nnumerosity grounds.”), citing Gen. Tel. Co. of the Nw., Inc. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 \n15 \n(1980); Santos, 2014 WL 12558009 at *11 (“As a general rule, [however,] classes of 20 \n16 \nare too small.”). Instead, they assert that, because Plaintiffs’ proposed class also includes \n17 \nindividuals who will have their DACA terminated without notice or process, despite \n18 \ncontinuing to be eligible, if Defendants’ policies and practices are not enjoined,” the \n19 \nproposed class contains “[h]undreds of thousands of DACA recipients.” Dkt. No. 33-1 at \n20 \n18. This figure is utter speculation, however, and the Court should give it no credit. \n21 \nMoreover, contrary to Plaintiffs’ mistaken characterization, Defendants did not \n22 \n“represent[] that . . . identifying ‘all automatic terminations of DACA would . . . involve \n23 \na manual review of hundreds of cases.’” Dkt. No. 39-1 at 8 (Plaintiffs’ emphasis). \n24 \nDefendants’ actually stated that, in contrast to identifying 14 automatic DACA \n25 \nterminations based on the issuance of an NTA by ICE or CBP over five years, \n26 \n“[c]onducting a more fulsome review of all automatic terminations of DACA would be \n27 \nburdensome, because it would involve a manual review of hundreds of cases.” Dkt. No. \n28 \n \n    18 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 26 of 33   Page ID #:1635\n \n \n1  23-2 at ¶ 5 (emphasis added). Far from supporting Plaintiffs’ claim to a unified class of \n2  hundreds of individuals suffering the same harm, the statement demonstrates various \n3  avenues of automatic DACA termination for various reasons, very few of which on their \n4  surface correspond to the proposed class definition. There is no way to confirm, without \n5  individual analysis, whether an individual’s automatic DACA termination would fit the \n6  proposed class, and, if so, whether that person would be entitled to the relief sought here.  \nFinally, although “the number of class members is the most important factor, the \n7 \nultimate question concerns the practicability of their joinder.” S. Gensler, Federal Rules \n8 \nof Civil Procedure, Rules and Commentary at 540 (2017). Plaintiffs have proffered no \n9 \nargument whatsoever to suggest that joinder of those affected by the Government’s \n10 \nactions at issue in this case would not be practicable. Plaintiffs rely only on the “presence \n11 \nof . . . future class members” to argue that joinder is “inherently impracticable,” Dkt. No. \n12 \n33-1 at 19, however the various injuries that could be asserted by future members of \n13 \nPlaintiffs’ proposed class – who may be impacted differently by Defendants’ DACA \n14 \ntermination policies and is a shrinking population given the wind down of the DACA \n15 \npolicy – only demonstrates that joinder would not be appropriate, not that joinder is \n16 \nimpracticable.  \n17 \nB. The Proposed Class Lacks Commonality. \n18 \nAs Plaintiffs note, commonality requires them to show that “there are questions of \n19 \nlaw or fact common to the class” (Dkt. No. 33-1 at 19, citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2)) \n20 \nand some courts have construed the commonality requirement “permissively.” Id. (citing \n21 \nPreap v. Johnson, 303 F.R.D. 566, 585 (N.D. Cal. 2014), aff’d, 831 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. \n22 \n2016) (quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998)) (internal \n23 \nquotation marks omitted). Other courts, of course, have construed it more “rigorous[ly].” \n24 \nSee, e.g., Leyva v. Medline Indus. Inc., 716 F.3d 510, 512 (9th Cir. 2013) (citation \n25 \nomitted).  \n26 \nHere, however, Plaintiffs face two obstacles to meeting their burden to show \n27 \ncommonality, which forecloses a finding of commonality under a permissive or rigorous \n28 \n \n    19 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 27 of 33   Page ID #:1636\n \n \n1  approach. First, the individualized analysis underlying each putative plaintiff’s claim \n2  renders this action inapt for class consideration. It is not enough, as Plaintiffs proffer, to \n3  allege that they “have suffered the same injury.” Dkt. No. 33-1 at 21. Rather, the \n4  Supreme Court has clarified that: \n5  [w]hat  matters  to  class  certification.  .  .  is  not  the  raising  of  common \n‘questions’—even  in  droves—but,  rather  the  capacity  of  a  classwide \n6 \nproceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the \n7  litigation. Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential \nto impede the generation of common answers. \n8 \n9  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs cannot plausibly argue that the \n10  Government is barred outright from terminating an individual’s DACA. See, e.g., Dkt. \n11  No. 16-24 at 37-39. Moreover, as applied here, Plaintiffs cannot dispute that DHS may \n12  determine before an individual’s DACA expires that prosecutorial discretion is no longer \n13  warranted. Id. An individual whose conduct qualifies him or her as an “enforcement \n14  priority” may no longer merit a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion through \n15  continued receipt of deferred action under DACA, and such an individual would lack \n16  standing to challenge the termination of their DACA.  Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. \n17  Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 976 (9th Cir. 2017) (“the INA is replete with provisions that \nconfer prosecutorial discretion on the Executive to establish its own enforcement \n18 \npriorities . . . . Third parties generally may not contest the exercise of this discretion.”) \n19 \n(citing Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973). Finally, Plaintiffs are \n20 \nincorrect that DACA cannot be terminated without notice and an opportunity to respond \n21 \noutside of having a “disqualifying” criminal conviction. See Dkt. No. 16-24 at 37-39; \n22 \nDkt. No. 16-23 at Q57. Determining whether an individual’s DACA terminated because \n23 \nof the issuance of an NTA or because of some other discretionary decision would require \n24 \nprecisely the type of individualized analysis the Supreme Court recognized could prevent \n25 \na finding of commonality. Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ tortured effort to \n26 \ndevelop “sub-classes” to avoid the differing circumstances presented by those DACA \n27 \n28 \n \n    20 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 28 of 33   Page ID #:1637\n \n \n1  recipients who engage in criminal activity or who are enforcement priorities only \n2  underscores the lack of commonality here. \n3  Further, the SOP describes the procedures USCIS should follow for USCIS to \n4  terminate DACA, but it does not void the effects of an NTA issued by ICE or CBP agents \n5  in terminating DACA. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 16-13 at 3 (directing ICE and CBP agents to \n6  “exercise their discretion, on an individual basis” to determine whether to issue an NTA \nor defer action, without reference to whether an individual already has deferred action). \n7 \nDefendants, then, have never limited the discretion of ICE or CBP agents to issue an \n8 \nNTA to an individual regardless of whether the individual has deferred action – of which \n9 \nDACA is only one form. The SOP, therefore, does not relate to those individuals, but \n10 \nonly to those putative class members who come to the attention of USCIS before the \n11 \nissuance of an NTA so that USCIS could act using the steps the SOP describes.   \n12 \nAdditionally, even if the Court overlooked Plaintiffs’ carve out of enforcement \n13 \npriority terminations without notice and an opportunity to respond, like named Plaintiffs \n14 \nGil and De Souza, they would still lack commonality with any individual whose DACA \n15 \nwas terminated without advance notice and an opportunity to respond but was not found \n16 \nto be an enforcement priority (under Plaintiffs’ mistaken application of that term). Other \n17 \nputative class members may be in removal proceedings as a result of termination of their \n18 \nDACA by NTA issuance, and some may even have an administratively final order of \n19 \nremoval or have already been removed. The status of these removal proceedings \n20 \ndemonstrates further commonality problems for the proposed class because some \n21 \nindividuals may be eligible to seek relief from removal in the course of their removal \n22 \nproceedings, like cancellation of removal, that could result in a benefit that removes the \n23 \nneed for DACA, and those removed may no longer be eligible to have their DACA and \n24 \nemployment authorization reinstated. \n25 \nThese “dissimilarities,” then, “impede the generation of common answers,” such \n26 \nthat class certification is not appropriate. See Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350. Because Plaintiffs \n27 \ncannot meet their burden to show they have met the commonality requirement of Fed. R. \n28 \n \n    21 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 29 of 33   Page ID #:1638\n \n \n1  Civ. P. 23(a), the Court must deny their motion to certify a class. See Preap v. Johnson, \n2  303 F.R.D. 566, 584 (N.D. Cal. 2014), aff’d, 831 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing Dukes, \n3  564 U.S. at 350; Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 620 (1997)). \n4  C. The Proposed Class Lacks Typicality. \n5  To establish typicality, Plaintiffs must show “whether other members have the \n6  same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the \n7  named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have been injured by the same course \nof conduct.” Hanon v. Dataproducts, 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting \n8 \nSchwartz v. Harp, 108 F.R.D. 279, 282 (C.D. Cal. 1985)). The typicality requirement is \n9 \nnot met if the proposed class representatives are subject to unique defenses. Id.  \n10 \nHere, the Court cannot find typicality. An order requiring the Defendants to \n11 \nprovide the notice that Plaintiffs seek cannot afford many of the putative plaintiffs – as \n12 \nwell as the named Plaintiffs - with any relief whatsoever.9 As explained above, the \n13 \nDACA SOP provides for termination of DACA without advance notice and an \n14 \nopportunity to respond in some circumstances, as well as automatically through NTA \n15 \nissuance, but the circumstances by which DACA is terminated without advance notice \n16 \nand an opportunity to respond may differ. For example, Defendants maintain that \n17 \nindividuals like Plaintiffs Gil Robles and De Souza Moreira are subject to automatic \n18 \ntermination of DACA by NTA due to a determination that each was an enforcement \n19 \npriority. Even if the Court ignored that Plaintiffs have carved out enforcement priority \n20 \ncases from their class definition, the SOP nonetheless supports a different path for \n21 \nautomatic termination of DACA by NTA issuance for other putative class members \n22 \nfollowing referral by USCIS based on EPS or USCIS’s enforcement priority finding. Dkt. \n23 \nNo. 16-24 at 38. Injunctive relief ordering Defendants to provide additional process to \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n9 Defendants’ typicality argument essentially mirrors its argument that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their \n26  commonality requirement. The “commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.” \nGen. Tel. Co., 457 U.S. at 157 n.13. “Both serve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular \n27  circumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiff’s claim and \nthe class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately \n28 \nprotected in their absence.” Id. \n \n    22 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 30 of 33   Page ID #:1639\n \n \n1  those individuals, therefore, would contradict the SOP, involve a different issue than the \n2  claims raised by Plaintiffs Gil and De Souza, and demand a different result. See Hanon, \n3  976 F.2d at 508 (“class certification is inappropriate where a putative class representative \n4  is subject to unique defenses which threaten to become the focus of the litigation.”).  \n5  Moreover, the unique defenses required to respond to the various procedures by \n6  which DACA may be terminated without notice counsel against class certification. See, \ne.g., Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 984 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The test of \n7 \ntypicality ‘is whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action \n8 \nis based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class \n9 \nmembers have been injured by the same course of conduct.”) (marks and citation \n10 \nomitted); Arnott v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 290 F.R.D. 579, 587 (C.D. \n11 \nCal. 2012) (the injunctive and declaratory relief sought must “resolve an issue that is \n12 \ncentral to the validity of each one of the [class members’] claims.”) (citing Dukes, 564 \n13 \nU.S. at 350). For example, unlike Defendants’ defense of DACA termination by NTA \n14 \nissued by ICE or CBP, the defense of an EPS or enforcement priority termination would \n15 \nbe different both with regard to the APA, because of the specific guidance provided in the \n16 \nDACA SOP and the record supporting USCIS’s compliance with that SOP, and, under \n17 \nPlaintiffs’ incorrect due process theory, with regard to the Constitution, because of the \n18 \nSOP’s impact on any expectations that could give rise to a Constitutional claim and on \n19 \nthe Matthews analysis. \n20 \nAccordingly, where putative class members cannot allege the same injuries by the \n21 \nsame course of conduct, and where the defenses to the various potential sources of the \n22 \nputative class’s injuries are unique, the Court should find Plaintiffs’ proposed class lacks \n23 \ntypicality and deny Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  \n24 \nD. Plaintiffs are not Adequate Representatives. \n25 \nThe Plaintiffs are not adequate class representatives because their interests may \n26 \nconflict with the interests of other putative class members. The adequacy requirement \n27 \nserves to protect the due process rights of absent class members who will be bound by the \n28 \n \n    23 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 31 of 33   Page ID #:1640\n \n \n1  judgment. Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998). A \n2  determination of legal adequacy is based on two inquiries: “(1) do the named plaintiffs \n3  and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class members, and (2) will the \n4  named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the \n5  class?” Id. Indeed, “uncovering conflicts of interest between the named parties and the \n6  class they seek to represent is a critical purpose of the adequacy inquiry.” Rodriguez v. \n7  West Publ’g Corp., 563 F.3d 948, 959 (9th Cir. 2009). This notion is compounded by the \n8  nature of a class certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), the members of which do not have a \n9  right to opt out of their class. See Molski v. Gleich, 318 F.3d 937, 947 (9th Cir. 2003) \n10  (citing Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Brown, 511 U.S. 117, 121 (1994) (per curiam)). \n11  Additionally, where a class representative is not entitled to the relief sought, adequacy of \n12  representation is not satisfied. See Hodgers-Durgin, 199 F.3d at 1045 (“Unless the named \n13  plaintiffs are themselves entitled to seek injunctive relief, they may not represent a class \n14  seeking that relief.”).  \n15  First, not even the three named Plaintiffs are properly part of the class that \n16  Plaintiffs seeks to certify. Plaintiff Arreola’s DACA and EAD were reinstated pursuant to \n17  Court order and he has been provided notice and opportunity to respond to his intended \ntermination, and Plaintiffs Gil and De Souza were issued NTAs by ICE after being found \n18 \nto be enforcement priorities due to criminal conduct, making them part of the sub-class \n19 \nthat Plaintiffs specifically carve out of this class certification motion. Additionally, \n20 \nbecause the claims each of the named Plaintiffs is subject to dismissal, as discussed in \n21 \nDefendants’ accompanying opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, \n22 \nand to be addressed in Defendants’ forthcoming motion to dismiss, class certification on \n23 \nthe basis of their claims is also inappropriate at this time. Lierboe v. State Farm Mut. \n24 \nAuto. Ins. Co., 350 F.3d 1018, 1023 (9th Cir. 2003). \n25 \nThe Court should also deny Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification due to the \n26 \ndivergent interests between Plaintiffs and the proposed class members. In fact, at least \n27 \ntwo of the individuals Plaintiffs identify as putative class members, Ramirez Medina and \n28 \n \n    24 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 32 of 33   Page ID #:1641\n \n \n1  Colotl, have pursued their own lawsuits that are well ahead of this action. In fact, the \n2  advanced stage of her proceeding combined with the fact that Colotl is represented by the \n3  same counsel in this proceeding also raises the question of conflicts of interests for \n4  proposed class counsel. See Colotl v. Kelly, No. 1:17-CV-1670-MHC (N.D. Ga.); Lerwill \n5  v. Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc., 582 F.2d 507, 512 (9th Cir. 1978). Finally, potentially \n6  many other putative class members, even with ongoing removal proceedings, may be able \n7  to reapply for DACA and could receive additional process, which may prove more \n8  expedient than waiting for the outcome of this litigation, which may ultimately prove \n9  unsuccessful to the class as a whole. Still others may have obtained dismissal of the NTA \n10  that resulted in the automatic termination of their DACA and then reapplied for deferred \n11  action, and potentially many others, even with removal proceedings ongoing, may be able \n12  to request DACA again pursuant to the injunction in Regents, while the injunction \n13  remains in place, and could receive additional process, which may prove more expedient \n14  than waiting for the outcome of this litigation. \n15  CONCLUSION \n  Plaintiffs have proffered a class that is overbroad under Federal Rule 23(b)(2) and \n16 \nthat fails to meet any of the requirements of Rule 23(a). Rather, Plaintiffs cannot show \n17 \nthat Defendants have failed or refused to act in a way that affects the class as a whole, or \n18 \nthat a single injunction could benefit every member of the putative class; and the named \n19 \nplaintiffs are situated so dramatically differently – whether because they do not face the \n20 \nsame prospect of imminent harm or because they fall into an “enforcement priority” – \n21 \nfrom other members of the putative class that they cannot adequately represent the \n22 \ninterests of those individuals. Moreover, Plaintiffs would require the Court to engage in \n23 \nan individualized inquiry into each claim to determine the rationale behind each putative \n24 \nplaintiff’s DACA termination. Plaintiffs are therefore not entitled to proceed as a class, \n25 \nand the Court must deny their motion. \n26 \n   \n27 \n28 \n \n    25 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 53   Filed 02/01/18   Page 33 of 33   Page ID #:1642\n \n \nDATED: February 1, 2018  Respectfully Submitted, \n1 \n \n2  CHAD A.

No. 32], \n7 following Defendants’ restoration of Plaintiff Arreola’s Deferred Action for Childhood \n8 Arrivals (“DACA”) and employment authorization document (“EAD”), per this Court’s \n9 November 21, 2017, Order. [Dkt. No. 31].  \n10 Plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges Defendants “have targeted numerous DACA \n11 recipients and unlawfully revoked the grants of deferred action and work permits they \n12 have received even though these individuals have abided by all the program rules and \n13 have not engaged in any conduct that would disqualify them from the program.” Dkt. No. \n14 32 at ¶ 1. On this basis, Plaintiffs seek the extraordinary relief of forcing DHS to reinstate \n15 their DACA and enjoining the Government from terminating DACA in the future for the \n16 individual plaintiffs as well as for a nationwide class of those similarly situated. \nHowever, Plaintiffs’ allegations fall apart when examined in full context. Each \n17\nPlaintiff was arrested for engaging in criminal activities, determined to be an enforcement \n18\npriority, and placed into removal proceedings, which had the unremarkable effect of \n19\nterminating their DACA. Every step of the process Defendants followed is accounted for \n20\nin DACA policy and immigration law, and Plaintiffs were forewarned of the risk to their \n21\nDACA for engaging in criminal activity. Plaintiffs offer no support for their claim that \n22\nDefendants are “targeting” DACA grantees for wholesale automatic termination.  \n23\nThe Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended complaint as a challenge to the \n24\nGovernment’s authority to initiate removal proceedings, which this Court lacks \n25\njurisdiction to review. Furthermore, Congress has made clear that any claims the Court \n26\nmay find cognizable, including constitutional claims, related to the initiation or conduct \n27\nof removal proceedings against Plaintiffs, must be raised in those proceedings before an \n28\n    1 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 12 of 33   Page ID #:1781\n \n   \n1 immigration judge, and appealed to a court of appeals through the for review process if \n2 necessary. If the Court were to find jurisdiction to hear these challenges to the initiation \n3 of removal proceedings, it should still dismiss for failing to state a claim for which relief \n4 can be granted. Deferred action is an entirely discretionary grace, not an immigration \n5 benefit nor a protection from removal.  \n6 BACKGROUND \n7 When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) or U.S. Customs and \n8 Border Protection (“CBP”) issues a notice to appear (“NTA”) to a DACA grantee, \n9 regardless of the reason, there is no requirement in the DACA SOP or elsewhere for \n10 USCIS to make a separate decision to terminate the individual’s DACA or EAD.1 Rather, \n11 the decision to issue an NTA to an individual with DACA is the decision to no longer \n12 defer action against that individual, and the charge selected for the NTA does not have to \n13 reflect DHS’s full reasoning. Nothing restricts DHS’s authority to issue an NTA because \n14 someone was previously found to warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion \n15 in the form of deferred action, nor is a criminal conviction or criminal charge necessary \n16 to justify termination of DACA. While the Napolitano Memo and DACA SOP identify \n17 and explain threshold criteria for DACA consideration, nothing limits DHS’s discretion \n18 to grant, deny, or terminate DACA on a case by case basis.2 Nor is the DACA SOP the \n19 only authority establishing the process by which deferred action terminates. \nPlaintiff Arreola had his DACA and EAD terminated automatically through the \n20\nissuance of an NTA, after CBP law enforcement officers encountered him engaged in \n21\n22\n                                                 \n23\n1 Defendants incorporate by reference the explanation of the DACA policy, the EAD application process \nfor individuals with no lawful status, and the process by which removal proceedings are initiated through \n24\nNTA issuance, provided in Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Class Certification, Section \n25 II.A and B. Dkt. No. 53 at 7-13. \n26 2 In fact, USCIS may still grant DACA to an individual with a disqualifying criminal conviction, See Dkt. \nNo. 53-1 at 70; or deny DACA to an individual with no criminal history. Id. at 38 (“Individuals may be \n27 considered for DACA upon showing that they meet the prescribed guidelines . . .”); id. at 78 (“USCIS \nlacks the authority to consider requests from individuals who are in immigration detention under the \n28\ncustody of ICE at the time of filing”). \n    2 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 13 of 33   Page ID #:1782\n \n   \n1 alien smuggling, the facts of which he conceded in an interview with Border Patrol \n2 Agents. See Dkt. 23-2 at 26, 56-57. Mr. Arreola’s DACA and EAD were then reinstated \n3 on November 22, 2017, and on December 20, 2017, DHS issued a Notice of Intent to \n4 Terminate pursuant to this Court’s Order. See Dkt. No. 31; Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 87. \n5 On September 20, 2017, Plaintiff Gil was arrested and charged with two felonies, \n6 including assault in the first degree and transferring a firearm without a background \n7 check to a prohibited person. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 4-7, 9-15. On November 6, 2017, \n8 ICE issued Gil an NTA charging him with unlawful presence. Id. On November 14, \n9 2017, USCIS issued him a Notice of Action, stating his DACA and EAD terminated \n10 automatically with the NTA. See Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 109.  \n11 On November 3, 2017, Plaintiff De Souza was arrested for forgery in the first \n12 degree, a felony.3 See Dkt. 53-1 at 17-18, 20-24. De Souza admitted to police that he \n13 had altered the expiration date on his driver’s license due to it expiring. Id. On \n14 November 5, 2017, ICE issued De Souza an NTA charging unlawful presence, and on \n15 November 10, 2017, USCIS issued a Notice of Action informing De Souza his DACA \n16 and EAD terminated automatically with the NTA. Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 129. \n17 Organizational Plaintiff Inland Empire claims no injury of its own, and only \nprospective harm to its members. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 135 (“Defendants’ unlawful \n18\ntermination policies and practices are likely to harm IEIYC DACA recipients.”).  \n19\nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n20\nRegardless of how the arguments are framed, Plaintiffs directly challenge DHS’s \n21\nauthority to initiate removal proceedings, which this Court should dismiss for lack of \n22\nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and 8 \n23\nU.S.C. § 1252. By definition, a demand to restore deferred action terminated by the \n24\ninitiation of removal proceedings challenges the agency’s determination to initiate \n25\nremoval proceedings. Any interpretation of these statutes that permits district court \n26\n27                                                  \n3  Plaintiffs  incorrectly  assert  that  Plaintiff  De  Souza  was  arrested  for  “possession  of  an  altered \n28\nidentification document—a misdemeanor.” Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 101. \n    3 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 14 of 33   Page ID #:1783\n \n   \n1 challenges to actions inextricably linked to the initiation of removal proceedings would \n2 run counter to Congress’s intent, to Supreme Court case law, and to the law of this \n3 Circuit. Plaintiffs’ due process challenges must also fail, because they cannot show a \n4 protected interest in DACA or EADs. In fact, reinstating Plaintiffs’ EADs following the \n5 institution of removal proceedings would violate duly-enacted DHS regulations that \n6 operate independent of, and superior to, DACA policy.  \n7 Additionally, Plaintiffs Arreola and Inland Empire lack standing in this matter. \n8 Most importantly, and contrary to Plaintiffs’ unsupported allegations, DHS issued \n9 Plaintiffs NTAs based on individualized determinations that Plaintiffs’ criminal conduct \n10 rendered them enforcement priorities, and it did so with the knowledge of each Plaintiffs’ \n11 DACA. Thus, the decision to initiate removal proceedings preceded the consequence of \n12 Plaintiffs’ DACA and EAD terminating, and no reasonable argument can be made that the \n13 terminations did not arise out of that decision, such that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) prevents this \n14 Court from reviewing either step. To the extent this Court may find Plaintiffs have any \n15 viable legal claims arising from the “decision[s] or action[s]” of DHS to initiate removal \n16 against these Plaintiffs, Congress enacted 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a and 1252 to channel those \nclaims to an immigration court and ultimately to the appropriate court of appeals.  \n17\n18 ARGUMENT \n19\nI.  Standard of Review \n20\nA. Dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) \n21\nBecause federal courts have limited jurisdiction, a court must dismiss any case if it \n22\nlacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1); Owen Equip. & \n23\nErection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 374 (1978). “A federal court is presumed to lack \n24\njurisdiction in a particular case unless the contrary affirmatively appears.” Stock W., Inc. \n25\nv. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, 873 F.2d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir. 1989). \n26\nThe elements necessary to establish standing “must be supported in the same way as any \n27\nother matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.” Lujan v. Defenders of \n28\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). Moreover, when the issue of jurisdiction is separable \n    4 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 15 of 33   Page ID #:1784\n \n   \n1 from the merits of the case, no presumption of truthfulness attaches to a plaintiff’s \n2 allegations, and the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction exists. Thornhill \n3 Publ’g Co. v. Gen. Tel. & Elecs. Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 733 (9th Cir. 1979). \n4 The “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” to assert federal court \n5 jurisdiction requires “the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact . . . which is . . . \n6 concrete and particularized, . . . the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged \n7 action of the defendant, and . . . it must be likely . . . that the injury will be redressed by a \n8 favorable decision.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal citations and modifications omitted).  \n9 “Allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Art[icle] III.” \n10 Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Program v. U.S. Drug Enf’t Admin., 860 F.3d \n11 1228, 1235 (9th Cir. 2017), citing Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1141 \n12 (2013). Finally, while an imminent future harm may establish standing, the harm alleged \n13 cannot be the result of plaintiff’s own unlawful conduct. Id. at 1042, quoting O’Shea v. \n14 Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 497 (1974). \n15 An organization suing on its own behalf must also show that the claimed injury is \n16 “both a diversion of its resources and a frustration of its mission.” La Asociacion de \nTrabajadores de Lake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, 624 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010). \n17\nAn organization suing on behalf of its members must show that: “(1) its members would \n18\notherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the interests it seeks to protect are \n19\ngermane to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief \n20\nrequested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” Int’l Union, \n21\nUnited Auto., Aerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 282 \n22\n(1986).   \n23\nB. Dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \n24\nTo survive dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), “the complaint must allege sufficient \n25\nfacts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n26\n550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Although the Court must accept as true all well-pleaded \n27\nfactual allegations when determining the legal sufficiency of a claim, it need not credit \n28\n    5 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 16 of 33   Page ID #:1785\n \n   \n1 “legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.” Id. at 555. “Threadbare recitals of the \n2 elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” \n3 Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  . \n4 II.  Plaintiff Inland Empire should be dismissed for lack of standing  \n5 Plaintiff Inland Empire lacks standing on its own and lacks standing on behalf of \n6 its members. Inland Empire describes the work that it has done for and with DACA \n7 recipients, both as members and as clients, since the policy’s inception. See Dkt. No. 32 \n8 at 29-31. However, Inland Empire makes no claim that the Government’s actions have \n9 diverted its resources or frustrated its mission in the service of members who have lost \n10 DACA without advanced notice or an opportunity to respond. See La Asociacion de \n11 Trabajadores de Lake Forest, 624 F.3d at 1088. Nor does Inland Empire identify a single \nmember of its organization who has lost DACA with or without advanced notice. In fact, \n12\nPlaintiff is clear that its sole concern in this matter is the prospective harm its members \n13\nmay possibly face in the future. Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 135 (“Defendants’ unlawful termination \n14\npolicies and practices are likely to harm IEIYC DACA recipients.”); Or. Prescription \n15\nDrug Monitoring Program, 860 F.3d at 1235.  \n16\nThus, Inland Empire has not shown organizational injury, and it may not represent \n17\nits individual members unless those members themselves would have standing as \n18\nplaintiffs, and then only if those individual members would not be required to participate \n19\nin the lawsuit. Brock, 477 U.S. at 282. Here, Plaintiffs’ amended complaint does not \n20\nestablish standing for even one of Inland Empire’s members. Even if it did, the very fact-\n21\nspecific inquiry necessary to determine why such a fictional plaintiff lost his or her \n22\nDACA, and whether he or she would be entitled to additional process before such \n23\ntermination, would require that person to participate in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs offer no \n24\nrationale to overcome these requirements. Furthermore, while Inland Empire alleges \n25\nfuture potential harm to its members even if they do not commit any disqualifying \n26\nconduct, the only present harm plaintiffs allege in their complaint is DACA termination \n27\n28\n    6 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 17 of 33   Page ID #:1786\n \n   \n1 that was based on the unlawful conduct of the plaintiffs.4 And a plaintiff may not assert \n2 standing based on future harm that would only occur if the plaintiff first engages in \n3 unlawful behavior. Hodgers-Durgin, v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1042 (9th Cir. 1999). \n4 Plaintiffs offer no examples of a DACA recipient whose DACA automatically terminated \n5 without having first engaged in criminal activity. Thus, they show no basis for standing \n6 on the premise that such an action might occur to one of their members sometime in the \n7 future. Because Plaintiff Inland Empire fails to meet the standing requirements for an \n8 individual or an organization, it should be dismissed from this action.  \n9 III.  Plaintiff Arreola Robles should be dismissed from this action for lack of \nstanding and because his claim is no longer ripe \n10\nBecause Plaintiff Arreola’s DACA and EAD were reinstated on November 22, \n11\n2017, pursuant to this Court’s Order, and he subsequently filed an amended complaint on \n12\nDecember 21, 2017, the grounds he asserted for standing in his original complaint are no \n13\nlonger before this Court, and he has failed to establish any injury in the amended \n14\ncomplaint ripe for this Court’s adjudication. See Dkt. Nos. 31, 32. As discussed in the \n15\nprevious section, the Court may not find standing based on the possibility of future harm \n16\nto cure his present lack of standing, particularly if that possible future harm is predicated \n17\non Plaintiff’s future unlawful conduct.  \n18\nWhen “a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then voluntarily amends the \n19\ncomplaint, courts look to the amended complaint to determine jurisdiction.” Rockwell \n20\nInt'l Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007). Thus, the fact that Plaintiff Arreola \n21\nhad a valid DACA grant at the time he filed his amended complaint means he lacks \n22\nstanding to assert any injury from the termination of his DACA in the present action.  \n23\nFurthermore, where Defendants have issued Plaintiff Arreola a Notice of Intent to \n24\nTerminate his DACA, along with an opportunity to respond to their intended action, the \n25\npossibility that he will experience automatic termination of his DACA without such \n26\nnotice and opportunity in the future (or that such a termination would be based on \n27\n                                                 \n28 4 As explained below, the particular charge of unlawful presence on each plaintiff’s NTA is not the only \nreason the NTA was issued, and the lack of additional charges on the NTA does not infirm the process.  \n    7 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 18 of 33   Page ID #:1787\n \n   \n1 something other than his criminal conduct) is essentially nil. Additionally, Plaintiff \n2 Arreola’s challenge to his ongoing NOIT process – intending to terminate his DACA \n3 based on the determination that he is an enforcement priority – is not ripe because \n4 Defendants’ action is not final. See 5 U.S.C. § 704 (“Agency action made reviewable by \n5 statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are \n6 subject to judicial review.”); Kings Cty. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 694 F. App’x 472, 473 \n7 (9th Cir. 2017) (“We have neither Constitutional jurisdiction nor statutory jurisdiction \n8 because the Declaratory Order was not final. Expressing our views regarding that order \n9 would amount to an advisory opinion, which would not resolve ‘concrete legal issues, \n10 presented in actual cases, not abstractions.’”) (citations omitted). Plaintiff Arreola now \n11 has the opportunity to argue to USCIS that his DACA should not be terminated. Though \n12 Defendants maintain that the decision to terminate any individual’s DACA is committed \n13 to agency discretion and ultimately unreviewable, the lack of a final agency decision in \n14 Plaintiff Arreola’s case is an additional basis for this Court to dismiss him from this \n15 action.  \n16 IV.  This Court must dismiss the amended complaint because Plaintiffs fail to \nestablish this Court’s jurisdiction  \n17\nThe Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s APA and Constitutional claims. First, this \n18\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review any challenge to DHS’s discretionary determination to issue \n19\nan NTA, which had the result of automatically terminating DACA and EAD. Second, Plaintiffs \n20\ncannot state a claim because there is no protected entitlement to DACA or employment \n21\nauthorization. Finally, nothing in the APA or constitutional jurisprudence, nor Defendants’ own \n22\npolicies and guidance, supports a right to review or constrain DHS’s exercise of discretion or to \n23\ngrant Plaintiffs procedural rights other than those available through removal proceedings.  \n24\nA. DHS’s discretion to initiate removal proceedings and their effect on the \n25\ntermination of Plaintiffs’ DACA is not reviewable. \n26\nThe APA permits persons aggrieved by final agency action to obtain judicial review in \n27\nfederal court where “there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” See 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. A \n28\nreviewing court shall set aside agency action found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n    8 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 19 of 33   Page ID #:1788\n \n   \n1 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” or “without observance of procedure \n2 required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). However, the APA precludes judicial review of \n3 agency decisions when “statutes preclude judicial review,” or when the decision is “committed \n4 to agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), (a)(2); see Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, \n5 830 (1985) (“even where Congress has not affirmatively precluded review, review is not to be \n6 had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to \n7 judge the agency's exercise of discretion.”).  \n8 Thus, there are two reasons APA jurisdiction is not available here. First, there is no \n9 separate decision to terminate DACA in these cases because a DHS law enforcement officer \n10 decided, in consideration of each plaintiff’s criminal activity, to initiate removal proceedings \n11 and issued an NTA that automatically terminated DACA; and second, even if the Court found a \n12 separate decision was made, there is still no standard in the SOP or otherwise by which the \n13 Court may review a decision that deferring action is no longer in the Government’s interest.  \n14 Additionally, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims \n15 because Plaintiffs necessarily lack a protected constitutional interest in the process by \n16 which their DACA is terminated, because the ultimate relief they seek – deferred action – \nis discretionary. Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).  \n17\n18 i.  Judicial review is barred under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1) because the INA \nlimits review of Plaintiffs’ claims, which arise from DHS’s decision \n19\nto commence Plaintiffs’ removal proceedings. \n20\nCongress eliminated judicial review over “any cause or claim by or on behalf of \n21\nany alien . . . arising from the decision or action . . . to . . . adjudicate cases . . .” 8 U.S.C. \n22\n§ 1252(g). The issuance of an NTA is a necessary predicate to commencing removal \n23\nproceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). Through section 1252(g), Congress explicitly precluded \n24\njudicial review of any challenge arising from any decision or action to commence \n25\nremoval proceedings. See Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (“AADC”), 525 U.S. \n26\n471, 483-85 (1999) (finding section 1252(g) also precludes review of the discretionary decision \n27\nto not initiate removal proceedings); see, e.g., Vilchiz-Soto v. Holder, 688 F.3d 642, 644 (9th \n28\nCir. 2012) (holding section 1252(g) barred jurisdiction to review the BIA’s discretionary \n    9 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 20 of 33   Page ID #:1789\n \n   \n1 decision to not reopen removal proceedings to consider a DACA request).5 The Supreme \n2 Court explained that section 1252(g) was “directed against a particular evil: attempts to \n3 impose judicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.” AADC 588 F.3d at 485 n.9; id. \n4 at 485 (treating “‘no deferred action’ decisions” as “discretionary determinations”); cf. \n5 Silva v. United States, 866 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir. 2017) (section 1252(g) precludes \n6 review of decision to execute removal order even where claim that agency lacked \n7 discretion because removal violated law).  \n8 Section 1252(g) encompasses “cause[s] or claim[s]” that arise from the decision \n9 “or action” to “commence proceedings” against any individual. See, e.g., Sissoko v. \n10 Rocha, 509 F.3d 947, 948-50 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding claim of money damages arose \n11 from decision or action to commence removal proceedings and was, thus, barred by 8 \n12 U.S.C. § 1252(g)); see, e.g., Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1160-61 (9th Cir. 2004) \n13 (finding review of the reopening of removal proceedings, but not the administrative \n14 closure of proceedings, was barred from review as an action related to the decision to \n15 commence removal); Botezatu v. INS, 195 F.3d 311, 314 (7th Cir. 1999) ( (discussing the \n16 scope of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) as including “various decision . . . leading up to order \n17 consequent upon final orders of deportation.”) (citations and quotations omitted).6 A \nDACA grant is acknowledgement that DHS is not presently pursuing removal against an \n18\nindividual. Thus, when DHS finds an individual has become an enforcement priority and \n19\nissues an NTA, DACA will logically terminate and such consequence falls squarely \n20\nwithin the province of section 1252(g). See, e.g., Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1160-61. To hold \n21\notherwise would render section 1252(g) a dead letter because any individual could seek \n22\nto enjoin or otherwise challenge the commencement of removal proceedings through this \n23\n                                                 \n24\n5 This authority is consistent with earlier case law interpreting the 1981 Operating Instructions, a previous \n25 policy that provided guidelines for the exercise of deferred action.  See Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 \nF.2d 1021, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985). \n26\n6 Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2004), is distinguishable from this case and Sissoko, where \n27 the issuance of Plaintiffs’ NTAs occurred before, and were the direct cause of, termination of Plaintiffs’ \nDACA and EADs.  \n28\n    10 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 21 of 33   Page ID #:1790\n \n   \n1 type of creative pleading. See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, 246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir. 2001) \n2 (holding that “a petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove \n3 simply by cloaking [a claim] in constitutional garb”).7  \n4 Applied to the context of this case, a challenge to the decision to terminate DACA \n5 by the issuing an NTA is a necessarily a challenge that arises out of the decision or action \n6 to initiate removal proceedings because the NTA is the document that is used to initiate \n7 removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  Thus, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) necessarily bars \n8 judicial review.  See Vilchiz-Soto, 688 F.3d at 644.     \n9 To the extent that Plaintiffs have any viable claims, the REAL ID Act, codified at 8 \n10 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9), bars them from raising those claims in district \n11 court, regardless of whether a final order of removal has issued. Section 1252(a)(5), \n12 entitled “[e]xclusive means of review,” requires that “a petition for review filed with an \n13 appropriate court of appeals . . . shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review \n14 of an order of removal . . . .” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5). Section 1252(b)(9) provides \n15 “[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application \n16 of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding \nbrought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available \n17\nonly in judicial review of a final order under this section.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) \n18\n(emphasis added); see, e.g., J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1038 (district court lacked jurisdiction \n19\nover challenge to adequacy of removal procedures, and instead court of appeals has \n20\nauthority to resolve questions of constitutional rights on review of a final removal order).  \n21\nImportantly, the Ninth Circuit found that Section 1252(b)(9) is “a clear statutory \n22\nprescription against district court review” of challenges arising from removal proceedings \n23\nfor plaintiffs who had not yet received final orders of removal. See J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at \n24\n25\n                                                 \n26 7 In analogous circumstances, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the applicability of Section \n1252(g)  to  bar  district  court  review  of  the  automatic  termination  of  discretion-based  employment \n27 authorization documents following the commencement of removal proceedings, in accordance with 8 \nC.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii). See Gupta v. Holder, No. 611CV1731ORL35GJK, 2011 WL 13174873, at *1 \n28\n(M.D. Fla. Oct. 31, 2011), aff’d sub nom. Gupta v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 485 F. App’x 386 (11th Cir. 2012).  \n    11 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 22 of 33   Page ID #:1791\n \n   \n1 1035-38 (“The minors . . . attempt to get around [section 1252(b)(9)] by claiming that \n2 they have been (or will be) denied meaningful judicial review in light of their juvenile \n3 status.”) (emphasis added). While the Court acknowledged that “an unrepresented minor \n4 in immigration proceedings poses an extremely difficult situation,” it also found “these \n5 considerations cannot overcome a clear statutory prescription against district court \n6 review. Relief is through review in the court of appeals or executive or congressional \n7 action.” Id. at 1036-1038.8 \n8 Congress’s intent was simple and uncontroversial: if the issue is one that can be \n9 raised in removal proceedings, and ultimately in a petition for review, then the statute \n10 precludes district court review. See id. at 1034 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 173 \n11 (statute was “intended to preclude all district court review of any issue raised in a removal \n12 proceeding”)); cf. Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 9-10 (“Congress plainly intended to put an end to \n13 the scattershot and piecemeal nature of the review process . . . .”). This approach \n14 effectuates the general rule precluding simultaneous review of a question by both an \n15 administrative body and a federal court. See Acura of Bellevue v. Reich, 90 F.3d 1403, \n16 1408-9 (9th Cir. 1996).  \nHere, the sequence of events could not be more clear: Plaintiffs engaged in criminal \n17\nconduct, DHS determined their conduct rendered them enforcement priorities, DHS issued \n18\neach an NTA, the respective NTA caused each Plaintiff’s DACA and EAD to terminate, \n19\nand Plaintiffs filed this challenge. There can be no doubt that DHS’s discretionary \n20\ndecision to issue NTAs was the direct cause of Plaintiffs’ DACA terminations. See Dkt. \n21\n22\n                                                 \n23 8 The Court’s previous reliance on Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2007), to support section \n1252(b)(9) applying only to a final order of removal is misplaced because that language is dicta and \n24 conflicts with the plain language of the statute. Dkt. No. 31 at 7. Singh brought a challenge of ineffective \nassistance of counsel through a habeas petition, and the Court found that the challenge was not tied to \n25\nremoval proceedings, so section 1252(b)(9) did not apply regardless of whether a final order had issued. \n26 Singh, 499 F.3d at 978-79. To interpret Singh as permitting district court challenges such as those raised \nhere runs counter to Congressional intent, and would effectively excise the words “any action taken” from \n27 the statute. See Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 10; cf. Martinez v. Napolitano, 704 F.3d 620, 623 (9th Cir. 2012) (an \nAPA claim “challeng[ing] the procedure and substance of an agency determination that is ‘inextricably \n28\nlinked’ to the order of removal” must be channeled through the petition for review process). \n    12 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 23 of 33   Page ID #:1792\n \n   \n1 53-1 at 4-24. Thus, Plaintiffs’ challenges necessarily arise from “action taken or \n2 proceedings brought to remove an alien,” for which district courts lack jurisdiction.  \n3 ii.  Judicial review of Plaintiffs’ claims is also barred under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2), because how and when an NTA issues is committed to \n4\nagency discretion  \n5\nThere is no judicial review under the APA of decisions that “courts traditionally \n6\nhave regarded as ‘committed to agency discretion.’” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 \n7\n(1993) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)). These decisions are typically unreviewable \n8\nbecause there exists “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \n9\nexercise of discretion.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 830. This bar applies even when “the agency \n10\ngives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action.” ICC v. Bhd. of \n11\nLocomotive Eng’rs, 482 U.S. 270, 283 (1987) (“BLE”). \n12\nThe decisions committed to executive discretion include “an agency’s exercise of \n13\nenforcement power.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. Such judgments involve “a complicated \n14\nbalancing of factors which are peculiarly within [an agency’s] expertise,” including \n15\n“whether agency resources are best spent on this violation or another, whether the agency \n16\nis likely to succeed if it acts, whether the particular enforcement action requested best fits \n17\nthe agency’s overall priorities, and, indeed, whether the agency has enough resources to \n18\nundertake the action at all.” Id. As there is “no meaningful standard against which to \n19\njudge the agency’s exercise of discretion” in weighing these factors, an agency’s exercise \n20\nof enforcement powers is “presumed immune from judicial review under § 701(a)(2).” Id. \n21\nat 830, 832.  \n22\nAn agency’s decision to enforce the law against a particular individual is likewise \n23\npresumptively unreviewable. Just as “the decision whether or not to prosecute” \n24\npresumptively “rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s] discretion,” United States v. Armstrong, \n25\n517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (citation omitted), an agency’s decision to bring a civil \n26\nenforcement action is generally not open to judicial scrutiny. Considerations such as the \n27\nChaney factors are equally present in enforcement decisions as in nonenforcement \n28\n    13 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 24 of 33   Page ID #:1793\n \n   \n1 decisions. See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831; see also Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, \n2 607-8 (1985) (“[T]he decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review”). \n3 One form of that broad discretion is deferred action, a “discretionary and \n4 reversible” decision to notify an alien that DHS has chosen not to seek his removal for a \n5 specific period of time. Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Like other \n6 agency nonenforcement decisions, grants of deferred action rest on a complex balancing \n7 of policy considerations that cannot serve as “meaningful standard against which to judge \n8 the agency’s exercise of discretion.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. The converse is equally \n9 true: denials of deferred action are also committed to agency discretion. See AADC, 525 \n10 U.S. at 485 (treating “‘no deferred action’ decisions” as “discretionary determinations”). \n11 Because “[g]ranting an illegally present alien permission to remain and work in this \n12 country” is fundamentally “a dispensation of mercy,” there are “no standards by which \n13 judges may patrol its exercise.” Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1051 (5th Cir. 1990) \n14 (INS’s decision not to grant pre-hearing voluntary departures and work authorizations to \n15 a group of aliens was non-justiciable).  \n16 Even where an agency has promulgated regulations or provided internal guidance, \ndecisions involving the exercise of prosecutorial discretion are generally not subject to \n17\njudicial review. See Pasquini v. Morris, 700 F.2d 658, 659 (11th Cir. 1983) (holding that \n18\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) Operating Instructions regarding \n19\ndeferred action did not confer substantive rights on an alien and courts could not review a \n20\nclaim that INS failed to comply with these internal instructions). \n21\nThus, individual DACA terminations, especially where based on issuance of NTAs, \n22\nfall squarely within that category of agency discretion for which judicial review is \n23\nimproper. See Chaney, 470 F.3d at 830; see also Morales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822, \n24\n828 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting that “the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a type of \n25\ngovernment action uniquely shielded from and unsuited to judicial intervention”). In \n26\nPlaintiffs’ cases, there is no legal question with regard to the DACA guidelines, because \n27\nthe DACA guidelines merely allow an individual to seek a discretionary administrative \n28\n    14 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 25 of 33   Page ID #:1794\n \n   \n1 grace in the form of DACA. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 38 (“Individuals may be considered for \n2 DACA upon showing that they meet the prescribed guidelines . . .”). DACA is unlike \n3 immigration benefits where eligibility is found in statute or regulation, and which Courts \n4 have found that the non-discretionary denial of such benefits may be reviewed.9  \n5 Here, Plaintiffs are challenging DHS’s exercise of its enforcement power granted \n6 by Congress. See Dkt. 32 Prayer for Relief (seeking to “Enjoin Defendants from revoking \n7 the DACA grants and EADs . . . based on the filing of an NTA charging solely” unlawful \n8 presence). This is a classic challenge to DHS’s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. \n9 See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. This type of enforcement decision involves a balancing of \n10 factors committed to agency discretion by law, including how to allocate agency \n11 resources. See id.; Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464. The question for DHS was not whether it \n12 could exercise its discretion in favor of the Plaintiffs, but rather whether it should do so in \n13 each case. Because this type of discretionary determination is committed to DHS \n14 discretion by law, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Plaintiffs’ claims. \n15 iii.  Plaintiffs cannot state a constitutional claim because the termination \nof DACA does not implicate a constitutional interest. \n16\nPlaintiffs assert incorrectly that “[i]ndividuals who have been granted DACA have \n17\nimportant constitutionally protected interests in their DACA grant and employment \n18\nauthorization.” Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 164. However, Plaintiffs necessarily lack a protected \n19\nconstitutional interest in their DACA and in the process to terminate DACA because the \n20\nultimate result sought – deferred action – is discretionary, and because the Government \n21\nnever expressed a mutual intention to confer a protected benefit in DACA.  \n22\n23\n                                                 \n24 9 The Court’s reliance on United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc) and \nMadu v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 470 F.3d 1362 (11th Cir. 2006) is misplaced. In both cases, courts reviewed \n25\na “purely legal question” that set the stage for a discretionary decision. However, the DACA SOP \n26 identifies threshold criteria for DACA consideration, but it does not mandate granting DACA if those \nthreshold criteria are met. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 38 (“Individuals may be considered for DACA upon \n27 showing that they meet the prescribed guidelines . . .”). Even if the Court finds those criteria enforceable, \nthey are not the subject of the exercises of prosecutorial discretion to issue NTAs, which terminate DACA \n28\nnotwithstanding compliance with the threshold criteria.  \n    15 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 26 of 33   Page ID #:1795\n \n   \n1 The “Due Process Clause does not protect everything that might be described as a \n2 ‘benefit.’” Castle Rock, 545 U.S. at 756. Particular due process rights must be established \n3 on the basis of entitlement to a property or liberty interest, the risks of loss associated \n4 with deprivation of that interest, and the competing interests of the government in not \n5 providing that interest. Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982) (quoting Mathews v. \n6 Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334-335 (1976)). The Court may view DACA recipients’ \n7 circumstance as unfortunate, but neither the Constitution nor Congress provides an \n8 individual in unlawful status a protected interest in living or working in the United States, \n9 or in discretionary relief from removal. Cf. Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, \n10 535 U.S. 137, 151-52 (2002) (holding, as a general matter, an individual who is not \n11 authorized to work in the United States does not have a right to work); see also Garcia v. \n12 Holder, No., 07-60271, 320 F. App’x 288, 290 (9th Cir. April 9, 2009). \n13 Nor can Plaintiffs claim an entitlement in this case that creates a Constitutional \n14 interest. “To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an \n15 abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He \n16 must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Blantz v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr. & \nRehab., 727 F.3d 917, 922 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, \n17\n408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)); see also Mendez-Garcia v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 655, 665 (9th Cir. \n18\n2016) (underscoring that aliens cannot claim a cognizable due process interest in \n19\ndiscretionary immigration relief or benefits). The Supreme Court, however, has held that \n20\neven a practice of “generously” granting a “wholly and expressly discretionary state \n21\nprivilege” does not create a legal entitlement to that benefit. See Regents, 2018 WL \n22\n339144 at *4  (citing Gerhart v. Lake Cnty., Mont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020-21 (9th Cir. \n23\n2011)) (“A person’s belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how \n24\nsincerely or reasonably held, does not create a property right if that belief is not mutually \n25\nheld by the government.”). \n26\nPlaintiffs possess no lawful status, thus no protected interest in living or working in \n27\nthe United States. DACA policy has never purported to alter that, and nor may this Court. \n28\n    16 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 27 of 33   Page ID #:1796\n \n   \n1 Landon, 459 U.S. at 35 (“The role of the judiciary . . . does not extend to imposing \n2 procedures that merely displace congressional choices of policy.”). Because DACA is \n3 discretionary, it does not give rise to a protected right to work in the United States. See \n4 Dkt. No. 16-28 at 2 (“This [DACA grant] does not constitute employment authorization, \n5 nor may it be used in place of an [EAD].”). Nor does DACA confer lawful status. See \n6 Dkt. No. 16-13 (“This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or \n7 pathway to citizenship.”). DACA is not protection from removal. See Dkt. No. 16-23 \n8 (“DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be terminated \n9 at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.”).  \n10 Plaintiffs’ claims regarding an interest in employment authorization and other \n11 public benefits like driver’s licenses are particularly misplaced, because there is no right \n12 to the receipt of either, and no judicial review of the decision to terminate an EAD once \n13 granted. See Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 35; Pilapil v. INS, 424 F.2d 6, 11 (10th Cir. 1970); see also \n14 Perales, 903 F.2d at 1047-48 (“[T]here is nothing in the [INA] expressly providing for \n15 the grant of employment authorization . . . to aliens who are the beneficiaries of approved \n16 petitions”) (vacating the challenged portion of the injunction); Gupta, 2011 WL \n13174873 at *1 (finding a challenge to the termination of EAD upon initiation of removal \n17\nproceedings was an impermissible challenge to the discretionary decision to initiate \n18\nremoval proceedings). In the condtext of Plaintiffs’ claims here that they have a right to \n19\nDACA and therefore EADs, the Ninth Circuit has refused the same proposition. See Neri, \n20\n229 F. App'x at 508 (an individual “has no substantive due process right to discretionary \n21\nrelief from removal or deportation.”); Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. \n22\n2003) (finding no liberty interest in discretionary forms of relief from deportation).  \n23\nIn fact, every individual with employment authorization based on 8 C.F.R. \n24\n§ 274a.12(c), including those with deferred action, is subject to automatic termination of \n25\ntheir EAD upon institution of removal proceedings in an immigration court. See 8 C.F.R. \n26\n§ 274a.14(a)(1)(ii); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.13, 1003.14. No notice or opportunity to respond is \n27\nafforded to any deferred action recipient in this posture, and Plaintiffs point to nothing \n28\n    17 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 28 of 33   Page ID #:1797\n \n   \n1 that supports a contrary finding. Cf. Gupta, 2011 WL 13174873 at *1 (denying challenge \n2 to automatic EAD termination). Because EAD termination is not tied to operation of the \n3 DACA SOP, Plaintiffs’ claims of harm regarding EAD loss must fail. Further, the DACA \n4 SOP instructs USCIS to defer to existing law and regulations where there is any conflict \n5 with the SOP. See Dkt. No. 16-24 at 17, DACA SOP Chapter One (“Any provision of the \n6 [INA] or 8 C.F.R. found . . . to be in conflict with this SOP will take precedence over the \n7 SOP.”). Thus, it would be inappropriate for the Court to find the SOP requires a process \n8 before termination of a DACA-based EAD due to NTA issuance by CBP or ICE, which is \n9 contrary to the plain language of the duly promulgated regulation. \n10 Furthermore, under DHS regulations, an individual with deferred action who has \n11 lost his EAD due to having been placed into removal proceedings may reapply for an \n12 EAD if he or she becomes eligible again under a category of subsection 274a.12(c). Only \n13 if employment authorization is granted again would the individual then be eligible to \n14 apply to their state authority for a driver’s license or Social Security card. ADAC, 757 \n15 F.3d at 1061. Thus, the peripheral benefits Plaintiffs cite to illustrate the urgency of the \n16 relief they seek are two steps removed from the relief this Court can grant.10  \n17 For these reasons, and because Plaintiffs by definition concede removability and \nchallenge only termination of a discretionary temporary grant of deferred action from \n18\nremoval, “the Court cannot conclude that the government has deprived [plaintiffs] of \n19\n[their] liberty interest in remaining in the United States without due process of law.” \n20\nMendez de Leon v. Reno, No. C 97-02482 CW, 1998 WL 289321, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Mar. \n21\n26, 1998).  \n22\n23 B. Plaintiff’s Fail to State a Claim Under the APA.  \nEven if this Court finds that it would have jurisdiction over any of Plaintiffs’ \n24\nclaims, the Court should still dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended complaint because Plaintiffs’ \n25\nfail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiffs cannot establish either an \n26\n27                                                  \n10 None of the provisions that Plaintiffs cite at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)–(3) and 1621(d) depends directly \n28\non the receipt of DACA.

See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831; Regents, 2018 WL 339144 at *18 (“Congress has \n4 been free to constrain DHS’s discretion with respect to granting deferred action, but it has yet to \n5 do so.”). In fact, DHS acted based on that discretion by issuing NTAs based on Plaintiffs’ \n6 criminal activity. Thus, the limited grace a temporary grant of DACA serves to recognize \n7 was overridden by the Government’s determination that Plaintiffs had become \n8 enforcement priorities. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 4-7, 17-18. Defendants respectfully disagree with \n9 the Court’s prior order granting a preliminary injunction to Plaintiff Arreola, see Dkt. No. 31, \n10 and endeavor to address that order here. Id. at 9, 11, 12. \n11 i.  DACA termination by NTA is provided for in the DACA SOP and \npolicy documents, and in DHS policy and regulations.  \n12\nThere is no support in the Napolitano Memo for the proposition that DACA policy \n13\nlimits ICE or CBP’s authority to issue NTAs that will have the effect of terminating \n14\ngrants of deferred action, like DACA. See Dkt. No. 16-13. Contrary to the Court’s \n15\nprevious finding, the Napolitano memo does not limit this authority only for the period \n16\n“as DACA was developed.” Dkt. No. 31 at 12.  \n17\nNor does DHS guidance prevent immigration enforcement agencies from \n18\nterminating DACA by issuing an NTA. The authority to issue an NTA is vested with all \n19\nDHS immigration officers. See 8 C.F.R. § 239.1(a). However, DHS divides NTA issuance \n20\nresponsibility between USCIS in its administrative capacity, and ICE and CBP in their \n21\nlaw enforcement capacities. See 2011 NTA Memo, Dkt. No. 16-25. USCIS is required to \n22\nrefer all cases involving criminal conduct, not limited to Egregious Public Safety \n23\n(“EPS”), to ICE. Id. at 5. USCIS’s decision to issue an NTA on its own under such \n24\ncircumstances must follow ICE’s lead. Id. at 5 & 6 (“USCIS will not issue an NTA in \n25\nthese cases if ICE declines to issue an NTA.”) (emphasis added); id. at 2 (“USCIS must \n26\nensure that its issuance of NTAs fits within and supports the Government’s overall \n27\nremoval priorities . . . .”). When a case is referred by USCIS, ICE may issue an NTA that \n28\n    19 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 30 of 33   Page ID #:1799\n \n   \n1 automatically terminates DACA, with no additional notice or opportunity to respond. See \n2 Dkt. No. 16-24 at 39.  \n3 The effect of NTA issuance on DACA termination is unremarkable, and is \n4 recognized elsewhere in the DACA SOP. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 91-92 (providing that \n5 USCIS will deny, without advance notice and an opportunity to respond, a DACA request \n6 from an individual in immigration detention who ICE intends to release but who ICE \n7 indicates is an enforcement priority). While the SOP instructs USCIS to “discuss” a \n8 disagreement it may have with ICE’s finding, id., there is no provision permitting USCIS \n9 to reverse ICE’s decision. See Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898, 901 (3d Cir. 2016) \n10 (finding no jurisdiction based on Section 1252(g) to review an ICE officer’s unilateral \n11 denial of a DACA request to a detained individual because “that decision involves the \n12 exercise of prosecutorial discretion not to grant a deferred action.”).11 \n13 Indeed, where DHS has worked to ensure that ICE’s determination that someone is \n14 an enforcement priority would not be conflicted by a later discretionary exercise by \n15 USCIS to grant deferred action in the form of DACA, and where the Napolitano Memo \n16 specifically preserves the NTA authority of ICE and CBP upon consideration of the \n17 DACA guidelines, it takes a particularly strained reading of the Napolitano Memo and \nDACA SOP to find that ICE and CBP cannot issue NTAs that have the effect of \n18\nterminating DACA. In fact, the Court’s and Plaintiffs’ interpretation of Defendants’ \n19\nguidance creates an absurd scenario in which ICE would institute new administrative \n20\nremoval proceedings against an individual while that individual seeks additional separate \n21\nlegal process regarding the termination of their DACA. That scenario also strips the \n22\n23\n                                                 \n24 11 The Court’s prior order improperly concludes that the SOP termination chapter requires USCIS to \nadjudicate a termination after ICE has issued an NTA for EPS. Dkt. No. 31 at 9. While the NTA Memo \n25\nstates “ICE’s issuance of an NTA allows USCIS to proceed with adjudication . . . ,” Dkt. No. 16-25 at 5 \n26 (emphasis added), the guidance is optional and the DACA SOP explicitly diverges from it in important \nways. The DACA SOP termination chapter instructs USCIS to follow the NTA Memo, but also states that \n27 ICE’s issuance of an NTA on an EPS referral from USCIS “will result in the termination of DACA.” Dkt. \nNo. 16-24 at 38; see also id. at 34 (“USCIS “will deny the DACA request.”) (emphasis added).  \n28\n    20 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 31 of 33   Page ID #:1800\n \n   \n1 immigration enforcement agencies of their most critical authority. Regents, 2018 WL \n2 339144, at *1 (“One of the key enforcement tools under the INA is removal, i.e., \n3 deportation. In turn, ‘[a] principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion \n4 exercised by immigration officials.’”(citing Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 \n5 (2012))).12 \n6 DHS’s discretion to initiate removal proceedings that have the effect of terminating \n7 DACA is not impeded by DACA policy or immigration law in any way, and so this Court \n8 should dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleging otherwise. \n9 ii.  There is no requirement that an NTA charge more than unlawful \npresence, nor is it arbitrary to rely on the decision to issue an NTA. \n10\nPlaintiffs argue, and this Court agreed, that USCIS impermissibly relies on only \n11\nunlawful presence as the charge listed in an NTA as the sole basis to terminate DACA. \n12\nDkt. No. 31 at 6, 10: Dkt. No. 32 at ¶¶ 159, 165. However, that conclusion relies on a \n13\nstarkly oversimplified consideration of the NTA decision process. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 53-1 \n14\nat 9-15, 20-24 (summaries of the information considered in Plaintiffs’ NTA issuances). \n15\nThere is no basis in the SOP or other DACA-related guidance for the Court to find that an \n16\nNTA charging removability on the basis of presence without admission is not sufficient to \n17\nterminate DACA. Nor can Plaintiffs establish that an individual in receipt of an NTA \n18\nbased on unlawful presence cannot also have been found to be an enforcement priority.  \n19\nFirst, the charges listed in an NTA are not dispositive of the reasons for issuing an \n20\nNTA.13 DHS is under no obligation to charge an individual with anything more than \n21\n22                                                  \n12 The fact that USCIS may grant DACA to nondetained aliens in removal proceedings or with final orders \n23\nof removal does not change this analysis. Just as USCIS has the discretion to grant DACA to those \nrequestors based on the totality of circumstances, nothing in DHS policy or guidance prohibits ICE, CBP, \n24\nor USCIS from similarly exercising discretion to terminate DACA on a case by case basis as an exercise \n25 of agency discretion. \n26 13 This proposition is wholly consistent with the denial portion of the DACA SOP, which provides that, \nwhile to be considered, the charges filed in an NTA are not determinative to the ultimate discretion \n27 decision regarding DACA. Dkt. No. 53-1 at 65 (“Do not rely solely on the grounds listed in the charging \ndocument [. . . ;] review all derogatory information in its totality and then make an informed assessment \n28\nregarding the appropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion for DACA.”).  \n    21 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 32 of 33   Page ID #:1801\n \n   \n1 unlawful presence. Addy v. Sessions, 696 F. App’x 801, 804 (9th Cir. 2017) (rejecting \n2 argument that petitioner should have been charged with removability under a different \n3 statute, because “[t]he Attorney General has prosecutorial discretion over the initiation of \n4 removal proceedings, and that discretion is not reviewable.”). Rather, the decision to \n5 issue an NTA is based on the immigration officer’s experience and information, and – \n6 most importantly – his or her discretion. See Hernandez v. Gonzales, 221 F. App’x 588, \n7 589–90 (9th Cir. 2007) (“Absent evidence to the contrary, we presume that the \n8 immigration officers properly discharged their duties when issuing Hernandez’s NTA.”). \n9 Notably, an NTA also need not include charges used to support the denial of relief from \n10 removal. Salviejo–Fernandez v. Gonzales, 455 F.3d 1063, 1066 (9th Cir. 2006) (denying \n11 due process claim where the BIA found petitioner ineligible for cancellation of removal \n12 based on a conviction not alleged in the NTA). \n13 Here, the discretion exercised in issuing an NTA that has the effect of terminating \n14 DACA is nothing like the arbitrary process this Court cited to in Judulang v. Holder, 565 \n15 U.S. 42 (2011). The Judulang Court rejected the BIA process of interpreting and \n16 comparing the removability charges on an individual’s NTA against a list of charges \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1182 that composed grounds for exclusion of an arriving alien, to \n17\ndetermine whether the individual facing removal was eligible for a form of discretionary \n18\nrelief from removal originally reserved for arriving aliens. 565 U.S. at 489-90. The Court \n19\nequated the process to flipping a coin, such that some violent criminals would be eligible \n20\nfor relief while some lawful permanent residents (“LPR”) with lesser offenses would be \n21\nexcluded. Id. at 487 (finding the process had “no connection to the goals of the \n22\ndeportation process or the rational operation of the immigration laws.”). Here, DACA \n23\ntermination does not hinge on how the NTA is selected, but rather whether it is selected. \n24\nMoreover, the facts here demonstrate that DHS’s decision to issue NTAs that have \n25\nthe result of terminating DACA are not “happenstance,” Dkt. No. 31 at 10; but rather, \n26\nNTA issuance that results in the termination of DACA represents a valid and thoughtful \n27\nexercise of agency discretion. The facts here demonstrate that immigration enforcement \n28\n    22 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 55   Filed 02/05/18   Page 33 of 33   Page ID #:1802\n \n   \n1 officers: (1) were specifically aware of each Plaintiffs’ DACA, see Dkt.

Nor can Plaintiffs show that, in the \ntermination of their DACA grants they were entitled to any additional process either \n10\nthrough statute or the Constitution. For these reasons, the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs \n11\nArreola and Inland Empire and dismiss this entire action for lack of jurisdiction.  \n12\n \n13\nDATED: February 5, 2018  Respectfully Submitted, \n14  \nCHAD A.

Indeed, the government fails even to \n6  contest that the DACA rules explicitly provide that a noncitizen’s placement in \n7  removal proceedings does not preclude a DACA grant.  Instead, the government \n8  improperly offers a post hac rationale—one that the United States Citizenship and \n9  Immigration Services (“USCIS”) did not provide to Mr. Arreola and which there is no \n10  indication that it even considered in deciding to terminate his DACA.  And in arguing \n11  that USCIS’ automatic termination did not also violate its own rules, the government \n12  ignores the plain language of the DACA Standard Operating Procedures.  \n13  Given the government’s clear violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n14  (“APA”), it is no surprise that it asks this Court to avoid the merits on jurisdictional \n15  and other grounds.  In doing so, it repeatedly mischaracterizes Mr. Arreola’s claims as \n16  challenges to removal.  Yet Mr. Arreola does not challenge his placement in removal \n17  proceedings, which are ongoing; instead, he challenges USCIS’s separate decision to \n18  terminate his DACA after removal proceedings were initiated—a claim the \n19  immigration court would have no jurisdiction to consider.  The government also \n20  incorrectly portrays Mr. Arreola’s claims as directed at the agency’s ultimate exercise \n21  of discretion, rather than at the agency’s termination practices, set out in its \n22  nondiscretionary eligibility criteria and procedures, which provide a meaningful \n23  standard for review under the APA.  Unsurprisingly, each federal court to address the \n24  government’s jurisdictional arguments concerning a DACA recipient’s challenge to \n25  termination has rejected them, and this Court should as well. \n26  Mr. Arreola’s request for relief is straightforward: this Court should preserve \n27  the status quo by temporarily enjoining the revocation of Mr. Arreola’s DACA \n28  pending a termination process that complies with the APA and due process. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 9 of 31   Page ID #:649\n1  ARGUMENT \n2  I.  NO STATUTE PRECLUDES JUDICIAL REVIEW. \n3  In determining whether a suit can be brought under the APA, courts must \n4  “begin with the strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of \n5  administrative action.”  Bowen v. Mich. Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, \n6  670 (1986). This presumption requires that “only upon a showing of clear and \n7  convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to \n8  judicial review [of administrative action].”  Id. at 671 (citation and internal quotation \n9  marks omitted).  Here, there is no clear showing of intent to preclude Mr. Arreola’s \n10  challenge to the termination of his DACA, a matter entirely independent of and \n11  collateral to any removal proceedings. \n12  The government contends that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), as well as §§ 1252(b)(9) and \n13  1252(a)(5)—each of which purports to limit jurisdiction over certain challenges \n14  relating to removal proceedings—bar this court from exercising jurisdiction over a \n15  challenge to the termination of DACA. Yet each court to have considered these \n16  contentions has rejected them.  Gonzalez Torres v. DHS, No. 17-cv-1840, 2017 WL \n17  4340385, at *4-5 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017) (“Here, Plaintiff brings a procedural \n18  challenge to termination of his DACA [], an issue independent from any removal \n19  proceedings.”); Colotl v. Kelly, No. 17-cv-1670, 2017 WL 2889681, at *8-10 (N.D. \n20  Ga. June 12, 2017) (“[N]either [§ 1252(g) nor § 1252(b)(9)] divests this Court of \n21  jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff’s challenge to the . . . nondiscretionary process by which \n22  her DACA status was terminated.”).  As these courts correctly concluded, 8 U.S.C. \n23  §§ 1252(a)(5), 1252(b)(9), and 1252(g) do not bar review of claims that the \n24  government invalidly terminated a noncitizen’s DACA.  None of Mr. Arreola’s claims \n25  challenges the validity of any removal order, the adequacy of any removal \n26  proceedings, or the initiation of any such proceedings.  \n27  A. Section 1252(g) Does Not Bar Mr. Arreola’s Claims. \n28  Section 1252(g) does not apply because, despite the government’s repeated \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 10 of 31   Page ID #:650\n1  efforts to mischaracterize the nature of his claims, Mr. Arreola is not challenging any \n2  decision to “commence” or “adjudicate” removal proceedings.  As the Supreme Court \n3  explained in Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, (“AADC”), \n4  “what § 1252(g) says is” quite “narrow[].”  525 U.S. 471, 482 (1999).  Compare Opp. \n5  at 16 (asserting, contrary to AADC, that § 1252(g) “broadly precludes judicial \n6  review”).  “The provision applies only to three discrete actions that the Attorney \n7  General may take: her ‘decision or action’ to ‘commence proceedings, adjudicate \n8  cases, or execute removal orders.’”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 482.  Section 1252(g) does not \n9  preclude review of “many other decisions or actions that may be part of the \n10  deportation process—such as the decisions to open an investigation, to surveil the \n11  suspected violator, to reschedule the deportation hearing, to include various provisions \n12  in the final order that is the product of the adjudication, and to refuse reconsideration \n13  of that order.”  Id. \n14  Consistent with the Supreme Court’s guidance in AADC, the Ninth Circuit has \n15  narrowly construed § 1252(g).  For example, in Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150 (9th \n16  Cir. 2004), the Ninth Circuit made clear that even claims closely related to the \n17  initiation of removal proceedings are not precluded by § 1252(g), so long as the claim \n18  does not directly challenge the decision to commence proceedings itself.  Id. at 1160-\n19  61.  Alcaraz considered whether § 1252(g) precluded jurisdiction over a claim that the \n20  BIA should have administratively closed the noncitizens’ removal proceedings, which \n21  would have allowed the immigration authorities to re-initiate removal proceedings in \n22  which the noncitizens would be eligible to apply for a form of discretionary relief that \n23  would not have otherwise been available to them.  Id. at 1152-53.  This process—of \n24  administrative closure followed by re-initiation of removal proceedings—was known \n25  as “repapering.”  Id. at 1154.  The Ninth Circuit held that “[w]hile the second step in \n26  the repapering process involves a decision to commence (or “reinitiate”) proceedings, \n27  . . . [t]he Alcarazes’ repapering claim only raises the issue of administrative closure.  \n28  Therefore, we are not barred from hearing this claim by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).”  Id. at \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 11 of 31   Page ID #:651\n1  1161.    \n2  Here, although one of Mr. Arreola’s claims challenges USCIS’ categorical \n3  revocation of his DACA after his NTA was issued, Mr. Arreola’s claim does not \n4  challenge CBP’s issuance of the NTA itself or its decision to place him in removal \n5  proceedings.  Rather, he challenges USCIS’ separate and independent decision to \n6  revoke his DACA on that basis.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *4-5 \n7  (holding that § 1252(g) did not preclude jurisdiction over noncitizen’s challenge to \n8  DACA termination based on an NTA, and explaining that the plaintiff’s challenge was \n9  “independent from any removal proceedings”).  As in Alcaraz and Gonzalez Torres, \n10  § 1252(g) does not preclude jurisdiction here because Mr. Arreola’s specific claim \n11  does not challenge the commencement of removal proceedings itself.  See, e.g., \n12  Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc. v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 1139, 1150 (9th Cir. 2000) (explaining \n13  that § 1252(g) “applies only to the three specific discretionary actions mentioned in its \n14  text, not to all claims relating in any way to deportation proceedings”).  Notably, \n15  success on the claims in this case would not affect the immigration judge’s continued \n16  jurisdiction over Mr. Arreola’s removal proceedings. \n17  Mr. Arreola’s claim is not barred by § 1252(g) for the additional reason that he \n18  does not challenge the agency’s ultimate exercise of discretion, but rather asserts legal \n19  claims: he challenges Defendants’ failures to comply with their own rules, to provide \n20  him with the process due, and to comply with the mandates of the APA.  In construing \n21  § 1252(g), the Ninth Circuit has also held that while it precludes jurisdiction to review \n22  challenges to the three specified discretionary decisions, it does not bar review of \n23  legal questions, even if related to those discretionary decisions.  In United States v. \n24  Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc), the Court explained that \n25  under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), “[t]he district court may consider a purely legal question \n26  that does not challenge the Attorney General’s discretionary authority, even if the \n27  answer to that legal question—a description of the relevant law—forms the backdrop \n28  against which the Attorney General later will exercise discretionary authority.”  \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 12 of 31   Page ID #:652\n1  Accord, e.g., Madu v. Attorney General, 470 F.3d 1362, 1368 (11th Cir. 2006) \n2  (explaining that § 1252(g) “does not proscribe substantive review of the underlying \n3  legal bases for those discretionary decisions and actions”).  The Ninth Circuit’s en \n4  banc decision in Hovsepian is controlling here.1  Thus, although AADC indicated that \n5  § 1252(g) was “designed to give some measure of protection to ‘no deferred action’ \n6  decisions and similar discretionary determinations,” 525 U.S. at 485 (emphasis \n7  added), Mr. Arreola’s case does not challenge any discretionary decision not to defer \n8  action.  See also Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 755-56 (5th Cir. 2015) (holding \n9  that § 1252(g) was inapplicable to states’ APA challenge to 2014 deferred action \n10  program).  Indeed, rather than exercise its discretion in determining whether the \n11  totality of circumstances warranted revocation, the government categorically \n12  terminated Mr. Arreola’s DACA and work permit.2 \n13  Finally, the government incorrectly represents that the Ninth Circuit has “held \n14  there is no subject matter jurisdiction to review a decision to grant DACA” pursuant to \n15  § 1252(g).  Opp. at 15.  However, neither case cited by the government so holds.  In \n16  Vilchiz-Soto v. Holder, 688 F.3d 642 (9th Cir. 2012), the noncitizen sought review not \n17  of any decision to grant or deny DACA, but of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ \n18  (“BIA”) decision not to reopen removal proceedings, which the noncitizen believed \n19  would have allowed him to apply for DACA.  Id. at 643-44.  The BIA, however, has \n20  no jurisdiction to grant or deny DACA.  See Matter of Quintero, 18 I. & N. Dec. 348, \n21  350 (BIA 1982).  The government also cites dicta in an unpublished case, Cruz \n22                                             \n1   Notably, the government overlooks the Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision in \n23 \nHovsepian and instead cites an Eighth Circuit case, incorrectly representing that “8 \n24  U.S.C. § 1252(g) does not distinguish between discretionary and nondiscretionary \nduties.”  Opp. at 17.  As discussed, however, the Ninth Circuit has rejected the \n25 \nargument advanced by the government. \n26  2   Cf. Gomez-Lopez v. Ashcroft, 393 F.3d 882, 884 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that \ndenial of discretionary relief based on a conclusion that noncitizen was in a “per se \n27 \nexclusion categor[y]” for that form of relief was “not a discretionary decision and \n28  therefore [did] not strip this court of jurisdiction” under § 1252(a)(2)(B)). \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 13 of 31   Page ID #:653\n1  Rodriguez v. Sessions, 677 Fed. App’x 447 (9th Cir. 2017), but that case is likewise \n2  inapposite because the noncitizen challenged the BIA’s denial of a motion to remand, \n3  and the Court therefore had no occasion to consider whether it would have jurisdiction \n4  to review a challenge to a denial of DACA on legal grounds.3  In both cases cited by \n5  the government, the noncitizen had not even applied for DACA, let alone sought \n6  review of any denial.4  \n7  B. Sections 1252(b)(9) and 1252(a)(5) Do Not Bar Mr. Arreola’s Claims. \n8    As the Supreme Court has explained, the purpose of § 1252(b)(9) is “to \n9  consolidate ‘judicial review’ of immigration proceedings into one action in the court \n10  of appeals, but it applies only ‘[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal under \n11  subsection [1252] (a)(1).’” INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 313 (2001). Critically, St. Cyr \n12  held that § 1252(b)(9) does not apply to matters that are “not subject to judicial review \n13  under § 1252(a)(1)”—which governs judicial review of removal orders.  Id.  The same \n14  is true of § 1252(a)(5), which expressly concerns “judicial review of an order of \n15  removal.” See Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir. 2007) (“By virtue of \n16  their explicit language, both §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) apply only to those claims \n17  seeking judicial review of orders of removal.”). Thus, §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) \n18  work to ensure that issues that can be adjudicated in a deportation proceeding are \n19  resolved there, rather than in piecemeal, separate litigation. \n20  Here, these provisions are inapplicable because Mr. Arreola does not seek \n21 \n                                           \n22  3   The government also cites Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1024-25 \n(9th Cir. 1985), but that case did not involve section 1252(g); in fact, the statute did \n23 \nnot yet exist at the time. In any event, the court explained that Nicholas v. INS, 590 \n24  F.2d 802 (9th Cir.1979), which found that courts had jurisdiction to review the 1978 \ndeferred action Operations Instruction, remained good law in the Ninth Circuit. \n25 \n4   The government’s citation to Sissoko v. Rocha, 509 F.3d 947 (9th Cir. 2007), is \n26  likewise unavailing.  That case involved a “direct[] challenge[]” to the government’s \n“decision to commence expedited removal proceedings.”  Id. at 950.   In contrast, \n27 \nhere, Mr. Arreola does not challenge the validity of his placement in removal \n28  proceedings whatsoever. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 14 of 31   Page ID #:654\n1  judicial review of an order of removal.  To the contrary, his challenge is collateral to, \n2  and independent of, any removal proceedings.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL \n3  4340385, at *4-5.  Indeed, the government takes the position that “[d]eferred action \n4  does not . . . provide any defense to removal,” and “[a]n individual with deferred \n5  action remains removable at any time.”  Opp. at 3.  A noncitizen who is in removal \n6  proceedings can apply for DACA separately and simultaneously.5  Critically, an IJ has \n7  no power to grant or deny deferred action, or to review or reverse the immigration \n8  agency’s decision to revoke deferred action.  Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at \n9  *11 (“[A]n immigration judge has no jurisdiction to reinstate DACA status, or \n10  authorize an application for renewal of DACA status, as acknowledged by Defendants \n11  at oral argument.”); see also Napolitano Memo at 2-3; Matter of Quintero, 18 I. & N. \n12  Dec. at 350 (explaining that “neither the immigration judge nor the Board may grant \n13  [deferred action] status or review a decision of the District Director to deny it”).   \n14  In particular, § 1252(b)(9) does not preclude Mr. Arreola’s claim because that \n15  section does not deprive district courts of jurisdiction where the claim could not have \n16  been litigated in removal proceedings and the noncitizen would otherwise “have had \n17  no legal avenue to obtain judicial review of this claim.”  JEFM v. Lynch, 837 F.3d \n18  1026, 1032 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing Singh, 499 F.3d at 979-80); see also Aguilar v. ICE, \n19  510 F.3d 1, 11-12 (1st Cir. 2007) (explaining that § 1252(b)(9) does not preclude \n20  “claims that cannot effectively be handled through the available administrative \n21  process”).  The government concedes this point, but ignores that the immigration court \n22  simply has no jurisdiction to review the termination or denial of DACA.  See Opp. at \n23  19 (“Congress’s intent was simple: if the issue is one that can be raised in removal \n24  proceedings, and ultimately in a petition for review, then the statute precludes district \n25  court review”) (citing JEFM, 837 F.3d at 1034). \n26                                             \n5   Doc. No. 16-4, Kwon Decl. ¶ 10, Ex. 9 at 2 (Janet Napolitano, Memorandum on \n27 \nExercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the \n28  United States as Children (“Napolitano Memo”) (June 15, 2012)). \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 15 of 31   Page ID #:655\n1  The government also overlooks that in applying the jurisdictional provisions of \n2  § 1252, the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that APA challenges to the Department \n3  of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) denials of affirmative benefits that are collateral to a \n4  noncitizen’s removal proceedings may be brought in district court.  For example, in \n5  Mamigonian v. Biggs, 710 F.3d 936, 945-46 (9th Cir. 2013), the Ninth Circuit \n6  considered whether a noncitizen could seek district court review of USCIS’ denial of \n7  an adjustment of status application, when the noncitizen had also been in removal \n8  proceedings.  Because review in the context of removal proceedings “would be \n9  unavailable to Ms. Mamigonian,” she could bring an affirmative claim in district court \n10  notwithstanding the § 1252 jurisdictional bars.  Id. at 945; see also, e.g., Ching v. \n11  Mayorkas, 725 F.3d 1149, 1154-59 (9th Cir. 2013) (reversing district court’s denial of \n12  procedural due process challenge to the denial of an I-130 petition for immediate \n13  relative status filed by a husband for his wife, even though the wife’s “removal \n14  proceedings are currently pending”).    \n15  The government unsuccessfully attempts to draw support for its § 1252(b)(9) \n16  argument from JEFM, but that case supports Mr. Arreola’s position.6  As noted, \n17  JEFM makes clear that where, as here, the immigration court would have no \n18  jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim, § 1252(b)(9) does not bar district court \n19  jurisdiction.  JEFM, 837 F.3d at 1032.  In JEFM, the Court reasoned that the \n20  plaintiffs’ claim—that children in removal proceedings have a right to counsel—was \n21  not independent of removal proceedings, emphasizing that “[r]ight-to-counsel claims \n22  are routinely raised in petitions for review filed with a federal court of appeals.”  Id. at \n23  1033.7  Here, in contrast, there is no question that a challenge to the revocation of \n24                                             \n6   Counsel submit that JEFM’s conclusion—that the right to counsel claims at \n25 \nissue there could not be brought in district court—was incorrect, and note that there is \n26  a pending petition for rehearing en banc.  See JEFM v. Sessions, No. 15-35738, Doc. \nNo. 106 at 12-23 (9th Cir. Dec. 5, 2016). \n27 \n7   Similarly, in Martinez v. Napolitano, 704 F.3d 620, 623 (9th Cir. 2012), the \n28  petitioner raised asylum and other claims that could be raised in removal proceedings.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 16 of 31   Page ID #:656\n1  deferred action cannot be brought in immigration court, because the immigration \n2  judge has no power to consider it.  Matter of Quintero, 18 I. & N. Dec. at 350. \n3 \nC. The Termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA Is Reviewable Under the     \n     APA. \n4 \nThe DACA eligibility criteria and Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) \n5 \nprovide law to apply, and the government’s contention that that determination is \n6 \n“committed to agency discretion by law,” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), is therefore incorrect.  \n7 \nThat bar applies only where there is “no meaningful standard against which to judge \n8 \nthe agency’s exercise of discretion.” Mendez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, 340 F.3d 865, 868 \n9 \n(9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985)).  As the Ninth \n10 \nCircuit has held, there is law to apply whenever “statutes, regulations, established \n11 \nagency policies, or judicial decisions . . . provide a meaningful standard against which \n12 \nto assess” the agency action.  Id.; accord ASSE Intern., Inc. v. Kerry, 803 F.3d 1059, \n13 \n1069 (9th Cir. 2015) (“Even where statutory language grants an agency ‘unfettered \n14 \ndiscretion,’ its decision may nonetheless be reviewed if regulations or agency practice \n15 \nprovide a ‘meaningful standard by which this court may review its exercise of \n16 \ndiscretion.’”) (quoting Spencer Enters., Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, 688 (9th \n17 \nCir. 2003)). \n18 \nThe Ninth Circuit has expressly found that informal memoranda may provide \n19 \nsuch a standard.  For example, in Alcaraz, the Ninth Circuit held that, although the \n20 \nrelevant statutory provision committed the repapering policy at issue to the Attorney \n21 \nGeneral, the agency’s memoranda on the topic were sufficient to provide jurisdiction \n22 \nunder the APA.  384 F.3d at 1161; see also Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v. U.S., 648 F.3d \n23 \n708, 719 (9th Cir. 2011) (looking to agency’s interim certification standards for law to \n24 \napply); Mendez-Gutierrez, 340 F.3d at 868-69 (finding that agency’s application of \n25 \nreinstatement rules provided law to apply); Steenholdt v. FAA, 314 F.3d 633, 638 \n26 \n(D.C. Cir. 2003) (“[J]udicially manageable standards by which to judge the agency’s \n27 \naction . . . may be found in formal and informal policy statements and regulations as \n28 \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 17 of 31   Page ID #:657\n1  well as in statutes.”) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, the \n2  Napolitano Memorandum and DACA SOPs govern the DACA eligibility \n3  determination and in particular, whether Mr. Arreola continues to be eligible for \n4  DACA despite the issuance of his NTA.8  These documents, like the repapering \n5  memoranda in Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1161, set out detailed policy directives that \n6  provide the standards against which this Court can judge the government’s revocation \n7  of Mr. Arreola’s DACA.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5 \n8  (“Defendants’ failure to follow the termination procedures set forth in the DACA SOP \n9  is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.”) (citing U.S. ex rel. Accardi v. \n10  Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954), and Alcarez); Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at \n11  *10  (“Defendants’ argument that § 701(a) of the APA bars this Court from reviewing \n12  an agency’s non-discretionary review process fails.”).  The government’s suggestion \n13  that such directives are unenforceable under U.S. ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 \n14  U.S. 260, 268 (1954), Opp. at 14, relies on a patent misreading of a single case.  In \n15  Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1010-11 (9th Cir. 1987), the plaintiff did \n16  not attempt to enforce the guidelines at issue.  Instead, the case concerned whether \n17  those guidelines were applicable at all, and improperly promulgated without notice \n18  and comment procedures.  The opinion therefore did not mention Accardi at all, and \n19  indeed the court also explained that it was not faced with the question of whether it \n20  lacked jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. 701(a)(2).  See Mada-Luna, 813 F.2d at 1015. \n                                           \n21 \n8   Although the DACA memorandum has been withdrawn, the agency continues \n22  to adjudicate DACA applications according to the standards set out in the \nmemorandum and its SOPs.  See Kwon Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. 15 at 15 (Press Briefing by \n23 \nPress Secretary Sarah Sanders and Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert, \n24  9/8/2017, #11, The White House, Office of the Press Secretary (explaining that \n“[d]uring this six-month time, there are no changes that are being made to the program \n25 \nat this point”); see also id. ¶ 17, Ex. 16 (Testimony of Michael Dougherty, Assistant \n26  Secretary of DHS, Committee of the Judiciary, Oversight of the Administration’s \nDecision to End Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Oct. 3, 2017), \n27 \nhttps://www.c-span.org/video/?435059-1/trump-administration-officials-testify-\n28  decision-rescind-daca (relevant testimony at 56:46)). \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 18 of 31   Page ID #:658\n1  The proposition from Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831-32, that an agency’s \n2  nonenforcement decisions are presumptively committed to agency discretion, is \n3  consistent with these principles: Mr. Arreola challenges USCIS’ determination that his \n4  DACA should be automatically terminated based on CBP’s issuance of an NTA, not \n5  any eventual enforcement decision in removal proceedings.9  Indeed, in Heckler, the \n6  Court noted that even enforcement decisions are reviewable where they are governed \n7  by “clearly defined factors” like the DACA eligibility criteria.  470 U.S. at 834 \n8  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  And the Fifth Circuit expressly found \n9  that the DACA memorandum created nondiscretionary eligibility standards.  See \n10  Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 170 (5th Cir. 2015), as revised (Nov. 25, \n11  2015), cert. granted, 136 S. Ct. 906, 193 L. Ed. 2d 788 (2016).  \n12  In sum, the government fails to address the simple reason why the decision to \n13  terminate Mr. Arreola’s DACA on the basis of the issuance of his NTA is reviewable \n14  under the APA: the eligibility criteria and the SOPs provide the “meaningful standard \n15  against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion” required by Heckler, 470 \n16  U.S. at 830. \n17  II.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT CONTEST THAT USCIS’ \nTERMINATION DECISION WAS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS \n18 \nUNDER THE APA. \n19   \nA. This Court Must Evaluate the Government’s Actions Based on Its \n20 \nContemporaneous Rationale. \n21 \n  The government does not dispute that USCIS terminated Mr. Arreola’s DACA \n22 \nautomatically based on CBP’s issuance of an NTA, and thereby failed to exercise its \n23 \nown discretion.  Nor does the government contend that it ever provided an \n24 \n                                           \n9   Morales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822, 828-29 (9th Cir. 2016), the only Ninth \n25 \nCircuit case on which the government relies for the proposition that exercises of \n26 \nprosecutorial discretion are unreviewable, concerned a challenge to an agency’s final \ndiscretionary determination. Here, by contrast, Mr. Arreola challenges USCIS’ failure \n27 \nto follow its own rules before reaching a discretionary determination. \n28   \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 19 of 31   Page ID #:659\n1  explanation, based on relevant factors, for its abrupt reversal.  Instead, the government \n2  introduces new documents related to Mr. Arreola’s arrest—documents that the \n3  government never suggests that USCIS possessed, let alone relied on, in terminating \n4  Mr. Arreola’s DACA.  The government’s contention that this Court should consider \n5  that evidence violates two fundamental principles of administrative law.  \n6    First, it is black letter law that courts review agency action according to the \n7  contemporaneous reasons given by the agency, and disregard any alternative \n8  rationales presented during litigation.  See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. \n9  Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 419 (1971), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, \n10  430 U.S. 99 (1977); see also SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87-88 (1943). As the \n11  Ninth Circuit has explained, “[t]he rule barring consideration of post hoc agency \n12  rationalizations operates where an agency has provided a particular justification for a \n13  determination at the time the determination is made, but provides a different \n14  justification for that same determination when it is later reviewed by another body.”  \n15  Indep. Min. Co. v. Babbitt, 105 F.3d 502, 511 (9th Cir. 1997); accord Toor v. Lynch, \n16  789 F.3d 1055, 1064 (9th Cir. 2015) (agency action may only be affirmed based on \n17  the contemporaneous “explanations offered by the agency”) (internal quotation marks \n18  omitted) (quoting Arrington v. Daniels, 516 F.3d 1106, 1112–13 (9th Cir. 2008)); \n19  Shirrod v. Director, 809 F.3d 1082, 1087 n.4 (9th Cir. 2015) (court must “review only \n20  what the [agency] did, not what [it] could have done”).  \n21    Here, USCIS made clear in its notice to Mr. Arreola, and Defendants do not \n22  contest, Opp. at 25, that USCIS terminated Mr. Arreola’s DACA automatically due to \n23  CBP’s issuance of an NTA based on his presence without admission.  The newly \n24  submitted evidence is irrelevant to USCIS’ automatic termination decision, which is \n25  the only rationale USCIS provided and the only rationale that is at issue in this case.  \n26    Second, and relatedly, courts may only review agency actions on the basis of \n27  the administrative record.  “If [a] finding is not sustainable on the administrative \n28  record made, then the [agency’s] decision must be vacated and the matter remanded to \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 20 of 31   Page ID #:660\n1  [it] for further consideration.”  Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 143 (1973).  This Court \n2  should decline to consider outside evidence that is not part of the record of USCIS’ \n3  termination decision; indeed, there is no evidence that USCIS itself considered it. Ctr. \n4  for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 450 F.3d 930, 943 (9th Cir. \n5  2006) (affirming the district court’s decision to strike additional exhibits that were not \n6  part of the administrative record and noting that “the focal point for judicial review \n7  should be the administrative record already in existence, not some new record made \n8  initially in the reviewing court”) (quoting Camp, 411 U.S. at 142).10 \n9  In sum, on this motion, the Court must evaluate USCIS’ action according to the \n10  contemporaneous rationale it provided and based on the record that was actually \n11  before it.  \n12 \nB. USCIS’ Automatic Termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA Based on \nthe Issuance of an NTA Was Arbitrary and Capricious in Violation \n13 \nof the APA.  \n14 \nDefendants wholly fail to respond to—and therefore do not contest—Mr. \n15 \nArreola’s claim that USCIS’ actual rationale for terminating his DACA grant—the \n16 \n                                           \n10   Notably, the government’s allegations underscore the value of providing a fair \n17 \npre-termination procedure with notice of the reasons for the decision and a fair \n18 \nopportunity to respond. Had Mr. Arreola been provided an opportunity to respond, he \nwould have vigorously contested that he committed any crime.  In fact, the \n19 \ngovernment’s extra-record evidence shows that Mr. Arreola emphatically denied \n20 \nsmuggling when asked.  Doc No. 23-2 at 54.  Yet CBP represented in the I-213 form \nthat Mr. Arreola “stated that he was smuggling illegal aliens for financial gain.”  \n21 \nKwon Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. 7. An Immigration Judge nonetheless found Mr. Arreola credible \n22 \nthat he was not engaged in smuggling, and concluded that the I-213 allegations were \nmistaken. The government now heavily relies on Mr. Arreola’s purported \n23 \nacknowledgment that he knew the passengers he was to pick up were undocumented, \n24 \nOpp. at 28, but Mr. Arreola never suggested in the interview that he knew of his \nprospective passengers’ immigration statuses before he was arrested by CBP agents.  \n25 \nIn any event, the government apparently decided that there was no basis to charge Mr. \n26 \nArreola with any crime. Cf. United States v. Barajas-Montiel, 185 F.3d 947, 953-54 \n(9th Cir. 1999) (holding that to establish a violation, specific intent to violate the \n27 \nsmuggling laws must be established).  \n28   \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 21 of 31   Page ID #:661\n1  mere issuance of an NTA charging him with being present without admission—was \n2  arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  Nor do Defendants contest that the \n3  Napolitano Memo and SOPs expressly provide that a noncitizen’s placement in \n4  removal proceedings does not preclude a DACA grant. \n5  USICS’ termination decision (1) represents a complete reversal of its prior \n6  considered position that Mr. Arreola was eligible for and warranted DACA without \n7  providing “a reasoned analysis for the change,” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State \n8  Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983); and (2) does not reflect reasoned \n9  decisionmaking, see Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 55 (2011) (holding that \n10  “agency action must be based on non-arbitrary, ‘relevant factors’”).  USCIS’ decision \n11  is arbitrary and capricious under the APA for both of these reasons.  5 U.S.C. \n12  § 706(2).   \n13  First, although an agency may depart from its prior decision, if it does so, it “is \n14  obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 42; \n15  see also FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (“[T]he \n16  agency must show that there are good reasons for the new policy.”).  USCIS’ one-\n17  sentence explanation that it terminated Mr. Arreola’s DACA automatically fails to \n18  acknowledge that Mr. Arreola remains eligible for DACA under the applicable \n19  criteria, much less provide “good reasons” for the agency’s change in position, as \n20  required by the APA.  Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 515; see also, e.g., \n21  Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 968 (9th Cir. 2015) \n22  (explaining that the agency is “required to provide a ‘reasoned explanation . . . for \n23  disregarding’ the ‘facts and circumstances’ that underlay its previous decision”) \n24  (citations omitted).  Indeed, all DACA recipients lack lawful immigration status and, \n25  like Mr. Arreola, are removable on that basis.  USCIS’ reliance on an NTA citing Mr. \n26  Arreola’s presence without admission therefore fails to explain, much less justify, its \n27  decision to reverse course and terminate his DACA.  See Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n28  556 U.S. at 515 (explaining that an agency must give a “more detailed justification” \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 22 of 31   Page ID #:662\n1  for a policy change if its “prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that \n2  must be taken into account”).  \n3  Second, as explained in Mr. Arreola’s opening brief, USCIS failed to act “in a \n4  reasoned manner” in violation of the APA.  See PI Mot. at 11-14.  An individual’s \n5  presence without admission is wholly irrelevant to whether that individual is eligible \n6  for DACA, and so the issuance of an NTA charging presence without admission does \n7  not provide a reasoned basis for terminating DACA.  This conclusion is supported by \n8  the DACA SOPs, which make clear that a noncitizen in removal proceedings is \n9  eligible for and may be granted DACA like any other applicant.  Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. \n10  20 (“DACA SOPs”) at 71, 74-75.  Despite Mr. Arreola’s continued eligibility for the \n11  program, however, USCIS failed to consider the relevant facts and circumstances and \n12  exercise its individualized discretion in accordance with its rules.  Those make clear \n13  that if someone is the subject of an NTA, USCIS should consider all of the relevant \n14  circumstances, including the ground for removal charged in the NTA, to determine \n15  whether DACA is appropriate or whether the individual is disqualified.  Id. at 74-75.  \n16  The DACA rules also make clear that when the ground in the NTA does not adversely \n17  impact a DACA grant—for example, merely lacking immigration status—the \n18  individual is not disqualified from DACA.  \n19 \nC. USCIS’ Automatic Revocation Also Violates Its Own Procedures and \nThus the APA. \n20 \nUSCIS’ decision contravenes the APA for an additional reason: it violates the \n21 \nDACA procedures, which the agency is required to follow.  See PI Mot. at 17.  \n22 \nIndeed, notwithstanding the government’s passing suggestion that a DACA grant can \n23 \nbe terminated at any time, without notice (Opp. at 24), ultimately the government \n24 \nconcedes that the SOPs are binding on USCIS when adjudicating DACA cases, as \n25 \nmultiple courts have found.  See Opp. at 25 (“[T]he DACA SOP was written by \n26 \nUSCIS for USCIS agents and officers.”); Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *4 (“The SOP \n27 \nstates that . . . the procedures to be followed are not discretionary.”); Gonzalez Torres, \n28 \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 23 of 31   Page ID #:663\n1  2017 WL 4340385, at *3 (“The DACA SOP issued by DHS sets forth the procedures \n2  for adjudicating DACA applications, renewals, and the termination of participation in \n3  DACA.”); see also, e.g., Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 549 (an “agency \n4  must follow its own rules”).  The DACA SOPs provide that, in most circumstances, \n5  including those that involve disqualifying criminal convictions, USCIS can only \n6  terminate DACA after the agency provides a Notice of Intent to Terminate that \n7  explains the adverse grounds and gives the recipient 33 days to respond with \n8  arguments and evidence.  DACA SOPs at 136-37; see also PI Mot. at 17. \n9  Defendants’ assertion that “where CBP or ICE issues a Notice to Appear, the \n10  DACA SOP provides that DACA and the EAD terminate automatically,” Opp. at 25, \n11  finds no support in the SOPs.  Instead, the SOPs make clear that there is only one \n12  narrow circumstance in which USCIS may do so, which requires undertaking a \n13  specific procedure that Defendants concede did not occur in Mr. Arreola’s case.  \n14  Under Chapter 14 of the SOPs, if USCIS determines that a disqualifying offense or \n15  public safety concern is deemed to be “Egregious Public Safety” or “EPS” under the \n16  agency’s 2011 NTA Memorandum, the officer should forward the case to a special \n17  unit within USCIS, which will then refer the case to ICE and follow the handling \n18  procedures outlined in the memo.  DACA SOPs at 137.  If after referral from USCIS, \n19  ICE decides to issue an NTA, the SOPs provide that the NTA’s issuance terminates \n20  DACA.  Id.  Defendants have not cited a single authority that provides that USCIS \n21  may terminate DACA automatically any time CBP or ICE issues an NTA based solely \n22  on presence without admission.  See Opp. at 24-27.  Indeed, if it were the case that all \n23  DACA grants automatically terminate with the issuance of an NTA, then it would be \n24  unnecessary for the SOPs to enumerate detailed procedures for termination when an \n25  NTA is issued in certain EPS cases.11 \n26                                             \n11   The government also asserts that a federal regulation provides for termination \n27 \nof a DACA EAD when an NTA is filed with the immigration court.  Opp. at 25 n.16 \n28  (citing 8 C.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii)).  Although the cited regulation provides for \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 24 of 31   Page ID #:664\n1  Here, nothing in the record indicates that USCIS determined that Mr. Arreola \n2  presented an EPS concern or referred his case to ICE, or that ICE ever reviewed his \n3  case or issued an NTA based on a determination that it was an EPS case; nor does the \n4  government even attempt to suggest that USCIS followed the procedures for EPS \n5  cases.  On the contrary, CBP (not ICE) issued Mr. Arreola’s NTA based solely on \n6  presence without admission and without reference to any criminal grounds for \n7  removal.  Under those circumstances, the DACA SOPs require that USCIS provide \n8  Mr. Arreola notice and an opportunity to respond before terminating his DACA.  \n9  DACA SOPs 136-37.  \n10  Indeed, the court in Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5-6, rejected the \n11  same argument that the government makes here. The court explained that, except in \n12  certain EPS cases, the SOPs require the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate \n13  before termination, and that an NTA charging presence without admission does not \n14  constitute an EPS case under the SOPs.  Id. at *5.  The court also noted that the \n15  government in that case—as in this one—“indefensibl[y]” conflated the CBP issuance \n16  of an NTA with ICE’s issuance of an NTA after a USCIS referral of an EPS case.  Id. \n17  at *6.  Defendants have no response to these points. \n18    Defendants mischaracterize the Napolitano Memorandum, attempting to \n19  suggest that it authorizes CBP and ICE officers to terminate DACA grants \n20  unilaterally.  See Opp. at 4, 25-26.  Indeed, were that the case, then the SOPs’ careful \n21  and detailed procedures governing DACA terminations would be negated.  To the \n22  contrary, the Napolitano Memo expressly vested in USCIS the responsibility for \n23  making DACA determinations.  See Napolitano Memo at 2-3 (directing USCIS to \n24                                                                                                                                               \ntermination in some cases, it also contains a specific exception stating that “this shall \n25 \nnot preclude the authorization of employment pursuant to § 274a.12(c) of this part \n26  where appropriate.”  8 C.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii) (emphasis added).  See Alfaro-\nOrellana v. Ilchert, 720 F.Supp. 792, 794 (N.D. Cal. 1989) (recognizing that 8 C.F.R. \n27 \n§ 274a.14(a)(1)(ii) “creates an exception for appropriate work authorizations under \n28  § 274a.12(c))”).  \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 25 of 31   Page ID #:665\n1  immediately begin establishing a process to adjudicate DACA applications).  While \n2  USCIS developed and implemented the DACA application process, DHS directed ICE \n3  to identify and assess for deferred action DACA-eligible individuals already in \n4  removal proceedings to prevent them from losing the opportunity to apply.  Id. at 2.  \n5  Further, DHS sought to ensure that DACA-eligible individuals who encountered DHS \n6  officers while the DACA application process was implemented were assessed for \n7  deferred action to prevent these “low priority individuals from being placed into \n8  removal proceedings or removed from the United States.”  Id.  Nothing in the \n9  Napolitano Memo supports the notion that, once USCIS implemented the DACA \n10  adjudication process and made a considered judgment to grant an individual DACA, \n11  the decision could be unilaterally undone by any ICE or CBP officer.  Neither does the \n12  Memo suggest that USCIS must treat another agency’s issuance of an NTA charging \n13  presence without admission as determinative of its decision whether to terminate \n14  DACA.   \n15    Defendants’ contention that USCIS has engaged in a consistent practice of \n16  terminating DACA automatically based on the issuance of an NTA, and is therefore \n17  entitled to deference, is not supported by the case law or the record.  Defendants have \n18  provided only 14 examples of cases in which USCIS has cancelled DACA on the \n19  basis of an NTA, when USCIS has granted DACA to more than 800,000 applicants \n20  since 2012 and approximately 1,500 grants have been terminated.  See Declaration of \n21  Katrina L. Eiland (“Eiland Decl.”) ¶ 3, Ex. 1.  In any event, Defendants concede that \n22  the interpretation they advance is entitled to, at most, Skidmore deference, which is \n23  due “respect only insofar as [it] ha[s] the ‘power to persuade,’ which is a function of \n24  ‘the thoroughness evident in [its] consideration’ and ‘the validity of [its] reasoning.’”  \n25  Resident Councils of Washington v. Leavitt, 500 F.3d 1025, 1037 (9th Cir. 2007).  \n26  Here, Defendants’ interpretation not only conflicts with the plain language of the \n27  SOPs, but as explained above, such a policy would be arbitrary and capricious—\n28  indeed, it would mean that any individual enforcement officer could reverse USCIS’ \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 26 of 31   Page ID #:666\n1  considered judgement with the stroke of a pen, notwithstanding the fact that the \n2  individual continues to be eligible for DACA and that all DACA recipients, by \n3  definition, lack lawful immigration status.   \n \n4 \nIII.  THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES NO RESPONSE TO MR. \n5  ARREOLA’S DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT THAT, ALTHOUGH DACA \nIS DISCRETIONARY, ONCE GRANTED HE IS ENTITLED TO A FAIR \n6 \nPROCESS FOR REVOCATION. \n7 \nWhile the court can grant Plaintiff’s motion based on his non-constitutional \n8 \nAPA claims, the government notably fails to address Mr. Arreola’s core constitutional \n9 \nargument.  Mr. Arreola’s procedural due process argument is based on a controlling \n10 \nline of cases holding that, even absent a claim of entitlement to an important benefit, \n11 \nonce it is conferred, recipients have a protected property interest that requires a fair \n12 \nprocess before the government may take that benefit away.  See PI Mot. at 18-19 \n13 \n(citing, inter alia, Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971)). Thus, even though \n14 \nDACA is ultimately discretionary, once granted, the government cannot take it away \n15 \nwithout due process.  \n16 \nThe government makes no attempt to refute this principle. Instead, it cites a \n17 \ncases holding that, as a general matter, discretionary benefits do not give rise to a \n18 \nprotected property interest.  See Opp. at 22-24 (citing cases). But Mr. Arreola never \n19 \nmakes that contention, and none of those cases involve the revocation of a \n20 \ndiscretionary benefit that has already been conferred. \n21 \nThe government further argues that the DACA guidance does not give rise to a \n22 \nprotected property interest, see Opp. at 23-24, but again this argument is a straw man. \n23 \nMr. Arreola does not argue that the DACA program itself establishes a protected \n24 \ninterest. Instead, he argues only that, having previously granted him DACA, the \n25 \ngovernment may not strip him of it without a fair procedure.  Defendants’ remaining \n26 \narguments likewise miss the mark. Mr. Arreola does not premise his claim on a \n27 \nsubstantive right “to work in the United States without authorization,” nor has he \n28 \nalleged a “right to family unity” or a deprivation of liberty.  Opp. at 21. \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 27 of 31   Page ID #:667\n1  Finally, the government does not even attempt to suggest that its actions \n2  satisfied due process.  Indeed, the government could not since—as it concedes, see \n3  Opp. at 8-9—Mr. Arreola was stripped of DACA without any process whatsoever. \n4  This is especially true given that USCIS already provides a procedure whereby \n5  DACA recipients are afforded a reasoned explanation for its actions and an \n6  opportunity to present arguments and evidence.  See PI Mot. at 17.  \n7  The Court should likewise reject Defendants’ contention that Mr. Arreola’s due \n8  process claim fails for lack of prejudice.  See Opp. at 30-31.  The Ninth Circuit has \n9  questioned whether prejudice is even required under these circumstances.  See Ching \n10  725 F.3d at 1156 (characterizing question of whether prejudice is required outside of a \n11  challenge to inadequate process in removal proceedings as “not settled”).  In any \n12  event, Plaintiff’s burden is a lenient one.  See id. at 1156-57 (finding that prejudice \n13  “standard does not demand absolute certainty; rather prejudice is shown if the \n14  violation potentially affects the outcome of the proceedings”) (internal quotation \n15  marks omitted).  Indeed, courts “may infer prejudice even absent any allegations as to \n16  what the petitioner or his witnesses might have said” if given the opportunity.  \n17  Zolotukhin v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 1073, 1077 (9th Cir. 2005).  \n18  Mr. Arreola easily satisfies this test. Defendants argue that CBP relied on \n19  significant evidence in issuing an NTA the night it arrested Mr. Arreola, and therefore \n20  that providing Mr. Arreola with an opportunity to present information is not likely to \n21  make a difference. Opp. at 29-31.  As explained previously, however, Mr. Arreola \n22  does not challenge CBP’s decision to issue an NTA; rather, his claim challenges \n23  USCIS’ subsequent decision to treat the NTA as automatically cancelling his DACA, \n24  without considering the grounds for the NTA and making a determination in the \n25  totality of the circumstances, and without providing him with notice, a reasoned \n26  explanation, or opportunity to respond.  Mr. Arreola’s evidence would show, among \n27  other things, that Mr. Arreola strenuously denies being involved in smuggling aliens; \n28  the agency’s own decisionmaker found his testimony credible that he was not; he has \n20 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 28 of 31   Page ID #:668\n1  no criminal history; he has been a model employee; and he is a primary financial \n2  supporter of his U.S. citizen and permanent resident family members, as well as a \n3  caretaker of his U.S. citizen sister with serious disabilities.  See Doc. No. 16-3, \n4  Declaration of Jesús Alonso Arreola Robles (“Arreola Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-6, 14-17, 41.  \n5  Given that Mr. Arreola remains eligible for DACA, having the benefit of information \n6  about Mr. Arreola’s positive equities and evidence that he did not engage in criminal \n7  conduct has at least the “potential” to impact USCIS’ decision. See Zolotukhinm, 417 \n8  F.3d at 1077 (rejecting government’s contention that petitioner could not show \n9  prejudice because he lacked good character and would not prevail on his claims even \n10  if given a fair hearing). \n11  In sum, the termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and EAD in the absence of a \n12  fair process violates his procedural due process rights. \n \n13 \nIV.  THE REMAINING INJUNCTION FACTORS FAVOR MR. ARREOLA. \n14 \nThe government does not dispute that the harm it is causing Mr. Arreola is \n15 \nirreparable.  Indeed, it could not do so given that the Ninth Circuit has expressly found \n16 \nthat undermining DACA recipients’ employment constitutes irreparable harm. \n17 \nArizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014) (“The \n18 \nirreparable nature of Plaintiffs’ injury is heightened by Plaintiffs’ young age and \n19 \nfragile socioeconomic position. Setbacks early in their careers are likely to haunt \n20 \nPlaintiffs for the rest of their lives.”); see also Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at \n21 \n*6 (finding irreparable harm caused by loss of employment and “sense of well-being” \n22 \nfollowing termination of DACA); Colotl, 2017 WL 2889681, at *12; PI Mot. at 21-22. \n23 \nThe government instead suggests that Mr. Arreola’s claims are not urgent \n24 \nbecause his DACA was terminated eight months before the filing of this case.  Opp. at \n25 \n11.  That delay, in additional to being inconsequential, reflects Mr. Arreola’s good \n26 \nfaith attempts to advocate with the agency to reconsider its unreasoned decision.  See, \n27 \ne.g., Kwon Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. 1 (Plaintiff’s counsel correspondence with ICE); Id. ¶ 3, Ex. \n28 \n2 (Plaintiff’s counsel correspondence with USCIS); see also Eiland Decl. ¶ 4 \n21 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 29 of 31   Page ID #:669\n1  (describing efforts to engage legislators to inquire with DHS regarding reinstatement \n2  of Mr. Arreola’s DACA).  The government does not and cannot contend that Mr. \n3  Arreola—who lost his job at Chateau Marmont and is expecting a child at the end of \n4  December, Arreola Decl. ¶¶ 3, 40-41—does not face imminent irreparable harm.  And \n5  Mr. Arreola’s situation bears no resemblance to that in Quach v. Bank of Am., Nat. \n6  Ass’n, No. 12–5037 EJD, 2012 WL 4498873, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2012), Opp. at \n7  11, in which the plaintiff waited until two days before a trustee sale to seek a \n8  temporary restraining order challenging it.  Here, Mr. Arreola’s DACA grant would \n9  have remained valid until August 2018.  In any event, a months-long delay “is not \n10  particularly probative in the context of ongoing, worsening injuries.”  Arc of \n11  California v. Douglas, 757 F.3d 975, 990–91 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding months-long \n12  delay “prudent”).  The irreparable harm to Mr. Arreola is ongoing and worsening: the \n13  loss of his work permit will become even more acute with the birth of his child in less \n14  than two months.  Arreola Decl. ¶¶ 3, 40-41.  Moreover, because his DACA grant \n15  would have expired in August 2018, if his revocation is not preliminarily enjoined, he \n16  may lose the opportunity for meaningful relief altogether. \n17  The government also does not dispute that requiring it to comply with the APA \n18  and the Constitution would serve the public interest.  See PI Mot. at 22.  Nor does it \n19  dispute the interests of Mr. Arreola’s U.S. citizen and permanent resident family \n20  members in a fair and reasoned determination of whether his DACA should be \n21  terminated. See id. at 21-22.  Nor does the government explain how re-evaluating the \n22  termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA under its own standards would cause the agency \n23  harm—especially when it has such review procedures already in place.  See id.  And \n24  although the government certainly has an interest in the enforcement of the \n25  immigration laws, the agencies administering those laws are required to act lawfully. \n26  In sum, the remaining factors support a preliminary injunction. \n27  Defendants’ suggestion that enjoining the termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA \n28  would require a mandatory injunction is unavailing.  A prohibitory injunction \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 30 of 31   Page ID #:670\n1  maintains the status quo, which is defined as “not simply any situation before the \n2  filing of the lawsuit, but rather the last uncontested status that preceded the parties’ \n3  controversy.”  Dep’t of Parks & Rec. v. Bazaar Del Mundo, Inc., 448 F.3d 1118, 1124 \n4  (9th Cir. 2006).  Here, that “last uncontested status” is when Mr. Arreola had DACA \n5  and an EAD.  Because the preliminary injunction Mr. Arreola requests would merely \n6  preserve that status quo by enjoining Defendants from enforcing the unlawful \n7  termination of his DACA, he does not request a mandatory injunction.  See, e.g., \n8  Auntie Anne’s, Inc. v. Wang, No. 14-cv-01049, 2014 WL 11728722, at *7 (C.D. Cal. \n9  July 16, 2014) (explaining that a mandatory injunction “requir[es] affirmative conduct \n10  that goes well beyond the status quo”); San Diego Minutemen v. California Bus. \n11  Transp. & Hous. Agency’s Dep’t of Transp., 570 F. Supp. 2d 1229, 1256 (S.D. Cal. \n12  2008) (enjoining defendant’s revocation of plaintiff’s adopt-a-highway permit likely \n13  in violation of First Amendment preserved the status quo).12   \n14  CONCLUSION \n15  For these reasons, the Court should grant Plaintiff’s Motion for a Preliminary \n16  Injunction and order Defendants to reinstate Mr. Arreola’s DACA and work \n17  authorization pending a fair procedure—including reasonable notice, a reasoned \n18  explanation, and an opportunity to be heard—through which he may challenge any \n19  revocation decision consistent with the APA and the Due Process Clause.  \n20  Dated: November 6, 2017    Respectfully submitted, \n \n21 \n/s/ Katrina L.

See Opp. at \n12.  On the contrary, Mr. Arreola has requested that the Court enjoin the revocation of \n27 \nhis DACA and prohibit Defendants from terminating it again without complying with \n28  its own rules, as well as with the APA and due process. \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 25   Filed 11/06/17   Page 31 of 31   Page ID #:671\nDavid Hausman* \n1 \nACLU FOUNDATION \n2  IMMIGRANTS’ RIGHTS PROJECT \n \n3 \nAhilan T.

Plaintiffs \n5  have satisfied their burden to show that the Rule 23 requirements are met. The \n6  proposed class members—DACA recipients who, like Mr. Arreola, have had or will \n7  have their DACA and employment authorization documents (“EADs”) arbitrarily and \n8  abruptly stripped away, despite having no disqualifying criminal convictions—all \n9  suffer the same harm. The government does not dispute that it has a nationwide \n10  practice of terminating DACA and work authorization without notice or process, \n11  notwithstanding recipients’ continued eligibility for the program. Nor does it contest \n12  that that the DACA criteria and program rules govern USCIS’s DACA determinations \n13  and are applicable to all DACA recipients, or that Plaintiffs all seek the same \n14  injunctive relief barring the government’s unlawful practices. \n15  Defendants’ opposition instead rests on mischaracterizations of Plaintiffs’ class \n16  definition, as well as merits arguments that the Court has already rejected. Moreover, \n17  the government presents erroneous and misleading information about Plaintiffs’ cases \n18  in an attempt to make them appear dissimilar to the class. Even if this information \n19  were accurate, however, Plaintiffs would still be suitable class representatives. Indeed, \n20  Defendants’ mischaracterizations only underscore the value of notice, a reasoned \n21  explanation, and an opportunity to be heard.  \n22  BACKGROUND \n23  Plaintiffs seek certification of the following Notice Class of individuals: \n \n24 \nAll recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) who, \n25  after January 19, 2017, have had or will have their DACA grant and \nemployment authorization revoked without notice or an opportunity to \n26 \nrespond, even though they have not been convicted of a disqualifying \n27  criminal offense. \n28  Dkt. 39-1, Class Cert. Mot. at 3. Plaintiffs ask the Court to declare unlawful and \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 57   Filed 02/12/18   Page 7 of 18   Page ID #:1813\n1  enjoin Defendants’ policy and practice of automatically terminating class members’ \n2  DACA and work authorization without prior notice, a reasoned explanation, and an \n3  opportunity to be heard, including where Defendants have terminated DACA based \n4  solely on a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) charging unlawful presence in the U.S. See id. \n5  at 21-22. \n6  Three critical errors are repeated throughout Defendants’ opposition: \n7  First, Defendants incorrectly state that Plaintiffs have excluded from the Notice \n8  Class certain individuals who had their DACA terminated based on a determination \n9  that they are enforcement priorities. See Dkt. 53, Class Cert. Opp. at 5. To the \n10  contrary, the plain terms of the class definition include all individuals whose DACA \n11  was terminated without process and who lack disqualifying criminal convictions—\n12  including individuals deemed enforcement priorities. See Class Cert. Mot. at 3. \n13  Plaintiffs separately pled, but have not moved for certification of, an Enforcement \n14  Priority Class of individuals whose DACA was terminated based on a determination \n15  that they are enforcement priorities. See Dkt. 32, Am. Compl. ¶ 169. Although \n16  individuals arbitrarily labeled enforcement priorities are included in both classes, the \n17  Notice Class claims challenge the process by which the termination of their DACA \n18  was effectuated, whereas the Enforcement Priority Class claims challenge the \n19  enforcement priority designation as an appropriate basis for the termination.  \n20  Second, Defendants rehash their prior unsuccessful arguments that the DACA \n21  Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) permit termination without notice in two \n22  situations encompassed by the class definition. Defendants assert that the SOPs allow \n23  for automatic termination of DACA whenever immigration authorities issue an NTA \n24  initiating removal proceedings. See Class Cert. Opp. at 11-12. However, the Court \n25  already rejected this argument, holding that there is “no provision in the DACA SOPs \n26  that permits automatic termination as a result of an NTA based on unauthorized \n27  presence.” PI Order at 11. Instead, there is “only one narrow circumstance in which \n28  automatic termination based on an NTA is appropriate” and that is “when an NTA is \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 57   Filed 02/12/18   Page 8 of 18   Page ID #:1814\n1  issued after USCIS determines that a disqualifying offense or public safety concern is \n2  deemed to be ‘Egregious Public Safety’ (‘EPS’).” Id.; see also Dkt. 16-4, Kwon Decl. \n3  ¶ 21, Ex. 20 (“DACA SOPs”) at 136-38; Dkt. 40-1, Class PI Mot. at 15. In all other \n4  cases, the default termination procedures apply, which include notice and an \n5  opportunity to be heard. See PI Order at 11; see also Class PI Reply at 7-8. \n6  Further, Defendants contend that not all class members are entitled to the same \n7  relief, because in their erroneous view the SOPs permit automatic termination \n8  whenever an individual is labeled an “enforcement priority.” See Class Cert. Opp. at \n9  15. But Defendants’ argument, even if it were correct, is irrelevant. The agency’s own \n10  rules expressly state that individuals like Plaintiffs and proposed class members who \n11  continue to meet the DACA program’s criteria are not enforcement priorities. See \n12  Class PI Reply at 6-7; Class PI Mot. at 4, 15 n.11; see also Colotl v. Kelly, 261 F. \n13  Supp. 3d 1328, 1343 (N.D. Ga. 2017), reconsideration denied, No. 17-cv-1670-MHC, \n14  2017 WL 4956419 (N.D. Ga. July 31, 2017). Accordingly, it would be a violation of \n15  Defendants’ own rules to designate DACA-eligible individuals as enforcement \n16  priorities. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 160-62, 167, 185. In any event, the SOPs require notice \n17  and an opportunity to respond in all cases other than those in which USCIS has made \n18  an EPS determination. See Gonzalez Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 17-\n19  cv-1840, 2017 WL 4340385, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017); Class PI Reply at 6-8.1   \n20  Third, Defendants misrepresent facts about Plaintiffs and members of the \n21  proposed class in an unsuccessful effort to make them appear dissimilar. See Class \n22  Cert. Opp. at 2-4.2 Notably, Defendants wrongly assert that Plaintiffs “committ[ed] \n23  crimes,” even though none of the Plaintiffs have been convicted of the crimes alleged, \n                                           \n24 \n1   See also DACA SOPs at 138 (directing adjudicators to refer the case to USCIS \n25  headquarters to determine whether termination is appropriate through issuance of a \nNotice of Intent to Terminate). \n26  2   As explained below, even if Defendants’ misrepresentations were accurate, they \nwould be immaterial to whether class certification is appropriate, as Defendants do not \n27 \nallege that Plaintiffs or other affected individuals have been convicted of a \n28  disqualifying crime.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 57   Filed 02/12/18   Page 9 of 18   Page ID #:1815\n1  and USCIS did not terminate their DACA on that basis, but instead terminated based \n2  on issuance of an NTA. See Class Cert. Mot. at 7-8. \n3  •  Plaintiff José Eduardo Gil Robles (“Mr. Gil”) was never charged with any \n4  felonies, contrary to the government’s allegations. In fact, Mr. Gil was charged \n5  with a single misdemeanor traffic violation for driving on a cancelled license.  \n6  See Declaration of Maria Teresa Trafton ¶¶ 2-3, Exs. A-B. Nor has Mr. Gil \n7  been convicted of that charge. In fact, the case has been continued and the \n8  charge will be dismissed if Mr. Gil completes probation. Id.¶ 4, Ex. C.  \n9  •  Although Plaintiff Ronan Carlos DeSouza Moreira (“Mr. Moreira”) was \n10  initially arrested on suspicion of forgery, he was never charged with that crime. \n11  Instead, he was charged with a misdemeanor for possession of an altered \n12  identification document. Hausman Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A. \n13  •  The government also misleadingly suggests that proposed class member Felipe \n14  Abonza Lopez is somehow differently situated than Plaintiffs or other proposed \n15  class members because he was arrested on suspicion of alien smuggling. \n16  However, like Mr. Arreola, Mr. Abonza Lopez was not charged with any crime, \n17  and USCIS terminated his DACA based on the issuance of an NTA charging \n18  him with unlawful presence. See Dkt. 39-13, Eiland Decl. ¶ 11.   \n19  •  Proposed class member Daniel Ramirez Medina likewise was never charged \n20  with any crime, and USCIS terminated his DACA based on an NTA charging \n21  him with unlawful presence. See Medina v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. \n22  17-cv-218, 2017 WL 2954719, at *5 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 14, 2017), report and \n23  recommendation adopted, 2017 WL 1101370 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 24, 2017). He \n24  has steadfastly denied having any gang affiliation. See id.  \n25  Notwithstanding the government’s misrepresentations and attempts to rely on \n26  improper post hoc rationalizations, each of these individuals is a member of the \n27  proposed class, has not been convicted of any disqualifying offense, and remains \n28  eligible for DACA. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 57   Filed 02/12/18   Page 10 of 18   Page ID #:1816\n1  ARGUMENT \n2 \nI.  The Court Should Provisionally Certify the Proposed Class for \nPurposes of Entering a Classwide Preliminary Injunction. \n3 \nA.  The Proposed Class Satisfies the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). \n4 \nNotwithstanding Defendants’ arguments to the contrary, there is no question \n5 \nthat all class members have suffered the same injury here: the termination of their \n6 \nDACA and work authorization without process.3 And all class members seek \n7 \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief under the APA and Due Process Clause prohibiting \n8 \nthose practices. Thus, Plaintiffs easily satisfy Rule 23(b)(2). See Class Cert. Mot. at \n9 \n21-23 (citing, inter alia, Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1125 (9th Cir. 2010) \n10 \n(certification under Rule 23(b)(2) “does not require [the court] to examine the viability \n11 \nor bases of class members’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief,” but only to \n12 \nlook at the uniformity of relief requested)). \n13 \nDefendants rely on merits arguments going to Plaintiffs’ claim that the \n14 \ngovernment’s termination practices violate the DACA rules, attempting to suggest that \n15 \ncertain class members are not entitled to the same relief (Class Cert. Opp. at 15), but \n16 \nthese arguments have for the most part been previously raised and rejected. As \n17 \ndiscussed above, this Court has already rejected the government’s argument that the \n18 \nDACA “SOPs” permit automatic termination for individuals issued an NTA charging \n19 \nonly unlawful presence. PI Order at 11. Instead, as this Court already has held, under \n20 \nthe SOPs, individuals issued such NTAs are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be \n21 \n                                           \n22  3   The cases Defendants cite on injury are wholly distinguishable. See, e.g., Santos \nv. TWC Admin. LLC, No. 13-cv-04799, 2014 WL 12558009, at *11 (C.D. Cal.

Id. \n2  Similarly, contrary to the government’s contentions, USCIS may not deny class \n3  members process by labeling them “enforcement priorities” because the DACA rules \n4  provide that DACA-eligible individuals are, by definition, not enforcement priorities. \n5  See Class PI Reply at 6-7. Critically, the class is defined to include only individuals \n6  who are eligible for DACA—and the DACA Memorandum explains that DHS’s \n7  enforcement resources should not be expended on “these low priority cases”—\n8  referring to individuals who meet the eligibility criteria—and instead “on people who \n9  meet our enforcement priorities.” Napolitano Memo, Kwon Decl. ¶ 10, Ex. 9 at 1.4  \n10  Accordingly, because class members cannot properly be labelled “enforcement \n11  priorities,” Defendant’s argument is not only incorrect, it is irrelevant.  \n12  And although the SOPs permit automatic termination in EPS cases, any \n13  difference in treatment of EPS cases under USCIS’s rules is irrelevant to Plaintiffs’ \n14  constitutional due process claim, as well to Plaintiffs’ APA claims that termination \n15  based on an NTA charging unlawful presence is arbitrary and capricious, and that \n16  Defendants impermissibly changed position without providing a good reason. \n17  Moreover, as a practical matter, most individuals who meet the EPS definition are also \n18  convicted of a disqualifying crime and would therefore be excluded from the class \n19  definition. See Kwon Decl. ¶ 22, Ex. 21 at 3-4. Notably, Defendants have not pointed \n20  to a single example of someone who would fall within the class definition but who \n21  received a Termination Notice from USCIS stating an EPS concern as the basis for \n22  termination.5 \n                                           \n23 \n4   Further, as discussed above, the SOPs do not permit automatic termination for \n24 \nindividuals deemed “enforcement priorities.” As this Court has held, the SOPs require \nnotice except in cases where USCIS has determined that there is an Egregious Public \n25 \nSafety concern and follows the appropriate procedures for termination without notice. \n26 \nSee DACA SOPs at 138; PI Order at 11; see also Class PI Reply at 6-8; Gonzalez \nTorres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *3. \n27 \n5   Should the Court have concerns about over-breadth, however, the Court could \n28  modify the class definition to create a subclass of individuals who received or will \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 57   Filed 02/12/18   Page 12 of 18   Page ID #:1818\n1  Nor are individualized “mini-trials” required to determine whether an individual \n2  is in fact a class member and entitled to injunctive relief, as Defendants claim. See \n3  Class Cert. Opp. at 15. Rather, it is administratively feasible to determine who is a \n4  class member based on clear and objective criteria and by reference to the \n5  government’s own records: the individual (1) has had or will have had his or her \n6  DACA terminated without issuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate and an \n7  opportunity to respond to the reasons for termination; and (2) the individual has not \n8  been convicted of a disqualifying crime set forth in the DACA Memorandum or \n9  SOPs. See Class Cert. Mot. at 19-20 (citing cases holding that administrative burden \n10  required to identify class members does not undermine certification).  \n11  Finally, Defendants complain that Jessica Colotl6 is no longer eligible for relief \n12  because she already received notice and an opportunity to respond to her DACA \n13  termination as a result of a preliminary injunction order, and that two DACA \n14  recipients who were placed in removal proceedings had not yet received termination \n15  notices from USCIS. See Class Cert. Opp. at 16. But it is noncontroversial that \n16  individuals will enter and exit the class as their circumstances change over time. The \n17  class as a whole will continue to be subject to Defendants’ unlawful termination \n18  practices, in violation of their APA and due process rights, regardless of whether \n19  every individual class member continues to need relief. Perez-Olano v. Gonzalez, 248 \n                                                                                                                                             \n20 \nreceive Termination Notices citing an EPS determination. See Armstrong v. Davis, \n275 F.3d 849, 871 n. 28 (9th Cir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson v. \n21 \nCalifornia, 543 U.S. 499 (2005) (“Where appropriate, the district court may redefine \n22  the class . . . .”); Wolph v. Acer Am. Corp., 272 F.R.D. 477, 482–83 (N.D. Cal. 2011) \n(discussing courts’ broad discretion to modify a class definition and redefining class). \n23 \n  The SOPs also permit USCIS to automatically terminate the DACA of \nindividuals who travel outside the United States after August 15, 2012, without first \n24 \nreceiving permission to do so through a grant of advance parole. See Kwon Decl. ¶ 20, \n25  Ex. 19 at Q57. Plaintiffs did not intend to include these individuals in the class. The \nCourt may modify the class definition to exclude this likely very small number of \n26 \nindividuals. \n6   Even if Ms. Colotl were presently unable to secure relief through an injunction \n27 \nin this case, her experience is nonetheless relevant to demonstrate the numerosity of \n28  the proposed class and the existence of a nationwide policy. \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 57   Filed 02/12/18   Page 13 of 18   Page ID #:1819\n1  F.R.D. 248, 259 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (Rule 23(b)(2) is well suited for cases where the \n2  class encompasses a “shifting population”) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nB. Plaintiffs’ Claims Present Common Questions with Common Answers. \n3 \nDefendants likewise fail to refute Plaintiffs’ showing of commonality. See Fed. \n4 \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA \n5 \nand work authorization without process violates the APA and the Due Process Clause. \n6 \nSee, e.g., Perez-Olano, 248 F.R.D. at 257 (even “a single” common legal issue is \n7 \nsufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement). These common legal questions \n8 \ndrive resolution of the case. Indeed, should the Court agree that Defendants’ \n9 \ntermination practices are unlawful, all class members will benefit from the requested \n10 \nrelief: a nationwide injunction preventing termination of their DACA pursuant to \n11 \nthose practices. Thus, Plaintiffs satisfy Rule 23(a)(2). See Class Cert. Mot. at 14-15.  \n12 \nThe government’s argument as to commonality is largely redundant with its \n13 \narguments as to Rule 23(b)(2), see Class Cert. Opp. at 20-21, and Defendants’ \n14 \nattempts to pick out differences amongst class members fail for the same reasons set \n15 \nforth above. See Point I.A., supra. Defendants also contend, wrongly, that the class \n16 \nlacks commonality because DACA ultimately involves an individualized discretionary \n17 \ndetermination. Class Cert. Opp. at 20. But Plaintiffs are not challenging any ultimate \n18 \nexercise of discretion, and resolving Plaintiffs’ claims does not involve individualized \n19 \nbalancing. Instead, a single common answer—a nationwide injunction barring the \n20 \ngovernment’s unlawful practices permitting automatic, process-less termination—\n21 \napplies to the entire class.7 See Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1046 (9th Cir. 1998) \n22 \n(finding commonality satisfied with respect to process claims notwithstanding \n23 \n                                           \n24 \n7   The government also notes that some class members may have removal orders, \n25  see Class Cert. Opp. at 21, but that is irrelevant, as such individuals may still be \neligible for DACA and still may challenge its unlawful revocation. See Napolitano \n26 \nMemorandum at 3. The government also complains that the class may include \nindividuals who are granted immigration relief or deported, but that is absurd: \n27 \nindividuals who obtain a lawful immigration status or are deported have no need for \n28  DACA.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 57   Filed 02/12/18   Page 14 of 18   Page ID #:1820\n1  “[d]ifferences among the class members with respect to the merits” of their cases). \nC. The Proposed Class Is So Numerous that Joinder Is Impracticable. \n2 \nDefendants have failed to counter Plaintiffs’ showing of numerosity. See Fed. \n3 \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). Plaintiffs have identified and submitted evidence of a sizeable \n4 \nnumber of affected individuals across the country—now at least 22 DACA recipients \n5 \nin 10 states8—as well as unrebutted evidence that Defendants engage in a nationwide \n6 \npractice of terminating DACA without process. See Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 3-14; Second \n7 \nDeclaration of Katrina L. Eiland (“Second Eiland Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-8. This practice has \n8 \nlikely already ensnared dozens of other still-eligible DACA recipients, see Doc. No. \n9 \n23-2 ¶ 4 (confirming that there have been hundreds of terminations without notice), \n10 \nand places tens of thousands more at risk of losing their DACA. Notably, although \n11 \nDefendants possess records of all DACA terminations, Defendants have not even \n12 \nalleged, much less provided evidence, that the actual number of challenged \n13 \nterminations is insufficiently numerous. See Civil Rights Educ. & Enf’t Ctr. v. Hosp. \n14 \nProps. Trust, 317 F.R.D. 91, 100 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (plaintiffs seeking only injunctive \n15 \nand declaratory relief “may rely on [the] reasonable inference[] . . . that the number of \n16 \nunknown and future members . . . is sufficient to make joinder impracticable”) \n17 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, the prospective nature of the relief \n18 \nPlaintiffs seek makes joinder of all class members impracticable regardless of class \n19 \n                                           \n20  8   Plaintiffs previously submitted evidence documenting 17 DACA recipients who \nhave already had their DACA terminated without process, as well as two additional \n21 \nindividuals who received NTAs but had not yet been terminated by USCIS. Eiland \n22  Decl. ¶¶ 3-15. Defendants suggest that the two additional individuals were included in \nthe 17. This is not only incorrect—see Eiland Decl. ¶ 15—but Defendants ignore that \n23 \ntheir experiences support a reasonable inference that the challenged practices will \nharm additional DACA recipients in the future. Moreover, in the weeks since \n24 \nPlaintiffs filed this motion, Plaintiffs have learned of five additional individuals who \n25  have had their DACA terminated without process despite remaining eligible, bringing \nthe total number of known affected DACA recipients to 22. See Second Eiland Decl. \n26 \n¶¶ 3-8. Finally, Defendants’ suggestion that Mr. Gil, Mr. Moreira, and other proposed \nclass members are not class members because they are enforcement priorities is not \n27 \nonly flat wrong, but it improperly relies on a post hoc rationale. See supra at 4; see \n28  Class PI Reply at 2, 5 n.2. \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 57   Filed 02/12/18   Page 15 of 18   Page ID #:1821\n1  size. See Class Cert. Mot. at 13 (collecting cases). This is even more so now that the \n2  government has resumed accepting renewal applications.9 Finally, the characteristics \n3  of the proposed class—a geographically dispersed and growing group of young adults \n4  who have abruptly lost their means of financial support—further support the \n5  impracticability of joining all of its members. See Jordan v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 669 \n6  F.2d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. 1982), vacated on other grounds, 459 U.S. 810 (1982) \n7  (explaining that the geographical diversity of class members, difficulty of filing \n8  separate suits, and the fact that only injunctive or declaratory relief is sought weigh in \n9  favor of concluding that joinder is impracticable).  \n10  Courts in the Ninth Circuit and elsewhere frequently certify classes based on \n11  evidence of a similar number of known individuals, particularly where, as here, the \n12  class includes unknown present and future class members. See, e.g., Saravia v. \n13  Sessions, No. 17-cv-03615, 2017 WL 5569838, at *20-21 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017) \n14  (certifying nationwide class of unaccompanied minors based on evidence of 15 known \n15  members and likelihood of future members); Chief Goes Out v.

The Named Plaintiffs Satisfy Adequacy and Typicality. \n2 \nThe government has failed to identify any material differences or actual \n3 \nconflicts between Plaintiffs and the proposed class members that would defeat \n4 \nPlaintiffs’ showing of typicality and adequacy. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3), (4). \n5 \nDefendants’ arguments rest on the same flawed premises discussed above—i.e., that \n6 \nPlaintiffs are not members of the proposed class (based on Defendants’ \n7 \nmischaracterization of their facts and the class definition) and that they are not entitled \n8 \nto process. Both of these arguments fail for the reasons discussed above. See Point \n9 \nI.A.; see also Class PI Reply at 1-2, 4-10.  \n10 \nThe Ninth Circuit has emphasized that the typicality requirement is \n11 \n“permissive” and requires only that the representative’s claims are “reasonably \n12 \ncoextensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially \n13 \nidentical.” Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1124 (internal quotation marks and citation \n14 \nomitted); see also id. (certifying class of noncitizens detained for more than six \n15 \nmonths without a bond hearing even where proposed class members were “detained \n16 \nunder different statutes” and were “at different points in the removal process”). \n17 \n“[T]ypicality is not defeated if there are legal questions common to all class \n18 \nmembers.” Ali v. Ashcroft, 213 F.R.D. 390, 409 (W.D. Wash. 2003), aff’d, 346 F.3d \n19 \n873 (9th Cir. 2003), vacated on other grounds, 421 F.3d 795 (9th Cir. 2005). Here, \n20 \nPlaintiffs easily satisfy this test: Plaintiffs and proposed class members have suffered \n21 \nthe identical injury—termination of their DACA and EADs despite not being \n22 \ndisqualified—and they bring common claims under the APA and the Due Process \n23  Clause challenging those terminations as unlawful.11  \n24 \n                                                                                                                                             \n25  2014) (employing reasonable inferences to find that class was sufficiently numerous)). \n11   Even if the DACA rules permitted termination without process in some limited \n26 \ncircumstances covered by the class definition, it would not defeat typicality or \nadequacy. Indeed, as explained above, it could only possibly impact Plaintiffs’ claim \n27 \nbased on the SOPs, which is just one of the several reasons why Defendants’ actions \n28  violate the APA, and it would not undermine Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim. \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 57   Filed 02/12/18   Page 17 of 18   Page ID #:1823\n1  Similarly, Defendants have pointed to no reason why Plaintiffs and proposed \n2  class members have divergent interests, such that Plaintiffs are inadequate \n3  representatives. Although Defendants state that some current members of the \n4  proposed class may be able to reapply for DACA or seek to have their DACA \n5  reinstated through other means, they fail to explain how this could create any \n6  antagonistic interests. See Cummings v. Connell, 316 F.3d 886, 896 (9th Cir. 2003) \n7  (“[T]his circuit does not favor denial of class certification on the basis of speculative \n8  conflicts.”). Moreover, any individuals granted renewals are at risk of having their \n9  DACA unlawfully terminated once again unless Defendants’ practices are enjoined. \n10  Finally, as explained above, it is routine for some individuals to enter and exit the \n11  class as new individuals are harmed and claims become moot. See Point I.A., supra. \nE. Nationwide Certification Is Appropriate in Light of Defendants’ \n12 \nUnlawful Nationwide Conduct. \n13 \nFinally, Defendants present no evidence that undermines the appropriateness of \n14 \nnationwide certification where, as here, the government admittedly engages in the \n15 \nchallenged practice regardless of location, and has already unlawfully terminated \n16 \nDACA in at least 10 states. See Class Cert. Mot. at 22-23; Second Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 3-8. \n17 \nInstead, Defendants cite authority that does not support its position.12 In fact, courts \n18 \nroutinely certify nationwide classes in immigration cases where, as here, the evidence \n19 \nsupports a nationwide practice. See Saravia, 2017 WL 5569838, at *20; Perez-Funez \n20 \nv. Dist. Dir., I.N.S., 611 F. Supp. 990, 1000 (C.D. Cal. 1984); Gorbach v. Reno, 181 \n21 \nF.R.D. 642, 644 (W.D. Wash. 1998); Arnott v.

No. 32], \n7  following Defendants’ restoration of Plaintiff Arreola’s Deferred Action for Childhood \n8  Arrivals (“DACA”) and employment authorization document (“EAD”), per this Court’s \n9  November 21, 2017, Order. [Dkt. No. 31].  \n10  Plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges Defendants “have targeted numerous DACA \n11  recipients and unlawfully revoked the grants of deferred action and work permits they \n12  have received even though these individuals have abided by all the program rules and \n13  have not engaged in any conduct that would disqualify them from the program.” Dkt. No. \n14  32 at ¶ 1. On this basis, Plaintiffs seek the extraordinary relief of forcing DHS to reinstate \n15  their DACA and enjoining the Government from terminating DACA in the future for the \n16  individual plaintiffs as well as for a nationwide class of those similarly situated. \n17  However, Plaintiffs’ allegations fall apart when examined in full context. Each \n18  Plaintiff was arrested for engaging in criminal activities, determined to be an enforcement \npriority, and placed into removal proceedings, which had the unremarkable effect of \n19 \nterminating their DACA. Every step of the process Defendants followed is accounted for \n20 \nin DACA policy and immigration law, and Plaintiffs were forewarned of the risk to their \n21 \nDACA for engaging in criminal activity. Plaintiffs offer no support for their claim that \n22 \nDefendants are “targeting” DACA grantees for wholesale automatic termination.  \n23 \nThe Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended complaint as a challenge to the \n24 \nGovernment’s authority to initiate removal proceedings, which this Court lacks \n25 \njurisdiction to review. Furthermore, Congress has made clear that any claims the Court \n26 \nmay find cognizable, including constitutional claims, related to the initiation or conduct \n27 \nof removal proceedings against Plaintiffs, must be raised in those proceedings before an \n28 \n \n    1 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 12 of 33   Page ID #:1887\n \n   \n1  immigration judge, and appealed to a court of appeals through the for review process if \n2  necessary. If the Court were to find jurisdiction to hear these challenges to the initiation \n3  of removal proceedings, it should still dismiss for failing to state a claim for which relief \n4  can be granted. Deferred action is an entirely discretionary grace, not an immigration \n5  benefit nor a protection from removal.  \n6  BACKGROUND \n7  When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) or U.S. Customs and \n8  Border Protection (“CBP”) issues a notice to appear (“NTA”) to a DACA grantee, \n9  regardless of the reason, there is no requirement in the DACA SOP or elsewhere for \n10  USCIS to make a separate decision to terminate the individual’s DACA or EAD.1 Rather, \n11  the decision to issue an NTA to an individual with DACA is the decision to no longer \n12  defer action against that individual, and the charge selected for the NTA does not have to \n13  reflect DHS’s full reasoning. Nothing restricts DHS’s authority to issue an NTA because \n14  someone was previously found to warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion \n15  in the form of deferred action, nor is a criminal conviction or criminal charge necessary \n16  to justify termination of DACA. While the Napolitano Memo and DACA SOP identify \n17  and explain threshold criteria for DACA consideration, nothing limits DHS’s discretion \n18  to grant, deny, or terminate DACA on a case by case basis.2 Nor is the DACA SOP the \n19  only authority establishing the process by which deferred action terminates. \nPlaintiff Arreola had his DACA and EAD terminated automatically through the \n20 \nissuance of an NTA, after CBP law enforcement officers encountered him engaged in \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23  1 Defendants incorporate by reference the explanation of the DACA policy, the EAD application process \nfor individuals with no lawful status, and the process by which removal proceedings are initiated through \n24 \nNTA issuance, provided in Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for Class Certification, Section \n25  II.A and B. Dkt. No. 53 at 7-13. \n26  2 In fact, USCIS may still grant DACA to an individual with a disqualifying criminal conviction, See Dkt. \nNo. 53-1 at 70; or deny DACA to an individual with no criminal history. Id. at 38 (“Individuals may be \n27  considered for DACA upon showing that they meet the prescribed guidelines . . .”); id. at 78 (“USCIS \nlacks the authority to consider requests from individuals who are in immigration detention under the \n28 \ncustody of ICE at the time of filing”). \n \n    2 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 13 of 33   Page ID #:1888\n \n   \n1  alien smuggling, the facts of which he conceded in an interview with Border Patrol \n2  Agents. See Dkt. 23-2 at 26, 56-57. Mr. Arreola’s DACA and EAD were then reinstated \n3  on November 22, 2017, and on December 20, 2017, DHS issued a Notice of Intent to \n4  Terminate pursuant to this Court’s Order. See Dkt. No. 31; Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 87. \n5  On September 20, 2017, Plaintiff Gil was arrested and charged with two felonies, \n6  including assault in the first degree and transferring a firearm without a background \n7  check to a prohibited person. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 4-7, 9-15. On November 6, 2017, \n8  ICE issued Gil an NTA charging him with unlawful presence. Id. On November 14, \n9  2017, USCIS issued him a Notice of Action, stating his DACA and EAD terminated \n10  automatically with the NTA. See Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 109.  \n11  On November 3, 2017, Plaintiff De Souza was arrested for forgery in the first \n12  degree, a felony.3 See Dkt. 53-1 at 17-18, 20-24. De Souza admitted to police that he \n13  had altered the expiration date on his driver’s license due to it expiring. Id. On \n14  November 5, 2017, ICE issued De Souza an NTA charging unlawful presence, and on \n15  November 10, 2017, USCIS issued a Notice of Action informing De Souza his DACA \n16  and EAD terminated automatically with the NTA. Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 129. \n17  Organizational Plaintiff Inland Empire claims no injury of its own, and only \n18  prospective harm to its members. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 135 (“Defendants’ unlawful \ntermination policies and practices are likely to harm IEIYC DACA recipients.”).  \n19 \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n20 \nRegardless of how the arguments are framed, Plaintiffs directly challenge DHS’s \n21 \nauthority to initiate removal proceedings, which this Court should dismiss for lack of \n22 \nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and 8 \n23 \nU.S.C. § 1252. By definition, a demand to restore deferred action terminated by the \n24 \ninitiation of removal proceedings challenges the agency’s determination to initiate \n25 \nremoval proceedings. Any interpretation of these statutes that permits district court \n26 \n27                                                   \n3  Plaintiffs  incorrectly  assert  that  Plaintiff  De  Souza  was  arrested  for  “possession  of  an  altered \n28 \nidentification document—a misdemeanor.” Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 101. \n \n    3 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 14 of 33   Page ID #:1889\n \n   \n1  challenges to actions inextricably linked to the initiation of removal proceedings would \n2  run counter to Congress’s intent, to Supreme Court case law, and to the law of this \n3  Circuit. Plaintiffs’ due process challenges must also fail, because they cannot show a \n4  protected interest in DACA or EADs. In fact, reinstating Plaintiffs’ EADs following the \n5  institution of removal proceedings would violate duly-enacted DHS regulations that \n6  operate independent of, and superior to, DACA policy.  \n7  Additionally, Plaintiffs Arreola and Inland Empire lack standing in this matter. \n8  Most importantly, and contrary to Plaintiffs’ unsupported allegations, DHS issued \n9  Plaintiffs NTAs based on individualized determinations that Plaintiffs’ criminal conduct \n10  rendered them enforcement priorities, and it did so with the knowledge of each Plaintiffs’ \n11  DACA. Thus, the decision to initiate removal proceedings preceded the consequence of \n12  Plaintiffs’ DACA and EAD terminating, and no reasonable argument can be made that the \n13  terminations did not arise out of that decision, such that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) prevents this \n14  Court from reviewing either step. To the extent this Court may find Plaintiffs have any \n15  viable legal claims arising from the “decision[s] or action[s]” of DHS to initiate removal \n16  against these Plaintiffs, Congress enacted 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a and 1252 to channel those \n17  claims to an immigration court and ultimately to the appropriate court of appeals.  \n18  ARGUMENT \n19 \nI.  Standard of Review \n20 \nA. Dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) \n21 \nBecause federal courts have limited jurisdiction, a court must dismiss any case if it \n22 \nlacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1); Owen Equip. & \n23 \nErection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 374 (1978). “A federal court is presumed to lack \n24 \njurisdiction in a particular case unless the contrary affirmatively appears.” Stock W., Inc. \n25 \nv. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, 873 F.2d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir. 1989). \n26 \nThe elements necessary to establish standing “must be supported in the same way as any \n27 \nother matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.” Lujan v. Defenders of \n28 \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). Moreover, when the issue of jurisdiction is separable \n \n    4 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 15 of 33   Page ID #:1890\n \n   \n1  from the merits of the case, no presumption of truthfulness attaches to a plaintiff’s \n2  allegations, and the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction exists. Thornhill \n3  Publ’g Co. v. Gen. Tel. & Elecs. Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 733 (9th Cir. 1979). \n4  The “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” to assert federal court \n5  jurisdiction requires “the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact . . . which is . . . \n6  concrete and particularized, . . . the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged \n7  action of the defendant, and . . . it must be likely . . . that the injury will be redressed by a \n8  favorable decision.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (internal citations and modifications omitted).  \n9  “Allegations of possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements of Art[icle] III.” \n10  Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Program v. U.S. Drug Enf’t Admin., 860 F.3d \n11  1228, 1235 (9th Cir. 2017), citing Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1141 \n12  (2013). Finally, while an imminent future harm may establish standing, the harm alleged \n13  cannot be the result of plaintiff’s own unlawful conduct. Id. at 1042, quoting O’Shea v. \n14  Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 497 (1974). \n15  An organization suing on its own behalf must also show that the claimed injury is \n16  “both a diversion of its resources and a frustration of its mission.” La Asociacion de \n17  Trabajadores de Lake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, 624 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010). \n18  An organization suing on behalf of its members must show that: “(1) its members would \notherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the interests it seeks to protect are \n19 \ngermane to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief \n20 \nrequested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” Int’l Union, \n21 \nUnited Auto., Aerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 282 \n22 \n(1986).   \n23 \nB. Dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \n24 \nTo survive dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), “the complaint must allege sufficient \n25 \nfacts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n26 \n550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). Although the Court must accept as true all well-pleaded \n27 \nfactual allegations when determining the legal sufficiency of a claim, it need not credit \n28 \n \n    5 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 16 of 33   Page ID #:1891\n \n   \n1  “legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.” Id. at 555. “Threadbare recitals of the \n2  elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” \n3  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  . \n4  II.  Plaintiff Inland Empire should be dismissed for lack of standing  \n5  Plaintiff Inland Empire lacks standing on its own and lacks standing on behalf of \n6  its members. Inland Empire describes the work that it has done for and with DACA \n7  recipients, both as members and as clients, since the policy’s inception. See Dkt. No. 32 \n8  at 29-31. However, Inland Empire makes no claim that the Government’s actions have \n9  diverted its resources or frustrated its mission in the service of members who have lost \n10  DACA without advanced notice or an opportunity to respond. See La Asociacion de \n11  Trabajadores de Lake Forest, 624 F.3d at 1088. Nor does Inland Empire identify a single \n12  member of its organization who has lost DACA with or without advanced notice. In fact, \nPlaintiff is clear that its sole concern in this matter is the prospective harm its members \n13 \nmay possibly face in the future. Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 135 (“Defendants’ unlawful termination \n14 \npolicies and practices are likely to harm IEIYC DACA recipients.”); Or. Prescription \n15 \nDrug Monitoring Program, 860 F.3d at 1235.  \n16 \nThus, Inland Empire has not shown organizational injury, and it may not represent \n17 \nits individual members unless those members themselves would have standing as \n18 \nplaintiffs, and then only if those individual members would not be required to participate \n19 \nin the lawsuit. Brock, 477 U.S. at 282. Here, Plaintiffs’ amended complaint does not \n20 \nestablish standing for even one of Inland Empire’s members. Even if it did, the very fact-\n21 \nspecific inquiry necessary to determine why such a fictional plaintiff lost his or her \n22 \nDACA, and whether he or she would be entitled to additional process before such \n23 \ntermination, would require that person to participate in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs offer no \n24 \nrationale to overcome these requirements. Furthermore, while Inland Empire alleges \n25 \nfuture potential harm to its members even if they do not commit any disqualifying \n26 \nconduct, the only present harm plaintiffs allege in their complaint is DACA termination \n27 \n28 \n \n    6 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 17 of 33   Page ID #:1892\n \n   \n1  that was based on the unlawful conduct of the plaintiffs.4 And a plaintiff may not assert \n2  standing based on future harm that would only occur if the plaintiff first engages in \n3  unlawful behavior. Hodgers-Durgin, v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1042 (9th Cir. 1999). \n4  Plaintiffs offer no examples of a DACA recipient whose DACA automatically terminated \n5  without having first engaged in criminal activity. Thus, they show no basis for standing \n6  on the premise that such an action might occur to one of their members sometime in the \n7  future. Because Plaintiff Inland Empire fails to meet the standing requirements for an \n8  individual or an organization, it should be dismissed from this action.  \n9  III.  Plaintiff Arreola Robles should be dismissed from this action for lack of \nstanding and because his claim is no longer ripe \n10 \nBecause Plaintiff Arreola’s DACA and EAD were reinstated on November 22, \n11 \n2017, pursuant to this Court’s Order, and he subsequently filed an amended complaint on \n12 \nDecember 21, 2017, the grounds he asserted for standing in his original complaint are no \n13 \nlonger before this Court, and he has failed to establish any injury in the amended \n14 \ncomplaint ripe for this Court’s adjudication. See Dkt. Nos. 31, 32. As discussed in the \n15 \nprevious section, the Court may not find standing based on the possibility of future harm \n16 \nto cure his present lack of standing, particularly if that possible future harm is predicated \n17 \non Plaintiff’s future unlawful conduct.  \n18 \nWhen “a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then voluntarily amends the \n19 \ncomplaint, courts look to the amended complaint to determine jurisdiction.” Rockwell \n20 \nInt'l Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007). Thus, the fact that Plaintiff Arreola \n21 \nhad a valid DACA grant at the time he filed his amended complaint means he lacks \n22 \nstanding to assert any injury from the termination of his DACA in the present action.  \n23 \nFurthermore, where Defendants have issued Plaintiff Arreola a Notice of Intent to \n24 \nTerminate his DACA, along with an opportunity to respond to their intended action, the \n25 \npossibility that he will experience automatic termination of his DACA without such \n26 \nnotice and opportunity in the future (or that such a termination would be based on \n27 \n                                                 \n28  4 As explained below, the particular charge of unlawful presence on each plaintiff’s NTA is not the only \nreason the NTA was issued, and the lack of additional charges on the NTA does not infirm the process.  \n \n    7 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 18 of 33   Page ID #:1893\n \n   \n1  something other than his criminal conduct) is essentially nil. Additionally, Plaintiff \n2  Arreola’s challenge to his ongoing NOIT process – intending to terminate his DACA \n3  based on the determination that he is an enforcement priority – is not ripe because \n4  Defendants’ action is not final. See 5 U.S.C. § 704 (“Agency action made reviewable by \n5  statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are \n6  subject to judicial review.”); Kings Cty. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 694 F. App’x 472, 473 \n7  (9th Cir. 2017) (“We have neither Constitutional jurisdiction nor statutory jurisdiction \n8  because the Declaratory Order was not final. Expressing our views regarding that order \n9  would amount to an advisory opinion, which would not resolve ‘concrete legal issues, \n10  presented in actual cases, not abstractions.’”) (citations omitted). Plaintiff Arreola now \n11  has the opportunity to argue to USCIS that his DACA should not be terminated. Though \n12  Defendants maintain that the decision to terminate any individual’s DACA is committed \n13  to agency discretion and ultimately unreviewable, the lack of a final agency decision in \n14  Plaintiff Arreola’s case is an additional basis for this Court to dismiss him from this \n15  action.  \n16  IV.  This Court must dismiss the amended complaint because Plaintiffs fail to \nestablish this Court’s jurisdiction  \n17 \nThe Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s APA and Constitutional claims. First, this \n18 \nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review any challenge to DHS’s discretionary determination to issue \n19 \nan NTA, which had the result of automatically terminating DACA and EAD. Second, Plaintiffs \n20 \ncannot state a claim because there is no protected entitlement to DACA or employment \n21 \nauthorization. Finally, nothing in the APA or constitutional jurisprudence, nor Defendants’ own \n22 \npolicies and guidance, supports a right to review or constrain DHS’s exercise of discretion or to \n23 \ngrant Plaintiffs procedural rights other than those available through removal proceedings.  \n24 \nA. DHS’s discretion to initiate removal proceedings and their effect on the \n25 \ntermination of Plaintiffs’ DACA is not reviewable. \n26 \nThe APA permits persons aggrieved by final agency action to obtain judicial review in \n27 \nfederal court where “there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” See 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. A \n28  reviewing court shall set aside agency action found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n \n    8 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 19 of 33   Page ID #:1894\n \n   \n1  discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” or “without observance of procedure \n2  required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). However, the APA precludes judicial review of \n3  agency decisions when “statutes preclude judicial review,” or when the decision is “committed \n4  to agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), (a)(2); see Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, \n5  830 (1985) (“even where Congress has not affirmatively precluded review, review is not to be \n6  had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to \n7  judge the agency's exercise of discretion.”).  \n8  Thus, there are two reasons APA jurisdiction is not available here. First, there is no \n9  separate decision to terminate DACA in these cases because a DHS law enforcement officer \n10  decided, in consideration of each plaintiff’s criminal activity, to initiate removal proceedings \n11  and issued an NTA that automatically terminated DACA; and second, even if the Court found a \n12  separate decision was made, there is still no standard in the SOP or otherwise by which the \n13  Court may review a decision that deferring action is no longer in the Government’s interest.  \n14  Additionally, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims \n15  because Plaintiffs necessarily lack a protected constitutional interest in the process by \n16  which their DACA is terminated, because the ultimate relief they seek – deferred action – \n17  is discretionary. Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).  \n18  i.  Judicial review is barred under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1) because the INA \nlimits review of Plaintiffs’ claims, which arise from DHS’s decision \n19 \nto commence Plaintiffs’ removal proceedings. \n20 \nCongress eliminated judicial review over “any cause or claim by or on behalf of \n21 \nany alien . . . arising from the decision or action . . . to . . . adjudicate cases . . .” 8 U.S.C. \n22 \n§ 1252(g). The issuance of an NTA is a necessary predicate to commencing removal \n23 \nproceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). Through section 1252(g), Congress explicitly precluded \n24 \njudicial review of any challenge arising from any decision or action to commence \n25 \nremoval proceedings. See Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (“AADC”), 525 U.S. \n26 \n471, 483-85 (1999) (finding section 1252(g) also precludes review of the discretionary decision \n27 \nto not initiate removal proceedings); see, e.g., Vilchiz-Soto v. Holder, 688 F.3d 642, 644 (9th \n28 \nCir. 2012) (holding section 1252(g) barred jurisdiction to review the BIA’s discretionary \n \n    9 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 20 of 33   Page ID #:1895\n \n   \n1  decision to not reopen removal proceedings to consider a DACA request).5 The Supreme \n2  Court explained that section 1252(g) was “directed against a particular evil: attempts to \n3  impose judicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.” AADC 588 F.3d at 485 n.9; id. \n4  at 485 (treating “‘no deferred action’ decisions” as “discretionary determinations”); cf. \n5  Silva v. United States, 866 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir. 2017) (section 1252(g) precludes \n6  review of decision to execute removal order even where claim that agency lacked \n7  discretion because removal violated law).  \n8  Section 1252(g) encompasses “cause[s] or claim[s]” that arise from the decision \n9  “or action” to “commence proceedings” against any individual. See, e.g., Sissoko v. \n10  Rocha, 509 F.3d 947, 948-50 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding claim of money damages arose \n11  from decision or action to commence removal proceedings and was, thus, barred by 8 \n12  U.S.C. § 1252(g)); see, e.g., Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1160-61 (9th Cir. 2004) \n13  (finding review of the reopening of removal proceedings, but not the administrative \n14  closure of proceedings, was barred from review as an action related to the decision to \n15  commence removal); Botezatu v. INS, 195 F.3d 311, 314 (7th Cir. 1999) ( (discussing the \n16  scope of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) as including “various decision . . . leading up to order \n17  consequent upon final orders of deportation.”) (citations and quotations omitted).6 A \n18  DACA grant is acknowledgement that DHS is not presently pursuing removal against an \nindividual. Thus, when DHS finds an individual has become an enforcement priority and \n19 \nissues an NTA, DACA will logically terminate and such consequence falls squarely \n20 \nwithin the province of section 1252(g). See, e.g., Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1160-61. To hold \n21 \notherwise would render section 1252(g) a dead letter because any individual could seek \n22 \nto enjoin or otherwise challenge the commencement of removal proceedings through this \n23 \n                                                 \n24 \n5 This authority is consistent with earlier case law interpreting the 1981 Operating Instructions, a previous \n25  policy that provided guidelines for the exercise of deferred action.  See Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 \nF.2d 1021, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985). \n26 \n6 Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2004), is distinguishable from this case and Sissoko, where \n27  the issuance of Plaintiffs’ NTAs occurred before, and were the direct cause of, termination of Plaintiffs’ \nDACA and EADs.  \n28 \n \n    10 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 21 of 33   Page ID #:1896\n \n   \n1  type of creative pleading. See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, 246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir. 2001) \n2  (holding that “a petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove \n3  simply by cloaking [a claim] in constitutional garb”).7  \n4  Applied to the context of this case, a challenge to the decision to terminate DACA \n5  by the issuing an NTA is a necessarily a challenge that arises out of the decision or action \n6  to initiate removal proceedings because the NTA is the document that is used to initiate \n7  removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  Thus, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) necessarily bars \n8  judicial review.  See Vilchiz-Soto, 688 F.3d at 644.     \n9  To the extent that Plaintiffs have any viable claims, the REAL ID Act, codified at 8 \n10  U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9), bars them from raising those claims in district \n11  court, regardless of whether a final order of removal has issued. Section 1252(a)(5), \n12  entitled “[e]xclusive means of review,” requires that “a petition for review filed with an \n13  appropriate court of appeals . . . shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review \n14  of an order of removal . . . .” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5). Section 1252(b)(9) provides \n15  “[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application \n16  of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding \n17  brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available \n18  only in judicial review of a final order under this section.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) \n(emphasis added); see, e.g., J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1038 (district court lacked jurisdiction \n19 \nover challenge to adequacy of removal procedures, and instead court of appeals has \n20 \nauthority to resolve questions of constitutional rights on review of a final removal order).  \n21 \nImportantly, the Ninth Circuit found that Section 1252(b)(9) is “a clear statutory \n22 \nprescription against district court review” of challenges arising from removal proceedings \n23 \nfor plaintiffs who had not yet received final orders of removal. See J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26  7 In analogous circumstances, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the applicability of Section \n1252(g)  to  bar  district  court  review  of  the  automatic  termination  of  discretion-based  employment \n27  authorization documents following the commencement of removal proceedings, in accordance with 8 \nC.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii). See Gupta v. Holder, No. 611CV1731ORL35GJK, 2011 WL 13174873, at *1 \n28 \n(M.D. Fla. Oct. 31, 2011), aff’d sub nom. Gupta v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 485 F. App’x 386 (11th Cir. 2012).  \n \n    11 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 22 of 33   Page ID #:1897\n \n   \n1  1035-38 (“The minors . . . attempt to get around [section 1252(b)(9)] by claiming that \n2  they have been (or will be) denied meaningful judicial review in light of their juvenile \n3  status.”) (emphasis added). While the Court acknowledged that “an unrepresented minor \n4  in immigration proceedings poses an extremely difficult situation,” it also found “these \n5  considerations cannot overcome a clear statutory prescription against district court \n6  review. Relief is through review in the court of appeals or executive or congressional \n7  action.” Id. at 1036-1038.8 \n8  Congress’s intent was simple and uncontroversial: if the issue is one that can be \n9  raised in removal proceedings, and ultimately in a petition for review, then the statute \n10  precludes district court review. See id. at 1034 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 173 \n11  (statute was “intended to preclude all district court review of any issue raised in a removal \n12  proceeding”)); cf. Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 9-10 (“Congress plainly intended to put an end to \n13  the scattershot and piecemeal nature of the review process . . . .”). This approach \n14  effectuates the general rule precluding simultaneous review of a question by both an \n15  administrative body and a federal court. See Acura of Bellevue v. Reich, 90 F.3d 1403, \n16  1408-9 (9th Cir. 1996).  \n17  Here, the sequence of events could not be more clear: Plaintiffs engaged in criminal \n18  conduct, DHS determined their conduct rendered them enforcement priorities, DHS issued \neach an NTA, the respective NTA caused each Plaintiff’s DACA and EAD to terminate, \n19 \nand Plaintiffs filed this challenge. There can be no doubt that DHS’s discretionary \n20 \ndecision to issue NTAs was the direct cause of Plaintiffs’ DACA terminations. See Dkt. \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23  8 The Court’s previous reliance on Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2007), to support section \n1252(b)(9) applying only to a final order of removal is misplaced because that language is dicta and \n24  conflicts with the plain language of the statute. Dkt. No. 31 at 7. Singh brought a challenge of ineffective \nassistance of counsel through a habeas petition, and the Court found that the challenge was not tied to \n25 \nremoval proceedings, so section 1252(b)(9) did not apply regardless of whether a final order had issued. \n26  Singh, 499 F.3d at 978-79. To interpret Singh as permitting district court challenges such as those raised \nhere runs counter to Congressional intent, and would effectively excise the words “any action taken” from \n27  the statute. See Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 10; cf. Martinez v. Napolitano, 704 F.3d 620, 623 (9th Cir. 2012) (an \nAPA claim “challeng[ing] the procedure and substance of an agency determination that is ‘inextricably \n28 \nlinked’ to the order of removal” must be channeled through the petition for review process). \n \n    12 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 23 of 33   Page ID #:1898\n \n   \n1  53-1 at 4-24. Thus, Plaintiffs’ challenges necessarily arise from “action taken or \n2  proceedings brought to remove an alien,” for which district courts lack jurisdiction.  \n3  ii.  Judicial review of Plaintiffs’ claims is also barred under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2), because how and when an NTA issues is committed to \n4 \nagency discretion  \n5 \nThere is no judicial review under the APA of decisions that “courts traditionally \n6 \nhave regarded as ‘committed to agency discretion.’” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 \n7 \n(1993) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)). These decisions are typically unreviewable \n8 \nbecause there exists “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \n9 \nexercise of discretion.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 830. This bar applies even when “the agency \n10 \ngives a ‘reviewable’ reason for otherwise unreviewable action.” ICC v. Bhd. of \n11 \nLocomotive Eng’rs, 482 U.S. 270, 283 (1987) (“BLE”). \n12 \nThe decisions committed to executive discretion include “an agency’s exercise of \n13 \nenforcement power.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. Such judgments involve “a complicated \n14 \nbalancing of factors which are peculiarly within [an agency’s] expertise,” including \n15 \n“whether agency resources are best spent on this violation or another, whether the agency \n16 \nis likely to succeed if it acts, whether the particular enforcement action requested best fits \n17 \nthe agency’s overall priorities, and, indeed, whether the agency has enough resources to \n18 \nundertake the action at all.” Id. As there is “no meaningful standard against which to \n19 \njudge the agency’s exercise of discretion” in weighing these factors, an agency’s exercise \n20 \nof enforcement powers is “presumed immune from judicial review under § 701(a)(2).” Id. \n21 \nat 830, 832.  \n22 \nAn agency’s decision to enforce the law against a particular individual is likewise \n23 \npresumptively unreviewable. Just as “the decision whether or not to prosecute” \n24 \npresumptively “rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s] discretion,” United States v. Armstrong, \n25 \n517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (citation omitted), an agency’s decision to bring a civil \n26 \nenforcement action is generally not open to judicial scrutiny. Considerations such as the \n27 \nChaney factors are equally present in enforcement decisions as in nonenforcement \n28 \n \n    13 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 24 of 33   Page ID #:1899\n \n   \n1  decisions. See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831; see also Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, \n2  607-8 (1985) (“[T]he decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review”). \n3  One form of that broad discretion is deferred action, a “discretionary and \n4  reversible” decision to notify an alien that DHS has chosen not to seek his removal for a \n5  specific period of time. Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Like other \n6  agency nonenforcement decisions, grants of deferred action rest on a complex balancing \n7  of policy considerations that cannot serve as “meaningful standard against which to judge \n8  the agency’s exercise of discretion.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. The converse is equally \n9  true: denials of deferred action are also committed to agency discretion. See AADC, 525 \n10  U.S. at 485 (treating “‘no deferred action’ decisions” as “discretionary determinations”). \n11  Because “[g]ranting an illegally present alien permission to remain and work in this \n12  country” is fundamentally “a dispensation of mercy,” there are “no standards by which \n13  judges may patrol its exercise.” Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1051 (5th Cir. 1990) \n14  (INS’s decision not to grant pre-hearing voluntary departures and work authorizations to \n15  a group of aliens was non-justiciable).  \n16  Even where an agency has promulgated regulations or provided internal guidance, \n17  decisions involving the exercise of prosecutorial discretion are generally not subject to \n18  judicial review. See Pasquini v. Morris, 700 F.2d 658, 659 (11th Cir. 1983) (holding that \nImmigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) Operating Instructions regarding \n19 \ndeferred action did not confer substantive rights on an alien and courts could not review a \n20 \nclaim that INS failed to comply with these internal instructions). \n21 \nThus, individual DACA terminations, especially where based on issuance of NTAs, \n22 \nfall squarely within that category of agency discretion for which judicial review is \n23 \nimproper. See Chaney, 470 F.3d at 830; see also Morales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822, \n24 \n828 (9th Cir. 2016) (noting that “the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a type of \n25 \ngovernment action uniquely shielded from and unsuited to judicial intervention”). In \n26 \nPlaintiffs’ cases, there is no legal question with regard to the DACA guidelines, because \n27 \nthe DACA guidelines merely allow an individual to seek a discretionary administrative \n28 \n \n    14 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 25 of 33   Page ID #:1900\n \n   \n1  grace in the form of DACA. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 38 (“Individuals may be considered for \n2  DACA upon showing that they meet the prescribed guidelines . . .”). DACA is unlike \n3  immigration benefits where eligibility is found in statute or regulation, and which Courts \n4  have found that the non-discretionary denial of such benefits may be reviewed.9  \n5  Here, Plaintiffs are challenging DHS’s exercise of its enforcement power granted \n6  by Congress. See Dkt. 32 Prayer for Relief (seeking to “Enjoin Defendants from revoking \n7  the DACA grants and EADs . . . based on the filing of an NTA charging solely” unlawful \n8  presence). This is a classic challenge to DHS’s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. \n9  See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. This type of enforcement decision involves a balancing of \n10  factors committed to agency discretion by law, including how to allocate agency \n11  resources. See id.; Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464. The question for DHS was not whether it \n12  could exercise its discretion in favor of the Plaintiffs, but rather whether it should do so in \n13  each case. Because this type of discretionary determination is committed to DHS \n14  discretion by law, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Plaintiffs’ claims. \n15  iii.  Plaintiffs cannot state a constitutional claim because the termination \nof DACA does not implicate a constitutional interest. \n16 \nPlaintiffs assert incorrectly that “[i]ndividuals who have been granted DACA have \n17 \nimportant constitutionally protected interests in their DACA grant and employment \n18 \nauthorization.” Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 164. However, Plaintiffs necessarily lack a protected \n19 \nconstitutional interest in their DACA and in the process to terminate DACA because the \n20 \nultimate result sought – deferred action – is discretionary, and because the Government \n21 \nnever expressed a mutual intention to confer a protected benefit in DACA.  \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  9 The Court’s reliance on United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc) and \nMadu v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 470 F.3d 1362 (11th Cir. 2006) is misplaced. In both cases, courts reviewed \n25 \na “purely legal question” that set the stage for a discretionary decision. However, the DACA SOP \n26  identifies threshold criteria for DACA consideration, but it does not mandate granting DACA if those \nthreshold criteria are met. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 38 (“Individuals may be considered for DACA upon \n27  showing that they meet the prescribed guidelines . . .”). Even if the Court finds those criteria enforceable, \nthey are not the subject of the exercises of prosecutorial discretion to issue NTAs, which terminate DACA \n28 \nnotwithstanding compliance with the threshold criteria.  \n \n    15 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 26 of 33   Page ID #:1901\n \n   \n1  The “Due Process Clause does not protect everything that might be described as a \n2  ‘benefit.’” Castle Rock, 545 U.S. at 756. Particular due process rights must be established \n3  on the basis of entitlement to a property or liberty interest, the risks of loss associated \n4  with deprivation of that interest, and the competing interests of the government in not \n5  providing that interest. Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982) (quoting Mathews v. \n6  Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334-335 (1976)). The Court may view DACA recipients’ \n7  circumstance as unfortunate, but neither the Constitution nor Congress provides an \n8  individual in unlawful status a protected interest in living or working in the United States, \n9  or in discretionary relief from removal. Cf. Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, \n10  535 U.S. 137, 151-52 (2002) (holding, as a general matter, an individual who is not \n11  authorized to work in the United States does not have a right to work); see also Garcia v. \n12  Holder, No., 07-60271, 320 F. App’x 288, 290 (9th Cir. April 9, 2009). \n13  Nor can Plaintiffs claim an entitlement in this case that creates a Constitutional \n14  interest. “To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an \n15  abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He \n16  must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Blantz v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr. & \n17  Rehab., 727 F.3d 917, 922 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, \n18  408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)); see also Mendez-Garcia v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 655, 665 (9th Cir. \n2016) (underscoring that aliens cannot claim a cognizable due process interest in \n19 \ndiscretionary immigration relief or benefits). The Supreme Court, however, has held that \n20 \neven a practice of “generously” granting a “wholly and expressly discretionary state \n21 \nprivilege” does not create a legal entitlement to that benefit. See Regents, 2018 WL \n22 \n339144 at *4  (citing Gerhart v. Lake Cnty., Mont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020-21 (9th Cir. \n23 \n2011)) (“A person’s belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how \n24 \nsincerely or reasonably held, does not create a property right if that belief is not mutually \n25 \nheld by the government.”). \n26 \nPlaintiffs possess no lawful status, thus no protected interest in living or working in \n27 \nthe United States. DACA policy has never purported to alter that, and nor may this Court. \n28 \n \n    16 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 27 of 33   Page ID #:1902\n \n   \n1  Landon, 459 U.S. at 35 (“The role of the judiciary . . . does not extend to imposing \n2  procedures that merely displace congressional choices of policy.”). Because DACA is \n3  discretionary, it does not give rise to a protected right to work in the United States. See \n4  Dkt. No. 16-28 at 2 (“This [DACA grant] does not constitute employment authorization, \n5  nor may it be used in place of an [EAD].”). Nor does DACA confer lawful status. See \n6  Dkt. No. 16-13 (“This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or \n7  pathway to citizenship.”). DACA is not protection from removal. See Dkt. No. 16-23 \n8  (“DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be terminated \n9  at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.”).  \n10  Plaintiffs’ claims regarding an interest in employment authorization and other \n11  public benefits like driver’s licenses are particularly misplaced, because there is no right \n12  to the receipt of either, and no judicial review of the decision to terminate an EAD once \n13  granted. See Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 35; Pilapil v. INS, 424 F.2d 6, 11 (10th Cir. 1970); see also \n14  Perales, 903 F.2d at 1047-48 (“[T]here is nothing in the [INA] expressly providing for \n15  the grant of employment authorization . . . to aliens who are the beneficiaries of approved \n16  petitions”) (vacating the challenged portion of the injunction); Gupta, 2011 WL \n17  13174873 at *1 (finding a challenge to the termination of EAD upon initiation of removal \n18  proceedings was an impermissible challenge to the discretionary decision to initiate \nremoval proceedings). In the condtext of Plaintiffs’ claims here that they have a right to \n19 \nDACA and therefore EADs, the Ninth Circuit has refused the same proposition. See Neri, \n20 \n229 F. App'x at 508 (an individual “has no substantive due process right to discretionary \n21 \nrelief from removal or deportation.”); Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. \n22 \n2003) (finding no liberty interest in discretionary forms of relief from deportation).  \n23 \nIn fact, every individual with employment authorization based on 8 C.F.R. \n24 \n§ 274a.12(c), including those with deferred action, is subject to automatic termination of \n25 \ntheir EAD upon institution of removal proceedings in an immigration court. See 8 C.F.R. \n26 \n§ 274a.14(a)(1)(ii); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.13, 1003.14. No notice or opportunity to respond is \n27 \nafforded to any deferred action recipient in this posture, and Plaintiffs point to nothing \n28 \n \n    17 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 28 of 33   Page ID #:1903\n \n   \n1  that supports a contrary finding. Cf. Gupta, 2011 WL 13174873 at *1 (denying challenge \n2  to automatic EAD termination). Because EAD termination is not tied to operation of the \n3  DACA SOP, Plaintiffs’ claims of harm regarding EAD loss must fail. Further, the DACA \n4  SOP instructs USCIS to defer to existing law and regulations where there is any conflict \n5  with the SOP. See Dkt. No. 16-24 at 17, DACA SOP Chapter One (“Any provision of the \n6  [INA] or 8 C.F.R. found . . . to be in conflict with this SOP will take precedence over the \n7  SOP.”). Thus, it would be inappropriate for the Court to find the SOP requires a process \n8  before termination of a DACA-based EAD due to NTA issuance by CBP or ICE, which is \n9  contrary to the plain language of the duly promulgated regulation. \n10  Furthermore, under DHS regulations, an individual with deferred action who has \n11  lost his EAD due to having been placed into removal proceedings may reapply for an \n12  EAD if he or she becomes eligible again under a category of subsection 274a.12(c). Only \n13  if employment authorization is granted again would the individual then be eligible to \n14  apply to their state authority for a driver’s license or Social Security card. ADAC, 757 \n15  F.3d at 1061. Thus, the peripheral benefits Plaintiffs cite to illustrate the urgency of the \n16  relief they seek are two steps removed from the relief this Court can grant.10  \n17  For these reasons, and because Plaintiffs by definition concede removability and \n18  challenge only termination of a discretionary temporary grant of deferred action from \nremoval, “the Court cannot conclude that the government has deprived [plaintiffs] of \n19 \n[their] liberty interest in remaining in the United States without due process of law.” \n20 \nMendez de Leon v. Reno, No. C 97-02482 CW, 1998 WL 289321, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Mar. \n21 \n26, 1998).  \n22 \n23  B. Plaintiff’s Fail to State a Claim Under the APA.  \nEven if this Court finds that it would have jurisdiction over any of Plaintiffs’ \n24 \nclaims, the Court should still dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended complaint because Plaintiffs’ \n25 \nfail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiffs cannot establish either an \n26 \n27                                                   \n10 None of the provisions that Plaintiffs cite at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)–(3) and 1621(d) depends directly \n28 \non the receipt of DACA. Dkt. No. 32 at ¶ 35. \n \n    18 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 29 of 33   Page ID #:1904\n \n   \n1  administrative or a constitutional right to receive any process regarding the termination of \n2  DACA because deferred action is necessarily an exercise of the Executive’s prosecutorial \n3  discretion. See Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831; Regents, 2018 WL 339144 at *18 (“Congress has \n4  been free to constrain DHS’s discretion with respect to granting deferred action, but it has yet to \n5  do so.”). In fact, DHS acted based on that discretion by issuing NTAs based on Plaintiffs’ \n6  criminal activity. Thus, the limited grace a temporary grant of DACA serves to recognize \n7  was overridden by the Government’s determination that Plaintiffs had become \n8  enforcement priorities. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 4-7, 17-18. Defendants respectfully disagree with \n9  the Court’s prior order granting a preliminary injunction to Plaintiff Arreola, see Dkt. No. 31, \n10  and endeavor to address that order here. Id. at 9, 11, 12. \n11  i.  DACA termination by NTA is provided for in the DACA SOP and \npolicy documents, and in DHS policy and regulations.  \n12 \nThere is no support in the Napolitano Memo for the proposition that DACA policy \n13 \nlimits ICE or CBP’s authority to issue NTAs that will have the effect of terminating \n14 \ngrants of deferred action, like DACA. See Dkt. No. 16-13. Contrary to the Court’s \n15 \nprevious finding, the Napolitano memo does not limit this authority only for the period \n16 \n“as DACA was developed.” Dkt. No. 31 at 12.  \n17 \nNor does DHS guidance prevent immigration enforcement agencies from \n18 \nterminating DACA by issuing an NTA. The authority to issue an NTA is vested with all \n19 \nDHS immigration officers. See 8 C.F.R. § 239.1(a). However, DHS divides NTA issuance \n20 \nresponsibility between USCIS in its administrative capacity, and ICE and CBP in their \n21 \nlaw enforcement capacities. See 2011 NTA Memo, Dkt. No. 16-25. USCIS is required to \n22 \nrefer all cases involving criminal conduct, not limited to Egregious Public Safety \n23 \n(“EPS”), to ICE. Id. at 5. USCIS’s decision to issue an NTA on its own under such \n24 \ncircumstances must follow ICE’s lead. Id. at 5 & 6 (“USCIS will not issue an NTA in \n25 \nthese cases if ICE declines to issue an NTA.”) (emphasis added); id. at 2 (“USCIS must \n26 \nensure that its issuance of NTAs fits within and supports the Government’s overall \n27 \nremoval priorities . . . .”). When a case is referred by USCIS, ICE may issue an NTA that \n28 \n \n    19 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 30 of 33   Page ID #:1905\n \n   \n1  automatically terminates DACA, with no additional notice or opportunity to respond. See \n2  Dkt. No. 16-24 at 39.  \n3  The effect of NTA issuance on DACA termination is unremarkable, and is \n4  recognized elsewhere in the DACA SOP. See Dkt. No. 53-1 at 91-92 (providing that \n5  USCIS will deny, without advance notice and an opportunity to respond, a DACA request \n6  from an individual in immigration detention who ICE intends to release but who ICE \n7  indicates is an enforcement priority). While the SOP instructs USCIS to “discuss” a \n8  disagreement it may have with ICE’s finding, id., there is no provision permitting USCIS \n9  to reverse ICE’s decision. See Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898, 901 (3d Cir. 2016) \n10  (finding no jurisdiction based on Section 1252(g) to review an ICE officer’s unilateral \n11  denial of a DACA request to a detained individual because “that decision involves the \n12  exercise of prosecutorial discretion not to grant a deferred action.”).11 \n13  Indeed, where DHS has worked to ensure that ICE’s determination that someone is \n14  an enforcement priority would not be conflicted by a later discretionary exercise by \n15  USCIS to grant deferred action in the form of DACA, and where the Napolitano Memo \n16  specifically preserves the NTA authority of ICE and CBP upon consideration of the \n17  DACA guidelines, it takes a particularly strained reading of the Napolitano Memo and \n18  DACA SOP to find that ICE and CBP cannot issue NTAs that have the effect of \nterminating DACA. In fact, the Court’s and Plaintiffs’ interpretation of Defendants’ \n19 \nguidance creates an absurd scenario in which ICE would institute new administrative \n20 \nremoval proceedings against an individual while that individual seeks additional separate \n21 \nlegal process regarding the termination of their DACA. That scenario also strips the \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24  11 The Court’s prior order improperly concludes that the SOP termination chapter requires USCIS to \nadjudicate a termination after ICE has issued an NTA for EPS. Dkt. No. 31 at 9. While the NTA Memo \n25 \nstates “ICE’s issuance of an NTA allows USCIS to proceed with adjudication . . . ,” Dkt. No. 16-25 at 5 \n26  (emphasis added), the guidance is optional and the DACA SOP explicitly diverges from it in important \nways. The DACA SOP termination chapter instructs USCIS to follow the NTA Memo, but also states that \n27  ICE’s issuance of an NTA on an EPS referral from USCIS “will result in the termination of DACA.” Dkt. \nNo. 16-24 at 38; see also id. at 34 (“USCIS “will deny the DACA request.”) (emphasis added).  \n28 \n \n    20 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 31 of 33   Page ID #:1906\n \n   \n1  immigration enforcement agencies of their most critical authority. Regents, 2018 WL \n2  339144, at *1 (“One of the key enforcement tools under the INA is removal, i.e., \n3  deportation. In turn, ‘[a] principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion \n4  exercised by immigration officials.’”(citing Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 \n5  (2012))).12 \n6  DHS’s discretion to initiate removal proceedings that have the effect of terminating \n7  DACA is not impeded by DACA policy or immigration law in any way, and so this Court \n8  should dismiss Plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleging otherwise. \n9  ii.  There is no requirement that an NTA charge more than unlawful \npresence, nor is it arbitrary to rely on the decision to issue an NTA. \n10 \nPlaintiffs argue, and this Court agreed, that USCIS impermissibly relies on only \n11 \nunlawful presence as the charge listed in an NTA as the sole basis to terminate DACA. \n12 \nDkt. No. 31 at 6, 10: Dkt. No. 32 at ¶¶ 159, 165. However, that conclusion relies on a \n13 \nstarkly oversimplified consideration of the NTA decision process. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 53-1 \n14 \nat 9-15, 20-24 (summaries of the information considered in Plaintiffs’ NTA issuances). \n15 \nThere is no basis in the SOP or other DACA-related guidance for the Court to find that an \n16 \nNTA charging removability on the basis of presence without admission is not sufficient to \n17 \nterminate DACA. Nor can Plaintiffs establish that an individual in receipt of an NTA \n18 \nbased on unlawful presence cannot also have been found to be an enforcement priority.  \n19 \nFirst, the charges listed in an NTA are not dispositive of the reasons for issuing an \n20 \nNTA.13 DHS is under no obligation to charge an individual with anything more than \n21 \n22                                                   \n12 The fact that USCIS may grant DACA to nondetained aliens in removal proceedings or with final orders \n23 \nof removal does not change this analysis. Just as USCIS has the discretion to grant DACA to those \nrequestors based on the totality of circumstances, nothing in DHS policy or guidance prohibits ICE, CBP, \n24 \nor USCIS from similarly exercising discretion to terminate DACA on a case by case basis as an exercise \n25  of agency discretion. \n26  13 This proposition is wholly consistent with the denial portion of the DACA SOP, which provides that, \nwhile to be considered, the charges filed in an NTA are not determinative to the ultimate discretion \n27  decision regarding DACA. Dkt. No. 53-1 at 65 (“Do not rely solely on the grounds listed in the charging \ndocument [. . . ;] review all derogatory information in its totality and then make an informed assessment \n28 \nregarding the appropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion for DACA.”).  \n \n    21 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 32 of 33   Page ID #:1907\n \n   \n1  unlawful presence. Addy v. Sessions, 696 F. App’x 801, 804 (9th Cir. 2017) (rejecting \n2  argument that petitioner should have been charged with removability under a different \n3  statute, because “[t]he Attorney General has prosecutorial discretion over the initiation of \n4  removal proceedings, and that discretion is not reviewable.”). Rather, the decision to \n5  issue an NTA is based on the immigration officer’s experience and information, and – \n6  most importantly – his or her discretion. See Hernandez v. Gonzales, 221 F. App’x 588, \n7  589–90 (9th Cir. 2007) (“Absent evidence to the contrary, we presume that the \n8  immigration officers properly discharged their duties when issuing Hernandez’s NTA.”). \n9  Notably, an NTA also need not include charges used to support the denial of relief from \n10  removal. Salviejo–Fernandez v. Gonzales, 455 F.3d 1063, 1066 (9th Cir. 2006) (denying \n11  due process claim where the BIA found petitioner ineligible for cancellation of removal \n12  based on a conviction not alleged in the NTA). \n13  Here, the discretion exercised in issuing an NTA that has the effect of terminating \n14  DACA is nothing like the arbitrary process this Court cited to in Judulang v. Holder, 565 \n15  U.S. 42 (2011). The Judulang Court rejected the BIA process of interpreting and \n16  comparing the removability charges on an individual’s NTA against a list of charges \n17  under 8 U.S.C. § 1182 that composed grounds for exclusion of an arriving alien, to \n18  determine whether the individual facing removal was eligible for a form of discretionary \nrelief from removal originally reserved for arriving aliens. 565 U.S. at 489-90. The Court \n19 \nequated the process to flipping a coin, such that some violent criminals would be eligible \n20 \nfor relief while some lawful permanent residents (“LPR”) with lesser offenses would be \n21 \nexcluded. Id. at 487 (finding the process had “no connection to the goals of the \n22 \ndeportation process or the rational operation of the immigration laws.”). Here, DACA \n23 \ntermination does not hinge on how the NTA is selected, but rather whether it is selected. \n24 \nMoreover, the facts here demonstrate that DHS’s decision to issue NTAs that have \n25 \nthe result of terminating DACA are not “happenstance,” Dkt. No. 31 at 10; but rather, \n26 \nNTA issuance that results in the termination of DACA represents a valid and thoughtful \n27 \nexercise of agency discretion. The facts here demonstrate that immigration enforcement \n28 \n \n    22 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 59   Filed 02/14/18   Page 33 of 33   Page ID #:1908\n \n   \n1  officers: (1) were specifically aware of each Plaintiffs’ DACA, see Dkt. No. 53-1 at 9-15, \n2  20-24; (2) did not rely solely on unlawful presence in decisions to initiate removal against \n3  Plaintiffs. Id.; see also Dkt. No. 23-2 at 26; and (3) may issue NTAs after supervisory \n4  review or consultation with agency counsel. See Dkt. No 53-1 at 6 ¶ 11.   \n5  CONCLUSION \n6    In sum, Plaintiffs Arreola and Inland Empire have failed to establish standing to \n7  raise the claims in their amended complaint, and all Plaintiffs have failed to establish \n8  jurisdiction for this Court to consider their challenges to the NTA process, which \n9  Congress expressly precluded through section 1252. Nor can Plaintiffs show that, in the \ntermination of their DACA grants they were entitled to any additional process either \n10 \nthrough statute or the Constitution. For these reasons, the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs \n11 \nArreola and Inland Empire and dismiss this entire action for lack of jurisdiction.  \n12 \n \n13 \nDATED: February 14, 2018  Respectfully Submitted, \n14   \nCHAD A.

Hazuda, Susan M. Curda, Thomas D. Homan, David Marin, and Kevin K.\nMcAleenan (“Defendants”).  See Dkt. # 59 (“Mot.”).  Plaintiffs Inland Empire – Immigrant\nYouth Collective, Jesús Alonso Arreola Robles, José Eduardo Gil Robles, and Ronan Carlos De\nSouza Moreira (“Plaintiffs”) oppose the motion, see Dkt. # 73 (“Opp.”), and Defendants replied,\nsee Dkt. # 75 (“Reply”).  A hearing in this matter was held on April 16, 2018.  Having\nconsidered the moving papers and oral arguments, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion.\nI. Background\nThe Court previously recounted the factual background of the Deferred Action for\nChildhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program in general and this action in particular in its order\ngranting Plaintiff Arreola’s motion for a preliminary injunction, see Dkt. # 21 (“Arreola\nOrder”), at 1–3, and its order certifying a nationwide class and issuing a classwide preliminary\ninjunction, see Dkt. # 61 (“Class Order”), at 1–7.  It will now relate only those facts germane to\nDefendants’ motion, cognizant that “[g]enerally, the scope of review on a motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim is limited to the contents of the complaint.”  Marder v. Lopez, 450 F.3d\n445, 448 (9th Cir. 2006).\nA. Factual History\ni. The DACA Program\nPlaintiffs allege that “federal immigration authorities have targeted numerous DACA\nrecipients and unlawfully revoked the grants of deferred action and work permits they have\nreceived even though these individuals have abided by all the program rules and have not\nengaged in any conduct that would disqualify them from the program.”  See First Amended\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 1 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 2 of 31   Page ID #:2144\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nComplaint, Dkt. # 32 (“FAC”), ¶ 1.  Under the DACA program, which was established pursuant\nto a 2012 memorandum (“the Napolitano Memo”) issued by Secretary Janet Napolitano of the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”), “individuals who were brought to the United States\nas children and meet certain specific criteria may request deferred action for a renewable period\nof two years.”  Id. ¶ 26.  Under DACA, young immigrants who entered the United States as\nchildren and meet specified educational and residency requirements, and who pass extensive\ncriminal background checks, are eligible to receive deferred action.  Id. ¶¶ 28, 31; see also\nDeclaration of Dae Keun Kwon, Dkt. # 16-4 (“Kwon Decl.”), ¶ 10, Ex. 9 (“Exercising\nProsecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as\nChildren”) at 1–2 (“Napolitano Memo”).1  A necessary predicate for DACA eligibility is that an\nindividual must lack a lawful immigration status.  FAC ¶ 29; see also Kwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20\n(“National Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\n(DACA)”) at 44 (“DACA SOP”).2  In addition, DACA recipients cannot have been convicted of\na felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors.  See Napolitano\nMemo at 1.  DHS’s DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“the DACA SOP”) set forth the\nprocedures that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) must follow in both\ngranting and terminating DACA.  See DACA SOP at 16; see also Colotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp.\n3d 1328, 1334 (N.D. Ga. 2017) (“The SOP states that it is applicable to all personnel performing\nadjudicative functions and the procedures to be followed are not discretionary.”).\nDeferred action under DACA is granted to qualifying individuals for a period of two\nyears, subject to renewal.  FAC ¶ 26; Napolitano Memo at 2–3.  In addition to submitting\ndocumentation relating to the various DACA criteria, applicants also submit a Form I-765\nApplication for Employment Authorization; if work authorization is granted, DACA recipients\nare issued federal employment authorization documents (“EADs”) and can apply for Social\nSecurity Numbers and other benefits, such as driver’s licenses and unemployment insurance. \nFAC ¶¶ 31–32, 35.\nPlaintiffs assert that\n1 The Napolitano Memo is incorporated by reference into Plaintiffs’ complaint, see FAC ¶ 26 n.\n6, and can thus be considered on a motion to dismiss.  See In re NVIDIA Corp. Sec. Litig., 768\nF.3d 1046, 1051 (9th Cir. 2014) (noting that a court may utilize “attached exhibits, documents\nincorporated by reference, and matters properly subject to judicial notice”); Marder, 450 F.3d at\n448 (“A court may consider evidence on which the complaint ‘necessarily relies’ if: (1) the\ncomplaint refers to the document; (2) the document is central to the plaintiff’s claim; and (3) no\nparty questions the authenticity of the copy attached to the 12(b)(6) motion.”).\n2 The DACA Standard Operating Procedures are also incorporated by reference into the\ncomplaint.

Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\n[a] decision to grant or deny a DACA application or renewal is separate and\nindependent from any removal proceedings in immigration court.  A noncitizen\nwho is in removal proceedings can apply for DACA separately and\nsimultaneously.  If that application is granted, the removal proceedings continue\nunless the immigration judge closes or terminates the proceedings.  Further, an\nimmigration judge has no power to grant or deny DACA, or to review or reverse\nUSCIS’ decision to deny DACA.\nId. ¶ 34 (citing Napolitano Memo at 2).\nii. Plaintiff Arreola\nPlaintiff Arreola was born in Mexico and has lived in the United States since the age of\none, when his parents entered the United States without being inspected at a border crossing. \nFAC ¶ 45.  His parents have since obtained lawful permanent resident statuses, and his three\nyounger sisters, all of whom were born in the United States, are U.S. citizens.  Id. ¶¶ 47, 49–50. \nArreola has received deferred action through DACA three times—in 2012, 2014, and 2016.  Id.\n¶¶ 51–53.  This final grant was set to be valid until August 19, 2018.  Id. ¶ 54.  Using the\naccompanying EAD, Plaintiff worked two jobs, as a dishwasher and then a cook at the Chateau\nMarmont in West Hollywood and as a driver for Uber and Lyft.  Id. ¶ 55.  He shared the\nearnings with his family and paid half the rent for their home.  Id. ¶ 56.  Plaintiffs assert that\nArreola “has never been charged with or convicted of any crime.”  Id. ¶ 58.\nIn February 2017, Plaintiffs claim that a friend asked Arreola to drive his cousin from the\nLos Angeles area to the San Diego area, to pick up the friend’s uncle and another cousin and\nbring them back to Los Angeles—a task for which Arreola would be paid $600.  Id. ¶¶ 59–60. \nArreola accepted, and while he and his customer were near San Diego, the latter was arrested by\nan agent of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”).  Id. ¶¶ 61–63.  Although Arreola\nclaims that he informed the CBP agent of his DACA status, he was also arrested on suspicion of\naiding in the smuggling of undocumented immigrants.  Id. ¶ 64.  CBP detained Arreola and\nissued him a Notice to Appear (“NTA”), initiating removal proceedings and charging him as\nremovable due to his presence in the United States without admission under the Immigration and\nNationality Act (“INA”).  Id. ¶¶ 66–70.  Plaintiffs assert that Arreola was not, however, charged\nwith any crime.  Id. ¶ 71.  On March 2, 2017, Arreola received a bond hearing before an\nimmigration judge and was released from immigration detention the following day.  Id.\n¶¶ 73–77.  Shortly thereafter, on March 6, Arreola received a Notice of Action from USCIS\nnotifying him that his DACA and EAD were “terminated automatically as of the date [his NTA]\nwas issued.”  Id. ¶ 78.

He eventually settled in Minnesota\nand graduated from high school in the Minneapolis area, and has five younger siblings, all of\nwhom were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens.  Id. ¶ 91.  Gil first applied for DACA\nin 2015; it was granted in August of that year and was valid until August 2017.  Id. ¶¶ 95–96.  In\nApril 2017, he applied for DACA renewal, which was approved and valid until August 13, 2019. \nId. ¶ 97.  Using the work authorization that accompanies DACA, Gil first worked as a baker and\nthen began employment with a logistics company.  Id. ¶¶ 98–99.  He also obtained a Social\nSecurity Number and a driver’s license.  Id. ¶ 100.\nPlaintiffs assert that Gil was arrested on September 20, 2017 and charged with the\nmisdemeanor traffic offense of driving on a cancelled license, which is still pending.  Id. ¶ 101. \nWhile in ICE detention, Gil received a Notice to Appear, which charged him with being\nremovable because he was present in the United States without admission.  Id. ¶ 103.  Plaintiffs\nnote that “ICE put Mr. Gil in deportation proceedings even though Mr. Gil had been granted a\ntwo-year DACA renewal just two months before, and a minor traffic offense, like driving on a\ncancelled license, did not disqualify him from DACA.”  Id.   After being released from detention\non November 28, 2017, Gil learned that he had received another Notice of Action that\nterminated his DACA and EAD “as of the date [his] NTA was issued.”  Id. ¶¶ 107, 109. \nPlaintiffs assert that no additional notice or explanation was provided, and that Gil was not\nprovided a chance to respond.

He subsequently spent a\nmonth in ICE detention.  Id. ¶ 128.  During this time, USCIS sent him a Notice of Action\nterminating his DACA and work permit “automatically as of the date [his] NTA was issued” and\nstating that an “appeal or motion to reopen/reconsider this notice of action may not be filed.”  Id.\n¶ 129.  Plaintiffs again assert that Moreira was provided no prior notice, no additional\nexplanation, and no opportunity to respond.  Id. ¶ 130.\nv. Plaintiff Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective\nPlaintiff Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective (“IEIYC”) is “a grassroots,\nimmigrant youth-led organization located in Ontario, California.  IEIYC serves the immigrant\ncommunity in the Inland Empire region, which encompasses Riverside and San Bernardino\nCounties.”  Id. ¶ 132.  Plaintiffs state that IEIYC’s mission is\nto advocate for the needs of the undocumented immigrant community in the Inland\nEmpire, including equal access to higher education for undocumented youth, and\nto achieve justice for immigrant communities by empowering those most affected\nby immigration policy.  Since 2010, IEIYC has focused its efforts on creating a\nsafe space for undocumented youth to share resources; organizing other youth to\neducate and mobilize their peers; and advocating for regional, state, and federal\npolicies that benefit immigrant communities, including DACA recipients.\nId.  Since 2012, IEIYC has coordinated DACA workshops through which “5,000 individuals []\nreceived immigration consultation and assistance with their DACA applications,” and counts\n“[a]t least 18” DACA recipients among its members.  Id. ¶¶ 133, 135.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs\nallege that “Defendants’ unlawful termination policies and practices are likely to harm IEIYC\nDACA recipients” because they “live, work, attend school, and carry out IEIYC work\nthroughout the Inland Empire, where there is a significant CBP presence.”  Id. ¶ 135.\nB. Procedural History\nPlaintiffs IEIYC and Arreola originally filed their class action complaint on October 5,\n2017.  See Dkt. # 1.  The following month, on November 20, 2017, the Court granted Arreola’s\nmotion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining USCIS’s decision to terminate his DACA.  See\nArreola Order at 15–16.  Subsequently, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (“FAC”) on\nDecember 21, 2017, which included Plaintiffs Gil and Moreira.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 5 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 6 of 31   Page ID #:2148\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nIn their FAC, Plaintiffs assert that “Defendants have engaged in a widespread practice of\nunlawfully revoking individuals’ DACA grants and work permits, apparently based on\nunsubstantiated suspicions of criminal activity or minor criminal history, even though these\nindividuals have not violated the terms of the program and continue to be eligible for it.”  FAC\n¶ 137.  They identify “three systemic practices” that constitute this allegedly “unlawful\ntermination” of DACA grants.  Id. ¶ 157.  First, that “Defendants have a practice of revoking\nDACA grants without providing notice, a reasoned explanation, or an opportunity to be heard\nprior to revocation, and without providing a process for reinstatement where the revocation is in\nerror,” which represents an impermissible “reversal of the agency’s position”; second, that\n“Defendants have engaged in a widespread practice of automatically terminating DACA grants\nand work permits of individuals who remain eligible for DACA based on the filing of a Notice\nto Appear by immigration authorities,” which is not permitted by controlling regulations and\nmemoranda; and third, that “Defendants have targeted DACA recipients for revocation, even\nthough they have committed no disqualifying conduct.”  Id. ¶¶ 158–60.  They argue that\n“Defendants’ failure to provide DACA recipients with notice, a reasoned explanation, and an\nopportunity to be heard prior to revocation, as well as a process for reinstatement where the\nrevocation is in error, violates the Due Process Clause and the rules governing the DACA\nprogram, and is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the” Administrative\nProcedure Act (“APA”).  Id. ¶ 164.  They also contend that “Defendants’ practice of\nautomatically terminating DACA when immigration authorities file a Notice to\nAppear—including based solely on presence without admission to the United States or\noverstaying a visa—is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA.”  Id.\n¶ 165.\nPlaintiffs assert two causes of action: violation of the APA, id. ¶¶ 180–85, and violation\nof the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, id. ¶¶ 186–88.\nOn February 26, 2018, the Court issued an order in which it certified a nationwide class\nof DACA recipients “who, after January 19, 2017, have had or will have their DACA grant and\nemployment authorization revoked without notice or an opportunity to respond, even though\nthey have not been convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense.”  Class Order at 6, 21.  The\nCourt also issued a preliminary injunction that enjoined Defendants from terminating DACA\ngrants “absent a fair procedure that complies with” the DACA SOP and the Napolitano Memo. \nId. at 34–37.\nDefendants filed this motion to dismiss on February 14, 2018, arguing that Plaintiffs\nIEIYC and Arreola lack standing; that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the\nAPA and INA; and that Plaintiffs have failed to state claims under the APA and the due process\nclause.

Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nII. Legal Standard\nA. Rule 12(b)(1)\nFederal courts have limited jurisdiction and therefore only possess power authorized by\nArticle III of the United States Constitution and statutes enacted by Congress pursuant thereto. \nSee Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986).  Thus, federal courts\ncannot consider claims for which they lack subject matter jurisdiction.  See Wang ex rel. United\nStates v. FMC Corp., 975 F.2d 1412, 1415 (9th Cir. 1992).\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides for a party, by motion, to assert the\ndefense of “lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  This defense may be\nraised at any time, and the Court is obligated to address the issue sua sponte.  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(h)(1) (providing for waiver of certain defenses but excluding lack of subject matter\njurisdiction); Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Grp., L.P., 541 U.S. 567, 571 (2004) (“Challenges\nto subject-matter jurisdiction can of course be raised at any time prior to final judgment.”);\nMoore v. Maricopa Cty. Sheriff’s Office, 657 F.3d 890, 894 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The Court is\nobligated to determine sua sponte whether it has subject matter jurisdiction.”).  The plaintiff\nbears the burden of establishing that subject matter jurisdiction exists.  See United States v. Orr\nWater Ditch Co., 600 F.3d 1152, 1157 (9th Cir. 2010).  If the Court finds that it lacks subject\nmatter jurisdiction at any time, it must dismiss the action.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).\nFurthermore, the question of standing is an “essential and unchanging part of the case-or-\ncontroversy requirement of Article III.”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\n(1992).  Standing is not subject to waiver and therefore must be considered by the court\nregardless of whether or not it is raised by the parties.  See United States v. Hays, 515 U.S 737,\n742 (1995).  For each claim and each form of relief, the burden lies on the plaintiff to establish\nstanding.  See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006); Hays, 515 U.S. at 743\n(noting that the burden is on the party seeking exercise of jurisdiction to “clearly . . . allege facts\ndemonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute”).  To\nestablish standing, a party must demonstrate an “invasion of a legally protected interest” that is\n“concrete and particularized,” “actual and imminent,” and that is “fairly traceable to the\nchallenged action” and “redressable by a favorable ruling.”  Arizona State Leg. v. Arizona Indep.\nRedistricting Comm’n, 135 S. Ct. 2652, 2663 (2015).\nB. Rule 12(b)(6)\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 7 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 8 of 31   Page ID #:2150\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must “contain sufficient\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570\n(2007)).  In assessing the adequacy of the complaint, the court must accept all pleaded facts as\ntrue and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  See Turner v. City & Cty. of\nS.F., 788 F.3d 1206, 1210 (9th Cir. 2015); Cousins v. Lockyer, 568 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir.\n2009).  The court then determines whether the complaint “allows the court to draw the\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n678.  However, “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere\nconclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id.  Accordingly, “for a complaint to survive a motion to\ndismiss, the non-conclusory factual content, and reasonable inferences from that content, must\nbe plausibly suggestive of a claim entitling the plaintiff to relief.”  Moss v. U.S. Secret Serv., 572\nF.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIII. Discussion\nA. Standing\nDefendants argue that both Plaintiff IEIYC and Plaintiff Arreola lack standing to bring\nthis action.  See Mot. 6:4–8:15.  \nThe Court first notes that it need not consider these standing arguments at this time. \nDefendants do not dispute, and the Court sees no reason to question, that Plaintiffs Gil and\nMoreira have standing.  Gil and Moreira experienced revocation of their DACA statuses,\nallegedly without proper notice and procedure and therefore in violation of the APA and due\nprocess clause, which is the basis of Plaintiffs’ action.  Their injuries are therefore “fairly\ntraceable to the challenged action” and “redressable by a favorable ruling.”  Arizona State Leg.,\n135 S. Ct. at 2663.  “Because [these] individual plaintiffs have standing, we need not consider\nwhether the [other plaintiffs] ha[ve] standing.”  Laub v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 342 F.3d 1080,\n1086 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S.\n52 n. 2 (2006) (“FAIR”) (“[T]he presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy\nArticle III’s case-or-controversy requirement.”); Planned Parenthood of Idaho, Inc. v. Wasden,\n376 F.3d 908, 912 (9th Cir. 2004) (“As our jurisdiction and our duty to answer the questions\nraised here would be unaffected by the resolution of Idaho’s challenge to Planned Parenthood’s\nstanding, we decline to decide the issue.”).  Because Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs Gil\nand Moreira have standing, and because the Court concludes that they do, the standing\nrequirement is therefore satisfied and whether or not Plaintiffs Arreola and IEIYC have standing\nneed not be resolved at this time.  \nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 8 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 9 of 31   Page ID #:2151\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nHowever, the Court will nevertheless engage the standing issues on the merits.  The\nstanding of Plaintiffs IEIYC and Arreola might need to be established at some point prior to\nentry of final judgment.  See Wasden, 376 F.3d at 918 n. 6 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P 65(d)) (“[O]n\nremand, when the district court enters the appropriate injunctive relief against enforcement of the\nstatute, it may need to decide whether Planned Parenthood is a proper plaintiff.  Only a proper\nparty to an action can enforce an injunction that results from a final judgment.”).  In addition, the\nline of precedent upon which the Supreme Court relied in FAIR suggests, albeit elliptically, that\nthe standing of other parties need not be considered only if their positions are identical to the\nplaintiffs who have standing.  See FAIR, 547 U.S. at 52 n. 2 (citing Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S.\n714, 721 (1986)); Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 721 (citing Secretary of Interior v. California, 464 U.S.\n312, 319 n. 3 (1984)); California, 464 U.S. at 319 n. 3 (“Since the State of California clearly\ndoes have standing, we need not address the standing of the other respondents, whose position\nhere is identical to the State’s.”) (emphasis added).  Given these considerations, the Court\nconcludes that it is prudent to determine whether Plaintiffs IEIYC and Arreola have standing at\nthis time.\ni. Plaintiff IEIYC\nDefendants contend that IEIYC “lacks standing on its own” as well as “standing on behalf\nof its members.”  Mot. 6:5–6.\n“An organization suing on its own behalf can establish an injury when it suffered both a\ndiversion of its resources and a frustration of its mission.”  La Asociacion de Trabajadores de\nLake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, 624 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010).  Although the Court\ndetermines that Defendants’ alleged misconduct would frustrate IEIYC’s mission of assisting its\nmembers with the DACA process, see FAC ¶¶ 132–33, at no point does the organization plead\nthat this misconduct led to a diversion of its resources.  Absent clear indication that IEIYC has\nsuffered both a frustration of its mission and a diversion of its resources, the Court agrees that it\nhas not established standing on its own behalf.\nInstead, Plaintiffs argue that “IEIYC clearly has standing to sue on behalf of its members,\nwho reasonably feared, at the outset of this litigation, that their DACA would be unlawfully\nterminated as a result of the policy that this Court has enjoined.”  Opp. 7:13–15.  To establish\norganizational standing on the behalf of its members, IEIYC must demonstrate that “its members\nwould have standing to sue on their own behalf, the interests at issue are ‘germane’ to [its]\nmission, and neither the substantive claim nor the remedy sought necessitates the participation of\nany individual member of [IEIYC].”  Ocean Advocates v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 402 F.3d\n846, 861 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,\n528 U.S. 167, 169 (2000)).  Each of these requirements will be considered in turn.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 9 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 10 of 31   Page ID #:2152\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\na. Members’ Standing\nAs to the first requirement—that IEIYC’s members would themselves have\nstanding—Plaintiffs argue that the members “have standing because they plainly face imminent\ninjury: this case is about a widespread practice of unlawful DACA terminations that the\ngovernment has explicitly acknowledged and that IEIYC members may be subjected to at any\ntime.”  Opp. 7:22–25.  In short, Plaintiffs argue that IEIYC’s members can assert claims based\non speculative, future harm; unlike Arreola, Gil, and Moreira, who have had their DACA grants\nrevoked in alleged violation of the APA and due process clause, there is no indication that any of\nIEIYC’s members have actually experienced similar revocations.  Plaintiffs identify two\ncomponents of this “imminent” harm.  The first is Defendants’ “admitted . . . practice of\nautomatically terminating DACA based solely on the issuance of a Notice to Appear,” FAC\n¶ 156, as well as the allegedly systematic targeting of undocumented individuals in general and\nDACA recipients in particular.  See id. ¶ 140 (“In June 2017, Defendant Homan said, ‘If you’re\nin this country illegally, and you committed a crime by entering this country, you should be\nuncomfortable . . . .  You should look over your shoulder.’”); id. ¶ 141 (“In August 2017, ICE\nspokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez confirmed that ‘ICE does not exempt classes or categories of\nremovable aliens from potential enforcement.  All of those in violation of the immigration laws\nmay be subject to immigration arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal\nfrom the United States.’”); id. ¶ 142 (“In September 2017, the former Acting Secretary of DHS,\nElaine Duke, reportedly stated that she has never seen DHS guidance telling DACA applicants\nthat their information would not be used for immigration enforcement purposes.”).  The second\ncomponent is more specific to IEIYC and its members: that they are “particularly likely to be\nsubjected to USCIS’s policy of unlawful terminations” because of the prevalence of CBP\nactivity in the Inland Empire.  Opp. 8:12–14 (emphasis in original); see also FAC ¶ 135 (“IEIYC\nDACA recipients live, work, attend school, and carry out IEIYC work throughout the Inland\nEmpire, where there is a significant CBP presence.  For example, there are three CBP sub-\nstations in Riverside County, located in Murrieta, Temecula, and Indio, and a new Border Patrol\ncomplex is under construction in the Moreno Valley of Riverside County.”).\nPlaintiffs suggest that “[t]his evidence of a systematic practice” and the resulting fear it\ninstills in IEIYC members is sufficient to create standing.  The Court agrees.  Although the\nNinth Circuit, following the lead of the Supreme Court, has emphasized that “threatened injury\nmust be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact, and . . . [a]llegations of possible future\ninjury are not sufficient” to convey standing, Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Program v.\nU.S. Drug Enf’t Admin., 860 F.3d 1228, 1235 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l\nUSA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)) (alterations and emphases in original), it is also “well-\nestablished that, although a plaintiff ‘must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 10 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 11 of 31   Page ID #:2153\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\ninjury as a result of a statute’s operation or enforcement,’ a plaintiff ‘does not have to await the\nconsummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.’”  Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting,\n732 F.3d 1006, 1015 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442\nU.S. 289, 298 (1979)); see also Arizona Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Bayless, 320\nF.3d 1002, 1006 (9th Cir. 2003) (“[I]t is sufficient for standing purposes that the plaintiff intends\nto engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest and that there is\na credible threat that the challenged provision will be invoked against the plaintiff.”) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  The Ninth Circuit’s decision in Valle del Sol is instructive.  There, a\npastor who provided transportation and shelter to members of her congregation, including those\nwho were unauthorized aliens, feared prosecution under an Arizona law that made it unlawful to\ntransport and harbor illegal aliens.  See Valle del Sol, 732 F.3d at 1013–15.  She therefore\nalleged that she feared prosecution under the Arizona law, and the district court concluded that\nher “allegations are sufficient to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that [the law] could be\nenforced against her.”  Id. at 1015.  The Ninth Circuit agreed:\nSantiago has established a credible threat of prosecution under this statute, which\nshe challenges on constitutional grounds.  She alleges that she provides, and plans\nto continue to provide, shelter and transportation to her congregants, most of\nwhom are unauthorized aliens, on a daily basis. . . .  Because the injury alleged—a\ncredible threat of prosecution under [the Arizona law]—is clearly traceable to [the\nArizona law], and can be redressed through an injunction enjoining enforcement of\nthat provision, Santiago has standing to challenge it.\nId. at 1015–16.  Here, similarly, Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants have a practice of\nunlawfully terminating DACA grants in violation of the APA and due process clause.  Their\nalleged injury—a credible threat of unlawful revocation—is clearly traceable to Defendants’\npractices that are challenged in this suit, and can be redressed through an injunction enjoining\nthe allegedly unlawful conduct.  Therefore, the Court concludes that IEIYC members have\nsufficiently pleaded a credible fear that establishes standing to challenge Defendants’ actions. \nSee Hawaii v. Trump, 859 F.3d 741, 762 (9th Cir. 2017), vacated, 874 F.3d 1112 (9th Cir. 2017)\n(finding that a plaintiff had standing where he “understandably and reasonably fear[ed]”\nenforcement of travel ban); Georgia Latino All. for Human Rights v. Governor of Ga., 691 F.3d\n1250, 1258–59 (11th Cir. 2012) (finding standing where plaintiffs faced a “credible threat” of\nprosecution and detention).  The first standing requirement is thus satisfied.3\n3 Defendants suggest that Valle del Sol, Hawaii, and Georgia Latino Alliance are all inapposite\nbecause “to the extent those decisions address organizational standing, those findings are based\non allegations of frustration of their missions, and both opinions cite to evidence offered by the\norganizations of diversion of their resources in an effort to respond to the alleged harms.”  Reply\n9:3–7.

It is true that the automatic revocation of Arreola’s,\nGil’s, and Moreira’s DACA grants were preceded by an independent encounter with authorities. \nSee FAC ¶¶ 59–77, 101–09, 124–27.  It is also true that the Supreme Court has determined that\nstanding does not exist where the risk of future injury hinges on hypothetical contingencies.  See\nCity of L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 106 (1983); Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037,\n1041–42 (9th Cir. 1999) (characterizing Lyons as precluding standing where there is a “string of\ncontingencies necessary to produce an injury”).  However, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that\nDefendants’ argument “assumes away the central allegations in this case.”  Opp. 10:25. \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants have a practice of terminating DACA grants as to individuals\nwho lack disqualifying criminal convictions, which includes those like Arreola, Gil, and\nMoreira, who were arrested and charged with criminal acts, as well as those who were not. \nPlaintiffs do not allege that only DACA recipients who are arrested or otherwise interact with\nlaw enforcement experience automatic termination, which would make this cause analogous to\nLyons.  Instead, Plaintiffs allege that any DACA recipient might experience unlawful revocation,\nand so this case is comparable to Hodgers-Durgin.  There, the Ninth Circuit determined that\nplaintiffs had standing to challenge allegedly unlawful Border Patrol stops because the case was\n“notably different from Lyons in that plaintiffs did nothing illegal to prompt the stops by the\nBorder Patrol.”  Hodgers-Durgin, 199 F.3d at 1041; see also id. (“Given this interpretation of\nLyons by the Supreme Court, it is by no means certain that plaintiffs in this case have failed to\nassert a cognizable injury under Article III.  Unlike in Lyons, in this case it is uncontested that\nboth plaintiffs engaged in entirely innocent conduct, and there is no tenable argument that\nplaintiffs should avoid driving near the Mexican border in order to avoid another stop by the\nBorder Police.”).  Similarly, Plaintiffs here allege that even DACA recipients who are engaged\nin entirely innocent conduct may nevertheless be subjected to unlawful revocation.  Therefore,\nthe future injury alleged by IEIYC members requires neither engagement in illegal conduct nor a\nstring of contingencies necessary to produce the harm.\nb. Germaneness to Mission\nAs to the second requirement for organizational standing—that “the interests at stake are\ngermane to the organization’s purpose,” Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 181—Defendants do\nnot dispute, and the Court concludes, that the claims in this case are germane to IEIYC’s mission\nstanding because it suffered a diversion of its resources and a frustration of its mission.  See\nValle del Sol, 732 F.3d at 1018–19; Hawaii, 859 F.3d at 763–66; Georgia Latino All., 691 F.3d\nat 1259–60.  However, IEIYC is not asserting organizational standing itself, but is instead\nasserting organizational standing on behalf of its members.  Therefore, because each of these\ndecisions discussed standing for individuals like IEIYC members, they are nonetheless relevant.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 12 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 13 of 31   Page ID #:2155\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nof “advocat[ing] for the needs of the undocumented immigrant community in the Inland\nEmpire.”  FAC ¶ 132.  This second requirement is therefore satisfied.\nc. Participation of Individual Members\nLastly, “neither the claim[s] asserted nor the relief requested [can] require[] the\nparticipation of individual members” of IEIYC.  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 181.\nDefendants suggest that this requirement is not satisfied here because of “the very fact-\nspecific inquiry necessary to determine why [a member] lost his or her DACA, and whether he\nor she would be entitled to additional process before such termination,” which would require the\nmember’s participation in the lawsuit.  Mot. 6:21–24.  However, the Court previously addressed\nthese concerns when it certified the nationwide class in this action, concluding that “this is not a\ncase where rigorous, individualized inquiries are necessary.”  Class Order at 20.  That some\nindividual determinations might be required to determine whether a given IEIYC member is a\nmember of the certified class does not preclude standing.  See International Union, United Auto.,\nAerospace & Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 288 (1986) (“[T]hough\nthe unique facts of each UAW member’s claim will have to be considered by the proper state\nauthorities before any member will be able to receive the benefits allegedly due him, the UAW\ncan litigate this case without the participation of those individual claimants and still ensure that\nthe remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the association actually\ninjured.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nBecause the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that this action does not rely on the participation\nof individual IEIYC members, the third requirement is satisfied, and therefore IEIYC has\nstanding to bring this case on behalf of its members.\nii. Plaintiff Arreola\nDefendants also contend that “[b]ecause Plaintiff Arreola’s DACA and EAD were\nreinstated on November 22, 2017, pursuant to this Court’s Order, and he subsequently filed an\namended complaint on December 21, 2017, the grounds he asserted for standing in his original\ncomplaint are no longer before this Court, and he has failed to establish any injury in the\namended complaint ripe for this Court’s adjudication.”  Mot. 7:1–14.\nThis argument uncovers a curious issue within standing doctrine.  On one hand, as\nDefendants correctly note, standing is a jurisdictional issue, see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 559–60, and\nthe Supreme Court has held that “when a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then\nvoluntarily amends the complaint, courts look to the amended complaint to determine\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 13 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 14 of 31   Page ID #:2156\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

Tr., 867 F.3d 1093, 1102 (9th Cir. 2017) (“[T]he\nproper focus in determining jurisdiction are the facts existing at the time the complaint under\nconsideration was filed.”) (emphasis in original).  From this standpoint, Defendants contend that\nArreola lacks standing.  The FAC indicates that “Defendants reinstated [his] DACA grant and\nemployment authorization” pursuant to the Court’s preliminary injunction.  FAC ¶¶ 86–87. \nTherefore, Defendants conclude, he no longer has an injury “fairly traceable to the challenged\naction” and “redressable by a favorable ruling,” Arizona State Leg., 135 S. Ct. at 2663, because\nhis new DACA grant has not been terminated.  Under this analysis, Arreola would no longer\nhave standing to challenge the revocation of his DACA grant based on the facts pleaded in the\nFAC.\nThe Court notes an immediate problem with this logic and Defendants’ position: if\nstanding needed to be reassessed with the filing of every pleading, then a Court would lose\njurisdiction over a case whenever a complaint is filed following the issuance of a preliminary\ninjunction, because presumably then the justiciable controversy would have been (temporarily)\nredressed.  Final injunctive relief would therefore be impossible in cases, like this, where\npreliminary relief is granted before an amended complaint is filed.  It is likely for this reason\nthat, despite Rockwell’s dictates, courts have determined that “Article III standing is evaluated\nby considering the facts as they existed at the time of the commencement of the action,” even in\na case where defendants “challenge [a plaintiff’s] standing, based on the facts as they exist as of\nthe filing of” an amended complaint.  McFalls v. Purdue, No. 3:16-cv-2116-SI, 2018 WL\n785866, at *8 (D. Or. Feb. 8, 2018); see also Northwest Envtl. Def. Ctr. v. U.S. Army Corps of\nEng’rs, No. 3:10-cv-01129-AC, 2013 WL 1294647, at *7 (D. Or. Mar. 27, 2013) (rejecting\ndefendants’ argument that standing should be considered based on facts at the time of an\namended complaint and determining that the “inquiry [was] one of mootness, rather than\nstanding”).  This position is consistent with the general approach of orienting the standing\ninquiry at the time an action commenced.  See, e.g., Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 180 (“[W]e\nhave an obligation to assure ourselves that [plaintiff] had Article III standing at the outset of the\nlitigation.”); Barry v. Lyon, 834 F.3d 706, 714 (6th Cir. 2016) (“To uphold the constitutional\nrequirement that federal courts hear only active cases or controversies, as required by Article III,\nsection 2 of the federal constitution, a plaintiff must have a personal interest at the\ncommencement of the litigation (standing) that continues throughout the litigation (lack of\nmootness).”); Becker v. Federal Election Comm’n, 230 F.3d 381, 386 n. 3 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(rejecting the requirement that “a plaintiff . . . retain [standing] throughout the litigation”\nbecause it ignores the language in Lujan and “conflates questions of standing with questions of\nmootness: while it is true that a plaintiff must have a personal interest at stake throughout the\nlitigation of a case, such interest is to be assessed under the rubric of standing at the\ncommencement of the case, and under the rubric of mootness thereafter”).\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 14 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 15 of 31   Page ID #:2157\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nUnder this usual approach, because Arreola indisputably had standing at the time the\naction commenced, the appropriate inquiry at this time is mootness, not standing.  See Already,\nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013) (quoting Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 481 (1972))\n(“A case becomes moot—and therefore no longer a ‘Case’ or ‘Controversy’ for purposes of\nArticle III—‘when the issues presented are no longer “live” or the parties lack a legally\ncognizable interest in the outcome.’”); Jackson v. California Dep’t of Mental Health, 399 F.3d\n1069, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005) (explaining that “mootness” involves “whether, after the case had\nbeen brought, something happened to cause [plaintiff] to lose his continuing interest in the\ncase”).  Defendants bear a “heavy burden” in establishing mootness, as the Supreme Court has\nnoted that “the standard we have announced for determining whether a case has been mooted by\nthe defendant’s voluntary conduct is stringent: A case might become moot if subsequent events\nmade it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected\nto recur.”  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs\nassert, Defendants do not dispute, and the Court agrees that Defendants cannot meet this burden\nat this time.  As Plaintiffs note, “[t]he factual developments on which the government relies—the\nreinstatement of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate—are\nthe results of the government’s compliance with this Court’s preliminary injunction,” Opp.\n6:8–11, and the Ninth Circuit has emphasized that “a government agency’s moratorium that ‘by\nits terms was not permanent’ would not moot ‘an otherwise valid claim for injunctive relief.’” \nWhite v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1243 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at\n190); see also Rosemere Neighborhood Ass’n v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 581 F.3d 1169, 1173\n(9th Cir. 2009) (“[T]he mere cessation of illegal activity in response to pending litigation does\nnot moot a case, unless the party alleging mootness can show that the allegedly wrongful\nbehavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nBecause mootness and not standing is the appropriate inquiry as to Arreola at this stage of\nlitigation, and because Defendants have not demonstrated that their allegedly wrongful conduct\nwill not recur, Arreola retains a continuing interest in this action.\nFurthermore, even if the Court were to adopt Defendants’ Rockwell-inspired approach\nand conclude that standing must be reestablished with the FAC, then Arreola would nevertheless\nsatisfy Article III for the reasons that IEIYC’s members have standing.  Like the IEIYC\nmembers discussed above, Arreola possesses a credible fear of unlawful conduct; indeed, this\nconcern is illustrated in the FAC, which describes the Notice of Intent to Terminate Arreola\nreceived after the Court issued its preliminary injunction and notes that it “misstates the relevant\nfacts of Mr. Arreola’s case in numerous respects, and erroneously alleges among other things\nthat Mr. Arreola admitted to smuggling undocumented immigrants.”  FAC ¶¶ 87–89.  As\ndiscussed above, Arreola “does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to\nobtain preventive relief.”  Valle del Sol, 732 F.3d at 1015.

Either way, Arreola should not be dismissed from this action due to lack of\nstanding.\nB. Jurisdiction\ni. Section 701(a)(1)\nReview under the APA is not permissible if “statutes preclude judicial review.”  5 U.S.C.\n§ 701(a)(1).  Accordingly, Defendants argue that two sections of the INA limit the Court’s\nability to hear Plaintiffs’ APA claim.  See Mot. 9:18–13:2.\na. Section 1252(g)\nFirst, Defendants cite § 1252(g), which mandates that “no court shall have jurisdiction to\nhear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the\nAttorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against\nany alien.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  The Supreme Court has explained that § 1252(g) is “directed\nagainst a particular evil: attempts to impose judicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.” \nReno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 485 n. 9 (1999).  Defendants\nsummarize § 1252(g)’s applicability as follows: “A DACA grant is acknowledgement that DHS\nis not presently pursuing removal against an individual.  Thus, when DHS finds an individual\nhas become an enforcement priority and issues an NTA, DACA will logically terminate and such\nconsequence falls squarely within the province of section 1252(g).”  Mot. 10:17–21.\nHowever, the Court concludes that Defendants interpret § 1252(g) too broadly, as\nevidenced by the Supreme Court’s Reno decision.  There, in response to the “unexamined\nassumption that § 1252(g) covers the universe of deportation claims—that it is a ‘zipper’ clause\nthat says ‘no judicial review in deportation cases unless this section provides judicial review,’”\nthe Supreme Court opined that “what § 1252(g) says is much narrower.”  Reno, 525 U.S. at 482. \nIt concluded that “[t]he provision applies only to three discrete actions that the Attorney General\nmay take: her ‘decision or action’ to ‘commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute\nremoval orders.’”  Id. (emphases in original).  Section 1252(g) does not preclude review of\n“many other decisions or actions that may be part of the deportation process.”  Id.

Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nwith this guidance, the Ninth Circuit has narrowly construed § 1252(g), distinguishing between\nthe narrow category of actions that courts cannot review and those adjacent actions that are\nwithin their jurisdiction.  In Alcaraz v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 384 F.3d 1150\n(9th Cir. 2004), for example, the Ninth Circuit held that even a claim closely related to the\ninitiation of removal proceedings is not barred by § 1252(g), so long as it does not challenge the\ndecision to commence proceedings itself.  See id. at 1160–61.  Other Ninth Circuit decisions\nhave similarly “narrowly construed § 1252(g).”  Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 964 (9th\nCir. 2004); see also Maharaj v. Ashcroft, 295 F.3d 963, 965 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[T]he reference to\n‘execut[ing] removal orders’ appearing in that provision should be interpreted narrowly, and not\nas referring to the underlying merits of the removal decision.”); Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, 236\nF.3d 1115, 1120–21 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that § 1252(g) does not bar judicial review of\ndecisions or actions that occur during the formal adjudicatory process, because they are separate\nfrom the “decision to adjudicate”); Catholic Soc. Servs. v. Immigration & Naturalization Serv.,\n232 F.3d 1139, 1150 (9th Cir. 2000) (“[Section 1252(g)] applies only to the three specific\ndiscretionary actions mentioned in its text, not to all claims relating in any way to deportation\nproceedings.”); Sulit v. Schiltgen, 213 F.3d 449, 452–53 (9th Cir. 2000) (determining that\n§ 1252(g) did not bar the due process claims of aliens alleging that their green cards were\nimproperly seized without a hearing, that the INS failed to provide them with notice requiring\nthem to surrender for deportation, and that their counsel failed to notify them of the issuance of\nthe court’s decision).\nDefendants reference several cases from this and other circuits in which courts have\napplied § 1252(g) to various actions stemming from removal proceedings.  See Sissoko v. Rocha,\n509 F.3d 947, 948–50 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding that the district court did not have jurisdiction\nover a false arrest claim that “arose from defendant’s decision to commence expedited removal\nproceedings”); Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1160–61 (finding that § 1252(g) barred review of the\nreopening of removal proceedings); Botezatu v. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 195 F.3d\n311, 313 (7th Cir. 1999) (quoting Reno, 525 U.S. at 485) (“[T]he Supreme Court has . . .\ntreat[ed] denial of a stay of deportation as one of ‘various decisions . . . leading up to or\nconsequent upon final orders of deportation’ which was within the scope of § 1252(g).”). \nHowever, each of these cases is distinguishable from Plaintiffs’ because each stemmed directly\nfrom removal proceedings implicated by § 1252(g).  Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs challenge\nneither the issuance of NTAs nor the CBP’s decisions to commence removal proceedings,\nreview of which would indeed be barred by § 1252(g).  Instead, Plaintiffs challenge the USCIS’s\nseparate and independent decision to revoke DACA on the basis of an NTA, which is\nindependent of the limited category of decisions covered by § 1252(g).  See Ramirez Medina v.\nU.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. C17-0218RSM, 2017 WL 5176720, at *6 (W.D. Wash.

Sept. 29, 2017). \nDefendants caution that this conclusion “render[s] section 1252(g) a dead letter because any\nindividual could seek to enjoin or otherwise challenge the commencement of removal\nproceedings through this type of creative pleading.”  Mot. 10:22–11:1; see also Torres-Aguilar v.\nImmigration & Naturalization Serv., 246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[A] petitioner may\nnot create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by cloaking [a claim] in\nconstitutional garb.”).  The Court does not agree that Plaintiffs’ and the Court’s position on this\npoint constitutes a means of inventively maneuvering around § 1252(g).  Fundamentally, the\npractice that Plaintiffs are challenging under the APA—automatic revocation of DACA—is\nindependent of the decision to commence or adjudicate removal proceedings.  This construction\nis consistent with both the Ninth Circuit’s admonition that § 1252(g) it to be “narrowly\nconstrued,” Wong, 373 F.3d at 964, and the cases cited above that did not bar claims that,\nalthough related to removal proceedings, were ultimately ancillary to them.\nFurthermore, the Ninth Circuit has held that while § 1252(g) precludes review of the three\nspecified discretionary decisions, it does not bar review of legal questions relating to those\ndiscretionary decisions.  See United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(en banc) (“The district court may consider a purely legal question that does not challenge the\nAttorney General’s discretionary authority, even if the answer to that legal question—a\ndescription of the relevant law—forms the backdrop against which the Attorney General later\nwill exercise discretionary authority.”); Madu v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 470 F.3d 1362, 1368 (11th\nCir. 2006) (“While this provision bars courts from reviewing certain exercises of discretion by\nthe attorney general, it does not proscribe substantive review of the underlying legal bases for\nthose discretionary decisions and actions.”).  Here, Plaintiffs bring their legal challenges under\nthe APA and the due process clause; specifically, whether automatic revocation of DACA upon\nthe issuance of an NTA violates the APA and the due process clause.  This is the sort of purely\nlegal question that, although related to a discretionary decision, is nevertheless permitted.\nBecause Plaintiffs mount legal challenges to decisions that are not within the limited\ncategory of discretionary actions enumerated by the statute, the Court concludes that § 1252(g)\ndoes not deprive it of jurisdiction over their claims.\nb. Sections 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9)\nNext, Defendants contend that “[t]o the extent that Plaintiffs have any viable claims, the\nREAL ID Act, codified at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9), bars them from raising those\nclaims in district court, regardless of whether a final order of removal has issued.”  Mot.\n11:9–11.  \nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 18 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 19 of 31   Page ID #:2161\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nSection 1252(a)(5) requires that “a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of\nappeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review\nof an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this chapter.”  8 U.S.C.\n§ 1252(a)(5).  Section 1252(b)(9) further provides that “[j]udicial review of all questions of law\nand fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,\narising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States\nunder this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this\nsection.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  As one court characterized this statutory scheme, it was\ndesigned to “put an end to the scattershot and piecemeal nature of the review process that\npreviously had held sway in regard to removal proceedings.”  Aguilar v. U.S. Immigration &\nCustoms Enf’t, 510 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2007).  The Ninth Circuit has characterized § 1252(b)(9)\nas “a clear statutory prescription against district court review” of certain cases.  J.E.F.M. v.\nLynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1038 (9th Cir. 2016).\nDefendants’ argument proceeds as follows:\nPlaintiffs engaged in criminal conduct, DHS determined their conduct rendered\nthem enforcement priorities, DHS issued each an NTA, the respective NTA caused\neach Plaintiff’s DACA and EAD to terminate, and Plaintiffs filed this challenge. \nThere can be no doubt that DHS’s discretionary decision to issue NTAs was the\ndirect cause of Plaintiffs’ DACA terminations.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ challenges\nnecessarily arise from “action taken or proceedings brought to remove an alien,”\nfor which district courts lack jurisdiction.\nMot. 12:17–13:2.  Once again, they paint with too broad a brush and interpret the statute too\nexpansively, in particular the “arising from” language, which Defendants interpret to seemingly\ninclude all claims incidentally related to a removal proceeding.4  Although the Supreme Court\nhas explained that the purpose of § 1252(b)(9) is “to consolidate ‘judicial review’ of immigration\nproceedings into one action in the court of appeals,” it “applies only ‘[w]ith respect to review of\nan order of removal under subsection (a)(1).’”  Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v. St. Cyr,\n533 U.S. 289, 313 (2001).  Section 1252(a)(1), like § 1252(a)(5), refers to “[j]udicial review of a\nfinal removal” order.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1); see also Singh v.

Accordingly, § 1252(b)(9)\nhas built-in limits.  By channeling only those questions “arising from any action\ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien,” the statute excludes from the\n[petition for review] process any claim that does not arise from removal\nproceedings.  Accordingly, claims that are independent of or collateral to the\nremoval process do not fall within the scope of § 1252(b)(9).\nJ.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1032.\nPlaintiffs do not seek judicial review of orders of removal; indeed, as stated above, their\nchallenges are independent of any removal proceedings, and thus are not inextricably linked with\nthe removal process.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5 (“Plaintiff brings a\nprocedural challenge to termination of his DACA status, an issue independent from any removal\nproceedings.”).  It is for this reason that the Court’s citation to the Ninth Circuit’s Singh decision\nis particularly apt, despite Defendants’ assertion to the contrary.  See Mot. 12 n. 8.  In Singh, the\nplaintiff brought ineffective assistance of counsel claims through a habeas petition, which, like\nthe DACA revocation claims here, were fundamentally independent of removal proceedings; the\ncourt determined that the challenge was not tied to removal proceedings and hence § 1252(b)(9)\ndid not apply.  See Singh, 499 F.3d at 978–79.  Defendants suggest that Singh is distinguishable\nfrom this case, and point instead to Martinez v. Napolitano, 704 F.3d 620 (9th Cir. 2012), in\nwhich the Ninth Circuit determined that an APA claim that “challenge[d] the procedure and\nsubstance of an agency determination that is ‘inextricably linked’ to the order of removal . . . is\nprohibited by section 1252(a)(5).”  Id. at 623.  However, although Defendants repeatedly\ncharacterize this action as “inextricably linked” to removal proceedings, for the reasons\ndiscussed throughout this order, the Court disagrees and concludes that Plaintiffs’ claims are\nindependent of removal proceedings for purposes of the jurisdictional statutes.\nFurthermore, the Ninth Circuit has held that § 1252(b)(9) does not deprive district courts\nof jurisdiction where a claim could not have been litigated in removal proceedings and the\nnoncitizen would otherwise “have had no legal avenue to obtain judicial review of [the] claim.” \nJ.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1032; see also Mamigonian v. Biggs, 710 F.3d 936, 945 (9th Cir. 2013)\n(permitting an APA action where the immigration judge “would be without jurisdiction” to\nadjudicate the claim and so “review would be unavailable” to plaintiff).  Defendants themselves\nseem to note this limitation in their motion, writing that “if the issue is one that can be raised in\nremoval proceedings, and ultimately in a petition for review, then the statute precludes district\ncourt review.”  Mot. 12:8–10 (emphasis added).

See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL\n4340385, at *6 (“[A]n immigration judge has no jurisdiction to reinstate DACA status.”); see\nalso Napolitano Memo at 2–3 (conveying power to grant DACA to agencies); Matter of\nQuintero, 18 I. & N. Dec. 348, 350 (B.I.A. 1982) (“[N]either the immigration judge nor the\nBoard may grant [deferred action] status or review a decision of the District Director to deny\nit.”).  Therefore, Plaintiffs could not have challenged the revocation of their DACA statuses at a\nremoval proceeding, and so under Ninth Circuit precedent, jurisdiction is not barred. \nIn their reply, Defendants allude to “new authorities that give new shape to [their]\narguments for why this Court should grant the motion to dismiss,” suggesting that two recent\ndecisions “clarify and reinforce Defendants’ arguments that section 1252 bars this Court’s\njurisdiction over the claims asserted here, and instead channels those claims through the Petition\nfor Review process Congress designated.”  Reply 1:5–7, 1:11–16.  The Court does not agree\neither that these cases provide novel legal analysis or that they support Defendants’ position.\nThe first new case cited by Defendants is Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 (2018), in\nwhich the Supreme Court “interpret[ed] three provisions of U.S. immigration law that authorize\nthe Government to detain aliens in the course of immigration proceedings.”  Id. at 836.  Jennings\ndid not reframe, reconsider, or reinterpret § 1252(b)(9) or § 1252(a)(5).  It merely reiterated what\nprevious decisions have already made clear:\n[R]espondents are not asking for review of an order of removal; they are not\nchallenging the decision to detain them in the first place or to seek removal; and\nthey are not even challenging any part of the process by which their removability\nwill be determined.  Under these circumstances, § 1252(b)(9) does not present a\njurisdictional bar.\nId. at 840–41.  In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court compared § 1252(b)(9) with\n§ 1252(g), noting that both contain similar “arising from” language and thus suggesting a\nsimilarly narrow interpretation.  See id. (citing Reno, 525 U.S. at 482–83) (“We did not interpret\nthis language to sweep in any claim that can technically be said to ‘arise from’ the three listed\nactions of the Attorney General.  Instead, we read the language to refer to just those three\nspecific actions themselves.”).\nAlthough Defendants contend that “[t]here can be no serious argument here that Plaintiffs\nare not challenging a part of the process by which their removability will be determined,” Reply\n2:18–19, that is precisely the case here, and Jennings consequently supports Plaintiffs’ position. \nPlaintiffs are not challenging the decision to detain or remove them or any part of the removal\nprocess.  Instead, they are challenging the separate decision to automatically terminate DACA as\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 21 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 22 of 31   Page ID #:2164\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\na consequence of issuing an NTA.  Therefore, because that is an independent action that does not\ndirectly arise from removal proceedings, § 1252(b)(9) precludes this action no more than it did\nthe action in Jennings.\nFurthermore, the Jennings decision emphasizes why § 1252(b)(9) cannot be interpreted as\nbroadly as Defendants urge.  The plurality opinion reads in part:\n[T]he applicability of § 1252(b)(9) turns on whether the legal questions that we\nmust decide “aris[e] from” the actions taken to remove these aliens.\nIt may be argued that this is so in the sense that if those actions had never been\ntaken, the aliens would not be in custody at all.  But this expansive interpretation\nof § 1252(b)(9) would lead to staggering results.  Suppose, for example, that a\ndetained alien wishes to assert a claim under Bivens . . . based on allegedly\ninhumane conditions of confinement.  Or suppose that a detained alien brings a\nstate-law claim for assault against a guard or fellow detainee.  Or suppose that an\nalien is injured when a truck hits the bus transporting aliens to a detention facility,\nand the alien sues the driver or owner of the truck.  The “questions of law and fact”\nin all those cases could be said to “aris[e] from” actions taken to remove the aliens\nin the sense that the aliens’ injuries would never have occurred if they had not\nbeen placed in detention.  But cramming judicial review of those questions into the\nreview of final removal orders would be absurd.\nInterpreting “arising from” in this extreme way would also make claims of\nprolonged detention effectively unreviewable.  By the time a final order of\nremoval was eventually entered, the allegedly excessive detention would have\nalready taken place.  And of course, it is possible that no such order would ever be\nentered in a particular case, depriving that detainee of any meaningful chance for\njudicial review.\nId. at 840 (citation omitted).  This portion of the Supreme Court’s discussion is relevant to this\naction.  The automatic revocation of a DACA grant is, like the hypotheticals articulated above, a\nconsequence of removal that does not “aris[e] from” removal, and so it would be similarly\n“absurd” to deny Plaintiffs the opportunity to vindicate their rights under the APA and due\nprocess clause just because the decision to automatically revoke DACA upon the issuance of an\nNTA is incidentally related to the commencement of removal proceedings.  Jennings suggests\nboth that DACA revocation does not “aris[e] from” removal proceedings for purposes of\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 22 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 23 of 31   Page ID #:2165\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\n§ 1252(b)(9) and that stripping the Court of jurisdiction over this action would be an unfavorable\noutcome.5\nThe second “new authorit[y]” that purportedly “clarify[ies] and reinforce[s] Defendants’\narguments that section 1252 bars this Court’s jurisdiction over” Plaintiffs’ claims, Reply 1:5,\n1:12–15, is Castellar v. Nielsen, No. 17-cv-0491-BAS-BGS, 2018 WL 786742 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 8,\n2018), a recent district court decision.  The Court notes at the outset that a decision from the\nSouthern District is not binding and constitutes at best only persuasive authority.  See, e.g., Rush\nv. Denco Enters., Inc., No. EDCV 11-0030 DOC (DTBx), 2012 WL 3206674, at *3 (C.D. Cal.\nAug. 3, 2012) (“[D]istrict courts are not bound by the unpublished decisions of other district\ncourts; even published district court decisions are only persuasive authority.”); Kohler v. Hyatt\nCorp., No. EDCV 07-782-VAP (CWx), 2008 WL 8779743, at *7 (C.D. Cal. July 23, 2008)\n(noting that a district court is “not bound by the decisions of sister district courts”).  This limited\neffect notwithstanding, the Court concludes that Castellar presents no novel arguments or\ninterpretations of § 1252, and instead merely rearticulates the points already discussed in this\norder.  To begin, it reiterates that § 1252(g), consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in\nReno and subsequent Ninth Circuit decisions, has limited application: “These decisions reinforce\nthe principle that while a federal court cannot exercise jurisdiction over claims arising from the\ndiscrete decisions Section 1252(g) identifies, a federal court’s construction and consequent\napplication of Section 1252(g)’s jurisdictional bar must be narrow.”  Id. at *7.  It then goes on to\nanalyze §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9), the latter of which is broader than § 1252(g)—an\n“unmistakable zipper clause,” id. at *11 (quoting Reno, 525 U.S. at 483)—but nevertheless\nincludes the “built-in limit[]” that excludes “claims that are independent of or collateral to the\nremoval process.”  Castellar, 2018 WL 786742, at *12 (quoting J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1032). \nThat the Castellar court ultimately concluded that its plaintiffs’ Fourth and Fifth Amendment\nclaims were not “independent of or collateral to removal proceedings” does not alter the Court’s\nconclusion here that Plaintiffs’ challenge to automatic DACA revocation is independent of\nremoval.  Castellar, 2018 WL 786742, at *14.\n5 In his concurrence to Jennings, Justice Thomas advocates a more expansive reading of\n§ 1252(b)(9) that would generally “prohibit[] courts from reviewing aliens’ claims related to\ntheir removal.”  Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 852.  However, even this broader interpretation would\nseemingly not preclude claims, like Plaintiffs’, that are independent of removal proceedings.  See\nid. at 855 (“[M]y conclusion that § 1252(b)(9) covers an alien’s challenge to the fact of his\ndetention (an action taken in pursuit of the lawful objective of removal) says nothing about\nwhether it also covers claims about inhumane treatment, assaults, or negligently inflicted injuries\nsuffered during detention (actions that go beyond the Government’s lawful pursuit of its removal\nobjective).”) (emphases in original).  Here, Plaintiffs are not challenging the fact of removal, but\ninstead the decision to automatically revoke DACA on that basis.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 23 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 24 of 31   Page ID #:2166\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nDefendants emphasize one aspect of Castellar in particular: that it “addressed and\nrejected as ‘selective reading’ the assertion that J.E.F.M. permits challenges to be raised in the\ndistrict court ‘[w]here a plaintiff “would have no legal avenue to obtain judicial review” of his\nclaims.’”  Reply 3:22–26 (quoting Castellar, 2018 WL 786742, at *15 n. 6).  However, the Court\ndoes not endorse this “selective” interpretation of J.E.F.M.; rather, as discussed above, the key\ninquiry is not whether a plaintiff can obtain judicial review, but rather whether a claim can be\nreviewed as part of the petition for review process.  This is precisely the conclusion drawn by the\nCastellar court in reconciling J.E.F.M. with cases like Singh: “Both Nadarajah and Singh\nunderscore that when claims cannot be reviewed in a petition for review of a final order of\nremoval, they are not subject to Sections 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9).”  Castellar, 2018 WL\n786742, at *15 n. 6.  That is why the Court’s ability to hear Plaintiffs’ claims is not precluded by\n§§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9).  Because an immigration judge in a removal proceeding does not\nhave the power to grant or deny deferred action, or to review or reverse an agency’s decision to\nrevoke it, see Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *6, this case, by Castellar’s formulation,\nis not subject to these sections.\nIn summation, the two “new” authorities on which Defendants rely in their reply paper do\nnot alter the Court’s analysis or its conclusion.  Because Plaintiffs here are not challenging\nremoval proceedings, and because their claims could not have been brought in removal\nproceedings, §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) do not apply and do not deprive this Court of\njurisdiction.\nii. Section 701(a)(2)\nDefendants also contend that another provision of the APA, § 701(a)(2), deprives the\nCourt of subject matter jurisdiction.  See Mot. 13:3–15:14.\nAlthough the APA permits judicial review of agency actions where “there is no other\nadequate remedy in a court,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, it also precludes review of agency decisions that\nare “committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); see also Lincoln v. Vigil,\n508 U.S. 182, 191–92 (1993).  Defendants note that the Supreme Court has held that “an\nagency’s decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed immune from judicial\nreview under § 701(a)(2).”  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985).  Similarly, the\nSupreme Court has also held that “the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial\nreview.”  Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607 (1985).  Deferred action in the immigration\ncontext is “discretionary and reversible.”  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nThus, Defendants conclude that “[i]ndividual DACA terminations, especially where based on\nissuance of NTAs, fall squarely within that category of agency discretion for which judicial\nreview is improper.”  Mot. 14:22–24.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 24 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 25 of 31   Page ID #:2167\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nThe Court disagrees.  The jurisdictional bar cited by Defendants applies only where there\nis “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Mendez-\nGutierrez v. Ashcroft, 340 F.3d 865, 868 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830).  By\ncontrast, a court can review an agency decision when, like here, there are “statutes, regulations,\nestablished agency policies, or judicial decisions that provide a meaningful standard against\nwhich to assess” an agency’s action.  Mendez-Gutierrez, 340 F.3d at 868; see also ASSE Int’l,\nInc. v. Kerry, 803 F.3d 1059, 1069 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Spencer Enters., Inc. v. United\nStates, 345 F.3d 683, 688 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. Immigration & Naturalization\nServ., 208 F.3d 838, 844 (9th Cir. 2000)) (“Even where statutory language grants an agency\n‘unfettered discretion,’ its decision may nonetheless be reviewed if regulations or agency\npractice provide a ‘meaningful standard by which this court may review its exercise of\ndiscretion.’”).\nHere, the decision to revoke DACA is governed by both the Napolitano Memo and the\nDACA SOP, and the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly found that APA jurisdiction exists where\n“discretion has been legally circumscribed by various memoranda.”  Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1161;\nsee also Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v. United States, 648 F.3d 708, 719 (9th Cir. 2011) (looking to an\nagency’s interim certification standards to “supply the standard against which we can judge the\nagency’s decision-making”); Mendez-Gutierrez, 340 F.3d at 868 (noting that the absence of a\nspecific statute or regulation “does not . . . mean that there are no meaningful standards against\nwhich to evaluate” an agency’s decision where other rules and regulations apply).  Other courts\nthat have similarly examined the Napolitano Memo and the DACA SOP have also concluded\nthat they contain the sort of detailed policy directives that provide courts with the standards\nneeded to review DACA revocation.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5 (citing\nUnited States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at\n1162) (“Defendants’ failure to follow the termination procedures set forth in the DACA SOP is\narbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.”); Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1340\n(“Defendants’ argument that § 701(a) of the APA bars this Court from reviewing an agency’s\nnon-discretionary review process fails.”); see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 170 (5th\nCir. 2015) (determining that the “grant of lawful presence and accompanying eligibility for\nbenefits is a substantive rule”).\nAs the Court continues to emphasize, Plaintiffs challenge the decision to automatically\nterminate DACA on the basis of the issuance of an NTA, not enforcement decisions.  Because\nDACA eligibility and revocation are governed by existing regulations, the Court has a\nmeaningful standard with which to scrutinize the revocation decision, and so judicial review is\nnot barred by § 701(a)(2).  See Ramirez Medina, 2017 WL 5176720, at *8 (“Defendants’ alleged\nfailure to follow the procedures detailed in the DACA SOP does not implicate agency discretion. \nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 25 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 26 of 31   Page ID #:2168\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nTherefore, the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of . . . § 701(a) are not applicable to prevent this\nCourt from determining whether Defendants complied with their non-discretionary\nprocedures.”).\nC. APA Claim\nBecause the Court concludes that it has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims, it will now\nconsider whether they have pleaded viable causes of action under the APA and due process\nclause.\nUnder the APA, “agency action must be based on non-arbitrary, ‘relevant factors.’” \nJudulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 55 (2011) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v.\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983)).  The “courts retain a role, and an\nimportant one, in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.”  Judulang,\n565 U.S. at 53.  “When reviewing an agency action, [the Court] must assess, among other\nmatters, ‘whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether\nthere has been a clear error of judgment.’”  Id. (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).\nDefendants argue that automatic DACA termination due to the issuance of an NTA is not\nimpermissibly arbitrary because it is provided for in the DACA SOP and other DHS regulations. \nSee Mot. 19:11–21:8.  The Court disagrees with this assertion for several reasons.  First, based\non the Napolitano Memo and the DACA SOP, a noncitizen’s deportability due to unauthorized\npresence in the United States—the basis for the NTAs at issue here—provides no relevant basis\nfor terminating DACA.  These guidelines enumerate the relevant considerations for a DACA\ngrant, and not only is unauthorized presence an unmentioned factor, but the program was\nspecifically designed for persons without lawful immigration status.  See, e.g., DACA SOC at 44\n(indicating that an individual “may be favorably considered for DACA if” he/she “[e]ntered\nwithout inspection” or his/her “lawful immigration status expired”).  The program’s rules also\nmake clear that even noncitizens who are, have been, or will be placed in removal proceedings\nare nonetheless eligible for DACA.  See Napolitano Memo at 2; DACA SOP at 71 (“Individuals\nin removal proceedings may file a DACA request.”).  The same is true for individuals with final\nremoval orders, and even individuals who have “reenter[ed] the United States illegally after\nhaving been removed or after leaving voluntarily under an order of removal.”  DACA SOP at\n74–75.  \nFurthermore, if an NTA is issued against an applicant while her application is pending\nwith USCIS—even if the NTA is based on a public safety concern—DACA can still be\nconferred on the applicant.  See DACA SOP at 93.  In such cases, USCIS is required to review all\nrelevant circumstances, and may still grant a DACA request despite an NTA “[i]f a DACA\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 26 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 27 of 31   Page ID #:2169\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

For example, as the Court\npreviously observed in its order granting Arreola’s motion for a preliminary injunction,\nautomatic termination based on the issuance of an NTA is appropriate “when an NTA is issued\nafter USCIS determines that a disqualifying offense or public safety concern is deemed to be\n‘Egregious Public Safety’ [“EPS”].”  Arreola Order at 11 (citing DACA SOP at 137). \nOtherwise, “‘unless there are criminal, national security, or public safety concerns,’ the DACA\ntermination guidelines prescribe the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Terminate and require that\n‘[t]he individual should be allowed 33 days to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds\ncited.’”  Arreola Order at 11 (quoting DACA SOP at 137–38) (alteration in original); see also\nGonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *3 (“[E]xcept in EPS cases, the DACA SOP requires\nnotice and an ability to contest the [Notice of Termination] before DACA status may be\nterminated.”).  In addition, DACA can also terminate automatically if a DACA recipient travels\noutside the United States without first receiving advance parole.  See DACA SOP, App. I at 2.\nHowever, Defendants point to no provision in the DACA SOP that permits automatic\ntermination as a result of an NTA based solely on unauthorized presence, which is the issue in\nthis action.  Instead, they discuss ICE’s and CBP’s authority to issue NTAs, see\nMot.19:17–20:12, and note that “there is no provision permitting USCIS to reverse ICE’s\ndecision,” id. 20:8–9, but such assertions are not relevant—the issue is not how or when DHS or\nits component agencies can issue NTAs, but instead whether USCIS can terminate DACA\nautomatically solely on that basis.6  The Court maintains that it cannot.  Although an NTA filed\non the basis of an EPS designation can result in automatic DACA termination, see DACA SOP at\n137, “if the disqualifying criminal offense is non-EPS” then “[t]he individual should be allowed\n33 days to file a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited in the Notice of Intent to\nTerminate.”  Id.; see also Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *6 (noting that NTAs based on\nan EPS designation and NTAs based on unauthorized presence “are not fungible, or ‘flip sides of\nthe same coin’”).  Defendants contend that “it takes a particularly strained reading of the\n6 Defendants argue that the Court’s conclusion “relies on a starkly oversimplified consideration\nof the NTA decision process,” and provide additional information as to how NTAs are issued. \nMot. 21:10–23:4.  Again, neither Plaintiffs nor the Court suggest that the NTA process itself is\narbitrary or capricious, but instead that the decision to automatically terminate DACA solely on\nthe basis of an NTA is inconsistent with the applicable guidelines and regulations.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 27 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 28 of 31   Page ID #:2170\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

Despite their insistence, the Court disagrees.7\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that automatic revocation on the basis of an NTA is not\npermitted by the applicable regulations.  Given that the issuance of an NTA against a DACA\napplicant, or even the issuance of a final order of removal against a DACA applicant, does not\nrender the individual ineligible for the program, Defendants’ practice of automatically\nterminating DACA on this basis is consequently arbitrary and irrational, and Plaintiffs have\ntherefore stated a viable APA claim.\nD. Due Process Claim\nLastly, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot state a viable due process claim because\nthey “necessarily lack a protected constitutional interest in their DACA and in the process to\nterminate DACA because the ultimate result sought—deferred action—is discretionary, and\nbecause the Government never expressed a mutual intention to confer a protected benefit in\nDACA.”  Mot. 15:18–21.  \nAs Defendants observe, “[t]he procedural component of the Due Process Clause does not\nprotect everything that might be described as a ‘benefit’: ‘To have a property interest in a\nbenefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire’ and ‘more than a\nunilateral expectation of it.  He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.’” \nTown of Castle Rock v. Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005) (quoting Board of Regents of State\nColls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)).  “A person’s belief of entitlement to a government\nbenefit, no matter how sincerely or reasonably held, does not create a property right if that belief\nis not mutually held by the government.  The Supreme Court has explained, ‘[a] constitutional\nentitlement cannot be created—as if by estoppel—merely because a wholly and expressly\ndiscretionary state privilege has been granted generously in the past.’”  Gerhart v. Lake Cty.,\nMont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020–21 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Connecticut Bd. of Pardons v.\nDumschat, 452 U.S. 458, 465 (1981)) (emphasis and alteration in original).  Using these\nprinciples as a foundation, Defendants conclude that “Plaintiffs possess no lawful status, thus no\nprotected interest in living or working in the United States,” and “[b]ecause DACA is\n7 Defendants suggest that “the Court’s . . . interpretation of Defendants’ guidance creates an\nabsurd scenario in which ICE would institute new administrative removal proceedings against an\nindividual while that individual seeks additional separate legal process regarding the termination\nof their DACA.”  Mot. 20:19–22.  The Court disagrees that such a result would be absurd, for the\nreason emphasized at length throughout this order: because the decision to initiate removal\nproceedings is separate from and independent of the decision to revoke DACA.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 28 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 29 of 31   Page ID #:2171\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\ndiscretionary, it does not give rise to a protected right to work in the United States.”  Mot.\n16:27–17:3.\nHowever, both this analysis and the conclusion Defendants reach mischaracterize the\npremise of Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim.  It is true, as Defendants argue and the cases\nthey cite support, that discretionary benefits generally do not give rise to a protected property\ninterest.  However, Plaintiffs instead argue that “even absent a claim of entitlement to an\nimportant benefit, once it is conferred, recipients have a protected property interest that requires\na fair process before the government may take that benefit away.”  Opp. 14:8–11 (emphasis in\noriginal).  This is consistent with a line of cases involving the conferral of benefits that do not\nconstitute entitlements of substantive rights.  See, e.g., Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971)\n(“Once [driver’s] licenses are issued . . . their continued possession may become essential in the\npursuit of a livelihood.  Suspension of issued licenses thus involves state action that adjudicates\nimportant interests of the licensees.  In such cases the licenses are not to be taken away without\n[] procedural due process.”); Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972) (“The liberty of a\nparolee enables him to do a wide range of things open to persons who have never been convicted\nof any crime. . . .  The parolee has relied on at least an implicit promise that parole will be\nrevoked only if he fails to live up to the parole conditions. . . .  Its termination calls for some\norderly process, however informal.”); Nnebe v. Daus, 644 F.3d 147, 158 (2d Cir. 2011)\n(recognizing that “a taxi driver has a protected interest in his license” that requires due process\nbefore suspension); Singh v. Bardini, No. C-09-3382 EMC, 2010 WL 308807, at *7 (N.D. Cal.\nJan. 19, 2010) (“Even if there is no constitutional right to be granted asylum, that does not\nnecessarily mean that, once granted, asylum status can be taken away without any due process\nprotections.”) (citation omitted).  This requirement of due process is especially pronounced in\ncases where, as here, the conferred benefit engenders substantial reliance.  See, e.g., Mathews v.\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 348–49 (1976) (“The essence of due process is the requirement that a\nperson in jeopardy of serious loss (be given) notice of the case against him and opportunity to\nmeet it.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. City of Long Beach, 951\nF.2d 977, 986 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting Bell, 402 U.S. at 539) (“A license [permitting flight\nallocations], which is not the subject of an absolute entitlement but which nevertheless becomes\n‘essential in pursuit of a livelihood,’ is ‘not to be taken away without that procedural due process\nrequired by the fourteenth amendment.’”); Jones v. City of Modesto, 408 F. Supp. 2d 935,\n950–51 (E.D. Cal. 2005) (“Courts have long recognized that licenses which enable one to pursue\na profession or earn a livelihood are protected property interests for purposes of a Fourteenth\nAmendment analysis.”).  In short, the fact that there is “no substantive due process right to stay\nin the United States,” Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2003), does not necessarily\nmean that a DACA recipient is entitled to no process before deferred action is terminated.\nDetermining the procedure necessary to satisfy procedural due process requirements\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 29 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 30 of 31   Page ID #:2172\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\ninvolves evaluation of three distinct factors:\nFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk\nof an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the\nprobable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and\nfinally, the Government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal\nand administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement\nwould entail.\nMathews, 424 U.S. at 335.  Consideration of these factors confirms that Plaintiffs have pleaded a\nplausible due process claim.  First, Plaintiffs’ FAC demonstrates the significant private interests\nat stake for DACA recipients, and the deleterious effects of DACA termination.  See, e.g., FAC\n¶¶ 35–39, 83–84, 111, 131.  Second, the practice of automatic termination—which, as discussed\nabove, is in contravention of internal guidelines and regulations—creates an unacceptably high\nrisk of erroneous deprivation.  As one court reasoned in the analogous context of asylum\nrescission,\n[T]here is a substantial risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures\nutilized by [the agency] in rescinding asylum via a mailed letter.  This manner of\ntermination does not account for anything other than post hac notice to the asylee\nthat he or she is no longer entitled to any protection.  This method does not\naccount for any errors in transmission, even minor typographical mistakes. \nFurthermore, there is a great deal of value that is added when the government\ncomplies, or comes close to complying, with the dictates of [applicable\nregulations].\nSingh v. Vasquez, No. CV-08-1901-PHX-MHM, 2009 WL 3219266, at *5 (D. Ariz. Sept. 30,\n2009).  Lastly, Plaintiffs’ experiences as described in the FAC demonstrate the value of “an\nopportunity to contest the [] determination at a meaningful time,” Villa-Anguiano v. Holder, 727\nF.3d 873, 882 (9th Cir. 2013), as their arrests and detentions generated confusion and uncertainty\nthat might have been resolved through the proper process.  See, e.g., FAC ¶ 76 (noting that the\nimmigration judge in Arreola’s case questioned the conclusions of the CBP agents who arrested\nhim); id. ¶¶ 110, 130 (noting that Gil and Moreira did not have the opportunities to contest the\ngrounds for DACA termination).8  Accordingly, the three Mathews factors indicate that Plaintiffs\n8 The Court agrees with an argument advanced by Plaintiffs in an earlier motion: “The fact that\nDHS’ rules already provide for [] basic pre-deprivation protections in most circumstances\nreinforces both that the value of such safeguards is high, and that providing such limited process\nwould not place undue fiscal or administrative burdens on the government.”  See Dkt. # 40-1, at\n19.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 30 of 31\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 79   Filed 04/19/18   Page 31 of 31   Page ID #:2173\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date April 19, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nhave plausibly pleaded that a DACA grant is the sort of benefit that, once conferred, entitles a\nrecipient to due process before revocation.  See Vasquez, 2009 WL 3219266, at *6 (“To\nconclude, all of the Mathews factors weigh in favor of a finding that due process requires more\nthan sending an after the fact letter of rescission when the government terminates a grant of\nasylum.”).9\nDefendants argue that, because there is no substantive right to remain in the United States\nor receive deferred action, Plaintiffs’ due process claim must necessarily fail.  However, because\nPlaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that the grant of DACA constitutes a conferred benefit\nthat requires procedural safeguards before it can be terminated, the Court concludes that the due\nprocess claim should not be dismissed on this basis.\nV. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion to dismiss.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n9 Defendants also suggest that Plaintiffs have no property interest in their EADs because “every\nindividual with employment authorization based on 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c), including those with\ndeferred action, is subject to automatic termination of their EAD upon institution of removal\nproceedings in an immigration court.”  Mot. 17:24–26.  However, although the regulations do\nprovide for termination of work authorization when an NTA is issued in some cases, see 8\nC.F.R. § 274a.14(1)(ii), it also contains an exception for work permits granted to, among others,\n“alien[s] who [have] been granted deferred action.” 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14); see also Alfaro-\nOrellana v. Ilchert, 720 F. Supp. 792, 794 (N.D. Cal. 1989) (noting that § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii) “is\nitself ambiguous, because it creates an exception for appropriate work authorizations under\n§ 274a.12(c)”).\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 31 of 31",

President Trump has said that “dreamers should rest easy,”1 yet his \n3  administration has placed these young immigrants, who came to the United States as \n4  children, directly at risk. Since 2012, the federal government’s Deferred Action for \n5  Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program has provided temporary protection from \n6  deportation (known as “deferred action”) and authorization to work in the United \n7  States for nearly 800,000 young immigrants.2 Now, not only is President Trump \n8  sunsetting the protections provided to these immigrant youth under DACA, but his \n9  Administration is eroding the strength of those protections even while the program \n10  winds down. On his watch, federal immigration authorities have targeted numerous \n11  DACA recipients and unlawfully revoked the grants of deferred action and work \n12  permits they have received, without any notice or opportunity to be heard, even \n13  though these individuals have abided by all the program rules and have not engaged in \n14  any conduct that would disqualify them from the program. This lawsuit challenges \n15  these unlawful revocation practices. \n16  2.  For over half a decade, the DACA program has provided permission to live and \n17  work in the United States for these young people who have known no other country as \n18  home. The DACA program has allowed these talented young immigrants to come out \n19  of the shadows, obtain higher education, begin their careers, and contribute more fully \n20  to their communities. To establish eligibility for the program, DACA recipients must \n21  undergo extensive background checks, in addition to meeting multiple other stringent \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n1 Transcript of AP Interview with President Trump, Associated Press, Apr. 23, \n24  2017, https://apnews.com/c810d7de280a47e88848b0ac74690c83. \n2 See U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., Number of I-821D, Consideration of \n25 \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals by Fiscal Year, Quarter, Intake, Biometrics \n26  and Case Status: Fiscal Year 2012-2017 (June 30, 2017), \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studie\n27 \ns/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca_performance\n28  data_fy2017_qtr3.pdf. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 4 of 36   Page ID #:4\n1  criteria. Noncitizens granted DACA are eligible to receive employment authorization \n2  and a Social Security Number.3 \n3  3.  As former President Obama explained when first announcing the DACA \n4  program, these young people “are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every \n5  single way but one: on paper.”4 President Obama recognized that “it makes no sense” \n6  to deport these “young people who study in our schools, . . . play in our \n7  neighborhoods, [are] friends with our kids, [and] pledge allegiance to our flag.”5   \n8  4.  Despite the critically important interests at stake once an individual has \n9  received a grant of DACA, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has a \n10  practice of unlawfully and arbitrarily revoking DACA grants and work authorization \n11  based (apparently) on alleged conduct or minor criminal history that does not \n12  disqualify the individual from the program—including mere arrests or charges that are \n13  later resolved in the individual’s favor. DHS terminates DACA in such cases without \n14  any advance notice, any chance to be heard, or any opportunity for reinstatement once \n15  the individual is cleared. As a result, many young noncitizens who grew up in this \n16  country have had their permission to remain and ability to work stripped away from \n17  them, instantaneously losing their ability to support themselves and their families, \n18  even though they have done nothing to change their eligibility for DACA. \n19  5.  Because of the government’s unlawful practices, other young immigrants across \n20  the country are at likewise at risk of wrongfully losing their DACA protections. \n21 \n                                           \n22  3 See Frequently Asked Questions, DHS DACA FAQs, U.S. Citizenship & \nImmigration Servs., https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-\n23 \naction-childhood-arrivals-process/frequently-asked-questions \n24  [https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-questions] (hereinafter “USCIS \nDACA FAQs”). \n25 \n4 President Barack Obama, Remarks on Immigration Reform and Exchange with \n26  Reporters, 2012 DAILY COMP.

Plaintiff Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective (“IEIYC”) is a grassroots \n2  organization based in Ontario, California, that serves the immigrant community in the \n3  Inland Empire region by engaging in outreach and advocacy. IEIYC has multiple \n4  members whose lives have been changed by DACA, which has made it possible for \n5  them to pursue their education and careers, contribute to their communities, and \n6  achieve economic stability. Like hundreds of thousands of other immigrants, IEIYC’s \n7  members have relied on the promises made by the federal government in the DACA \n8  program. However, because of the government’s arbitrary revocation practices, \n9  IEIYC’s members fear that their DACA grants and work permits could be terminated \n10  without notice or process. \n11  7.  Plaintiff Jesús Alonso Arreola Robles is a 23-year-old resident of the Los \n12  Angeles area whose DACA grant and work permit was terminated without any \n13  process. He has known the United States as his only home since he was just one year \n14  old. DHS found him eligible for and granted him DACA in 2012, 2014, and again in \n15  2016. At the time that DHS terminated his DACA, Mr. Arreola was working two jobs \n16  to help support his family—one as a cook at the famed Chateau Marmont in West \n17  Hollywood, and one as a driver for Uber and Lyft. Mr. Arreola’s earnings helped \n18  support his parents, both of whom are lawful permanent residents, and his three U.S. \n19  citizen sisters—one of whom has significant disabilities. \n20  8.  Despite his valid DACA grant and lack of any criminal history, federal \n21  immigration authorities arrested Mr. Arreola in February 2017 while he was driving a \n22  customer; falsely alleged that he was trying to help his customer smuggle people into \n23  the United States; and placed him in removal proceedings. Even though an \n24  immigration judge promptly rejected the smuggling allegation, and he was never \n25  charged with any crime, DHS nonetheless revoked his DACA grant and employment \n26  authorization. \n27  9.  Mr. Arreola is just one of many young immigrants who have had their DACA \n28  abruptly and unlawfully cut off.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 6 of 36   Page ID #:6\n1  10.  The government’s practice of terminating DACA without process, apparently \n2  based on unsubstantiated allegations or minor criminal history, even though the \n3  individual has never engaged in any disqualifying conduct, violates the federal \n4  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \n5  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. IEIYC and Mr. Arreola, on behalf of himself \n6  and a nationwide class of others similarly situated, respectfully request that this Court: \n7  declare the government’s revocation practices unlawful; order that the government \n8  vacate and enjoin the revocation of Mr. Arreola’s DACA grant and employment \n9  authorization, as well as those of class members who have suffered unlawful \n10  revocation or, in the alternative, temporarily reinstate their DACA grants and \n11  employment authorization pending the provision of a fair procedure to challenge the \n12  termination of their DACA grants consistent with the APA and Due Process Clause; \n13  order the government to accept renewal applications from Mr. Arreola and class \n14  members; and enjoin the government from revoking DACA grants and work \n15  authorization pursuant to its unlawful policies and practices in the future. \n16  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17  11.

On June 15, 2012, then-DHS Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano \n4  issued a memorandum establishing the DACA program (the “2012 DACA \n5  Memorandum”).6 Under the DACA framework, individuals who were brought to the \n6  United States as children and meet certain specific criteria may request deferred action \n7  for a renewable period of two years. In exchange, DACA applicants are required to \n8  provide the government with highly sensitive personal information, submit to a \n9  rigorous background check, and pay a considerable fee.  \n10  25.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum explained that DACA covers “certain young \n11  people who were brought to this country as children and know only this country as \n12  home” and that the immigration laws are not “designed to remove productive young \n13  people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language.”7 \n14  26.  The 2012 DACA Memorandum established the following criteria for \n15  individuals to be eligible for DACA. The applicant must: \n16    have come to the United States before the age of sixteen;  \n17    have resided continuously in the United States for at least five years preceding \n18  the date of the memorandum and been present in the United States on the date \n19  of the memorandum;  \n20    be currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a \n21  general education development certificate, or be an honorably discharged \n22  veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States;  \n23 \n24                                             \n6 Memorandum from Secretary Janet Napolitano, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion \n25 \nwith Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children (June 15, \n26  2012), https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-\nindividuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf (hereinafter “2012 DACA \n27 \nMemorandum”). \n28  7 Id. \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 10 of 36   Page ID #:10\n1    have not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, \n2  or multiple misdemeanor offenses;  \n3    not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety; and  \n4    not be above the age of thirty as of June 15, 2012.8  \n5  27.  USCIS describes DACA as a form of deferred action, “a discretionary \n6  determination to defer a removal action of an individual as an act of prosecutorial \n7  discretion . . . . An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS \n8  to be present in the United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be lawfully \n9  present during the period deferred action is in effect.”9  \n10  28.  Because of the possibility that many DACA-eligible individuals might be \n11  reluctant to voluntarily disclose information that could help facilitate their removal \n12  from the United States, DHS repeatedly promised applicants that the information they \n13  provided as part of the DACA application process would “not later be used for \n14  immigration enforcement purposes.”10 \n15  29.  To apply for DACA, applicants must submit extensive documentation \n16  establishing that they meet the above-mentioned criteria.11  \n17  30.  Applicants must submit a Form I-765 Application for Employment \n18  Authorization, and pay hundreds of dollars in fees.12 If work authorization is granted, \n19  DACA recipients are issued federal employment authorization documents (“EADs”), \n20  and can apply for a Social Security Number.   \n21  31.  DACA applicants must also undergo biometric and biographic background \n22  checks. When conducting these checks, DHS reviews the applicant’s biometric and \n23 \n                                           \n24  8 Id. \n9 USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 1.   \n25 \n10 Letter from Secretary Jeh Charles Johnson to Rep. Judy Chu (Dec. 30, 2016), \n26  https://chu.house.gov/sites/chu.house.gov/files/documents/DHS.Signed%20Response\n%20to%20Chu%2012.30.16.pdf. \n27 \n11 USCIS DACA FAQs, Questions 28–41. \n28  12 USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 7.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 11 of 36   Page ID #:11\n1  biographic information “against a variety of databases maintained by DHS and other \n2  federal government agencies.”13 If any information “indicates that [the applicant’s] \n3  presence in the United States threatens public safety or national security,” the \n4  applicant will be ineligible for DACA absent “exceptional circumstances.”14 Under \n5  the DACA program, deferred action is available for a period of two years, subject to \n6  renewal.  \n7  32.  A decision to grant or deny a DACA application or renewal is separate and \n8  independent from any removal proceedings in immigration court. A noncitizen who is \n9  in removal proceedings can apply for DACA separately and simultaneously.15 If that \n10  application is granted, the removal proceedings continue unless the immigration judge \n11  closes or terminates the proceedings. Further, an immigration judge has no power to \n12  grant or deny DACA, or to review or reverse USCIS’ decision to deny DACA. \n13  33.  DACA recipients are eligible to receive certain benefits. These include Social \n14  Security, retirement, and disability benefits, and, in certain states, benefits such as \n15  driver’s licenses or unemployment insurance.16 \n16  34.  DACA also confers other advantages. For example, DACA recipients do not \n17  accrue unlawful presence under Section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) of the Immigration and \n18  Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i), which could otherwise bar an \n19  individual from adjusting to lawful permanent resident status in the future.17 \n20  35.  The DACA program has been a huge success, allowing nearly 800,000 young \n21  people to go to school, advance in their careers, and serve their communities. In \n22  California alone, over 220,000 young people have benefitted from DACA. \n23 \n24 \n                                           \n25 \n13 USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 23. \n26  14 USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 65. \n15 2012 DACA Memorandum at 2. \n27 \n16 See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b)(2)–(3), 1621(d). \n28  17 USCIS DACA FAQs, Question 5.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 12 of 36   Page ID #:12\n1  36.  DACA’s benefits to young immigrants and the U.S. economy have been \n2  remarkable, as reported by a recent survey of DACA recipients.18 According to the \n3  survey: \n \n4 \n  91 percent of respondents were employed, including at top Fortune 500 \n5  companies such as Walmart, Apple, General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan \nChase, Home Depot, and Wells Fargo.  \n6   \n  The average hourly wage of respondents increased by 69 percent since \n7 \nreceiving DACA; 69 percent of survey respondents responded that their \n8 \nincreased earnings had “helped me become financially independent” and 71 \npercent responded that their increased earnings had “helped my family \n9 \nfinancially.” These higher wages increased tax revenues and economic growth \n10 \nat the local, state, and federal levels.  \n \n11 \n  16 percent of respondents purchased their first home after receiving DACA, \n12  leading to broader positive economic effects such as job creation and the \ninfusion of new spending in local economies.  \n13 \n \n14    94 percent reported that, because of DACA, they were able to pursue \neducational opportunities they could not have pursued otherwise.  \n15 \nAnother study found that, altogether, DACA recipients stood to contribute more than \n16 \n$460 billion to the gross domestic product over the next ten years.19 \n17 \n37.  Not only has the program resulted in huge benefits to the American economy, \n18 \nbut in addition, more than 86 percent of Americans support allowing DACA recipients \n19 \nto remain in the United States.20 \n20 \n                                           \n21 \n18 Tom K.

After President Trump took office, his Administration continued the DACA \n2  program for more than seven months. From January to September 2017, USCIS \n3  continued to process and grant more than 250,000 new DACA applications and \n4  applications for renewals. \n5  The Rescission of the DACA Program \n6  39.  Notwithstanding the success of the DACA program and the public’s \n7  overwhelming support for it, DHS announced on September 5, 2017, that it was \n8  rescinding the DACA program and winding it down. \n9  40.  Current DACA recipients will maintain their deferred action grants and work \n10  permits until they expire. DHS will not consider new applications for DACA dated \n11  after September 5, 2017. In addition, certain individuals are eligible for two-year \n12  renewals. Individuals with a DACA grant expiring between September 5, 2017, and \n13  March 5, 2018, can apply for a two-year renewal if the application is received by \n14  October 5, 2017. Individuals whose DACA expires on or after March 6, 2018 will not \n15  have an opportunity to renew.21 \n16  41.  All DACA grants are expected to expire by the spring of 2020. In the \n17  meantime, hundreds of thousands of young immigrants will continue to benefit from \n18  grants of DACA and work authorization for varying lengths of time as the program \n19  winds down. \n20  42.  Although the program is sunsetting, the Administration has confirmed on \n21  September 8, via Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, that “[d]uring this six-\n22  month time, there are no changes that are being made to the program at this point.”22 \n                                                                                                                                             \n23 \nstrong-support-for-dreamers/2017/09/24/df3c885c-a16f-11e7-b14f-\n24  f41773cd5a14_story.html?utm_term=.cea6f0719cc6. \n21 Memorandum from Acting Secretary Elaine C.

Mr. Arreola was born in Mexico in May of 1994 and was brought to the United \n4  States by his parents in 1995, when he was only one year old. They entered without \n5  being inspected at a border crossing. He has lived in the United States continuously \n6  since his arrival—indeed, this country is the only place he can call home. \n7  44.  Mr. Arreola attended and graduated from Los Angeles-area schools. He \n8  graduated from Lankershim Elementary School in 2005, Walter Reed Middle School \n9  in 2008, and East Valley High School in 2012. Mr. Arreola also attended a year of \n10  college at Glendale Community College, but could not continue his studies as he had \n11  to work full-time to help financially support his family. \n12  45.  In addition to his parents, Mr. Arreola has three younger sisters, who are all \n13  U.S. citizens by birth. His oldest sister is seventeen years old. Since birth, she has had \n14  progeria, autism, Down’s syndrome, and diabetes, and requires special care, around \n15  the clock, from her family members.   \n16  46.  Mr. Arreola has played a critical role in caring for his sister, including checking \n17  her blood; giving her insulin shots; helping her move around the house; and driving \n18  her to the hospital when she needs medical care. He also does everything he can to \n19  help her feel “normal,” comfortable, and loved.  \n20  47.  Although Mr. Arreola’s parents entered the United States without inspection, \n21  they now have lawful permanent resident status, having obtained immigration relief in \n22  the form of cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b). \n23  48.  Mr. Arreola is the only member of his family without permanent lawful \n24  immigration status in the United States. \n25 \n26 \n                                                                                                                                             \n27 \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/08/press-briefing-press-\n28  secretary-sarah-sanders-and-homeland-security. \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 15 of 36   Page ID #:15\n1  Mr. Arreola’s Grant and Renewals of DACA \n2  49.  Based on the government’s assurances that confidential information would not \n3  be used to remove DACA recipients, Mr. Arreola first applied for deferred action and \n4  employment authorization pursuant to DACA in August 2012. As part of this process, \n5  Mr. Arreola provided the government with his school records and information about \n6  where he lived. He was also required to attend a biometrics appointment so that \n7  USCIS could take his fingerprints and photographs.  \n8  50.  Mr. Arreola was granted DACA and work authorization on September 26, \n9  2012. Mr. Arreola’s initial DACA grant remained in effect for two years, until \n10  September 25, 2014. \n11  51.  In 2014 and again in 2016, Mr. Arreola reapplied for DACA, and each time was \n12  granted deferred action and work authorization after being subject to rigorous vetting. \n13  As part of this process, the government sent Mr. Arreola approval notices informing \n14  him that his request for deferred action had been granted.   \n15  52.  Mr. Arreola’s 2016 approval notice provides that “[u]nless terminated, this \n16  decision to defer removal action will remain in effect for 2 years” and is valid until \n17  August 19, 2018. The approval notice informed Mr. Arreola that his deferred action \n18  could be terminated if he engaged in “[s]ubsequent criminal activity.” \n19  53.  Since he was granted DACA, Mr. Arreola has used his work authorization to \n20  help his family by working two jobs. Starting in approximately 2013, he worked at the \n21  Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, first as a dishwasher and then as a cook. In \n22  April 2016, he also began working as a driver for Uber and Lyft.   \n23  54.  The money Mr. Arreola obtained from these jobs helped his family in many \n24  ways. Mr. Arreola shared his earnings and paid half the rent for the family home.  \n25  55.  Until his DACA grant and employment authorization were unlawfully revoked, \n26  Mr. Arreola had been a model employee at the Chateau Marmont and a successful \n27  driver for Uber and Lyft. \n28  56.  Mr. Arreola has never been charged with or convicted of any crime. \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 16 of 36   Page ID #:16\n1  Mr. Arreola’s Arrest and Detention \n2  57.  As a driver, Mr. Arreola regularly provided rides to customers for a fee, both \n3  through the Uber and Lyft apps and through referrals from friends. On February 11, \n4  2017, a friend offered Mr. Arreola $600 to drive his cousin from the Los Angeles area \n5  to the San Diego area to pick up the friend’s uncle and another cousin, and bring them \n6  back to the Los Angeles area. \n7  58.  Mr. Arreola agreed to the long-distance ride and picked up his customer—his \n8  friend’s cousin—in Sun Valley near North Hollywood. The customer entered an \n9  address near San Diego into Mr. Arreola’s GPS and told him to drive to that location.  \n10  Being unfamiliar with the San Diego area, Mr. Arreola did not know anything about \n11  the destination address and merely followed the GPS instructions. \n12  59.  After driving for about three and a half hours, Mr. Arreola and his customer \n13  reached the destination either late in the evening on February 11, 2017 or early the \n14  next morning.    \n15  60.  His customer told Mr. Arreola to stop the car and wait while he went to get the \n16  uncle and cousin.  \n17  61.  The customer exited the car and walked toward a figure who was standing in \n18  the dark, who he apparently thought was the uncle. Instead of the uncle, that \n19  individual was a CBP agent. The CBP agent arrested the customer. \n20  62.  Although Mr. Arreola informed the CBP agent that he had been granted DACA \n21  and had permission to live and work in the United States, the CBP agent also arrested \n22  Mr. Arreola, apparently suspecting that he was aiding in smuggling individuals into \n23  the United States. \n24  63.  The CBP agent brought Mr. Arreola to Forest Gate Processing Center in \n25  Campo, California, where Mr. Arreola’s property was confiscated, including his car \n26  and cell phone. \n27  64.  Mr. Arreola was subsequently detained and questioned by another CBP agent.  \n28  Mr. Arreola also informed that CBP agent of his valid DACA grant. \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 17 of 36   Page ID #:17\n1  65.  The CBP agent questioned Mr. Arreola about his trip. Mr. Arreola explained \n2  that he was a driver, and that he had been offered $600 to pick up his friend’s uncle \n3  and cousin near the San Diego area and drive them back to the Los Angeles area. Mr. \n4  Arreola explained that he had never met his customer before that day.  \n5  66.  Mr. Arreola did not know the immigration status of his friend’s uncle and \n6  cousin whom he was supposed to pick up. As a driver, it was not Mr. Arreola’s \n7  practice to ask about the immigration status of the individuals to whom he gave rides. \n8  67.  Nonetheless, the CBP agents refused to release Mr. Arreola from custody. \n9  68.  Instead, on February 12, 2017, CBP issued Mr. Arreola a Notice to Appear \n10  (“NTA”), initiating removal proceedings against him and charging him as removable \n11  because he was present in the United States without admission under INA \n12  § 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). \n13  69.  Mr. Arreola was never charged with any smuggling-related crime or any \n14  smuggling-related ground of removability. \n15  70.  For the first two days of his detention, Mr. Arreola was not allowed to make a \n16  phone call. His family had no knowledge of his whereabouts and became very worried \n17  about him. Subsequently, Mr. Arreola was transferred to multiple detention centers in \n18  California, Arizona, and Georgia, eventually ending up in Folkston, Georgia—nearly \n19  2,500 miles away from his home. \n20  71.  On March 2, 2017, Mr. Arreola finally received a bond hearing before an \n21  immigration judge. During the bond hearing, the ICE attorney questioned Mr. Arreola \n22  at length regarding the circumstances that led to his arrest by CBP. The ICE attorney \n23  suggested that Mr. Arreola was a danger to the community because he attempted to \n24  smuggle people into the United States. \n25  72.  At the hearing, Mr. Arreola testified that he was a driver for Uber and Lyft, and \n26  that he was offered $600 by his friend to pick up his friend’s uncle and cousin near the \n27  San Diego area and drive them back to the Los Angeles area. He further testified that \n28  he had no knowledge of the immigration status of the individuals he was supposed to \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 18 of 36   Page ID #:18\n1  pick up, and denied the ICE attorney’s allegations that he was involved with \n2  smuggling. \n3  73.  The immigration judge rejected the ICE attorney’s arguments, found Mr. \n4  Arreola credible, determined that he is not a flight risk or danger to the community, \n5  and ordered Mr. Arreola’s release on $2,500 bond. \n6  74.  The immigration judge stated that he was “not going to accept the conclusions” \n7  by the CBP agents that Mr. Arreola was involved in “smuggling aliens for financial \n8  gains.” The immigration judge observed that Mr. Arreola is “an Uber and Lyft driver.  \n9  He’s in Hollywood, some three, three and a half hours away. Somebody is going to \n10  pay him to go all that way and come back.” The immigration judge added that the \n11  CBP agents made the incorrect “assumption that [Mr. Arreola] was being paid to \n12  smuggle” the uncle and cousin “as opposed to pick up a fare, what would have been a \n13  lucrative fare.”  \n14  75.  On March 3, 2017, Mr. Arreola posted bond and was released from detention. \n15  Mr. Arreola was detained a total of 21 days. He has been living in the Los Angeles \n16  area since being released.  \nTermination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA Grant and Employment \n17 \nAuthorization \n18 \n76.  On March 6, 2017, Mr. Arreola received a Notice of Action from USCIS \n19 \nnotifying him that his DACA and EAD were “terminated automatically as of the date \n20 \n[his Notice to Appear] was issued.”23 The Notice of Action states that an “appeal or \n21 \nmotion to reopen/reconsider this notice of action may not be filed.” \n22 \n77.  Mr. Arreola was never provided with any prior notice that Defendants intended \n23 \nto terminate his DACA and EAD, nor was he provided any opportunity to respond to \n24 \nsuch a notice or otherwise contest the termination of his DACA or EAD. Neither was \n25 \nhe provided with a reasoned explanation for the decision. \n26                                             \n23 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs., Notice of Action to Jesus Alonso Arreola \n27 \nRobles Re I-821D, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Mar. 6, 2017) (hereinafter \n28  “Notice of Action”) (emphasis added). \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 19 of 36   Page ID #:19\n1  78.  Defendants failed to provide Mr. Arreola with any notice or process even \n2  though the DACA program rules, including the Standard Operating Procedures \n3  (“SOPs”) that govern the DACA program, require that advance notice and an \n4  opportunity to respond be provided in most termination cases. Further, although the \n5  SOPs envision certain circumstances in which terminations might occur without \n6  notice, Defendants failed even to follow the procedures governing such terminations. \n7  79.  On March 17, 2017, Mr. Arreola’s counsel submitted a letter to USCIS \n8  requesting that USCIS reopen and reconsider the termination of his DACA and EAD.  \n9  80.  On May 9, 2017, USCIS responded, declining to revisit the issue. USCIS stated \n10  that, among other things, that “when ICE issues and serves the Notice to Appear on \n11  the DACA requestor during the DACA validity period, that action alone terminates \n12  the DACA. USCIS will send a Notice of Action and update our system as Deferred \n13  Action Terminated but that is only as a follow up to ICE’s action of termination.”  \n14  However, Mr. Arreola’s NTA was issued by CBP, not ICE. \n15  81.  Mr. Arreola has suffered and continues to suffer significant and irreparable \n16  harm as a result of Defendants’ actions. After his 21-day detention and subsequent \n17  release, Mr. Arreola has been unable to fully piece his life back together. After Mr. \n18  Arreola lost his DACA and work authorization, he lost his job with Chateau Marmont, \n19  and is no longer able to work as a driver for Lyft or Uber. \n20  82.  The revocation of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and work permit have been particularly \n21  difficult for him given that he and his long-term partner are expecting their first child \n22  together later this year. However, because of Defendants’ actions, Mr. Arreola’s \n23  ability to save for his new family has been curtailed. \n24  83.  Defendants’ termination of Mr. Arreola’s DACA grant and work permit failed \n25  to comply with the DACA program rules and procedures, and violated the \n26  Administrative Procedures Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n27 \n28 \n17 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 20 of 36   Page ID #:20\n1  Plaintiff Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective  \n2  84.  The Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective is a grassroots, immigrant \n3  youth-led organization located in Ontario, California. IEIYC serves the immigrant \n4  community in the Inland Empire region, which encompasses Riverside and San \n5  Bernardino Counties. IEIYC’s mission is to advocate for the needs of the \n6  undocumented immigrant community in the Inland Empire, including equal access to \n7  higher education for undocumented youth, and to achieve justice for immigrant \n8  communities by empowering those most affected by immigration policy. Since 2010, \n9  IEIYC has focused its efforts on creating a safe space for undocumented youth to \n10  share resources; organizing other youth to educate and mobilize their peers; and \n11  advocating for regional, state, and federal policies that benefit immigrant \n12  communities, including DACA recipients.   \n13  85.  Since 2012, IEIYC has coordinated numerous DACA workshops during which \n14  approximately 5,000 individuals have received immigration consultation and \n15  assistance with their DACA applications. IEIYC has provided approximately 30 \n16  scholarships to immigrant youth since 2015, for a total of about $15,000, to help \n17  undocumented youth pursue their educational goals or to assist with the cost of DACA \n18  application fees. In addition, IEIYC recently raised another $15,000 to assist \n19  individual DACA applicants with their renewal fees. IEIYC also runs a Mentorship \n20  Academy for local high school and college students, including DACA recipients, to \n21  provide professional and leadership development training. In addition, IEIYC has held \n22  informational sessions on topics important to DACA recipients, such as their legal \n23  rights when encountering law enforcement, and puts on an annual health conference to \n24  provide health information and resources. IEIYC also assists in documenting and \n25  responding to immigration enforcement activities in the Inland Empire and \n26  collaborates with other local organizations to ensure a rapid response from the \n27  community.   \n28 \n18 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 21 of 36   Page ID #:21\n1  86.  IEIYC currently has approximately 28 active members in Riverside and San \n2  Bernardino Counties, including a staff of three part-time employees and a board of \n3  directors comprised of five individuals. In various locations throughout the Inland \n4  Empire, IEIYC’s members help plan events and other programming, conduct \n5  outreach, and attend membership meetings. Because IEIYC only has three part-time \n6  staff, it is heavily dependent on its members’ ability to contribute their time and \n7  efforts.  \n8  87.  At least 18 of IEIYC’s members are current DACA recipients who also have \n9  work authorization through the program (collectively “IEIYC DACA recipients”). \n10  Defendants’ unlawful termination policies and practices are likely to harm IEIYC \n11  DACA recipients. IEIYC DACA recipients live, work, attend school, and carry out \n12  IEIYC work throughout the Inland Empire, where there is a significant CBP presence. \n13  For example, there are three CBP sub-stations in Riverside County, located in \n14  Murrieta, Temecula, and Indio, and a new Border Patrol complex is under \n15  construction in the Moreno Valley of Riverside County. There are CBP checkpoints \n16  located in Riverside County, and roving CBP patrols are also common in the area. \n17  IEIYC DACA recipients are at risk of coming into contact with CBP officers and \n18  being screened for possible revocation of their DACA when carrying out their day-to-\n19  day activities. \n20  88.  Some of IEIYC’s DACA recipients have had or may in the future have contact \n21  with local law enforcement, which could also put them at even greater risk of having \n22  their DACA terminated under the challenged practices, even though they have not \n23  engaged in any disqualifying conduct. \n24  Defendants’ Unlawful DACA Revocation Practices \n25  89.  Notwithstanding President Trump’s claims that DACA recipients “have nothing \n26  to worry about,”24 Defendants have engaged in a widespread practice of unlawfully \n27                                             \n24 @realDonladTrump, TWITTER (Sept. 7, 2017, 6:42 AM), \n28  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/905788459301908480. \n19 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 22 of 36   Page ID #:22\n1  revoking individuals’ DACA grants and work permits without process, apparently \n2  based on unsubstantiated suspicions of criminal activity or minor criminal history, \n3  even though these individuals have not violated the terms of the program and continue \n4  to be eligible for it. \n5  90.  The targeting of DACA recipients for revocation has coincided with broader \n6  changes in immigration enforcement under the Trump Administration. Administration \n7  officials have made numerous public statements indicating that “anyone who is in this \n8  country in violation of immigration law is subject to possible arrest.”25  \n9  91.  In April 2017, in response to questions about a DACA recipient who was \n10  removed from the country, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, “We can’t promise \n11  people who are here unlawfully that they’re not going to be deported.”26  \n12  92.  In June 2017, Defendant Homan said, “If you’re in this country illegally, and \n13  you committed a crime by entering this country, you should be uncomfortable . . . . \n14  You should look over your shoulder.”27  \n15  93.  In August 2017, ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez confirmed that “ICE does \n16  not exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. All \n17  of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, \n18  detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States.”28 \n                                           \n19 \n25 Brenda Gazzar, ICE arrests increase under Trump showing ‘gloves are being taken \n20  off,’ The Mercury News, May 10, 2017 (quoting ICE spokesperson Virginia Kice), \nhttp://www.mercurynews.com/2017/05/10/ice-arrests-increase-under-trump-showing-\n21 \ngloves-are-being-taken-off-4/.  \n22  26 Ted Hesson, Sessions: ‘We can’t promise’ Dreamers won’t be deported,’ Politico, \nApr. 19, 2017, http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/jeff-sessions-dreams-\n23 \ndeported-237369. \n24  27 Maria Sacchetti, ICE chief tells lawmakers agency needs much more money for \nimmigration arrests, Wash.

In September 2017, Defendant Duke reportedly stated that she has never seen \n2  DHS guidance telling DACA applicants that their information would not be used for \n3  immigration enforcement purposes.29  \n4  95.  Multiple DACA recipients have been detained by immigration authorities since \n5  President Trump took office. For example, in February, immigration authorities \n6  detained Josue Romero, a 19-year-old DACA recipient and arts scholarship student \n7  residing in Texas, after he was arrested by local police on a misdemeanor charge.30  In \n8  August, ICE apprehended 22-year-old Riccy Enriquez Perdomo, a DACA recipient, \n9  mother of two young children, and former Amazon employee residing in Kentucky.  \n10  Although she had no criminal history and a valid DACA grant, immigration \n11  authorities nonetheless confiscated her work permit and detained her for a week after \n12  she went to an immigration detention center to post a bond for a friend.31 Just recently, \n13  in early September, ten DACA recipients were detained for hours by CBP at a \n14  checkpoint in Texas even though they have valid DACA.32 Although they were \n15  ultimately released, CBP scrutinized their records, presumably looking for a reason to \n16  hold them and revoke their DACA. \n17  96.  Indeed, immigration officers have been expressly instructed to screen any \n18  DACA recipient they encounter in the field for potential enforcement actions.

If the officers \n9  find an indication of a new conviction, or even simply an arrest, they may place the \n10  DACA recipient in removal proceedings, thereby revoking their DACA grants.  \n11  97.   According to government data, DACA revocations increased by 25 percent \n12  after President Trump’s inauguration.35 \n13  98.  Upon information and belief, since January, there have been numerous cases in \n14  which immigration authorities have targeted DACA recipients by revoking their \n15  DACA grants and work permits, without providing any notice or process, even though \n16  they have engaged in no disqualifying conduct and continue to be eligible for the \n17  program. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ counsel are aware of more than a dozen cases nationwide. \n18  99.  For example, in February, immigration authorities arrested and detained 23-\n19  year-old Daniel Ramirez Medina, a Washington state resident. ICE issued him an \n20  NTA, even though he had valid DACA and had done nothing to change his eligibility \n21  for the program. Although he has no criminal history, immigration authorities claimed \n22                                             \n33 @ValOnTheBorder, TWITTER (Sept. 25, 2017, 7:35PM), \n23 \nhttps://twitter.com/ValOnTheBorder/status/912505757958119426; see also Valerie \n24  Gonzalez, “Border Patrol Memo States Procedures to Process All DACA Recipients,” \nKRGV.com, Sept. 25, 2017, http://www.krgv.com/story/36450600/border-patrol-\n25 \nmemo-states-procedures-to-process-all-daca-recipients. \n26  34 ValOnTheBorder, TWITTER (Sept. 25, 2017, 7:35PM). \n35 Keegan Hamilton, Targeting Dreamers, Vice News, Sept. 8, 2017, \n27 \nhttps://news.vice.com/story/ice-was-going-after-dreamers-even-before-trump-killed-\n28  daca. \n22 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 25 of 36   Page ID #:25\n1  that he was suspected of being a gang member and issued him an NTA. An \n2  immigration judge determined that he is not a flight risk or danger to the community, \n3  and ordered him released on bond, but USCIS had already revoked his DACA, \n4  without notice or opportunity to be heard.36 \n5  100.  In April, immigration authorities detained a 26-year-old DACA recipient in \n6  Georgia and issued him an NTA after he was arrested on a misdemeanor charge. \n7  Although the prosecutor subsequently dropped the charge and an immigration judge \n8  ordered the DACA recipient released on bond, USCIS had already revoked his \n9  DACA, without notice or an opportunity to be heard.    \n10  101.  In May, immigration authorities arrested and detained a 19-year-old DACA \n11  recipient in North Carolina and issued him an NTA after he was arrested on a \n12  misdemeanor charge. He pled guilty to a minor misdemeanor that did not disqualify \n13  him from DACA, but USCIS had already revoked his DACA, without notice or an \n14  opportunity to be heard.      \n15  102.  In May, USCIS also revoked the DACA grant and work permit of then-28-year-\n16  old Georgia resident and paralegal Jessica Colotl without notice, denying her renewal \n17  request and denying her an opportunity to be heard. Federal authorities publicly stated \n18  that the revocation was based on minor, non-disqualifying criminal history—namely, \n19  driving without a license—that Ms. Colotl had disclosed in her prior DACA \n20  applications. \n21  103.  In June, immigration authorities arrested and detained a 22-year-old DACA \n22  recipient in California for twelve days. ICE issued him an NTA, even though he had \n23  valid DACA and had done nothing to change his eligibility for the program. Although \n24  immigration authorities later claimed that he was suspected of being affiliated with a \n25  gang, ICE voluntarily released him from detention and cancelled his removal \n26                                             \n36 Emily Goldberg, What Immigration Raids Mean for Students, The Atlantic, Feb. 17, \n27 \n2017, https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/02/why-was-a-daca-\n28  recipient-detained-by-ice/517134/.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 26 of 36   Page ID #:26\n1  proceedings, indicating that the suspicion was not substantiated. However, USCIS had \n2  already revoked his DACA, without notice or an opportunity to be heard. \n3  104.  In July, USCIS revoked the DACA grant and work permit of a 32-year-old \n4  South Dakota resident without notice or an opportunity to be heard, despite granting \n5  him a two-year renewal only seven months before in December 2016. Federal \n6  authorities did not provide a clear reason for revoking his DACA, even though he has \n7  only a single, non-disqualifying misdemeanor conviction that he had disclosed in his \n8  prior DACA applications. \n9  105.  In September, USCIS revoked the DACA grant and work permit of a 30-year-\n10  old Minnesota resident and mother without notice or an opportunity to be heard. \n11  Federal authorities did not provide a clear reason for revoking her DACA, even \n12  though she remains eligible for the program and her only contact with law \n13  enforcement is limited to minor traffic violations. \n14  106.  In addition, thousands of individuals nationwide are subject to having their \n15  DACA and work authorization terminated pursuant to Defendants’ unlawful policies \n16  and practices. \n17  107.  Defendants’ unlawful termination of qualified individuals’ DACA and work \n18  authorization involves three systemic practices.  \n19  108.  First, Defendants have a practice of revoking DACA grants without providing \n20  notice, a reasoned explanation, or an opportunity to be heard prior to revocation, and \n21  without providing a process for reinstatement where the revocation is in error.  \n22  109.  Second, Defendants have engaged in a widespread practice of automatically \n23  terminating DACA grants and work permits of individuals who remain eligible for \n24  DACA based on the filing of a Notice to Appear by immigration authorities, including \n25  where the sole basis for the NTA is the individual’s presence without admission in the \n26  United States or having overstayed a visa—charges that apply essentially to all DACA \n27  recipients—and even though DACA is available to noncitizens who are already in \n28  removal proceedings.   \n24 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 27 of 36   Page ID #:27\n1  110.  Third, Defendants have targeted DACA recipients for revocation, even though \n2  they have committed no disqualifying conduct, based on the Trump administration’s \n3  articulation of new immigration enforcement priorities. On February 20, 2017, former \n4  DHS Secretary Kelly issued a memorandum setting forth priorities for DHS’s \n5  enforcement of the immigration laws.37 The Memorandum prioritizes for removal \n6  even noncitizens who have no criminal convictions, but merely have been “charged \n7  with any criminal offense that has not been resolved,” as well as any noncitizen who \n8  has “committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offense.” These broad \n9  categories presume guilt for offenses that have not been proven in court. They also \n10  include minor misdemeanors that do not disqualify individuals from the DACA \n11  program, such as traffic offenses or crimes related to immigration status like unlawful \n12  entry into the United States.  \n13  111.  Although the Kelly Memorandum rescinded prior guidance concerning \n14  immigration enforcement priorities issued during the Obama administration, it \n15  expressly kept the DACA guidance in place. Thus, the Memorandum provides that \n16  “the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from \n17  potential enforcement” “[e]xcept as specifically noted above”—referring specifically \n18  to the DACA program.38 DHS also issued a “Q&A” document concerning this \n19  memorandum which states (at Question 22): \n20  Q22: Do these memoranda affect recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood \n21  Arrivals (DACA)? \n22  A22: No.39 \n                                           \n23 \n37 See Memorandum from John Kelly, Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve \n24  the National Interest 2 (Feb. 20, 2017), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Enforcement-of-the-\n25 \nImmigration-Laws-to-Serve-the-National-Interest.pdf. \n26  38 See id. \n39 See Q&A: DHS Implementation of the Executive Order on Enhancing Public Safety \n27 \nin the Interior of the United States, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Feb. 21, 2017, \n28  https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/02/21/qa-dhs-implementation-executive-order-\n \n25 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 28 of 36   Page ID #:28\n1  112.  Notwithstanding the express language in the Kelly Memorandum and the \n2  accompanying FAQ, immigration authorities have claimed that the Kelly \n3  Memorandum justifies revoking the DACA grant of individuals who would fall within \n4  the new, extremely broad enforcement priorities. Immigration authorities have taken \n5  this position even though the rules of the DACA program expressly provide that \n6  certain minor criminal history is not disqualifying. Under Defendants’ view, \n7  apparently any DACA recipient who is charged with or has allegedly committed any \n8  criminal offense, no matter how minor, and without any conviction, can have his or \n9  her DACA grant and work permit stripped without notice. \n10  113.  Defendants’ policies and practices violate the Administrative Procedures Act \n11  (“APA”) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \n12  Constitution.  \n13  114.  Defendants’ failure to provide DACA recipients with notice, a reasoned \n14  explanation, and an opportunity to be heard prior to revocation, as well as a process \n15  for reinstatement where the revocation is in error, violates the Due Process Clause and \n16  the rules governing the DACA program, and is arbitrary and capricious and contrary \n17  to law in violation of the APA. Individuals who have been granted DACA have \n18  important constitutionally protected interests in their DACA grant and employment \n19  authorization. The revocation of an individual’s grant of deferred action and work \n20  permit under the DACA program harms those interests. Before the immigration \n21  authorities may revoke a DACA grant and work permit, they must provide, at a \n22  minimum, notice, a reasoned explanation for the decision, and an opportunity to be \n23  heard. This is particularly important where immigration authorities seek revocation \n24  based on mere allegations. In addition, the rules for the DACA program require that \n25  detailed procedures be followed before a DACA grant can be terminated, including \n26 \n27 \n                                                                                                                                             \n28  enhancing-public-safety-interior-united-states. \n26 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 29 of 36   Page ID #:29\n1  notice and an opportunity to respond in most cases. Yet Defendants fail even to follow \n2  their own procedures. \n3  115.  In addition, Defendants’ practice of automatically terminating DACA when \n4  immigration authorities file a Notice to Appear—including based solely on presence \n5  without admission to the United States or overstaying a visa—is arbitrary and \n6  capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA. An individual’s presence \n7  without admission or overstay of a visa does not provide a relevant basis for \n8  terminating DACA. Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA based on an NTA \n9  charging presence without admission or overstaying a visa is irrational and arbitrary \n10  because all DACA recipients are present in the country without lawful immigration \n11  status; indeed that circumstance is what made it necessary for them to apply for \n12  DACA in the first place. Further, the practice is contrary to the rules for the DACA \n13  program, which do not allow for termination based merely on presence without \n14  admission or overstaying a visa, and also do not permit automatic termination unless \n15  certain procedures are followed. Indeed, Defendants’ own rules expressly provide that \n16  individuals who are in removal proceedings, or who have received a final order of \n17  removal, remain eligible to apply for and receive DACA. Defendants’ practice is also \n18  unlawful because, in automatically revoking DACA based on an NTA, the agency \n19  fails to consider the relevant facts and circumstances and exercise individualized \n20  discretion in deciding whether to continue or revoke DACA. In addition, Defendants’ \n21  practice improperly rests the decision of whether an individual’s DACA grant \n22  continues to be warranted on the capricious charging decision of an individual \n23  immigration agent. For these reasons and others, Defendants’ automatic termination of \n24  DACA based on an NTA is unlawful. \n25  116.  Further, Defendants’ practice of revoking DACA for individuals who lack any \n26  disqualifying criminal convictions without process is unlawful under the APA because \n27  it reflects the agency’s reversal of its decision to grant DACA in the first place, \n28  without providing a reasoned explanation for the change. The granting and renewal of \n27 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 30 of 36   Page ID #:30\n1  DACA reflects the agency’s reasoned determination that the individual is eligible for \n2  and deserving of deferred action and work authorization. A revocation reflects an \n3  abrupt change in the agency’s considered position, yet the agency’s practice is to \n4  revoke DACA in these cases without providing a reasoned explanation that would \n5  justify such a change. \n6  117.  Finally, Defendants’ reliance on the Kelly Memorandum to terminate DACA \n7  for individuals who have committed no disqualifying conduct and continue to be \n8  eligible for the DACA program is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in \n9  violation of the APA because it violates Defendants’ own rules for the DACA \n10  program, and is inconsistent with the express language of the Kelly Memorandum. \n11  Indeed, applying DHS’ new enforcement priorities to DACA recipients would \n12  eviscerate the DACA program as DACA recipients by definition lack a lawful \n13  immigration status, and a large number of them have engaged in activities related to \n14  their lack of status—such as entering the country without authorization or driving \n15  without a license—that would make them an immigration enforcement priority were \n16  the Memorandum to apply to them. \n17  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n18  118.  Together with IEIYC, representative Plaintiff Arreola brings this action \n19  pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) on behalf of himself and a \n20  nationwide class of all other persons similarly situated. The proposed class is defined \n21  as follows: \n22  All recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) \n23  who have had or will have their DACA grant and employment \n24  authorization revoked without notice or an opportunity to respond, \n25  even though they have not been convicted of a disqualifying criminal \n26  offense. \n27  119.  The class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because it is so numerous \n28  that joinder of all members is impracticable. Plaintiffs’ counsel alone are currently \n28 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 31 of 36   Page ID #:31\n1  aware of at least a dozen individuals across the country who have had their DACA \n2  and work authorization revoked without any process, even though they lack a \n3  disqualifying conviction. Moreover, many more such individuals will continue to have \n4  their DACA and work authorization revoked without process in the future, making \n5  joinder impracticable. Indeed, thousands of current DACA recipients nationwide are \n6  subject to having their DACA and work authorization revoked pursuant to \n7  Defendants’ policies and practices, without notice or an opportunity to respond to \n8  Defendants’ allegations, even though they remain eligible for the program. \n9  120.  The class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n10  Procedure 23(a)(2). The proposed class members are all subject to Defendants’ three \n11  common practices or policies: (1) the revocation of DACA and work authorization \n12  without notice, a reasoned explanation, and an opportunity to be heard prior to \n13  revocation, or a process for reinstatement where the revocation is in error; (2) the \n14  automatic termination of DACA grants and work permits based on the filing of a \n15  Notice to Appear, even where the sole basis for the NTA is presence in the country \n16  without admission or overstaying a visa; and (3) the termination of DACA grants and \n17  work permits based on DHS’ new immigration enforcement priorities, even where an \n18  individual has no disqualifying conviction. The lawsuit raises numerous questions of \n19  law and fact common to members of the class, including but not limited to: \n20    Whether Defendants’ practice of revoking DACA without notice, a reasoned \n21  explanation of the reason for such termination, or an opportunity to be heard is \n22  arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA; \n23    Whether Defendants’ practice of revoking DACA without notice, a meaningful \n24  explanation of the reason for such termination, or an opportunity to be heard \n25  violates the Due Process Clause. \n26    Whether Defendants’ practice of automatically terminating DACA when \n27  immigration authorities file a Notice to Appear—including based solely on \n28 \n29 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 32 of 36   Page ID #:32\n1  presence without admission to the United States or overstaying a visa—is \n2  arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA. \n3    Whether Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA based on criminal history \n4  or alleged conduct, even though the individual remains eligible for the program, \n5  pursuant to the immigration enforcement priorities set forth in the Kelly \n6  Memorandum, is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the \n7  APA. \n8  121.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n9  Procedure 23(a)(3) because the claims of the representative Plaintiff, Mr. Arreola, are \n10  typical of the claims of the class. Mr. Arreola and the proposed class members are all \n11  individuals who are or will have their DACA and employment authorization revoked \n12  without notice or an opportunity to be heard even though they have not been convicted \n13  of a disqualifying criminal offense, and are all subject to Defendants’ practice of \n14  terminating DACA and employment authorization based on the filing of an NTA \n15  and/or the Kelly Memorandum. Plaintiff Arreola and the proposed class also share the \n16  same legal claims, which challenge the legality of these revocation policies and \n17  practices under the APA and the Due Process Clause. \n18  122.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule of Civil \n19  Procedure 23(a)(4). Mr. Arreola seeks the same relief as the other members of the \n20  class—namely, a declaration that Defendants’ policies and practices violate the APA \n21  and Due Process Clause, and an order enjoining Defendants from terminating DACA \n22  and work authorization on arbitrary grounds and in the absence of adequate \n23  procedures. Moreover, Mr. Arreola has no interests adverse to those of the class as a \n24  whole. In defending his own rights, Mr. Arreola will defend the rights of all proposed \n25  class members fairly and adequately. \n26  123.  In addition, the proposed class is represented by counsel from the American \n27  Civil Liberties Union Immigrants’ Rights Project and the American Civil Liberties \n28  Union of Southern California. Counsel have extensive experience litigating class \n30 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 33 of 36   Page ID #:33\n1  action lawsuits and other complex cases in federal court, including civil rights \n2  lawsuits on behalf of noncitizens. \n3  124.  The members of the class are readily ascertainable through Defendants’ records. \n4  125.  Finally, the proposed class satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). \n5  The immigration authorities have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class by \n6  arbitrarily stripping class members of DACA and employment authorization, without \n7  adequate procedures through which they can challenge those revocation decisions. \n8  Thus, final injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class as a \n9  whole. \n10  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \n11 \nFirst Claim \n12  Administrative Procedure Act \n13  126.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \n14  forth herein. \n15  127.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706, provides that \n16  courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, \n17  capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n18  § 706(2)(A). \n19  128.  Defendants’ practice of terminating or revoking DACA grants and employment \n20  authorization without notice, a reasoned explanation, an opportunity to be heard, or a \n21  reinstatement procedure is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the \n22  APA because a DACA grant cannot be terminated without first providing a \n23  meaningful process and complying with the DACA program rules, including the \n24  SOPs. \n25  129.  Defendants’ practice of automatically terminating or revoking DACA and \n26  employment authorization as a result of the filing of an NTA—including a NTA \n27  solely charging removability for being present without admission or for having \n28  overstayed a visa—is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the \n31 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 34 of 36   Page ID #:34\n1  APA for multiple reasons, including that such an NTA fails to provide a reasoned \n2  basis for terminating DACA; terminating on this basis is inconsistent with the rules of \n3  the DACA program; the practice reflects a failure of the agency to exercise \n4  individualized discretion; and it rests the termination decision on the arbitrary \n5  charging decision of an ICE or CBP officer. \n6  130.  Defendants’ practice of terminating or revoking DACA based on non-\n7  disqualifying criminal history or unsubstantiated allegations is arbitrary and capricious \n8  and contrary to law in violation of the APA because it represents a departure from the \n9  agency’s considered decision to grant DACA, without providing a reasoned \n10  explanation for their change in position. \n11  131.  Defendants’ practice of relying on the Kelly Memorandum to terminate or \n12  revoke DACA for individuals who have committed no disqualifying conduct and \n13  continue to be eligible for the DACA program is arbitrary and capricious and contrary \n14  to law in violation of the APA because it is contrary to Defendants’ own rules for the \n15  DACA program, as well as the language of the Kelly Memorandum itself. \n \n16 \nSecond Claim \n17  Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n18  132.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \n19  forth herein. \n20  133.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n21  provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without \n22  due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. V. \n23  134.  Defendants have a policy and practice of revoking DACA recipients’ DACA \n24  and work authorization without providing any process. Once DACA has been granted, \n25  it cannot be taken away without adequate process. Defendants’ policy and practice \n26  violates procedural due process because it fails to provide DACA recipients with \n27  notice, a reasoned explanation for the revocation decision, and an opportunity to \n28  respond, and to present arguments and evidence to demonstrate that the individual \n32 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 35 of 36   Page ID #:35\n1  continues to be eligible for and warrants the continuation of his or her DACA grant. \n2  Defendants’ process also fails to provide for reinstatement in cases where the \n3  revocation decision was in error. \n4  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n5  IEIYC and Mr. Arreola, on behalf of himself and others similar situated, ask \n6  this Court to grant the following relief: \n7  a)  Certify this case as a class action lawsuit as proposed herein, appoint Mr. \n8  Arreola as class representative and the undersigned counsel as class counsel; \n9  b) Declare Defendants’ DACA revocation practices and policies unlawful and \n10  unconstitutional; \n11  c)  Enjoin Defendants from terminating class members’ and IEIYC DACA \n12  recipients’ DACA grants and EADs absent a fair procedure—including \n13  reasonable notice, a reasoned explanation, and an opportunity to be heard—\n14  through which to challenge the termination consistent with the APA and the \n15  Due Process Clause;  \n16  d) Enjoin Defendants from revoking the DACA grants and EADs of class \n17  members and IEIYC DACA recipients based on the filing of an NTA charging \n18  solely presence without admission to the United States or overstaying a visa, or \n19  based on the enforcement priorities set forth in the Kelly Memorandum; \n20  e)  Vacate Defendants’ unlawful revocation of DACA and work authorization for \n21  Mr. Arreola and class members, and enjoin Defendants from enforcing the \n22  revocations; \n23  f)  In the alternative, order Defendants to temporarily reinstate DACA and work \n24  authorization for Mr. Arreola and such class members pending a fair \n25  procedure—including reasonable notice, a reasoned explanation, and an \n26  opportunity to be heard—through which they may challenge the revocation \n27  decision consistent with the APA and the Due Process Clause; \n28 \n33 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048   Document 1   Filed 10/05/17   Page 36 of 36   Page ID #:36\n1  g) Order Defendants to accept renewal applications from Mr. Arreola and class \n2  members whose DACA protections were unlawfully revoked;   \n3  h) Grant an award of attorneys’ fees and costs; and \n4  i)  Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper. \n5   \n6              Respectfully submitted, \n               \n7 \nDated:  October 5, 2017      /s/ Jennifer Chang Newell \n8  Jennifer Chang Newell \nKatrina L.

The government never explains why the Court \n5  should reach a different decision on the same claims. Instead, the government repeats \n6  arguments that this Court squarely rejected: that the Court lacks jurisdiction; that the \n7  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Standard Operating Procedures (“DACA \n8  SOPs”) do not mean what they say; that the government is free to take contradictory \n9  actions and reverse its position arbitrarily; and that the government’s interest in \n10  violating its own rules outweighs the harm to the Plaintiff class in being stripped of \n11  permission to live and work in the United States. Compare Arreola PI Opp., Dkt. 23, \n12  with Class PI Opp., Dkt. 54. Yet this Court has already explained in detail why it has \n13  jurisdiction over these claims, why USCIS’s termination of DACA without notice \n14  violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and why the equities favor an \n15  injunction. See PI Order, Dkt. 31. The Court should reach the same conclusion here. \n16  Unable to offer new arguments, the government resorts to mischaracterizing the \n17  named Plaintiffs’ facts. Contrary to the government’s assertions, Mr. Gil was never \n18  charged with any felony. The city attorney found that the only charge for which there \n19  was probable cause was driving on a cancelled license. Declaration of Maria Teresa \n20  Trafton ¶ 2, Ex. A. As a result, Mr. Gil was charged with a single misdemeanor traffic \n21  violation. Id. ¶ 3 Ex. B.1 As to Mr. Moreira, the government emphasizes that he was \n22  initially arrested for forgery, but fails to mention that he was never charged with that \n23  offense. As he stated in his declaration, Mr. Moreira instead was only charged with a \n24  misdemeanor for possession of an altered identification document. See Declaration of \n25  David Hausman ¶ 2, Ex. A. Indeed, the government’s mischaracterizations only \n26                                             \n1 Mr. Gil has not been convicted of the charge, and indeed, the case has been \n27 \ncontinued and the charge will be dismissed if Mr. Gil successfully completes \n28  probation. Trafton Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. C. \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 7 of 17   Page ID #:1865\n1  underline the importance of the procedures Plaintiffs seek here. Had Mr. Gil or Mr. \n2  Moreira had notice of USCIS’s termination decision and an opportunity to respond, \n3  each would have corrected the government’s mistaken conclusions. And in any event, \n4  such facts are irrelevant because USCIS did not address them in its rationale for the \n5  challenged DACA termination decisions: as the government concedes, USCIS has a \n6  practice of automatically terminating DACA when a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) is \n7  issued. \n8  The class members’ request for relief is straightforward: this Court should \n9  restore the status quo by vacating the revocations of class members whose DACA was \n10  revoked without process after January 19, 2017, and by preliminarily enjoining the \n11  future unlawful revocation of class members’ DACA absent a termination process that \n12  complies with the APA and the Due Process Clause. \n13  ARGUMENT \n14  I.  NO STATUTE PRECLUDES JUDICIAL REVIEW. \n15  The Court correctly determined that it had jurisdiction to enjoin the termination \n16  of Mr. Arreola’s DACA and work authorization. See PI Order at 4-8; see also Arreola \n17  PI Reply, Dkt. 25, at 2-11. The Court has jurisdiction here for the same reasons. In \n18  suggesting otherwise, the government simply rehashes arguments that this Court has \n19  already considered and rejected. \n20    First, the government again suggests that review of USCIS’s failure to provide \n21  notice and process in terminating DACA is precluded by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Yet that \n22  provision insulates from review only a “‘decision or action’ to ‘commence \n23  proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’” Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-\n24  Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 482 (1999) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g)). The \n25  government asserts that “[t]here can be no reasonable argument that DACA \n26  termination by . . . issuance [of an NTA] does not arise out of the decision to initiate \n27  removal proceedings.” Class PI Opp. at 8 (emphasis omitted). But as the Court \n28  explained, and multiple courts have agreed, class members are “challenging neither \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 8 of 17   Page ID #:1866\n1  the issuance of the NTA nor the [government’s] decision to commence removal \n2  proceedings,” but instead “USCIS’s separate and independent decision to revoke \n3  [their] DACA on that basis, which is independent of the limited category of decisions \n4  covered by § 1252(g).” PI Order at 6; accord Arreola PI Reply at 2-6; Ramirez \n5  Medina v. DHS, No. 17-cv-0218, 2017 WL 5176720, at *6-7 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 8, \n6  2017); Gonzalez Torres v. DHS, No. 17-cv-1840, 2017 WL 4340385, at *4 (S.D. Cal. \n7  Sept. 29, 2017); Colotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp. 3d 1328, 1338-40 (N.D. Ga. 2017).  \n8  The Court was also correct to hold that in any event, § 1252(g) does not bar \n9  review of legal questions related to discretionary decisions, and that the Plaintiffs’ \n10  claims are therefore reviewable on that basis. PI Order at 6. The government does not \n11  contest that such legal questions are reviewable, but instead mischaracterizes the \n12  Plaintiffs’ claims as seeking to require the agency to exercise its discretion not to \n13  terminate DACA. Class PI Opp. at 13 n.11. But as this Court found and the Plaintiffs \n14  have explained, Plaintiffs seek review not of USCIS’s ultimate exercise of discretion \n15  to grant or deny DACA, but rather of the agency’s compliance with its own rules, the \n16  APA, and due process. Compare id.with PI Order at 6; accord Arreola PI Reply at 1.   \n17    Second, the government repeats its suggestion that the Plaintiffs’ claims are \n18  precluded by 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(b)(9) and 1252(a)(5), which require that challenges to \n19  removal orders be raised through a petition for review of a final removal order in the \n20  courts of appeal. Yet the government fails even to acknowledge this Court’s \n21  observation that “[a]n immigration judge in a removal proceeding does not have the \n22  power to grant or deny deferred action, or to review or reverse an agency’s decision to \n23  revoke it.” PI Order at 7. That fact alone is decisive because, in the government’s own \n24  words, “if the issue is one that can be raised in removal proceedings, and ultimately in \n25  a petition for review, then the statute precludes district court review.” Class PI Opp. at \n26  10 (emphasis added); accord Arreola PI Reply at 7. Because the Plaintiffs are unable \n27  to challenge the termination of their DACA in removal proceedings, §§ 1252(b)(9) \n28  and 1252(a)(5) do not preclude them from raising their challenge in district court. \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 9 of 17   Page ID #:1867\n1  Accord Arreola PI Reply at 6-8; Ramirez Medina, 2017 WL 5176720, at *8; Gonzalez \n2  Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5; Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1339-40. \n3    Finally, the government argues once again that USCIS need not provide notice \n4  or process in terminating DACA because the decision is “committed to agency \n5  discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); see also Class PI Opp. at 10-11. But again, \n6  the government simply ignores this Court’s prior decision and the controlling Ninth \n7  Circuit cases, which rely on the established proposition that review is available where \n8  “‘discretion has been legally circumscribed by various memoranda.’” PI Order at 4 \n9  (quoting Alcaraz v. INS, 384 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir. 2004)); accord Arreola PI \n10  Reply at 9-11; Ramirez Medina, 2017 WL 5176720, at *8; Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at \n11  1340-41. As this Court correctly held, “[h]ere, the decision to revoke DACA is \n12  governed by both the Napolitano Memo and the DACA SOPs.” PI Order at 4. Review \n13  is therefore available under those authorities, the APA, and the Constitution. \n14 \nII.  USCIS’S AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF DACA IS ARBITRARY \n15  AND CAPRICIOUS UNDER THE APA. \n16  Plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on their APA claims. \n17  Defendants acknowledge that they have a practice of automatically terminating class \n18  members’ DACA and work authorization without process. See Class PI Opp. at 23. \n19  This Court has already held that this practice violates the APA for multiple reasons. \n20  The Court held that automatically terminating DACA based on an NTA charging \n21  unlawful presence is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA because all \n22  DACA recipients are unlawfully present and being in removal proceedings is not \n23  disqualifying. PI Order at 8-13. The Court also held that abruptly terminating an \n24  individual’s DACA without providing a reasoned explanation for the agency’s \n25  reversal, after granting DACA on one or more occasions, violates the APA. Id at 10-\n26  11. Further, the Court held that Defendants’ automatic termination practice violates \n27  the DACA procedures, which the agency is required to follow. See id. Defendants fail \n28  to grapple with the Court’s reasoning, which applies equally here. \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 10 of 17   Page ID #:1868\n1  Defendants instead focus their response on a number of arguments that are \n2  irrelevant to the Court’s reasoning and to the arguments raised by Plaintiffs.  Class PI \n3  Opp. at 17-20.  Plaintiffs are not challenging the government’s authority to initiate \n4  removal proceedings, issue an NTA, or select the charges alleged in the NTA. And the \n5  Court’s preliminary injunction with respect to Plaintiff Arreola—granting the same \n6  relief that Plaintiffs now seek for the class—does not preclude the government from \n7  issuing an NTA or initiating removal proceedings, nor does it dictate what charges \n8  must be included in an NTA. PI Order at 15-16; see also PI Order at 6. Indeed, \n9  Plaintiff Arreola’s removal proceedings are ongoing, and his NTA remains unaffected. \n10  Defendants’ focus on ICE and CBP’s authority to initiate removal proceedings \n11  and issue NTAs is beside the point, as the only questions in this case pertain to \n12  USCIS’s decisions to terminate DACA. The Napolitano Memo and SOPs \n13  unmistakably vest that termination authority in USCIS, and provide detailed \n14  procedures governing USCIS’s exercise of that authority. Class PI. Mot., Dkt. 34-1, at \n15  9-16. As this Court has explained, the Napolitano “Memo instructed USCIS, not ICE \n16  or CBP, to make DACA determinations.” PI Order at 12. “[N]othing in the Napolitano \n17  Memo supports the notion that, once USCIS implemented the DACA adjudication \n18  process and made a considered judgment to grant an individual DACA, the decision \n19  could be unilaterally undone by any ICE or CBP officer.” Id.2 \n20  Defendants make a number of other erroneous representations about the DACA \n21  rules, addressed below. In one critical respect, however, Defendants are correct: \n22  Defendants now concede that “the DACA SOP provides that USCIS should notify an \n23  individual of its intent to terminate DACA and provide an opportunity to respond to \n24                                             \n2 Defendants’ repeated references to ICE and CBP’s alleged reasons for \n25 \npursuing removal in Plaintiffs’ and other individual cases are irrelevant for an \n26  additional reason: as this Court has held, “[c]ourts review agency action according to \nthe contemporaneous reasons given by the agency and disregard alternative rationales \n27 \npresented during litigation.” PI Order at 12-13. The only relevant potential \n28  justifications are those provided by USCIS in its termination decisions. \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 11 of 17   Page ID #:1869\n1  intended DACA termination when . . . subsequent criminal activity comes to USCIS’s \n2  attention that is not EPS [Egregious Public Safety concern].” Class Cert. Opp. at 15. \n3  As this Court has recognized, absent specified criminal, national security, or public \n4  safety concerns, “the DACA termination guidelines prescribe the issuance of a Notice \n5  of Intent to Terminate and require that the individual should be allowed 33 days to file \n6  a brief or statement contesting the grounds cited.” PI Order at 11 (internal quotation \n7  marks and citation omitted). Defendants’ automatic termination practice therefore \n8  violates the agency’s own rules and the APA. \n9  Defendants erroneously suggest that the DACA SOPs provide for automatic \n10  termination—without process—whenever a DACA recipient is labeled an \n11  enforcement priority. Class Cert. Opp. at 15. Defendants also make the sweeping \n12  assertion that “[i]n reality, DHS considers every individual it issues an NTA to [be] an \n13  enforcement priority.” Id. at 14 n.8. Defendants are wrong on both counts. Critically, \n14  the class is defined to include only individuals who are eligible for DACA—and the \n15  rules of the DACA program expressly provide that eligible individuals are not \n16  enforcement priorities. The DACA Memorandum explains that DHS’s enforcement \n17  resources should not be expended on “these low priority cases”—referring to \n18  individuals who meet the eligibility criteria—and instead “on people who meet our \n19  enforcement priorities.”3  Further, the DACA Memorandum and SOPs repeatedly \n20  provide that the fact that an individual is in removal proceedings does not disqualify \n21  him from being deemed “low priority” via the DACA program. See PI Order at 9-10.  \n22  In addition, if Defendants’ assertion were true that all individuals issued an \n23  NTA are enforcement priorities, then the detailed enforcement priorities enumerated \n24  in the Kelly Memorandum would be a nullity. See Kwon Decl., Dkt. 16-4, ¶ 13, Ex. \n25  12. Notably, the Kelly Memorandum on its face makes clear that it does not apply to \n26  the DACA program. See, e.g., Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1343 (holding that “the Kelly \n                                           \n27 \n3 Napolitano Memo, Declaration of Dae Keun Kwon, Dkt. 16-4, ¶ 10, Ex. 9, at \n28  1. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 12 of 17   Page ID #:1870\n1  Memo, by its own terms, has no application to the DACA program”); Class PI Mot. at \n2  4; see also Second Declaration of Katrina Eiland ¶ 9, Ex. 1 (USCIS correspondence \n3  confirming that “USCIS cannot apply the new February 2017 Kelly memo standards \n4  to DACA requests.”). Defendants would therefore violate their own rules in deeming \n5  DACA-eligible individuals enforcement priorities and terminating on that basis. In \n6  sum, because by virtue of their continued DACA eligibility, class members are by \n7  definition not enforcement priorities under the DACA rules, Defendants’ contention \n8  as to the SOP’s treatment of those deemed an “enforcement priority” is irrelevant.4 \n9  Defendants appear to suggest, incorrectly, that Plaintiffs are not entitled to a \n10  classwide injunction because in at least some cases involving “Egregious Public \n11  Safety” issues, automatic termination is permitted under the DACA rules. Class Cert. \n12  Opp. at 16-17. Even assuming Defendants were correct, this argument would only \n13  affect Plaintiffs’ APA claim alleging violation of the SOPs; Plaintiffs would still be \n14  entitled to classwide relief on their other APA claims, as well as on the due process \n15  claim. Moreover, Defendants’ suggestion is wrong. As this Court has held, there is \n16  “only one narrow circumstance in which automatic termination based on an NTA is \n17  appropriate—when an NTA is issued after USCIS determines that a disqualifying \n18  offense or public safety concern is deemed to be ‘Egregious Public Safety’ (‘EPS’).” \n19  PI Order at 11. The Court held that automatic termination is not appropriate, however, \n20                                             \n4 In any event, Defendants’ interpretation of the SOPs section referencing \n21 \nenforcement priorities cannot be reconciled with other relevant sections of the SOPs \n22  or DHS guidance. Indeed, as explained above, the SOPs section entitled “Criminal \nNational Security, or Public Safety Issues” requires notice and an opportunity to \n23 \nrespond in all non-EPS cases. See PI Order at 11; Dkt. 16-24 at 137. Moreover, it \n24  could not be more crystal clear that in cases involving enforcement priorities, a \nspecified process requiring notice is mandated: the section is entitled, “Enforcement \n25 \nPriority – DACA Not Automatically Terminated.” Dkt. 16-24 at 138 (emphasis \n26  added). See also id. (providing that USCIS can determine whether to initiate \ntermination by issuing a Notice Of Intent to Terminate, and then “[i]f it is determined \n27 \nthat the case warrants final termination, the officer will issue . . .Termination Notice[:] \n28  Enforcement Priority; Not Automatically Terminated”) (internal brackets omitted). \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 13 of 17   Page ID #:1871\n1  where the “NTA was issued on the basis of presence without admission, not EPS.” Id. \n2  Accord Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5-6. Yet Defendants’ policy is to \n3  terminate automatically regardless of whether the NTA is based on EPS—in violation \n4  of Defendants’ own rules. In any event, as Plaintiffs have explained, the Court could \n5  modify the class definition to create a subclass of noncitizens whose Termination \n6  Notices have stated or will state that the reason for the termination is EPS. Class Cert. \n7  Reply at 6 & n. 5. As a result, there is no question that for all class members (i.e. \n8  individuals who have not been convicted of a disqualifying offense and whose \n9  termination notices do not assert an EPS concern), automatic termination violates the \n10  DACA rules.  \n11  The government’s failure to explain its changes of position in terminating each \n12  class member’s DACA is also arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. See \n13  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). The government offers no \n14  authority for its view that an agency may change its position in individual cases with \n15  no explanation. Class PI Opp. at 22. In fact, as this Court has held, whenever an \n16  agency “chang[es] position,” Fox, 556 U.S. at 515, it is “required to provide a \n17  reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding the facts and circumstances that underlay its \n18  previous decision.” PI Order at 10 (quoting Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of \n19  Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 968 (9th Cir. 2015)) (other citations and internal quotation \n20  marks omitted). See also, e.g., California Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Federal Energy \n21  Regulatory Comm’n, 879 F.3d 966, 978 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding that the Federal \n22  Energy Regulatory Commission had acted arbitrarily in departing—in individual cases \n23  and without explanation—from a previous decision to grant utility company requests \n24  only under particular circumstances); LeMoyne-Owen Coll. v. NLRB, 357 F.3d 55, 61 \n25  (D.C. Cir. 2004) (holding that agencies must explain themselves when “a party makes \n26  a significant showing that analogous cases have been decided differently”). \n27  The government does not address this Court’s holding or the controlling \n28  authority on which it relied. Instead, the government asserts that it may change its \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 14 of 17   Page ID #:1872\n1  position arbitrarily, with no explanation, as long as it has a practice of doing so. Class \n2  PI Opp. at 23 (relying on USCIS’s practice—contrary to its own rules—of automatic \n3  termination without explanation). In other words, the government takes the position \n4  that an agency may violate the APA so long as it has a consistent practice of doing so. \n5  This argument is self-refuting. Unsurprisingly, the lone case on which the government \n6  relies does not stand for this remarkable proposition. See Sierra Club v. Bureau of \n7  Land Management., 786 F.3d 1219, 1226 (9th Cir. 2015) (finding no Fox violation \n8  where the agency altered its analysis but did not reverse any decision).5 The Court \n9  should again hold that the government’s unexplained reversal violates the APA. \nIII.  THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES NO RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ \n10 \nDUE PROCESS ARGUMENT THAT ONCE GRANTED DACA, \n11  RECIPIENTS ARE ENTITLED TO A FAIR PROCESS FOR \nREVOCATION. \n12 \nWhile the Court can grant Plaintiffs’ motion based on their non-constitutional \n13 \nAPA claims, the government notably fails to address Plaintiffs’ core constitutional \n14 \nargument. That procedural due process argument is based on a controlling line of \n15 \ncases holding that, even absent a claim of entitlement to an important benefit, once it \n16 \nis conferred, recipients have a protected property interest that requires a fair process \n17 \nbefore the government may take that benefit away. See Class PI Mot. at 17 (citing, \n18 \ninter alia, Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971)); see also Arreola PI Mot., Dkt. \n19 \n16-2, at 18-21; Arreola PI Reply at 19-21. Thus, even though DACA is ultimately \n20 \ndiscretionary, once granted, the government cannot take it away without due process.  \n21 \n22 \n                                           \n23 \n5 Chemehuevi Indian Tribe v. Brown, No. ED CV 16-1347-JFW (MRWx), 2017 \n24  WL 2971864, at *8 n.9 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2017), did not even concern a claim that a \nchange in position was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The footnote cited by \n25 \nthe government, Class PI Opp. at 23, discusses the unrelated question of when an \n26  agency practice interpreting a statute can receive deference under Skidmore v. Swift & \nCo., 323 U.S. 134 (1944). See also PI Order at 12 (noting that Skidmore only requires \n27 \ndeference to the extent that an agency interpretation has “the power to persuade”) \n28  (citation and quotation marks omitted). \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 15 of 17   Page ID #:1873\n1  The government makes no attempt to refute this principle. Instead, it cites cases \n2  holding that, as a general matter, discretionary benefits do not give rise to a protected \n3  property interest. See Class PI Opp. at 13-16 (citing cases). But the Plaintiffs never \n4  make that contention, and none of those cases involve the revocation of a \n5  discretionary benefit that has already been conferred. \n6  The government further argues that the DACA guidance does not give rise to a \n7  protected property interest, see Class PI Opp. at 15-17, but again this argument is a \n8  straw man. The Plaintiffs do not argue that the DACA program itself establishes a \n9  protected interest. Instead, they argue only that, having previously granted them \n10  DACA, the government may not strip them of it without a fair procedure. Class PI \n11  Mot. at 16-19. Defendants’ remaining arguments likewise miss the mark. The \n12  Plaintiffs do not premise their claim on a substantive “right to work in the United \n13  States,” nor have they alleged a “right to DACA.” Class PI Opp. at 15.6 \n14  Finally, the government does not even attempt to suggest that its actions satisfy \n15  due process. Indeed, the government could not since—as it concedes, see Class PI \n16  Opp. at 2-3—the Plaintiffs were stripped of DACA without any process whatsoever. \n17  Indeed, USCIS already provides a procedure whereby DACA recipients are afforded a \n18  reasoned explanation for its actions and an opportunity to present arguments and \n19 \n20                                             \n6 The government also half-heartedly suggests, incorrectly, that a federal \n21 \nregulation provides for automatic termination of a DACA EAD when an NTA is filed \n22  with the immigration court. Class PI Opp. at 16 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii)).  \nAlthough the cited regulation provides for termination in some cases, it also contains a \n23 \nspecific exception stating that “this shall not preclude the authorization of \n24  employment pursuant to § 274a.12(c) of this part where appropriate.”  8 C.F.R. § \n274a.14(a)(1)(ii) (emphasis added). See Alfaro-Orellana v. Ilchert, 720 F. Supp. 792, \n25 \n794 (N.D. Cal. 1989) (recognizing that 8 C.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii) “creates an \n26  exception for appropriate work authorizations under § 274a.12(c)). In any event, the \nSupreme Court has held that the government “may not constitutionally authorize the \n27 \ndeprivation of [a property] interest, once conferred, without appropriate procedural \n28  safeguards.”  Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541– 42 (1985). \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 16 of 17   Page ID #:1874\n1  evidence. See Class PI Mot. at 19. In sum, the termination of Plaintiffs’ DACA and \n2  EADs in the absence of a fair process violates their procedural due process rights. \n3   \n \n4 \nIV.  THE REMAINING INJUNCTION FACTORS FAVOR THE \nPLAINTIFFS. \n5 \nThe government does not dispute that the harm it is causing the Plaintiffs is \n6 \nirreparable. Indeed, it could not do so given that this Court has already held that the \n7 \nrevocation of DACA imposes irreparable harm. PI Order at 13-14. The Court relied on \n8 \ncontrolling Ninth Circuit case law holding that undermining DACA recipients’ \n9 \nemployment constitutes irreparable harm. See id.; see also Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. \n10 \nBrewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014); Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at \n11 \n*6 (finding irreparable harm caused by loss of employment and “sense of well-being” \n12 \nfollowing termination of DACA); Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1343-44. \n13 \nThe government also does not dispute that requiring it to comply with the APA \n14 \nand the Constitution would serve the public interest, as this Court has held. See PI \n15 \nOrder at 14-15. Indeed, the only government interest that it names—“the need for \n16 \nDefendants to pursue removal for individuals like the named Plaintiffs,” Class PI Opp. \n17 \nat 24—concerns the Plaintiffs’ removal proceedings, which are not at issue in this \n18 \ncase. And although the government certainly has a general interest in the enforcement \n19 \nof the immigration laws, the agencies administering those laws are required to act \n20 \nlawfully. In sum, the remaining factors support a preliminary injunction.7 \n21 \n \n22 \n23 \n                                           \n24  7 Defendants’ passing suggestion that enjoining the termination of the \nPlaintiffs’ DACA would require a mandatory injunction is incorrect. Class PI Opp. at \n25 \n5. A prohibitory injunction maintains the status quo, which is defined as “not simply \n26  any situation before the filing of the lawsuit, but rather the last uncontested status that \npreceded the parties’ controversy.” Dep’t. of Parks & Recreation v. Bazaar Del \n27 \nMundo Inc., 448 F.3d 1118, 1124 (9th Cir. 2006). Here, that “last uncontested status” \n28  is when the Plaintiffs had DACA and EADs.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 58   Filed 02/12/18   Page 17 of 17   Page ID #:1875\n1  CONCLUSION \n2  For these reasons, the Court should grant (1) Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Classwide \n3  Preliminary Injunction, (2) vacate and enjoin Defendants’ unlawful revocation of \n4  Plaintiffs Gil’s and Moreira’s DACA and EADs, as well as the DACA and EADs of \n5  proposed class members whose DACA has been terminated since January 19, 2017, \n6  and (3) enjoin Defendants from terminating Plaintiffs’ and proposed class members’ \n7  DACA and EADs pursuant to their unlawful policies in the future. \n8  Dated: February 12, 2018     Respectfully submitted, \n \n9 \n/s/ Jennifer Chang Newell \n10  Jennifer Chang Newell \nKatrina L.

Dkt. No. 16-2, Memorandum of Law, at 7. Plaintiff’s motion for a \n88 preliminary injunction requires this Court to reject decades of precedent to recognize \n99 alleged rights and privileges that have never existed for Plaintiff and similarly situated \n1111 individuals. Plaintiff, who has benefitted from the Government’s discretion to remain and \n1122 work in the United States despite having no lawful status, had no ongoing expectation to \n1133 the continuation of that grace.  \n1144 Most importantly, Plaintiff’s DACA was automatically terminated by the issuance \n1155 of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) sub-\n1166 agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”). Filing of the NTA with the \n1177 appropriate Department of Justice (DOJ) immigration court commences removal \n1188 proceedings, see 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.13, 1003.14, and results in the immediate termination \n1199 of employment authorization for aliens granted deferred action, whether through DACA \n2200 or otherwise. See 8 CFR § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii). Plaintiff cannot challenge in district court \n2211 the commencement of removal proceedings by attacking the consequential termination of \n2222 his DACA or EAD grant. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) (precluding judicial review in district \ncourt of “any cause or claim . . . arising from the decision or action . . . to commence \n2233\nproceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders . . . .”). Thus, to the extent \n2244\nPlaintiff has any viable legal claims arising from the “decision[s] or action[s]” of DHS in \n2255\nthis case, they must be raised initially in immigration court and then, following \n2266\nadministrative appeal, through a petition for review filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n2277\nthe Ninth Circuit. See U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) (requiring that “[j]udicial review of all \n2288\n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n1 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 13 of 43   Page ID #:524\n \n11 questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and \n22 statutory provision, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an \n33 alien” must be made through a petition for review); J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, \n44 1031 (9th Cir. 2016) (applying this statutory channeling provision in the context of a \n55 Fifth Amendment claim). \n66 In order to prevail on a motion seeking a preliminary injunction, Plaintiff “must \n77 establish” that he is likely to succeed on the merits of his claim, that he is likely to suffer \n88 irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted, that the balance of equities is in his \n99 favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. Winter v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, \n1111 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot prevail on his motion because he is \n1122 not likely to succeed in obtaining review of DHS’ discretionary decision to issue an NTA \n1133 to place him in removal proceedings, and thereby automatically terminate his DACA and \n1144 related EAD. Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff asks the Court to grant a permanent \n1155 injunction at this initial stage of proceedings requiring that Plaintiff’s DACA and \n1166 employment authorization – “remain valid until August 19, 2018, so long as Plaintiff \n1177 continues to satisfy the eligibility requirements of the DACA program” – demands a \n1188 mandatory injunction that impinges on Defendants discretion – for which Plaintiff cannot \n1199 establish that the facts and the law “clearly favor” his position, which is in direct conflict \n2200 with Supreme Court precedent. \n2211 I.  Overview of Deferred Action and the DACA Policy \n2222 The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) charges the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity “with the administration and enforcement” of the INA and “all other laws \n2233\nrelating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.” 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1). \n2244\nIndividuals are removable if, inter alia, “they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have \n2255\nbeen convicted of certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law.” Arizona v. \n2266\nUnited States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012); see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a), 1227(a). The \n2277\nfederal government cannot practicably remove every removable alien. Rather, “[a] \n2288\n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n2 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 14 of 43   Page ID #:525\n \n11 principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration \n22 officials.” Arizona, 132 S. Ct. at 2499. DHS, “as an initial matter, must decide whether it \n33 makes sense to pursue removal at all.” Id. “At each stage the Executive has discretion to \n44 abandon the endeavor.” Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, \n55 483 (1999) (“AADC”). Like other agencies exercising enforcement discretion, DHS must \n66 balance a number of factors that are within its expertise. See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. \n77 821, 831 (1985).  \n88 Deferred action is “a regular practice” in which the Secretary exercises her \n99 discretion “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [his] own convenience,” to notify an \n1111 alien of a non-binding decision to forbear from seeking his removal for a designated \n1122 period. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 483-84; 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14) (“an act of \n1133 administrative convenience to the government which gives some cases lower priority”). \n1144 Through “[t]his commendable exercise in administrative discretion, developed without \n1155 express statutory authorization,” AADC, 525 U.S. at 484 (citations omitted), a removable \n1166 individual may remain present in the United States so long as DHS continues to forbear. \n1177 Deferred action does not confer lawful immigration status or provide any defense \n1188 to removal. Cf. Chaudhry v. Holder, 705 F.3d 289, 292 (7th Cir. 2013) (discussing the \n1199 difference between “unlawful presence” and “unlawful status” as two distinct concepts). \n2200 An individual with deferred action remains removable at any time, and DHS has the \n2211 discretion to revoke deferred action unilaterally. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 484-85. \n2222 On June 15, 2012, DHS issued a memorandum entitled, “Exercising Prosecutorial \n2233 Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children” \n2244 (“Napolitano Memo”). See Dkt. No. 16-13, Pl. Exhibit 9. That memorandum outlines a \n2255 policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) that is available to a \n2266 certain subset of individuals unlawfully present in this country. The DACA Memo states, \n2277 “[t]his memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway to \n2288 citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n3 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 15 of 43   Page ID #:526\n \n11 rights.” Id. at 3. The memo does not address the topics of arrest by DHS or the grounds \n22 that DHS will consider in terminating deferred action. Rather, the memo directs U.S. \n33 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n44 (“CBP”) agents to “immediately exercise their discretion, on an individual basis” to \n55 determine whether to issue an NTA or defer action, without reference to whether an \n66 individual already has deferred action. Id. (“With respect to individuals who meet the \n77 above criteria, ICE and CBP should immediately exercise their discretion, on an \n88 individual basis, in order to prevent low priority individuals from being placed into \n99 removal proceedings.”). Thus, CBP or ICE have discretion to issue an NTA if the facts \n1111 and circumstances available at the time an alien is encountered counsel against the \n1122 continuation of deferred action, including where there is a criminal offense or public \n1133 safety concern presented. Id. \n1144 In mid-August 2012, USCIS published on its website a webpage entitled, \n1155 “Frequently Asked Questions,” which is now archived on the USCIS webpage. See Dkt. \n \n1166 No. 16-23, Pl. Exhibit 19. These FAQs provide guidance on the DACA policy and state, \n1177 “DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be terminated \n1188 at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.” Id. at \n1199 Q:27. The FAQs also explain that the phrase “national security or public safety threat” \n2200 includes but is not limited to “gang membership, participation in criminal activities, or \n2211 participation in activities that threaten the United States.” See id. at Q:65. The Form I-\n2222 821D, entitled, “Instructions for Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood \n2233 Arrivals” states, “[i]ndividuals who receive deferred action will not be placed into \n2244 removal proceedings or removed from the United States for a specified period of time, \n2255 unless the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) chooses to terminate the deferral.” \n2266 See Exhibit A, Form I-821D Instructions (January 9, 2017 version, with no changes to the \n2277 relevant content).   \n2288 Through an internal guidance document entitled the “National Standard Operating \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n4 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 16 of 43   Page ID #:527\n \n11 Procedures (SOP); Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA),” USCIS has \n22 provided its officers with procedural guidance for terminating deferred action in three \n33 circumstances, one of which includes issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate (“NOIT”) \n44 and providing a chance for a DACA recipient to respond, and two in which such notice \n55 and an opportunity to respond is not required. See Dkt. No. 16-24, Pl. Exhibit F, National \n66 Standard Operating Procedures, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“SOP”) (Aug. \n \n77 28, 2013); id. at Appendix I.  \n88 Nothing in the Napolitano Memorandum limits CBP or ICE from exercising their \n99 authority to issue an NTA. Rather, pursuant to the DACA SOP and Appendix I, when \n1111 USCIS discovers certain conduct that suggests DACA should be terminated, USCIS \n1122 should refer such conduct to ICE, who may issue an NTA that automatically terminates \n1133 DACA, with no additional notice or opportunity to respond. See Dkt. No. 16-24. USCIS \n1144 then generally sends a “Notice of Action” to the individual informing him that his \n1155 deferred action and employment authorization terminated automatically as of the date the \n1166 NTA was issued. Id. at 42. This “Notice of Action” serves an administrative purpose to \n1177 inform the DACA recipient that his DACA and employment authorization were already \n1188 automatically terminated due to issuance of an NTA. The Notice of Action does not itself \n1199 effectuate the termination of DACA and employment authorization. \n2200 On September 5, 2017, DHS announced a plan to end the DACA policy in an \n2211 orderly fashion. See Dkt. No. 16-18, Pl. Exhibit 14, “Memorandum on Rescission of \n2222 Deferred Action for Child Arrivals” from Elaine C. Duke, Acting Secretary of Homeland \n2233 Security, to ICE, CBP, and USCIS (Sept. 5, 2017) (“Duke Memo”). The memorandum, \n2244 inter alia, provides that DHS will “adjudicate – on an individual, case by case basis – \n2255 properly filed pending DACA renewal requests and associated applications for \n2266 Employment Authorization Documents . . . from current beneficiaries whose benefits \n2277 will expire between the date of this memorandum and March 5, 2018 that have been \n2288 accepted by the Department as of October 5, 2017.” Id. (emphasis added).  \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n5 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 17 of 43   Page ID #:528\n \nII.  Factual Background \n11\nPlaintiff alleges he was granted deferred action and employment authorization \n22\npursuant to DACA in 2012 and again in 2014; and that he requested renewal of DACA in \n33\n2016 and was granted deferred action and employment authorization, effective through \n44\nAugust 19, 2018. Dkt. No. 16-2 at 6. Plaintiff also acknowledges the DACA approval \n55\nletter advises that “[s]ubsequent criminal activity” is likely to result in termination of \n66\ndeferred action. Id.  \n77\nOn the evening of February 11, 2017, stretching into the morning of February 12, \n88\nBP agents were searching an area of El Cajon, California, near the United States/Mexico \n99\nInternational Boundary (hereinafter “the border”) known for unlawful border crossings, \n1111\nafter finding indications that undocumented immigrants had likely recently crossed the \n1122\nborder. See Exhibit B, DHS Memorandum of Investigation, Agent Statement of BP Agent \n1133\nF.O.,1 dated February 12, 2017 (“F.O. Memo”); Exhibit C, DHS Memorandum of \n1144\nInvestigation, BP Agent I.J., dated February 13, 2017 (“I.J. Memo”).  \n1155\nAround midnight, the border patrol agents encountered Plaintiff behind the wheel \n1166\nof a “vehicle parked on the side of the road with its lights out.” Id. The passenger in the \n1177\nvehicle, Mr. R., was later identified as an undocumented immigrant. Id. According to one \n1188\nagent, subsequent to encountering Plaintiff and Mr. R, four undocumented immigrants \n1199\nwere detained in close proximity to Plaintiff’s vehicle, and the “identified . . . smuggler \n2200\nfor that event . . . shows a prior apprehension event” with Mr. R. See Exhibit D, DHS \n2211\nReport of Investigation, Border Patrol Agent A.R., dated February 12, 2017 (“A.R. \n2222\nReport”), at 4. CBP also positively linked Mr. R.’s phone to the smuggler’s cell phone, \n2233\nand concluded Plaintiff and Mr. R. were likely present in that location to pick up the four \n2244\nundocumented immigrants. Id.  \n2255\n2266\n2277                                                  \n2288 1 Due to the public nature of this case, names of the federal agency agents and officers are redacted here \nand in the attached exhibits.   \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n6 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 18 of 43   Page ID #:529\n \n11 In his initial encounter with the agents, Plaintiff first stated “he picked up [Mr. R.] \n22 in El Cajon, California and was going to take him to Tijuana, Mexico.” Exhibit C. \n33 However, Plaintiff “then changed his story and claimed that he was just going back home \n44 to Hollywood, California.”2 Id. Upon further questioning, Plaintiff stated he had just \n55 recently picked up Mr. R. “on the side of the road,” that he knew Mr. R. was \n66 undocumented, and that Plaintiff “was going to get paid $100 USD to pick up an \n77 unknown amount of illegal aliens.” Id.; see also Exhibit B. Because Plaintiff and Mr. R. \n88 gave conflicting stories, the Border Patrol agents arrested both men and transported them \n99 to a Border Patrol processing center, where both men separately waived their Miranda \n1111 rights and were administered an oath before being interviewed. Exhibit C; Exhibit E, \n1122 Transcript of Border Patrol Agent interview with Plaintiff on February 12, 2017, at 2-6; \n1133 Exhibit F, Statement of Border Patrol Agent J.H. Regarding Recorded Statement, dated \n1144 February 12, 2017 (“J.H. Statement”).  \n1155 In his recorded interview, under oath, and after going through a number of other \n1166 stories, Plaintiff stated that he had been asked by a friend to pick up the friend’s cousin, \n1177 Mr. R, from a hotel in Sun Valley, California and drive the passenger to El Cajon to pick \n1188 up the passenger’s cousin and uncle.3 See Exhibits E at 28-34, 37-40; F. Plaintiff admitted \n1199 he was aware he was picking up undocumented immigrants. Id.; see also Exhibit D at 3. \n2200\n                                                 \n2211 2 The Court may take judicial notice of the fact that Plaintiff’s home in Hollywood, California is \napproximately 140 miles north of El Cajon, California, and the drive from one city to the other takes \n2222\napproximately three hours. Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689 (9th Cir. 2001) overruled on \n2233 other grounds by Galbraith v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[A] court may take \njudicial notice of ‘matters of public record.’”) (citation omitted).  \n2244\n3 The Court may also take judicial notice of the fact that Sun Valley, California is near Plaintiff’s home in \n2255 Hollywood, California, thus also approximately 140 miles and 3 hours north of El Cajon, California, where \nPlaintiff first alleged to have picked up the passenger. Lee, 250 F.3d at 689. Plaintiff establishes a similar \n2266\ngeographic setting in a declaration filed with his Complaint, wherein he states he drove “for about three \nand a half hours” to get from “Sun Valley, near North Hollywood” to “an address near San Diego,” where, \n2277\nupon arrival, he was confronted by CBP. See Dkt. No. 16-3, Declaration of Jesus Alonso Arreola Robles, \n2288 at ¶¶ 19, 20, 22. San Diego, California, is approximately 15 miles from El Cajon, California.  \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n7 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 19 of 43   Page ID #:530\n \n11 At the first encounter on the side of the road, Plaintiff told agents he was to be paid $100 \n22 for his services, see Exhibit C, but in his interview Plaintiff stated it was only $40, before \n33 ultimately admitting he was to receive $600 for making the trip. Exhibit E at 11, 18, 30, \n44 39; Exhibit F. The Government declined to seek Plaintiff’s criminal prosecution under 8 \n55 U.S.C. § 1324,4 but CBP did initiate removal proceedings against him. Exhibit D at 4.5  \n66 On February 12, 2017, CBP issued Plaintiff an NTA charging him as inadmissible \n77 to the United States based on his presence without admission or parole pursuant to 8 \n88 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). See Exhibit G, Form I-862, Notice to Appear, dated February \n99 12, 2017 (date stamped as filed with the Immigration Court on February 23, 2017); see \n1111 also Dkt. No. 16-11, Pl. Exhibit 7, Form I-213 Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien, dated \n1122 February 13, 2017, at 8 (“Arreola was processed administratively for [8 U.S.C. § 1324] Alien \n1133 Smuggling. Arreola has been approved as a Federal Interest Removal by San Diego Sector \n1144 Chief Patrol Agent R[.] B[].”).  \n1155 On March 2, 2017, an immigration judge held a custody determination hearing and \n1166 granted Plaintiff release from immigration detention on $2,500 bond.6 Dkt. 16-10, Pl. \n1177 Exhibit 10, Bond Hearing Transcript at 59. On March 6, 2017, Plaintiff received a Notice \n1188 of Action from USCIS, notifying him that his DACA and EAD were “terminated \n1199\n                                                 \n2200 4 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) provides criminal penalties for “[a]ny person who[,] knowing or in reckless \ndisregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, \n2211\ntransports, or moves or attempts to transport or move such alien within the United States by means of \n2222 transportation or otherwise, in furtherance of such violation of law; . . . (v)(I) engages in any conspiracy \nto commit any of the preceding acts, or (II) aids or abets the commission of any of the preceding acts . . . .” \n2233\n5 Plaintiff now alleges another new version of the facts in his sworn declaration. Plaintiff claims a friend \n2244 offered him $600 to drive the friend’s cousin from the Los Angeles area to the San Diego area to pick up \nthe friend’s uncle and another cousin, and bring them back to the Los Angeles area. Dkt. No. 16-2 at 7. \n2255\nPlaintiff now asserts the person he picked up, arguably Mr. R, entered an address near San Diego, \n2266 California, into Plaintiff’s GPS and Plaintiff drove them there without knowing where he was going or \nthat the people he was picking up were undocumented immigrants. Id.  \n2277\n6 As explained in greater detail below in Section II(B)(ii)(b)(5), the transcript of the bond hearing shows \n2288 Plaintiff misrepresented to the immigration judge a number of key facts regarding his interviews with the \nCBP agents on the night of his arrest. \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n8 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 20 of 43   Page ID #:531\n \n11 automatically as of the date [his] NTA was issued.” See Dkt. No. 16-12, Pl. Exhibit 8, \n22 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Notice of Action to Jesus Alonso Arreola \n33 Robles Re I-821D, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, dated Mar. 6, 2017.   \n44 Eight months later, on October 5, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Complaint seeking an \n55 order restoring his DACA and employment authorization, and requiring Defendants to \n66 provide him with a further explanation for their decision and an opportunity to respond. \n77 See Dkt. No. 1. On October 18, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, \n88 seeking to vacate Defendants’ termination of his DACA and EAD, or in the alternative, \n99 order Defendants to temporarily reinstate his DACA and EAD and provide him an \n1111 opportunity to challenge the termination of his DACA. See Dkt. Nos. 16, 16-2.  \n1122 ARGUMENT \n1133 I.  Standards of Review \n1144 “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative \n1155 positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” Univ. of Texas v. \n1166 Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). As a result, it is generally inappropriate at the \n1177 “preliminary-injunction stage to give a final judgment on the merits.” Id.; see Senate of \nState of Cal. v. Mosbacher, 968 F.2d 974, 978 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that “judgment on \n1188\nthe merits in the guise of preliminary relief is a highly inappropriate result”). \n1199\n  An injunction is “a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should not be granted \n2200\nas a matter of course.” Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 142 (2010). \n2211\nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction “must establish” that: (1) it is likely to \n2222\nsucceed on the merits of its claims; (2) it is likely to suffer irreparable harm absent \n2233\npreliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in its favor; and (4) an injunction is in \n2244\nthe public interest. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20; see also Henry Schein, Inc. v. Cook, 191 F. \n2255\nSupp. 3d 1072, 1076 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (“The applicable legal standard for a motion for a \n2266\ntemporary restraining order is the same as that for a motion for a preliminary \n2277\ninjunction.”). Preliminary injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as \n2288\n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n9 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 21 of 43   Page ID #:532\n \n11 of right, Winter, 555 U.S. at 20, and the party seeking such relief bears the burden of \n22 establishing the prerequisites to this extraordinary remedy. Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, \n33 626 F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010). \n44   Alternatively, a party must show “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a \n55 hardship balance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff,” as well as a likelihood of \n66 irreparable harm, and that the injunction is in the public interest. Alliance for the Wild \n77 Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1132 (9th Cir. 2011). Showing “serious questions \n88 going to the merits” requires a plaintiff to demonstrate a “substantial case for relief on the \n99 merits.” Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 967-68 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n1111   Finally, to the extent that Plaintiff seeks an injunction that “orders a responsible \n1122 party to ‘take action’,” Meghrig v. KFC W., Inc., 516 U.S. 479, 484 (1996), it is a \n1133 mandatory injunction. When granting mandatory injunctive relief, “courts should be \n1144 extremely cautious” and will apply a heightened standard in reviewing whether a plaintiff \n1155 has established a basis for injunctive relief. Stanley v. Univ. of S. Cal., 13 F.3d 1313, \n1166 1319 (9th Cir. 1994) (internal citations omitted). Mandatory injunctions “go[ ] well \n1177 beyond simply maintaining the status quo pendente lite [and] is particularly disfavored.” \n1188 Id. at 1320 (internal citations omitted). In a mandatory injunction request, a moving party \n1199 “must establish that the law and facts clearly favor [their] position, not simply that [they] \n2200 [are] likely to succeed.” Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015). \n2211 II.  Plaintiff Cannot Sustain the Requirements for Preliminary Relief. \n2222 The factors to grant a preliminary injunction are not met here. To start, Plaintiff \ncannot show irreparable harm from the loss of a peripheral benefit in work authorization \n2233\nthat he failed to challenge for eight months. Nor can he establish a likelihood of success \n2244\non the merits of his claim, or that the facts and law clearly favor his position, for two \n2255\nimportant reasons. The first is that, regardless of how Plaintiff frames his argument, both \n2266\nthe APA and REAL ID Act preclude judicial review of the Secretary’s discretionary \n2277\ndecisions, including the decision to initiate removal proceedings and to terminate a grant \n2288\n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n10 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 22 of 43   Page ID #:533\n \n11 of deferred action. Further, any viable claim Plaintiff may have related to his removal \n22 proceedings, including any constitutional challenges, can only be raised in immigration \n33 court, and, if requested, through appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals and then the \n44 appropriate circuit court. Second, even if this Court were to find jurisdiction to consider \n55 Plaintiff’s claims, Plaintiff can establish no procedural or constitutional right to the \n66 additional process he now seeks. Moreover, any procedural failings would not prejudice \n77 Plaintiff where he was caught and admitted to engaging in criminal activity. Where \n88 Plaintiff has offered no evidence or argument to overcome the facts of his criminal \n99 activity, he cannot show that the law and facts clearly favor his position or that there he is \n1111 likely to succeed on his claim that his DACA was wrongfully terminated.  \n1122   A.  Plaintiff Cannot Demonstrate Imminent, Irreparable Harm. \n1133 The harm that Plaintiff alleges in support of his motion arises from the alleged loss \n1144 of opportunity to maintain employment through his EAD, which terminated along with his \n1155 DACA following issuance of the NTA in February 2017. Dkt. No. 16-2 at 21-22. The \n1166 Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion at the outset because the imminence of the harm \n1177 Plaintiff cites is doubtful given the period of time that has elapsed between his loss of \n1188 employment authorization and the filing of this action. See, e.g., Quach v. Bank of Am., \n1199 Nat. Ass’n, No. 12–5037 EJD, 2012 WL 4498873, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2012) \n2200 (finding that an ex parte temporary restraining order to enjoin a foreclosure sale was not \n2211 justified where plaintiffs were aware for months of the potential trustee’s sale). \n2222 Defendants terminated Plaintiff’s DACA eight months ago, and Plaintiff’s failure to raise \nthis action until now casts doubt on his claims of urgent, irreparable harm unless his \n2233\nDACA and employment authorization are reinstated immediately. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 16-\n2244\n2 at 27 (“Time without DACA is ‘productive time irretrievably lost’ that Mr. Arreola \n2255\ncould be spending in his chosen career path . . . .”).  \n2266\nIn addition, the degree of harm Plaintiff alleges stretches beyond the relief \n2277\nprovided by an order maintaining the status quo. Plaintiff asks this Court to grant him a \n2288\n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n11 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 23 of 43   Page ID #:534\n \n11 permanent enjoinder against Defendants terminating his DACA for the remainder of its \n22 full term. See Dkt. No. 16-2 at 7 (emphasis added). While this request for complete relief \n33 is already inappropriately raised in a motion for preliminary injunction, see Mosbacher, \n44 968 F.2d at 978, Plaintiff conflates even the temporary and already extraordinary remedy \n55 of a preliminary, mandatory injunction—one reinstating his DACA for the time necessary \n66 to reach the merits of his claims—with a form of permanent relief he would not receive \n77 even under the most optimal outcome on the merits. Were the Court to conclude, as the \n88 courts in Colotl and Gonzalez did, that it has the jurisdiction to review the procedural \n99 steps leading to a DACA termination, but not the decision itself, the most relief the Court \n1111 could grant is an order to Defendants to cure what the Court interprets as procedural \n1122 defects in the termination process. See Colotl v. Kelly, No. 1:17-CV-1670-MHC, 2017 \n1133 WL 2889681, at *9 (N.D. Ga. June 12, 2017) (“[Section] 1252(g) strips this Court of \n1144 jurisdiction to review the government's ultimate discretionary determination as to \n1155 Plaintiff's DACA status.”); see also Gonzalez v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., No. \n1166 17CV1840 JM(NLS), 2017 WL 4340385, at *4 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017) (finding the \n1177 same).7 \n1188 Thus, the irreparable harm Plaintiff claims of not having his DACA through \n1199 August 2018 is overstated at best.  \n2200  \n2211                                                  \n2222 7 Plaintiff’s reliance on Colotl v. Kelly is misplaced. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 16-2, at 2, 4, 17, 22. Colotl is \ndistinguishable. In addition to being wrongly decided, the termination of DACA there did not result from \n2233\nthe issuance of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”). However, here, Plaintiff’s DACA was automatically \nterminated by the issuance of an NTA, a process squarely supported by relevant procedures. The only \n2244\nother matter raised by Plaintiff, Gonzalez, 2017 WL 4340385, while factually similar to the present matter, \n2255 is also inapposite and wrongly decided. Defendants dispute that court’s findings, and specifically note that \nthe court’s interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) and reliance on Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 969, 978 \n2266\n(9th Cir. 2007) are contrary to J.E.F.M., discussed below. Defendants also note that the court there \nbuffered Gonzalez’s irreparable harm claim as stemming from the announced winding down of DACA \n2277\nwhich compromised his ability to request an extension of DACA prior to October 5, 2017. 2017 WL \n2288 4340385 at *6-7. Here, Plaintiff’s delayed claim of irreparable harm lacks the urgency the Gonzalez court \ninterpreted on those facts.  \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n12 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 24 of 43   Page ID #:535\n \n  B.  Plaintiff is not Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \n11\nWhether viewed as a preliminary or permanent injunction, the Court cannot grant \n22\nPlaintiff relief because he cannot succeed on the merits of his claims. First, this Court \n33\nlacks jurisdiction to review Plaintiff’s challenge to CBP’s discretionary determination to \n44\nissue him an NTA, which had the result of terminating his DACA. Additionally, nothing \n55\nin the APA or constitutional jurisprudence establishes a right to review or constrain \n66\nDHS’s exercise of discretion or to grant Plaintiff procedural rights other than those \n77\navailable to him through his removal proceedings. Finally, even if Plaintiff had a viable \n88\nclaim subject to review in this Court, he has failed to offer sufficient evidence to show he \n99\nis likely to succeed on the merits. \n1111\ni.  This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Review DHS’s Initiation of \n1122\nRemoval Proceedings, and any Judicial Challenges to Removal \n1133 Must be Brought in a Petition for Review. \n1144 a.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction under the APA. \n1155 The APA permits persons aggrieved by final agency action to obtain judicial \n1166 review in federal court where “there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” See 5 \n1177 §§ U.S.C. 702, 704. A reviewing court shall set aside agency action found to be \n1188 “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” \n1199 or “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (D). \n2200 However, the APA also precludes judicial review of agency decisions that are “committed \n2211 to agency discretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). In Heckler v. Chaney, the Supreme \n2222 Court held that “an agency’s decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed \n2233 immune from judicial review under § 701(a)(2).” 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985). \n2244 Individual DACA decisions fall squarely within that category of agency discretion. \n2255 A decision to defer action is committed to agency discretion by law because notifying an \n2266 alien that DHS has decided to forbear from removing him for a designated period is an \n2277 exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and a court has no meaningful standard against which \n2288 to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion to forbear from enforcement for that period. \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n13 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 25 of 43   Page ID #:536\n \n11 See Heckler, 470 F.3d at 830; see also Morales de Soto v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 822, 828 (9th \n22 Cir. 2016) (noting that “the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a type of government \n33 action uniquely shielded from and unsuited to judicial intervention”).8 Argument pursuant \n44 to U.S. ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954), that Defendants failed \n55 to follow their own procedures does not help Plaintiff because the Accardi doctrine is \n66 inapplicable in the context of internal operating guidelines that preserve the exercise of \n77 agency discretion. See Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir. 1987) \n88 (finding amended Operating Instructions were “general statements of policy” because the \n99 instructions preserved the agency’s flexibility and opportunity to make discretionary \n1111 determinations); id. (“a directive must not establish a binding norm and must leave \n1122 agency officials free to consider the individual facts in the various cases that arise and to \n1133 exercise discretion”) (internal citations and quotations omitted). \n1144 For these reasons, Plaintiff cannot establish any likelihood of success on the \n1155 merits. The APA specifically precludes review of the action that Plaintiff challenges – the \ndiscretionary decision to issue an NTA and terminate Plaintiff’s DACA and EAD. \n1166\nMoreover, as the challenged action is discretionary, there is no law to apply.  \n1177\n1188 b. The Court Lacks Jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), as \nAmended by the REAL ID Act. \n1199\nThe issuance of an NTA to an alien is a necessary predicate step to commencing \n2200\nremoval proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). Through the INA, \n2211\nas amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005 and codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), Congress \n2222\nexplicitly precluded judicial review of any challenge arising from any decision or action \n2233\nto commence removal proceedings. That statute states, in relevant part: \n2244\n                                                 \n2255\n8 Plaintiff’s reliance on cases that discuss violations of non-discretionary procedures in agency regulations \n2266 are inapposite where deferred action and related employment authorization are entirely discretionary \nconcepts not tied to statute or regulation. See Dkt. No. 16-2 at 18, 20, citing Singh v. Bardini, No. 09-cv-\n2277 3382, 2010 WL 308807, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2010) & Singh v. Vasquez, No. 08-cv-1901, 2009 WL \n3219266, at *5 (D. Ariz. Sept. 30, 2009), aff’d 448 F. App’x 776 (9th Cir. 2011). \n2288\n \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n14 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 26 of 43   Page ID #:537\n \nExcept as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision \n11\nof law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of Title 28, or any \n22 other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, \nno court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf \n33\nof any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to \n44\ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against \n55 any alien under this chapter.  \n66 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).9 The Supreme Court explained that § 1252(g) was “directed against a \n77 particular evil: attempts to impose judicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.” \n88 AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 n.9. \n99 Applying 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), the Ninth Circuit has held there is no subject matter \njurisdiction to review a decision to grant DACA. See, e.g., Vilchiz-Soto v. Holder, 688 \n1111\nF.3d 642, 644 (9th Cir. 2012); Rodriguez v. Sessions, No. 15-72487, 2017 WL 695192, at \n1122\n*1 (9th Cir. Feb. 22, 2017).10 This precedent applies to the present case and precludes \n1133\njudicial review of the decision to issue an NTA, which terminated Plaintiff’s DACA, and \n1144\nwhich was a predicate step to commencing removal proceedings. See, e.g., Samayoa-\n1155\nMartinez v. Holder, 558 F.3d 897, 901-02 (9th Cir. 2009).  \n1166\nPlaintiff may contend that the present case is distinguishable from these earlier \n1177\ncases because it involves the Government’s decision to issue an NTA, and thereby \n1188\nterminate DACA, rather than a determination as to whether an individual is considered \n1199\nfor DACA in the first place. But nothing in the language of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) supports \n2200\n                                                 \n2211\n9 For example, courts lack jurisdiction to review the timing of the commencement of removal proceedings. \n2222\nSee Chavez-Navarro v. Ashcroft, 57 F. App’x 349 (9th Cir. 2003). Moreover, “[a]s a general  matter . . . \n2233 an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense \nagainst his deportation.” AADC, 525 U.S. at 488, 491. \n2244\n10 This authority is consistent with earlier case law interpreting the 1981 Operating Instructions, a previous \n2255 policy that provided guidelines for the exercise of deferred action.  That authority concluded that district \ncourts lack jurisdiction to review the district director’s decision not to recommend deferred action. \n2266\nRomeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1025 (9th Cir. 1985); see also Carranza, v. I.N.S., 277 F.3d 65, \n72 (1st Cir. 2002) (supporting “general proscription against judicial review of any aspect” of prosecutorial \n2277\ndeliberations) (citing Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607-8 (1985)). Neither Plaintiff nor any recent \n2288 court to address these issues has distinguished DHS’s guidance regarding the DACA policy from the 1981 \nOperating Instructions. \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n15 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 27 of 43   Page ID #:538\n \n11 such a distinction and both decisions are similar in the relevant respect – they both \n22 involve the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Congress had no reason to preclude \n33 judicial review of the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion (where individuals \n44 self-select whether to request DACA in light of agency guidelines) while permitting \n55 judicial review of an agency’s decision to issue an NTA so that it may commence \n66 removal proceedings and thereby terminate DACA (where the agency weighs competing \n77 factors and allocates its resources). See Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831 (discussing the \n88 Executive’s discretion to spend resources on “this violation or another”). If anything, the \n99 decision to issue an NTA, which results in termination of DACA, is more closely \n1111 connected with the central purpose of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) – to prevent “judicial \n1122 constraints on prosecutorial discretion.” See AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 n.9. Thus, decisions \n1133 to issue an NTA and thereby terminate DACA are even further outside the scope of \n1144 judicial review than determinations of whether to grant DACA in the first place.  \n1155   Additionally, the Court should reject, as contrary to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), Plaintiff’s \nattempt to frame his challenge of the Government’s decision to initiate removal \n1166\nproceedings as a challenge to the decision-making process to terminate his DACA. \n1177\nSection 1252(g) is not limited to claims arising from the adjudication of cases. It broadly \n1188\nprecludes judicial review of “cause[s] or claim[s]” that arise from the decision “or action” \n1199\nto “commence proceedings” against any alien. See, e.g., Sissoko v. Rocha, 509 F.3d 947, \n2200\n948-50 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding claim of money damages arose from decision or action to \n2211\ncommence removal proceedings and was, thus, barred by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g)).11 To hold \n2222\n                                                 \n2233\n11 In Sissoko, the Ninth Circuit held that because the plaintiff’s detention arose from the decision to \n2244\ncommence removal proceedings, Bivens jurisdiction was barred by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Sissoko, 509 F.3d \n2255 at 949. The court distinguished between these types of claims and those raised in an earlier Ninth Circuit \ncase discussing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2004). Id. In Wong, the \n2266\nplaintiff’s counsel expressly disclaimed any challenge to the execution of removal and explained that her \nclaims only implicated “actions other than that removal, or the commencement of proceedings . . . .” 373 \n2277\nF.3d at 964 (emphasis original). Thus,  the claims at issue in Wong did not implicate the agency’s \n2288 prosecutorial discretion and did not pose a threat of “obstruction of the institution of removal proceedings \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n16 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 28 of 43   Page ID #:539\n \n11 otherwise would render 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) a dead letter because any alien could seek to \n22 enjoin or otherwise challenge the commencement of removal proceedings through this \n33 type of creative pleading. Lastly, Plaintiff’s claims under the APA are barred by 8 U.S.C. \n44 § 1252(g) regardless of whether they challenge nondiscretionary rather than discretionary \n55 duties, because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) does not distinguish between discretionary and \n66 nondiscretionary duties.12 See Silva v. United States, 866 F.3d 938, 940 (8th Cir. 2017) \n77 (rejecting contention that § 1252(g) applies only to discretionary decisions of the \n88 Secretary, emphasizing that § 1252(g), by its plain language, “makes no distinction \n99 between discretionary and nondiscretionary decisions”); see also Torres-Aguilar v. INS, \n1111 246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that “a petitioner may not create the \n1122 jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by cloaking [a claim] in constitutional \n1133 garb” or “through the facile device of re-characterizing” claims to avoid a clear \n1144 jurisdictional bar). \n1155   In sum, regardless of how Plaintiff seeks to frame the issue, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) \nprecludes judicial review of the Government’s exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. \n1166\nAccordingly, the decisions of DHS to issue an NTA and place Plaintiff in removal \n1177\nproceedings, and thereby terminate DACA, are not subject to judicial review, and the \n1188\nCourt should reject Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary relief.  \n1199\n2200\n2211                                                  \nor the execution of removal orders . . . .” Id. at 970. Wong is clearly distinguishable from the present case \n2222\nin which Plaintiff is directly challenging the decision to issue an NTA, which terminated DACA and \n2233 initiated the commencement of removal proceedings. As a result, his claims are barred  by 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g). See Sissoko, 509 F.3d at 949.  \n2244\n12 To be sure, in other contexts, courts distinguish between discretionary and nondiscretionary duties. For \n2255 example, under 5 U.S.C. § 706(a)(1), a plaintiff can assert an APA claim (akin to a mandamus claim) \nseeking to compel an agency to perform a duty but only if it is a duty compelled by statute (that is, a matter \n2266\nover which the agency has no discretion). See, e.g., Zixiang Li v. Kerry, 710 F.3d 995, 1003 (9th Cir. \n2013). Similarly, there are additional jurisdictional bars contained in different subsections of 8 U.S.C. \n2277\n§ 1252. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 486 (“[M]any provisions of IIRIRA are aimed at protecting the Executive’s \n2288 discretion from the courts – indeed, that can fairly be said to be the theme of the legislation.”) (emphasis \nomitted).  \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n17 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 29 of 43   Page ID #:540\n \nc.  Any Viable Claims Must be Channeled through Plaintiff’s \n11\nRemoval Proceedings and not this Court. \n22\n  To the extent Plaintiff has any viable claims, the REAL ID Act, codified in 8 U.S.C. \n33\n§§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9), bar him from raising his claims in district court. Under a \n44\nstatutory scheme designed to “put an end to the scattershot and piecemeal nature of the \n55\nreview process,” all claims arising from removal proceedings must be raised in \n66\nimmigration court and channeled through the petition for review process. Aguilar v. \n77\nImmigration & Customs Enf’t, 510 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir. 2007). The Ninth Circuit has \n88\naffirmed this channeling requirement without exception. J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d \n99\n1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2016). Section 1252(a)(5), entitled “[e]xclusive means of review,” \n1111\nrequires that “a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals . . . shall be \n1122\nthe sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal . . . .” 8 U.S.C. \n1133\n§ 1252(a)(5). Section 1252(b)(9) provides “[j]udicial review of all questions of law and \n1144\nfact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, \n1155\narising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United \n1166\nStates under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order \n1177\nunder this section.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) (emphasis added); see, e.g., J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d \n1188\nat 1038 (explaining that, even if never raised in removal proceedings, a court of appeals \n1199\nhas the authority to resolve questions of constitutional rights). \n2200\n  These channeling provisions are not limited to challenges to final orders of removal \n2211\nbut preclude review in district court of “any” challenge “arising from any action” taken to \n2222\nremove an alien. See J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1031. The second sentence of Section \n2233\n1252(b)(9) explicitly precludes jurisdiction to review (i) orders, “or [(ii)] such questions \n2244\nof law or fact.” Id. The questions of law and fact described in the preceding sentence \n2255\nmodify those “arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien \n2266\nfrom the United States.” Id. Thus, claims arising from “any action taken” to remove an \n2277\nalien from the United States – including the decision to issue an NTA, a necessary action \n2288\ntoward commencing removal proceedings, and one that automatically terminates DACA – \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n18 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 30 of 43   Page ID #:541\n \n11 are channeled through the petition for review process and cannot be brought in federal \n22 district court. To hold otherwise would effectively excise the words “any action taken” \n33 from the statute. See Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 10; cf. Martinez v. Napolitano, 704 F.3d 620, \n44 623 (9th Cir. 2012) (in the context of an APA claim, ignoring how claim “is framed” for \n55 purposes of determining whether claim must be channeled through the petition for review \n66 process). Congress’s intent was simple: if the issue is one that can be raised in removal \n77 proceedings, and ultimately in a petition for review, then the statute precludes district \n88 court review). See J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1034 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 109-72, at 173 \n99 (statute was “intended to preclude all district court review of any issue raised in a removal \n1111 proceeding)); cf. Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 9-10 (“Congress plainly intended to put an end to \n1122 the scattershot and piecemeal nature of the review process. . . .”). \n1133   This approach effectuates the general rule precluding simultaneous review of a \n1144 question by both an administrative body and a federal court. See Acura of Bellevue v. \n1155 Reich, 90 F.3d 1403, 1408-9 (9th Cir. 1996). Moreover, there is no “general constitutional \nright” for an alien to review prosecutorial deliberations in order to avert or prevent \n1166\nremoval proceedings. See Carranza, 277 F.3d at 72, citing AADC, 525 U.S. at 487-92. \n1177\n  Here, despite framing his argument as a challenge to his DACA termination, \n1188\nPlaintiff challenges the Secretary’s discretionary decision to issue an NTA, which had the \n1199\neffect of terminating his DACA. See Dkt. No. 16-2 at 7, 28 (“Mr. Arreola respectfully \n2200\nasks this Court to . . . vacate Defendants’ unlawful revocation of his DACA and work \n2211\npermit . . . .”). Specifically, Plaintiff argues he has constitutional and procedural interests \n2222\nin deferred action and in employment authorization that are protected by due process and \n2233\nthe APA. Id. at 21-22. But where Plaintiff challenges Defendants’ exercise of \n2244\nprosecutorial discretion to issue an NTA – a predicate step in commencing removal \n2255\nproceedings – which has the effect of terminating deferred action and, upon filing with \n2266\nthe immigration court, employment authorization, his challenge necessarily arises from \n2277\n“action taken or proceedings brought to remove an alien.” See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5); \n2288\n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n19 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 31 of 43   Page ID #:542\n \n11 1252(b)(9). In fact, he is challenging the very validity of the “proceedings.” See AADC, \n22 525 U.S. at 484-85 (explaining what deferred action is).13 \n33 The Ninth Circuit held that taken together, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9) \n44 “mean that any issue – whether legal or factual – arising from any removal-related \n55 activity can be reviewed only through the PFR process.” J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1031 \n66 (emphases in original). Plaintiff may prefer that his constitutional claims be resolved now \n77 rather than at a later date, but his preference provides no basis for this Court to exercise \n88 jurisdiction over claims that are subject to a statutory channeling provision. See id. at \n99 1035-36, 1038. \n1111 By arguing that Plaintiff is constitutionally entitled to deferred action (i.e., that \n1122 DHS must defer acting to remove him) he is, by definition, arguing that DHS is barred \n1133 from acting to remove him. Those claims, at least in these circumstances, must be \n1144 channeled through petitions for review. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 n.9. \n1155 ii.  Nothing in the Constitution or APA Establishes a Right that \nConstrains DHS’s Exercise of Discretion. \n1166\nEven if this Court finds that the INA’s jurisdiction-stripping and channeling \n1177\nprovisions might not preclude review of Plaintiff’s claims, the Court should still deny \n1188\nPlaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief because Plaintiff’s merits claims fail as a matter of \n1199\nlaw. Here, Plaintiff can establish neither a constitutional nor an administrative right to \n2200\nreceive any process regarding the termination or denial of DACA because deferred \n2211\naction is necessarily an exercise of the Executive’s prosecutorial discretion. In fact, DHS \n2222\nacted based on that discretion by issuing an NTA based on factors involving Plaintiff’s \n2233\n2244\n                                                 \n2255\n13 For these reasons, Plaintiff’s reliance on Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 55 (2011) and Villa-Anguiano \n2266\nv. Holder, 727 F.3d 873 (9th Cir. 2013), to support his constitutional claims is misplaced. Dkt. No. 16-2 \nat 14. While the courts reviewing final orders of removal can consider the application of due process with \n2277\nregard to an exercise of discretion, Congress specifically gave circuit courts that authority pursuant to 8 \n2288 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) to consider “constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for \nreview.” \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n20 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 32 of 43   Page ID #:543\n \n11 criminal activity, which put Plaintiff into removal proceedings and had the effect of \n22 terminating his DACA. See Dkt. Nos. 16-7, 16-11, 16-12. \n33 a.  Termination of DACA does not Infringe upon an Established \nConstitutional Interest. \n44\nFirst, the mere fact that an individual alleges an injury does not result in a loss of \n55\nliberty. Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 712 (1976). The cases on which Plaintiff relies to \n66\nsupport an infringement on his liberty interest are inapposite. In Morrissey v. Brewer, \n77\n408 U.S. 471 (1972), the Supreme Court considered the right of parolees to remain at \n88\nliberty as long as the conditions of parole were not violated. However, Plaintiff cannot \n99\nallege that his actual liberty is presently at issue.  \n1111\nPlaintiff’s claims regarding the right to support his family conflict with the Ninth \n1122\nCircuit’s determination that there is no “right to family unity” to reside in the United \n1133\nStates “simply because other members of their family are citizens or lawful permanent \n1144\nresidents.” De Mercado v. Mukasey, 566 F.3d 810, 816 (9th Cir. 2009). The same goes \n1155\nfor Plaintiff’s claims regarding the right to earn a livelihood because there is no \n1166\nrecognized right of aliens to work in the United States without authorization. See Pilapil \n1177\nv. INS, 424 F.2d 6, 11 (10th Cir. 1970), cert denied, 400 U.S. 908 (1970); WJA Realty \n1188\nLtd. P’ship v. Nelson, 708 F. Supp. 1268, 1273 (S.D. Fla. 1989) (holding that \n1199\nnoncitizens do not have a constitutional right to work without authorization). Thus, \n2200\nthere is no judicial review of the decision to terminate work authorization. See Perales \n2211\nv. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1047-48 (5th Cir. 1990) (“[T]here is nothing in the [INA] \n2222\nexpressly providing for the grant of employment authorization . . . . to aliens who are \n2233\nthe beneficiaries of approved petitions”) (vacating the challenged portion of the \n2244\ninjunction); see, e.g., Kaddoura v. Gonzales, No. C06-1402 RSL, 2007 WL 1521218, at \n2255\n*4-5 (W.D. Wash. May 21, 2007) (finding a lack of judicial review). As a matter of law, \n2266\na plaintiff cannot assert an established constitutional right to DACA or work \n2277\nauthorization.  \n2288\n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n21 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 33 of 43   Page ID #:544\n \nb. Termination of DACA does not Infringe upon a \n11\nConstitutional Interest based on Entitlement. \n22\n“To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an \n33\nabstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He \n44\nmust, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Blantz v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr. \n55\n& Rehab., 727 F.3d 917, 922 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. \n66\nRoth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972); see also Mendez-Garcia v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 655, 665 \n77\n(9th Cir. 2016) (underscoring that aliens cannot claim a cognizable due process interest \n88\nin discretionary immigration relief or benefits). 14 The Supreme Court has held that even \n99\na practice of “generously” granting a “wholly and expressly discretionary state \n1111\nprivilege” does not create a legal entitlement to that benefit. See Gerhart v. Lake Cnty., \n1122\nMont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020-21 (9th Cir. 2011) (“A person’s belief of entitlement to a \n1133\ngovernment benefit, no matter how sincerely or reasonably held, does not create a \n1144\nproperty right if that belief is not mutually held by the government.”) (citations \n1155\nomitted).  \n1166\nA property interest subject to procedural due process protection may arise where \n1177\nsuch interest is secured by “existing rules or understandings that stem from an \n1188\nindependent source . . . .” Roth, 408 U.S. at 577. The independent source can be a \n1199\nstatute, see Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 572-73 (1975); a regulation, see Glenn v. \n2200\nNewman, 614 F.2d 467, 471-72 (5th Cir. 1980), overruled on other grounds by Shearer \n2211\nv. Bowen, 216 F.3d 1080 (5th Cir. 2000); an express or implied contract, see Perry v. \n2222\n2233                                                  \n14 The Ninth Circuit is not alone in finding aliens lack a cognizable Fifth Amendment due process interest \n2244\nin any form of discretionary immigration relief or benefit. See, e.g., Salgado-Toribio v. Holder, 713 F.3d \n2255 1267, 1271 (10th Cir. 2013); Sanchez-Velasco v. Holder, 593 F.3d 733, 737 (8th Cir. 2010); Yuen Jin v. \nMukasey, 538 F.3d 143, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2008); Khan v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 513, 518 (7th Cir. 2008); \n2266\nAhmed v.

Reno, 180 F.3d 1286, 1301 (11th Cir. 1999) (“awarding \nand then revoking discretionary relief does not offend due process”). \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n22 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 34 of 43   Page ID #:545\n \n11 Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601-02 (1972); or a mutually explicit understanding. Id. at \n22 602-03. In a pair of companion cases handed down the same day, the Supreme Court \n33 explained that “government employees can have a protected property interest in their \n44 continued employment if they have a legitimate claim to tenure or if the terms of the \n55 employment make it clear that the employee can be fired only for cause.” Blantz, 727 \n66 F.3d at 922-23 (comparing Roth, 408 U.S. 576-78, with Perry, 408 U.S. at 599-603). \n77 For example, when a professor sued for deprivation of property without due \n88 process after his employment contract was not renewed, the Court found that the \n99 professor lacked a protected property interest in his continued employment because his \n1111 employment contract was for a fixed one-year term. Blantz, 727 F.3d at 922-23 (citing \n1122 Roth, 408 U.S. at 566). Similarly, when a nurse sued over her termination, relying on \n1133 orientation documents that stated “termination can occur as a result of the performance \n1144 review procedures” detailed in the document, the Ninth Circuit concluded she lacked a \n1155 property interest in her continued employment because the documents “do not guarantee \nthat every termination must be preceded by a peer review process or any other specified \n1166\ndepartmental procedures.” Id. at 924.  \n1177\nSimilarly, nothing in the DACA memoranda, public Q&A, or the DACA SOP \n1188\nindicate any promise of benefits or entitlement to initial or continuing deferred action or \n1199\nDACA-based employment authorization. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 16-23 (USCIS FAQ) \n2200\n(“DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be terminated \n2211\nat any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.”). Here, \n2222\nthe DACA guidance and policies made clear that a recipient of DACA has no \n2233\nconstitutionally protected interest in the continuation of DACA or a constitutionally \n2244\nprotected interest in notice prior to termination. Specifically, the 2012 Memorandum \n2255\nstates, “[t]his memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status or pathway \n2266\nto citizenship. Only the Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer \n2277\nthese rights.” Dkt. No. 16-13. In addition, the USCIS FAQs specifically state that \n2288\n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n23 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 35 of 43   Page ID #:546\n \n11 deferred action can be terminated before it expires, explaining, “DACA is an exercise of \n22 prosecutorial discretion and deferred action may be terminated at any time, with or \n33 without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.” Dkt. No. 16-23 at Q:27. \n44 The USCIS FAQs further explain that the phrase “national security or public safety \n55 threat” includes but is not limited to “gang membership, participation in criminal \n66 activities, or participation in activities that threaten the United States.” See id. at Q:65 \n77 (emphasis added).15 Reading these documents in context, a DACA recipient does not \n88 have a protected property interest in the continuation of his or her DACA or DACA-\n99 based employment authorization. Gerhart, 637 F.3d at 1020-21. These policies and \n1111 guidance are consistent with longstanding authority regarding the exercise of \n1122 prosecutorial discretion in the context of immigration law. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 484 \n1133 (recognizing that deferred action is a “commendable exercise in administrative discretion, \n1144 developed without express statutory authorization”).  \n1155 Accordingly, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion for emergency relief because \nhis claims fail as a matter of law.  \n1166\n1177 c.  The APA Affords Plaintiff no Actionable Interest Regarding \nthe Termination of DACA or Employment Authorization. \n1188\nAssuming jurisdiction arguendo, there is no basis to conclude that Defendants \n1199\nfailed to comply with any procedures requiring notice to a DACA recipient before \n2200\nissuing an NTA that terminates DACA, or to issue a notice of the termination of that \n2211\nDACA. The USCIS FAQ specifically states that DACA “may be terminated at any time, \n2222\nwith or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS’s discretion.” Dkt. No. 16-23 at \n2233\nQ:27. Contrary to Plaintiff’s assertions, while USCIS procedural guidance provides \n2244\ngenerally for a review process in certain circumstances when USCIS terminates \n2255\ndeferred action, when DHS terminates deferred action through the issuance of an NTA, \n2266\n                                                 \n2277\n15 Although criminal activity “can” result in termination, it is not the case that “every termination must be \n2288 preceded” by criminal activity. See Blantz, 727 F.3d at 924. The Government retains the discretion to \nterminate DACA for other reasons.  \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n24 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 36 of 43   Page ID #:547\n \n11 there is no requirement to provide notice or an opportunity to respond. See Dkt. No. 16-\n22 2 at 25.  \n33 For example, where CBP or ICE issues a Notice to Appear, the DACA SOP \n44 provides that DACA and the EAD terminate automatically.16 Dkt. No. 16-24 at 38, 42. \n55 CBP or ICE may decide to issue an NTA, and USCIS will generally issue a Notice of \n66 Action informing the individual that his DACA and Employment Authorization \n77 Document terminated automatically due to the NTA. Dkt. No. 16-24 at 42 (“On [Date \n88 NTA served on alien], [ICE] issued you a Notice to Appear (NTA). . . . USCIS is \n99 notifying you that your deferred action as a childhood arrival and your employment \n1111 authorization terminated automatically as of the date your NTA was issued.”). The \n1122 determination to issue the NTA remains within the discretion of the agency. 8 C.F.R. \n1133 § 239.1(a) (“Any immigration officer, or supervisor thereof, performing an inspection of \n1144 an arriving alien at a port-of-entry may issue a notice to appear to such alien.”); see, e.g., \n1155 Villa-Anguiano, 727 F.3d at 878 (discussing historic roots of this discretion). \nPlaintiff’s argument that DHS internal procedures require notice and an \n1166\nopportunity to respond in every DACA termination is incorrect, and it is based on a \n1177\nselective interpretation of those procedures. See, e,g,. Dkt. No. 16-2 at 9, 13. \n1188\nImportantly, the DACA SOP was written by USCIS for USCIS agents and officers, and \n1199\nit does not encroach on the authority of ICE or CBP to arrest, detain, or issue an NTA to \n2200\nan individual. Id. at 9, citing Dkt. No. 16-24 at 16 (“This SOP describes the procedures \n2211\nService Centers are to follow when adjudicating DACA requests.”). In defining DACA \n2222\npolicy, the 2012 DHS memorandum instructed ICE and CBP to “immediately exercise \n2233\ntheir discretion on an individual basis” in determining when to issue an NTA or defer \n2244\n2255\n                                                 \n2266 16 While the DACA SOP states the EAD terminates when the NTA is issued, the EAD regulation states \nEAD termination occurs when the NTA is served on an immigration court. 8 C.F.R. § 274a.14(a)(1)(ii). \n2277\nHere, the NTA issued on February 12, 2017, the NTA was served on the immigration court on February \n2288 23, and Plaintiff received the Notice of Action informing him his DACA and EAD terminated on March \n6. Thus, any discrepancy between the SOP and the regulation did not impact Plaintiff.  \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n25 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 37 of 43   Page ID #:548\n \n11 action. Dkt. No. 16-13. Defendant DHS’s reading of its own authority to provide for \n22 automatic termination of DACA with the issuance of NTAs is well supported by \n33 Defendant’s consistent practice, and is thus “entitled to substantial weight.” See Exhibit \n44 H, Declaration of Ron Thomas at ¶ 4; Chemehuevi Indian Tribe v. Brown, No. \n55 EDCV161347JFWMRWX, 2017 WL 2971864, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2017) (“The \n66 agency's consistent practice of approving compacts with duration provisions . . . in an \n77 area within its expertise is itself entitled to at least traditional deference under Skidmore \n88 v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), due, in part, to the agency's specialized experience \n99 in matters relating to Indian gaming.”). \n1111 Here, Defendants obtained information through Plaintiff’s arrest and detention \n1122 process, including an interview in which Plaintiff first lied about and later admitted to \n1133 his illegal activity. The information before the Border Patrol agents was that: 1) \n1144 Plaintiff was encountered in the middle of the night in a parked car on the side of the \n1155 road, about a mile from the border; 2) in the company of a known smuggler; 3) in close \nproximity to four undocumented immigrants who were intercepted with another \n1166\nsmuggler with ties to Plaintiff’s companion, and; 4) in the course of questioning \n1177\nPlaintiff, including under oath, he lied repeatedly about his knowledge and involvement \n1188\nin the situation. See Exhibits E and F. Defendants reasonably relied on these facts to \n1199\nfind that Plaintiff was involved in a human smuggling operation, and led to the \n2200\ndiscretionary determination to issue an NTA, which simultaneously terminated \n2211\nPlaintiff’s DACA and EAD. The Notice of Action that Plaintiff received following the \n2222\nNTA was drawn directly from Appendix I of the DACA SOP. See Dkt. No. 16-24.  \n2233\n2244 Defendants exercised their discretion to decline to prosecute the criminal charges \n2255 and instead initiated removal proceedings against Plaintiff by issuing an NTA. See \n2266 Exhibit D at 4 (“Prosecution for [8 U.S.C. § 1324] Alien Smuggling was declined for \n2277 ARREOLA.”); id. (“Assistant Chief Border Patrol Agent R[.Y.] approved removal \n2288 proceedings for ARREOLA in the furtherance of the United States Government \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 38 of 43   Page ID #:549\n \n11 interest.”). This process is consistent with the Napolitano Memorandum and consistent \n22 agency practice, and as prescribed in Chapter 14 and Appendix I of the DACA SOP, the \n33 issuance of the NTA immediately terminated Plaintiff’s DACA, with no additional notice \n44 or opportunity to respond required. Per the SOP, the NTA also terminated Plaintiff’s \n55 employment authorization. Thus, Plaintiff has no basis to allege a violation of internal \n66 operating procedures.  \n77 The Court should deny Plaintiff’s requested relief because there is no basis to \n88 conclude that Defendants failed to provide required notice to a DACA recipient before \n99 issuing an NTA or to provide an opportunity to challenge the reasons for the NTA \n1111 issuance.  \n1122 iii.  Plaintiff Cannot Overcome the Significant Facts Supporting the \nDecision to Issue an NTA and Terminate his DACA and EAD.  \n1133\nWere the Court to find jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff’s claim, and further find a \n1144\nprocedural interest in Plaintiff’s DACA and employment authorization, the Court should \n1155\nstill deny the motion because Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any likelihood of \n1166\nsuccess on the merits of his claim. See Earth Island Inst., 626 F.3d at 469 (“the party \n1177\nseeking such relief bears the burden of establishing the prerequisites to this \n1188\nextraordinary remedy.”).  \n1199\nPlaintiff argues that notice and an opportunity to respond to the termination of his \n2200\nDACA would “allow him to demonstrate that CBP’s suspicions were mistaken, as the \n2211\ngovernment’s own immigration judge concluded, and that he has not engaged in any \n2222\ndisqualifying criminal activity (or even been charged with any crime) and remains \n2233\neligible for DACA.”17 Dkt. No. 16-2 at 25. However, Plaintiff has provided no evidence \n2244\n                                                 \n2255\n17 Plaintiff repeatedly mischaracterizes the immigration judge’s determination that the Border Patrol report \n2266\nlacked enough detail to conclude specifically that Plaintiff “admitted to smuggling aliens for financial \ngains” for the purpose of denying bond. See Dkt. No. 16-2 at 59. Here, Plaintiff asserts instead that the \n2277\nimmigration judge “rejected the government’s allegation and concluded that CBP had been mistaken.” Id. \n2288 at 6, 25; see also id. at 19 (the immigration judge “rejected the government’s allegations that Mr. Arreola \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n27 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 39 of 43   Page ID #:550\n \n11 or argument beyond: 1) the assertion that an immigration judge granted him bonded \n22 release from immigration detention; and 2) that he was not criminally prosecuted for his \n33 involvement in transporting smuggled aliens. Id. Neither of Plaintiff’s assertions satisfy \n44 his burden to demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of his claim. \n55 First, the transcript of the bond hearing shows Plaintiff misrepresented to the \n66 immigration judge a number of key facts regarding his interviews with the Border Patrol \n77 agents on the night of his arrest. Plaintiff told the immigration judge that he was \n88 forthcoming with the Border Patrol agents and admitted he was offered $600 to transport \n99 the passenger from Sunny Valley to El Cajon to pick up additional passengers. Dkt. No. \n1111 16-10 at 17. Plaintiff did not inform the judge that he lied at the initial encounter, \n1122 claiming he was offered $100, or that he lied repeatedly under oath in his interview with \n1133 CBP, claiming he was paid only $40. See Exhibits B; E at 11, 18-19. Plaintiff also \n1144 informed the judge he had picked up the passenger in Sun Valley, California, and drove \n1155 the passenger the three and one half hours to the destination, Dkt. No. 16-10 at 18, but did \n1166 not inform the judge that he lied to Border Patrol agents under oath, telling them he only \n1177 recently picked the passenger up nearby. See Exhibits B; E at 10-13, 20, 28. Plaintiff told \n1188 the judge he was not aware the people he was asked to pick up were undocumented, id. at \n1199 17, which the judge relied on to question the veracity of CBP’s conclusion that Plaintiff \n2200 was involved in smuggling. Id. at 59. In fact, Plaintiff stated under oath he was aware the \n2211 people were undocumented. Exhibits B; E at 29-30.  \n2222 Thus, there are a number of critical inconsistencies in Plaintiff’s testimony to the \n2233 immigration judge, and the judge did not review the contradictory evidence in the video \n2244 of Plaintiff’s sworn statement. The transcript of that interview shows Plaintiff was not \n2255 credible in his encounter with CBP and is not credible in the story he now alleges. The \n2266 immigration judge’s limited finding that it was not clear that CBP did not “make a leap” \n                                                 \n2277\nhad committed any criminal conduct.”); id. at 25 (the immigration judge “concluded . . . that he has not \n2288 engaged in any disqualifying criminal activity”); id. at 27 (the immigration judge found “the CBP’s \nallegations against him were unfounded”). \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n28 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 40 of 43   Page ID #:551\n \n11 in finding Plaintiff knew he was being paid to pick up undocumented immigrants is based \n22 on insufficient and inaccurate information, and thus inadequate to show Plaintiff is likely \n33 to prevail on the merits of his claim.  \n44 Plaintiff’s second claim, that he has not been criminally prosecuted, is irrelevant \n55 here. CBP is well within its authority to issue an NTA, which automatically terminates \n66 DACA, based on the substantial circumstantial evidence demonstrating Plaintiff’s \n77 complicity in criminal activity, outlined herein, along with his videotaped admission to \n88 knowingly participating in the criminal activity in exchange for money, and Plaintiff’s \n99 repeated dishonesty about the matter while under oath.18 As Plaintiff points out, “[t]he \n1111 [DACA] approval notice informed Mr. Arreola that his deferred action could be \n1122 terminated if he engaged in “[s]ubsequent criminal activity.” Dkt. No. 16-2 at 11. \n1133 Termination of DACA does not require an indictment or a conviction, and thus the \n1144 absence of such does not establish a likelihood of Plaintiff’s success on the merits here. \n1155 iv.  Plaintiff cannot Show Prejudice from the Termination of his DACA \nand EAD, such that any Additional Process would have Achieved a \n1166\nDifferent Outcome. \n1177\nEven if the Court found merit in Plaintiff’s claim and determined he was entitled to \n1188\ngreater process, Plaintiff would still have to show prejudice, “which means that the \n1199\noutcome of the proceedings may have been affected by the alleged violation.” Zolotukhin \n2200\nv. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation omitted) (emphasis \n2211\nin original). The Ninth Circuit has held that “[w]hen it is necessary to demonstrate \n2222\n2233                                                  \n18  Determinations whether to charge an alien with particular grounds of removability in an NTA are \n2244\nsubject to prosecutorial discretion. See, e.g., Matter of Bahta, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1381, 1391-92 (BIA 2000). \n2255 Similarly, and also responsive to Plaintiff’s claims here, determinations not to pursue criminal prosecution \nare also a matter of prosecutorial discretion for a variety of reasons. See Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. \n2266\nat 607-608 (“Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general deterrence value, the \nGovernment's enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Government's overall enforcement \n2277\nplan  are  not  readily  susceptible  to  the  kind  of  analysis  the  courts  are  competent  to  undertake.”). \n2288 Accordingly, that Plaintiff has not been criminally charged for his conduct and such conduct was not \nasserted as ground of removability here is of no consequence. \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n29 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 41 of 43   Page ID #:552\n \n11 prejudice as a result of a constitutional violation, the alien must show that the inadequate \n22 procedures occurred in a manner so as potentially to affect the outcome of the \n33 proceedings.” Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1044 (9th Cir. 1998) (emphasis added) \n44 (citations omitted). Thus, “there must be plausible scenarios in which the outcome of the \n55 proceedings would have been different, absent the constitutional violation.” Id. (emphasis \n66 added). A similar harmless error standard would apply to finding of a procedural \n77 violation under the APA. Lyon v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf't, 171 F. Supp. 3d \n88 961, 981–82 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (The APA instructs reviewing courts to take “due account \n99 . . . of the rule of prejudicial error.”) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 706). \n1111 Where a procedural error occurs, the doctrine of “harmless error” requires a \n1122 determination that the error “had no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of \n1133 [the] decision reached.” Cal. Wilderness Coal. v. U.S. Dept. of Energy, 631 F.3d 1072, \n1144 1092 (9th Cir. 2011); see also Lyon, 171 F. Supp. 3d at 981–82 (where an agency error \n1155 “did not affect the outcome, if it did not prejudice the petitioner, it would be senseless to \n1166 vacate and remand for reconsideration.”) (citing PDK Laboratories Inc. v. U.S. D.E.A., \n1177 362 F.3d 786, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2004)); see also Kazarian v. U.S. Citizenship and \n1188 Immigration Servs., 596 F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir. 2010) (harmless error where agency \n1199 denied a visa application based on an erroneous interpretation of its regulations, where \n2200 under proper interpretation it still would have been denied). \n2211 Plaintiff claims, with no support, that providing him “a reasoned explanation for \n2222 the government’s actions and an opportunity to present arguments and evidence . . . will \n2233 allow him to demonstrate that CBP’s suspicions were mistaken . . . and that he has not \n2244 engaged in any disqualifying criminal activity (or even been charged with any crime) and \n2255 remains eligible for DACA.” Dkt. No. 16-2 at 25. However, as described herein, \n2266 Defendants relied on significant evidence, including multiple inconsistent statements \n2277 from Plaintiff, in deciding to issue an NTA and therefore terminate his DACA. Where \n2288 Plaintiff has offered nothing more than an immigration judge’s favorable bond \n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n30 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 42 of 43   Page ID #:553\n \n11 determination based on a limited understanding of the facts, Plaintiff fails to establish any \n22 likelihood Defendants would come to a different conclusion regarding the issuance of the \n33 NTA (and resulting termination of DACA), were the Court to order such a re-\n44 adjudication of his claim. \n55 Where Plaintiff cannot show how additional process would alter the decision to \n66 issue an NTA (and therefore terminate DACA), the Court should deny his motion.  \n77 B. The Remaining Preliminary Injunction Factors Favor Defendants. \n88 Where the Government is the opposing party, the balance of equities and public \n99 interest factors merge. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). Defendants have strong \ninterests in enforcing U.S. immigration laws effectively and consistent with the statutory \n1111\nremoval scheme. See AADC, 525 U.S. at 490 (“There is always a public interest in \n1122\nprompt execution of removal orders: The continued presence of an alien lawfully deemed \n1133\nremovable undermines the streamlined removal proceedings IIRIRA established, and \n1144\n“permit[s] and prolong[s] a continuing violation of United States law.”). These interests \n1155\noutweigh the harms alleged by Plaintiff, especially considering the amount of time that \n1166\nhas passed since Defendants first terminated Plaintiff’s DACA through the initiation of \n1177\nremoval proceedings. Moreover, Plaintiff’s effort to reinterpret DHS’s consistent position \n1188\nregarding NTA issuance and DACA termination would create absurd results wherein \n1199\nDHS’ regulations regarding the termination of employment authorization upon the \n2200\ninitiation of removal proceedings would be ignored and individuals could use the fact of \n2211\ntheir continued DACA, while responding to a notice of intent to terminate, to frustrate \n2222\nICE’s removal efforts. \n2233\nFinally, Plaintiff utilized his DACA and EAD to engage in the criminal activity \n2244\nthat led Defendants to initiate his removal. The public interest in this case weighs heavily \n2255\nagainst allowing Plaintiff to maintain a government grace that he may again abuse for the \n2266\npurpose of breaking the law. For these additional reasons, Plaintiff’s motion should be \n2277\ndenied. \n2288\n \n \n5:17-cv-2048-MWF-SHK \n31 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23   Filed 10/30/17   Page 43 of 43   Page ID #:554\n11 CONCLUSION \n22 Where Plaintiff cannot meet the lesser burden of establishing a likelihood of \n33 success on the merits of his claim to be granted a temporary injunction, he surely cannot \n44 meet the higher standard necessary to obtain a permanent reversal of Defendants’ \n55 termination of his DACA through issuance of an NTA. For this reason and the reasons \n66 outlined herein, the Court should deny Plaintiff’s motion and dismiss his claims.  \n77\nDated: October 30, 2017   Respectfully submitted, \n88\n99 CHAD A.

I was wearing a full Border Patrol rough\nduty uniform with badge and insignias clearly displayed.\nAt approximately 12:00 a.m., BPA     advised via service radio, he discovered footprints\nnear the border road heading in a r ction away from the United States/Mexico International\nBoundary.\nAt approximately 12:05 a.m., I responded to assist BPA   on State Route 94 (SR-94) in an area\ncommonly known to Border Patrol Agents as \"Bulldozer.\"   arrived in the area, I started walking\neastbound approximately twenty five yards south from SR-94, near an area commonly known to Border\nPatrol Agents as \"Lone Pine.\" As I walked towards Lone Pine, I noticed a dark colored four door\nvehicle parked on the side of the road with its lights out near the area where I was trying to find\nthe individuals that BPA Oleson was actively tracking.\nAs I approached the vehicle, I observed two individuals sitting inside. I identified myself as a\nUnited States Border Patrol Agent and asked both individuals as to the reason of their presence in\nthe area.\nBoth individuals responded with conflicted stories. At this time, I requested vehicle record checks\nfrom San Diego Sector Border Patrol Tactical Communication Center.  Also, I asked each individual to\nproduce an identification. Only the driver, later id nso Arreola-Robles, provided\na driver license. The passenger later identified as   stated that he did not have\nany identification.\nAt approxima 12:23 a.m., BPA   showed up at the scene to provide assistance.

I have been the Chief of the Office of Security and Fraud (SCO) within the \nService Center Operations Directorate (SCOPS) for U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (USCIS), a component within the U.S. Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS) since 2007.   In this position, I provide oversight and \ndirection to the Background Check Units and Center Fraud Detection Operations \nwithin the Security and Fraud Divisions at the five service centers located in \nCalifornia, Nebraska, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.  Within my Office at SCOPS \n \n1 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23-2   Filed 10/30/17   Page 79 of 81   Page ID\n #:636\n \nI oversee the operations in the National Security Branch and the Fraud Detection \nBranch within SCOPS.   \n2.  I make this declaration on the basis of my personal knowledge and \ninformation made available to me in the course of my official duties. \n3.  In my capacity as Chief of SCO/SCOPS, I am familiar with the DHS \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy that USCIS, in \nconjunction with other immigration components of DHS, has been implementing \nsince June 15, 2012.  In particular, I am familiar with the policies and practices \ngoverning termination of DACA for individual recipients. \n4.  The issuance of a Notice To Appear (NTA) by U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) or U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) \nautomatically terminates DACA.  USCIS sends a Notice of Action informing the \nDACA recipient that his or her DACA, and related Employment Authorization \nDocument, have automatically terminated following the issuance of an NTA by \nICE or CBP.  This has been USCIS’ practice since FY 2013 when such \nterminations began. \n5.  My team conducted preliminary research on DACA termination cases where \nUSCIS had issued a Notice of Action informing the DACA recipient that his or her \nDACA had automatically terminated upon issuance of an NTA by ICE or CBP. \nWe looked at whether USCIS sent the Notice of Action after it learned ICE or CBP \n \n2 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23-2   Filed 10/30/17   Page 80 of 81   Page ID\n #:637\n \nissued an NTA , or USCIS sent a Referral to ICE first, that then resulted in ICE or \nCBP issuing an NTA.  Conducting a more fulsome review of all automatic \nterminations of DACA would be burdensome, because it would involve a manual \nreview of hundreds of cases.  Therefore, my team pulled a small selection of cases \nfrom each fiscal year (FY) since the inception of DACA for which we have \ntermination data available. My team has confirmed that USCIS issued automatic \nDACA termination notices upon CBP or ICE issuance of an NTA at least four \ntimes in FY 2013, once in FY 2014, three times in FY 2015, three times in FY \n2016, and three times in FY 2017.  None of these fourteen cases involved a USCIS \nreferral to ICE prior to issuance of the NTA by CBP or ICE. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-MWF-SHK   Document 23-2   Filed 10/30/17   Page 81 of 81   Page ID\n #:638",

See Dkts. # 39 (“Cert. Mot.”), 40 (“PI\nMot.”).  Defendants Kirstjen Nielsen, James McCament, Mark J. Hazuda, Susan M. Curda,\nThomas D. Homan, David Marin, and Kevin K.

Having considered the moving papers and oral arguments, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’\nmotion for class certification and GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for a classwide preliminary\ninjunction.\nI. Background\nThis action stems from the termination of Plaintiffs’ Deferred Action for Childhood\nArrivals (“DACA”).  They allege that “their permission to live in the United States and\nemployment authorization [have been] arbitrarily stripped away . . . since President Trump took\noffice, without any notice, reasoned explanation, or opportunity to be heard.”  Cert. Mot. 1:5–8.\nA. The DACA Program\nThe Court previously outlined the history and features of the DACA program in its order\ngranting Plaintiff Arreola’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  See Dkt. # 31 (“Arreola\nOrder”), at 1–2.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 1 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 2 of 37   Page ID #:1932\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nDeferred action is a longstanding form of administrative action by which the Executive\nBranch decides, for humanitarian or other reasons, to refrain from seeking a noncitizen’s\nremoval and to authorize his or her continued presence in the United States.  See Reno v.\nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 484 (1999).  On June 15, 2012, the\nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) announced DACA, a deferred action program for\nyoung immigrants who came to the United States as children and are present in the United States\nwithout formal immigration status, in a memorandum issued by Secretary Janet Napolitano (“the\nNapolitano Memo”).  See Declaration of Dae Keun Kwon, Dkt. # 16-4 (“Kwon Decl.”), ¶ 10, Ex.\n9 (“Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United\nStates as Children”) at 2 (“Napolitano Memo”).  Although DHS announced on September 5,\n2017 that it was “winding down” the DACA program, officials confirmed that the same program\nrules would continue to apply until its end.  Cert. Mot. 5:17–20.\nUnder DACA, young immigrants who entered the United States as children and meet\nspecified educational and residency requirements, and who pass extensive criminal background\nchecks, are eligible to receive deferred action.  See Napolitano Memo at 1–2.  A necessary\npredicate for DACA eligibility is that an individual must lack a lawful immigration status.  See\nKwon Decl. ¶ 21, Ex. 20 (“National Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Deferred Action for\nChildhood Arrivals (DACA)”) at 44 (“DACA SOP”).  In addition, DACA recipients cannot have\nbeen convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors. \nSee Napolitano Memo at 1.  Deferred action under DACA is granted to qualifying individuals for\na period of two years, subject to renewal.  See id. at 2–3.\nDHS’s DACA Standard Operating Procedures (“the DACA SOP”) set forth the\nprocedures that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) must follow in both\ngranting and terminating DACA.  See DACA SOP at 16; see also Colotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp.\n3d 1328, 1334 (N.D. Ga. 2017) (“The SOP states that it is applicable to all personnel performing\nadjudicative functions and the procedures to be followed are not discretionary.”).\nB. DACA Revocation\nRon Thomas, an official within USCIS, previously attested that the agency “automatically\nterminates DACA” upon the issuance of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”)1 in immigration court, a\n1 An NTA is issued as a predicate step to commencing removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1229(a) (“In removal proceedings under section 1229a of this title, written notice (in this\nsection referred to as a ‘notice to appear’) shall be given in person to the alien . . .”).  In general,\n“[a]liens may be removed if they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted of\ncertain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law.”  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387,\n396 (2012); see also 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a), 1227(a).\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 2 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 3 of 37   Page ID #:1933\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\npractice that has been in place since 2013.  See Declaration of Ron Thomas, Dkt. # 23-2\n(“Thomas Decl.”), ¶ 4.  He also illustrated the scope of automatic DACA terminations, noting\nthat “a more fulsome review of all automatic terminations of DACA would . . . involve a manual\nreview of hundreds of cases.”  Id. ¶ 5.\nPlaintiffs argue that automatic terminations following the issuance of an NTA are\n“unlawful,” noting two “systemic policies and practices.”  Cert. Mot. 6:4–5.  First, Plaintiffs\ncontend that the “practice of revoking DACA without providing notice, a reasoned explanation,\nan opportunity to be heard prior to revocation, or a process for reinstatement where the\nrevocation is in error” violates the DACA SOP, which “do not allow for termination without\nnotice in the vast majority of cases, including in Plaintiffs’ and the proposed class members.”  Id.\n6:6–14.  Second, Plaintiffs note that the practice of revoking DACA automatically upon the\nissuance of an NTA is fundamentally unsound because all DACA recipients necessarily could be\ncharged with unlawful presence.  See id. 6:15–25.\nC. Plaintiffs’ Histories\ni. Plaintiff José Eduardo Gil Robles\nPlaintiff Gil has lived in the United States since 1998 when, at the age of five, he entered\nthe country without inspection at a border crossing.  See Declaration of José Eduardo Gil\nRobles, Dkt. # 39-4 (“Gil Decl.”), ¶ 1.  He eventually settled in Minnesota and graduated from\nhigh school in the Minneapolis area, and has five younger siblings, all of whom were born in the\nUnited States and are U.S. citizens.  Id. ¶¶ 2–3.  Gil first applied for DACA in 2015; it was\ngranted in August of that year and was valid until August 2017.  Id. ¶¶ 8–9.  In April 2017, he\napplied for DACA renewal, which was approved and valid until August 13, 2019.  Id. ¶ 10. \nUsing the work authorization that accompanies DACA, Gil first worked as a baker and then\nbegan employment with a logistics company.  Id. ¶ 11.  He also obtained a Social Security\nNumber and a driver’s license.

Legal Standard\nA. Motion for Class Certification\n“The class action is an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on\nbehalf of the individual named parties only.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 348\n(2011) (citing Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700–01 (1979)).  “In order to justify a\ndeparture from that rule, a class representative must be part of the class and possess the same\ninterest and suffer the same injury as the class members.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 348–49 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\nIn a motion for class certification, the burden is on the plaintiffs to make a prima facie\nshowing that class certification is appropriate, see In re N. Dist. of Cal. Dalkon Shield IUD Liab.\nLitig., 693 F.2d 847, 854 (9th Cir. 1982), and the Court must conduct a “rigorous analysis” to\ndetermine the merit of plaintiffs’ arguments.  General Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147,\n161 (1982).  Plaintiffs must be prepared to “prove” that there are “in fact” sufficiently numerous\nparties or that common questions exist, and frequently this will require some “overlap with the\nmerits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350 (emphasis in original).  Rule\n23 does not, however, grant the court license to “engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the\ncertification stage.”  Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 465–66\n(2013).  “Merits questions may be considered to the extent—but only to the extent—that they are\nrelevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.” \nId. at 466 (citing Dukes, 564 U.S. at 351 n. 6).  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 governs the maintenance of class actions in federal\ncourt.  Rule 23(a) ensures that the named plaintiffs are “appropriate representatives of the class\nwhose claims they wish to litigate.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349.  Plaintiffs must satisfy all of Rule\n23(a)’s four requirements—numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy—and at least\none of the requirements of Rule 23(b).  See Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970,\n979–80 (9th Cir. 2011).\nB. Motion for Preliminary Injunction\nMot. 3 n. 2.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 7 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 8 of 37   Page ID #:1938\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary and drastic remedy.”  Munaf v. Geren, 553\nU.S. 674, 689 (2008).  A party seeking a preliminary injunction must make a “clear showing” of:\n(1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a likelihood of irreparable injury to the plaintiff if\ninjunctive relief is not granted, (3) a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff, and (4) an\nadvancement of the public interest.  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20, 22\n(2008).\nIII. Discussion\nA. Motion for Class Certification\nPlaintiffs move to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2), which can be maintained if the \nRule 23(a) factors are satisfied and “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\ngrounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding\ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\nAs a threshold matter, in their opposition to class certification, Defendants devote a \nconsiderable amount of ink to describing, among other things, the Immigration and Nationality\nAct (“INA”) and the powers vested to DHS regarding immigration policy; deferred action and\nprosecutorial discretion; and USCIS’s authority to grant DACA and CBP’s and ICE’s abilities to\nissue NTAs.  See Cert. Opp. 7:17–13:7.  Some of this information is useful at the class\ncertification stage; specifically, when it is “relevant to determining whether the Rule 23\nprerequisites for class certification are satisfied.”  Amgen, 568 U.S. at 466.  However, beyond\nthat limited function, these arguments will not be used for the purpose of assessing the merits of\nPlaintiffs’ claims generally, because “[w]hether class members could actually prevail on the\nmerits of their claims is not a proper inquiry in determining” preliminary questions relating to\nclass certification.  Stockwell v. City & Cty. of S.F., 749 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir. 2014)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).6\nThe Court will first consider the Rule 23(a) factors before examining whether Rule \n23(b)(2) is satisfied.\ni. Rule 23(a)\n6 Defendants vigorously contest the Court’s jurisdiction over this action.  See Cert. Opp. 4:8–19;\nPI Opp. 6:6–13:17.  Because the Court concludes that it has jurisdiction, see Part III.B.i.a below,\nit will proceed with consideration of class certification.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 8 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 9 of 37   Page ID #:1939\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nThe Court will analyze each of Rule 23(a)’s four requirements—numerosity,\ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy—in turn.\na. Numerosity\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that “the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  There is no fixed number which satisfies the\nnumerosity requirement; it “requires examination of the specific facts of each case and imposes\nno absolute limitations.”  General Tel. Co. of Nw., Inc. v. Equal Emp’t Opportunity Comm’n,\n446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980).  In general, however, “courts find the numerosity requirement\nsatisfied when a class includes at least 40 members.”  Rannis v. Recchia, 380 F. App’x 646, 651\n(9th Cir. 2010).  When, as here, plaintiffs seek injunctive or declaratory relief, “the numerosity\nrequirement is relaxed and plaintiffs may rely on the reasonable inference arising from plaintiffs’\nother evidence that the number of unknown and future members of [the proposed class] is\nsufficient to make joinder impracticable.”  Sueoka v. United States, 101 F. App’x 649, 653 (9th\nCir. 2004); see also Arnott v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 290 F.R.D. 579, 586 (C.D.\nCal. 2012) (“[W]ith . . . additional future members likely to be added, Plaintiffs have shown\nsufficient numerosity to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1).”).\nHere, “Plaintiffs’ counsel is aware of at least 17 DACA recipients who, in the last ten\nmonths alone, have had their DACA terminated without notice or process, despite remaining\neligible for the program,” and estimates that, given the increased rate of DACA revocations and\nincreased scrutiny on the part of federal immigration authorities, there are likely “at least\ndozens—if not many more—who have already had their DACA terminated.”  Cert. Mot.\n11:25–12:5.  Since filing their motion, Plaintiffs “have learned of five additional individuals who\nhave had their DACA terminated without process despite remaining eligible, bringing the total\nnumber of known affected DACA recipients to 22.”  Cert. Reply 9 n. 8; see also Second\nDeclaration of Katrina L. Eiland, Dkt. # 57-1 (“Second Eiland Decl.”), ¶¶ 3–8.\n1. Identified Class Members\nTo begin, Defendants challenge whether the identified DACA recipients can be properly\nconsidered as members of the proposed class.  See Cert. Opp. 17:20–18:1.  As discussed above,\nDefendants suggest that Plaintiffs Gil and Moreira were charged with felonies and so have been\n“convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense,” which thus puts them outside the definition of\nthe proposed class.  However, the evidence provided by Plaintiffs in the form of arrest records\nand declarations creates at least the plausible suggestion that Defendants are “attempt[ing] to\nrely on improper post hoc rationalizations.”  Cert. Reply 4:25–26.  The same inference applies to\nproposed class members Abonza Lopez and Medina, both of whom, Plaintiffs maintain, have not\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 9 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 10 of 37   Page ID #:1940\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\ncommitted disqualifying criminal offenses and are thus proper class members.  Consequently,\nthe Court cannot assume, as Defendants do, that “at least seven of the 17 individual Plaintiffs . . .\nare not properly considered members of the class Plaintiffs seek to certify.”  Cert. Opp.\n17:20–22.\nDefendants also challenge whether even proposed class members who have not\ncommitted disqualifying offenses can properly be included in the class.  As they explain,\n“Plaintiffs indicate only that they are aware that these individuals lost DACA despite having no\n‘disqualifying criminal convictions,’ which . . . is insufficient to determine whether each\nindividual received process or whether the DACA SOP provides for process prior to termination\nin their cases.”  Id. 18:2–6.  As a result, Defendants claim that “each claim would have to be\nassessed individually.”  Id. 18:7–8.  The Court disagrees.  \nWhether the DACA SOP permit automatic revocation in cases where a DACA recipient\nhas committed no disqualifying offense is essentially a merits question, and not one that ought to\nbe fully resolved at this time.  However, it can nevertheless be considered because numerosity\n“overlap[s] with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350.  \nDefendants assert that the relevant guidelines permit automatic termination of DACA\nwhenever immigration authorities issue an NTA.  See Cert. Opp. 11:19–12:6 (“[P]ursuant to the\nDACA SOP and Appendix I, and in conjunction with the NTA Memo, when USCIS discovers\ncertain conduct that suggests DACA should be terminated, USCIS should refer such conduct to\nICE, who may issue an NTA that automatically terminates DACA, with no additional notice or\nopportunity to respond.”).  The Court, however, has previously rejected this argument, noting\nthat “Defendants point to no provision in the DACA SOPs that permits automatic termination as\na result of an NTA based on unauthorized presence.”  Arreola Order at 11.  Indeed, the Court\ndetermined that “[t]here appears to be only one narrow circumstance in which automatic\ntermination based on an NTA is appropriate—when an NTA is issued after USCIS determines\nthat a disqualifying offense or public safety concern is deemed to be ‘Egregious Public Safety’\n[“EPS”].”  Id. (citing DACA SOP at 137).7  Otherwise, “‘unless there are criminal, national\nsecurity, or public safety concerns,’ the DACA termination guidelines prescribe the issuance of a\nNotice of Intent to Terminate and require that ‘[t]he individual should be allowed 33 days to file\na brief or statement contesting the grounds cited.’”  Arreola Order at 11 (quoting DACA SOP at\n137–38) (alteration in original); see also Gonzalez Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No.\n17cv1840 JM(NLS), 2017 WL 4340385, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2017) (“[E]xcept in EPS\n7 An EPS case is defined by USCIS and ICE as a case “where information indicates [that an]\nalien is under investigation for, has been arrested for (without disposition), or has been convicted\nof” murder, rape, sexual abuse, firearms trafficking, human rights violations, or various other\nserious offenses.  See Kwon Decl. ¶ 22, Ex. 21 at 3–4.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 10 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 11 of 37   Page ID #:1941\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\ncases, the DACA SOP requires notice and an ability to contest the [Notice of Termination]\nbefore DACA status may be terminated.”).  \nSimilarly, Defendants argue that “DACA also terminates automatically if a DACA\nrecipient travels outside the United States . . . without first receiving advance parole” or if “DHS\ndeems a DACA recipient an enforcement priority or when USCIS finds that a person is an EPS\nconcern but ICE declines to issue an NTA.”  Cert. Opp. 15:4–9.  While these assertions are both\ntrue to an extent—the “enforcement priority” exception also requires a “process of referring the\ncase to multiple entities for various determinations prior to termination,” Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d\nat 1342—Defendants do not claim that any of the identified class members either left the country\nimpermissibly or received proper process after being deemed enforcement priorities.\nDefendants do not suggest, and there is no indication in the record, that either the named\nPlaintiffs or any of the proposed class members received an NTA on the basis of an EPS\ndetermination, because they left the country without following the proper procedure, or were\ndeemed an enforcement priority and received the required determination process.  Therefore,\nbecause Plaintiffs did not commit disqualifying criminal offenses, they were entitled to notice\nand an opportunity to respond, and so are properly members of the proposed class. \n2. Potential Class Members\nEven if all 22 of the identified class members are included, however, satisfaction of the \nnumerosity requirement is not a foregone conclusion.  As mentioned, the Ninth Circuit has noted\nthat numerosity is “satisfied when a class includes at least 40 members,” Rannis, 380 F. App’x at\n651, and smaller classes have been deemed insufficient.  See, e.g., Harik v. California Teachers\nAss’n, 326 F.3d 1042, 1051 (9th Cir. 2003) (rejecting classes of seven, nine, and ten members\nbecause “[t]he Supreme Court has held fifteen is too small”); Ikonen v. Hartz Mountain Corp.,\n122 F.R.D. 258, 262 (S.D. Cal. 1988) (“As a general rule, classes of 20 are too small, classes of\n20–40 may or may not be big enough depending on the circumstances of each case, and classes\nof 40 or more are numerous enough.”).  However, in addition to the 22 identified members,\nPlaintiffs have made a compelling case that the number is likely higher, see Cert. Mot.\n11:28–12:5, and “courts have held that [w]here the exact size of the class is unknown but general\nknowledge and common sense indicate that it is large, the numerosity requirement is satisfied.” \nCervantez v. Celestica Corp., 253 F.R.D. 562, 569 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (alteration in original and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\nPlaintiffs also note that their “proposed class also includes individuals who will have \ntheir DACA terminated without notice or process, despite continuing to be eligible, if\nDefendants’ policies and practices are not enjoined.”  Cert. Mot. 12:19–21 (emphasis in\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 11 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 12 of 37   Page ID #:1942\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\noriginal).  Considering that there are hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients across the\ncountry, and the admission that USCIS “automatically terminates DACA” upon the issuance of\nan NTA, Thomas Decl. ¶ 4, the Court agrees that an inference of future class members is\nreasonable.  Moreover, the presence of future class members renders joinder inherently\nimpractical, thus satisfying the numerosity requirement’s fundamental purpose.  See, e.g.,\nSueoka, 101 F. App’x at 653 (“Because plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief, the\nnumerosity requirement is relaxed and plaintiffs may rely on the reasonable inference arising\nfrom plaintiffs’ other evidence that the number of unknown and future members of proposed\n[class] is sufficient to make joinder impracticable.”); Ali v. Ashcroft, 213 F.R.D. 390, 408–09\n(W.D. Wash. 2003) (quoting National Ass’n of Radiation Survivors v. Walters, 111 F.R.D. 595,\n599 (N.D. Cal. 1986)) (“[W]here the class includes unnamed, unknown future members, joinder\nof such unknown individuals is impracticable and the numerosity requirement is therefore met,\nregardless of class size.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Hawker v. Consovoy, 198 F.R.D.\n619, 625 (D.N.J. 2001) (“The joinder of potential future class members who share a common\ncharacteristic, but whose identity cannot be determined yet is considered impracticable.”); Smith\nv. Heckler, 595 F. Supp. 1173, 1186 (E.D. Cal. 1984) (“[S]pecial consideration applies to actions\nseeking declaratory or injunctive relief against conduct that is likely to cause future harm. \nJoinder in the class of persons who may be injured in the future has been held impracticable,\nwithout regard to the number of persons already injured.”).\nCourts within this Circuit have certified classes with a similar number of known class \nmembers, particularly when, as here, the class might also include unknown present and future\nclass members.  See, e.g., Saravia v. Sessions, No. 17-cv-03615-VC, 2017 WL 5569838, at *21\n(N.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017) (certifying nationwide class of unaccompanied minors based on\nevidence of 15 known members and likelihood of future members); Chief Goes Out v. Missoula\nCty., No. CV 12-155-M-DWM, 2013 WL 139938, at *3 (D. Mont. Jan. 10, 2013) (certifying\nclass of 18 members because “small classes may satisfy the numerosity requirement where, as\nhere, the class includes both ascertainable members and a fluid composition of future,\nunidentified members”).  Based on the class members identified by Plaintiffs and the likelihood\nof both unknown and future members, the Court concludes that joinder is impracticable, and so\nthe numerosity requirement is satisfied.\nb. Commonality\nUnder Rule 23(a)(2), Plaintiffs must show that “there are questions of law or fact\ncommon to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  This means that the class members’ claims must\n“depend on a common contention.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350.  “What matters to class certification\n. . . is not the raising of common ‘questions’—even in droves—but rather, the capacity of a\nclass-wide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.” \nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 12 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 13 of 37   Page ID #:1943\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nId.  “[E]ven a single [common] question will do.”  Id. at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThus, Rule 23(a)(2) requires not just a common question, but one that is “capable of classwide\nresolution.”  Alcantar v. Hobart Serv., 800 F.3d 1047, 1052 (9th Cir. 2015).  The Ninth Circuit\nhas held that “in a civil-rights suit, [] commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a\nsystem-wide practice or policy that affects all of the putative class members.”  Armstrong v.\nDavis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001).\nHere, Plaintiffs have identified a number of legal questions common to the proposed\nclass, including whether Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA without notice and an\nopportunity to be heard violates their internal rules and the Administrative Procedure Act\n(“APA”), and whether the practice violates the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution. \nCert. Mot. 14:14–15:4.  These common issues are sufficient to satisfy the requirement’s\npermissive standard.  See Perez-Olano v. Gonzalez, 248 F.R.D. 248, 257 (C.D. Cal. 2008)\n(“Courts have found that a single common issue of law or fact is sufficient to satisfy the\ncommonality requirement.”).  The Court also agrees with Plaintiffs that the class members share\na common core of facts, such as the DACA program’s requirements and procedures.  See Cert.\nMot. 15:11–16.  As for the requirement that class members “have suffered the same injury,”\nDukes, 564 U.S. at 349–50, the narrow tailoring of the class definition—to include only those\nindividuals who lost their DACA without notice and did not commit disqualifying criminal\noffenses—ensures commonality of injury.  Given this commonality, should the Court decide that\nDefendants’ practices violate the APA or due process clause, the requested relief—a nationwide\ninjunction preventing termination of DACA pursuant to those practices—would benefit the\nentire class.  Therefore, the common answers to the legal questions presented would “drive the\nresolution of the litigation.”  Ellis, 657 F.3d at 981 (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350).\nIn opposition, Defendants primarily argue that “[d]etermining whether an individual’s\nDACA terminated because of the issuance of an NTA or because of some other discretionary\ndecision would require precisely the type of individualized analysis the Supreme Court\nrecognized could prevent a finding of commonality.”  Cert. Opp. 20:22–25 (citing Dukes, 564\nU.S. at 350).  This argument, though, is premised on a flawed assumption—specifically, that\nautomatic termination of DACA is acceptable in a variety of circumstances, such that the\nproposed class definition is impermissibly overbroad.  While there are some instances in which\nthe DACA SOP might permit automatic termination of a potential class member’s DACA—for\nexample, if the class member received an EPS designation or traveled abroad without following\nthe proper procedure—the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that such cases likely constitute a “very\nsmall number of individuals.”  Cert. Reply 6 n. 5.  Plaintiffs note that, as a practical matter, most\nindividuals who are deemed EPS would have also been convicted of a disqualifying crime and\nwould therefore be excluded from the class definition; indeed, Defendants have not identified a\nsingle potential class member whose DACA was terminated due to EPS but did not commit a\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 13 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 14 of 37   Page ID #:1944\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\ndisqualifying criminal offense.  See id. 6:17–22.  Furthermore, even if the proposed class were to\ninclude some members whose DACA were properly terminated, this alone would not defeat\ncertification, because “[w]here the circumstances of each particular class member vary but retain\na common core of factual or legal issues with the rest of the class, commonality exists.”  Evon v.\nLaw Offices of Sidney Mickell, 688 F.3d 1015, 1029 (9th Cir. 2012); see also Walters v. Reno,\n145 F.3d 1032, 1046 (9th Cir. 1998) (“Differences among the class members with respect to the\nmerits of their actual document fraud cases, however, are simply insufficient to defeat the\npropriety of class certification.  What makes the plaintiffs’ claims suitable for a class action is\nthe common allegation that the INS’s procedures provide insufficient notice.”).  The Ninth\nCircuit has noted that “even a well-defined class may inevitably contain some individuals who\nhave suffered no harm as a result of a defendant’s unlawful conduct.”  Torres v. Mercer Canyons\nInc., 835 F.3d 1125, 1136 (9th Cir. 2016); see also id. (distinguishing between “the possibility\nthat an injurious course of conduct may sometimes fail to cause injury to certain class members”\nand “a flaw that may defeat predominance, such as the existence of large numbers of class\nmembers who were never exposed to the challenged conduct to begin with”) (emphasis in\noriginal).8\nThis same analysis applies to DACA recipients who are reclassified as enforcement\npriorities.  According to the DACA SOP, \nIf after consulting with ICE, USCIS determines that exercising prosecutorial\ndiscretion after removal has been deferred under DACA is not consistent with the\nDepartment of Homeland Security’s enforcement priorities, and ICE does not plan\nto issue an NTA, the officer should refer the case to HQSCOPS [Headquarters\nService Center Operations], though [sic] the normal chain of command, to\ndetermine whether or not a NOIT [Notice of Termination] is appropriate.\nDACA SOP at 138.  At that point, DACA may be terminated without additional notice or an\nopportunity to respond, but only if this procedure is followed.  See Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at\n1342; DACA SOP at 138 (titling this section “Enforcement Priority – DACA Not Automatically\nTerminated”) (emphasis added).  Defendants claim that some proposed class members, including\nPlaintiffs Gil and Moreira, had their DACA terminated because they were determined to be\nenforcement priorities.  However, there is no indication that the above procedure was followed\nin their cases, which would mean that the automatic termination of their DACA grants would be\n8 For this reason, the Court declines Plaintiffs’ invitation to “modify the class definition,” Cert.\nReply 6 n. 5, even though it retains this prerogative.  See Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 871 n. 28\n(“Where appropriate, the district court may redefine the class.”).\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 14 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 15 of 37   Page ID #:1945\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nsubject to the same legal questions as other class members.  In addition, even if this procedure\nwere followed in some class members’ cases, that alone would not preclude certification.9\nWhatever factual dissimilarities that may exist among the proposed class members do not\nprevent class certification; as Plaintiffs note, their claims “challenge Defendants’ common\ntermination policies and practices as categorically violating the APA and the Due Process\nClause—not the agency’s ultimate exercise of discretion with respect to each recipient.”  Cert.\nMot. 16:15–19.  Because these issues create common legal questions amenable to common\nanswers, Rule 23(a)’s commonality requirement is satisfied.\nc. Typicality\nRule 23(a)(3) requires that the named Plaintiffs’ claims be typical of the claims of the\nclass.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  “Under the rule’s permissive standards, representative\nclaims are ‘typical’ if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; they\nneed not be substantially identical.”  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir.\n1998).  The danger that this requirement is meant to guard against is that “absent class members\nwill suffer if their representative is preoccupied with [claims or defenses] unique to it.”  Ellis,\n657 F.3d at 984.  To meet the typicality requirement, Plaintiffs must therefore establish that\nother class members have the same or similar injury as them; that the action is based on conduct\nthat is not unique to them as the named Plaintiffs; and that other class members have been\ninjured by the same course of conduct.  See id.\nThe Court agrees that Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed class. \nEach Plaintiff, like each member of the proposed class, had valid DACA and work authorization\nthat USCIS terminated without notice or an opportunity to be heard, and now claims that this\npractice violates the APA and the due process clause.  See Cert. Mot. 17:11–16.  Plaintiffs’\nclaims are thus reasonably co-extensive with the other class members’.\nDefendants’ challenge to the typicality requirement, by their admission, “essentially\nmirrors its argument that Plaintiffs failed to meet their commonality requirement.”  Cert. Opp.\n22 n. 9.  This is not surprising, since “[t]he commonality and typicality requirements of Rule\n9 Defendants also suggest another commonality obstacle: that “[o]ther putative class members\nmay be in removal proceedings as a result of termination of their DACA by NTA issuance, and\nsome may even have an administratively filed order of removal or have already been removed.” \nCert. Opp. 21:17–20.  However, an individual who is in removal proceedings is still eligible for\nDACA, see Napolitano Memo at 3, and so may challenge the legality of future revocation.  As\nfor those who have already been removed, Plaintiffs note that “individuals who obtain a lawful\nimmigration status or are deported have no need for DACA.”  Cert Reply 8 n. 7.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 15 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 16 of 37   Page ID #:1946\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

Even if the named Plaintiffs’ individual cases contain some factual variations, that\ndoes not change the fact that all are challenging the legality of Defendants’ DACA revocation\npractices under the APA and due process clause.  See Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1124\n(9th Cir. 2010) (“The particular characteristics of the Petitioner or any individual detainee will\nnot impact the resolution of this general statutory question and, therefore, cannot render\nPetitioner’s claim atypical”); Ali, 213 F.R.D. at 409 (citing Harris v. Palm Springs Alpine\nEstates, Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 914 (9th Cir. 1964)) (“[T]ypicality is not defeated if there are legal\nquestions common to all class members.”).  As discussed above, Defendants’ contention that\nPlaintiffs Gil and Moreira were eligible for automatic revocation because of their enforcement\npriority findings is inconsistent with the DACA SOP, which specifically indicates that DACA is\nnot automatically terminated in those situations.  See DACA SOP at 138.  If their DACA grants\nwere terminated without following the proper procedure, or if the enforcement priority finding\nwas a post hoc rationalization, then their challenges under the APA and due process clause\nwould be “reasonably coextensive” with the other class members’; again, “they need not be\nsubstantially identical.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.\nBecause Plaintiffs’ claims raise the same legal issues as the proposed class members’, and\nbecause minor factual variations need not prevent certification, the Court concludes that the\ntypicality requirement is satisfied.\nd. Adequacy\nRule 23(a)(4) requires Plaintiffs to show that “the representative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Representation is\nadequate when the class representatives do not have any conflicts of interest with other class\nmembers, and the Court is confident that the representative plaintiffs will prosecute the action\n“vigorously on behalf of the class.”  Evon, 688 F.3d at 1031.  A district court should evaluate\nwhether the class representatives have a sufficient stake in the outcome of the litigation, and\nwhether the class representatives have interests antagonistic to the unnamed class members.  See\nBrown v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 982 F.2d 386, 390 (9th Cir. 1992).  In addition, the district court\nshould inquire into the zeal and competence of class representatives’ counsel.  See id.\nTo begin, neither Defendants nor the Court questions the competence of Plaintiffs’\ncounsel, who have acquitted themselves well during this litigation and have demonstrated the\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 16 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 17 of 37   Page ID #:1947\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

Plaintiffs further note that\n“[a]ttorneys from the ACLU Immigrations’ Rights Project and ACLU of Southern California\nhave been appointed class counsel and successfully litigated similar class action lawsuits in this\ndistrict and in courts across the country.”  Cert. Mot. 18:11–19; see also Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at\n1111; Garcia v. Johnson, No. 14-cv-01775-YGR, 2014 WL 6657591, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 21,\n2014) (finding Plaintiffs’ counsel “experienced in protecting the interests of noncitizens and\nhandling complex and class action litigation, including litigation on behalf of immigration\ndetainees”).\nInstead, Defendants challenge the adequacy of the named Plaintiffs.  They suggest that\n“the three named Plaintiffs are not properly part of the class that Plaintiffs seek[] to certify,”\nCert. Opp. 24:15–16, and although it is true that this Court issued a preliminary injunction\nrestoring Arreola’s DACA, see Arreola Order at 15–16, as discussed above, the fact that Gil and\nMoreira were purportedly designated as enforcement priorities does not alter their challenges to\nDefendants’ practices under the APA and due process clause.  Defendants also argue that class\ncertification is inappropriate because “the claims of each of the named Plaintiffs is subject to\ndismissal,” Cert. Opp. 24:10–25, and cite to Lierboe v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance\nCo., 350 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2003), in which the Ninth Circuit determined that a class could not\nbe certified when the class representative did not have standing.  Id. at 1022–23.  However, as\ndiscussed in Part III.B.i.a below, the Court concludes that it has jurisdiction to hear this case, and\nit has not ruled to dismiss any of the named Plaintiffs from this action.  Accordingly, Lierboe\ndoes not present the Court with a compelling reason to deny certification.\nFinally, Defendants suggest that proposed class members might have “divergent\ninterests,” noting that at least two of the identified class members have already initiated\nproceedings on their own behalves, and that “many other putative class members, even with\nongoing removal proceedings, may be able to reapply for DACA and could receive additional\nprocess.”  Cert. Opp. 24:26–25:14.  As to the first point, the Court does not see how other suits\nundertaken by potential class members create divergent interests here, and Defendants do not\nidentify any specific conflict.  As for the possibility that class members might reapply for DACA\nand receive additional process in the future, “this circuit does not favor denial of class\ncertification on the basis of speculative conflicts.”  Cummings v. Connell, 316 F.3d 886, 896 (9th\nCir. 2003).  Moreover, even if some class members receive relief in the future, certification\nunder Rule 23(b)(2) is “appropriate for cases where plaintiffs bring a class action on behalf of a\nshifting population.”  Perez-Olano, 248 F.R.D. at 259 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn short, because the Court concludes that the named Plaintiffs and their counsel will\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 17 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 18 of 37   Page ID #:1948\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

Rule 23(b)(2)\nBecause the four requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, the Court will now consider\nwhether certification is appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2).\nCertification of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) requires that “the party opposing the class has\nacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief\nor corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 23(b)(2).  The Ninth Circuit has held that “‘it is sufficient’ to meet the requirements of Rule\n23(b)(2) [when] ‘class members complain of a pattern or practice that is generally applicable to\nthe class as a whole.’”  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1125 (quoting Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047).  Rule\n23(b)(2) “was adopted in order to permit the prosecution of civil rights actions.”  Walters, 145\nF.3d at 1047; see also Lyon v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 308 F.R.D. 203, 213 (N.D.\nCal. 2015).  “The rule does not require [the Court] to examine the viability or bases of class\nmembers’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, but only to look at whether class members\nseek uniform relief from a practice applicable to all of them.”  Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1125; see\nalso Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (“The key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the\ninjunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be\nenjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.”)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\na. Proposed Class\nThe Court agrees that “Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirements are plainly met” here.  Cert. Mot.\n21:23.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to declare that Defendants’ termination policies and practices,\nwhich have impacted the proposed class, are unlawful, and to enjoin USCIS from enforcing\nunlawful DACA terminations and unlawfully terminating DACA in the future.  See generally PI\nMot.  Plaintiffs contend that\n[t]his relief would benefit Plaintiffs as well as all members of the proposed classes\nin the same fashion.  No individual class member would be entitled to a different\ninjunction or declaratory judgment.  The requested relief would address these\npolicies or practices in a single stroke, and thus the proposed class plainly warrants\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2).\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 18 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 19 of 37   Page ID #:1949\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 689 (9th Cir. 2014)\n(“[E]very [member] in the proposed class is allegedly suffering the same (or at least a similar)\ninjury and that injury can be alleviated for every class member by uniform changes in . . . policy\nand practice.”); Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1126 (certifying class of immigrant detainees under Rule\n23(b)(2) where “relief from a single practice is requested by all class members”).\nThe Court also agrees that nationwide certification is appropriate, given the centralized\nnature and scope of Defendants’ practices.  The potential class members identified by Plaintiffs\ncome from various states, including Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, Minnesota, South Dakota, North\nCarolina, New Jersey, and California.  See Cert. Mot. 22:17–20; Eiland Decl. ¶¶ 2–14; Second\nEiland Decl. ¶¶ 3–8.  Furthermore, there are currently nearly 700,000 DACA recipients in all 50\nstates, see Eiland Decl. ¶ 48, Ex. 33, and Defendants have indicated that USCIS has a practice of\nautomatically terminating individual DACA grants upon the issuance of an NTA.  See Thomas\nDecl. ¶ 4.  Accordingly, to certify a class that is not nationwide in scope might result in the\napplication of unlawful practices based solely on geographic location, a piecemeal situation that\nwould lead to arbitrary results.  See Arnott, 290 F.R.D. at 589 (quoting Califano, 442 U.S. at\n702) (certifying nationwide class after noting that “the interests of judicial efficiency, economy,\nand equity weigh in favor of class certifications that offer relief ‘dictated by the extent of the\nviolation established, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff class’”); Gorbach v. Reno,\n181 F.R.D. 642, 644 (W.D. Wash. 1998) (“[A]nything less [than] a nationwide class would\nresult in an anomalous situation allowing the INS to pursue denaturalization proceedings against\nsome citizens, but not others, depending on which district they reside in.”).\nb. Ascertainability\nDefendants challenge certification under Rule 23(b)(2) on ascertainability grounds,\narguing that “[n]ot only must the challenged practice apply to all class members, but it must be\nreadily ascertainable that the practice has injured every member.”  Cert. Opp. 13:16–17.  To\nbegin, the cases cited by Defendants for this proposition are inapposite, because each concerned,\nin whole or at least in part, class certification under Rule 23(b)(3), not 23(b)(2).

Powers, 454 F.2d 1362, 1366 (1st Cir. 1972) (determining that\nascertainability is a requirement under Rule 23(b)(3) but not Rule 23(b)(2)).\nHowever, even if the ascertainability requirement were to apply to this proposed class, the\nCourt concludes that it would be satisfied because it is “administratively feasible” to ascertain\nwhether an individual is a member.  Greater L.A. Agency on Deafness, Inc. v. Reel Servs. Mgmt.\nLLC, No. CV 13-7172 PSG (ASx), 2014 WL 12561074, at *5 (C.D. Cal. May 6, 2014).  As\ndiscussed above, this is not a case where rigorous, individualized inquiries are necessary. \nMembership in the class is defined by (1) the nature of an individual’s DACA revocation, and\n(2) whether that individual has been convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense.  Accordingly,\nthe definition is “precise, objective, and presently ascertainable.”  O’Connor v. Boeing N. Am.,\nInc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D. Cal. 1998).  That some administrative effort is required does not\npreclude certification.  See, e.g., Moreno v. Napolitano, No. 11 C 5452, 2014 WL 4911938, at\n*6–7 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 2014) (quoting Young v.

These arguments, as discussed earlier in this order, are\nbased on the flawed premise that automatic DACA termination is a common and permissible\nfeature of the program.  However, as the Court has concluded both here and in its prior order,\nsee generally Arreola Order, automatic termination is only permissible in what appears to be a\nrelatively small subset of cases.  Therefore, the Court is not concerned with overbreadth.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 20 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 21 of 37   Page ID #:1951\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nIn summation, because the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs and\nproposed class members would remedy their injuries as a whole, the Court concludes that\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate.11\niii. Rule 23(g)\nPlaintiffs’ counsel seek to be appointed as Class Counsel.  See Cert. Mot. 23:12–13.  \nUnder Rule 23(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a district court must appoint\nclass counsel at the time the class is certified, unless otherwise provided by statute.  See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(g).  The class counsel must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class,\nand the court must review the counsel’s work in investigating claims, experience in handling\nclass action litigation, and the resources counsel will commit to representing the class.  See Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23(g)(1). \nAs discussed in Part III.A.i.d above, Plaintiffs’ counsel have previously litigated a\nnumber of similar class actions, including cases involving immigration law.  See Garcia, 2014\nWL 6657591, at *15.  They have also demonstrated that they possess the experience and\nresources needed to pursue this matter to completion, see Newell Decl. ¶¶ 2–27, and have thus\nfar served Plaintiffs well during the course of this litigation.  Defendants have provided no\nchallenges to their qualifications, and the Court sees no reason not to appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel\nas Class Counsel.\niv. Summation\nBecause the Court concludes that the proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule\n23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2), it GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  \n11 The Court’s conclusion here is consistent with the decisions of a number of courts that have\ncertified nationwide classes under Rule 23(b)(2) in similar actions challenging the federal\ngovernment’s administration of immigration programs.  See, e.g., Walters, 145 F.3d at 1053\n(affirming certification of nationwide class of individuals challenging adequacy of notice in\ndocument fraud cases); Wagafe v.

Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nB. Motion for Preliminary Injunction\nMuch of the discussion that follows mirrors the arguments and analyses presented in the\nCourt’s previous order granting Plaintiff Arreola’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  See\ngenerally Arreola Order.  Defendants repeat many of the same contentions that the Court\npreviously rejected, and give few reasons why it should revise the conclusions it reached at that\ntime.  The Court will nevertheless address the arguments for and against the issuance of a\npreliminary injunction.\ni. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\na. Jurisdiction\nAs a threshold matter, Defendants challenge this Court’s ability to review the revocation\nof class members’ DACA, based on the APA and other statutes.\n1. APA\nAlthough the APA permits judicial review of agency actions where “there is no other\nadequate remedy in a court,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, Defendants note that the APA precludes review of\nagency decisions that are “committed to agency discretion by law,” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2), and\nthat the Supreme Court has held that “an agency’s decision not to take enforcement action\nshould be presumed immune from judicial review under § 701(a)(2).”  Heckler v. Chaney, 470\nU.S. 821, 832 (1985).  Defendants therefore conclude that “individual DACA terminations,\nespecially where based on issuance of NTAs, fall squarely within that category of agency\ndiscretion for which judicial review is improper.”  PI Opp. 12:18–20.\nThe Court disagrees.  The jurisdictional bar cited by Defendants applies only where there\nis “no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Mendez-\nGutierrez v. Ashcroft, 340 F.3d 865, 868 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830).  By\ncontrast, a court can review an agency decision when, like here, there are “statutes, regulations,\nestablished agency policies, or judicial decisions that provide a meaningful standard against\nwhich to assess” an agency’s action.  Mendez-Gutierrez, 340 F.3d at 868; see also ASSE Int’l,\nInc. v. Kerry, 803 F.3d 1059, 1069 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Spencer Enters., Inc. v. United\nStates, 345 F.3d 683, 688 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. Immigration & Naturalization\nServ., 208 F.3d 838, 844 (9th Cir. 2000)) (“Even where statutory language grants an agency\n‘unfettered discretion,’ its decision may nonetheless be reviewed if regulations or agency\npractice provide a ‘meaningful standard by which this court may review its exercise of\ndiscretion.’”).\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 22 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 23 of 37   Page ID #:1953\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nHere, the decision to revoke DACA is governed by both the Napolitano Memo and the\nDACA SOP, and the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly found that APA jurisdiction exists where\n“discretion has been legally circumscribed by various memoranda.”  Alcaraz v. Immigration &\nNaturalization Serv., 384 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 648 F.3d 708, 719 (9th Cir. 2011) (looking to an agency’s interim certification\nstandards to “supply the standard against which we can judge the agency’s decision-making”);\nMendez-Gutierrez, 340 F.3d at 868 (noting that the absence of a specific statute or regulation\n“does not . . . mean that there are no meaningful standards against which to evaluate” an\nagency’s decision where other rules and regulations apply).  Other courts that have similarly\nexamined the Napolitano Memo and DACA SOP have also concluded that they contain the sort\nof detailed policy directives that provide courts with the standards needed to review DACA\nrevocation.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5 (citing United States ex rel. Accardi\nv. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1162) (“Defendants’ failure to\nfollow the termination procedures set forth in the DACA SOP is arbitrary, capricious, and an\nabuse of discretion.”); Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1340 (“Defendants’ argument that § 701(a) of\nthe APA bars this Court from reviewing an agency’s non-discretionary review process fails.”);\nsee also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 170 (5th Cir. 2015) (determining that the “grant of\nlawful presence and accompanying eligibility for benefits is a substantive rule”).\nIn its prior order, the Court noted that Plaintiffs “challenge[] USCIS’ determination that []\nDACA should be automatically terminated based on CBP’s issuance of an NTA, not any\neventual enforcement decision in removal proceedings.”  Arreola Order at 5.  Because DACA\neligibility and revocation are governed by the aforementioned regulations, the Court has a\nmeaningful standard with which to scrutinize the agency’s decision, and so judicial review is not\nbarred by the APA.  See Ramirez Medina v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. C17-0218RSM,\n2017 WL 5176720, at *8 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 8, 2017) (“Defendants’ alleged failure to follow the\nprocedures detailed in the DACA SOP does not implicate agency discretion.  Therefore, the\njurisdiction-stripping provisions of . . . § 701(a) are not applicable to prevent this Court from\ndetermining whether Defendants complied with their non-discretionary procedures.”).\n2. Section 1252(g)\nDefendants also point to § 1252(g) for their jurisdictional claim, which mandates that “no\ncourt shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from\nthe decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or\nexecute removal orders against any alien.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  The Supreme Court has\nexplained that § 1252(g) is “directed against a particular evil: attempts to impose judicial\nconstraints upon prosecutorial discretion.”  Reno, 525 U.S. at 944 n. 9.  Accordingly, Defendants\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 23 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 24 of 37   Page ID #:1954\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nassert that “because issuance of an NTA and termination of DACA are steps ‘leading up to’ a\nfinal order of removal, they are squarely within the scope of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).”  PI Opp.\n8:3–4.\nDefendants interpret § 1252(g) too broadly, as evidenced by the Supreme Court’s Reno\ndecision.  There, in response to the “unexamined assumption that § 1252(g) covers the universe\nof deportation claims—that it is a ‘zipper’ clause that says ‘no judicial review in deportation\ncases unless this section provides judicial review,’” the Supreme Court opined that “what\n§ 1252(g) says is much narrower.”  Reno, 525 U.S. at 482.  It concluded that “[t]he provision\napplies only to three discrete actions that the Attorney General may take: her ‘decision or action’\nto ‘commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’”  Id. (emphasis in\noriginal).  Section 1252(g) does not preclude review of “many other decisions or actions that\nmay be part of the deportation process.”  Id.  Consistent with this guidance, the Ninth Circuit has\nnarrowly construed § 1252(g), distinguishing between the narrow category of actions that courts\ncannot review and those adjacent actions that are within their jurisdiction.  In Alcaraz, for\nexample, the Ninth Circuit held that even a claim closely related to the initiation of removal\nproceedings is not barred by § 1252(g), so long as it does not challenge the decision to\ncommence proceedings itself.  Alcaraz, 384 F.3d at 1160–61; see also Catholic Soc. Servs. v.\nImmigration & Naturalization Serv., 232 F.3d 1139, 1150 (9th Cir. 2000) (“[Section 1252(g)]\napplies only to the three specific discretionary actions mentioned in its text, not to all claims\nrelating in any way to deportation proceedings.”).\nHere, Plaintiffs challenge neither the issuance of NTAs nor the CBP’s decisions to\ncommence removal proceedings.  Instead, they challenge the USCIS’s separate and independent\ndecision to revoke DACA on the basis of an NTA, which is independent of the limited category\nof decisions covered by § 1252(g).  See Ramirez Medina, 2017 WL 5176720, at *6 (“[T]he\nCourt ultimately finds that none of the statutes relied upon by Defendants applies to the narrower\nissues presented in this case; specifically, whether Defendants complied with their own non-\ndiscretionary procedures.”); Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *4–5.  \nFurthermore, the Ninth Circuit has held that while § 1252(g) precludes review of the three\nspecified discretionary decisions, it does not bar review of legal questions relating to those\ndiscretionary decisions.  See United States v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(en banc) (“The district court may consider a purely legal question that does not challenge the\nAttorney General’s discretionary authority, even if the answer to that legal question—a\ndescription of the relevant law—forms the backdrop against which the Attorney General later\nwill exercise discretionary authority.”); see also Madu v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 470 F.3d 1362,\n1368 (11th Cir. 2006) (“While this provision bars courts from reviewing certain exercises of\ndiscretion by the attorney general, it does not proscribe substantive review of the underlying\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 24 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 25 of 37   Page ID #:1955\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nlegal bases for those discretionary decisions and actions.”).  Here, Plaintiffs bring their legal\nchallenges under the APA and the due process clause.  These are the sorts of purely legal\nquestions that, although related to a discretionary decision, are nevertheless permitted by the\nNinth Circuit.\nBecause Plaintiffs mount legal challenges to decisions that are not within the limited\ncategory of discretionary actions enumerated by the statute, the Court concludes that § 1252(g)\ndoes not deprive it of jurisdiction over their claims.\n3. Sections 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9)\nLastly, Defendants contend that “[t]o the extent that Plaintiffs have any viable claims, the\nREAL ID Act, codified at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9), bars them from raising those\nclaims in district court, even before a final order of removal issues.”  PI Opp. 9:1–3.  Section\n1252(a)(5) requires that “a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in\naccordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order\nof removal entered or issued under any provision of this chapter.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5). \nSection 1252(b)(9) further provides that “[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact,\nincluding interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from\nany action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this\nsubchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.”  8\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  As one court characterized this statutory scheme, it was designed to “put\nan end to the scattershot and piecemeal nature of the review process that previously had held\nsway in regard to removal proceedings.”  Aguilar v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 510\nF.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2007).\nHowever, although the Supreme Court has explained that the purpose of § 1252(b)(9) is\n“to consolidate ‘judicial review’ of immigration proceedings into one action in the court of\nappeals,” it “applies only ‘[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection\n(a)(1).’”  Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 313 (2001).  Section\n1252(a)(1), like § 1252(a)(5), refers to “[j]udicial review of a final removal” order.  8 U.S.C.\n§ 1252(a)(1); see also Singh v. Gonzalez, 499 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir. 2007) (“By virtue of their\nexplicit language, both §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) apply only to those claims seeking judicial\nreview of orders of removal.”).\nPlaintiffs do not seek judicial review of orders of removal; indeed, their challenges are\nindependent of any removal proceedings.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *5\n(“Plaintiff brings a procedural challenge to termination of his DACA status, an issue\nindependent from any removal proceedings.”).  Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit has held that\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 25 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 26 of 37   Page ID #:1956\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\n§ 1252(b)(9) does not deprive district courts of jurisdiction where a claim could not have been\nlitigated in removal proceedings and the noncitizen would otherwise “have had no legal avenue\nto obtain judicial review of this claim.”  J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1032 (9th Cir. 2016);\nsee also Mamigonian v. Biggs, 710 F.3d 936, 945 (9th Cir. 2013) (permitting an APA action\nwhere the immigration judge “would be without jurisdiction” to adjudicate the claim and so\n“review would be unavailable” to plaintiff).  An immigration judge in a removal proceeding does\nnot have the power to grant or deny deferred action, or to review or reverse an agency’s decision\nto revoke it.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL 4340385, at *6 (“[A]n immigration judge has no\njurisdiction to reinstate DACA status.”); see also Napolitano Memo at 2–3 (conveying power to\ngrant DACA to agencies); Matter of Quintero, 18 I. & N. Dec. 348, 350 (B.I.A. 1982)\n(“[N]either the immigration judge nor the Board may grant [deferred action] status or review a\ndecision of the District Director to deny it.”).  Therefore, Plaintiffs could not have challenged the\nrevocation of their DACA statuses at a removal proceeding, and so under Ninth Circuit\nprecedent, jurisdiction is not barred.\nPlaintiffs here are not challenging a final removal order, and the action they bring is\npremised on claims that could not have been brought in removal proceedings.  Therefore,\n§§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) do not apply and do not deprive this Court of jurisdiction.\nb. Merits of Plaintiffs’ Claims\nBecause the Court again concludes that it has jurisdiction over this action, it will now\nconsider the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims.\n1. APA Claim\nPlaintiffs argue that “Defendants’ practice of terminating DACA based solely on the\nissuance of an NTA charging the DACA recipient with presence without admission or\noverstaying a visa is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA.”  PI\nMot. 9:9–12.  The Court agrees.\nUnder the APA, “agency action must be based on non-arbitrary, ‘relevant factors.’” \nJudulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 55 (2011) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v.\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983)).  The “courts retain a role, and an\nimportant one, in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.”  Judulang,\n565 U.S. at 53.  “When reviewing an agency action, [the Court] must assess, among other\nmatters, ‘whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether\nthere has been a clear error of judgment.’”  Id. (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 26 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 27 of 37   Page ID #:1957\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that this case is analogous to that which the Supreme\nCourt considered in Judulang.  See PI Mot. 9:20–10:3.  There, the Supreme Court considered a\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) rule governing eligibility for a form of\nrelief—suspension of deportation—which, like DACA, was not provided for in the INA and was\ntherefore discretionary.  See Judulang, 565 U.S. at 46–47.  Despite this discretionary quality, the\nSupreme Court nonetheless determined that the rules applied by the agency must reflect\nreasoned decisionmaking, admonishing that “[a] method for disfavoring deportable aliens that\nbears no relation to these matters—that neither focuses on nor relates to an alien’s fitness to\nremain in the country—is arbitrary and capricious.”  Id. at 55.  The BIA’s rule was invalidated\nbecause it was based on “a matter irrelevant to the alien’s fitness to reside in this country,”\nwhich indicated that “the BIA ha[d] failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.”  Id. at\n53.\nPlaintiffs make a compelling argument that, like the BIA’s invalidated rule in Judulang,\nthe decision to automatically terminate their DACA and its accompanying employment\nauthorization based on the issuance of an NTA fails the requirements of the APA.  First, based\non the Napolitano Memo and the DACA SOP, a noncitizen’s deportability due to unauthorized\npresence in the United States—the basis for NTAs—provides no relevant basis for terminating\nDACA.  These guidelines enumerate the relevant considerations for a DACA grant, and not only\nis unauthorized presence an unmentioned factor, but the program was specifically designed for\npersons without lawful immigration status.  See, e.g., DACA SOC at 44 (indicating that an\nindividual “may be favorably considered for DACA if” he/she “[e]ntered without inspection” or\nhis/her “lawful immigration status expired”).  The program’s rules also make clear that even\nnoncitizens who are, have been, or will be placed in removal proceedings are nonetheless\neligible for DACA.  See Napolitano Memo at 2; DACA SOP at 71 (“Individuals in removal\nproceedings may file a DACA request.”); Kwon Decl. ¶ 17, Ex. 16 (Statement of Assistant\nSecretary Michael Dougherty and Acting Director James McCament) at 2 (“The 2012\nmemorandum also made clear that individuals could be considered for DACA even if they were\nalready in removal proceedings or were subject to a final removal order.”).  The same is true for\nindividuals with final removal orders, and even individuals who have “reenter[ed] the United\nStates illegally after having been removed or after leaving voluntarily under an order of\nremoval.”  See DACA SOP at 74–75.  \nFurthermore, if an NTA is issued against an applicant while her application is pending\nwith USCIS—even if the NTA is based on a public safety concern—DACA can still be\nconferred on the applicant.  See Kwon Decl. ¶ 22, Ex. 21 (November 7, 2011 Policy\nMemorandum titled “Revised Guidance for the Referral of Cases and Issuance of Notices to\nAppear (NTAs) in Cases Involving Inadmissible and Removable Aliens”) at 4 (“ICE’s issuance\nof an NTA allows USCIS to proceed with adjudication . . . taking into account the basis for the\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 27 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 28 of 37   Page ID #:1958\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

In such cases, USCIS is required to\nreview all relevant circumstances, and may still grant a DACA request despite an NTA “[i]f a\nDACA requestor has been placed in proceedings on a ground that does not adversely impact the\nexercise of prosecutorial discretion.”  DACA SOP at 75; see also id. at 74 (“Final removal orders\n. . . should be reviewed carefully to examine the underlying grounds for removal.”).\nAccordingly, the Court agrees that “given that the filing of an NTA against a DACA\napplicant, or even the issuance of a final order of removal against a DACA applicant, does not\nrender the individual ineligible for the program, DHS’ practice of automatically terminating\nDACA on this basis is arbitrary and irrational.”  PI Mot. 12:1–4.\nFinally, there is the issue of departure.  Agencies are free to change course and depart\nfrom a prior decision, but they are also “obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change.” \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 42; see also Federal Commc’ns Comm’n v. Fox Television Stations,\nInc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (“[T]he agency must show that there are good reasons for the new\npolicy.”).  Here, in the case of each class member, DHS made a determination (and, in cases like\nthe named Plaintiffs’ where renewal was granted, multiple determinations) that the individual\nwas eligible for and warranted a DACA grant.  These decisions, pursuant to the relevant\nguidelines, were based on background checks and a review of the applicant’s documentation. \nHowever, in each case, although the class member had not been charged with or convicted of a\ndisqualifying criminal act, DHS’s decisions were reversed and DACA was revoked—in\nPlaintiffs’ words, “the agency [] abruptly chang[ed] course” even though “each [] class member\ncontinue[d] to be eligible for DACA.”  PI Mot. 13:22–24.  The only explanation for this reversal\nprovided to Plaintiffs was that their DACA was “terminated automatically” due to the NTA. \nKwon Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 8; Moreira Decl. ¶ 26, Ex. B; Gil Decl. ¶ 30, Ex. B.  The Court maintains\nthat “USCIS’s one-sentence explanation fails to provide good reasons for the agency’s change in\nposition, as required by the APA.”  Arreola Order at 10; see also Organized Vill. of Kake v.

Ct. 1199, 1209 (2015)) (explaining that an agency\nis “required to provide a ‘reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding’ the ‘facts and\ncircumstances’ that underlay its previous decision”).  In its prior order, the Court continued: \n[G]iven that all DACA recipients are necessarily removable due to their\nunauthorized presence, [t]he agency’s reliance on an NTA citing [class members’]\npresence without admission simply fails to explain, much less justify, the\nagency’s decision to reverse course and terminate [their] DACA.

Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\narbitrary and unexplained decision fails to address [class members’] substantial\nreliance interests, which also runs counter to the Supreme Court’s mandate.  \nArreola Order at 10–11 (emphasis in original and internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nFox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 515 (holding that an agency must “provide a more detailed\njustification” when “its prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken\ninto account”).\nIn opposition, Defendants contest the conclusions the Court reached when it issued\nPlaintiff Arreola’s preliminary injunction and maintain that DHS did not violate its internal\nguidelines, asserting that “[w]hen a case is referred by USCIS, ICE may issue an NTA that\nautomatically terminates DACA, with no additional notice or opportunity to respond.”  PI Opp.\n19:6–8.  Despite Defendants’ disagreement, the Court repeats what it stated previously: the\nDACA SOP do not support this assertion.  There are, as discussed throughout Part III.A above,\nonly a few, narrow circumstances in which DACA can be terminated automatically, without\nnotice and an opportunity to be heard.  Defendants point to no provision in the DACA SOP that\npermits automatic termination as a result of an NTA based on unauthorized presence.  They\ndiscuss ICE’s and CBP’s authority to issue NTAs, see PI Opp. at 18:25–19:8, and note that\n“there is no provision permitting USCIS to reverse ICE’s decision,” id. 19:14–15, but such\nassertions are not relevant—the issue is not whether DHS or its component agencies can issue\nNTAs, but instead whether USCIS can terminate DACA automatically solely on that basis.12 \nThe Court maintains that it cannot.  Although an NTA filed on the basis of an EPS designation\ncan result in automatic DACA termination, see DACA SOP at 137, “if the disqualifying criminal\noffense is non-EPS” then “[t]he individual should be allowed 33 days to file a brief or statement\ncontesting the grounds cited in the Notice of Intent to Terminate.”  Id.; see also Gonzalez Torres,\n2017 WL 4340385, at *6 (noting that NTAs based on an EPS designation and NTAs based on\nunauthorized presence “are not fungible, or ‘flip sides of the same coin’”).  Defendants contend\nthat “it takes a particularly strained reading of the Napolitano Memo and DACA SOP to find that\nICE and CBP cannot issue NTAs that have the effect of terminating DACA.”  PI Opp. 20:1–3. \nFor the reasons discussed throughout this order, the Court disagrees.\nDefendants also suggest that they have not reversed policy by automatically terminating\nDACA upon the issuance of an NTA, and hence that Fox Television Stations is inapposite.  See\n12 Defendants argue that the Court’s prior conclusion “relies on a starkly oversimplified\nconsideration of the NTA decision process,” and provide additional information as to how NTAs\nare issued.  PI Opp. 20:16–22:19.  Again, neither Plaintiffs nor the Court suggest that the NTA\nprocess itself is arbitrary or capricious, but instead that the decision to automatically terminate\nDACA solely on the basis of an NTA is inconsistent with the applicable guidelines and\nregulations.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 29 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 30 of 37   Page ID #:1960\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nPI Opp. 22:21–24:6.  They note that “[t]he initial grant of DACA is heavily qualified with\nwarnings that it is not protection from removal or a change in legal status, and that it may be\nterminated at any time, specifically for subsequent criminal activity.”  Id. 22:26–23:1. \nAccordingly, “[t]he automatic termination of Plaintiffs’ DACA . . . is well within DACA SOP\npolicy and practice, and demonstrates that there is no change in policy or practice as it applies to\nthe putative class or individuals,” id. 23:4–8, and therefore any variations merely constitute an\n“evolving analysis” that the Ninth Circuit has excluded from Fox Television Stations analysis. \nSierra Club v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 786 F.3d 1219, 1226 (9th Cir. 2015).\nTo begin, the Court disagrees that no change in policy has occurred.  Arbitrariness can be\nfound not only in a change of official written policy, which may not have occurred here, but also\nthrough “a significant showing that analogous cases have been decided differently,” which\ncertainly has been made here.  LeMoyne-Owen Coll. v. National Labor Relations Bd., 357 F.3d\n55, 61 (D.C. Cir. 2004); see also California Pub. Utils. Comm’n v. Federal Energy Regulatory\nComm’n, 879 F.3d 966, 978 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding that the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission acted arbitrarily when it departed without explanation from a policy employed in\nprevious decisions).  However, even accepting Defendants’ conclusion leads to another obstacle,\none discussed in the Court’s prior order: that Defendants’ practices are unpersuasive and not\nentitled to deference.  See Arreola Order at 12.  Defendants cite to Chemehuevi Indian Tribe v.\nBrown, No. ED CV 16-1347-JFW (MRWx), 2017 WL 2971864 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2017), in\nwhich the court determined that an agency’s “consistent practice . . . in an area within its\nexpertise is itself entitled to at least traditional deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co. due, in\npart, to the agency’s specialized experience.”  Id. at *8 n. 9 (citation omitted).  Defendants also\npoint to fourteen instances when DACA was automatically terminated due to an NTA, as\nevidence of “consistent practice.”  See Thomas Decl. ¶ 5.  The Court, as it concluded previously,\n“does not find this availing.”  Arreola Order at 12.  Even accepting fourteen instances out of\nthousands of DACA terminations as a “consistent practice,” Defendants imply that such a\npractice is only entitled to deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), and is\ntherefore due “respect only insofar as [it has] the power to persuade, which is a function of the\nthoroughness evident in [its] consideration and the validity of [its] reasoning.”  Resident\nCouncils of Wash. v. Leavitt, 500 F.3d 1025, 1037 (9th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).  The Court cannot afford this practice much respect given that “it apparently conflicts\nwith the plain language of the DACA SOPs,” and would permit the issuance of an NTA to\nautomatically terminate DACA “notwithstanding the fact that the individual continues to be\neligible for DACA and that all DACA recipients, by definition, lack lawful immigration status.” \nArreola Order at 12.\nIn short, either the practice at issue constitutes an arbitrary and impermissible change in\nagency policy, or it conflicts with applicable regulations in such a way as to be entitled to little\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 30 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 31 of 37   Page ID #:1961\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\ndeference from this Court.  Either way, the Court finds the practice problematic and not immune\nfrom APA scrutiny.\nIn summation, Defendants’ opposition does not sway this Court from its previous\nconclusion that Plaintiffs make “a compelling argument that the decision to terminate [] DACA\nwas arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the APA.”  Arreola Order at 13.  Therefore,\nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.13\n2. Due Process Claim\nBecause the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ APA claim satisfies the first requirement of\nthe preliminary injunction inquiry, it need not consider their due process claim at this time.\nii. Irreparable Injury\nIn granting Plaintiff Arreola’s preliminary injunction, the Court concluded that “the\ndeprivation of Plaintiff’s earnings and job opportunities caused by the loss of his DACA and\n[accompanying employment authorization] constitutes irreparable harm.”  This conclusion also\napplies to the class as a whole.  Plaintiffs have provided evidence that, “like Plaintiffs, 91\npercent of DACA recipients were employed, including at top Fortune 500 companies,” and that\n69 percent of DACA recipients reported that their earnings “helped [them] become financially\nindependent.”  PI Mot. 20:1–5; see also Eiland Decl. ¶ 31, Ex. 16 at 2–3.  In addition, 94 percent\nof DACA recipients surveyed stated that, because of DACA, they “pursued educational\nopportunities that [they] previously could not.”  Eiland Decl. ¶ 31, Ex. 16 at 4.  After losing his\nDACA and employment authorization, Plaintiff Arreola lost his job as a cook at Chateau\nMarmont and could no longer work as a driver for Uber or Lyft, as he had previously done.  See\nDeclaration of Jesus Alonso Arreola Robles, Dkt. # 16-3 (“Arreola Decl.”), ¶ 40.  Plaintiff Gil\nlost his job with a logistics company, see Gil Decl. ¶ 24, and Plaintiff Moreira can no longer\nwork or drive.  See Moreira Decl. ¶ 20.  Defendants have given no reason to doubt that the loss\nof DACA and employment authorization will have a similarly deleterious effect on the other\nclass members.\n13 Defendants also suggest that employment authorization must be treated differently than\nDACA, arguing that “to reinstate individual EADs [Employment Authorization Documents]\nwould violate DHS regulations that operate independent of, and superior to, DACA policy.”  PI\nOpp. 3:16–17.  However, as the Court discussed in its prior order, it does not agree with\nDefendants and concludes that automatic revocation of employment authorization in these cases\nis inconsistent with the applicable regulations.  See Arreola Order at 11 n. 2.\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 31 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 32 of 37   Page ID #:1962\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nThe Ninth Circuit has held that “loss of opportunity to pursue [one’s] chosen profession”\nconstitutes irreparable harm.  Enyart v. National Conference of Bar Exam’rs, Inc., 630 F.3d\n1153, 1165 (9th Cir. 2011); see also Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 543\n(1985) (“We have frequently recognized the severity of depriving a person of the means of\nlivelihood.”).  Moreover, the Ninth Circuit has specifically found irreparable harm in a similar\ncase involving DACA recipients.  See Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068\n(9th Cir. 2014) (finding irreparable harm where professional opportunities are limited); see also\nid. (“The irreparable nature of Plaintiffs’ injury is heightened by Plaintiffs’ young age and\nfragile socioeconomic position.  Setbacks early in their careers are likely to haunt Plaintiffs for\nthe rest of their lives.”).  Furthermore, each of the named Plaintiffs has demonstrated that his\nearnings are used to support his family, see Arreola Decl. ¶¶ 2–5, 16; Gil Decl. ¶¶ 12, 26;\nMoreira Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10, which also suggests irreparable harm.  See Gonzalez Torres, 2017 WL\n4340385, at *6 (“The potential harm caused by Defendants’ conduct includes the loss of\nemployment, a core benefit under DACA.  The deprivation of employment impacts Plaintiff’s\nability to financially provide for himself and his family.”).    \nIn addition, Plaintiffs note that “losing DACA has rendered many proposed class\nmembers’ ineligible for driver’s licenses, which in the vast majority of states are conditioned on\nshowing lawful presence in the United States.”  PI Mot. 21:19–21; see also Eiland Decl. ¶ 32,\nEx. 17 at 2.  This likely explains why 90 percent of DACA recipients obtained driver’s licenses\nor state identification cards for the first time after receiving DACA.  Eiland Decl. ¶ 42, Ex. 27 at\n4.  The Court should also consider the emotional pain to which the named Plaintiffs have\nattested, see Arreola Decl. ¶ 40; Gil Decl. ¶ 26; Moreira Decl. ¶¶ 20, 22, which is also a\ncognizable form of irreparable injury.  See Chalk v. U.S. Dist. Ct., 840 F.2d 701, 709–10 (9th\nCir. 1988) (noting that a plaintiff’s injury is “emotional and psychological—and immediate” and\nthat “[s]uch an injury cannot be adequately compensated for by a monetary award after trial”);\nColotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1343–44 (“Plaintiff’s emotional distress caused by this insecurity is\nanother factor in determining that Plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury without the entry of a\npreliminary injunction which compels Defendants to comply with DHS’s SOP prior to denying\nPlaintiff her application to renew her DACA status or terminating that status.”).\nDefendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs and class members have suffered or will suffer\ninjury as a result of losing DACA, and indeed concede that “the loss of the ability to work is a\nsignificant harm.”  PI Opp. 24:15.  The Court therefore concludes that the loss of DACA\nconstitutes irreparable harm for Plaintiffs and class members.\niii. Balance of Hardships and Public Interest\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 32 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 33 of 37   Page ID #:1963\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nThe remaining two factors—balance of hardships and the public interest—merge when,\nas here, the government is the opposing party.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435.\nThere is undoubtedly a strong interest to be found in the effective and efficient\nenforcement of the nation’s immigration laws.  See, e.g., Reno, 525 U.S. at 490–91 (“[T]he\nconsequence of delay . . . in deportation proceedings . . . is to permit and prolong a continuing\nviolation of United States law.”).  However, as the Court previously concluded, this interest does\nnot outweigh the ongoing harm that Plaintiffs and class members have experienced or will\nexperience as a result of losing their DACA grants and employment authorization, especially\ngiven that the Court is “simply requiring Defendants to comply with DHS’s written procedures\nas to the adjudication of DACA applications and the termination of DACA status.  There can be\nno harm to Defendants in requiring them to follow their own written guidelines, but the harm to\nPlaintiff by Defendants’ failure to do so is significant.”  Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1344.  In\naddition, the Court again notes “the public interest that exists in ensuring that the government\ncomplies with its obligations under the law and follows its own procedures.”  Arreola Order at\n15; see also Brewer, 757 F.3d at 1069 (“[I]t is clear that it would not be equitable or in the\npublic’s interest to allow the state . . . to violate the requirements of federal law, especially when\nthere are no adequate remedies available.”) (alterations in original); Melendres v. Arpaio, 695\nF.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a\nparty’s constitutional rights.”); Colotl, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 1344 (“[T]he public has an interest in\ngovernment agencies being required to comply with their own written guidelines instead of\nengaging in arbitrary decision making.”).  Lastly, Plaintiffs note the significant financial\ncontributions of DACA recipients, both to their families—71 percent of DACA recipients\nsurveyed report that their increased earnings have allowed them to help their families financially,\nEiland Decl. ¶ 31, Ex. 16 at 3—and to the United States.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 34, Ex. 19 at 2\n(estimating that “ending DACA would result in a loss of $460.3 billion from the national GDP\nover the next decade” and “would remove an estimated 685,000 workers from the nation’s\neconomy”).  The public interest would not be served by eliminating class members’ abilities to\nsupport their families and contribute to the national economy.\nIn opposition, Defendants argue that class members’ injuries are “outweighed by the need\nfor Defendants to pursue removal for individuals like the named Plaintiffs who have misused the\ntrust given to them with the administrative grace of DACA.”  PI Opp. 24:15–17.  However,\nPlaintiffs do not seek a permanent reinstatement of their DACA grants, but only the notice and\nprocess that is required by the DACA SOP and other regulations.  If indeed any class members\nhave misused the trust given to them, then that can be determined and addressed through proper\nadjudication.  Defendants suggest that “the efficacy of [this] additional process . . . is\nquestionable because DHS and its components have already exercised prosecutorial discretion to\nend the putative class members’ DACA by deciding instead to place them into removal\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 33 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 34 of 37   Page ID #:1964\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v. Kirstjen Nielsen et al.\nproceedings.”  Id. 24:22–25.  Questionable or not, Plaintiffs do not seek a guarantee of continued\nDACA, but merely the ability to be heard and the privilege of receiving fair and nonarbitrary\ntreatment.  As the Court previously concluded, “the public has a strong interest in ensuring that\nthe nation’s immigration laws are robustly—and fairly—enforced.”  Arreola Order at 15\n(emphasis in original).\nIn short, the Court concludes that the harm to Plaintiffs and class members caused by\nautomatic DACA termination and the consequent risk of employment loss and financial\ninstability outweighs Defendants’ interest in immigration enforcement, particularly given the\nCourt’s skepticism as to the fairness and legality of Defendants’ practices.  If Defendants placed\ntheir trust in Plaintiffs and class members through the act of deferred action, then Plaintiffs and\nclass members in turn placed their trust in Defendants to only revoke DACA through a fair,\nnonarbitrary, and consistent process.  It is in the public’s interest that the expectations of both\nDefendants and Plaintiffs are realized, which requires equitable enforcement of the nation’s\nimmigration laws.\niv. Summation\nBecause Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their APA\nclaim and the existence of irreparable harm, and because neither a balancing of the hardships nor\nthe public interest favors Defendants, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for a classwide\npreliminary injunction.\nIV. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification\nand GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for a classwide preliminary injunction.\nA. Class Certification\nThe Court hereby CERTIFIES the following class under Rule 23(b)(2):\nAll recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) who, after\nJanuary 19, 2017, have had or will have their DACA grant and employment\nauthorization revoked without notice or an opportunity to respond, even though\nthey have not been convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense.\nThe Court also APPOINTS the moving Plaintiffs as Class Representatives and Plaintiffs’\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 34 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 35 of 37   Page ID #:1965\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

It is hereby ORDERED that Defendants’ decisions after January 19, 2017 to terminate\nthe DACA grants and EADs of class members, without notice, a reasoned explanation, or an\nopportunity to respond prior to termination, are preliminarily enjoined.  Defendants immediately\nwill restore those individuals’ DACA and EADs, subject to their original date of expiration.\n4. It is hereby ORDERED that Defendants accept and adjudicate any applications to renew\nDACA by individuals whose DACA grant and EAD would have expired on or before March 5,\n2018, but were unable to apply for or obtain a renewal as a result of Defendants’ unlawful\nrevocation decision, consistent with the terms of this Order.\nC.

If the individual’s restored DACA grant and EAD expired on or before\nthe date of this Order, Defendants temporarily will restore that individual’s DACA grant and\nEAD for the 60-day period to submit a renewal application.\n8. Defendants shall provide Class Counsel with a list of all DACA recipients whose DACA\ngrant and EAD was revoked after January 19, 2017 without issuance of a NOIT.  That list shall\ninclude the following information for each person:\n• Name, Alien Number, Mailing Address, and Phone Number;\n• The date the individual’s most recent DACA grant and EAD was granted;\n• The date the individual’s most recent DACA grant and EAD was set to expire;\n• The date the individual’s most recent DACA grant and EAD was revoked;\n• Whether the individual was found to have a disqualifying criminal conviction and, if so,\nwhat conviction(s);\n• If applicable, the date the individual’s DACA grant and EAD was restored.\nFor each such person, Defendants also will provide Class Counsel with copies of the Notices of\nAction previously terminating the person’s DACA grant and EAD, as well as the Notices of\nAction and EADs for individuals whose DACA grants and EADs are restored pursuant to this\nCV-90 (10/08) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 36 of 37\n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 61   Filed 02/26/18   Page 37 of 37   Page ID #:1967\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. EDCV 17-2048 PSG (SHKx) Date February 26, 2018\nTitle Inland Empire – Immigrant Youth Collective et al. v.

Plaintiffs, however, in asking this Court \n5 to “summarily deny the motion,” ignore the subsequent events and new authorities that \n6 give new shape to Defendants’ arguments for why this Court should grant the motion to \ndismiss the amended complaint, or, alternatively, to dismiss Plaintiffs Arreola and Inland \n7\nEmpire from the complaint if it is allowed to go forward. In fact, the Court has yet to \n8\naddress any of Defendants’ arguments in the context of Defendants’ standing arguments \n9\nagainst Plaintiffs Arreola and Inland Empire.   \n10\nAdditionally, the Court has yet to decide its jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims in \n11\nlight of the recent decisions in Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 (2018) and \n12\nCastellar v. Nielsen, No. 17-CV-0491-BAS-BGS, 2018 WL 786742 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 8, \n13\n2018). As explained below, both cases clarify and reinforce Defendants’ arguments that \n14\nsection 1252 bars this Court’s jurisdiction over the claims asserted here, and instead \n15\nchannels those claims through the Petition for Review process Congress designated. \n16\nDefendants would be remiss in forgoing the opportunity to present the Court with these \n17\nnew cases, particularly in light of the Parties’ changed circumstances, in the hopes of \n18\npersuading the Court to reach a different conclusion than it did on the facts and law as \n19\nthey were previously understood.   \n20\nTo be clear, Defendants’ position is that Congress has spoken unequivocally on the \n21\nmatter of when and where a claim “arising from any removal-related activity” may be \n22\nraised; and it is not before the administrative process has concluded and a final order of \n23\nremoval has issued, and it is not in a district court. See Castellar, 2018 WL 786742 at \n24\n*15. It is Defendants’ continuing position that the issues raised by Plaintiffs here, \n25\ntermination of their DACA as a consequence of the initiation of removal proceedings \n26\nagainst them—itself a consequence of each plaintiff’s criminal activity—falls squarely \n27\ninto the category of “removal-related activity” that this Court may not hear, and that no \n28\n    1 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 75   Filed 04/02/18   Page 3 of 11   Page ID #:2075\n \n   \n1 court may hear until Plaintiffs have exhausted their administrative remedies through the \n2 removal process.1  \n3 I.  New Supreme Court authority supports dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims. \n4\nIn addition to ignoring the changed circumstances that now apply to Defendants’ \n5\narguments, Plaintiffs continue to rely on incomplete selections from the Ninth Circuit’s \n6\nholding in J.E.F.M. to assert that section 1252(b)(9)’s jurisdiction channeling provision \n7\nonly applies after a final order of removal is issued, and that it does not bar review of \n8\nissues that an immigration judge has no authority to decide. See Dkt. No. 73 at 16. \n9\nHowever, recent decisions from the Supreme Court and the District Court for the \n10\nSouthern District of California directly support Defendants’ substantive arguments that \n11\nsections 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9) bar this Court’s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims. See \n12 Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 (2018); Castellar v. Nielsen, No. 17-CV-0491-\n13 BAS-BGS, 2018 WL 786742 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 8, 2018).  \n14 In Part II of the plurality opinion in Jennings, Justice Alito (joined by Chief Justice \n15 Roberts and Justice Kennedy) concluded that section 1252(b)(9) did not apply because \n16 the respondents in that case were not challenging “the decision . . . to seek removal [. . . \n17 or] any part of the process by which their removability will be determined.” 138 S. Ct. at \n18 841.  There can be no serious argument here that Plaintiffs are not challenging a part of \n19 the process by which their removability will be determined. See, e.g., Dkt. No. 73 at 13 \n20 (“The risk of being placed in removal proceedings is particularly high for IEIYC \n21 members who have had or will have contact with local law enforcement, since CBP \n22 officials may place DACA recipients whom they encounter in removal proceedings—\n23 even on the basis of an arrest.”) (internal citations omitted).  In addition, in his \n24 concurrence, Justice Thomas (joined by Justice Gorsuch) explained:  \n25\n26                                                  \n1 Defendants also maintain that the decision to initiate removal proceedings, and, to the extent the Court \n27 finds a separate decision is made, the decision to terminate DACA, are both entirely discretionary and \nbarred from review in any court, pursuant to Congress’ intent under 8 U.S.C. § 1252 and longstanding and \n28\nuncontroversial principles of agency discretion. See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985).  \n    2 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 75   Filed 04/02/18   Page 4 of 11   Page ID #:2076\n \n   \nThe text of [§ 1252(b)(9)] is clear. Courts generally lack jurisdiction over “all \n1\nquestions of law and fact,” both “constitutional” and “statutory,” that “aris[e] \n2 from” an “action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.” If an alien \nraises a claim arising from such an action or proceeding, courts cannot review \n3\nit unless they are reviewing “a final order” under § 1252(a)(1) or exercising \n4\njurisdiction “otherwise provided” in § 1252.  \n5\n138 S. Ct. at 853-54 (Thomas, J. concurring) (emphasis added). Thus, section 1252(b)(9) \n6\ndoes not lie feckless until a final order of removal issues, but rather acts as a channeling \n7\nprovision throughout the removal process to “put an end to the scattershot and piecemeal \n8\nnature of the review process.” Aguilar v. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 510 F.3d 1, 9-10 \n9\n(1st Cir. 2007) (cited favorably throughout J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d 1026). Whether the Court \n10\nagrees that it was permissible, it is indisputable that Defendants terminated each \n11\nPlaintiff’s DACA based on the initiation of removal proceedings against each Plaintiff. \n12\nChallenges to those decisions cannot be separated from the “action taken or proceeding \n13\nbrought to remove” them, such that section 1252(b)(9) would not bar this Court’s \n14\njurisdiction. Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 853-54; Castellar, 2018 WL 786742 at *14. \n15\nFurthermore, in J.E.F.M., the Ninth Circuit explicitly acknowledged that the \n16\nplaintiffs “are at various stages of the removal process: some are waiting to have their \n17\nfirst removal hearing, some have already had a hearing, and some have been ordered \n18\nremoved in absentia.” 837 F.3d at 1029; see also Castellar, 2018 WL 786742 at *14 \n19\n(“The jurisdictional channeling function of Section 1252(b)(9) is not defeated simply \n20\nbecause Plaintiffs are at a stage of the removal proceedings at which no final order of \n21\nremoval has issued against them.”), citing J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1029.  \n22\nAdditionally, the Castellar Court addressed and rejected as “selective reading” the \n23\nassertion that J.E.F.M. permits challenges to be raised in the district court “[w]here a \n24\nplaintiff ‘would have no legal avenue to obtain judicial review’ of his claims, section \n25\n1252(b)(9) does not bar those claims.” Castellar, 2018 WL 786742 at *15 n.6, citing \n26\nJ.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1032 and Singh v. Gonzalez, 499 F.3d 969, 979–80 (9th Cir. \n27\n28\n    3 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 75   Filed 04/02/18   Page 5 of 11   Page ID #:2077\n \n   \n1 2007);2 see Dkt. No. 73 at 18 (“Because Plaintiffs are unable to challenge the termination \n2 of their DACA in removal proceedings, §§ 1252(b)(9) and 1252(a)(5) do not preclude \n3 them from raising their challenge in district court.”).  \n4 Castellar placed the Ninth Circuit’s holding into proper context, and explained that \n5 Section 1252(b)(9) did not bar district court jurisdiction in the “unique situation” of Singh \n6 only because his ineffective assistance of counsel claim arose after his removal \n7 proceedings had ended. Id. Thus, rather than the issue being that the immigration judge \n8 could not grant the relief Singh sought, as Plaintiffs argue, the Ninth Circuit found that it \n9 was literally impossible for Singh to have raised his claim in removal proceedings at all. \n10 In fact, Singh denied Singh’s second ineffective assistance of counsel claim because it \n11 “arose before a final order of removal entered and [] could and should have been brought \n12 before the agency.” J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1032, citing Singh, 499 F.3d at 974 (emphasis \n13 added).  \n14 Importantly, J.E.F.M. also explained that the inability of the immigration judge to \n15 relieve a constitutional claim is not a valid reason to ignore the jurisdiction channeling \n16 functions of sections 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9). Id. at 1032-33. Castellar relied on J.E.F.M. to \nfind that, under sections 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9), “[b]eyond the[] limited and unusual \n17\ncircumstances [of Singh and Nadarajah,]3  . . . claims arising from any removal-related \n18\nactivity must be raised through the petition for review process.” Castellar, 2018 WL \n19\n786742 at *15 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs cannot show that the unusual issues in Singh \n20\n21\n22\n                                                 \n23\n2 Plaintiffs in Castellar raised Fourth and Fifth Amendment and APA claims regarding the delay between \nwhen they were detained and when they were first brought before an immigration judge to begin their \n24\nremoval proceedings. Id. at *4-6. Castellar plaintiffs raised the same three arguments raised here: (1) \n25 “their claims are independent of the substantive merits of their removal proceedings;” (2) “because their \nclaims do not require judicial review of a final order of removal, they may assert them now”; and (3) their \n26\nclaims “cannot be meaningfully heard in the administrative process.” Id. at *12, *14, *15. Castellar relied \non J.E.F.M. to reject all three claims. \n27\n3 Nadarajah v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 1069 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding jurisdiction in district court to hear a \n28\nhabeas challenge where plaintiff had been granted asylum but remained in detention for five years). \n    4 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 75   Filed 04/02/18   Page 6 of 11   Page ID #:2078\n \n   \n1 or Nadarajah apply here, and so this Court should grant Defendants’ motion to dismiss in \n2 its entirety.  \n3 II. Standing \n4\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Arreola and Inland Empire is an \n5\nalternative argument that assumes the Court rejected Defendants’ main argument that the \n6\nCourt lacks subject-matter jurisdiction in this matter entirely. In that context, Plaintiffs’ \n7\nargument that it is “wholly irrelevant” that Plaintiffs Arreola and Inland Empire lack \n8\nstanding is incorrect. Dkt. No. 73 at 8, citing Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & \n9\nInstitutional Rights Inc. (“FAIR”), 547 U.S. 47, 53 n.2 (2006). In fact, the Supreme Court \n10\nin FAIR was only affirming the Third Circuit’s finding that it possessed subject-matter \n11\njurisdiction at all. See 547 U.S. 47, 53 n.2 (“Because we also agree that FAIR has \n12 standing, we similarly limit our discussion to FAIR.”). Moreover, the key reasoning on \n13 which Plaintiffs appear to rely only supports standing for parties who are identically \n14 positioned. See id., citing Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721 (1986), citing Sec’y of the \n15 Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 319 n.3 (1984) (“Since the State of California clearly \n16 does have standing, we need not address the standing of the other respondents, whose \n17 position here is identical to the State’s.”) \n18   Here, Plaintiff Arreola presents entirely different arguments than those of the \n19 certified class—arguments he lacks standing to raise on his own and which, if allowed, \n20 will “waste [this Court’s] scarce judicial resources.” State of Cal., By & Through Brown \n21 v. Watt, 683 F.2d 1253, 1271 (9th Cir. 1982) (emphasis added), rev'd on other grounds \n22 sub nom. Sec'y of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312 (1984). The class is defined as \n23 individuals who have lost DACA without notice or an opportunity to respond, while \n24 Plaintiff Arreola argues he may lose his DACA at some time in the future based on \n25 allegations of an inadequate process that is not yet final. Dkt. No. 73 at 11-12. Similarly, \n26 Plaintiff Inland Empire offers no argument to overcome its lack of organizational \n27 standing.  \n28\n    5 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 75   Filed 04/02/18   Page 7 of 11   Page ID #:2079\n \n   \na.  Plaintiff Arreola’s claims became moot under the original complaint, and \n1\nhe thus lacks standing to assert an identical claim in an amended \n2 complaint.  \n3\nPlaintiffs incorrectly assert that the outset of the litigation is the only “relevant \n4\npoint in time for determining standing.” Dkt. No. 73 at 6, 8. As Defendants noted in their \n5\nmotion, when “a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then voluntarily amends \n6\nthe complaint, courts look to the amended complaint to determine jurisdiction.” Dkt No. \n7\n55at 17, citing Rockwell Int'l Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007). 4 This \n8\nCourt has previously found just the opposite, holding that “the reasoning in Rockwell did \n9\nnot indicate that the original complaint was irrelevant for purposes of determining \n10\njurisdiction; rather, it recognized that jurisdiction must be present throughout the duration \n11\nof the litigation, and not just at the initial filing of the Complaint.” United States ex rel. \n12\nLee v. Corinthian Colleges, No. CV071984PSGMANX, 2013 WL 12114015, at *8 (C.D. \n13\nCal. Mar. 15, 2013) (Gutierrez, J.), aff'd sub nom. United States v. Corinthian Colleges, \n14\n652 F. App’x 503 (9th Cir. 2016); Lim v. Helio, LLC, No. CV119183PSGACRX, 2012 \n15\nWL 12884439, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2012) (Gutierrez, J.) (“On April 4, 2011, the \n16\nCourt . . . deemed Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (‘FAC’) filed. Accordingly, the \n17\nFAC is the operative pleading.”); see also Civil Rights Educ. & Enf't Ctr. v. Hosp. \n18\nProperties Tr., 867 F.3d 1093, 1102 (9th Cir. 2017) (standing is determined on the \n19\namended complaint, because “the proper focus in determining jurisdiction are the facts \n20\nexisting at the time the complaint under consideration was filed”) (emphasis in original) \n21\n(citation omitted).  \n22\nPlaintiffs instead select half of a quote from Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw \n23\nEnvtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc. (“FOE”), 528 U.S. 167 (2000), to make the incorrect assertion \n24\n                                                 \n25\n4 Plaintiffs’ argument that Rockwell concerns jurisdiction but not standing is incorrect. Standing is the \n26 “irreducible constitutional minimum” necessary to assert federal court jurisdiction. Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife,  504  U.S.  555,  560  (1992).  Determining  a  court’s  subject-matter  jurisdiction  necessarily \n27 encompasses the question of standing. Preston v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1359, 1363 (9th Cir. 1984) (“The \nstanding doctrine is one component of the case or controversy requirement” to establish jurisdiction under \n28\nArticle III.).  \n    6 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 75   Filed 04/02/18   Page 8 of 11   Page ID #:2080\n \n   \n1 that the Supreme Court has held that standing is established once at the start of a case and \n2 then, apparently, may not be challenged throughout the litigation. Dkt. No. 73 at 9. \n3 Where no amended complaint had been filed in FOE, the Supreme Court in that case had \n4 no reason to discuss whether an amended complaint required new consideration of a \n5 plaintiff’s standing. 528 U.S. at 189. When it did address that issue subsequently, the \n6 Court found, as has the Ninth Circuit and this Court, that jurisdiction must be established \n7 from the allegations in an amended complaint. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 549 U.S. at 473.  \n8 While the amended complaint re-alleged all of the harms Plaintiff Arreola listed in \n9 the original complaint, Dkt. No. 32 at ¶¶ 78-85, it also acknowledged that Defendants \n10 reinstated his DACA grant and employment authorization and issued him a Notice of \n11 Intent to Terminate (“NOIT”) his DACA and work authorization, as well as a reason for \n12 the decision and an opportunity to respond. Id. at 87; Dkt. No. 73 at 12. The harm of \n13 losing his DACA and EAD that established his standing at the outset of this litigation \n14 simply no longer exists, and, given the issuance of the NOIT, the potential for Defendants \n15 to terminate his DACA without notice is too speculative and remote to establish standing. \n16 Or. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program v. U.S. Drug Enf’t Admin., 860 F.3d 1228, \n1235 (9th Cir. 2017).   \n17\nUnless and until Defendants actually terminate Plaintiff Arreola’s DACA again, he \n18\nhas no standing to challenge the intermediate step of Defendants issuing him a NOIT. \n19\nPreston v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1359, 1363–64 (9th Cir. 1984) (“An essential element of the \n20\nstanding requirement is that ‘the plaintiff . . . show that he personally has suffered some \n21\nactual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant.’”) \n22\n(quoting Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99 (1979)).  \n23\nFurthermore, from the time of filing the amended complaint to the present, there is \n24\nno final agency action that has caused Plaintiff Arreola any harm upon which to base this \n25\nCourt’s jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). See Ceja v. \n26\nNapolitano, No. EDCV1200466VAPOPX, 2012 WL 12881988, at *1 (C.D. Cal. May 15, \n27\n2012) (“[W]ithout a final agency action, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 704 of the APA do not \n28\n    7 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 75   Filed 04/02/18   Page 9 of 11   Page ID #:2081\n \n   \n1 vest the district court with jurisdiction . . .”), citing Nippon Miniature Bearing Corp. v. \n2 Weise, 230 F.3d 1131, 1137 (9th Cir. 2000).  \n3 For these reasons, Plaintiff Arreola should be dismissed from this matter.  \n4 b. Inland Empire lacks standing under both the original complaint and the \namended complaint.  \n5\nPlaintiff Inland Empire continues to assert only speculative injury to its members, \n6\nbased on the premise that Defendants have terminated the DACA of individuals who \n7\nhave not engaged in criminal activity, which Plaintiffs have yet to establish through a \n8\nsingle example. Dkt. No. 32 at 31 (“IEIYC DACA recipients are at risk of coming into \n9\ncontact with CBP officers and being screened for possible revocation of their DACA \n10\nwhen carrying out their day-to-day activities.”); Dkt. No. 73 at 13 (“The risk of being \n11\nplaced in removal proceedings is particularly high for IEIYC members who have had or \n12\nwill have contact with local law enforcement, since CBP officials may place DACA \n13\nrecipients whom they encounter in removal proceedings—even on the basis of an \n14\narrest.”) (citations omitted). The cases Plaintiffs cite to do not overcome this deficiency, \n15\nand largely do not even apply to Plaintiffs’ arguments.  \n16\nFirst, Plaintiffs misstate the Ninth Circuit’s holding in Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, \n17\nclaiming the Court found organizational standing based on the organization’s fear that its \n18\nmembers would be arrested under a new Arizona law. Dkt. No. 73 at 14. In reality, the \n19\nCourt found standing “[b]ecause the organizational plaintiffs have shown that their \n20\nmissions have been frustrated and their resources diverted as a result of § 13–2929.” 732 \n21\nF.3d 1006, 1019 (9th Cir. 2013). As Defendants pointed out in their motion and Plaintiffs \n22\nfail to address in their opposition, Plaintiff Inland Empire has not alleged any frustration \n23\nin its mission or diversion of its resources due to Defendants’ alleged DACA termination \n24\npractices.  \n25\nSecond, Plaintiffs’ citations to Hawaii v. Trump, 859 F.3d 741, 762 (9th Cir.), \n26\nvacated, 874 F.3d 1112 (9th Cir. 2017) and Georgia Latino All. for Human Rights v. \n27\nGovernor of Georgia (“GLAHR”), 691 F.3d 1250, 1260 (11th Cir. 2012), are equally \n28\n    8 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 75   Filed 04/02/18   Page 10 of 11   Page ID #:2082\n \n   \n1 misstated. Dkt. No. 73 at 14-15. Plaintiffs in those cases relied on individual standing to \n2 assert a harm, rather than organizational standing. See Hawaii, 859 F.3d at 762; GLAHR, \n3 691 F.3d at 1260. Furthermore, to the extent those decisions address organizational \n4 standing, those findings are based on allegations of frustration of their missions, and both \n5 opinions cite to evidence offered by the organizations of diversion of their resources in an \n6 effort to respond to the alleged harms. See Hawaii, 859 F.3d at 763-66; GLAHR, 691 F.3d \n7 at 1259-61. Thus, neither case supports Plaintiffs’ organizational standing arguments, and \n8 consequently, Inland Empire’s claims should be dismissed  \n9 c.  Plaintiffs fail to address the Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court holdings \nthat standing cannot be established on the fear of future harm that will \n10\nonly arise from a plaintiff’s unlawful conduct. \n11\nEven if Plaintiffs Arreola and Inland Empire established more than “[a]llegations \n12\nof possible future injury” necessary to create standing, Or. Prescription Drug Monitoring \n13\nProgram, 860 F.3d at 1235, they cannot overcome the fact that they have only presented \n14\nplaintiffs who have lost DACA due to having engaged in illegal conduct. Plaintiffs’ \n15\nresponse to Defendants’ assertion that standing cannot be based on a future harm that will \n16\nonly result from a plaintiff’s own illegal behavior, see Def.’s Motion at 17, is to assert \n17\nagain that the government concedes it may terminate DACA for an individual without a \n18\ncriminal conviction. Dkt. No. 73 at 15-16. Plaintiffs miss the point. The Ninth Circuit in \n19\nHodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina did not hold—and Defendants do not assert—that behavior \n20\nresulting in a criminal conviction is necessary to preclude Article III standing to \n21\nchallenge a future harm. 199 F.3d 1037, 1042 (9th Cir. 1999) (“denial of Article III \n22\nstanding in Lyons [was] based on the plaintiff's ability to avoid engaging in illegal \n23\nconduct.”), citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983). Here, Plaintiff Inland \n24\nEmpire argues that it has organizational standing on the basis that its members are at risk \n25\nof encountering an immigration enforcement officer, that officer arresting them, and then \n26\nplacing them in removal proceedings that would cause their DACA to terminate. Dkt. No. \n27\n73. However, this scenario is entirely speculative and based on the exact type of “string \n28\n    9 \n5:17-cv-2048-PSG-SHK \n\nCase 5:17-cv-02048-PSG-SHK   Document 75   Filed 04/02/18   Page 11 of 11   Page ID #:2083\n \n   \n1 of contingencies” the Ninth Circuit rejected in Hodgers-Durgin. 199 F.3d at 1042 (“In \n2 Lyons, further injury would have required another stop by the police, followed by post-\n3 stop behavior culminating in a chokehold.”).  \n4 Nor do Defendants suggest that, as Plaintiffs’ allege, individuals “should avoid \n5 driving near the Mexican border in order to avoid another stop by the Border Police.” \n6 Dkt. No. 73 at 16, citing 199 F.3d at 1041 (finding “untenable” the suggestion that an \n7 individual avoid engaging in “entirely innocent conduct” to avoid a future harm). \n8 Ultimately, Plaintiffs fail to address the fact that they have failed to identify one named or \n9 putative class member who lost DACA without having first engaged in illegal conduct. \n10 Thus, Plaintiff Inland Empire’s fear of speculative future harm to their members, based \n11 only on proximity to Border Patrol agents, lacks the imminence or certainty required for \n12 Article III standing, and it should be dismissed as a party.  \n13  \nDATED: April 2, 2018        Respectfully Submitted, \n14\nCHAD A.
