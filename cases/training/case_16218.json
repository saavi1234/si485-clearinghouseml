    "summary": "<p>On October 9, 2017, the State of Washington filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The State sued the President of the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), and the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The State, represented by public counsel, sought injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief as well as attorney’s fees and costs, claiming violations of the APA and the First and Fifth Amendments. The case was assigned to Judge Ronald Leighton.</p><p>The State challenged two sets of rules the Trump Administration introduced that expanded an employer’s ability to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage for female employees, which in turn greatly undercut contraceptive coverage introduced by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The first set of policies allowed any employer who asserted a religious objection to contraception—not just a church or religious order—to exempt itself from providing contraception coverage to its employees. The second set of policies allowed employers with moral objections to contraception to opt out of the ACA requirement. </p><p>The State alleged these rules violated the APA because the Trump Administration did not provide public notice or an opportunity for comment before changing substantive rights and obligations springing from the ACA, as required by the APA. But the State argued that even if the Administration had acted in accordance with the APA, the First and Fifth Amendments would have still been implicated. Furthermore, the State alleged that the policies substantially harmed its female residents. </p><p>On December 11, 2017, the defendants moved to dismiss, and alternatively for summary judgment, arguing that the State lacked standing to bring this lawsuit. The defendants also argued that the new regulations did not violate the Constitution or the APA. On January 2, 2018 the State filed an amended complaint to bolster its claims for standing to sue. Two days later, the defendant moved again to dismiss and alternatively moved for summary judgment in response.</p><p>The State moved to stay the lawsuit and the court granted this motion on January 19, 2018. The court ordered that all pending and forthcoming deadlines of this lawsuit would be stayed as long as either the December 21, 2017 injunction in <i>California v. Hargan</i>, or the December 15, 2017 injunction in <i>Pennsylvania v. Trump</i> remained in full force and effect. </p><p>Since the injunctions remained in place the rest of the year, there was no further action in this case until December 18, 2018, when the parties submitted a stipulation to the court to dismiss the case without prejudice, with each side agreeing to bear their own attorneys' fees and other costs. The Court ordered that the case be dismissed on December 19, 2018. </p><p>This case is now closed. </p>",

This suit challenges new rules issued by the Trump Administration that illegally \n24 \njeopardize women’s health and economic success in order to promote certain religious and moral \n25 \nviews. To make matters worse, the Administration implemented its new rules without regard to \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 2 of 30\n \n1  required legal procedures. The State of Washington brings this suit to protect the state and its \n2 \nwomen residents from the substantial harm the Administration’s new rules inflict. \n3 \n2.  The Affordable Care Act requires most health plans and insurance providers to \n4 \ncover certain preventive health services at no added cost to American men and women. The \n5 \ninitial version of the Act did not adequately cover medically necessary preventive care for \n6 \nwomen, such as contraceptive services and screening for gestational diabetes. But the Senate \n7 \n8  introduced the Women’s Health Amendment, and as finally enacted in 2010 the Affordable Care \n9  Act required health plans and insurance providers to include women’s preventive services at no \n10 \nout-of-pocket cost to women. \n11 \n3.  Contraceptive use among women is widespread, with over 99% of sexually active \n12 \nwomen using at least one method during their lifetime. Consequently, the Women’s Health \n13 \nAmendment has been a dramatic success. By 2013, most women had no out-of-pocket costs for \n14 \ntheir  contraception.  One  study  estimated  that  roughly  $1.4  billion  dollars  per  year  in \n15 \n16  out-of-pocket savings on the pill resulted from the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate. \n17 \n4.  The  economic  implications  for  women  also  are  dramatic.  Research  links \n18 \nwomen’s access to contraception to increases in the pursuit of college and advanced professional \n19 \ndegrees, and to career trajectories with higher pay and prestige. Access to reliable contraception \n20 \nhas contributed to women’s increased earning power and the narrowing of the gender gap in pay. \n21 \n5.  On October 6, 2017, the Trump Administration issued two new regulations that \n22 \n23  slashed the contraceptive coverage introduced by the Affordable Care Act. One new set of rules \n24  allows any employer, not just a church or religious order, that asserts a religious objection to \n25 \ncontraception to exempt itself from the requirement and carve out contraception coverage from \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 3 of 30\n \n1  its workplace insurance plan. The second set of rules authorizes certain employers with moral \n2 \nbut not religious objections to contraception to opt out of Congress’s requirement. Further, the \n3 \nnew regulations change the prior rules and now allow objecting employers to dictate whether \n4 \ntheir women employees can get contraception directly from the insurance provider, at no cost to \n5 \nthe employer. \n6 \n6.  The Administrative Procedure Act requires the federal government to provide \n7 \n8  public notice and opportunity for comment before changing substantive rights and obligations \n9  springing from the Affordable Care Act. Disregarding this obligation, the Trump Administration \n10 \nhas made the new rules effective immediately without notice and comment rulemaking. Even if \n11 \nthe Administration had complied with required procedures, its action would be illegal. The new \n12 \nregulations violate the Equal Protection guarantee and the Establishment Clause in the United \n13 \nStates Constitution, the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, and the non-discrimination \n14 \nprovisions of the Affordable Care Act, the Civil Rights Act, and the Pregnancy Disability Act. \n15 \n16  Finally, because the new regulations are arbitrary and capricious and ignore abundant evidence \n17 \nof the importance of contraceptive coverage to women’s health and economic opportunity, they \n18 \nviolate the substantive requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. \n19 \n7.  The new regulations apply to nonprofit and for-profit employers, as well as to \n20 \nprivate colleges or universities with religious or moral objections to contraception. As a result \n21 \nof the new regulations, choices about contraception coverage will be made by employers and \n22 \n23  private colleges and universities that issue student plans. For many women, their employers or \n24  universities  will  determine  whether  they  have  no-cost  coverage  for  the  full  range  of \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 4 of 30\n \n1  FDA-approved contraceptive methods. Their choice of contraception will once again be limited \n2 \nby their own financial means. \n3 \n8.  More than 2.4 million women in Washington are of child-bearing age. Up to \n4 \n1.5 million women in Washington State face losing contraception coverage as a result of the \n5 \nAdministration’s new regulations. Washington maintains state government-funded programs to \n6 \nensure Washington women have access to contraception and the economic opportunities it \n7 \n8  creates. Washington residents denied no-cost contraceptive coverage as a result of the new rules \n9  will be forced to turn to these programs to obtain contraceptive care. To prevent this injury to \n10 \nWashingtonians and the state’s finances, Washington brings this suit to declare illegal and enjoin \n11 \nthe new regulations. \n12 \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n13 \n9.  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 2201(a) and 2202. The \n14 \nUnited States’ sovereign immunity is waived by 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n15 \n16  10.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1) and \n17 \n5 U.S.C. § 703. Defendants are the President and three U.S. departments and their respective \n18 \ndepartment heads. The State of Washington is a resident of this judicial district and no real \n19 \nproperty is involved in this action. \n20 \nIII.  PARTIES \n21 \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF WASHINGTON \n22 \n23  11.  The Plaintiff is the State of Washington. The Attorney General is the chief legal \n24  adviser to the State of Washington.

The State has a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health and well-being \n6 \nof  its  residents.  This  interest  extends  to  ensuring  that  its  residents  have  access  to  a  full \n7 \n8  complement of affordable reproductive health care services, including contraception, and can \n9  make personal, private decisions about their reproductive health and family planning.  \n10 \n15.  The State also has an interest in avoiding greater costs to provide subsidized \n11 \ncontraception and costs relating to unintended pregnancies. \n12 \n16.  The State and its residents will suffer significant and irreparable harm if women’s \n13 \naccess to affordable contraception through employer-based health insurance is diminished.   \n14 \nDEFENDANTS \n15 \n16  17.

Statutory and Regulatory Background  \n3 \n1.  The Affordable Care Act and the Contraceptive Coverage Requirement  \n4 \n24.  In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. \n5 \nL.  111–148)  and  the  Health  Care  and  Education  Reconciliation  Act  of  2010  (Pub.  L. \n6 \nNo. 111-152) (collectively the ACA). The ACA aims to increase the number of Americans \n7 \n8  covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care. National Federation of \n9  Independent Business v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 538 (2012).  \n10 \n25.  The ACA, in its initial form, required non-grandfathered2 group health plans and \n11 \ninsurance providers to cover three categories of preventive health services at no added cost to \n12 \nthe plan participant or beneficiary: “(1) evidence-based items or services that have in effect a \n13 \nrating of ‘A’ or ‘B’ in the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services \n14 \nTask  Force;  (2)  immunizations  that  have  in  effect  a  recommendation  from  the  Advisory \n15 \n16  Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with \n17 \nrespect to the individual involved; and (3) with respect to infants, children, and adolescents, \n18 \nevidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided for in the comprehensive guidelines \n19 \nsupported  by  the  Health  Resources  and  Services  Administration.”  42  U.S.C. \n20 \n§ 300gg-13(a)(1)-(3). Prevention is a well-recognized, effective tool in improving health and \n21 \nwell-being and has been shown to be cost-effective in addressing many conditions early.3 \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n2 Grandfathered health plan coverage is that which has existed continually prior to March 23, 2010 and has \n24 \nnot undergone any of several specified changes since that time. 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251 (2010). The percentage \nof workers covered by grandfathered plans has decreased over time. http://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2017-\n25 \nsection-13-grandfathered-health-plans/.  \n \n26 \n3 Institute of Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps 16 (2011). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  7  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 8 of 30\n \n1  26.  Recognizing that the initial draft left out preventive services that “many women’s \n2 \nhealth advocates and medical professionals believe are critically important,” Senator Barbara \n3 \nMikulski introduced the Women’s Health Amendment, which added to the ACA’s minimum \n4 \ncoverage requirements a new category of preventive services specific to women’s health. \n5 \n155 Cong. Rec. 28841 (2009). The amendment’s proponents noted that women pay significantly \n6 \nmore than men for preventive care, and that such cost barriers operated to block many women \n7 \n8  from obtaining needed care at all. See, e.g., 155 Cong. Rec. 29070 (statement of Sen. Feinstein) \n9  (“Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than \n10 \nmen.”); id. at 29302 (statement of Sen. Mikulski) (“copayments are [often] so high that [women] \n11 \navoid getting [preventive and screening services] in the first place”). The sponsors noted that \n12 \nincreasing access to contraceptive services would yield important public health gains. See, e.g., \n13 \n155 Cong. Rec. 29768 (statement of Sen. Durbin) (“This bill will expand health insurance \n14 \ncoverage to the vast majority of the [17 million women of reproductive age in the United States \n15 \n16  who are uninsured] …. This expanded access will reduce unintended pregnancies.”). \n17 \n27.  As altered by the passage of the Women’s Health Amendment, the ACA requires \n18 \nnew insurance plans to include coverage without cost sharing of “with respect to women, such \n19 \nadditional  preventive  care  and  screenings  not  [otherwise  required]  as  provided  for  in \n20 \ncomprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration for \n21 \npurposes of this paragraph.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). Congress included this provision \n22 \n23  because “women have different health needs than men, and these needs often generate additional \n24  costs.” 155 Cong. Rec. 29,070 (2009) (statement of Sen. Feinstein). \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  8  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is a part of HHS. \n2 \nHRSA developed guidelines required under 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4) after consultation with \n3 \nthe Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM is an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, an \n4 \norganization established by Congress “for the explicit purpose of furnishing advice to the \n5 \nGovernment.” Public Citizen v. Dep’t of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 460, n.11 (1989). \n6 \n29.  The IOM convened a group of independent experts, including “specialists in \n7 \n8  disease prevention [and] women’s health,” which prepared a report evaluating the efficacy of a \n9  number of preventive services. See Institute of Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for \n10 \nWomen: Closing the Gaps 10 (2011) (IOM Report). The IOM defined preventive services as \n11 \nmeasures “shown to improve well-being, and/or decrease the likelihood or delay the onset of a \n12 \ntargeted disease or condition.” Id. at 3. \n13 \n30.  Based on the IOM’s review of the evidence, it recommended a number of \n14 \npreventive services for women, such as screening for gestational diabetes for pregnant women, \n15 \n16  screening and counseling for domestic violence, and at least one well-woman preventive care \n17 \nvisit a year. IOM Report at 8-12. Consistent with the findings of “[n]umerous health professional \n18 \nassociations” and other organizations, the IOM experts also determined that preventive coverage \n19 \nfor women should include the “full range” of FDA-approved contraceptive methods. IOM \n20 \nReport at 10, 102-110. FDA-approved contraceptive methods include oral contraceptive pills, \n21 \nrings, patches, diaphragms and cervical caps, injections, implants, emergency contraceptive \n22 \n23  drugs, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and sterilization.  \n24  31.  The  IOM  Report  noted  the  disproportionate  burden  women  carried  for \n25 \ncomprehensive health services and the adverse health consequences of excluding contraception \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  9  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

IOM Report at 19 (“[W]omen \n2 \nare  consistently  more  likely  than  men  to  report  a  wide  range  of  cost-related  barriers  to \n3 \nreceiving . . . medical tests and treatments and to filling prescriptions for themselves and their \n4 \nfamilies.”), 103-1-4, 107 (pregnancy may be contraindicated for women with certain medical \n5 \nconditions, for example, some congenital heart diseases, pulmonary hypertension, and Marfan \n6 \nsyndrome, and contraceptives may be used to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, among other \n7 \n8  serious medical conditions), 103 (women with unintended pregnancies are more likely to \n9  experience depression and anxiety, and their children face “increased odds of preterm birth and \n10 \nlow birth weight”). The IOM also noted that nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States \n11 \nare unintended, and that unintended pregnancies can have adverse health consequences for both \n12 \nmothers  and  children.  IOM  Report  at  102-103.  In  addition,  the  IOM  observed,  use  of \n13 \ncontraceptives leads to longer intervals between pregnancies, which “is important because of the \n14 \nincreased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for pregnancies that are too closely spaced.” Id. \n15 \n16  at 103. \n17 \n32.  Consistent  with  the  IOM’s  suggestions,  HRSA  adopted  guidelines \n18 \nrecommending access to “[a]ll [FDA-]approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, \n19 \nand patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity” as prescribed \n20 \nby  a  health  care  provider.

To address advancements in science and gaps identified in existing guidelines, \n5 \nincluding  a  greater  emphasis  on  practice-based  clinical  considerations,  HRSA  awarded  a \n6 \nfive-year cooperative agreement in March 2016 to convene a coalition of clinician, academic, \n7 \n8  and consumer-focused health professional organizations and conduct a scientifically rigorous \n9  review to develop recommendations for updated Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines in \n10 \naccordance with the model created by the IOM (now known as the National Academy of \n11 \nMedicine (NAM)).4 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was awarded the \n12 \ncooperative agreement and formed an expert panel called the Women’s Preventive Services \n13 \nInitiative (WPSI). WPSI submitted its report “Recommendations for Preventive Services for \n14 \nWomen” (hereinafter WPSI Report) to HHS in December 2016. WPSI Report at iii. As to \n15 \n16  contraception, WSPI recommended that adolescent and adult women have access to the “full \n17 \nrange of female-controlled contraceptives to prevent unintended pregnancy and improve birth \n18 \noutcomes.” WPSI Report at 18.  \n19 \n35.

Exemption for “Religious Employers” \n4 \n36.  While the Women’s Health Amendment succeeded, a countermove which would \n5 \nhave enabled any employer or insurance provider to deny coverage based on its asserted \n6 \n“religious beliefs or moral convictions,” the so-called “conscience amendment,” was voted down \n7 \n8  by the Senate. 158 Cong. Rec. S539 (Feb. 9, 2012), S1162-S1173 (Mar. 1, 2012) (debate and \n9  vote). That amendment, as observed by Senator Mikulski, would have “pu[t] the personal \n10 \nopinion of employers and insurers over the practice of medicine.” Id. at S1127 (Feb. 29, 2012). \n11 \n37.  Instead, implementing regulations authorized a much narrower exemption for \n12 \nreligious employers (defined as “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or \n13 \nassociations of churches,” and “the exclusively religious activities of any religious order” that \n14 \nare  organized  and  operate  as  nonprofit  entities.  45  C.F.R.  § 147.131(a);  26  U.S.C. \n15 \n16  §§ 6033(a)(3)A)(i),  (iii))  from  the  requirement  to  cover  contraceptive  services  under  the \n17 \nGuidelines. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a); 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621 (Aug. 3, 2011).  \n18 \n3.  Accommodation for “Eligible Organizations” \n19 \n38.  Implementing regulations also provided an accommodation to certain “eligible \n20 \norganizations”—nonprofit or closely held for-profit entities6 that object to providing coverage \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23  6 The regulations originally only provided an accommodation to nonprofit organizations. 78 Fed. Reg. \n39,870, 39,872, 39,874-39,886 (July 2, 2013). However, the Supreme Court held in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, \nInc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014), that that the contraceptive coverage requirement substantially burdened the free \n24 \nexercise of a “closely-held” for-profit corporation’s religion, and that since the government had not demonstrated \nthat the same accommodation provided to non-profits could not be made available to closely-held for-profits, the \n25 \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act prohibited the government from imposing the requirement on closely-held \ncorporations. 134 S. Ct. at 2785. Accordingly, the regulations were revised to make the accommodation from the \n26 \ncontraception mandate available to closely-held corporations. 80 FR 41,323-41,324. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  12  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 13 of 30\n \n1  for some or all of the contraceptive items or services required to be covered under the Act. \n2 \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); 26 C.F.R. 54.9815-2713A(a). Such entities could opt out of providing \n3 \ncontraceptive coverage by self-certifying to DOL or providing notice to the Secretary of HHS of \n4 \ntheir religious objections to coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services. 45 C.F.R. \n5 \n§ 147.131(b); 26 C.F.R. 54.9815-2713A(a).  \n6 \n39.  When a group health insurance issuer receives notice that one of its clients has \n7 \n8  invoked the accommodation provision, the issuer must then exclude contraceptive coverage from \n9  the  employer’s  plan  and  provide  separate  payments  for  contraceptive  services  for  plan \n10 \nparticipants without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the eligible organization, its \n11 \ninsurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c). In the case of self-insured \n12 \nreligious organizations entitled to the accommodation, the third-party administrator of the \n13 \norganization  must  “provide  or  arrange  payments  for  contraceptive  services”  for  the \n14 \norganization’s  employees  without  imposing  any  cost-sharing  requirements  on  the  eligible \n15 \n16  organization, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b). \n17 \nThus, women employed by  “eligible  organizations” were still entitled  under the ACA  to \n18 \ncoverage for FDA-approved contraception at no additional cost to themselves. \n19 \nB.  Executive Order 13798 \n20 \n40.  On May  4, 2017, President  Trump  signed  Executive Order 13798, entitled \n21 \n“Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty.” This Executive Order is attached to this \n22 \n23  Complaint as Exhibit D. The Executive Order directs the Secretaries of Treasury, DOL, and \n24  HHS to “consider issuing amended regulations, consistent with applicable law, to address \n25 \nconscience-based  objections  to  the  preventive-care  mandate  promulgated  under  section \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  13  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 14 of 30\n \n1  300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.” Under the express terms of the Executive Order, \n2 \nany amended regulations were required to comply with the ACA, as well as with federal \n3 \nnon-discrimination laws and the Constitution. \n4 \nC.  2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines \n5 \n41.  On October 6, 2017, relying in part on Executive Order 13798 as justification, \n6 \nHHS, DOL, and Treasury issued two sets of Interim Final Rules with respect to preventive care \n7 \n8  services for women required to be covered under the ACA (collectively referred to as the 2017 \n9  Interim Final Rules). \n10 \n42.  Taken together, the 2017 Interim Final Rules greatly expand eligibility for a \n11 \ncomplete exemption to the ACA’s requirement that employers ensure women have access to \n12 \ninsurance coverage for contraception without cost. The new regulations expand the entities to \n13 \nwhich the exemption is available. Rather than applying just to churches and religious orders, the \n14 \nexemption now applies to all for-profit or nonprofit employers that assert an objection to \n15 \n16  contraception based on their religious beliefs. Women employees of these employers now can \n17 \nbe required to pay for their contraception or, if they cannot, go without.  \n18 \n43.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules also expand the reason the exemption may be \n19 \nclaimed. The new regulations create an exemption for all employers, except those that are \n20 \npublicly traded, that have moral objections to contraception.  These employers too can deny their \n21 \nwomen employees insurance coverage for contraception. \n22 \n23  44.  Furthermore,  the  new  regulations  significantly  cut  back  the  previous \n24  accommodation that allowed women who worked for religiously affiliated non-profits or closely \n25 \nheld for-profit corporations to obtain contraception at no out-of-pocket cost. Most significantly, \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  14  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The new rules undercut the \n3 \nprevious system whereby women employees of objecting employers nevertheless were entitled \n4 \nto  obtain  insurance  coverage  of  contraception  from  the  insurance  carrier  or  third-party \n5 \nadministrator, at no cost to their employer. \n6 \n45.  Further, the expanded exemption also applies to private institutions of higher \n7 \n8  education that issue student health plans, where they object to contraception for religious or \n9  moral reasons. These institutions may single out contraception, among all of their male and \n10 \nfemale students’ health care needs, for denial of coverage. For these institutions, providing an \n11 \naccommodation that permits their female students to maintain insurance coverage for their \n12 \ncontraception at no cost to the institution is entirely voluntary.7 \n13 \n46.  The first set of 2017 Interim Final Rules issued by HHS, DOL, and Treasury, \n14 \nDocument 2017-21851 (scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on October 13, 2017), \n15 \n16  is entitled “Religious Exemptions and Accommodations for Coverage of Certain Preventive \n17  Services Under the Affordable Care Act” (hereinafter Religious IFRs).8 As stated, the Religious \n18 \nIFRs make the religious exemption available to any objecting entity that claims to object to \n19 \nestablishing, maintaining, providing, or arranging coverage, payments, or a plan that provides \n20 \ncoverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services based on its sincerely held religious \n21 \nbeliefs.

On October 6, 2017, HRSA also updated its “Women’s Preventive Services \n11 \nGuidelines” (hereinafter 2017 Updated Guidelines) to provide that “[t]hese Guidelines do not \n12 \nprovide for or support the requirement of coverage or payments for contraceptive services with \n13 \nrespect to a group health plan established or maintained by an objecting organization, or health \n14 \ninsurance coverage offered or arranged by an objecting organization” as set forth in the moral \n15 \n16  and  religious  IFRs  set  forth  above.

Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 17 of 30\n \n1  49.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines vastly expand the \n2 \nexemption from the contraception coverage requirement previously available only to religious \n3 \nemployers to include any “objecting organization,” which is defined to include any other kind \n4 \nof  entity  other  than  a  government  employer.  Under  the  2017  Interim  Final  Rules  and \n5 \n2017 Updated Guidelines, any entity that  “objects  to  establishing, maintaining, providing, \n6 \noffering, or arranging (as applicable) for coverage, payments, or a plan that provides coverage \n7 \n8  or payments for some or all contraceptive services” based on “religious beliefs,” or any similar \n9  nonprofit or for-profit entity with no publically traded ownership interests based on “moral \n10 \nconvictions” is completely exempt from the contraceptive mandate. \n11 \n50.  The  2017  Interim  Final  Rules  and  2017  Updated  Guidelines  make  the \n12 \naccommodation process—which provided a mechanism to ensure women still had access to \n13 \ncontraceptive coverage at no cost to the employer—entirely optional for all objecting entities \n14 \nentitled to exemption.  \n15 \n16  51.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules provide that “exempt entities will not be required \n17 \nto comply with a self-certification process.” Religious IFRs at 61; see also id. at 162 (45 C.F.R. \n18 \n§ 147.132(a)(2)). A company that wants to take advantage of the exemption need not certify that \n19 \nits owners have a religious or moral objection to contraception. It merely needs to drop or omit \n20 \ncontraception coverage from its plan’s terms and comply with other applicable law. \n21 \n52.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines are substantive \n22 \n23  changes  that  were  issued  prior  to  the  passing  of  any  notice  and  comment  period.  The \n24  Departments cited statutory general rulemaking authority as the basis for foregoing notice and \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  17  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Injuries to the State and Its Residents \n7 \n8  54.  Washington has standing to bring this action because Defendant’s 2017 Interim \n9  Final Rules and Updated 2017 Guidelines will cause immediate and substantial harm to the \n10 \nState’s quasi-sovereign, proprietary and parens patriae interests.  \n11 \n55.  The State’s quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health and well-being of its \n12 \nresidents includes ensuring that its residents have access to affordable contraception and can \n13 \nmake personal, private decisions about their reproductive health and family planning unfettered \n14 \nby their employers.  Indeed, the State’s has declared its interest in protecting individuals’ \n15 \n16  “fundamental  right  to  choose  or  refuse  birth  control”  through  statute.  Wash.  Rev.  Code \n17 \n§ 9.02.100. \n18 \n56.  Eliminating  the  requirement  for  coverage  of  contraception  services  by \n19 \nemployer-and higher education-sponsored health plans will also cause harm to Washington \n20 \ncitizens, whom the State represents through its parens patriae authority. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  18  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 19 of 30\n \n1  57.  Implementation  of  the 2017  Interim  Final  Rules  and  2017  Updated  HRSA \n2 \nGuidelines will affect the health and financial well-being of numerous women and families who \n3 \nreside in Washington.11  \n4 \n58.  Pregnancy is a medical condition that poses risks to, and consequences for, a \n5 \nwoman. \n6 \n59.  According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, “[a]ccess \n7 \n8  to contraception is a medical necessity for women during approximately 30 years of their \n9  lives.”12 \n10 \n60.  Virtually all (99%) sexually active women in the United States have used at least \n11 \none contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime. \n12 \n61.  Contraception use reduces the occurrence of unintended pregnancy and abortion.  \n13 \n62.  Contraceptive use also helps women and couples time and space their births, \n14 \nwhich helps to reduce the risk of poor birth outcomes, such as low birth weight, preterm birth, \n15 \n16  and small size for gestational age. \n17 \n63.  Without insurance coverage, contraception costs can exceed $1,000 a year. \n18 \n64.  Early research has also associated the contraception coverage requirement with a \n19 \nhistoric drop in the U.S. abortion rate that occurred in 2014. \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23  11 The available data focus on the impact of the provision or denial of contraception on women. However, \nthe State recognizes that the denial of coverage for reproductive health care also affects people who do not identify \nas women, including some gender non-conforming people and some transgender men. \n24 \n \n12 ACOG Statement on Supreme Court Remand of Zubik v.

Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 20 of 30\n \n1  65.  A recent nonpartisan poll found that a majority of women would struggle to afford \n2 \nbirth control if they had a co-pay.13   \n3 \n66.  Contraception coverage also impacts women’s educations, careers, and economic \n4 \nstanding. “The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the \n5 \nNation  has  been  facilitated  by  their  ability  to  control  their  reproductive  lives.”  Planned \n6 \nParenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 856 (1992). The availability of \n7 \n8  contraceptives has been associated with wage gains made by women since the advent of legal \n9  methods of birth control in the 1960s. \n10 \n67.  Some contraceptive methods also are used for noncontraceptive purposes, such \n11 \nas treatment for acne, menstrual pain, and endometriosis. \n12 \n68.  American women have saved approximately $1.4 billion per year on birth control \n13 \npills alone since the ACA began requiring coverage of contraception benefits. Prior to enactment \n14 \nof the ACA, contraception accounted for between 30% and 44% of women’s out-of-pocket \n15 \n16  expenses for health care costs. When the ACA required coverage for contraception, women’s \n17 \nout-of-pocket costs declined 38% for birth control pills and 68% for IUDs.  \n18 \n69.  Washington has a Contraceptive Parity Rule that requires health plans that offer \n19 \ncoverage  of  prescription  drugs  or  devices  to  provide  equal  coverage  for  prescription \n20 \ncontraceptives. WAC 284-43-5150. This Rule, however, does not apply to employer self-funded \n21 \ninsurance plans, which are governed by ERISA. \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n13 https://www.scribd.com/document/342699692/PerryUndem-Gender-and-Birth-Control-Access-Report. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  20  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 21 of 30\n \n1  70.  Removing the requirement for employer-sponsored plans to cover contraception \n2 \nwill increase overall health care costs for Washington residents and increase their risk of poorer \n3 \nhealth outcomes.  \n4 \n71.  According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, more than \n5 \n2.4 million women of child-bearing age reside in Washington. Bureau of Labor Statistics data \n6 \nreveals that the total civilian workforce in Washington in 2016 was 3,639,000. Of those, \n7 \n8  approximately  1.7  million  workers  were  women  and  approximately  1.3  million  were  of \n9  child-bearing age. \n10 \n72.  Nationally, at least 61% of all covered employees are enrolled in employers’ \n11 \nself-funded insurance plans. \n12 \n73.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines will impact up to \n13 \n1.5 million insureds – plus their spouses and dependents – in Washington who receive insurance \n14 \nthough their employers’ self-funded plans. Considering only women of child-bearing age in the \n15 \n16  civilian workforce, and not spouses or daughters of other insureds, the new rules will impact up \n17 \nto 800,000 women in Washington. \n18 \n74.  In  addition  to  the  impact  on  Washington  residents,  the  implementation  of \n19 \n2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines will increase the costs borne by the State \n20 \nas residents who lose coverage for contraception through their employer seek coverage through \n21 \nState-subsidized  programs  which  provide  subsidized  contraceptive  coverage,  including \n22 \n23  Medicaid.   \n24  75.  Washington  subsidizes family  planning  services  through  the  Department  of \n25 \nHealth’s Family Planning Program (Family Planning Program), a Title X Family Planning \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  21  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 22 of 30\n \n1  Program. See 42 U.S.C. § 300. This program  provides for family planning, and it funds \n2 \n13 agencies with 71 clinic sites throughout Washington that offer affordable contraceptive \n3 \nservices, including birth control and long-acting reversible contraception. In 2016, health care \n4 \nproviders funded through the Family Planning Program served 90,168 clients in over 125,316 \n5 \nclinic visits in Washington. \n6 \n76.  Washington’s Department of Health provides reproductive health services to \n7 \n8  individuals with incomes that are less than 251% of the Federal Poverty Level on a sliding fee \n9  scale. Washington State provides $8.8 million of funding to the Family Planning Program per \n10 \nyear. Some women who lose coverage for contraception from their employers will be forced to \n11 \nseek contraception from the Family Planning Program. \n12 \n77.  The Washington Health Care Authority administers the Take Charge Program \n13 \nwhich provides family planning services, including the provision of contraception, to uninsured \n14 \nindividuals with income below 260% of the Federal Poverty Level. The Take Charge Program \n15 \n16  is authorized through a Section 1115 waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n17 \nServices as a research and demonstration project.  See 42 U.S.C. §1315. Take Charge is funded \n18 \nby state and federal dollars. Some women who lose coverage for contraception from their \n19 \nemployers will be forced to seek contraception from the Take Charge Program. \n20 \n78.  The  reduction  in  employer-based  coverage  of  contraception  for  women  of \n21 \nreproductive capacity will result in more unintended pregnancies in Washington. Increased \n22 \n23  unintended pregnancies will cause Washington’s Medicaid program to incur greater costs in \n24  covering prenatal care and delivery services for low-income women. Additionally, individuals \n25 \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  22  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 23 of 30\n \n1  who increase the size of their family may become Medicaid eligible and cause the Medicaid \n2 \nprogram to incur greater costs. \n3 \n79.  Washington’s 2013 unintended pregnancy rate was 37%. \n4 \n80.  Washington’s  Medicaid  program  provides  coverage  for  prenatal  care  and \n5 \ndelivery services for women at or below 193% of the Federal Poverty Level. See Wash. Admin. \n6 \nCode § 182-505-0115.  \n7 \n8  81.  In 2010, the cost of Medicaid-financed prenatal care and delivery in Washington \n9  was $220 million, or $10,124 per birth. Fifty-one percent of these Medicaid-covered births \n10 \nresulted from unintended pregnancies. Limiting access to contraceptives will likely increase the \n11 \nnumber of unplanned births that are publicly funded in Washington, and the State’s costs will \n12 \nincrease for each additional birth. \n13 \n82.  In 2016, pregnancy-related expenses in Washington, including payments by both \n14 \nthe Department of Health and Medicaid, were $426,513,331.  \n15 \n16  V.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \n17 \nCount I \nViolation of the Fifth Amendment—Equal Protection \n18 \n83.  The State realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in each \n19 \n20  of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n21  84.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \n22 \nConstitution requires equal protection of the laws. \n23 \n85.  The ACA mandates that non-grandfathered insurance plans provide coverage for \n24 \npreventive care for men and women.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines \n25 \ncarve out an exemption specific to women’s reproductive health care. As a result of Defendants’ \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  23  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 24 of 30\n \n1  new regulations, generally only women, not men, may have coverage for reproductive health \n2 \ncare denied based on their employer’s religious or moral objection. \n3 \n86.  The  2017  Interim  Final  Rules  and  2017  Updated  Guidelines  intentionally \n4 \ninterfere with women’s ability to access necessary preventive care which is necessary to their \n5 \nequal participation in education, the workforce, and other elements of economic opportunity in \n6 \nour country. \n7 \n8  87.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines also perpetuate \n9  gender stereotypes. \n10 \n88.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules and corresponding exemption in the 2017 Updated \n11 \nGuidelines  do  not  serve  an  important  governmental  objective  sufficient  to  justify  the \n12 \ngender-based discrimination. \n13 \n89.  By purporting to legally authorize employers, institutions of higher education, \n14 \nand other entities to deny only women the preventive health benefits that they need, the \n15 \n16  2017 Interim Final Rules and the 2017 Updated HRSA Guidelines classify based on gender and \n17 \ntherefore  violate  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \n18 \nConstitution. \n19 \n90.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the 2017 Interim Final \n20 \nRules and 2017 Updated Guidelines, the State and its citizens will continue to be harmed by \n21 \nDefendants’ illegal actions. \n22 \n23  Count II \nViolation of the First Amendment—Establishment Clause \n24 \n91.  The State realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in each \n25 \nof the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  24  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \n  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 25 of 30\n \n1  92.  The  Establishment  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment  prohibits  the  federal \n2 \ngovernment from preferring one religion over another, and requiring people to bear the burdens \n3 \nof religions to which they do not belong. \n4 \n93.  The  Religious  IFRs  and  the  corresponding  portion  of  the  2017  Updated \n5 \nGuidelines are intended to and have the effect of advancing, imposing, and endorsing certain \n6 \nreligious interests. For example, they permit a for-profit business to impose the costs of its \n7 \n8  owners’ anti-contraception beliefs on employees (and their dependents). Based on the religious \n9  beliefs of an employer or institution of higher education, the Religious IFRs deny women access \n10 \nto contraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure. \n11 \n94.  The  Religious  IFRs  allow  employers  to  decide  whether  employees  receive \n12 \nseparate  contraceptive  coverage  through  the  accommodation  process,  at  no  cost  to  the \n13 \nemployers. Employers have no legitimate interest in injecting their religious beliefs into this \n14 \nindependent method for providing contraceptive coverage. \n15 \n16  95.  Through their actions, including those described above, Defendants have violated \n17 \nthe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. \n18 \n96.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the 2017 Interim Final \n19 \nRules and 2017 Updated Guidelines, the State and its residents will continue to be harmed by \n20 \nDefendants’ illegal actions. \n21 \nCount III \n22 \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n23  Procedural Violations \n24  1.

The 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines have changed the \n2 \nsubstantive rights and obligations imposed by the Affordable Care Act and prior implementing \n3 \nregulations on employers, issuers, and others. \n4 \n3.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines constitute final \n5 \nagency action and are legislative rules within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act \n6 \n4.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines purport to take effect \n7 \n8  immediately, without the required 30-day waiting period between publication and effective date, \n9  without good cause for doing so. \n10 \n5.  The  2017  Interim  Final  Rules  and  2017  Updated  Guidelines  were  adopted \n11 \nwithout observing the notice and comment procedures required by the Administrative Procedure \n12 \nAct, which include publishing the proposed rule, allowing an appropriate time for “interested \n13 \npersons [to have] an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written \n14 \ndata, views, or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation.” 5 U.S.C. §§553(b), \n15 \n16  (c). \n17 \n6.  The  Defendants  did  not  have  good  cause  to  forgo  notice  and  comment \n18 \nrulemaking. \n19 \n7.  Therefore,  Defendants  have  taken  agency  action  not  in  observance  with \n20 \nprocedures required by law, and the State is entitled to relief pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 553 and \n21 \n706(2)(D). \n22 \n23  8.  Absent injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the Interim Final Rules \n24  and 2017 Updated Guidelines, the State and its residents will continue to be harmed by \n25 \nDefendants’ illegal actions. \n26 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  26  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The State realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in each \n4 \nof the preceding paragraphs. \n5 \n10.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines reverse a prior \n6 \nagency decision without providing a reasoned explanation for this change in policy. \n7 \n8  11.  The  2017  Interim  Final  Rules  and  2017  Updated  Guidelines  are  not \n9  evidence-based or evidence-informed. \n10 \n12.  Defendants’ explanation for their decision to exempt any entity with religious or \n11 \nmoral objections runs counter to the evidence submitted during the comment period for these \n12 \n2017 Interim Final Rules and the predecessor rules. \n13 \n13.  Thus, Defendants’ issuance of the 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated \n14 \nGuidelines was arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n15 \n16  14.

The State realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in each \n7 \nof the preceding paragraphs. \n8 \n16.  The APA requires that agency action that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \n9 \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” “not in accordance with law” or “contrary \n10 \nto constitutional right” be held unlawful and set aside. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n11 \n12  17.  The  2017  Interim  Final  Rules  and  2017  Updated  Guidelines,  which  allow \n13  employers to choose whether their employees will receive coverage for contraception, are not in \n14 \naccordance with and in excess of statutory authority set forth in the ACA, which require coverage \n15 \nfor preventive services for women and do not provide an exception for religious or moral \n16 \nobjections. 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \n17 \n18.  The expanded exemptions are not required by the Religious Freedom Restoration \n18 \nAct or any other provision of federal law. \n19 \n20  19.  The 2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines are contrary to the \n21  constitutional protections afforded by the First and Fifth Amendments, as described above. \n22 \n20.

These interim final rules expand exemptions to protect religious beliefs \nfor certain entities and individuals whose health plans are subject to a mandate of contraceptive \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 3 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     2  \n \ncoverage through guidance issued pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \nThese rules do not alter the discretion of the Health Resources and Services Administration \n(HRSA), a component of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to \nmaintain the guidelines requiring contraceptive coverage where no regulatorily recognized \nobjection exists.  These rules also leave the “accommodation” process in place as an optional \nprocess for certain exempt entities that wish to use it voluntarily.  These rules do not alter \nmultiple other Federal programs that provide free or subsidized contraceptives for women at risk \nof unintended pregnancy. \nDATES:  Effective date:  These interim final rules and temporary regulations are effective on \nOctober 6, 2017. \nComment date:  Written comments on these interim final rules are invited and must be received \nby December 5, 2017. \nADDRESSES:  Written comments may be submitted to the Department of Health and Human \nServices as specified below.

Background \nCongress has consistently sought to protect religious beliefs in the context of health care \nand human services, including health insurance, even as it has sought to promote access to health \nservices.1  Against that backdrop, Congress granted the Health Resources and Services \n                                                           \n1 See, for example, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7 (protecting individuals and health care entities from being required to provide \nor assist sterilizations, abortions, or other lawful health services if it would violate their “religious beliefs or moral \nconvictions”); 42 U.S.C. 238n (protecting individuals and entities that object to abortion); Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2017, Div.

Public Health Service Act section 2713(a)(4). \nHRSA exercised that discretion under the last Administration to require health coverage for, \namong other things, certain contraceptive services,2 while the administering agencies—the \nDepartments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury (collectively, “the \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nany requirement of “the provision of contraceptive coverage by health insurance plans” in the District of Columbia, \n“it is the intent of Congress that any legislation enacted on such issue should include a ‘conscience clause’ which \nprovides exceptions for religious beliefs and moral convictions.”); Id. at Div.

Many individuals and entities challenged the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement and regulations (hereinafter, the “contraceptive Mandate,” or the “Mandate”) as \nbeing inconsistent with various legal protections, including the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct, 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1.  Much of that litigation continues to this day.  \nThe Departments have recently exercised our discretion to reevaluate these exemptions \nand accommodations.  This evaluation includes consideration of various factors, such as the \ninterests served by the existing Guidelines, regulations, and accommodation process4; the \nextensive litigation; Executive Order 13798, “Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty” \n(May 4, 2017); protection of the free exercise of religion in the First Amendment and by \nCongress in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993; Congress’ history of providing \nprotections for religious beliefs regarding certain health services (including contraception, \nsterilization, and items or services believed to involve abortion); the discretion afforded under \nsection 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act; the structure and intent of that provision in the broader \ncontext of section 2713 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; the regulatory \nprocess and comments submitted in various requests for public comments (including in the \nDepartments’ 2016 Request for Information).  \nIn light of these factors, the Departments issue these new interim final rules to better \nbalance the Government’s interest in ensuring coverage for contraceptive and sterilization \n                                                           \n3 Note, however, that in sections under headings listing only two of the three Departments, the term “Departments” \ngenerally refers only to the two Departments listed in the heading. \n4 In this document, we generally use “accommodation” and “accommodation process” interchangeably. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 9 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     8  \n \nservices in relation to the Government’s interests, including as reflected throughout Federal law, \nto provide conscience protections for individuals and entities with sincerely held religious beliefs \nin certain health care contexts, and to minimize burdens in our regulation of the health insurance \nmarket. \nA.   The Affordable Care Act  \nCollectively, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148), enacted \non March 23, 2010, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-\n152), enacted on March 30, 2010, are known as the Affordable Care Act.  In signing the \nAffordable Care Act, President Obama issued Executive Order 13535 (March 24, 2010), which \ndeclared that, “[u]nder the Act, longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience (such as the \nChurch Amendment, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7, and the Weldon Amendment, section 508(d)(1) of Public \nLaw 111-8) remain intact” and that “[n]umerous executive agencies have a role in ensuring that \nthese restrictions are enforced, including the HHS.” \nThe Affordable Care Act reorganizes, amends, and adds to the provisions of part A of \ntitle XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) relating to group health plans and health \ninsurance issuers in the group and individual markets.  In addition, the Affordable Care Act adds \nsection 715(a)(1) to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and section \n9815(a)(1) to the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to incorporate the provisions of part A of title \nXXVII of the PHS Act into ERISA and the Code, and thereby make them applicable to certain \ngroup health plans regulated under ERISA or the Code.  The sections of the PHS Act \nincorporated into ERISA and the Code are sections 2701 through 2728 of the PHS Act. \nThese interim final rules concern section 2713 of the PHS Act.  Where it applies, section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act requires coverage without cost sharing for “such additional” women’s \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 10 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     9  \n \npreventive care and screenings “as provided for” and “supported by” guidelines developed by \nHRSA/HHS.  The Congress did not specify any particular additional preventive care and \nscreenings with respect to women that HRSA could or should include in its Guidelines, nor did \nCongress indicate whether the Guidelines should include contraception and sterilization.   \nThe Departments have consistently interpreted section 2714(a)(4) PHS Act’s grant of \nauthority to include broad discretion to decide the extent to which HRSA will provide for and \nsupport the coverage of additional women’s preventive care and screenings in the Guidelines.  In \nturn, the Departments have interpreted that discretion to include the ability to exempt entities \nfrom coverage requirements announced in HRSA’s Guidelines.  That interpretation is rooted in \nthe text of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, which allows HRSA to decide the extent to which \nthe Guidelines will provide for and support the coverage of additional women’s preventive care \nand screenings.  \nAccordingly, the Departments have consistently interpreted section 2713(a)(4) of the \nPHS Act’s reference to “comprehensive guidelines supported by HRSA for purposes of this \nparagraph” to grant HRSA authority to develop such Guidelines.  And because the text refers to \nGuidelines “supported by HRSA for purposes of this paragraph,” the Departments have \nconsistently interpreted that authority to afford HRSA broad discretion to consider the \nrequirements of coverage and cost-sharing in determining the nature and extent of preventive \ncare and screenings recommended in the guidelines.  (76 FR 46623).  As the Departments have \nnoted, these Guidelines are different from “the other guidelines referenced in section 2713(a) of \nthe PHS Act, which pre-dated the Affordable Care Act and were originally issued for purposes of \nidentifying the non-binding recommended care that providers should provide to patients.”  Id.  \nGuidelines developed as nonbinding recommendations for care implicate significantly different \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 11 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     10  \n \nlegal and policy concerns than guidelines developed for a mandatory coverage requirement.  To \nguide HRSA in exercising the discretion afforded to it in section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, the \nDepartments have previously promulgated regulations defining the scope of permissible \nexemptions and accommodations for such guidelines.  (45 CFR 147.131).  The interim final rules \nset forth herein are a necessary and appropriate exercise of the authority of HHS, of which \nHRSA is a component, and of the authority delegated to the Departments collectively as \nadministrators of the statutes.  (26 U.S.C. 9833; 29 U.S.C. 1191c; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-92) \nOur interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act is confirmed by the Affordable \nCare Act’s statutory structure.  Congress did not intend to require entirely uniform coverage of \npreventive services (76 FR 46623).  To the contrary, Congress carved out an exemption from \nsection 2713 of the PHS Act for grandfathered plans.  In contrast, this exemption is not \napplicable to many of the other provisions in Title I of the Affordable Care Act—provisions \npreviously referred to by the Departments as providing “particularly significant protections.” (75 \nFR 34540).  Those provisions include: section 2704 of the PHS Act, which prohibits preexisting \ncondition exclusions or other discrimination based on health status in group health coverage; \nsection 2708 of the PHS Act, which prohibits excessive waiting periods (as of January 1, 2014); \nsection 2711 of the PHS Act, which relates to lifetime limits; section 2712 of the PHS Act, \nwhich prohibits rescission of health insurance coverage; section 2714 of the PHS Act, which \nextends dependent coverage until age 26; and section 2718 of the PHS Act, which imposes a \nmedical loss ratio on health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets (for insured \ncoverage), or requires them to provide rebates to policyholders. (75 FR 34538, 34540, 34542).  \nConsequently, of the 150 million nonelderly people in America with employer-sponsored health \ncoverage, approximately 25.5 million are estimated to be enrolled in grandfathered plans not \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 12 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     11  \n \nsubject to section 2713 of the PHS Act.5  As the Supreme Court observed, “there is no legal \nrequirement that grandfathered plans ever be phased out.”  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., \n134 S. Ct. 2751, 2764 n.10 (2014). \nThe Departments’ interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to permit HRSA to \nestablish exemptions from the Guidelines, and of the Departments’ own authority as \nadministering agencies to guide HRSA in establishing such exemptions, is also consistent with \nExecutive Order 13535.  That order, issued upon the signing of the Affordable Care Act, \nspecified that “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience . . . remain intact,” including \nlaws that protect religious beliefs (and moral convictions) from certain requirements in the health \ncare context.  While the text of Executive Order 13535 does not require the expanded \nexemptions issued in these interim final rules, the expanded exemptions are, as explained below, \nconsistent with longstanding Federal laws to protect religious beliefs regarding certain health \nmatters, and are consistent with the intent that the Affordable Care Act would be implemented in \naccordance with the protections set forth in those laws. \nB.  The Regulations Concerning Women’s Preventive Services \nOn July 19, 2010, the Departments issued interim final rules implementing section 2713 \nof the PHS Act (75 FR 41726).  Those interim final rules charged HRSA with developing the \nGuidelines authorized by section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS.  \n1.  The Institute of Medicine Report \nIn developing the Guidelines, HRSA relied on an independent report from the Institute of \nMedicine (IOM, now known as the National Academy of Medicine) on women’s preventive \nservices, issued on July 19, 2011, “Clinical Preventive Services for Women, Closing the Gaps” \n                                                           \n5 Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits, 2017 Annual \nSurvey,” available at http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-2017. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 13 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     12  \n \n(IOM 2011).  The IOM’s report was funded by the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for \nPlanning and Evaluation (ASPE), pursuant to a funding opportunity that charged the IOM to \nconduct a review of effective preventive services to ensure women’s health and well-being.6  \nThe IOM made a number of recommendations with respect to women’s preventive \nservices.  As relevant here, the IOM recommended that the Guidelines cover the full range of \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, \nand patient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity.  Because FDA \nincludes in the category of “contraceptives” certain drugs and devices that may not only prevent \nconception (fertilization), but may also prevent implantation of an embryo,7 the IOM’s \nrecommendation included several contraceptive methods that many persons and organizations \nbelieve are abortifacient—that is, as causing early abortion—and which they conscientiously \noppose for that reason distinct from whether they also oppose contraception or sterilization.   \nOne of the 16 members of the IOM committee, Dr. Anthony LoSasso, a Professor at the \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, wrote a formal dissenting opinion. He \nargued that the IOM committee did not have sufficient time to evaluate fully the evidence on \nwhether the use of preventive services beyond those encompassed by the United States \nPreventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), HRSA’s Bright Futures Project, and the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) leads to lower rates of disability or disease and \nincreased rates of well-being.  He further argued that “the recommendations were made without \nhigh quality, systematic evidence of the preventive nature of the services considered,” and that \n                                                           \n6 Because section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act specifies that the HRSA Guidelines shall include preventive care and \nscreenings “with respect to women,” the Guidelines exclude services relating to a man’s reproductive capacity, such \nas vasectomies and condoms. \n7 FDA’s guide “Birth Control: Medicines To Help You,” specifies that various approved contraceptives, including \nLevonorgestrel, Ulipristal Acetate, and IUDs, work mainly by preventing fertilization and “may also work ... by \npreventing attachment (implantation) to the womb (uterus)” of a human embryo after fertilization.  Available at \nhttps://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepublications/ucm313215.htm. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 14 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     13  \n \n“the committee process for evaluation of the evidence lacked transparency and was largely \nsubject to the preferences of the committee’s composition.  Troublingly, the process tended to \nresult in a mix of objective and subjective determinations filtered through a lens of advocacy.” \nDr. LoSasso also raised concerns that the committee did not have time to develop a framework \nfor determining whether coverage of any given preventive service leads to a reduction in \nhealthcare expenditure.8  (IOM 2011 at 231–32).  In its response to Dr. LoSasso, the other 15 \ncommittee members stated, in part, that “At the first committee meeting, it was agreed that cost \nconsiderations were outside the scope of the charge, and that the committee should not attempt to \nduplicate the disparate review processes used by other bodies, such as the USPSTF, ACIP, and \nBright Futures. HHS, with input from this committee, may consider other factors including cost \nin its development of coverage decisions.” \n2.  HRSA’s 2011 Guidelines and the Departments’ Second Interim Final Rules \nOn August 1, 2011, HRSA released onto its website its Guidelines for women’s \npreventive services, adopting the recommendations of the IOM.  \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/  The Guidelines included coverage for all FDA-\napproved contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and related patient education and counseling \nfor women with reproductive capacity, as prescribed by a health care provider.  \nIn administering this Mandate, on August 1, 2011, the Departments promulgated interim \nfinal rules amending our 2010 interim final rules. (76 FR 46621) (2011 interim final rules).  The \n2011 interim final rules specify that HRSA has the authority to establish exemptions from the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement for certain group health plans established or maintained by \ncertain religious employers and for health insurance coverage provided in connection with such \n                                                           \n8 The Departments do not relay these dissenting remarks as an endorsement of the remarks, but to describe the \nhistory of the Guidelines, which includes this part of the report that IOM provided to HRSA.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 15 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     14  \n \nplans.9  The 2011 interim final rules defined an exempt “religious employer” narrowly as one \nthat: (1) had the inculcation of religious values as its purpose; (2) primarily employed persons \nwho shared its religious tenets; (3) primarily served persons who shared its religious tenets; and \n(4) was a nonprofit organization, as described in section 6033(a)(1) and (a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the \nCode.  Those relevant sections of the Code include only churches, their integrated auxiliaries, \nconventions or associations of churches, and the exclusively religious activities of a religious \norder.  The practical effect of the rules’ definition of “religious employer” was to create potential \nuncertainty about whether employers, including many of those houses of worship or their \nintegrated auxiliaries, would fail to qualify for the exemption if they engaged in outreach \nactivities toward persons who did not share their religious tenets.10  As the basis for adopting that \nlimited definition of religious employer, the 2011 interim final rules stated that they relied on the \nlaws of some “States that exempt certain religious employers from having to comply with State \nlaw requirements to cover contraceptive services.”  (76 FR 46623).  That same day, HRSA \nexercised the discretion described in the 2011 interim final rules to provide the exemption. \n3.  The Departments’ Subsequent Rulemaking on the Accommodation and Third Interim Final \nRules \nFinal regulations issued on February 10, 2012, adopted the definition of “religious \nemployer” in the 2011 interim final rules without modification (2012 final regulations).11  (77 FR \n8725).  The exemption did not require religious employers to file any certification form or \ncomply with any other information collection process.  \n                                                           \n9 The 2011 amended interim final rules were issued and effective on August 1, 2011, and published in the Federal \nRegister on August 3, 2011. (76 FR 46621). \n10 See, for example, Comments of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on Interim Final Rules on \nPreventive Services, File Code CMS-9992-IFC2 (Aug. 31, 2011). \n11 The 2012 final regulations were published on February 15, 2012 (77 FR 8725). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 16 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     15  \n \nContemporaneous with the issuance of the 2012 final regulations, HHS—with the \nagreement of the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of the Treasury—issued \nguidance establishing a temporary safe harbor from enforcement of the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement by the Departments with respect to group health plans established or maintained by \ncertain nonprofit organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage (and the \ngroup health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans).12  The guidance \nprovided that the temporary safe harbor would remain in effect until the first plan year beginning \non or after August 1, 2013.  The temporary safe harbor did not apply to for-profit entities.  The \nDepartments stated that, during the temporary safe harbor, the Departments would engage in \nrulemaking to achieve “two goals—providing contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing to \nindividuals who want it and accommodating non-exempted, nonprofit organizations’ religious \nobjections to covering contraceptive services.”  (77 FR 8727). \nOn March 21, 2012, the Departments published an advance notice of proposed \nrulemaking (ANPRM) that described possible approaches to achieve those goals with respect to \nreligious nonprofit organizations, and solicited public comments on the same.  (77 FR 16501). \nFollowing review of the comments on the ANPRM, the Departments published proposed \nregulations on February 6, 2013 (2013 NPRM) (78 FR 8456).  \n                                                           \n12 Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers, Group Health Plans, and Group \nHealth Insurance Issuers with Respect to the Requirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing \nUnder section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, Section 715(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act, and Section 9815(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, issued on February 10, 2012, and reissued on \nAugust 15, 2012. Available at: http://www.lb7.uscourts.gov/documents/12cv3932.pdf.  The guidance, as reissued on \nAugust 15, 2012, clarified, among other things, that plans that took some action before February 10, 2012, to try, \nwithout success, to exclude or limit contraceptive coverage were not precluded from eligibility for the safe harbor.  \nThe temporary enforcement safe harbor was also available to insured student health insurance coverage arranged by \nnonprofit institutions of higher education with religious objections to contraceptive coverage that met the conditions \nset forth in the guidance.  See final rule entitled “Student Health Insurance Coverage” published March 21, 2012 (77 \nFR 16457). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 17 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     16  \n \nThe 2013 NPRM proposed to expand the definition of “religious employer” for purposes \nof the religious employer exemption.  Specifically, it proposed to require only that the religious \nemployer be organized and operate as a nonprofit entity and be referred to in section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, eliminating the requirements that a religious employer (1) \nhave the inculcation of religious values as its purpose, (2) primarily employ persons who share \nits religious tenets, and (3) primarily serve persons who share its religious tenets.  \nThe 2013 NPRM also proposed to create a compliance process, which it called an \naccommodation, for group health plans established, maintained, or arranged by certain eligible \nreligious nonprofit organizations that fell outside the houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries \ncovered by section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code (and, thus, outside of the religious \nemployer exemption).  The 2013 NPRM proposed to define such eligible organizations as \nnonprofit entities that hold themselves out as religious, oppose providing coverage for certain \ncontraceptive items on account of religious objections, and maintain a certification to this effect \nin their records.  The 2013 NPRM stated, without citing a supporting source, that employees of \neligible organizations “may be less likely than” employees of exempt houses of worship and \nintegrated auxiliaries to share their employer’s faith and opposition to contraception on religious \ngrounds.  (78 FR 8461).  The 2013 NPRM therefore proposed that, in the case of an insured \ngroup health plan established or maintained by an eligible organization, the health insurance \nissuer providing group health insurance coverage in connection with the plan would provide \ncontraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries without cost sharing, premium, fee, \nor other charge to plan participants or beneficiaries enrolled in the eligible organization’s plan—\n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 18 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     17  \n \nand without any cost to the eligible organization.13  In the case of a self-insured group health plan \nestablished or maintained by an eligible organization, the 2013 NPRM presented potential \napproaches under which the third party administrator of the plan would provide or arrange for \ncontraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries.  \nOn August 15, 2012, the Departments also extended our temporary safe harbor until the \nfirst plan year beginning on or after August 1, 2013. \nThe Departments published final regulations on July 2, 2013 (July 2013 final \nregulations).  (78 FR 39869).  The July 2013 final regulations finalized the expansion of the \nexemption for houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries. Although some commenters \nhad suggested that the exemption be further expanded, the Departments declined to adopt that \napproach.  The July 2013 regulations stated that, because employees of objecting houses of \nworship and integrated auxiliaries are relatively likely to oppose contraception, exempting those \norganizations “does not undermine the governmental interests furthered by the contraceptive \ncoverage requirement.”  (78 FR 39874).  But, like the 2013 NPRM, the July 2013 regulations \nassumed that “[h]ouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive \ncoverage on religious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the \nsame faith who share the same objection” to contraceptives. (Id.) \nThe July 2013 regulations also finalized an accommodation for eligible organizations. \nUnder the accommodation, an eligible organization was required to submit a self-certification to \nits group health insurance issuer or third party administrator, as applicable.  Upon receiving that \nself-certification, the issuer or third party administrator would provide or arrange for payments \nfor the contraceptive services to the plan participants and beneficiaries enrolled in the eligible \n                                                           \n13 The NPRM proposed to treat student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher \neducation in a similar manner. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 19 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     18  \n \norganization’s plan, without requiring any cost sharing on the part of plan participants and \nbeneficiaries and without cost to the eligible organization.  With respect to self-insured plans, the \nthird party administrators (or issuers they contracted with) could receive reimbursements by \nreducing user fee payments (to Federally facilitated Exchanges) by the amounts paid out for \ncontraceptive services under the accommodation, plus an allowance for certain administrative \ncosts, as long as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services requests and an \nauthorizing exception under OMB Circular No. A-25R is in effect.14  With respect to fully \ninsured group health plans, the issuer was expected to bear the cost of such payments,15 and HHS \nintended to clarify in guidance that the issuer could treat those payments as an adjustment to \nclaims costs for purposes of medical loss ratio and risk corridor program calculations. \nWith respect to self-insured group health plans, the July 2013 final regulations specified \nthat the self-certification was an instrument under which the plan was operated and that it \nobligated the third party administrator to provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage by \noperation of section 3(16) of ERISA.  The regulations stated that, by submitting the self-\ncertification form, the eligible organization “complies” with the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement and does not have to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage.  \nSee, for example, Id. at 39874, 39896.  Consistent with these statements, the Departments, \nthrough the Department of Labor, issued a self-certification form, EBSA Form 700.  The form \nstated, in indented text labeled as a “Notice to Third Party Administrators of Self-Insured Health \nPlans,” that “[t]he obligations of the third party administrator are set forth in 26 CFR 54.9815-\n                                                           \n14 See also 45 CFR 156.50. Under the regulations, if the third party administrator does not participate in a Federally \nfacilitated Exchange as an issuer, it is permitted to contract with an insurer which does so participate, in order to \nobtain such reimbursement.  The total contraceptive user fee adjustment for the 2015 benefit year was $33 million. \n15 “[P]roviding payments for contraceptive services is cost neutral for issuers.” (78 FR 39877). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 20 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     19  \n \n2713A, 29 CFR 2510.3-16, and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A” and concluded, in unindented text, \nthat “[t]his form is an instrument under which the plan is operated.”  \nThe Departments extended the temporary safe harbor again on June 20, 2013, to \nencompass plan years beginning on or after August 1, 2013, and before January 1, 2014.  The \nguidance extending the safe harbor included a form to be used by an organization during this \ntemporary period to self-certify that its plan qualified for the temporary safe harbor if no prior \nform had been submitted. \n4.  Litigation Over the Mandate and the Accommodation Process \nDuring the period when the Departments were publishing and modifying our regulations, \norganizations and individuals filed dozens of lawsuits challenging the Mandate.  Plaintiffs \nincluded religious nonprofit organizations, businesses run by religious families, individuals, and \nothers. Religious plaintiffs principally argued that the Mandate violated the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) by forcing them to provide coverage or payments for \nsterilization and contraceptive services, including what they viewed as early abortifacient \nitems, contrary to their religious beliefs.  Based on this claim, in July 2012 a Federal district \ncourt issued a preliminary injunction barring the Departments from enforcing the Mandate \nagainst a family-owned business. Newland v. Sebelius, 881 F. Supp. 2d. 1287 (D. Colo. 2012). \nMultiple other courts proceeded to issue similar injunctions against the Mandate, although a \nminority of courts ruled in the Departments’ favor. Compare Tyndale House Publishers, Inc. v. \nSebelius, 904 F. Supp. 2d 106 (D.D.C. 2012), and The Seneca Hardwood Lumber Company, Inc. \nv. Sebelius (sub nom Geneva Coll. v. Sebelius), 941 F. Supp. 2d 672 (W.D. Pa. 2013), with \nO’Brien v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 894 F. Supp. 2d 1149 (E.D. Mo. 2012). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 21 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     20  \n \nA circuit split swiftly developed in cases filed by religiously motivated for-profit \nbusinesses, to which neither the religious employer exemption nor the eligible organization \naccommodation (as then promulgated) applied.  Several for-profit businesses won rulings against \nthe Mandate before the Unites States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting en banc, \nwhile similar rulings against the Departments were issued by the Seventh and District of \nColumbia (D.C.) Circuits.  Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114 (10th Cir. \n2013); Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654 (7th Cir. 2013); Gilardi v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., 733 F.3d 1208 (D.C. Cir. 2013).  The Third and Sixth Circuits disagreed with similar \nplaintiffs, and in November 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in Hobby Lobby and \nConestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Secretary of U.S. Department of Health & Human \nServices, 724 F.3d 377 (3d Cir. 2013), to resolve the circuit split.   \nOn June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court ruled against the Departments and held that, under \nRFRA, the Mandate could not be applied to the closely held for-profit corporations before the \nCourt because their owners had religious objections to providing such coverage.16  Burwell v. \nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc. 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014).  The Court held that the “contraceptive \nmandate ‘substantially burdens’ the exercise of religion” as applied to employers that object to \nproviding contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, and that the plaintiffs were therefore \nentitled to an exemption unless the Mandate was the least restrictive means of furthering a \ncompelling governmental interest.  Id. at 2775.  The Court observed that, under the compelling \ninterest test of RFRA, the Departments could not rely on interests “couched in very broad terms, \nsuch as promoting ‘public health’ and ‘gender equality,’ but rather, had to demonstrate that a \ncompelling interest was served by refusing an exemption to the “particular claimant[s]” seeking \n                                                           \n16 The Supreme Court did not decide whether RFRA would apply to publicly traded for-profit corporations.  See 134 \nS. Ct. at 2774. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 22 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     21  \n \nan exemption.  Id. at 2779.  Assuming without deciding that a compelling interest existed, the \nCourt held that the Government’s goal of guaranteeing coverage for contraceptive methods \nwithout cost sharing could be achieved in a less restrictive manner.  The Court observed that \n“[t]he most straightforward way of doing this would be for the Government to assume the cost of \nproviding the four contraceptives at issue to any women who are unable to obtain them under \ntheir health-insurance policies due to their employers’ religious objections.”  Id. at 2780.  The \nCourt also observed that the Departments had “not provided any estimate of the average cost per \nemployee of providing access to these contraceptives,” nor “any statistics regarding the number \nof employees who might be affected because they work for corporations like Hobby Lobby, \nConestoga, and Mardel”.  Id. at 2780–81.  But the Court ultimately concluded that it “need not \nrely on the option of a new, government-funded program in order to conclude that the HHS \nregulations fail the least-restrictive means test” because “HHS itself ha[d] demonstrated that it \nha[d] at its disposal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring employers to fund \ncontraceptive methods that violate their religious beliefs.”  Id. at 2781-82.  The Court explained \nthat the “already established” accommodation process available to nonprofit organizations was a \nless-restrictive alternative that “serve[d] HHS’s stated interests equally well,” although the Court \nemphasized that its ruling did not decide whether the accommodation process “complie[d] with \nRFRA for purposes of all religious claims”.  Id. at 2788–82. \nMeanwhile, another plaintiff obtained temporary relief from the Supreme Court in a case  \nchallenging the accommodation under RFRA.  Wheaton College, a Christian liberal arts college \nin Illinois, objected that the accommodation was a compliance process that rendered it complicit \nin delivering payments for abortifacient contraceptive services to its employees.  Wheaton \nCollege refused to execute the EBSA Form 700 required under the July 2013 final regulations.  It \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 23 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     22  \n \nwas denied a preliminary injunction in the Federal district and appellate courts, and sought an \nemergency injunction pending appeal from the Unites States Supreme Court on June 30, 2014. \nOn July 3, 2014, the Supreme Court issued an interim order in favor of the College, stating that, \n“[i]f the [plaintiff] informs the Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that it is a \nnonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to providing \ncoverage for contraceptive services, the [Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nthe Treasury] are enjoined from enforcing [the Mandate] against the [plaintiff] . . .  pending final \ndisposition of appellate review.” Wheaton College v. Burwell. 134 S. Ct. 2806, 2807 (2014).  \nThe order stated that Wheaton College did not need to use EBSA Form 700 or send a copy of the \nexecuted form to its health insurance issuers or third party administrators to meet the condition \nfor injunctive relief.  Id.   \nIn response to this litigation, on August 27, 2014, the Departments simultaneously issued \na third set of interim final rules (August 2014 interim final rules) (79 FR 51092), and a notice of \nproposed rulemaking (August 2014 proposed rules) (79 FR 51118).  The August 2014 interim \nfinal rules changed the accommodation process so that it could be initiated either by self-\ncertification using EBSA Form 700 or through a notice informing the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that an eligible organization had religious objections \nto coverage of all or a subset of contraceptive services.  (79 FR 51092).  In response to Hobby \nLobby, the August 2014 proposed rules extended the accommodation process to closely held for-\nprofit entities with religious objections to contraceptive coverage, by including them in the \ndefinition of eligible organizations.  (79 FR 51118).  Neither the August 2014 interim final rules \nnor the August 2014 proposed rules extended the exemption, and neither added a certification \nrequirement for exempt entities.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 24 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     23  \n \nIn October 2014, based on an interpretation of the Supreme Court’s interim order, HHS \ndeemed Wheaton College as having submitted a sufficient notice to HHS.  HHS conveyed that \ninterpretation to the DOL, so as to trigger the accommodation process. \nOn July 14, 2015, the Departments finalized both the August 2014 interim final rules and \nthe August 2014 proposed rules in a set of final regulations (the July 2015 final regulations) (80 \nFR 41318).  (The July 2015 final regulations also encompassed issues related to other preventive \nservices coverage.)  The preamble to the July 2015 final regulations stated that, through the \naccommodation, payments for contraceptives and sterilization would be provided in a way that is \n“seamless” with the coverage that eligible employers provide to their plan participants and \nbeneficiaries.  Id. at 41328.  The July 2015 final regulations allowed eligible organizations to \nsubmit a notice to HHS as an alternative to submitting the EBSA Form 700, but specified that \nsuch notice must include the eligible organization’s name and an expression of its religious \nobjection, along with the plan name, plan type, and name and contact information for any of the \nplan’s third party administrators or health insurance issuers.  The Departments indicated that \nsuch information represents the minimum information necessary for us to administer the \naccommodation process.  \nWhen an eligible organization maintains an insured group health plan or student health \nplan and provides the alternative notice, the July 2015 final regulations provide that HHS will \ninform the health insurance issuer of its obligations to cover contraceptive services to which the \neligible organization objects.  Where an eligible organization maintains a self-insured plan under \nERISA and provides the alternative notice, the regulations provide that DOL will work with \nHHS to send a separate notification to the self-insured plan’s third party administrator(s).  The \nregulations further provide that such notification is an instrument under which the plan is \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 25 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     24  \n \noperated for the purposes of section 3(16) of ERISA, and the instrument would designate the \nthird party administrator as the entity obligated to provide or arrange for payments for \ncontraceptives to which the eligible organization objects.  The July 2015 final regulations \ncontinue to apply the amended notice requirement to eligible organizations that sponsor church \nplans exempt from ERISA pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of ERISA, but acknowledge that, with \nrespect to the operation of the accommodation process, section 3(16) of ERISA does not provide \na mechanism to impose an obligation to provide contraceptive coverage as a plan administrator \non those eligible organizations’ third party administrators.  (80 FR 41323). \nMeanwhile, a second split among Federal appeals courts had developed involving \nchallenges to the Mandate’s accommodation.  Many religious nonprofit organizations argued that \nthe accommodation impermissibly burdened their religious beliefs because it utilized the plans \nthe organizations themselves sponsored to provide services to which they objected on religious \ngrounds.  They objected to the self-certification requirement on the same basis. Federal district \ncourts split in the cases, granting preliminary injunction motions to religious groups in the \nmajority of cases, but denying them to others.  In most appellate cases, religious nonprofit \norganizations lost their challenges, where the courts often concluded that the accommodation \nimposed no substantial burden on their religious exercise under RFRA.  For example, Priests for \nLife v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 772 F. 3d 229 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Little Sisters of \nthe Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell, 794 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir. 2015); Geneva Coll. v. Sec’y \nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 778 F.3d 422 (3d Cir. 2015).  But the Eighth Circuit \ndisagreed and ruled in favor of religious nonprofit employers. Dordt College v. Burwell, 801 \nF.3d 946, 949–50 (8th Cir. 2015) (relying on Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & \nHuman Servs., 801 F.3d 927 (8th Cir. 2015)).  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 26 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     25  \n \nOn November 6, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in seven similar cases \nunder the title of a filing from the Third Circuit, Zubik v. Burwell.  The Court held oral argument \non March 23, 2016, and, after the argument, asked the parties to submit supplemental briefs \naddressing “whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners’ employees \nthrough petitioners’ insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of \npetitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage \nto their employees”.  In a brief filed with the Supreme Court on April 12, 2016, the Government \nstated on behalf of the Departments that the accommodation process for eligible organizations \nwith insured plans could operate without any self-certification or written notice being submitted \nby eligible organizations.  \nOn May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a per curiam opinion in Zubik, vacating the \njudgments of the Courts of Appeals and remanding the cases “in light of the substantial \nclarification and refinement in the positions of the parties” in their supplemental briefs.  (136 S. \nCt. 1557, 1560 (2016).)  The Court stated that it anticipated that, on remand, the Courts of \nAppeals would “allow the parties sufficient time to resolve any outstanding issues between \nthem.”  Id.  The Court also specified that “the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on \npetitioners for failure to provide the relevant notice” while the cases remained pending. Id. at \n1561.   \nAfter remand, as indicated by the Departments in court filings, some meetings were held \nbetween attorneys for the Government and for the plaintiffs in those cases.  Separately, at various \ntimes after the Supreme Court’s remand order, HHS and DOL sent letters to the issuers and third \nparty administrators of certain plaintiffs in Zubik and other pending cases, directing the issuers \nand third party administrators to provide contraceptive coverage for participants in those \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 27 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     26  \n \nplaintiffs’ group health plans under the accommodation.  The Departments also issued a Request \nfor Information (RFI) on July 26, 2016, seeking public comment on options for modifying the \naccommodation process in light of the supplemental briefing in Zubik and the Supreme Court’s \nremand order.  (81 FR 47741).  Public comments were submitted in response to the RFI, during a \ncomment period that closed on September 20, 2016.  \nOn December 20, 2016, HRSA updated the Guidelines via its website, \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines2016/index.html.  HRSA announced that, for plans \nsubject to the Guidelines, the updated Guidelines would apply to the first plan year beginning \nafter December 20, 2017.  Among other changes, the updated Guidelines specified that the \nrequired contraceptive coverage includes follow-up care (for example, management and \nevaluation, as well as changes to, and removal or discontinuation of, the contraceptive method).  \nThey also specified that coverage should include instruction in fertility awareness-based methods \nfor women desiring an alternative method of family planning.  HRSA stated that, with the input \nof a committee operating under a cooperative agreement, HRSA would review and periodically \nupdate the Women’s Preventive Services’ Guidelines.  The updated Guidelines did not alter the \nreligious employer exemption or accommodation process. \nOn January 9, 2017, the Departments issued a document entitled, “FAQs About \nAffordable Care Act Implementation Part 36” (FAQ).17  The FAQ stated that, after reviewing \ncomments submitted in response to the 2016 RFI and considering various options, the \nDepartments could not find a way at that time to amend the accommodation so as to satisfy \n                                                           \n17 Available at: https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-\n36.pdf and https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/Downloads/ACA-FAQs-Part36_1-9-17-\nFinal.pdf. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 28 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     27  \n \nobjecting eligible organizations while pursuing the Departments’ policy goals.  Thus, the \nlitigation on remand from the Supreme Court remains unresolved. \nA separate category of unresolved litigation involved religious employees as plaintiffs. \nFor example, in two cases, the plaintiff-employees work for a nonprofit organization that agrees \nwith the employees (on moral grounds) in opposing coverage of certain contraceptives they \nbelieve to be abortifacient, and that is willing to offer them insurance coverage that omits such \nservices.  See March for Life v. Burwell, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116 (D.D.C. 2015); Real Alternatives, \n150 F. Supp. 3d 419, affirmed by 867 F.3d 338 (3d Cir. 2017).  In another case, the plaintiff-\nemployees work for a State government entity that the employees claim is willing, under State \nlaw, to provide a plan omitting contraception consistent with the employees’ religious beliefs. \nSee Wieland v. HHS, 196 F. Supp. 3d 1010 (E.D. Mo. 2016).  Those and similar employee-\nplaintiffs generally contend that the Mandate violates their rights under RFRA by making it \nimpossible for them to obtain health insurance consistent with their religious beliefs, either from \ntheir willing employer or in the individual market, because the Departments offer no exemptions \nencompassing either circumstance. Such challenges have seen mixed success.  Compare, for \nexample, Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1020 (concluding that the Mandate violates the employee \nplaintiffs’ rights under RFRA and permanently enjoining the Departments) and March for Life, \n128 F. Supp. 3d at 133–34 (same), with Real Alternatives, 2017 WL 3324690 at *18 (affirming \ndismissal of employee plaintiffs’ RFRA claim).   \nOn May 4, 2017, the President issued an “Executive Order Promoting Free Speech and \nReligious Liberty.” Regarding “Conscience Protections with Respect to Preventive-Care \nMandate,” that order instructs “[t]he Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services [to] consider issuing amended regulations, consistent \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 29 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     28  \n \nwith applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate \npromulgated under section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.” \nII.  RFRA and Government Interests Underlying the Mandate \nRFRA provides that the Government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise \nof religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability” unless the Government \n“demonstrates that application of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling \ngovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest.”  42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1(a) and (b).  In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court \nhad “little trouble concluding” that, in the absence of an accommodation or exemption, “the HHS \ncontraceptive mandate ‘substantially burden[s]’ the exercise of religion. 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1(a).” \n134 S. Ct. at 2775.  And although the Supreme Court did not resolve the RFRA claims presented \nin Zubik on their merits, it instructed the parties to consider alternative accommodations for the \nobjecting plaintiffs, after the Government suggested that such alternatives might be possible.   \nDespite multiple rounds of rulemaking, however, the Departments have not assuaged the \nsincere religious objections to contraceptive coverage of numerous organizations, nor have we \nresolved the pending litigation.  To the contrary, the Departments have been litigating RFRA \nchallenges to the Mandate and related regulations for more than 5 years, and dozens of those \nchallenges remain pending today.  That litigation, and the related modifications to the \naccommodation, have consumed substantial governmental resources while creating uncertainty \nfor objecting organizations, issuers, third party administrators, employees, and beneficiaries. \nConsistent with the President’s Executive Order and the Government’s desire to resolve the \npending litigation and prevent future litigation from similar plaintiffs, the Departments have \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 30 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     29  \n \nconcluded that it is appropriate to reexamine the exemption and accommodation scheme \ncurrently in place for the Mandate. \nThese interim final rules (and the companion interim final rules published elsewhere in \nthis Federal Register) are the result of that reexamination.  The Departments acknowledge that \ncoverage of contraception is an important and highly sensitive issue, implicating many different \nviews, as reflected in the comments received on multiple rulemakings over the course of \nimplementation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act.  After reconsidering the interests served \nby the Mandate in this particular context, the objections raised, and the applicable Federal law, \nthe Departments have determined that an expanded exemption, rather than the existing \naccommodation, is the most appropriate administrative response to the religious objections raised \nby certain entities and organizations concerning the Mandate.  The Departments have \naccordingly decided to revise the regulations channeling HRSA authority under section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS to provide an exemption from the Mandate to a broader range of entities \nand individuals that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, while continuing to \noffer the existing accommodation as an optional alternative.  The Departments have also decided \nto create a process by which a willing employer and issuer may allow an objecting individual \nemployee to obtain health coverage without contraceptive coverage.  These interim final rules \nleave unchanged HRSA’s authority to decide whether to include contraceptives in the women’s \npreventive services Guidelines for entities that are not exempted by law, regulation, or the \nGuidelines.  These rules also do not change the many other mechanisms by which the \nGovernment advances contraceptive coverage, particularly for low-income women. \nIn addition to relying on the text of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act and the \nDepartments’ discretion to promulgate rules to carry out the provisions of the PHS Act, the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 31 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     30  \n \nDepartments also draw on Congress’ decision in the Affordable Care Act neither to specify that \ncontraception must be covered nor to require inflexible across-the-board application of section \n2713 of the PHS Act.  The Departments further consider Congress’ extensive history of \nprotecting religious objections when certain matters in health care are specifically regulated—\noften specifically with respect to contraception, sterilization, abortion, and activities connected to \nabortion.  \nNotable among the many statutes (listed in footnote 1 in Section I-Background) that \ninclude protections for religious beliefs are, not only the Church Amendments, but also \nprotections for health plans or health care organizations in Medicaid or Medicare Advantage to \nobject “on moral or religious grounds” to providing coverage of certain counseling or referral \nservices.  (42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B); 42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(b)(3)).  In addition, Congress has \nprotected individuals who object to prescribing or providing contraceptives contrary to their \nreligious beliefs.  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Division C, Title VII, Sec. 726(c) \n(Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act), Pub. L. No. 115-31 (May 5, \n2017).  Congress likewise provided that, if the District of Columbia requires “the provision of \ncontraceptive coverage by health insurance plans,” “it is the intent of Congress that any \nlegislation enacted on such issue should include a ‘conscience clause’ which provides exceptions \nfor religious beliefs and moral convictions”.  Id.  at Division C, Title VIII, Sec. 808.  In light of \nthe fact that Congress did not require HRSA to include contraception in Guidelines issued under \nsection 2713 of the PHS Act, we consider it significant, in support of the implementation of \nthose Guidelines by the expanded exemption in these interim final rules, that Congress’ most \nrecent statement on the prospect of Government mandated contraceptive coverage was to express \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 32 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     31  \n \nthe specific intent that a conscience clause be provided and that it should protect religious \nbeliefs. \nThe Departments’ authority to guide HRSA’s discretion in determining the scope of any \ncontraceptive coverage requirement under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act includes the \nauthority to provide exemptions and independently justifies this rulemaking.  The Departments \nhave also determined that requiring certain objecting entities or individuals to choose between \nthe Mandate, the accommodation, or penalties for noncompliance violates their rights under \nRFRA. \nA.  Elements of RFRA \n1.  Substantial Burden  \nThe Departments believe that agencies charged with administering a statute or associated \nregulations or guidance that imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion under RFRA \nhave discretion in determining how to avoid the imposition of such burden.  The Departments \nhave previously contended that the Mandate does not impose a substantial burden on entities and \nindividuals.  With respect to the coverage Mandate itself, apart from the accommodation, and as \napplied to entities with religious objections, our argument was rejected in Hobby Lobby, which \nheld that the Mandate imposes a substantial burden.  (134 S. Ct. at 2775–79.)  With respect to \nwhether the Mandate imposes a substantial burden on entities that may choose the \naccommodation, but must choose between the accommodation, the Mandate, or penalties for \nnoncompliance, a majority of Federal appeals courts have held that the accommodation does not \nimpose a substantial burden on such entities (mostly religious nonprofit entities).  \nThe Departments have reevaluated our position on this question, however, in light of all \nthe arguments made in various cases, public comments that have been submitted, and the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 33 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     32  \n \nconcerns discussed throughout these rules.  We have concluded that requiring certain objecting \nentities or individuals to choose between the Mandate, the accommodation, or penalties for \nnoncompliance imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise under RFRA.  We believe that \nthe Court’s analysis in Hobby Lobby extends, for the purposes of analyzing a substantial burden, \nto the burdens that an entity faces when it religiously opposes participating in the \naccommodation process or the straightforward Mandate, and is subject to penalties or \ndisadvantages that apply in this context if it chooses neither.  As the Eighth Circuit stated in \nSharpe Holdings, “[i]n light of [nonprofit religious organizations’] sincerely held religious \nbeliefs, we conclude that compelling their participation in the accommodation process by threat \nof severe monetary penalty is a substantial burden on their exercise of religion….  That they \nthemselves do not have to arrange or pay for objectionable contraceptive coverage is not \ndeterminative of whether the required or forbidden act is or is not religiously offensive”.  (801 \nF.3d at 942.)  \nOur reconsideration of these issues has also led us to conclude, consistent with the rulings \nin favor of religious employee plaintiffs in Wieland and March for Life cited above, that the \nMandate imposes a substantial burden on the religious beliefs of individual employees who \noppose contraceptive coverage and would be able to obtain a plan that omits contraception from \na willing employer or issuer (as applicable), but cannot obtain one solely because of the \nMandate’s prohibition on that employer and/or issuer providing them with such a plan.  \nConsistent with our conclusion earlier this year after the remand of cases in Zubik and \nour reviewing of comments submitted in response to the 2016 RFI, the Departments believe \nthere is not a way to satisfy all religious objections by amending the accommodation. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 34 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     33  \n \nAccordingly, the Departments have decided it is necessary and appropriate to provide the \nexpanded exemptions set forth herein. \n2.  Compelling Interest  \nAlthough the Departments previously took the position that the application of the \nMandate to certain objecting employers was necessary to serve a compelling governmental \ninterest, the Departments have now concluded, after reassessing the relevant interests and for the \nreasons stated below, that it does not.  Under such circumstances, the Departments are required \nby law to alleviate the substantial burden created by the Mandate. Here, informed by the \nDepartments’ reassessment of the relevant interests, as well as by our desire to bring to a close \nthe more than 5 years of litigation over RFRA challenges to the Mandate, the Departments have \ndetermined that the appropriate administrative response is to create a broader exemption, rather \nthan simply adjusting the accommodation process. \nRFRA requires the Government to respect religious beliefs under “the most demanding \ntest known to constitutional law”: where the Government imposes a substantial burden on \nreligious exercise, it must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and show that the law \nor requirement is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. City of Boerne v. Flores, \n521 U.S. 507, 534 (1997).  For an interest to be compelling, its rank must be of the “highest \norder”.  Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993); \nsee also Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 406–09 (1963); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, \n221–29 (1972).  In applying RFRA, the Supreme Court has “looked beyond broadly formulated \ninterests justifying the general applicability of government mandates and scrutinized the asserted \nharm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.” Gonzales v. O Centro \nEspirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 431 (2006).  To justify a substantial \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 35 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     34  \n \nburden on religious exercise under RFRA, the Government must show it has a compelling \ninterest in applying the requirement to the “particular claimant[s] whose sincere exercise of \nreligion is being substantially burdened.”  Id. at 430–31.  Moreover, the Government must meet \nthe “exceptionally demanding” least-restrictive-means standard.  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at \n2780.  Under that standard, the Government must establish that “it lacks other means of \nachieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by \nthe objecting parties.”  Id. \nUpon further examination of the relevant provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the \nadministrative record on which the Mandate was based, the Departments have concluded that the \napplication of the Mandate to entities with sincerely held religious objections to it does not serve \na compelling governmental interest.  The Departments have reached that conclusion for multiple \nreasons, no one of which is dispositive. \nFirst, Congress did not mandate that contraception be covered at all under the Affordable \nCare Act.  Instead, Congress merely provided for coverage of “such additional preventive care \nand screenings” for women “provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by [HRSA].” \nCongress, thus, left the identification of any additional required preventive services for women to \nadministrative discretion.  The fact that Congress granted the Departments the authority to \npromulgate all rules appropriate and necessary for the administration of the relevant provisions \nof the Code, ERISA, and the PHS Act, including by channeling the discretion Congress afforded \nto HRSA to decide whether to require contraceptive coverage, indicates that the Departments’ \njudgment should carry particular weight in considering the relative importance of the \nGovernment’s interest in applying the Mandate to the narrow population of entities exempted in \nthese rules.    \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 36 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     35  \n \nSecond, while Congress specified that many health insurance requirements added by the \nAffordable Care Act—including provisions adjacent to section 2713 of the PHS Act—were so \nimportant that they needed to be applied to all health plans immediately, the preventive services \nrequirement in section 2713 of the PHS Act was not made applicable to “grandfathered plans.” \nThat feature of the Affordable Care Act is significant: as cited above, seven years after the \nAffordable Care Act’s enactment, approximately 25.5 million people are estimated to be enrolled \nin grandfathered plans not subject to section 2713 of the PHS Act.  We do not suggest that a \nrequirement that is inapplicable to grandfathered plans or otherwise subject to exceptions could \nnever qualify as a serving a compelling interest under RFRA.  For example, “[e]ven a \ncompelling interest may be outweighed in some circumstances by another even weightier \nconsideration.”  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780.  But Congress’ decision not to apply section \n2713 of the PHS Act to grandfathered plans, while deeming other requirements closely \nassociated in the same statute as sufficiently important to impose immediately, is relevant to our \nassessment of the importance of the Government interests served by the Mandate.  As the \nDepartments observed in 2010, those immediately applicable requirements were “particularly \nsignificant.” (75 FR 34540).  Congress’ decision to leave section 2713 out of that category \ninforms the Departments’ assessment of the weight of the Government’s interest in applying the \nGuidelines issued pursuant to section 2713 of the PHS Act to religious objectors. \nThird, various entities that brought legal challenges to the Mandate (including some of \nthe largest employers) have been willing to provide coverage of some, though not all, \ncontraceptives.  For example, the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby were willing to provide coverage \nwith no cost sharing of 14 of 18 FDA-approved women’s contraceptive and sterilization \nmethods.  (134 S. Ct. at 2766.)  With respect to organizations and entities holding those beliefs, \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 37 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     36  \n \nthe fact that they are willing to provide coverage for various contraceptive methods significantly \ndetracts from the government interest in requiring that they provide coverage for other \ncontraceptive methods to which they object. \nFourth, the case for a compelling interest is undermined by the existing accommodation \nprocess, and how it applies to certain similarly situated entities based on whether or not they \nparticipate in certain self-insured group health plans, known as church plans, under applicable \nlaw.  The Departments previously exempted eligible organizations from the contraceptive \ncoverage requirement, and created an accommodation under which those organizations bore no \nobligation to provide for such coverage after submitting a self-certification or notice.  Where a \nnon-exempt religious organization uses an insured group health plan instead of a self-insured \nchurch plan, the health insurance issuer would be obliged to provide contraceptive coverage or \npayments to the plan’s participants under the accommodation.  Even in a self-insured church \nplan context, the preventive services requirement in section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act applies to \nthe plan, and through the Code, to the religious organization that sponsors the plan.  But under \nthe accommodation, once a self-insured church plan files a self-certification or notice, the \naccommodation relieves it of any further obligation with respect to contraceptive services \ncoverage.  Having done so, the accommodation process would normally transfer the obligation to \nprovide or arrange for contraceptive coverage to a self-insured plan’s third party administrator \n(TPA).  But the Departments lack authority to compel church plan TPAs to provide \ncontraceptive coverage or levy fines against those TPAs for failing to provide it.  This is because \nchurch plans are exempt from ERISA pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of ERISA.  Section 2761(a) of \nthe PHS Act provides that States may enforce the provisions of title XXVII of the PHS Act as \nthey pertain to issuers, but not as they pertain to church plans that do not provide coverage \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 38 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     37  \n \nthrough a policy issued by a health insurance issuer.  The combined result of PHS Act section \n2713’s authority to remove contraceptive coverage obligations from self-insured church plans, \nand HHS’s and DOL’s lack of authority under the PHS Act or ERISA to require TPAs to \nbecome administrators of those plans to provide such coverage, has led to significant incongruity \nin the requirement to provide contraceptive coverage among nonprofit organizations with \nreligious objections to the coverage.  \nMore specifically, issuers and third party administrators for some, but not all, religious \nnonprofit organizations are subject to enforcement for failure to provide contraceptive coverage \nunder the accommodation, depending on whether they participate in a self-insured church plan. \nNotably, many of those nonprofit organizations are not houses of worship or integrated \nauxiliaries.  Under section 3(33)(C)(iv) of ERISA, many organizations in self-insured church \nplans need not be churches, but can merely “share[] common religious bonds and convictions \nwith [a] church or convention or association of churches”.  The effect is that many similar \nreligious organizations are being treated very differently with respect to their employees \nreceiving contraceptive coverage—depending on whether the organization is part of a church \nplan—even though the Departments claimed a compelling interest to deny exemptions to all such \norganizations. In this context, the fact that the Mandate and the Departments’ application thereof \n“leaves appreciable damage to [their] supposedly vital interest unprohibited” is strong evidence \nthat the Mandate “cannot be regarded as protecting an interest ‘of the highest order.” Lukumi, \n508 U.S. at 520 (citation and quotation marks omitted).   \nFifth, the Departments’ previous assertion that the exemption for houses of worship was \noffered to respect a certain sphere of church autonomy (80 FR 41325) does not adequately \nexplain some of the disparate results of the existing rules.  And the desire to respect church \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 39 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     38  \n \nautonomy is not grounds to prevent the Departments from expanding the exemption to other \nreligious entities.  The Departments previously treated religious organizations that operate in a \nsimilar fashion very differently for the purposes of the Mandate.  For example, the Departments \nexempted houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries that may conduct activities, such as the \noperating of schools, that are also conducted by non-exempt religious nonprofit organizations. \nLikewise, among religious nonprofit groups that were not exempt as houses of worship or \nintegrated auxiliaries, many operate their religious activities similarly even if they differ in \nwhether they participate in self-insured church plans.  As another example, two religious \ncolleges might have the same level of religiosity and commitment to defined ideals, but one \nmight identify with a specific large denomination and choose to be in a self-insured church plan \noffered by that denomination, while another might not be so associated or might not have as \nready access to a church plan and so might offer its employees a fully insured health plan. Under \nthe accommodation, employees of the college using a fully insured plan (or a self-insured plan \nthat is not a church plan) would receive coverage of contraceptive services without cost sharing, \nwhile employees of the college participating in the self-insured church plan would not receive \nthe coverage where that plan required its third party administrator to not offer the coverage. \nAs the Supreme Court recently confirmed, a self-insured church plan exempt from \nERISA through ERISA 3(33) can include a plan that is not actually established or maintained by \na church or by a convention or association of churches, but is maintained by “an organization … \nthe principal purpose or function of which is the administration or funding of a plan or program \nfor the provision of retirement benefits or welfare benefits, or both, for the employees of a \nchurch or a convention or association of churches, if such organization is controlled by or \nassociated with a church or a convention or association of churches” (a so-called  “principal-\n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 40 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     39  \n \npurpose organization”).  See Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton, 137 S. Ct. 1652, 1656-\n57 (U.S. June 5, 2017); ERISA 3(33)(C).  While the Departments take no view on the status of \nthese particular plans, the Departments acknowledge that the church plan exemption not only \nincludes some non-houses-of-worship as organizations whose employees can be covered by the \nplan, but also, in certain circumstances, may include plans that are not themselves established \nand maintained by houses of worship.  Yet, such entities and plans—if they file a self-\ncertification or notice through the existing accommodation—are relieved of obligations under the \ncontraceptive Mandate and their third party administrators are not subject to a requirement that \nthey provide contraceptive coverage to their plan participants and beneficiaries.  \nAfter considering the differential treatment of various religious nonprofit organizations \nunder the previous accommodation, the Departments conclude that it is appropriate to expand the \nexemption to other religious nonprofit organizations with sincerely held religious beliefs \nopposed to contraceptive coverage.  We also conclude that it is not appropriate to limit the scope \nof a religious exemption by relying upon a small minority of State laws that contain narrow \nexemptions that focus on houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries.  (76 FR 46623.) \nSixth, the Government’s interest in ensuring contraceptive coverage for employees of \nparticular objecting employers is undermined by the characteristics of many of those employers, \nespecially nonprofit employers.  The plaintiffs challenging the existing accommodation include, \namong other organizations, religious colleges and universities, and religious orders that provide \nhealth care or other charitable services.  Based in part on our experience litigating against such \norganizations, the Departments now disagree with our previous assertion that “[h]ouses of \nworship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive coverage on religious \ngrounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 41 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     40  \n \nsame objection.”18 (78 FR 39874.)  Although empirical data was not required to reach our \nprevious conclusion, we note that the conclusion was not supported by any specific data or other \nsource, but instead was intended to be a reasonable assumption.  Nevertheless, in the litigation \nand in numerous public comments submitted throughout the regulatory processes described \nabove, many religious nonprofit organizations have indicated that they possess deep religious \ncommitments even if they are not houses of worship or their integrated auxiliaries.  Some of the \nreligious nonprofit groups challenging the accommodation claim that their employees are \nrequired to adhere to a statement of faith which includes the entities’ views on certain \ncontraceptive items.19  The Departments recognize, of course, that not all of the plaintiffs \nchallenging the accommodation require all of their employees (or covered students) to share their \nreligious objections to contraceptives.  At the same time, it has become apparent from public \ncomments and from court filings in dozens of cases—encompassing hundreds of organizations—\nthat many religious nonprofit organizations express their beliefs publicly and hold themselves \nout as organizations for whom their religious beliefs are vitally important.  Employees of such \norganizations, even if not required to sign a statement of faith, often have access to, and \nknowledge of, the views of their employers on contraceptive coverage, whether through the \norganization’s published mission statement or statement of beliefs, through employee benefits \ndisclosures and other communications with employees and prospective employees, or through \npublicly filed lawsuits objecting to providing such coverage and attendant media coverage. In \n                                                           \n18 In changing its position, an agency “need not demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new \npolicy are better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that \nthere are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change of course \nadequately indicates.” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  \n19 See, for example, Geneva College v. Sebelius, 929 F. Supp. 2d 402, 411 (W.D. Pa. 2013); Grace Schools v. \nSebelius, 988 F. Supp. 2d 935, 943 (N.D. Ind. 2013); Comments of the Council for Christian Colleges & \nUniversities, re: CMS-9968-P (filed Apr. 8, 2013) (“On behalf of [] 172 higher education institutions…a \nrequirement for membership in the CCCU is that full-time administrators and faculty at our institutions share the \nChristian faith of the institution.”).  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 42 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     41  \n \nmany cases, the employees of religious organizations will have chosen to work for those \norganizations with an understanding—explicit or implicit—that they were being employed to \nadvance the organization’s goals and to be respectful of the organization’s beliefs even if they do \nnot share all of those beliefs. Religious nonprofit organizations that engage in expressive activity \ngenerally have a First Amendment right of expressive association and religious free exercise to \nchoose to hire persons (or, in the case of students, to admit them) based on whether they share, or \nat least will be respectful of, their beliefs.20  \nGiven the sincerely held religious beliefs of many religious organizations, imposing the \ncontraceptive-coverage requirement on those that object based on such beliefs might undermine \nthe Government’s broader interests in ensuring health coverage by causing the entities to stop \nproviding health coverage.  For example, because the Affordable Care Act does not require \ninstitutions of higher education to arrange student coverage, some institutions of higher \neducation that object to the Mandate appear to have chosen to stop arranging student plans rather \nthan comply with the Mandate or be subject to the accommodation with respect to such \npopulations.21 \nSeventh, we now believe the administrative record on which the Mandate rests is \ninsufficient to meet the high threshold to establish a compelling governmental interest in \nensuring that women covered by plans of objecting organizations receive cost-free contraceptive \ncoverage through those plans.  To begin, in support of the IOM’s recommendations, which \nHRSA adopted, the IOM identified several studies showing a preventive services gap because \n                                                           \n20 Notably, “the First Amendment simply does not require that every member of a group agree on every issue in \norder for the group’s policy to be ‘expressive association.’” Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 655 \n(2000). \n21 See, for example, Manya Brachear Pashman, “Wheaton College ends coverage amid fight against birth control mandate,” Chicago Tribune \n(July 29, 2015); Laura Bassett, “Franciscan University Drops Entire Student Health Insurance Plan Over Birth Control Mandate,” HuffPost (May \n15, 2012). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 43 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     42  \n \nwomen require more preventive care than men.  (IOM 2011 at 19–21).  Those studies did not \nidentify contraceptives or sterilization as composing a specific portion of that gap, and the IOM \ndid not consider or establish in the report whether any cost associated with that gap remains after \nall other women’s preventive services are covered without cost-sharing.  Id.  Even without \nknowing what the empirical data would show about that gap, the coverage of the other women’s \npreventive services required under both the HRSA Guidelines and throughout section 2713(a) of \nthe PHS Act—including annual well-woman visits and a variety of tests, screenings, and \ncounseling services—serves at a minimum to diminish the cost gap identified by IOM for \nwomen whose employers decline to cover some or all contraceptives on religious grounds.22  \nMoreover, there are multiple Federal, State, and local programs that provide free or \nsubsidized contraceptives for low-income women.  Such Federal programs include, among \nothers, Medicaid (with a 90 percent Federal match for family planning services), Title X, \ncommunity health center grants, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.  According to \nthe Guttmacher Institute, government-subsidized family planning services are provided at 8,409 \nhealth centers overall.23  The Title X program, for example, administered by the HHS Office of \nPopulation Affairs (OPA), provides a wide variety of voluntary family planning information and \nservices for clients based on their ability to pay, through a network that includes nearly 4,000 \nfamily planning centers. http://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/  Individuals with \nfamily incomes at or below the HHS poverty guideline (for 2017, $24,600 for a family of four in \nthe 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia) receive services at no charge unless a \nthird party (governmental or private) is authorized or obligated to pay for these services. \n                                                           \n22 The Departments are not aware of any objectors to the contraceptive Mandate that are unwilling to cover any of \nthe other preventive services without cost sharing as required by PHS Act section 2713. \n23 “Facts on Publicly Funded Contraceptive Services in the United States,” March 2016. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 44 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     43  \n \nIndividuals with incomes in excess of 100 percent up to 250 percent of the poverty guideline are \ncharged for services using a sliding fee scale based on family size and income. Unemancipated \nminors seeking confidential services are assessed fees based on their own income level rather \nthan their family’s income.  The availability of such programs to serve the most at-risk women \n(as defined in the IOM report) diminishes the Government’s interest in applying the Mandate to \nobjecting employers. Many forms of contraception are available for around $50 per month, \nincluding long-acting methods such as the birth control shot and intrauterine devices (IUDs).24 \nOther, more permanent forms of contraception like implantables bear a higher one-time cost, but \nwhen calculated over the duration of use, cost a similar amount.25  Various State programs \nsupplement the Federal programs referenced above, and 28 States have their own mandates of \ncontraceptive coverage as a matter of State law.  This existing inter-governmental structure for \nobtaining contraceptives significantly diminishes the Government’s interest in applying the \nMandate to employers over their sincerely held religious objections. \nThe record also does not reflect that the Mandate is tailored to the women most likely to \nexperience unintended pregnancy, identified by the 2011 IOM report as “women who are aged \n18 to 24 years and unmarried, who have a low income, who are not high school graduates, and \nwho are members of a racial or ethnic minority”.  (IOM 2011 at 102).  For example, with respect \nto religiously objecting organizations, the Mandate applies in employer-based group health plans \nand student insurance at private colleges and universities.  It is not clear that applying the \nMandate among those objecting entities is a narrowly tailored way to benefit the most at-risk \n                                                           \n24 See, for example, Caroline Cunningham, “How Much Will Your Birth Control Cost Once the Affordable Care \nAct Is Repealed?” Washingtonian (Jan. 17, 2017), available at https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/01/17/how-\nmuch-will-your-birth-control-cost-once-the-affordable-care-act-is-repealed/; also, see \nhttps://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control. \n25 Id. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 45 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     44  \n \npopulation.  The entities appear to encompass some such women, but also appear to omit many \nof them and to include a significantly larger cross-section of women as employees or plan \nparticipants.  At the same time, the Mandate as applied to objecting employers appears to \nencompass a relatively small percentage of the number of women impacted by the Mandate \noverall, since most employers do not appear to have conscientious objections to the Mandate.26 \nThe Guttmacher Institute, on which the IOM relied, further reported that 89 percent of women \nwho are at risk of unintended pregnancy and are living at 0 through 149 percent of the poverty \nline are already using contraceptives, as are 92 percent of those with incomes of 300 percent or \nmore of the Federal poverty level.27  \nThe rates of—and reasons for—unintended pregnancy are notoriously difficult to \nmeasure.28  In particular, association and causality can be hard to disentangle, and the studies \nreferred to by the 2011 IOM Report speak more to association than causality.  For example, IOM \n2011 references Boonstra, et al. (2006), as finding that, “as the rate of contraceptive use by \nunmarried women increased in the United States between 1982 and 2002, rates of unintended \n                                                           \n26 Prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act approximately 6 percent of employer survey respondents \ndid not offer contraceptive coverage, with 31 percent of respondents not knowing whether they offered such \ncoverage Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits, 2010 \nAnnual Survey” at 196, available at https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/8085.pdf. It is not \nclear whether the minority of employers who did not cover contraception refrained from doing so for conscientious \nreasons or for other reasons. Estimates of the number of women who might be impacted by the exemptions offered \nin these rules, as compared to the total number of women who will likely continue to receive contraceptive \ncoverage, is discussed in more detail below. \n27 “Contraceptive Use in the United States,” September 2016. \n28 The IOM 2011 Report reflected this when it cited the IOM’s own 1995 report on unintended pregnancy, “The \nBest Intentions” (IOM 1995). IOM 1995 identifies various methodological difficulties in demonstrating the interest \nin reducing unintended pregnancies by means of a coverage mandate in employer plans. These include:  the \nambiguity of intent as an evidence-based measure (does it refer to mistimed pregnancy or unwanted pregnancy, and \ndo studies make that distinction?); “the problem of determining parental attitudes at conception” and inaccurate \nmethods often used for that assessment, such as “to use the request for an abortion as a marker”; and the overarching \nproblem of “association versus causality,” that is, whether intent causes certain negative outcomes or is merely \ncorrelated with them. IOM 1995 at 64–66. See also IOM 1995 at 222 (“the largest public sector funding efforts, \nTitle X and Medicaid, have not been well evaluated in terms of their net effectiveness, including their precise impact \non unintended pregnancy”). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 46 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     45  \n \npregnancy and abortion for unmarried women also declined,”29 and Santelli and Melnikas as \nfinding that “increased rates of contraceptive use by adolescents from the early 1990s to the early \n2000s was associated with a decline in teen pregnancies and that periodic increases in the teen \npregnancy rate are associated with lower rates of contraceptive use”.  IOM 2011 at 105.30  In this \nrespect, the report does not show that access to contraception causes decreased incidents of \nunintended pregnancy, because both of the assertions rely on association rather than causation, \nand they associate reduction in unintended pregnancy with increased use of contraception, not \nmerely with increased access to such contraceptives.   \nSimilarly, in a study involving over 8,000 women between 2012 and 2015, conducted to \ndetermine whether contraceptive coverage under the Mandate changed contraceptive use \npatterns, the Guttmacher Institute concluded that “[w]e observed no changes in contraceptive use \npatterns among sexually active women.”31  With respect to teens, the Santelli and Melnikas study \ncited by IOM 2011 observes that, between 1960 and 1990, as contraceptive use increased, teen \nsexual activity outside of marriage likewise increased (although the study does not assert a causal \nrelationship).32  Another study, which proposed an economic model for the decision to engage in \nsexual activity, stated that “[p]rograms that increase access to contraception are found to \ndecrease teen pregnancies in the short run but increase teen pregnancies in the long run.”33 \nRegarding emergency contraception in particular, “[i]ncreased access to emergency \n                                                           \n29 H.

Id. at 57–58.  The WPSI report \nrelied on a 2015 report of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation \n(ASPE), “The Affordable Care Act Is Improving Access to Preventive Services for Millions of \nAmericans,” which estimated that persons who have private insurance coverage of preventive \nservices without cost sharing includes 55.6 million women.45  \nAs discussed above and based on the Departments’ knowledge of litigation challenging \nthe Mandate, during the time ASPE estimated the scope of preventive services coverage (2011–\n2013), houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries were exempt from the Mandate, other \nobjecting religious nonprofit organizations were protected by the temporary safe harbor, and \nhundreds of accommodated self-insured church plan entities were not subject to enforcement of \nthe Mandate through their third party administrators.  In addition, dozens of for-profit entities \nthat had filed lawsuits challenging the Mandate were protected by court orders pending the \nSupreme Court’s resolution of Hobby Lobby in June 2014.  It would therefore appear that the \nbenefits recorded by the report occurred even though most objecting entities were not in \ncompliance.46  Additional data indicates that, in 28 States where contraceptive coverage \n                                                           \n45 Available at https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/affordable-care-act-improving-access-preventive-services-millions-\namericans; also, see Abridged Report, available at https://www.womenspreventivehealth.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/01/WPSI_2016AbridgedReport.pdf. \n46 In addition, as in IOM 2011, the WPSI report bases its evidentiary conclusions relating to contraceptive coverage, \nuse, unintended pregnancy, and health benefits, on conclusions that the phenomena are “associated” with the \nintended outcomes, without showing there is a causal relationship.  For example, the WPSI report states that \n“[c]ontraceptive counseling in primary care may increase the uptake of hormonal methods and [long-acting \nreversible contraceptives], although data on structured counseling in specialized reproductive health settings \ndemonstrated no such effect.” Id. at 63.  The WPSI report also acknowledges that a large-scale study evaluating the \neffects of providing no-cost contraception had “no randomization or control group.” Id. at 63. \nThe WPSI report also identifies the at-risk population as young, low-income, and/or minority women: “[u]nintended \npregnancies disproportionately occur in women age 18 to 24 years, especially among those with low incomes or \nfrom racial/ethnic minorities.” Id. at 58.  The WPSI report acknowledges that many in this population are already \nserved by Title X programs, which provide family planning services to “approximately 1 million teens each year.” \nId. at 58.  The WPSI report observes that between 2008 and 2011—before the contraceptive coverage requirement \n \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 51 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     50  \n \nmandates have been imposed statewide, those mandates have not necessarily lowered rates of \nunintended pregnancy (or abortion) overall.47  \nThe Departments need not take a position on these empirical questions.  Our review is \nsufficient to lead us to conclude that significantly more uncertainty and ambiguity exists in the \nrecord than the Departments previously acknowledged when we declined to extend the \nexemption to certain objecting organizations and individuals as set forth herein, and that no \ncompelling interest exists to counsel against us extending the exemption.   \nDuring public comment periods, some commenters noted that some drugs included in the \npreventive services contraceptive Mandate can also be useful for treating certain existing health \nconditions.  The IOM similarly stated that “the non-contraceptive benefits of hormonal \ncontraception include treatment of menstrual disorders, acne or hirsutism, and pelvic pain.” IOM \n2011 at 107.  Consequently, some commenters suggested that religious objections to the \nMandate should not be permitted in cases where such methods are used to treat such conditions, \neven if those methods can also be used for contraceptive purposes.  Section 2713(a)(4) of the \nPHS Act does not, however, apply to non-preventive care provided solely for treatment of an \nexisting condition.  It applies only to “such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as \nprovided for” by HRSA (Section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act).  HRSA’s Guidelines implementing \nthis section state repeatedly that they apply to “preventive” services or care, and with respect to \nthe coverage of contraception specifically, they declare that the methods covered are \n“contraceptive” methods as a “Type of Preventive Service,” and that they are to be covered only \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nwas implemented—unintended pregnancy decreased to the lowest rate in 30 years. Id. at 58.  The WPSI report does \nnot address how to balance contraceptive coverage interests with religious objections, nor does it specify the extent \nto which applying the Mandate among commercially insured at objecting entities serves to deliver contraceptive \ncoverage to women most at risk of unintended pregnancy.  \n47 See Michael J. New, “Analyzing the Impact of State Level Contraception Mandates on Public Health Outcomes,” \n13 Ave Maria L. Rev. 345 (2015), available at http://avemarialaw-law-\nreview.avemarialaw.edu/Content/articles/vXIII.i2.new.final.0809.pdf. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 52 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     51  \n \n“[a]s prescribed” by a physician or other health care provider. \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/  The contraceptive coverage requirement in the \nGuidelines also only applies for “women with reproductive capacity.” \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/;  (80 FR 40318).  Therefore, the Guidelines’ inclusion \nof contraceptive services requires coverage of contraceptive methods as a type of preventive \nservice only when a drug that the FDA has approved for contraceptive use is prescribed in whole \nor in part for such use.  The Guidelines and section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act do not require \ncoverage of such drugs where they are prescribed exclusively for a non-contraceptive and non-\npreventive use to treat an existing condition.48  As discussed above, the last Administration \ndecided to exempt houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries from the Mandate, and to \nrelieve hundreds of religious nonprofit organizations of their obligations under the Mandate and \nnot further require contraceptive coverage to their employees.  In several of the lawsuits \nchallenging the Mandate, some religious plaintiffs stated that they do not object and are willing \nto cover drugs prescribed for the treatment of an existing condition and not for contraceptive \npurposes—even if those drugs are also approved by the FDA for contraceptive uses.  Therefore, \nthe Departments conclude that the fact that some drugs that are approved for preventive \n                                                           \n48 The Departments previously cited the IOM’s listing of existing conditions that contraceptive drugs can be used to \ntreat (menstrual disorders, acne, and pelvic pain), and said of those uses that “there are demonstrated preventive \nhealth benefits from contraceptives relating to conditions other than pregnancy.” 77 FR 8727 & n.7.  This was not, \nhowever, an assertion that PHS Act section 2713(a)(4) or the Guidelines require coverage of “contraceptive” \nmethods when prescribed for an exclusively non-contraceptive, non-preventive use.  Instead it was an observation \nthat such drugs—generally referred to as “contraceptives”—also have some alternate beneficial uses to treat existing \nconditions.  For the purposes of these interim final rules, the Departments clarify here that our previous reference to \nthe benefits of using contraceptive drugs exclusively for some non-contraceptive and non-preventive uses to treat \nexisting conditions did not mean that the Guidelines require coverage of such uses, and consequently is not a reason \nto refrain from offering the expanded exemptions provided here.  Where a drug approved by the FDA for \ncontraceptive use is prescribed for both a contraceptive use and a non-contraceptive use, the Guidelines (to the \nextent they apply) would require its coverage.  Where a drug approved by the FDA for contraceptive use is \nprescribed exclusively for a non-contraceptive and non-preventive use to treat an existing condition, it would be \noutside the scope of the Guidelines. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 53 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     52  \n \ncontraceptive purposes can also be used for exclusively non-preventive purposes to treat existing \nconditions is not a sufficient reason to refrain from expanding the exemption to the Mandate. \nAn additional consideration supporting the Departments’ present view is that alternative \napproaches can further the interests the Departments previously identified behind the Mandate. \nAs noted above, the Government already engages in dozens of programs that subsidize \ncontraception for the low-income women identified by the IOM as the most at risk for \nunintended pregnancy.  The Departments have also acknowledged in legal briefing that \ncontraception access can be provided through means other than coverage offered by religious \nobjectors, for example, through “a family member’s employer,” “an Exchange,” or “another \ngovernment program.”49  \nMany employer plan sponsors, institutions of education arranging student health \ncoverage, and individuals enrolled in plans where their employers or issuers (as applicable) are \nwilling to offer them a religiously acceptable plan, hold sincerely held religious beliefs against \n(respectively) providing, arranging, or participating in plans that comply with the Mandate either \nby providing contraceptive coverage or by using the accommodation.  Because we have \nconcluded that requiring such compliance through the Mandate or accommodation has \nconstituted a substantial burden on the religious exercise of many such entities or individuals, \nand because we conclude requiring such compliance did not serve a compelling interest and was \nnot the least restrictive means of serving a compelling interest, we now believe that requiring \nsuch compliance led to the violation of RFRA in many instances.  We recognize that this is a \nchange of position on this issue, and we make that change based on all the matters discussed in \nthis preamble. \n                                                           \n49 Brief for the Respondents at 65, Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016) (No. 14-1418).   \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 54 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     53  \n \nB.  Discretion to Provide Religious Exemptions \nEven if RFRA does not compel the religious exemptions provided in these interim final \nrules, the Departments believe they are the most appropriate administrative response to the \nreligious objections that have been raised.  RFRA identifies certain circumstance under which \ngovernment must accommodate religious exercise-when a government action imposes a \nsubstantial burden on the religious exercise of an adherent and imposition of that burden is not \nthe least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest.  RFRA does not, \nhowever, prescribe the accommodation that the government must adopt.  Rather, agencies have \ndiscretion to fashion an appropriate and administrable response to respect religious liberty \ninterests implicated by their own regulations.  We know from Hobby Lobby that, in the absence \nof any accommodation, the contraceptive-coverage requirement imposes a substantial burden on \ncertain objecting employers.  We know from other lawsuits and public comments that many \nreligious entities have objections to complying with the accommodation based on their sincerely \nheld religious beliefs.  Previously, the Departments attempted to develop an accommodation that \nwould either alleviate the substantial burden imposed on religious exercise or satisfy RFRA's \nrequirements for imposing that burden.  \nNow, however, the Departments have reassessed the relevant interests and determined \nthat, even if exemptions are not required by RFRA, they would exercise their discretion to \naddress the substantial burden identified in Hobby Lobby by expanding the exemptions from the \nMandate instead of revising accommodations previously offered.  In the Departments’ view, a \nbroader exemption is a more direct, effective means of satisfying all bona fide religious \nobjectors.  This view is informed by the fact that the Departments’ previous attempt to develop \nan appropriate accommodation did not satisfy all objectors.  That previous accommodation \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 55 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     54  \n \nconsumed Departmental resources not only through the regulatory process, but in persistent \nlitigation and negotiations.  Offering exemptions as described in these interim final rules is a \nmore workable way to respond to the substantial burden identified in Hobby Lobby and bring \nyears of litigation concerning the Mandate to a close. \nC.  General Scope of Expanded Religious Exemptions \n1.  Exemption and Accommodation for Religious Employers, Plan Sponsors, and Institutions of  \nHigher Education \nFor all of these reasons, and as further explained below, the Departments now believe it \nis appropriate to modify the scope of the discretion afforded to HRSA in the July 2015 final \nregulations to direct HRSA to provide the expanded exemptions and change the accommodation \nto an optional process if HRSA continues to otherwise provide for contraceptive coverage in the \nGuidelines.  As set forth below, the expanded exemption encompasses non-governmental plan \nsponsors that object based on sincerely held religious beliefs, and institutions of higher education \nin their arrangement of student health  plans.  The accommodation is also maintained as an \noptional process for exempt employers, and will provide contraceptive availability for persons \ncovered by the plans of entities that use it (a legitimate program purpose). \nThe Departments believe this approach is sufficiently respectful of religious objections \nwhile still allowing the Government to advance other interests.  Even with the expanded \nexemption, HRSA maintains the discretion to require contraceptive coverage for nearly all \nentities to which the Mandate previously applied (since most plan sponsors do not appear to \npossess the requisite religious objections), and to reconsider those interests in the future where \nno covered objection exists.  Other Government subsidies of contraception are likewise not \naffected by this rule.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 56 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     55  \n \n2.  Exemption for Objecting Individuals Covered by Willing Employers and Issuers \nAs noted above, some individuals have brought suit objecting to being covered under an \ninsurance policy that includes coverage for contraceptives.  See, for example, Wieland v. HHS, \n196 F.  Supp. 3d 1010 (E.D. Mo. 2016); Soda v. McGettigan, No. 15-cv-00898 (D. Md.).  Just as \nthe Departments have determined that the Government does not have a compelling interest in \napplying the Mandate to employers that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, \nwe have also concluded that the Government does not have a compelling interest in requiring \nindividuals to be covered by policies that include contraceptive coverage when the individuals \nhave sincerely held religious objections to that coverage.  The Government does not have an \ninterest in ensuring the provision of contraceptive coverage to individuals who do not wish to \nhave such coverage.  Especially relevant to this conclusion is the fact that the Departments have \ndescribed their interests of health and gender equality as being advanced among women who \n“want” the coverage so as to prevent “unintended” pregnancy.  (77 FR 8727).50  No asserted \ninterest is served by denying an exemption to individuals who object to it.  No unintended \npregnancies will be avoided or costs reduced by imposing the coverage on those individuals.  \nAlthough the Departments previously took the position that allowing individual religious \nexemptions would undermine the workability of the insurance system, the Departments now \nagree with those district courts that have concluded that an exemption that allows—but does not \nrequire—issuers and employers to omit contraceptives from coverage provided to objecting \nindividuals does not undermine any compelling interest.  See Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1019–\n20; March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 132.  The individual exemption will only apply where the \n                                                           \n50 In this respect, the Government’s interest in contraceptive coverage is different than its interest in persons \nreceiving some other kinds of health coverage or coverage in general, which can lead to important benefits that are \nnot necessarily conditional on the recipient’s desire to use the coverage and the specific benefits that may result \nfrom their choice to use it. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 57 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     56  \n \nemployer and issuer (or, in the individual market, the issuer) are willing to offer a policy \naccommodating the objecting individual.  As a result, the Departments consider it likely that \nwhere an individual exemption is invoked, it will impose no burdens on the insurance market \nbecause such burdens may be factored into the willingness of an employer or issuer to offer such \ncoverage.  At the level of plan offerings, the extent to which plans cover contraception under the \nprior rules is already far from uniform.  Congress did not require compliance with section 2713 \nof the PHS Act by all entities—in particular by grandfathered plans.  The Departments’ previous \nexemption for houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries, and our lack of authority to enforce \nthe accommodation with respect to self-insured church plans, show that the importance of a \nuniform health insurance system is not significantly harmed by allowing plans to omit \ncontraception in many contexts.51  Furthermore, granting exemptions to individuals who do not \nwish to receive contraceptive coverage where the plan and, as applicable, issuer and plan sponsor \nare willing, does not undermine the Government’s interest in ensuring the provision of such \ncoverage to other individuals who wish to receive it.  Nor do such exemptions undermine the \noperation of the many other programs subsidizing contraception.  Rather, such exemptions serve \nthe Government’s interest in accommodating religious exercise.  Accordingly, as further \nexplained below, the Departments have provided an exemption to address the concerns of \nobjecting individuals.  \n                                                           \n51 Also, see Real Alternatives, 2017 WL 3324690 at *36 (3d Cir. Aug. 4, 2017) (Jordan, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part) (“Because insurance companies would offer such plans as a result of market forces, doing so \nwould not undermine the government's interest in a sustainable and functioning market.…  Because the government \nhas failed to demonstrate why allowing such a system (not unlike the one that allowed wider choice before the \nAffordable Care Act) would be unworkable, it has not satisfied strict scrutiny.” (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 58 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     57  \n \nD.  Effects on Third Parties of Exemptions \nThe Departments note that the exemptions created here, like the exemptions created by \nthe last Administration, do not burden third parties to a degree that counsels against providing \nthe exemptions.  Congress did not create a right to receive contraceptive coverage, and Congress \nexplicitly chose not to impose the section 2713 of the PHS Act requirements on grandfathered \nplans that cover millions of people.  Individuals who are unable to obtain contraceptive coverage \nthrough their employer-sponsored health plans because of the exemptions created in these \ninterim final rules, or because of other exemptions to the Mandate, have other avenues for \nobtaining contraception, including the various governmental programs discussed above.  As the \nGovernment is under no constitutional obligation to fund contraception, cf. Harris v. McRae, 448 \nUnited States 297 (1980), even more so may the Government refrain from requiring private \ncitizens to cover contraception for other citizens in violation of their religious beliefs.  Cf. Rust \nv. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 192–93 (1991) (“A refusal to fund protected activity, without more, \ncannot be equated with the imposition of a ‘penalty’ on that activity.”).52  \nThat conclusion is consistent with the Supreme Court’s observation that RFRA may \nrequire exemptions even from laws requiring claimants “to confer benefits on third parties.” \nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781 n.37.  The burdens imposed on such third parties may be \nrelevant to the RFRA analysis, but they cannot be dispositive. “Otherwise, for example, the \nGovernment could decide that all supermarkets must sell alcohol for the convenience of \ncustomers (and thereby exclude Muslims with religious objections from owning supermarkets), \nor it could decide that all restaurants must remain open on Saturdays to give employees an \n                                                           \n52 Cf. also Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Am. Ass’n of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 257 P.3d 181, \n196 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011) (“a woman’s right to an abortion or to contraception does not compel a private person or \nentity to facilitate either.”). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 59 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     58  \n \nopportunity to earn tips (and thereby exclude Jews with religious objections from owning \nrestaurants).” Id.  Where, as here, contraceptives are readily accessible and, for many low \nincome persons, are available at reduced cost or for free through various governmental programs, \nand contraceptive coverage may be available through State sources or family plans obtained \nthrough non-objecting employers, the Departments have determined that the expanded \nexemptions rather than accommodations are the appropriate response to the substantial burden \nthat the Mandate has placed upon the religious exercise of many religious employers. \nIII.  Provisions of the Interim Final Rules With Comment Period \nThe Departments are issuing these interim final rules in light of the full history of \nrelevant rulemaking (including prior interim final rules), public comments, and litigation \nthroughout the Federal court system.  The interim final rules seek to resolve this matter and the \nlong-running litigation with respect to religious objections by extending the exemption under the \nHRSA Guidelines to encompass entities, and individuals, with sincerely held religious beliefs \nobjecting to contraceptive or sterilization coverage, and by making the accommodation process \noptional for eligible organizations.  \nThe Departments acknowledge that the foregoing analysis represents a change from the \npolicies and interpretations we previously adopted with respect to the Mandate and the \ngovernmental interests that underlie the Mandate.  These changes in policy are within the \nDepartments’ authority.  As the Supreme Court has acknowledged, “[a]gencies are free to \nchange their existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.” \nEncino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2016).  This “reasoned analysis” \nrequirement does not demand that an agency “demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the \nreasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 60 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     59  \n \npolicy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency \nbelieves it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates”.  United \nStudent Aid Funds, Inc. v. King, 200 F. Supp. 3d 163, 169–70 (D.D.C. 2016) (citing FCC v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)); also, see New Edge Network, Inc. v. FCC, \n461 F.3d 1105, 1112–13 (9th Cir. 2006) (rejecting an argument that “an agency changing its \ncourse by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that \nwhich may be required when an agency does not act in the first instance”).   \nHere, for all of the reasons discussed above, the Departments have determined that the \nGovernment’s interest in the application of contraceptive coverage requirements in this specific \ncontext to the plans of certain entities and individuals does not outweigh the sincerely held \nreligious objections of those entities and individuals based on the analyses set forth above.  Thus, \nthese interim final rules amend the Departments’ July 2015 final regulations to expand the \nexemption to include additional entities and persons that object based on sincerely held religious \nbeliefs.  These rules leave in place HRSA’s discretion to continue to require contraceptive and \nsterilization coverage where no such objection exists, and to the extent that section 2713 of the \nPHS Act applies.  These interim final rules also maintain the existence of an accommodation \nprocess, but consistent with our expansion of the exemption, we make the process optional for \neligible organizations.  HRSA is simultaneously updating its Guidelines to reflect the \nrequirements of these interim final rules.53 \nA.  Regulatory Restatements of section 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PHS Act \nThese interim final rules modify the restatements of the requirements of section 2713(a) \nand (a)(4) of the PHS Act, contained in 26 CFR 54.9815-2713(a)(1) introductory text and \n                                                           \n53 See https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ and https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines2016/index.html . \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 61 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     60  \n \n(a)(1)(iv), 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1) introductory text and (a)(1)(iv), and 45 CFR \n147.130(a)(1) introductory text and (a)(1)(iv), so that they conform to the statutory text of \nsection 2713 of the PHS Act.   \nB.  Prefatory Language of the Exemption in 45 CFR 147.132 \nThese interim final rules move the religious exemption from 45 CFR 147.131 to a new § \n147.132 and expand it as follows.  In the prefatory language of § 147.132, these interim final \nrules specify that not only are certain entities “exempt,” but the Guidelines shall not support or \nprovide for an imposition of the contraceptive coverage requirement to such entities.  This is an \nacknowledgement that section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act requires women’s preventive services \ncoverage only “as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration.”  To the extent the HRSA Guidelines do not provide for or support \nthe application of such coverage to exempt entities, the Affordable Care Act does not require the \ncoverage.  Section 147.132 not only describes the exemption of certain entities and plans, but \ndoes so by specifying that the HRSA Guidelines do not provide for, or support the application of, \nsuch coverage to exempt entities and plans. \nC.  General Scope of Exemption for Objecting Entities   \nIn the new 45 CFR 147.132 as created by these interim final rules, these rules expand the \nexemption that was previously located in § 147.131(a).  With respect to employers that sponsor \ngroup health plans, the new language of § 147.132(a)(1) introductory text and (a)(1)(i) provides \nexemptions for employers that object to coverage of all or a subset of contraceptives or \nsterilization and related patient education and counseling based on sincerely held religious \nbeliefs.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 62 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     61  \n \nFor avoidance of doubt, the Departments wish to make clear that the expanded exemption \ncreated in § 147.132(a) applies to several distinct entities involved in the provision of coverage \nto the objecting employer’s employees.  This explanation is consistent with how prior rules have \nworked by means of similar language.  Section 147.132(a)(1) introductory text and (a)(1)(i), by \nspecifying that “[a] group health plan and health insurance coverage provided in connection with \na group health plan” is exempt “to the extent the plan sponsor objects as specified in paragraph \n(a)(2),” exempt the group health plans the sponsors of which object, and exempt their health \ninsurance issuers from providing the coverage in those plans (whether or not the issuers have \ntheir own objections).  Consequently, with respect to Guidelines issued under § \n147.130(a)(1)(iv), or the parallel provisions in 26 CFR 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) and 29 CFR \n2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), the plan sponsor, issuer, and plan covered in the exemption of that \nparagraph would face no penalty as a result of omitting contraceptive coverage from the benefits \nof the plan participants and beneficiaries.  \nConsistent with the restated exemption, exempt entities will not be required to comply \nwith a self-certification process.  Although exempt entities do not need to file notices or \ncertifications of their exemption, and these interim final rules do not impose any new notice \nrequirements on them, existing ERISA rules governing group health plans require that, with \nrespect to plans subject to ERISA, a plan document must include a comprehensive summary of \nthe benefits covered by the plan and a statement of the conditions for eligibility to receive \nbenefits.  Under ERISA, the plan document provides what benefits are provided to participants \nand beneficiaries under the plan and, therefore, if an objecting employer would like to exclude \nall or a subset of contraceptive services, it must ensure that the exclusion is clear in the plan \ndocument.  Moreover, if there is a reduction in a covered service or benefit, the plan has to \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 63 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     62  \n \ndisclose that change to plan participants.54  Thus, where an exemption applies and all or a subset \nof contraceptive services are omitted from a plan’s coverage, otherwise applicable ERISA \ndisclosures must reflect the omission of coverage in ERISA plans.  These existing disclosure \nrequirements serve to help provide notice to participants and beneficiaries of what ERISA plans \ndo and do not cover.  The Departments invite public comment on whether exempt entities, or \nothers, would find value either in being able to maintain or submit a specific form of certification \nto claim their exemption, or in otherwise receiving guidance on a way to document their \nexemption. \nThe exemptions in § 147.132(a) apply “to the extent” of the objecting entities’ sincerely \nheld religious beliefs.  Thus, entities that hold a requisite objection to covering some, but not all, \ncontraceptive items would be exempt with respect to the items to which they object, but not with \nrespect to the items to which they do not object.  Likewise, the requisite objection of a plan \nsponsor or institution of higher education in § 147.132(a)(1)(i) and (ii) exempts its group health \nplan, health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer in connection with such \nplan, and its issuer in its offering of such coverage, but that exemption does not extend to \ncoverage provided by that issuer to other group health plans where the plan sponsor has no \nqualifying objection.  The objection of a health insurance issuer in § 147.132(a)(1)(iii) similarly \noperates only to the extent of its objection, and as otherwise limited as described below. \nD.  Exemption of Employers and Institutions of Higher Education \nThe scope of the exemption is expanded for non-governmental plan sponsors and certain \nentities that arrange health coverage under these interim final rules.  The Departments have \n                                                           \n54 See, for example, 29 U.S.C. 1022, 1024(b), 29 CFR 2520.102-2, 2520.102-3, & 2520.104b-3(d), and 29 CFR \n2590.715-2715.  Also, see 45 CFR 147.200 (requiring disclosure of the “exceptions, reductions, and limitations of \nthe coverage,” including group health plans and group & individual issuers). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 64 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     63  \n \nconsistently taken the position that section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act grants HRSA authority to \nissue Guidelines that provide for and support exemptions from a contraceptive coverage \nrequirement.  Since the beginning of rulemaking concerning the Mandate, HRSA and the \nDepartments have repeatedly exercised their discretion to create and modify various exemptions \nwithin the Guidelines.55  \nThe Departments believe the approach of these interim final rules better aligns our \nimplementation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act with Congress’ intent in the Affordable \nCare Act and throughout other Federal health care laws.  As discussed above, many Federal \nhealth care laws and regulations provide exemptions for objections based on religious beliefs, \nand RFRA applies to the Affordable Care Act.  Expanding the exemption removes religious \nobstacles that entities and certain individuals may face when they otherwise wish to participate in \nthe health care market.  This advances the Affordable Care Acts goal of expanding health \ncoverage among entities and individuals that might otherwise be reluctant to participate.  These \nrules also leave in place many Federal programs that subsidize contraceptives for women who \nare most at risk of unintended pregnancy and who may have more limited access to \ncontraceptives.56  These interim final rules achieve greater uniformity and simplicity in the \nregulation of health insurance by expanding the exemptions to include entities that object to the \nMandate based on their sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n                                                           \n55 “The fact that the agency has adopted different definitions in different contexts adds force to the argument that the \ndefinition itself is flexible, particularly since Congress has never indicated any disapproval of a flexible reading of \nthe statute.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 863–64 (1984). \n56 See, for example, Family Planning grants in 42 U.S.C. 300, et seq.; the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Program, \nPublic Law 112-74 (125 Stat 786, 1080); the Healthy Start Program, 42 U.S.C. 254c-8; the Maternal, Infant, and \nEarly Childhood Home Visiting Program, 42 U.S.C. 711; Maternal and Child Health Block Grants, 42 U.S.C. 703; \n42 U.S.C. 247b-12; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq.; the Indian Health Service, 25 \nU.S.C. 13, 42 U.S.C. 2001(a), & 25 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.; Health center grants, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), (g), (h), & (i); the \nNIH Clinical Center, 42 U.S.C. 248; and the Personal Responsibility Education Program, 42 U.S.C. 713.   \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 65 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     64  \n \nThe Departments further conclude that it would be inadequate to merely attempt to \namend the accommodation process instead of expand the exemption.  The Departments have \nstated in our regulations and court briefings that the existing accommodation with respect to self-\ninsured plans requires contraceptive coverage as part of the same plan as the coverage provided \nby the employer, and operates in a way “seamless” to those plans.  As a result, in significant \nrespects, the accommodation process does not actually accommodate the objections of many \nentities.  The Departments have engaged in an effort to attempt to identify an accommodation \nthat would eliminate the plaintiffs’ religious objections, including seeking public comment \nthrough an RFI, but we stated in January 2017 that we were unable to develop such an approach \nat that time.  \n1.  Plan Sponsors Generally \nThe expanded exemptions in these interim final rules cover any kind of non-\ngovernmental employer plan sponsor with the requisite objections but, for the sake of clarity, \nthey include an illustrative, non-exhaustive list of employers whose objections qualify the plans \nthey sponsor for an exemption.  \nUnder these interim final rules, the Departments do not limit the Guidelines exemption \nwith reference to nonprofit status or to sections 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, as previous \nrules have done.  A significant majority of States either impose no contraceptive coverage \nrequirement or offer broader exemptions than the exemption contained in the July 2015 final \nregulations.57  Although the practice of States is by no means a limit on the discretion delegated \nto HRSA by the Affordable Care Act, nor a statement about what the Federal Government may \ndo consistent with RFRA or other limitations in federal law, such State practice can be \n                                                           \n57 See Guttmacher Institute, “Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives” available at https://www.guttmacher.org/state-\npolicy/explore/insurance-coverage-contraceptives. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 66 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     65  \n \ninformative as to the viability of broad protections for religious liberty.  In this case, such \npractice supports the Departments’ decision to expand the federal exemption, bringing the \nFederal Government’s practice into greater alignment with the practices of the majority of the \nStates. \n2.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A) \nDespite not limiting the exemption to certain organizations referred to in section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, the exemption in these rules includes such organizations. \nSection 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A) specifies, as under the prior exemption, that the exemption covers “a \ngroup health plan established or maintained by ... [a] church, the integrated auxiliary of a church, \na convention or association of churches, or a religious order.”  In the preamble to rules setting \nforth the prior exemption at §147.132(a), the Departments interpreted this same language used in \nthose rules by declaring that “[t]he final regulations continue to provide that the availability of \nthe exemption or accommodation be determined on an employer by employer basis, which the \nDepartments continue to believe best balances the interests of religious employers and eligible \norganizations and those of employees and their dependents.”  (78 FR 39886).  Therefore, under \nthe prior exemption, if an employer participated in a house of worship’s plan—perhaps because \nit was affiliated with a house of worship—but was not an integrated auxiliary or a house of \nworship itself, that employer was not considered to be covered by the exemption, even though it \nwas, in the ordinary meaning of the text of the prior regulation, participating in a “plan \nestablished or maintained by a [house of worship].”  \nUnder these interim final rules, however, the Departments intend that, when this \nregulation text exempts a plan “established or maintained by” a house of worship or integrated \nauxiliary, such exemption will no longer “be determined on an employer by employer basis,” but \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 67 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     66  \n \nwill be determined on a plan basis—that is, by whether the plan is a “plan established or \nmaintained by” a house of worship or integrated auxiliary.  This interpretation better conforms to \nthe text of the regulation setting forth the exemption—in both the prior regulation and in the text \nset forth in these interim final rules.  It also offers appropriate respect to houses of worship and \ntheir integrated auxiliaries not only in their internal employment practices but in their choice of \norganizational form and/or in their activity of establishing or maintaining health plans for \nemployees of associated employers that do not meet the threshold of being integrated auxiliaries.  \nMoreover, under this interpretation, houses of worship would not be faced with the potential \nprospect of services to which they have a religious objection being covered for employees of an \nassociated employer participating in a plan they have established and maintain.  \nThe Departments do not believe there is a sufficient factual basis to exclude from this \npart of the exemption entities that are so closely associated with a house of worship or integrated \nauxiliary that they are permitted participation in its health plan, but are not themselves integrated \nauxiliaries.  Additionally, this interpretation is not inconsistent with the operation of the \naccommodation under the prior rule, to the extent that, in practice and as discussed elsewhere \nherein, it does not force contraceptive coverage to be provided on behalf of the plan participants \nof many religious organizations in a self-insured church plan exempt from ERISA—which are \nexempt in part because the plans are established and maintained by a church.  (Section 3(33)(A) \nof ERISA)  In several lawsuits challenging the Mandate, the Departments took the position that \nsome plans established and maintained by houses of worship, but that included entities that were \nnot integrated auxiliaries, were church plans under section 3(33) of ERISA and, thus, the \nGovernment “has no authority to require the plaintiffs’ TPAs to provide contraceptive coverage \nat this time.” Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 68 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     67  \n \n(E.D.N.Y. 2013).  Therefore the Departments believe it is most appropriate to use a plan basis, \nnot an employer by employer basis, to determine the scope of an exemption for a group health \nplan established or maintained by a house of worship or integrated auxiliary. \n3.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(B) \nSection 147.132(a)(1)(i)(B) of the rules specifies that the exemption includes the plans of \nplan sponsors that are nonprofit organizations.  \n4.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(C) \nUnder § 147.132(a)(1)(i)(C), the rules extend the exemption to the plans of closely held \nfor-profit entities.  This is consistent with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Hobby Lobby, which \ndeclared that a corporate entity is capable of possessing and pursuing non-pecuniary goals (in \nHobby Lobby, religion), regardless of whether the entity operates as a nonprofit organization, \nand rejecting the Departments’ argument to the contrary.  (134 S. Ct. 2768–75)  Some reports \nand industry experts have indicated that not many for-profit entities beyond those that had \noriginally brought suit have sought relief from the Mandate after Hobby Lobby.58  \n5.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(D) \nUnder § 147.132(a)(1)(i)(D), the rules extend the exemption to the plans of for-profit \nentities that are not closely held.  The July 2015 final regulations extended the accommodation to \nfor-profit entities only if they are closely held, by positively defining what constitutes a closely \nheld entity.  The Departments implicitly recognized the difficulty of providing an affirmative \ndefinition of closely held entities in the July 2015 final regulations when we adopted a definition \nthat included entities that are merely “substantially similar” to certain specified parameters, and \nwe allowed entities that were not sure if they met the definition to inquire with HHS;  HHS was \n                                                           \n58 See Jennifer Haberkorn, “Two years later, few Hobby Lobby copycats emerge,” Politico (Oct. 11, 2016), \navailable at http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obamacare-birth-control-mandate-employers-229627. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 69 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     68  \n \npermitted to decline to answer the inquiry, at which time the entity would be deemed to qualify \nas an eligible organization.  The exemptions in these interim final rules do not need to address \nthis difficulty because they include both for-profit entities that are closely held and for-profit \nentities that are not closely held.59  The mechanisms for determining whether a company has \nadopted and holds such principles or views is a matter of well-established State law with respect \nto corporate decision-making,60 and the Departments expect that application of such laws would \ncabin the scope of this exemption.  \nIn including entities in the exemption that are not closely held, these interim final rules \nprovide for the possibility that some publicly traded entities may use the exemption.  Even \nthough the Supreme Court did not extend its holding in Hobby Lobby to publicly traded \ncorporations (the matter could be resolved without deciding that question), the Court did instruct \nthat RFRA applies to corporations because they are “persons” as that term is defined in 1 U.S.C. \n1.  Given that the definition under 1 U.S.C. 1 applies to any corporation, the Departments \nconsider it appropriate to extend the exemption set forth in these interim final rules to for-profit \ncorporations whether or not they are closely held.  The Departments are generally aware that in a \ncountry as large as America comprised of a supermajority of religious persons, some publicly \ntraded entities might claim a religious character for their company, or that the majority of shares \n(or voting shares) of some publicly traded companies might be controlled by a small group of \n                                                           \n59 In the companion interim final rules published elsewhere in this Federal Register, the Departments provide an \nexemption on an interim final basis to closely held entities by using a negative definition: entities that do not have \npublicly traded ownership interests as defined by certain securities required to be registered under section 12 of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934.  Although this is a more workable definition than set forth in our previous rules, \nwe have determined that it is appropriate to offer the expanded religious exemptions to certain entities whether or \nnot they have publicly traded ownership interests. \n60 Although the Departments do not prescribe any form or notification, they would expect that such principles or \nviews would have been adopted and documented in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction under which they \nare incorporated or organized. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 70 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     69  \n \nreligiously devout persons so as to set forth such a religious character.61  The fact that such a \ncompany is religious does not mean that it will have an objection to contraceptive coverage, and \nthere are many fewer publicly traded companies than there are closely held ones.  But our \nexperience with closely held companies is that some, albeit a small minority, do have religious \nobjections to contraceptive coverage.  Thus we consider it possible, though very unlikely, that a \nreligious publicly traded company might have objections to contraceptive coverage.  At the same \ntime, we are not aware of any publicly traded entities that challenged the Mandate specifically \neither publicly or in court.  The Departments agree with the Supreme Court that it is improbable \nthat many publicly traded companies with numerous “unrelated shareholders—including \ninstitutional investors with their own set of stakeholders—would agree to run a corporation \nunder the same religious beliefs” and thereby qualify for the exemption.  (134 S. Ct. at 2774) \n6.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(E) \nUnder § 147.132(a)(1)(i)(E), the rules extend the exemption to the plans of any other \nnon-governmental employer.  The plans of governmental employers are not covered by the plan \nsponsor exemption of § 147.132(a)(1)(i).  The Departments are not aware of reasons why it \nwould be appropriate or necessary to offer religious exemptions to governmental employer plan \nsponsors in the United States with respect to the contraceptive Mandate.  But, as discussed \nbelow, governmental employers are permitted to respect an individual’s objection under § \n147.132(b) and thus to provide health insurance coverage without the objected-to contraceptive \ncoverage to such individual.  Where that exemption is operative, the Guidelines may not be \nconstrued to prevent a willing governmental plan sponsor of a group health plan from offering a \n                                                           \n61 See, e.g., Nasdaq.com, “4 Publicly Traded Religious Companies if You’re Looking to Invest in Faith” (Feb. 7, \n2014), available at http://www.nasdaq.com/article/4-publicly-traded-religious-companies-if-youre-looking-to-invest-\nin-faith-cm324665. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 71 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     70  \n \nseparate benefit package option, or a separate policy, certificate or contract of insurance, to any \nindividual who objects to coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services based on \nsincerely held religious beliefs. \nBy the general extension of the exemption to the plans of plan sponsors in  \n§ 147.132(a)(1)(i), these interim final rules also exempt group health plans sponsored by an \nentity other than an employer (for example, a union) that objects based on sincerely held \nreligious beliefs to coverage of contraceptives or sterilization.  \n7.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(ii) \nAs in the previous rules, the plans of institutions of higher education that arrange student \nhealth insurance coverage will continue to be treated similarly to the way in which the plans of \nemployers are treated, but for the purposes of such plans being exempt or electing the optional \naccommodation, rather than merely being eligible for the accommodation as in the previous rule.  \nThese interim final rules specify, in § 147.132(a)(1)(ii), that the exemption is extended, in the \ncase of institutions of higher education (as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1002), to their arrangement of \nstudent health insurance coverage, in a manner comparable to the applicability of the exemption \nfor group health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan established \nor maintained by a plan sponsor.  As mentioned above, because the Affordable Care Act does not \nrequire institutions of higher education to arrange student coverage, some institutions of higher \neducation that object to the Mandate appear to have chosen to stop arranging student plans rather \nthan comply with the Mandate or use the accommodation.  Extending the exemption in these \ninterim final rules may remove an obstacle to such entities deciding to offer student plans, \nthereby giving students another health insurance option. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 72 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     71  \n \nE.  Exemption for Issuers \nThese interim final rules extend the exemption, in § 147.132(a)(1)(iii), to health \ninsurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage that sincerely hold their \nown religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services.  \nThe Departments are not currently aware of health insurance issuers that possess their \nown religious objections to offering contraceptive coverage.  Nevertheless, many Federal health \ncare conscience laws and regulations protect issuers or plans specifically.  For example, 42 \nU.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u-2(b)(3) protect plans or managed care organizations in \nMedicaid or Medicare Advantage.  The Weldon Amendment protects HMOs, health insurance \nplans, and any other health care organizations are protected from being required to provide \ncoverage or pay for abortions.  See, for example, Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Pub. \nL. No. 115-31, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d).  Congress also declared this year that “it is the intent \nof Congress” to include a “conscience clause” which provides exceptions for religious beliefs if \nthe District of Columbia requires “the provision of contraceptive coverage by health insurance \nplans.”  See Id. at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808.  In light of the clearly expressed intent of \nCongress to protect religious liberty, particularly in certain health care contexts, along with the \nspecific efforts to protect issuers, the Departments have concluded that an exemption for issuers \nis appropriate. \n  As discussed above, where the exemption for plan sponsors or institutions of higher \neducation applies, issuers are exempt under those sections with respect to providing coverage in \nthose plans.  The issuer exemption in § 147.132(a)(1)(iii) adds to that protection, but the \nadditional protection operates in a different way than the plan sponsor exemption operates.  As \nset forth in these interim final rules, the only plan sponsors, or in the case of individual insurance \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 73 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     72  \n \ncoverage, individuals, who are eligible to purchase or enroll in health insurance coverage offered \nby an exempt issuer that does not cover some or all contraceptive services are plan sponsors or \nindividuals who themselves object and are otherwise exempt based on their objection.  Thus, the \nissuer exemption specifies that where a health insurance issuer providing group health insurance \ncoverage is exempt under paragraph (a)(1)(iii), the plan remains subject to any requirement to \nprovide coverage for contraceptive services under Guidelines issued under 42 CFR \n147.130(a)(1)(iv) unless the plan is otherwise exempt from that requirement. Accordingly, the \nonly plan sponsors, or in the case of individual insurance coverage, individuals, who are eligible \nto purchase or enroll in health insurance coverage offered by an issuer that is exempt under this \nparagraph (a)(1)(iii) that does not include coverage for some or all contraceptive services are \nplan sponsors or individuals who themselves object and are exempt.  Issuers that hold religious \nobjections should identify to plan sponsors the lack of contraceptive coverage in any health \ninsurance coverage being offered that is based on the issuer’s exemption, and communicate the \ngroup health plan’s independent obligation to provide contraceptive coverage, unless the group \nhealth plan itself is exempt under regulations governing the Mandate.  \nIn this way, the issuer exemption serves to protect objecting issuers both from being \nasked or required to issue policies that cover contraception in violation of the issuers’ sincerely \nheld religious beliefs, and from being asked or required to issue policies that omit contraceptive \ncoverage to non-exempt entities or individuals, thus subjecting the issuers to potential liability if \nthose plans are not exempt from the Guidelines.  At the same time, the issuer exemption will not \nserve to remove contraceptive coverage obligations from any plan or plan sponsor that is not also \nexempt, nor will it prevent other issuers from being required to provide contraceptive coverage \nin individual insurance coverage.  Permitting issuers to object to offering contraceptive coverage \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 74 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     73  \n \nbased on sincerely held religious beliefs will allow issuers to continue to offer coverage to plan \nsponsors and individuals, without subjecting them to liability under section 2713(a)(4) of the \nPHS Act or related provisions for their failure to provide contraceptive coverage.  \nThe issuer exemption does not specifically include third party administrators, although \nthe optional accommodation process provided under these interim final rules specifies that third \nparty administrators cannot be required to contract with an entity that invokes that process.  \nSome religious third party administrators have brought suit in conjunction with suits brought by \norganizations enrolled in ERISA-exempt church plans.  Such plans are now exempt under these \ninterim final rules, and their third party administrators, as claims processors, are under no \nobligation under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to provide benefits for contraceptive \nservices, as that section applies only to plans and issuers.  In the case of ERISA-covered plans, \nplan administrators are obligated under ERISA to follow the plan terms, but it is the \nDepartments’ understanding that third party administrators are not typically designated as plan \nadministrators under section 3(16) of ERISA and, therefore, would not normally act as plan \nadministrators under section 3(16) of ERISA.  Therefore, to the Departments’ knowledge, it is \nonly under the existing accommodation process that third party administrators are required to \nundertake any obligations to provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage to which they might \nobject.  These interim final rules make the accommodation process optional for employers and \nother plan sponsors, and specify that third party administrators that have their own objection to \ncomplying with the accommodation process may decline to enter into, or continue, contracts as \nthird party administrators of such plans.  For these reasons, these interim final rules do not \notherwise exempt third party administrators.  The Departments solicit public comment, however, \non whether there are situations where there may be an additional need to provide distinct \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 75 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     74  \n \nprotections for third party administrators that may have religious beliefs implicated by the \nMandate. \nF.  Scope of Objections Needed for the Objecting Entity Exemption \nExemptions for objecting entities specify that they apply where the entities object as \nspecified in § 147.132(a)(2).  That paragraph specifies that exemptions for objecting entities will \napply to the extent that an entity described in §147.132(a)(1) objects to its establishing, \nmaintaining, providing, offering, or arranging (as applicable) coverage, payments, or a plan that \nprovides coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services, based on its sincerely held \nreligious beliefs.  \nG.  Individual Exemption \nThese interim final rules include a special rule pertaining to individuals (referred to here \nas the “individual exemption”).  Section 147.132(b) provides that nothing in § 147.130(a)(1)(iv), \n26 CFR 54.9815–2713(a) (1)(iv), or 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), may be construed to \nprevent a willing plan sponsor of a group health plan or a willing health insurance issuer offering \ngroup or individual health insurance coverage, from offering a separate benefit package option, \nor a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance, to any individual who objects to \ncoverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services based on the individual’s sincerely \nheld religious beliefs.  The individual exemption extends to the coverage unit in which the plan \nparticipant, or subscriber in the individual market, is enrolled (for instance, to family coverage \ncovering the participant and his or her beneficiaries enrolled under the plan), but does not relieve \nthe plan’s or issuer’s obligation to comply with the Mandate with respect to the group health plan \nat large or, as applicable, to any other individual policies the issuer offers.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 76 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     75  \n \nThis individual exemption allows plan sponsors and issuers that do not specifically object \nto contraceptive coverage to offer religiously acceptable coverage to their participants or \nsubscribers who do object, while offering coverage that includes contraception to participants or \nsubscribers who do not object.  This individual exemption can apply with respect to individuals \nin plans sponsored by private employers or governmental employers.  For example, in one case \nbrought against the Departments, the State of Missouri enacted a law under which the State is not \npermitted to discriminate against insurance issuers that offer health plans without coverage for \ncontraception based on employees’ religious beliefs, or against the individual employees who \naccept such offers.  See Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1015–16 (quoting Mo. Rev. Stat. 191.724).  \nUnder the individual exemption of these interim final rules, employers sponsoring governmental \nplans would be free to honor the objections of individual employees by offering them plans that \nomit contraceptive coverage, even if those governmental entities do not object to offering \ncontraceptive coverage in general. \nThis “individual exemption” cannot be used to force a plan (or its sponsor) or an issuer to \nprovide coverage omitting contraception, or, with respect to health insurance coverage, to \nprevent the application of State law that requires coverage of such contraceptives or sterilization. \nNor can the individual exemption be construed to require the guaranteed availability of coverage \nomitting contraception to a plan sponsor or individual who does not have a sincerely held \nreligious objection.  This individual exemption is limited to the requirement to provide \ncontraceptive coverage under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, and does not affect any other \nFederal or State law governing the plan or coverage.  Thus, if there are other applicable laws or \nplan terms governing the benefits, these interim final rules do not affect such other laws or terms. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 77 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     76  \n \nThe Departments believe the individual exemption will help to meet the Affordable Care \nAct’s goal of increasing health coverage because it will reduce the incidence of certain \nindividuals choosing to forego health coverage because the only coverage available would \nviolate their sincerely held religious beliefs.62  At the same time, this individual exemption “does \nnot undermine the governmental interests furthered by the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement,”63 because, when the exemption is applicable, the individual does not want the \ncoverage, and therefore would not use the objectionable items even if they were covered.  \nH.  Optional Accommodation \nDespite expanding the scope of the exemption, these rules also keep the accommodation \nprocess, but revise it so as to make it optional.  In this way, objecting employers are no longer \nrequired to choose between direct compliance or compliance through the accommodation.  These \nrules maintain the location of the accommodation process in the Code of Federal Regulations at \n45 CFR 147.131, 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A.  These rules, by virtue \nof expanding the plan sponsor exemption beyond houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries \nthat were previously exempt, and beyond religious nonprofit groups that were previously \naccommodated, and by defining eligible organizations for the accommodation with reference to \nthose covered by the exemption, likewise expand the kinds of entities that may use the optional \naccommodation.  This includes plan sponsors with sincerely held religious beliefs for the reasons \ndescribed above.  Consequently, under these interim final rules, objecting employers may make \nuse of the exemption, or may choose to pursue the optional accommodation process.  If an \neligible organization pursues the optional accommodation process through the EBSA Form 700 \n                                                           \n62 See, for example, Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1017, and March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 130, where the courts \nnoted that the individual employee plaintiffs indicated that they viewed the Mandate as pressuring them to “forgo \nhealth insurance altogether.” \n63 78 FR 39874. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 78 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     77  \n \nor other specified notice to HHS, it voluntarily shifts an obligation to provide separate but \nseamless contraceptive coverage to its issuer or third party administrator.  \nThe fees adjustment process for qualifying health issuers or third party administrators \npursuant to 45 CFR 156.50 is not modified, and (as specified therein) requires for its \napplicability that an exception under OMB Circular No. A-25R be in effect as the Secretary of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services requests.    \nIf an eligible organization wishes to revoke its use of the accommodation, it can do so \nunder these interim final rules and operate under its exempt status.  As part of its revocation, the \nissuer or third party administrator of the eligible organization must provide participants and \nbeneficiaries written notice of such revocation as specified in guidance issued by the Secretary of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services.  This revocation process applies both \nprospectively to eligible organizations who decide at a later date to avail themselves of the \noptional accommodation and then decide to revoke that accommodation, as well as to \norganizations that were included in the accommodation prior to the effective date of these \ninterim final rules either by their submission of an EBSA Form 700 or notification, or by some \nother means under which their third party administrator or issuer was notified by DOL or HHS \nthat the accommodation applies.  Consistent with other applicable laws, the issuer or third party \nadministrator of an eligible organization must promptly notify plan participants and beneficiaries \nof the change of status to the extent such participants and beneficiaries are currently being \noffered contraceptive coverage at the time the accommodated organization invokes its \nexemption.  If contraceptive coverage is being offered by an issuer or third party administrator \nthrough the accommodation process, the revocation will be effective on the 1st day of the 1st plan \nyear that begins on or after 30 days after the date of the revocation (to allow for the provision of \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 79 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     78  \n \nnotice to plan participants in cases where contraceptive benefits will no longer be provided).  \nAlternatively, an eligible organization may give 60-days notice pursuant to section 2715(d)(4) of \nthe PHS Act,64 if applicable, to revoke its use of the accommodation process. \nThe Departments have eliminated the provision in the previous accommodation under \nwhich an issuer is deemed to have complied with the Mandate where the issuer relied reasonably \nand in good faith on a representation by an eligible organization as to its eligibility for the \naccommodation, even if that representation was later determined to be incorrect.  Because any \norganization with a sincerely held religious objection to contraceptive coverage is now eligible \nfor the optional accommodation under these interim final rules and is also exempt, the \nDepartments believe there is minimal opportunity for mistake or misrepresentation by the \norganization, and the reliance provision is no longer necessary.  \nI.  Definition of Contraceptive Services for the Purpose of these Rules  \nThe interim final rules specify that when the rules refer to “contraceptive” services, \nbenefits, or coverage, such terms include contraceptive or sterilization items, services, or related \npatient education or counseling, to the extent specified for purposes of § 147.130(a)(1)(iv).  This \nwas the case under the previous rules, as expressed in the preamble text of the various iterations \nof the regulations, but the Departments wish to make the scope clear by specifying it in the \nregulatory text. \nJ.  Conclusion \nThe Departments believe that the Guidelines and the exemptions expanded herein will \nadvance the limited purposes for which Congress imposed section 2713 of the PHS Act, while \nacting consistently with Congress’ well-established record of allowing for religious exemptions \n                                                           \n64 See also 26 CFR 54.9815-2715(b); 29 CFR  2590.715-2715(b); 45 CFR 147.200(b). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 80 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     79  \n \nwith respect to especially sensitive health care and health insurance requirements.  These interim \nfinal rules leave fully in place over a dozen Federal programs that provide, or subsidize, \ncontraceptives for women, including for low income women based on financial need.  These \ninterim final rules also maintain HRSA’s discretion to decide whether to continue to require \ncontraceptive coverage under the Guidelines (in plans where Congress applied section 2713 of \nthe PHS Act) if no objection exists.  The Departments believe this array of programs and \nrequirements better serves the interest of providing contraceptive coverage while protecting the \nconscience rights of entities that have sincerely held religious objections to some or all \ncontraceptive or sterilization services.  \nThe Departments request and encourage public comments on all matters addressed in \nthese interim final rules. \nV.  Interim Final Rules, Request for Comments and Waiver of Delay of Effective \nDate \nSection 9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the PHS Act \nauthorize the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS (collectively, the Secretaries) to \npromulgate any interim final rules that they determine are appropriate to carry out the provisions \nof chapter 100 of the Code, part 7 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, and part A of title XXVII of \nthe PHS Act, which include sections 2701 through 2728 of the PHS Act and the incorporation of \nthose sections into section 715 of ERISA and section 9815 of the Code.  These interim final rules \nfall under those statutory authorized justifications, as did previous rules on this matter (75 FR \n41726; 76 FR 46621; 79 FR 51092). \nSection 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires notice and comment \nrulemaking, involving a notice of proposed rulemaking and a comment period prior to \nfinalization of regulatory requirements – except when an agency, for good cause, finds that \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 81 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     80  \n \nnotice and public comment thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \ninterest.  These provisions of the APA do not apply here because of the specific authority granted \nto the Secretaries by section 9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the \nPHS Act.  \nEven if these provisions of the APA applied, they would be satisfied:  The Departments \nhave determined that it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay \nputting these provisions in place until a full public notice-and-comment process is completed.  \nAs discussed earlier, the Departments have issued three interim final rules implementing this \nsection of the PHS Act because of the immediate needs of covered entities and the weighty \nmatters implicated by the HRSA Guidelines.  As recently as December 20, 2016, HRSA updated \nthose Guidelines without engaging in the regulatory process (because doing so is not a legal \nrequirement), and announced that it plans to continue to update the Guidelines.  \nDozens of lawsuits over the Mandate have been pending for nearly 5 years.  The Supreme \nCourt remanded several of those cases more than a year ago, stating that on remand “[w]e \nanticipate that the Courts of Appeals will allow the parties sufficient time to resolve any \noutstanding issues between them”.  Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1560.  During that time, Courts of \nAppeals have been asking the parties in those cases to submit status reports every 30 through 90 \ndays.  Those status reports have informed the courts that the parties were in discussions, and \nabout the RFI issued in late 2016 and its subsequent comment process and the FAQ the \nDepartments issued indicating that we could not find a way at that time to amend the \naccommodation process so as to satisfy objecting eligible organizations while pursuing the \nDepartments’ policy goals.  Since then, several courts have issued orders setting more pressing \ndeadlines.  For example, on March 10, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 82 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     81  \n \nCircuit ordered that, by May 1, 2017, “the court expects to see either a report of an agreement to \nresolve the case or detailed reports on the parties' respective positions.  In the event no agreement \nis reported on or before May 1, 2017, the court will plan to schedule oral argument on the merits \nof the case on short notice after that date”.  The Departments submitted a status report but were \nunable to set forth their specific position because this interim final rule was not yet on public \ndisplay. Instead, the Departments informed the Court that we “are now considering whether \nfurther administrative action would be appropriate”.  In response, the court extended the deadline \nto June 1, 2017, again declaring the court expected “to see either a report of an agreement to \nresolve the case or detailed reports on the parties' respective positions”.  The Departments were \nagain unable to set forth their position in that status report, but were able to state that the \n“Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury are engaged in \nrulemaking to reconsider the regulations at issue here,” citing \nhttps://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eoDetails?rrid=127381.  \nAs discussed above, the Departments have concluded that, in many instances, requiring \ncertain objecting entities or individuals to choose between the Mandate, the accommodation, or \npenalties for noncomplaince has violated RFRA.  Good cause exists to issue the expanded \nexemption in these interim final rules in order to cure such violations (whether among litigants or \namong similarly situated parties that have not litigated), to help settle or resolve cases, and to \nensure, moving forward, that our regulations are consistent with any approach we have taken in \nresolving certain litigation matters.  \nThe Departments have also been subject to temporary injunctions protecting many \nreligious nonprofit organizations from being subject to the accommodation process against their \nwishes, while many other organizations are fully exempt, have permanent court orders blocking \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 83 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     82  \n \nthe contraceptive coverage requirement, or are not subject to section 2713 of the PHS Act and its \nenforcement due to Congress’ limited application of that requirement.  Good cause exists to \nchange the Departments’ previous rules to direct HRSA to bring its Guidelines in accord with the \nlegal realities and remove the threat of a future violation of religious beliefs, including where \nsuch violations are contrary to Federal law. \nOther objecting entities similarly have not had the protection of court injunctions.  This \nincludes some nonprofit entities that have sued the Departments, but it also includes some \norganizations that do not have lawsuits pending against us.  For example, many of the closely \nheld for-profit companies that brought the array of lawsuits challenging the Mandate leading up \nto the decision in Hobby Lobby are not protected by injunctions from the current rules, including \nthe requirement that they either fully comply with the Mandate or subject themselves to the \naccommodation.  Continuing to apply the Mandate’s regulatory burden on individuals and \norganizations with religious beliefs against it could serve as a deterrent for citizens who might \nconsider forming new entities—nonprofit or for-profit—and to offering health insurance in \nemployer-sponsored plans or plans arranged by institutions of higher education.  Delaying the \nprotection afforded by these interim final rules would be contrary to the public interest because it \nwould serve to extend for many months the harm caused to all entities and individuals with \nreligious objections to the Mandate.  Good cause exists to provide immediate resolution to this \nmyriad of situations rather than leaving them to continued uncertainty, inconsistency, and cost \nduring litigation challenging the previous rules.  \nThese interim final rules provide a specific policy resolution that courts have been \nwaiting to receive from the Departments for more than a year.  If the Departments were to \npublish a notice of proposed rulemaking instead of these interim final rules, many more months \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 84 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     83  \n \ncould pass before the current Mandate is lifted from the entities receiving the expanded \nexemption, during which time those entities would be deprived of the relief clearly set forth in \nthese interim final rules.  In response to several of the previous rules on this issue—including \nthree issued as interim final rules under the statutory authority cited above—the Departments \nreceived more than 100,000 public comments on multiple occasions.  Those comments included \nextensive discussion about whether and by what extent to expand the exemption.  Most recently, \non July 26, 2016, the Departments issued a request for information (81 FR 47741) and received \nover 54,000 public comments about different possible ways to resolve these issues.  In \nconnection with past regulations, the Departments have offered or expanded a temporary safe \nharbor allowing organizations that were not exempt from the HRSA Guidelines to operate out of \ncompliance with the Guidelines.  The Departments will fully consider comments submitted in \nresponse to these interim final rules, but believe that good cause exists to issue the rules on an \ninterim final basis before the comments are submitted and reviewed. \nAs the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stated with respect to an \nearlier interim final rule promulgated with respect to this issue in Priests for Life v. U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, 772 F.3d 229, 276 (D.C. Cir. 2014), vacated on other \ngrounds, Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016), “[S]everal reasons support HHS’s decision \nnot to engage in notice and comment here”.  Among other things, the Court noted that “the \nagency made a good cause finding in the rule it issued”; that “the regulations the interim final \nrule modifies were recently enacted pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking, and presented \nvirtually identical issues”; that “HHS will expose its interim rule to notice and comment before \nits permanent implementation”; and that “delay in implementation of the rule would interfere \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 85 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     84  \n \nwith the prompt availability of contraceptive coverage and delay the implementation of the \nalternative opt-out for religious objectors”.  Id. at 277. \nDelaying the availability of the expanded exemption would delay the ability of those \norganizations and individuals to avail themselves of the relief afforded by these interim final \nrules.  Good cause is supported by providing relief for entities and individuals for whom the \nMandate operates in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs, but who would have to \nexperience that burden for many more months under the prior regulations if these rules are not \nissued on an interim final basis.  Good cause is also supported by the effect of these interim final \nrules in bringing to a close the uncertainty caused by years of litigation and regulatory changes \nmade under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act.  Issuing interim final rules with a comment \nperiod provides the public with an opportunity to comment on whether these regulations \nexpanding the exemption should be made permanent or subject to modification without delaying \nthe effective date of the regulations.  \nDelaying the availability of the expanded exemption would also increase the costs of \nhealth insurance.  As reflected in litigation pertaining to the Mandate, some entities are in \ngrandfathered health plans that do not cover contraception.  They wish to make changes to their \nhealth plans that will reduce the costs of insurance coverage for their beneficiaries or \npolicyholders, but which would cause the plans to lose grandfathered status.  They are refraining \nfrom making those changes—and therefore are continuing to incur and pass on higher insurance \ncosts—to prevent the Mandate from applying to their plans in violation of their consciences. \nIssuing these rules on an interim final basis is necessary in order to help reduce the costs of \nhealth insurance for such entities and their plan participants. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 86 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     85  \n \nThese interim final rules also set forth an optional accommodation process, and expand \neligibility for that process to a broader category of entities.  Delaying the availability of the \noptional accommodation process would delay the ability of organizations that do not now qualify \nfor the accommodation, but wish to opt into it, to be able to do so and therefore to provide a \nmechanism for contraceptive coverage  to be provided to their employees while the \norganization’s religious objections are accommodated. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Departments have determined that it would be \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest to engage in full notice and comment \nrulemaking before putting these interim final rules into effect, and that it is in the public interest \nto promulgate interim final rules.  For the same reasons, the Departments have determined, \nconsistent with section 553(d) of the APA (5 U.S.C. 553(d)), that there is good cause to make \nthese interim final rules effective immediately upon filing at the Office of the Federal Register. \nVI.  Economic Impact and Paperwork Burden \nWe have examined the impacts of the interim final rules as required by Executive Order \n12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 on \nImproving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the Regulatory Flexibility Act \n(RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96 354), section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, section \n202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995; Pub. L. 104-4), Executive \nOrder 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999), the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2) \nand Executive Order 13771 on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs (January \n30, 2017). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 87 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     86  \n \nA.  Executive Orders 12866 and 13563—Department of HHS and Department of Labor \nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of \navailable regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches \nthat maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, and public health and \nsafety effects; distributive impacts; and equity).  Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the \nimportance of quantifying both costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and \npromoting flexibility. \nSection 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a “significant regulatory action” as an \naction that is likely to result in a regulation: (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 \nmillion or more in any one year, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, \nproductivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal \ngovernments or communities (also referred to as “economically significant”); (2) creating a \nserious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; \n(3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan programs or \nthe rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising \nout of legal mandates, the President’s priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. \nA regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for major rules with economically \nsignificant effects ($100 million or more in any one year), and an “economically significant” \nregulatory action is subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  As \ndiscussed below regarding anticipated effects of these rules and the Paperwork Reduction Act, \nthese interim final rules are not likely to have economic impacts of $100 million or more in any 1 \nyear, and therefore do not meet the definition of “economically significant” under Executive \nOrder 12866.  However, OMB has determined that the actions are significant within the meaning \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 88 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     87  \n \nof section 3(f)(4) of the Executive Order.  Therefore, OMB has reviewed these final regulations, \nand the Departments have provided the following assessment of their impact. \n1.  Need for Regulatory Action \nThese interim final rules amend the Departments’ July 2015 final regulations to expand \nthe exemption from the requirement to provide coverage for contraceptives and sterilization, \nestablished under the HRSA Guidelines, promulgated under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, \nsection 715(a)(1) of the ERISA, and section 9815(a)(1) of the Code, and to revise the \naccommodation process to make it optional for eligible organizations.  The expanded exemption \nwould apply to individuals and entities that have religious objections to some (or all) of the \ncontraceptive and/or sterilization services that would be covered under the Guidelines.  Such \naction is taken, among other reasons, to provide for participation in the health insurance market \nby certain entities or individuals free from penalties for violating sincerely held religious beliefs \nopposed to providing or receiving coverage of contraceptive services, and to resolve many of the \nlawsuits that have been filed against the Departments. \n2.  Anticipated Effects \nThe Departments assess this interim final rule together with a companion interim final \nrule concerning moral but non-religious conscientious objections to contraception, published \nelsewhere in this Federal Register.  Regarding entities that are extended an exemption, absent \nexpansion of the exemption the Guidelines would require many of these entities and individuals \nto either: pay for coverage of contraceptive services that they find religiously objectionable; \nsubmit self-certifications that would result in their issuer or third party administrator paying for \nsuch services for their employees, which some entities also believe entangles them in the \nprovision of such objectionable coverage; or, pay tax penalties or be subject to other adverse \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 89 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     88  \n \nconsequences for non-compliance with these requirements.  These interim final rules remove \ncertain associated burdens imposed on these entities and individuals—that is, by recognizing \ntheir religious objections and exempting them—on the basis of such objections—from the \ncontraceptive and/or sterilization coverage requirement of the HRSA Guidelines and making the \naccommodation process optional for eligible organizations.  \nTo the extent that entities choose to revoke their accommodated status to make use of the \nexpanded exemption immediately, a notice will need to be sent to enrollees (either by the entity \nor by the issuer or third party administrator) that their contraceptive coverage is changing, and \nguidance will reflect that such a notice requirement is imposed no more than is already required \nby preexisting rules that require notices to be sent to enrollees of changes to coverage during a \nplan year.  If the entities wait until the start of their next plan year to change to exempt status, \ninstead of doing so during a plan year, those entities generally will also be able to avoid sending \nany supplementary notices in addition to what they would otherwise normally send prior to the \nstart of a new plan year.  Additionally, these interim final rules provide such entities with an \noffsetting regulatory benefit by the exemption itself and its relief of burdens on their religious \nbeliefs.  As discussed below, assuming that more than half of entities that have been using the \nprevious accommodation will seek immediate revocation of their accommodated status and \nnotices will be sent to all their enrollees, the total estimated cost of sending those notices will be \n$51,990. \nThe Departments estimate that these interim final rules will not result in any additional \nburdens or costs on issuers or third party administrators.  As discussed below, the Departments \nbelieve that 109 of the 209 entities making use of the accommodation process will instead make \nuse of their newly exempt status.  In contrast, the Departments expect that a much smaller \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 90 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     89  \n \nnumber (which we assume to be 9) will make use of the accommodation that were not provided \naccess to it previously.  Reduced burdens for issuers and third party administrators due to \nreductions in use of the accommodation will more than offset increased obligations on issuers \nand third party administrators serving the fewer number of entities that will newly opt into the \naccommodation.  This will lead to a net decrease in burdens and costs on issuers and third party \nadministrators, who will no longer have continuing obligations imposed on them by the \naccommodation. \nThese interim final rules will result in some persons covered in plans of newly exempt \nentities not receiving coverage or payments for contraceptive services.  The Departments do not \nhave sufficient data to determine the actual effect of these rules on plan participants and \nbeneficiaries, including for costs they may incur for contraceptive coverage, nor of unintended \npregnancies that may occur.  As discussed above and for reasons explained here, there are \nmultiple levels of uncertainty involved in measuring the effect of the expanded exemption, \nincluding but not limited to-- \n how many entities will make use of their newly exempt status. \n how many entities will opt into the accommodation maintained by these rules, under  \nwhich their plan participants will continue receiving contraceptive coverage. \n which contraceptive methods some newly exempt entities will continue to provide  \nwithout cost-sharing despite the entity objecting to other methods (for example, as reflected in \nHobby Lobby, several objecting entities still provide coverage for 14 of the 18 women’s \ncontraceptive or sterilization methods, 134 S. Ct. at 2766). \n how many women will be covered by plans of entities using their newly exempt  \nstatus. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 91 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     90  \n \n which of the women covered by those plans want and would have used contraceptive  \ncoverage or payments for contraceptive methods that are no longer covered by such  \nplans. \n whether, given the broad availability of contraceptives and their relatively low cost,  \nsuch women will obtain and use contraception even if it is not covered. \n the degree to which such women are in the category of women identified by IOM as  \nmost at risk of unintended pregnancy. \n the degree to which unintended pregnancies may result among those women, which  \nwould be attributable as an effect of these rules only if the women did not otherwise use \ncontraception or a particular contraceptive method due to their plan making use of its newly \nexempt status. \n the degree to which such unintended pregnancies may be associated with negative  \nhealth effects, or whether such effects may be offset by other factors, such as the fact that those \nwomen will be otherwise enrolled in insurance coverage. \n the extent to which such women will qualify for alternative sources of contraceptive  \naccess, such as through a parent’s or spouse’s plan, or through one of the many governmental \nprograms that subsidize contraceptive coverage to supplement their access.  \nThe Departments have access to sources of information discussed in the following \nparagraphs that are relevant to this issue, but those sources do not provide a full picture of the \nimpact of these interim final rules.  \nFirst, the prior rules already exempted certain houses of worship and their integrated \nauxiliaries.  Further, as discussed above, the prior accommodation process allows hundreds of \nadditional religious nonprofit organizations in self-insured church plans that are exempt from \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 92 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     91  \n \nERISA to file a self-certification or notice that relieves not only themselves but, in effect, their \nthird party administrators of any obligation to provide contraceptive coverage or payments.  \nAlthough in the latter case, third party administrators are legally permitted to provide the \ncoverage, several self-insured church plans themselves have expressed an objection in litigation \nto allowing such contraceptive coverage to be provided, and according to information received \nduring litigation, it appears that such contraceptive coverage has not been provided.  In addition, \na significant portion of the lawsuits challenging the Mandate were brought by a single firm \nrepresenting Catholic dioceses and related entities covered by their diocese-sponsored plans.  In \nthat litigation, the Departments took the position that, where those diocese-sponsored plans are \nself-insured, those plans are likely church plans exempt from ERISA.65  For the purposes of \nconsidering whether the expanded exemption in these rules affects the persons covered by such \ndiocese-sponsored plans, the Departments continue to assume that such plans are similar to other \nobjecting entities using self-insured church plans with respect to their third party administrators \nbeing unlikely to provide contraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries under the \nprevious rule.  Therefore the Departments estimate that these interim final rules have no \nsignificant effect on the contraceptive coverage of women covered by plans of houses of worship \nand their integrated auxiliaries, entities using a self-insured church plan, or church dioceses \nsponsoring self-insured plans.  \nIt is possible that an even greater number of litigating or accommodated plans might have \nmade use of self-insured church plan status under the previous accommodation.  Notably, one of \n                                                           \n65 See, for example, Brief in Opp. To Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Brandt v. Burwell, No. 2:14-cv-681-AJS, doc. # 23 \n(W.D. Pa. filed June 10, 2014) (arguing that “plaintiffs have not established an injury in fact to the degree plaintiffs \nhave a self-insured church plan,” based on the fact that “the same law firm representing the plaintiffs here has \nsuggested in another similar case that all ‘Catholic entities like the Archdiocese participate in “church plans.”’); \nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (“because plaintiffs’ \nself-insured plans are church plans, their third party administrators would not be required to provide contraceptive \ncoverage”). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 93 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     92  \n \nthe largest nonprofit employers that had filed suit challenging the Mandate had, under these prior \nrules, shifted most of their employees into self-insured church plans, and the Departments have \ntaken the position that various other employers that filed suit were eligible to assume self-insured \nchurch plan status.66  The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Advocate Health Care Network, \nwhile not involving this Mandate, also clarifies certain circumstances under which religious \nhospitals may be eligible for self-insured church plan status.  See 137 S. Ct. at 1656–57, 1663 \n(holding that a church plan under ERISA can be a plan not established and maintained by a \nchurch, if it is maintained by a principal-purpose organization). \nSecond, when the Departments previously created the exemption, expanded its \napplication, and provided an accommodation (which, as mentioned, can lift obligations on self-\ninsured church plans for hundreds of nonprofit organizations), we concluded that no significant \nburden or costs would result at all. (76 FR 46625; 78 FR 39889.)  We reached this conclusion \ndespite the impact, just described, whereby the previous rule apparently lead to women not \nreceiving contraceptive coverage through hundreds of nonprofit entities using self-insured \nchurch plans.  We also reached this conclusion without counting any significant burden or cost to \nsome women covered in the plans of houses of worship or integrated auxiliaries that might want \ncontraceptive coverage.  This conclusion was based in part on the assertion, set forth in previous \nregulations, that employees of houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries likely share their \nemployers’ opposition to contraception.  Many other religious nonprofit entities, however, both \nadopt and implement religious principles with similar fervency.  For the reasons discussed \nabove, the Departments no longer believe we can distinguish many of the women covered in the \nplans of religious nonprofit entities from the women covered in the plans of houses of worship \n                                                           \n66 See https://www.franciscanhealth.org/sites/default/files/2015%20employee%20benefit%20booklet.pdf.; see, for \nexample, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 94 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     93  \n \nand integrated auxiliaries regarding which the Departments assumed share their employers’ \nobjection to contraception, nor from women covered in the plans of religious entities using self-\ninsured church plans regarding which we chose not to calculate any anticipated effect even \nthough we conceded we were not requiring their third party administrators to provide \ncontraceptive coverage.  In the estimates and assumptions below, we include the potential effect \nof these interim rules on women covered by such entities, in order to capture all of the \nanticipated effects of these rules. \nThird, these interim final rules extend the exemption to for-profit entities.  Among the \nfor-profit employers that filed suit challenging the Mandate, the one with the most employees \nwas Hobby Lobby.67  As noted above, and like some similar entities, the plaintiffs in Hobby \nLobby were willing to provide coverage with no cost sharing of various contraceptive services: \n14 of 18 FDA-approved women’s contraceptive and sterilization methods.68  (134 S. Ct. at \n2766.)  The effect of expanding the exemption to for-profit entities is therefore mitigated to the \nextent many of the persons covered by such entities’ plans may receive coverage for at least \nsome contraceptive services. No publicly traded for-profit entities have filed lawsuits challenging \nthe Mandate. The Departments agree with the Supreme Court’s expectation in this regard: “it \n                                                           \n67 Verified Complaint ¶ 34, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., et al. v. Sebelius, No. 5:12-cv-01000-HE (Sept. 12, 2012 \nW.D. Okla.) (13,240 employees).  \n68 By reference to the FDA Birth Control Guide’s list of 18 birth control methods for women and 2 for men, \nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepublications/ucm517406.pdf, Hobby \nLobby and entities with similar beliefs were not willing to cover: IUD copper; IUD with progestin; emergency \ncontraceptive (Levonorgestrel); and emergency contraceptive (Ulipristal Acetate).  See 134 S. Ct. at 2765–66. \nHobby Lobby was willing to cover: sterilization surgery for women; sterilization implant for women; implantable \nrod; shot/injection; oral contraceptives (“the Pill”—combined pill); oral contraceptives (“the Pill”—\nextended/continuous use/combined pill); oral contraceptives (“the Mini Pill”—progestin only); patch; vaginal \ncontraceptive ring; diaphragm with spermicide; sponge with spermicide; cervical cap with spermicide; female \ncondom; spermicide alone. Id.  Among women using these 18 female contraceptive methods, 85 percent use the 14 \nmethods that Hobby Lobby and entities with similar beliefs were willing to cover (22,446,000 out of 26,436,000), \nand “[t]he pill and female sterilization have been the two most commonly used methods since 1982.” See \nGuttmacher Institute, “Contraceptive Use in the United States” (Sept. 2016), available at \nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 95 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     94  \n \nseems unlikely that the sort of corporate giants to which HHS refers will often assert RFRA \nclaims.  HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly traded corporation asserting RFRA \nrights, and numerous practical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring.  For example, \nthe idea that unrelated shareholders—including institutional investors with their own set of \nstakeholders—would agree to run a corporation under the same religious beliefs seems \nimprobable”.  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2774.  Therefore, although publicly traded entities \ncould make use of exempt status under these interim final rules, the Departments do not expect \nthat very many will do so, as compared to the 87 religious closely held for-profit entities that \nbrought litigation challenging the Mandate (some of which might be content with the \naccommodation). \nFourth, the Departments have a limited amount of information about entities that have \nmade use of the accommodation process as set forth in the previous rules.  HHS previously \nestimated that 209 entities would make use of the accommodation process.  That estimate was \nbased on HHS’s observation in its August 2014 interim final rules and July 2015 final \nregulations that there were 122 eligible entities that had filed litigation challenging the \naccommodation process, and 87 closely held for-profit entities that had filed suit challenging the \nMandate in general.  (79 FR 51096; 80 FR 41336).  The Departments acknowledged that entities \nthat had not litigated might make use of the accommodation, but we stated we did not have better \ndata to estimate how many might use the accommodation overall.  \nAfter issuing those rules, the Departments have not received complete data on the number \nof entities actually using the accommodation, because the accommodation does not require many \naccommodated entities to submit information to us. Our limited records indicate that \napproximately 63 entities have affirmatively submitted notices to HHS to use the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 96 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     95  \n \naccommodation.  This includes some fully insured and some self-insured plans, but it does not \ninclude entities that may have used the accommodation by submitting an EBSA form 700 self-\ncertification directly to their issuer or third party administrator.  We have deemed some other \nentities as being subject to the accommodation through their litigation filings, but that might not \nhave led to contraceptive coverage being provided to persons covered in some of those plans, \neither because they are exempt as houses of worship or integrated auxiliaries, they are in self-\ninsured church plans, or we were not aware of their issuers or third party administrators so as to \nsend them letters obligating them to provide such coverage.  Our records also indicate that 60 \nplans used the contraceptive user fees adjustments in the 2015 plan year, the last year for which \nwe have data.  This includes only self-insured plans, and it includes some plans that self-certified \nthrough submitting notices and other plans that, presumably, self-certified through the EBSA \nform 700.  \nThese sets of data are not inconsistent with our previous estimate that 209 entities would \nuse the accommodation, but they indicate that some non-litigating entities used the \naccommodation, and some litigating entities did not, possibly amounting to a similar number. \nFor this reason, and because we do not have more complete data available, we believe the \nprevious estimate of 209 accommodated entities is still the best estimate available for how many \nentities have used the accommodation under the previous rule.  This assumes that the number of \nlitigating entities that did not use the accommodation is approximately the same as the number of \nnon-litigating entities that did use it.  \nIn considering how many entities will use the voluntary accommodation moving \nforward—and how many will use the expanded exemption—we also do not have specific data.  \nWe expect the 122 nonprofit entities that specifically challenged the accommodation in court to \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 97 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     96  \n \nuse the expanded exemption. But, as noted above, we believe a significant number of them are \nnot presently participating in the accommodation, and that some nonprofit entities in self-insured \nchurch plans are not providing contraceptive coverage through their third party administrators \neven if they are using the accommodation.  Among the 87 for-profit entities that filed suit \nchallenging the Mandate in general, few if any filed suit challenging the accommodation.  We do \nnot know how many of those entities are using the accommodation, how many may be \ncomplying with the Mandate fully, how many may be relying on court injunctions to do neither, \nor how many will use the expanded exemption moving forward.  Among entities that never \nlitigated but used the accommodation, we expect many but not all of them to continue using the \naccommodation, and we do not have data to estimate how many such entities there are or how \nmany will choose either option.  \nOverall, therefore, without sufficient data to estimate what the estimated 209 previously \naccommodated entities will do under these interim final rules, we assume that just over half of \nthem will use the expanded exemption, and just under half will continue their accommodated \nstatus under the voluntary process set forth in these rules.  Specifically, we assume that 109 \npreviously accommodated entities will make use of their exempt status, and 100 will continue \nusing the accommodation.  This estimate is based in part on our view that most litigating \nnonprofit entities would prefer the exemption to the accommodation, but that many of either \nhave not been using the accommodation or, if they have been using it, it is not providing \ncontraceptive coverage for women in their plans where they participate in self-insured church \nplans.  This estimate is also consistent with our lack of knowledge of how many for-profit \nentities were using the accommodation and will choose the exemption or the accommodation, \ngiven that many of them did not bring legal challenges against the accommodation after Hobby \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 98 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     97  \n \nLobby.  This estimate is further consistent with our view, explained in more detail below, that \nsome entities that are using the accommodation and did not bring litigation will use the \nexemption, but many accommodated, non-litigating entities—including the ones with the largest \nrelative workforces among accommodated entities—will continue using the accommodation.  \nThe Departments recognize that we do not have better data to estimate the effects of these \ninterim final rules on such entities. \nIn addition to these factors, we recognize that the expanded exemption and \naccommodation are newly available to religious for-profit entities that are not closely held and \nsome other plan sponsors.  As explained above, the Departments believe religious for-profit \nentities that are not closely held may exist, or may wish to come into being. HHS does not \nanticipate that there will be significant number of such entities, and among those, we believe that \nvery few if any will use the accommodation.  All of the for-profit entities that have challenged \nthe Mandate have been religious closely held entities.  \nIt is also possible that religious nonprofit or closely held for-profit entities that were \nalready eligible for the accommodation but did not previously use it will opt into it moving \nforward, but because they could have done so under the previous rules, their opting into the \naccommodation is not caused by these rules.  \nWithout any data to estimate how many of any entities newly eligible for and interested \nin using the accommodation might exist, HHS assumes for the purposes of estimating the \nanticipated effect of these rules that less than 10 entities (9) will do so.  Therefore, we estimate \nthat 109 entities will use the voluntary accommodation moving forward, 100 of which were \nalready using the previous accommodation, and that 109 entities that have been using the \nprevious accommodation will use the expanded exemption instead. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 99 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     98  \n \nFifth, in attempting to estimate the anticipated effect of these interim final rules on \nwomen receiving contraceptive coverage, the Departments have limited information about the \nentities that have filed suit challenging the Mandate.  Approximately 209 entities have brought \nsuit challenging the Mandate over more than 5 years.  They have included a broad range of \nnonprofit entities and closely held for-profit entities.  We discuss a number of potentially \nrelevant points: \nFirst, the Departments do not believe that out-of-pocket litigation costs have been a \nsignificant barrier to entities choosing to file suit.  Based on the Departments’ knowledge of \nthese cases through public sources and litigation, nearly all the entities were represented pro \nbono and were subject to little or no discovery during the cases, and multiple public interest law \nfirms publicly provided legal services for entities willing to challenge the Mandate.69  (It is \nnoteworthy, however, that such pro bono arrangements and minimization of discovery do not \neliminate 100 percent of the time costs of participating in litigation or, as discussed in more \ndetail below, the potential for negative publicity.  Both concerns could have dissuaded \nparticipation in lawsuits, and the potential for negative publicity may also dissuade participation \nin the expanded exemptions.)  \nSecond, prior to the Affordable Care Act, the vast majority of entities already covered \ncontraception, albeit not always without cost-sharing  The Departments do not have data to \n                                                           \n69 See, for example, Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, “Award-winning attorney ‘humbled’ by recognition,” Pittsburgh \nCatholic (“Jones Day is doing the cases ‘pro bono,’ or voluntarily and without payment.”) (quoting Paul M. Pohl, \nPartner, Jones Day), available at http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/award-winning-attorney-humbled-recognition; \n“Little Sisters Fight for Religious Freedom,” National Review (Oct. 2, 2013) (“the Becket Fund for Religious \nLiberty is representing us pro bono, as they do all their clients.”) (quoting Sister Constance Veit, L.S.P., \ncommunications director for the Little Sisters of the Poor), available at \nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/article/360103/little-sisters-fight-religious-freedom-interview; Suzanne Cassidy, \n“Meet the major legal players in the Conestoga Wood Specialties Supreme Court case,” LancasterOnline (Mar. 25, \n2014) (“Cortman and the other lawyers arguing on behalf of Conestoga Wood Specialties and Hobby Lobby are \noffering their services pro bono.”), available at http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/meet-the-major-legal-players-\nin-the-conestoga-wood-specialties/article_302bc8e2-b379-11e3-b669-001a4bcf6878.html. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 100 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     99  \n \nindicate why entities that did not cover contraception prior to the Affordable Care Act chose not \nto cover it. As noted above, however, the Departments have maintained that compliance with the \ncontraceptive Mandate is cost-neutral to issuers, which indicates that no significant financial \nincentive exists to omit contraceptive coverage.  As indicated by the report by HHS ASPE \ndiscussed above, we have assumed that millions of women received preventive services after the \nMandate went into effect because nearly all entities complied with the Guidelines.  We are not \naware of expressions from most of those entities indicating that they would have sincerely held \nreligious objections to complying with the Mandate, and therefore that they would make use of \nthe expanded exemption provided here.  \nThird, omitting contraceptive coverage has subjected some entities to serious public \ncriticism and in some cases organized boycotts or opposition campaigns that have been reported \nin various media and online outlets regarding entities that have filed suit.  The Departments \nexpect that even if some entities might not receive such criticism, many entities will be reluctant \nto use the expanded exemption unless they are committed to their views to a significant degree.  \nOverall, the Departments do not know how many entities will use the expanded \nexemption.  We expect that some non-litigating entities will use it, but given the aforementioned \nconsiderations, we believe it might not be very many more.  Moreover, many litigating entities \nare already exempt or are not providing contraceptive coverage to women in their plans due to \ntheir participating in self-insured church plans, so the effect of the expanded exemption among \nlitigating entities is significantly lower than it would be if all the women in their plans were \nalready receiving the coverage.  \nTo calculate the anticipated effects of this rule on contraceptive coverage among women \ncovered by plans provided by litigating entities, we start by examining court documents and \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 101 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     100  \n \nother public sources.70  These sources provide some information, albeit incomplete, about how \nmany people are employed by these entities.  As noted above, however, contraceptive coverage \namong the employees of many litigating entities will not be affected by these rules because some \nlitigating entities were exempt under the prior rule, while others were or appeared to be in self-\ninsured church plans so that women covered in their plans were already not receiving \ncontraceptive coverage.  \nAmong litigating entities that were neither exempt nor likely using self-insured church \nplans, our best estimate based on court documents and public sources is that such entities \nemployed approximately 65,000 persons, male and female.71  The average number of workers at \nfirms offering health benefits that are actually covered by those benefits is 62 percent.72  This \namounts to approximately 34,000 employees covered under those plans. DOL estimates that for \neach employee policyholder, there is approximately one dependent.73  This amounts to \napproximately 68,000 covered persons.  Census data indicate that women of childbearing age—\n                                                           \n70 Where complaints, affidavits, or other documents filed in court did not indicate the number of employees that \nwork for an entity, and that entity was not apparently exempt as a house of worship or integrated auxiliary, and it \nwas not using the kind of plan that we have stated in litigation qualifies for self-insured church plan status (see, for \nexample, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 2013)), we \nexamined employment data contained in some IRS form W-3’s that are publicly available online for certain \nnonprofit groups, and looked at other websites discussing the number of people employed at certain entities.  \n71  In a small number of lawsuits, named plaintiffs include organizations claiming to have members that seek an \nexemption.  We have very little information about the number, size, and types of entities those members.  Based on \nlimited information from those cases, however, their membership appears to consist mainly, although not entirely, of \nhouses of worship, integrated auxiliaries, and participants in self-insured plans of churches.  As explained above, the \ncontraceptive coverage of women covered by such plans is not likely to be affected by the expanded exemption in \nthese rules.  However, to account for plans subject to contraceptive coverage obligations among those members we \nhave added 10,000 to our estimate of the number of persons among litigants that may be impacted by these rules. \n72 See Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits: 2017 \nAnnual Survey” at 57, available at http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-\n2017. \n73 “Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin” Table 4, page 21.

On average, we expect that approximately half of those students (1,650) are \nfemale.  For the purposes of this estimate, we also assume that female policyholders covered by \nplans arranged by institutions of higher education are women of childbearing age.  We expect \nthat they would have less than the average number of dependents per policyholder than exists in \nstandard plans, but for the purposes of providing an upper bound to this estimate, we assume that \nthey would have an average of one dependent per policyholder, thus bringing the number of \npolicyholders and dependents back up to 3,300.  Many of those dependents are likely not to be \nwomen of childbearing age, but in order to provide an upper bound to this estimate, we assume \nthey are.  Therefore, for the purposes of this estimate, we assume that the effect of these \nexpanded exemptions on student plans of litigating entities includes 3,300 women.  Assuming \n                                                           \n74 United States Census Bureau, “Age and Sex Composition: 2010” (May 2011), available at \nhttps://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf. The Guidelines’ requirement of contraceptive \ncoverage only applies “for all women with reproductive capacity.” https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/; also, \nsee 80 FR 40318.  In addition, studies commonly consider the 15–44 age range to assess contraceptive use by \nwomen of childbearing age.  See, for example, Guttmacher Institute, “Contraceptive Use in the United States” (Sept. \n2016), available at https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. \n75 See https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states (reporting that of 60,877,000 women \naged 15-44, 26,945,000 use women’s contraceptive methods covered by the Guidelines). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 103 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     102  \n \nthat 44.3 perecent of such women use contraception covered by the Guidelines,76 we estimate \nthat 1,462 of those women would be affected by these rules. \nTogether, this leads the Departments to estimate that approximately 8,700 women of \nchildbearing age may have their contraception costs affected by plans of litigating entities using \nthese expanded exemptions.  As noted above, the Departments do not have data indicating how \nmany of those women agree with their employers’ or educational institutions’ opposition to \ncontraception (so that fewer of them than the national average might actually use contraception).  \nNor do we know how many would have alternative contraceptive access from a parent’s or \nspouse’s plan, or from Federal, State, or local governmental programs, nor how many of those \nwomen would fall in the category of being most at risk of unintended pregnancy, nor how many \nof those entities would provide some contraception in their plans while only objecting to certain \ncontraceptives. \nSixth, in a brief filed in the Zubik litigation, the Departments stated that “in 2014, [HHS] \nprovided user-fee reductions to compensate TPAs for making contraceptive coverage available \nto more than 600,000 employees and beneficiaries,” and that “[t]hat figure includes both men \nand women covered under the relevant plans.”77  HHS has reviewed the information giving rise \nto that estimate, and has received updated information for 2015.  In 2014, 612,000 persons were \ncovered by plans claiming contraceptive user fees adjustments, and in 2015, 576,000 persons \nwere covered by such plans.  These numbers include all persons in such plans, not just women of \nchildbearing age.  \n                                                           \n76 It would appear that a smaller percentage of college-aged women use contraception—and use more expensive \nmethods such as long acting methods or sterilization—than among other women of childbearing age. See NCHS \nData Brief, “Current Contraceptive Status Among Women Aged 15-44: United States, 2011-2013” (Dec. 2014), \navailable at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db173.pdf. \n77 Brief of Respondents at 18–19 & n.7, Zubik v. Burwell, No. 14-1418, et al. (U.S. filed Feb. 10, 2016).  The actual \nnumber is 612,487. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 104 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     103  \n \nHHS’s information indicates that religious nonprofit hospitals or health systems \nsponsored a significant minority of the accommodated self-insured plans that were using \ncontraceptive user fees adjustments, yet those plans covered more than 80 percent of the persons \ncovered in all plans using contraceptive user fees adjustments.  Some of those plans cover nearly \n100,000 persons each, and several others cover approximately 40,000 persons each.  In other \nwords, these plans were proportionately much larger than the plans provided by other entities \nusing the contraceptive user fees adjustments.  \nThere are two reasons to believe that a significant fraction of the persons covered by \npreviously accommodated plans provided by religious nonprofit hospitals or health systems may \nnot be affected by the expanded exemption.  A broad range of religious hospitals or health \nsystems have publicly indicated that they do not conscientiously oppose participating in the \naccommodation.78  Of course, some of these religious hospitals or health systems may opt for the \nexpanded exemption under these interim final rules, but others might not. In addition, among \nplans of religious nonprofit hospitals or health systems, some have indicated that they might be \neligible for status as a self-insured church plan.79  As discussed above, some litigants challenging \nthe Mandate have appeared, after their complaints were filed, to make use of self-insured church \nplan status.80  (The Departments take no view on the status of these particular plans under \n                                                           \n78  See, for example, https://www.chausa.org/newsroom/women%27s-preventive-health-services-final-rule (“HHS \nhas now established an accommodation that will allow our ministries to continue offering health insurance plans for \ntheir employees as they have always done….  We are pleased that our members now have an accommodation that \nwill not require them to contract, provide, pay or refer for contraceptive coverage….  We will work with our \nmembers to implement this accommodation.”) In comments submitted in previous rules concerning this Mandate, \nthe Catholic Health Association has stated it “is the national leadership organization for the Catholic health ministry, \nconsisting of more than 2,000 Catholic health care sponsors, systems, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and related \norganizations.  Our ministry is represented in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.”  Comments on CMS-9968-\nANPRM (dated June 15, 2012).  \n79  See, for example, Brief of the Catholic Health Association of the United States as Amicus Curiae in Support of \nPetitioners, Advocate Health Care Network, Nos. 16-74, 16-86, 16-258, 2017 WL 371934 at *1 (U.S. filed Jan. 24, \n2017) (“CHA members have relied for decades that the ‘church plan’ exemption contained in” ERISA.). \n80  See supra note 66. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 105 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     104  \n \nERISA, but simply make this observation for the purpose of seeking to estimate the impact of \nthese interim final rules.)  Nevertheless, overall it seems likely that many of the remaining \nreligious hospital or health systems plans previously using the accommodation will continue to \nopt into the voluntary accommodation under these interim final rules, under which their \nemployees will still receive contraceptive coverage.  To the extent that plans of religious \nhospitals or health systems are able to make use of self-insured church plan status, the previous \naccommodation rule would already have allowed them to relieve themselves and their third party \nadministrators of obligations to provide contraceptive coverage or payments.  Therefore, in such \nsituations these interim final rules would not have an anticipated effect on the contraceptive \ncoverage of women in those plans.  \nConsidering all these data points and limitations, the Departments offer the following \nestimate of the number of women who will be impacted by the expanded exemption in these \ninterim final rules.  The Departments begin with the 8,700 women of childbearing age that use \ncontraception who we estimate will be affected by use of the expanded exemption among \nlitigating entities.  In addition to that number, we calculate the following number of women \naffected by accommodated entities using the expanded exemption.  As noted above, \napproximately 576,000 plan participants and beneficiaries were covered by self-insured plans \nthat received contraceptive user fee adjustments in 2014.  Although additional self-insured \nentities may have participated in the accommodation without making use of contraceptive user \nfees adjustments, we do not know what number of entities did so.  We consider it likely that self-\ninsured entities with relatively larger numbers of covered persons had sufficient financial \nincentive to make use of the contraceptive user fees adjustments.  Therefore, without better data \navailable, we assume that the number of persons covered by self-insured plans using \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 106 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     105  \n \ncontraceptive user fees adjustments approximates the number of persons covered by all self-\ninsured plans using the accommodation. \nAn additional but unknown number of persons were likely covered in fully insured plans \nusing the accommodation.  The Departments do not have data on how many fully insured plans \nhave been using the accommodation, nor on how many persons were covered by those plans. \nDOL estimates that, among persons covered by employer sponsored insurance, 56.1 percent are \ncovered by self-insured plans and 43.9 percent are covered by fully insured plans.81  Therefore, \ncorresponding to the 576,000 persons covered by self-insured plans using user fee adjustments, \nwe estimate an additional 451,000 persons were covered by fully insured plans using the \naccommodation.  This yields an estimate of 1,027,000 covered persons of all ages and sexes in \nplans using the previous accommodation.  \nAs discussed below, and recognizing the limited data available for our estimates, the \nDepartments estimate that 100 of the 209 entities that were using the accommodation under the \nprior rule will continue to opt into it under these interim final rules.  Notably, however, the data \nconcerning accommodated self-insured plans indicates that plans sponsored by religious \nhospitals and health systems encompass more than 80 percent of the persons covered in such \nplans.  In other words, plans sponsored by such entities have a proportionately larger number of \ncovered persons than do plans sponsored by other accommodated entities, which have smaller \nnumbers of covered persons.  As also cited above, many religious hospitals and health systems \nhave indicated that they do not object to the accommodation, and some of those entities might \nalso qualify as self-insured church plans, so that these interim final rules would not impact the \n                                                           \n81 “Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin” Table 3A, page 15.

We do not have specific data on which plans of \nwhich sizes will actually continue to opt into the accommodation, nor how many will make use \nof self-insured church plan status.  We assume that the proportions of covered persons in self-\ninsured plans using contraceptive user fees adjustments also apply in fully insured plans, for \nwhich we lack representative data.  Based on these assumptions and without better data \navailable, we assume that the 100 accommodated entities that will remain in the accommodation \nwill account for 75 percent of all the persons previously covered in accommodated plans.  In \ncomparison, we assume the 109 accommodated entities that will make use of the expanded \nexemption will encompass 25 percent of persons previously covered in accommodated plans.  \nApplying these percentages to the total number of 1,027,000 persons we estimate are \ncovered in accommodated plans, we estimate that approximately 257,000 persons previously \ncovered in accommodated plans will be covered in the 109 plans that use the expanded \nexemption, and 770,000 persons will be covered in the estimated 100 plans that continue to use \nthe accommodation.  According to the Census data cited above, 20.2 percent of these persons are \nwomen of childbearing age, which amounts to approximately 51,900 women of childbearing age \nin previously accommodated plans that we estimate will use the expanded exemption.  As noted \nabove, approximately 44.3 percent of women of childbearing age use women’s contraceptive \nmethods covered by the Guidelines, so that we expect approximately 23,000 women that use \ncontraception covered by the Guidelines to be affected by accommodated entities using the \nexpanded exemption. \nIt is not clear the extent to which this number overlaps with the number estimated above \nof 8,700 women in plans of litigating entities that may be affected by these rules.  Based on our \nlimited information from the litigation and accommodation notices, we expect that the overlap is \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 108 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     107  \n \nsignificant.  Nevertheless, in order to estimate the possible effects of these rules, we assume there \nis no overlap between these two numbers, and therefore that these interim final rules would \naffect the contraceptive costs of approximately 31,700 women.   \nUnder the assumptions just discussed, the number of women whose contraceptive costs \nwill be impacted by the expanded exemption in these interim final rules is less than 0.1 percent \nof the 55.6 million women in private plans that HHS ASPE estimated82 receive preventive \nservices coverage under the Guidelines.  \nIn order to estimate the cost of contraception to women affected by the expanded \nexemption, the Departments are aware that, under the prior accommodation process, the total \nuser fee adjustment amount for self-insured plans for the 2015 benefit year was $33 million. \nThese adjustments covered the cost of contraceptive coverage provided to women participants \nand beneficiaries in self-insured plans where the employer objected and made use of the \naccommodation, and where an authorizing exception under OMB Circular No. A-25R was in \neffect as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services requests.  Nine percent \nof that amount was attributable to administrative costs and margin, according to the provisions of \n45 CFR 156.50(d)(3)(ii).  Thus the amount of the adjustments attributable to the cost of \ncontraceptive services was about $30 million.  As discussed above, in 2015 that amount \ncorresponded to 576,000 persons covered by such plans.  Among those persons, as cited above, \napproximately 20.2 percent on average were women of childbearing age—that is, approximately \n116,000 women. As noted above, approximately 44.3 percent of women of childbearing age use \nwomen’s contraceptive methods covered by the Guidelines, which includes 51,400 women in \n                                                           \n82 Available at https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/affordable-care-act-improving-access-preventive-services-millions-\namericans; also, see Abridged Report, available at https://www.womenspreventivehealth.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/01/WPSI_2016AbridgedReport.pdf. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 109 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     108  \n \nthose plans.  Therefore, entities using contraceptive user fees adjustments received \napproximately $584 per year per woman of childbearing age that use contraception covered by \nthe Guidelines and are covered in their plans.  \nAs discussed above, the Departments estimate that the expanded exemptions will impact \nthe contraceptive costs of approximately 31,700 women of childbearing age that use \ncontraception covered by the Guidelines.  At an average of $584 per year, the financial transfer \neffects attributable to the interim final rules on those women would be approximately $18.5 \nmillion.83,84  \nTo account for uncertainty in the estimate, we conducted a second analysis using an \nalternative framework, in order to thoroughly consider the possible upper bound economic \nimpact of these interim final rules. \nAs noted above, the HHS ASPE report estimated that 55.6 million women aged 15 to 64 \nand covered by private insurance had preventive services coverage under the Affordable Care \nAct.  Approximately 16.2 percent of those women were enrolled in plans on exchanges or were \notherwise not covered by employer sponsored insurance, so only 46.6 million women aged 15 to \n64 received the coverage through employer sponsored private insurance plans.85  In addition, \n                                                           \n83 As noted above, the Departments have taken the position that providing contraceptive coverage is cost neutral to \nissuers. (78 FR 39877). At the same time, because of the up-front costs of some contraceptive or sterilization \nmethods, and because some entities did not cover contraception prior to the Affordable Care Act, premiums may be \nexpected to adjust to reflect changes in coverage, thus partially offsetting the transfer experienced by women who \nuse the affected contraceptives.  As discussed elsewhere in this analysis, such women may make up approximately \n8.9 percent (= 20.2 percent x 44.3 percent) of the covered population, in which case the offset would also be \napproximately 8.9 percent. \n84 Describing this impact as a transfer reflects an implicit assumption that the same products and services would be \nused with or without the rule.  Such an assumption is somewhat oversimplified because the interim final rules shift \ncost burden to consumption decision-makers (that is, the women who choose whether or not to use the relevant \ncontraceptives) and thus can be expected to lead to some decrease in use of the affected drugs and devices and a \npotential increase in pregnancy—thus leading to a decrease and an increase, respectively, in medical expenditures. \n85 Available at \nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/139221/The%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20is%20Improving%20Access\n%20to%20Preventive%20Services%20for%20Millions%20of%20Americans.pdf  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 110 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     109  \n \nsome of those private insurance plans were offered by government employers, encompassing \napproximately 10.5 million of those women aged 15 to 64.86  The expanded exemption in these \ninterim final rules does not apply to government plan sponsors. Thus we estimate that the \nnumber of women aged 15 to 64 covered by private sector employer sponsored insurance who \nreceive preventive services coverage under the Affordable Care Act is approximately 36 million. \nPrior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, approximately 6 percent of \nemployer survey respondents did not offer contraceptive coverage, with 31 percent of \nrespondents not knowing whether they offered such coverage.87  The 6 percent may have \nincluded approximately 2.16 million of the women aged 15–64 covered by employer sponsored \ninsurance plans in the private sector.  According to Census data, 59.9 percent of women aged 15 \nto 64 are of childbearing age (aged 15 to 44), in this case, 1.3 million.  And as noted above, \napproximately 44.3 percent of women of childbearing age use women’s contraceptive methods \n                                                           \n86 The ASPE study relied on Census data of private health insurance plans, which included plans sponsored by either \nprivate or public sector employers.  See Table 2, notes 2 & 3 (explaining the scope of private plans and government \nplans for purposes of Table 2), available at \nhttps://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-250.pdf.  \nAccording to data tables from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) of the Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality of HHS (https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/), State and local governments employ 19,297,960 \npersons; 99.2 percent of those employers offer health insurance; and 67.4 percent of employees that work at such \nentities where insurance is offered are enrolled in those plans, amounting to 12.9 million persons enrolled. DOL \nestimates that in the public sector, for each policyholder there is an average of slightly less than one dependent. \n“Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin” Table 4, page 21. \nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/researchers/data/health-and-welfare/health-insurance-coverage-bulletin-\n2015.pdf.  Therefore, State and local government employer plans cover approximately 24.8 million persons of all \nages. Census data indicates that on average, 12 percent of persons covered by private insurance plans are aged 65 \nand older. Using these numbers, we estimate that State and local government employer plans cover approximately \n21.9 million persons under age 65. \nThe Federal Government has approximately 8.2 million persons covered in its employee health plans. \nAccording to information we received from the Office of Personnel Management, this includes 2.1 million \nemployees having 3.2 million dependents, and 1.9 million retirees (annuitants) having 1 million dependents. We do \nnot have information about the ages of these policyholders and dependents, but for the purposes of this estimate we \nassume the annuitants and their dependents are aged 65 or older and the employees and their dependents are under \nage 65, so that the Federal Government’s employee health plans cover 5.3 million persons under age 65.  \nThus, overall we estimate there are 27.2 million persons under age 65 enrolled in private health insurance \nsponsored by government employers. Of those, 38.3 percent are women aged 15-64, that is, 10.5 million.   \n87 Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits, 2010 Annual \nSurvey” at 196, available at https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/8085.pdf. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 111 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     110  \n \ncovered by the Guidelines. Therefore we estimate that 574,000 women of childbearing age that \nuse contraceptives covered by the Guidelines were covered by plans that omitted contraceptive \ncoverage prior to the Affordable Care Act.88 \nIt is unknown what motivated those employers to omit contraceptive coverage—whether \nthey did so for conscientious reasons, or for other reasons.  Despite our lack of information about \ntheir motives, we attempt to make a reasonable estimate of the upper bound of the number of \nthose employers that omitted contraception before the Affordable Care Act and that would make \nuse of these expanded exemptions based on sincerely held religious beliefs.  \nTo begin, we estimate that publicly traded companies would not likely make use of these \nexpanded exemptions.  Even though the rule does not preclude publicly traded companies from \ndropping coverage based on a sincerely held religious belief, it is likely that attempts to object on \nreligious grounds by publicly traded companies would be rare.  The Departments take note of the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Hobby Lobby, where the Court observed that “HHS has not pointed \nto any example of a publicly traded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous practical \nrestraints would likely prevent that from occurring.  For example, the idea that unrelated \nshareholders—including institutional investors with their own set of stakeholders—would agree \nto run a corporation under the same religious beliefs seems improbable”.  134 S. Ct. at 2774.  \n                                                           \n88 Some of the 31 percent of survey respondents that did not know about contraceptive coverage may not have \noffered such coverage.  If it were possible to account for this non-coverage, the estimate of potentially affected \ncovered women could increase. On the other hand, these employers’ lack of knowledge about contraceptive \ncoverage suggests that they lacked sincerely held religious beliefs specifically objecting to such coverage—beliefs \nwithout which they would not qualify for the expanded exemptions offered by these rules. In that case, omission of \nsuch employers and covered women from this estimation approach would be appropriate. Correspondingly, the 6 \npercent of employers that had direct knowledge about the absence of coverage may be more likely to have omitted \nsuch coverage on the basis of religious beliefs than were the 31 percent of survey respondents who did not know \nwhether the coverage was offered.  Yet an entity’s mere knowledge about its coverage status does not itself reflect \nits motive for omitting coverage.  In responding to the survey, the entity may have simply examined its plan \ndocument to determine whether or not contraceptive coverage was offered.  As will be relevant in a later portion of \nthe analysis, we have no data indicating what portion of the entities that omitted contraceptive coverage pre-\nAffordable Care Act did so on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs, as opposed to doing so for other reasons \nthat would not qualify them for the expanded exemption offered in these interim final rules.   \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 112 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     111  \n \nThe Departments are aware of several Federal health care conscience laws89 that in some cases \nhave existed for decades and that protect companies, including publicly traded companies, from \ndiscrimination if, for example, they decline to facilitate abortion, but we are not aware of \nexamples where publicly traded companies have made use of these exemptions.  Thus, while we \nconsider it important to include publicly traded companies in the scope of these expanded \nexemptions for reasons similar to those used by the Congress in RFRA and some health care \nconscience laws, in estimating the anticipated effects of the expanded exemptions we agree with \nthe Supreme Court that it is improbable any will do so.   \nThis assumption is significant because 31.3 percent of employees in the private sector \nwork for publicly traded companies.90  That means that only approximately 394,000 women aged \n15 to 44 that use contraceptives covered by the Guidelines were covered by plans of non-\npublicly traded companies that did not provide contraceptive coverage pre-Affordable Care Act.   \nMoreover, these interim final rules build on existing rules that already exempt houses of \nworship and integrated auxiliaries and, as explained above, effectively remove obligations to \nprovide contraceptive coverage within objecting self-insured church plans.  These rules will \ntherefore not effect transfers to women in the plans of such employers.  In attempting to estimate \nthe number of such employers, we consider the following information.  Many Catholic dioceses \nhave litigated or filed public comments opposing the Mandate, representing to the Departments \nand to courts around the country that official Catholic Church teaching opposes contraception. \n                                                           \n89 For example, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b), 42 U.S.C. 238n, and Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div.

Among self-insured church plans that oppose the Mandate, the \nDepartment has been sued by two—Guidestone and Christian Brothers.  Guidestone is a plan \norganized by the Southern Baptist convention. It covers 38,000 employers, some of which are \nexempt as churches or integrated auxiliaries, and some of which are not.94 Christian Brothers is a \nplan that covers Catholic organizations.  It covers Catholic churches and integrated auxiliaries, \nwhich are estimated above, but also it has said in litigation that it also covers about 500 \nadditional entities that are not exempt as churches.  In total, therefore, we estimate that \napproximately 62,000 employers among houses of worship, integrated auxiliaries, and church \nplans, were exempt or relieved of contraceptive coverage obligations under the previous rules. \nWe do not know how many persons are covered in the plans of those employers.  Guidestone \nreports that among its 38,000 employers, its plan covers approximately 220,000 persons, and its \nemployers include “churches, mission-sending agencies, hospitals, educational institutions and \nother related ministries.”  Using that ratio, we estimate that the 62,000 church and church plan \nemployers among Guidestone, Christian Brothers, and Catholic churches would include 359,000 \npersons. Among them, as referenced above, 72,500 would be of childbearing age, and 32,100 \n                                                           \n91 Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno, “Diocese of Reno Directory: 2016-2017,” available at \nhttp://www.renodiocese.org/documents/2016/9/2016%202017%20directory.pdf.   \n92 Wikipedia, “List of Catholic dioceses in the United States,” available at \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_dioceses_in_the_United_States. \n93 National Catholic Educational Association, “Catholic School Data,” available at \nhttp://www.ncea.org/NCEA/Proclaim/Catholic_School_Data/Catholic_School_Data.aspx. \n94 Guidestone Financial Resources, “Who We Serve,” available at \nhttps://www.guidestone.org/AboutUs/WhoWeServe. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 114 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     113  \n \nwould use contraceptives covered by the Guidelines.  Therefore, we estimate that the private, \nnon-publicly traded employers that did not cover contraception pre-Affordable Care Act, and \nthat were not exempt by the previous rules nor were participants in self-insured church plans that \noppose contraceptive coverage, covered 362,100 women aged 15 to 44 that use contraceptives \ncovered by the Guidelines.  As noted above, we estimate an average annual expenditure on \ncontraceptive products and services of $584 per user.  That would amount to $211.5 million in \npotential transfer impact among entities that did not cover contraception pre- Affordable Care \nAct for any reason.   \nWe do not have data indicating how many of the entities that omitted coverage of \ncontraception pre- Affordable Care Act did so on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs that \nmight qualify them for exempt status under these interim final rules, as opposed to having done \nso for other reasons.  Besides the entities that filed lawsuits or submitted public comments \nconcerning previous rules on this matter, we are not aware of entities that omitted contraception \npre-Affordable Care Act and then opposed the contraceptive coverage requirement after it was \nimposed by the Guidelines.  For the following reasons, however, we believe that a reasonable \nestimate is that no more than approximately one third of the persons covered by relevant \nentities—that is, no more than approximately 120,000 affected women—would likely be subject \nto potential transfer impacts under the expanded religious exemptions offered in these interim \nfinal rules.  Consequently, as explained below, we believe that the potential impact of these \ninterim final rules falls substantially below the $100 million threshold for economically \nsignificant and major rules. \nFirst, as mentioned, we are not aware of information that would lead us to estimate that \nall or most entities that omitted coverage of contraception pre-Affordable Care Act did so on the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 115 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     114  \n \nbasis of sincerely held conscientious objections in general or religious beliefs specifically, as \nopposed to having done so for other reasons.  Moreover, as suggested by the Guidestone data \nmentioned previously, employers with conscientious objections may tend to have relatively few \nemployees.  Also, avoiding negative publicity, the difficulty of taking away a fringe benefit that \nemployees have become accustomed to having, and avoiding the administrative cost of \nrenegotiating insurance contracts, all provide reasons for some employers not to return to pre-\nAffordable Care Act lack of contraceptive coverage.  Additionally, as discussed above, many \nemployers with objections to contraception, including several of the largest litigants, only object \nto some contraceptives and cover as many as 14 of 18 of the contraceptive methods included in \nthe Guidelines.  This will reduce, and potentially eliminate, the contraceptive cost transfer for \nwomen covered in their plans.95  Furthermore, among nonprofit entities that object to the \nMandate, it is possible that a greater share of their employees oppose contraception than among \nthe general population, which should lead to a reduction in the estimate of how many women in \nthose plans actually use contraception.  \nIn addition, not all sincerely held conscientious objections to contraceptive coverage are \nlikely to be held by persons with religious beliefs as distinct from persons with sincerely held \nnon-religious moral convictions, whose objections would not be encompassed by these interim \nfinal rules.96  We do not have data to indicate, among entities that did not cover contraception \n                                                           \n95 On the other hand, a key input in the approach that generated the one third threshold estimate was a survey \nindicating that six percent of employers did not provide contraceptive coverage pre-Affordable Care Act.  \nEmployers that covered some contraceptives pre-Affordable Care Act may have answered “yes” or “don’t know” to \nthe survey.  In such cases, the potential transfer estimate has a tendency toward underestimation because the rule’s \neffects on such women—causing their contraceptive coverage to be reduced from all 18 methods to some smaller \nsubset—have been omitted from the calculation. \n96 Such objections may be encompassed by companion interim final rules published elsewhere in this Federal \nRegister.  Those rules, however, as an interim final matter, are more narrow in scope than these rules.  For example, \nin providing expanded exemptions for plan sponsors, they do not encompass companies with certain publicly traded \nownership interests. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 116 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     115  \n \npre-Affordable Care Act based on sincerely held conscientious objections as opposed to other \nreasons, which ones did so based on religious beliefs and which ones did so instead based on \nnon-religious moral convictions.  Among the general public, polls vary about religious beliefs \nbut one prominent poll shows that 89 percent of Americans say they believe in God, while 11 \npercent say they do not or are agnostic.97  Therefore, we estimate that for every ten entities that \nomitted contraception pre-Affordable Care Act based on sincerely held conscientious objections \nas opposed to other reasons, one did so based on sincerely held non-religious moral convictions, \nand therefore are not affected by the expanded exemption provided by these interim final rules \nfor religious beliefs.  \nBased on our estimate of an average annual expenditure on contraceptive products and \nservices of $584 per user, the effect of the expanded exemptions on 120,000 women would give \nrise to approximately $70.1 million in potential transfer impact.  This falls substantially below \nthe $100 million threshold for economically significant and major rules.  In addition, as noted \nabove, premiums may be expected to adjust to reflect changes in coverage, thus partially \noffsetting the transfer experienced by women who use the affected contraceptives.  As discussed \nelsewhere in this analysis, such women may make up approximately 8.9 percent (= 20.2 percent \nx 44.3 percent) of the covered population, in which case the offset would also be approximately \n8.9 percent, yielding a potential transfer of $63.8 million.   \nWe request comment on all aspects of the preceding regulatory impact analysis, as well \nas on how to attribute impacts to this interim final rule and the companion interim final rule \nconcerning exemptions provided based on sincerely held (non-religious) moral convictions \npublished elsewhere in this Federal Register. \n                                                           \n97 Gallup, “Most Americans Still Believe in God” (June 14–23, 2016), available at \nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/193271/americans-believe-god.aspx.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 117 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     116  \n \nB.  Special Analyses—Department of the Treasury \nFor purposes of the Department of the Treasury, certain Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nregulations, including this one, are exempt from the requirements in Executive Order 12866, as \nsupplemented by Executive Order 13563.  The Departments anticipate that there will be more \nentities reluctantly using the existing accommodation that will choose to operate under the newly \nexpanded exemption, than entities that are not currently eligible to use the accommodation that \nwill opt into it.  The effect of this rule will therefore be that fewer overall adjustments are made \nto the Federally facilitated Exchange user fees for entities using the accommodation process, as \nlong as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services requests and an \nauthorizing exception under OMB Circular No. A-25R is in effect, than would have occurred \nunder the previous rule if this rule were not finalized. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not \nrequired.  \nC.  Regulatory Flexibility Act \nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (RFA) imposes certain \nrequirements with respect to Federal rules that are subject to the notice and comment \nrequirements of section 553(b) of the APA (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and that are likely to have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  Under Section 553(b) of \nthe APA, a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required when an agency, for good \ncause, finds that notice and public comment thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary \nto the public interest.  The interim final rules are exempt from the APA, both because the PHS \nAct, ERISA, and the Code contain specific provisions under which the Secretaries may adopt \nregulations by interim final rule and because the Departments have made a good cause finding \nthat a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary earlier in this preamble.  Therefore, \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 118 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     117  \n \nthe RFA does not apply and the Departments are not required to either certify that the regulations \nor this amendment would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities or conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis. \nNevertheless, the Departments carefully considered the likely impact of the rule on small \nentities in connection with their assessment under Executive Order 12866.  The Departments do \nnot expect that these interim final rules will have a significant economic effect on a substantial \nnumber of small entities, because they will not result in any additional costs to affected entities, \nand in many cases will relieve burdens and costs from such entities.  By exempting from the \nMandate small businesses and nonprofit organizations with religious objections to some (or all) \ncontraceptives and/or sterilization, the Departments have reduced regulatory burden on such \nsmall entities.  Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, these regulations have been submitted to \nthe Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their \nimpact on small business.  \nD.  Paperwork Reduction Act—Department of Health and Human Services  \nUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA), Federal agencies are required to \npublish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information.  \nInterested persons are invited to send comments regarding our burden estimates or any other \naspect of this collection of information, including any of the following subjects:  (1) the necessity \nand utility of the proposed information collection for the proper performance of the agency's \nfunctions; (2) the accuracy of the estimated burden; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and \nclarity of the information to be collected; and (4) the use of automated collection techniques or \nother forms of information technology to minimize the information collection burden.    \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 119 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     118  \n \nHowever, we are requesting an emergency review of the information collection \nreferenced later in this section.  In compliance with the requirement of section 3506(c)(2)(A) of \nthe PRA, we have submitted the following for emergency review to the Office of Management \nand Budget (OMB).  We are requesting an emergency review and approval under both \n5 CFR 1320.13(a)(2)(i) and (iii) of the implementing regulations of the PRA in order to \nimplement provisions regarding self-certification or notices to HHS from eligible organizations \n(§147.131(c)(3)), notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services \n(§147.131(f)), and notice of revocation of accommodation (§147.131(c)(4)).  In accordance with \n5 CFR 1320.13(a)(2)(i), we believe public harm is reasonably likely to ensue if the normal \nclearance procedures are followed.  The use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely \nto prevent or disrupt the collection of information.  Similarly, in accordance with 5 CFR \n1320.13(a)(2)(iii), we believe the use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely to \ncause a statutory or court ordered deadline to be missed.  Many cases have been on remand for \nover a year from the Supreme Court, asking the Departments and the parties to resolve this \nmatter.  These interim final rules extend exemptions to entities, which involves no collection of \ninformation and which the Departments have statutory authority to do by the use of interim final \nrules.  If the information collection involved in the amended accommodation process is not \napproved on an emergency basis, newly exempt entities that wish to opt into the amended \naccommodation process might not be able to do so until normal clearance procedures are \ncompleted. \nA description of the information collection provisions implicated in these interim final \nrules is given in the following section with an estimate of the annual burden.  Average labor \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 120 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     119  \n \ncosts (including 100 percent fringe benefits) used to estimate the costs are calculated using data \navailable from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.98  \na. ICRs Regarding Self-Certification or Notices to HHS (§147.131(c)(3)) \nEach organization seeking to be treated as an eligible organization that wishes to use the \noptional accommodation process offered under these interim final rules must either use the \nEBSA Form 700 method of self-certification or provide notice to HHS of its religious objection \nto coverage of all or a subset of contraceptive services.  Specifically, these interim final rules \ncontinue to allow eligible organizations to notify an issuer or third party administrator using \nEBSA Form 700, or to notify HHS, of their religious objection to coverage of all or a subset of \ncontraceptive services, as set forth in the July 2015 final regulations.  The burden related to the \nnotice to HHS is currently approved under OMB Control Number 0938-1248 and the burden \nrelated to the self-certification (EBSA Form 700) is currently approved under OMB control \nnumber 0938-1292.  \nNotably, however, entities that are participating in the previous accommodation process, \nwhere a self-certification or notice has already been submitted, and where the entities choose to \ncontinue their accommodated status under these interim final rules, generally do not need to file \na new self-certification or notice (unless they change their issuer or third party administrator).  \nAs explained above, HHS assumes that, among the 209 entities we estimated are using the \nprevious accommodation, 109 will use the expanded exemption and 100 will continue under the \nvoluntary accommodation.  Those 100 entities will not need to file additional self-certifications \nor notices.  HHS also assumes that an additional 9 entities that were not using the previous \n                                                           \n98 May 2016 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates United States found at \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 121 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     120  \n \naccommodation will opt into it.  Those entities will be subject to the self-certification or notice \nrequirement. \nIn order to estimate the cost for an entity that chooses to opt into the accommodation \nprocess, HHS assumes, as it did in its August 2014 interim final rules, that clerical staff for each \neligible organization will gather and enter the necessary information and send the self-\ncertification to the issuer or third party administrator as appropriate, or send the notice to HHS.99  \nHHS assumes that a compensation and benefits manager and inside legal counsel will review the \nself-certification or notice to HHS and a senior executive would execute it.  HHS estimates that \nan eligible organization would spend approximately 50 minutes (30 minutes of clerical labor at a \ncost of $55.68 per hour,100 10 minutes for a compensation and benefits manager at a cost of \n$122.02 per hour,101 5 minutes for legal counsel at a cost of $134.50 per hour,102 and 5 minutes \nby a senior executive at a cost of $186.88 per hour103) preparing and sending the self-certification \nor notice to HHS and filing it to meet the recordkeeping requirement.  Therefore, the total annual \nburden for preparing and providing the information in the self-certification or notice to HHS will \nrequire approximately 50 minutes for each eligible organization with an equivalent cost burden \nof approximately $74.96 for a total hour burden of approximately 7.5 hours with an equivalent \ncost of approximately $675 for 9 entities. As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are splitting \n                                                           \n99 For purposes of this analysis, the Department assumes that the same amount of time will be required to prepare \nthe self-certification and the notice to HHS. \n100 Occupation code 43-6011 for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants with mean hourly \nwage $27.84, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes436011.htm \n101 Occupation code 11-3111 for Compensation and Benefits Managers with mean hourly wage $61.01, \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes113111.htm \n102 Occupation code 23-1011 for Lawyers with mean hourly wage $67.25, \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm \n103 Occupation code11-1011 for Chief Executives with mean hourly wage $93.44, \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes111011.htm \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 122 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     121  \n \nthe hour burden so each will account for approximately 3.75 burden hours with an equivalent \ncost of approximately $337.  \nHHS estimates that each self-certification or notice to HHS will require $0.49 in postage \nand $0.05 in materials cost (paper and ink) and the total postage and materials cost for each self-\ncertification or notice sent via mail will be $0.54.  For purposes of this analysis, HHS assumes \nthat 50 percent of self-certifications or notices to HHS will be mailed.  The total cost for sending \nthe self-certifications or notices to HHS by mail is approximately $2.70 for 5 entities.  As DOL \nand HHS share jurisdiction they are splitting the cost burden so each will account for $1.35 of \nthe cost burden. \nb. ICRs Regarding Notice of Availability of Separate Payments for Contraceptive Services \n(§147.131(e)) \nAs required by the July 2015 final regulations, a health insurance issuer or third party \nadministrator providing or arranging separate payments for contraceptive services for \nparticipants and beneficiaries in insured or self-insured group health plans (or student enrollees \nand covered dependents in student health insurance coverage) of eligible organizations is \nrequired to provide a written notice to plan participants and beneficiaries (or student enrollees \nand covered dependents) informing them of the availability of such payments.  The notice must \nbe separate from, but contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), any application materials \ndistributed in connection with enrollment (or re-enrollment) in group or student coverage of the \neligible organization in any plan year to which the accommodation is to apply and will be \nprovided annually.  To satisfy the notice requirement, issuers and third party administrators may, \nbut are not required to, use the model language set forth previously by HHS or substantially \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 123 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     122  \n \nsimilar language.  The burden for this ICR is currently approved under OMB control number \n0938-1292. \nAs mentioned, HHS is anticipating that approximately 109 entities will use the optional \naccommodation (100 that used it previously, and 9 that will newly opt into it).  It is unknown \nhow many issuers or third party administrators provide health insurance coverage or services in \nconnection with health plans of eligible organizations, but HHS will assume at least 109.  It is \nestimated that each issuer or third party administrator will need  approximately 1 hour of clerical \nlabor (at $55.68 per hour)104 and 15 minutes of management review (at $117.40 per hour)105 to \nprepare the notices.  The total burden for each issuer or third party administrator to prepare \nnotices will be 1.25 hours with an equivalent cost of approximately $85.03.  The total burden for \nall issuers or third party administrators will be 136 hours, with an equivalent cost of $9,268.  As \nDOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are splitting the hour burden so each will account for 68 \nburden hours with an equivalent cost of $4,634, with approximately 55 respondents. \nAs discussed above, the Departments estimate that 770,000 persons will be covered in the \nplans of the 100 entities that previously used the accommodation and will continue doing so, and \nthat an additional 9 entities will newly opt into the accommodation.  It is not known how many \npersons will be covered in the plans of the 9 entities newly using the accommodation.  Assuming \nthat those 9 entities will have a similar number of covered persons per entity, we estimate that all \n109 accommodated entities will encompass 839,300 covered persons.  We assume that sending \none notice to each participant will satisfy the need to send the notices to all participants and \ndependents. Among persons covered by plans, approximately 50.1 percent are participants and \n                                                           \n104 Occupation code 43-6011 for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants with mean hourly \nwage $27.84. \n105 Occupation code 11-1021 General and Operations Managers with mean hourly wage $58.70. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 124 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     123  \n \n49.9 percent are dependents.106  For 109 entities, the total number of notices will be 420,490.  \nFor purposes of this analysis, the Departments also assume that 53.7 percent of notices will be \nsent electronically, and 46.3 percent will be mailed.107  Therefore, approximately 194,687 notices \nwill be mailed.  HHS estimates that each notice will require $0.49 in postage and $0.05 in \nmaterials cost (paper and ink) and the total postage and materials cost for each notice sent via \nmail will be $0.54.  The total cost for sending approximately 194,687 notices by mail is \napproximately $105,131.  As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are splitting the cost burden \nso each will account for $52,565 of the cost burden. \nc. ICRs Regarding Notice of Revocation of Accommodation (§147.131(c)(4)) \nAn eligible organization may revoke its use of the accommodation process; its issuer or \nthird party administrator must provide written notice of such revocation to participants and \nbeneficiaries as soon as practicable.  As discussed above, HHS estimates that 109 entities that are \nusing the accommodation process will revoke their use of the accommodation, and will therefore \nbe required to cause the notification to be sent (the issuer or third party administrator can send \nthe notice on behalf of the entity).  For the purpose of calculating ICRs associated with \nrevocations of the accommodation, and for various reasons discussed above, HHS assumes that \n                                                           \n106 “Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin” Table 4, page 21.  Using March 2015 Annual Social and Economic \nSupplement to the Current Population Survey.  https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/researchers/data/health-\nand-welfare/health-insurance-coverage-bulletin-2015.pdf.  \n107 According to data from the National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA), 36.0 percent of \nindividuals age 25 and over have access to the internet at work.  According to a Greenwald & Associates survey, 84 \npercent of plan participants find it acceptable to make electronic delivery the default option, which is used as the \nproxy for the number of participants who will not opt out that are automatically enrolled (for a total of 30.2 percent \nreceiving electronic disclosure at work).  Additionally, the NTIA reports that 38.5 percent of individuals age 25 and \nover have access to the internet outside of work.  According to a Pew Research Center survey, 61 percent of internet \nusers use online banking, which is used as the proxy for the number of internet users who will opt in for electronic \ndisclosure (for a total of 23.5 percent receiving electronic disclosure outside of work).  Combining the 30.2 percent \nwho receive electronic disclosure at work with the 23.5 percent who receive electronic disclosure outside of work \nproduces a total of 53.7 percent who will receive electronic disclosure overall. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 125 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     124  \n \nlitigating entities that were previously using the accommodation and that will revoke it fall \nwithin the estimated 109 entities that will revoke the accommodation overall.    \nAs before, HHS assumes that, for each issuer or third party administrator, a manager and \ninside legal counsel and clerical staff will need approximately 2 hours to prepare and send the \nnotification to participants and beneficiaries and maintain records (30 minutes for a manager at a \ncost of $117.40 per hour,108 30 minutes for legal counsel at a cost of $134.50 per hour109, 1 hour \nfor clerical labor at a cost of $55.68 per hour110).  The burden per respondent will be 2 hours with \nan equivalent cost of $181.63; for 109 entities, the total burden will be 218 hours with an \nequivalent cost of approximately $19,798.  As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are \nsplitting the hour burden so each will account for 109 burden hours with an equivalent cost of \napproximately $9,899. \nAs discussed above, HHS estimates that there are 257,000 covered persons in \naccommodated plans that will revoke their accommodated status and use the expanded \nexemption.111  As before, we use the average of 50.1 percent of covered persons who are \npolicyholders, and estimate that an average of 53.7 percent of notices will be sent electronically \nand 46.3 percent by mail.  Therefore, approximately 128,757 notices will be sent, of which \n59,615 notices will be mailed.  HHS estimates that each notice will require $0.49 in postage and \n                                                           \n108 Occupation code 11-1021 for General and Operations Managers with mean hourly wage $58.70, \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes111021.htm \n109 Occupation code 23-1011 for Lawyers with mean hourly wage $67.25, \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm \n110 Occupation code 43-6011 for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants with mean hourly \nwage $27.84, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes436011.htm \n111 In estimating the number of women that might have their contraceptive coverage affected by the expanded \nexemption, we indicated that we do not know the extent to which the number of women in accommodated plans \naffected by these rules overlap with the number of women in plans offered by litigating entities that will be affected \nby these rules, though we assume there is significant overlap. That uncertainty should not affect the calculation of \nthe ICRs for revocation notices, however. If the two numbers overlap, the estimates of plans revoking the \naccommodation and policyholders covered in those plans would already include plans and policyholders of litigating \nentities. If the numbers do not overlap, those litigating entity plans would not presently be enrolled in the \naccommodation, and therefore would not need to send notices concerning revocation of accommodated status.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 126 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     125  \n \n$0.05 in materials cost (paper and ink) and the total postage and materials cost for each notice \nsent via mail will be $0.54. The total cost for sending approximately 59,615 notices by mail is \napproximately $32,192.  As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are splitting the hour burden \nso each will account for 64,379 notices, with an equivalent cost of approximately $16,096. \nTable 1: Summary of Information Collection Burdens \nHourly  Total \nTotal  Labor  Labor \nOMB  Burden per  Annual  Cost of  Cost of \nRegulation  Control  Number of  Respondent  Burden  Reporting  Reporting  Total Cost \nSection  Number  respondents  Responses  (hours)  (hours)  ($)  ($)  ($) \nSelf- 0938- 5*  5  0.83  3.75  $89.95   $337.31   $338.66  \nCertification or  NEW \nNotices to HHS \nNotice of  0938- 55*  210,245  1.25  68.13  $68.02   $4,634.14   $57,199.59  \nAvailability of  NEW \nSeparate \nPayments for \nContraceptive \nServices \nNotice of  0938- 55*  64,379  2.00  109  $90.82   $9,898.84   $25,994.75  \nRevocation of  NEW \nAccommodation \nTotal     115*  274,629  4.08  180.88    $14,870.29   $83,533.00  \n*The total number of respondents is 227 (= 9+109+109) for both HHS and DOL, but the summaries here and below \nexceed that total because of rounding up that occurs when sharing the burden between HHS and DOL. \nNote: There are no capital/maintenance costs associated with the ICRs contained in this rule; therefore, we have \nremoved the associated column from Table 1.

Paperwork Reduction Act—Department of Labor \nUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and an \nindividual is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid \nOMB control number. In accordance with the requirements of the PRA, the ICR for the EBSA \nForm 700 and alternative notice have previously been approved by OMB under control numbers \n1210-0150 and 1210-0152.  A copy of the ICR may be obtained by contacting the PRA \naddressee shown below or at http://www.RegInfo.gov.  PRA ADDRESSEE: G.

DOL submitted the ICRs in order to obtain OMB approval under \nthe PRA for the regulatory revision.  The request was made under emergency clearance \nprocedures specified in regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13.  In an effort to consolidate the number of \ninformation collection requests, DOL will combine the ICR related to the OMB control number \n1210-0152 with the ICR related to the OMB control number 1210-0150.  Once the ICR is \napproved DOL will discontinue 1210-0152.  A copy of the information collection request may be \nobtained free of charge on the RegInfo.gov Web site at \nhttp://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=201705-1210-001.  This approval will \nallow respondents to temporarily utilize the additional flexibility these interim final regulations \nprovide, while DOL seeks public comment on the collection methods—including their utility and \nburden.  \nConsistent with the analysis in the HHS PRA section above, the Departments expect that \neach of the estimated 9 eligible organizations newly opting into the accommodation will spend \napproximately 50 minutes in preparation time and incur $0.54 mailing cost to self-certify or \nnotify HHS.  Each of the 109 issuers or third party administrators for the 109 eligible \norganizations that make use of the accommodation overall will distribute Notices of Availability \nof Separate Payments for Contraceptive Services.  These issuers and third party administrators \nwill spend approximately 1.25 hours in preparation time and incur $0.54 cost per mailed notice.  \nNotices of Availability of Separate Payments for Contraceptive Services will need to be sent to \n420,489 policyholders, and 53.7 percent of the notices will be sent electronically, while 46.3 \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 129 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     128  \n \npercent will be mailed. Finally, 109 entities using the previous accommodation process will \nrevoke its use and will therefore be required to cause the Notice of Revocation of \nAccommodation to be sent (the issuer or third party administrator can send the notice on behalf \nof the entity).  These entities will spend approximately two hours in preparation time and incur \n$0.54 cost per mailed notice.  Notice of Revocation of Accommodation will need to be sent to an \naverage of 128,757 policyholders and 53.7 percent of the notices will be sent electronically.  The \nDOL information collections in this rule are found in 29 CFR 2510.3-16 and 2590.715-2713A \nand are summarized as follows:  \nType of Review: Revised Collection.  \nAgency: DOL–EBSA.  \nTitle: Coverage of Certain Preventive Services under the Affordable Care  Act—Private \nSector.  \nOMB Numbers: 1210-0150.  \nAffected Public: Private Sector—Not for profit and religious organizations; businesses or \nother for-profits.  \nTotal Respondents: 114112 (combined with HHS total is 227).  \nTotal Responses: 274,628 (combined with HHS total is 549,255).  \nFrequency of Response: On occasion.  \nEstimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 181 (combined with HHS total is 362 hours). \nEstimated Total Annual Burden Cost: $68,662 (combined with HHS total is $137,325). \nType of Review: Revised Collection.  \nAgency: DOL–EBSA.  \n                                                           \n112 Denotes that there is an overlap between jurisdiction shared by HHS and DOL over these respondents and \ntherefore they are included only once in the total. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 130 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     129  \n \nF.  Regulatory Reform Executive Orders 13765, 13771 and 13777 \nExecutive Order 13765 (January 20, 2017) directs that, “[t]o the maximum extent \npermitted by law, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and the heads \nof all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities \nunder the Act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant \nexemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that \nwould impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on \nindividuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare \nservices, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or \nmedications.”  In addition, agencies are directed to “take all actions consistent with law to \nminimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the [Affordable Care Act], and \nprepare to afford the States more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare \nmarket.”  These interim final rules exercise the discretion provided to the Departments under the \nAffordable Care Act, RFRA, and other laws to grant exemptions and thereby minimize \nregulatory burdens of the Affordable Care Act on the affected entities and recipients of health \ncare services. \nConsistent with Executive Order 13771 (82 FR 9339, February 3, 2017), we have \nestimated the costs and cost savings attributable to this interim final rule.  As discussed in more \ndetail in the preceding analysis, this interim final rule lessens incremental reporting costs.113  \nTherefore, this interim final rule is considered an Executive Order 13771 deregulatory action.     \n                                                           \n113 Other noteworthy potential impacts encompass potential changes in medical expenditures, including potential \ndecreased expenditures on contraceptive devices and drugs and potential increased expenditures on pregnancy-\nrelated medical services. OMB’s guidance on EO 13771 implementation (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-\noffice/2017/04/05/memorandum-implementing-executive-order-13771-titled-reducing-regulation) states that \nimpacts should be categorized as consistently as possible within Departments.  The Food and Drug Administration, \nwithin HHS, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health \n \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 131 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     130  \n \nF.  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \nThe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (section 202(a) of Pub. L. 104-4), requires \nthe Departments to prepare a written statement, which includes an assessment of anticipated \ncosts and benefits, before issuing “any rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in \nthe expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, \nof $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year.”  The current \nthreshold after adjustment for inflation is $148 million, using the most current (2016) Implicit \nPrice Deflater for the Gross Domestic Product.  For purposes of the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct, these interim final rules do not include any Federal mandate that may result in expenditures \nby State, local, or tribal governments, nor do they include any Federal mandates that may impose \nan annual burden of $100 million, adjusted for inflation, or more on the private sector. \nG.  Federalism \nExecutive Order 13132 outlines fundamental principles of federalism, and requires the \nadherence to specific criteria by Federal agencies in the process of their formulation and \nimplementation of policies that have “substantial direct effects” on States, the relationship \nbetween the Federal Government and States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities \namong the various levels of Government.  Federal agencies promulgating regulations that have \nthese federalism implications must consult with State and local officials, and describe the extent \nof their consultation and the nature of the concerns of State and local officials in the preamble to \nthe regulation. \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAdministration (MSHA), within DOL, regularly estimate medical expenditure impacts in the analyses that \naccompany their regulations, with the results being categorized as benefits (positive benefits if expenditures are \nreduced, negative benefits if expenditures are raised).  Following the FDA, OSHA and MSHA accounting \nconvention leads to this interim final rule’s medical expenditure impacts being categorized as (positive or negative) \nbenefits, rather than as costs, thus placing them outside of consideration for EO 13771 designation purposes. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 132 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     131  \n \nThese interim final rules do not have any Federalism implications, since they only \nprovide exemptions from the contraceptive and sterilization coverage requirement in HRSA \nGuidelines supplied under section 2713 of the PHS Act. \nVII.

To invoke the optional accommodation \nprocess-- \n(i)  The eligible organization or its plan must contract with one or more health insurance \nissuers. \n(ii) The eligible organization must provide either a copy of the self-certification to each \nissuer providing coverage in connection with the plan or a notice to the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that it is an eligible organization and of its objection \nas described in 45 CFR 147.132 to coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services. \n(A)  When a self-certification is provided directly to an issuer, the issuer has sole \nresponsibility for providing such coverage in accordance with § 54.9815-2713. \n(B)  When a notice is provided to the Secretary of the Department Health and Human \nServices, the notice must include the name of the eligible organization; a statement that it objects \nas described in 45 CFR 147.132 to coverage of some or all contraceptive services (including an \nidentification of the subset of contraceptive services to which coverage the eligible organization \nobjects, if applicable) but that it would like to elect the optional accommodation process; the plan \nname and type (that is, whether it is a student health insurance plan within the meaning of 45 \nCFR 147.145(a) or a church plan within the meaning of section 3(33) of ERISA); and the name \nand contact information for any of the plan’s health insurance issuers.  If there is a change in any \nof the information required to be included in the notice, the eligible organization must provide \nupdated information to the Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services for the \noptional accommodation process to remain in effect.  The Department of Health and Human \nServices will send a separate notification to each of the plan’s health insurance issuers informing \nthe issuer that the Secretary of the Department Health and Human Services has received a notice \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 144 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     143  \n \nunder paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and describing the obligations of the issuer under this \nsection. \n(2)  If an issuer receives a copy of the self-certification from an eligible organization or \nthe notification from the Department of Health and Human Services as described in paragraph \n(c)(2)(ii) of this section and does not have its own objection as described in 45 CFR 147.132 to \nproviding the contraceptive services to which the eligible organization objects, then the issuer \nwill provide payments for contraceptive services as follows— \n(i)  The issuer must expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health \ninsurance coverage provided in connection with the group health plan and provide separate \npayments for any contraceptive services required to be covered under § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) \nfor plan participants and beneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the plan. \n(ii)  With respect to payments for contraceptive services, the issuer may not impose any \ncost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any \npremium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible \norganization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.  The issuer must \nsegregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from the monies used to \nprovide payments for contraceptive services.  The issuer must provide payments for \ncontraceptive services in a manner that is consistent with the requirements under sections 2706, \n2709, 2711, 2713, 2719, and 2719A of the PHS Act, as incorporated into section 9815 of the \nPHS Act.  If the group health plan of the eligible organization provides coverage for some but \nnot all of any contraceptive services required to be covered under § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv), the \nissuer is required to provide payments only for those contraceptive services for which the group \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 145 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     144  \n \nhealth plan does not provide coverage.  However, the issuer may provide payments for all \ncontraceptive services, at the issuer’s option. \n(3)  A health insurance issuer may not require any documentation other than a copy of the \nself-certification from the eligible organization or the notification from the Department of Health \nand Human Services described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.   \n(d)  Notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services - self-insured \nand insured group health plans.  For each plan year to which the optional accommodation in \nparagraph (b) or (c) of this section is to apply, a third party administrator required to provide or \narrange payments for contraceptive services pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and an \nissuer required to provide payments for contraceptive services pursuant to paragraph (c) of this \nsection, must provide to plan participants and beneficiaries written notice of the availability of \nseparate payments for contraceptive services contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), but \nseparate from, any application materials distributed in connection with enrollment (or re-\nenrollment) in group health coverage that is effective beginning on the first day of each \napplicable plan year.  The notice must specify that the eligible organization does not administer \nor fund contraceptive benefits, but that the third party administrator or issuer, as applicable, \nprovides or arranges separate payments for contraceptive services, and must provide contact \ninformation for questions and complaints.  The following model language, or substantially \nsimilar language, may be used to satisfy the notice requirement of this paragraph (d): “Your \nemployer has certified that your group health plan qualifies for an accommodation with respect \nto the Federal requirement to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive \nservices for women, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing.  This means \nthat your employer will not contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage. Instead, \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 146 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     145  \n \n[name of third party administrator/health insurance issuer] will provide or arrange separate \npayments for contraceptive services that you use, without cost sharing and at no other cost, for so \nlong as you are enrolled in your group health plan.  Your employer will not administer or fund \nthese payments. If you have any questions about this notice, contact [contact information for \nthird party administrator/health insurance issuer].” \n(e)  Definition.

If the group \nhealth plan of the eligible organization provides coverage for some but not all of any \ncontraceptive services required to be covered under § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), the issuer is \nrequired to provide payments only for those contraceptive services for which the group health \nplan does not provide coverage.  However, the issuer may provide payments for all contraceptive \nservices, at the issuer’s option. \n(3)  A health insurance issuer may not require any documentation other than a copy of the \nself-certification from the eligible organization or the notification from the Department of Health \nand Human Services described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.   \n(d)  Notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services - self-insured \nand insured group health plans.

An eligible organization is an \norganization that meets the criteria of paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. \n(1)  The organization is an objecting entity described in § 147.132(a)(1)(i) or (ii). \n(2)  Notwithstanding its exempt status under § 147.132(a), the organization voluntarily \nseeks to be considered an eligible organization to invoke the optional accommodation under \nparagraph (d) of this section; and \n(3)  The organization self-certifies in the form and manner specified by the Secretary or \nprovides notice to the Secretary as described in paragraph (d) of this section.  To qualify as an \neligible organization, the organization must make such self-certification or notice available for \nexamination upon request by the first day of the first plan year to which the accommodation in \nparagraph (d) of this section applies.  The self-certification or notice must be executed by a \nperson authorized to make the certification or provide the notice on behalf of the organization, \nand must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements under \nsection 107 of ERISA. \n(4)  An eligible organization may revoke its use of the accommodation process, and its \nissuer must provide participants and beneficiaries written notice of such revocation as specified \nin guidance issued by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.  If \ncontraceptive coverage is currently being offered by an issuer through the accommodation \nprocess, the revocation will be effective on the first day of the first plan year that begins on or \nafter 30 days after the date of the revocation (to allow for the provision of notice to plan \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 158 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     157  \n \nparticipants in cases where contraceptive benefits will no longer be provided).  Alternatively, an \neligible organization may give 60-days notice pursuant to section 2715(d)(4) of the PHS Act and \n§ 147.200(b), if applicable, to revoke its use of the accommodation process. \n(d)  Optional accommodation—insured group health plans—(1)  General rule.  A group \nhealth plan established or maintained by an eligible organization that provides benefits through \none or more group health insurance issuers may voluntarily elect an optional accommodation \nunder which its health insurance issuer(s) will provide payments for all or a subset of \ncontraceptive services for one or more plan years.  To invoke the optional accommodation \nprocess: \n(i)  The eligible organization or its plan must contract with one or more health insurance \nissuers. \n(ii)  The eligible organization must provide either a copy of the self-certification to each \nissuer providing coverage in connection with the plan or a notice to the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that it is an eligible organization and of its objection \nas described in § 147.132 to coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services. \n(A)  When a self-certification is provided directly to an issuer, the issuer has sole \nresponsibility for providing such coverage in accordance with § 147.130(a)(iv).  \n(B)  When a notice is provided to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, the notice must include the name of the eligible organization; a statement that it objects \nas described in § 147.132 to coverage of some or all contraceptive services (including an \nidentification of the subset of contraceptive services to which coverage the eligible organization \nobjects, if applicable) but that it would like to elect the optional accommodation process; the plan \nname and type (that is, whether it is a student health insurance plan within the meaning of § \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 159 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     158  \n \n147.145(a) or a church plan within the meaning of section 3(33) of ERISA); and the name and \ncontact information for any of the plan’s health insurance issuers.  If there is a change in any of \nthe information required to be included in the notice, the eligible organization must provide \nupdated information to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for the \noptional accommodation to remain in effect.  The Department of Health and Human Services \nwill send a separate notification to each of the plan’s health insurance issuers informing the \nissuer that the Secretary of the Deparement of Health and Human Services has received a notice \nunder paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and describing the obligations of the issuer under this \nsection.  \n(2)  If an issuer receives a copy of the self-certification from an eligible organization or \nthe notification from the Department of Health and Human Services as described in paragraph \n(d)(1)(ii) of this section and does not have an objection as described in § 147.132 to providing \nthe contraceptive services identified in the self-certification or the notification from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, then the issuer will provide payments for \ncontraceptive services as follows— \n(i)  The issuer must expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health \ninsurance coverage provided in connection with the group health plan and provide separate \npayments for any contraceptive services required to be covered under § 141.130(a)(1)(iv) for \nplan participants and beneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the plan. \n  (ii)  With respect to payments for contraceptive services, the issuer may not impose any \ncost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), premium, fee, or \nother charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group \nhealth plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.  The issuer must segregate premium revenue \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 160 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     159  \n \ncollected from the eligible organization from the monies used to provide payments for \ncontraceptive services.  The issuer must provide payments for contraceptive services in a manner \nthat is consistent with the requirements under sections 2706, 2709, 2711, 2713, 2719, and 2719A \nof the PHS Act.  If the group health plan of the eligible organization provides coverage for some \nbut not all of any contraceptive services required to be covered under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv), the \nissuer is required to provide payments only for those contraceptive services for which the group \nhealth plan does not provide coverage.  However, the issuer may provide payments for all \ncontraceptive services, at the issuer’s option. \n(3)  A health insurance issuer may not require any documentation other than a copy of the \nself-certification from the eligible organization or the notification from the Department of Health \nand Human Services described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.   \n(e)  Notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services - insured group \nhealth plans and student health insurance coverage.  For each plan year to which the optional \naccommodation in paragraph (d) of this section is to apply, an issuer required to provide \npayments for contraceptive services pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section must provide to \nplan participants and beneficiaries written notice of the availability of separate payments for \ncontraceptive services contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), but separate from, any \napplication materials distributed in connection with enrollment (or re-enrollment) in group health \ncoverage that is effective beginning on the first day of each applicable plan year.  The notice \nmust specify that the eligible organization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits, but \nthat the issuer provides separate payments for contraceptive services, and must provide contact \ninformation for questions and complaints.  The following model language, or substantially \nsimilar language, may be used to satisfy the notice requirement of this paragraph (e) “Your \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 161 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     160  \n \n[employer/institution of higher education] has certified that your [group health plan/student \nhealth insurance coverage] qualifies for an accommodation with respect to the Federal \nrequirement to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive services for \nwomen, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing.

Such non-governmental plan sponsors include, but are not \nlimited to, the following entities-- \n(A)  A church, an integrated auxiliary of a church, a convention or association of \nchurches, or a religious order.  \n(B)  A nonprofit organization. \n(C)  A closely held for-profit entity.   \n(D)  A for-profit entity that is not closely held. \n(E)  Any other non-governmental employer. \n(ii)  An institution of higher education as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1002 in its arrangement of \nstudent health insurance coverage, to the extent that institution objects as specified in paragraph \n(a)(2) of this section.  In the case of student health insurance coverage, this section is applicable \nin a manner comparable to its applicability to group health insurance coverage provided in \nconnection with a group health plan established or maintained by a plan sponsor that is an \nemployer, and references to “plan participants and beneficiaries” will be interpreted as references \nto student enrollees and their covered dependents; and \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-1   Filed 10/09/17   Page 163 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     162  \n \n(iii)  A health insurance issuer offering group or individual insurance coverage to the \nextent the issuer objects as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.  Where a health \ninsurance issuer providing group health insurance coverage is exempt under this paragraph \n(a)(1)(iii), the plan remains subject to any requirement to provide coverage for contraceptive \nservices under Guidelines issued under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) unless it is also exempt from that \nrequirement.  \n(2)  The exemption of this paragraph (a) will apply to the extent that an entity described \nin paragraph (a)(1) of this section objects to its establishing, maintaining, providing, offering, or \narranging (as applicable) coverage, payments, or a plan that provides coverage or payments for \nsome or all contraceptive services, based on its sincerely held religious beliefs. \n(b)  Objecting individuals.  Guidelines issued under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) by the Health \nResources and Services Administration must not provide for or support the requirement of \ncoverage or payments for contraceptive services with respect to individuals who object as \nspecified in this paragraph (b), and nothing in § 147.130(a)(1)(iv), 26 CFR 54.9815–\n2713(a)(1)(iv), or 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) may be construed to prevent a willing health \ninsurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage, and as applicable, a \nwilling plan sponsor of a group health plan, from offering a separate benefit package option, or a \nseparate policy, certificate or contract of insurance, to any individual who objects to coverage or \npayments for some or all contraceptive services based on sincerely held religious beliefs. \n(c)  Definition.

Many individuals and entities challenged the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement and regulations (hereinafter, the “contraceptive Mandate,” or the “Mandate”) as \nbeing inconsistent with various legal protections.  These challenges included lawsuits brought by \nsome non-religious organizations with sincerely held moral convictions inconsistent with \nproviding coverage for some or all contraceptive services, and those cases continue to this day.  \nVarious public comments were also submitted asking the Departments to protect objections \nbased on moral convictions. \nThe Departments have recently exercised our discretion to reevaluate these exemptions \nand accommodations.  This evaluation includes consideration of various factors, such as: the \ninterests served by the existing Guidelines, regulations, and accommodation process4; the \nextensive litigation; Executive Order 13798, “Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty” \n(May 4, 2017); Congress’ history of providing protections for moral convictions alongside \nreligious beliefs regarding certain health services (including contraception, sterilization, and \n                                                           \n3 Note, however, that in sections under headings listing only two of the three Departments, the term “Departments” \ngenerally refers only to the two Departments listed in the heading. \n4 In this IFR, we generally use “accommodation” and “accommodation process” interchangeably. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 9 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     8  \n \nitems or services believed to involve abortion); the discretion afforded under PHS Act section \n2713(a)(4); the structure and intent of that provision in the broader context of section 2713 and \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; and the history of the regulatory process and \ncomments submitted in various requests for public comments (including in the Departments’ \n2016 Request for Information).  Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the \nDepartments published, contemporaneously with these interim final rules, companion interim \nfinal rules expanding exemptions to protect sincerely held religious beliefs in the context of the \ncontraceptive Mandate. \nIn light of these considerations, the Departments issue these interim final rules to better \nbalance the Government’s interest in promoting coverage for contraceptive and sterilization \nservices with the Government’s interests in providing conscience protections for individuals and \nentities with sincerely held moral convictions in certain health care contexts, and in minimizing \nburdens imposed by our regulation of the health insurance market. \nA.  The Affordable Care Act \nCollectively, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148), enacted \non March 23, 2010, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-\n152), enacted on March 30, 2010, are known as the Affordable Care Act.  In signing the \nAffordable Care Act, President Obama issued Executive Order 13535 (March 24, 2010), which \ndeclared that, “[u]nder the Act, longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience (such as the \nChurch Amendment, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7, and the Weldon Amendment, section 508(d)(1) of Public \nLaw 111-8) remain intact” and that “[n]umerous executive agencies have a role in ensuring that \nthese restrictions are enforced, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).” \nThose laws protect objections based on moral convictions in addition to religious beliefs. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 10 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     9  \n \nThe Affordable Care Act reorganizes, amends, and adds to the provisions of part A of \ntitle XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) relating to group health plans and health \ninsurance issuers in the group and individual markets.  In addition, the Affordable Care Act adds \nsection 715(a)(1) to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and section \n9815(a)(1) to the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to incorporate the provisions of part A of title \nXXVII of the PHS Act into ERISA and the Code, and thereby make them applicable to certain \ngroup health plans regulated under ERISA or the Code.  The sections of the PHS Act \nincorporated into ERISA and the Code are sections 2701 through 2728 of the PHS Act. \nThese interim final rules concern section 2713 of the PHS Act.  Where it applies, section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act requires coverage without cost sharing for “such additional” women’s \npreventive care and screenings “as provided for” and “supported by” guidelines developed by \nHRSA/HHS. The Congress did not specify any particular additional preventive care and \nscreenings with respect to women that HRSA could or should include in its Guidelines, nor did \nCongress indicate whether the Guidelines should include contraception and sterilization.   \nThe Departments have consistently interpreted section 2713(a)(4)’s of the PHS Act grant \nof authority to include broad discretion to decide the extent to which HRSA will provide for and \nsupport the coverage of additional women’s preventive care and screenings in the Guidelines.  In \nturn, the Departments have interpreted that discretion to include the ability to exempt entities \nfrom coverage requirements announced in HRSA’s Guidelines.  That interpretation is rooted in \nthe text of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, which allows HRSA to decide the extent to which \nthe Guidelines will provide for and support the coverage of additional women’s preventive care \nand screenings.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 11 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     10  \n \nAccordingly, the Departments have consistently interpreted section 2713(a)(4) of the \nPHS Act reference to “comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and \nServices Administration for purposes of this paragraph” to grant HRSA authority to develop \nsuch Guidelines.  And because the text refers to Guidelines “supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of this paragraph,” the Departments have consistently \ninterpreted that authority to afford HRSA broad discretion to consider the requirements of \ncoverage and cost-sharing in determining the nature and extent of preventive care and screenings \nrecommended in the guidelines.  (76 FR 46623).  As the Departments have noted, these \nGuidelines are different from “the other guidelines referenced in section 2713(a), which pre-\ndated the Affordable Care Act and were originally issued for purposes of identifying the non-\nbinding recommended care that providers should provide to patients.”  Id.  Guidelines developed \nas nonbinding recommendations for care implicate significantly different legal and policy \nconcerns than guidelines developed for a mandatory coverage requirement.  To guide HRSA in \nexercising the discretion afforded to it in section 2713(a)(4), the Departments have previously \npromulgated regulations defining the scope of permissible religious exemptions and \naccommodations for such guidelines.  (45 CFR 147.131).  The interim final rules set forth herein \nare a necessary and appropriate exercise of the authority delegated to the Departments as \nadministrators of the statutes.  (26 U.S.C. 9833; 29 U.S.C. 1191c; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-92).  \nOur interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act is confirmed by the Affordable \nCare Act’s statutory structure.  The Congress did not intend to require entirely uniform coverage \nof preventive services.  (76 FR 46623).  To the contrary, Congress carved out an exemption from \nsection 2713 for grandfathered plans.  This exemption is not applicable to many of the other \nprovisions in Title I of the Affordable Care Act—provisions previously referred to by the \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 12 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     11  \n \nDepartments as providing “particularly significant protections.” (75 FR 34540).  Those \nprovisions include:  section 2704, which prohibits preexisting condition exclusions or other \ndiscrimination based on health status in group health coverage; section 2708, which prohibits \nexcessive waiting periods (as of January 1, 2014); section 2711, which relates to lifetime limits; \nsection 2712, which prohibits rescissions of health insurance coverage; section 2714, which \nextends dependent coverage until age 26; and section 2718, which imposes a medical loss ratio \non health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets (for insured coverage), or \nrequires them to provide rebates to policyholders.  (75 FR 34538, 34540, 34542).  Consequently, \nof the 150 million nonelderly people in America with employer-sponsored health coverage, \napproximately 25.5 million are estimated to be enrolled in grandfathered plans not subject to \nsection 2713 of the PHS Act.5  As the Supreme Court observed, “there is no legal requirement \nthat grandfathered plans ever be phased out.”  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. \n2751, 2764 n.10 (2014). \nThe Departments’ interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to permit HRSA to \nestablish exemptions from the Guidelines, and of the Departments’ own authority as \nadministering agencies to guide HRSA in establishing such exemptions, is also consistent with \nExecutive Order 13535.  That order, issued upon the signing of the Affordable Care Act, \nspecified that “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience . . . remain intact,” including \nlaws that protect religious beliefs and moral convictions from certain requirements in the health \ncare context.  Although the text of Executive Order 13535 does not require the expanded \nexemptions issued in these interim final rules, the expanded exemptions are, as explained below, \n                                                           \n5 Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits, 2017 Annual \nSurvey,” available at http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-2017. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 13 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     12  \n \nconsistent with longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience regarding certain health matters, \nand are consistent with the intent that the Affordable Care Act would be implemented in \nconsideration of the protections set forth in those laws. \nB.  The Regulations Concerning Women’s Preventive Services \nOn July 19, 2010, the Departments issued interim final rules implementing section 2713 \nof the PHS Act (75 FR 41726).  Those interim final rules charged HRSA with developing the \nGuidelines authorized by section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act.  \n1.  The Institute of Medicine Report \nIn developing the Guidelines, HRSA relied on an independent report from the Institute of \nMedicine (IOM, now known as the National Academy of Medicine) on women’s preventive \nservices, issued on July 19, 2011, “Clinical Preventive Services for Women, Closing the Gaps” \n(IOM 2011).  The IOM’s report was funded by the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for \nPlanning and Evaluation, pursuant to a funding opportunity that charged the IOM to conduct a \nreview of effective preventive services to ensure women’s health and well-being.6  \nThe IOM made a number of recommendations with respect to women’s preventive \nservices.  As relevant here, the IOM recommended that the Guidelines cover the full range of \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, \nand patient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity.  Because FDA \nincludes in the category of “contraceptives” certain drugs and devices that may not only prevent \n                                                           \n6 Because section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act specifies that the HRSA Guidelines shall include preventive care and \nscreenings “with respect to women,” the Guidelines exclude services relating to a man’s reproductive capacity, such \nas vasectomies and condoms. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 14 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     13  \n \nconception (fertilization), but may also prevent implantation of an embryo,7 the IOM’s \nrecommendation included several contraceptive methods that many persons and organizations \nbelieve are abortifacient—that is, as causing early abortion—and which they conscientiously \noppose for that reason distinct from whether they also oppose contraception or sterilization.   \nOne of the 16 members of the IOM committee, Dr. Anthony LoSasso, a Professor at the \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, wrote a formal dissenting opinion.  He \nstated that the IOM committee did not have sufficient time to evaluate fully the evidence on \nwhether the use of preventive services beyond those encompassed by section 2713(a)(1) through \n(3) of the PHS Act leads to lower rates of disability or disease and increased rates of well-being, \nsuch that the IOM should recommend additional services to be included under Guidelines issued \nunder section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act.  He further stated that “the recommendations were \nmade without high quality, systematic evidence of the preventive nature of the services \nconsidered,” and that “the committee process for evaluation of the evidence lacked transparency \nand was largely subject to the preferences of the committee’s composition.  Troublingly, the \nprocess tended to result in a mix of objective and subjective determinations filtered through a \nlens of advocacy.”  He also raised concerns that the committee did not have time to develop a \nframework for determining whether coverage of any given preventive service leads to a \nreduction in healthcare expenditure.8  IOM 2011 at 231–32.  In its response to Dr. LoSasso, the \nother 15 committee members stated in part that “At the first committee meeting, it was agreed \n                                                           \n7 FDA’s guide “Birth Control: Medicines To Help You,” specifies that various approved contraceptives, including \nLevonorgestrel, Ulipristal Acetate, and IUDs, work mainly by preventing fertilization and “may also work . . . by \npreventing attachment (implantation) to the womb (uterus)” of a human embryo after fertilization. Available at \nhttps://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepublications/ucm313215.htm. \n8 The Departments do not relay these dissenting remarks as an endorsement of the remarks, but to describe the \nhistory of the Guidelines, which includes this part of the report that IOM provided to HRSA.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 15 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     14  \n \nthat cost considerations were outside the scope of the charge, and that the committee should not \nattempt to duplicate the disparate review processes used by other bodies, such as the USPSTF, \nACIP, and Bright Futures.  HHS, with input from this committee, may consider other factors \nincluding cost in its development of coverage decisions.” \n2.  HRSA’s 2011 Guidelines and the Departments’ Second Interim Final Rules \nOn August 1, 2011, HRSA released onto its website its Guidelines for women’s \npreventive services, adopting the recommendations of the IOM.  \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/  The Guidelines included coverage for all FDA-\napproved contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and related patient education and counseling \nfor women with reproductive capacity, as prescribed by a health care provider (hereinafter “the \nMandate”).  \nIn administering this Mandate, on August 1, 2011, the Departments promulgated interim \nfinal rules amending our 2010 interim final rules. (76 FR 46621) (2011 interim final rules).  The \n2011 interim final rules specified that HRSA has the authority to establish exemptions from the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement for certain group health plans established or maintained by \ncertain religious employers and for health insurance coverage provided in connection with such \nplans.9  The 2011 interim final rules only offered the exemption to a narrow scope of employers, \nand only if they were religious.  As the basis for adopting that limited definition of religious \nemployer, the 2011 interim final rules stated that they relied on the laws of some “States that \nexempt certain religious employers from having to comply with State law requirements to cover \ncontraceptive services.”  (76 FR 46623).  Several comments were submitted asking that the \n                                                           \n9 The 2011 amended interim final rules were issued and effective on August 1, 2011, and published in the Federal \nRegister on August 3, 2011. (76 FR 46621). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 16 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     15  \n \nexemption include those who object to contraceptive coverage based on non-religious moral \nconvictions, including pro-life, non-profit advocacy organizations.10  \n3.  The Departments’ Subsequent Rulemaking on the Accommodation and Third Interim Final \nRules  \nFinal regulations issued on February 10, 2012, adopted the definition of “religious \nemployer” in the 2011 interim final rules without modification (2012 final regulations).11 (77 FR \n8725).  The exemption did not require exempt employers to file any certification form or comply \nwith any other information collection process.  \nContemporaneously with the issuance of the 2012 final regulations, HHS—with the \nagreement of the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of the Treasury—issued \nguidance establishing a temporary safe harbor from enforcement of the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement by the Departments with respect to group health plans established or maintained by \ncertain nonprofit organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage (and the \ngroup health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans).12 The temporary safe \nharbor did not include nonprofit organizations that had an objection to contraceptives based on \n                                                           \n10 See, for example, Americans United for Life (“AUL”) Comment on CMA-9992-IFC2 at 10 (Nov. 1, 2011), \navailable at \nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=HHS-OS-2011-0023-59496. \n11 The 2012 final regulations were published on February 15, 2012 (77 FR 8725). \n12 Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers, Group Health Plans, and Group \nHealth Insurance Issuers with Respect to the Requirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing \nUnder section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, Section 715(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act, and Section 9815(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, issued on February 10, 2012, and reissued on \nAugust 15, 2012. Available at: http://www.lb7.uscourts.gov/documents/12cv3932.pdf. The guidance, as reissued on \nAugust 15, 2012, clarified, among other things, that plans that took some action before February 10, 2012, to try, \nwithout success, to exclude or limit contraceptive coverage were not precluded from eligibility for the safe harbor. \nThe temporary enforcement safe harbor was also available to insured student health insurance coverage arranged by \nnonprofit institutions of higher education with religious objections to contraceptive coverage that met the conditions \nset forth in the guidance. See final rule entitled “Student Health Insurance Coverage” published March 21, 2012 (77 \nFR 16457). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 17 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     16  \n \nmoral convictions but not religious beliefs, nor did it include for-profit entities of any kind.  The \nDepartments stated that, during the temporary safe harbor, the Departments would engage in \nrulemaking to achieve “two goals—providing contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing to \nindividuals who want it and accommodating non-exempted, nonprofit organizations’ religious \nobjections to covering contraceptive services.” (77 FR 8727). \nOn March 21, 2012, the Departments published an advance notice of proposed \nrulemaking (ANPRM) that described possible approaches to achieve those goals with respect to \nreligious nonprofit organizations, and solicited public comments on the same. (77 FR 16501). \nFollowing review of the comments on the ANPRM, the Departments published proposed \nregulations on February 6, 2013 (2013 NPRM) (78 FR 8456).  \nThe 2013 NPRM proposed to expand the definition of “religious employer” for purposes \nof the religious employer exemption.  Specifically, it proposed to require only that the religious \nemployer be organized and operate as a nonprofit entity and be referred to in section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, eliminating the requirements that a religious employer-- (1) \nhave the inculcation of religious values as its purpose; (2) primarily employ persons who share \nits religious tenets; and (3) primarily serve persons who share its religious tenets. The proposed \nexpanded definition still encompassed only religious entities. \nThe 2013 NPRM also proposed to create a compliance process, which it called an \naccommodation, for group health plans established, maintained, or arranged by certain eligible \nnonprofit organizations that fell outside the houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries covered \nby section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code (and, thus, outside of the religious employer \nexemption).  The 2013 NPRM proposed to define such eligible organizations as nonprofit \nentities that hold themselves out as religious, oppose providing coverage for certain \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 18 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     17  \n \ncontraceptive items on account of religious objections, and maintain a certification to this effect \nin their records.  The 2013 NPRM stated, without citing a supporting source, that employees of \neligible organizations “may be less likely than” employees of exempt houses of worship and \nintegrated auxiliaries to share their employer’s faith and opposition to contraception on religious \ngrounds.  (78 FR 8461).  The 2013 NPRM therefore proposed that, in the case of an insured \ngroup health plan established or maintained by an eligible organization, the health insurance \nissuer providing group health insurance coverage in connection with the plan would provide \ncontraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries without cost sharing, premium, fee, \nor other charge to plan participants or beneficiaries enrolled in the eligible organization’s plan—\nand without any cost to the eligible organization.13  In the case of a self-insured group health plan \nestablished or maintained by an eligible organization, the 2013 NPRM presented potential \napproaches under which the third party administrator of the plan would provide or arrange for \ncontraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries.  The proposed accommodation \nprocess was not to be offered to non-religious nonprofit organizations, nor to any for-profit \nentities.  Public comments again included the request that exemptions encompass objections to \ncontraceptive coverage based on moral convictions and not just based on religious beliefs.14  On \nAugust 15, 2012, the Departments extended our temporary safe harbor until the first plan year \nbeginning on or after August 1, 2013. \nThe Departments published final regulations on July 2, 2013 (July 2013 final regulations)  \n(78 FR 39869).  The July 2013 final regulations finalized the expansion of the exemption for \n                                                           \n13 The NPRM proposed to treat student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are \ninstitutions of higher education in a similar manner. \n14 See,for example, AUL Comment on CMS-9968-P at 5 (Apr. 8, 2013), available at \nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CMS-2012-0031-79115. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 19 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     18  \n \nhouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries.  Although some commenters had suggested \nthat the exemption be further expanded, the Departments declined to adopt that approach.  The \nJuly 2013 regulations stated that, because employees of objecting houses of worship and \nintegrated auxiliaries are relatively likely to oppose contraception, exempting those organizations \n“does not undermine the governmental interests furthered by the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement.” (78 FR 39874).  However; like the 2013 NPRM, the July 2013 regulations \nassumed that “[h]ouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive \ncoverage on religious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the \nsame faith who share the same objection” to contraceptives. Id. \nThe July 2013 regulation also finalized an accommodation for eligible organizations, \nwhich were then defined to include solely organizations that are religious.  Under the \naccommodation, an eligible organization was required to submit a self-certification to its group \nhealth insurance issuer or third party administrator, as applicable.  Upon receiving that self-\ncertification, the issuer or third party administrator would provide or arrange for payments for \nthe contraceptive services to the plan participants and beneficiaries enrolled in the eligible \norganization’s plan, without requiring any cost sharing on the part of plan participants and \nbeneficiaries and without cost to the eligible organization.  With respect to self-insured plans, the \nthird party administrators (or issuers they contracted with) could receive reimbursements by \nreducing user fee payments (to Federally facilitated Exchanges) by the amounts paid out for \ncontraceptive services under the accommodation, plus an allowance for certain administrative \ncosts, as long as the HHS Secretary requests and an authorizing exception under OMB Circular \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 20 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     19  \n \nNo. A-25R is in effect.15  With respect to fully insured group health plans, the issuer was \nexpected to bear the cost of such payments,16 and HHS intended to clarify in guidance that the \nissuer could treat those payments as an adjustment to claims costs for purposes of medical loss \nratio and risk corridor program calculations.  The Departments extended the temporary safe \nharbor again on June 20, 2013, to encompass plan years beginning on or after August 1, 2013, \nand before January 1, 2014.  \n4.  Litigation Over the Mandate and the Accommodation Process \nDuring the period when the Departments were publishing and modifying our regulations, \norganizations and individuals filed dozens of lawsuits challenging the Mandate.  Plaintiffs \nincluded religious nonprofit organizations, businesses run by religious families, individuals, and \nothers, including several non-religious organizations that opposed coverage of certain \ncontraceptives under the Mandate on the basis of non-religious moral convictions.  Religious for-\nprofit entities won various court decisions leading to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Burwell v. \nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc. 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014).  The Supreme Court ruled against the \nDepartments and held that, under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), the \nMandate could not be applied to the closely held for-profit corporations before the Court because \ntheir owners had religious objections to providing such coverage.17  \nOn August 27, 2014, the Departments simultaneously issued a third set of interim final \nrules (August 2014 interim final rules) (79 FR 51092), and a notice of proposed rulemaking \n                                                           \n15 See also 45 CFR 156.50. Under the regulations, if the third party administrator does not participate in a Federally-\nfacilitated Exchange as an issuer, it is permitted to contract with an insurer which does so participate, in order to \nobtain such reimbursement.  The total contraceptive user fee adjustment for the 2015 benefit year was $33 million. \n16 “[P]roviding payments for contraceptive services is cost neutral for issuers.” (78 FR 39877). \n17 The Supreme Court did not decide whether RFRA would apply to publicly traded for-profit corporations.  See 134 \nS. Ct. at 2774. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 21 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     20  \n \n(August 2014 proposed rules) (79 FR 51118).  The August 2014 interim final rules changed the \naccommodation process so that it could be initiated either by self-certification using EBSA Form \n700 or through a notice informing the Secretary of HHS that an eligible organization had \nreligious objections to coverage of all or a subset of contraceptive services.  (79 FR 51092). In \nresponse to Hobby Lobby, the August 2014 proposed rules extended the accommodation process \nto closely held for-profit entities with religious objections to contraceptive coverage, by \nincluding them in the definition of eligible organizations.  (79 FR 51118).  Neither the August \n2014 interim final rules nor the August 2014 proposed rules extended the exemption; neither \nadded a certification requirement for exempt entities; and neither encompassed objections based \non non-religious moral convictions.  \nOn July 14, 2015, the Departments finalized both the August 2014 interim final rules and \nthe August 2014 proposed rules in a set of final regulations (the July 2015 final regulations) (80 \nFR 41318).  (The July 2015 final regulations also encompassed issues related to other preventive \nservices coverage.)  The July 2015 final regulations allowed eligible organizations to submit a \nnotice to HHS as an alternative to submitting the EBSA Form 700, but specified that such notice \nmust include the eligible organization’s name and an expression of its religious objection, along \nwith the plan name, plan type, and name and contact information for any of the plan’s third party \nadministrators or health insurance issuers.  The Departments indicated that such information \nrepresents the minimum information necessary for us to administer the accommodation process.  \nMeanwhile, a second series of legal challenges were filed by religious nonprofit \norganizations that stated the accommodation impermissibly burdened their religious beliefs \nbecause it utilized their health plans to provide services to which they objected on religious \ngrounds, and it required them to submit a self-certification or notice.  On November 6, 2015, the \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 22 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     21  \n \nU.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in seven similar cases under the title of a filing from the \nThird Circuit, Zubik v. Burwell.  On May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a per curiam \nopinion in Zubik, vacating the judgments of the Courts of Appeals—most of which had ruled in \nthe Departments’ favor—and remanding the cases “in light of the substantial clarification and \nrefinement in the positions of the parties” that had been filed in supplemental briefs. 136 S. Ct. \n1557, 1560 (2016).  The Court stated that it anticipated that, on remand, the Courts of Appeals \nwould “allow the parties sufficient time to resolve any outstanding issues between them.”  Id.  \nThe Court also specified that “the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on petitioners \nfor failure to provide the relevant notice” while the cases remained pending. Id. at 1561.   \nAfter remand, as indicated by the Departments in court filings, meetings were held \nbetween attorneys for the Government and for the plaintiffs in those cases.  The Departments \nalso issued a Request for Information (“RFI”) on July 26, 2016, seeking public comment on \noptions for modifying the accommodation process in light of the supplemental briefing in Zubik \nand the Supreme Court’s remand order.  (81 FR 47741).  Public comments were submitted in \nresponse to the RFI, during a comment period that closed on September 20, 2016.  Those \ncomments included the request that the exemption be expanded to include those who oppose the \nMandate for either religious “or moral” reasons, consistent with various state laws (such as in \nConnecticut or Missouri) that protect objections to contraceptive coverage based on moral \nconvictions.18 \n                                                           \n18 See, for example, https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-54142; see also \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-54218 and \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-46220. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 23 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     22  \n \nBeginning in 2015, lawsuits challenging the Mandate were also filed by various non-\nreligious organizations with moral objections to contraceptive coverage.  These organizations \nasserted that they believe some methods classified by FDA as contraceptives may have an \nabortifacient effect and therefore, in their view, are morally equivalent to abortion.  These \norganizations have neither received an exemption from the Mandate nor do they qualify for the \naccommodation.  For example, the organization that since 1974 has sponsored the annual March \nfor Life in Washington, D.C. (March for Life), filed a complaint claiming that the Mandate \nviolated the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and \nwas arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  Citing, for \nexample, (77 FR 8727), March for Life argued that the Departments’ stated interests behind the \nMandate were only advanced among women who “want” the coverage so as to prevent \n“unintended” pregnancy.  March for Life contended that because it only hires employees who \npublicly advocate against abortion, including what they regard as abortifacient contraceptive \nitems, the Departments’ interests were not rationally advanced by imposing the Mandate upon it \nand its employees.  Accordingly, March for Life contended that applying the Mandate to it (and \nother similarly situated organizations) lacked a rational basis and therefore doing so was \narbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.  March for Life further contended that because \nthe Departments concluded the government’s interests were not undermined by exempting \nhouses of worship and integrated auxiliaries (based on our assumption that such entities are \nrelatively more likely than other religious nonprofits to have employees that share their views \nagainst contraception), applying the Mandate to March for Life or similar organizations that \ndefinitively hire only employees who oppose certain contraceptives lacked a rational basis and \ntherefore violated their right of equal protection under the Due Process Clause.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 24 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     23  \n \nMarch for Life’s employees, who stated they were personally religious (although \npersonal religiosity was not a condition of their employment), also sued as co-plaintiffs.  They \ncontended that the Mandate violates their rights under RFRA by making it impossible for them \nto obtain health insurance consistent with their religious beliefs, either from the plan March for \nLife wanted to offer them, or in the individual market, because the Departments offered no \nexemptions in either circumstance.  Another non-religious nonprofit organization that opposed \nthe Mandate’s requirement to provide certain contraceptive coverage on moral grounds also filed \na lawsuit challenging the Mandate. Real Alternatives, Inc. v. Burwell, 150 F. Supp. 3d 419 (M.D. \nPa. 2015). \nChallenges by non-religious nonprofit organizations led to conflicting opinions among \nthe Federal courts.  A district court agreed with the March for Life plaintiffs on the \norganization’s equal protection claim and the employees’ RFRA claims (not specifically ruling \non the APA claim), and issued a permanent injunction against the Departments that is still in \nplace. March for Life v. Burwell, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116 (D.D.C. 2015).  The appeal in March for \nLife is pending and has been stayed since early 2016.  In another case, Federal district and \nappellate courts in Pennsylvania disagreed with the reasoning from March for Life and ruled \nagainst claims brought by a similarly non-religious nonprofit employer and its religious \nemployees.  Real Alternatives, 150 F. Supp. 3d 419, affirmed by 867 F.3d 338 (3d Cir. 2017). \nOne member of the appeals court panel in Real Alternatives dissented in part, stating he would \nhave ruled in favor of the individual employee plaintiffs under RFRA. Id. at *18.   \nOn December 20, 2016, HRSA updated the Guidelines via its website, \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines2016/index.html.  HRSA announced that, for plans \nsubject to the Guidelines, the updated Guidelines would apply to the first plan year beginning \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 25 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     24  \n \nafter December 20, 2017.  Among other changes, the updated Guidelines specified that the \nrequired contraceptive coverage includes follow-up care (for example, management and \nevaluation, as well as changes to, and removal or discontinuation of, the contraceptive method).  \nThey also specified, for the first time, that coverage should include instruction in fertility \nawareness-based methods for women desiring an alternative method of family planning. HRSA \nstated that, with the input of a committee operating under a cooperative agreement, HRSA would \nreview and periodically update the Women’s Preventive Services’ Guidelines.  The updated \nGuidelines did not alter the religious employer exemption or accommodation process, nor did \nthey extend the exemption or accommodation process to organizations or individuals that oppose \ncertain forms of contraception (and coverage thereof) on moral grounds. \nOn January 9, 2017, the Departments issued a document entitled, “FAQs About \nAffordable Care Act Implementation Part 36.”19  The FAQ stated that, after reviewing comments \nsubmitted in response to the 2016 RFI and considering various options, the Departments could \nnot find a way at that time to amend the accommodation so as to satisfy objecting eligible \norganizations while pursuing the Departments’ policy goals.  The Departments did not adopt the \napproach requested by certain commenters, cited above, to expand the exemption to include \nthose who oppose the Mandate for moral reasons. \nOn May 4, 2017, the President issued Executive Order 13798, “Promoting Free Speech \nand Religious Liberty.” Section 3 of that order declares, “Conscience Protections with Respect to \nPreventive-Care Mandate.  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the \n                                                           \n19 Available at: https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-\n36.pdf and https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/Downloads/ACA-FAQs-Part36_1-9-17-\nFinal.pdf. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 26 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     25  \n \nSecretary of Health and Human Services shall consider issuing amended regulations, consistent \nwith applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate \npromulgated under section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.” \nII. Expanded Exemptions and Accommodations for Moral Convictions  \nThese interim final rules incorporate conscience protections into the contraceptive \nMandate.  They do so in part to bring the Mandate into conformity with Congress’s long history \nof providing or supporting conscience protections in the regulation of sensitive health-care \nissues, cognizant that Congress neither required the Departments to impose the Mandate nor \nprohibited them from providing conscience protections if they did so. Specifically, these interim \nfinal rules expand exemptions to the contraceptive Mandate to protect certain entities and \nindividuals that object to coverage of some or all contraceptives based on sincerely held moral \nconvictions but not religious beliefs, and these rules make those exempt entities eligible for \naccommodations concerning the same Mandate.  \nA.  Discretion to Provide Exemptions under Section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act and the \nAffordable Care Act \nThe Departments have consistently interpreted HRSA’s authority under section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to allow for exemptions and accommodations to the contraceptive \nMandate for certain objecting organizations.  Section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act gives HRSA \ndiscretion to decide whether and in what circumstances it will support Guidelines providing for \nadditional women’s preventive services coverage.  That authority includes HRSA’s discretion to \ninclude contraceptive coverage in those Guidelines, but the Congress did not specify whether or \nto what extent HRSA should do so.  Therefore, section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act allows HRSA \nto not apply the Guidelines to certain plans of entities or individuals with religious or moral \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 27 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     26  \n \nobjections to contraceptive coverage, and by not applying the Guidelines to them, to exempt \nthose entities from the Mandate.  These rules are a necessary and appropriate exercise of the \nauthority of HHS, of which HRSA is a component, and of the authority delegated to the \nDepartments collectively as administrators of the statutes.  (26 U.S.C. 9833;  29 U.S.C. 1191c; \n42 U.S.C. 300gg-92). \nOur protection of conscience in these interim final rules is consistent with the structure \nand intent of the Affordable Care Act.  The Affordable Care Act refrains from applying section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to millions of women in grandfathered plans.  In contrast, we \nanticipate that conscientious exemptions to the Mandate will impact a much smaller number of \nwomen. President Obama emphasized in signing the Affordable Care Act that “longstanding \nFederal law to protect conscience”—laws with conscience protections encompassing moral (as \nwell as religious) objections—specifically including (but not limited to) the Church Amendments \n(42 U.S.C. 300a-7), “remain intact.” Executive Order 13535.  Nothing in the Affordable Care \nAct suggests Congress’ intent to deviate from its long history, discussed below, of protecting \nmoral convictions in particular health care contexts.  The Departments’ implementation of \nsection 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act with respect to contraceptive coverage is a context similar to \nthose encompassed by many other health care conscience protections provided or supported by \nCongress.  This Mandate concerns contraception and sterilization services, including items \nbelieved by some citizens to have an abortifacient effect—that is, to cause the destruction of a \nhuman life at an early stage of embryonic development.  These are highly sensitive issues in the \nhistory of health care regulation and have long been shielded by conscience protections in the \nlaws of the United States. \nB.  Congress’ History of Providing Exemptions for Moral Convictions \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 28 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     27  \n \nIn deciding the most appropriate way to exercise our discretion in this context, the \nDepartments draw on nearly 50 years of statutory law and Supreme Court precedent discussing \nthe protection of moral convictions in certain circumstances—particularly in the context of \nhealth care and health insurance coverage.  Congress very recently expressed its intent on the \nmatter of Government-mandated contraceptive coverage when it declared, with respect to the \npossibility that the District of Columbia would require contraceptive coverage, that “it is the \nintent of Congress that any legislation enacted on such issue should include a ‘conscience clause’ \nwhich provides exceptions for religious beliefs and moral convictions.”  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2017, Division C, Title VIII, Sec. 808, Pub. L. No. 115-31 (May 5, 2017). \nIn support of these interim final rules, we consider it significant that Congress’ most recent \nstatement on the prospect of Government mandated contraceptive coverage specifically intends \nthat a conscience clause be included to protect moral convictions.  \nThe many statutes listed in Section I-Background under footnote 1, which show \nCongress’ consistent protection of moral convictions alongside religious beliefs in the Federal \nregulation of health care, includes laws such as the 1973 Church Amendments, which we discuss \nat length below, all the way to the 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act discussed above.  \nNotably among those laws, the Congress has enacted protections for health plans or health care \norganizations in Medicaid or Medicare Advantage to object “on moral or religious grounds” to \nproviding coverage of certain counseling or referral services. 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) \n(protecting against forced counseling or referrals in Medicare Choice, now Medicare Advantage, \nmanaged care plans with respect to objections based on “moral or religious grounds”); 42 U.S.C. \n1396u-2(b)(3) (protecting against forced counseling or referrals in Medicaid managed care plans \nwith respect to objections based on “moral or religious grounds”).  The Congress has also \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 29 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     28  \n \nprotected individuals who object to prescribing or providing contraceptives contrary to their \n“religious beliefs or moral convictions.” Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Division C, \nTitle VII, Sec. 726(c) (Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act), Pub. L. \nNo. 115-31.  \nC.  The Church Amendments’ Protection of Moral Convictions \nOne of the most important and well-established federal statutes respecting conscientious \nobjections in specific health care contexts was enacted over the course of several years beginning \nin 1973, initially as a response to court decisions raising the prospect that entities or individuals \nmight be required to facilitate abortions or sterilizations.  These sections of the United States \nCode are known as the Church Amendments, named after their primary sponsor Senator Frank \nChurch (D-Idaho).  The Church Amendments specifically provide conscience protections based \non sincerely held moral convictions.  Among other things, the amendments protect the recipients \nof certain Federal health funds from being required to perform, assist, or make their facilities \navailable for abortions or sterilizations if they object “on the basis of religious beliefs or moral \nconvictions,” and they prohibit recipients of certain Federal health funds from discriminating \nagainst any personnel “because he refused to perform or assist in the performance of such a \nprocedure or abortion on the grounds that his performance or assistance in the performance of \nthe procedure or abortion would be contrary to his religious beliefs or moral convictions” (42 \nU.S.C. 300a-7(b), (c)(1)).  Later additions to the Church Amendments protect other \nconscientious objections, including some objections on the basis of moral conviction to “any \nlawful health service,” or to “any part of a health service program.” (42 U.S.C. 300a-7(c)(2), \n(d)). In contexts covered by those sections of the Church Amendments, the provision or coverage \nof certain contraceptives, depending on the circumstances, could constitute “any lawful health \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 30 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     29  \n \nservice” or a “part of a health service program.” As such, the protections provided by those \nprovisions of the Church Amendments would encompass moral objections to contraceptive \nservices or coverage.  \nThe Church Amendments were enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in \nRoe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).  Even though the Court in Roe required abortion to be legal \nin certain circumstances, Roe did not include, within that right, the requirement that other \ncitizens must facilitate its exercise.  Thus, Roe favorably quoted the proceedings of the American \nMedical Association House of Delegates 220 (June 1970), which declared “Neither physician, \nhospital, nor hospital personnel shall be required to perform any act violative of personally-held \nmoral principles.” 410 U.S. at 144 & n.38 (1973).  Likewise in Roe’s companion case, Doe v. \nBolton, the Court observed that, under State law, “a physician or any other employee has the \nright to refrain, for moral or religious reasons, from participating in the abortion procedure.” 410 \nU.S. 179, 197–98 (1973).  The Court said that these conscience provisions “obviously . . . afford \nappropriate protection.” Id. at 198.  As an Arizona court later put it, “a woman’s right to an \nabortion or to contraception does not compel a private person or entity to facilitate either.” \nPlanned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Am. Ass’n of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 257 \nP.3d 181, 196 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011). \nThe Congressional Record contains relevant discussions that occurred when the \nprotection for moral convictions was first proposed in the Church Amendments.  When Senator \nChurch introduced the first of those amendments in 1973, he cited not only Roe v. Wade but also \nan instance where a Federal court had ordered a Catholic hospital to perform sterilizations. 119 \nCongr. Rec. S5717–18 (Mar. 27, 1973).  After his opening remarks, Senator Adlai Stevenson III \n(D-IL) rose to ask that the amendment be changed to specify that it also protects objections to \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 31 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     30  \n \nabortion and sterilization based on moral convictions on the same terms as it protects objections \nbased on religious beliefs.  The following excerpt of the Congressional Record is particularly \nrelevant to this discussion: \nMr. STEVENSON. Mr. President, first of all I commend the Senator from Idaho for \nbringing this matter to the attention of the Senate. I ask the Senator a question. \nOne need not be of the Catholic faith or any other religious faith to feel deeply \nabout the worth of human life. The protections afforded by this amendment run only to \nthose whose religious beliefs would be offended by the necessity of performing or \nparticipating in the performance of certain medical procedures; others, for moral reasons, \nnot necessarily for any religious belief, can feel equally as strong about human life. They \ntoo can revere human life. \nAs mortals, we cannot with confidence say, when life begins. But whether it is \nlife, or the potentiality of life, our moral convictions as well as our religious beliefs, \nwarrant protection from this intrusion by the Government. Would, therefore, the Senator \ninclude moral convictions? \nWould the Senator consider an amendment on page 2, line 18 which would add to \nreligious beliefs, the words “or moral”? \nMr. CHURCH. I would suggest to the Senator that perhaps his objective could be more \nclearly stated if the words “or moral conviction” were added after “religious belief.” I \nthink that the Supreme Court in considering the protection we give religious beliefs has \ngiven comparable treatment to deeply held moral convictions. I would not be averse to \namending the language of the amendment in such a manner. It is consistent with the \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 32 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     31  \n \ngeneral purpose. I see no reason why a deeply held moral conviction ought not be given \nthe same treatment as a religious belief. \nMr. STEVENSON. The Senator's suggestion is well taken. I thank him. \n119 Congr. Rec. S5717–18.  \nAs the debate proceeded, Senator Church went on to quote Doe v. Bolton’s reliance on a \nGeorgia statute that stated “a physician or any other employee has the right to refrain, for moral \nor religious reasons, from participating in the abortion procedure.” 119 Congr. Rec. at S5722 \n(quoting 410 U.S. at 197–98). Senator Church added, “I see no reason why the amendment ought \nnot also to cover doctors and nurses who have strong moral convictions against these particular \noperations.” Id.  Considering the scope of the protections, Senator Gaylord Nelson (D-WI) asked \nwhether, “if a hospital board, or whatever the ruling agency for the hospital was, a governing \nagency or otherwise, just capriciously—and not upon the religious or moral questions at all—\nsimply said, ‘We are not going to bother with this kind of procedure in this hospital,’ would the \npending amendment permit that?” 119 Congr. Rec. at S5723. Senator Church responded that the \namendment would not encompass such an objection. Id.  \nSenator James L. Buckley (C-NY), speaking in support of the amendment, added the \nfollowing perspective: \nMr. BUCKLEY. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Idaho for proposing this \nmost important and timely amendment. It is timely in the first instance because the \nattempt has already been made to compel the performance of abortion and sterilization \noperations on the part of those who are fundamentally opposed to such procedures. And it \nis timely also because the recent Supreme Court decisions will likely unleash a series of \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 33 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     32  \n \ncourt actions across the United States to try to impose the personal preferences of the \nmajority of the Supreme Court on the totality of the Nation.  \nI believe it is ironic that we should have this debate at all. Who would have \npredicted a year or two ago that we would have to guard against even the possibility that \nsomeone might be free [sic]20 to participate in an abortion or sterilization against his will? \nSuch an idea is repugnant to our political tradition. This is a Nation which has always \nbeen concerned with the right of conscience. It is the right of conscience which is \nprotected in our draft laws. It is the right of conscience which the Supreme Court has \nquite properly expanded not only to embrace those young men who, because of the tenets \nof a particular faith, believe they cannot kill another man, but also those who because of \ntheir own deepest moral convictions are so persuaded. \nI am delighted that the Senator from Idaho has amended his language to include \nthe words “moral conviction,” because, of course, we know that this is not a matter of \nconcern to any one religious body to the exclusion of all others, or even to men who \nbelieve in a God to the exclusion of all others. It has been a traditional concept in our \nsociety from the earliest times that the right of conscience, like the paramount right to life \nfrom which it is derived, is sacred. \n119 Congr. Rec. at S5723.  \nIn support of the same protections when they were debated in the U.S. House, \nRepresentative Margaret Heckler (R-MA)21 likewise observed that “the right of conscience has \nlong been recognized in the parallel situation in which the individual’s right to conscientious \n                                                           \n20 The Senator might have meant “[forced] . . . against his will.” \n21 Rep. Heckler later served as the 15th Secretary of HHS, from March 1983 to December 1985. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 34 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     33  \n \nobjector status in our selective service system has been protected” and “expanded by the \nSupreme Court to include moral conviction as well as formal religious belief.” 119 Congr. Rec. \nH4148–49 (May 31, 1973). Rep. Heckler added, “We are concerned here only with the right of \nmoral conscience, which has always been a part of our national tradition.” Id. at 4149. \nThese first of the Church Amendments, codified at 42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b) and (c)(1), \npassed the House 372–1, and were approved by the Senate 94–0. 119 Congr. Rec. at H4149; 119 \nCongr. Rec. S10405 (June 5, 1973). The subsequently adopted provisions that comprise the \nChurch Amendments similarly extend protection to those organizations and individuals who \nobject to the provision of certain services on the basis of their moral convictions. And, as noted \nabove, subsequent statutes add protections for moral objections in many other situations. These \ninclude, for example:  \n Protections for individuals and entities that object to abortion: see 42 U.S.C. 238n; 42 \nU.S.C. 18023; 42 U.S.C. 2996f(b); and Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, \nTitle V, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-31;  \n Protections for entities and individuals that object to providing or covering \ncontraceptives: see id. at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808; id. at Div. C, Title VII, Sec. 726(c) \n(Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act); and id.at Div. I, Title \nIII; and \n Protections for entities and individuals that object to performing, assisting, counseling, or \nreferring as pertains to suicide, assisted suicide, or advance directives:  see 42 U.S.C. \n290bb-36; 42 U.S.C. 14406;  42 U.S.C. 18113; and 42 U.S.C. 1396a(w)(3). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 35 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     34  \n \nThe Departments believe that the intent behind Congress’ protection of moral convictions \nin certain health care contexts, especially to protect entities and individuals from governmental \ncoercion, supports our decision in these interim final rules to protect sincerely held moral \nconvictions from governmental compulsion threatened by the contraceptive Mandate.  \nD.  Court Precedents Relevant to These Expanded Exemptions \nThe legislative history of the protection of moral convictions in the first Church \nAmendments shows that Members of Congress saw the protection as being consistent with \nSupreme Court decisions.  Not only did Senator Church cite the abortion case Doe v. Bolton as a \nparallel instance of conscience protection, but he also spoke of the Supreme Court generally \ngiving “comparable treatment to deeply held moral convictions.” Both Senator Buckley and Rep. \nHeckler specifically cited the Supreme Court’s protection of moral convictions in laws governing \nmilitary service.  Those legislators appear to have been referencing cases such as Welsh v. \nUnited States, 398 U.S. 333 (1970), which the Supreme Court decided just 3 years earlier.  \nWelsh involved what is perhaps the Government’s paradigmatic compelling interest—the \nneed to defend the nation by military force.  The Court stated that, where the Government \nprotects objections to military service based on “religious training and belief,” that protection \nwould also extend to avowedly non-religious objections to war held with the same moral \nstrength. Id. at 343. The Court declared, “[i]f an individual deeply and sincerely holds beliefs \nthat are purely ethical or moral in source and content but that nevertheless impose upon him a \nduty of conscience to refrain from participating in any war at any time, those beliefs certainly \noccupy in the life of that individual ‘a place parallel to that filled by … God’ in traditionally \nreligious persons. Because his beliefs function as a religion in his life, such an individual is as \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 36 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     35  \n \nmuch entitled to a ‘religious’ conscientious objector exemption … as is someone who derives his \nconscientious opposition to war from traditional religious convictions.”  \nThe Departments look to the description of moral convictions in Welsh to help explain \nthe scope of the protection provided in these interim final rules.  Neither these interim final rules, \nnor the Church Amendments or other Federal health care conscience statutes, define “moral \nconvictions” (nor do they define “religious beliefs”).  But in issuing these interim final rules, we \nseek to use the same background understanding of that term that is reflected in the Congressional \nRecord in 1973, in which legislators referenced cases such as Welsh to support the addition of \nlanguage protecting moral convictions.  In protecting moral convictions parallel to religious \nbeliefs, Welsh describes moral convictions warranting such protection as ones:  (1) that the \n“individual deeply and sincerely holds”; (2) “that are purely ethical or moral in source and \ncontent; (3) “but that nevertheless impose upon him a duty”; (4) and that “certainly occupy in the \nlife of that individual a place parallel to that filled by … God’ in traditionally religious persons,” \nsuch that one could say “his beliefs function as a religion in his life.” (398 U.S. at 339–40).  As \nrecited above, Senators Church and Nelson agreed that protections for such moral convictions \nwould not encompass an objection that an individual or entity raises “capriciously.”  Instead, \nalong with the requirement that protected moral convictions must be “sincerely held,” this \nunderstanding cabins the protection of moral convictions in contexts where they occupy a place \nparallel to that filled by sincerely held religious beliefs in religious persons and organizations. \nIn the context of this particular Mandate, it is also worth noting that, in Hobby Lobby, \nJustice Ginsburg (joined, in this part of the opinion, by Justices Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor), \ncited Justice Harlan’s opinion in Welsh, 398 U.S. at 357–58, in support of her statement that \n“[s]eparating moral convictions from religious beliefs would be of questionable legitimacy.” 134 \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 37 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     36  \n \nS. Ct. at 2789 n.6.  In quoting this passage, the Departments do not mean to suggest that all laws \nprotecting only religious beliefs constitute an illegitimate “separat[ion]” of moral convictions, \nnor do we assert that moral convictions must always be protected alongside religious beliefs; we \nalso do not agree with Justice Harlan that distinguishing between religious and moral objections \nwould violate the Establishment Clause.  Instead, the Departments believe that, in the specific \nhealth care context implicated here, providing respect for moral convictions parallel to the \nrespect afforded to religious beliefs is appropriate, draws from long-standing Federal \nGovernment practice, and shares common ground with Congress’ intent in the Church \nAmendments and in later Federal conscience statutes that provide protections for moral \nconvictions alongside religious beliefs in other health care contexts. \nE.  Conscience Protections in Regulations and Among the States \nThe tradition of protecting moral convictions in certain health contexts is not limited to \nCongress. Multiple federal regulations protect objections based on moral convictions in such \ncontexts.22  Other federal regulations have also applied the principle of respecting moral \nconvictions alongside religious beliefs when they have determined that it is appropriate to do so \nin particular circumstances.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has consistently \nprotected “moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with \nthe strength of traditional religious views” alongside religious views under the “standard [] \n                                                           \n22 See, for example, 42 CFR 422.206 (declaring that the general Medicare Advantage rule “does not require the MA \nplan to cover, furnish, or pay for a particular counseling or referral service if the MA organization that offers the \nplan—(1) Objects to the provision of that service on moral or religious grounds.”); 42 CFR 438.102 (declaring that \ninformation requirements do not apply “if the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP objects to the service on moral or religious \ngrounds”); 48 CFR 1609.7001 (“health plan sponsoring organizations are not required to discuss treatment options \nthat they would not ordinarily discuss in their customary course of practice because such options are inconsistent \nwith their professional judgment or ethical, moral or religious beliefs.”); 48 CFR 352.270-9 (“Non-Discrimination \nfor Conscience” clause for organizations receiving HIV or Malaria relief funds). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 38 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     37  \n \ndeveloped in United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163 (1965) and [Welsh].”  (29 CFR 1605.1).  The \nDepartment of Justice has declared that, in cases of capital punishment, no officer or employee \nmay be required to attend or participate if doing so “is contrary to the moral or religious \nconvictions of the officer or employee, or if the employee is a medical professional who \nconsiders such participation or attendance contrary to medical ethics.”  (28 CFR 26.5).23 \nForty-five States have health care conscience protections covering objections to abortion, \nand several of those also cover sterilization or contraception.24  Most of those State laws protect \nobjections based on “moral,” “ethical,” or “conscientious” grounds in addition to “religious” \ngrounds.  Particularly in the case of abortion, some Federal and State conscience laws do not \nrequire any specified motive for the objection.  (42 U.S.C. 238n).  These various statutes and \nregulations reflect an important governmental interest in protecting moral convictions in \nappropriate health contexts.  \nThe contraceptive Mandate implicates that governmental interest.  Many persons and \nentities object to this Mandate in part because they consider some forms of FDA-approved \ncontraceptives to be abortifacients and morally equivalent to abortion due to the possibility that \nsome of the items may have the effect of preventing the implantation of a human embryo after \nfertilization.  Based on our knowledge from the litigation, all of the current litigants asserting \npurely non-religious objections share this view, and most of the religious litigants do as well. \n                                                           \n23 See also 18 CFR 214.11 (where a law enforcement agency (LEA) seeks assistance in the investigation or \nprosecution of trafficking of persons, the reasonableness of the LEA’s request will depend in part on “[c]ultural, \nreligious, or moral objections to the request”). \n24 According to the Guttmacher Institute, 45 states have conscience statutes pertaining to abortion (43 of which \ncover institutions), 18 have conscience statutes pertaining to sterilization (16 of which cover institutions), and 12 \nhave conscience statutes pertaining to contraception (8 of which cover institutions).  “Refusing to Provide Health \nServices” (June 1, 2017), available at https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/refusing-provide-health-\nservices. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 39 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     38  \n \nThe Supreme Court, in describing family business owners with religious objections, explained \nthat “[t]he owners of the businesses have religious objections to abortion, and according to their \nreligious beliefs the four contraceptive methods at issue are abortifacients.  If the owners comply \nwith the HHS mandate, they believe they will be facilitating abortions.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. \nCt. at 2751.  Outside of the context of abortion, as cited above, Congress has also provided \nhealth care conscience protections pertaining to sterilization, contraception, and other health care \nservices and practices. \nF. Founding Principles \nThe Departments also look to guidance from the broader history of respect for conscience \nin the laws and founding principles of the United States.  Members of Congress specifically \nrelied on the American tradition of respect for conscience when they decided to protect moral \nconvictions in health care.  As quoted above, in supporting protecting conscience based on non-\nreligious moral convictions, Senator Buckley declared “[i]t has been a traditional concept in our \nsociety from the earliest times that the right of conscience, like the paramount right to life from \nwhich it is derived, is sacred.” Rep. Heckler similarly stated that “the right of moral conscience . \n. . has always been a part of our national tradition.”  This tradition is reflected, for example, in a \nletter President George Washington wrote saying that “[t]he Citizens of the United States of \nAmerica have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an \nenlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation.  All possess alike liberty of conscience \nand immunities of citizenship.”25  Thomas Jefferson similarly declared that “[n]o provision in \nour Constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience \n                                                           \n25 From George Washington to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island (Aug. 18, 1790), available at \nhttps://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-06-02-0135. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 40 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     39  \n \nagainst the enterprises of the civil authority.”26  Although these statements by Presidents \nWashington and Jefferson were spoken to religious congregations, and although religious and \nmoral conscience were tightly intertwined for the Founders, they both reflect a broad principle of \nrespect for conscience against government coercion. James Madison likewise called conscience \n“the most sacred of all property,” and proposed that the Bill of Rights should guarantee, in \naddition to protecting religious belief and worship, that “the full and equal rights of conscience \n[shall not] be in any manner, or on any pretext infringed.”27   \nThese Founding Era statements of general principle do not specify how they would be \napplied in a particular health care context.  We do not suggest that the specific protections \noffered in this rule would also be required or necessarily appropriate in any other context that \ndoes not raise the specific concerns implicated by this Mandate.  These interim final rules do not \naddress in any way how the Government would balance its interests with respect to other health \nservices not encompassed by the contraceptive Mandate.28  Instead we highlight this tradition of \nrespect for conscience from our Founding Era to provide background support for the \nDepartments’ decision to implement section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, while protecting \nconscience in the exercise of moral convictions. We believe that these interim final rules are \nconsistent both with the American tradition of respect for conscience and with Congress’ history \nof providing conscience protections in the kinds of health care matters involved in this Mandate.  \n                                                           \n26 Letter to the Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church at New London, Connecticut (February 4, 1809), \navailable at https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/99-01-02-9714.  \n27 James Madison, “Essay on Property” (March 29, 1792); First draft of the First Amendment, 1 Annals of Congress \n434 (June 8, 1789). \n28 As the Supreme Court stated in Hobby Lobby, the Court’s decision concerns only the contraceptive Mandate, and \nshould not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage mandates, for example, for vaccinations or blood \ntransfusions, must necessarily fail if they conflict with an employer’s religious beliefs. Nor does the Court’s opinion \nprovide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious (or moral) practice. 134 S. Ct. at \n2783. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 41 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     40  \n \nG.  Executive Orders Relevant to These Expanded Exemptions \nProtecting moral convictions, as set forth in the expanded exemptions and \naccommodations of these rules, is consistent with recent executive orders.  President Trump’s \nExecutive Order concerning this Mandate directed the Departments to consider providing \nprotections, not specifically for “religious” beliefs, but for “conscience.”  We interpret that term \nto include moral convictions and not just religious beliefs.  Likewise, President Trump’s first \nExecutive Order, EO 13765, declared that “the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n(Secretary) and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with \nauthorities and responsibilities under the [ACA] shall exercise all authority and discretion \navailable to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any \nprovision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, \ntax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, \npatients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical \ndevices, products, or medications.”  This Mandate imposes both a cost, fee, tax, or penalty, and a \nregulatory burden, on individuals and purchasers of health insurance that have moral convictions \nopposed to providing contraceptive coverage.  These interim final rules exercise the \nDepartments’ discretion to grant exemptions from the Mandate to reduce and relieve regulatory \nburdens and promote freedom in the health care market. \nH.  Litigation Concerning the Mandate \nThe sensitivity of certain health care matters makes it particularly important for the \nGovernment to tread carefully when engaging in regulation concerning those areas, and to \nrespect individuals and organizations whose moral convictions are burdened by Government \nregulations.  Providing conscience protections advances the Affordable Care Act’s goal of \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 42 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     41  \n \nexpanding health coverage among entities and individuals that might otherwise be reluctant to \nparticipate in the market.  For example, the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby declared that, if \nHHS requires owners of businesses to cover procedures that the owners “could not in good \nconscience” cover, such as abortion, “HHS would effectively exclude these people from full \nparticipation in the economic life of the Nation.” 134 S. Ct. at 2783.  That would be a serious \noutcome.  As demonstrated by litigation and public comments, various citizens sincerely hold \nmoral convictions, which are not necessarily religious, against providing or participating in \ncoverage of contraceptive items included in the Mandate, and some believe that some of those \nitems may cause early abortions.  The Departments wish to implement the contraceptive \ncoverage Guidelines issued under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act in a way that respects the \nmoral convictions of our citizens so that they are more free to engage in “full participation in the \neconomic life of the Nation.”  These expanded exemptions do so by removing an obstacle that \nmight otherwise lead entities or individuals with moral objections to contraceptive coverage to \nchoose not to sponsor or participate in health plans if they include such coverage. \nAmong the lawsuits challenging the Mandate, two have been filed based in part on non-\nreligious moral convictions.  In one case, the Departments are subject to a permanent injunction \nrequiring us to respect the non-religious moral objections of an employer. See March for Life v. \nBurwell, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116 (D.D.C. 2015).  In the other case, an appeals court recently \naffirmed a district court ruling that allows the previous regulations to be imposed in a way that \nviolates the moral convictions of a small nonprofit pro-life organization and its employees. See \nReal Alternatives, 2017 WL 3324690.  Our litigation of these cases has led to inconsistent court \nrulings, consumed substantial governmental resources, and created uncertainty for objecting \norganizations, issuers, third party administrators, and employees and beneficiaries.  The \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 43 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     42  \n \norganizations that have sued seeking a moral exemption have all adopted moral tenets opposed to \ncontraception and hire only employees who share this view.  It is reasonable to conclude that \nemployees of these organizations would therefore not benefit from the Mandate.  As a result, \nsubjecting this subset of organizations to the Mandate does not advance any governmental \ninterest.  The need to resolve this litigation and the potential concerns of similar entities, and our \nrequirement to comply with permanent injunctive relief currently imposed in March for Life, \nprovide substantial reasons for the Departments to protect moral convictions through these \ninterim final rules.  Even though, as discussed below, we assume the number of entities and \nindividuals that may seek exemption from the Mandate on the basis of moral convictions, as \nthese two sets of litigants did, will be small, we know from the litigation that it will not be zero. \nAs a result, the Departments have taken these types of objections into consideration in reviewing \nour regulations.  Having done so, we consider it appropriate to issue the protections set forth in \nthese interim final rules.  Just as Congress, in adopting the early provisions of the Church \nAmendments, viewed it as necessary and appropriate to protect those organizations and \nindividuals with objections to certain health care services on the basis of moral convictions, so \nwe, too, believe that “our moral convictions as well as our religious beliefs, warrant protection \nfrom this intrusion by the Government” in this situation. \nI.  The Departments’ Rebalancing of Government Interests \nFor additional discussion of the Government’s balance of interests concerning religious \nbeliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules, see the related document  \npublished by the Department elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.  There, we \nacknowledge that the Departments have changed the policies and interpretations we previously \nadopted with respect to the Mandate and the governmental interests that underlying it, and we \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 44 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     43  \n \nassert that we now believe the Government’s legitimate interests in providing for contraceptive \ncoverage do not require us to violate sincerely held religious beliefs while implementing the \nGuidelines.  For parallel reasons, the Departments believe Congress did not set forth—and we do \nnot possess—interests that require us to violate sincerely held moral convictions in the course of \ngenerally requiring contraceptive coverage.  These changes in policy are within the Departments’ \nauthority.  As the Supreme Court has acknowledged, “[a]gencies are free to change their existing \npolicies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.” Encino Motorcars, LLC \nv. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2016).  This “reasoned analysis” requirement does not \ndemand that an agency “demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy \nare better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the \nstatute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the \nconscious change of course adequately indicates.” United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. King, 200 \nF. Supp. 3d 163, 169–70 (D.D.C. 2016) (citing FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. \n502, 515 (2009)); see also New Edge Network, Inc. v. FCC, 461 F.3d 1105, 1112–13 (9th Cir. \n2006) (rejecting an argument that “an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is \nobligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when \nan agency does not act in the first instance”).29 \nThe Departments note that the exemptions created here, like the exemptions created by \nthe last Administration, do not burden third parties to a degree that counsels against providing \nthe exemptions.  In addition to the apparent fact that many entities with non-religious moral \n                                                           \n29 See also Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 863–64 (1984) (“The \nfact that the agency has adopted different definitions in different contexts adds force to the argument that the \ndefinition itself is flexible, particularly since Congress has never indicated any disapproval of a flexible reading of \nthe statute.”) \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 45 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     44  \n \nobjections to the Mandate appear to only hire persons that share those objections, Congress did \nnot create a right to receive contraceptive coverage, and Congress explicitly chose not to impose \nthe section 2713 requirements on grandfathered plans benefitting millions of people.  Individuals \nwho are unable to obtain contraceptive coverage through their employer-sponsored health plans \nbecause of the exemptions created in these interim final rules, or because of other exemptions to \nthe Mandate, have other avenues for obtaining contraception, including through various other \nmechanisms by which the Government advances contraceptive coverage, particularly for low-\nincome women, and which these interim final rules leave unchanged.30  As the Government is \nunder no constitutional obligation to fund contraception, cf. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 \n(1980), even more so may the Government refrain from requiring private citizens to cover \ncontraception for other citizens in violation of their moral convictions. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 \nU.S. 173, 192–93 (1991) (“A refusal to fund protected activity, without more, cannot be equated \nwith the imposition of a ‘penalty’ on that activity.”). \nThe Departments acknowledge that coverage of contraception is an important and highly \ncontroversial issue, implicating many different views, as reflected for example in the public \ncomments received on multiple rulemakings over the course of implementation of section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act.  Our expansion of conscience protections for moral convictions, \nsimilar to protections contained in numerous statutes governing health care regulation, is not \ntaken lightly.  However, after reconsidering the interests served by the Mandate in this particular \n                                                           \n30 See, for example, Family Planning grants in 42 U.S.C. 300, et seq.; the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Program, \nPublic Law 112-74 (125 Stat 786, 1080); the Healthy Start Program, 42 U.S.C. 254c-8; the Maternal, Infant, and \nEarly Childhood Home Visiting Program, 42 U.S.C. 711; Maternal and Child Health Block Grants, 42 U.S.C. 703; \n42 U.S.C. 247b-12; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq.; the Indian Health Service, 25 \nU.S.C. 13, 42 U.S.C. 2001(a), & 25 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.; Health center grants, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), (g), (h), & (i); the \nNIH Clinical Center, 42 U.S.C. 248; and the Personal Responsibility Education Program, 42 U.S.C. 713.   \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 46 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     45  \n \ncontext, the objections raised, and the relevant Federal law, the Departments have determined \nthat expanding the exemptions to include protections for moral convictions is a more appropriate \nadministrative response than continuing to refuse to extend the exemptions and accommodations \nto certain entities and individuals for whom the Mandate violates their sincerely held moral \nconvictions.  Although the number of organizations and individuals that may seek to take \nadvantage of these exemptions and accommodations may be small, we believe that it is \nimportant formally to codify such protections for objections based on moral conviction, given the \nlong-standing recognition of such protections in health care and health insurance context in law \nand regulation and the particularly sensitive nature of these issues in the health care context. \nThese interim final rules leave unchanged HRSA’s authority to decide whether to include \ncontraceptives in the women’s preventive services Guidelines for entities that are not exempted \nby law, regulation, or the Guidelines.  These rules also do not change the many other \nmechanisms by which the Government advances contraceptive coverage, particularly for \nlow-income women. \nIII.  Provisions of the Interim Final Rules With Comment Period \nThe Departments are issuing these interim final rules in light of the full history of \nrelevant rulemaking (including 3 previous interim final rules), public comments, and the long-\nrunning litigation from non-religious moral objectors to the Mandate, as well as the information \ncontained in the companion interim final rules issued elsewhere in this issue of the Federal \nRegister.  These interim final rules seek to resolve these matters by directing HRSA, to the \nextent it requires coverage for certain contraceptive services in its Guidelines, to afford an \nexemption to certain entities and individuals with sincerely held moral convictions by which they \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 47 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     46  \n \nobject to contraceptive or sterilization coverage, and by making the accommodation process \navailable for certain organizations with such convictions.    \nFor all of the reasons discussed and referenced above, the Departments have determined \nthat the Government’s interest in applying contraceptive coverage requirements to the plans of \ncertain entities and individuals does not outweigh the sincerely held moral objections of those \nentities and individuals.  Thus, these interim final rules amend the regulations amended in both \nthe Departments’ July 2015 final regulations and in the companion interim final rules concerning \nreligious beliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules and published \nelsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.  \nThese interim final rules expand those exemptions to include additional entities and \npersons that object based on sincerely held moral convictions.  These rules leave in place \nHRSA’s discretion to continue to require contraceptive and sterilization coverage where no \nobjection specified in the regulations exists, and if section 2713 of the PHS Act otherwise \napplies.  These interim final rules also maintain the existence of an accommodation process as a \nvoluntary option for organizations with moral objections to contraceptive coverage, but \nconsistent with our expansion of the exemption, we expand eligibility for the accommodation to \ninclude organizations with sincerely held moral convictions concerning contraceptive coverage.  \nHRSA is simultaneously updating its Guidelines to reflect the requirements of these interim final \nrules.31 \n1.  Exemption for Objecting Entities Based on Moral Convictions   \n                                                           \n31 See https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ and https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines2016/index.html . \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 48 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     47  \n \nIn the new 45 CFR 147.133 as created by these interim final rules, we expand the \nexemption that was previously located in § 147.131(a), and that was expanded in § 147.132 by \nthe companion interim final rules concerning religious beliefs issued contemporaneously with \nthese interim final rules and published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.  \nWith respect to employers that sponsor group health plans, §147.133(a)(1) and (a)(1)(i) \nprovide exemptions for certain employers that object to coverage of all or a subset of \ncontraceptives or sterilization and related patient education and counseling based on sincerely \nheld moral convictions.  \nFor avoidance of doubt, the Departments wish to make clear that the expanded exemption \nin § 147.133(a) applies to several distinct entities involved in the provision of coverage to the \nobjecting employer’s employees.  This explanation is consistent with how prior rules have \nworked by means of similar language.  Section 147.133(a)(1) and (a)(1)(i), by specifying that \n“[a] group health plan and health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health \nplan” is exempt “to the extent the plan sponsor objects as specified in paragraph (a)(2),” exempt \nthe group health plans the sponsors of which object, and exempt their health insurance issuers in \nproviding the coverage in those plans (whether or not the issuers have their own objections).  \nConsequently, with respect to Guidelines issued under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv), or the parallel \nprovisions in 26 CFR 54.9815-2713T(a)(1)(iv) and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), the plan \nsponsor, issuer, and plan covered in the exemption of that paragraph would face no penalty as a \nresult of omitting contraceptive coverage from the benefits of the plan participants and \nbeneficiaries.  \nConsistent with the restated exemption, exempt entities will not be required to comply \nwith a self-certification process.  Although exempt entities do not need to file notices or \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 49 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     48  \n \ncertifications of their exemption, and these interim final rules do not impose any new notice \nrequirements on them, existing ERISA rules governing group health plans require that, with \nrespect to plans subject to ERISA, a plan document must include a comprehensive summary of \nthe benefits covered by the plan and a statement of the conditions for eligibility to receive \nbenefits.  Under ERISA, the plan document provides what benefits are provided to participants \nand beneficiaries under the plan and, therefore, if an objecting employer would like to exclude \nall or a subset of contraceptive services, it must ensure that the exclusion is clear in the plan \ndocument.  Moreover, if there is a reduction in a covered service or benefit, the plan has to \ndisclose that change to plan participants.32  Thus, where an exemption applies and all or a subset \nof contraceptive services are omitted from a plan’s coverage, otherwise applicable ERISA \ndisclosures should reflect the omission of coverage in ERISA plans.  These existing disclosure \nrequirements serve to help provide notice to participants and beneficiaries of what ERISA plans \ndo and do not cover.  The Departments invite public comment on whether exempt entities, or \nothers, would find value either in being able to maintain or submit a specific form of certification \nto claim their exemption, or in otherwise receiving guidance on a way to document their \nexemption. \nThe exemptions in § 147.133(a) apply “to the extent” of the objecting entities’ sincerely \nheld moral convictions.  Thus, entities that hold a requisite objection to covering some, but not \nall, contraceptive items would be exempt with respect to the items to which they object, but not \nwith respect to the items to which they do not object.  Likewise, the requisite objection of a plan \n                                                           \n32 See, for example, 29 USC 1022, 1024(b), 29 CFR 2520.102-2, 2520.102-3, & 2520.104b-3(d), and 29 CFR \n2590.715-2715. See also 45 CFR 147.200 (requiring disclosure of the “exceptions, reductions, and limitations of the \ncoverage,” including group health plans and group & individual issuers). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 50 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     49  \n \nsponsor or institution of higher education in § 147.133(a)(1)(i) and (ii) exempts its group health \nplan, health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer in connection with such \nplan, and its issuer in its offering of such coverage, but that exemption does not extend to \ncoverage provided by that issuer to other group health plans where the plan sponsors have no \nqualifying objection.  The objection of a health insurance issuer in § 147.133(a)(1)(iii) similarly \noperates only to the extent of its objection, and as otherwise limited as described below. \n2.  Exemption of Certain Plan Sponsors \nThe rules cover certain kinds of non-governmental employer plan sponsors with the \nrequisite objections, and the rules specify which kinds of entities qualify for the exemption.  \nUnder these interim final rules, the Departments do not limit the exemption with \nreference to nonprofit status as previous rules have done.  Many of the federal health care \nconscience statutes cited above offer protections for the moral convictions of entities without \nregard to whether they operate as nonprofits or for-profit entities.  In addition, a significant \nmajority of states either impose no contraceptive coverage requirement, or offer broader \nexemptions than the exemption contained in the July 2015 final regulations.33  States also \ngenerally protect moral convictions in health care conscience laws, and they often offer those \nprotections whether or not an entity operates as a nonprofit.34  Although the practice of states is \nby no means a limit on the discretion delegated to HRSA by the Affordbable Care Act, nor is it a \nstatement about what the Federal Government may do consistent with other protections or \nlimitations in federal law, such state practice can be informative as to the viability of offering \n                                                           \n33 See Guttmacher Institute, “Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives” (Aug. 1, 2017), available at \nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/insurance-coverage-contraceptives. \n34 See, for example, Guttmacher Institute, “Refusing to Provide Health Services” (Aug. 1, 2017), available at \nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/refusing-provide-health-services. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 51 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     50  \n \nprotections for conscientious objections in particularly sensitive health care contexts.  In this \ncase, the existence of many instances where conscience protections are offered, or no underlying \nmandate of this kind exists that could violate moral convictions, supports the Departments’ \ndecision to expand the Federal exemption concerning this Mandate as set forth in these interim \nfinal rules.  \nSection 147.133(a)(1)(i)(A) of the rules specifies that the exemption includes the plans of \na plan sponsor that is a nonprofit organization with sincerely held moral convictions.  \nSection 147.133(a)(1)(i)(B) of the rules specifies that the exemption includes the plans of \na plan sponsor that is a for-profit entity that has no publicly traded ownership interests (for this \npurpose, a publicly traded ownership interest is any class of common equity securities required \nto be registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  \nExtending the exemption to certain for-profit entities is consistent with the Supreme \nCourt’s ruling in Hobby Lobby, which declared that a corporate entity is capable of possessing \nand pursuing non-pecuniary goals (in Hobby Lobby, religion), regardless of whether the entity \noperates as a nonprofit organization, and rejecting the Departments’ argument to the contrary. \n134 S. Ct. 2768–75.  Some reports and industry experts have indicated that not many for-profit \nentities beyond those that had originally brought suit have sought relief from the Mandate after \nHobby Lobby.35  The mechanisms for determining whether a company has adopted and holds \ncertain principles or views, such as sincerely held moral convictions, is a matter of \n                                                           \n35 See Jennifer Haberkorn, “Two years later, few Hobby Lobby copycats emerge,” Politico (Oct. 11, 2016), \navailable at http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obamacare-birth-control-mandate-employers-229627. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 52 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     51  \n \nwell-established State law with respect to corporate decision-making,36 and the Departments \nexpect that application of such laws would cabin the scope of this exemption. \nThe July 2015 final regulations extended the accommodation to for-profit entities only if \nthey are closely held, by positively defining what constitutes a closely held entity.  Any such \npositive definition runs up against the myriad state differences in defining such entities, and \npotentially intrudes into a traditional area of state regulation of business organizations.  The \nDepartments implicitly recognized the difficulty of defining closely held entities in the July 2015 \nfinal regulations when we adopted a definition that included entities that are merely \n“substantially similar” to certain specified parameters, and we allowed entities that were not sure \nif they met the definition to inquire with HHS; HHS was permitted to decline to answer the \ninquiry, at which time the entity would be deemed to qualify as an eligible organization. Instead \nof attempting to positively define closely held businesses for the purpose of this rule, the \nDepartments consider it much more clear, effective, and preferable to define the category \nnegatively by reference to one element of our previous definition, namely, that the entity has no \npublicly traded ownership interest (that is, any class of common equity securities required to be \nregistered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  \nIn this way, these interim final rules differ from the exemption provided to plan sponsors \nwith objections based on sincerely held religious beliefs set forth in § 147.132(a)(1)—those \nextend to for-profit entities whether or not they are closely held or publicly traded.  The \nDepartments seek public comment on whether the exemption in § 147.133(a)(1)(i) for plan \n                                                           \n36 Although the Departments do not prescribe any form or notification, they would expect that such principles or \nviews would have been adopted and documented in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction under which they \nare incorporated or organized. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 53 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     52  \n \nsponsors with moral objections to the Mandate should be finalized to encompass all of the types \nof plan sponsors covered by § 147.132(a)(1)(i), including publicly traded corporations with \nobjections based on sincerely held moral convictions, and also non-federal governmental plan \nsponsors that may have objections based on sincerely held moral convictions.  \nIn the case of particularly sensitive health care matters, several significant federal health \ncare conscience statutes protect entities’ moral objections without precluding publicly traded and \ngovernmental entities from using those protections.  For example, the first paragraph of the \nChurch Amendments provides certain protections for entities that object based on moral \nconvictions to making their facilities or personnel available to assist in the performance of \nabortions or sterilizations, and the statute does not limit those protections based on whether the \nentities are publicly traded or governmental.  (42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b)).  Thus, under section 300a-\n7(b), a hospital in a publicly traded health system, or a local governmental hospital, could adopt \nsincerely held moral convictions by which it objects to providing facilities or personnel for \nabortions or sterilizations, and if the entity receives relevant funds from HHS specified by \nsection 300a-7(b), the protections of that section would apply.  The Coats-Snowe Amendment \nlikewise provides certain protections for health care entities and postgraduate physician training \nprograms that choose not to perform, refer for, or provide training for abortions, and the statute \ndoes not limit those protections based on whether the entities are publicly traded or \ngovernmental.  (42 U.S.C. 238n).  \nThe Weldon Amendment37 provides certain protections for health care entities, hospitals, \nprovider-sponsored organizations, health maintenance organizations, and health insurance plans \n                                                           \n37 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-31. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 54 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     53  \n \nthat do not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions, and the statute does not \nlimit those protections based on whether the entity is publicly traded or governmental.  The \nAffordable Care Act provides certain protections for any institutional health care entity, hospital, \nprovider-sponsored organization, health maintenance organization, health insurance plan, or any \nother kind of health care facility, that does not provide any health care item or service furnished \nfor the purpose of causing or assisting in causing assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing, \nand the statute similarly does not limit those protections based on whether the entity is publicly \ntraded or governmental.  (42 U.S.C. 18113).38  \nSections 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u-2(b)(3) of 42 U.S.C. protect organizations that \noffer Medicaid and Medicare Advantage managed care plans from being required to provide, \nreimburse for, or provide coverage of a counseling or referral service if they object to doing so \non moral grounds, and those paragraphs do not further specify that publicly traded entities do not \nqualify for the protections.  Congress’ most recent statement on Government requirements of \ncontraceptive coverage specified that, if the District of Columbia requires “the provision of \ncontraceptive coverage by health insurance plans,” “it is the intent of Congress that any \nlegislation enacted on such issue should include a ‘conscience clause’ which provides exceptions \nfor religious beliefs and moral convictions.” Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Division \nC, Title VIII, Sec. 808. Congress expressed no intent that such a conscience should be limited \nbased on whether the entity is publicly traded.  \nAt the same time, the Departments lack significant information about the need to extend \nthe expanded exemption further.  We have been subjected to litigation by nonprofit entities \n                                                           \n38 The lack of the limitation in this provision may be particularly relevant since it is contained in the same statute, \nthe ACA, as the provision under which the Mandate—and these exemptions to the Mandate—are promulgated. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 55 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     54  \n \nexpressing objections to the Mandate based on non-religious moral convictions, and we have \nbeen sued by closely held for-profit entities expressing religious objections.  This combination of \ndifferent types of plaintiffs leads us to believe that there may be a small number of closely held \nfor-profit entities that would seek to use an exemption to the contraceptive Mandate based on \nmoral convictions.  The fact that many closely held for-profit entities brought challenges to the \nMandate has led us to offer protections that would include publicly traded entities with religious \nobjections to the Mandate if such entities exist.  But the combined lack of any lawsuits \nchallenging the Mandate by for-profit entities with non-religious moral convictions, and of any \nlawsuits by any kind of publicly traded entity, leads us to not extend the expanded exemption in \nthese interim final rules to publicly traded entities, but rather to invite public comment on \nwhether to do so in a way parallel to the protections set forth in § 147.132(a)(1)(i).  We agree \nwith the Supreme Court that it is improbable that many publicly traded companies with \nnumerous “unrelated shareholders—including institutional investors with their own set of \nstakeholders—would agree to run a corporation under the same religious beliefs” (or moral \nconvictions) and thereby qualify for the exemption. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2774.  We are \nalso not aware of other types of plan sponsors (such as non-Federal governmental entities) that \nmight possess moral objections to compliance with the Mandate, including whether some might \nconsider certain contraceptive methods as having a possible abortifacient effect.  Nevertheless, \nwe would welcome any comments on whether such corporations or other plan sponsors exist and \nwould benefit from such an exemption. \nDespite our a lack of complete information, the Departments know that nonprofit entities \nhave challenged the Mandate, and we assume that a closely held business might wish to assert \nnon-religious moral convictions in objecting to the Mandate (although we anticipate very few if \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 56 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     55  \n \nany will do so).  Thus we have chosen in these interim final rules to include them in the \nexpanded exemption and thereby remove an obstacle preventing such entities from claiming an \nexemption based on non-religious moral convictions.  But we are less certain that we need to use \nthese interim final rules to extend the expanded exemption for moral convictions to encompass \nother kinds of plan sponsors not included in the protections of these interim final rules.  \nTherefore, with respect to plan sponsors not included in the expanded exemptions of  \n§ 147.133(a)(1)(i), and non-federal governmental plan sponsors that might have moral objections \nto the Mandate, we invite public comment on whether to include such entities when we finalize \nthese rules at a later date.  \nThe Departments further conclude that it would be inadequate to merely provide entities \naccess to the accommodation process instead of to the exemption where those entities object to \nthe Mandate based on sincerely held moral convictions.  The Departments have stated in our \nregulations and court briefings that the existing accommodation with respect to self-insured plans \nrequires contraceptive coverage as part of the same plan as the coverage provided by the \nemployer, and operates in a way “seamless” to those plans.  As a result, in significant respects, \nthe accommodation process does not actually accommodate the objections of many entities.  This \nhas led many religious groups to challenge the accommodation in court, and we expect similar \nchallenges would come from organizations objecting to the accommodation based on moral \nconvictions if we offered them the accommodation but not an exemption.  When we took that \nnarrow approach with religious nonprofit entities it led to multiple cases in many courts that we \nneeded to litigate to the Supreme Court various times.  Although objections to the \naccommodation were not specifically litigated in the two cases brought by nonprofit non-\nreligious organizations (because we have not even made them eligible for the accommodation), \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 57 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     56  \n \nthose organizations made it clear that they and their employees strongly oppose coverage of \ncertain contraceptives in their plans and in connection with their plans. \n3.  Exemption for Institutions of Higher Education  \nThe plans of institutions of higher education that arrange student health insurance \ncoverage will be treated similarly to the way that plans of employers are treated for the purposes \nof such plans being exempt or accommodated based on moral convictions.  These interim final \nrules specify, in § 147.133(a)(1)(ii), that the exemption is extended, in the case of institutions of \nhigher education (as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1002), to their arrangement of student health insurance \ncoverage, in a manner comparable to the applicability of the exemption for group health \ninsurance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan established or maintained by \na plan sponsor.  \nThe Departments are not aware of institutions of higher education that arrange student \ncoverage and object to the Mandate based on non-religious moral convictions.  We have been \nsued by several institutions of higher education that arrange student coverage and object to the \nMandate based on religious beliefs.  We believe the existence of such entities with non-religious \nmoral objections, or the possible formation of such entities in the future, is sufficiently possible \nso that we should provide protections for them in these interim final rules.  But based on a lack \nof information about such entities, we assume that none will use the exemption concerning \nstudent coverage at this time. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 58 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     57  \n \n4. Exemption for Issuers \nThese interim final rules extend the exemption, in § 147.133(a)(1)(iii), to health \ninsurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage that sincerely hold their \nown moral convictions opposed to providing coverage for contraceptive services.  \nAs discussed above, where the exemption for plan sponsors or institutions of higher \neducation applies, issuers are exempt under those sections with respect to providing coverage in \nthose plans.  The issuer exemption in § 147.133(a)(1)(iii) adds to that protection, but the \nadditional protection operates in a different way than the plan sponsor exemption operates.  The \nonly plan sponsors, or in the case of individual insurance coverage, individuals, who are eligible \nto purchase or enroll in health insurance coverage offered by an exempt issuer that does not \ncover some or all contraceptive services are plan sponsors or individuals who themselves object \nand are otherwise exempt based on their objection (whether the objection is based on moral \nconvictions, as set forth in these rules, or on religious beliefs, as set forth in exemptions created \nby the companion interim final rules published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register).  \nThus, the issuer exemption specifies that where a health insurance issuer providing group health \ninsurance coverage is exempt under paragraph (a)(1)(iii), the plan remains subject to any \nrequirement to provide coverage for contraceptive services under Guidelines issued under  \n§ 147.130(a)(1)(iv) unless the plan is otherwise exempt from that requirement.  Accordingly, the \nonly plan sponsors, or in the case of individual insurance coverage, individuals, who are eligible \nto purchase or enroll in health insurance coverage offered by an issuer that is exempt under this \nparagraph (a)(1)(iii) that does not include some or all contraceptive services are plan sponsors or \nindividuals who themselves object and are exempt.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 59 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     58  \n \nUnder the rules as amended, issuers with objections based on sincerely held moral \nconvictions could issue policies that omit contraception to plan sponsors or individuals that are \notherwise exempt based on either their religious beliefs or their moral convictions, and issuers \nwith sincerely held religious beliefs could likewise issue policies that omit contraception to plan \nsponsors or individuals that are otherwise exempt based on either their religious beliefs or their \nmoral convictions.  \nIssuers that hold moral objections should identify to plan sponsors the lack of \ncontraceptive coverage in any health insurance coverage being offered that is based on the \nissuer’s exemption, and communicate the group health plan’s independent obligation to provide \ncontraceptive coverage, unless the group health plan itself is exempt under regulations governing \nthe Mandate.  \nIn this way, the issuer exemption serves to protect objecting issuers both from being \nasked or required to issue policies that cover contraception in violation of the issuers’ sincerely \nheld moral convictions, and from being asked or required to issue policies that omit \ncontraceptive coverage to non-exempt entities or individuals, thus subjecting the issuers to \npotential liability if those plans are not exempt from the Guidelines.  At the same time, the issuer \nexemption will not serve to remove contraceptive coverage obligations from any plan or plan \nsponsor that is not also exempt, nor will it prevent other issuers from being required to provide \ncontraceptive coverage in individual insurance coverage.  Protecting issuers that object to \noffering contraceptive coverage based on sincerely held moral convictions will help preserve \nspace in the health insurance market for certain issuers so that exempt plan sponsors and \nindividuals will be able to obtain coverage.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 60 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     59  \n \nThe Departments are not currently aware of health insurance issuers that possess their \nown religious or moral objections to offering contraceptive coverage.  Nevertheless, many \nFederal health care conscience laws and regulations protect issuers or plans specifically. For \nexample, as discussed above, 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u-2(b)(3) protect plans or \nmanaged care organizations in Medicaid or Medicare Advantage.  The Weldon Amendment \nprotects HMOs, health insurance plans, and any other health care organizations from being \nrequired to provide coverage or pay for abortions. See, for example, Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-31.  The most recently \nenacted Consolidated Appropriations Act declares that Congress supports a “conscience clause” \nto protect moral convictions concerning “the provision of contraceptive coverage by health \ninsurance plans.” See id. at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808.  \nThe issuer exemption does not specifically include third party administrators, for the \nreasons discussed in the companion interim final rules concerning religious beliefs issued \ncontemporaneously with these interim final rules and published elsewhere in this issue of the \nFederal Register.  The Departments solicit public comment; however, on whether there are \nsituations where there may be an additional need to provide distinct protections for third party \nadministrators that may have moral convictions implicated by the Mandate.39 \n5. Scope of Objections Needed for the Objecting Entity Exemption \n                                                           \n39 The exemption for issuers, as outlined here, does not make a distinction among issuers based on whether they are \npublicly traded, unlike the plan sponsor exemption for business entities. Because the issuer exemption operates more \nnarrowly than the exemption for business plan sponsors operates, in the ways described here, and exists in part to \nhelp preserve market options for objecting plan sponsors, the Departments consider it appropriate to not draw such a \ndistinction among issuers. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 61 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     60  \n \nExemptions for objecting entities specify that they apply where the entities object as \nspecified in § 147.133(a)(2).  That section specifies that exemptions for objecting entities will \napply to the extent that an entity described in § 147.133(a)(1) objects to its establishing, \nmaintaining, providing, offering, or arranging (as applicable) for coverage, payments, or a plan \nthat provides coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services, based on its sincerely \nheld moral convictions.  \n6.  Individual Exemption \nThese interim final rules include a special rule pertaining to individuals (referred to here \nas the “individual exemption”).  Section 147.133(b) provides that nothing in §147.130(a)(1)(iv), \n26 CFR 54.9815-2713T(a)(1)(iv) and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), may be construed to \nprevent a willing plan sponsor of a group health plan and/or a willing health insurance issuer \noffering group or individual health insurance coverage, from offering a separate benefit package \noption, or a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance, to any individual who objects to \ncoverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services based on the individual’s sincerely \nheld moral convictions.  The individual exemption extends to the coverage unit in which the plan \nparticipant, or subscriber in the individual market, is enrolled (for instance, to family coverage \ncovering the participant and his or her beneficiaries enrolled under the plan), but does not relieve \nthe plan’s or issuer’s obligation to comply with the Mandate with respect to the group health plan \nat large or, as applicable, to any other individual policies the issuer offers.  \nThis individual exemption allows plan sponsors and issuers that do not specifically object \nto contraceptive coverage to offer morally acceptable coverage to their participants or \nsubscribers who do object, while offering coverage that includes contraception to participants or \nsubscribers who do not object.  This individual exemption can apply with respect to individuals \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 62 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     61  \n \nin plans sponsored by private employers or governmental employers.  For example, in one case \nbrought against the Departments, the State of Missouri enacted a law under which the State is not \npermitted to discriminate against insurance issuers that offer health plans without coverage for \ncontraception based on employees’ moral convictions, or against the individual employees who \naccept such offers. See Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1015–16 (quoting Mo. Rev. Stat. 191.724). \nUnder the individual exemption of these interim final rules, employers sponsoring governmental \nplans would be free to honor the sincerely held moral objections of individual employees by \noffering them plans that omit contraception, even if those governmental entities do not object to \noffering contraceptive coverage in general. \nThis “individual exemption” cannot be used to force a plan (or its sponsor) or an issuer to \nprovide coverage omitting contraception, or, with respect to health insurance coverage, to \nprevent the application of state law that requires coverage of such contraceptives or sterilization.  \nNor can the individual exemption be construed to require the guaranteed availability of coverage \nomitting contraception to a plan sponsor or individual who does not have a sincerely held moral \nobjection.  This individual exemption is limited to the requirement to provide contraceptive \ncoverage under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, and does not affect any other federal or state \nlaw governing the plan or coverage.  Thus, if there are other applicable laws or plan terms \ngoverning the benefits, these interim final rules do not affect such other laws or terms. \nThe Departments believe the individual exemption will help to meet the Affordable Care \nAct’s goal of increasing health coverage because it will reduce the incidence of certain \nindividuals choosing to forego health coverage because the only coverage available would \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 63 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     62  \n \nviolate their sincerely held moral convictions.40  At the same time, this individual exemption \n“does not undermine the governmental interests furthered by the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement,”41 because, when the exemption is applicable, the individual does not want the \ncoverage, and therefore would not use the objectionable items even if they were covered.  In \naddition, because the individual exemption only operates when the employer and/or issuer, as \napplicable, are willing, the exemption will not undermine any governmental interest in the \nworkability of the insurance market, because we expect that any workability concerns will be \ntaken into account in the decision of whether to be willing to offer the individual morally \nacceptable coverage.  \nFor similar reasons, we have changed our position and now believe the individual \nexemption will not undermine any Government interest in uniformity in the health insurance \nmarket.  At the level of plan offerings, the extent to which plans cover contraception under the \nprior rules is already far from uniform.  The Congress did not require compliance with section \n2713 of the PHS Act by all entities—in particular by grandfathered plans.  The Departments’ \nprevious exemption for houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries, and our accommodation of \nself-insured church plans, show that the importance of a uniform health insurance system is not \nsignificantly harmed by allowing plans to omit contraception in many contexts.42 \n                                                           \n40 This prospect has been raised in cases of religious individuals—see, for example, Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at \n1017, and March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 130—where the courts noted that the individual employee plaintiffs \nindicated that they viewed the Mandate as pressuring them to “forgo health insurance altogether.” \n41 78 FR 39874. \n42 See also Real Alternatives, 2017 WL 3324690 at *36 (3d Cir. Aug. 4, 2017) (Jordan, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part) (“Because insurance companies would offer such plans as a result of market forces, doing so \nwould not undermine the government's interest in a sustainable and functioning market.… Because the government \nhas failed to demonstrate why allowing such a system (not unlike the one that allowed wider choice before the \nACA) would be unworkable, it has not satisfied strict scrutiny.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 64 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     63  \n \nWith respect to operationalizing this provision of these rules, as well as the similar \nprovision protecting individuals with religious objections to purchasing insurance that covers \nsome or all contraceptives, in the interim final rules published elsewhere in this issue of the \nFederal Register, the Departments note that a plan sponsor or health insurance issuer is not \nrequired to offer separate and different benefit package options, or separate and different forms \nof policy, certificate, or contract of insurance with respect to those individuals who object on \nmoral bases from those who object on religious bases.  That is, a willing employer or issuer may \noffer the same benefit package option or policy, certificate, or contract of insurance—which \nexcludes the same scope of some or all contraceptive coverage—to individuals who are exempt \nfrom the Mandate because of their moral convictions (under these rules) or their religious beliefs \n(under the regulations as amended by the interim final rules pertaining to religious beliefs). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 65 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     64  \n \n7.  Optional Accommodation \nIn addition to expanding the exemption to those with sincerely held moral convictions, \nthese rules also expand eligibility for the optional accommodation process to include employers \nwith objections based on sincerely held moral convictions.  This is accomplished by inserting \nreferences to the newly added exemption for moral convictions, 45 CFR 147.133, into the \nregulatory sections where the accommodation process is codified, 45 CFR 147.131, 26 CFR \n54.9815-2713AT, and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A.  In all other respects the accommodation \nprocess works the same as it does for entities with objections based on sincerely held religious \nbeliefs, as described in the companion interim final rules concerning religious beliefs issued \ncontemporaneously with these interim final rules and published elsewhere in this issue of the \nFederal Register.  \nThe Departments are not aware of entities with objections to the Mandate based on \nsincerely held moral convictions that wish to make use of the optional accommodation, and our \npresent assumption is that no such entities will seek to use the accommodation rather than the \nexemption.  But if such entities do wish to use the accommodation, making it available to them \nwill both provide contraceptive coverage to their plan participants and respect those entities’ \nobjections.  Because entities with objections to the Mandate based on sincerely held non-\nreligious moral convictions have not previously had access to the accommodation, they would \nnot be in a position to revoke their use of the accommodation at the time these interim final rules \nare issued, but could do so in the future under the same parameters set forth in the \naccommodation regulations.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 66 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     65  \n \n8.  Regulatory Restatements of section 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PHS Act \nThese interim final rules insert references to 45 CFR 147.133 into the restatements of the \nrequirements of section 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PHS Act, contained in 26 CFR 54.9815-\n2713T(a)(1) introductory text and (a)(1)(iv), 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1) introductory text and \n(a)(1)(iv), and 45 CFR 147.130(a)(1) and (a)(1)(iv).   \n9.  Conclusion \nThe Departments believe that the Guidelines, and the expanded exemptions and \naccommodations set forth in these interim final rules, will advance the legitimate but limited \npurposes for which Congress imposed section 2713 of the PHS Act, while acting consistently \nwith Congress’ well-established record of allowing for moral exemptions with respect to various \nhealth care matters.  These interim final rules maintain HRSA’s discretion to decide whether to \ncontinue to require contraceptive coverage under the Guidelines if no regulatorily recognized \nexemption exists (and in plans where Congress applied section 2713 of the PHS Act).  As cited \nabove, these interim final rules also leave fully in place over a dozen Federal programs that \nprovide, or subsidize, contraceptives for women, including for low income women based on \nfinancial need.  The Departments believe this array of programs and requirements better serves \nthe interests of providing contraceptive coverage while protecting the moral convictions of \nentities and individuals concerning coverage of some or all contraceptive or sterilization \nservices.  \nThe Departments request and encourage public comments on all matters addressed in \nthese interim final rules. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 67 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     66  \n \nIV.  Interim Final Rules, Request for Comments and Waiver of Delay of Effective \nDate \nSection 9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the PHS Act \nauthorize the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS (collectively, the Secretaries) to \npromulgate any interim final rules that they determine are appropriate to carry out the provisions \nof chapter 100 of the Code, part 7 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, and part A of title XXVII of \nthe PHS Act, which include sections 2701 through 2728 of the PHS Act and the incorporation of \nthose sections into section 715 of ERISA and section 9815 of the Code.  These interim final rules \nfall under those statutory authorized justifications, as did previous rules on this matter (75 FR \n41726; 76 FR 46621; and 79 FR 51092). \nSection 553(b) of the APA requires notice and comment rulemaking, involving a notice \nof proposed rulemaking and a comment period prior to finalization of regulatory requirements – \nexcept when an agency, for good cause, finds that notice and public comment thereon are \nimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.  These provisions of the APA do \nnot apply here because of the specific authority granted to the Secretaries by section 9833 of the \nCode, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the PHS Act.  \nEven if these provisions of the APA applied, they would be satisfied:  The Departments \nhave determined that it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay \nputting these provisions in place until a full public notice-and-comment process is completed. As \ndiscussed earlier, the Departments have issued three interim final rules implementing this section \nof the PHS Act because of the immediate needs of covered entities and the weighty matters \nimplicated by the HRSA Guidelines.  As recently as December 20, 2016, HRSA updated those \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 68 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     67  \n \nGuidelines without engaging in the regulatory process (because doing so is not a legal \nrequirement), and announced that it plans to so continue to update the Guidelines.  \nTwo lawsuits have been pending for several years by entities raising non-religious moral \nobjections to the Mandate.43  In one of those cases, the Departments are subject to a permanent \ninjunction and the appeal of that case has been stayed since February 2016.  In the other case, \nFederal district and appeals courts ruled in favor of the Departments, denying injunctive relief to \nthe plaintiffs, and that case is also still pending.  Based on the public comments the Departments \nhave received, we have reason to believe that some similar nonprofit entities might exist, even if \nit is likely a small number.44  \nFor entities and individuals facing a burden on their sincerely held moral convictions, \nproviding them relief from Government regulations that impose such a burden is an important \nand urgent matter, and delay in doing so injures those entities in ways that cannot be repaired \nretroactively.  The burdens of the existing rules undermine these entities’ and individuals’ \nparticipation in the health care market because they provide them with a serious disincentive—\nindeed a crisis of conscience—between participating in or providing quality and affordable \nhealth insurance coverage and being forced to violate their sincerely held moral convictions.  \nThe existence of inconsistent court rulings in multiple proceedings has also caused confusion and \nuncertainty that has extended for several years, with different federal courts taking different \npositions on whether entities with moral objections are entitled to relief from the Mandate. \n                                                           \n43 March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116; Real Alternatives, 867 F.3d 338. \n44 See, for example, Americans United for Life (“AUL”) Comment on CMA-9992-IFC2 at 10 (Nov. 1, 2011), \navailable at \nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=HHS-OS-2011-0023-59496, and AUL Comment on CMS-9968-P \nat 5 (Apr. 8, 2013), available at http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CMS-2012-0031-79115. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 69 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     68  \n \nDelaying the availability of the expanded exemption would require entities to bear these burdens \nfor many more months.  Continuing to apply the Mandate’s regulatory burden on individuals and \norganizations with moral convictions objecting to compliance with the Mandate also serves as a \ndeterrent for citizens who might consider forming new entities consistent with their moral \nconvictions and offering health insurance through those entities.  \nMoreover, we separately expanded exemptions to protect religious beliefs in the \ncompanion interim final rules issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules and \npublished elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.  Because Congress has provided many \nstatutes that protect religious beliefs and moral convictions similarly in certain health care \ncontexts, it is important not to delay the expansion of exemptions for moral convictions set forth \nin these rules, since the companion rules provide protections for religious beliefs on an interim \nfinal basis. Otherwise, our regulations would simultaneously provide and deny relief to entities \nand individuals that are, in the Departments’ view, similarly deserving of exemptions and \naccommodations consistent, with similar protections in other federal laws.  This could cause \nsimilarly situated entities and individuals to be burdened unequally.  \nIn response to several of the previous rules on this issue—including three issued as \ninterim final rules under the statutory authority cited above—the Departments received more \nthan 100,000 public comments on multiple occasions.  Those comments included extensive \ndiscussion about whether and to what extent to expand the exemption.  Most recently, on \nJuly 26, 2016, the Departments issued a request for information (81 FR 47741) and received over \n54,000 public comments about different possible ways to resolve these issues.  As noted above, \nthe public comments in response to both the RFI and various prior rulemaking proceedings \nincluded specific requests that the exemptions be expanded to include those who oppose the \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 70 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     69  \n \nMandate for either religious or “moral” reasons.45  In connection with past regulations, the \nDepartments have offered or expanded a temporary safe harbor allowing organizations that were \nnot exempt from the HRSA Guidelines to operate out of compliance with the Guidelines.  The \nDepartments will fully consider comments submitted in response to these interim final rules, but \nbelieve that good cause exists to issue the rules on an interim final basis before the comments are \nsubmitted and reviewed. Issuing interim final rules with a comment period provides the public \nwith an opportunity to comment on whether these regulations expanding the exemption should \nbe made permanent or subject to modification without delaying the effective date of the \nregulations. \nAs the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stated with respect to an earlier IFR \npromulgated with respect to this issue in Priests for Life v. U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services, 772 F.3d 229, 276 (D.C. Cir. 2014), vacated on other grounds, Zubik v. \nBurwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016), “[S]everal reasons support HHS’s decision not to engage in \nnotice and comment here.” Among other things, the Court noted that “the agency made a good \ncause finding in the rule it issued”; that “the regulations the interim final rule modifies were \nrecently enacted pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking, and presented virtually identical \nissues”; that “HHS will expose its interim rule to notice and comment before its permanent \nimplementation”; and that not proceeding under interim final rules would “delay the \nimplementation of the alternative opt-out for religious objectors.” Id. at 277. Similarly, not \n                                                           \n45 See, for example, http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=HHS-OS-2011-0023-59496,  \nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CMS-2012-0031-79115, \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-54142, \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-54218, and \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-46220. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 71 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     70  \n \nproceeding with exemptions and accommodations for moral objectors here would delay the \nimplementation of those alternative opt-outs for moral objectors. \nDelaying the availability of the expanded exemption could also increase the costs of \nhealth insurance for some entities.  As reflected in litigation pertaining to the Mandate, some \nentities are in grandfathered health plans that do not cover contraception.  As such, they may \nwish to make changes to their health plans that will reduce the costs of insurance coverage for \ntheir beneficiaries or policyholders, but which would cause the plans to lose grandfathered status. \nTo the extent that entities with objections to the Mandate based on moral convictions but not \nreligious beliefs fall into this category, they may be refraining from making those changes—and \ntherefore may be continuing to incur and pass on higher insurance costs—to prevent the Mandate \nfrom applying to their plans in violation of their consciences.  We are not aware of the extent to \nwhich such entities exist, but 17 percent of all covered workers are in grandfathered health plans, \nencompassing tens of millions of people.46  Issuing these rules on an interim final basis reduces \nthe costs of health insurance and regulatory burdens for such entities and their plan participants.  \nThese interim final rules also expand access to the optional accommodation process for \ncertain entities with objections to the Mandate based on moral convictions.  If entities exist that \nwish to use that process, the Departments believe they should be able to do so without the delay \nthat would be involved by not offering them the optional accommodation process by use of \ninterim final rules.  Proceeding otherwise could delay the provision of contraceptive coverage to \nthose entities’ employees. \n                                                           \n46 Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits, 2017 Annual \nSurvey,” available at http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-2017. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 72 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     71  \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Departments have determined that it would be \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest to engage in full notice and comment \nrulemaking before putting these interim final rules into effect, and that it is in the public interest \nto promulgate interim final rules.  For the same reasons, the Departments have determined, \nconsistent with section 553(d) of the APA (5 U.S.C. 553(d)), that there is good cause to make \nthese interim final rules effective immediately upon filing for public inspection at the Office of \nthe Federal Register. \nV.  Economic Impact and Paperwork Burden \nWe have examined the impacts of the interim final rules as required by Executive Order \n12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 on \nImproving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011),, the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub.

L. 104-4), \nExecutive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999), the Congressional Review Act (5 \nU.S.C. 804(2)and Executive Order 13771 on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory \nCosts (January 30, 2017).  \nA.  Executive Orders 12866 and 13563—Department of HHS and Department of Labor \nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of \navailable regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches \nthat maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, and public health and \nsafety effects; distributive impacts; and equity).  Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the \nimportance of quantifying both costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and \npromoting flexibility. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 73 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     72  \n \nSection 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a “significant regulatory action” as an \naction that is likely to result in a regulation:  (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 \nmillion or more in any 1 year, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, \nproductivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal \ngovernments or communities (also referred to as “economically significant”); (2) creating a \nserious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; \n(3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan programs or \nthe rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising \nout of legal mandates, the President’s priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. \nA regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for major rules with economically \nsignificant effects ($100 million or more in any one year), and an “economically significant” \nregulatory action is subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). As \ndiscussed below regarding anticipated effects of these rules and the Paperwork Reduction Act, \nthese interim final rules are not likely to have economic impacts of $100 million or more in any \none year, and therefore do not meet the definition of “economically significant” under Executive \nOrder 12866.  However, OMB has determined that the actions are significant within the meaning \nof section 3(f)(4) of the Executive Order.  Therefore, OMB has reviewed these final regulations \nand the Departments have provided the following assessment of their impact. .  \n1.  Need for Regulatory Action \nThese interim final rules amend the Departments’ July 2015 final regulations and do so in \nconjunction with the amendments made in the companion interim final rules concerning religious \nbeliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules and published elsewhere in this \nissue of the Federal Register.  These interim final rules expand the exemption from the \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 74 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     73  \n \nrequirement to provide coverage for contraceptives and sterilization, established under the HRSA \nGuidelines, promulgated under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, section 715(a)(1) of the \nERISA, and section 9815(a)(1) of the Code, to include certain entities and individuals with \nobjections to compliance with the Mandate based on sincerely held moral convictions, and they \nrevise the accommodation process to make entities with such convictions eligible to use it.  The \nexpanded exemption would apply to certain individuals, nonprofit entities, institutions of higher \neducation, issuers, and for-profit entities that do not have publicly traded ownership interests, \nthat have a moral objection to providing coverage for some (or all) of the contraceptive and/or \nsterilization services covered by the Guidelines.  Such action is taken, among other reasons, to \nprovide for conscientious participation in the health insurance market free from penalties for \nviolating sincerely held moral convictions opposed to providing or receiving coverage of \ncontraceptive services, to resolve lawsuits that have been filed against the Departments by some \nsuch entities, and to avoid similar legal challenges. \n2.  Anticipated Effects \nThe Departments acknowledge that expanding the exemption to include objections based \non moral convictions might result in less insurance coverage of contraception for some women \nwho may want the coverage.  Although the Departments do not know the exact scope of that \neffect attributable to the moral exemption in these interim final rules, they believe it to be small.  \nWith respect to the expanded exemption for nonprofit organizations, as noted above the \nDepartments are aware of two small nonprofit organizations that have filed lawsuits raising non-\nreligious moral objections to coverage of some contraceptives.  Both of those entities have fewer \nthan five employees enrolled in health coverage, and both require all of their employees to agree \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 75 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     74  \n \nwith their opposition to the coverage.47  Based on comments submitted in response to prior \nrulemakings on this subject, we believe that at least one other similar entity exists.  However, we \ndo not know how many similar entities exist. Lacking other information we assume that the \nnumber is small.  Without data to estimate the number of such entities, we believe it to be less \nthan 10, and assume the exemption will be used by nine nonprofit entities.  \nWe also assume that those nine entities will operate in a fashion similar to the two similar \nentities of which we are aware, so that their employees will likely share their views against \ncoverage of certain contraceptives.  This is consistent with our conclusion in previous rules that \nno significant burden or costs would result from exempting houses of worship and integrated \nauxiliaries. (See 76 FR 46625 and 78 FR 39889).  We reached that conclusion without ultimately \nrequiring that houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries only hire persons who agree with their \nviews against contraception, and without even requiring that such entities actually oppose \ncontraception in order to be exempt (in contrast, the expanded exemption here requires the \nexempt entity to actually possess sincerely held moral convictions objecting to the coverage).  In \nconcluding that the exemption for houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries would result in no \nsignificant burden or costs, we relied on our assumption that the employees of exempt houses of \nworship and integrated auxiliaries likely share their employers’ opposition to contraceptive \ncoverage.  \nA similar assumption is supported with respect to the expanded exemption for nonprofit \norganizations.  To our knowledge, the vast majority of organizations objecting to the Mandate \n                                                           \n47 Non-religious nonprofit organizations that engage in expressive activity generally have a First Amendment right \nto hire only people who share their moral convictions or will be respectful of them—including their convictions on \nwhether the organization or others provide health coverage of contraception, or of certain items they view as being \nabortifacient. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 76 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     75  \n \nassert religious beliefs.  The only nonprofit organizations of which we are aware that possess \nnon-religious moral convictions against some or all contraceptive methods only hire persons who \nshare their convictions.  It is possible that the exemption for nonprofit organizations with moral \nconvictions in these interim final rules could be used by a nonprofit organization that employs \npersons who do not share the organization’s views on contraception, but it was also possible \nunder our previous rules that a house of worship or integrated auxiliary could employ persons \nwho do not share their views on contraception.48  Although we are unable to find sufficient data \non this issue, we believe that there are far fewer non-religious moral nonprofit organizations \nopposed to contraceptive coverage than there are churches with religious objections to such \ncoverage.  Based on our limited data, we believe the most likely effect of the expanded \nexemption for nonprofit entities is that it will be used by entities similar to the two entities that \nhave sought an exemption through litigation, and whose employees also oppose the coverage. \nTherefore, we expect that the expanded exemption for nonprofit entities will have no effect of \nreducing contraceptive coverage to employees who want that coverage.  \nThese interim final rules expand the exemption to include institutions of higher education \nthat arrange student coverage and have non-religious moral objections to the Mandate, and they \nmake exempt entities with moral objections eligible to use the accommodation.  The \nDepartments are not aware of either kind of entity.  We believe the number of entities that object \nto the Mandate based on non-religious moral convictions is already very small.  The only entities \nof which we are aware that have raised such objections are not institutions of higher education, \n                                                           \n48 Cf., for example, Gallup, “Americans, Including Catholics, Say Birth Control Is Morally OK,” (May 22, 2012) \n(“Eighty-two percent of U.S. Catholics say birth control is morally acceptable”), available at \nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/154799/americans-including-catholics-say-birth-control-morally.aspx. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 77 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     76  \n \nand appear to hold objections that we assume would likely lead them to reject the \naccommodation process.  Therefore, for the purposes of estimating the anticipated effect of these \ninterim final rules on contraceptive coverage of women who wish to receive such coverage, we \nassume that—at this time—no entities with non-religious moral objections to the Mandate will \nbe institutions of higher education that arrange student coverage, and no entities with non-\nreligious moral objections will opt into the accommodation.  We wish to make the expanded \nexemption and accommodation available to such entities in case they do exist or might come into \nexistence, based on similar reasons to those given above for why the exemptions and \naccommodations are extended to other entities.  We invite public comment on whether and how \nmany such entities will make use of these interim final rules. \nThe expanded exemption for issuers will not result in a distinct effect on contraceptive \ncoverage for women who wish to receive it because that exemption only applies in cases where \nplan sponsors or individuals are also otherwise exempt, and the effect of those exemptions is \ndiscussed elsewhere herein.  The expanded exemption for individuals that oppose contraceptive \ncoverage based on sincerely held moral convictions will provide coverage that omits \ncontraception for individuals that object to contraceptive coverage. \nThe expanded moral exemption would also cover for-profit entities that do not have \npublicly traded ownership interests, and that have non-religious moral objections to the Mandate. \nThe Departments are not aware of any for-profit entities that possess non-religious moral \nobjections to the Mandate.  However, scores of for-profit entities have filed suit challenging the \nMandate.  Among the over 200 entities that brought legal challenges, only two entities (less than \n1 percent) raised non-religious moral objections—both were nonprofit.  Among the general \npublic polls vary about religious beliefs, but one prominent poll shows that 89 percent of \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 78 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     77  \n \nAmericans say they believe in God.49  Among non-religious persons, only a very small \npercentage appears to hold moral objections to contraception.  A recent study found that only 2 \npercent of religiously unaffiliated persons believed using contraceptives is morally wrong.50 \nCombined, this suggests that 0.2 percent of Americans at most51 might believe contraceptives are \nmorally wrong based on moral convictions but not religious beliefs.  We have no information \nabout how many of those persons run closely held businesses, offer employer sponsored health \ninsurance, and would make use of the expanded exemption for moral convictions set forth in \nthese interim final rules.  Given the large number of closely held entities that challenged the \nMandate based on religious objections, we assume that some similar for-profit entities with non-\nreligious moral objections exist.  But we expect that it will be a comparatively small number of \nentities, since among the nonprofit litigants, only two were non-religious.  Without data available \nto estimate the actual number of entities that will make use of the expanded exemption for for-\nprofit entities that do not have publicly traded ownership interests and that have objections to the \nMandate based on sincerely held moral convictions, we expect that fewer than 10 entities, if any, \nwill do so—we assume nine for-profit entities will use the exemption in these interim final rules.  \nThe expanded exemption encompassing certain for-profit entities could result in the \nremoval of contraceptive coverage from women who do not share their employers’ views.  The \nDepartments used data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Medical Expenditure \nPanel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) to obtain an estimate of the number of \n                                                           \n49 Gallup, “Most Americans Still Believe in God” (June 14–23, 2016), available at \nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/193271/americans-believe-god.aspx.  \n50 Pew Research Center, “Where the Public Stands on Religious Liberty vs. Nondiscrimination” at page 26 (Sept. \n28, 2016), available at http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/09/Religious-Liberty-full-for-\nweb.pdf.  \n51 The study defined religiously “unaffiliated” as agnostic, atheist or “nothing in particular” (id. at 8), as distinct \nfrom several versions of Protestants, or Catholics. “Nothing in particular” might have included some theists. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 79 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     78  \n \npolicyholders that will be covered by the plans of the nine for-profit entities we assume may \nmake use of these expanded exemptions.52  The average number of policyholders (9) in plans \nwith under 100 employees was obtained.  It is not known what size the for-profit employers will \nbe that might claim this exemption, but as discussed above these interim final rules do not \ninclude publicly traded companies (and we invite public comments on whether to do so in the \nfinal rules), and both of the two nonprofit entities that challenged the Mandate included fewer \nthan five policyholders in each entity.  Therefore we assume the for-profit entities that may claim \nthis expanded exemption will have fewer than 100 employees and an average of 9 policyholders. \nFor nine entities, the total number of policyholders would be 81.  DOL estimates that for each \npolicyholder, there is approximately one dependent.53  This amounts to 162 covered persons. \nCensus data indicate that women of childbearing age—that is, women aged 15–44—comprise \n20.2 percent of the general population.54  This amounts to approximately 33 women of \nchildbearing age for this group of individuals covered by group plans sponsored by for-profit \nmoral objectors.  Approximately 44.3 percent of women currently use contraceptives covered by \nthe Guidelines.55  Thus we estimate that 15 women may incur contraceptive costs due to for-\n                                                           \n52 \"Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin\" Table 4, page 21.

The Guidelines’ requirement of contraceptive \ncoverage only applies “for all women with reproductive capacity.” https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/; see \nalso 80 FR 40318. In addition, studies commonly consider the 15–44 age range to assess contraceptive use by \nwomen of childbearing age. See,., Guttmacher Institute, “Contraceptive Use in the United States” (Sept. 2016), \navailable at https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. \n55 See https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 80 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     79  \n \nprofit entities using the expanded exemption provided in these interim final rules.56  In the \ncompanion interim final rules concerning religious beliefs issued contemporaneously with these \ninterim final rules and published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, we estimate \nthat the average cost of contraception per year per woman of childbearing age that use \ncontraception covered by the Guidelines, within health plans that cover contraception, is $584.  \nConsequently, we estimate that the anticipated effects attributable to the cost of contraception \nfrom for-profit entities using the expanded exemption in these interim final rules is \napproximately $8,760.  \nThe Departments estimate that these interim final rules will not result in any additional \nburden or costs on issuers or third party administrators.  As discussed above, we assume that no \nentities with non-religious moral convictions will use the accommodation, although we wish to \nmake it available in case an entity voluntarily opts into it in order to allow contraceptive \ncoverage to be provided to its plan participants and beneficiaries.  Finally, because the \naccommodation process was not previously available to entities that possess non-religious moral \nobjections to the Mandate, we do not anticipate that these interim final rules will result in any \nburden from such entities revoking their accommodated status.  \nThe Departments believe the foregoing analysis represents a reasonable estimate of the \nlikely impact under the rules expanded exemptions.  The Departments acknowledge uncertainty \n                                                           \n56 We note that many non-religious for-profit entities which sued the Departments challenging the Mandate, \nincluding some of the largest employers, only objected to coverage of 4 of the 18 types of contraceptives required to \nbe covered by the Mandate—namely, those contraceptives which they viewed as abortifacients, and akin to abortion \n—and they were willing to provide coverage for other types of contraception.  It is reasonable to assume that this \nwould also be the case with respect to some for-profits that object to the Mandate on the basis of sincerely held \nmoral convictions. Accordingly, it is possible that even fewer women beneficiaries under such plans would bear out-\nof-pocket expenses in order to obtain contraceptives, and that those who might do so would bear lower costs due to \nmany contraceptive items being covered. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 81 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     80  \n \nin the estimate and therefore conducted a second analysis using an alternative framework, which \nis set forth in the companion interim final rule concerning religious beliefs issued \ncontemporaneously with this interim final rule and published elsewhere in this issue of the \nFederal Register.  Under either estimate, this interim final rule is not economically significant. \nWe reiterate the rareness of instances in which we are aware that employers assert non-\nreligious objections to contraceptive coverage based on sincerely held moral convictions, as \ndiscussed above, and also that in the few instances where such an objection has been raised, \nemployees of such employers also opposed contraception.   \nWe request comment on all aspects of the preceding regulatory impact analysis. \nB.  Special Analyses—Department of the Treasury \nFor purposes of the Department of the Treasury, certain Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nregulations, including this one, are exempt from the requirements in Executive Order 12866, as \nsupplemented by Executive Order 13563.  The Departments estimate that the likely effect of \nthese interim final rules will be that entities will use the exemption and not the accommodation. \nTherefore, a regulatory assessment is not required.  \nC.  Regulatory Flexibility Act \nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (RFA) imposes certain \nrequirements with respect to Federal rules that are subject to the notice and comment \nrequirements of section 553(b) of the APA (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and that are likely to have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  Under Section 553(b) of \nthe APA, a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required when an agency, for good \ncause, finds that notice and public comment thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary \nto the public interest.  The interim final rules are exempt from the APA, both because the PHS \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 82 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     81  \n \nAct, ERISA, and the Code contain specific provisions under which the Secretaries may adopt \nregulations by interim final rule and because the Departments have made a good cause finding \nthat a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary earlier in this preamble.  Therefore, \nthe RFA does not apply and the Departments are not required to either certify that the regulations \nor this amendment would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities or conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis. \nNevertheless, the Departments carefully considered the likely impact of the rule on small \nentities in connection with their assessment under Executive Order 12866.  The Departments do \nnot expect that these interim final rules will have a significant economic effect on a substantial \nnumber of small entities, because they will not result in any additional costs to affected entities. \nInstead, by exempting from the Mandate small businesses and nonprofit organizations with \nmoral objections to some or all contraceptives and/or sterilization, the Departments have reduced \nregulatory burden on small entities.  Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, these regulations \nhave been submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration \nfor comment on their impact on small business.  \nD.  Paperwork Reduction Act—Department of Health and Human Services  \nUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA), federal agencies are required to \npublish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information.  \nInterested persons are invited to send comments regarding our burden estimates or any other \naspect of this collection of information, including any of the following subjects:  (1) the necessity \nand utility of the proposed information collection for the proper performance of the agency's \nfunctions; (2) the accuracy of the estimated burden; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 83 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     82  \n \nclarity of the information to be collected; and (4) the use of automated collection techniques or \nother forms of information technology to minimize the information collection burden.    \nWe estimate that these interim final rules will not result in additional burdens not \naccounted for as set forth in the companion interim final rules concerning religious beliefs issued \ncontemporaneously with these interim final rules and published elsewhere in this issue of the \nFederal Register.  As discussed there, regulations covering the accommodation include \nprovisions regarding self-certification or notices to HHS from eligible organizations (§ \n147.131(c)(3)), notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services (§ \n147.131(f)), and notice of revocation of accommodation (§ 147.131(c)(4)).  The burdens related \nto those ICRs are currently approved under OMB Control Numbers 0938-1248 and 0938-1292.  \nThese interim final rules amend the accommodation regulations to make entities with moral \nobjections to the Mandate eligible to use the same accommodation processes.  The Departments \nwill update the forms and model notices regarding these processes to reflect that entities with \nsincerely held moral convictions are eligible organizations.  \nAs discussed above, however, we assume that no entities with non-religious moral \nobjections to the Mandate will use the accommodation, and we know that no such entities were \neligible for it until now, so that they do not possess accommodated status to revoke.  Therefore \nwe believe that the burden for these ICRs is accounted for in the collection approved under OMB \nControl Numbers 0938-1248 and 0938-1292, as described in the interim final rules concerning \nreligious beliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules.  \nWe are soliciting comments on all of the possible information collection requirements \ncontained in these interim final rules, including those discussed in the companion interim final \nrules concerning religious beliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules and \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 84 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     83  \n \npublished elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, for which these interim final rules \nprovide eligibility to entities with objections based on moral convictions.  In addition, we are \nalso soliciting comments on all of the related information collection requirements currently \napproved under 0938-1292 and 0938-1248.   \nTo obtain copies of a supporting statement and any related forms for the proposed \ncollection(s) summarized in this notice, you may make your request using one of following: \n1.

Paperwork Reduction Act—Department of Labor \nUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and an \nindividual is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid \nOMB control number.  In accordance with the requirements of the PRA, the ICR for the EBSA \nForm 700 and alternative notice have previously been approved by OMB under control numbers \n1210-0150 and 1210-0152.

These are not toll-free numbers. \nConsistent with the analysis in the HHS PRA section above, although these interim final \nrules make entities with certain moral convictions eligible for the accommodation, we assume \nthat no entities will use it rather than the exemption, and such entities were not previously \neligible for the accommodation so as to revoke it.  Therefore we believe these interim final rules \ndo not involve additional burden not accounted for under OMB control number 1210-0150.   \nRegarding the ICRs discussed in the companion interim final rules concerning religious \nbeliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules and published elsewhere in this \nissue of the Federal Register, the forms for which would be used if any entities with moral \nobjections used the accommodation process in the future, DOL submitted those ICRs in order to \nobtain OMB approval under the PRA for the regulatory revision.  The request was made under \nemergency clearance procedures specified in regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13. OMB approved the \nICRs under the emergency clearance process.

Regulatory Reform Executive Orders 13765, 13771 and 13777 \nExecutive Order 13765 (January 20, 2017) directs that, “[t]o the maximum extent \npermitted by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) and the heads of all \nother executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities under \nthe Act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant \nexemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that \nwould impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on \nindividuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare \nservices, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or \nmedications.” In addition, agencies are directed to “take all actions consistent with law to \nminimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the [Affordable Care Act], and \nprepare to afford the States more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare \nmarket.” These interim final rules exercise the discretion provided to the Departments under the \nAffordable Care Act and other laws to grant exemptions and thereby minimize regulatory \nburdens of the Affordable Care Act on the affected entities and recipients of health care services. \nConsistent with Executive Order 13771 (82 FR 9339, February 3, 2017), we have \nestimated the costs and cost savings attributable to this interim final rule.  As discussed in more \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 87 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     86  \n \ndetail in the preceding analysis, this interim final rule lessens incremental reporting costs.57  \nTherefore, this interim final rule is considered an EO 13771 deregulatory action.   \nG.  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \nThe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (section 202(a) of Pub. L. 104-4), requires \nthe Departments to prepare a written statement, which includes an assessment of anticipated \ncosts and benefits, before issuing “any rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in \nthe expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, \nof $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year.”  The current \nthreshold after adjustment for inflation is $148 million, using the most current (2016) Implicit \nPrice Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product.  For purposes of the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct, these interim final rules do not include any Federal mandate that may result in expenditures \nby State, local, or tribal governments, nor do they include any Federal mandates that may impose \nan annual burden of $100 million, adjusted for inflation, or more on the private sector. \nH.  Federalism \nExecutive Order 13132 outlines fundamental principles of federalism, and requires the \nadherence to specific criteria by Federal agencies in the process of their formulation and \nimplementation of policies that have “substantial direct effects” on States, the relationship \n                                                           \n57 Other noteworthy potential impacts encompass potential changes in medical expenditures, including potential \ndecreased expenditures on contraceptive devices and drugs and potential increased expenditures on pregnancy-\nrelated medical services.  OMB’s guidance on EO 13771 implementation (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-\noffice/2017/04/05/memorandum-implementing-executive-order-13771-titled-reducing-regulation) states that \nimpacts should be categorized as consistently as possible within Departments.  The Food and Drug Administration, \nwithin HHS, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration (MSHA), within DOL, regularly estimate medical expenditure impacts in the analyses that \naccompany their regulations, with the results being categorized as benefits (positive benefits if expenditures are \nreduced, negative benefits if expenditures are raised).  Following the FDA, OSHA and MSHA accounting \nconvention leads to this interim final rule’s medical expenditure impacts being categorized as (positive or negative) \nbenefits, rather than as costs, thus placing them outside of consideration for EO 13771 designation purposes. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-2   Filed 10/09/17   Page 88 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     87  \n \nbetween the Federal Government and States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities \namong the various levels of Government.  Federal agencies promulgating regulations that have \nthese federalism implications must consult with state and local officials, and describe the extent \nof their consultation and the nature of the concerns of state and local officials in the preamble to \nthe regulation. \nThese interim final rules do not have any Federalism implications, since they only \nprovide exemptions from the contraceptive and sterilization coverage requirement in HRSA \nGuidelines supplied under section 2713 of the PHS Act. \nVI.

However, the law recognizes and HHS understands the need to take into \naccount the unique health needs of women throughout their lifespan.\nThe HRSA-supported health plan coverage guidelines, developed by the Institute of Medicine \n(IOM), will help ensure that women receive a comprehensive set of preventive services without \nhaving to pay a co-payment, co-insurance or a deductible. HHS commissioned an IOM study to \nreview what preventive services are necessary for women’s health and well-being and therefore \nshould be considered in the development of comprehensive guidelines for preventive services \nfor women. HRSA is supporting the IOM’s recommendations on preventive services that \naddress health needs specific to women and fill gaps in existing guidelines.\nHealth Resources and Services Administration Women's Preventive Services \nGuidelines\nNon-grandfathered plans (plans or policies created or sold after March 23, 2010, or older plans \nor policies that have been changed in certain ways since that date) generally are required to \nprovide coverage without cost sharing consistent with these guidelines in the first plan year (in \nthe individual market, policy year) that begins on or after August 1, 2012.\nType of Preventive Service HHS Guideline for Health Frequency\nInsurance Coverage\nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines/index.html 10/8/2017\nExhibit C\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-3   Filed 10/09/17   Page 3 of 5\nWomen’s Preventive Services Guidelines | Official web site of the U.S. Health Resources ...

Policy. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously \nenforce Federal law’s robust protections for religious freedom. The Founders \nenvisioned  a  Nation  in  which  religious  voices  and  views  were  integral \nto a vibrant public square, and in which religious people and institutions \nwere free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation \nby the Federal Government. For that reason, the United States Constitution \nenshrines and protects the fundamental right to religious liberty as Ameri-\ncans’  first  freedom.  Federal  law  protects  the  freedom  of  Americans  and \ntheir organizations to exercise religion and participate fully in civic life \nwithout undue interference by the Federal Government. The executive branch \nwill honor and enforce those protections. \nSec. 2. Respecting Religious and Political Speech. All executive departments \nand agencies (agencies) shall, to the greatest extent practicable and to the \nextent permitted by law, respect and protect the freedom of persons and \norganizations to engage in religious and political speech. In particular, the \nSecretary  of  the  Treasury  shall  ensure,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law, \nthat the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against \nany individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the \nbasis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral \nor  political  issues  from  a  religious  perspective,  where  speech  of  similar \ncharacter has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation \nor intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) \na candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury. As used \nin  this  section,  the  term  ‘‘adverse  action’’  means  the  imposition  of  any \ntax or tax penalty; the delay or denial of tax-exempt status; the disallowance \nof tax deductions for contributions made to entities exempted from taxation \nunder section 501(c)(3) of title 26, United States Code; or any other action \nthat makes unavailable or denies any tax deduction, exemption, credit, or \nbenefit. \nSec.  3.  Conscience  Protections  with  Respect  to  Preventive-Care  Mandate. \nThe Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services shall consider issuing amended regulations, \nconsistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to \nthe preventive-care mandate promulgated under section 300gg–13(a)(4) of \ntitle 42, United States Code. \nSec. 4. Religious Liberty Guidance. In order to guide all agencies in complying \nwith relevant Federal law, the Attorney General shall, as appropriate, issue \nE0 guidance interpreting religious liberty protections in Federal law. \nwith \nD  Sec. 5. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of \nO\nR\nP any  provision  to  any  individual  or  circumstance,  is  held  to  be  invalid, \nK30JT082 ttho e anreym  oatihnedre ri nodfi vtihdius alosr doerr  cainrcdu mthseta nacpepsl icsahtailoln  nooft   ibtes  aoftfheecrt edp rothveisrieobnys.  \nS\nD\nmstockstill on VerDate Sep<11>2014  20:08 May 08, 2017 Jkt 241001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\09MYE0.SGM 09MYE0\nExhibit D\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510   Document 1-4   Filed 10/09/17   Page 3 of 3\n21676  Federal Register/Vol. 82, No. 88/Tuesday, May 9, 2017/Presidential Documents \nSec.  6.

INTRODUCTION \n23 \n1.  This suit challenges new rules issued by the Trump Administration that illegally \n24 \njeopardize women’s health and economic success in order to promote certain religious and moral \n25 \nviews.  The  Administration  implemented  its  new  rules  without  regard  to  required  legal \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The State of Washington brings this suit to protect the state and its female residents \n2 \nfrom the substantial harm the Administration’s new rules inflict. \n3 \n2.  The Affordable Care Act requires most health plans and insurance providers to \n4 \ncover certain preventive health services at no added cost to American men and women. The \n5 \ninitial version of the Act did not adequately cover medically necessary preventive care for \n6 \nwomen, such as contraceptive services and screening for gestational diabetes. But the Senate \n7 \n8  introduced the Women’s Health Amendment, and as finally enacted in 2010 the Affordable Care \n9  Act required health plans and insurance providers to include women’s preventive services at no \n10 \nout-of-pocket cost to women. \n11 \n3.  Contraceptive use among women is widespread, with over 99% of sexually active \n12 \nwomen using at least one method during their lifetime. Consequently, the Women’s Health \n13 \nAmendment has been a dramatic success. By 2013, most women had no out-of-pocket costs for \n14 \ntheir  contraception.  One  study  estimated  that  roughly  $1.4  billion  dollars  per  year  in \n15 \n16  out-of-pocket savings on the pill resulted from the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate. \n17 \n4.  The  economic  implications  for  women  also  are  dramatic.  Research  links \n18 \nwomen’s access to contraception to increases in the pursuit of college and advanced professional \n19 \ndegrees, and to career trajectories with higher pay and prestige. Access to reliable contraception \n20 \nhas contributed to women’s increased earning power and the narrowing of the gender gap in pay. \n21 \n5.  On October 6, 2017, the Trump Administration issued two new regulations that \n22 \n23  slashed the contraceptive coverage introduced by the Affordable Care Act. One new set of rules \n24  allows any employer, not just a church or religious order, that asserts a religious objection to \n25 \ncontraception to exempt itself from the requirement and carve out contraception coverage from \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \nRELIEF  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45   Filed 01/02/18   Page 3 of 43\n \n1  its workplace insurance plan. The second set of rules authorizes certain employers with moral \n2 \nbut not religious objections to contraception to opt out of Congress’s requirement. Further, the \n3 \nnew regulations change the prior rules and now allow objecting employers to dictate whether \n4 \ntheir women employees can get contraception directly from the insurance provider or third party \n5 \nadministrator, at no cost to the employer. \n6 \n6.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires the federal government to \n7 \n8  provide public notice and opportunity for comment before changing substantive rights and \n9  obligations springing from the Affordable Care Act. Disregarding this obligation, the Trump \n10 \nAdministration has made the new rules effective immediately without notice and comment \n11 \nrulemaking. Even if the Administration had complied with required procedures, its action would \n12 \nbe illegal. The new regulations violate the Equal Protection guarantee and the Establishment \n13 \nClause in the United States Constitution, the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, and the \n14 \nnon-discrimination  provisions  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  the  Civil  Rights  Act,  and  the \n15 \n16  Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Finally, because the new regulations are arbitrary and capricious \n17 \nand ignore abundant evidence of the importance of contraceptive coverage to women’s health \n18 \nand economic opportunity, they violate the substantive requirements of the APA. \n19 \n7.  The new regulations apply to nonprofit and for-profit employers, as well as to \n20 \nprivate colleges or universities with religious or moral objections to contraception. As a result \n21 \nof the new regulations, choices about contraception coverage will be made by employers and \n22 \n23  private colleges and universities that issue student plans. For many women, their employers or \n24  universities  will  determine  whether  they  have  no-cost  coverage  for  the  full  range  of \n25 \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Their choice of contraception will once again be limited \n2 \nby their own financial means. \n3 \n8.  More than 2.4 million women in Washington are of child-bearing age. Up to \n4 \n746,200 women of child-bearing age in Washington State face losing contraception coverage \n5 \nentirely as a result of the Administration’s new regulations, and others face losing no-cost \n6 \ncontraceptive coverage. Washington maintains state government-funded programs to ensure \n7 \n8  Washington women have access to contraception and the economic opportunities it creates. \n9  Washington residents denied no-cost contraceptive coverage as a result of the new rules will be \n10 \nforced  to  turn  to  these  programs  to  obtain  contraceptive  care.  To  prevent  this  injury  to \n11 \nWashingtonians and the state’s finances, Washington brings this suit to declare illegal and enjoin \n12 \nthe new regulations. \n13 \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14 \n9.  The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 2201(a) and 2202. The \n15 \n16  United States’ sovereign immunity is waived by 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n17 \n10.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1) and \n18 \n5 U.S.C. § 703. Defendants are the President and three U.S. departments and their respective \n19 \ndepartment heads. The State of Washington is a resident of this judicial district and no real \n20 \nproperty is involved in this action. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

PARTIES \n2 \nPLAINTIFF STATE OF WASHINGTON \n3 \n11.  The Plaintiff is the State of Washington. The Attorney General is the chief legal \n4 \nadviser to the State of Washington. The Attorney General’s powers and duties include acting in \n5 \nfederal court on matters of public concern.  \n6 \n12.  The State brings this action to redress harms to its proprietary interests, its \n7 \n8  quasi-sovereign authority, and its interests as parens patriae. \n9  13.  The State has declared its interest in protecting its female residents’ “fundamental \n10 \nright to choose or refuse birth control” through statute. Wash. Rev. Code § 9.02.100. \n11 \n14.  The State has a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health and well-being \n12 \nof  its  residents.  “The  States  .  .  .  perform  many  of  the  vital  functions  of  modern \n13 \ngovernment – punishing  street  crime,  running  public  schools,  and  zoning  property  for \n14 \ndevelopment, to name but a few – even though the Constitution’s text does not authorize any \n15 \n16  government to do so.

The Affordable Care Act and the Contraceptive Coverage Requirement \n22 \n23  25.  In  2010,  Congress  enacted  the  Patient  Protection  and  Affordable  Care  Act \n24  (Pub. L. No. 111–148) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. \n25 \nNo. 111-152) (collectively the ACA).

Ntn’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus., 567 \n2 \nU.S. 519 at 538. \n3 \n26.  The ACA, in its initial form, required non-grandfathered2 group health plans and \n4 \ninsurance providers to cover three categories of preventive health services at no added cost to \n5 \nthe plan participant or beneficiary: “(1) evidence-based items or services that have in effect a \n6 \nrating of ‘A’ or ‘B’ in the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services \n7 \n8  Task  Force;  (2)  immunizations  that  have  in  effect  a  recommendation  from  the  Advisory \n9  Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with \n10 \nrespect to the individual involved; and (3) with respect to infants, children, and adolescents, \n11 \nevidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided for in the comprehensive guidelines \n12 \nsupported  by  the  Health  Resources  and  Services  Administration.”  42  U.S.C. \n13 \n§ 300gg-13(a)(1)-(3). Prevention is a well-recognized, effective tool in improving health and \n14 \nwell-being and has been shown to be cost-effective in addressing many conditions early.3 \n15 \n16  27.  Recognizing that the initial draft left out preventive services that “many women’s \n17 \nhealth advocates and medical professionals believe are critically important,” Senator Barbara \n18 \nMikulski introduced the Women’s Health Amendment, which added to the ACA’s minimum \n19 \ncoverage requirements a new category of preventive services specific to women’s health. \n20 \n155 Cong.  Rec.  28841  (2009).  The  Amendment’s  proponents  noted  that  women  pay \n21 \nsignificantly more than men for preventive care, and that such cost barriers operated to block \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24 \n2 Grandfathered health plan coverage is that which has existed continually prior to March 23, 2010 and has \nnot undergone any of several specified changes since that time. 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251 (2010).

Feinstein) (“Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care \n3 \ncosts than men.”); id. at 29302 (statement of Sen. Mikulski) (“copayments are [often] so high \n4 \nthat [women] avoid getting [preventive and screening services] in the first place.”). The sponsors \n5 \nnoted that increasing access to contraceptive services would yield important public health gains. \n6 \nSee, e.g., 155 Cong. Rec. 29768 (statement of Sen. Durbin) (“This bill will expand health \n7 \n8  insurance coverage to the vast majority of the [17 million women of reproductive age in the \n9  United  States  who  are  uninsured]  .  .  .  .  This  expanded  access  will  reduce  unintended \n10 \npregnancies.”). \n11 \n28.  As altered by the passage of the Women’s Health Amendment, the ACA requires \n12 \nnew insurance plans to include coverage without cost sharing of “with respect to women, such \n13 \nadditional  preventive  care  and  screenings  not  [otherwise  required]  as  provided  for  in \n14 \ncomprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration for \n15 \n16  purposes of this paragraph.” 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). Congress included this provision \n17 \nbecause “women have different health needs than men, and these needs often generate additional \n18 \ncosts.” 155 Cong. Rec. 29070 (2009) (statement of Sen. Feinstein). \n19 \n29.  The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is a part of HHS. \n20 \nHRSA developed guidelines required under 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4) after consultation with \n21 \nthe Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM is an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, an \n22 \n23  organization established by Congress “for the explicit purpose of furnishing advice to the \n24  Government.” Public Citizen v.

The IOM convened a group of independent experts, including “specialists in \n2 \ndisease prevention [and] women’s health,” which prepared a report evaluating the efficacy of a \n3 \nnumber of preventive services. See Institute of Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for \n4 \nWomen: Closing the Gaps 10 (2011) (IOM Report). The IOM defined preventive services as \n5 \nmeasures “shown to improve well-being, and/or decrease the likelihood or delay the onset of a \n6 \ntargeted disease or condition.” Id. at 3. \n7 \n8  31.  Based on the IOM’s review of the evidence, it recommended a number of \n9  preventive services for women, such as screening for gestational diabetes for pregnant women, \n10 \nscreening and counseling for domestic violence, and at least one well-woman preventive care \n11 \nvisit a year. IOM Report at 8-12. Consistent with the findings of “[n]umerous health professional \n12 \nassociations” and other organizations, the IOM experts also determined that preventive coverage \n13 \nfor women should include the “full range” of FDA-approved contraceptive methods. IOM \n14 \nReport at 10, 102-10. FDA-approved contraceptive methods include oral contraceptive pills, \n15 \n16  rings, patches, diaphragms and cervical caps, injections, implants, emergency contraceptive \n17 \ndrugs, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and sterilization.  \n18 \n32.  The  IOM  Report  noted  the  disproportionate  burden  women  carried  for \n19 \ncomprehensive health services and the adverse health consequences of excluding contraception \n20 \nfrom preventive care available to employees without cost sharing.

The IOM also noted that nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States \n5 \nare unintended, and that unintended pregnancies can have adverse health consequences for both \n6 \nmothers  and  children.  IOM  Report  at  102-103.  In  addition,  the  IOM  observed,  use  of \n7 \n8  contraceptives leads to longer intervals between pregnancies, which “is important because of the \n9  increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for pregnancies that are too closely spaced.” \n10 \nId. at 103. \n11 \n33.  Consistent  with  the  IOM’s  suggestions,  HRSA  adopted  guidelines \n12 \nrecommending access to “[a]ll [FDA-]approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, \n13 \nand patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity” as prescribed \n14 \nby  a  health  care  provider.

Instead, implementing regulations authorized a much narrower exemption for \n6 \nreligious employers (defined as “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or \n7 \n8  associations of churches,” and “the exclusively religious activities of any religious order” that \n9  are  organized  and  operate  as  nonprofit  entities.  45  C.F.R.  § 147.131(a);  26  U.S.C. \n10 \n§§ 6033(a)(3)A)(i),  (iii))  from  the  requirement  to  cover  contraceptive  services  under  the \n11 \nGuidelines. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a); 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621 (Aug. 3, 2011).  \n12 \n3.  Accommodation for “Eligible Organizations” \n13 \n39.  Implementing regulations also provided an accommodation to certain “eligible \n14 \norganizations”—nonprofit or closely held for-profit entities6 that object to providing coverage \n15 \n16  for some or all of the contraceptive items or services required to be covered under the Act. \n17 \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); 26 C.F.R. 54.9815-2713A(a). Such entities could opt out of providing \n18 \ncontraceptive coverage by self-certifying to DOL or providing notice to the Secretary of HHS of \n19 \ntheir religious objections to coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services. 45 C.F.R. \n20 \n§ 147.131(b); 26 C.F.R. 54.9815-2713A(a).  \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23  6 The regulations originally only provided an accommodation to nonprofit organizations. 78 Fed. Reg. \n39,870, 39,872, 39,874-39,886 (July 2, 2013). However, the Supreme Court held in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, \nInc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014), that that the contraceptive coverage requirement substantially burdened the free \n24 \nexercise of a “closely-held” for-profit corporation’s religion, and that since the government had not demonstrated \nthat the same accommodation provided to non-profits could not be made available to closely-held for-profits, the \n25 \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act prohibited the government from imposing the requirement on closely-held \ncorporations. 134 S. Ct. at 2785. Accordingly, the regulations were revised to make the accommodation from the \n26 \ncontraception mandate available to closely-held corporations. 80 FR 41,323-41,324. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  13  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

When a group health insurance issuer receives notice that one of its clients has \n2 \ninvoked the accommodation provision, the issuer must then exclude contraceptive coverage from \n3 \nthe  employer’s  plan  and  provide  separate  payments  for  contraceptive  services  for  plan \n4 \nparticipants without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the eligible organization, its \n5 \ninsurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries. 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c). In the case of self-insured \n6 \norganizations entitled to the accommodation, the third-party administrator of the organization \n7 \n8  must “provide or arrange payments for contraceptive services” for the organization’s employees \n9  without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the eligible organization, its insurance plan, \n10 \nor its employee beneficiaries. 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-2713A(b). Thus, women employed by \n11 \n“eligible organizations” were still entitled under the ACA to coverage for FDA-approved \n12 \ncontraception at no additional cost to themselves. \n13 \nB.  Executive Order 13798 \n14 \n41.  On May 4, 2017, President Trump signed  Executive Order 13798, entitled \n15 \n16  “Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty.” This Executive Order is attached to this First \n17 \nAmended Complaint as Exhibit D. The Executive Order directs the Secretaries of Treasury, \n18 \nDOL, and HHS to “consider issuing amended regulations, consistent with applicable law, to \n19 \naddress conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate promulgated under section \n20 \n300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.” Under the express terms of the Executive Order, \n21 \nany amended regulations were required to comply with the ACA, as well as with federal \n22 \n23  non-discrimination laws and the Constitution. \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  14  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

On October 6, 2017, relying in part on Executive Order 13798 as justification, \n3 \nHHS, DOL, and the Treasury issued two sets of Interim Final Rules with respect to preventive \n4 \ncare services for women required to be covered under the ACA (collectively referred to as the \n5 \nIFRs). \n6 \n43.  Taken together, the IFRs greatly expand eligibility for a complete exemption to \n7 \n8  the ACA’s requirement that employers ensure women have access to insurance coverage for \n9  contraception without cost. The new regulations expand the entities to which the exemption is \n10 \navailable. Rather than applying just to churches and religious orders, the exemption now applies \n11 \nto all for-profit or nonprofit employers that assert an objection to contraception based on their \n12 \nreligious beliefs. Women employees of these employers now can be required to pay for their \n13 \ncontraception or, if they cannot, go without.  \n14 \n44.  The IFRs also expand the reason the exemption may be claimed. The new \n15 \n16  regulations create an exemption for all employers, except those that are publicly traded, that have \n17 \nmoral objections to contraception. These employers too can deny their women employees \n18 \ninsurance coverage for contraception. \n19 \n45.  Furthermore, the IFRs significantly cut back the previous accommodation that \n20 \nallowed women who worked for religiously affiliated non-profits or closely held for-profit \n21 \ncorporations  to  obtain  contraception  at  no  out-of-pocket  cost.  Most  significantly,  the \n22 \n23  accommodation is entirely voluntary to exempt employers; if an employer that qualifies for an \n24  exemption declines to seek the accommodation, it may ignore it. The new rules undercut the \n25 \nprevious system whereby women employees of objecting employers nevertheless were entitled \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  15  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Further, the expanded exemption also applies to private institutions of higher \n4 \neducation that issue student health plans, where they object to contraception for religious or \n5 \nmoral reasons. These institutions may single out contraception, among all of their male and \n6 \nfemale students’ health care needs, for denial of coverage. For these institutions, providing an \n7 \n8  accommodation that permits their female students to maintain insurance coverage for their \n9  contraception at no cost to the institution is entirely voluntary.7 \n10 \n47.  The IFRs are not based upon sound scientific or empirical evidence. For example, \n11 \nthe IFRs state that contraceptives are not effective in preventing unintended pregnancy. This is false \n12 \nand inconsistent with the weight of scientific and empirical evidence. \n13 \n48.  The first IFR issued by HHS, DOL, and the Treasury is entitled Religious \n14 \nExemptions and Accommodations for Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the \n15 \n16  Affordable Care Act (hereinafter Religious IFR). 82 Fed Reg. 47,658 (Oct. 13, 2017)8 As stated, \n17 \nthe Religious IFR makes the religious exemption available to any objecting entity that claims to \n18 \nobject to establishing, maintaining, providing, or arranging coverage, payments, or a plan that \n19 \nprovides coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services based on its sincerely held \n20 \nreligious beliefs. \n21 \n49.  The second IFR is entitled Moral Exemptions and Accommodations for Coverage \n22 \n23  of  Certain  Preventive  Services  Under  the  Affordable  Care  Act  (hereinafter  Moral  IFR). \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n7 State laws requiring fully-insured plans to provide access to contraceptive coverage have not been \ndisplaced by the new rules.

On October 6, 2017, HRSA also updated its “Women’s Preventive Services \n6 \nGuidelines” (hereinafter 2017 Updated Guidelines) to provide that “[t]hese Guidelines do not \n7 \n8  provide for or support the requirement of coverage or payments for contraceptive services with \n9  respect to a group health plan established or maintained by an objecting organization, or health \n10 \ninsurance coverage offered or arranged by an objecting organization” as set forth in the Moral \n11 \nand  Religious  IFRs  set  forth  above.  HRSA,  Women’s  Preventive  Services  Guidelines \n12 \n(October 2017), available at https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines/index.html (last visited \n13 \nOctober 6, 2017).10 The Guidelines’ support of the recommendation to provide coverage without \n14 \ncost  sharing  of  “[a]ll  Food  and  Drug  Administration  approved  contraceptive  methods, \n15 \n16  sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive \n17 \ncapacity” is otherwise unaffected. Id. \n18 \n51.  The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines vastly expand the exemption from the \n19 \ncontraception coverage requirement previously available only to religious employers to include \n20 \nany “objecting organization,” which is defined to include any other kind of entity other than a \n21 \ngovernment employer.

The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines make the accommodation process-which \n6 \nprovided a mechanism to ensure women still had access to contraceptive coverage at no cost to \n7 \n8  the employer—entirely optional for all objecting entities entitled to exemption.  \n9  53.  The IFRs provide that “exempt entities will not be required to comply with a \n10 \nself-certification process.” A company that wants to take advantage of the exemption need not \n11 \ncertify that its owners have a religious or moral objection to contraception. It merely needs to \n12 \ndrop or omit contraception coverage from its plan’s terms and comply with other applicable law. \n13 \n54.  The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines are substantive changes that were issued \n14 \nprior to the passing of any notice and comment period. The Departments cited statutory general \n15 \n16  rulemaking  authority  as  the  basis  for  foregoing  notice  and  comment.

Injuries to the State and Its Residents \n2 \n56.  Washington has standing to bring this action because Defendants’ IFRs and \n3 \nUpdated 2017 Guidelines, if allowed to go into effect,11 will cause immediate and substantial \n4 \nharm to the State’s quasi-sovereign, proprietary and parens patriae interests.  \n5 \n1.  Washington’s  Sovereign  and  Parens  Patriae  Interest  in  the  Health  and \n6 \nWell-Being of Its Residents \n7 \n57.  The State’s quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health and well-being of its \n8 \nresidents includes ensuring that its residents have access to affordable contraception and can \n9 \nmake personal, private decisions about their reproductive health and family planning unfettered \n10 \nby their employers. Indeed, the State’s has declared its interest in protecting individuals’ \n11 \n12  “fundamental  right  to  choose  or  refuse  birth  control”  through  statute.  Wash.  Rev.  Code \n13  § 9.02.100. \n14 \n58.  Eliminating  the  requirement  for  coverage  of  contraception  services  by \n15 \nemployer-and higher education-sponsored health plans will also cause harm to Washington \n16 \ncitizens, whom the State represents through its parens patriae authority. \n17 \n59.  Implementation of the IFRs and 2017 Updated HRSA Guidelines will affect the \n18 \nhealth and financial well-being of numerous women and families who reside in Washington.12 \n19 \n20  60.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, “[a]ccess \n2 \nto contraception is a medical necessity for women during approximately 30 years of their \n3 \nlives.”13 \n4 \n62.  Virtually all (99%) sexually active women in the United States have used at least \n5 \none contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime. \n6 \n63.  Contraception use reduces the occurrence of unintended pregnancy and abortion.  \n7 \n8  64.  Contraceptive use also helps women and couples time and space their births, \n9  which helps to reduce the risk of poor birth outcomes, such as low birth weight, preterm birth, \n10 \nand small size for gestational age. \n11 \n65.  Without insurance coverage, contraception costs can exceed $1,000 a year. \n12 \n66.  Early research has also associated the contraception coverage requirement with a \n13 \nhistoric drop in the U.S. abortion rate that occurred in 2014. \n14 \n67.  A recent nonpartisan poll found that a majority of women would struggle to afford \n15 \n16  birth control if they had a co-pay.14   \n17 \n68.  Contraception coverage also impacts women’s educations, careers, and economic \n18 \nstanding. “The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the \n19 \nNation  has  been  facilitated  by  their  ability  to  control  their  reproductive  lives.”  Planned \n20 \nParenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.

Suite 2000 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \nRELIEF  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45   Filed 01/02/18   Page 21 of 43\n \n1  contraceptives has been associated with wage gains made by women since the advent of legal \n2 \nmethods of birth control in the 1960s. \n3 \n69.  Some contraceptive methods also are used for noncontraceptive purposes, such \n4 \nas treatment for acne, menstrual pain, and endometriosis. \n5 \n70.  American women have saved approximately $1.4 billion per year on birth control \n6 \npills alone since the ACA began requiring coverage of contraception benefits. Prior to enactment \n7 \n8  of the ACA, contraception accounted for between 30% and 44% of women’s out-of-pocket \n9  expenses for health care costs. When the ACA required coverage for contraception, women’s \n10 \nout-of-pocket costs declined 38% for birth control pills and 68% for IUDs.  \n11 \n71.  Washington has a Contraceptive Parity Rule that requires health plans that offer \n12 \ncoverage  of  prescription  drugs  or  devices  to  provide  equal  coverage  for  prescription \n13 \ncontraceptives. WAC 284-43-5150. This Rule, however, does not require contraception to be \n14 \ncovered without cost-sharing, and it cannot be enforced against employer self-funded insurance \n15 \n16  plans, which are governed by ERISA. \n17 \n72.  Removing the requirement for employer-sponsored plans to cover the full range \n18 \nof FDA-approved prescribed contraception methods will increase overall health care costs for \n19 \nWashington residents and increase their risk of poorer health outcomes. \n20 \n73.  As a result of the IFRs, some Washington women will lose insurance coverage for \n21 \npreventive contraceptive care and their options for contraception coverage will be constrained by \n22 \n23  cost. Cost will become a barrier to some women’s use of the contraceptive that is medically \n24  recommended to them. \n25 \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  21  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \nRELIEF  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45   Filed 01/02/18   Page 22 of 43\n \n1  74.  According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, more than \n2 \n2.4 million women of child-bearing age reside in Washington. Bureau of Labor Statistics data \n3 \nreveals that the total civilian workforce in Washington in 2016 was 3,639,000. Of those, \n4 \napproximately  1.7  million  workers  were  women  and  approximately  1.3  million  were  of \n5 \nchild-bearing age. \n6 \n75.  Women  in  Washington  will  lose  no-cost  contraceptive  coverage  through \n7 \n8  non-governmental insurance plans because some employers and institutions of higher education \n9  will  take  advantage  of  the  new  exemptions  and  opt  out  of  covering  some  or  all  of  the \n10 \ncontraceptive care required under the ACA. They will also opt out of the accommodation process \n11 \nthat allowed their employees or students to still obtain no-cost contraceptive coverage without \n12 \ncost to the employer or college. \n13 \n76.  The  IFRs themselves concede that a substantial number of women will be \n14 \nimpacted and that a substantial number of entities previously using the accommodation process \n15 \n16  will take advantage of the expanded exemptions. Based upon the Departments’ own concessions \n17 \nin the IFRs, between 698 and 2,640 Washington women who are currently using contraception \n18 \nwill  lose  comprehensive,  employer-sponsored  contraceptive  coverage.  The  direct  cost  of \n19 \nproviding replacement contraceptive coverage and care for these women will be between \n20 \n$407,632 and $1,541,953 per year. \n21 \n77.  Several  nationally  known  experts  in  women’s  reproductive  health,  including \n22 \n23  University of Washington Assistant Professor for Obstetrics and Gynecology Katherine E.

It is important for women to have access to all approved contraceptive methods, \n5 \nas different methods work for different individuals, and some women must try several different \n6 \nmethods to find one that best meets their medical needs. Thus, some of these women who will \n7 \n8  no longer receive contraceptive coverage will not only face financial harm, but will also face \n9  medical harm. This harm will manifest itself in the disruption of these patients’ medical \n10 \ntreatment, whether by substituting a less effective but cheaper method of contraception or by \n11 \nbeing forced to stop using contraceptives altogether for financial reasons. Some of these women \n12 \nwill face unintended pregnancy and other adverse medical consequences. \n13 \n79.  At least one employer doing business in Washington State that would have been \n14 \nsubject to the contraceptive coverage and accommodation process prior to October 7, 2017 \n15 \n16  (absent  an  agreement  with  the  Federal  Government  for  a  temporary  reprieve  from  the \n17 \nrequirement), has informed the State that it is taking the position that it is exempt from that \n18 \nrequirement now. Dkt. 19-3; Dkt. 22-2. Another employer doing business in Washington State \n19 \nannounced to its Washington employees on October 27, 2017 that as a result of “recent changes \n20 \nto the ACA rules” by the Federal Government, the “accommodation is no longer” available to \n21 \nits employees. These statements are indicative of positions likely held by other employers and \n22 \n23  colleges doing business in Washington State.

In Washington State in 2016, 57.4% of \n2 \ncovered employees were enrolled in self-funded insurance plans.15 \n3 \n80.  Based on the percentage of Washington employees in employer self-funded \n4 \nplans, up to 2,088,786 insureds—plus their spouses and dependents—could lose contraceptive \n5 \ncoverage through their employer or university’s self-funded insurance plans as a result of the \n6 \nIFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines. Considering only women of child-bearing age in the civilian \n7 \n8  workforce, and not spouses or daughters of other insureds, the new rules will cause up to 746,200 \n9  women  in  Washington  to  lose  access  to  contraception  through  self-funded  employer  and \n10 \ncollege-sponsored insurance plans.  \n11 \n81.  Even women who will not lose contraceptive coverage entirely because of the \n12 \nState  contraceptive  coverage  mandate  (i.e.  those  women  who  receive  insurance  through \n13 \nfully-insured plans) will be harmed, because unlike the ACA, the State contraception mandate \n14 \ndoes not require women be provided contraceptive coverage at no cost. \n15 \n16  82.  Limiting  women’s  no-cost  access  to  the  full-range  of  FDA-approved \n17 \ncontraception methods will harm women and the State because some contraception methods \n18 \nwork better for certain individuals than others, and some may not be appropriate at all for a \n19 \nwoman  and  her  specific  health  needs.  Additionally,  some  methods  of  contraception  are \n20 \ncost-prohibitive for some women. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n                                                 \n24 \n15 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Washington’s Financial Harm From Implementation of the IFRs \n2 \n123.  In  addition  to  the  impact  on  Washington  residents,  the  implementation  of \n3 \n2017 Interim Final Rules and 2017 Updated Guidelines will increase the costs borne by the State \n4 \nas residents who lose coverage for contraception through their employer or college seek coverage \n5 \nthrough State-subsidized programs which provide subsidized contraceptive coverage, including \n6 \nApple Health, Washington’s Medicaid program. The Departments acknowledge that many \n7 \n8  women who lose coverage as a result of the IFRs will receive “free or subsidized care” through \n9  state programs. See Religious IFR 42–43. \n10 \n124.  Apple Health is administered by a Washington state agency, the Washington \n11 \nHealth Care Authority, and is funded in significant part by the State of Washington. \n12 \n125.  Apple  Health  provides  integrated  health  care  services  that  promote  health, \n13 \nwellbeing, and quality of life for almost 1.8 million Washington residents. As part of that \n14 \nmission, Apple Health provides coverage for reproductive health services including family \n15 \n16  planning and pregnancy related services for eligible Washington residents through a variety of \n17 \nprograms. Family planning services include all FDA approved contraceptive methods and the \n18 \nclinical services necessary for clients to safely and effectively use their chosen contraceptive \n19 \nmethod. \n20 \n126.  Apple Health serves as a secondary-payor for thousands of people in Washington \n21 \nwho have primary insurance through their employer or institution of higher education (or through \n22 \n23  their spouse’s or parents’ insurance). Eligibility for Apple Health is based on several factors, \n24  including income level and family size. Factors such as age and pregnancy status determine the \n25 \napplicable income eligibility requirements for different groups. For example, childless adults are \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  31  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \nRELIEF  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45   Filed 01/02/18   Page 32 of 43\n \n1  generally eligible for Apple Health at up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level, but pregnant \n2 \nwomen are generally eligible at up to 193%. Individuals up to age 18 are eligible up to 210% of \n3 \nthe Federal Poverty Level. Individuals at up to 260% of the Federal Poverty Level may be \n4 \nqualified for family planning services through an Apple Health program. \n5 \n127.  Apple Health serves as a secondary payor for services not otherwise fully covered \n6 \nby employer or higher education sponsored health plans for those clients that have both primary \n7 \n8  health coverage and Apple Health coverage. In 2016, the Health Care Authority provided \n9  secondary Apple Health coverage for 120,328 clients who had primary health coverage from \n10 \nother sources, including employer-sponsored coverage and student coverage. Of the total Apple \n11 \nHealth clients that have primary health coverage from sources other than Apple Health, 69,652 \n12 \nare women, 38,336 of which are ages 15-44. \n13 \n128.  Employers and colleges and universities in Washington that choose to no longer \n14 \ncover contraception for their employees and students pursuant to the IFRs will shift the cost of \n15 \n16  family planning services to the State for employees who already have, or who will seek and be \n17 \nqualified for, Apple Health coverage as secondary insurance through the Health Care Authority. \n18 \n129.  There are also certain programs administered by the Washington State Health \n19 \nCare Authority that provide specific services for specific populations. For example, women and \n20 \nmen up to 260% of the Federal Poverty Level may be eligible to receive family planning services \n21 \nfrom a family planning services only program that is part of Apple Health.  \n22 \n23  130.  In  2016,  the  Health  Care  Authority  and  its  contracted  Managed  Care \n24  Organizations spent $32,506,774.07 for coverage of family planning services for Apple Health \n25 \nclients. \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  32  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \nRELIEF  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45   Filed 01/02/18   Page 33 of 43\n \n1  131.   Over 38,000 women aged 15-44 in Washington with non-governmental health \n2 \ncoverage, including employer-sponsored insurance and student coverage, are already Apple \n3 \nHealth clients. Additional women are likely qualified but not yet enrolled, and some will enroll \n4 \nin Apple Health when they lose coverage for contraception from their non-governmental health \n5 \nplans. Some women who are denied contraceptive coverage through their employer or college \n6 \nbecause of the IFRs will seek it from Apple Health. \n7 \n8  132.  Some women who lose access to contraceptive coverage through employer and \n9  college or college sponsored insurance plans will be unable to afford their current form of \n10 \ncontraception and have an unintended pregnancy. In 2016, the Health Care Authority paid on \n11 \naverage $9,886 per delivery and $582 per induced abortion. Additionally, there are pregnancy \n12 \nservices costs for pregnancy losses prior to 20 weeks gestation. \n13 \n133.  Women who reduce or stop working due to pregnancy will change the families’ \n14 \nincome, causing some families to become eligible for Medicaid. The change in family size due \n15 \n16  to pregnancy also will cause some families to become eligible for Medicaid. This will result in \n17 \nan increase in state expenditures related to pregnancy and future family planning services. \n18 \n134.  Washington also subsidizes family planning services through the Department of \n19 \nHealth’s Family Planning Program (Family Planning Program), which is funded by federal Title \n20 \nX and state funding. This program provides for a full range of family planning, sexual and \n21 \nreproductive health services, and it funds 13 agencies with 71 clinic sites throughout Washington \n22 \n23  that offer affordable contraceptive services, including birth control and long-acting reversible \n24  contraception. In 2016, health care providers funded through the Family Planning Program \n25 \nserved 90,168 clients in over 125,316 clinic visits in Washington. In 2016, 31% of the clients \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  33  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue. Suite 2000 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \nRELIEF  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45   Filed 01/02/18   Page 34 of 43\n \n1  served at these family planning clinics were privately insured. 49% of clients were on Apple \n2 \nHealth.  \n3 \n135.  Washington’s Department of Health provides reproductive health services to \n4 \nindividuals with incomes that are less than 251% of the Federal Poverty Level on a sliding fee \n5 \nscale. Washington State provides $8.8 million of funding to the Family Planning Program per \n6 \nyear. Some women who lose coverage for contraception from their employers will be forced to \n7 \n8  seek contraception from the Family Planning Program.  \n9  136.  As over 38,000 women on Apple Health also have health coverage through their \n10 \nemployer, college, or otherwise, and 80% of women receiving services from Family Planning \n11 \nClinics also have insurance and/or are already on Apple Health, it is clear that some women will \n12 \nturn to these programs for subsidized contraceptive care when they are denied it from their \n13 \nprimary insurance. \n14 \n137.  The loss of contraceptive coverage will also harm the State through its public \n15 \n16  employees benefits program. For example, some state employees have spouses or dependents \n17 \nwho are covered by a non-governmental health plan. Some state employees will add their \n18 \nspouses or dependents onto their plan if those spouses or dependents lose contraceptive coverage \n19 \nthrough a non-governmental health plan. The State’s employer health plan costs increase when \n20 \nspouses or dependents are added onto a state employee’s health plan. \n21 \n138.  The  reduction  in  employer-  or  college-based  coverage  of  contraception  for \n22 \n23  women of reproductive capacity will result in more unintended pregnancies in Washington, to \n24  the extent that women may be unable to afford their current form of contraception. A substantial \n25 \nportion  of  medical  care  associated  with  unintended  pregnancies  are  publically-funded  in \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  34  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Increased  unintended  pregnancies  will  cause  Washington’s  Medicaid \n2 \nprogram to incur greater costs in covering prenatal care and delivery services for low-income \n3 \nwomen. Additionally, individuals who increase the size of their family may become Medicaid \n4 \neligible and cause the Medicaid program to incur greater costs. \n5 \n139.  Washington’s 2013 unintended pregnancy rate was 37%. \n6 \n140.  In 2010, the cost of Medicaid-financed prenatal care and delivery in Washington \n7 \n8  was $220 million, or $10,124 per birth. Fifty-one percent of these Medicaid-covered births \n9  resulted from unintended pregnancies.  Limiting access to contraceptives will increase the \n10 \nnumber of unplanned births that are publicly funded in Washington, and the State’s costs will \n11 \nincrease for each additional birth. \n12 \n141.  In 2010, the cost of Medicaid-financed prenatal care and delivery in Washington \n13 \nwas $220 million, or $10,124 per birth.

Limiting access to contraceptives will increase the \n15 \n16  number of unplanned births that are publicly funded in Washington, and the State’s costs will \n17 \nincrease for each additional birth. \n18 \n142.

Suite 2000 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE \nSeattle, WA  98104-3188 \nRELIEF  (206) 464-7744 \n \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45   Filed 01/02/18   Page 36 of 43\n \n1  144.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \n2 \nConstitution requires equal protection of the laws. \n3 \n145.  The ACA mandates that non-grandfathered insurance plans provide coverage for \n4 \npreventive care for men and women. The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines carve out an \n5 \nexemption specific to women’s reproductive health care. As a result of Defendants’ new \n6 \nregulations, generally only women, not men, may have coverage for reproductive health care \n7 \n8  denied based on their employer’s religious or moral objection. \n9  146.  The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines intentionally interfere with women’s \n10 \nability to access necessary preventive care which is necessary to their equal participation in \n11 \neducation, the workforce, and other elements of economic opportunity in our country. \n12 \n147.  The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines also perpetuate gender stereotypes. \n13 \n148.  The IFRs and corresponding exemption in the 2017 Updated Guidelines do not \n14 \nserve an important governmental objective sufficient to justify the gender-based discrimination. \n15 \n16  149.  By purporting to legally authorize employers, institutions of higher education, \n17 \nand other entities to deny only women the preventive health benefits that they need, the IFRs \n18 \nand the 2017 Updated HRSA Guidelines classify based on gender and therefore violate the Due \n19 \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n20 \n150.  Absent permanent injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the IFRs and \n21 \n2017 Updated Guidelines, the State and its residents will continue to be harmed by Defendants’ \n22 \n23  illegal actions. \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  36  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The State realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in each \n3 \nof the preceding paragraphs of this First Amended Complaint. \n4 \n5  152.  The  Establishment  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment  prohibits  the  federal \n6 \ngovernment from preferring one religion over another (or no religion), and requiring people to \n7 \nbear the burdens of religions to which they do not belong. \n8 \n153.  The Religious IFR and the corresponding portion of the 2017 Updated Guidelines \n9 \nare intended to and have the effect of advancing, imposing, and endorsing certain religious \n10 \ninterests. For example, they permit a for-profit business to impose the costs of its owners’ anti-\n11 \n12  contraception beliefs on employees (and their dependents). Based on the religious beliefs of an \n13  employer  or  institution  of  higher  education,  the  Religious  IFR  denies  women  access  to \n14 \ncontraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure. \n15 \n154.  The  Religious  IFR  allows  employers  to  decide  whether  employees  receive \n16 \nseparate  contraceptive  coverage  through  the  accommodation  process,  at  no  cost  to  the \n17 \nemployers. Employers have no legitimate interest in injecting their religious beliefs into this \n18 \nindependent method for providing contraceptive coverage. \n19 \n20  155.  Through their actions, including those described above, Defendants have violated \n21  the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. \n22 \n156.  Absent permanent injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the IFRs and \n23 \n2017 Updated Guidelines, the State and its residents will continue to be harmed by Defendants’ \n24 \nillegal actions. \n25 \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  37  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

The State realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in each \n4 \nof the preceding paragraphs. \n5 \n158.  The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines have changed the substantive rights and \n6 \nobligations imposed by the ACA and prior implementing regulations on employers, issuers, and \n7 \n8  others. \n9  159.  The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines constitute final agency action and are \n10 \nlegislative rules within the meaning of the APA \n11 \n160.  The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines purport to take effect immediately, \n12 \nwithout the required 30-day waiting period between publication and effective date, without good \n13 \ncause for doing so. \n14 \n161.  The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines were adopted without observing the \n15 \n16  notice and comment procedures required by the APA, which include publishing the proposed \n17  rule, allowing an appropriate time for “interested persons [to have] an opportunity to participate \n18 \nin the rule making through submission of written data, views, or arguments with or without \n19 \nopportunity for oral presentation.” 5 U.S.C. §§553(b), (c). \n20 \n162.  The  Defendants  did  not  have  good  cause  to  forgo  notice  and  comment \n21 \nrulemaking. \n22 \n163.  By Defendants’ actions, the State was denied its opportunity to participate in the \n23 \n24  rulemaking process. While the State provided comments after the IFRs were already issued, this \n25 \nis insufficient to protect the State’s interest to influence the rules before they became effective. \n26 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR  38  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n800 Fifth Avenue.

Therefore,  Defendants  have  taken  agency  action  not  in  observance  with \n2 \nprocedures required by law, and the State is entitled to relief pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 553 and \n3 \n706(2)(D). \n4 \n165.  Absent permanent injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the IFRs and 2017 \n5 \nUpdated Guidelines, the State and its residents will continue to be harmed by Defendants’ illegal \n6 \nactions. \n7 \n8  Count IV \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n9 \nArbitrary and Capricious Action \n10 \n166.  The State realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in each \n11 \nof the preceding paragraphs. \n12 \n167.  The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines reverse a prior agency decision without \n13 \nproviding a reasoned explanation for this change in policy or for the disregarding of material \n14 \nfacts that supported the agencies’ prior position. \n15 \n16  168.  The  IFRs  and  2017  Updated  Guidelines  are  not  evidence-based  or \n17  evidence-informed. \n18 \n169.  Defendants’ explanation for their decision to exempt any entity with religious or \n19 \nmoral objections runs counter to the evidence submitted during the belated comment period for \n20 \nthese IFRs and the predecessor rules. \n21 \n170.

The APA requires that agency action that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \n13  authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” “not in accordance with law” or “contrary \n14 \nto constitutional right” be held unlawful and set aside. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n15 \n174.  The IFRs and 2017 Updated Guidelines, which allow employers to choose \n16 \nwhether their employees will receive coverage for contraception, are not in accordance with and \n17 \nin excess of statutory authority set forth in the ACA, which require coverage for preventive \n18 \nservices for women and do not provide an exception for religious or moral objections. 42 U.S.C. \n19 \n20  § 300gg-13(a)(4). \n21  175.  The expanded exemptions are not required by the Religious Freedom Restoration \n22 \nAct or any other provision of federal law. \n23 \n176.

These interim final rules expand exemptions to protect religious beliefs \nfor certain entities and individuals whose health plans are subject to a mandate of contraceptive \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 3 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     2  \n \ncoverage through guidance issued pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \nThese rules do not alter the discretion of the Health Resources and Services Administration \n(HRSA), a component of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to \nmaintain the guidelines requiring contraceptive coverage where no regulatorily recognized \nobjection exists.  These rules also leave the “accommodation” process in place as an optional \nprocess for certain exempt entities that wish to use it voluntarily.  These rules do not alter \nmultiple other Federal programs that provide free or subsidized contraceptives for women at risk \nof unintended pregnancy. \nDATES:  Effective date:  These interim final rules and temporary regulations are effective on \nOctober 6, 2017. \nComment date:  Written comments on these interim final rules are invited and must be received \nby December 5, 2017. \nADDRESSES:  Written comments may be submitted to the Department of Health and Human \nServices as specified below.

Background \nCongress has consistently sought to protect religious beliefs in the context of health care \nand human services, including health insurance, even as it has sought to promote access to health \nservices.1  Against that backdrop, Congress granted the Health Resources and Services \n                                                           \n1 See, for example, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7 (protecting individuals and health care entities from being required to provide \nor assist sterilizations, abortions, or other lawful health services if it would violate their “religious beliefs or moral \nconvictions”); 42 U.S.C. 238n (protecting individuals and entities that object to abortion); Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2017, Div.

No. 115-31 (protecting any “health care professional, a hospital, a provider-\nsponsored organization, a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any other kind of health care \nfacility, organization, or plan” in objecting to abortion for any reason); Id. at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808 (regarding \n \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 7 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     6  \n \nAdministration (HRSA), a component of the United States Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS), discretion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to specify that \ncertain group health plans and health insurance issuers shall cover, “with respect to women, such \nadditional preventive care and screenings … as provided for in comprehensive guidelines \nsupported by” by HRSA (the “Guidelines”).  Public Health Service Act section 2713(a)(4). \nHRSA exercised that discretion under the last Administration to require health coverage for, \namong other things, certain contraceptive services,2 while the administering agencies—the \nDepartments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury (collectively, “the \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nany requirement of “the provision of contraceptive coverage by health insurance plans” in the District of Columbia, \n“it is the intent of Congress that any legislation enacted on such issue should include a ‘conscience clause’ which \nprovides exceptions for religious beliefs and moral convictions.”); Id. at Div.

Many individuals and entities challenged the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement and regulations (hereinafter, the “contraceptive Mandate,” or the “Mandate”) as \nbeing inconsistent with various legal protections, including the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct, 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1.  Much of that litigation continues to this day.  \nThe Departments have recently exercised our discretion to reevaluate these exemptions \nand accommodations.  This evaluation includes consideration of various factors, such as the \ninterests served by the existing Guidelines, regulations, and accommodation process4; the \nextensive litigation; Executive Order 13798, “Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty” \n(May 4, 2017); protection of the free exercise of religion in the First Amendment and by \nCongress in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993; Congress’ history of providing \nprotections for religious beliefs regarding certain health services (including contraception, \nsterilization, and items or services believed to involve abortion); the discretion afforded under \nsection 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act; the structure and intent of that provision in the broader \ncontext of section 2713 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; the regulatory \nprocess and comments submitted in various requests for public comments (including in the \nDepartments’ 2016 Request for Information).  \nIn light of these factors, the Departments issue these new interim final rules to better \nbalance the Government’s interest in ensuring coverage for contraceptive and sterilization \n                                                           \n3 Note, however, that in sections under headings listing only two of the three Departments, the term “Departments” \ngenerally refers only to the two Departments listed in the heading. \n4 In this document, we generally use “accommodation” and “accommodation process” interchangeably. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 9 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     8  \n \nservices in relation to the Government’s interests, including as reflected throughout Federal law, \nto provide conscience protections for individuals and entities with sincerely held religious beliefs \nin certain health care contexts, and to minimize burdens in our regulation of the health insurance \nmarket. \nA.   The Affordable Care Act  \nCollectively, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148), enacted \non March 23, 2010, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-\n152), enacted on March 30, 2010, are known as the Affordable Care Act.  In signing the \nAffordable Care Act, President Obama issued Executive Order 13535 (March 24, 2010), which \ndeclared that, “[u]nder the Act, longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience (such as the \nChurch Amendment, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7, and the Weldon Amendment, section 508(d)(1) of Public \nLaw 111-8) remain intact” and that “[n]umerous executive agencies have a role in ensuring that \nthese restrictions are enforced, including the HHS.” \nThe Affordable Care Act reorganizes, amends, and adds to the provisions of part A of \ntitle XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) relating to group health plans and health \ninsurance issuers in the group and individual markets.  In addition, the Affordable Care Act adds \nsection 715(a)(1) to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and section \n9815(a)(1) to the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to incorporate the provisions of part A of title \nXXVII of the PHS Act into ERISA and the Code, and thereby make them applicable to certain \ngroup health plans regulated under ERISA or the Code.  The sections of the PHS Act \nincorporated into ERISA and the Code are sections 2701 through 2728 of the PHS Act. \nThese interim final rules concern section 2713 of the PHS Act.  Where it applies, section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act requires coverage without cost sharing for “such additional” women’s \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 10 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     9  \n \npreventive care and screenings “as provided for” and “supported by” guidelines developed by \nHRSA/HHS.  The Congress did not specify any particular additional preventive care and \nscreenings with respect to women that HRSA could or should include in its Guidelines, nor did \nCongress indicate whether the Guidelines should include contraception and sterilization.   \nThe Departments have consistently interpreted section 2714(a)(4) PHS Act’s grant of \nauthority to include broad discretion to decide the extent to which HRSA will provide for and \nsupport the coverage of additional women’s preventive care and screenings in the Guidelines.  In \nturn, the Departments have interpreted that discretion to include the ability to exempt entities \nfrom coverage requirements announced in HRSA’s Guidelines.  That interpretation is rooted in \nthe text of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, which allows HRSA to decide the extent to which \nthe Guidelines will provide for and support the coverage of additional women’s preventive care \nand screenings.  \nAccordingly, the Departments have consistently interpreted section 2713(a)(4) of the \nPHS Act’s reference to “comprehensive guidelines supported by HRSA for purposes of this \nparagraph” to grant HRSA authority to develop such Guidelines.  And because the text refers to \nGuidelines “supported by HRSA for purposes of this paragraph,” the Departments have \nconsistently interpreted that authority to afford HRSA broad discretion to consider the \nrequirements of coverage and cost-sharing in determining the nature and extent of preventive \ncare and screenings recommended in the guidelines.  (76 FR 46623).  As the Departments have \nnoted, these Guidelines are different from “the other guidelines referenced in section 2713(a) of \nthe PHS Act, which pre-dated the Affordable Care Act and were originally issued for purposes of \nidentifying the non-binding recommended care that providers should provide to patients.”  Id.  \nGuidelines developed as nonbinding recommendations for care implicate significantly different \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 11 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     10  \n \nlegal and policy concerns than guidelines developed for a mandatory coverage requirement.  To \nguide HRSA in exercising the discretion afforded to it in section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, the \nDepartments have previously promulgated regulations defining the scope of permissible \nexemptions and accommodations for such guidelines.  (45 CFR 147.131).  The interim final rules \nset forth herein are a necessary and appropriate exercise of the authority of HHS, of which \nHRSA is a component, and of the authority delegated to the Departments collectively as \nadministrators of the statutes.  (26 U.S.C. 9833; 29 U.S.C. 1191c; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-92) \nOur interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act is confirmed by the Affordable \nCare Act’s statutory structure.  Congress did not intend to require entirely uniform coverage of \npreventive services (76 FR 46623).  To the contrary, Congress carved out an exemption from \nsection 2713 of the PHS Act for grandfathered plans.  In contrast, this exemption is not \napplicable to many of the other provisions in Title I of the Affordable Care Act—provisions \npreviously referred to by the Departments as providing “particularly significant protections.” (75 \nFR 34540).  Those provisions include: section 2704 of the PHS Act, which prohibits preexisting \ncondition exclusions or other discrimination based on health status in group health coverage; \nsection 2708 of the PHS Act, which prohibits excessive waiting periods (as of January 1, 2014); \nsection 2711 of the PHS Act, which relates to lifetime limits; section 2712 of the PHS Act, \nwhich prohibits rescission of health insurance coverage; section 2714 of the PHS Act, which \nextends dependent coverage until age 26; and section 2718 of the PHS Act, which imposes a \nmedical loss ratio on health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets (for insured \ncoverage), or requires them to provide rebates to policyholders. (75 FR 34538, 34540, 34542).  \nConsequently, of the 150 million nonelderly people in America with employer-sponsored health \ncoverage, approximately 25.5 million are estimated to be enrolled in grandfathered plans not \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 12 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     11  \n \nsubject to section 2713 of the PHS Act.5  As the Supreme Court observed, “there is no legal \nrequirement that grandfathered plans ever be phased out.”  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., \n134 S. Ct. 2751, 2764 n.10 (2014). \nThe Departments’ interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to permit HRSA to \nestablish exemptions from the Guidelines, and of the Departments’ own authority as \nadministering agencies to guide HRSA in establishing such exemptions, is also consistent with \nExecutive Order 13535.  That order, issued upon the signing of the Affordable Care Act, \nspecified that “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience . . . remain intact,” including \nlaws that protect religious beliefs (and moral convictions) from certain requirements in the health \ncare context.  While the text of Executive Order 13535 does not require the expanded \nexemptions issued in these interim final rules, the expanded exemptions are, as explained below, \nconsistent with longstanding Federal laws to protect religious beliefs regarding certain health \nmatters, and are consistent with the intent that the Affordable Care Act would be implemented in \naccordance with the protections set forth in those laws. \nB.  The Regulations Concerning Women’s Preventive Services \nOn July 19, 2010, the Departments issued interim final rules implementing section 2713 \nof the PHS Act (75 FR 41726).  Those interim final rules charged HRSA with developing the \nGuidelines authorized by section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS.  \n1.  The Institute of Medicine Report \nIn developing the Guidelines, HRSA relied on an independent report from the Institute of \nMedicine (IOM, now known as the National Academy of Medicine) on women’s preventive \nservices, issued on July 19, 2011, “Clinical Preventive Services for Women, Closing the Gaps” \n                                                           \n5 Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits, 2017 Annual \nSurvey,” available at http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-2017. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 13 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     12  \n \n(IOM 2011).  The IOM’s report was funded by the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for \nPlanning and Evaluation (ASPE), pursuant to a funding opportunity that charged the IOM to \nconduct a review of effective preventive services to ensure women’s health and well-being.6  \nThe IOM made a number of recommendations with respect to women’s preventive \nservices.  As relevant here, the IOM recommended that the Guidelines cover the full range of \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, \nand patient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity.  Because FDA \nincludes in the category of “contraceptives” certain drugs and devices that may not only prevent \nconception (fertilization), but may also prevent implantation of an embryo,7 the IOM’s \nrecommendation included several contraceptive methods that many persons and organizations \nbelieve are abortifacient—that is, as causing early abortion—and which they conscientiously \noppose for that reason distinct from whether they also oppose contraception or sterilization.   \nOne of the 16 members of the IOM committee, Dr. Anthony LoSasso, a Professor at the \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, wrote a formal dissenting opinion. He \nargued that the IOM committee did not have sufficient time to evaluate fully the evidence on \nwhether the use of preventive services beyond those encompassed by the United States \nPreventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), HRSA’s Bright Futures Project, and the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) leads to lower rates of disability or disease and \nincreased rates of well-being.  He further argued that “the recommendations were made without \nhigh quality, systematic evidence of the preventive nature of the services considered,” and that \n                                                           \n6 Because section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act specifies that the HRSA Guidelines shall include preventive care and \nscreenings “with respect to women,” the Guidelines exclude services relating to a man’s reproductive capacity, such \nas vasectomies and condoms. \n7 FDA’s guide “Birth Control: Medicines To Help You,” specifies that various approved contraceptives, including \nLevonorgestrel, Ulipristal Acetate, and IUDs, work mainly by preventing fertilization and “may also work ... by \npreventing attachment (implantation) to the womb (uterus)” of a human embryo after fertilization.  Available at \nhttps://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepublications/ucm313215.htm. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 14 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     13  \n \n“the committee process for evaluation of the evidence lacked transparency and was largely \nsubject to the preferences of the committee’s composition.  Troublingly, the process tended to \nresult in a mix of objective and subjective determinations filtered through a lens of advocacy.” \nDr. LoSasso also raised concerns that the committee did not have time to develop a framework \nfor determining whether coverage of any given preventive service leads to a reduction in \nhealthcare expenditure.8  (IOM 2011 at 231–32).  In its response to Dr. LoSasso, the other 15 \ncommittee members stated, in part, that “At the first committee meeting, it was agreed that cost \nconsiderations were outside the scope of the charge, and that the committee should not attempt to \nduplicate the disparate review processes used by other bodies, such as the USPSTF, ACIP, and \nBright Futures. HHS, with input from this committee, may consider other factors including cost \nin its development of coverage decisions.” \n2.  HRSA’s 2011 Guidelines and the Departments’ Second Interim Final Rules \nOn August 1, 2011, HRSA released onto its website its Guidelines for women’s \npreventive services, adopting the recommendations of the IOM.  \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/  The Guidelines included coverage for all FDA-\napproved contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and related patient education and counseling \nfor women with reproductive capacity, as prescribed by a health care provider.  \nIn administering this Mandate, on August 1, 2011, the Departments promulgated interim \nfinal rules amending our 2010 interim final rules. (76 FR 46621) (2011 interim final rules).  The \n2011 interim final rules specify that HRSA has the authority to establish exemptions from the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement for certain group health plans established or maintained by \ncertain religious employers and for health insurance coverage provided in connection with such \n                                                           \n8 The Departments do not relay these dissenting remarks as an endorsement of the remarks, but to describe the \nhistory of the Guidelines, which includes this part of the report that IOM provided to HRSA.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 15 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     14  \n \nplans.9  The 2011 interim final rules defined an exempt “religious employer” narrowly as one \nthat: (1) had the inculcation of religious values as its purpose; (2) primarily employed persons \nwho shared its religious tenets; (3) primarily served persons who shared its religious tenets; and \n(4) was a nonprofit organization, as described in section 6033(a)(1) and (a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the \nCode.  Those relevant sections of the Code include only churches, their integrated auxiliaries, \nconventions or associations of churches, and the exclusively religious activities of a religious \norder.  The practical effect of the rules’ definition of “religious employer” was to create potential \nuncertainty about whether employers, including many of those houses of worship or their \nintegrated auxiliaries, would fail to qualify for the exemption if they engaged in outreach \nactivities toward persons who did not share their religious tenets.10  As the basis for adopting that \nlimited definition of religious employer, the 2011 interim final rules stated that they relied on the \nlaws of some “States that exempt certain religious employers from having to comply with State \nlaw requirements to cover contraceptive services.”  (76 FR 46623).  That same day, HRSA \nexercised the discretion described in the 2011 interim final rules to provide the exemption. \n3.  The Departments’ Subsequent Rulemaking on the Accommodation and Third Interim Final \nRules \nFinal regulations issued on February 10, 2012, adopted the definition of “religious \nemployer” in the 2011 interim final rules without modification (2012 final regulations).11  (77 FR \n8725).  The exemption did not require religious employers to file any certification form or \ncomply with any other information collection process.  \n                                                           \n9 The 2011 amended interim final rules were issued and effective on August 1, 2011, and published in the Federal \nRegister on August 3, 2011. (76 FR 46621). \n10 See, for example, Comments of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on Interim Final Rules on \nPreventive Services, File Code CMS-9992-IFC2 (Aug. 31, 2011). \n11 The 2012 final regulations were published on February 15, 2012 (77 FR 8725). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 16 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     15  \n \nContemporaneous with the issuance of the 2012 final regulations, HHS—with the \nagreement of the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of the Treasury—issued \nguidance establishing a temporary safe harbor from enforcement of the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement by the Departments with respect to group health plans established or maintained by \ncertain nonprofit organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage (and the \ngroup health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans).12  The guidance \nprovided that the temporary safe harbor would remain in effect until the first plan year beginning \non or after August 1, 2013.  The temporary safe harbor did not apply to for-profit entities.  The \nDepartments stated that, during the temporary safe harbor, the Departments would engage in \nrulemaking to achieve “two goals—providing contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing to \nindividuals who want it and accommodating non-exempted, nonprofit organizations’ religious \nobjections to covering contraceptive services.”  (77 FR 8727). \nOn March 21, 2012, the Departments published an advance notice of proposed \nrulemaking (ANPRM) that described possible approaches to achieve those goals with respect to \nreligious nonprofit organizations, and solicited public comments on the same.  (77 FR 16501). \nFollowing review of the comments on the ANPRM, the Departments published proposed \nregulations on February 6, 2013 (2013 NPRM) (78 FR 8456).  \n                                                           \n12 Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers, Group Health Plans, and Group \nHealth Insurance Issuers with Respect to the Requirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing \nUnder section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, Section 715(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act, and Section 9815(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, issued on February 10, 2012, and reissued on \nAugust 15, 2012. Available at: http://www.lb7.uscourts.gov/documents/12cv3932.pdf.  The guidance, as reissued on \nAugust 15, 2012, clarified, among other things, that plans that took some action before February 10, 2012, to try, \nwithout success, to exclude or limit contraceptive coverage were not precluded from eligibility for the safe harbor.  \nThe temporary enforcement safe harbor was also available to insured student health insurance coverage arranged by \nnonprofit institutions of higher education with religious objections to contraceptive coverage that met the conditions \nset forth in the guidance.  See final rule entitled “Student Health Insurance Coverage” published March 21, 2012 (77 \nFR 16457). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 17 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     16  \n \nThe 2013 NPRM proposed to expand the definition of “religious employer” for purposes \nof the religious employer exemption.  Specifically, it proposed to require only that the religious \nemployer be organized and operate as a nonprofit entity and be referred to in section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, eliminating the requirements that a religious employer (1) \nhave the inculcation of religious values as its purpose, (2) primarily employ persons who share \nits religious tenets, and (3) primarily serve persons who share its religious tenets.  \nThe 2013 NPRM also proposed to create a compliance process, which it called an \naccommodation, for group health plans established, maintained, or arranged by certain eligible \nreligious nonprofit organizations that fell outside the houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries \ncovered by section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code (and, thus, outside of the religious \nemployer exemption).  The 2013 NPRM proposed to define such eligible organizations as \nnonprofit entities that hold themselves out as religious, oppose providing coverage for certain \ncontraceptive items on account of religious objections, and maintain a certification to this effect \nin their records.  The 2013 NPRM stated, without citing a supporting source, that employees of \neligible organizations “may be less likely than” employees of exempt houses of worship and \nintegrated auxiliaries to share their employer’s faith and opposition to contraception on religious \ngrounds.  (78 FR 8461).  The 2013 NPRM therefore proposed that, in the case of an insured \ngroup health plan established or maintained by an eligible organization, the health insurance \nissuer providing group health insurance coverage in connection with the plan would provide \ncontraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries without cost sharing, premium, fee, \nor other charge to plan participants or beneficiaries enrolled in the eligible organization’s plan—\n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 18 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     17  \n \nand without any cost to the eligible organization.13  In the case of a self-insured group health plan \nestablished or maintained by an eligible organization, the 2013 NPRM presented potential \napproaches under which the third party administrator of the plan would provide or arrange for \ncontraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries.  \nOn August 15, 2012, the Departments also extended our temporary safe harbor until the \nfirst plan year beginning on or after August 1, 2013. \nThe Departments published final regulations on July 2, 2013 (July 2013 final \nregulations).  (78 FR 39869).  The July 2013 final regulations finalized the expansion of the \nexemption for houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries. Although some commenters \nhad suggested that the exemption be further expanded, the Departments declined to adopt that \napproach.  The July 2013 regulations stated that, because employees of objecting houses of \nworship and integrated auxiliaries are relatively likely to oppose contraception, exempting those \norganizations “does not undermine the governmental interests furthered by the contraceptive \ncoverage requirement.”  (78 FR 39874).  But, like the 2013 NPRM, the July 2013 regulations \nassumed that “[h]ouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive \ncoverage on religious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the \nsame faith who share the same objection” to contraceptives. (Id.) \nThe July 2013 regulations also finalized an accommodation for eligible organizations. \nUnder the accommodation, an eligible organization was required to submit a self-certification to \nits group health insurance issuer or third party administrator, as applicable.  Upon receiving that \nself-certification, the issuer or third party administrator would provide or arrange for payments \nfor the contraceptive services to the plan participants and beneficiaries enrolled in the eligible \n                                                           \n13 The NPRM proposed to treat student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher \neducation in a similar manner. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 19 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     18  \n \norganization’s plan, without requiring any cost sharing on the part of plan participants and \nbeneficiaries and without cost to the eligible organization.  With respect to self-insured plans, the \nthird party administrators (or issuers they contracted with) could receive reimbursements by \nreducing user fee payments (to Federally facilitated Exchanges) by the amounts paid out for \ncontraceptive services under the accommodation, plus an allowance for certain administrative \ncosts, as long as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services requests and an \nauthorizing exception under OMB Circular No. A-25R is in effect.14  With respect to fully \ninsured group health plans, the issuer was expected to bear the cost of such payments,15 and HHS \nintended to clarify in guidance that the issuer could treat those payments as an adjustment to \nclaims costs for purposes of medical loss ratio and risk corridor program calculations. \nWith respect to self-insured group health plans, the July 2013 final regulations specified \nthat the self-certification was an instrument under which the plan was operated and that it \nobligated the third party administrator to provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage by \noperation of section 3(16) of ERISA.  The regulations stated that, by submitting the self-\ncertification form, the eligible organization “complies” with the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement and does not have to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage.  \nSee, for example, Id. at 39874, 39896.  Consistent with these statements, the Departments, \nthrough the Department of Labor, issued a self-certification form, EBSA Form 700.  The form \nstated, in indented text labeled as a “Notice to Third Party Administrators of Self-Insured Health \nPlans,” that “[t]he obligations of the third party administrator are set forth in 26 CFR 54.9815-\n                                                           \n14 See also 45 CFR 156.50. Under the regulations, if the third party administrator does not participate in a Federally \nfacilitated Exchange as an issuer, it is permitted to contract with an insurer which does so participate, in order to \nobtain such reimbursement.  The total contraceptive user fee adjustment for the 2015 benefit year was $33 million. \n15 “[P]roviding payments for contraceptive services is cost neutral for issuers.” (78 FR 39877). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 20 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     19  \n \n2713A, 29 CFR 2510.3-16, and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A” and concluded, in unindented text, \nthat “[t]his form is an instrument under which the plan is operated.”  \nThe Departments extended the temporary safe harbor again on June 20, 2013, to \nencompass plan years beginning on or after August 1, 2013, and before January 1, 2014.  The \nguidance extending the safe harbor included a form to be used by an organization during this \ntemporary period to self-certify that its plan qualified for the temporary safe harbor if no prior \nform had been submitted. \n4.  Litigation Over the Mandate and the Accommodation Process \nDuring the period when the Departments were publishing and modifying our regulations, \norganizations and individuals filed dozens of lawsuits challenging the Mandate.  Plaintiffs \nincluded religious nonprofit organizations, businesses run by religious families, individuals, and \nothers. Religious plaintiffs principally argued that the Mandate violated the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) by forcing them to provide coverage or payments for \nsterilization and contraceptive services, including what they viewed as early abortifacient \nitems, contrary to their religious beliefs.  Based on this claim, in July 2012 a Federal district \ncourt issued a preliminary injunction barring the Departments from enforcing the Mandate \nagainst a family-owned business. Newland v. Sebelius, 881 F. Supp. 2d. 1287 (D. Colo. 2012). \nMultiple other courts proceeded to issue similar injunctions against the Mandate, although a \nminority of courts ruled in the Departments’ favor. Compare Tyndale House Publishers, Inc. v. \nSebelius, 904 F. Supp. 2d 106 (D.D.C. 2012), and The Seneca Hardwood Lumber Company, Inc. \nv. Sebelius (sub nom Geneva Coll. v. Sebelius), 941 F. Supp. 2d 672 (W.D. Pa. 2013), with \nO’Brien v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 894 F. Supp. 2d 1149 (E.D. Mo. 2012). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 21 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     20  \n \nA circuit split swiftly developed in cases filed by religiously motivated for-profit \nbusinesses, to which neither the religious employer exemption nor the eligible organization \naccommodation (as then promulgated) applied.  Several for-profit businesses won rulings against \nthe Mandate before the Unites States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting en banc, \nwhile similar rulings against the Departments were issued by the Seventh and District of \nColumbia (D.C.) Circuits.  Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114 (10th Cir. \n2013); Korte v. Sebelius, 735 F.3d 654 (7th Cir. 2013); Gilardi v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., 733 F.3d 1208 (D.C. Cir. 2013).  The Third and Sixth Circuits disagreed with similar \nplaintiffs, and in November 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in Hobby Lobby and \nConestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Secretary of U.S. Department of Health & Human \nServices, 724 F.3d 377 (3d Cir. 2013), to resolve the circuit split.   \nOn June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court ruled against the Departments and held that, under \nRFRA, the Mandate could not be applied to the closely held for-profit corporations before the \nCourt because their owners had religious objections to providing such coverage.16  Burwell v. \nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc. 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014).  The Court held that the “contraceptive \nmandate ‘substantially burdens’ the exercise of religion” as applied to employers that object to \nproviding contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, and that the plaintiffs were therefore \nentitled to an exemption unless the Mandate was the least restrictive means of furthering a \ncompelling governmental interest.  Id. at 2775.  The Court observed that, under the compelling \ninterest test of RFRA, the Departments could not rely on interests “couched in very broad terms, \nsuch as promoting ‘public health’ and ‘gender equality,’ but rather, had to demonstrate that a \ncompelling interest was served by refusing an exemption to the “particular claimant[s]” seeking \n                                                           \n16 The Supreme Court did not decide whether RFRA would apply to publicly traded for-profit corporations.  See 134 \nS. Ct. at 2774. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 22 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     21  \n \nan exemption.  Id. at 2779.  Assuming without deciding that a compelling interest existed, the \nCourt held that the Government’s goal of guaranteeing coverage for contraceptive methods \nwithout cost sharing could be achieved in a less restrictive manner.  The Court observed that \n“[t]he most straightforward way of doing this would be for the Government to assume the cost of \nproviding the four contraceptives at issue to any women who are unable to obtain them under \ntheir health-insurance policies due to their employers’ religious objections.”  Id. at 2780.  The \nCourt also observed that the Departments had “not provided any estimate of the average cost per \nemployee of providing access to these contraceptives,” nor “any statistics regarding the number \nof employees who might be affected because they work for corporations like Hobby Lobby, \nConestoga, and Mardel”.  Id. at 2780–81.  But the Court ultimately concluded that it “need not \nrely on the option of a new, government-funded program in order to conclude that the HHS \nregulations fail the least-restrictive means test” because “HHS itself ha[d] demonstrated that it \nha[d] at its disposal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring employers to fund \ncontraceptive methods that violate their religious beliefs.”  Id. at 2781-82.  The Court explained \nthat the “already established” accommodation process available to nonprofit organizations was a \nless-restrictive alternative that “serve[d] HHS’s stated interests equally well,” although the Court \nemphasized that its ruling did not decide whether the accommodation process “complie[d] with \nRFRA for purposes of all religious claims”.  Id. at 2788–82. \nMeanwhile, another plaintiff obtained temporary relief from the Supreme Court in a case  \nchallenging the accommodation under RFRA.  Wheaton College, a Christian liberal arts college \nin Illinois, objected that the accommodation was a compliance process that rendered it complicit \nin delivering payments for abortifacient contraceptive services to its employees.  Wheaton \nCollege refused to execute the EBSA Form 700 required under the July 2013 final regulations.  It \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 23 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     22  \n \nwas denied a preliminary injunction in the Federal district and appellate courts, and sought an \nemergency injunction pending appeal from the Unites States Supreme Court on June 30, 2014. \nOn July 3, 2014, the Supreme Court issued an interim order in favor of the College, stating that, \n“[i]f the [plaintiff] informs the Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that it is a \nnonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to providing \ncoverage for contraceptive services, the [Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nthe Treasury] are enjoined from enforcing [the Mandate] against the [plaintiff] . . .  pending final \ndisposition of appellate review.” Wheaton College v. Burwell. 134 S. Ct. 2806, 2807 (2014).  \nThe order stated that Wheaton College did not need to use EBSA Form 700 or send a copy of the \nexecuted form to its health insurance issuers or third party administrators to meet the condition \nfor injunctive relief.  Id.   \nIn response to this litigation, on August 27, 2014, the Departments simultaneously issued \na third set of interim final rules (August 2014 interim final rules) (79 FR 51092), and a notice of \nproposed rulemaking (August 2014 proposed rules) (79 FR 51118).  The August 2014 interim \nfinal rules changed the accommodation process so that it could be initiated either by self-\ncertification using EBSA Form 700 or through a notice informing the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that an eligible organization had religious objections \nto coverage of all or a subset of contraceptive services.  (79 FR 51092).  In response to Hobby \nLobby, the August 2014 proposed rules extended the accommodation process to closely held for-\nprofit entities with religious objections to contraceptive coverage, by including them in the \ndefinition of eligible organizations.  (79 FR 51118).  Neither the August 2014 interim final rules \nnor the August 2014 proposed rules extended the exemption, and neither added a certification \nrequirement for exempt entities.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 24 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     23  \n \nIn October 2014, based on an interpretation of the Supreme Court’s interim order, HHS \ndeemed Wheaton College as having submitted a sufficient notice to HHS.  HHS conveyed that \ninterpretation to the DOL, so as to trigger the accommodation process. \nOn July 14, 2015, the Departments finalized both the August 2014 interim final rules and \nthe August 2014 proposed rules in a set of final regulations (the July 2015 final regulations) (80 \nFR 41318).  (The July 2015 final regulations also encompassed issues related to other preventive \nservices coverage.)  The preamble to the July 2015 final regulations stated that, through the \naccommodation, payments for contraceptives and sterilization would be provided in a way that is \n“seamless” with the coverage that eligible employers provide to their plan participants and \nbeneficiaries.  Id. at 41328.  The July 2015 final regulations allowed eligible organizations to \nsubmit a notice to HHS as an alternative to submitting the EBSA Form 700, but specified that \nsuch notice must include the eligible organization’s name and an expression of its religious \nobjection, along with the plan name, plan type, and name and contact information for any of the \nplan’s third party administrators or health insurance issuers.  The Departments indicated that \nsuch information represents the minimum information necessary for us to administer the \naccommodation process.  \nWhen an eligible organization maintains an insured group health plan or student health \nplan and provides the alternative notice, the July 2015 final regulations provide that HHS will \ninform the health insurance issuer of its obligations to cover contraceptive services to which the \neligible organization objects.  Where an eligible organization maintains a self-insured plan under \nERISA and provides the alternative notice, the regulations provide that DOL will work with \nHHS to send a separate notification to the self-insured plan’s third party administrator(s).  The \nregulations further provide that such notification is an instrument under which the plan is \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 25 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     24  \n \noperated for the purposes of section 3(16) of ERISA, and the instrument would designate the \nthird party administrator as the entity obligated to provide or arrange for payments for \ncontraceptives to which the eligible organization objects.  The July 2015 final regulations \ncontinue to apply the amended notice requirement to eligible organizations that sponsor church \nplans exempt from ERISA pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of ERISA, but acknowledge that, with \nrespect to the operation of the accommodation process, section 3(16) of ERISA does not provide \na mechanism to impose an obligation to provide contraceptive coverage as a plan administrator \non those eligible organizations’ third party administrators.  (80 FR 41323). \nMeanwhile, a second split among Federal appeals courts had developed involving \nchallenges to the Mandate’s accommodation.  Many religious nonprofit organizations argued that \nthe accommodation impermissibly burdened their religious beliefs because it utilized the plans \nthe organizations themselves sponsored to provide services to which they objected on religious \ngrounds.  They objected to the self-certification requirement on the same basis. Federal district \ncourts split in the cases, granting preliminary injunction motions to religious groups in the \nmajority of cases, but denying them to others.  In most appellate cases, religious nonprofit \norganizations lost their challenges, where the courts often concluded that the accommodation \nimposed no substantial burden on their religious exercise under RFRA.  For example, Priests for \nLife v. U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 772 F. 3d 229 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Little Sisters of \nthe Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell, 794 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir. 2015); Geneva Coll. v. Sec’y \nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 778 F.3d 422 (3d Cir. 2015).  But the Eighth Circuit \ndisagreed and ruled in favor of religious nonprofit employers. Dordt College v. Burwell, 801 \nF.3d 946, 949–50 (8th Cir. 2015) (relying on Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & \nHuman Servs., 801 F.3d 927 (8th Cir. 2015)).  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 26 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     25  \n \nOn November 6, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in seven similar cases \nunder the title of a filing from the Third Circuit, Zubik v. Burwell.  The Court held oral argument \non March 23, 2016, and, after the argument, asked the parties to submit supplemental briefs \naddressing “whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners’ employees \nthrough petitioners’ insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of \npetitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage \nto their employees”.  In a brief filed with the Supreme Court on April 12, 2016, the Government \nstated on behalf of the Departments that the accommodation process for eligible organizations \nwith insured plans could operate without any self-certification or written notice being submitted \nby eligible organizations.  \nOn May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a per curiam opinion in Zubik, vacating the \njudgments of the Courts of Appeals and remanding the cases “in light of the substantial \nclarification and refinement in the positions of the parties” in their supplemental briefs.  (136 S. \nCt. 1557, 1560 (2016).)  The Court stated that it anticipated that, on remand, the Courts of \nAppeals would “allow the parties sufficient time to resolve any outstanding issues between \nthem.”  Id.  The Court also specified that “the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on \npetitioners for failure to provide the relevant notice” while the cases remained pending. Id. at \n1561.   \nAfter remand, as indicated by the Departments in court filings, some meetings were held \nbetween attorneys for the Government and for the plaintiffs in those cases.  Separately, at various \ntimes after the Supreme Court’s remand order, HHS and DOL sent letters to the issuers and third \nparty administrators of certain plaintiffs in Zubik and other pending cases, directing the issuers \nand third party administrators to provide contraceptive coverage for participants in those \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 27 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     26  \n \nplaintiffs’ group health plans under the accommodation.  The Departments also issued a Request \nfor Information (RFI) on July 26, 2016, seeking public comment on options for modifying the \naccommodation process in light of the supplemental briefing in Zubik and the Supreme Court’s \nremand order.  (81 FR 47741).  Public comments were submitted in response to the RFI, during a \ncomment period that closed on September 20, 2016.  \nOn December 20, 2016, HRSA updated the Guidelines via its website, \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines2016/index.html.  HRSA announced that, for plans \nsubject to the Guidelines, the updated Guidelines would apply to the first plan year beginning \nafter December 20, 2017.  Among other changes, the updated Guidelines specified that the \nrequired contraceptive coverage includes follow-up care (for example, management and \nevaluation, as well as changes to, and removal or discontinuation of, the contraceptive method).  \nThey also specified that coverage should include instruction in fertility awareness-based methods \nfor women desiring an alternative method of family planning.  HRSA stated that, with the input \nof a committee operating under a cooperative agreement, HRSA would review and periodically \nupdate the Women’s Preventive Services’ Guidelines.  The updated Guidelines did not alter the \nreligious employer exemption or accommodation process. \nOn January 9, 2017, the Departments issued a document entitled, “FAQs About \nAffordable Care Act Implementation Part 36” (FAQ).17  The FAQ stated that, after reviewing \ncomments submitted in response to the 2016 RFI and considering various options, the \nDepartments could not find a way at that time to amend the accommodation so as to satisfy \n                                                           \n17 Available at: https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-\n36.pdf and https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/Downloads/ACA-FAQs-Part36_1-9-17-\nFinal.pdf. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 28 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     27  \n \nobjecting eligible organizations while pursuing the Departments’ policy goals.  Thus, the \nlitigation on remand from the Supreme Court remains unresolved. \nA separate category of unresolved litigation involved religious employees as plaintiffs. \nFor example, in two cases, the plaintiff-employees work for a nonprofit organization that agrees \nwith the employees (on moral grounds) in opposing coverage of certain contraceptives they \nbelieve to be abortifacient, and that is willing to offer them insurance coverage that omits such \nservices.  See March for Life v. Burwell, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116 (D.D.C. 2015); Real Alternatives, \n150 F. Supp. 3d 419, affirmed by 867 F.3d 338 (3d Cir. 2017).  In another case, the plaintiff-\nemployees work for a State government entity that the employees claim is willing, under State \nlaw, to provide a plan omitting contraception consistent with the employees’ religious beliefs. \nSee Wieland v. HHS, 196 F. Supp. 3d 1010 (E.D. Mo. 2016).  Those and similar employee-\nplaintiffs generally contend that the Mandate violates their rights under RFRA by making it \nimpossible for them to obtain health insurance consistent with their religious beliefs, either from \ntheir willing employer or in the individual market, because the Departments offer no exemptions \nencompassing either circumstance. Such challenges have seen mixed success.  Compare, for \nexample, Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1020 (concluding that the Mandate violates the employee \nplaintiffs’ rights under RFRA and permanently enjoining the Departments) and March for Life, \n128 F. Supp. 3d at 133–34 (same), with Real Alternatives, 2017 WL 3324690 at *18 (affirming \ndismissal of employee plaintiffs’ RFRA claim).   \nOn May 4, 2017, the President issued an “Executive Order Promoting Free Speech and \nReligious Liberty.” Regarding “Conscience Protections with Respect to Preventive-Care \nMandate,” that order instructs “[t]he Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services [to] consider issuing amended regulations, consistent \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 29 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     28  \n \nwith applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate \npromulgated under section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.” \nII.  RFRA and Government Interests Underlying the Mandate \nRFRA provides that the Government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise \nof religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability” unless the Government \n“demonstrates that application of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling \ngovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest.”  42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1(a) and (b).  In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court \nhad “little trouble concluding” that, in the absence of an accommodation or exemption, “the HHS \ncontraceptive mandate ‘substantially burden[s]’ the exercise of religion. 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1(a).” \n134 S. Ct. at 2775.  And although the Supreme Court did not resolve the RFRA claims presented \nin Zubik on their merits, it instructed the parties to consider alternative accommodations for the \nobjecting plaintiffs, after the Government suggested that such alternatives might be possible.   \nDespite multiple rounds of rulemaking, however, the Departments have not assuaged the \nsincere religious objections to contraceptive coverage of numerous organizations, nor have we \nresolved the pending litigation.  To the contrary, the Departments have been litigating RFRA \nchallenges to the Mandate and related regulations for more than 5 years, and dozens of those \nchallenges remain pending today.  That litigation, and the related modifications to the \naccommodation, have consumed substantial governmental resources while creating uncertainty \nfor objecting organizations, issuers, third party administrators, employees, and beneficiaries. \nConsistent with the President’s Executive Order and the Government’s desire to resolve the \npending litigation and prevent future litigation from similar plaintiffs, the Departments have \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 30 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     29  \n \nconcluded that it is appropriate to reexamine the exemption and accommodation scheme \ncurrently in place for the Mandate. \nThese interim final rules (and the companion interim final rules published elsewhere in \nthis Federal Register) are the result of that reexamination.  The Departments acknowledge that \ncoverage of contraception is an important and highly sensitive issue, implicating many different \nviews, as reflected in the comments received on multiple rulemakings over the course of \nimplementation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act.  After reconsidering the interests served \nby the Mandate in this particular context, the objections raised, and the applicable Federal law, \nthe Departments have determined that an expanded exemption, rather than the existing \naccommodation, is the most appropriate administrative response to the religious objections raised \nby certain entities and organizations concerning the Mandate.  The Departments have \naccordingly decided to revise the regulations channeling HRSA authority under section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS to provide an exemption from the Mandate to a broader range of entities \nand individuals that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, while continuing to \noffer the existing accommodation as an optional alternative.  The Departments have also decided \nto create a process by which a willing employer and issuer may allow an objecting individual \nemployee to obtain health coverage without contraceptive coverage.  These interim final rules \nleave unchanged HRSA’s authority to decide whether to include contraceptives in the women’s \npreventive services Guidelines for entities that are not exempted by law, regulation, or the \nGuidelines.  These rules also do not change the many other mechanisms by which the \nGovernment advances contraceptive coverage, particularly for low-income women. \nIn addition to relying on the text of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act and the \nDepartments’ discretion to promulgate rules to carry out the provisions of the PHS Act, the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 31 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     30  \n \nDepartments also draw on Congress’ decision in the Affordable Care Act neither to specify that \ncontraception must be covered nor to require inflexible across-the-board application of section \n2713 of the PHS Act.  The Departments further consider Congress’ extensive history of \nprotecting religious objections when certain matters in health care are specifically regulated—\noften specifically with respect to contraception, sterilization, abortion, and activities connected to \nabortion.  \nNotable among the many statutes (listed in footnote 1 in Section I-Background) that \ninclude protections for religious beliefs are, not only the Church Amendments, but also \nprotections for health plans or health care organizations in Medicaid or Medicare Advantage to \nobject “on moral or religious grounds” to providing coverage of certain counseling or referral \nservices.  (42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B); 42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(b)(3)).  In addition, Congress has \nprotected individuals who object to prescribing or providing contraceptives contrary to their \nreligious beliefs.  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Division C, Title VII, Sec. 726(c) \n(Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act), Pub. L. No. 115-31 (May 5, \n2017).  Congress likewise provided that, if the District of Columbia requires “the provision of \ncontraceptive coverage by health insurance plans,” “it is the intent of Congress that any \nlegislation enacted on such issue should include a ‘conscience clause’ which provides exceptions \nfor religious beliefs and moral convictions”.  Id.  at Division C, Title VIII, Sec. 808.  In light of \nthe fact that Congress did not require HRSA to include contraception in Guidelines issued under \nsection 2713 of the PHS Act, we consider it significant, in support of the implementation of \nthose Guidelines by the expanded exemption in these interim final rules, that Congress’ most \nrecent statement on the prospect of Government mandated contraceptive coverage was to express \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 32 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     31  \n \nthe specific intent that a conscience clause be provided and that it should protect religious \nbeliefs. \nThe Departments’ authority to guide HRSA’s discretion in determining the scope of any \ncontraceptive coverage requirement under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act includes the \nauthority to provide exemptions and independently justifies this rulemaking.  The Departments \nhave also determined that requiring certain objecting entities or individuals to choose between \nthe Mandate, the accommodation, or penalties for noncompliance violates their rights under \nRFRA. \nA.  Elements of RFRA \n1.  Substantial Burden  \nThe Departments believe that agencies charged with administering a statute or associated \nregulations or guidance that imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion under RFRA \nhave discretion in determining how to avoid the imposition of such burden.  The Departments \nhave previously contended that the Mandate does not impose a substantial burden on entities and \nindividuals.  With respect to the coverage Mandate itself, apart from the accommodation, and as \napplied to entities with religious objections, our argument was rejected in Hobby Lobby, which \nheld that the Mandate imposes a substantial burden.  (134 S. Ct. at 2775–79.)  With respect to \nwhether the Mandate imposes a substantial burden on entities that may choose the \naccommodation, but must choose between the accommodation, the Mandate, or penalties for \nnoncompliance, a majority of Federal appeals courts have held that the accommodation does not \nimpose a substantial burden on such entities (mostly religious nonprofit entities).  \nThe Departments have reevaluated our position on this question, however, in light of all \nthe arguments made in various cases, public comments that have been submitted, and the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 33 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     32  \n \nconcerns discussed throughout these rules.  We have concluded that requiring certain objecting \nentities or individuals to choose between the Mandate, the accommodation, or penalties for \nnoncompliance imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise under RFRA.  We believe that \nthe Court’s analysis in Hobby Lobby extends, for the purposes of analyzing a substantial burden, \nto the burdens that an entity faces when it religiously opposes participating in the \naccommodation process or the straightforward Mandate, and is subject to penalties or \ndisadvantages that apply in this context if it chooses neither.  As the Eighth Circuit stated in \nSharpe Holdings, “[i]n light of [nonprofit religious organizations’] sincerely held religious \nbeliefs, we conclude that compelling their participation in the accommodation process by threat \nof severe monetary penalty is a substantial burden on their exercise of religion….  That they \nthemselves do not have to arrange or pay for objectionable contraceptive coverage is not \ndeterminative of whether the required or forbidden act is or is not religiously offensive”.  (801 \nF.3d at 942.)  \nOur reconsideration of these issues has also led us to conclude, consistent with the rulings \nin favor of religious employee plaintiffs in Wieland and March for Life cited above, that the \nMandate imposes a substantial burden on the religious beliefs of individual employees who \noppose contraceptive coverage and would be able to obtain a plan that omits contraception from \na willing employer or issuer (as applicable), but cannot obtain one solely because of the \nMandate’s prohibition on that employer and/or issuer providing them with such a plan.  \nConsistent with our conclusion earlier this year after the remand of cases in Zubik and \nour reviewing of comments submitted in response to the 2016 RFI, the Departments believe \nthere is not a way to satisfy all religious objections by amending the accommodation. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 34 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     33  \n \nAccordingly, the Departments have decided it is necessary and appropriate to provide the \nexpanded exemptions set forth herein. \n2.  Compelling Interest  \nAlthough the Departments previously took the position that the application of the \nMandate to certain objecting employers was necessary to serve a compelling governmental \ninterest, the Departments have now concluded, after reassessing the relevant interests and for the \nreasons stated below, that it does not.  Under such circumstances, the Departments are required \nby law to alleviate the substantial burden created by the Mandate. Here, informed by the \nDepartments’ reassessment of the relevant interests, as well as by our desire to bring to a close \nthe more than 5 years of litigation over RFRA challenges to the Mandate, the Departments have \ndetermined that the appropriate administrative response is to create a broader exemption, rather \nthan simply adjusting the accommodation process. \nRFRA requires the Government to respect religious beliefs under “the most demanding \ntest known to constitutional law”: where the Government imposes a substantial burden on \nreligious exercise, it must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and show that the law \nor requirement is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. City of Boerne v. Flores, \n521 U.S. 507, 534 (1997).  For an interest to be compelling, its rank must be of the “highest \norder”.  Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993); \nsee also Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 406–09 (1963); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, \n221–29 (1972).  In applying RFRA, the Supreme Court has “looked beyond broadly formulated \ninterests justifying the general applicability of government mandates and scrutinized the asserted \nharm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.” Gonzales v. O Centro \nEspirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 431 (2006).  To justify a substantial \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 35 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     34  \n \nburden on religious exercise under RFRA, the Government must show it has a compelling \ninterest in applying the requirement to the “particular claimant[s] whose sincere exercise of \nreligion is being substantially burdened.”  Id. at 430–31.  Moreover, the Government must meet \nthe “exceptionally demanding” least-restrictive-means standard.  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at \n2780.  Under that standard, the Government must establish that “it lacks other means of \nachieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by \nthe objecting parties.”  Id. \nUpon further examination of the relevant provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the \nadministrative record on which the Mandate was based, the Departments have concluded that the \napplication of the Mandate to entities with sincerely held religious objections to it does not serve \na compelling governmental interest.  The Departments have reached that conclusion for multiple \nreasons, no one of which is dispositive. \nFirst, Congress did not mandate that contraception be covered at all under the Affordable \nCare Act.  Instead, Congress merely provided for coverage of “such additional preventive care \nand screenings” for women “provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by [HRSA].” \nCongress, thus, left the identification of any additional required preventive services for women to \nadministrative discretion.  The fact that Congress granted the Departments the authority to \npromulgate all rules appropriate and necessary for the administration of the relevant provisions \nof the Code, ERISA, and the PHS Act, including by channeling the discretion Congress afforded \nto HRSA to decide whether to require contraceptive coverage, indicates that the Departments’ \njudgment should carry particular weight in considering the relative importance of the \nGovernment’s interest in applying the Mandate to the narrow population of entities exempted in \nthese rules.    \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 36 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     35  \n \nSecond, while Congress specified that many health insurance requirements added by the \nAffordable Care Act—including provisions adjacent to section 2713 of the PHS Act—were so \nimportant that they needed to be applied to all health plans immediately, the preventive services \nrequirement in section 2713 of the PHS Act was not made applicable to “grandfathered plans.” \nThat feature of the Affordable Care Act is significant: as cited above, seven years after the \nAffordable Care Act’s enactment, approximately 25.5 million people are estimated to be enrolled \nin grandfathered plans not subject to section 2713 of the PHS Act.  We do not suggest that a \nrequirement that is inapplicable to grandfathered plans or otherwise subject to exceptions could \nnever qualify as a serving a compelling interest under RFRA.  For example, “[e]ven a \ncompelling interest may be outweighed in some circumstances by another even weightier \nconsideration.”  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780.  But Congress’ decision not to apply section \n2713 of the PHS Act to grandfathered plans, while deeming other requirements closely \nassociated in the same statute as sufficiently important to impose immediately, is relevant to our \nassessment of the importance of the Government interests served by the Mandate.  As the \nDepartments observed in 2010, those immediately applicable requirements were “particularly \nsignificant.” (75 FR 34540).  Congress’ decision to leave section 2713 out of that category \ninforms the Departments’ assessment of the weight of the Government’s interest in applying the \nGuidelines issued pursuant to section 2713 of the PHS Act to religious objectors. \nThird, various entities that brought legal challenges to the Mandate (including some of \nthe largest employers) have been willing to provide coverage of some, though not all, \ncontraceptives.  For example, the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby were willing to provide coverage \nwith no cost sharing of 14 of 18 FDA-approved women’s contraceptive and sterilization \nmethods.  (134 S. Ct. at 2766.)  With respect to organizations and entities holding those beliefs, \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 37 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     36  \n \nthe fact that they are willing to provide coverage for various contraceptive methods significantly \ndetracts from the government interest in requiring that they provide coverage for other \ncontraceptive methods to which they object. \nFourth, the case for a compelling interest is undermined by the existing accommodation \nprocess, and how it applies to certain similarly situated entities based on whether or not they \nparticipate in certain self-insured group health plans, known as church plans, under applicable \nlaw.  The Departments previously exempted eligible organizations from the contraceptive \ncoverage requirement, and created an accommodation under which those organizations bore no \nobligation to provide for such coverage after submitting a self-certification or notice.  Where a \nnon-exempt religious organization uses an insured group health plan instead of a self-insured \nchurch plan, the health insurance issuer would be obliged to provide contraceptive coverage or \npayments to the plan’s participants under the accommodation.  Even in a self-insured church \nplan context, the preventive services requirement in section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act applies to \nthe plan, and through the Code, to the religious organization that sponsors the plan.  But under \nthe accommodation, once a self-insured church plan files a self-certification or notice, the \naccommodation relieves it of any further obligation with respect to contraceptive services \ncoverage.  Having done so, the accommodation process would normally transfer the obligation to \nprovide or arrange for contraceptive coverage to a self-insured plan’s third party administrator \n(TPA).  But the Departments lack authority to compel church plan TPAs to provide \ncontraceptive coverage or levy fines against those TPAs for failing to provide it.  This is because \nchurch plans are exempt from ERISA pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of ERISA.  Section 2761(a) of \nthe PHS Act provides that States may enforce the provisions of title XXVII of the PHS Act as \nthey pertain to issuers, but not as they pertain to church plans that do not provide coverage \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 38 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     37  \n \nthrough a policy issued by a health insurance issuer.  The combined result of PHS Act section \n2713’s authority to remove contraceptive coverage obligations from self-insured church plans, \nand HHS’s and DOL’s lack of authority under the PHS Act or ERISA to require TPAs to \nbecome administrators of those plans to provide such coverage, has led to significant incongruity \nin the requirement to provide contraceptive coverage among nonprofit organizations with \nreligious objections to the coverage.  \nMore specifically, issuers and third party administrators for some, but not all, religious \nnonprofit organizations are subject to enforcement for failure to provide contraceptive coverage \nunder the accommodation, depending on whether they participate in a self-insured church plan. \nNotably, many of those nonprofit organizations are not houses of worship or integrated \nauxiliaries.  Under section 3(33)(C)(iv) of ERISA, many organizations in self-insured church \nplans need not be churches, but can merely “share[] common religious bonds and convictions \nwith [a] church or convention or association of churches”.  The effect is that many similar \nreligious organizations are being treated very differently with respect to their employees \nreceiving contraceptive coverage—depending on whether the organization is part of a church \nplan—even though the Departments claimed a compelling interest to deny exemptions to all such \norganizations. In this context, the fact that the Mandate and the Departments’ application thereof \n“leaves appreciable damage to [their] supposedly vital interest unprohibited” is strong evidence \nthat the Mandate “cannot be regarded as protecting an interest ‘of the highest order.” Lukumi, \n508 U.S. at 520 (citation and quotation marks omitted).   \nFifth, the Departments’ previous assertion that the exemption for houses of worship was \noffered to respect a certain sphere of church autonomy (80 FR 41325) does not adequately \nexplain some of the disparate results of the existing rules.  And the desire to respect church \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 39 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     38  \n \nautonomy is not grounds to prevent the Departments from expanding the exemption to other \nreligious entities.  The Departments previously treated religious organizations that operate in a \nsimilar fashion very differently for the purposes of the Mandate.  For example, the Departments \nexempted houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries that may conduct activities, such as the \noperating of schools, that are also conducted by non-exempt religious nonprofit organizations. \nLikewise, among religious nonprofit groups that were not exempt as houses of worship or \nintegrated auxiliaries, many operate their religious activities similarly even if they differ in \nwhether they participate in self-insured church plans.  As another example, two religious \ncolleges might have the same level of religiosity and commitment to defined ideals, but one \nmight identify with a specific large denomination and choose to be in a self-insured church plan \noffered by that denomination, while another might not be so associated or might not have as \nready access to a church plan and so might offer its employees a fully insured health plan. Under \nthe accommodation, employees of the college using a fully insured plan (or a self-insured plan \nthat is not a church plan) would receive coverage of contraceptive services without cost sharing, \nwhile employees of the college participating in the self-insured church plan would not receive \nthe coverage where that plan required its third party administrator to not offer the coverage. \nAs the Supreme Court recently confirmed, a self-insured church plan exempt from \nERISA through ERISA 3(33) can include a plan that is not actually established or maintained by \na church or by a convention or association of churches, but is maintained by “an organization … \nthe principal purpose or function of which is the administration or funding of a plan or program \nfor the provision of retirement benefits or welfare benefits, or both, for the employees of a \nchurch or a convention or association of churches, if such organization is controlled by or \nassociated with a church or a convention or association of churches” (a so-called  “principal-\n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 40 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     39  \n \npurpose organization”).  See Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton, 137 S. Ct. 1652, 1656-\n57 (U.S. June 5, 2017); ERISA 3(33)(C).  While the Departments take no view on the status of \nthese particular plans, the Departments acknowledge that the church plan exemption not only \nincludes some non-houses-of-worship as organizations whose employees can be covered by the \nplan, but also, in certain circumstances, may include plans that are not themselves established \nand maintained by houses of worship.  Yet, such entities and plans—if they file a self-\ncertification or notice through the existing accommodation—are relieved of obligations under the \ncontraceptive Mandate and their third party administrators are not subject to a requirement that \nthey provide contraceptive coverage to their plan participants and beneficiaries.  \nAfter considering the differential treatment of various religious nonprofit organizations \nunder the previous accommodation, the Departments conclude that it is appropriate to expand the \nexemption to other religious nonprofit organizations with sincerely held religious beliefs \nopposed to contraceptive coverage.  We also conclude that it is not appropriate to limit the scope \nof a religious exemption by relying upon a small minority of State laws that contain narrow \nexemptions that focus on houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries.  (76 FR 46623.) \nSixth, the Government’s interest in ensuring contraceptive coverage for employees of \nparticular objecting employers is undermined by the characteristics of many of those employers, \nespecially nonprofit employers.  The plaintiffs challenging the existing accommodation include, \namong other organizations, religious colleges and universities, and religious orders that provide \nhealth care or other charitable services.  Based in part on our experience litigating against such \norganizations, the Departments now disagree with our previous assertion that “[h]ouses of \nworship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive coverage on religious \ngrounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 41 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     40  \n \nsame objection.”18 (78 FR 39874.)  Although empirical data was not required to reach our \nprevious conclusion, we note that the conclusion was not supported by any specific data or other \nsource, but instead was intended to be a reasonable assumption.  Nevertheless, in the litigation \nand in numerous public comments submitted throughout the regulatory processes described \nabove, many religious nonprofit organizations have indicated that they possess deep religious \ncommitments even if they are not houses of worship or their integrated auxiliaries.  Some of the \nreligious nonprofit groups challenging the accommodation claim that their employees are \nrequired to adhere to a statement of faith which includes the entities’ views on certain \ncontraceptive items.19  The Departments recognize, of course, that not all of the plaintiffs \nchallenging the accommodation require all of their employees (or covered students) to share their \nreligious objections to contraceptives.  At the same time, it has become apparent from public \ncomments and from court filings in dozens of cases—encompassing hundreds of organizations—\nthat many religious nonprofit organizations express their beliefs publicly and hold themselves \nout as organizations for whom their religious beliefs are vitally important.  Employees of such \norganizations, even if not required to sign a statement of faith, often have access to, and \nknowledge of, the views of their employers on contraceptive coverage, whether through the \norganization’s published mission statement or statement of beliefs, through employee benefits \ndisclosures and other communications with employees and prospective employees, or through \npublicly filed lawsuits objecting to providing such coverage and attendant media coverage. In \n                                                           \n18 In changing its position, an agency “need not demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new \npolicy are better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that \nthere are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change of course \nadequately indicates.” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  \n19 See, for example, Geneva College v. Sebelius, 929 F. Supp. 2d 402, 411 (W.D. Pa. 2013); Grace Schools v. \nSebelius, 988 F. Supp. 2d 935, 943 (N.D. Ind. 2013); Comments of the Council for Christian Colleges & \nUniversities, re: CMS-9968-P (filed Apr. 8, 2013) (“On behalf of [] 172 higher education institutions…a \nrequirement for membership in the CCCU is that full-time administrators and faculty at our institutions share the \nChristian faith of the institution.”).  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 42 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     41  \n \nmany cases, the employees of religious organizations will have chosen to work for those \norganizations with an understanding—explicit or implicit—that they were being employed to \nadvance the organization’s goals and to be respectful of the organization’s beliefs even if they do \nnot share all of those beliefs. Religious nonprofit organizations that engage in expressive activity \ngenerally have a First Amendment right of expressive association and religious free exercise to \nchoose to hire persons (or, in the case of students, to admit them) based on whether they share, or \nat least will be respectful of, their beliefs.20  \nGiven the sincerely held religious beliefs of many religious organizations, imposing the \ncontraceptive-coverage requirement on those that object based on such beliefs might undermine \nthe Government’s broader interests in ensuring health coverage by causing the entities to stop \nproviding health coverage.  For example, because the Affordable Care Act does not require \ninstitutions of higher education to arrange student coverage, some institutions of higher \neducation that object to the Mandate appear to have chosen to stop arranging student plans rather \nthan comply with the Mandate or be subject to the accommodation with respect to such \npopulations.21 \nSeventh, we now believe the administrative record on which the Mandate rests is \ninsufficient to meet the high threshold to establish a compelling governmental interest in \nensuring that women covered by plans of objecting organizations receive cost-free contraceptive \ncoverage through those plans.  To begin, in support of the IOM’s recommendations, which \nHRSA adopted, the IOM identified several studies showing a preventive services gap because \n                                                           \n20 Notably, “the First Amendment simply does not require that every member of a group agree on every issue in \norder for the group’s policy to be ‘expressive association.’” Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 655 \n(2000). \n21 See, for example, Manya Brachear Pashman, “Wheaton College ends coverage amid fight against birth control mandate,” Chicago Tribune \n(July 29, 2015); Laura Bassett, “Franciscan University Drops Entire Student Health Insurance Plan Over Birth Control Mandate,” HuffPost (May \n15, 2012). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 43 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     42  \n \nwomen require more preventive care than men.  (IOM 2011 at 19–21).  Those studies did not \nidentify contraceptives or sterilization as composing a specific portion of that gap, and the IOM \ndid not consider or establish in the report whether any cost associated with that gap remains after \nall other women’s preventive services are covered without cost-sharing.  Id.  Even without \nknowing what the empirical data would show about that gap, the coverage of the other women’s \npreventive services required under both the HRSA Guidelines and throughout section 2713(a) of \nthe PHS Act—including annual well-woman visits and a variety of tests, screenings, and \ncounseling services—serves at a minimum to diminish the cost gap identified by IOM for \nwomen whose employers decline to cover some or all contraceptives on religious grounds.22  \nMoreover, there are multiple Federal, State, and local programs that provide free or \nsubsidized contraceptives for low-income women.  Such Federal programs include, among \nothers, Medicaid (with a 90 percent Federal match for family planning services), Title X, \ncommunity health center grants, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.  According to \nthe Guttmacher Institute, government-subsidized family planning services are provided at 8,409 \nhealth centers overall.23  The Title X program, for example, administered by the HHS Office of \nPopulation Affairs (OPA), provides a wide variety of voluntary family planning information and \nservices for clients based on their ability to pay, through a network that includes nearly 4,000 \nfamily planning centers. http://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/  Individuals with \nfamily incomes at or below the HHS poverty guideline (for 2017, $24,600 for a family of four in \nthe 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia) receive services at no charge unless a \nthird party (governmental or private) is authorized or obligated to pay for these services. \n                                                           \n22 The Departments are not aware of any objectors to the contraceptive Mandate that are unwilling to cover any of \nthe other preventive services without cost sharing as required by PHS Act section 2713. \n23 “Facts on Publicly Funded Contraceptive Services in the United States,” March 2016. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 44 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     43  \n \nIndividuals with incomes in excess of 100 percent up to 250 percent of the poverty guideline are \ncharged for services using a sliding fee scale based on family size and income. Unemancipated \nminors seeking confidential services are assessed fees based on their own income level rather \nthan their family’s income.  The availability of such programs to serve the most at-risk women \n(as defined in the IOM report) diminishes the Government’s interest in applying the Mandate to \nobjecting employers. Many forms of contraception are available for around $50 per month, \nincluding long-acting methods such as the birth control shot and intrauterine devices (IUDs).24 \nOther, more permanent forms of contraception like implantables bear a higher one-time cost, but \nwhen calculated over the duration of use, cost a similar amount.25  Various State programs \nsupplement the Federal programs referenced above, and 28 States have their own mandates of \ncontraceptive coverage as a matter of State law.  This existing inter-governmental structure for \nobtaining contraceptives significantly diminishes the Government’s interest in applying the \nMandate to employers over their sincerely held religious objections. \nThe record also does not reflect that the Mandate is tailored to the women most likely to \nexperience unintended pregnancy, identified by the 2011 IOM report as “women who are aged \n18 to 24 years and unmarried, who have a low income, who are not high school graduates, and \nwho are members of a racial or ethnic minority”.  (IOM 2011 at 102).  For example, with respect \nto religiously objecting organizations, the Mandate applies in employer-based group health plans \nand student insurance at private colleges and universities.  It is not clear that applying the \nMandate among those objecting entities is a narrowly tailored way to benefit the most at-risk \n                                                           \n24 See, for example, Caroline Cunningham, “How Much Will Your Birth Control Cost Once the Affordable Care \nAct Is Repealed?” Washingtonian (Jan. 17, 2017), available at https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/01/17/how-\nmuch-will-your-birth-control-cost-once-the-affordable-care-act-is-repealed/; also, see \nhttps://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control. \n25 Id. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 45 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     44  \n \npopulation.  The entities appear to encompass some such women, but also appear to omit many \nof them and to include a significantly larger cross-section of women as employees or plan \nparticipants.  At the same time, the Mandate as applied to objecting employers appears to \nencompass a relatively small percentage of the number of women impacted by the Mandate \noverall, since most employers do not appear to have conscientious objections to the Mandate.26 \nThe Guttmacher Institute, on which the IOM relied, further reported that 89 percent of women \nwho are at risk of unintended pregnancy and are living at 0 through 149 percent of the poverty \nline are already using contraceptives, as are 92 percent of those with incomes of 300 percent or \nmore of the Federal poverty level.27  \nThe rates of—and reasons for—unintended pregnancy are notoriously difficult to \nmeasure.28  In particular, association and causality can be hard to disentangle, and the studies \nreferred to by the 2011 IOM Report speak more to association than causality.  For example, IOM \n2011 references Boonstra, et al. (2006), as finding that, “as the rate of contraceptive use by \nunmarried women increased in the United States between 1982 and 2002, rates of unintended \n                                                           \n26 Prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act approximately 6 percent of employer survey respondents \ndid not offer contraceptive coverage, with 31 percent of respondents not knowing whether they offered such \ncoverage Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits, 2010 \nAnnual Survey” at 196, available at https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/8085.pdf. It is not \nclear whether the minority of employers who did not cover contraception refrained from doing so for conscientious \nreasons or for other reasons. Estimates of the number of women who might be impacted by the exemptions offered \nin these rules, as compared to the total number of women who will likely continue to receive contraceptive \ncoverage, is discussed in more detail below. \n27 “Contraceptive Use in the United States,” September 2016. \n28 The IOM 2011 Report reflected this when it cited the IOM’s own 1995 report on unintended pregnancy, “The \nBest Intentions” (IOM 1995). IOM 1995 identifies various methodological difficulties in demonstrating the interest \nin reducing unintended pregnancies by means of a coverage mandate in employer plans. These include:  the \nambiguity of intent as an evidence-based measure (does it refer to mistimed pregnancy or unwanted pregnancy, and \ndo studies make that distinction?); “the problem of determining parental attitudes at conception” and inaccurate \nmethods often used for that assessment, such as “to use the request for an abortion as a marker”; and the overarching \nproblem of “association versus causality,” that is, whether intent causes certain negative outcomes or is merely \ncorrelated with them. IOM 1995 at 64–66. See also IOM 1995 at 222 (“the largest public sector funding efforts, \nTitle X and Medicaid, have not been well evaluated in terms of their net effectiveness, including their precise impact \non unintended pregnancy”). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 46 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     45  \n \npregnancy and abortion for unmarried women also declined,”29 and Santelli and Melnikas as \nfinding that “increased rates of contraceptive use by adolescents from the early 1990s to the early \n2000s was associated with a decline in teen pregnancies and that periodic increases in the teen \npregnancy rate are associated with lower rates of contraceptive use”.  IOM 2011 at 105.30  In this \nrespect, the report does not show that access to contraception causes decreased incidents of \nunintended pregnancy, because both of the assertions rely on association rather than causation, \nand they associate reduction in unintended pregnancy with increased use of contraception, not \nmerely with increased access to such contraceptives.   \nSimilarly, in a study involving over 8,000 women between 2012 and 2015, conducted to \ndetermine whether contraceptive coverage under the Mandate changed contraceptive use \npatterns, the Guttmacher Institute concluded that “[w]e observed no changes in contraceptive use \npatterns among sexually active women.”31  With respect to teens, the Santelli and Melnikas study \ncited by IOM 2011 observes that, between 1960 and 1990, as contraceptive use increased, teen \nsexual activity outside of marriage likewise increased (although the study does not assert a causal \nrelationship).32  Another study, which proposed an economic model for the decision to engage in \nsexual activity, stated that “[p]rograms that increase access to contraception are found to \ndecrease teen pregnancies in the short run but increase teen pregnancies in the long run.”33 \nRegarding emergency contraception in particular, “[i]ncreased access to emergency \n                                                           \n29 H.

In 2016, HRSA awarded a 5-year cooperative \nagreement to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to develop \nrecommendations for updated Women’s Preventive Services Guidelines.  The awardee formed \nan expert panel called the Women’s Preventive Services Initiative that issued a report (the WPSI \nreport).44  After observing that “[p]rivate companies are increasingly challenging the \ncontraception provisions in the Affordable Care Act,” the WPSI report cited studies through \n2013 stating that application of HRSA Guidelines had applied preventive services coverage to \n                                                           \n41 Id. \n42 Id.

Id. at 57–58.  The WPSI report \nrelied on a 2015 report of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation \n(ASPE), “The Affordable Care Act Is Improving Access to Preventive Services for Millions of \nAmericans,” which estimated that persons who have private insurance coverage of preventive \nservices without cost sharing includes 55.6 million women.45  \nAs discussed above and based on the Departments’ knowledge of litigation challenging \nthe Mandate, during the time ASPE estimated the scope of preventive services coverage (2011–\n2013), houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries were exempt from the Mandate, other \nobjecting religious nonprofit organizations were protected by the temporary safe harbor, and \nhundreds of accommodated self-insured church plan entities were not subject to enforcement of \nthe Mandate through their third party administrators.  In addition, dozens of for-profit entities \nthat had filed lawsuits challenging the Mandate were protected by court orders pending the \nSupreme Court’s resolution of Hobby Lobby in June 2014.  It would therefore appear that the \nbenefits recorded by the report occurred even though most objecting entities were not in \ncompliance.46  Additional data indicates that, in 28 States where contraceptive coverage \n                                                           \n45 Available at https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/affordable-care-act-improving-access-preventive-services-millions-\namericans; also, see Abridged Report, available at https://www.womenspreventivehealth.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/01/WPSI_2016AbridgedReport.pdf. \n46 In addition, as in IOM 2011, the WPSI report bases its evidentiary conclusions relating to contraceptive coverage, \nuse, unintended pregnancy, and health benefits, on conclusions that the phenomena are “associated” with the \nintended outcomes, without showing there is a causal relationship.  For example, the WPSI report states that \n“[c]ontraceptive counseling in primary care may increase the uptake of hormonal methods and [long-acting \nreversible contraceptives], although data on structured counseling in specialized reproductive health settings \ndemonstrated no such effect.” Id. at 63.  The WPSI report also acknowledges that a large-scale study evaluating the \neffects of providing no-cost contraception had “no randomization or control group.” Id. at 63. \nThe WPSI report also identifies the at-risk population as young, low-income, and/or minority women: “[u]nintended \npregnancies disproportionately occur in women age 18 to 24 years, especially among those with low incomes or \nfrom racial/ethnic minorities.” Id. at 58.  The WPSI report acknowledges that many in this population are already \nserved by Title X programs, which provide family planning services to “approximately 1 million teens each year.” \nId. at 58.  The WPSI report observes that between 2008 and 2011—before the contraceptive coverage requirement \n \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 51 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     50  \n \nmandates have been imposed statewide, those mandates have not necessarily lowered rates of \nunintended pregnancy (or abortion) overall.47  \nThe Departments need not take a position on these empirical questions.  Our review is \nsufficient to lead us to conclude that significantly more uncertainty and ambiguity exists in the \nrecord than the Departments previously acknowledged when we declined to extend the \nexemption to certain objecting organizations and individuals as set forth herein, and that no \ncompelling interest exists to counsel against us extending the exemption.   \nDuring public comment periods, some commenters noted that some drugs included in the \npreventive services contraceptive Mandate can also be useful for treating certain existing health \nconditions.  The IOM similarly stated that “the non-contraceptive benefits of hormonal \ncontraception include treatment of menstrual disorders, acne or hirsutism, and pelvic pain.” IOM \n2011 at 107.  Consequently, some commenters suggested that religious objections to the \nMandate should not be permitted in cases where such methods are used to treat such conditions, \neven if those methods can also be used for contraceptive purposes.  Section 2713(a)(4) of the \nPHS Act does not, however, apply to non-preventive care provided solely for treatment of an \nexisting condition.  It applies only to “such additional preventive care and screenings . . . as \nprovided for” by HRSA (Section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act).  HRSA’s Guidelines implementing \nthis section state repeatedly that they apply to “preventive” services or care, and with respect to \nthe coverage of contraception specifically, they declare that the methods covered are \n“contraceptive” methods as a “Type of Preventive Service,” and that they are to be covered only \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nwas implemented—unintended pregnancy decreased to the lowest rate in 30 years. Id. at 58.  The WPSI report does \nnot address how to balance contraceptive coverage interests with religious objections, nor does it specify the extent \nto which applying the Mandate among commercially insured at objecting entities serves to deliver contraceptive \ncoverage to women most at risk of unintended pregnancy.  \n47 See Michael J. New, “Analyzing the Impact of State Level Contraception Mandates on Public Health Outcomes,” \n13 Ave Maria L. Rev. 345 (2015), available at http://avemarialaw-law-\nreview.avemarialaw.edu/Content/articles/vXIII.i2.new.final.0809.pdf. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 52 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     51  \n \n“[a]s prescribed” by a physician or other health care provider. \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/  The contraceptive coverage requirement in the \nGuidelines also only applies for “women with reproductive capacity.” \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/;  (80 FR 40318).  Therefore, the Guidelines’ inclusion \nof contraceptive services requires coverage of contraceptive methods as a type of preventive \nservice only when a drug that the FDA has approved for contraceptive use is prescribed in whole \nor in part for such use.  The Guidelines and section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act do not require \ncoverage of such drugs where they are prescribed exclusively for a non-contraceptive and non-\npreventive use to treat an existing condition.48  As discussed above, the last Administration \ndecided to exempt houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries from the Mandate, and to \nrelieve hundreds of religious nonprofit organizations of their obligations under the Mandate and \nnot further require contraceptive coverage to their employees.  In several of the lawsuits \nchallenging the Mandate, some religious plaintiffs stated that they do not object and are willing \nto cover drugs prescribed for the treatment of an existing condition and not for contraceptive \npurposes—even if those drugs are also approved by the FDA for contraceptive uses.  Therefore, \nthe Departments conclude that the fact that some drugs that are approved for preventive \n                                                           \n48 The Departments previously cited the IOM’s listing of existing conditions that contraceptive drugs can be used to \ntreat (menstrual disorders, acne, and pelvic pain), and said of those uses that “there are demonstrated preventive \nhealth benefits from contraceptives relating to conditions other than pregnancy.” 77 FR 8727 & n.7.  This was not, \nhowever, an assertion that PHS Act section 2713(a)(4) or the Guidelines require coverage of “contraceptive” \nmethods when prescribed for an exclusively non-contraceptive, non-preventive use.  Instead it was an observation \nthat such drugs—generally referred to as “contraceptives”—also have some alternate beneficial uses to treat existing \nconditions.  For the purposes of these interim final rules, the Departments clarify here that our previous reference to \nthe benefits of using contraceptive drugs exclusively for some non-contraceptive and non-preventive uses to treat \nexisting conditions did not mean that the Guidelines require coverage of such uses, and consequently is not a reason \nto refrain from offering the expanded exemptions provided here.  Where a drug approved by the FDA for \ncontraceptive use is prescribed for both a contraceptive use and a non-contraceptive use, the Guidelines (to the \nextent they apply) would require its coverage.  Where a drug approved by the FDA for contraceptive use is \nprescribed exclusively for a non-contraceptive and non-preventive use to treat an existing condition, it would be \noutside the scope of the Guidelines. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 53 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     52  \n \ncontraceptive purposes can also be used for exclusively non-preventive purposes to treat existing \nconditions is not a sufficient reason to refrain from expanding the exemption to the Mandate. \nAn additional consideration supporting the Departments’ present view is that alternative \napproaches can further the interests the Departments previously identified behind the Mandate. \nAs noted above, the Government already engages in dozens of programs that subsidize \ncontraception for the low-income women identified by the IOM as the most at risk for \nunintended pregnancy.  The Departments have also acknowledged in legal briefing that \ncontraception access can be provided through means other than coverage offered by religious \nobjectors, for example, through “a family member’s employer,” “an Exchange,” or “another \ngovernment program.”49  \nMany employer plan sponsors, institutions of education arranging student health \ncoverage, and individuals enrolled in plans where their employers or issuers (as applicable) are \nwilling to offer them a religiously acceptable plan, hold sincerely held religious beliefs against \n(respectively) providing, arranging, or participating in plans that comply with the Mandate either \nby providing contraceptive coverage or by using the accommodation.  Because we have \nconcluded that requiring such compliance through the Mandate or accommodation has \nconstituted a substantial burden on the religious exercise of many such entities or individuals, \nand because we conclude requiring such compliance did not serve a compelling interest and was \nnot the least restrictive means of serving a compelling interest, we now believe that requiring \nsuch compliance led to the violation of RFRA in many instances.  We recognize that this is a \nchange of position on this issue, and we make that change based on all the matters discussed in \nthis preamble. \n                                                           \n49 Brief for the Respondents at 65, Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016) (No. 14-1418).   \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 54 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     53  \n \nB.  Discretion to Provide Religious Exemptions \nEven if RFRA does not compel the religious exemptions provided in these interim final \nrules, the Departments believe they are the most appropriate administrative response to the \nreligious objections that have been raised.  RFRA identifies certain circumstance under which \ngovernment must accommodate religious exercise-when a government action imposes a \nsubstantial burden on the religious exercise of an adherent and imposition of that burden is not \nthe least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest.  RFRA does not, \nhowever, prescribe the accommodation that the government must adopt.  Rather, agencies have \ndiscretion to fashion an appropriate and administrable response to respect religious liberty \ninterests implicated by their own regulations.  We know from Hobby Lobby that, in the absence \nof any accommodation, the contraceptive-coverage requirement imposes a substantial burden on \ncertain objecting employers.  We know from other lawsuits and public comments that many \nreligious entities have objections to complying with the accommodation based on their sincerely \nheld religious beliefs.  Previously, the Departments attempted to develop an accommodation that \nwould either alleviate the substantial burden imposed on religious exercise or satisfy RFRA's \nrequirements for imposing that burden.  \nNow, however, the Departments have reassessed the relevant interests and determined \nthat, even if exemptions are not required by RFRA, they would exercise their discretion to \naddress the substantial burden identified in Hobby Lobby by expanding the exemptions from the \nMandate instead of revising accommodations previously offered.  In the Departments’ view, a \nbroader exemption is a more direct, effective means of satisfying all bona fide religious \nobjectors.  This view is informed by the fact that the Departments’ previous attempt to develop \nan appropriate accommodation did not satisfy all objectors.  That previous accommodation \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 55 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     54  \n \nconsumed Departmental resources not only through the regulatory process, but in persistent \nlitigation and negotiations.  Offering exemptions as described in these interim final rules is a \nmore workable way to respond to the substantial burden identified in Hobby Lobby and bring \nyears of litigation concerning the Mandate to a close. \nC.  General Scope of Expanded Religious Exemptions \n1.  Exemption and Accommodation for Religious Employers, Plan Sponsors, and Institutions of  \nHigher Education \nFor all of these reasons, and as further explained below, the Departments now believe it \nis appropriate to modify the scope of the discretion afforded to HRSA in the July 2015 final \nregulations to direct HRSA to provide the expanded exemptions and change the accommodation \nto an optional process if HRSA continues to otherwise provide for contraceptive coverage in the \nGuidelines.  As set forth below, the expanded exemption encompasses non-governmental plan \nsponsors that object based on sincerely held religious beliefs, and institutions of higher education \nin their arrangement of student health  plans.  The accommodation is also maintained as an \noptional process for exempt employers, and will provide contraceptive availability for persons \ncovered by the plans of entities that use it (a legitimate program purpose). \nThe Departments believe this approach is sufficiently respectful of religious objections \nwhile still allowing the Government to advance other interests.  Even with the expanded \nexemption, HRSA maintains the discretion to require contraceptive coverage for nearly all \nentities to which the Mandate previously applied (since most plan sponsors do not appear to \npossess the requisite religious objections), and to reconsider those interests in the future where \nno covered objection exists.  Other Government subsidies of contraception are likewise not \naffected by this rule.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 56 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     55  \n \n2.  Exemption for Objecting Individuals Covered by Willing Employers and Issuers \nAs noted above, some individuals have brought suit objecting to being covered under an \ninsurance policy that includes coverage for contraceptives.  See, for example, Wieland v. HHS, \n196 F.  Supp. 3d 1010 (E.D. Mo. 2016); Soda v. McGettigan, No. 15-cv-00898 (D. Md.).  Just as \nthe Departments have determined that the Government does not have a compelling interest in \napplying the Mandate to employers that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, \nwe have also concluded that the Government does not have a compelling interest in requiring \nindividuals to be covered by policies that include contraceptive coverage when the individuals \nhave sincerely held religious objections to that coverage.  The Government does not have an \ninterest in ensuring the provision of contraceptive coverage to individuals who do not wish to \nhave such coverage.  Especially relevant to this conclusion is the fact that the Departments have \ndescribed their interests of health and gender equality as being advanced among women who \n“want” the coverage so as to prevent “unintended” pregnancy.  (77 FR 8727).50  No asserted \ninterest is served by denying an exemption to individuals who object to it.  No unintended \npregnancies will be avoided or costs reduced by imposing the coverage on those individuals.  \nAlthough the Departments previously took the position that allowing individual religious \nexemptions would undermine the workability of the insurance system, the Departments now \nagree with those district courts that have concluded that an exemption that allows—but does not \nrequire—issuers and employers to omit contraceptives from coverage provided to objecting \nindividuals does not undermine any compelling interest.  See Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1019–\n20; March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 132.  The individual exemption will only apply where the \n                                                           \n50 In this respect, the Government’s interest in contraceptive coverage is different than its interest in persons \nreceiving some other kinds of health coverage or coverage in general, which can lead to important benefits that are \nnot necessarily conditional on the recipient’s desire to use the coverage and the specific benefits that may result \nfrom their choice to use it. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 57 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     56  \n \nemployer and issuer (or, in the individual market, the issuer) are willing to offer a policy \naccommodating the objecting individual.  As a result, the Departments consider it likely that \nwhere an individual exemption is invoked, it will impose no burdens on the insurance market \nbecause such burdens may be factored into the willingness of an employer or issuer to offer such \ncoverage.  At the level of plan offerings, the extent to which plans cover contraception under the \nprior rules is already far from uniform.  Congress did not require compliance with section 2713 \nof the PHS Act by all entities—in particular by grandfathered plans.  The Departments’ previous \nexemption for houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries, and our lack of authority to enforce \nthe accommodation with respect to self-insured church plans, show that the importance of a \nuniform health insurance system is not significantly harmed by allowing plans to omit \ncontraception in many contexts.51  Furthermore, granting exemptions to individuals who do not \nwish to receive contraceptive coverage where the plan and, as applicable, issuer and plan sponsor \nare willing, does not undermine the Government’s interest in ensuring the provision of such \ncoverage to other individuals who wish to receive it.  Nor do such exemptions undermine the \noperation of the many other programs subsidizing contraception.  Rather, such exemptions serve \nthe Government’s interest in accommodating religious exercise.  Accordingly, as further \nexplained below, the Departments have provided an exemption to address the concerns of \nobjecting individuals.  \n                                                           \n51 Also, see Real Alternatives, 2017 WL 3324690 at *36 (3d Cir. Aug. 4, 2017) (Jordan, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part) (“Because insurance companies would offer such plans as a result of market forces, doing so \nwould not undermine the government's interest in a sustainable and functioning market.…  Because the government \nhas failed to demonstrate why allowing such a system (not unlike the one that allowed wider choice before the \nAffordable Care Act) would be unworkable, it has not satisfied strict scrutiny.” (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 58 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     57  \n \nD.  Effects on Third Parties of Exemptions \nThe Departments note that the exemptions created here, like the exemptions created by \nthe last Administration, do not burden third parties to a degree that counsels against providing \nthe exemptions.  Congress did not create a right to receive contraceptive coverage, and Congress \nexplicitly chose not to impose the section 2713 of the PHS Act requirements on grandfathered \nplans that cover millions of people.  Individuals who are unable to obtain contraceptive coverage \nthrough their employer-sponsored health plans because of the exemptions created in these \ninterim final rules, or because of other exemptions to the Mandate, have other avenues for \nobtaining contraception, including the various governmental programs discussed above.  As the \nGovernment is under no constitutional obligation to fund contraception, cf. Harris v. McRae, 448 \nUnited States 297 (1980), even more so may the Government refrain from requiring private \ncitizens to cover contraception for other citizens in violation of their religious beliefs.  Cf. Rust \nv. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 192–93 (1991) (“A refusal to fund protected activity, without more, \ncannot be equated with the imposition of a ‘penalty’ on that activity.”).52  \nThat conclusion is consistent with the Supreme Court’s observation that RFRA may \nrequire exemptions even from laws requiring claimants “to confer benefits on third parties.” \nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781 n.37.  The burdens imposed on such third parties may be \nrelevant to the RFRA analysis, but they cannot be dispositive. “Otherwise, for example, the \nGovernment could decide that all supermarkets must sell alcohol for the convenience of \ncustomers (and thereby exclude Muslims with religious objections from owning supermarkets), \nor it could decide that all restaurants must remain open on Saturdays to give employees an \n                                                           \n52 Cf. also Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Am. Ass’n of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 257 P.3d 181, \n196 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011) (“a woman’s right to an abortion or to contraception does not compel a private person or \nentity to facilitate either.”). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 59 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     58  \n \nopportunity to earn tips (and thereby exclude Jews with religious objections from owning \nrestaurants).” Id.  Where, as here, contraceptives are readily accessible and, for many low \nincome persons, are available at reduced cost or for free through various governmental programs, \nand contraceptive coverage may be available through State sources or family plans obtained \nthrough non-objecting employers, the Departments have determined that the expanded \nexemptions rather than accommodations are the appropriate response to the substantial burden \nthat the Mandate has placed upon the religious exercise of many religious employers. \nIII.  Provisions of the Interim Final Rules With Comment Period \nThe Departments are issuing these interim final rules in light of the full history of \nrelevant rulemaking (including prior interim final rules), public comments, and litigation \nthroughout the Federal court system.  The interim final rules seek to resolve this matter and the \nlong-running litigation with respect to religious objections by extending the exemption under the \nHRSA Guidelines to encompass entities, and individuals, with sincerely held religious beliefs \nobjecting to contraceptive or sterilization coverage, and by making the accommodation process \noptional for eligible organizations.  \nThe Departments acknowledge that the foregoing analysis represents a change from the \npolicies and interpretations we previously adopted with respect to the Mandate and the \ngovernmental interests that underlie the Mandate.  These changes in policy are within the \nDepartments’ authority.  As the Supreme Court has acknowledged, “[a]gencies are free to \nchange their existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.” \nEncino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2016).  This “reasoned analysis” \nrequirement does not demand that an agency “demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the \nreasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 60 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     59  \n \npolicy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency \nbelieves it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates”.  United \nStudent Aid Funds, Inc. v. King, 200 F. Supp. 3d 163, 169–70 (D.D.C. 2016) (citing FCC v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)); also, see New Edge Network, Inc. v. FCC, \n461 F.3d 1105, 1112–13 (9th Cir. 2006) (rejecting an argument that “an agency changing its \ncourse by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that \nwhich may be required when an agency does not act in the first instance”).   \nHere, for all of the reasons discussed above, the Departments have determined that the \nGovernment’s interest in the application of contraceptive coverage requirements in this specific \ncontext to the plans of certain entities and individuals does not outweigh the sincerely held \nreligious objections of those entities and individuals based on the analyses set forth above.  Thus, \nthese interim final rules amend the Departments’ July 2015 final regulations to expand the \nexemption to include additional entities and persons that object based on sincerely held religious \nbeliefs.  These rules leave in place HRSA’s discretion to continue to require contraceptive and \nsterilization coverage where no such objection exists, and to the extent that section 2713 of the \nPHS Act applies.  These interim final rules also maintain the existence of an accommodation \nprocess, but consistent with our expansion of the exemption, we make the process optional for \neligible organizations.  HRSA is simultaneously updating its Guidelines to reflect the \nrequirements of these interim final rules.53 \nA.  Regulatory Restatements of section 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PHS Act \nThese interim final rules modify the restatements of the requirements of section 2713(a) \nand (a)(4) of the PHS Act, contained in 26 CFR 54.9815-2713(a)(1) introductory text and \n                                                           \n53 See https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ and https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines2016/index.html . \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 61 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     60  \n \n(a)(1)(iv), 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1) introductory text and (a)(1)(iv), and 45 CFR \n147.130(a)(1) introductory text and (a)(1)(iv), so that they conform to the statutory text of \nsection 2713 of the PHS Act.   \nB.  Prefatory Language of the Exemption in 45 CFR 147.132 \nThese interim final rules move the religious exemption from 45 CFR 147.131 to a new § \n147.132 and expand it as follows.  In the prefatory language of § 147.132, these interim final \nrules specify that not only are certain entities “exempt,” but the Guidelines shall not support or \nprovide for an imposition of the contraceptive coverage requirement to such entities.  This is an \nacknowledgement that section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act requires women’s preventive services \ncoverage only “as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration.”  To the extent the HRSA Guidelines do not provide for or support \nthe application of such coverage to exempt entities, the Affordable Care Act does not require the \ncoverage.  Section 147.132 not only describes the exemption of certain entities and plans, but \ndoes so by specifying that the HRSA Guidelines do not provide for, or support the application of, \nsuch coverage to exempt entities and plans. \nC.  General Scope of Exemption for Objecting Entities   \nIn the new 45 CFR 147.132 as created by these interim final rules, these rules expand the \nexemption that was previously located in § 147.131(a).  With respect to employers that sponsor \ngroup health plans, the new language of § 147.132(a)(1) introductory text and (a)(1)(i) provides \nexemptions for employers that object to coverage of all or a subset of contraceptives or \nsterilization and related patient education and counseling based on sincerely held religious \nbeliefs.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 62 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     61  \n \nFor avoidance of doubt, the Departments wish to make clear that the expanded exemption \ncreated in § 147.132(a) applies to several distinct entities involved in the provision of coverage \nto the objecting employer’s employees.  This explanation is consistent with how prior rules have \nworked by means of similar language.  Section 147.132(a)(1) introductory text and (a)(1)(i), by \nspecifying that “[a] group health plan and health insurance coverage provided in connection with \na group health plan” is exempt “to the extent the plan sponsor objects as specified in paragraph \n(a)(2),” exempt the group health plans the sponsors of which object, and exempt their health \ninsurance issuers from providing the coverage in those plans (whether or not the issuers have \ntheir own objections).  Consequently, with respect to Guidelines issued under § \n147.130(a)(1)(iv), or the parallel provisions in 26 CFR 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) and 29 CFR \n2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), the plan sponsor, issuer, and plan covered in the exemption of that \nparagraph would face no penalty as a result of omitting contraceptive coverage from the benefits \nof the plan participants and beneficiaries.  \nConsistent with the restated exemption, exempt entities will not be required to comply \nwith a self-certification process.  Although exempt entities do not need to file notices or \ncertifications of their exemption, and these interim final rules do not impose any new notice \nrequirements on them, existing ERISA rules governing group health plans require that, with \nrespect to plans subject to ERISA, a plan document must include a comprehensive summary of \nthe benefits covered by the plan and a statement of the conditions for eligibility to receive \nbenefits.  Under ERISA, the plan document provides what benefits are provided to participants \nand beneficiaries under the plan and, therefore, if an objecting employer would like to exclude \nall or a subset of contraceptive services, it must ensure that the exclusion is clear in the plan \ndocument.  Moreover, if there is a reduction in a covered service or benefit, the plan has to \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 63 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     62  \n \ndisclose that change to plan participants.54  Thus, where an exemption applies and all or a subset \nof contraceptive services are omitted from a plan’s coverage, otherwise applicable ERISA \ndisclosures must reflect the omission of coverage in ERISA plans.  These existing disclosure \nrequirements serve to help provide notice to participants and beneficiaries of what ERISA plans \ndo and do not cover.  The Departments invite public comment on whether exempt entities, or \nothers, would find value either in being able to maintain or submit a specific form of certification \nto claim their exemption, or in otherwise receiving guidance on a way to document their \nexemption. \nThe exemptions in § 147.132(a) apply “to the extent” of the objecting entities’ sincerely \nheld religious beliefs.  Thus, entities that hold a requisite objection to covering some, but not all, \ncontraceptive items would be exempt with respect to the items to which they object, but not with \nrespect to the items to which they do not object.  Likewise, the requisite objection of a plan \nsponsor or institution of higher education in § 147.132(a)(1)(i) and (ii) exempts its group health \nplan, health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer in connection with such \nplan, and its issuer in its offering of such coverage, but that exemption does not extend to \ncoverage provided by that issuer to other group health plans where the plan sponsor has no \nqualifying objection.  The objection of a health insurance issuer in § 147.132(a)(1)(iii) similarly \noperates only to the extent of its objection, and as otherwise limited as described below. \nD.  Exemption of Employers and Institutions of Higher Education \nThe scope of the exemption is expanded for non-governmental plan sponsors and certain \nentities that arrange health coverage under these interim final rules.  The Departments have \n                                                           \n54 See, for example, 29 U.S.C. 1022, 1024(b), 29 CFR 2520.102-2, 2520.102-3, & 2520.104b-3(d), and 29 CFR \n2590.715-2715.  Also, see 45 CFR 147.200 (requiring disclosure of the “exceptions, reductions, and limitations of \nthe coverage,” including group health plans and group & individual issuers). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 64 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     63  \n \nconsistently taken the position that section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act grants HRSA authority to \nissue Guidelines that provide for and support exemptions from a contraceptive coverage \nrequirement.  Since the beginning of rulemaking concerning the Mandate, HRSA and the \nDepartments have repeatedly exercised their discretion to create and modify various exemptions \nwithin the Guidelines.55  \nThe Departments believe the approach of these interim final rules better aligns our \nimplementation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act with Congress’ intent in the Affordable \nCare Act and throughout other Federal health care laws.  As discussed above, many Federal \nhealth care laws and regulations provide exemptions for objections based on religious beliefs, \nand RFRA applies to the Affordable Care Act.  Expanding the exemption removes religious \nobstacles that entities and certain individuals may face when they otherwise wish to participate in \nthe health care market.  This advances the Affordable Care Acts goal of expanding health \ncoverage among entities and individuals that might otherwise be reluctant to participate.  These \nrules also leave in place many Federal programs that subsidize contraceptives for women who \nare most at risk of unintended pregnancy and who may have more limited access to \ncontraceptives.56  These interim final rules achieve greater uniformity and simplicity in the \nregulation of health insurance by expanding the exemptions to include entities that object to the \nMandate based on their sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n                                                           \n55 “The fact that the agency has adopted different definitions in different contexts adds force to the argument that the \ndefinition itself is flexible, particularly since Congress has never indicated any disapproval of a flexible reading of \nthe statute.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 863–64 (1984). \n56 See, for example, Family Planning grants in 42 U.S.C. 300, et seq.; the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Program, \nPublic Law 112-74 (125 Stat 786, 1080); the Healthy Start Program, 42 U.S.C. 254c-8; the Maternal, Infant, and \nEarly Childhood Home Visiting Program, 42 U.S.C. 711; Maternal and Child Health Block Grants, 42 U.S.C. 703; \n42 U.S.C. 247b-12; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq.; the Indian Health Service, 25 \nU.S.C. 13, 42 U.S.C. 2001(a), & 25 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.; Health center grants, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), (g), (h), & (i); the \nNIH Clinical Center, 42 U.S.C. 248; and the Personal Responsibility Education Program, 42 U.S.C. 713.   \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 65 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     64  \n \nThe Departments further conclude that it would be inadequate to merely attempt to \namend the accommodation process instead of expand the exemption.  The Departments have \nstated in our regulations and court briefings that the existing accommodation with respect to self-\ninsured plans requires contraceptive coverage as part of the same plan as the coverage provided \nby the employer, and operates in a way “seamless” to those plans.  As a result, in significant \nrespects, the accommodation process does not actually accommodate the objections of many \nentities.  The Departments have engaged in an effort to attempt to identify an accommodation \nthat would eliminate the plaintiffs’ religious objections, including seeking public comment \nthrough an RFI, but we stated in January 2017 that we were unable to develop such an approach \nat that time.  \n1.  Plan Sponsors Generally \nThe expanded exemptions in these interim final rules cover any kind of non-\ngovernmental employer plan sponsor with the requisite objections but, for the sake of clarity, \nthey include an illustrative, non-exhaustive list of employers whose objections qualify the plans \nthey sponsor for an exemption.  \nUnder these interim final rules, the Departments do not limit the Guidelines exemption \nwith reference to nonprofit status or to sections 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, as previous \nrules have done.  A significant majority of States either impose no contraceptive coverage \nrequirement or offer broader exemptions than the exemption contained in the July 2015 final \nregulations.57  Although the practice of States is by no means a limit on the discretion delegated \nto HRSA by the Affordable Care Act, nor a statement about what the Federal Government may \ndo consistent with RFRA or other limitations in federal law, such State practice can be \n                                                           \n57 See Guttmacher Institute, “Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives” available at https://www.guttmacher.org/state-\npolicy/explore/insurance-coverage-contraceptives. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 66 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     65  \n \ninformative as to the viability of broad protections for religious liberty.  In this case, such \npractice supports the Departments’ decision to expand the federal exemption, bringing the \nFederal Government’s practice into greater alignment with the practices of the majority of the \nStates. \n2.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A) \nDespite not limiting the exemption to certain organizations referred to in section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, the exemption in these rules includes such organizations. \nSection 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A) specifies, as under the prior exemption, that the exemption covers “a \ngroup health plan established or maintained by ... [a] church, the integrated auxiliary of a church, \na convention or association of churches, or a religious order.”  In the preamble to rules setting \nforth the prior exemption at §147.132(a), the Departments interpreted this same language used in \nthose rules by declaring that “[t]he final regulations continue to provide that the availability of \nthe exemption or accommodation be determined on an employer by employer basis, which the \nDepartments continue to believe best balances the interests of religious employers and eligible \norganizations and those of employees and their dependents.”  (78 FR 39886).  Therefore, under \nthe prior exemption, if an employer participated in a house of worship’s plan—perhaps because \nit was affiliated with a house of worship—but was not an integrated auxiliary or a house of \nworship itself, that employer was not considered to be covered by the exemption, even though it \nwas, in the ordinary meaning of the text of the prior regulation, participating in a “plan \nestablished or maintained by a [house of worship].”  \nUnder these interim final rules, however, the Departments intend that, when this \nregulation text exempts a plan “established or maintained by” a house of worship or integrated \nauxiliary, such exemption will no longer “be determined on an employer by employer basis,” but \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 67 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     66  \n \nwill be determined on a plan basis—that is, by whether the plan is a “plan established or \nmaintained by” a house of worship or integrated auxiliary.  This interpretation better conforms to \nthe text of the regulation setting forth the exemption—in both the prior regulation and in the text \nset forth in these interim final rules.  It also offers appropriate respect to houses of worship and \ntheir integrated auxiliaries not only in their internal employment practices but in their choice of \norganizational form and/or in their activity of establishing or maintaining health plans for \nemployees of associated employers that do not meet the threshold of being integrated auxiliaries.  \nMoreover, under this interpretation, houses of worship would not be faced with the potential \nprospect of services to which they have a religious objection being covered for employees of an \nassociated employer participating in a plan they have established and maintain.  \nThe Departments do not believe there is a sufficient factual basis to exclude from this \npart of the exemption entities that are so closely associated with a house of worship or integrated \nauxiliary that they are permitted participation in its health plan, but are not themselves integrated \nauxiliaries.  Additionally, this interpretation is not inconsistent with the operation of the \naccommodation under the prior rule, to the extent that, in practice and as discussed elsewhere \nherein, it does not force contraceptive coverage to be provided on behalf of the plan participants \nof many religious organizations in a self-insured church plan exempt from ERISA—which are \nexempt in part because the plans are established and maintained by a church.  (Section 3(33)(A) \nof ERISA)  In several lawsuits challenging the Mandate, the Departments took the position that \nsome plans established and maintained by houses of worship, but that included entities that were \nnot integrated auxiliaries, were church plans under section 3(33) of ERISA and, thus, the \nGovernment “has no authority to require the plaintiffs’ TPAs to provide contraceptive coverage \nat this time.” Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 68 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     67  \n \n(E.D.N.Y. 2013).  Therefore the Departments believe it is most appropriate to use a plan basis, \nnot an employer by employer basis, to determine the scope of an exemption for a group health \nplan established or maintained by a house of worship or integrated auxiliary. \n3.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(B) \nSection 147.132(a)(1)(i)(B) of the rules specifies that the exemption includes the plans of \nplan sponsors that are nonprofit organizations.  \n4.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(C) \nUnder § 147.132(a)(1)(i)(C), the rules extend the exemption to the plans of closely held \nfor-profit entities.  This is consistent with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Hobby Lobby, which \ndeclared that a corporate entity is capable of possessing and pursuing non-pecuniary goals (in \nHobby Lobby, religion), regardless of whether the entity operates as a nonprofit organization, \nand rejecting the Departments’ argument to the contrary.  (134 S. Ct. 2768–75)  Some reports \nand industry experts have indicated that not many for-profit entities beyond those that had \noriginally brought suit have sought relief from the Mandate after Hobby Lobby.58  \n5.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(D) \nUnder § 147.132(a)(1)(i)(D), the rules extend the exemption to the plans of for-profit \nentities that are not closely held.  The July 2015 final regulations extended the accommodation to \nfor-profit entities only if they are closely held, by positively defining what constitutes a closely \nheld entity.  The Departments implicitly recognized the difficulty of providing an affirmative \ndefinition of closely held entities in the July 2015 final regulations when we adopted a definition \nthat included entities that are merely “substantially similar” to certain specified parameters, and \nwe allowed entities that were not sure if they met the definition to inquire with HHS;  HHS was \n                                                           \n58 See Jennifer Haberkorn, “Two years later, few Hobby Lobby copycats emerge,” Politico (Oct. 11, 2016), \navailable at http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obamacare-birth-control-mandate-employers-229627. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 69 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     68  \n \npermitted to decline to answer the inquiry, at which time the entity would be deemed to qualify \nas an eligible organization.  The exemptions in these interim final rules do not need to address \nthis difficulty because they include both for-profit entities that are closely held and for-profit \nentities that are not closely held.59  The mechanisms for determining whether a company has \nadopted and holds such principles or views is a matter of well-established State law with respect \nto corporate decision-making,60 and the Departments expect that application of such laws would \ncabin the scope of this exemption.  \nIn including entities in the exemption that are not closely held, these interim final rules \nprovide for the possibility that some publicly traded entities may use the exemption.  Even \nthough the Supreme Court did not extend its holding in Hobby Lobby to publicly traded \ncorporations (the matter could be resolved without deciding that question), the Court did instruct \nthat RFRA applies to corporations because they are “persons” as that term is defined in 1 U.S.C. \n1.  Given that the definition under 1 U.S.C. 1 applies to any corporation, the Departments \nconsider it appropriate to extend the exemption set forth in these interim final rules to for-profit \ncorporations whether or not they are closely held.  The Departments are generally aware that in a \ncountry as large as America comprised of a supermajority of religious persons, some publicly \ntraded entities might claim a religious character for their company, or that the majority of shares \n(or voting shares) of some publicly traded companies might be controlled by a small group of \n                                                           \n59 In the companion interim final rules published elsewhere in this Federal Register, the Departments provide an \nexemption on an interim final basis to closely held entities by using a negative definition: entities that do not have \npublicly traded ownership interests as defined by certain securities required to be registered under section 12 of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934.  Although this is a more workable definition than set forth in our previous rules, \nwe have determined that it is appropriate to offer the expanded religious exemptions to certain entities whether or \nnot they have publicly traded ownership interests. \n60 Although the Departments do not prescribe any form or notification, they would expect that such principles or \nviews would have been adopted and documented in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction under which they \nare incorporated or organized. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 70 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     69  \n \nreligiously devout persons so as to set forth such a religious character.61  The fact that such a \ncompany is religious does not mean that it will have an objection to contraceptive coverage, and \nthere are many fewer publicly traded companies than there are closely held ones.  But our \nexperience with closely held companies is that some, albeit a small minority, do have religious \nobjections to contraceptive coverage.  Thus we consider it possible, though very unlikely, that a \nreligious publicly traded company might have objections to contraceptive coverage.  At the same \ntime, we are not aware of any publicly traded entities that challenged the Mandate specifically \neither publicly or in court.  The Departments agree with the Supreme Court that it is improbable \nthat many publicly traded companies with numerous “unrelated shareholders—including \ninstitutional investors with their own set of stakeholders—would agree to run a corporation \nunder the same religious beliefs” and thereby qualify for the exemption.  (134 S. Ct. at 2774) \n6.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(E) \nUnder § 147.132(a)(1)(i)(E), the rules extend the exemption to the plans of any other \nnon-governmental employer.  The plans of governmental employers are not covered by the plan \nsponsor exemption of § 147.132(a)(1)(i).  The Departments are not aware of reasons why it \nwould be appropriate or necessary to offer religious exemptions to governmental employer plan \nsponsors in the United States with respect to the contraceptive Mandate.  But, as discussed \nbelow, governmental employers are permitted to respect an individual’s objection under § \n147.132(b) and thus to provide health insurance coverage without the objected-to contraceptive \ncoverage to such individual.  Where that exemption is operative, the Guidelines may not be \nconstrued to prevent a willing governmental plan sponsor of a group health plan from offering a \n                                                           \n61 See, e.g., Nasdaq.com, “4 Publicly Traded Religious Companies if You’re Looking to Invest in Faith” (Feb. 7, \n2014), available at http://www.nasdaq.com/article/4-publicly-traded-religious-companies-if-youre-looking-to-invest-\nin-faith-cm324665. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 71 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     70  \n \nseparate benefit package option, or a separate policy, certificate or contract of insurance, to any \nindividual who objects to coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services based on \nsincerely held religious beliefs. \nBy the general extension of the exemption to the plans of plan sponsors in  \n§ 147.132(a)(1)(i), these interim final rules also exempt group health plans sponsored by an \nentity other than an employer (for example, a union) that objects based on sincerely held \nreligious beliefs to coverage of contraceptives or sterilization.  \n7.  Section 147.132(a)(1)(ii) \nAs in the previous rules, the plans of institutions of higher education that arrange student \nhealth insurance coverage will continue to be treated similarly to the way in which the plans of \nemployers are treated, but for the purposes of such plans being exempt or electing the optional \naccommodation, rather than merely being eligible for the accommodation as in the previous rule.  \nThese interim final rules specify, in § 147.132(a)(1)(ii), that the exemption is extended, in the \ncase of institutions of higher education (as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1002), to their arrangement of \nstudent health insurance coverage, in a manner comparable to the applicability of the exemption \nfor group health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan established \nor maintained by a plan sponsor.  As mentioned above, because the Affordable Care Act does not \nrequire institutions of higher education to arrange student coverage, some institutions of higher \neducation that object to the Mandate appear to have chosen to stop arranging student plans rather \nthan comply with the Mandate or use the accommodation.  Extending the exemption in these \ninterim final rules may remove an obstacle to such entities deciding to offer student plans, \nthereby giving students another health insurance option. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 72 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     71  \n \nE.  Exemption for Issuers \nThese interim final rules extend the exemption, in § 147.132(a)(1)(iii), to health \ninsurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage that sincerely hold their \nown religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services.  \nThe Departments are not currently aware of health insurance issuers that possess their \nown religious objections to offering contraceptive coverage.  Nevertheless, many Federal health \ncare conscience laws and regulations protect issuers or plans specifically.  For example, 42 \nU.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u-2(b)(3) protect plans or managed care organizations in \nMedicaid or Medicare Advantage.  The Weldon Amendment protects HMOs, health insurance \nplans, and any other health care organizations are protected from being required to provide \ncoverage or pay for abortions.  See, for example, Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Pub. \nL. No. 115-31, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d).  Congress also declared this year that “it is the intent \nof Congress” to include a “conscience clause” which provides exceptions for religious beliefs if \nthe District of Columbia requires “the provision of contraceptive coverage by health insurance \nplans.”  See Id. at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808.  In light of the clearly expressed intent of \nCongress to protect religious liberty, particularly in certain health care contexts, along with the \nspecific efforts to protect issuers, the Departments have concluded that an exemption for issuers \nis appropriate. \n  As discussed above, where the exemption for plan sponsors or institutions of higher \neducation applies, issuers are exempt under those sections with respect to providing coverage in \nthose plans.  The issuer exemption in § 147.132(a)(1)(iii) adds to that protection, but the \nadditional protection operates in a different way than the plan sponsor exemption operates.  As \nset forth in these interim final rules, the only plan sponsors, or in the case of individual insurance \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 73 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     72  \n \ncoverage, individuals, who are eligible to purchase or enroll in health insurance coverage offered \nby an exempt issuer that does not cover some or all contraceptive services are plan sponsors or \nindividuals who themselves object and are otherwise exempt based on their objection.  Thus, the \nissuer exemption specifies that where a health insurance issuer providing group health insurance \ncoverage is exempt under paragraph (a)(1)(iii), the plan remains subject to any requirement to \nprovide coverage for contraceptive services under Guidelines issued under 42 CFR \n147.130(a)(1)(iv) unless the plan is otherwise exempt from that requirement. Accordingly, the \nonly plan sponsors, or in the case of individual insurance coverage, individuals, who are eligible \nto purchase or enroll in health insurance coverage offered by an issuer that is exempt under this \nparagraph (a)(1)(iii) that does not include coverage for some or all contraceptive services are \nplan sponsors or individuals who themselves object and are exempt.  Issuers that hold religious \nobjections should identify to plan sponsors the lack of contraceptive coverage in any health \ninsurance coverage being offered that is based on the issuer’s exemption, and communicate the \ngroup health plan’s independent obligation to provide contraceptive coverage, unless the group \nhealth plan itself is exempt under regulations governing the Mandate.  \nIn this way, the issuer exemption serves to protect objecting issuers both from being \nasked or required to issue policies that cover contraception in violation of the issuers’ sincerely \nheld religious beliefs, and from being asked or required to issue policies that omit contraceptive \ncoverage to non-exempt entities or individuals, thus subjecting the issuers to potential liability if \nthose plans are not exempt from the Guidelines.  At the same time, the issuer exemption will not \nserve to remove contraceptive coverage obligations from any plan or plan sponsor that is not also \nexempt, nor will it prevent other issuers from being required to provide contraceptive coverage \nin individual insurance coverage.  Permitting issuers to object to offering contraceptive coverage \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 74 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     73  \n \nbased on sincerely held religious beliefs will allow issuers to continue to offer coverage to plan \nsponsors and individuals, without subjecting them to liability under section 2713(a)(4) of the \nPHS Act or related provisions for their failure to provide contraceptive coverage.  \nThe issuer exemption does not specifically include third party administrators, although \nthe optional accommodation process provided under these interim final rules specifies that third \nparty administrators cannot be required to contract with an entity that invokes that process.  \nSome religious third party administrators have brought suit in conjunction with suits brought by \norganizations enrolled in ERISA-exempt church plans.  Such plans are now exempt under these \ninterim final rules, and their third party administrators, as claims processors, are under no \nobligation under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to provide benefits for contraceptive \nservices, as that section applies only to plans and issuers.  In the case of ERISA-covered plans, \nplan administrators are obligated under ERISA to follow the plan terms, but it is the \nDepartments’ understanding that third party administrators are not typically designated as plan \nadministrators under section 3(16) of ERISA and, therefore, would not normally act as plan \nadministrators under section 3(16) of ERISA.  Therefore, to the Departments’ knowledge, it is \nonly under the existing accommodation process that third party administrators are required to \nundertake any obligations to provide or arrange for contraceptive coverage to which they might \nobject.  These interim final rules make the accommodation process optional for employers and \nother plan sponsors, and specify that third party administrators that have their own objection to \ncomplying with the accommodation process may decline to enter into, or continue, contracts as \nthird party administrators of such plans.  For these reasons, these interim final rules do not \notherwise exempt third party administrators.  The Departments solicit public comment, however, \non whether there are situations where there may be an additional need to provide distinct \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 75 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     74  \n \nprotections for third party administrators that may have religious beliefs implicated by the \nMandate. \nF.  Scope of Objections Needed for the Objecting Entity Exemption \nExemptions for objecting entities specify that they apply where the entities object as \nspecified in § 147.132(a)(2).  That paragraph specifies that exemptions for objecting entities will \napply to the extent that an entity described in §147.132(a)(1) objects to its establishing, \nmaintaining, providing, offering, or arranging (as applicable) coverage, payments, or a plan that \nprovides coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services, based on its sincerely held \nreligious beliefs.  \nG.  Individual Exemption \nThese interim final rules include a special rule pertaining to individuals (referred to here \nas the “individual exemption”).  Section 147.132(b) provides that nothing in § 147.130(a)(1)(iv), \n26 CFR 54.9815–2713(a) (1)(iv), or 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), may be construed to \nprevent a willing plan sponsor of a group health plan or a willing health insurance issuer offering \ngroup or individual health insurance coverage, from offering a separate benefit package option, \nor a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance, to any individual who objects to \ncoverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services based on the individual’s sincerely \nheld religious beliefs.  The individual exemption extends to the coverage unit in which the plan \nparticipant, or subscriber in the individual market, is enrolled (for instance, to family coverage \ncovering the participant and his or her beneficiaries enrolled under the plan), but does not relieve \nthe plan’s or issuer’s obligation to comply with the Mandate with respect to the group health plan \nat large or, as applicable, to any other individual policies the issuer offers.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 76 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     75  \n \nThis individual exemption allows plan sponsors and issuers that do not specifically object \nto contraceptive coverage to offer religiously acceptable coverage to their participants or \nsubscribers who do object, while offering coverage that includes contraception to participants or \nsubscribers who do not object.  This individual exemption can apply with respect to individuals \nin plans sponsored by private employers or governmental employers.  For example, in one case \nbrought against the Departments, the State of Missouri enacted a law under which the State is not \npermitted to discriminate against insurance issuers that offer health plans without coverage for \ncontraception based on employees’ religious beliefs, or against the individual employees who \naccept such offers.  See Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1015–16 (quoting Mo. Rev. Stat. 191.724).  \nUnder the individual exemption of these interim final rules, employers sponsoring governmental \nplans would be free to honor the objections of individual employees by offering them plans that \nomit contraceptive coverage, even if those governmental entities do not object to offering \ncontraceptive coverage in general. \nThis “individual exemption” cannot be used to force a plan (or its sponsor) or an issuer to \nprovide coverage omitting contraception, or, with respect to health insurance coverage, to \nprevent the application of State law that requires coverage of such contraceptives or sterilization. \nNor can the individual exemption be construed to require the guaranteed availability of coverage \nomitting contraception to a plan sponsor or individual who does not have a sincerely held \nreligious objection.  This individual exemption is limited to the requirement to provide \ncontraceptive coverage under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, and does not affect any other \nFederal or State law governing the plan or coverage.  Thus, if there are other applicable laws or \nplan terms governing the benefits, these interim final rules do not affect such other laws or terms. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 77 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     76  \n \nThe Departments believe the individual exemption will help to meet the Affordable Care \nAct’s goal of increasing health coverage because it will reduce the incidence of certain \nindividuals choosing to forego health coverage because the only coverage available would \nviolate their sincerely held religious beliefs.62  At the same time, this individual exemption “does \nnot undermine the governmental interests furthered by the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement,”63 because, when the exemption is applicable, the individual does not want the \ncoverage, and therefore would not use the objectionable items even if they were covered.  \nH.  Optional Accommodation \nDespite expanding the scope of the exemption, these rules also keep the accommodation \nprocess, but revise it so as to make it optional.  In this way, objecting employers are no longer \nrequired to choose between direct compliance or compliance through the accommodation.  These \nrules maintain the location of the accommodation process in the Code of Federal Regulations at \n45 CFR 147.131, 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A.  These rules, by virtue \nof expanding the plan sponsor exemption beyond houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries \nthat were previously exempt, and beyond religious nonprofit groups that were previously \naccommodated, and by defining eligible organizations for the accommodation with reference to \nthose covered by the exemption, likewise expand the kinds of entities that may use the optional \naccommodation.  This includes plan sponsors with sincerely held religious beliefs for the reasons \ndescribed above.  Consequently, under these interim final rules, objecting employers may make \nuse of the exemption, or may choose to pursue the optional accommodation process.  If an \neligible organization pursues the optional accommodation process through the EBSA Form 700 \n                                                           \n62 See, for example, Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1017, and March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 130, where the courts \nnoted that the individual employee plaintiffs indicated that they viewed the Mandate as pressuring them to “forgo \nhealth insurance altogether.” \n63 78 FR 39874. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 78 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     77  \n \nor other specified notice to HHS, it voluntarily shifts an obligation to provide separate but \nseamless contraceptive coverage to its issuer or third party administrator.  \nThe fees adjustment process for qualifying health issuers or third party administrators \npursuant to 45 CFR 156.50 is not modified, and (as specified therein) requires for its \napplicability that an exception under OMB Circular No. A-25R be in effect as the Secretary of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services requests.    \nIf an eligible organization wishes to revoke its use of the accommodation, it can do so \nunder these interim final rules and operate under its exempt status.  As part of its revocation, the \nissuer or third party administrator of the eligible organization must provide participants and \nbeneficiaries written notice of such revocation as specified in guidance issued by the Secretary of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services.  This revocation process applies both \nprospectively to eligible organizations who decide at a later date to avail themselves of the \noptional accommodation and then decide to revoke that accommodation, as well as to \norganizations that were included in the accommodation prior to the effective date of these \ninterim final rules either by their submission of an EBSA Form 700 or notification, or by some \nother means under which their third party administrator or issuer was notified by DOL or HHS \nthat the accommodation applies.  Consistent with other applicable laws, the issuer or third party \nadministrator of an eligible organization must promptly notify plan participants and beneficiaries \nof the change of status to the extent such participants and beneficiaries are currently being \noffered contraceptive coverage at the time the accommodated organization invokes its \nexemption.  If contraceptive coverage is being offered by an issuer or third party administrator \nthrough the accommodation process, the revocation will be effective on the 1st day of the 1st plan \nyear that begins on or after 30 days after the date of the revocation (to allow for the provision of \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 79 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     78  \n \nnotice to plan participants in cases where contraceptive benefits will no longer be provided).  \nAlternatively, an eligible organization may give 60-days notice pursuant to section 2715(d)(4) of \nthe PHS Act,64 if applicable, to revoke its use of the accommodation process. \nThe Departments have eliminated the provision in the previous accommodation under \nwhich an issuer is deemed to have complied with the Mandate where the issuer relied reasonably \nand in good faith on a representation by an eligible organization as to its eligibility for the \naccommodation, even if that representation was later determined to be incorrect.  Because any \norganization with a sincerely held religious objection to contraceptive coverage is now eligible \nfor the optional accommodation under these interim final rules and is also exempt, the \nDepartments believe there is minimal opportunity for mistake or misrepresentation by the \norganization, and the reliance provision is no longer necessary.  \nI.  Definition of Contraceptive Services for the Purpose of these Rules  \nThe interim final rules specify that when the rules refer to “contraceptive” services, \nbenefits, or coverage, such terms include contraceptive or sterilization items, services, or related \npatient education or counseling, to the extent specified for purposes of § 147.130(a)(1)(iv).  This \nwas the case under the previous rules, as expressed in the preamble text of the various iterations \nof the regulations, but the Departments wish to make the scope clear by specifying it in the \nregulatory text. \nJ.  Conclusion \nThe Departments believe that the Guidelines and the exemptions expanded herein will \nadvance the limited purposes for which Congress imposed section 2713 of the PHS Act, while \nacting consistently with Congress’ well-established record of allowing for religious exemptions \n                                                           \n64 See also 26 CFR 54.9815-2715(b); 29 CFR  2590.715-2715(b); 45 CFR 147.200(b). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 80 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     79  \n \nwith respect to especially sensitive health care and health insurance requirements.  These interim \nfinal rules leave fully in place over a dozen Federal programs that provide, or subsidize, \ncontraceptives for women, including for low income women based on financial need.  These \ninterim final rules also maintain HRSA’s discretion to decide whether to continue to require \ncontraceptive coverage under the Guidelines (in plans where Congress applied section 2713 of \nthe PHS Act) if no objection exists.  The Departments believe this array of programs and \nrequirements better serves the interest of providing contraceptive coverage while protecting the \nconscience rights of entities that have sincerely held religious objections to some or all \ncontraceptive or sterilization services.  \nThe Departments request and encourage public comments on all matters addressed in \nthese interim final rules. \nV.  Interim Final Rules, Request for Comments and Waiver of Delay of Effective \nDate \nSection 9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the PHS Act \nauthorize the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS (collectively, the Secretaries) to \npromulgate any interim final rules that they determine are appropriate to carry out the provisions \nof chapter 100 of the Code, part 7 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, and part A of title XXVII of \nthe PHS Act, which include sections 2701 through 2728 of the PHS Act and the incorporation of \nthose sections into section 715 of ERISA and section 9815 of the Code.  These interim final rules \nfall under those statutory authorized justifications, as did previous rules on this matter (75 FR \n41726; 76 FR 46621; 79 FR 51092). \nSection 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires notice and comment \nrulemaking, involving a notice of proposed rulemaking and a comment period prior to \nfinalization of regulatory requirements – except when an agency, for good cause, finds that \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 81 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     80  \n \nnotice and public comment thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \ninterest.  These provisions of the APA do not apply here because of the specific authority granted \nto the Secretaries by section 9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the \nPHS Act.  \nEven if these provisions of the APA applied, they would be satisfied:  The Departments \nhave determined that it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay \nputting these provisions in place until a full public notice-and-comment process is completed.  \nAs discussed earlier, the Departments have issued three interim final rules implementing this \nsection of the PHS Act because of the immediate needs of covered entities and the weighty \nmatters implicated by the HRSA Guidelines.  As recently as December 20, 2016, HRSA updated \nthose Guidelines without engaging in the regulatory process (because doing so is not a legal \nrequirement), and announced that it plans to continue to update the Guidelines.  \nDozens of lawsuits over the Mandate have been pending for nearly 5 years.  The Supreme \nCourt remanded several of those cases more than a year ago, stating that on remand “[w]e \nanticipate that the Courts of Appeals will allow the parties sufficient time to resolve any \noutstanding issues between them”.  Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1560.  During that time, Courts of \nAppeals have been asking the parties in those cases to submit status reports every 30 through 90 \ndays.  Those status reports have informed the courts that the parties were in discussions, and \nabout the RFI issued in late 2016 and its subsequent comment process and the FAQ the \nDepartments issued indicating that we could not find a way at that time to amend the \naccommodation process so as to satisfy objecting eligible organizations while pursuing the \nDepartments’ policy goals.  Since then, several courts have issued orders setting more pressing \ndeadlines.  For example, on March 10, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 82 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     81  \n \nCircuit ordered that, by May 1, 2017, “the court expects to see either a report of an agreement to \nresolve the case or detailed reports on the parties' respective positions.  In the event no agreement \nis reported on or before May 1, 2017, the court will plan to schedule oral argument on the merits \nof the case on short notice after that date”.  The Departments submitted a status report but were \nunable to set forth their specific position because this interim final rule was not yet on public \ndisplay. Instead, the Departments informed the Court that we “are now considering whether \nfurther administrative action would be appropriate”.  In response, the court extended the deadline \nto June 1, 2017, again declaring the court expected “to see either a report of an agreement to \nresolve the case or detailed reports on the parties' respective positions”.  The Departments were \nagain unable to set forth their position in that status report, but were able to state that the \n“Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury are engaged in \nrulemaking to reconsider the regulations at issue here,” citing \nhttps://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eoDetails?rrid=127381.  \nAs discussed above, the Departments have concluded that, in many instances, requiring \ncertain objecting entities or individuals to choose between the Mandate, the accommodation, or \npenalties for noncomplaince has violated RFRA.  Good cause exists to issue the expanded \nexemption in these interim final rules in order to cure such violations (whether among litigants or \namong similarly situated parties that have not litigated), to help settle or resolve cases, and to \nensure, moving forward, that our regulations are consistent with any approach we have taken in \nresolving certain litigation matters.  \nThe Departments have also been subject to temporary injunctions protecting many \nreligious nonprofit organizations from being subject to the accommodation process against their \nwishes, while many other organizations are fully exempt, have permanent court orders blocking \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 83 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     82  \n \nthe contraceptive coverage requirement, or are not subject to section 2713 of the PHS Act and its \nenforcement due to Congress’ limited application of that requirement.  Good cause exists to \nchange the Departments’ previous rules to direct HRSA to bring its Guidelines in accord with the \nlegal realities and remove the threat of a future violation of religious beliefs, including where \nsuch violations are contrary to Federal law. \nOther objecting entities similarly have not had the protection of court injunctions.  This \nincludes some nonprofit entities that have sued the Departments, but it also includes some \norganizations that do not have lawsuits pending against us.  For example, many of the closely \nheld for-profit companies that brought the array of lawsuits challenging the Mandate leading up \nto the decision in Hobby Lobby are not protected by injunctions from the current rules, including \nthe requirement that they either fully comply with the Mandate or subject themselves to the \naccommodation.  Continuing to apply the Mandate’s regulatory burden on individuals and \norganizations with religious beliefs against it could serve as a deterrent for citizens who might \nconsider forming new entities—nonprofit or for-profit—and to offering health insurance in \nemployer-sponsored plans or plans arranged by institutions of higher education.  Delaying the \nprotection afforded by these interim final rules would be contrary to the public interest because it \nwould serve to extend for many months the harm caused to all entities and individuals with \nreligious objections to the Mandate.  Good cause exists to provide immediate resolution to this \nmyriad of situations rather than leaving them to continued uncertainty, inconsistency, and cost \nduring litigation challenging the previous rules.  \nThese interim final rules provide a specific policy resolution that courts have been \nwaiting to receive from the Departments for more than a year.  If the Departments were to \npublish a notice of proposed rulemaking instead of these interim final rules, many more months \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 84 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     83  \n \ncould pass before the current Mandate is lifted from the entities receiving the expanded \nexemption, during which time those entities would be deprived of the relief clearly set forth in \nthese interim final rules.  In response to several of the previous rules on this issue—including \nthree issued as interim final rules under the statutory authority cited above—the Departments \nreceived more than 100,000 public comments on multiple occasions.  Those comments included \nextensive discussion about whether and by what extent to expand the exemption.  Most recently, \non July 26, 2016, the Departments issued a request for information (81 FR 47741) and received \nover 54,000 public comments about different possible ways to resolve these issues.  In \nconnection with past regulations, the Departments have offered or expanded a temporary safe \nharbor allowing organizations that were not exempt from the HRSA Guidelines to operate out of \ncompliance with the Guidelines.  The Departments will fully consider comments submitted in \nresponse to these interim final rules, but believe that good cause exists to issue the rules on an \ninterim final basis before the comments are submitted and reviewed. \nAs the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stated with respect to an \nearlier interim final rule promulgated with respect to this issue in Priests for Life v. U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, 772 F.3d 229, 276 (D.C. Cir. 2014), vacated on other \ngrounds, Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016), “[S]everal reasons support HHS’s decision \nnot to engage in notice and comment here”.  Among other things, the Court noted that “the \nagency made a good cause finding in the rule it issued”; that “the regulations the interim final \nrule modifies were recently enacted pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking, and presented \nvirtually identical issues”; that “HHS will expose its interim rule to notice and comment before \nits permanent implementation”; and that “delay in implementation of the rule would interfere \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 85 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     84  \n \nwith the prompt availability of contraceptive coverage and delay the implementation of the \nalternative opt-out for religious objectors”.  Id. at 277. \nDelaying the availability of the expanded exemption would delay the ability of those \norganizations and individuals to avail themselves of the relief afforded by these interim final \nrules.  Good cause is supported by providing relief for entities and individuals for whom the \nMandate operates in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs, but who would have to \nexperience that burden for many more months under the prior regulations if these rules are not \nissued on an interim final basis.  Good cause is also supported by the effect of these interim final \nrules in bringing to a close the uncertainty caused by years of litigation and regulatory changes \nmade under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act.  Issuing interim final rules with a comment \nperiod provides the public with an opportunity to comment on whether these regulations \nexpanding the exemption should be made permanent or subject to modification without delaying \nthe effective date of the regulations.  \nDelaying the availability of the expanded exemption would also increase the costs of \nhealth insurance.  As reflected in litigation pertaining to the Mandate, some entities are in \ngrandfathered health plans that do not cover contraception.  They wish to make changes to their \nhealth plans that will reduce the costs of insurance coverage for their beneficiaries or \npolicyholders, but which would cause the plans to lose grandfathered status.  They are refraining \nfrom making those changes—and therefore are continuing to incur and pass on higher insurance \ncosts—to prevent the Mandate from applying to their plans in violation of their consciences. \nIssuing these rules on an interim final basis is necessary in order to help reduce the costs of \nhealth insurance for such entities and their plan participants. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 86 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     85  \n \nThese interim final rules also set forth an optional accommodation process, and expand \neligibility for that process to a broader category of entities.  Delaying the availability of the \noptional accommodation process would delay the ability of organizations that do not now qualify \nfor the accommodation, but wish to opt into it, to be able to do so and therefore to provide a \nmechanism for contraceptive coverage  to be provided to their employees while the \norganization’s religious objections are accommodated. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Departments have determined that it would be \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest to engage in full notice and comment \nrulemaking before putting these interim final rules into effect, and that it is in the public interest \nto promulgate interim final rules.  For the same reasons, the Departments have determined, \nconsistent with section 553(d) of the APA (5 U.S.C. 553(d)), that there is good cause to make \nthese interim final rules effective immediately upon filing at the Office of the Federal Register. \nVI.  Economic Impact and Paperwork Burden \nWe have examined the impacts of the interim final rules as required by Executive Order \n12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 on \nImproving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the Regulatory Flexibility Act \n(RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub.

Executive Orders 12866 and 13563—Department of HHS and Department of Labor \nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of \navailable regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches \nthat maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, and public health and \nsafety effects; distributive impacts; and equity).  Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the \nimportance of quantifying both costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and \npromoting flexibility. \nSection 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a “significant regulatory action” as an \naction that is likely to result in a regulation: (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 \nmillion or more in any one year, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, \nproductivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal \ngovernments or communities (also referred to as “economically significant”); (2) creating a \nserious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; \n(3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan programs or \nthe rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising \nout of legal mandates, the President’s priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. \nA regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for major rules with economically \nsignificant effects ($100 million or more in any one year), and an “economically significant” \nregulatory action is subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  As \ndiscussed below regarding anticipated effects of these rules and the Paperwork Reduction Act, \nthese interim final rules are not likely to have economic impacts of $100 million or more in any 1 \nyear, and therefore do not meet the definition of “economically significant” under Executive \nOrder 12866.  However, OMB has determined that the actions are significant within the meaning \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 88 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     87  \n \nof section 3(f)(4) of the Executive Order.  Therefore, OMB has reviewed these final regulations, \nand the Departments have provided the following assessment of their impact. \n1.  Need for Regulatory Action \nThese interim final rules amend the Departments’ July 2015 final regulations to expand \nthe exemption from the requirement to provide coverage for contraceptives and sterilization, \nestablished under the HRSA Guidelines, promulgated under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, \nsection 715(a)(1) of the ERISA, and section 9815(a)(1) of the Code, and to revise the \naccommodation process to make it optional for eligible organizations.  The expanded exemption \nwould apply to individuals and entities that have religious objections to some (or all) of the \ncontraceptive and/or sterilization services that would be covered under the Guidelines.  Such \naction is taken, among other reasons, to provide for participation in the health insurance market \nby certain entities or individuals free from penalties for violating sincerely held religious beliefs \nopposed to providing or receiving coverage of contraceptive services, and to resolve many of the \nlawsuits that have been filed against the Departments. \n2.  Anticipated Effects \nThe Departments assess this interim final rule together with a companion interim final \nrule concerning moral but non-religious conscientious objections to contraception, published \nelsewhere in this Federal Register.  Regarding entities that are extended an exemption, absent \nexpansion of the exemption the Guidelines would require many of these entities and individuals \nto either: pay for coverage of contraceptive services that they find religiously objectionable; \nsubmit self-certifications that would result in their issuer or third party administrator paying for \nsuch services for their employees, which some entities also believe entangles them in the \nprovision of such objectionable coverage; or, pay tax penalties or be subject to other adverse \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 89 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     88  \n \nconsequences for non-compliance with these requirements.  These interim final rules remove \ncertain associated burdens imposed on these entities and individuals—that is, by recognizing \ntheir religious objections and exempting them—on the basis of such objections—from the \ncontraceptive and/or sterilization coverage requirement of the HRSA Guidelines and making the \naccommodation process optional for eligible organizations.  \nTo the extent that entities choose to revoke their accommodated status to make use of the \nexpanded exemption immediately, a notice will need to be sent to enrollees (either by the entity \nor by the issuer or third party administrator) that their contraceptive coverage is changing, and \nguidance will reflect that such a notice requirement is imposed no more than is already required \nby preexisting rules that require notices to be sent to enrollees of changes to coverage during a \nplan year.  If the entities wait until the start of their next plan year to change to exempt status, \ninstead of doing so during a plan year, those entities generally will also be able to avoid sending \nany supplementary notices in addition to what they would otherwise normally send prior to the \nstart of a new plan year.  Additionally, these interim final rules provide such entities with an \noffsetting regulatory benefit by the exemption itself and its relief of burdens on their religious \nbeliefs.  As discussed below, assuming that more than half of entities that have been using the \nprevious accommodation will seek immediate revocation of their accommodated status and \nnotices will be sent to all their enrollees, the total estimated cost of sending those notices will be \n$51,990. \nThe Departments estimate that these interim final rules will not result in any additional \nburdens or costs on issuers or third party administrators.  As discussed below, the Departments \nbelieve that 109 of the 209 entities making use of the accommodation process will instead make \nuse of their newly exempt status.  In contrast, the Departments expect that a much smaller \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 90 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     89  \n \nnumber (which we assume to be 9) will make use of the accommodation that were not provided \naccess to it previously.  Reduced burdens for issuers and third party administrators due to \nreductions in use of the accommodation will more than offset increased obligations on issuers \nand third party administrators serving the fewer number of entities that will newly opt into the \naccommodation.  This will lead to a net decrease in burdens and costs on issuers and third party \nadministrators, who will no longer have continuing obligations imposed on them by the \naccommodation. \nThese interim final rules will result in some persons covered in plans of newly exempt \nentities not receiving coverage or payments for contraceptive services.  The Departments do not \nhave sufficient data to determine the actual effect of these rules on plan participants and \nbeneficiaries, including for costs they may incur for contraceptive coverage, nor of unintended \npregnancies that may occur.  As discussed above and for reasons explained here, there are \nmultiple levels of uncertainty involved in measuring the effect of the expanded exemption, \nincluding but not limited to-- \n how many entities will make use of their newly exempt status. \n how many entities will opt into the accommodation maintained by these rules, under  \nwhich their plan participants will continue receiving contraceptive coverage. \n which contraceptive methods some newly exempt entities will continue to provide  \nwithout cost-sharing despite the entity objecting to other methods (for example, as reflected in \nHobby Lobby, several objecting entities still provide coverage for 14 of the 18 women’s \ncontraceptive or sterilization methods, 134 S. Ct. at 2766). \n how many women will be covered by plans of entities using their newly exempt  \nstatus. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 91 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     90  \n \n which of the women covered by those plans want and would have used contraceptive  \ncoverage or payments for contraceptive methods that are no longer covered by such  \nplans. \n whether, given the broad availability of contraceptives and their relatively low cost,  \nsuch women will obtain and use contraception even if it is not covered. \n the degree to which such women are in the category of women identified by IOM as  \nmost at risk of unintended pregnancy. \n the degree to which unintended pregnancies may result among those women, which  \nwould be attributable as an effect of these rules only if the women did not otherwise use \ncontraception or a particular contraceptive method due to their plan making use of its newly \nexempt status. \n the degree to which such unintended pregnancies may be associated with negative  \nhealth effects, or whether such effects may be offset by other factors, such as the fact that those \nwomen will be otherwise enrolled in insurance coverage. \n the extent to which such women will qualify for alternative sources of contraceptive  \naccess, such as through a parent’s or spouse’s plan, or through one of the many governmental \nprograms that subsidize contraceptive coverage to supplement their access.  \nThe Departments have access to sources of information discussed in the following \nparagraphs that are relevant to this issue, but those sources do not provide a full picture of the \nimpact of these interim final rules.  \nFirst, the prior rules already exempted certain houses of worship and their integrated \nauxiliaries.  Further, as discussed above, the prior accommodation process allows hundreds of \nadditional religious nonprofit organizations in self-insured church plans that are exempt from \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 92 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     91  \n \nERISA to file a self-certification or notice that relieves not only themselves but, in effect, their \nthird party administrators of any obligation to provide contraceptive coverage or payments.  \nAlthough in the latter case, third party administrators are legally permitted to provide the \ncoverage, several self-insured church plans themselves have expressed an objection in litigation \nto allowing such contraceptive coverage to be provided, and according to information received \nduring litigation, it appears that such contraceptive coverage has not been provided.  In addition, \na significant portion of the lawsuits challenging the Mandate were brought by a single firm \nrepresenting Catholic dioceses and related entities covered by their diocese-sponsored plans.  In \nthat litigation, the Departments took the position that, where those diocese-sponsored plans are \nself-insured, those plans are likely church plans exempt from ERISA.65  For the purposes of \nconsidering whether the expanded exemption in these rules affects the persons covered by such \ndiocese-sponsored plans, the Departments continue to assume that such plans are similar to other \nobjecting entities using self-insured church plans with respect to their third party administrators \nbeing unlikely to provide contraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries under the \nprevious rule.  Therefore the Departments estimate that these interim final rules have no \nsignificant effect on the contraceptive coverage of women covered by plans of houses of worship \nand their integrated auxiliaries, entities using a self-insured church plan, or church dioceses \nsponsoring self-insured plans.  \nIt is possible that an even greater number of litigating or accommodated plans might have \nmade use of self-insured church plan status under the previous accommodation.  Notably, one of \n                                                           \n65 See, for example, Brief in Opp. To Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Brandt v. Burwell, No. 2:14-cv-681-AJS, doc. # 23 \n(W.D. Pa. filed June 10, 2014) (arguing that “plaintiffs have not established an injury in fact to the degree plaintiffs \nhave a self-insured church plan,” based on the fact that “the same law firm representing the plaintiffs here has \nsuggested in another similar case that all ‘Catholic entities like the Archdiocese participate in “church plans.”’); \nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (“because plaintiffs’ \nself-insured plans are church plans, their third party administrators would not be required to provide contraceptive \ncoverage”). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 93 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     92  \n \nthe largest nonprofit employers that had filed suit challenging the Mandate had, under these prior \nrules, shifted most of their employees into self-insured church plans, and the Departments have \ntaken the position that various other employers that filed suit were eligible to assume self-insured \nchurch plan status.66  The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Advocate Health Care Network, \nwhile not involving this Mandate, also clarifies certain circumstances under which religious \nhospitals may be eligible for self-insured church plan status.  See 137 S. Ct. at 1656–57, 1663 \n(holding that a church plan under ERISA can be a plan not established and maintained by a \nchurch, if it is maintained by a principal-purpose organization). \nSecond, when the Departments previously created the exemption, expanded its \napplication, and provided an accommodation (which, as mentioned, can lift obligations on self-\ninsured church plans for hundreds of nonprofit organizations), we concluded that no significant \nburden or costs would result at all. (76 FR 46625; 78 FR 39889.)  We reached this conclusion \ndespite the impact, just described, whereby the previous rule apparently lead to women not \nreceiving contraceptive coverage through hundreds of nonprofit entities using self-insured \nchurch plans.  We also reached this conclusion without counting any significant burden or cost to \nsome women covered in the plans of houses of worship or integrated auxiliaries that might want \ncontraceptive coverage.  This conclusion was based in part on the assertion, set forth in previous \nregulations, that employees of houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries likely share their \nemployers’ opposition to contraception.  Many other religious nonprofit entities, however, both \nadopt and implement religious principles with similar fervency.  For the reasons discussed \nabove, the Departments no longer believe we can distinguish many of the women covered in the \nplans of religious nonprofit entities from the women covered in the plans of houses of worship \n                                                           \n66 See https://www.franciscanhealth.org/sites/default/files/2015%20employee%20benefit%20booklet.pdf.; see, for \nexample, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 94 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     93  \n \nand integrated auxiliaries regarding which the Departments assumed share their employers’ \nobjection to contraception, nor from women covered in the plans of religious entities using self-\ninsured church plans regarding which we chose not to calculate any anticipated effect even \nthough we conceded we were not requiring their third party administrators to provide \ncontraceptive coverage.  In the estimates and assumptions below, we include the potential effect \nof these interim rules on women covered by such entities, in order to capture all of the \nanticipated effects of these rules. \nThird, these interim final rules extend the exemption to for-profit entities.  Among the \nfor-profit employers that filed suit challenging the Mandate, the one with the most employees \nwas Hobby Lobby.67  As noted above, and like some similar entities, the plaintiffs in Hobby \nLobby were willing to provide coverage with no cost sharing of various contraceptive services: \n14 of 18 FDA-approved women’s contraceptive and sterilization methods.68  (134 S. Ct. at \n2766.)  The effect of expanding the exemption to for-profit entities is therefore mitigated to the \nextent many of the persons covered by such entities’ plans may receive coverage for at least \nsome contraceptive services. No publicly traded for-profit entities have filed lawsuits challenging \nthe Mandate. The Departments agree with the Supreme Court’s expectation in this regard: “it \n                                                           \n67 Verified Complaint ¶ 34, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., et al. v. Sebelius, No. 5:12-cv-01000-HE (Sept. 12, 2012 \nW.D. Okla.) (13,240 employees).  \n68 By reference to the FDA Birth Control Guide’s list of 18 birth control methods for women and 2 for men, \nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepublications/ucm517406.pdf, Hobby \nLobby and entities with similar beliefs were not willing to cover: IUD copper; IUD with progestin; emergency \ncontraceptive (Levonorgestrel); and emergency contraceptive (Ulipristal Acetate).  See 134 S. Ct. at 2765–66. \nHobby Lobby was willing to cover: sterilization surgery for women; sterilization implant for women; implantable \nrod; shot/injection; oral contraceptives (“the Pill”—combined pill); oral contraceptives (“the Pill”—\nextended/continuous use/combined pill); oral contraceptives (“the Mini Pill”—progestin only); patch; vaginal \ncontraceptive ring; diaphragm with spermicide; sponge with spermicide; cervical cap with spermicide; female \ncondom; spermicide alone. Id.  Among women using these 18 female contraceptive methods, 85 percent use the 14 \nmethods that Hobby Lobby and entities with similar beliefs were willing to cover (22,446,000 out of 26,436,000), \nand “[t]he pill and female sterilization have been the two most commonly used methods since 1982.” See \nGuttmacher Institute, “Contraceptive Use in the United States” (Sept. 2016), available at \nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 95 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     94  \n \nseems unlikely that the sort of corporate giants to which HHS refers will often assert RFRA \nclaims.  HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly traded corporation asserting RFRA \nrights, and numerous practical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring.  For example, \nthe idea that unrelated shareholders—including institutional investors with their own set of \nstakeholders—would agree to run a corporation under the same religious beliefs seems \nimprobable”.  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2774.  Therefore, although publicly traded entities \ncould make use of exempt status under these interim final rules, the Departments do not expect \nthat very many will do so, as compared to the 87 religious closely held for-profit entities that \nbrought litigation challenging the Mandate (some of which might be content with the \naccommodation). \nFourth, the Departments have a limited amount of information about entities that have \nmade use of the accommodation process as set forth in the previous rules.  HHS previously \nestimated that 209 entities would make use of the accommodation process.  That estimate was \nbased on HHS’s observation in its August 2014 interim final rules and July 2015 final \nregulations that there were 122 eligible entities that had filed litigation challenging the \naccommodation process, and 87 closely held for-profit entities that had filed suit challenging the \nMandate in general.  (79 FR 51096; 80 FR 41336).  The Departments acknowledged that entities \nthat had not litigated might make use of the accommodation, but we stated we did not have better \ndata to estimate how many might use the accommodation overall.  \nAfter issuing those rules, the Departments have not received complete data on the number \nof entities actually using the accommodation, because the accommodation does not require many \naccommodated entities to submit information to us. Our limited records indicate that \napproximately 63 entities have affirmatively submitted notices to HHS to use the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 96 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     95  \n \naccommodation.  This includes some fully insured and some self-insured plans, but it does not \ninclude entities that may have used the accommodation by submitting an EBSA form 700 self-\ncertification directly to their issuer or third party administrator.  We have deemed some other \nentities as being subject to the accommodation through their litigation filings, but that might not \nhave led to contraceptive coverage being provided to persons covered in some of those plans, \neither because they are exempt as houses of worship or integrated auxiliaries, they are in self-\ninsured church plans, or we were not aware of their issuers or third party administrators so as to \nsend them letters obligating them to provide such coverage.  Our records also indicate that 60 \nplans used the contraceptive user fees adjustments in the 2015 plan year, the last year for which \nwe have data.  This includes only self-insured plans, and it includes some plans that self-certified \nthrough submitting notices and other plans that, presumably, self-certified through the EBSA \nform 700.  \nThese sets of data are not inconsistent with our previous estimate that 209 entities would \nuse the accommodation, but they indicate that some non-litigating entities used the \naccommodation, and some litigating entities did not, possibly amounting to a similar number. \nFor this reason, and because we do not have more complete data available, we believe the \nprevious estimate of 209 accommodated entities is still the best estimate available for how many \nentities have used the accommodation under the previous rule.  This assumes that the number of \nlitigating entities that did not use the accommodation is approximately the same as the number of \nnon-litigating entities that did use it.  \nIn considering how many entities will use the voluntary accommodation moving \nforward—and how many will use the expanded exemption—we also do not have specific data.  \nWe expect the 122 nonprofit entities that specifically challenged the accommodation in court to \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 97 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     96  \n \nuse the expanded exemption. But, as noted above, we believe a significant number of them are \nnot presently participating in the accommodation, and that some nonprofit entities in self-insured \nchurch plans are not providing contraceptive coverage through their third party administrators \neven if they are using the accommodation.  Among the 87 for-profit entities that filed suit \nchallenging the Mandate in general, few if any filed suit challenging the accommodation.  We do \nnot know how many of those entities are using the accommodation, how many may be \ncomplying with the Mandate fully, how many may be relying on court injunctions to do neither, \nor how many will use the expanded exemption moving forward.  Among entities that never \nlitigated but used the accommodation, we expect many but not all of them to continue using the \naccommodation, and we do not have data to estimate how many such entities there are or how \nmany will choose either option.  \nOverall, therefore, without sufficient data to estimate what the estimated 209 previously \naccommodated entities will do under these interim final rules, we assume that just over half of \nthem will use the expanded exemption, and just under half will continue their accommodated \nstatus under the voluntary process set forth in these rules.  Specifically, we assume that 109 \npreviously accommodated entities will make use of their exempt status, and 100 will continue \nusing the accommodation.  This estimate is based in part on our view that most litigating \nnonprofit entities would prefer the exemption to the accommodation, but that many of either \nhave not been using the accommodation or, if they have been using it, it is not providing \ncontraceptive coverage for women in their plans where they participate in self-insured church \nplans.  This estimate is also consistent with our lack of knowledge of how many for-profit \nentities were using the accommodation and will choose the exemption or the accommodation, \ngiven that many of them did not bring legal challenges against the accommodation after Hobby \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 98 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     97  \n \nLobby.  This estimate is further consistent with our view, explained in more detail below, that \nsome entities that are using the accommodation and did not bring litigation will use the \nexemption, but many accommodated, non-litigating entities—including the ones with the largest \nrelative workforces among accommodated entities—will continue using the accommodation.  \nThe Departments recognize that we do not have better data to estimate the effects of these \ninterim final rules on such entities. \nIn addition to these factors, we recognize that the expanded exemption and \naccommodation are newly available to religious for-profit entities that are not closely held and \nsome other plan sponsors.  As explained above, the Departments believe religious for-profit \nentities that are not closely held may exist, or may wish to come into being. HHS does not \nanticipate that there will be significant number of such entities, and among those, we believe that \nvery few if any will use the accommodation.  All of the for-profit entities that have challenged \nthe Mandate have been religious closely held entities.  \nIt is also possible that religious nonprofit or closely held for-profit entities that were \nalready eligible for the accommodation but did not previously use it will opt into it moving \nforward, but because they could have done so under the previous rules, their opting into the \naccommodation is not caused by these rules.  \nWithout any data to estimate how many of any entities newly eligible for and interested \nin using the accommodation might exist, HHS assumes for the purposes of estimating the \nanticipated effect of these rules that less than 10 entities (9) will do so.  Therefore, we estimate \nthat 109 entities will use the voluntary accommodation moving forward, 100 of which were \nalready using the previous accommodation, and that 109 entities that have been using the \nprevious accommodation will use the expanded exemption instead. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 99 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     98  \n \nFifth, in attempting to estimate the anticipated effect of these interim final rules on \nwomen receiving contraceptive coverage, the Departments have limited information about the \nentities that have filed suit challenging the Mandate.  Approximately 209 entities have brought \nsuit challenging the Mandate over more than 5 years.  They have included a broad range of \nnonprofit entities and closely held for-profit entities.  We discuss a number of potentially \nrelevant points: \nFirst, the Departments do not believe that out-of-pocket litigation costs have been a \nsignificant barrier to entities choosing to file suit.  Based on the Departments’ knowledge of \nthese cases through public sources and litigation, nearly all the entities were represented pro \nbono and were subject to little or no discovery during the cases, and multiple public interest law \nfirms publicly provided legal services for entities willing to challenge the Mandate.69  (It is \nnoteworthy, however, that such pro bono arrangements and minimization of discovery do not \neliminate 100 percent of the time costs of participating in litigation or, as discussed in more \ndetail below, the potential for negative publicity.  Both concerns could have dissuaded \nparticipation in lawsuits, and the potential for negative publicity may also dissuade participation \nin the expanded exemptions.)  \nSecond, prior to the Affordable Care Act, the vast majority of entities already covered \ncontraception, albeit not always without cost-sharing  The Departments do not have data to \n                                                           \n69 See, for example, Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, “Award-winning attorney ‘humbled’ by recognition,” Pittsburgh \nCatholic (“Jones Day is doing the cases ‘pro bono,’ or voluntarily and without payment.”) (quoting Paul M. Pohl, \nPartner, Jones Day), available at http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/award-winning-attorney-humbled-recognition; \n“Little Sisters Fight for Religious Freedom,” National Review (Oct. 2, 2013) (“the Becket Fund for Religious \nLiberty is representing us pro bono, as they do all their clients.”) (quoting Sister Constance Veit, L.S.P., \ncommunications director for the Little Sisters of the Poor), available at \nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/article/360103/little-sisters-fight-religious-freedom-interview; Suzanne Cassidy, \n“Meet the major legal players in the Conestoga Wood Specialties Supreme Court case,” LancasterOnline (Mar. 25, \n2014) (“Cortman and the other lawyers arguing on behalf of Conestoga Wood Specialties and Hobby Lobby are \noffering their services pro bono.”), available at http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/meet-the-major-legal-players-\nin-the-conestoga-wood-specialties/article_302bc8e2-b379-11e3-b669-001a4bcf6878.html. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 100 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     99  \n \nindicate why entities that did not cover contraception prior to the Affordable Care Act chose not \nto cover it. As noted above, however, the Departments have maintained that compliance with the \ncontraceptive Mandate is cost-neutral to issuers, which indicates that no significant financial \nincentive exists to omit contraceptive coverage.  As indicated by the report by HHS ASPE \ndiscussed above, we have assumed that millions of women received preventive services after the \nMandate went into effect because nearly all entities complied with the Guidelines.  We are not \naware of expressions from most of those entities indicating that they would have sincerely held \nreligious objections to complying with the Mandate, and therefore that they would make use of \nthe expanded exemption provided here.  \nThird, omitting contraceptive coverage has subjected some entities to serious public \ncriticism and in some cases organized boycotts or opposition campaigns that have been reported \nin various media and online outlets regarding entities that have filed suit.  The Departments \nexpect that even if some entities might not receive such criticism, many entities will be reluctant \nto use the expanded exemption unless they are committed to their views to a significant degree.  \nOverall, the Departments do not know how many entities will use the expanded \nexemption.  We expect that some non-litigating entities will use it, but given the aforementioned \nconsiderations, we believe it might not be very many more.  Moreover, many litigating entities \nare already exempt or are not providing contraceptive coverage to women in their plans due to \ntheir participating in self-insured church plans, so the effect of the expanded exemption among \nlitigating entities is significantly lower than it would be if all the women in their plans were \nalready receiving the coverage.  \nTo calculate the anticipated effects of this rule on contraceptive coverage among women \ncovered by plans provided by litigating entities, we start by examining court documents and \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 101 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     100  \n \nother public sources.70  These sources provide some information, albeit incomplete, about how \nmany people are employed by these entities.  As noted above, however, contraceptive coverage \namong the employees of many litigating entities will not be affected by these rules because some \nlitigating entities were exempt under the prior rule, while others were or appeared to be in self-\ninsured church plans so that women covered in their plans were already not receiving \ncontraceptive coverage.  \nAmong litigating entities that were neither exempt nor likely using self-insured church \nplans, our best estimate based on court documents and public sources is that such entities \nemployed approximately 65,000 persons, male and female.71  The average number of workers at \nfirms offering health benefits that are actually covered by those benefits is 62 percent.72  This \namounts to approximately 34,000 employees covered under those plans. DOL estimates that for \neach employee policyholder, there is approximately one dependent.73  This amounts to \napproximately 68,000 covered persons.  Census data indicate that women of childbearing age—\n                                                           \n70 Where complaints, affidavits, or other documents filed in court did not indicate the number of employees that \nwork for an entity, and that entity was not apparently exempt as a house of worship or integrated auxiliary, and it \nwas not using the kind of plan that we have stated in litigation qualifies for self-insured church plan status (see, for \nexample, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 2013)), we \nexamined employment data contained in some IRS form W-3’s that are publicly available online for certain \nnonprofit groups, and looked at other websites discussing the number of people employed at certain entities.  \n71  In a small number of lawsuits, named plaintiffs include organizations claiming to have members that seek an \nexemption.  We have very little information about the number, size, and types of entities those members.  Based on \nlimited information from those cases, however, their membership appears to consist mainly, although not entirely, of \nhouses of worship, integrated auxiliaries, and participants in self-insured plans of churches.  As explained above, the \ncontraceptive coverage of women covered by such plans is not likely to be affected by the expanded exemption in \nthese rules.  However, to account for plans subject to contraceptive coverage obligations among those members we \nhave added 10,000 to our estimate of the number of persons among litigants that may be impacted by these rules. \n72 See Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits: 2017 \nAnnual Survey” at 57, available at http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-\n2017. \n73 “Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin” Table 4, page 21.

On average, we expect that approximately half of those students (1,650) are \nfemale.  For the purposes of this estimate, we also assume that female policyholders covered by \nplans arranged by institutions of higher education are women of childbearing age.  We expect \nthat they would have less than the average number of dependents per policyholder than exists in \nstandard plans, but for the purposes of providing an upper bound to this estimate, we assume that \nthey would have an average of one dependent per policyholder, thus bringing the number of \npolicyholders and dependents back up to 3,300.  Many of those dependents are likely not to be \nwomen of childbearing age, but in order to provide an upper bound to this estimate, we assume \nthey are.  Therefore, for the purposes of this estimate, we assume that the effect of these \nexpanded exemptions on student plans of litigating entities includes 3,300 women.  Assuming \n                                                           \n74 United States Census Bureau, “Age and Sex Composition: 2010” (May 2011), available at \nhttps://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf. The Guidelines’ requirement of contraceptive \ncoverage only applies “for all women with reproductive capacity.” https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/; also, \nsee 80 FR 40318.  In addition, studies commonly consider the 15–44 age range to assess contraceptive use by \nwomen of childbearing age.  See, for example, Guttmacher Institute, “Contraceptive Use in the United States” (Sept. \n2016), available at https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. \n75 See https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states (reporting that of 60,877,000 women \naged 15-44, 26,945,000 use women’s contraceptive methods covered by the Guidelines). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 103 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     102  \n \nthat 44.3 perecent of such women use contraception covered by the Guidelines,76 we estimate \nthat 1,462 of those women would be affected by these rules. \nTogether, this leads the Departments to estimate that approximately 8,700 women of \nchildbearing age may have their contraception costs affected by plans of litigating entities using \nthese expanded exemptions.  As noted above, the Departments do not have data indicating how \nmany of those women agree with their employers’ or educational institutions’ opposition to \ncontraception (so that fewer of them than the national average might actually use contraception).  \nNor do we know how many would have alternative contraceptive access from a parent’s or \nspouse’s plan, or from Federal, State, or local governmental programs, nor how many of those \nwomen would fall in the category of being most at risk of unintended pregnancy, nor how many \nof those entities would provide some contraception in their plans while only objecting to certain \ncontraceptives. \nSixth, in a brief filed in the Zubik litigation, the Departments stated that “in 2014, [HHS] \nprovided user-fee reductions to compensate TPAs for making contraceptive coverage available \nto more than 600,000 employees and beneficiaries,” and that “[t]hat figure includes both men \nand women covered under the relevant plans.”77  HHS has reviewed the information giving rise \nto that estimate, and has received updated information for 2015.  In 2014, 612,000 persons were \ncovered by plans claiming contraceptive user fees adjustments, and in 2015, 576,000 persons \nwere covered by such plans.  These numbers include all persons in such plans, not just women of \nchildbearing age.  \n                                                           \n76 It would appear that a smaller percentage of college-aged women use contraception—and use more expensive \nmethods such as long acting methods or sterilization—than among other women of childbearing age. See NCHS \nData Brief, “Current Contraceptive Status Among Women Aged 15-44: United States, 2011-2013” (Dec. 2014), \navailable at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db173.pdf. \n77 Brief of Respondents at 18–19 & n.7, Zubik v. Burwell, No. 14-1418, et al. (U.S. filed Feb. 10, 2016).  The actual \nnumber is 612,487. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 104 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     103  \n \nHHS’s information indicates that religious nonprofit hospitals or health systems \nsponsored a significant minority of the accommodated self-insured plans that were using \ncontraceptive user fees adjustments, yet those plans covered more than 80 percent of the persons \ncovered in all plans using contraceptive user fees adjustments.  Some of those plans cover nearly \n100,000 persons each, and several others cover approximately 40,000 persons each.  In other \nwords, these plans were proportionately much larger than the plans provided by other entities \nusing the contraceptive user fees adjustments.  \nThere are two reasons to believe that a significant fraction of the persons covered by \npreviously accommodated plans provided by religious nonprofit hospitals or health systems may \nnot be affected by the expanded exemption.  A broad range of religious hospitals or health \nsystems have publicly indicated that they do not conscientiously oppose participating in the \naccommodation.78  Of course, some of these religious hospitals or health systems may opt for the \nexpanded exemption under these interim final rules, but others might not. In addition, among \nplans of religious nonprofit hospitals or health systems, some have indicated that they might be \neligible for status as a self-insured church plan.79  As discussed above, some litigants challenging \nthe Mandate have appeared, after their complaints were filed, to make use of self-insured church \nplan status.80  (The Departments take no view on the status of these particular plans under \n                                                           \n78  See, for example, https://www.chausa.org/newsroom/women%27s-preventive-health-services-final-rule (“HHS \nhas now established an accommodation that will allow our ministries to continue offering health insurance plans for \ntheir employees as they have always done….  We are pleased that our members now have an accommodation that \nwill not require them to contract, provide, pay or refer for contraceptive coverage….  We will work with our \nmembers to implement this accommodation.”) In comments submitted in previous rules concerning this Mandate, \nthe Catholic Health Association has stated it “is the national leadership organization for the Catholic health ministry, \nconsisting of more than 2,000 Catholic health care sponsors, systems, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and related \norganizations.  Our ministry is represented in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.”  Comments on CMS-9968-\nANPRM (dated June 15, 2012).  \n79  See, for example, Brief of the Catholic Health Association of the United States as Amicus Curiae in Support of \nPetitioners, Advocate Health Care Network, Nos. 16-74, 16-86, 16-258, 2017 WL 371934 at *1 (U.S. filed Jan. 24, \n2017) (“CHA members have relied for decades that the ‘church plan’ exemption contained in” ERISA.). \n80  See supra note 66. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 105 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     104  \n \nERISA, but simply make this observation for the purpose of seeking to estimate the impact of \nthese interim final rules.)  Nevertheless, overall it seems likely that many of the remaining \nreligious hospital or health systems plans previously using the accommodation will continue to \nopt into the voluntary accommodation under these interim final rules, under which their \nemployees will still receive contraceptive coverage.  To the extent that plans of religious \nhospitals or health systems are able to make use of self-insured church plan status, the previous \naccommodation rule would already have allowed them to relieve themselves and their third party \nadministrators of obligations to provide contraceptive coverage or payments.  Therefore, in such \nsituations these interim final rules would not have an anticipated effect on the contraceptive \ncoverage of women in those plans.  \nConsidering all these data points and limitations, the Departments offer the following \nestimate of the number of women who will be impacted by the expanded exemption in these \ninterim final rules.  The Departments begin with the 8,700 women of childbearing age that use \ncontraception who we estimate will be affected by use of the expanded exemption among \nlitigating entities.  In addition to that number, we calculate the following number of women \naffected by accommodated entities using the expanded exemption.  As noted above, \napproximately 576,000 plan participants and beneficiaries were covered by self-insured plans \nthat received contraceptive user fee adjustments in 2014.  Although additional self-insured \nentities may have participated in the accommodation without making use of contraceptive user \nfees adjustments, we do not know what number of entities did so.  We consider it likely that self-\ninsured entities with relatively larger numbers of covered persons had sufficient financial \nincentive to make use of the contraceptive user fees adjustments.  Therefore, without better data \navailable, we assume that the number of persons covered by self-insured plans using \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 106 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     105  \n \ncontraceptive user fees adjustments approximates the number of persons covered by all self-\ninsured plans using the accommodation. \nAn additional but unknown number of persons were likely covered in fully insured plans \nusing the accommodation.  The Departments do not have data on how many fully insured plans \nhave been using the accommodation, nor on how many persons were covered by those plans. \nDOL estimates that, among persons covered by employer sponsored insurance, 56.1 percent are \ncovered by self-insured plans and 43.9 percent are covered by fully insured plans.81  Therefore, \ncorresponding to the 576,000 persons covered by self-insured plans using user fee adjustments, \nwe estimate an additional 451,000 persons were covered by fully insured plans using the \naccommodation.  This yields an estimate of 1,027,000 covered persons of all ages and sexes in \nplans using the previous accommodation.  \nAs discussed below, and recognizing the limited data available for our estimates, the \nDepartments estimate that 100 of the 209 entities that were using the accommodation under the \nprior rule will continue to opt into it under these interim final rules.  Notably, however, the data \nconcerning accommodated self-insured plans indicates that plans sponsored by religious \nhospitals and health systems encompass more than 80 percent of the persons covered in such \nplans.  In other words, plans sponsored by such entities have a proportionately larger number of \ncovered persons than do plans sponsored by other accommodated entities, which have smaller \nnumbers of covered persons.  As also cited above, many religious hospitals and health systems \nhave indicated that they do not object to the accommodation, and some of those entities might \nalso qualify as self-insured church plans, so that these interim final rules would not impact the \n                                                           \n81 “Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin” Table 3A, page 15.  Using March 2015 Annual Social and Economic \nSupplement to the Current Population Survey. https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/researchers/data/health-\nand-welfare/health-insurance-coverage-bulletin-2015.pdf.    \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 107 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     106  \n \ncontraceptive coverage their employees receive.  We do not have specific data on which plans of \nwhich sizes will actually continue to opt into the accommodation, nor how many will make use \nof self-insured church plan status.  We assume that the proportions of covered persons in self-\ninsured plans using contraceptive user fees adjustments also apply in fully insured plans, for \nwhich we lack representative data.  Based on these assumptions and without better data \navailable, we assume that the 100 accommodated entities that will remain in the accommodation \nwill account for 75 percent of all the persons previously covered in accommodated plans.  In \ncomparison, we assume the 109 accommodated entities that will make use of the expanded \nexemption will encompass 25 percent of persons previously covered in accommodated plans.  \nApplying these percentages to the total number of 1,027,000 persons we estimate are \ncovered in accommodated plans, we estimate that approximately 257,000 persons previously \ncovered in accommodated plans will be covered in the 109 plans that use the expanded \nexemption, and 770,000 persons will be covered in the estimated 100 plans that continue to use \nthe accommodation.  According to the Census data cited above, 20.2 percent of these persons are \nwomen of childbearing age, which amounts to approximately 51,900 women of childbearing age \nin previously accommodated plans that we estimate will use the expanded exemption.  As noted \nabove, approximately 44.3 percent of women of childbearing age use women’s contraceptive \nmethods covered by the Guidelines, so that we expect approximately 23,000 women that use \ncontraception covered by the Guidelines to be affected by accommodated entities using the \nexpanded exemption. \nIt is not clear the extent to which this number overlaps with the number estimated above \nof 8,700 women in plans of litigating entities that may be affected by these rules.  Based on our \nlimited information from the litigation and accommodation notices, we expect that the overlap is \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 108 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     107  \n \nsignificant.  Nevertheless, in order to estimate the possible effects of these rules, we assume there \nis no overlap between these two numbers, and therefore that these interim final rules would \naffect the contraceptive costs of approximately 31,700 women.   \nUnder the assumptions just discussed, the number of women whose contraceptive costs \nwill be impacted by the expanded exemption in these interim final rules is less than 0.1 percent \nof the 55.6 million women in private plans that HHS ASPE estimated82 receive preventive \nservices coverage under the Guidelines.  \nIn order to estimate the cost of contraception to women affected by the expanded \nexemption, the Departments are aware that, under the prior accommodation process, the total \nuser fee adjustment amount for self-insured plans for the 2015 benefit year was $33 million. \nThese adjustments covered the cost of contraceptive coverage provided to women participants \nand beneficiaries in self-insured plans where the employer objected and made use of the \naccommodation, and where an authorizing exception under OMB Circular No. A-25R was in \neffect as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services requests.  Nine percent \nof that amount was attributable to administrative costs and margin, according to the provisions of \n45 CFR 156.50(d)(3)(ii).  Thus the amount of the adjustments attributable to the cost of \ncontraceptive services was about $30 million.  As discussed above, in 2015 that amount \ncorresponded to 576,000 persons covered by such plans.  Among those persons, as cited above, \napproximately 20.2 percent on average were women of childbearing age—that is, approximately \n116,000 women. As noted above, approximately 44.3 percent of women of childbearing age use \nwomen’s contraceptive methods covered by the Guidelines, which includes 51,400 women in \n                                                           \n82 Available at https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/affordable-care-act-improving-access-preventive-services-millions-\namericans; also, see Abridged Report, available at https://www.womenspreventivehealth.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/01/WPSI_2016AbridgedReport.pdf. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 109 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     108  \n \nthose plans.  Therefore, entities using contraceptive user fees adjustments received \napproximately $584 per year per woman of childbearing age that use contraception covered by \nthe Guidelines and are covered in their plans.  \nAs discussed above, the Departments estimate that the expanded exemptions will impact \nthe contraceptive costs of approximately 31,700 women of childbearing age that use \ncontraception covered by the Guidelines.  At an average of $584 per year, the financial transfer \neffects attributable to the interim final rules on those women would be approximately $18.5 \nmillion.83,84  \nTo account for uncertainty in the estimate, we conducted a second analysis using an \nalternative framework, in order to thoroughly consider the possible upper bound economic \nimpact of these interim final rules. \nAs noted above, the HHS ASPE report estimated that 55.6 million women aged 15 to 64 \nand covered by private insurance had preventive services coverage under the Affordable Care \nAct.  Approximately 16.2 percent of those women were enrolled in plans on exchanges or were \notherwise not covered by employer sponsored insurance, so only 46.6 million women aged 15 to \n64 received the coverage through employer sponsored private insurance plans.85  In addition, \n                                                           \n83 As noted above, the Departments have taken the position that providing contraceptive coverage is cost neutral to \nissuers. (78 FR 39877). At the same time, because of the up-front costs of some contraceptive or sterilization \nmethods, and because some entities did not cover contraception prior to the Affordable Care Act, premiums may be \nexpected to adjust to reflect changes in coverage, thus partially offsetting the transfer experienced by women who \nuse the affected contraceptives.  As discussed elsewhere in this analysis, such women may make up approximately \n8.9 percent (= 20.2 percent x 44.3 percent) of the covered population, in which case the offset would also be \napproximately 8.9 percent. \n84 Describing this impact as a transfer reflects an implicit assumption that the same products and services would be \nused with or without the rule.  Such an assumption is somewhat oversimplified because the interim final rules shift \ncost burden to consumption decision-makers (that is, the women who choose whether or not to use the relevant \ncontraceptives) and thus can be expected to lead to some decrease in use of the affected drugs and devices and a \npotential increase in pregnancy—thus leading to a decrease and an increase, respectively, in medical expenditures. \n85 Available at \nhttps://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/139221/The%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20is%20Improving%20Access\n%20to%20Preventive%20Services%20for%20Millions%20of%20Americans.pdf  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 110 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     109  \n \nsome of those private insurance plans were offered by government employers, encompassing \napproximately 10.5 million of those women aged 15 to 64.86  The expanded exemption in these \ninterim final rules does not apply to government plan sponsors. Thus we estimate that the \nnumber of women aged 15 to 64 covered by private sector employer sponsored insurance who \nreceive preventive services coverage under the Affordable Care Act is approximately 36 million. \nPrior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, approximately 6 percent of \nemployer survey respondents did not offer contraceptive coverage, with 31 percent of \nrespondents not knowing whether they offered such coverage.87  The 6 percent may have \nincluded approximately 2.16 million of the women aged 15–64 covered by employer sponsored \ninsurance plans in the private sector.  According to Census data, 59.9 percent of women aged 15 \nto 64 are of childbearing age (aged 15 to 44), in this case, 1.3 million.  And as noted above, \napproximately 44.3 percent of women of childbearing age use women’s contraceptive methods \n                                                           \n86 The ASPE study relied on Census data of private health insurance plans, which included plans sponsored by either \nprivate or public sector employers.  See Table 2, notes 2 & 3 (explaining the scope of private plans and government \nplans for purposes of Table 2), available at \nhttps://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-250.pdf.  \nAccording to data tables from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) of the Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality of HHS (https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/), State and local governments employ 19,297,960 \npersons; 99.2 percent of those employers offer health insurance; and 67.4 percent of employees that work at such \nentities where insurance is offered are enrolled in those plans, amounting to 12.9 million persons enrolled. DOL \nestimates that in the public sector, for each policyholder there is an average of slightly less than one dependent. \n“Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin” Table 4, page 21. \nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/researchers/data/health-and-welfare/health-insurance-coverage-bulletin-\n2015.pdf.  Therefore, State and local government employer plans cover approximately 24.8 million persons of all \nages. Census data indicates that on average, 12 percent of persons covered by private insurance plans are aged 65 \nand older. Using these numbers, we estimate that State and local government employer plans cover approximately \n21.9 million persons under age 65. \nThe Federal Government has approximately 8.2 million persons covered in its employee health plans. \nAccording to information we received from the Office of Personnel Management, this includes 2.1 million \nemployees having 3.2 million dependents, and 1.9 million retirees (annuitants) having 1 million dependents. We do \nnot have information about the ages of these policyholders and dependents, but for the purposes of this estimate we \nassume the annuitants and their dependents are aged 65 or older and the employees and their dependents are under \nage 65, so that the Federal Government’s employee health plans cover 5.3 million persons under age 65.  \nThus, overall we estimate there are 27.2 million persons under age 65 enrolled in private health insurance \nsponsored by government employers. Of those, 38.3 percent are women aged 15-64, that is, 10.5 million.   \n87 Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits, 2010 Annual \nSurvey” at 196, available at https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/8085.pdf. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 111 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     110  \n \ncovered by the Guidelines. Therefore we estimate that 574,000 women of childbearing age that \nuse contraceptives covered by the Guidelines were covered by plans that omitted contraceptive \ncoverage prior to the Affordable Care Act.88 \nIt is unknown what motivated those employers to omit contraceptive coverage—whether \nthey did so for conscientious reasons, or for other reasons.  Despite our lack of information about \ntheir motives, we attempt to make a reasonable estimate of the upper bound of the number of \nthose employers that omitted contraception before the Affordable Care Act and that would make \nuse of these expanded exemptions based on sincerely held religious beliefs.  \nTo begin, we estimate that publicly traded companies would not likely make use of these \nexpanded exemptions.  Even though the rule does not preclude publicly traded companies from \ndropping coverage based on a sincerely held religious belief, it is likely that attempts to object on \nreligious grounds by publicly traded companies would be rare.  The Departments take note of the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Hobby Lobby, where the Court observed that “HHS has not pointed \nto any example of a publicly traded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous practical \nrestraints would likely prevent that from occurring.  For example, the idea that unrelated \nshareholders—including institutional investors with their own set of stakeholders—would agree \nto run a corporation under the same religious beliefs seems improbable”.  134 S. Ct. at 2774.  \n                                                           \n88 Some of the 31 percent of survey respondents that did not know about contraceptive coverage may not have \noffered such coverage.  If it were possible to account for this non-coverage, the estimate of potentially affected \ncovered women could increase. On the other hand, these employers’ lack of knowledge about contraceptive \ncoverage suggests that they lacked sincerely held religious beliefs specifically objecting to such coverage—beliefs \nwithout which they would not qualify for the expanded exemptions offered by these rules. In that case, omission of \nsuch employers and covered women from this estimation approach would be appropriate. Correspondingly, the 6 \npercent of employers that had direct knowledge about the absence of coverage may be more likely to have omitted \nsuch coverage on the basis of religious beliefs than were the 31 percent of survey respondents who did not know \nwhether the coverage was offered.  Yet an entity’s mere knowledge about its coverage status does not itself reflect \nits motive for omitting coverage.  In responding to the survey, the entity may have simply examined its plan \ndocument to determine whether or not contraceptive coverage was offered.  As will be relevant in a later portion of \nthe analysis, we have no data indicating what portion of the entities that omitted contraceptive coverage pre-\nAffordable Care Act did so on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs, as opposed to doing so for other reasons \nthat would not qualify them for the expanded exemption offered in these interim final rules.   \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 112 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     111  \n \nThe Departments are aware of several Federal health care conscience laws89 that in some cases \nhave existed for decades and that protect companies, including publicly traded companies, from \ndiscrimination if, for example, they decline to facilitate abortion, but we are not aware of \nexamples where publicly traded companies have made use of these exemptions.  Thus, while we \nconsider it important to include publicly traded companies in the scope of these expanded \nexemptions for reasons similar to those used by the Congress in RFRA and some health care \nconscience laws, in estimating the anticipated effects of the expanded exemptions we agree with \nthe Supreme Court that it is improbable any will do so.   \nThis assumption is significant because 31.3 percent of employees in the private sector \nwork for publicly traded companies.90  That means that only approximately 394,000 women aged \n15 to 44 that use contraceptives covered by the Guidelines were covered by plans of non-\npublicly traded companies that did not provide contraceptive coverage pre-Affordable Care Act.   \nMoreover, these interim final rules build on existing rules that already exempt houses of \nworship and integrated auxiliaries and, as explained above, effectively remove obligations to \nprovide contraceptive coverage within objecting self-insured church plans.  These rules will \ntherefore not effect transfers to women in the plans of such employers.  In attempting to estimate \nthe number of such employers, we consider the following information.  Many Catholic dioceses \nhave litigated or filed public comments opposing the Mandate, representing to the Departments \nand to courts around the country that official Catholic Church teaching opposes contraception. \n                                                           \n89 For example, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b), 42 U.S.C. 238n, and Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div.

This is true even though there \nare only about 4,300 publicly traded companies in the U.S. See Rayhanul Ibrahim, “The number of publicly-traded \nUS companies is down 46% in the past two decades,” Yahoo! Finance (Aug. 8, 2016), available at \nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/jp-startup-public-companies-fewer-000000709.html. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 113 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     112  \n \nThere are 17,651 Catholic parishes in the United States91, 197 Catholic dioceses,92 5,224 \nCatholic elementary schools, and 1,205 Catholic secondary schools.93 Not all Catholic schools \nare integrated auxiliaries of Catholic churches, but there are other Catholic entities that are \nintegrated auxiliaries that are not schools, so we use the number of schools to estimate of the \nnumber of integrated auxiliaries.  Among self-insured church plans that oppose the Mandate, the \nDepartment has been sued by two—Guidestone and Christian Brothers.  Guidestone is a plan \norganized by the Southern Baptist convention. It covers 38,000 employers, some of which are \nexempt as churches or integrated auxiliaries, and some of which are not.94 Christian Brothers is a \nplan that covers Catholic organizations.  It covers Catholic churches and integrated auxiliaries, \nwhich are estimated above, but also it has said in litigation that it also covers about 500 \nadditional entities that are not exempt as churches.  In total, therefore, we estimate that \napproximately 62,000 employers among houses of worship, integrated auxiliaries, and church \nplans, were exempt or relieved of contraceptive coverage obligations under the previous rules. \nWe do not know how many persons are covered in the plans of those employers.  Guidestone \nreports that among its 38,000 employers, its plan covers approximately 220,000 persons, and its \nemployers include “churches, mission-sending agencies, hospitals, educational institutions and \nother related ministries.”  Using that ratio, we estimate that the 62,000 church and church plan \nemployers among Guidestone, Christian Brothers, and Catholic churches would include 359,000 \npersons. Among them, as referenced above, 72,500 would be of childbearing age, and 32,100 \n                                                           \n91 Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno, “Diocese of Reno Directory: 2016-2017,” available at \nhttp://www.renodiocese.org/documents/2016/9/2016%202017%20directory.pdf.   \n92 Wikipedia, “List of Catholic dioceses in the United States,” available at \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_dioceses_in_the_United_States. \n93 National Catholic Educational Association, “Catholic School Data,” available at \nhttp://www.ncea.org/NCEA/Proclaim/Catholic_School_Data/Catholic_School_Data.aspx. \n94 Guidestone Financial Resources, “Who We Serve,” available at \nhttps://www.guidestone.org/AboutUs/WhoWeServe. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 114 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     113  \n \nwould use contraceptives covered by the Guidelines.  Therefore, we estimate that the private, \nnon-publicly traded employers that did not cover contraception pre-Affordable Care Act, and \nthat were not exempt by the previous rules nor were participants in self-insured church plans that \noppose contraceptive coverage, covered 362,100 women aged 15 to 44 that use contraceptives \ncovered by the Guidelines.  As noted above, we estimate an average annual expenditure on \ncontraceptive products and services of $584 per user.  That would amount to $211.5 million in \npotential transfer impact among entities that did not cover contraception pre- Affordable Care \nAct for any reason.   \nWe do not have data indicating how many of the entities that omitted coverage of \ncontraception pre- Affordable Care Act did so on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs that \nmight qualify them for exempt status under these interim final rules, as opposed to having done \nso for other reasons.  Besides the entities that filed lawsuits or submitted public comments \nconcerning previous rules on this matter, we are not aware of entities that omitted contraception \npre-Affordable Care Act and then opposed the contraceptive coverage requirement after it was \nimposed by the Guidelines.  For the following reasons, however, we believe that a reasonable \nestimate is that no more than approximately one third of the persons covered by relevant \nentities—that is, no more than approximately 120,000 affected women—would likely be subject \nto potential transfer impacts under the expanded religious exemptions offered in these interim \nfinal rules.  Consequently, as explained below, we believe that the potential impact of these \ninterim final rules falls substantially below the $100 million threshold for economically \nsignificant and major rules. \nFirst, as mentioned, we are not aware of information that would lead us to estimate that \nall or most entities that omitted coverage of contraception pre-Affordable Care Act did so on the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 115 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     114  \n \nbasis of sincerely held conscientious objections in general or religious beliefs specifically, as \nopposed to having done so for other reasons.  Moreover, as suggested by the Guidestone data \nmentioned previously, employers with conscientious objections may tend to have relatively few \nemployees.  Also, avoiding negative publicity, the difficulty of taking away a fringe benefit that \nemployees have become accustomed to having, and avoiding the administrative cost of \nrenegotiating insurance contracts, all provide reasons for some employers not to return to pre-\nAffordable Care Act lack of contraceptive coverage.  Additionally, as discussed above, many \nemployers with objections to contraception, including several of the largest litigants, only object \nto some contraceptives and cover as many as 14 of 18 of the contraceptive methods included in \nthe Guidelines.  This will reduce, and potentially eliminate, the contraceptive cost transfer for \nwomen covered in their plans.95  Furthermore, among nonprofit entities that object to the \nMandate, it is possible that a greater share of their employees oppose contraception than among \nthe general population, which should lead to a reduction in the estimate of how many women in \nthose plans actually use contraception.  \nIn addition, not all sincerely held conscientious objections to contraceptive coverage are \nlikely to be held by persons with religious beliefs as distinct from persons with sincerely held \nnon-religious moral convictions, whose objections would not be encompassed by these interim \nfinal rules.96  We do not have data to indicate, among entities that did not cover contraception \n                                                           \n95 On the other hand, a key input in the approach that generated the one third threshold estimate was a survey \nindicating that six percent of employers did not provide contraceptive coverage pre-Affordable Care Act.  \nEmployers that covered some contraceptives pre-Affordable Care Act may have answered “yes” or “don’t know” to \nthe survey.  In such cases, the potential transfer estimate has a tendency toward underestimation because the rule’s \neffects on such women—causing their contraceptive coverage to be reduced from all 18 methods to some smaller \nsubset—have been omitted from the calculation. \n96 Such objections may be encompassed by companion interim final rules published elsewhere in this Federal \nRegister.  Those rules, however, as an interim final matter, are more narrow in scope than these rules.  For example, \nin providing expanded exemptions for plan sponsors, they do not encompass companies with certain publicly traded \nownership interests. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 116 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     115  \n \npre-Affordable Care Act based on sincerely held conscientious objections as opposed to other \nreasons, which ones did so based on religious beliefs and which ones did so instead based on \nnon-religious moral convictions.  Among the general public, polls vary about religious beliefs \nbut one prominent poll shows that 89 percent of Americans say they believe in God, while 11 \npercent say they do not or are agnostic.97  Therefore, we estimate that for every ten entities that \nomitted contraception pre-Affordable Care Act based on sincerely held conscientious objections \nas opposed to other reasons, one did so based on sincerely held non-religious moral convictions, \nand therefore are not affected by the expanded exemption provided by these interim final rules \nfor religious beliefs.  \nBased on our estimate of an average annual expenditure on contraceptive products and \nservices of $584 per user, the effect of the expanded exemptions on 120,000 women would give \nrise to approximately $70.1 million in potential transfer impact.  This falls substantially below \nthe $100 million threshold for economically significant and major rules.  In addition, as noted \nabove, premiums may be expected to adjust to reflect changes in coverage, thus partially \noffsetting the transfer experienced by women who use the affected contraceptives.  As discussed \nelsewhere in this analysis, such women may make up approximately 8.9 percent (= 20.2 percent \nx 44.3 percent) of the covered population, in which case the offset would also be approximately \n8.9 percent, yielding a potential transfer of $63.8 million.   \nWe request comment on all aspects of the preceding regulatory impact analysis, as well \nas on how to attribute impacts to this interim final rule and the companion interim final rule \nconcerning exemptions provided based on sincerely held (non-religious) moral convictions \npublished elsewhere in this Federal Register. \n                                                           \n97 Gallup, “Most Americans Still Believe in God” (June 14–23, 2016), available at \nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/193271/americans-believe-god.aspx.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 117 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     116  \n \nB.  Special Analyses—Department of the Treasury \nFor purposes of the Department of the Treasury, certain Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nregulations, including this one, are exempt from the requirements in Executive Order 12866, as \nsupplemented by Executive Order 13563.  The Departments anticipate that there will be more \nentities reluctantly using the existing accommodation that will choose to operate under the newly \nexpanded exemption, than entities that are not currently eligible to use the accommodation that \nwill opt into it.  The effect of this rule will therefore be that fewer overall adjustments are made \nto the Federally facilitated Exchange user fees for entities using the accommodation process, as \nlong as the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services requests and an \nauthorizing exception under OMB Circular No. A-25R is in effect, than would have occurred \nunder the previous rule if this rule were not finalized. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not \nrequired.  \nC.  Regulatory Flexibility Act \nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (RFA) imposes certain \nrequirements with respect to Federal rules that are subject to the notice and comment \nrequirements of section 553(b) of the APA (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and that are likely to have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  Under Section 553(b) of \nthe APA, a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required when an agency, for good \ncause, finds that notice and public comment thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary \nto the public interest.  The interim final rules are exempt from the APA, both because the PHS \nAct, ERISA, and the Code contain specific provisions under which the Secretaries may adopt \nregulations by interim final rule and because the Departments have made a good cause finding \nthat a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary earlier in this preamble.  Therefore, \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 118 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     117  \n \nthe RFA does not apply and the Departments are not required to either certify that the regulations \nor this amendment would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities or conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis. \nNevertheless, the Departments carefully considered the likely impact of the rule on small \nentities in connection with their assessment under Executive Order 12866.  The Departments do \nnot expect that these interim final rules will have a significant economic effect on a substantial \nnumber of small entities, because they will not result in any additional costs to affected entities, \nand in many cases will relieve burdens and costs from such entities.  By exempting from the \nMandate small businesses and nonprofit organizations with religious objections to some (or all) \ncontraceptives and/or sterilization, the Departments have reduced regulatory burden on such \nsmall entities.  Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, these regulations have been submitted to \nthe Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their \nimpact on small business.  \nD.  Paperwork Reduction Act—Department of Health and Human Services  \nUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA), Federal agencies are required to \npublish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information.  \nInterested persons are invited to send comments regarding our burden estimates or any other \naspect of this collection of information, including any of the following subjects:  (1) the necessity \nand utility of the proposed information collection for the proper performance of the agency's \nfunctions; (2) the accuracy of the estimated burden; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and \nclarity of the information to be collected; and (4) the use of automated collection techniques or \nother forms of information technology to minimize the information collection burden.    \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 119 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     118  \n \nHowever, we are requesting an emergency review of the information collection \nreferenced later in this section.  In compliance with the requirement of section 3506(c)(2)(A) of \nthe PRA, we have submitted the following for emergency review to the Office of Management \nand Budget (OMB).  We are requesting an emergency review and approval under both \n5 CFR 1320.13(a)(2)(i) and (iii) of the implementing regulations of the PRA in order to \nimplement provisions regarding self-certification or notices to HHS from eligible organizations \n(§147.131(c)(3)), notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services \n(§147.131(f)), and notice of revocation of accommodation (§147.131(c)(4)).  In accordance with \n5 CFR 1320.13(a)(2)(i), we believe public harm is reasonably likely to ensue if the normal \nclearance procedures are followed.  The use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely \nto prevent or disrupt the collection of information.  Similarly, in accordance with 5 CFR \n1320.13(a)(2)(iii), we believe the use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely to \ncause a statutory or court ordered deadline to be missed.  Many cases have been on remand for \nover a year from the Supreme Court, asking the Departments and the parties to resolve this \nmatter.  These interim final rules extend exemptions to entities, which involves no collection of \ninformation and which the Departments have statutory authority to do by the use of interim final \nrules.  If the information collection involved in the amended accommodation process is not \napproved on an emergency basis, newly exempt entities that wish to opt into the amended \naccommodation process might not be able to do so until normal clearance procedures are \ncompleted. \nA description of the information collection provisions implicated in these interim final \nrules is given in the following section with an estimate of the annual burden.  Average labor \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 120 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     119  \n \ncosts (including 100 percent fringe benefits) used to estimate the costs are calculated using data \navailable from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.98  \na. ICRs Regarding Self-Certification or Notices to HHS (§147.131(c)(3)) \nEach organization seeking to be treated as an eligible organization that wishes to use the \noptional accommodation process offered under these interim final rules must either use the \nEBSA Form 700 method of self-certification or provide notice to HHS of its religious objection \nto coverage of all or a subset of contraceptive services.  Specifically, these interim final rules \ncontinue to allow eligible organizations to notify an issuer or third party administrator using \nEBSA Form 700, or to notify HHS, of their religious objection to coverage of all or a subset of \ncontraceptive services, as set forth in the July 2015 final regulations.  The burden related to the \nnotice to HHS is currently approved under OMB Control Number 0938-1248 and the burden \nrelated to the self-certification (EBSA Form 700) is currently approved under OMB control \nnumber 0938-1292.  \nNotably, however, entities that are participating in the previous accommodation process, \nwhere a self-certification or notice has already been submitted, and where the entities choose to \ncontinue their accommodated status under these interim final rules, generally do not need to file \na new self-certification or notice (unless they change their issuer or third party administrator).  \nAs explained above, HHS assumes that, among the 209 entities we estimated are using the \nprevious accommodation, 109 will use the expanded exemption and 100 will continue under the \nvoluntary accommodation.  Those 100 entities will not need to file additional self-certifications \nor notices.  HHS also assumes that an additional 9 entities that were not using the previous \n                                                           \n98 May 2016 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates United States found at \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 121 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     120  \n \naccommodation will opt into it.  Those entities will be subject to the self-certification or notice \nrequirement. \nIn order to estimate the cost for an entity that chooses to opt into the accommodation \nprocess, HHS assumes, as it did in its August 2014 interim final rules, that clerical staff for each \neligible organization will gather and enter the necessary information and send the self-\ncertification to the issuer or third party administrator as appropriate, or send the notice to HHS.99  \nHHS assumes that a compensation and benefits manager and inside legal counsel will review the \nself-certification or notice to HHS and a senior executive would execute it.  HHS estimates that \nan eligible organization would spend approximately 50 minutes (30 minutes of clerical labor at a \ncost of $55.68 per hour,100 10 minutes for a compensation and benefits manager at a cost of \n$122.02 per hour,101 5 minutes for legal counsel at a cost of $134.50 per hour,102 and 5 minutes \nby a senior executive at a cost of $186.88 per hour103) preparing and sending the self-certification \nor notice to HHS and filing it to meet the recordkeeping requirement.  Therefore, the total annual \nburden for preparing and providing the information in the self-certification or notice to HHS will \nrequire approximately 50 minutes for each eligible organization with an equivalent cost burden \nof approximately $74.96 for a total hour burden of approximately 7.5 hours with an equivalent \ncost of approximately $675 for 9 entities. As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are splitting \n                                                           \n99 For purposes of this analysis, the Department assumes that the same amount of time will be required to prepare \nthe self-certification and the notice to HHS. \n100 Occupation code 43-6011 for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants with mean hourly \nwage $27.84, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes436011.htm \n101 Occupation code 11-3111 for Compensation and Benefits Managers with mean hourly wage $61.01, \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes113111.htm \n102 Occupation code 23-1011 for Lawyers with mean hourly wage $67.25, \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm \n103 Occupation code11-1011 for Chief Executives with mean hourly wage $93.44, \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes111011.htm \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 122 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     121  \n \nthe hour burden so each will account for approximately 3.75 burden hours with an equivalent \ncost of approximately $337.  \nHHS estimates that each self-certification or notice to HHS will require $0.49 in postage \nand $0.05 in materials cost (paper and ink) and the total postage and materials cost for each self-\ncertification or notice sent via mail will be $0.54.  For purposes of this analysis, HHS assumes \nthat 50 percent of self-certifications or notices to HHS will be mailed.  The total cost for sending \nthe self-certifications or notices to HHS by mail is approximately $2.70 for 5 entities.  As DOL \nand HHS share jurisdiction they are splitting the cost burden so each will account for $1.35 of \nthe cost burden. \nb. ICRs Regarding Notice of Availability of Separate Payments for Contraceptive Services \n(§147.131(e)) \nAs required by the July 2015 final regulations, a health insurance issuer or third party \nadministrator providing or arranging separate payments for contraceptive services for \nparticipants and beneficiaries in insured or self-insured group health plans (or student enrollees \nand covered dependents in student health insurance coverage) of eligible organizations is \nrequired to provide a written notice to plan participants and beneficiaries (or student enrollees \nand covered dependents) informing them of the availability of such payments.  The notice must \nbe separate from, but contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), any application materials \ndistributed in connection with enrollment (or re-enrollment) in group or student coverage of the \neligible organization in any plan year to which the accommodation is to apply and will be \nprovided annually.  To satisfy the notice requirement, issuers and third party administrators may, \nbut are not required to, use the model language set forth previously by HHS or substantially \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 123 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     122  \n \nsimilar language.  The burden for this ICR is currently approved under OMB control number \n0938-1292. \nAs mentioned, HHS is anticipating that approximately 109 entities will use the optional \naccommodation (100 that used it previously, and 9 that will newly opt into it).  It is unknown \nhow many issuers or third party administrators provide health insurance coverage or services in \nconnection with health plans of eligible organizations, but HHS will assume at least 109.  It is \nestimated that each issuer or third party administrator will need  approximately 1 hour of clerical \nlabor (at $55.68 per hour)104 and 15 minutes of management review (at $117.40 per hour)105 to \nprepare the notices.  The total burden for each issuer or third party administrator to prepare \nnotices will be 1.25 hours with an equivalent cost of approximately $85.03.  The total burden for \nall issuers or third party administrators will be 136 hours, with an equivalent cost of $9,268.  As \nDOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are splitting the hour burden so each will account for 68 \nburden hours with an equivalent cost of $4,634, with approximately 55 respondents. \nAs discussed above, the Departments estimate that 770,000 persons will be covered in the \nplans of the 100 entities that previously used the accommodation and will continue doing so, and \nthat an additional 9 entities will newly opt into the accommodation.  It is not known how many \npersons will be covered in the plans of the 9 entities newly using the accommodation.  Assuming \nthat those 9 entities will have a similar number of covered persons per entity, we estimate that all \n109 accommodated entities will encompass 839,300 covered persons.  We assume that sending \none notice to each participant will satisfy the need to send the notices to all participants and \ndependents. Among persons covered by plans, approximately 50.1 percent are participants and \n                                                           \n104 Occupation code 43-6011 for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants with mean hourly \nwage $27.84. \n105 Occupation code 11-1021 General and Operations Managers with mean hourly wage $58.70. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 124 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     123  \n \n49.9 percent are dependents.106  For 109 entities, the total number of notices will be 420,490.  \nFor purposes of this analysis, the Departments also assume that 53.7 percent of notices will be \nsent electronically, and 46.3 percent will be mailed.107  Therefore, approximately 194,687 notices \nwill be mailed.  HHS estimates that each notice will require $0.49 in postage and $0.05 in \nmaterials cost (paper and ink) and the total postage and materials cost for each notice sent via \nmail will be $0.54.  The total cost for sending approximately 194,687 notices by mail is \napproximately $105,131.  As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are splitting the cost burden \nso each will account for $52,565 of the cost burden. \nc. ICRs Regarding Notice of Revocation of Accommodation (§147.131(c)(4)) \nAn eligible organization may revoke its use of the accommodation process; its issuer or \nthird party administrator must provide written notice of such revocation to participants and \nbeneficiaries as soon as practicable.  As discussed above, HHS estimates that 109 entities that are \nusing the accommodation process will revoke their use of the accommodation, and will therefore \nbe required to cause the notification to be sent (the issuer or third party administrator can send \nthe notice on behalf of the entity).  For the purpose of calculating ICRs associated with \nrevocations of the accommodation, and for various reasons discussed above, HHS assumes that \n                                                           \n106 “Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin” Table 4, page 21.  Using March 2015 Annual Social and Economic \nSupplement to the Current Population Survey.  https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/researchers/data/health-\nand-welfare/health-insurance-coverage-bulletin-2015.pdf.  \n107 According to data from the National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA), 36.0 percent of \nindividuals age 25 and over have access to the internet at work.  According to a Greenwald & Associates survey, 84 \npercent of plan participants find it acceptable to make electronic delivery the default option, which is used as the \nproxy for the number of participants who will not opt out that are automatically enrolled (for a total of 30.2 percent \nreceiving electronic disclosure at work).  Additionally, the NTIA reports that 38.5 percent of individuals age 25 and \nover have access to the internet outside of work.  According to a Pew Research Center survey, 61 percent of internet \nusers use online banking, which is used as the proxy for the number of internet users who will opt in for electronic \ndisclosure (for a total of 23.5 percent receiving electronic disclosure outside of work).  Combining the 30.2 percent \nwho receive electronic disclosure at work with the 23.5 percent who receive electronic disclosure outside of work \nproduces a total of 53.7 percent who will receive electronic disclosure overall. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 125 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     124  \n \nlitigating entities that were previously using the accommodation and that will revoke it fall \nwithin the estimated 109 entities that will revoke the accommodation overall.    \nAs before, HHS assumes that, for each issuer or third party administrator, a manager and \ninside legal counsel and clerical staff will need approximately 2 hours to prepare and send the \nnotification to participants and beneficiaries and maintain records (30 minutes for a manager at a \ncost of $117.40 per hour,108 30 minutes for legal counsel at a cost of $134.50 per hour109, 1 hour \nfor clerical labor at a cost of $55.68 per hour110).  The burden per respondent will be 2 hours with \nan equivalent cost of $181.63; for 109 entities, the total burden will be 218 hours with an \nequivalent cost of approximately $19,798.  As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are \nsplitting the hour burden so each will account for 109 burden hours with an equivalent cost of \napproximately $9,899. \nAs discussed above, HHS estimates that there are 257,000 covered persons in \naccommodated plans that will revoke their accommodated status and use the expanded \nexemption.111  As before, we use the average of 50.1 percent of covered persons who are \npolicyholders, and estimate that an average of 53.7 percent of notices will be sent electronically \nand 46.3 percent by mail.  Therefore, approximately 128,757 notices will be sent, of which \n59,615 notices will be mailed.  HHS estimates that each notice will require $0.49 in postage and \n                                                           \n108 Occupation code 11-1021 for General and Operations Managers with mean hourly wage $58.70, \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes111021.htm \n109 Occupation code 23-1011 for Lawyers with mean hourly wage $67.25, \nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm \n110 Occupation code 43-6011 for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants with mean hourly \nwage $27.84, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes436011.htm \n111 In estimating the number of women that might have their contraceptive coverage affected by the expanded \nexemption, we indicated that we do not know the extent to which the number of women in accommodated plans \naffected by these rules overlap with the number of women in plans offered by litigating entities that will be affected \nby these rules, though we assume there is significant overlap. That uncertainty should not affect the calculation of \nthe ICRs for revocation notices, however. If the two numbers overlap, the estimates of plans revoking the \naccommodation and policyholders covered in those plans would already include plans and policyholders of litigating \nentities. If the numbers do not overlap, those litigating entity plans would not presently be enrolled in the \naccommodation, and therefore would not need to send notices concerning revocation of accommodated status.  \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 126 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     125  \n \n$0.05 in materials cost (paper and ink) and the total postage and materials cost for each notice \nsent via mail will be $0.54. The total cost for sending approximately 59,615 notices by mail is \napproximately $32,192.  As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are splitting the hour burden \nso each will account for 64,379 notices, with an equivalent cost of approximately $16,096. \nTable 1: Summary of Information Collection Burdens \nHourly  Total \nTotal  Labor  Labor \nOMB  Burden per  Annual  Cost of  Cost of \nRegulation  Control  Number of  Respondent  Burden  Reporting  Reporting  Total Cost \nSection  Number  respondents  Responses  (hours)  (hours)  ($)  ($)  ($) \nSelf- 0938- 5*  5  0.83  3.75  $89.95   $337.31   $338.66  \nCertification or  NEW \nNotices to HHS \nNotice of  0938- 55*  210,245  1.25  68.13  $68.02   $4,634.14   $57,199.59  \nAvailability of  NEW \nSeparate \nPayments for \nContraceptive \nServices \nNotice of  0938- 55*  64,379  2.00  109  $90.82   $9,898.84   $25,994.75  \nRevocation of  NEW \nAccommodation \nTotal     115*  274,629  4.08  180.88    $14,870.29   $83,533.00  \n*The total number of respondents is 227 (= 9+109+109) for both HHS and DOL, but the summaries here and below \nexceed that total because of rounding up that occurs when sharing the burden between HHS and DOL. \nNote: There are no capital/maintenance costs associated with the ICRs contained in this rule; therefore, we have \nremoved the associated column from Table 1.

DOL submitted the ICRs in order to obtain OMB approval under \nthe PRA for the regulatory revision.  The request was made under emergency clearance \nprocedures specified in regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13.  In an effort to consolidate the number of \ninformation collection requests, DOL will combine the ICR related to the OMB control number \n1210-0152 with the ICR related to the OMB control number 1210-0150.  Once the ICR is \napproved DOL will discontinue 1210-0152.

This approval will \nallow respondents to temporarily utilize the additional flexibility these interim final regulations \nprovide, while DOL seeks public comment on the collection methods—including their utility and \nburden.  \nConsistent with the analysis in the HHS PRA section above, the Departments expect that \neach of the estimated 9 eligible organizations newly opting into the accommodation will spend \napproximately 50 minutes in preparation time and incur $0.54 mailing cost to self-certify or \nnotify HHS.  Each of the 109 issuers or third party administrators for the 109 eligible \norganizations that make use of the accommodation overall will distribute Notices of Availability \nof Separate Payments for Contraceptive Services.  These issuers and third party administrators \nwill spend approximately 1.25 hours in preparation time and incur $0.54 cost per mailed notice.  \nNotices of Availability of Separate Payments for Contraceptive Services will need to be sent to \n420,489 policyholders, and 53.7 percent of the notices will be sent electronically, while 46.3 \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 129 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     128  \n \npercent will be mailed. Finally, 109 entities using the previous accommodation process will \nrevoke its use and will therefore be required to cause the Notice of Revocation of \nAccommodation to be sent (the issuer or third party administrator can send the notice on behalf \nof the entity).  These entities will spend approximately two hours in preparation time and incur \n$0.54 cost per mailed notice.  Notice of Revocation of Accommodation will need to be sent to an \naverage of 128,757 policyholders and 53.7 percent of the notices will be sent electronically.  The \nDOL information collections in this rule are found in 29 CFR 2510.3-16 and 2590.715-2713A \nand are summarized as follows:  \nType of Review: Revised Collection.  \nAgency: DOL–EBSA.  \nTitle: Coverage of Certain Preventive Services under the Affordable Care  Act—Private \nSector.  \nOMB Numbers: 1210-0150.  \nAffected Public: Private Sector—Not for profit and religious organizations; businesses or \nother for-profits.  \nTotal Respondents: 114112 (combined with HHS total is 227).  \nTotal Responses: 274,628 (combined with HHS total is 549,255).  \nFrequency of Response: On occasion.  \nEstimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 181 (combined with HHS total is 362 hours). \nEstimated Total Annual Burden Cost: $68,662 (combined with HHS total is $137,325). \nType of Review: Revised Collection.  \nAgency: DOL–EBSA.  \n                                                           \n112 Denotes that there is an overlap between jurisdiction shared by HHS and DOL over these respondents and \ntherefore they are included only once in the total. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 130 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     129  \n \nF.  Regulatory Reform Executive Orders 13765, 13771 and 13777 \nExecutive Order 13765 (January 20, 2017) directs that, “[t]o the maximum extent \npermitted by law, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and the heads \nof all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities \nunder the Act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant \nexemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that \nwould impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on \nindividuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare \nservices, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or \nmedications.”  In addition, agencies are directed to “take all actions consistent with law to \nminimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the [Affordable Care Act], and \nprepare to afford the States more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare \nmarket.”  These interim final rules exercise the discretion provided to the Departments under the \nAffordable Care Act, RFRA, and other laws to grant exemptions and thereby minimize \nregulatory burdens of the Affordable Care Act on the affected entities and recipients of health \ncare services. \nConsistent with Executive Order 13771 (82 FR 9339, February 3, 2017), we have \nestimated the costs and cost savings attributable to this interim final rule.  As discussed in more \ndetail in the preceding analysis, this interim final rule lessens incremental reporting costs.113  \nTherefore, this interim final rule is considered an Executive Order 13771 deregulatory action.     \n                                                           \n113 Other noteworthy potential impacts encompass potential changes in medical expenditures, including potential \ndecreased expenditures on contraceptive devices and drugs and potential increased expenditures on pregnancy-\nrelated medical services. OMB’s guidance on EO 13771 implementation (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-\noffice/2017/04/05/memorandum-implementing-executive-order-13771-titled-reducing-regulation) states that \nimpacts should be categorized as consistently as possible within Departments.

Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \nThe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (section 202(a) of Pub. L. 104-4), requires \nthe Departments to prepare a written statement, which includes an assessment of anticipated \ncosts and benefits, before issuing “any rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in \nthe expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, \nof $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year.”  The current \nthreshold after adjustment for inflation is $148 million, using the most current (2016) Implicit \nPrice Deflater for the Gross Domestic Product.  For purposes of the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct, these interim final rules do not include any Federal mandate that may result in expenditures \nby State, local, or tribal governments, nor do they include any Federal mandates that may impose \nan annual burden of $100 million, adjusted for inflation, or more on the private sector. \nG.  Federalism \nExecutive Order 13132 outlines fundamental principles of federalism, and requires the \nadherence to specific criteria by Federal agencies in the process of their formulation and \nimplementation of policies that have “substantial direct effects” on States, the relationship \nbetween the Federal Government and States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities \namong the various levels of Government.  Federal agencies promulgating regulations that have \nthese federalism implications must consult with State and local officials, and describe the extent \nof their consultation and the nature of the concerns of State and local officials in the preamble to \nthe regulation. \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAdministration (MSHA), within DOL, regularly estimate medical expenditure impacts in the analyses that \naccompany their regulations, with the results being categorized as benefits (positive benefits if expenditures are \nreduced, negative benefits if expenditures are raised).  Following the FDA, OSHA and MSHA accounting \nconvention leads to this interim final rule’s medical expenditure impacts being categorized as (positive or negative) \nbenefits, rather than as costs, thus placing them outside of consideration for EO 13771 designation purposes. \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 132 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     131  \n \nThese interim final rules do not have any Federalism implications, since they only \nprovide exemptions from the contraceptive and sterilization coverage requirement in HRSA \nGuidelines supplied under section 2713 of the PHS Act. \nVII.

To qualify as an eligible organization, the \norganization must make such self-certification or notice available for examination upon request \nby the first day of the first plan year to which the accommodation in paragraph (b) or (c) of this \nsection applies.  The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person authorized to make \nthe certification or provide the notice on behalf of the organization, and must be maintained in a \nmanner consistent with the record retention requirements under section 107 of ERISA. \n(5)  An eligible organization may revoke its use of the accommodation process, and its \nissuer or third party administrator must provide participants and beneficiaries written notice of \nsuch revocation as specified in guidance issued by the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.  If contraceptive coverage is currently being offered by an issuer or third party \nadministrator through the accommodation process, the revocation will be effective on the first \nday of the first plan year that begins on or after 30 days after the date of the revocation (to allow \nfor the provision of notice to plan participants in cases where contraceptive benefits will no \nlonger be provided).  Alternatively, an eligible organization may give sixty-days notice pursuant \nto section 2715(d)(4) of the PHS Act and § 54.9815-2715(b), if applicable, to revoke its use of \nthe accommodation process. \n(b)  Optional accommodation - self-insured group health plans. (1) A group health plan \nestablished or maintained by an eligible organization that provides benefits on a self-insured \nbasis may voluntarily elect an optional accommodation under which its third party \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 140 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     139  \n \nadministrator(s) will provide or arrange payments for all or a subset of contraceptive services for \none or more plan years.

If there is a change in any of \nthe information required to be included in the notice, the eligible organization must provide \nupdated information to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for the \noptional accommodation process to remain in effect.  The Department of Labor (working with \nthe Department of Health and Human Services), will send a separate notification to each of the \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 141 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     140  \n \nplan’s third party administrators informing the third party administrator that the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has received a notice under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of \nthis section and describing the obligations of the third party administrator under 29 CFR 2510.3-\n16 and this section. \n(2)  If a third party administrator receives a copy of the self-certification from an eligible \norganization or a notification from the Department of Labor, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) \nof this section, and is willing to enter into or remain in a contractual relationship with the eligible \norganization or its plan to provide administrative services for the plan, then the third party \nadministrator will provide or arrange payments for contraceptive services, using one of the \nfollowing methods— \n(i)  Provide payments for the contraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries \nwithout imposing any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a \ndeductible), premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the \neligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries; or \n(ii)  Arrange for an issuer or other entity to provide payments for the contraceptive \nservices for plan participants and beneficiaries without imposing any cost-sharing requirements \n(such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), premium, fee, or other charge, or any \nportion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan \nparticipants or beneficiaries. \n(3)  If a third party administrator provides or arranges payments for contraceptive \nservices in accordance with either paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the costs of providing \nor arranging such payments may be reimbursed through an adjustment to the Federally facilitated \nExchange user fee for a participating issuer pursuant to 45 CFR 156.50(d). \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 142 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     141  \n \n(4)  A third party administrator may not require any documentation other than a copy of \nthe self-certification from the eligible organization or notification from the Department of Labor \ndescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.  \n(5)  Where an otherwise eligible organization does not contract with a third party \nadministrator and files a self-certification or notice under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the \nobligations under paragraph (b)(2) of this section do not apply, and the otherwise eligible \norganization is under no requirement to provide coverage or payments for contraceptive services \nto which it objects.  The plan administrator for that otherwise eligible organization may, if it and \nthe otherwise eligible organization choose, arrange for payments for contraceptive services from \nan issuer or other entity in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, and such issuer or \nother entity may receive reimbursements in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. \n(6)  Where an otherwise eligible organization is an ERISA-exempt church plan within the \nmeaning of section 3(33) of ERISA and it files a self-certification or notice under paragraph \n(b)(1)(ii) of this section, the obligations under paragraph (b)(2) of this section do not apply, and \nthe otherwise eligible organization is under no requirement to provide coverage or payments for \ncontraceptive services to which it objects.  The third party administrator for that otherwise \neligible organization may, if it and the otherwise eligible organization choose, provide or arrange \npayments for contraceptive services in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, \nand receive reimbursements in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.   \n(c)  Optional accommodation - insured group health plans—(1)  General rule.  A group \nhealth plan established or maintained by an eligible organization that provides benefits through \none or more group health insurance issuers may voluntarily elect an optional accommodation \nunder which its health insurance issuer(s) will provide payments for all or a subset of \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 143 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     142  \n \ncontraceptive services for one or more plan years.  To invoke the optional accommodation \nprocess-- \n(i)  The eligible organization or its plan must contract with one or more health insurance \nissuers. \n(ii) The eligible organization must provide either a copy of the self-certification to each \nissuer providing coverage in connection with the plan or a notice to the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that it is an eligible organization and of its objection \nas described in 45 CFR 147.132 to coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services. \n(A)  When a self-certification is provided directly to an issuer, the issuer has sole \nresponsibility for providing such coverage in accordance with § 54.9815-2713. \n(B)  When a notice is provided to the Secretary of the Department Health and Human \nServices, the notice must include the name of the eligible organization; a statement that it objects \nas described in 45 CFR 147.132 to coverage of some or all contraceptive services (including an \nidentification of the subset of contraceptive services to which coverage the eligible organization \nobjects, if applicable) but that it would like to elect the optional accommodation process; the plan \nname and type (that is, whether it is a student health insurance plan within the meaning of 45 \nCFR 147.145(a) or a church plan within the meaning of section 3(33) of ERISA); and the name \nand contact information for any of the plan’s health insurance issuers.  If there is a change in any \nof the information required to be included in the notice, the eligible organization must provide \nupdated information to the Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services for the \noptional accommodation process to remain in effect.  The Department of Health and Human \nServices will send a separate notification to each of the plan’s health insurance issuers informing \nthe issuer that the Secretary of the Department Health and Human Services has received a notice \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 144 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     143  \n \nunder paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and describing the obligations of the issuer under this \nsection. \n(2)  If an issuer receives a copy of the self-certification from an eligible organization or \nthe notification from the Department of Health and Human Services as described in paragraph \n(c)(2)(ii) of this section and does not have its own objection as described in 45 CFR 147.132 to \nproviding the contraceptive services to which the eligible organization objects, then the issuer \nwill provide payments for contraceptive services as follows— \n(i)  The issuer must expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health \ninsurance coverage provided in connection with the group health plan and provide separate \npayments for any contraceptive services required to be covered under § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) \nfor plan participants and beneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the plan. \n(ii)  With respect to payments for contraceptive services, the issuer may not impose any \ncost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any \npremium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible \norganization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.  The issuer must \nsegregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from the monies used to \nprovide payments for contraceptive services.  The issuer must provide payments for \ncontraceptive services in a manner that is consistent with the requirements under sections 2706, \n2709, 2711, 2713, 2719, and 2719A of the PHS Act, as incorporated into section 9815 of the \nPHS Act.  If the group health plan of the eligible organization provides coverage for some but \nnot all of any contraceptive services required to be covered under § 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv), the \nissuer is required to provide payments only for those contraceptive services for which the group \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 145 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     144  \n \nhealth plan does not provide coverage.  However, the issuer may provide payments for all \ncontraceptive services, at the issuer’s option. \n(3)  A health insurance issuer may not require any documentation other than a copy of the \nself-certification from the eligible organization or the notification from the Department of Health \nand Human Services described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.   \n(d)  Notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services - self-insured \nand insured group health plans.  For each plan year to which the optional accommodation in \nparagraph (b) or (c) of this section is to apply, a third party administrator required to provide or \narrange payments for contraceptive services pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and an \nissuer required to provide payments for contraceptive services pursuant to paragraph (c) of this \nsection, must provide to plan participants and beneficiaries written notice of the availability of \nseparate payments for contraceptive services contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), but \nseparate from, any application materials distributed in connection with enrollment (or re-\nenrollment) in group health coverage that is effective beginning on the first day of each \napplicable plan year.  The notice must specify that the eligible organization does not administer \nor fund contraceptive benefits, but that the third party administrator or issuer, as applicable, \nprovides or arranges separate payments for contraceptive services, and must provide contact \ninformation for questions and complaints.  The following model language, or substantially \nsimilar language, may be used to satisfy the notice requirement of this paragraph (d): “Your \nemployer has certified that your group health plan qualifies for an accommodation with respect \nto the Federal requirement to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive \nservices for women, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing.  This means \nthat your employer will not contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage. Instead, \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 146 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     145  \n \n[name of third party administrator/health insurance issuer] will provide or arrange separate \npayments for contraceptive services that you use, without cost sharing and at no other cost, for so \nlong as you are enrolled in your group health plan.  Your employer will not administer or fund \nthese payments. If you have any questions about this notice, contact [contact information for \nthird party administrator/health insurance issuer].” \n(e)  Definition.  For the purposes of this section, reference to “contraceptive” services, \nbenefits, or coverage includes contraceptive or sterilization items, procedures, or services, or \nrelated patient education or counseling, to the extent specified for purposes of § 54.9815-\n2713(a)(1)(iv). \n(f)  Severability.  Any provision of this section held to be invalid or unenforceable by its \nterms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, shall be construed so as to continue to give \nmaximum effect to the provision permitted by law, unless such holding shall be one of utter \ninvalidity or unenforceability, in which event the provision shall be severable from this section \nand shall not affect the remainder thereof or the application of the provision to persons not \nsimilarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances. \n(g)  Expiration date.

A group \nhealth plan established or maintained by an eligible organization that provides benefits through \none or more group health insurance issuers may voluntarily elect an optional accommodation \nunder which its health insurance issuer(s) will provide payments for all or a subset of \ncontraceptive services for one or more plan years.  To invoke the optional accommodation \nprocess: \n(i)  The eligible organization or its plan must contract with one or more health insurance \nissuers. \n(ii)  The eligible organization must provide either a copy of the self-certification to each \nissuer providing coverage in connection with the plan or a notice to the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services that it is an eligible organization and of its objection \nas described in 45 CFR 147.132 to coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services. \n(A) When a self-certification is provided directly to an issuer, the issuer has sole \nresponsibility for providing such coverage in accordance with § 2590.715-2713.  \n(B)  When a notice is provided to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, the notice must include the name of the eligible organization; a statement that it objects \nas described in 45 CFR 147.132 to coverage of some or all contraceptive services (including an \nidentification of the subset of contraceptive services to which coverage the eligible organization \nobjects, if applicable) but that it would like to elect the optional accommodation process; the plan \nname and type (that is, whether it is a student health insurance plan within the meaning of 45 \nCFR 147.145(a) or a church plan within the meaning of section 3(33) of ERISA); and the name \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 153 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     152  \n \nand contact information for any of the plan’s health insurance issuers.  If there is a change in any \nof the information required to be included in the notice, the eligible organization must provide \nupdated information to the Secretary of Department Health and Human Services for the optional \naccommodation process to remain in effect.  The Department of Health and Human Services will \nsend a separate notification to each of the plan’s health insurance issuers informing the issuer \nthat the Secretary of Health and Human Services has received a notice under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) \nof this section and describing the obligations of the issuer under this section. \n(2)  If an issuer receives a copy of the self-certification from an eligible organization or \nthe notification from the Department of Health and Human Services as described in paragraph \n(c)(2)(ii) of this section and does not have its own objection as described in 45 CFR 147.132 to \nproviding the contraceptive services to which the eligible organization objects, then the issuer \nwill provide payments for contraceptive services as follows—   \n(i)  The issuer must expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health \ninsurance coverage provided in connection with the group health plan and provide separate \npayments for any contraceptive services required to be covered under § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) \nfor plan participants and beneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the plan. \n  (ii)  With respect to payments for contraceptive services, the issuer may not impose any \ncost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any \npremium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible \norganization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries. The issuer must \nsegregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from the monies used to \nprovide payments for contraceptive services. The issuer must provide payments for contraceptive \nservices in a manner that is consistent with the requirements under sections 2706, 2709, 2711, \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 154 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     153  \n \n2713, 2719, and 2719A of the PHS Act, as incorporated into section 715 of ERISA.  If the group \nhealth plan of the eligible organization provides coverage for some but not all of any \ncontraceptive services required to be covered under § 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), the issuer is \nrequired to provide payments only for those contraceptive services for which the group health \nplan does not provide coverage.  However, the issuer may provide payments for all contraceptive \nservices, at the issuer’s option. \n(3)  A health insurance issuer may not require any documentation other than a copy of the \nself-certification from the eligible organization or the notification from the Department of Health \nand Human Services described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.   \n(d)  Notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services - self-insured \nand insured group health plans.  For each plan year to which the optional accommodation in \nparagraph (b) or (c) of this section is to apply, a third party administrator required to provide or \narrange payments for contraceptive services pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and an \nissuer required to provide payments for contraceptive services pursuant to paragraph (c) of this \nsection, must provide to plan participants and beneficiaries written notice of the availability of \nseparate payments for contraceptive services contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), but \nseparate from, any application materials distributed in connection with enrollment (or re-\nenrollment) in group health coverage that is effective beginning on the first day of each \napplicable plan year.  The notice must specify that the eligible organization does not administer \nor fund contraceptive benefits, but that the third party administrator or issuer, as applicable, \nprovides or arranges separate payments for contraceptive services, and must provide contact \ninformation for questions and complaints.  The following model language, or substantially \nsimilar language, may be used to satisfy the notice requirement of this paragraph (d): “Your \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 155 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     154  \n \nemployer has certified that your group health plan qualifies for an accommodation with respect \nto the Federal requirement to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive \nservices for women, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing.

In the case of student health insurance coverage, this section is applicable \nin a manner comparable to its applicability to group health insurance coverage provided in \nconnection with a group health plan established or maintained by a plan sponsor that is an \nemployer, and references to “plan participants and beneficiaries” will be interpreted as references \nto student enrollees and their covered dependents; and \n \nExhibit A\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-1   Filed 01/02/18   Page 163 of 164\nCMS-9940-IFC     162  \n \n(iii)  A health insurance issuer offering group or individual insurance coverage to the \nextent the issuer objects as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.  Where a health \ninsurance issuer providing group health insurance coverage is exempt under this paragraph \n(a)(1)(iii), the plan remains subject to any requirement to provide coverage for contraceptive \nservices under Guidelines issued under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) unless it is also exempt from that \nrequirement.  \n(2)  The exemption of this paragraph (a) will apply to the extent that an entity described \nin paragraph (a)(1) of this section objects to its establishing, maintaining, providing, offering, or \narranging (as applicable) coverage, payments, or a plan that provides coverage or payments for \nsome or all contraceptive services, based on its sincerely held religious beliefs. \n(b)  Objecting individuals.

Background \nIn the context of legal requirements touching on certain sensitive health care issues—\nincluding health coverage of contraceptives—Congress has a consistent history of supporting \nconscience protections for moral convictions alongside protections for religious beliefs, \nincluding as part of its efforts to promote access to health services.1  Against that backdrop, \n                                                           \n1 See, for example, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7 (protecting individuals and health care entities from being required to provide \nor assist sterilizations, abortions, or other lawful health services if it would violate their “religious beliefs or moral \n \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 7 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     6  \n \nCongress granted the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a component of \nthe United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), discretion under the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act to specify that certain group health plans and health \ninsurance issuers shall cover, “with respect to women, such additional preventive care and \nscreenings … as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by” HRSA (the \n“Guidelines”).  Public Health Service Act section 2713(a)(4).  HRSA exercised that discretion \nunder the last Administration to require health coverage for, among other things, certain \ncontraceptive services,2 while the administering agencies—the Departments of Health and \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nconvictions”); 42 U.S.C. 238n (protecting individuals and entities that object to abortion); Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d) (Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act), Pub. L. No. 115-31 (protecting any “health care professional, a hospital, a provider-\nsponsored organization, a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any other kind of health care \nfacility, organization, or plan” in objecting to abortion for any reason); Id. at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808 (regarding \nany requirement of “the provision of contraceptive coverage by health insurance plans” in the District of Columbia, \n“it is the intent of Congress that any legislation enacted on such issue should include a ‘conscience clause’ which \nprovides exceptions for religious beliefs and moral convictions.”); Id. at Div. C, Title VII, Sec. 726(c) (Financial \nServices and General Government Appropriations Act) (protecting individuals who object to prescribing or \nproviding contraceptives contrary to their “religious beliefs or moral convictions”); Id. at Div. I, Title III \n(Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act) (protecting applicants for \nfamily planning funds based on their “religious or conscientious commitment to offer only natural family \nplanning”); 42 U.S.C. 290bb-36 (prohibiting the statutory section from being construed to require suicide related \ntreatment services for youth where the parents or legal guardians object based on “religious beliefs or moral \nobjections”); 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) (protecting against forced counseling or referrals in Medicare Choice, \nnow Medicare Advantage, managed care plans with respect to objections based on “moral or religious grounds”); 42 \nU.S.C. 1396a(w)(3) (ensuring particular Federal law does not infringe on “conscience” as protected in State law \nconcerning advance directives); 42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(b)(3) (protecting against forced counseling or referrals in \nMedicaid managed care plans with respect to objections based on “moral or religious grounds”); 42 U.S.C. 2996f(b) \n(protecting objection to abortion funding in legal services assistance grants based on “religious beliefs or moral \nconvictions”); 42 U.S.C. 14406 (protecting organizations and health providers from being required to inform or \ncounsel persons pertaining to assisted suicide); 42 U.S.C. 18023 (blocking any requirement that issuers or exchanges \nmust cover abortion); 42 U.S.C. 18113 (protecting health plans or health providers from being required to provide \nan item or service that helps cause assisted suicide); see also 8 U.S.C. 1182(g) (protecting vaccination objections by \n“aliens” due to “religious beliefs or moral convictions”); 18 U.S.C. 3597 (protecting objectors to participation in \nFederal executions based on “moral or religious convictions”); 20 U.S.C. 1688 (prohibiting sex discrimination law \nto be used to require assistance in abortion for any reason); 22 U.S.C. 7631(d) (protecting entities from being \nrequired to use HIV/AIDS funds contrary to their “religious or moral objection”). \n2 This document’s references to “contraception,” “contraceptive,” “contraceptive coverage,” or “contraceptive \nservices” generally includes contraceptives, sterilization, and related patient education and counseling, unless \notherwise indicated. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 8 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     7  \n \nHuman Services, Labor, and the Treasury (collectively, “the Departments”3), exercised both the \ndiscretion granted to HHS through HRSA, its component, in PHS Act section 2713(a)(4), and the \nauthority granted to the Departments as administering agencies ( 26 U.S.C. 9833; 29 U.S.C. \n1191c; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-92) to issue regulations to guide HRSA in carrying out that provision.  \nThrough rulemaking, including three interim final rules, the Departments exempted and \naccommodated certain religious objectors, but did not offer an exemption or accommodation to \nany group possessing non-religious moral objections to providing coverage for some or all \ncontraceptives.  Many individuals and entities challenged the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement and regulations (hereinafter, the “contraceptive Mandate,” or the “Mandate”) as \nbeing inconsistent with various legal protections.  These challenges included lawsuits brought by \nsome non-religious organizations with sincerely held moral convictions inconsistent with \nproviding coverage for some or all contraceptive services, and those cases continue to this day.  \nVarious public comments were also submitted asking the Departments to protect objections \nbased on moral convictions. \nThe Departments have recently exercised our discretion to reevaluate these exemptions \nand accommodations.  This evaluation includes consideration of various factors, such as: the \ninterests served by the existing Guidelines, regulations, and accommodation process4; the \nextensive litigation; Executive Order 13798, “Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty” \n(May 4, 2017); Congress’ history of providing protections for moral convictions alongside \nreligious beliefs regarding certain health services (including contraception, sterilization, and \n                                                           \n3 Note, however, that in sections under headings listing only two of the three Departments, the term “Departments” \ngenerally refers only to the two Departments listed in the heading. \n4 In this IFR, we generally use “accommodation” and “accommodation process” interchangeably. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 9 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     8  \n \nitems or services believed to involve abortion); the discretion afforded under PHS Act section \n2713(a)(4); the structure and intent of that provision in the broader context of section 2713 and \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; and the history of the regulatory process and \ncomments submitted in various requests for public comments (including in the Departments’ \n2016 Request for Information).  Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the \nDepartments published, contemporaneously with these interim final rules, companion interim \nfinal rules expanding exemptions to protect sincerely held religious beliefs in the context of the \ncontraceptive Mandate. \nIn light of these considerations, the Departments issue these interim final rules to better \nbalance the Government’s interest in promoting coverage for contraceptive and sterilization \nservices with the Government’s interests in providing conscience protections for individuals and \nentities with sincerely held moral convictions in certain health care contexts, and in minimizing \nburdens imposed by our regulation of the health insurance market. \nA.  The Affordable Care Act \nCollectively, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148), enacted \non March 23, 2010, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-\n152), enacted on March 30, 2010, are known as the Affordable Care Act.  In signing the \nAffordable Care Act, President Obama issued Executive Order 13535 (March 24, 2010), which \ndeclared that, “[u]nder the Act, longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience (such as the \nChurch Amendment, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7, and the Weldon Amendment, section 508(d)(1) of Public \nLaw 111-8) remain intact” and that “[n]umerous executive agencies have a role in ensuring that \nthese restrictions are enforced, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).” \nThose laws protect objections based on moral convictions in addition to religious beliefs. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 10 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     9  \n \nThe Affordable Care Act reorganizes, amends, and adds to the provisions of part A of \ntitle XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) relating to group health plans and health \ninsurance issuers in the group and individual markets.  In addition, the Affordable Care Act adds \nsection 715(a)(1) to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and section \n9815(a)(1) to the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to incorporate the provisions of part A of title \nXXVII of the PHS Act into ERISA and the Code, and thereby make them applicable to certain \ngroup health plans regulated under ERISA or the Code.  The sections of the PHS Act \nincorporated into ERISA and the Code are sections 2701 through 2728 of the PHS Act. \nThese interim final rules concern section 2713 of the PHS Act.  Where it applies, section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act requires coverage without cost sharing for “such additional” women’s \npreventive care and screenings “as provided for” and “supported by” guidelines developed by \nHRSA/HHS. The Congress did not specify any particular additional preventive care and \nscreenings with respect to women that HRSA could or should include in its Guidelines, nor did \nCongress indicate whether the Guidelines should include contraception and sterilization.   \nThe Departments have consistently interpreted section 2713(a)(4)’s of the PHS Act grant \nof authority to include broad discretion to decide the extent to which HRSA will provide for and \nsupport the coverage of additional women’s preventive care and screenings in the Guidelines.  In \nturn, the Departments have interpreted that discretion to include the ability to exempt entities \nfrom coverage requirements announced in HRSA’s Guidelines.  That interpretation is rooted in \nthe text of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, which allows HRSA to decide the extent to which \nthe Guidelines will provide for and support the coverage of additional women’s preventive care \nand screenings.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 11 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     10  \n \nAccordingly, the Departments have consistently interpreted section 2713(a)(4) of the \nPHS Act reference to “comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and \nServices Administration for purposes of this paragraph” to grant HRSA authority to develop \nsuch Guidelines.  And because the text refers to Guidelines “supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of this paragraph,” the Departments have consistently \ninterpreted that authority to afford HRSA broad discretion to consider the requirements of \ncoverage and cost-sharing in determining the nature and extent of preventive care and screenings \nrecommended in the guidelines.  (76 FR 46623).  As the Departments have noted, these \nGuidelines are different from “the other guidelines referenced in section 2713(a), which pre-\ndated the Affordable Care Act and were originally issued for purposes of identifying the non-\nbinding recommended care that providers should provide to patients.”  Id.  Guidelines developed \nas nonbinding recommendations for care implicate significantly different legal and policy \nconcerns than guidelines developed for a mandatory coverage requirement.  To guide HRSA in \nexercising the discretion afforded to it in section 2713(a)(4), the Departments have previously \npromulgated regulations defining the scope of permissible religious exemptions and \naccommodations for such guidelines.  (45 CFR 147.131).  The interim final rules set forth herein \nare a necessary and appropriate exercise of the authority delegated to the Departments as \nadministrators of the statutes.  (26 U.S.C. 9833; 29 U.S.C. 1191c; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-92).  \nOur interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act is confirmed by the Affordable \nCare Act’s statutory structure.  The Congress did not intend to require entirely uniform coverage \nof preventive services.  (76 FR 46623).  To the contrary, Congress carved out an exemption from \nsection 2713 for grandfathered plans.  This exemption is not applicable to many of the other \nprovisions in Title I of the Affordable Care Act—provisions previously referred to by the \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 12 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     11  \n \nDepartments as providing “particularly significant protections.” (75 FR 34540).  Those \nprovisions include:  section 2704, which prohibits preexisting condition exclusions or other \ndiscrimination based on health status in group health coverage; section 2708, which prohibits \nexcessive waiting periods (as of January 1, 2014); section 2711, which relates to lifetime limits; \nsection 2712, which prohibits rescissions of health insurance coverage; section 2714, which \nextends dependent coverage until age 26; and section 2718, which imposes a medical loss ratio \non health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets (for insured coverage), or \nrequires them to provide rebates to policyholders.  (75 FR 34538, 34540, 34542).  Consequently, \nof the 150 million nonelderly people in America with employer-sponsored health coverage, \napproximately 25.5 million are estimated to be enrolled in grandfathered plans not subject to \nsection 2713 of the PHS Act.5  As the Supreme Court observed, “there is no legal requirement \nthat grandfathered plans ever be phased out.”  Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. \n2751, 2764 n.10 (2014). \nThe Departments’ interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to permit HRSA to \nestablish exemptions from the Guidelines, and of the Departments’ own authority as \nadministering agencies to guide HRSA in establishing such exemptions, is also consistent with \nExecutive Order 13535.  That order, issued upon the signing of the Affordable Care Act, \nspecified that “longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience . . . remain intact,” including \nlaws that protect religious beliefs and moral convictions from certain requirements in the health \ncare context.  Although the text of Executive Order 13535 does not require the expanded \nexemptions issued in these interim final rules, the expanded exemptions are, as explained below, \n                                                           \n5 Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits, 2017 Annual \nSurvey,” available at http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-2017. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 13 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     12  \n \nconsistent with longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience regarding certain health matters, \nand are consistent with the intent that the Affordable Care Act would be implemented in \nconsideration of the protections set forth in those laws. \nB.  The Regulations Concerning Women’s Preventive Services \nOn July 19, 2010, the Departments issued interim final rules implementing section 2713 \nof the PHS Act (75 FR 41726).  Those interim final rules charged HRSA with developing the \nGuidelines authorized by section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act.  \n1.  The Institute of Medicine Report \nIn developing the Guidelines, HRSA relied on an independent report from the Institute of \nMedicine (IOM, now known as the National Academy of Medicine) on women’s preventive \nservices, issued on July 19, 2011, “Clinical Preventive Services for Women, Closing the Gaps” \n(IOM 2011).  The IOM’s report was funded by the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for \nPlanning and Evaluation, pursuant to a funding opportunity that charged the IOM to conduct a \nreview of effective preventive services to ensure women’s health and well-being.6  \nThe IOM made a number of recommendations with respect to women’s preventive \nservices.  As relevant here, the IOM recommended that the Guidelines cover the full range of \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, \nand patient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity.  Because FDA \nincludes in the category of “contraceptives” certain drugs and devices that may not only prevent \n                                                           \n6 Because section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act specifies that the HRSA Guidelines shall include preventive care and \nscreenings “with respect to women,” the Guidelines exclude services relating to a man’s reproductive capacity, such \nas vasectomies and condoms. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 14 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     13  \n \nconception (fertilization), but may also prevent implantation of an embryo,7 the IOM’s \nrecommendation included several contraceptive methods that many persons and organizations \nbelieve are abortifacient—that is, as causing early abortion—and which they conscientiously \noppose for that reason distinct from whether they also oppose contraception or sterilization.   \nOne of the 16 members of the IOM committee, Dr. Anthony LoSasso, a Professor at the \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, wrote a formal dissenting opinion.  He \nstated that the IOM committee did not have sufficient time to evaluate fully the evidence on \nwhether the use of preventive services beyond those encompassed by section 2713(a)(1) through \n(3) of the PHS Act leads to lower rates of disability or disease and increased rates of well-being, \nsuch that the IOM should recommend additional services to be included under Guidelines issued \nunder section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act.  He further stated that “the recommendations were \nmade without high quality, systematic evidence of the preventive nature of the services \nconsidered,” and that “the committee process for evaluation of the evidence lacked transparency \nand was largely subject to the preferences of the committee’s composition.  Troublingly, the \nprocess tended to result in a mix of objective and subjective determinations filtered through a \nlens of advocacy.”  He also raised concerns that the committee did not have time to develop a \nframework for determining whether coverage of any given preventive service leads to a \nreduction in healthcare expenditure.8  IOM 2011 at 231–32.  In its response to Dr. LoSasso, the \nother 15 committee members stated in part that “At the first committee meeting, it was agreed \n                                                           \n7 FDA’s guide “Birth Control: Medicines To Help You,” specifies that various approved contraceptives, including \nLevonorgestrel, Ulipristal Acetate, and IUDs, work mainly by preventing fertilization and “may also work . . . by \npreventing attachment (implantation) to the womb (uterus)” of a human embryo after fertilization. Available at \nhttps://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepublications/ucm313215.htm. \n8 The Departments do not relay these dissenting remarks as an endorsement of the remarks, but to describe the \nhistory of the Guidelines, which includes this part of the report that IOM provided to HRSA.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 15 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     14  \n \nthat cost considerations were outside the scope of the charge, and that the committee should not \nattempt to duplicate the disparate review processes used by other bodies, such as the USPSTF, \nACIP, and Bright Futures.  HHS, with input from this committee, may consider other factors \nincluding cost in its development of coverage decisions.” \n2.  HRSA’s 2011 Guidelines and the Departments’ Second Interim Final Rules \nOn August 1, 2011, HRSA released onto its website its Guidelines for women’s \npreventive services, adopting the recommendations of the IOM.  \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/  The Guidelines included coverage for all FDA-\napproved contraceptives, sterilization procedures, and related patient education and counseling \nfor women with reproductive capacity, as prescribed by a health care provider (hereinafter “the \nMandate”).  \nIn administering this Mandate, on August 1, 2011, the Departments promulgated interim \nfinal rules amending our 2010 interim final rules. (76 FR 46621) (2011 interim final rules).  The \n2011 interim final rules specified that HRSA has the authority to establish exemptions from the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement for certain group health plans established or maintained by \ncertain religious employers and for health insurance coverage provided in connection with such \nplans.9  The 2011 interim final rules only offered the exemption to a narrow scope of employers, \nand only if they were religious.  As the basis for adopting that limited definition of religious \nemployer, the 2011 interim final rules stated that they relied on the laws of some “States that \nexempt certain religious employers from having to comply with State law requirements to cover \ncontraceptive services.”  (76 FR 46623).  Several comments were submitted asking that the \n                                                           \n9 The 2011 amended interim final rules were issued and effective on August 1, 2011, and published in the Federal \nRegister on August 3, 2011. (76 FR 46621). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 16 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     15  \n \nexemption include those who object to contraceptive coverage based on non-religious moral \nconvictions, including pro-life, non-profit advocacy organizations.10  \n3.  The Departments’ Subsequent Rulemaking on the Accommodation and Third Interim Final \nRules  \nFinal regulations issued on February 10, 2012, adopted the definition of “religious \nemployer” in the 2011 interim final rules without modification (2012 final regulations).11 (77 FR \n8725).  The exemption did not require exempt employers to file any certification form or comply \nwith any other information collection process.  \nContemporaneously with the issuance of the 2012 final regulations, HHS—with the \nagreement of the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of the Treasury—issued \nguidance establishing a temporary safe harbor from enforcement of the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement by the Departments with respect to group health plans established or maintained by \ncertain nonprofit organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage (and the \ngroup health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans).12 The temporary safe \nharbor did not include nonprofit organizations that had an objection to contraceptives based on \n                                                           \n10 See, for example, Americans United for Life (“AUL”) Comment on CMA-9992-IFC2 at 10 (Nov. 1, 2011), \navailable at \nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=HHS-OS-2011-0023-59496. \n11 The 2012 final regulations were published on February 15, 2012 (77 FR 8725). \n12 Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers, Group Health Plans, and Group \nHealth Insurance Issuers with Respect to the Requirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing \nUnder section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, Section 715(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act, and Section 9815(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, issued on February 10, 2012, and reissued on \nAugust 15, 2012. Available at: http://www.lb7.uscourts.gov/documents/12cv3932.pdf. The guidance, as reissued on \nAugust 15, 2012, clarified, among other things, that plans that took some action before February 10, 2012, to try, \nwithout success, to exclude or limit contraceptive coverage were not precluded from eligibility for the safe harbor. \nThe temporary enforcement safe harbor was also available to insured student health insurance coverage arranged by \nnonprofit institutions of higher education with religious objections to contraceptive coverage that met the conditions \nset forth in the guidance. See final rule entitled “Student Health Insurance Coverage” published March 21, 2012 (77 \nFR 16457). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 17 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     16  \n \nmoral convictions but not religious beliefs, nor did it include for-profit entities of any kind.  The \nDepartments stated that, during the temporary safe harbor, the Departments would engage in \nrulemaking to achieve “two goals—providing contraceptive coverage without cost-sharing to \nindividuals who want it and accommodating non-exempted, nonprofit organizations’ religious \nobjections to covering contraceptive services.” (77 FR 8727). \nOn March 21, 2012, the Departments published an advance notice of proposed \nrulemaking (ANPRM) that described possible approaches to achieve those goals with respect to \nreligious nonprofit organizations, and solicited public comments on the same. (77 FR 16501). \nFollowing review of the comments on the ANPRM, the Departments published proposed \nregulations on February 6, 2013 (2013 NPRM) (78 FR 8456).  \nThe 2013 NPRM proposed to expand the definition of “religious employer” for purposes \nof the religious employer exemption.  Specifically, it proposed to require only that the religious \nemployer be organized and operate as a nonprofit entity and be referred to in section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, eliminating the requirements that a religious employer-- (1) \nhave the inculcation of religious values as its purpose; (2) primarily employ persons who share \nits religious tenets; and (3) primarily serve persons who share its religious tenets. The proposed \nexpanded definition still encompassed only religious entities. \nThe 2013 NPRM also proposed to create a compliance process, which it called an \naccommodation, for group health plans established, maintained, or arranged by certain eligible \nnonprofit organizations that fell outside the houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries covered \nby section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code (and, thus, outside of the religious employer \nexemption).  The 2013 NPRM proposed to define such eligible organizations as nonprofit \nentities that hold themselves out as religious, oppose providing coverage for certain \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 18 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     17  \n \ncontraceptive items on account of religious objections, and maintain a certification to this effect \nin their records.  The 2013 NPRM stated, without citing a supporting source, that employees of \neligible organizations “may be less likely than” employees of exempt houses of worship and \nintegrated auxiliaries to share their employer’s faith and opposition to contraception on religious \ngrounds.  (78 FR 8461).  The 2013 NPRM therefore proposed that, in the case of an insured \ngroup health plan established or maintained by an eligible organization, the health insurance \nissuer providing group health insurance coverage in connection with the plan would provide \ncontraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries without cost sharing, premium, fee, \nor other charge to plan participants or beneficiaries enrolled in the eligible organization’s plan—\nand without any cost to the eligible organization.13  In the case of a self-insured group health plan \nestablished or maintained by an eligible organization, the 2013 NPRM presented potential \napproaches under which the third party administrator of the plan would provide or arrange for \ncontraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries.  The proposed accommodation \nprocess was not to be offered to non-religious nonprofit organizations, nor to any for-profit \nentities.  Public comments again included the request that exemptions encompass objections to \ncontraceptive coverage based on moral convictions and not just based on religious beliefs.14  On \nAugust 15, 2012, the Departments extended our temporary safe harbor until the first plan year \nbeginning on or after August 1, 2013. \nThe Departments published final regulations on July 2, 2013 (July 2013 final regulations)  \n(78 FR 39869).  The July 2013 final regulations finalized the expansion of the exemption for \n                                                           \n13 The NPRM proposed to treat student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are \ninstitutions of higher education in a similar manner. \n14 See,for example, AUL Comment on CMS-9968-P at 5 (Apr. 8, 2013), available at \nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CMS-2012-0031-79115. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 19 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     18  \n \nhouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries.  Although some commenters had suggested \nthat the exemption be further expanded, the Departments declined to adopt that approach.  The \nJuly 2013 regulations stated that, because employees of objecting houses of worship and \nintegrated auxiliaries are relatively likely to oppose contraception, exempting those organizations \n“does not undermine the governmental interests furthered by the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement.” (78 FR 39874).  However; like the 2013 NPRM, the July 2013 regulations \nassumed that “[h]ouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive \ncoverage on religious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the \nsame faith who share the same objection” to contraceptives. Id. \nThe July 2013 regulation also finalized an accommodation for eligible organizations, \nwhich were then defined to include solely organizations that are religious.  Under the \naccommodation, an eligible organization was required to submit a self-certification to its group \nhealth insurance issuer or third party administrator, as applicable.  Upon receiving that self-\ncertification, the issuer or third party administrator would provide or arrange for payments for \nthe contraceptive services to the plan participants and beneficiaries enrolled in the eligible \norganization’s plan, without requiring any cost sharing on the part of plan participants and \nbeneficiaries and without cost to the eligible organization.  With respect to self-insured plans, the \nthird party administrators (or issuers they contracted with) could receive reimbursements by \nreducing user fee payments (to Federally facilitated Exchanges) by the amounts paid out for \ncontraceptive services under the accommodation, plus an allowance for certain administrative \ncosts, as long as the HHS Secretary requests and an authorizing exception under OMB Circular \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 20 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     19  \n \nNo. A-25R is in effect.15  With respect to fully insured group health plans, the issuer was \nexpected to bear the cost of such payments,16 and HHS intended to clarify in guidance that the \nissuer could treat those payments as an adjustment to claims costs for purposes of medical loss \nratio and risk corridor program calculations.  The Departments extended the temporary safe \nharbor again on June 20, 2013, to encompass plan years beginning on or after August 1, 2013, \nand before January 1, 2014.  \n4.  Litigation Over the Mandate and the Accommodation Process \nDuring the period when the Departments were publishing and modifying our regulations, \norganizations and individuals filed dozens of lawsuits challenging the Mandate.  Plaintiffs \nincluded religious nonprofit organizations, businesses run by religious families, individuals, and \nothers, including several non-religious organizations that opposed coverage of certain \ncontraceptives under the Mandate on the basis of non-religious moral convictions.  Religious for-\nprofit entities won various court decisions leading to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Burwell v. \nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc. 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014).  The Supreme Court ruled against the \nDepartments and held that, under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), the \nMandate could not be applied to the closely held for-profit corporations before the Court because \ntheir owners had religious objections to providing such coverage.17  \nOn August 27, 2014, the Departments simultaneously issued a third set of interim final \nrules (August 2014 interim final rules) (79 FR 51092), and a notice of proposed rulemaking \n                                                           \n15 See also 45 CFR 156.50. Under the regulations, if the third party administrator does not participate in a Federally-\nfacilitated Exchange as an issuer, it is permitted to contract with an insurer which does so participate, in order to \nobtain such reimbursement.  The total contraceptive user fee adjustment for the 2015 benefit year was $33 million. \n16 “[P]roviding payments for contraceptive services is cost neutral for issuers.” (78 FR 39877). \n17 The Supreme Court did not decide whether RFRA would apply to publicly traded for-profit corporations.  See 134 \nS. Ct. at 2774. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 21 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     20  \n \n(August 2014 proposed rules) (79 FR 51118).  The August 2014 interim final rules changed the \naccommodation process so that it could be initiated either by self-certification using EBSA Form \n700 or through a notice informing the Secretary of HHS that an eligible organization had \nreligious objections to coverage of all or a subset of contraceptive services.  (79 FR 51092). In \nresponse to Hobby Lobby, the August 2014 proposed rules extended the accommodation process \nto closely held for-profit entities with religious objections to contraceptive coverage, by \nincluding them in the definition of eligible organizations.  (79 FR 51118).  Neither the August \n2014 interim final rules nor the August 2014 proposed rules extended the exemption; neither \nadded a certification requirement for exempt entities; and neither encompassed objections based \non non-religious moral convictions.  \nOn July 14, 2015, the Departments finalized both the August 2014 interim final rules and \nthe August 2014 proposed rules in a set of final regulations (the July 2015 final regulations) (80 \nFR 41318).  (The July 2015 final regulations also encompassed issues related to other preventive \nservices coverage.)  The July 2015 final regulations allowed eligible organizations to submit a \nnotice to HHS as an alternative to submitting the EBSA Form 700, but specified that such notice \nmust include the eligible organization’s name and an expression of its religious objection, along \nwith the plan name, plan type, and name and contact information for any of the plan’s third party \nadministrators or health insurance issuers.  The Departments indicated that such information \nrepresents the minimum information necessary for us to administer the accommodation process.  \nMeanwhile, a second series of legal challenges were filed by religious nonprofit \norganizations that stated the accommodation impermissibly burdened their religious beliefs \nbecause it utilized their health plans to provide services to which they objected on religious \ngrounds, and it required them to submit a self-certification or notice.  On November 6, 2015, the \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 22 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     21  \n \nU.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in seven similar cases under the title of a filing from the \nThird Circuit, Zubik v. Burwell.  On May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a per curiam \nopinion in Zubik, vacating the judgments of the Courts of Appeals—most of which had ruled in \nthe Departments’ favor—and remanding the cases “in light of the substantial clarification and \nrefinement in the positions of the parties” that had been filed in supplemental briefs. 136 S. Ct. \n1557, 1560 (2016).  The Court stated that it anticipated that, on remand, the Courts of Appeals \nwould “allow the parties sufficient time to resolve any outstanding issues between them.”  Id.  \nThe Court also specified that “the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on petitioners \nfor failure to provide the relevant notice” while the cases remained pending. Id. at 1561.   \nAfter remand, as indicated by the Departments in court filings, meetings were held \nbetween attorneys for the Government and for the plaintiffs in those cases.  The Departments \nalso issued a Request for Information (“RFI”) on July 26, 2016, seeking public comment on \noptions for modifying the accommodation process in light of the supplemental briefing in Zubik \nand the Supreme Court’s remand order.  (81 FR 47741).  Public comments were submitted in \nresponse to the RFI, during a comment period that closed on September 20, 2016.  Those \ncomments included the request that the exemption be expanded to include those who oppose the \nMandate for either religious “or moral” reasons, consistent with various state laws (such as in \nConnecticut or Missouri) that protect objections to contraceptive coverage based on moral \nconvictions.18 \n                                                           \n18 See, for example, https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-54142; see also \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-54218 and \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-46220. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 23 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     22  \n \nBeginning in 2015, lawsuits challenging the Mandate were also filed by various non-\nreligious organizations with moral objections to contraceptive coverage.  These organizations \nasserted that they believe some methods classified by FDA as contraceptives may have an \nabortifacient effect and therefore, in their view, are morally equivalent to abortion.  These \norganizations have neither received an exemption from the Mandate nor do they qualify for the \naccommodation.  For example, the organization that since 1974 has sponsored the annual March \nfor Life in Washington, D.C. (March for Life), filed a complaint claiming that the Mandate \nviolated the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and \nwas arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  Citing, for \nexample, (77 FR 8727), March for Life argued that the Departments’ stated interests behind the \nMandate were only advanced among women who “want” the coverage so as to prevent \n“unintended” pregnancy.  March for Life contended that because it only hires employees who \npublicly advocate against abortion, including what they regard as abortifacient contraceptive \nitems, the Departments’ interests were not rationally advanced by imposing the Mandate upon it \nand its employees.  Accordingly, March for Life contended that applying the Mandate to it (and \nother similarly situated organizations) lacked a rational basis and therefore doing so was \narbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.  March for Life further contended that because \nthe Departments concluded the government’s interests were not undermined by exempting \nhouses of worship and integrated auxiliaries (based on our assumption that such entities are \nrelatively more likely than other religious nonprofits to have employees that share their views \nagainst contraception), applying the Mandate to March for Life or similar organizations that \ndefinitively hire only employees who oppose certain contraceptives lacked a rational basis and \ntherefore violated their right of equal protection under the Due Process Clause.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 24 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     23  \n \nMarch for Life’s employees, who stated they were personally religious (although \npersonal religiosity was not a condition of their employment), also sued as co-plaintiffs.  They \ncontended that the Mandate violates their rights under RFRA by making it impossible for them \nto obtain health insurance consistent with their religious beliefs, either from the plan March for \nLife wanted to offer them, or in the individual market, because the Departments offered no \nexemptions in either circumstance.  Another non-religious nonprofit organization that opposed \nthe Mandate’s requirement to provide certain contraceptive coverage on moral grounds also filed \na lawsuit challenging the Mandate. Real Alternatives, Inc. v. Burwell, 150 F. Supp. 3d 419 (M.D. \nPa. 2015). \nChallenges by non-religious nonprofit organizations led to conflicting opinions among \nthe Federal courts.  A district court agreed with the March for Life plaintiffs on the \norganization’s equal protection claim and the employees’ RFRA claims (not specifically ruling \non the APA claim), and issued a permanent injunction against the Departments that is still in \nplace. March for Life v. Burwell, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116 (D.D.C. 2015).  The appeal in March for \nLife is pending and has been stayed since early 2016.  In another case, Federal district and \nappellate courts in Pennsylvania disagreed with the reasoning from March for Life and ruled \nagainst claims brought by a similarly non-religious nonprofit employer and its religious \nemployees.  Real Alternatives, 150 F. Supp. 3d 419, affirmed by 867 F.3d 338 (3d Cir. 2017). \nOne member of the appeals court panel in Real Alternatives dissented in part, stating he would \nhave ruled in favor of the individual employee plaintiffs under RFRA. Id. at *18.   \nOn December 20, 2016, HRSA updated the Guidelines via its website, \nhttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines2016/index.html.  HRSA announced that, for plans \nsubject to the Guidelines, the updated Guidelines would apply to the first plan year beginning \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 25 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     24  \n \nafter December 20, 2017.  Among other changes, the updated Guidelines specified that the \nrequired contraceptive coverage includes follow-up care (for example, management and \nevaluation, as well as changes to, and removal or discontinuation of, the contraceptive method).  \nThey also specified, for the first time, that coverage should include instruction in fertility \nawareness-based methods for women desiring an alternative method of family planning. HRSA \nstated that, with the input of a committee operating under a cooperative agreement, HRSA would \nreview and periodically update the Women’s Preventive Services’ Guidelines.  The updated \nGuidelines did not alter the religious employer exemption or accommodation process, nor did \nthey extend the exemption or accommodation process to organizations or individuals that oppose \ncertain forms of contraception (and coverage thereof) on moral grounds. \nOn January 9, 2017, the Departments issued a document entitled, “FAQs About \nAffordable Care Act Implementation Part 36.”19  The FAQ stated that, after reviewing comments \nsubmitted in response to the 2016 RFI and considering various options, the Departments could \nnot find a way at that time to amend the accommodation so as to satisfy objecting eligible \norganizations while pursuing the Departments’ policy goals.  The Departments did not adopt the \napproach requested by certain commenters, cited above, to expand the exemption to include \nthose who oppose the Mandate for moral reasons. \nOn May 4, 2017, the President issued Executive Order 13798, “Promoting Free Speech \nand Religious Liberty.” Section 3 of that order declares, “Conscience Protections with Respect to \nPreventive-Care Mandate.  The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the \n                                                           \n19 Available at: https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-\n36.pdf and https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/Downloads/ACA-FAQs-Part36_1-9-17-\nFinal.pdf. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 26 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     25  \n \nSecretary of Health and Human Services shall consider issuing amended regulations, consistent \nwith applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate \npromulgated under section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42, United States Code.” \nII. Expanded Exemptions and Accommodations for Moral Convictions  \nThese interim final rules incorporate conscience protections into the contraceptive \nMandate.  They do so in part to bring the Mandate into conformity with Congress’s long history \nof providing or supporting conscience protections in the regulation of sensitive health-care \nissues, cognizant that Congress neither required the Departments to impose the Mandate nor \nprohibited them from providing conscience protections if they did so. Specifically, these interim \nfinal rules expand exemptions to the contraceptive Mandate to protect certain entities and \nindividuals that object to coverage of some or all contraceptives based on sincerely held moral \nconvictions but not religious beliefs, and these rules make those exempt entities eligible for \naccommodations concerning the same Mandate.  \nA.  Discretion to Provide Exemptions under Section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act and the \nAffordable Care Act \nThe Departments have consistently interpreted HRSA’s authority under section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to allow for exemptions and accommodations to the contraceptive \nMandate for certain objecting organizations.  Section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act gives HRSA \ndiscretion to decide whether and in what circumstances it will support Guidelines providing for \nadditional women’s preventive services coverage.  That authority includes HRSA’s discretion to \ninclude contraceptive coverage in those Guidelines, but the Congress did not specify whether or \nto what extent HRSA should do so.  Therefore, section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act allows HRSA \nto not apply the Guidelines to certain plans of entities or individuals with religious or moral \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 27 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     26  \n \nobjections to contraceptive coverage, and by not applying the Guidelines to them, to exempt \nthose entities from the Mandate.  These rules are a necessary and appropriate exercise of the \nauthority of HHS, of which HRSA is a component, and of the authority delegated to the \nDepartments collectively as administrators of the statutes.  (26 U.S.C. 9833;  29 U.S.C. 1191c; \n42 U.S.C. 300gg-92). \nOur protection of conscience in these interim final rules is consistent with the structure \nand intent of the Affordable Care Act.  The Affordable Care Act refrains from applying section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to millions of women in grandfathered plans.  In contrast, we \nanticipate that conscientious exemptions to the Mandate will impact a much smaller number of \nwomen. President Obama emphasized in signing the Affordable Care Act that “longstanding \nFederal law to protect conscience”—laws with conscience protections encompassing moral (as \nwell as religious) objections—specifically including (but not limited to) the Church Amendments \n(42 U.S.C. 300a-7), “remain intact.” Executive Order 13535.  Nothing in the Affordable Care \nAct suggests Congress’ intent to deviate from its long history, discussed below, of protecting \nmoral convictions in particular health care contexts.  The Departments’ implementation of \nsection 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act with respect to contraceptive coverage is a context similar to \nthose encompassed by many other health care conscience protections provided or supported by \nCongress.  This Mandate concerns contraception and sterilization services, including items \nbelieved by some citizens to have an abortifacient effect—that is, to cause the destruction of a \nhuman life at an early stage of embryonic development.  These are highly sensitive issues in the \nhistory of health care regulation and have long been shielded by conscience protections in the \nlaws of the United States. \nB.  Congress’ History of Providing Exemptions for Moral Convictions \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 28 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     27  \n \nIn deciding the most appropriate way to exercise our discretion in this context, the \nDepartments draw on nearly 50 years of statutory law and Supreme Court precedent discussing \nthe protection of moral convictions in certain circumstances—particularly in the context of \nhealth care and health insurance coverage.  Congress very recently expressed its intent on the \nmatter of Government-mandated contraceptive coverage when it declared, with respect to the \npossibility that the District of Columbia would require contraceptive coverage, that “it is the \nintent of Congress that any legislation enacted on such issue should include a ‘conscience clause’ \nwhich provides exceptions for religious beliefs and moral convictions.”  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2017, Division C, Title VIII, Sec. 808, Pub. L. No. 115-31 (May 5, 2017). \nIn support of these interim final rules, we consider it significant that Congress’ most recent \nstatement on the prospect of Government mandated contraceptive coverage specifically intends \nthat a conscience clause be included to protect moral convictions.  \nThe many statutes listed in Section I-Background under footnote 1, which show \nCongress’ consistent protection of moral convictions alongside religious beliefs in the Federal \nregulation of health care, includes laws such as the 1973 Church Amendments, which we discuss \nat length below, all the way to the 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act discussed above.  \nNotably among those laws, the Congress has enacted protections for health plans or health care \norganizations in Medicaid or Medicare Advantage to object “on moral or religious grounds” to \nproviding coverage of certain counseling or referral services. 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) \n(protecting against forced counseling or referrals in Medicare Choice, now Medicare Advantage, \nmanaged care plans with respect to objections based on “moral or religious grounds”); 42 U.S.C. \n1396u-2(b)(3) (protecting against forced counseling or referrals in Medicaid managed care plans \nwith respect to objections based on “moral or religious grounds”).  The Congress has also \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 29 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     28  \n \nprotected individuals who object to prescribing or providing contraceptives contrary to their \n“religious beliefs or moral convictions.” Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Division C, \nTitle VII, Sec. 726(c) (Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act), Pub. L. \nNo. 115-31.  \nC.  The Church Amendments’ Protection of Moral Convictions \nOne of the most important and well-established federal statutes respecting conscientious \nobjections in specific health care contexts was enacted over the course of several years beginning \nin 1973, initially as a response to court decisions raising the prospect that entities or individuals \nmight be required to facilitate abortions or sterilizations.  These sections of the United States \nCode are known as the Church Amendments, named after their primary sponsor Senator Frank \nChurch (D-Idaho).  The Church Amendments specifically provide conscience protections based \non sincerely held moral convictions.  Among other things, the amendments protect the recipients \nof certain Federal health funds from being required to perform, assist, or make their facilities \navailable for abortions or sterilizations if they object “on the basis of religious beliefs or moral \nconvictions,” and they prohibit recipients of certain Federal health funds from discriminating \nagainst any personnel “because he refused to perform or assist in the performance of such a \nprocedure or abortion on the grounds that his performance or assistance in the performance of \nthe procedure or abortion would be contrary to his religious beliefs or moral convictions” (42 \nU.S.C. 300a-7(b), (c)(1)).  Later additions to the Church Amendments protect other \nconscientious objections, including some objections on the basis of moral conviction to “any \nlawful health service,” or to “any part of a health service program.” (42 U.S.C. 300a-7(c)(2), \n(d)). In contexts covered by those sections of the Church Amendments, the provision or coverage \nof certain contraceptives, depending on the circumstances, could constitute “any lawful health \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 30 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     29  \n \nservice” or a “part of a health service program.” As such, the protections provided by those \nprovisions of the Church Amendments would encompass moral objections to contraceptive \nservices or coverage.  \nThe Church Amendments were enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in \nRoe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).  Even though the Court in Roe required abortion to be legal \nin certain circumstances, Roe did not include, within that right, the requirement that other \ncitizens must facilitate its exercise.  Thus, Roe favorably quoted the proceedings of the American \nMedical Association House of Delegates 220 (June 1970), which declared “Neither physician, \nhospital, nor hospital personnel shall be required to perform any act violative of personally-held \nmoral principles.” 410 U.S. at 144 & n.38 (1973).  Likewise in Roe’s companion case, Doe v. \nBolton, the Court observed that, under State law, “a physician or any other employee has the \nright to refrain, for moral or religious reasons, from participating in the abortion procedure.” 410 \nU.S. 179, 197–98 (1973).  The Court said that these conscience provisions “obviously . . . afford \nappropriate protection.” Id. at 198.  As an Arizona court later put it, “a woman’s right to an \nabortion or to contraception does not compel a private person or entity to facilitate either.” \nPlanned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Am. Ass’n of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 257 \nP.3d 181, 196 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011). \nThe Congressional Record contains relevant discussions that occurred when the \nprotection for moral convictions was first proposed in the Church Amendments.  When Senator \nChurch introduced the first of those amendments in 1973, he cited not only Roe v. Wade but also \nan instance where a Federal court had ordered a Catholic hospital to perform sterilizations. 119 \nCongr. Rec. S5717–18 (Mar. 27, 1973).  After his opening remarks, Senator Adlai Stevenson III \n(D-IL) rose to ask that the amendment be changed to specify that it also protects objections to \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 31 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     30  \n \nabortion and sterilization based on moral convictions on the same terms as it protects objections \nbased on religious beliefs.  The following excerpt of the Congressional Record is particularly \nrelevant to this discussion: \nMr. STEVENSON. Mr. President, first of all I commend the Senator from Idaho for \nbringing this matter to the attention of the Senate. I ask the Senator a question. \nOne need not be of the Catholic faith or any other religious faith to feel deeply \nabout the worth of human life. The protections afforded by this amendment run only to \nthose whose religious beliefs would be offended by the necessity of performing or \nparticipating in the performance of certain medical procedures; others, for moral reasons, \nnot necessarily for any religious belief, can feel equally as strong about human life. They \ntoo can revere human life. \nAs mortals, we cannot with confidence say, when life begins. But whether it is \nlife, or the potentiality of life, our moral convictions as well as our religious beliefs, \nwarrant protection from this intrusion by the Government. Would, therefore, the Senator \ninclude moral convictions? \nWould the Senator consider an amendment on page 2, line 18 which would add to \nreligious beliefs, the words “or moral”? \nMr. CHURCH. I would suggest to the Senator that perhaps his objective could be more \nclearly stated if the words “or moral conviction” were added after “religious belief.” I \nthink that the Supreme Court in considering the protection we give religious beliefs has \ngiven comparable treatment to deeply held moral convictions. I would not be averse to \namending the language of the amendment in such a manner. It is consistent with the \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 32 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     31  \n \ngeneral purpose. I see no reason why a deeply held moral conviction ought not be given \nthe same treatment as a religious belief. \nMr. STEVENSON. The Senator's suggestion is well taken. I thank him. \n119 Congr. Rec. S5717–18.  \nAs the debate proceeded, Senator Church went on to quote Doe v. Bolton’s reliance on a \nGeorgia statute that stated “a physician or any other employee has the right to refrain, for moral \nor religious reasons, from participating in the abortion procedure.” 119 Congr. Rec. at S5722 \n(quoting 410 U.S. at 197–98). Senator Church added, “I see no reason why the amendment ought \nnot also to cover doctors and nurses who have strong moral convictions against these particular \noperations.” Id.  Considering the scope of the protections, Senator Gaylord Nelson (D-WI) asked \nwhether, “if a hospital board, or whatever the ruling agency for the hospital was, a governing \nagency or otherwise, just capriciously—and not upon the religious or moral questions at all—\nsimply said, ‘We are not going to bother with this kind of procedure in this hospital,’ would the \npending amendment permit that?” 119 Congr. Rec. at S5723. Senator Church responded that the \namendment would not encompass such an objection. Id.  \nSenator James L. Buckley (C-NY), speaking in support of the amendment, added the \nfollowing perspective: \nMr. BUCKLEY. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Idaho for proposing this \nmost important and timely amendment. It is timely in the first instance because the \nattempt has already been made to compel the performance of abortion and sterilization \noperations on the part of those who are fundamentally opposed to such procedures. And it \nis timely also because the recent Supreme Court decisions will likely unleash a series of \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 33 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     32  \n \ncourt actions across the United States to try to impose the personal preferences of the \nmajority of the Supreme Court on the totality of the Nation.  \nI believe it is ironic that we should have this debate at all. Who would have \npredicted a year or two ago that we would have to guard against even the possibility that \nsomeone might be free [sic]20 to participate in an abortion or sterilization against his will? \nSuch an idea is repugnant to our political tradition. This is a Nation which has always \nbeen concerned with the right of conscience. It is the right of conscience which is \nprotected in our draft laws. It is the right of conscience which the Supreme Court has \nquite properly expanded not only to embrace those young men who, because of the tenets \nof a particular faith, believe they cannot kill another man, but also those who because of \ntheir own deepest moral convictions are so persuaded. \nI am delighted that the Senator from Idaho has amended his language to include \nthe words “moral conviction,” because, of course, we know that this is not a matter of \nconcern to any one religious body to the exclusion of all others, or even to men who \nbelieve in a God to the exclusion of all others. It has been a traditional concept in our \nsociety from the earliest times that the right of conscience, like the paramount right to life \nfrom which it is derived, is sacred. \n119 Congr. Rec. at S5723.  \nIn support of the same protections when they were debated in the U.S. House, \nRepresentative Margaret Heckler (R-MA)21 likewise observed that “the right of conscience has \nlong been recognized in the parallel situation in which the individual’s right to conscientious \n                                                           \n20 The Senator might have meant “[forced] . . . against his will.” \n21 Rep. Heckler later served as the 15th Secretary of HHS, from March 1983 to December 1985. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 34 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     33  \n \nobjector status in our selective service system has been protected” and “expanded by the \nSupreme Court to include moral conviction as well as formal religious belief.” 119 Congr. Rec. \nH4148–49 (May 31, 1973). Rep. Heckler added, “We are concerned here only with the right of \nmoral conscience, which has always been a part of our national tradition.” Id. at 4149. \nThese first of the Church Amendments, codified at 42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b) and (c)(1), \npassed the House 372–1, and were approved by the Senate 94–0. 119 Congr. Rec. at H4149; 119 \nCongr. Rec. S10405 (June 5, 1973). The subsequently adopted provisions that comprise the \nChurch Amendments similarly extend protection to those organizations and individuals who \nobject to the provision of certain services on the basis of their moral convictions. And, as noted \nabove, subsequent statutes add protections for moral objections in many other situations. These \ninclude, for example:  \n Protections for individuals and entities that object to abortion: see 42 U.S.C. 238n; 42 \nU.S.C. 18023; 42 U.S.C. 2996f(b); and Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, \nTitle V, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-31;  \n Protections for entities and individuals that object to providing or covering \ncontraceptives: see id. at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808; id. at Div. C, Title VII, Sec. 726(c) \n(Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act); and id.at Div. I, Title \nIII; and \n Protections for entities and individuals that object to performing, assisting, counseling, or \nreferring as pertains to suicide, assisted suicide, or advance directives:  see 42 U.S.C. \n290bb-36; 42 U.S.C. 14406;  42 U.S.C. 18113; and 42 U.S.C. 1396a(w)(3). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 35 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     34  \n \nThe Departments believe that the intent behind Congress’ protection of moral convictions \nin certain health care contexts, especially to protect entities and individuals from governmental \ncoercion, supports our decision in these interim final rules to protect sincerely held moral \nconvictions from governmental compulsion threatened by the contraceptive Mandate.  \nD.  Court Precedents Relevant to These Expanded Exemptions \nThe legislative history of the protection of moral convictions in the first Church \nAmendments shows that Members of Congress saw the protection as being consistent with \nSupreme Court decisions.  Not only did Senator Church cite the abortion case Doe v. Bolton as a \nparallel instance of conscience protection, but he also spoke of the Supreme Court generally \ngiving “comparable treatment to deeply held moral convictions.” Both Senator Buckley and Rep. \nHeckler specifically cited the Supreme Court’s protection of moral convictions in laws governing \nmilitary service.  Those legislators appear to have been referencing cases such as Welsh v. \nUnited States, 398 U.S. 333 (1970), which the Supreme Court decided just 3 years earlier.  \nWelsh involved what is perhaps the Government’s paradigmatic compelling interest—the \nneed to defend the nation by military force.  The Court stated that, where the Government \nprotects objections to military service based on “religious training and belief,” that protection \nwould also extend to avowedly non-religious objections to war held with the same moral \nstrength. Id. at 343. The Court declared, “[i]f an individual deeply and sincerely holds beliefs \nthat are purely ethical or moral in source and content but that nevertheless impose upon him a \nduty of conscience to refrain from participating in any war at any time, those beliefs certainly \noccupy in the life of that individual ‘a place parallel to that filled by … God’ in traditionally \nreligious persons. Because his beliefs function as a religion in his life, such an individual is as \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 36 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     35  \n \nmuch entitled to a ‘religious’ conscientious objector exemption … as is someone who derives his \nconscientious opposition to war from traditional religious convictions.”  \nThe Departments look to the description of moral convictions in Welsh to help explain \nthe scope of the protection provided in these interim final rules.  Neither these interim final rules, \nnor the Church Amendments or other Federal health care conscience statutes, define “moral \nconvictions” (nor do they define “religious beliefs”).  But in issuing these interim final rules, we \nseek to use the same background understanding of that term that is reflected in the Congressional \nRecord in 1973, in which legislators referenced cases such as Welsh to support the addition of \nlanguage protecting moral convictions.  In protecting moral convictions parallel to religious \nbeliefs, Welsh describes moral convictions warranting such protection as ones:  (1) that the \n“individual deeply and sincerely holds”; (2) “that are purely ethical or moral in source and \ncontent; (3) “but that nevertheless impose upon him a duty”; (4) and that “certainly occupy in the \nlife of that individual a place parallel to that filled by … God’ in traditionally religious persons,” \nsuch that one could say “his beliefs function as a religion in his life.” (398 U.S. at 339–40).  As \nrecited above, Senators Church and Nelson agreed that protections for such moral convictions \nwould not encompass an objection that an individual or entity raises “capriciously.”  Instead, \nalong with the requirement that protected moral convictions must be “sincerely held,” this \nunderstanding cabins the protection of moral convictions in contexts where they occupy a place \nparallel to that filled by sincerely held religious beliefs in religious persons and organizations. \nIn the context of this particular Mandate, it is also worth noting that, in Hobby Lobby, \nJustice Ginsburg (joined, in this part of the opinion, by Justices Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor), \ncited Justice Harlan’s opinion in Welsh, 398 U.S. at 357–58, in support of her statement that \n“[s]eparating moral convictions from religious beliefs would be of questionable legitimacy.” 134 \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 37 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     36  \n \nS. Ct. at 2789 n.6.  In quoting this passage, the Departments do not mean to suggest that all laws \nprotecting only religious beliefs constitute an illegitimate “separat[ion]” of moral convictions, \nnor do we assert that moral convictions must always be protected alongside religious beliefs; we \nalso do not agree with Justice Harlan that distinguishing between religious and moral objections \nwould violate the Establishment Clause.  Instead, the Departments believe that, in the specific \nhealth care context implicated here, providing respect for moral convictions parallel to the \nrespect afforded to religious beliefs is appropriate, draws from long-standing Federal \nGovernment practice, and shares common ground with Congress’ intent in the Church \nAmendments and in later Federal conscience statutes that provide protections for moral \nconvictions alongside religious beliefs in other health care contexts. \nE.  Conscience Protections in Regulations and Among the States \nThe tradition of protecting moral convictions in certain health contexts is not limited to \nCongress. Multiple federal regulations protect objections based on moral convictions in such \ncontexts.22  Other federal regulations have also applied the principle of respecting moral \nconvictions alongside religious beliefs when they have determined that it is appropriate to do so \nin particular circumstances.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has consistently \nprotected “moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with \nthe strength of traditional religious views” alongside religious views under the “standard [] \n                                                           \n22 See, for example, 42 CFR 422.206 (declaring that the general Medicare Advantage rule “does not require the MA \nplan to cover, furnish, or pay for a particular counseling or referral service if the MA organization that offers the \nplan—(1) Objects to the provision of that service on moral or religious grounds.”); 42 CFR 438.102 (declaring that \ninformation requirements do not apply “if the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP objects to the service on moral or religious \ngrounds”); 48 CFR 1609.7001 (“health plan sponsoring organizations are not required to discuss treatment options \nthat they would not ordinarily discuss in their customary course of practice because such options are inconsistent \nwith their professional judgment or ethical, moral or religious beliefs.”); 48 CFR 352.270-9 (“Non-Discrimination \nfor Conscience” clause for organizations receiving HIV or Malaria relief funds). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 38 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     37  \n \ndeveloped in United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163 (1965) and [Welsh].”  (29 CFR 1605.1).  The \nDepartment of Justice has declared that, in cases of capital punishment, no officer or employee \nmay be required to attend or participate if doing so “is contrary to the moral or religious \nconvictions of the officer or employee, or if the employee is a medical professional who \nconsiders such participation or attendance contrary to medical ethics.”  (28 CFR 26.5).23 \nForty-five States have health care conscience protections covering objections to abortion, \nand several of those also cover sterilization or contraception.24  Most of those State laws protect \nobjections based on “moral,” “ethical,” or “conscientious” grounds in addition to “religious” \ngrounds.  Particularly in the case of abortion, some Federal and State conscience laws do not \nrequire any specified motive for the objection.  (42 U.S.C. 238n).  These various statutes and \nregulations reflect an important governmental interest in protecting moral convictions in \nappropriate health contexts.  \nThe contraceptive Mandate implicates that governmental interest.  Many persons and \nentities object to this Mandate in part because they consider some forms of FDA-approved \ncontraceptives to be abortifacients and morally equivalent to abortion due to the possibility that \nsome of the items may have the effect of preventing the implantation of a human embryo after \nfertilization.  Based on our knowledge from the litigation, all of the current litigants asserting \npurely non-religious objections share this view, and most of the religious litigants do as well. \n                                                           \n23 See also 18 CFR 214.11 (where a law enforcement agency (LEA) seeks assistance in the investigation or \nprosecution of trafficking of persons, the reasonableness of the LEA’s request will depend in part on “[c]ultural, \nreligious, or moral objections to the request”). \n24 According to the Guttmacher Institute, 45 states have conscience statutes pertaining to abortion (43 of which \ncover institutions), 18 have conscience statutes pertaining to sterilization (16 of which cover institutions), and 12 \nhave conscience statutes pertaining to contraception (8 of which cover institutions).  “Refusing to Provide Health \nServices” (June 1, 2017), available at https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/refusing-provide-health-\nservices. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 39 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     38  \n \nThe Supreme Court, in describing family business owners with religious objections, explained \nthat “[t]he owners of the businesses have religious objections to abortion, and according to their \nreligious beliefs the four contraceptive methods at issue are abortifacients.  If the owners comply \nwith the HHS mandate, they believe they will be facilitating abortions.” Hobby Lobby, 134 S. \nCt. at 2751.  Outside of the context of abortion, as cited above, Congress has also provided \nhealth care conscience protections pertaining to sterilization, contraception, and other health care \nservices and practices. \nF. Founding Principles \nThe Departments also look to guidance from the broader history of respect for conscience \nin the laws and founding principles of the United States.  Members of Congress specifically \nrelied on the American tradition of respect for conscience when they decided to protect moral \nconvictions in health care.  As quoted above, in supporting protecting conscience based on non-\nreligious moral convictions, Senator Buckley declared “[i]t has been a traditional concept in our \nsociety from the earliest times that the right of conscience, like the paramount right to life from \nwhich it is derived, is sacred.” Rep. Heckler similarly stated that “the right of moral conscience . \n. . has always been a part of our national tradition.”  This tradition is reflected, for example, in a \nletter President George Washington wrote saying that “[t]he Citizens of the United States of \nAmerica have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an \nenlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation.  All possess alike liberty of conscience \nand immunities of citizenship.”25  Thomas Jefferson similarly declared that “[n]o provision in \nour Constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience \n                                                           \n25 From George Washington to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island (Aug. 18, 1790), available at \nhttps://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-06-02-0135. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 40 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     39  \n \nagainst the enterprises of the civil authority.”26  Although these statements by Presidents \nWashington and Jefferson were spoken to religious congregations, and although religious and \nmoral conscience were tightly intertwined for the Founders, they both reflect a broad principle of \nrespect for conscience against government coercion. James Madison likewise called conscience \n“the most sacred of all property,” and proposed that the Bill of Rights should guarantee, in \naddition to protecting religious belief and worship, that “the full and equal rights of conscience \n[shall not] be in any manner, or on any pretext infringed.”27   \nThese Founding Era statements of general principle do not specify how they would be \napplied in a particular health care context.  We do not suggest that the specific protections \noffered in this rule would also be required or necessarily appropriate in any other context that \ndoes not raise the specific concerns implicated by this Mandate.  These interim final rules do not \naddress in any way how the Government would balance its interests with respect to other health \nservices not encompassed by the contraceptive Mandate.28  Instead we highlight this tradition of \nrespect for conscience from our Founding Era to provide background support for the \nDepartments’ decision to implement section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, while protecting \nconscience in the exercise of moral convictions. We believe that these interim final rules are \nconsistent both with the American tradition of respect for conscience and with Congress’ history \nof providing conscience protections in the kinds of health care matters involved in this Mandate.  \n                                                           \n26 Letter to the Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church at New London, Connecticut (February 4, 1809), \navailable at https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/99-01-02-9714.  \n27 James Madison, “Essay on Property” (March 29, 1792); First draft of the First Amendment, 1 Annals of Congress \n434 (June 8, 1789). \n28 As the Supreme Court stated in Hobby Lobby, the Court’s decision concerns only the contraceptive Mandate, and \nshould not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage mandates, for example, for vaccinations or blood \ntransfusions, must necessarily fail if they conflict with an employer’s religious beliefs. Nor does the Court’s opinion \nprovide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious (or moral) practice. 134 S. Ct. at \n2783. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 41 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     40  \n \nG.  Executive Orders Relevant to These Expanded Exemptions \nProtecting moral convictions, as set forth in the expanded exemptions and \naccommodations of these rules, is consistent with recent executive orders.  President Trump’s \nExecutive Order concerning this Mandate directed the Departments to consider providing \nprotections, not specifically for “religious” beliefs, but for “conscience.”  We interpret that term \nto include moral convictions and not just religious beliefs.  Likewise, President Trump’s first \nExecutive Order, EO 13765, declared that “the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n(Secretary) and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with \nauthorities and responsibilities under the [ACA] shall exercise all authority and discretion \navailable to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any \nprovision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, \ntax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, \npatients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical \ndevices, products, or medications.”  This Mandate imposes both a cost, fee, tax, or penalty, and a \nregulatory burden, on individuals and purchasers of health insurance that have moral convictions \nopposed to providing contraceptive coverage.  These interim final rules exercise the \nDepartments’ discretion to grant exemptions from the Mandate to reduce and relieve regulatory \nburdens and promote freedom in the health care market. \nH.  Litigation Concerning the Mandate \nThe sensitivity of certain health care matters makes it particularly important for the \nGovernment to tread carefully when engaging in regulation concerning those areas, and to \nrespect individuals and organizations whose moral convictions are burdened by Government \nregulations.  Providing conscience protections advances the Affordable Care Act’s goal of \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 42 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     41  \n \nexpanding health coverage among entities and individuals that might otherwise be reluctant to \nparticipate in the market.  For example, the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby declared that, if \nHHS requires owners of businesses to cover procedures that the owners “could not in good \nconscience” cover, such as abortion, “HHS would effectively exclude these people from full \nparticipation in the economic life of the Nation.” 134 S. Ct. at 2783.  That would be a serious \noutcome.  As demonstrated by litigation and public comments, various citizens sincerely hold \nmoral convictions, which are not necessarily religious, against providing or participating in \ncoverage of contraceptive items included in the Mandate, and some believe that some of those \nitems may cause early abortions.  The Departments wish to implement the contraceptive \ncoverage Guidelines issued under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act in a way that respects the \nmoral convictions of our citizens so that they are more free to engage in “full participation in the \neconomic life of the Nation.”  These expanded exemptions do so by removing an obstacle that \nmight otherwise lead entities or individuals with moral objections to contraceptive coverage to \nchoose not to sponsor or participate in health plans if they include such coverage. \nAmong the lawsuits challenging the Mandate, two have been filed based in part on non-\nreligious moral convictions.  In one case, the Departments are subject to a permanent injunction \nrequiring us to respect the non-religious moral objections of an employer. See March for Life v. \nBurwell, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116 (D.D.C. 2015).  In the other case, an appeals court recently \naffirmed a district court ruling that allows the previous regulations to be imposed in a way that \nviolates the moral convictions of a small nonprofit pro-life organization and its employees. See \nReal Alternatives, 2017 WL 3324690.  Our litigation of these cases has led to inconsistent court \nrulings, consumed substantial governmental resources, and created uncertainty for objecting \norganizations, issuers, third party administrators, and employees and beneficiaries.  The \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 43 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     42  \n \norganizations that have sued seeking a moral exemption have all adopted moral tenets opposed to \ncontraception and hire only employees who share this view.  It is reasonable to conclude that \nemployees of these organizations would therefore not benefit from the Mandate.  As a result, \nsubjecting this subset of organizations to the Mandate does not advance any governmental \ninterest.  The need to resolve this litigation and the potential concerns of similar entities, and our \nrequirement to comply with permanent injunctive relief currently imposed in March for Life, \nprovide substantial reasons for the Departments to protect moral convictions through these \ninterim final rules.  Even though, as discussed below, we assume the number of entities and \nindividuals that may seek exemption from the Mandate on the basis of moral convictions, as \nthese two sets of litigants did, will be small, we know from the litigation that it will not be zero. \nAs a result, the Departments have taken these types of objections into consideration in reviewing \nour regulations.  Having done so, we consider it appropriate to issue the protections set forth in \nthese interim final rules.  Just as Congress, in adopting the early provisions of the Church \nAmendments, viewed it as necessary and appropriate to protect those organizations and \nindividuals with objections to certain health care services on the basis of moral convictions, so \nwe, too, believe that “our moral convictions as well as our religious beliefs, warrant protection \nfrom this intrusion by the Government” in this situation. \nI.  The Departments’ Rebalancing of Government Interests \nFor additional discussion of the Government’s balance of interests concerning religious \nbeliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules, see the related document  \npublished by the Department elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.  There, we \nacknowledge that the Departments have changed the policies and interpretations we previously \nadopted with respect to the Mandate and the governmental interests that underlying it, and we \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 44 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     43  \n \nassert that we now believe the Government’s legitimate interests in providing for contraceptive \ncoverage do not require us to violate sincerely held religious beliefs while implementing the \nGuidelines.  For parallel reasons, the Departments believe Congress did not set forth—and we do \nnot possess—interests that require us to violate sincerely held moral convictions in the course of \ngenerally requiring contraceptive coverage.  These changes in policy are within the Departments’ \nauthority.  As the Supreme Court has acknowledged, “[a]gencies are free to change their existing \npolicies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.” Encino Motorcars, LLC \nv. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2016).  This “reasoned analysis” requirement does not \ndemand that an agency “demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy \nare better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the \nstatute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the \nconscious change of course adequately indicates.” United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. King, 200 \nF. Supp. 3d 163, 169–70 (D.D.C. 2016) (citing FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. \n502, 515 (2009)); see also New Edge Network, Inc. v. FCC, 461 F.3d 1105, 1112–13 (9th Cir. \n2006) (rejecting an argument that “an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is \nobligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when \nan agency does not act in the first instance”).29 \nThe Departments note that the exemptions created here, like the exemptions created by \nthe last Administration, do not burden third parties to a degree that counsels against providing \nthe exemptions.  In addition to the apparent fact that many entities with non-religious moral \n                                                           \n29 See also Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 863–64 (1984) (“The \nfact that the agency has adopted different definitions in different contexts adds force to the argument that the \ndefinition itself is flexible, particularly since Congress has never indicated any disapproval of a flexible reading of \nthe statute.”) \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 45 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     44  \n \nobjections to the Mandate appear to only hire persons that share those objections, Congress did \nnot create a right to receive contraceptive coverage, and Congress explicitly chose not to impose \nthe section 2713 requirements on grandfathered plans benefitting millions of people.  Individuals \nwho are unable to obtain contraceptive coverage through their employer-sponsored health plans \nbecause of the exemptions created in these interim final rules, or because of other exemptions to \nthe Mandate, have other avenues for obtaining contraception, including through various other \nmechanisms by which the Government advances contraceptive coverage, particularly for low-\nincome women, and which these interim final rules leave unchanged.30  As the Government is \nunder no constitutional obligation to fund contraception, cf. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 \n(1980), even more so may the Government refrain from requiring private citizens to cover \ncontraception for other citizens in violation of their moral convictions. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 \nU.S. 173, 192–93 (1991) (“A refusal to fund protected activity, without more, cannot be equated \nwith the imposition of a ‘penalty’ on that activity.”). \nThe Departments acknowledge that coverage of contraception is an important and highly \ncontroversial issue, implicating many different views, as reflected for example in the public \ncomments received on multiple rulemakings over the course of implementation of section \n2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act.  Our expansion of conscience protections for moral convictions, \nsimilar to protections contained in numerous statutes governing health care regulation, is not \ntaken lightly.  However, after reconsidering the interests served by the Mandate in this particular \n                                                           \n30 See, for example, Family Planning grants in 42 U.S.C. 300, et seq.; the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Program, \nPublic Law 112-74 (125 Stat 786, 1080); the Healthy Start Program, 42 U.S.C. 254c-8; the Maternal, Infant, and \nEarly Childhood Home Visiting Program, 42 U.S.C. 711; Maternal and Child Health Block Grants, 42 U.S.C. 703; \n42 U.S.C. 247b-12; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq.; the Indian Health Service, 25 \nU.S.C. 13, 42 U.S.C. 2001(a), & 25 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.; Health center grants, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), (g), (h), & (i); the \nNIH Clinical Center, 42 U.S.C. 248; and the Personal Responsibility Education Program, 42 U.S.C. 713.   \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 46 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     45  \n \ncontext, the objections raised, and the relevant Federal law, the Departments have determined \nthat expanding the exemptions to include protections for moral convictions is a more appropriate \nadministrative response than continuing to refuse to extend the exemptions and accommodations \nto certain entities and individuals for whom the Mandate violates their sincerely held moral \nconvictions.  Although the number of organizations and individuals that may seek to take \nadvantage of these exemptions and accommodations may be small, we believe that it is \nimportant formally to codify such protections for objections based on moral conviction, given the \nlong-standing recognition of such protections in health care and health insurance context in law \nand regulation and the particularly sensitive nature of these issues in the health care context. \nThese interim final rules leave unchanged HRSA’s authority to decide whether to include \ncontraceptives in the women’s preventive services Guidelines for entities that are not exempted \nby law, regulation, or the Guidelines.  These rules also do not change the many other \nmechanisms by which the Government advances contraceptive coverage, particularly for \nlow-income women. \nIII.  Provisions of the Interim Final Rules With Comment Period \nThe Departments are issuing these interim final rules in light of the full history of \nrelevant rulemaking (including 3 previous interim final rules), public comments, and the long-\nrunning litigation from non-religious moral objectors to the Mandate, as well as the information \ncontained in the companion interim final rules issued elsewhere in this issue of the Federal \nRegister.  These interim final rules seek to resolve these matters by directing HRSA, to the \nextent it requires coverage for certain contraceptive services in its Guidelines, to afford an \nexemption to certain entities and individuals with sincerely held moral convictions by which they \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 47 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     46  \n \nobject to contraceptive or sterilization coverage, and by making the accommodation process \navailable for certain organizations with such convictions.    \nFor all of the reasons discussed and referenced above, the Departments have determined \nthat the Government’s interest in applying contraceptive coverage requirements to the plans of \ncertain entities and individuals does not outweigh the sincerely held moral objections of those \nentities and individuals.  Thus, these interim final rules amend the regulations amended in both \nthe Departments’ July 2015 final regulations and in the companion interim final rules concerning \nreligious beliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules and published \nelsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.  \nThese interim final rules expand those exemptions to include additional entities and \npersons that object based on sincerely held moral convictions.  These rules leave in place \nHRSA’s discretion to continue to require contraceptive and sterilization coverage where no \nobjection specified in the regulations exists, and if section 2713 of the PHS Act otherwise \napplies.  These interim final rules also maintain the existence of an accommodation process as a \nvoluntary option for organizations with moral objections to contraceptive coverage, but \nconsistent with our expansion of the exemption, we expand eligibility for the accommodation to \ninclude organizations with sincerely held moral convictions concerning contraceptive coverage.  \nHRSA is simultaneously updating its Guidelines to reflect the requirements of these interim final \nrules.31 \n1.  Exemption for Objecting Entities Based on Moral Convictions   \n                                                           \n31 See https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ and https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines2016/index.html . \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 48 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     47  \n \nIn the new 45 CFR 147.133 as created by these interim final rules, we expand the \nexemption that was previously located in § 147.131(a), and that was expanded in § 147.132 by \nthe companion interim final rules concerning religious beliefs issued contemporaneously with \nthese interim final rules and published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.  \nWith respect to employers that sponsor group health plans, §147.133(a)(1) and (a)(1)(i) \nprovide exemptions for certain employers that object to coverage of all or a subset of \ncontraceptives or sterilization and related patient education and counseling based on sincerely \nheld moral convictions.  \nFor avoidance of doubt, the Departments wish to make clear that the expanded exemption \nin § 147.133(a) applies to several distinct entities involved in the provision of coverage to the \nobjecting employer’s employees.  This explanation is consistent with how prior rules have \nworked by means of similar language.  Section 147.133(a)(1) and (a)(1)(i), by specifying that \n“[a] group health plan and health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health \nplan” is exempt “to the extent the plan sponsor objects as specified in paragraph (a)(2),” exempt \nthe group health plans the sponsors of which object, and exempt their health insurance issuers in \nproviding the coverage in those plans (whether or not the issuers have their own objections).  \nConsequently, with respect to Guidelines issued under § 147.130(a)(1)(iv), or the parallel \nprovisions in 26 CFR 54.9815-2713T(a)(1)(iv) and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), the plan \nsponsor, issuer, and plan covered in the exemption of that paragraph would face no penalty as a \nresult of omitting contraceptive coverage from the benefits of the plan participants and \nbeneficiaries.  \nConsistent with the restated exemption, exempt entities will not be required to comply \nwith a self-certification process.  Although exempt entities do not need to file notices or \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 49 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     48  \n \ncertifications of their exemption, and these interim final rules do not impose any new notice \nrequirements on them, existing ERISA rules governing group health plans require that, with \nrespect to plans subject to ERISA, a plan document must include a comprehensive summary of \nthe benefits covered by the plan and a statement of the conditions for eligibility to receive \nbenefits.  Under ERISA, the plan document provides what benefits are provided to participants \nand beneficiaries under the plan and, therefore, if an objecting employer would like to exclude \nall or a subset of contraceptive services, it must ensure that the exclusion is clear in the plan \ndocument.  Moreover, if there is a reduction in a covered service or benefit, the plan has to \ndisclose that change to plan participants.32  Thus, where an exemption applies and all or a subset \nof contraceptive services are omitted from a plan’s coverage, otherwise applicable ERISA \ndisclosures should reflect the omission of coverage in ERISA plans.  These existing disclosure \nrequirements serve to help provide notice to participants and beneficiaries of what ERISA plans \ndo and do not cover.  The Departments invite public comment on whether exempt entities, or \nothers, would find value either in being able to maintain or submit a specific form of certification \nto claim their exemption, or in otherwise receiving guidance on a way to document their \nexemption. \nThe exemptions in § 147.133(a) apply “to the extent” of the objecting entities’ sincerely \nheld moral convictions.  Thus, entities that hold a requisite objection to covering some, but not \nall, contraceptive items would be exempt with respect to the items to which they object, but not \nwith respect to the items to which they do not object.  Likewise, the requisite objection of a plan \n                                                           \n32 See, for example, 29 USC 1022, 1024(b), 29 CFR 2520.102-2, 2520.102-3, & 2520.104b-3(d), and 29 CFR \n2590.715-2715. See also 45 CFR 147.200 (requiring disclosure of the “exceptions, reductions, and limitations of the \ncoverage,” including group health plans and group & individual issuers). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 50 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     49  \n \nsponsor or institution of higher education in § 147.133(a)(1)(i) and (ii) exempts its group health \nplan, health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer in connection with such \nplan, and its issuer in its offering of such coverage, but that exemption does not extend to \ncoverage provided by that issuer to other group health plans where the plan sponsors have no \nqualifying objection.  The objection of a health insurance issuer in § 147.133(a)(1)(iii) similarly \noperates only to the extent of its objection, and as otherwise limited as described below. \n2.  Exemption of Certain Plan Sponsors \nThe rules cover certain kinds of non-governmental employer plan sponsors with the \nrequisite objections, and the rules specify which kinds of entities qualify for the exemption.  \nUnder these interim final rules, the Departments do not limit the exemption with \nreference to nonprofit status as previous rules have done.  Many of the federal health care \nconscience statutes cited above offer protections for the moral convictions of entities without \nregard to whether they operate as nonprofits or for-profit entities.  In addition, a significant \nmajority of states either impose no contraceptive coverage requirement, or offer broader \nexemptions than the exemption contained in the July 2015 final regulations.33  States also \ngenerally protect moral convictions in health care conscience laws, and they often offer those \nprotections whether or not an entity operates as a nonprofit.34  Although the practice of states is \nby no means a limit on the discretion delegated to HRSA by the Affordbable Care Act, nor is it a \nstatement about what the Federal Government may do consistent with other protections or \nlimitations in federal law, such state practice can be informative as to the viability of offering \n                                                           \n33 See Guttmacher Institute, “Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives” (Aug. 1, 2017), available at \nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/insurance-coverage-contraceptives. \n34 See, for example, Guttmacher Institute, “Refusing to Provide Health Services” (Aug. 1, 2017), available at \nhttps://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/refusing-provide-health-services. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 51 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     50  \n \nprotections for conscientious objections in particularly sensitive health care contexts.  In this \ncase, the existence of many instances where conscience protections are offered, or no underlying \nmandate of this kind exists that could violate moral convictions, supports the Departments’ \ndecision to expand the Federal exemption concerning this Mandate as set forth in these interim \nfinal rules.  \nSection 147.133(a)(1)(i)(A) of the rules specifies that the exemption includes the plans of \na plan sponsor that is a nonprofit organization with sincerely held moral convictions.  \nSection 147.133(a)(1)(i)(B) of the rules specifies that the exemption includes the plans of \na plan sponsor that is a for-profit entity that has no publicly traded ownership interests (for this \npurpose, a publicly traded ownership interest is any class of common equity securities required \nto be registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  \nExtending the exemption to certain for-profit entities is consistent with the Supreme \nCourt’s ruling in Hobby Lobby, which declared that a corporate entity is capable of possessing \nand pursuing non-pecuniary goals (in Hobby Lobby, religion), regardless of whether the entity \noperates as a nonprofit organization, and rejecting the Departments’ argument to the contrary. \n134 S. Ct. 2768–75.  Some reports and industry experts have indicated that not many for-profit \nentities beyond those that had originally brought suit have sought relief from the Mandate after \nHobby Lobby.35  The mechanisms for determining whether a company has adopted and holds \ncertain principles or views, such as sincerely held moral convictions, is a matter of \n                                                           \n35 See Jennifer Haberkorn, “Two years later, few Hobby Lobby copycats emerge,” Politico (Oct. 11, 2016), \navailable at http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obamacare-birth-control-mandate-employers-229627. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 52 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     51  \n \nwell-established State law with respect to corporate decision-making,36 and the Departments \nexpect that application of such laws would cabin the scope of this exemption. \nThe July 2015 final regulations extended the accommodation to for-profit entities only if \nthey are closely held, by positively defining what constitutes a closely held entity.  Any such \npositive definition runs up against the myriad state differences in defining such entities, and \npotentially intrudes into a traditional area of state regulation of business organizations.  The \nDepartments implicitly recognized the difficulty of defining closely held entities in the July 2015 \nfinal regulations when we adopted a definition that included entities that are merely \n“substantially similar” to certain specified parameters, and we allowed entities that were not sure \nif they met the definition to inquire with HHS; HHS was permitted to decline to answer the \ninquiry, at which time the entity would be deemed to qualify as an eligible organization. Instead \nof attempting to positively define closely held businesses for the purpose of this rule, the \nDepartments consider it much more clear, effective, and preferable to define the category \nnegatively by reference to one element of our previous definition, namely, that the entity has no \npublicly traded ownership interest (that is, any class of common equity securities required to be \nregistered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  \nIn this way, these interim final rules differ from the exemption provided to plan sponsors \nwith objections based on sincerely held religious beliefs set forth in § 147.132(a)(1)—those \nextend to for-profit entities whether or not they are closely held or publicly traded.  The \nDepartments seek public comment on whether the exemption in § 147.133(a)(1)(i) for plan \n                                                           \n36 Although the Departments do not prescribe any form or notification, they would expect that such principles or \nviews would have been adopted and documented in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction under which they \nare incorporated or organized. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 53 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     52  \n \nsponsors with moral objections to the Mandate should be finalized to encompass all of the types \nof plan sponsors covered by § 147.132(a)(1)(i), including publicly traded corporations with \nobjections based on sincerely held moral convictions, and also non-federal governmental plan \nsponsors that may have objections based on sincerely held moral convictions.  \nIn the case of particularly sensitive health care matters, several significant federal health \ncare conscience statutes protect entities’ moral objections without precluding publicly traded and \ngovernmental entities from using those protections.  For example, the first paragraph of the \nChurch Amendments provides certain protections for entities that object based on moral \nconvictions to making their facilities or personnel available to assist in the performance of \nabortions or sterilizations, and the statute does not limit those protections based on whether the \nentities are publicly traded or governmental.  (42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b)).  Thus, under section 300a-\n7(b), a hospital in a publicly traded health system, or a local governmental hospital, could adopt \nsincerely held moral convictions by which it objects to providing facilities or personnel for \nabortions or sterilizations, and if the entity receives relevant funds from HHS specified by \nsection 300a-7(b), the protections of that section would apply.  The Coats-Snowe Amendment \nlikewise provides certain protections for health care entities and postgraduate physician training \nprograms that choose not to perform, refer for, or provide training for abortions, and the statute \ndoes not limit those protections based on whether the entities are publicly traded or \ngovernmental.  (42 U.S.C. 238n).  \nThe Weldon Amendment37 provides certain protections for health care entities, hospitals, \nprovider-sponsored organizations, health maintenance organizations, and health insurance plans \n                                                           \n37 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-31. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 54 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     53  \n \nthat do not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions, and the statute does not \nlimit those protections based on whether the entity is publicly traded or governmental.  The \nAffordable Care Act provides certain protections for any institutional health care entity, hospital, \nprovider-sponsored organization, health maintenance organization, health insurance plan, or any \nother kind of health care facility, that does not provide any health care item or service furnished \nfor the purpose of causing or assisting in causing assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing, \nand the statute similarly does not limit those protections based on whether the entity is publicly \ntraded or governmental.  (42 U.S.C. 18113).38  \nSections 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u-2(b)(3) of 42 U.S.C. protect organizations that \noffer Medicaid and Medicare Advantage managed care plans from being required to provide, \nreimburse for, or provide coverage of a counseling or referral service if they object to doing so \non moral grounds, and those paragraphs do not further specify that publicly traded entities do not \nqualify for the protections.  Congress’ most recent statement on Government requirements of \ncontraceptive coverage specified that, if the District of Columbia requires “the provision of \ncontraceptive coverage by health insurance plans,” “it is the intent of Congress that any \nlegislation enacted on such issue should include a ‘conscience clause’ which provides exceptions \nfor religious beliefs and moral convictions.” Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Division \nC, Title VIII, Sec. 808. Congress expressed no intent that such a conscience should be limited \nbased on whether the entity is publicly traded.  \nAt the same time, the Departments lack significant information about the need to extend \nthe expanded exemption further.  We have been subjected to litigation by nonprofit entities \n                                                           \n38 The lack of the limitation in this provision may be particularly relevant since it is contained in the same statute, \nthe ACA, as the provision under which the Mandate—and these exemptions to the Mandate—are promulgated. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 55 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     54  \n \nexpressing objections to the Mandate based on non-religious moral convictions, and we have \nbeen sued by closely held for-profit entities expressing religious objections.  This combination of \ndifferent types of plaintiffs leads us to believe that there may be a small number of closely held \nfor-profit entities that would seek to use an exemption to the contraceptive Mandate based on \nmoral convictions.  The fact that many closely held for-profit entities brought challenges to the \nMandate has led us to offer protections that would include publicly traded entities with religious \nobjections to the Mandate if such entities exist.  But the combined lack of any lawsuits \nchallenging the Mandate by for-profit entities with non-religious moral convictions, and of any \nlawsuits by any kind of publicly traded entity, leads us to not extend the expanded exemption in \nthese interim final rules to publicly traded entities, but rather to invite public comment on \nwhether to do so in a way parallel to the protections set forth in § 147.132(a)(1)(i).  We agree \nwith the Supreme Court that it is improbable that many publicly traded companies with \nnumerous “unrelated shareholders—including institutional investors with their own set of \nstakeholders—would agree to run a corporation under the same religious beliefs” (or moral \nconvictions) and thereby qualify for the exemption. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2774.  We are \nalso not aware of other types of plan sponsors (such as non-Federal governmental entities) that \nmight possess moral objections to compliance with the Mandate, including whether some might \nconsider certain contraceptive methods as having a possible abortifacient effect.  Nevertheless, \nwe would welcome any comments on whether such corporations or other plan sponsors exist and \nwould benefit from such an exemption. \nDespite our a lack of complete information, the Departments know that nonprofit entities \nhave challenged the Mandate, and we assume that a closely held business might wish to assert \nnon-religious moral convictions in objecting to the Mandate (although we anticipate very few if \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 56 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     55  \n \nany will do so).  Thus we have chosen in these interim final rules to include them in the \nexpanded exemption and thereby remove an obstacle preventing such entities from claiming an \nexemption based on non-religious moral convictions.  But we are less certain that we need to use \nthese interim final rules to extend the expanded exemption for moral convictions to encompass \nother kinds of plan sponsors not included in the protections of these interim final rules.  \nTherefore, with respect to plan sponsors not included in the expanded exemptions of  \n§ 147.133(a)(1)(i), and non-federal governmental plan sponsors that might have moral objections \nto the Mandate, we invite public comment on whether to include such entities when we finalize \nthese rules at a later date.  \nThe Departments further conclude that it would be inadequate to merely provide entities \naccess to the accommodation process instead of to the exemption where those entities object to \nthe Mandate based on sincerely held moral convictions.  The Departments have stated in our \nregulations and court briefings that the existing accommodation with respect to self-insured plans \nrequires contraceptive coverage as part of the same plan as the coverage provided by the \nemployer, and operates in a way “seamless” to those plans.  As a result, in significant respects, \nthe accommodation process does not actually accommodate the objections of many entities.  This \nhas led many religious groups to challenge the accommodation in court, and we expect similar \nchallenges would come from organizations objecting to the accommodation based on moral \nconvictions if we offered them the accommodation but not an exemption.  When we took that \nnarrow approach with religious nonprofit entities it led to multiple cases in many courts that we \nneeded to litigate to the Supreme Court various times.  Although objections to the \naccommodation were not specifically litigated in the two cases brought by nonprofit non-\nreligious organizations (because we have not even made them eligible for the accommodation), \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 57 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     56  \n \nthose organizations made it clear that they and their employees strongly oppose coverage of \ncertain contraceptives in their plans and in connection with their plans. \n3.  Exemption for Institutions of Higher Education  \nThe plans of institutions of higher education that arrange student health insurance \ncoverage will be treated similarly to the way that plans of employers are treated for the purposes \nof such plans being exempt or accommodated based on moral convictions.  These interim final \nrules specify, in § 147.133(a)(1)(ii), that the exemption is extended, in the case of institutions of \nhigher education (as defined in 20 U.S.C. 1002), to their arrangement of student health insurance \ncoverage, in a manner comparable to the applicability of the exemption for group health \ninsurance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan established or maintained by \na plan sponsor.  \nThe Departments are not aware of institutions of higher education that arrange student \ncoverage and object to the Mandate based on non-religious moral convictions.  We have been \nsued by several institutions of higher education that arrange student coverage and object to the \nMandate based on religious beliefs.  We believe the existence of such entities with non-religious \nmoral objections, or the possible formation of such entities in the future, is sufficiently possible \nso that we should provide protections for them in these interim final rules.  But based on a lack \nof information about such entities, we assume that none will use the exemption concerning \nstudent coverage at this time. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 58 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     57  \n \n4. Exemption for Issuers \nThese interim final rules extend the exemption, in § 147.133(a)(1)(iii), to health \ninsurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage that sincerely hold their \nown moral convictions opposed to providing coverage for contraceptive services.  \nAs discussed above, where the exemption for plan sponsors or institutions of higher \neducation applies, issuers are exempt under those sections with respect to providing coverage in \nthose plans.  The issuer exemption in § 147.133(a)(1)(iii) adds to that protection, but the \nadditional protection operates in a different way than the plan sponsor exemption operates.  The \nonly plan sponsors, or in the case of individual insurance coverage, individuals, who are eligible \nto purchase or enroll in health insurance coverage offered by an exempt issuer that does not \ncover some or all contraceptive services are plan sponsors or individuals who themselves object \nand are otherwise exempt based on their objection (whether the objection is based on moral \nconvictions, as set forth in these rules, or on religious beliefs, as set forth in exemptions created \nby the companion interim final rules published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register).  \nThus, the issuer exemption specifies that where a health insurance issuer providing group health \ninsurance coverage is exempt under paragraph (a)(1)(iii), the plan remains subject to any \nrequirement to provide coverage for contraceptive services under Guidelines issued under  \n§ 147.130(a)(1)(iv) unless the plan is otherwise exempt from that requirement.  Accordingly, the \nonly plan sponsors, or in the case of individual insurance coverage, individuals, who are eligible \nto purchase or enroll in health insurance coverage offered by an issuer that is exempt under this \nparagraph (a)(1)(iii) that does not include some or all contraceptive services are plan sponsors or \nindividuals who themselves object and are exempt.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 59 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     58  \n \nUnder the rules as amended, issuers with objections based on sincerely held moral \nconvictions could issue policies that omit contraception to plan sponsors or individuals that are \notherwise exempt based on either their religious beliefs or their moral convictions, and issuers \nwith sincerely held religious beliefs could likewise issue policies that omit contraception to plan \nsponsors or individuals that are otherwise exempt based on either their religious beliefs or their \nmoral convictions.  \nIssuers that hold moral objections should identify to plan sponsors the lack of \ncontraceptive coverage in any health insurance coverage being offered that is based on the \nissuer’s exemption, and communicate the group health plan’s independent obligation to provide \ncontraceptive coverage, unless the group health plan itself is exempt under regulations governing \nthe Mandate.  \nIn this way, the issuer exemption serves to protect objecting issuers both from being \nasked or required to issue policies that cover contraception in violation of the issuers’ sincerely \nheld moral convictions, and from being asked or required to issue policies that omit \ncontraceptive coverage to non-exempt entities or individuals, thus subjecting the issuers to \npotential liability if those plans are not exempt from the Guidelines.  At the same time, the issuer \nexemption will not serve to remove contraceptive coverage obligations from any plan or plan \nsponsor that is not also exempt, nor will it prevent other issuers from being required to provide \ncontraceptive coverage in individual insurance coverage.  Protecting issuers that object to \noffering contraceptive coverage based on sincerely held moral convictions will help preserve \nspace in the health insurance market for certain issuers so that exempt plan sponsors and \nindividuals will be able to obtain coverage.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 60 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     59  \n \nThe Departments are not currently aware of health insurance issuers that possess their \nown religious or moral objections to offering contraceptive coverage.  Nevertheless, many \nFederal health care conscience laws and regulations protect issuers or plans specifically. For \nexample, as discussed above, 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u-2(b)(3) protect plans or \nmanaged care organizations in Medicaid or Medicare Advantage.  The Weldon Amendment \nprotects HMOs, health insurance plans, and any other health care organizations from being \nrequired to provide coverage or pay for abortions. See, for example, Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-31.  The most recently \nenacted Consolidated Appropriations Act declares that Congress supports a “conscience clause” \nto protect moral convictions concerning “the provision of contraceptive coverage by health \ninsurance plans.” See id. at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808.  \nThe issuer exemption does not specifically include third party administrators, for the \nreasons discussed in the companion interim final rules concerning religious beliefs issued \ncontemporaneously with these interim final rules and published elsewhere in this issue of the \nFederal Register.  The Departments solicit public comment; however, on whether there are \nsituations where there may be an additional need to provide distinct protections for third party \nadministrators that may have moral convictions implicated by the Mandate.39 \n5. Scope of Objections Needed for the Objecting Entity Exemption \n                                                           \n39 The exemption for issuers, as outlined here, does not make a distinction among issuers based on whether they are \npublicly traded, unlike the plan sponsor exemption for business entities. Because the issuer exemption operates more \nnarrowly than the exemption for business plan sponsors operates, in the ways described here, and exists in part to \nhelp preserve market options for objecting plan sponsors, the Departments consider it appropriate to not draw such a \ndistinction among issuers. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 61 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     60  \n \nExemptions for objecting entities specify that they apply where the entities object as \nspecified in § 147.133(a)(2).  That section specifies that exemptions for objecting entities will \napply to the extent that an entity described in § 147.133(a)(1) objects to its establishing, \nmaintaining, providing, offering, or arranging (as applicable) for coverage, payments, or a plan \nthat provides coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services, based on its sincerely \nheld moral convictions.  \n6.  Individual Exemption \nThese interim final rules include a special rule pertaining to individuals (referred to here \nas the “individual exemption”).  Section 147.133(b) provides that nothing in §147.130(a)(1)(iv), \n26 CFR 54.9815-2713T(a)(1)(iv) and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), may be construed to \nprevent a willing plan sponsor of a group health plan and/or a willing health insurance issuer \noffering group or individual health insurance coverage, from offering a separate benefit package \noption, or a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance, to any individual who objects to \ncoverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services based on the individual’s sincerely \nheld moral convictions.  The individual exemption extends to the coverage unit in which the plan \nparticipant, or subscriber in the individual market, is enrolled (for instance, to family coverage \ncovering the participant and his or her beneficiaries enrolled under the plan), but does not relieve \nthe plan’s or issuer’s obligation to comply with the Mandate with respect to the group health plan \nat large or, as applicable, to any other individual policies the issuer offers.  \nThis individual exemption allows plan sponsors and issuers that do not specifically object \nto contraceptive coverage to offer morally acceptable coverage to their participants or \nsubscribers who do object, while offering coverage that includes contraception to participants or \nsubscribers who do not object.  This individual exemption can apply with respect to individuals \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 62 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     61  \n \nin plans sponsored by private employers or governmental employers.  For example, in one case \nbrought against the Departments, the State of Missouri enacted a law under which the State is not \npermitted to discriminate against insurance issuers that offer health plans without coverage for \ncontraception based on employees’ moral convictions, or against the individual employees who \naccept such offers. See Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1015–16 (quoting Mo. Rev. Stat. 191.724). \nUnder the individual exemption of these interim final rules, employers sponsoring governmental \nplans would be free to honor the sincerely held moral objections of individual employees by \noffering them plans that omit contraception, even if those governmental entities do not object to \noffering contraceptive coverage in general. \nThis “individual exemption” cannot be used to force a plan (or its sponsor) or an issuer to \nprovide coverage omitting contraception, or, with respect to health insurance coverage, to \nprevent the application of state law that requires coverage of such contraceptives or sterilization.  \nNor can the individual exemption be construed to require the guaranteed availability of coverage \nomitting contraception to a plan sponsor or individual who does not have a sincerely held moral \nobjection.  This individual exemption is limited to the requirement to provide contraceptive \ncoverage under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, and does not affect any other federal or state \nlaw governing the plan or coverage.  Thus, if there are other applicable laws or plan terms \ngoverning the benefits, these interim final rules do not affect such other laws or terms. \nThe Departments believe the individual exemption will help to meet the Affordable Care \nAct’s goal of increasing health coverage because it will reduce the incidence of certain \nindividuals choosing to forego health coverage because the only coverage available would \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 63 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     62  \n \nviolate their sincerely held moral convictions.40  At the same time, this individual exemption \n“does not undermine the governmental interests furthered by the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement,”41 because, when the exemption is applicable, the individual does not want the \ncoverage, and therefore would not use the objectionable items even if they were covered.  In \naddition, because the individual exemption only operates when the employer and/or issuer, as \napplicable, are willing, the exemption will not undermine any governmental interest in the \nworkability of the insurance market, because we expect that any workability concerns will be \ntaken into account in the decision of whether to be willing to offer the individual morally \nacceptable coverage.  \nFor similar reasons, we have changed our position and now believe the individual \nexemption will not undermine any Government interest in uniformity in the health insurance \nmarket.  At the level of plan offerings, the extent to which plans cover contraception under the \nprior rules is already far from uniform.  The Congress did not require compliance with section \n2713 of the PHS Act by all entities—in particular by grandfathered plans.  The Departments’ \nprevious exemption for houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries, and our accommodation of \nself-insured church plans, show that the importance of a uniform health insurance system is not \nsignificantly harmed by allowing plans to omit contraception in many contexts.42 \n                                                           \n40 This prospect has been raised in cases of religious individuals—see, for example, Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at \n1017, and March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 130—where the courts noted that the individual employee plaintiffs \nindicated that they viewed the Mandate as pressuring them to “forgo health insurance altogether.” \n41 78 FR 39874. \n42 See also Real Alternatives, 2017 WL 3324690 at *36 (3d Cir. Aug. 4, 2017) (Jordan, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part) (“Because insurance companies would offer such plans as a result of market forces, doing so \nwould not undermine the government's interest in a sustainable and functioning market.… Because the government \nhas failed to demonstrate why allowing such a system (not unlike the one that allowed wider choice before the \nACA) would be unworkable, it has not satisfied strict scrutiny.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 64 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     63  \n \nWith respect to operationalizing this provision of these rules, as well as the similar \nprovision protecting individuals with religious objections to purchasing insurance that covers \nsome or all contraceptives, in the interim final rules published elsewhere in this issue of the \nFederal Register, the Departments note that a plan sponsor or health insurance issuer is not \nrequired to offer separate and different benefit package options, or separate and different forms \nof policy, certificate, or contract of insurance with respect to those individuals who object on \nmoral bases from those who object on religious bases.  That is, a willing employer or issuer may \noffer the same benefit package option or policy, certificate, or contract of insurance—which \nexcludes the same scope of some or all contraceptive coverage—to individuals who are exempt \nfrom the Mandate because of their moral convictions (under these rules) or their religious beliefs \n(under the regulations as amended by the interim final rules pertaining to religious beliefs). \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 65 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     64  \n \n7.  Optional Accommodation \nIn addition to expanding the exemption to those with sincerely held moral convictions, \nthese rules also expand eligibility for the optional accommodation process to include employers \nwith objections based on sincerely held moral convictions.  This is accomplished by inserting \nreferences to the newly added exemption for moral convictions, 45 CFR 147.133, into the \nregulatory sections where the accommodation process is codified, 45 CFR 147.131, 26 CFR \n54.9815-2713AT, and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A.  In all other respects the accommodation \nprocess works the same as it does for entities with objections based on sincerely held religious \nbeliefs, as described in the companion interim final rules concerning religious beliefs issued \ncontemporaneously with these interim final rules and published elsewhere in this issue of the \nFederal Register.  \nThe Departments are not aware of entities with objections to the Mandate based on \nsincerely held moral convictions that wish to make use of the optional accommodation, and our \npresent assumption is that no such entities will seek to use the accommodation rather than the \nexemption.  But if such entities do wish to use the accommodation, making it available to them \nwill both provide contraceptive coverage to their plan participants and respect those entities’ \nobjections.  Because entities with objections to the Mandate based on sincerely held non-\nreligious moral convictions have not previously had access to the accommodation, they would \nnot be in a position to revoke their use of the accommodation at the time these interim final rules \nare issued, but could do so in the future under the same parameters set forth in the \naccommodation regulations.  \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 66 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     65  \n \n8.  Regulatory Restatements of section 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PHS Act \nThese interim final rules insert references to 45 CFR 147.133 into the restatements of the \nrequirements of section 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PHS Act, contained in 26 CFR 54.9815-\n2713T(a)(1) introductory text and (a)(1)(iv), 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1) introductory text and \n(a)(1)(iv), and 45 CFR 147.130(a)(1) and (a)(1)(iv).   \n9.  Conclusion \nThe Departments believe that the Guidelines, and the expanded exemptions and \naccommodations set forth in these interim final rules, will advance the legitimate but limited \npurposes for which Congress imposed section 2713 of the PHS Act, while acting consistently \nwith Congress’ well-established record of allowing for moral exemptions with respect to various \nhealth care matters.  These interim final rules maintain HRSA’s discretion to decide whether to \ncontinue to require contraceptive coverage under the Guidelines if no regulatorily recognized \nexemption exists (and in plans where Congress applied section 2713 of the PHS Act).  As cited \nabove, these interim final rules also leave fully in place over a dozen Federal programs that \nprovide, or subsidize, contraceptives for women, including for low income women based on \nfinancial need.  The Departments believe this array of programs and requirements better serves \nthe interests of providing contraceptive coverage while protecting the moral convictions of \nentities and individuals concerning coverage of some or all contraceptive or sterilization \nservices.  \nThe Departments request and encourage public comments on all matters addressed in \nthese interim final rules. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 67 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     66  \n \nIV.  Interim Final Rules, Request for Comments and Waiver of Delay of Effective \nDate \nSection 9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the PHS Act \nauthorize the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS (collectively, the Secretaries) to \npromulgate any interim final rules that they determine are appropriate to carry out the provisions \nof chapter 100 of the Code, part 7 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, and part A of title XXVII of \nthe PHS Act, which include sections 2701 through 2728 of the PHS Act and the incorporation of \nthose sections into section 715 of ERISA and section 9815 of the Code.  These interim final rules \nfall under those statutory authorized justifications, as did previous rules on this matter (75 FR \n41726; 76 FR 46621; and 79 FR 51092). \nSection 553(b) of the APA requires notice and comment rulemaking, involving a notice \nof proposed rulemaking and a comment period prior to finalization of regulatory requirements – \nexcept when an agency, for good cause, finds that notice and public comment thereon are \nimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.  These provisions of the APA do \nnot apply here because of the specific authority granted to the Secretaries by section 9833 of the \nCode, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the PHS Act.  \nEven if these provisions of the APA applied, they would be satisfied:  The Departments \nhave determined that it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay \nputting these provisions in place until a full public notice-and-comment process is completed. As \ndiscussed earlier, the Departments have issued three interim final rules implementing this section \nof the PHS Act because of the immediate needs of covered entities and the weighty matters \nimplicated by the HRSA Guidelines.  As recently as December 20, 2016, HRSA updated those \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 68 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     67  \n \nGuidelines without engaging in the regulatory process (because doing so is not a legal \nrequirement), and announced that it plans to so continue to update the Guidelines.  \nTwo lawsuits have been pending for several years by entities raising non-religious moral \nobjections to the Mandate.43  In one of those cases, the Departments are subject to a permanent \ninjunction and the appeal of that case has been stayed since February 2016.  In the other case, \nFederal district and appeals courts ruled in favor of the Departments, denying injunctive relief to \nthe plaintiffs, and that case is also still pending.  Based on the public comments the Departments \nhave received, we have reason to believe that some similar nonprofit entities might exist, even if \nit is likely a small number.44  \nFor entities and individuals facing a burden on their sincerely held moral convictions, \nproviding them relief from Government regulations that impose such a burden is an important \nand urgent matter, and delay in doing so injures those entities in ways that cannot be repaired \nretroactively.  The burdens of the existing rules undermine these entities’ and individuals’ \nparticipation in the health care market because they provide them with a serious disincentive—\nindeed a crisis of conscience—between participating in or providing quality and affordable \nhealth insurance coverage and being forced to violate their sincerely held moral convictions.  \nThe existence of inconsistent court rulings in multiple proceedings has also caused confusion and \nuncertainty that has extended for several years, with different federal courts taking different \npositions on whether entities with moral objections are entitled to relief from the Mandate. \n                                                           \n43 March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116; Real Alternatives, 867 F.3d 338. \n44 See, for example, Americans United for Life (“AUL”) Comment on CMA-9992-IFC2 at 10 (Nov. 1, 2011), \navailable at \nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=HHS-OS-2011-0023-59496, and AUL Comment on CMS-9968-P \nat 5 (Apr. 8, 2013), available at http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CMS-2012-0031-79115. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 69 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     68  \n \nDelaying the availability of the expanded exemption would require entities to bear these burdens \nfor many more months.  Continuing to apply the Mandate’s regulatory burden on individuals and \norganizations with moral convictions objecting to compliance with the Mandate also serves as a \ndeterrent for citizens who might consider forming new entities consistent with their moral \nconvictions and offering health insurance through those entities.  \nMoreover, we separately expanded exemptions to protect religious beliefs in the \ncompanion interim final rules issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules and \npublished elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.  Because Congress has provided many \nstatutes that protect religious beliefs and moral convictions similarly in certain health care \ncontexts, it is important not to delay the expansion of exemptions for moral convictions set forth \nin these rules, since the companion rules provide protections for religious beliefs on an interim \nfinal basis. Otherwise, our regulations would simultaneously provide and deny relief to entities \nand individuals that are, in the Departments’ view, similarly deserving of exemptions and \naccommodations consistent, with similar protections in other federal laws.  This could cause \nsimilarly situated entities and individuals to be burdened unequally.  \nIn response to several of the previous rules on this issue—including three issued as \ninterim final rules under the statutory authority cited above—the Departments received more \nthan 100,000 public comments on multiple occasions.  Those comments included extensive \ndiscussion about whether and to what extent to expand the exemption.  Most recently, on \nJuly 26, 2016, the Departments issued a request for information (81 FR 47741) and received over \n54,000 public comments about different possible ways to resolve these issues.  As noted above, \nthe public comments in response to both the RFI and various prior rulemaking proceedings \nincluded specific requests that the exemptions be expanded to include those who oppose the \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 70 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     69  \n \nMandate for either religious or “moral” reasons.45  In connection with past regulations, the \nDepartments have offered or expanded a temporary safe harbor allowing organizations that were \nnot exempt from the HRSA Guidelines to operate out of compliance with the Guidelines.  The \nDepartments will fully consider comments submitted in response to these interim final rules, but \nbelieve that good cause exists to issue the rules on an interim final basis before the comments are \nsubmitted and reviewed. Issuing interim final rules with a comment period provides the public \nwith an opportunity to comment on whether these regulations expanding the exemption should \nbe made permanent or subject to modification without delaying the effective date of the \nregulations. \nAs the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stated with respect to an earlier IFR \npromulgated with respect to this issue in Priests for Life v. U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services, 772 F.3d 229, 276 (D.C. Cir. 2014), vacated on other grounds, Zubik v. \nBurwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016), “[S]everal reasons support HHS’s decision not to engage in \nnotice and comment here.” Among other things, the Court noted that “the agency made a good \ncause finding in the rule it issued”; that “the regulations the interim final rule modifies were \nrecently enacted pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking, and presented virtually identical \nissues”; that “HHS will expose its interim rule to notice and comment before its permanent \nimplementation”; and that not proceeding under interim final rules would “delay the \nimplementation of the alternative opt-out for religious objectors.” Id. at 277. Similarly, not \n                                                           \n45 See, for example, http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=HHS-OS-2011-0023-59496,  \nhttp://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=CMS-2012-0031-79115, \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-54142, \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-54218, and \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=CMS-2016-0123-46220. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 71 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     70  \n \nproceeding with exemptions and accommodations for moral objectors here would delay the \nimplementation of those alternative opt-outs for moral objectors. \nDelaying the availability of the expanded exemption could also increase the costs of \nhealth insurance for some entities.  As reflected in litigation pertaining to the Mandate, some \nentities are in grandfathered health plans that do not cover contraception.  As such, they may \nwish to make changes to their health plans that will reduce the costs of insurance coverage for \ntheir beneficiaries or policyholders, but which would cause the plans to lose grandfathered status. \nTo the extent that entities with objections to the Mandate based on moral convictions but not \nreligious beliefs fall into this category, they may be refraining from making those changes—and \ntherefore may be continuing to incur and pass on higher insurance costs—to prevent the Mandate \nfrom applying to their plans in violation of their consciences.  We are not aware of the extent to \nwhich such entities exist, but 17 percent of all covered workers are in grandfathered health plans, \nencompassing tens of millions of people.46  Issuing these rules on an interim final basis reduces \nthe costs of health insurance and regulatory burdens for such entities and their plan participants.  \nThese interim final rules also expand access to the optional accommodation process for \ncertain entities with objections to the Mandate based on moral convictions.  If entities exist that \nwish to use that process, the Departments believe they should be able to do so without the delay \nthat would be involved by not offering them the optional accommodation process by use of \ninterim final rules.  Proceeding otherwise could delay the provision of contraceptive coverage to \nthose entities’ employees. \n                                                           \n46 Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, “Employer Health Benefits, 2017 Annual \nSurvey,” available at http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-2017. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 72 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     71  \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Departments have determined that it would be \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest to engage in full notice and comment \nrulemaking before putting these interim final rules into effect, and that it is in the public interest \nto promulgate interim final rules.  For the same reasons, the Departments have determined, \nconsistent with section 553(d) of the APA (5 U.S.C. 553(d)), that there is good cause to make \nthese interim final rules effective immediately upon filing for public inspection at the Office of \nthe Federal Register. \nV.  Economic Impact and Paperwork Burden \nWe have examined the impacts of the interim final rules as required by Executive Order \n12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (September 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 on \nImproving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011),, the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96-354, section1102(b) of the Social Security Act, \nsection 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995; Pub. L. 104-4), \nExecutive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999), the Congressional Review Act (5 \nU.S.C. 804(2)and Executive Order 13771 on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory \nCosts (January 30, 2017).  \nA.  Executive Orders 12866 and 13563—Department of HHS and Department of Labor \nExecutive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of \navailable regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches \nthat maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, and public health and \nsafety effects; distributive impacts; and equity).  Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the \nimportance of quantifying both costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and \npromoting flexibility. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 73 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     72  \n \nSection 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 defines a “significant regulatory action” as an \naction that is likely to result in a regulation:  (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 \nmillion or more in any 1 year, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, \nproductivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal \ngovernments or communities (also referred to as “economically significant”); (2) creating a \nserious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; \n(3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement grants, user fees, or loan programs or \nthe rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising \nout of legal mandates, the President’s priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. \nA regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for major rules with economically \nsignificant effects ($100 million or more in any one year), and an “economically significant” \nregulatory action is subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). As \ndiscussed below regarding anticipated effects of these rules and the Paperwork Reduction Act, \nthese interim final rules are not likely to have economic impacts of $100 million or more in any \none year, and therefore do not meet the definition of “economically significant” under Executive \nOrder 12866.  However, OMB has determined that the actions are significant within the meaning \nof section 3(f)(4) of the Executive Order.  Therefore, OMB has reviewed these final regulations \nand the Departments have provided the following assessment of their impact. .  \n1.  Need for Regulatory Action \nThese interim final rules amend the Departments’ July 2015 final regulations and do so in \nconjunction with the amendments made in the companion interim final rules concerning religious \nbeliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules and published elsewhere in this \nissue of the Federal Register.  These interim final rules expand the exemption from the \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 74 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     73  \n \nrequirement to provide coverage for contraceptives and sterilization, established under the HRSA \nGuidelines, promulgated under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, section 715(a)(1) of the \nERISA, and section 9815(a)(1) of the Code, to include certain entities and individuals with \nobjections to compliance with the Mandate based on sincerely held moral convictions, and they \nrevise the accommodation process to make entities with such convictions eligible to use it.  The \nexpanded exemption would apply to certain individuals, nonprofit entities, institutions of higher \neducation, issuers, and for-profit entities that do not have publicly traded ownership interests, \nthat have a moral objection to providing coverage for some (or all) of the contraceptive and/or \nsterilization services covered by the Guidelines.  Such action is taken, among other reasons, to \nprovide for conscientious participation in the health insurance market free from penalties for \nviolating sincerely held moral convictions opposed to providing or receiving coverage of \ncontraceptive services, to resolve lawsuits that have been filed against the Departments by some \nsuch entities, and to avoid similar legal challenges. \n2.  Anticipated Effects \nThe Departments acknowledge that expanding the exemption to include objections based \non moral convictions might result in less insurance coverage of contraception for some women \nwho may want the coverage.  Although the Departments do not know the exact scope of that \neffect attributable to the moral exemption in these interim final rules, they believe it to be small.  \nWith respect to the expanded exemption for nonprofit organizations, as noted above the \nDepartments are aware of two small nonprofit organizations that have filed lawsuits raising non-\nreligious moral objections to coverage of some contraceptives.  Both of those entities have fewer \nthan five employees enrolled in health coverage, and both require all of their employees to agree \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 75 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     74  \n \nwith their opposition to the coverage.47  Based on comments submitted in response to prior \nrulemakings on this subject, we believe that at least one other similar entity exists.  However, we \ndo not know how many similar entities exist. Lacking other information we assume that the \nnumber is small.  Without data to estimate the number of such entities, we believe it to be less \nthan 10, and assume the exemption will be used by nine nonprofit entities.  \nWe also assume that those nine entities will operate in a fashion similar to the two similar \nentities of which we are aware, so that their employees will likely share their views against \ncoverage of certain contraceptives.  This is consistent with our conclusion in previous rules that \nno significant burden or costs would result from exempting houses of worship and integrated \nauxiliaries. (See 76 FR 46625 and 78 FR 39889).  We reached that conclusion without ultimately \nrequiring that houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries only hire persons who agree with their \nviews against contraception, and without even requiring that such entities actually oppose \ncontraception in order to be exempt (in contrast, the expanded exemption here requires the \nexempt entity to actually possess sincerely held moral convictions objecting to the coverage).  In \nconcluding that the exemption for houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries would result in no \nsignificant burden or costs, we relied on our assumption that the employees of exempt houses of \nworship and integrated auxiliaries likely share their employers’ opposition to contraceptive \ncoverage.  \nA similar assumption is supported with respect to the expanded exemption for nonprofit \norganizations.  To our knowledge, the vast majority of organizations objecting to the Mandate \n                                                           \n47 Non-religious nonprofit organizations that engage in expressive activity generally have a First Amendment right \nto hire only people who share their moral convictions or will be respectful of them—including their convictions on \nwhether the organization or others provide health coverage of contraception, or of certain items they view as being \nabortifacient. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 76 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     75  \n \nassert religious beliefs.  The only nonprofit organizations of which we are aware that possess \nnon-religious moral convictions against some or all contraceptive methods only hire persons who \nshare their convictions.  It is possible that the exemption for nonprofit organizations with moral \nconvictions in these interim final rules could be used by a nonprofit organization that employs \npersons who do not share the organization’s views on contraception, but it was also possible \nunder our previous rules that a house of worship or integrated auxiliary could employ persons \nwho do not share their views on contraception.48  Although we are unable to find sufficient data \non this issue, we believe that there are far fewer non-religious moral nonprofit organizations \nopposed to contraceptive coverage than there are churches with religious objections to such \ncoverage.  Based on our limited data, we believe the most likely effect of the expanded \nexemption for nonprofit entities is that it will be used by entities similar to the two entities that \nhave sought an exemption through litigation, and whose employees also oppose the coverage. \nTherefore, we expect that the expanded exemption for nonprofit entities will have no effect of \nreducing contraceptive coverage to employees who want that coverage.  \nThese interim final rules expand the exemption to include institutions of higher education \nthat arrange student coverage and have non-religious moral objections to the Mandate, and they \nmake exempt entities with moral objections eligible to use the accommodation.  The \nDepartments are not aware of either kind of entity.  We believe the number of entities that object \nto the Mandate based on non-religious moral convictions is already very small.  The only entities \nof which we are aware that have raised such objections are not institutions of higher education, \n                                                           \n48 Cf., for example, Gallup, “Americans, Including Catholics, Say Birth Control Is Morally OK,” (May 22, 2012) \n(“Eighty-two percent of U.S. Catholics say birth control is morally acceptable”), available at \nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/154799/americans-including-catholics-say-birth-control-morally.aspx. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 77 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     76  \n \nand appear to hold objections that we assume would likely lead them to reject the \naccommodation process.  Therefore, for the purposes of estimating the anticipated effect of these \ninterim final rules on contraceptive coverage of women who wish to receive such coverage, we \nassume that—at this time—no entities with non-religious moral objections to the Mandate will \nbe institutions of higher education that arrange student coverage, and no entities with non-\nreligious moral objections will opt into the accommodation.  We wish to make the expanded \nexemption and accommodation available to such entities in case they do exist or might come into \nexistence, based on similar reasons to those given above for why the exemptions and \naccommodations are extended to other entities.  We invite public comment on whether and how \nmany such entities will make use of these interim final rules. \nThe expanded exemption for issuers will not result in a distinct effect on contraceptive \ncoverage for women who wish to receive it because that exemption only applies in cases where \nplan sponsors or individuals are also otherwise exempt, and the effect of those exemptions is \ndiscussed elsewhere herein.  The expanded exemption for individuals that oppose contraceptive \ncoverage based on sincerely held moral convictions will provide coverage that omits \ncontraception for individuals that object to contraceptive coverage. \nThe expanded moral exemption would also cover for-profit entities that do not have \npublicly traded ownership interests, and that have non-religious moral objections to the Mandate. \nThe Departments are not aware of any for-profit entities that possess non-religious moral \nobjections to the Mandate.  However, scores of for-profit entities have filed suit challenging the \nMandate.  Among the over 200 entities that brought legal challenges, only two entities (less than \n1 percent) raised non-religious moral objections—both were nonprofit.  Among the general \npublic polls vary about religious beliefs, but one prominent poll shows that 89 percent of \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 78 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     77  \n \nAmericans say they believe in God.49  Among non-religious persons, only a very small \npercentage appears to hold moral objections to contraception.  A recent study found that only 2 \npercent of religiously unaffiliated persons believed using contraceptives is morally wrong.50 \nCombined, this suggests that 0.2 percent of Americans at most51 might believe contraceptives are \nmorally wrong based on moral convictions but not religious beliefs.  We have no information \nabout how many of those persons run closely held businesses, offer employer sponsored health \ninsurance, and would make use of the expanded exemption for moral convictions set forth in \nthese interim final rules.  Given the large number of closely held entities that challenged the \nMandate based on religious objections, we assume that some similar for-profit entities with non-\nreligious moral objections exist.  But we expect that it will be a comparatively small number of \nentities, since among the nonprofit litigants, only two were non-religious.  Without data available \nto estimate the actual number of entities that will make use of the expanded exemption for for-\nprofit entities that do not have publicly traded ownership interests and that have objections to the \nMandate based on sincerely held moral convictions, we expect that fewer than 10 entities, if any, \nwill do so—we assume nine for-profit entities will use the exemption in these interim final rules.  \nThe expanded exemption encompassing certain for-profit entities could result in the \nremoval of contraceptive coverage from women who do not share their employers’ views.  The \nDepartments used data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Medical Expenditure \nPanel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) to obtain an estimate of the number of \n                                                           \n49 Gallup, “Most Americans Still Believe in God” (June 14–23, 2016), available at \nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/193271/americans-believe-god.aspx.  \n50 Pew Research Center, “Where the Public Stands on Religious Liberty vs. Nondiscrimination” at page 26 (Sept. \n28, 2016), available at http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/09/Religious-Liberty-full-for-\nweb.pdf.  \n51 The study defined religiously “unaffiliated” as agnostic, atheist or “nothing in particular” (id. at 8), as distinct \nfrom several versions of Protestants, or Catholics. “Nothing in particular” might have included some theists. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 79 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     78  \n \npolicyholders that will be covered by the plans of the nine for-profit entities we assume may \nmake use of these expanded exemptions.52  The average number of policyholders (9) in plans \nwith under 100 employees was obtained.  It is not known what size the for-profit employers will \nbe that might claim this exemption, but as discussed above these interim final rules do not \ninclude publicly traded companies (and we invite public comments on whether to do so in the \nfinal rules), and both of the two nonprofit entities that challenged the Mandate included fewer \nthan five policyholders in each entity.  Therefore we assume the for-profit entities that may claim \nthis expanded exemption will have fewer than 100 employees and an average of 9 policyholders. \nFor nine entities, the total number of policyholders would be 81.  DOL estimates that for each \npolicyholder, there is approximately one dependent.53  This amounts to 162 covered persons. \nCensus data indicate that women of childbearing age—that is, women aged 15–44—comprise \n20.2 percent of the general population.54  This amounts to approximately 33 women of \nchildbearing age for this group of individuals covered by group plans sponsored by for-profit \nmoral objectors.  Approximately 44.3 percent of women currently use contraceptives covered by \nthe Guidelines.55  Thus we estimate that 15 women may incur contraceptive costs due to for-\n                                                           \n52 \"Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin\" Table 4, page 21.

In addition, studies commonly consider the 15–44 age range to assess contraceptive use by \nwomen of childbearing age.

As discussed above, we assume that no \nentities with non-religious moral convictions will use the accommodation, although we wish to \nmake it available in case an entity voluntarily opts into it in order to allow contraceptive \ncoverage to be provided to its plan participants and beneficiaries.  Finally, because the \naccommodation process was not previously available to entities that possess non-religious moral \nobjections to the Mandate, we do not anticipate that these interim final rules will result in any \nburden from such entities revoking their accommodated status.  \nThe Departments believe the foregoing analysis represents a reasonable estimate of the \nlikely impact under the rules expanded exemptions.  The Departments acknowledge uncertainty \n                                                           \n56 We note that many non-religious for-profit entities which sued the Departments challenging the Mandate, \nincluding some of the largest employers, only objected to coverage of 4 of the 18 types of contraceptives required to \nbe covered by the Mandate—namely, those contraceptives which they viewed as abortifacients, and akin to abortion \n—and they were willing to provide coverage for other types of contraception.  It is reasonable to assume that this \nwould also be the case with respect to some for-profits that object to the Mandate on the basis of sincerely held \nmoral convictions. Accordingly, it is possible that even fewer women beneficiaries under such plans would bear out-\nof-pocket expenses in order to obtain contraceptives, and that those who might do so would bear lower costs due to \nmany contraceptive items being covered. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 81 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     80  \n \nin the estimate and therefore conducted a second analysis using an alternative framework, which \nis set forth in the companion interim final rule concerning religious beliefs issued \ncontemporaneously with this interim final rule and published elsewhere in this issue of the \nFederal Register.  Under either estimate, this interim final rule is not economically significant. \nWe reiterate the rareness of instances in which we are aware that employers assert non-\nreligious objections to contraceptive coverage based on sincerely held moral convictions, as \ndiscussed above, and also that in the few instances where such an objection has been raised, \nemployees of such employers also opposed contraception.   \nWe request comment on all aspects of the preceding regulatory impact analysis. \nB.  Special Analyses—Department of the Treasury \nFor purposes of the Department of the Treasury, certain Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nregulations, including this one, are exempt from the requirements in Executive Order 12866, as \nsupplemented by Executive Order 13563.  The Departments estimate that the likely effect of \nthese interim final rules will be that entities will use the exemption and not the accommodation. \nTherefore, a regulatory assessment is not required.  \nC.  Regulatory Flexibility Act \nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (RFA) imposes certain \nrequirements with respect to Federal rules that are subject to the notice and comment \nrequirements of section 553(b) of the APA (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and that are likely to have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  Under Section 553(b) of \nthe APA, a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required when an agency, for good \ncause, finds that notice and public comment thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary \nto the public interest.  The interim final rules are exempt from the APA, both because the PHS \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 82 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     81  \n \nAct, ERISA, and the Code contain specific provisions under which the Secretaries may adopt \nregulations by interim final rule and because the Departments have made a good cause finding \nthat a general notice of proposed rulemaking is not necessary earlier in this preamble.  Therefore, \nthe RFA does not apply and the Departments are not required to either certify that the regulations \nor this amendment would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities or conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis. \nNevertheless, the Departments carefully considered the likely impact of the rule on small \nentities in connection with their assessment under Executive Order 12866.  The Departments do \nnot expect that these interim final rules will have a significant economic effect on a substantial \nnumber of small entities, because they will not result in any additional costs to affected entities. \nInstead, by exempting from the Mandate small businesses and nonprofit organizations with \nmoral objections to some or all contraceptives and/or sterilization, the Departments have reduced \nregulatory burden on small entities.  Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, these regulations \nhave been submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration \nfor comment on their impact on small business.  \nD.  Paperwork Reduction Act—Department of Health and Human Services  \nUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA), federal agencies are required to \npublish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information.  \nInterested persons are invited to send comments regarding our burden estimates or any other \naspect of this collection of information, including any of the following subjects:  (1) the necessity \nand utility of the proposed information collection for the proper performance of the agency's \nfunctions; (2) the accuracy of the estimated burden; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 83 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     82  \n \nclarity of the information to be collected; and (4) the use of automated collection techniques or \nother forms of information technology to minimize the information collection burden.    \nWe estimate that these interim final rules will not result in additional burdens not \naccounted for as set forth in the companion interim final rules concerning religious beliefs issued \ncontemporaneously with these interim final rules and published elsewhere in this issue of the \nFederal Register.  As discussed there, regulations covering the accommodation include \nprovisions regarding self-certification or notices to HHS from eligible organizations (§ \n147.131(c)(3)), notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services (§ \n147.131(f)), and notice of revocation of accommodation (§ 147.131(c)(4)).  The burdens related \nto those ICRs are currently approved under OMB Control Numbers 0938-1248 and 0938-1292.  \nThese interim final rules amend the accommodation regulations to make entities with moral \nobjections to the Mandate eligible to use the same accommodation processes.  The Departments \nwill update the forms and model notices regarding these processes to reflect that entities with \nsincerely held moral convictions are eligible organizations.  \nAs discussed above, however, we assume that no entities with non-religious moral \nobjections to the Mandate will use the accommodation, and we know that no such entities were \neligible for it until now, so that they do not possess accommodated status to revoke.  Therefore \nwe believe that the burden for these ICRs is accounted for in the collection approved under OMB \nControl Numbers 0938-1248 and 0938-1292, as described in the interim final rules concerning \nreligious beliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules.  \nWe are soliciting comments on all of the possible information collection requirements \ncontained in these interim final rules, including those discussed in the companion interim final \nrules concerning religious beliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules and \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 84 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     83  \n \npublished elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, for which these interim final rules \nprovide eligibility to entities with objections based on moral convictions.  In addition, we are \nalso soliciting comments on all of the related information collection requirements currently \napproved under 0938-1292 and 0938-1248.   \nTo obtain copies of a supporting statement and any related forms for the proposed \ncollection(s) summarized in this notice, you may make your request using one of following: \n1.

E-mail your request, including your address, phone number, OMB number, and CMS \ndocument identifier, to Paperwork@cms.hhs.gov. \n3.  Call the Reports Clearance Office at (410) 786-1326.   \nIf you comment on these information collections, that is, reporting, recordkeeping or \nthird-party disclosure requirements, please submit your comments electronically as specified in \nthe ADDRESSES section of these interim final rules with comment period. \nE.  Paperwork Reduction Act—Department of Labor \nUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and an \nindividual is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a valid \nOMB control number.  In accordance with the requirements of the PRA, the ICR for the EBSA \nForm 700 and alternative notice have previously been approved by OMB under control numbers \n1210-0150 and 1210-0152.  A copy of the ICR may be obtained by contacting the PRA \naddressee shown below or at http://www.RegInfo.gov. PRA ADDRESSEE: G. Christopher \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 85 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     84  \n \nCosby, Office of Policy and Research, U.S. Department of Labor, Employee Benefits Security \nAdministration, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Room N-5718, Washington, DC 20210. \nTelephone: 202-693-8410; Fax: 202-219-4745. These are not toll-free numbers. \nConsistent with the analysis in the HHS PRA section above, although these interim final \nrules make entities with certain moral convictions eligible for the accommodation, we assume \nthat no entities will use it rather than the exemption, and such entities were not previously \neligible for the accommodation so as to revoke it.  Therefore we believe these interim final rules \ndo not involve additional burden not accounted for under OMB control number 1210-0150.   \nRegarding the ICRs discussed in the companion interim final rules concerning religious \nbeliefs issued contemporaneously with these interim final rules and published elsewhere in this \nissue of the Federal Register, the forms for which would be used if any entities with moral \nobjections used the accommodation process in the future, DOL submitted those ICRs in order to \nobtain OMB approval under the PRA for the regulatory revision.  The request was made under \nemergency clearance procedures specified in regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13. OMB approved the \nICRs under the emergency clearance process.  In an effort to consolidate the number of \ninformation collection requests, DOL indicated it will combine the ICR related to the OMB \ncontrol number 1210-0152 with the ICR related to the OMB control number 1210-0150. Once \nthe ICR is approved, DOL indicated it will discontinue 1210-0152. OMB approved the ICR \nunder control number 1210-0150 through [DATE].  A copy of the information collection request \nmay be obtained free of charge on the RegInfo.gov website at \nhttp://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=201705-1210-001.  This approval \nallows respondents temporarily to utilize the additional flexibility these interim final regulations \nprovide, while DOL seeks public comment on the collection methods—including their utility and \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 86 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     85  \n \nburden.  Contemporaneously with the publication of these interim final rules, DOL will publish a \nnotice in the Federal Register informing the public of its intention to extend the OMB approval.  \nF.  Regulatory Reform Executive Orders 13765, 13771 and 13777 \nExecutive Order 13765 (January 20, 2017) directs that, “[t]o the maximum extent \npermitted by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) and the heads of all \nother executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities under \nthe Act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant \nexemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that \nwould impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on \nindividuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare \nservices, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or \nmedications.” In addition, agencies are directed to “take all actions consistent with law to \nminimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the [Affordable Care Act], and \nprepare to afford the States more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare \nmarket.” These interim final rules exercise the discretion provided to the Departments under the \nAffordable Care Act and other laws to grant exemptions and thereby minimize regulatory \nburdens of the Affordable Care Act on the affected entities and recipients of health care services. \nConsistent with Executive Order 13771 (82 FR 9339, February 3, 2017), we have \nestimated the costs and cost savings attributable to this interim final rule.  As discussed in more \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 87 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     86  \n \ndetail in the preceding analysis, this interim final rule lessens incremental reporting costs.57  \nTherefore, this interim final rule is considered an EO 13771 deregulatory action.   \nG.  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \nThe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (section 202(a) of Pub. L. 104-4), requires \nthe Departments to prepare a written statement, which includes an assessment of anticipated \ncosts and benefits, before issuing “any rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in \nthe expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, \nof $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year.”  The current \nthreshold after adjustment for inflation is $148 million, using the most current (2016) Implicit \nPrice Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product.  For purposes of the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct, these interim final rules do not include any Federal mandate that may result in expenditures \nby State, local, or tribal governments, nor do they include any Federal mandates that may impose \nan annual burden of $100 million, adjusted for inflation, or more on the private sector. \nH.  Federalism \nExecutive Order 13132 outlines fundamental principles of federalism, and requires the \nadherence to specific criteria by Federal agencies in the process of their formulation and \nimplementation of policies that have “substantial direct effects” on States, the relationship \n                                                           \n57 Other noteworthy potential impacts encompass potential changes in medical expenditures, including potential \ndecreased expenditures on contraceptive devices and drugs and potential increased expenditures on pregnancy-\nrelated medical services.  OMB’s guidance on EO 13771 implementation (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-\noffice/2017/04/05/memorandum-implementing-executive-order-13771-titled-reducing-regulation) states that \nimpacts should be categorized as consistently as possible within Departments.  The Food and Drug Administration, \nwithin HHS, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration (MSHA), within DOL, regularly estimate medical expenditure impacts in the analyses that \naccompany their regulations, with the results being categorized as benefits (positive benefits if expenditures are \nreduced, negative benefits if expenditures are raised).  Following the FDA, OSHA and MSHA accounting \nconvention leads to this interim final rule’s medical expenditure impacts being categorized as (positive or negative) \nbenefits, rather than as costs, thus placing them outside of consideration for EO 13771 designation purposes. \n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-2   Filed 01/02/18   Page 88 of 101\nCMS-9925-IFC     87  \n \nbetween the Federal Government and States, or the distribution of power and responsibilities \namong the various levels of Government.  Federal agencies promulgating regulations that have \nthese federalism implications must consult with state and local officials, and describe the extent \nof their consultation and the nature of the concerns of state and local officials in the preamble to \nthe regulation. \nThese interim final rules do not have any Federalism implications, since they only \nprovide exemptions from the contraceptive and sterilization coverage requirement in HRSA \nGuidelines supplied under section 2713 of the PHS Act. \nVI.

However, the law recognizes and HHS understands the need to take into \naccount the unique health needs of women throughout their lifespan.\nThe HRSA-supported health plan coverage guidelines, developed by the Institute of Medicine \n(IOM), will help ensure that women receive a comprehensive set of preventive services without \nhaving to pay a co-payment, co-insurance or a deductible. HHS commissioned an IOM study to \nreview what preventive services are necessary for women’s health and well-being and therefore \nshould be considered in the development of comprehensive guidelines for preventive services \nfor women.

Policy. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously \nenforce Federal law’s robust protections for religious freedom. The Founders \nenvisioned  a  Nation  in  which  religious  voices  and  views  were  integral \nto a vibrant public square, and in which religious people and institutions \nwere free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation \nby the Federal Government. For that reason, the United States Constitution \nenshrines and protects the fundamental right to religious liberty as Ameri-\ncans’  first  freedom.  Federal  law  protects  the  freedom  of  Americans  and \ntheir organizations to exercise religion and participate fully in civic life \nwithout undue interference by the Federal Government. The executive branch \nwill honor and enforce those protections. \nSec. 2. Respecting Religious and Political Speech. All executive departments \nand agencies (agencies) shall, to the greatest extent practicable and to the \nextent permitted by law, respect and protect the freedom of persons and \norganizations to engage in religious and political speech. In particular, the \nSecretary  of  the  Treasury  shall  ensure,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law, \nthat the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against \nany individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the \nbasis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral \nor  political  issues  from  a  religious  perspective,  where  speech  of  similar \ncharacter has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation \nor intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) \na candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury. As used \nin  this  section,  the  term  ‘‘adverse  action’’  means  the  imposition  of  any \ntax or tax penalty; the delay or denial of tax-exempt status; the disallowance \nof tax deductions for contributions made to entities exempted from taxation \nunder section 501(c)(3) of title 26, United States Code; or any other action \nthat makes unavailable or denies any tax deduction, exemption, credit, or \nbenefit. \nSec.  3.  Conscience  Protections  with  Respect  to  Preventive-Care  Mandate. \nThe Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services shall consider issuing amended regulations, \nconsistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to \nthe preventive-care mandate promulgated under section 300gg–13(a)(4) of \ntitle 42, United States Code. \nSec. 4. Religious Liberty Guidance. In order to guide all agencies in complying \nwith relevant Federal law, the Attorney General shall, as appropriate, issue \nE0 guidance interpreting religious liberty protections in Federal law. \nwith \nD  Sec. 5. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of \nO\nR\nP any  provision  to  any  individual  or  circumstance,  is  held  to  be  invalid, \nK30JT082 ttho e anreym  oatihnedre ri nodfi vtihdius alosr doerr  cainrcdu mthseta nacpepsl icsahtailoln  nooft   ibtes  aoftfheecrt edp rothveisrieobnys.  \nS\nD\nmstockstill on VerDate Sep<11>2014  20:08 May 08, 2017 Jkt 241001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4790 Sfmt 4790 E:\\FR\\FM\\09MYE0.SGM 09MYE0\nExhibit D\n\nCase 2:17-cv-01510-RBL   Document 45-4   Filed 01/02/18   Page 3 of 3\n21676  Federal Register/Vol. 82, No. 88/Tuesday, May 9, 2017/Presidential Documents \nSec.  6.
