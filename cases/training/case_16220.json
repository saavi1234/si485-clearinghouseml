    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit, brought on October 10, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenged President Trump's revocation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The plaintiffs were Santa Clara County and a labor union representing thousands of county employees, and they sought to enjoin the government from ending the program. Not only did the DACA recipients stand to lose benefits and security they had relied upon, but the plaintiffs argued that their employers and communities stood to lose the benefits these recipients provided to them. As a result, the plaintiffs contended that revoking DACA violated Fifth Amendment due process, equal protection, and the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought equitable estoppel, injunctive relief, and a declaratory judgment. </p><p>In 2012, the Obama administration created the DACA program via DHS policy statements. The program offered work permits and temporary protection from deportation to undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children. As of 2017, there were an estimated 800,000 DACA recipients. On September 5, 2017, President Trump announced that he was ending the program in March unless Congress acted within the next six months. As the complaint highlights, the Obama administration promoted DACA by making key promises to immigrants: that any information they provided in the application process would not be used for immigration enforcement, and that barring criminal activity or fraud in their DACA applications, DACA recipients would be able to renew their status and keep their benefits.</p><p>The plaintiff Santa Clara stated that 38% of its residents are born outside of the U.S., and that its high immigrant population meant that DACA’s rescission would be particularly harmful to the county. The other plaintiff, Service Employees International Union Local 521 (Local 521), was a labor union that represents over 10,000 individuals employed by Santa Clara county. Local 521 joined the suit to protect the rights of its current and future members, and to act on their behalf. The plaintiffs argued that DACA recipients had come to rely on the program and on the assurances that their private application information would not be used against them, but that both their ability to receive important benefits and be safe from deportation were put in danger. The plaintiffs further argued that the government did not provide sound rationale for its decision to rescind DACA, and that this decision was clearly driven by racial animus.</p><p>The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Howard R. Lloyd. On October 16, the case was related to the other DACA cases under Judge William Alsup. This case was also reassigned to him. The related cases are: <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16144\">State of California v. Department of Homeland Security</a> (No. 17-cv-5235), <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16160\">Garcia v. USA</a> (No. 17-cv-5380), <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16156\">City of San Jose v. Trump</a> (No. 17-cv-05329), and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\">Regents of the University of California v. Department of Homeland Security</a> (No. 17-cv-05211); all of which are in this Clearinghouse.</p><p>On October 6, in a related challenge led by Regents of University of California before this judge, the government filed the administrative record, available <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-NY-0051-0008.pdf\">here</a>, which included a series of government documents pertaining to DACA—from its inception to the decision to rescind it. On October 17, after the University in the related case moved to compel the defendants to complete the administrative record, the court ordered them to do so in all related cases, including this one. The court found that the defendants did not produce all documents leading to the rescission, specifically documents that Acting Secretary Duke did not directly review. On October 18, the defendants moved to stay further proceedings at this court in light of their intent to appeal this ruling to the Ninth Circuit. The court declined to enter a stay, and the defendants appealed by filing a petition for a writ of mandamus to the district court and emergency motion for stay. On October 23, the district court replied to the Ninth Circuit's invitation to answer the government's petition stating it would not stay proceedings in light of the narrow window of time until the DACA was scheduled to end on March 5, 2018.</p><p>On November 16, the Ninth Circuit denied the defendants' motion for a writ of mandamus and vacated the stay of discovery and record expansion that had been entered. The District Court immediately ordered the federal government to file an augmented administrative record by November 22. On November 17, the federal government filed an emergency motion noting that it intended to file an application for mandamus with the Supreme Court, and requesting that the Ninth Circuit stay its order pending the Supreme Court's resolution of the forthcoming petition. On November 21, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the federal government's motion, noting that jurisdiction was with the District Court and instructing the federal government that further relief must be sought in a new petition for mandamus. </p><p>Meanwhile, in the District Court, Judge Alsup on November 20 agreed to stay all discovery until December 22, at which point the augmented administrative record was due. </p><p>On December 1, 2017, the government filed notice that they appealed the Ninth's Circuit denial of mandamus relief and applied for a stay to the Supreme Court. On December 21 in a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's denial and remanded the case, arguing that the district court should have stayed implementation of the October 17 order compelling the government to complete the administrative record. The Supreme Court stated that the lower court should have \"first resolved the Government’s threshold arguments\" (that the Acting Secretary’s determination to rescind DACA was unreviewable because it was \"committed to agency discretion,\" 5 U.S.C. §701(a)(2), and that the Immigration and Nationality Act deprived the District Court of jurisdiction). \"Either of those arguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for the District Court to examine a complete administrative record.\" 138 S.Ct. 443 (2017). The same day, the district court stayed the order compelling the government to complete the administrative record. </p><p>On January 9, 2018, the court denied the government's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction from November 2017 and provided provisional relief to the plaintiffs. The order indicated the court would separately dismiss the government's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court ordered a nationwide preliminary injunction, ordering that DACA remain in effect on the same terms and conditions that existed prior to the rescission. However, the government did not need to process new applications from individuals who never before received deferred action. The court then granted in part and denied in part the government's motion to dismiss on January 12, dismissing the plaintiffs'  Regulatory Flexibility Act and equitable estoppel claims, as well as the individual plaintiffs' declaratory relief claims. The court sustained the plaintiffs' APA, due process, and equal protection claims (with a few exceptions from the various complaints of the related cases). </p><p>The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit one week later. The government also sought certiorari from the Supreme Court on January 18 while the Ninth Circuit appeal was pending, arguing that the Supreme Court's immediate review was warranted because of how long the appeal would take in the Ninth Circuit and how time sensitive the issue was. The Supreme Court denied cert without prejudice on February 26, 2018, indicating the justices assumed \"that the Court of Appeals will proceed expeditiously to decide this case.\"</p><p>The related cases were consolidated in the Ninth Circuit for the purposes of appeal. In February and March 2018, the parties and amici filed their briefs, which can be found <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\">here</a>.</p><p>The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's rulings on November 8, 2018. The panel held that the government's decision to rescind DACA was reviewable because it was based on a belief that law foreclosed any alternative because the agency lacked authority rather than an exercise of discretion. The panel further concluded the decision was reviewable because the government based rescission only on the belief that DACA went beyond DHS' authority and so the APA's bar did not apply, and the decision did not fall within the three discrete occasions when the INA bars judicial review of DHS decisions. As to the merits of preliminary injunction, the panel held that \"DACA was a permissible exercise of executive discretion\" and the government's belief that DACA was illegal was wrong. 908 F.3d 476. Thus, the panel concluded the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The panel also held that a nationwide injunction was appropriate because it \"promotes uniformity in immigration enforcement, and is necessary to provide the plaintiffs here with complete redress.\" Id. </p><p>The defendants petitioned the Supreme Court of the U.S. for a writ of certiorari on Nov. 5, 2018.</p><p>On June 28, 2019, the Supreme Court granted writs of certiorari in three DACA cases: <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16132\"><i>Regents of University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i></a>, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462\"><i>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</i></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16162\"><i>NAACP v. Trump</i></a>, all of which were pending before different circuit courts of appeal. The Court consolidated the three cases (No. 18-587). </p><p>The Supreme Court heard oral argument on November 12, 2019, on the issues of whether DHS's decision to wind down the DACA policy is judicially reviewable and whether DHS’s decision to rescind DACA is lawful. On June 18, 2020, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts (joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor), the Court held that the DACA rescission was subject to judicial review under the APA, that the DHS secretary had offered insufficient justification to rescind the program, and that the rescission was unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious in violation fo the APA. 140 S. Ct. 1891. </p><p>Following the Supreme Court's decision, in another case challenging the DACA recession, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16202\"><i>Casa De Maryland v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i></a>, the Fourth Circuit issued a mandate to reinstate DACA and set aside the recession memo on a nationwide basis on June 30, 2020. On July 17, 2020, the District Court of Maryland ordered DHS to reinstate DACA as it existed before the issuance of the recession memo and ordered DHS to resume accepting initial DACA applications.</p><p>However, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf instead issued a memorandum entitled \"Reconsideration of the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled 'Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\" on July 28, 2020 (\"Wolf Memorandum\"). In this memo, Acting Secretary Wolf stated that he would reconsider DACA's future in light of the Supreme Court's decision. In the interim, the memo instructed USCIS to reject all initial requests for DACA, to only grant advance parole to current DACA beneficiaries in exceptional circumstances, and grant DACA renewals for only one-year, rather than two-year, periods. Later in August, Deputy Director for Policy for USCIS Joseph Edlow issued a memorandum implementing the Wolf Memorandum.</p><p>On August 4, 2020, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further action consistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court. </p><p>In response to the Wolf Memorandum, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 2, 2020. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs substituted some of the defendants to reflect new individuals occupying the relevant roles and to add additional responsible officials, including Deputy Director for Policy Edlow. The amended complaint argued that Acting Secretary Wolf's actions were invalid under the Federal Vacancies Reform Action, Homeland Security Act, and the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because he lacked proper authority to issue the Wolf Memorandum. In addition, the plaintiffs argued that the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Memorandum violated the APA because Wolf and Edlow acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and an injunction preventing the defendants from altering or limiting DACA program and vacating the Wolf and Edlow Memoranda.</p><p>Before any additional activity on the amended complaint in this case, on December 4, the court in another case challenging the Wolf Memorandum,<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462\">Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16130\">State of New York v. Trump</a>, ordered DHS to fully reinstate DACA as it existed prior to the attempted recession in September 2017 after it found that Acting Secretary Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary. The order required DHS to accept initial DACA applications, accept advance parole applications, and grant DACA renewals for two-years.  On December 7, 2020 <a href = \"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/consideration-of-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-daca\">USCIS</a> updated their website and indicated that effective that day, USCIS would accept initial applications, extend one-year DACA renewals to two-years, and accept applications for advance parole.</p><p>Then, in early 2021, President Biden took office. On the day of his inauguration (January 20, 2021), President Biden signed a memorandum directing DHS and the Attorney General “to preserve and fortify DACA.” In light of potential additional agency action to implement the memorandum, the parties filed a joint stipulation to stay further proceedings and vacate pending deadlines on March 22, 2021. They agreed to provide the court with status updates every 60 days. The first is due May 24, 2021. This case is ongoing.</p>",

Decided December 20, 2017\n  PER CURIAM. \n  This case arises from five related lawsuits that chal-\nlenge a determination adopted by the Acting Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The deter-\nmination, announced by the Acting Secretary, is to take \nimmediate steps to rescind a program known as Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, by March 5, 2018.  \nThe Acting Secretary stated that her determination was \nbased in part on the Attorney General’s conclusion that \nDACA is unlawful and likely would be enjoined in poten-\ntially imminent litigation. \n  The five suits were filed in the United States District \nCourt  for  the  Northern  District  of  California,  and  the \nplaintiffs in those actions are the respondents in the mat-\nter now before this Court.  The defendants in the District \nCourt,  and  the  petitioners  here,  include  the  Govern- \nment of the United States, the Acting Secretary, and the \nPresident of the United States, all referred to here as the \nGovernment. \n  In the District Court litigation respondents argue that \nthe Acting Secretary’s determination to rescind DACA in \nthe near future is unlawful because, among other reasons, \nit violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, including \nthe equal protection guarantee implicit in that Clause. \n  The issue to be considered here involves respondents’ \ncontention that the administrative record the Government \nfiled to support the Acting Secretary’s determination to \nrescind DACA is incomplete.  The record consists of 256 \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901578,1 132-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 4853 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  22  ooff  44\n2  IN RE UNITED STATES \n   \nPer Curiam \npages of documents, and the Government contends that it \ncontains all of the nondeliberative material considered by \nthe  Acting  Secretary  in  reaching  her  determination.  \n(Nearly  200  pages  consist  of  published  opinions  from \nvarious federal courts.) \n  On  October  17,  the  District  Court,  on  respondents’ \nmotion, ordered the Government to complete the adminis-\ntrative record.  See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Department \nof Homeland Security, App. C to Pet. for Mandamus, 2017 \nWL 4642324 (ND Cal., Oct. 17, 2017) (District Court Or-\nder).  The details of that order are recounted further be-\nlow.  See infra, at 3. \n  The Government petitioned for a writ of mandamus in \nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The Court of \nAppeals, in a divided opinion, denied the Government’s \npetition.  See 875 F. 3d 1200 (2017). \n  On November 19, three days after the Court of Appeals \nissued its opinion, respondents moved the District Court \nto stay its order requiring completion of the administra-\ntive  record  until  after  the  District  Court  resolved  the \nGovernment’s motion to dismiss and respondents’ motion \nfor a preliminary injunction.  See Motion to Stay in No. \n17–cv–5211 (Nov. 19, 2017), Doc. 190.  The District Court \ndid  not  grant  respondents’  request,  instead  staying  its \norder for one month. \n  Still objecting to the District Court’s order, the Govern-\nment now seeks relief in this Court.  It has filed here a \npetition for a writ of mandamus to the District Court, or, \nin the alternative, for a writ of certiorari to the Court of \nAppeals. \n  The Court now grants the petition for a writ of certiorari, \nvacates the order of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit, and remands the case. \n  The District Court’s October 17 order requires the Gov-\nernment  to  turn  over  all  “emails,  letters,  memoranda, \nnotes, media items, opinions and other materials” that fall \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901578,1 132-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 4853 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  33  ooff  44\n  Cite as: 583 U.

Under the specific facts of this \ncase, the District Court should have granted respondents’ \nmotion  on  November  19  to  stay  implementation  of  the \nchallenged October 17 order and first resolved the Gov-\nernment’s  threshold  arguments  (that  the  Acting  Secre-\ntary’s  determination  to  rescind  DACA  is  unreviewable \nbecause it is “committed to agency discretion,” 5 U. S. C. \n§701(a)(2), and that the Immigration and Nationality Act \ndeprives the District Court of jurisdiction).  Either of those \narguments, if accepted, likely would eliminate the need for \nthe District Court to examine a complete administrative \nrecord.  \n\nC  Casaes e3:: 1177--c7v2-901578,1 132-W/20H/A20  1 D7o, cIDu:m 1e0n6t9 4853 9  9F,i leDdk t1E2n/t2r1y:/ 1474 ,   PPaaggee  44  ooff  44\n4  IN RE UNITED STATES \n   \nPer Curiam \n  On remand of the case, the Court of Appeals shall take \nappropriate  action  so  that  the  following  steps  can  be \ntaken.  The District Court should proceed to rule on the \nGovernment’s threshold arguments and, in doing so, may \nconsider  certifying  that  ruling  for  interlocutory  appeal \nunder 28 U. S. C. §1292(b) if appropriate.   Thereafter, the \nCourt of Appeals or the District Court in the first instance \nmay consider whether narrower amendments to the record \nare necessary and appropriate.  In any event, the District \nCourt  may  not  compel  the  Government  to  disclose  any \ndocument  that  the  Government  believes  is  privileged \nwithout first providing the Government with the oppor-\ntunity to argue the issue. \n  This order does not suggest any view on the merits of \nrespondents’ claims or the Government’s defenses, or that \nthe District Court’s rulings on the Government’s motion to \ndismiss and respondents’ motion for preliminary injunc-\ntion should be delayed. \n  The  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth \nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nIt is so ordered.

This program received the\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 2 of 49\n1 title “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” — DACA for short.  In 2017, however, after the\n2 national election and change in administrations, the agency eventually reversed itself and began\n3 a phase-out of DACA.  All agree that a new administration is entitled to replace old policies\n4 with new policies so long as they comply with the law.  One question presented in these related\n5 actions is whether the new administration terminated DACA based on a mistake of law rather\n6 than in compliance with the law.\n7 1. HISTORY OF DEFERRED ACTION.\n8 At the core of these cases is an administrative practice known as “deferred action.” \n9 A primary question presented concerns the extent to which the Department of Homeland\n10 Security could lawfully use deferred action to implement DACA, and so it is important to review\nt 11 the history of deferred action as well as of other features of the DACA program.  \nr\nu\no a 12 Congress has the constitutional power to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.” \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Art. I, § 8, cl. 4.  Pursuant thereto, Congress has established a comprehensive scheme governing\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 immigration and naturalization through the Immigration and Nationality Act.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1101,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 et seq.  The Secretary of Homeland Security is “charged with the administration and enforcement\nS N 16 of [the INA] and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens.” \nted  For the  17 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1).  The Secretary is further charged with “establishing national immigration\ni\nn\nU\n18 enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).   \n19 One of the key enforcement tools under the INA is removal, i.e., deportation.  In turn,\n20 “[a] principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration\n21 officials.”  Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 396 (2012).  As an initial matter, in any given\n22 case, immigration officials “must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.”  Ibid. \n23 At each stage of the removal process, they have “discretion to abandon the endeavor.”  Reno v.\n24 Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483 (1999) (“AADC”).  \n25 Beginning as early as 1975, one way to exercise this discretion became “deferred action.” \n26 By deferred action, immigration officials could postpone, seemingly indefinitely, the removal of\n27 individuals unlawfully present in the United States “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [the\n28\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 3 of 49\n1 Executive’s] own convenience.”  Id. at 483–84.  Immigration officials could also grant parole,\n2 temporary protected status, deferred enforced departure, or extended voluntary departure.  \n3 Some of these discretionary powers have flowed from statute.  Parole, for example,\n4 has allowed otherwise inadmissible aliens to temporarily enter the United States “for urgent\n5 humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  Temporary\n6 protected status, also created by statute, has been available to nationals of designated foreign\n7 states affected by armed conflicts, environmental disasters, and other extraordinary conditions. \n8 8 U.S.C. § 1254a.  \n9 Some of these discretionary powers, however, have flowed from nonstatutory powers. \n10 Deferred enforced departure had no statutory basis but, instead, grew out of “the President’s\nt 11 constitutional powers to conduct foreign relations.”  USCIS, Adjudicator’s Field Manual\nr\nu\no a 12 § 38.2(a) (2014).  Nor has extended voluntary departure been anchored in any statute.  Rather,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 it has been recognized as part of the discretion of the Attorney General.  Hotel & Restaurant\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Employees Union, Local 25 v. Smith, 846 F.2d 1499, 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc).  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Deferred action, originally known as “nonpriority” status, also began “without express\nS N 16 statutory authorization” but has since been recognized by the Supreme Court as a “regular\nted  For the  17 practice.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 484.  Congress has also acknowledged deferred action by explicit\ni\nn\nU\n18 reference to it in the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1227(d)(2)):\n19 The denial of a request for an administrative stay of removal under\nthis subsection shall not preclude the alien from applying for a stay\n20 of removal, deferred action, or a continuance or abeyance of\nremoval proceedings under any other provision of the immigration\n21 laws of the United States.\n22 Another federal statute, the REAL ID Act, also acknowledged deferred action.  REAL ID\n23 Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, div. B, 119 Stat. 231.  This law provided that states could issue\n24 a temporary driver’s license or identification card to persons who can demonstrate an\n25 “authorized stay in the United States.”  Id. §§ 202(c)(2)(C)(i)–(ii).  Persons with “approved\n26 deferred action status” were expressly identified as being present in the United States during a\n27 “period of authorized stay,” for the purpose of issuing state identification cards.  Id. §§\n28 202(c)(2)(B)(viii), (C)(ii).  \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 4 of 49\n1 Congress has also given the Executive Branch broad discretion to determine when\n2 noncitizens may work in the United States.  Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053,\n3 1062 (9th Cir. 2014) (“Brewer I”); see 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3) (defining an “unauthorized alien”\n4 not entitled to work in the United States as an alien who is neither a legal permanent resident\n5 nor “authorized to be . . . employed by [the INA] or by the [Secretary of Homeland Security]”). \n6 Pursuant to this statutory authority, regulations promulgated in the 1980s allowed recipients of\n7 deferred action to apply for work authorization if they could demonstrate an “economic necessity\n8 for employment.”  8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  \n9 The George W. Bush Administration began to use deferred action to mitigate a harsh\n10 statutory provision involving “unlawful presence.”  The Illegal Immigration Reform and\nt 11 Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 created three- and ten-year bars on the admission of\nr\nu\no a 12 aliens who departed or were removed from the United States after periods of “unlawful\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 presence” of between 180 days and one year, or more than one year, respectively.  8 U.S.C.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i).  It also imposed a permanent bar on the admission of any alien who,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 without being admitted, entered or attempted to reenter the United States after having been\nS N 16 unlawfully present for an aggregate period of more than one year.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i). \nted  For the  17 Beginning in 2007, however, DHS regulations and policy guidance provided that deferred action\ni\nn\nU\n18 recipients did not accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on re-entry. \n19 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(3); 28 C.F.R. § 1100.35(b)(2); Memorandum for Field Leadership,\n20 from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, Domestic Operations Directorate, USCIS,\n21 Re: Consolidation of Guidance Concerning Unlawful Presence for Purposes of Sections\n22 212(a)(9)(B)(i) and 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(i) of the Act at 42 (May 6, 2009).  DHS excluded recipients\n23 of deferred action from being “unlawfully present” because their deferred action is a period of\n24 stay authorized by the government.  Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1059 (citing 8 U.S.C.\n25 § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii)).  This nonaccrual practice arose well before DACA.1  \n26\n27\n1  Undocumented aliens do not begin to accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of\n28\nSection 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) until they reach the age of eighteen.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(iii).\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 5 of 49\n1 DACA grew out of a long agency history of discretionary relief programs.  In 1956, the\n2 Eisenhower Administration paroled roughly one thousand foreign-born orphans who had been\n3 adopted by American citizens but were precluded from entering the United States because of\n4 statutory quotas.  That same administration later granted parole to tens of thousands of\n5 Hungarian refugees after the unsuccessful Hungarian revolution.  Both programs flowed from\n6 presidential statements, and the programs later ended (in 1959 and 1958, respectively) when\n7 Congress passed laws enabling the paroled individuals to become lawful permanent residents\n8 (App. 1602–03, 1948–57; AR 33).2 \n9 In 1987, President Ronald Reagan instituted the Family Fairness Program, a non-\n10 statutory program that provided extended voluntary departure to children whose parents were in\nt 11 the process of legalizing their immigration status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act\nr\nu\no a 12 of 1986.  President George H.W. Bush extended the non-statutory program in 1990 to cover\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 spouses of such legalized aliens, and the program ultimately provided immigration relief to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 approximately 1.5 million people.  The need for the program ended with the passage of the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Immigration Act of 1990 (App. 1607, 1612–13, 1703).\nS N 16 On at least four occasions prior to the creation of DACA, immigration officials have\nted  For the  17 extended deferred action programs to certain classes of aliens, none of which programs was\ni\nn\nU\n18 expressly authorized by statute:  \n19 • In 1997, INS established a deferred action program for individuals\n20 self-petitioning for relief under the Violence Against Women Act of\n21 1994.  This program is still in place today.  As originally enacted, the\n22 Act did not mention deferred action, but instead provided a pathway\n23 to lawful permanent residency.  Deferred action allowed applicants\n24 to remain in the country pending a decision on their applications. \n25\n26\n2  “App.” refers to the appendix submitted in support of plaintiffs’ motion for provisional relief (Dkt.\nNos. 113, 117–19, 121, 124).  In connection with their motion for provisional relief, plaintiffs seek judicial\n27\nnotice of thirty-nine exhibits submitted with the appendix (Dkt. No. 111-2).  The request is unopposed. \nThese exhibits consist of congressional testimony and government publications, memoranda, and press releases. \n28\nPlaintiffs’ request for judicial notice is GRANTED. \n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 6 of 49\n1 Congress later expanded the deferred action program in the 2000\n2 VAWA reauthorization legislation (App. at 1640–46).\n3 • In 2002 and 2003, INS issued memoranda instructing officers to make\n4 deferred action assessments for T visa applicants (victims of human\n5 trafficking) and U visa applicants (victims of crimes such as domestic\n6 violence) (App. 1650–58).  These programs have since been codified in\n7 regulations promulgated by INS and DHS. 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.11(k)(1),\n8 (k)(4), (m)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2).\n9 • After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, USCIS announced a deferred action\n10 program for certain foreign students (F-1 visa holders) who, because of\nt 11 the hurricane, could not satisfy the requirements of their student visas. \nr\nu\no a 12 In announcing the program, USCIS stated that “[t]he interim relief\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 [would] remain in effect until February 1, 2006” (App. 1661–62).\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 • In 2009, to fill a gap under the law, USCIS established a deferred\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 action program for widowed spouses who had been married to United\nS N 16 States citizens for less than two years.  Congress later eliminated the\nted  For the  17 statutory requirement that an alien be married to a United States citizen\ni\nn\nU\n18 for at least two years at the time of the citizen’s death to retain\n19 eligibility for lawful immigration status, and USCIS accordingly\n20 withdrew the deferred action program as “obsolete” (App. 1664–82). \n21 In sum, by the time DACA arrived in 2012, deferred action programs had become a\n22 well-accepted feature of the executive’s enforcement of our immigration laws, recognized as\n23 such by Congress and the Supreme Court. \n24 2. DACA.\n25 On June 15, 2012, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a\n26 memorandum establishing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.  Under DACA, immigrants\n27 brought to the United States as children could apply for deferred action for a two-year period,\n28 subject to renewal.  To qualify for DACA, an individual must:  (1) have come to the United\n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 7 of 49\n1 States before the age of sixteen and been under the age of thirty-one on June 15, 2012;\n2 (2) have been present in the United States on June 15, 2012; (3) have been continuously residing\n3 in the United States for at least the prior five years; (4) have been enrolled in school, graduated\n4 from high school, obtained a GED, or been honorably discharged from the United States military\n5 or Coast Guard; and (5) not pose a threat to national security or public safety (AR 1).\n6 The 2012 DACA memo described the program as an exercise of “prosecutorial\n7 discretion.”  Secretary Napolitano found leniency “especially justified” for the DACA-eligible,\n8 whom she described as “productive young people” who “have already contributed to our country\n9 in significant ways.”  The memo further stated that these individuals “lacked the intent to violate\n10 the law” and were low priority cases for deportation (AR 1–2).\nt 11 DACA applicants had to pass a DHS background check and applications had to be\nr\nu\no a 12 “decided on a case by case basis.”  To apply for DACA, eligible individuals completed USCIS\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Form I-821D.  The application called for substantial personal information, such as biographical\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 information, date of entry into the United States, immigration status or lack thereof, educational\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 history, and all prior residential addresses since entering the United States.\nS N 16   Form I-821D also required substantial documentary support, including proof of identity\nted  For the  17 and proof of continuous residence in the United States through rent receipts, utility bills,\ni\nn\nU\n18 employment documents, or similar records.  Applicants also appeared at a USCIS field office\n19 to provide fingerprints, photographs, and signatures.  The form’s instructions stated (App. 1820):\n20 Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure\nto ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the\n21 purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings unless the\nrequestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear\n22 or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS’ Notice to\nAppear guidance (www.uscis.gov/NTA).  The information may be\n23 shared with national security and law enforcement agencies,\nincluding ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal,\n24 including for assistance in the consideration of deferred action for\nchildhood arrivals request itself, to identify or prevent fraudulent\n25 claims, for national security purposes, or for the investigation or\nprosecution of a criminal offense.  The above information sharing\n26 clause covers family members and guardians, in addition to the\nrequestor.  \n27\n28\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 8 of 49\n1 The form’s instructions also stated (App. 1808):\n2 Individuals who receive deferred action will not be placed into\nremoval proceedings or removed from the United States for a\n3 specified period of time, unless the Department of Homeland\nSecurity (DHS) chooses to terminate the deferral.\n4\nDACA applicants also submitted a Form I-765, Application for Employment\n5\nAuthorization, a Form I-765WS, Worksheet, and the accompanying fees.  To determine an\n6\napplicant’s eligibility for work authorization, USCIS reviewed the applicant’s current annual\n7\nincome, current annual expenses, and the total current value of his or her assets (App. 1762,\n8\n1801–21, 2067–87). \n9\nIf approved, the recipient received a Form I-797, Notice of Action, stating (App. 585):\n10\nUSCIS, in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, has decided\nt 11 to defer action in your case.  Deferred action is an exercise of\nr\nu prosecutorial discretion by USCIS not to pursue the removal of an\no a 12 individual from the United States for a specific period.  Deferred\nC ni\n  or action does not confer or alter any immigration status.  \nct alif 13  \ni C\ntr of  Significantly, DHS could terminate a recipient’s deferred action at any time, at the\n Dis District  14 agency’s discretion, and DACA paved no pathway to lawful permanent residency, much less\ntates orthern  15 citizenship (App. 1774, 1808).  Secretary Napolitano concluded her DACA memorandum\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 (AR 1–3):\ni\nn This memorandum confers no substantive right, immigration status\nU\n18 or pathway to citizenship.  Only the Congress, acting through its\nlegislative authority, can confer these rights.  It remains for the\n19 executive branch, however, to set forth policy for the exercise of\ndiscretion within the framework of the existing law.  I have done\n20 so here.\n21 But DACA did provide important benefits.  First, under pre-existing regulations, DACA\n22 recipients became eligible to receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action,\n23 thereby allowing them to obtain social security numbers and to become legitimate taxpayers and\n24 contributing members of our open economy.  8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  Second, deferred action\n25 provided a measure of safety for a period of two years from detention and removal, albeit always\n26 subject to termination at any time in any individual case.  Third, DACA recipients could apply\n27 for “advance parole” to obtain permission to travel overseas and be paroled back into the United\n28 States.  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f).  Fourth, also pursuant to pre-existing regulations, DACA recipients\n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 9 of 49\n1 avoided accrual of time for “unlawful presence” under the INA’s bar on re-entry.  8 U.S.C.\n2 § 1182(a)(9)(B)–(C) (establishing three-year, ten-year, and permanent bars on the admission\n3 of aliens after specified periods of “unlawful presence”). \n4 USCIS “strongly encourage[d]” DACA recipients to submit renewal requests between\n5 120 and 150 days before the expiration date-stamped on the recipient’s Form I-797.  According\n6 to the “Frequently Asked Questions” posted on the agency’s website, recipients were eligible for\n7 renewal under DACA so long as they:  (1) did not depart the United States on or after August 15,\n8 2012, without advance parole; (2) continuously resided in the United States since submitting\n9 their most recent DACA request; and (3) had not received criminal convictions (with minor\n10 exceptions).  Renewal requests did not require additional documentary support (App. 1756–57).\nt 11 The agency adopted DACA without any notice or opportunity for public comment.\nr\nu\no a 12 According to data published by USCIS, 793,026 applicants received deferred action\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 under DACA since its inception.  As of September 2017, there remained approximately 689,800\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 active DACA recipients.  Their average age was 23.8.  Based on a survey completed by\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Associate Professor Tom K. Wong in August 2017, 91 percent of DACA recipients had jobs,\nS N 16 and 45 percent of DACA recipients were enrolled in school (App. 1494–1522, 1533–52).  \nted  For the  17 3. THE DAPA LITIGATION.  \ni\nn\nU\n18 In 2014, DHS announced a different deferred action program for parents of United States\n19 citizens or lawful permanent residents, titled “Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and\n20 Lawful Permanent Residents” — shortened to the confusingly-similar acronym DAPA.  \n21 For our purposes, DAPA is important because the United States Court of Appeals for\n22 the Fifth Circuit promptly held that DAPA exceeded the statutory authority of DHS, a holding\n23 that eventually moved Attorney General Jeff Sessions to rule that DACA too had exceeded the\n24 agency’s authority.  Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015). \n25 The 2014 DAPA memo directed USCIS “to establish a process, similar to DACA, for\n26 exercising prosecutorial discretion through the use of deferred action, on a case-by-case basis,”\n27 for aliens who had a son or daughter who was a United States citizen or lawful permanent\n28 resident and:  (1) were not an enforcement priority under DHS policy; (2) had continuously\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 10 of 49\n1 resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010; (3) had been physically present in the\n2 United States both when DHS announced DAPA and at the time of application to the program;\n3 and (4) presented “no other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, [made] the grant of\n4 deferred action inappropriate” (AR 37–41).  \n5 That same 2014 announcement also expanded DACA in three minor ways:  (1) allowing\n6 otherwise eligible immigrants to apply for DACA even if they were older than 31 on the day\n7 DACA was earlier announced; (2) extending DACA renewals and work authorizations from\n8 two- to three-year periods; and (3) adjusting DACA’s date-of-entry requirement from June 15,\n9 2007, to January 1, 2010 (AR 37–41).  \n10 DAPA was also adopted without notice or opportunity for public comment. \nt 11 A coalition of twenty-six states immediately filed suit in the United States District Court\nr\nu\no a 12 for the Southern District of Texas to challenge DAPA.  The district court preliminarily enjoined\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 its implementation on the ground that DHS had failed to comply with the APA’s\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 notice-and-comment requirements.  Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591 (S.D. Tex. 2015). \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The district court’s order stated that “with three minor exceptions,” the case did not involve\nS N 16 DACA (id. at 606):\nted  For the  17 The Complaint in this matter does not include the actions taken by\ni\nn Secretary Napolitano, which have to date formalized the status of\nU\n18 approximately 700,000 teenagers and young adults.  Therefore,\nthose actions are not before the Court and will not be addressed\n19 by this opinion.  Having said that, DACA will necessarily be\ndiscussed in this opinion as it is relevant to many legal issues in\n20 the present case.  For example, the States maintain that the DAPA\napplications will undergo a process identical to that used for\n21 DACA applications and, therefore, DACA’s policies and\nprocedures will be instructive for the Court as to DAPA’s\n22 implementation.\n23 In holding that DAPA violated notice-and-comment procedures, the district court held\n24 that it constituted “a new rule that substantially change[d] both the status and employability of\n25 millions” and inflicted “major costs on both states and federal government.”  It therefore should\n26 have been issued, the district court held, after notice and opportunity for public comment.  Id. at\n27 671.  Though the order focused on DAPA, it also preliminarily enjoined everything in the 2014\n28\n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 11 of 49\n1 memorandum, including the three minor ways in which DACA had been modified (but left alone\n2 the 2012 DACA program).  \n3 The Fifth Circuit affirmed in a split decision but added a further ground for affirmance. \n4 Texas, 809 F.3d at 178.  Over a dissent, the appellate panel added the ground that DAPA was\n5 substantively foreclosed by statute because the INA contained “an intricate process for illegal\n6 aliens to derive a lawful immigration classification from their children’s immigration status,”\n7 and that DAPA, by providing “the benefits of lawful presence” to undocumented immigrants\n8 “solely on account of their children’s immigration status,” was inconsistent with this statutory\n9 scheme, which provided its own pathway for lawful presence to parents of children lawfully\n10 in the United States.  Id. at 179–80, 186.  The Fifth Circuit’s holding was also based on its\nt 11 observation that “the INA does not grant the Secretary discretion to grant deferred action and\nr\nu\no a 12 lawful presence on a class-wide basis to 4.3 million otherwise removable aliens.”  Id. at 186\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 n.202.  The decision was later affirmed without opinion by an equally divided Supreme Court. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per curiam).3 \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 In February 2017, DHS Secretary John Kelly issued guidance regarding the Trump\nS N 16 Administration’s immigration enforcement priorities.  Although the guidance rescinded “all\nted  For the  17 existing conflicting directives, memoranda, or field guidance regarding the enforcement of our\ni\nn\nU\n18 immigration laws and priorities for removal,” the 2012 DACA memo and 2014 DAPA memo\n19 were explicitly left in place.  The guidance also said that the 2014 DAPA memo would “be\n20 addressed in future guidance” (AR 229–34).  \n21 In June 2017, Secretary Kelly rescinded the 2014 DAPA memo, which rescission\n22 included the 2014 expansions of DACA.  He explained: \n23 I have considered a number of factors, including the preliminary\ninjunction in this matter, the ongoing litigation, the fact that DAPA\n24 never took effect, and our new immigration enforcement priorities. \nAfter consulting with the Attorney General, and in the exercise of\n25 my discretion in establishing national immigration enforcement\npolicies and priorities, I hereby rescind the November 20, 2014,\n26 memorandum. \n27\n28\n3  Such an affirmance has no precedential value.  Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 192 (1972).  \n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 12 of 49\n1 Again, however, Secretary Kelly declared that the 2012 DACA memo would remain in effect\n2 (AR 235–37).  \n3 4. RESCISSION OF DACA.    \n4 Also in June 2017, ten of the twenty-six plaintiffs from the DAPA litigation wrote to\n5 Attorney General Jeff Sessions to demand rescission of the 2012 DACA memo.  Their letter\n6 stated that if DACA was rescinded by September 5, they would dismiss the still-pending DAPA\n7 litigation.  Otherwise, the letter threatened to try to amend their complaint to additionally\n8 challenge the legality of DACA (AR 238–40).  \n9 A day before the deadline, the Attorney General advised Acting Secretary of Homeland\n10 Security Elaine Duke via a short letter that the Obama Administration had created DACA\nt 11 “without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress’ repeated\nr\nu\no a 12 rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result,” and that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 therefore the program was an “unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.” \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 The Attorney General’s letter also referenced the preliminary injunction against DAPA, then\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 stated that “[b]ecause the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the\nS N 16 courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar\nted  For the  17 results with respect to DACA” (AR 251).  \ni\nn\nU\n18 The following day, without prior notice, the Acting Secretary rescinded DACA. \n19 The rescission was not based on any policy criticism.  Instead, it was based on the legal\n20 determination by the Attorney General.  The Acting Secretary explained that after “[t]aking into\n21 consideration the Supreme Court’s and the Fifth Circuit’s rulings in the ongoing litigation, and\n22 the September 4, 2017, letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012,\n23 DACA program should be terminated.”  She said that “[r]ecognizing the complexities associated\n24 with winding down the program,” DHS would “provide a limited window” in which it would\n25 adjudicate certain requests, but that new DACA requests and applications for employment\n26 authorization would be rejected starting immediately.  DHS would adjudicate, on a case-by-case\n27 basis, DACA renewal requests received within thirty days from beneficiaries whose DACA\n28 status would expire before March 5, 2018.  She also instructed DHS to immediately stop\n12\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 13 of 49\n1 approving new applications for advance parole.  The rescission left in place all extant grants of\n2 deferred action and work authorizations for the remainder of their validity periods (AR 252–56). \n3 Consequently, starting in March 2018, the DACA population will, over two years, dwindle down\n4 to zero. \n5 On the night of the rescission, President Trump called upon Congress specifically to\n6 enact DACA, tweeting, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama\n7 Administration was unable to do).  If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!”  During an interview\n8 earlier in 2017, President Trump had stated “we are not after the dreamers, we are after the\n9 criminals” and that “the dreamers should rest easy” (App. 1852–53, 1958). \n10 In sum, the new administration didn’t terminate DACA on policy grounds.  It terminated\nt 11 DACA over a point of law, a pithy conclusion that the agency had exceeded its statutory and\nr\nu\no a 12 constitutional authority.  An important question now presented is whether that conclusion was a\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 mistake of law.\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 5. THE INSTANT LITIGATION.\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Plaintiffs herein filed five related non-class lawsuits in this district, all now before the\nS N 16 undersigned judge.  The first commenced on September 8, brought by The Regents of the\nted  For the  17 University of California, on its own behalf and on behalf of its students, and Janet Napolitano,\ni\nn\nU\n18 in her official capacity as President of the University.  UC Plaintiffs allege they have invested\n19 considerable resources in recruiting students and staff who are DACA recipients, and that these\n20 individuals make important contributions to the University.  As DACA recipients lose their work\n21 authorizations, UC Plaintiffs allege that the University will lose significant intellectual capital\n22 and productivity.  They further allege that students who lose DACA protections will be unable\n23 “to plan for the future, apply for and obtain internships and certain financial aid and\n24 scholarships, study abroad, or work to pay their tuition and other expenses,” and as a result may\n25 withdraw from the University altogether (UC Compl. ¶¶ 4–6, 34–37, 48–49).4 \n26\n27\n4  Two additional DACA lawsuits proceed in the Eastern District of New York before Judge Nicholas\nGaraufis, State of New York v. Trump, Case No. 17-cv-05228 NGG, and Vidal v. Baran, Case No. 16-cv-04756\n28\nNGG.\n13\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 14 of 49\n1 On September 11, the States of California, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota filed suit. \n2 Plaintiff States allege that they are home to more than 238,000 DACA recipients, and that the\n3 loss of their residents’ DACA status and work authorizations will injure their public colleges\n4 and universities, upset the States’ workforces, disrupt the States’ statutory and regulatory\n5 interests, cause harm to hundreds of thousands of their residents, damage their economies,\n6 and hurt companies based in Plaintiff States (States Compl. ¶¶ 1–10).  \n7 The City of San Jose, on its own behalf and on behalf of its employees who are DACA\n8 recipients, filed its action on September 14.  San Jose alleges that it has hired DACA recipients\n9 into vital City jobs, that substantial resources were invested in training these employees, and that\n10 the City will be harmed when these employees are forced to leave the workforce (when they lose\nt 11 their work authorizations).  San Jose further alleges that it will continue to lose tax revenue as\nr\nu\no a 12 DACA recipients lose work authorizations and can no longer contribute to the City’s tax base\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 (San Jose Compl. ¶¶ 10, 28, 49–51). \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 On September 18, Individual DACA recipients Dulce Garcia, Miriam Gonzalez Avila,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Saul Jimenez Suarez, Viridiana Chabolla Mendoza, Norma Ramirez, and Jirayut\nS N 16 Latthivongskorn brought suit to challenge the termination of DACA.  Individual Plaintiffs work\nted  For the  17 and study in the fields of law, medicine, education, and psychology.  They allege that the loss of\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA will frustrate their professional goals and accomplishments.  They further allege that as a\n19 result of the rescission, they will lose access to numerous federal and state benefits, and may not\n20 be able to reside in the United States with their families.  They applied for DACA in reliance on\n21 the government’s representations that information provided under the program would not be\n22 used for purposes of immigration enforcement (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 4–9, 55, 59, 72, 78, 85, 95,\n23 128). \n24 Finally, the County of Santa Clara and the Service Employees International Union Local\n25 521 filed their complaint on October 10.  The County alleges that it employs DACA recipients,\n26 including union members, in key positions, such as in its In-Home Supportive Services Program\n27 and New Americans Fellowship Program.  The County alleges that it has expended time and\n28 money in training these employees, and that it relies on them to provide important services. \n14\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 15 of 49\n1 As DACA recipients leave the workforce, the County will lose important employees, will incur\n2 harm to its economy and suffer decreased tax revenue, and will incur the costs of increased\n3 dependency on subsidized health care and other County services.  Local 521 sues as an\n4 associational plaintiff on behalf of its members who are DACA recipients, and alleges that the\n5 Union’s organizational mission is to organize, represent, and empower employees, as well as\n6 mobilize immigration reform (Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 1, 15–20, 32, 37, 43–52). \n7 Collectively, plaintiffs assert the following claims: \n8 • The rescission violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it\n9 was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in\n10 accordance with law (UC Compl. ¶¶ 50–58; State Compl. ¶¶ 152–55;\nt 11 Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 165–84; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 67–73).\nr\nu\no a 12 • The rescission violated the APA because it was a substantive rule that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 did not comply with the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements or\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the Regulatory Flexibility Act’s mandate under 5 U.S.C. § 604 that\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 an agency publish analysis of a rule’s impact on small businesses\nS N 16 (UC Compl. ¶¶ 59–66; State Compl. ¶¶ 146–63; San Jose Compl.\nted  For the  17 ¶¶ 59–63; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 177–84).\ni\nn\nU\n18 • The rescission deprived DACA recipients of constitutionally-protected\n19 property and liberty interests without due process of law.  Plaintiffs also\n20 allege that the rescission violated due process because the government\n21 changed its policy regarding agency use of DACA-related information\n22 (UC Compl. ¶¶ 67–73; State Compl. ¶¶ 141–45; Garcia Compl.\n23 ¶¶ 133–47; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 59–66).\n24 • The rescission violates equal protection of the law because it was\n25 motivated by discriminatory animus and because it deprived DACA\n26 grantees of their substantial interests in supporting themselves and\n27 furthering their education (State Compl. ¶¶ 172–77; San Jose Compl.\n28 ¶¶ 52–58; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 148–59; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 74–78).\n15\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 16 of 49\n1 • The rescission violates equitable estoppel.  DACA recipients provided\n2 detailed personal information to the government and rearranged their\n3 lives based on the government’s representations, but now face the\n4 possibility of removal.  Plaintiffs argue that the government should\n5 therefore be equitably estopped from terminating DACA or from using\n6 their DACA information for immigration enforcement purposes (State\n7 Compl. ¶¶ 164–71; Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 192–99; Santa Clara Compl.\n8 ¶¶ 79–86).\n9 • Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the rescission was unlawful and an\n10 order restoring DACA (UC Compl. at 16, State Compl. at 35–36;\nt 11 San Jose Compl. at 15–16; Garcia Compl. at 43; Santa Clara Compl.\nr\nu\no a 12 at 26–27). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 On September 21, an initial case management conference occurred for all DACA actions\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 in our district.  At the conference, all counsel, including government counsel, presented a joint\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 proposal whereby the government would file the administrative record by October 13. \nS N 16 Significantly, although the government argued that discovery would be premature, it agreed to\nted  For the  17 submit the administrative record without any condition that it be done before any decision on its\ni\nn\nU\n18 threshold jurisdictional motion (presumably because it knew its jurisdictional motion would be\n19 premised on the administrative record) (see Dkt. No. 114 at 16; Tr. at 17:3, 22:2).  The Court\n20 made only slight revisions to the joint proposal, all in aid of a stated goal of providing a full\n21 record and final decision for our court of appeals prior to the March 5 expiration date.  Pursuant\n22 to FRCP 26, a case management order then set a October 6 deadline for the government to file\n23 the administrative record, set a briefing schedule for the parties’ motions to dismiss, for\n24 provisional relief, or for summary judgment, and permitted the parties to proceed with\n25 reasonable, limited, and narrowly-directed discovery (Dkt. No. 49).\n26 The government filed an administrative record on October 6.  It was merely, however,\n27 fourteen documents comprising 256 pages of which 187 consisted of published opinions from\n28 the DAPA litigation, and all of which already resided in the public domain.  All non-public\n16\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 17 of 49\n1 materials, some eighty-four documents, actually reviewed by the Acting Secretary remained\n2 withheld as privileged (Dkt. No. 71).  In other words, of the ninety-eight DACA-related\n3 documents personally considered by the decisionmaker, all but the fourteen already known to\n4 the public were withheld as privileged.  Although government counsel further indicated, upon\n5 inquiry by the district judge, that the decisionmaker had also likely received verbal input,\n6 nothing was included in the administrative record to capture this input.  Nor were there any\n7 materials regarding the agency’s earlier, recent decisions to leave DACA in place.  \n8 On October 9, plaintiffs moved to require the government to complete the administrative\n9 record, seeking all materials considered directly or indirectly by the Acting Secretary in\n10 reaching her decision to rescind DACA, which motion was granted in part and denied in part. \nt 11 The government, having earlier consented to filing the administrative record, was ordered to\nr\nu\no a 12 keep its word and to file a complete administrative record (Dkt. Nos. 65, 79–80).\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Instead, the government filed a petition for writ of mandamus with our court of appeals,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 seeking relief from having to complete the administrative record until after its jurisdictional\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 arguments were determined, a turnabout from its earlier voluntary proposal and stipulation to\nS N 16 file the administrative record as part of an agreed-upon schedule.  After full briefing and oral\nted  For the  17 argument, our court of appeals denied the government’s mandamus petition and vacated the\ni\nn\nU\n18 stay (over one dissent).5  \n19 The government was again ordered to complete the administrative record, this time by\n20 November 22, later extended to December 22 to accommodate the government’s claim of\n21 burden.  On December 1, however, the government filed a petition for writ of mandamus and\n22 application for a stay in the United States Supreme Court.  Ultimately, the Supreme Court did\n23 not reach the merits of the government’s petition but required that defendants’ jurisdictional\n24 defenses be adjudicated prior to consideration of discovery or completing the administrative\n25\n5  Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the government’s petition\n26\nfor a writ of mandamus to stay an order to supplement the same administrative record.  The court of appeals\nfound that there was “a strong suggestion that the record before the District Court was not complete” and, noting\n27\nthat nearly 200 pages of the record consisted of published opinions from various federal courts, “[i]t is difficult\nto imagine that a decision as important as whether to repeal DACA would be made based upon a factual record\n28\nof little more than 56 pages, even accepting that litigation risk was the reason for repeal.”  In Re: Kirstjen M.\nNielsen, No. 17-3345 (2d. Cir. Dec. 27, 2017).\n17\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 18 of 49\n1 record (Dkt. Nos. 86, 188, 197, 214, 224), a decision the district judge himself might have made\n2 at the outset save for the government’s own proposal and agreement to file the administrative\n3 record in October. \n4 Consequently, this action has proceeded on the incomplete administrative record\n5 initially filed by the government.  Plaintiffs have been forced to draw on other materials. \n6 Ironically, even the government in these motions relies on material outside of the administrative\n7 record to defend the agency decision (Dkt. No. 204 at 10, 12, 19–20).  The parties have now\n8 fully briefed motions to dismiss and a motion for provisional relief, all argued on December 20\n9 (Dkt. Nos. 111, 114).  This order now follows.\n10 ANALYSIS\nt 11 1. MOTION TO DISMISS.\nr\nu\no a 12 Defendants raise three jurisdictional arguments under FRCP 12(b)(1).  First, they argue\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 that the decision to rescind DACA was a discretionary act barred from judicial review under\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the APA.  Second, they contend that the INA bars judicial review.  Third, although defendants\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 concede that Individual Plaintiffs have standing, they contend that no others do.  Each is\nS N 16 now addressed in turn.  A separate order will consider defendants’ motion to dismiss under\nted  For the  17 FRCP 12(b)(6).  \ni\nn\nU\n18 A. The DACA Rescission Was Not Committed \nTo Agency Discretion by Law.\n19\nCongress has instructed our district courts to review and set aside agency action found\n20\nto be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n21\n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Under the APA, however, our district courts lack subject-matter\n22\njurisdiction to review agency action that is “committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C.\n23\n§ 701(a)(2).  \n24\nIn Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971), the\n25\nSupreme Court explained that the jurisdictional bar of Section 701(a)(2) is “very narrow” and\n26\n“applicable in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given\n27\ncase there is no law to apply.”  The Supreme Court held that because the statute there at issue\n28\ncontained “clear and specific directives” guiding the agency’s decision, there was “‘law to\n18\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 19 of 49\n1 apply,’ so the exemption for action ‘committed to agency discretion’ [was] inapplicable.”  Id. at\n2 411–13 (quotations and citations omitted).\n3 When it next revisited the exception in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985),\n4 the Supreme Court reiterated that the exception applies only where “the statute is drawn so\n5 that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise\n6 of discretion.”  There, condemned inmates asked the FDA to bring an enforcement action to\n7 prevent purported violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act through the\n8 administration of death-penalty drugs.  The FDA Commissioner, however, refused to do so on\n9 the ground that the FDA lacked jurisdiction and otherwise should not interfere with the state\n10 criminal justice system.  Skipping over the agency jurisdiction issue, the Supreme Court held\nt 11 that such decisions not to prosecute or initiate enforcement actions are generally not reviewable\nr\nu\no a 12 as they are “committed to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Id. at 824–25, 831. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Chaney identified several characteristics of non-enforcement decisions as key to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 its holding.  First, non-enforcement decisions require a complicated balancing of factors\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 “peculiarly within [the agency’s] expertise,” including whether “resources are best spent on\nS N 16 this violation or another, whether the agency is likely to succeed if it acts, whether the particular\nted  For the  17 enforcement action requested best fits the agency’s overall policies, and . . . whether the agency\ni\nn\nU\n18 has enough resources to undertake the action at all.”  Id. at 831.  Second, in refusing to act,\n19 an agency “does not exercise its coercive power over an individual’s liberty” and accordingly\n20 “does not infringe upon areas that courts often are called upon to protect.”  Id. at 832.  When an\n21 agency does act to enforce, however, that action itself provides a focus for judicial review,\n22 inasmuch as the agency must have exercised its power in some manner.  Third, a refusal to\n23 institute enforcement proceedings is similar to a prosecutor’s decision not to indict, which\n24 decision “has long been regarded as the special province of the Executive Branch.”  Ibid.  \n25 Our case is different from Chaney.  There, the agency simply refused to initiate an\n26 enforcement proceeding.  Here, by contrast, the agency has ended a program which has existed\n27 for five years affecting 689,800 enrollees.  Importantly, major policy decisions are “quite\n28 different from day-to-day agency nonenforcement decisions.”  National Treasury Employees\n19\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 20 of 49\n1 Union v. Horner, 854 F.2d 490, 496 (D.C. Cir. 1988).  Rather, broad enforcement policies “are\n2 more likely to be direct interpretations of the commands of the substantive statute rather than\n3 the sort of mingled assessments of fact, policy, and law that drive an individual enforcement\n4 decision.”  Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pena, 37 F.3d 671, 677 (D.C. Cir. 1994). \n5 Even defendants concede that where “the agency’s interpretation of a statute is embedded in a\n6 non-reviewable enforcement policy, the former may be reviewable as such” (Dkt. No. 218 at 3\n7 n.4).  Although they contend that the rescission memorandum “does not contain an embedded\n8 interpretation of the INA,” that assertion is incompatible with the Acting Secretary’s explicit\n9 references to the INA and the Attorney General’s determination that DACA was effectuated\n10 without “statutory authority.”  The first and third Chaney factors, accordingly, do not apply to\nt 11 the instant case.6  \nr\nu\no a 12 Chaney is also distinguishable because, unlike there, here the government reversed\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 course after five years of inviting DACA recipients out of the shadows.  In contrast to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 nonenforcement decisions, “rescissions of commitments, whether or not they technically\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 implicate liberty and property interests as defined under the fifth and fourteenth amendments,\nS N 16 exert much more direct influence on the individuals or entities to whom the repudiated\nted  For the  17 commitments were made.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 47 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  Through\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA, the government has invited undocumented aliens who meet threshold criteria to step\n19 forward, disclose substantial personal information, pay a hefty fee, and comply with ongoing\n20 conditions, all in expectation of (though not a right to) continued deferred action.  DACA\n21 allows enrollees to better plan their careers and lives with a reduced fear of removal.  DACA\n22 work authorizations, for example, allow recipients to join in the mainstream economy (and pay\n23 taxes).  DACA covers a class of immigrants whose presence, seemingly all agree, pose the least,\n24 if any, threat and allows them to sign up for honest labor on the condition of continued good\n25 behavior.  This has become an important program for DACA recipients and their families, for\n26\n6  Contrary to defendants, Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1050 (5th Cir. 1990), is distinguishable\n27\non its facts.  There, the Fifth Circuit addressed a class action stemming from the Immigration and Naturalization\nService’s failure to adjudicate requests for voluntary departure.  The court of appeals determined that the district\n28\ncourt had improperly issued an injunction directing INS to consider particular grounds in deciding individual\nrequests for voluntary departure and employment authorization.  Id. at 1046.  \n20\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 21 of 49\n1 the employers who hire them, for our tax treasuries, and for our economy.  An agency action to\n2 terminate it bears no resemblance to an agency decision not to regulate something never before\n3 regulated. \n4 Finally, there is law to apply.  The main, if not exclusive, rationale for ending DACA\n5 was its supposed illegality.  But determining illegality is a quintessential role of the courts.7  \n6 B. The INA Does Not Bar Review.\n7 The principle that courts owe substantial deference to the immigration determinations of\n8 the political branches is important and undisputed.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1162\n9 (9th Cir. 2017).  That deference, however, does not remove the decision to rescind DACA from\n10 the ambit of judicial review.  Rather, the Supreme Court has applied the “strong presumption\nt 11 in favor of judicial review of administration action” in the immigration context.  See INS v.\nr\nu\no a 12 St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 298–99 (2001). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 In this connection, defendants raise two arguments.  First, they contend that review\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 of discretionary enforcement decisions results in the inappropriate delay of removal, and\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 accordingly prolongs violations of our immigration laws.  This argument, however, again\nS N 16 ignores that plaintiffs do not challenge any particular removal but, rather, challenge the abrupt\nted  For the  17 end to a nationwide deferred-action and work-authorization program.  In any individual case,\ni\nn\nU\n18 DACA allows DHS to revoke deferred status and to deport.  Second, defendants assert that\n19 review of such decisions may involve disclosure of law enforcement priorities and\n20 foreign-policy objectives.  Neither concern is implicated here, as defendants’ stated reasons\n21 for the rescission all relate to the across-the-board cancellation of DACA based on supposed\n22 illegality, not to the facts particular to any proposed removal. \n23\n24\n25\n26\n7  Defendants are correct, of course, that a presumptively unreviewable agency action does not become\n27\nreviewable simply because “the agency gives a reviewable reason for otherwise unreviewable action.”  ICC v.\nBhd. of Locomotive Eng’s, 482 U.S. 270, 283 (1987).  As discussed above, however, the rescission of DACA\n28\nwas not such an unreviewable decision.\n21\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 22 of 49\n1 Nor does Section 1252(g) bar judicial review of the agency action in question.  8 U.S.C.\n2 § 1252(g) provides:\n3 Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other\nprovision of law (statutory or nonstatutory) . . . no court shall have\n4 jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien\narising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to\n5 commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal\norders against any alien under this chapter.  \n6\nAs explained by the Supreme Court, this provision applies only to the three discrete\n7\ndecisions or actions named in Section 1252(g).  AADC, 525 U.S. at 482.  Plaintiffs’ claims do\n8\nnot involve such decisions, but rather the challenge here is to the across-the-board cancellation\n9\nof a nationwide program.8 \n10\nDefendants recognize that these actions were brought prior to the commencement of\nt 11\nr\nu any removal proceedings.  Nevertheless, they argue that Section 1252(g) precludes review of\no a 12\nC ni\n  or plaintiffs’ claims because the decision to discontinue deferred action is “an ingredient to the\nct alif 13\ni C\ntr of  commencement of enforcement proceedings.”  It is true that eliminating DACA draws its\n Dis District  14 enrollees one step closer to deportation, but the Supreme Court rejected the argument that\ntates orthern  15 Section 1252(g) somehow precludes review of the “many other decisions or actions that may be\nS N 16\nted  For the  17 part of the deportation process.”  As AADC emphasized, “[i]t is implausible that the mention of\ni\nn three discrete events along the road to deportation was a shorthand way of referring to all claims\nU\n18\narising from deportation proceedings.”  Ibid.  \n19\nDefendants cite two decisions.  Importantly, however, both stemmed from already-\n20\ncommenced deportation or removal proceedings.  See Botezatu v. I.N.S., 195 F.3d 311, 312\n21\n(7th Cir. 1999) (declining to review a decision to deny deferred action after plaintiff had been\n22\nfound deportable); Vasquez v. Aviles, 639 F. App’x 898, 899–900 (3d Cir. 2016) (district court\n23\nlacked jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petition that claimed plaintiff was improperly denied\n24\nDACA relief).  \n25\nBy comparison, our court of appeals has held, following AADC, that Section 1252(g)\n26\ndoes not bar review of actions that occur “prior to any decision to ‘commence proceedings.’” \n27\n28\n8  The district court in Batalla Vidal also concluded that Section 1252(g) did not bar judicial review of\nchallenges to the DACA rescission.  Batalla Vidal v. Duke, 2017 WL 5201116, at *13.\n22\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 23 of 49\n1 Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 965 (9th Cir. 2004).  The claims in Kwai Fun\n2 Wong challenged the revocation of the plaintiff’s parole without first deciding her application\n3 for immigration relief, conduct which “resulted in the INS’s decision to commence removal\n4 proceedings and ultimately to remove” the plaintiff from the United States.  Id. at 959, 964. \n5 Contrary to defendants, it is immaterial that Kwai Fun Wong did not involve deferred action,\n6 as both the revocation of parole and the revocation of deferred action are “an ingredient” to the\n7 commencement of enforcement proceedings.  The jurisdictional limits of Section 1252(g) were\n8 instead “directed at the deconstruction, fragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal\n9 proceedings.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 482.\n10 C. Most Plaintiffs Have Standing.\nt 11 To establish standing, Article III of the United States Constitution requires plaintiffs\nr\nu\no a 12 to show “(1) they suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 560–61 (1992)).  The standing inquiry is focused on whether the plaintiff has a sufficient\nS N 16 personal stake in the outcome of the controversy to ensure that the parties will be truly adverse\nted  For the  17 and their legal presentations sharpened.  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007).  Standing\ni\nn\nU\n18 must be assessed on a claim-by-claim basis.  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352\n19 (2006).\n20 Defendants do not dispute that the Individual Plaintiffs have standing.  Rather, they argue\n21 in brief that the entity plaintiffs (the state and local governments, UC Plaintiffs, and SEIU Local\n22 521) lack Article III standing because the rescission does not regulate or restrict them in any\n23 way.  Defendants therefore posit that the entity plaintiffs’ claimed injuries are due only to\n24 “incidental effects” of the rescission, which defendants contend are insufficient to establish\n25 injury-in-fact.  As set forth below, these arguments lack merit.  \n26 First, California, Maryland, the City of San Jose, and the County of Santa Clara each\n27 employ DACA recipients, in connection with whom they have invested substantial resources\n28 in hiring and training.  Plaintiffs allege that they will not only lose these employees as work\n23\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 24 of 49\n1 authorizations expire, but that they will also need to expend additional resources to hire and train\n2 replacements.  San Jose further alleges that as a result of the rescission, the City has had\n3 decreased productivity, and that it has had to expend time and resources to deal with decreased\n4 employee morale (States Compl. ¶¶ 26–27, 32, 53; San Jose Compl. ¶¶ 49–50; Santa Clara\n5 Compl. ¶¶ 32–37; App. 11, 95–97, 706–07, 798, 1575–76). \n6 Second, Plaintiff States, including Maine and Maryland, stand to lose significant tax\n7 revenue as a result of the rescission (States Compl. ¶¶ 28–30, 37, 49–50, 70–71).  Although\n8 general allegations of injury to a state’s economy and the associated decline in general tax\n9 revenues may not be sufficient to establish standing, here, Plaintiff States sufficiently allege a\n10 “direct injury in the form of a loss of specific tax revenues.”  Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S.\nt 11 437, 448 (1992).  They allege, for example, that Maine stands to lose $96,000 in annual state\nr\nu\no a 12 and local taxes as DACA recipients leave the workforce (States Compl. ¶¶ 30, 38).  Evidence\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 submitted by plaintiffs supports these allegations, and demonstrates that DACA’s rescission\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 would reduce state and local tax contributions by DACA-eligible individuals by at least half\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 (App. 68–74, 218–30). \nS N 16 Third, the University of California has also established that it will suffer injury to its\nted  For the  17 proprietary interests.  As declarations submitted by the University demonstrate, the rescission\ni\nn\nU\n18 has harmed the University in multiple ways.  Because DACA recipients can no longer seek\n19 advance parole, these students are unable to travel outside of the United States for research and\n20 educational conferences.  DACA recipients have also decided to cancel their enrollment in the\n21 University, and additional recipients are at risk of dropping out, because they would not be able\n22 to pay the cost of attendance without work authorizations. The University has also invested\n23 resources in recruiting and retaining DACA recipients as employees in various roles, including\n24 as teaching assistants and health care providers.  Such investments would be lost should these\n25 employees lose their ability to work in the United States.  \n26 California, Maryland, and Minnesota also allege injury to their public universities\n27 through harm to their educational missions and the loss of students and teachers.  According to\n28 the declarations filed by plaintiffs, the rescission, and the resulting loss of work authorization\n24\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 25 of 49\n1 and potential for deportation, will adversely impact the diversity of the talent pool of potential\n2 students, which will make it more difficult for the universities to fulfill their missions of\n3 increasing diversity (States Compl. ¶¶ 27, 55, 64–66; App. 12–16, 496–514, 884–90).  Our court\n4 of appeals recently affirmed the standing of two state governments to challenge an immigration\n5 policy that similarly harmed the plaintiffs’ public universities.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d\n6 1151, 1160–01 (9th Cir. 2017).  These injuries accordingly give the University of California and\n7 the States of California, Maryland, and Minnesota Article III standing.  Ibid. (citing Singleton v.\n8 Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114–16 (1976)).9\n9 Fourth, State Plaintiffs Maryland and Minnesota further allege that the rescission will\n10 negatively impact their public health programs.  In particular, Maryland and Minnesota allege\nt 11 that rescinding DACA will cause many DACA grantees to lose their employer-based health\nr\nu\no a 12 insurance, imposing higher healthcare costs on the state (State Compl. ¶¶ 51, 62).  These injuries\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 are also sufficient to confer Article III standing.10  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Finally, SEIU Local 521 has associational standing to bring its claims on behalf of its\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 members who are DACA recipients.  An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its\nS N 16 members when:  (1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right;\nted  For the  17 (2) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (3) neither the\ni\nn\nU\n18 claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the\n19 lawsuit.  Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock,\n20\n21\n9  The public universities of California, Maryland, and Minnesota are branches of the states under state\nlaw.  Campbell v. Regents of Univ. of California, 35 Cal. 4th 311, 321 (2005); Hanauer v. Elkins, 217 Md. 213,\n22\n219, 141 A.2d 903, 906 (Md. 1958); Univ. of Minn. v. Raygor, 620 N.W.2d 680, 683 (Minn. 2001).  \n23\n10  Although not discussed by the parties, the District of Columbia Circuit held that Joe Arpaio, Sheriff\nof Maricopa County, Arizona, lacked Article III standing to challenge DACA.  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11\n24 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  While the court of appeals found that the plaintiff’s alleged harm — increased spending on\ncriminal investigation, apprehension, and incarceration — was sufficiently concrete, his theory that DACA\n25\nwould lead to an increased number of undocumented immigrants committing crimes in his jurisdiction was too\nspeculative.  Id. at 19–20.  Here, by contrast, plaintiffs allege that the rescission will cause DACA recipients to\n26\nlose their work authorizations, and that plaintiffs will lose employees and students, suffer decreased tax revenue,\nand otherwise incur increased costs as a direct result.  This case is also different from Crane v. Johnson,\n27\n783 F.3d 244, 252 (5th Cir. 2015), where the Fifth Circuit held that Mississippi lacked standing to challenge\nDACA because it failed to submit evidence that DACA eligible immigrants resided in the state.  Defendants do\n28\nnot dispute State Plaintiffs’ allegations that hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients live in Plaintiff States.  \n25\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 26 of 49\n1 477 U.S. 274, 282 (1986) (quoting Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n,\n2 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  SEIU has established all three elements here.  SEIU has members\n3 who are DACA recipients.  Its constitution states that part of its mission is to provide its\n4 members with a voice in the larger community, and that its members should be treated equally\n5 with dignity regardless of immigration status or national origin.  SEIU has also formed a\n6 Committee on Comprehensive Immigration Reform, a member-based committee that engages in\n7 organizing, advocacy, and education to help undocumented workers.  Its members’ interests in\n8 these actions are therefore germane to SEIU’s stated purpose (App. 801–09).  Furthermore, this\n9 action does not require the participation of SEIU’s individual members.  \n10 Defendants, in arguing that the entity plaintiffs lack standing, rely solely on Linda R.S. v.\nt 11 Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973).  There, the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge a Texas\nr\nu\no a 12 state court’s interpretation of a child support statute.  Ibid.  The Supreme Court held that,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 although the plaintiff had alleged an injury, she had not shown “a direct nexus between the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 vindication of her interest and the enforcement of the State’s criminal laws” because the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 relationship between the state’s decision not to prosecute and the father’s decision not to pay\nS N 16 under the statute could “at best, be termed only speculative.”  Id. at 618–19.  Linda R.S. has no\nted  For the  17 application here.  As explained above, the entity plaintiffs have alleged harm to their proprietary\ni\nn\nU\n18 interests as a direct result of defendants’ decision to terminate the DACA program, most notably\n19 through its termination of work authorizations.  Accordingly, the entity plaintiffs have\n20 sufficiently alleged injury-in-fact traceable to the termination of DACA, and have demonstrated\n21 that these harms are redressable by their requested relief.11 \n22 Turning to prudential standing under the APA, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered\n23 or will suffer sufficient injury-in-fact, and that “the interest[s] sought to be protected by the\n24 complainant [are] arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the\n25 statute . . . in question.”  Nat’l Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat’l Bank & Trust Co., 522 U.S.\n26 479, 488 (1998).  \n27\n11  Because defendants’ conduct imposes direct injury on the State Plaintiffs’ proprietary interests, this\n28\norder need not reach defendants’ argument that the State Plaintiffs lack standing as parens patriae.\n26\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 27 of 49\n1 A plaintiff that is not itself the subject of the contested regulatory action lacks prudential\n2 standing only where its interests “are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\n3 implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the\n4 suit.”  Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987).  This test is “not meant to be\n5 especially demanding,” and must be applied “in keeping with Congress’s evident intent when\n6 enacting the APA to make agency action presumably reviewable.”  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish\n7 Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012) (quotations and citations\n8 omitted).  \n9 The parties’ briefs include only a cursory discussion of plaintiffs’ prudential standing\n10 under the APA.  Again, defendants do not dispute that the Individual Plaintiffs also have\nt 11 statutory standing.  SEIU, which asserts the rights of its members who are DACA recipients,\nr\nu\no a 12 likewise seeks the protection of interests regulated by the INA.  Not all of the entity plaintiffs,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 however, have established prudential standing to proceed on their APA claims.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Plaintiffs primarily rely on our court of appeals’ recent decision in Hawaii v. Trump,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 859 F.3d 741, 765 (9th Cir. 2017), as well as on various provisions of the INA which provide for\nS N 16 student- and employment-related immigrant visas.  Plaintiffs do not contend, however, that their\nted  For the  17 DACA-recipient students or employees qualify for such visas.  Nor do plaintiffs point to\ni\nn\nU\n18 any provisions of the INA which indicate a protected interest in enrolling students with deferred\n19 action in their schools or universities.  Plaintiffs are also unable to point to any provision of the\n20 INA indicating that Congress intend to protected Plaintiff States’ interests in maintaining income\n21 tax revenue or avoiding increased healthcare costs.  \n22 By contrast, local and state governments San Jose, Santa Clara, California, and\n23 Maryland, as well as the University of California, have all identified injuries resulting from their\n24 status as employers, and allege harm caused by their employees’ future loss of deferred action\n25 and associated work authorization.  The INA gives the Executive Branch broad discretion to\n26 determine when noncitizens may work in the United States, 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(3), and\n27 regulations promulgated pursuant to this authority allow recipients of deferred action to apply\n28 for work authorization if they can demonstrate an “economic necessity for employment.” \n27\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 28 of 49\n1 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  Moreover, the INA contains detailed provisions which subject\n2 employers to criminal and civil liability for knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens, see 8 U.S.C.\n3 § 1324a(a)(1)(A), and for “continu[ing] to employ the alien in the United States knowing\n4 the alien is (or has become) an unauthorized alien with respect to such employment,” id.\n5 § 1324a(a)(2).  The work authorization document that the agency issues to DACA recipients\n6 is one of the documents that is acceptable for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification,\n7 which employers must complete and retain for each individual they hire for employment in the\n8 United States (App. 2061–62).  Plaintiffs’ interest in their employees’ continued authorization\n9 to work in the United States is therefore “arguably within the zone of interests” that the INA\n10 protects.  Hawaii, 859 F.3d at 765; Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 522 U.S. at 488.12\nt 11 Accordingly, even though the zone of interests inquiry is not demanding, this order\nr\nu\no a 12 concludes that Maine and Minnesota’s interests are “so marginally related” to the purposes\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 implicit in the INA that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 suit.  Maine and Minnesota’s APA claims are accordingly DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 The remaining entity plaintiffs, however, have established that their interests that support\nS N 16 Article III standing also satisfy the APA’s zone of interests test.  \nted  For the  17 *                        *                        *\ni\nn\nU\n18 Apart from the holding that Maine and Minnesota do not have statutory standing, the\n19 foregoing rejects all of the government’s jurisdictional arguments to dismiss plaintiffs’\n20 challenges under the Administrative Procedure Act. \n21 2. PROVISIONAL RELIEF.\n22 Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to restore DACA.  To support a preliminary\n23 injunction, plaintiffs must establish four elements:  (1) likelihood of success on the merits;\n24 (2) irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in\n25\n26 12  Defendants’ sole argument against the entity plaintiffs’ prudential standing is that no provision\nof the INA protects the entity plaintiffs from “bearing the incidental effects” of a denial of deferred action. \n27\nThe case on which defendants rely, however, dealt with a private anti-immigration organization whose members\nwere not impacted by the immigration policy at issue.  See Fed’n for Am. Immigration Reform, Inc. v. Reno,\n28 93 F.3d 897, 899 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \n28\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 29 of 49\n1 their favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. Natural Resources\n2 Defense Council Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  As now explained, the record warrants most of the\n3 provisional relief requested.  \n4 A. Likelihood of Success on the Merits.\n5 Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claim that the rescission\n6 was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not otherwise in accordance with law. \n7 Specifically, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims that:  (1) the agency’s decision to\n8 rescind DACA was based on a flawed legal premise; and (2) government counsel’s supposed\n9 “litigation risk” rationale is a post hoc rationalization and would be, in any event, arbitrary and\n10 capricious.\nt 11 (1) The Rescission was Based on a Flawed Legal Premise.\nr\nu\no a 12 The agency action was “not in accordance with law” because it was based on the flawed\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 legal premise that the agency lacked authority to implement DACA.  When agency action is\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 based on a flawed legal premise, it may be set as aside as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  See Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 532\nS N 16 (setting aside the EPA’s denial of a petition for rulemaking under the Clean Air Act for\nted  For the  17 supposed lack of authority); Safe Air for Everyone v. EPA, 488 F.3d 1088, 1101 (9th Cir. 2007). \ni\nn\nU\n18 This order holds that DACA fell within the agency’s enforcement authority.  The contrary\n19 conclusion was flawed and should be set aside.  \n20 The administrative record includes the 2014 determination of the Office of Legal Counsel\n21 of the United States Department of Justice that programmatic deferred action is a permissible\n22 exercise of DHS’s enforcement discretion.  OLC noted that deferred action programs such as\n23 DACA are permissible so long as immigration officials retain discretion to evaluate each\n24 application on an individualized basis and so long as the concerns animating the program were\n25 consistent with the types of concerns that have customarily guided the exercise of immigration\n26 enforcement discretion.  OLC recognized that the “practice of granting deferred action date[d]\n27 back several decades,” and that “Congress has long been aware of the practice of granting\n28 deferred action, including in its categorical variety, and of its salient features; and it has never\n29\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 30 of 49\n1 acted to disapprove or limit the practice.”  Indeed, not only has Congress not limited the practice,\n2 but it has “enacted several pieces of legislation that have either assumed that deferred action\n3 would be available in certain circumstances, or expressly directed that deferred action be\n4 extended to certain categories of aliens” (AR 15–27). \n5 As explained in OLC’s opinion, each feature of the DACA program is anchored in\n6 authority granted or recognized by Congress or the Supreme Court.  Because this is the heart\n7 of the problem, and with apology for some repetition, this order will now examine each feature\n8 in turn.  \n9 The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible under the INA for “establishing\n10 national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.”  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).  The Secretary is\nt 11 also charged with the administration and enforcement of the INA.  8 U.S.C. § 1103.  In making\nr\nu\no a 12 immigration enforcement decisions, the executive “considers a variety of factors such as the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 danger posed to the United States of an individual’s unlawful presence, the impact of removal\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 on the nation’s international relations, and the ‘human concerns’ of whether the individual ‘has\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 children born in the United States, long ties to the community, or a record of distinguished\nS N 16 military service.’”  Arpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Arizona v. United\nted  For the  17 States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012)).  In instituting DACA, Secretary Napolitano explained that\ni\nn\nU\n18 the program was “necessary to ensure that [DHS’s] enforcement resources are not expended on\n19 [] low priority cases but are instead appropriately focused on people who meet our enforcement\n20 priorities” (AR 1).13\n21 As set forth above, deferred action originated without any statutory basis apart from the\n22 discretion vested by Congress in connection with the agency’s enforcement of the immigration\n23 laws.  Over the decades, however, deferred action became such a fixture that Congress referred\n24 to it by name in several INA amendments.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1227(d)(2) (stating that U visa\n25 and T visa applicants who were denied an administrative stay of removal were not precluded\n26 from applying for “deferred action”); 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II) (stating that eligible\n27\n13  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit did not reach the merits of\n28\nSheriff Joe Arpaio’s challenges to DACA and DAPA but instead dismissed the case for lack of Article III\nstanding.  Arpaio, 797 F.3d at 15.\n30\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 31 of 49\n1 derivatives of VAWA petitioners were eligible for “deferred action” and work authorization); 8\n2 U.S.C. § 1151 note (stating that certain immediate family members of certain United States\n3 citizens “shall be eligible for deferred action”).  Congress has also acknowledged deferred action\n4 in enactments outside of the INA.  See, e.g., 49 U.S.C. § 30301 note (specifying that evidence of\n5 lawful status includes proof of “deferred action status”); USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, Pub. L.\n6 No. 107-56, § 423(b), 115 Stat. 272, 361 (stating that immediate family members of legal\n7 permanent residents killed on September 11, 2001 “may be eligible for deferred action”). \n8 Congress has been free to constrain DHS’s discretion with respect to granting deferred action,\n9 but it has yet to do so.  \n10 The Supreme Court has recognized the authority of DHS to grant relief from removal,\nt 11 Arizona, 567 U.S. at 396, and has specifically recognized deferred action as a way to exercise\nr\nu\no a 12 that discretion — “for humanitarian reasons or simply for [the Executive’s] own convenience.” \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 AADC, 525 U.S. at 484.  Notably, our court of appeals has said that “the exercise of\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 prosecutorial discretion in deferred action flows from the authority conferred on the Secretary by\n  Di\nStates Northern  1156 IthI”e) .I1N4 A  .”  Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 968 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Brewer\nted  For the  17 In extending programmatic deferred action to DACA enrollees, the agency acted within\ni\nn\nU\n18 the scope of this long and recognized practice.  In the exercise of its enforcement discretion and\n19 policy-making, the agency simply found that DACA enrollees represented low priority cases\n20 for removal and instituted DACA to manage that population while it redirected its resources\n21 elsewhere.  Even for enrollees approved under the program, DHS expressly retained the\n22 authority to terminate their deferred action at any time, in the agency’s discretion.  DACA\n23 provided no guarantee against removal.  \n24 Nevertheless, DACA has provided recipients with a major benefit, namely work\n25 authorizations for the period of deferral upon a demonstration of economic need.  This has\n26\n27\n14  In Brewer II, our court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing en banc.  Circuit Judge Kozinski,\njoined by five other Circuit Judges, filed a dissent to the denial of the petition, expressing the view that DACA\n28\ndid not preempt Arizona’s law refusing to issue drivers’ licenses to DACA recipients.  855 F.3d at 958–62.\n31\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 32 of 49\n1 allowed DACA recipients to become part of the mainstream workforce and contribute openly\n2 to our economy.  Significantly, Section 1324a(h)(3) defines an “unauthorized alien” not entitled\n3 to work in the United States as an alien who is neither a legal permanent resident nor “authorized\n4 to be . . . employed by [the INA] or by the [Secretary of Homeland Security].”  In turn, the\n5 Secretary of Homeland Security has allowed work authorizations in cases of deferred action\n6 under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14).  As our court of appeals has stated, “the Executive Branch has\n7 determined that deferred action recipients — including DACA recipients — are ordinarily\n8 authorized to work in the United States.”  See Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1062.  \n9 It is also within the lawful authority of the agency to determine that DACA recipients\n10 do not accrue “unlawful presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on re-entry.  Pursuant to\nt 11 pre-existent DHS regulations and policy guidance, deferred action recipients already avoided\nr\nu\no a 12 accrual of “unlawful presence.”  8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(3); 28 C.F.R. § 1100.35(b)(2);\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Memorandum for Field Leadership, from Donald Neufeld, Acting Associate Director, Domestic\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Operations Directorate, USCIS, Re: Consolidation of Guidance Concerning Unlawful Presence\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 for Purposes of Sections 212(a)(9)(B)(i) and 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(i) of the Act at 42 (May 6, 2009). \nS N 16 Importantly, DHS excludes recipients of deferred action from being “unlawfully present”\nted  For the  17 because their deferred action is considered a period of stay authorized by the government.  See 8\ni\nn\nU\n18 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii) (an alien is deemed to be unlawfully present if the alien is present “in\n19 the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General\n20 [and now the Secretary of Homeland Security]”); Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1059.\n21 Allowing DACA recipients to apply for and obtain advance parole to travel overseas and\n22 return to the United States is also in accord with pre-existing regulations.  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(f);\n23 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) (the Attorney General [and now the Secretary of Homeland Security]\n24 may “in his discretion parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he\n25 may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public\n26 benefit”).\n27 In short, what exactly is the part of DACA that oversteps the authority of the agency? \n28 Is it the granting of deferred action itself?  No, deferred action has been blessed by both the\n32\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 33 of 49\n1 Supreme Court and Congress as a means to exercise enforcement discretion.  Is it the granting\n2 of deferred action via a program (as apposed to ad hoc individual grants)?  No, programmatic\n3 deferred action has been in use since at least 1997, and other forms of programmatic\n4 discretionary relief date back to at least 1956.  Is it granting work authorizations coextensive\n5 with the two-year period of deferred action?  No, aliens receiving deferred action have been able\n6 to apply for work authorization for decades.  Is it granting relief from accruing “unlawful\n7 presence” for purposes of the INA’s bars on reentry?  No, such relief dates back to the George\n8 W. Bush Administration for those receiving deferred action.  Is it allowing recipients to apply for\n9 and obtain advance parole?  No, once again, granting advance parole has all been in accord\n10 with pre-existing law.  Is it combining all these elements into a program?  No, if each step is\nt 11 within the authority of the agency, then how can combining them in one program be outside its\nr\nu\no a 12 authority, so long as the agency vets each applicant and exercises its discretion on a case-by-case\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 basis?\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Significantly, the government makes no effort in its briefs to challenge any of the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 foregoing reasons why DACA was and remains within the authority of the agency.  Nor does the\nS N 16 government challenge any of the statutes and regulations under which deferred action recipients\nted  For the  17 obtain the foregoing benefits.\ni\nn\nU\n18 Instead, the administrative record shows that the Attorney General told the Acting\n19 Secretary that DACA was illegal.  First, the Attorney General said that DACA had been\n20 improperly adopted by the Obama Administration after “Congress’ repeated rejection of\n21 proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result.”  But the proposals rejected\n22 by Congress markedly differ from DACA.  Importantly, while the proposed legislation would\n23 have offered Dreamers the ability to become lawful permanent residents, no comparable\n24 pathway was offered by DACA.  Our court of appeals recognized this distinction, noting that “the\n25 DREAM Act and the DACA program are not interchangeable policies because they provided\n26 different forms of relief.”  Brewer II, 855 F.3d at 976 n.10.  In fact, the 2012 DACA memo\n27 made explicit that DACA offered no pathway to lawful permanent residency, much less\n28 citizenship.  Secretary Napolitano concluded her memo by stating that DACA “confer[ed] no\n33\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 34 of 49\n1 substantive right, immigration status or pathway to citizenship.”  To claim that DACA was\n2 rejected by Congress, therefore, is unfair.15\n3 Second, another criticism of DACA was that applications received mechanical, routine\n4 approval without individualized consideration.  In her rescission memorandum, the Acting\n5 Secretary indicated that “[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services] has not been\n6 able to identify specific denial cases where an applicant appeared to satisfy the programmatic\n7 categorical criteria as outlined in the [original DACA] memorandum, but still had his or her\n8 application denied based solely upon discretion.”  The simple answer to this, if true, would be\n9 for the agency to instruct its adjudicators to exercise discretion, on a individualized basis, to\n10 make sure applicants do not pose a threat to national security or public safety and are otherwise\nt 11 deserving of deferred action.  \nr\nu\no a 12 It appears, moreover, that the Acting Secretary was in error when she said that USCIS\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 has been unable to identify discretionary denials of DACA applications.  She cited no evidence\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 for this fact, and none is found in the administrative record.  Possibly, the Acting Secretary relied\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 on findings made in the DAPA litigation.  There, the majority panel noted that USCIS could not\nS N 16 produce any applications that satisfied the guidelines of the original DACA memorandum but\nted  For the  17 were nonetheless refused through an exercise of discretion.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 172.  As the\ni\nn\nU\n18 dissent pointed out, however, the district court may have conflated rejections of DACA\n19 applications with denials, and as a result suggested that most denials were made for mechanical,\n20 administrative reasons.  Id. at 210 (King, J., dissenting).  A declaration submitted in that case by\n21 Donald Neufeld, then-Associate Director for Service Center Operations for USCIS, pointed to\n22 several instances of discretionary denials.  Id. at 175.  That same declaration explained that while\n23 a DACA application was rejected when it was “determined upon intake that the application [had]\n24 a fatal flaw,” an application was denied when a USCIS adjudicator, on a case-by-case basis,\n25 determined that the requestor either had not demonstrated that they satisfied the guidelines for\n26\n15  See, e.g., S. 1291, 107th Congress (2001); S. 1545, 108th Congress (2003); S. 2075, 109th Congress\n27\n(2005); H.R. 5131, 109th Congress (2006); H.R. 1275, 110th Congress (2007); S. 2205, 110th Congress (2007);\nH.R. 1751, 111th Congress (2009); S. 3827, 111th Congress (2010); S. 3962, 111th Congress (2010); S. 3992,\n28\n111th Congress (2010); H.R. 6497, 111th Congress (2010); S. 952, 112th Congress (2011). \n34\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 35 of 49\n1 DACA or when an adjudicator determined that deferred action should be denied even though\n2 the threshold guidelines were met.  Id. at 210–11 (dissent).  The United States District Court\n3 for the District of Columbia, in addressing nearly identical statistics, recognized the distinction. \n4 The district court noted that as of December 2014, 36,860 requests for deferred action under\n5 DACA were denied and another 42,632 applicants were rejected as not eligible, and concluded\n6 that such statistics “reflect that [] case-by-case review is in operation.”  Arpaio, 27 F. Supp. 3d\n7 at 209 n.13.  The administrative record tendered in our case completely fails to explain this\n8 apparent discrepancy.  \n9 Third, the main ground given by the Attorney General for illegality was the Fifth\n10 Circuit’s decision in the DAPA litigation.  DACA, the Attorney General said, suffered from the\nt 11 same “legal and constitutional defects” leveled against DAPA in Texas v. United States, 809\nr\nu\no a 12 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015).  Upon consideration of the full history of that case, however, this was\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 an overstatement.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 In the DAPA litigation, the district court held that DAPA violated the APA’s notice-and-\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 comment procedures because it constituted “a new rule that substantially change[d] both the\nS N 16 status and employability of millions” and inflicted “major costs on both states and federal\nted  For the  17 government.”  The district court found that the discretionary aspects of DAPA were “merely\ni\nn\nU\n18 pretext,” based on its finding that DACA had been implemented in such a mechanical way\n19 as to prevent the exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis, and DAPA would therefore be\n20 implemented in the same manner.  Notice and opportunity for public comment, it held, should\n21 have accordingly been given.  Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 671. \n22 Although the Fifth Circuit recognized that “there was conflicting evidence on the degree\n23 to which DACA allowed discretion,” because the government had failed to produce any\n24 applications that satisfied all of the criteria but were refused deferred action by an exercise of\n25 discretion, it was “not error — clear or otherwise —” for the district court to have concluded that\n26 DHS had only issued denials under mechanical formulae.  The appellate court also pointed to\n27 DACA’s Operating Procedures, which contained “nearly 150 pages of specific instructions for\n28\n35\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 36 of 49\n1 granting or denying deferred action,” as supporting the conclusion that DACA did not leave the\n2 agency free to exercise discretion.  \n3 It cautioned, however, that “[f]or a number of reasons, any extrapolation from DACA\n4 must be done carefully.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 173 (emphasis added).  In particular, the appellate\n5 court recognized that DACA involved self-selecting applicants, and those who expected to be\n6 denied relief were unlikely to apply.  Id. at 174.  The court also recognized that “DACA and\n7 DAPA are not identical” and that because eligibility for DACA was restricted to a younger and\n8 less numerous population, DACA applicants were less likely to have backgrounds that would\n9 warrant a discretionary denial.  Ibid.\n10 In addition to affirming the notice-and-comment holding (over one dissent), two of the\nt 11 judges on the Fifth Circuit panel went a large step further and held that DAPA conflicted with\nr\nu\no a 12 the INA.  The majority pointed out that the INA already had a specific provision through which\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 aliens could derive lawful status from their children’s immigration status.  Id. at 180 n.167\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 (citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1182(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), 1201(a), 1255).  DAPA, the majority\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 said, circumvented this statutory pathway.  \nS N 16 The Fifth Circuit also pointed out that the INA had specific provisions through which\nted  For the  17 aliens could be classified as “lawfully present,” could obtain discretionary relief from removal,\ni\nn\nU\n18 or could obtain eligibility for work authorization.  Because DAPA could make 4.3 million\n19 removable aliens eligible for lawful presence, employment authorization, and associated\n20 benefits, the Fifth Circuit concluded that DAPA implicated “questions of deep ‘economic and\n21 political significance’ that are central to [the INA’s] statutory scheme,” and therefore had\n22 Congress wished to assign that decision to an agency, “it surely would have done so expressly.”  \n23 The Fifth Circuit rejected the argument that various provisions of the INA, such as the\n24 broad grant of authority to the agency in 6 U.S.C. § 202(5) (providing that the Secretary “shall\n25 be responsible for establishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities”),\n26 provided the authority to implement DAPA.  Rather, it found that such grants of authority could\n27 not reasonably be construed as assigning the agency decisions of such massive “economic and\n28 political significance.”  Such an interpretation, the majority said, would allow the agency to\n36\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 37 of 49\n1 grant lawful presence and work authorization to any illegal alien in the United States.  It\n2 concluded that “even with ‘special deference’ to the Secretary,” the INA did not permit the\n3 reclassification of 4.3 million aliens as “lawfully present,” thereby making them newly eligible\n4 for a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization.\n5 The majority also rejected the argument that DAPA was moored in historical practice,\n6 finding that such historical practice “does not, by itself, create power,” and that in any event,\n7 previous deferred-action programs were not analogous to DAPA because most discretionary\n8 deferrals had been done on a country-specific basis, usually in response to war, civil unrest, or\n9 natural disasters, or had been bridges from one legal status to another.  It found that “[n]othing\n10 like DAPA, which alters the status of more than four million aliens, has ever been contemplated\nt 11 absent direct statutory authorization.” \nr\nu\no a 12 The majority concluded that Congress had “directly addressed the precise question\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 at issue” in DAPA because the INA “prescribes how parents may derive an immigration\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 classification on the basis of their child’s status and which classes of aliens can achieve deferred\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 action and eligibility for work authorization.”  Texas, 809 F.3d at 186.  Because it found that\nS N 16 DAPA was foreclosed by Congress’s “careful plan,” the majority held that the program was\nted  For the  17 “manifestly contrary to the statute.”\ni\nn\nU\n18 While at least some of the majority’s reasons for holding DAPA illegal would apply to\n19 DACA, fairness requires saying that DACA and DAPA were different, as the panel opinion\n20 stated.  An important criticism against DAPA would not apply against DACA, namely the fact\n21 that Congress had already established a pathway to lawful presence for alien parents of citizens\n22 (so that DAPA simply constituted a more lenient substitute route).  DACA, by contrast, has no\n23 such analogue in the INA.  And, there is a difference between 4.3 million and 689,800.  Finally,\n24 the criticism that DACA had been mechanically administered without the exercise of discretion\n25 in individual cases, if true, could be fixed by simply insisting on exercise of discretion.  In sum,\n26 the DAPA litigation was not a death knell for DACA. \n27 This order holds that, in light of our own court of appeals’ reasoning in Brewer I and\n28 Brewer II, in light of the analysis of the Office of Legal Counsel of the United States Department\n37\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 38 of 49\n1 of Justice, and the reasoning set forth above, our court of appeals will likely hold that DACA\n2 was and remains a lawful exercise of authority by DHS.  Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed\n3 on the merits of their claim that the rescission was based on a flawed legal premise and must be\n4 set aside as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with\n5 law.”  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 528; Sec. & Exch. Comm’n v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94\n6 (1943); Safe Air for Everyone, 488 F.3d at 1101.16  \n7 (2) Government Counsel’s Alternative Rationale \nIs Post Hoc and, in Any Event, Arbitrary, \n8 Capricious, and an Abuse of Discretion. \n9 Government counsel now advances an alternative rationale for the Secretary’s decision to\n10 rescind DACA.  Counsel contends that DHS acted within its discretion in managing its litigation\nt 11 exposure in the Fifth Circuit, weighing its options, and deciding on an orderly wind down of the\nr\nu\no a 12 program so as to avoid a potentially disastrous injunction in the Fifth Circuit.  This, they say,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 constituted a reasonable judgment call involving management of litigation risk and agency\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 resources.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Courts, of course, may not accept post hoc rationalizations for agency action, see\nS N 16 Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962), nor may they “supply a\nted  For the  17 reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given.”  Bowman Transp.,\ni\nn\nU\n18 Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., 419 U.S. 281, 285–86 (1974); see also Cal. Pub. Util. Comm’n v.\n19 Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, No. 16-70481 at 15 (9th Cir. Jan. 8, 2018).  Rather, “an\n20 agency’s action must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.”  Motor\n21 Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50\n22 (1983).  \n23\n24\n16  Defendants argue that if the Acting Secretary had relied on DACA’s purported illegality in\n25\nterminating the program, that reliance should be presumed to be a “reasonable policy judgment that immigration\ndecisions of this magnitude should be left to Congress.”  This argument finds no support in the administrative\n26\nrecord.  In Syracuse Peace Council v. F.C.C., upon which defendants rely, the agency explicitly based its\ndecision on the independent grounds that a policy was both unconstitutional and contrary to the public interest. \n27\n867 F.2d 654, 656 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  Although the court of appeals elected to review only the agency’s policy\ndetermination under the APA, it noted that “if the Commission had written its opinion in purely constitutional\n28\nterms, we would have no choice but to address the constitutional issue.”  Id. at 659.\n38\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 39 of 49\n1 The reason actually given in the administrative record for the rescission was DACA’s\n2 purported illegality.  The Attorney General’s letter and the Acting Secretary’s memorandum can\n3 only be reasonably read as stating DACA was illegal and that, given that DACA must, therefore,\n4 be ended, the best course was “an orderly and efficient wind-down process,” rather than a\n5 potentially harsh shutdown in the Fifth Circuit.  Nowhere in the administrative record did\n6 the Attorney General or the agency consider whether defending the program in court would\n7 (or would not) be worth the litigation risk.  The new spin by government counsel is a classic\n8 post hoc rationalization.  That alone is dispositive of the new “litigation risk” rationale.\n9 Significantly, the INA itself makes clear that once the Attorney General had determined\n10 that DACA was illegal, the Acting Secretary had to accept his ruling as “controlling.”  Section\nt 11 1103(a)(1) of Title 8, a provision that allocates immigration power and duties among the\nr\nu\no a 12 Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General, provides that\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 “determinations and rulings by the Attorney General with respect to all questions of law shall be\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 controlling.”  Therefore, once the Attorney General advised the Acting Secretary that DACA\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 was illegal, that ruling became “controlling” upon her.  She had no choice other than to end\nS N 16 DACA.  She had no room to push back with arguments for the program, to weigh litigation risks,\nted  For the  17 or to consider whether DACA recipients warranted fighting for.  The ruling of law by the\ni\nn\nU\n18 Attorney General, controlling upon her, made all such considerations moot.  Therefore, the new\n19 spin by government counsel that the decisionmaker here indulged in a litigation risk assessment\n20 and, out of caution, chose not to fight for the program in favor of an orderly wind-down is\n21 foreclosed by the INA itself.  Her wind-down references plainly presuppose that DACA had to\n22 end and the only question was how.  \n23 Nevertheless, this order now indulges government counsel’s new explanation and\n24 addresses whether it holds up even if taken as authentic.  In that event, two major criticisms can\n25 and should be made of the “litigation risk management” rationale.  \n26 First, even as to the risk in the Fifth Circuit, the administrative record mentions only\n27 similarities between DAPA and DACA (and even then only in an exceedingly conclusory way). \n28 No mention appears concerning the differences between DAPA and DACA that might have led\n39\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 40 of 49\n1 to a different result.  In addition to the distinctions made above, one powerful consideration\n2 should have been the doctrine of laches.  Unlike the DAPA challenge filed immediately after\n3 DAPA was announced, the threatened DACA challenge by ten states would have come five\n4 years after the program began and after hundreds of thousands of young adults had enrolled and\n5 entered the workforce.  See Abbott Labs., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 155 (1967) (adopting\n6 laches in APA context); see also Arpaio v. Obama, 27 F. Supp. 3d 185, 210 (D.D.C. 2014),\n7 aff’d, 797 F.3d 11 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (noting that even if plaintiff did have standing he could not\n8 demonstrate irreparable harm since he waited two years to challenge DACA).  Another\n9 difference was that DACA was precisely the kind of interstitial program of deferred action\n10 seemingly approved even by the Fifth Circuit, Texas, 809 F.3d at 185, given that both sides of\nt 11 the aisle and our two most recent presidents have called for Dreamer legislation.  Nor was there\nr\nu\no a 12 any mention of our own circuit’s more recent decision in Brewer II that favored DACA, or of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 recognition by the district court in the District of Columbia that DACA had, contrary to the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Fifth Circuit, involved discretionary denials of DACA relief.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Second, if we are to indulge the spin that the decision to end DACA rested on a\nS N 16 litigation-management assessment (rather than on a ruling of illegality), then the Acting\nted  For the  17 Secretary committed a serious error.  Against the litigation risk the Acting Secretary should\ni\nn\nU\n18 have — but did not — weigh DACA’s programmatic objectives as well as the reliance interests\n19 of DACA recipients.  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, — U.S. —, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126–27\n20 (2016).  This responsibility lay with the Acting Secretary, not the Attorney General.  That is,\n21 once the Acting Secretary was informed of the supposed litigation risk, it remained her\n22 responsibility to balance it against competing policy considerations.  It remained her\n23 responsibility to recognize the litigation risk, yet still ask whether the program was worth\n24 fighting for.  The administrative record is utterly silent in this regard.  \n25 The agency reversed over five years of DHS policy, did so only one day after the\n26 Attorney General’s letter, and did so just three months after Secretary Kelly had continued the\n27 program (despite the Fifth Circuit’s decision and affirmance).  The Acting Secretary failed to\n28 provide a “reasoned explanation” as to why she was “disregarding facts and circumstances\n40\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 41 of 49\n1 which underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  See F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations,\n2 Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 516 (2009).  \n3 Encino Motorcars seems very close on point.  There, the Supreme Court addressed the\n4 Department of Labor’s reversal of an interpretive regulation construing the Fair Labor Standard\n5 Act’s minimum wage and overtime provisions for car dealership employees.  Our court of\n6 appeals gave Chevron deference to the new interpretation.  The Supreme Court reversed. \n7 In determining whether the regulation was “procedurally defective” — and accordingly whether\n8 the agency’s regulation warranted Chevron deference — the Supreme Court evaluated whether\n9 the agency had given adequate reasons for its decision to reverse course.  Encino Motorcars,\n10 136 S. Ct. at 2125 (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n., 463 U.S. at 43).  The Supreme Court\nt 11 explained (at page 2126) that while agencies are free to change their existing policies, they must\nr\nu\no a 12 provide a reasoned explanation for a change (quotes and citations omitted):\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 In explaining its changed position, an agency must also be\ni C\ntr of  cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious\n Dis District  14 rite liisa nnocet  tihnatet rfeusrttsh ethr ajtu smtiufsict abteio tna kise nd einmtoan adcecdo ubnyt .t h Ien m suecreh  fcaacstes\ntates orthern  15 odfis preogliacryd icnhga nfagcet;s  bauntd t hcairtc au mresatsaonnceeds  ethxaptl aunnadteiorlna yis o nre wedeered for\nS N 16 engendered by the prior policy.

As there,\n23\nthe administrative record here includes no analysis of the “significant reliance issues involved.” \n24\nThe parallel is striking.  In terminating DACA, the administrative record failed to address the\n25\n689,800 young people who had come to rely on DACA to live and to work in this country. \n26\nThese individuals had submitted substantial personal identifying information to the government,\n27\npaid hefty fees, and planned their lives according to the dictates of DACA.  The administrative\n28\n41\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 42 of 49\n1 record includes no consideration to the disruption a rescission would have on the lives of DACA\n2 recipients, let alone their families, employers and employees, schools and communities.17\n3 Ironically, government counsel now cite material outside of the administrative record in\n4 an attempt to show the Acting Secretary considered the plight of DACA recipients (Dkt. 204 at\n5 10, 12, 19–20).  This press release came after the fact and was not part of the administrative\n6 record, and therefore cannot now rescue the agency.  In that respect, Cal. Pub. Util. Comm’n,\n7 No. 16-70481 at 17 n.4 is analogous.  There, our court appeals refused to consider an agency’s\n8 position which was not advanced in connection with the decision under review but, rather, was\n9 offered for the first time afterwards.  \n10 Defendants next argue that because no statute here dictated the factors for an agency to\nt 11 consider in granting or rescinding deferred action, the agency need not have given weight to the\nr\nu\no a 12 benefits of the DACA program or the harm that would be caused to its recipients upon its\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 rescission.  The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that “[c]onsideration of cost reflects\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 the understanding that reasonable regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 advantages and the disadvantages of agency decision.”  Michigan v. EPA, — U.S. —, 135 S. Ct.\nS N 16 2699, 2707 (2015).  While defendants attempt to distinguish Michigan on the ground that the\nted  For the  17 text of the statute required regulation there to be “appropriate and necessary,” they ignore that a\ni\nn\nU\n18 change in agency policy requires the agency to have “good reasons for it.”  Fox TV Stations,\n19 Inc., 556 U.S. at 515.  \n20 Defendants, of course, are correct that when an agency reverses policy it “need not\n21 demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the\n22 reasons for the old one.”  Ibid.  Where, however, an agency abruptly changes course and\n23 terminates a program on which so many people rely, the APA requires “a more detailed\n24 justification.”  Ibid.  Indeed, “[i]t would be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.” \n25 Ibid.  In such cases, “it is not that further justification is demanded by the mere fact of policy\n26 change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that\n27\n17  Here, perhaps in light of Encino Motors, the government does not argue that Chevron deference\n28\nshould be afforded to the Attorney General’s legal conclusion that DACA exceeded the agency’s authority. \n42\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 43 of 49\n1 underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  Id. at 515–16.  Defendants’ attempt to portray\n2 DACA as a program that did not generate reliance interests is unconvincing.  As plaintiffs’\n3 evidence shows, DACA recipients, their employers, their colleges, and their communities all\n4 developed expectations based on the possibility that DACA recipients could renew their deferred\n5 action and work authorizations for additional two-year periods.  \n6 In sum, government counsel’s alternative spin on the administrative record is just a post\n7 hoc rationalization.  But, even if it had been the actual rationale, it was arbitrary, capricious, and\n8 an abuse of discretion under Encino Motors.  \n9 *                         *                         *\n10 Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their\nt 11 claim that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious and must be set aside under the APA. \nr\nu\no a 12 B. Irreparable Harm.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs have clearly demonstrated that they are likely to suffer serious irreparable harm\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 absent an injunction.  Before DACA, Individual Plaintiffs, brought to America as children, faced\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 a tough set of life and career choices turning on the comparative probabilities of being deported\nS N 16 versus remaining here.  DACA gave them a more tolerable set of choices, including joining the\nted  For the  17 mainstream workforce.  Now, absent an injunction, they will slide back to the pre-DACA era and\ni\nn\nU\n18 associated hardship.\n19 The University of California and other entity plaintiffs have also demonstrated that they\n20 face irreparable harm as they begin to lose valuable students and employees in whom they have\n21 invested, and that loss of DACA recipients from the workforce will have a detrimental impact on\n22 their organization interests, economic output, public health, and safety.  \n23 Our court of appeals recently confirmed that “prolonged separation from family\n24 members” and “constraints to recruiting and retaining faculty members to foster diversity and\n25 quality within the University community” are harms which are not compensable with monetary\n26 damages and therefore weigh in favor of finding irreparable harm.  Hawaii v. Trump,\n27 No. 17-17168, 2017 WL 6554184, at *22 (9th Cir. Dec. 22, 2017).  These showings accordingly\n28\n43\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 44 of 49\n1 demonstrate that preliminary relief is appropriate.  Ibid.; see also Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting,\n2 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013).\n3 Defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs are likely to suffer such harms.  Rather, they\n4 argue that these harms will not happen before the phase-out begins on March 5, 2018, the date\n5 by which the undersigned judge had wanted to present a final record and final decision for\n6 appellate review.  \n7 Delays in this case, however, have made it impossible to send a final judgment to our\n8 court of appeals by March 5.  To take only one example, it would be unfair to reach a conclusion\n9 without giving plaintiffs an opportunity to examine the complete administrative record. \n10 Government counsel, however, succeeded in obtaining an order from the Supreme Court\nt 11 postponing proceedings on completing the administrative record until after ruling on its\nr\nu\no a 12 FRCP 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.  As a result, we have yet to receive a complete administrative\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 record.  Although plaintiffs are likely to prevail on even the truncated administrative record, as\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 set forth above, our appellate court might disagree with that conclusion or the agency might seek\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 to cure the flaws in its process via a fresh agency action.  Plaintiffs are entitled to learn of all\nS N 16 flaws, if any more there be, lurking in the whole record.  One such possibility suggested by\nted  For the  17 plaintiffs is that the rescission was contrived to give the administration a bargaining chip to\ni\nn\nU\n18 demand funding for a border wall in exchange for reviving DACA.  A presidential tweet after\n19 our hearing gives credence to this claim.  Another possibility raised by plaintiffs is racial animus. \n20 These theories deserve the benefit of the full administrative record.  It will be impossible to\n21 litigate this case to a fair and final conclusion before March 5.18 \n22\n23\n24\n25\n18  On December 29, 2017, President Trump tweeted:  “The Democrats have been told, and fully\n26\nunderstand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an\nEND to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc.  We must protect our\n27\nCountry at all cost!” (Dkt. No. 227-2).  Plaintiffs separately request judicial notice of this tweet.  Defendants\nobject to judicial notice on various relevancy grounds, but do not argue that it is not properly subject to judicial\n28\nnotice under FRE 201 (Dkt. Nos. 227, 230).  Plaintiffs’ request is accordingly GRANTED.  \n44\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 45 of 49\n1 C. Balance of Equities and Public Interest.\n2 On provisional relief motions, district judges must consider whether (or not) such relief\n3 would be in the public interest.  On this point, we seem to be in the unusual position wherein the\n4 ultimate authority over the agency, the Chief Executive, publicly favors the very program the\n5 agency has ended.  In September, President Trump stated his support for DACA, tweeting: \n6 “Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who\n7 have jobs, some serving in the military?  Really! . . . .”  He has also called upon Congress to\n8 ratify DACA, tweeting, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama\n9 Administration was unable to do).  If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!” (App. 1958). \n10 For the reasons DACA was instituted, and for the reasons tweeted by President Trump,\nt 11 this order finds that the public interest will be served by DACA’s continuation (on the conditions\nr\nu\no a 12 and exceptions set out below).  Beginning March 5, absent an injunction, one thousand\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 individuals per day, on average, will lose their DACA protection.  The rescission will result in\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 hundreds of thousands of individuals losing their work authorizations and deferred action status. \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 This would tear authorized workers from our nation’s economy and would prejudice their being\nS N 16 able to support themselves and their families, not to mention paying taxes to support our nation. \nted  For the  17 Too, authorized workers will lose the benefit of their employer-provided healthcare plans and\ni\nn\nU\n18 thus place a greater burden on emergency healthcare services.  \n19 On provisional relief motions, district judges must also weigh the balance of hardships\n20 flowing from a grant versus denial of provisional relief.  The hardship to plaintiffs need not be\n21 repeated.  The only hardship raised by defendants is interference with the agency’s judgment on\n22 how best to allocate its resources in keeping our homeland secure, as well as its judgment in\n23 phasing out DACA.  Significantly, however, the agency’s judgment here was not based on a\n24 policy change.  It was based on a mistake of law.  If the instant order is correct that DACA fell\n25 within the statutory and constitutional powers of the Executive Branch, then a policy supported\n26\n27\n28\n45\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 46 of 49\n1 as high up as our Chief Executive has been the victim of a colossal blunder.  A preliminary\n2 injunction will set that right without imposing any policy unwanted by the Executive Branch.19\n3 D. Scope of Provisional Relief. \n4 For the foregoing reasons, defendants ARE HEREBY ORDERED AND ENJOINED, pending\n5 final judgment herein or other order, to maintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis on\n6 the same terms and conditions as were in effect before the rescission on September 5, 2017,\n7 including allowing DACA enrollees to renew their enrollments, with the exceptions (1) that new\n8 applications from applicants who have never before received deferred action need not be\n9 processed; (2) that the advance parole feature need not be continued for the time being for\n10 anyone; and (3) that defendants may take administrative steps to make sure fair discretion is\nt 11 exercised on an individualized basis for each renewal application.  \nr\nu\no a 12 Nothing in this order prohibits the agency from proceeding to remove any individual,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 including any DACA enrollee, who it determines poses a risk to national security or public\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 safety, or otherwise deserves, in its judgment, to be removed.  Nor does this order bar the agency\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 from granting advance parole in individual cases it finds deserving, or from granting deferred\nS N 16 action to new individuals on an ad hoc basis.  \nted  For the  17 The agency shall post reasonable public notice that it will resume receiving DACA\ni\nn\nU\n18 renewal applications and prescribe a process consistent with this order.  The agency shall keep\n19 records of its actions on all DACA-related applications and provide summary reports to the\n20 Court (and counsel) on the first business day of each quarter.20  \n21\n22\n19  If a likelihood of irreparable injury is shown and an injunction is in the public interest, a preliminary\ninjunction is also appropriate when a plaintiff demonstrates that serious questions going to the merits are raised\n23\nand the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff’s favor.  Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell,\n632 F.3d 1127, 1134–35 (9th Cir. 2011).  Because plaintiffs have clearly demonstrated a likelihood of\n24\nirreparable injury and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in plaintiffs’ favor, preliminary relief would also\nbe appropriate under this alternative standard of review.  \n25\n20  A mandatory injunction orders a responsible party to take action, while “[a] prohibitory injunction\n26\nprohibits a party from taking action and preserves the status quo pending a determination of the action on the\nmerits.”  Brewer I, 757 F.3d at 1060.  The relevant status quo is the legally relevant relationship between the\n27\nparties before the controversy arose.  Id. at 1061.  Here, plaintiffs contest the validity of defendants’ rescission\nof DACA, the status quo before which was that DACA was fully implemented.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’\n28\nrequested preliminary injunction is not mandatory.  But even if it were, plaintiffs have demonstrated that\nsufficiently serious irreparable harm would result to warrant even a mandatory injunction.  \n46\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 47 of 49\n1 By way of explanation, while plaintiffs have demonstrated that DACA recipients,\n2 as well as their families, schools, employers, and communities, are likely to suffer substantial,\n3 irreparable harm as a result of the rescission, they have not made a comparable showing as to\n4 individuals who have never applied for or obtained DACA.  \n5 This order will not require advance parole.  Unlike the widespread harm to plaintiffs and\n6 our economy that would result were the 689,800 DACA enrollees to lose their ability to work in\n7 this country, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that comparable harm will occur as a result of\n8 DACA recipients’ inability to travel abroad.  True, Individual Plaintiffs Jirayut Latthivongskorn\n9 and Norma Ramirez describe professional disadvantages that may result if they are unable to\n10 travel internationally.  These, however, do not amount to hardships justifying a provisional\nt 11 injunction requiring DHS to resume accepting applications for advance parole.  However, as\nr\nu\no a 12 stated, nothing in this order would bar individuals from asking for such agency relief or bar the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 agency from granting it in deserving cases.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 With respect to geographical scope, this order finds a nationwide injunction is\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 appropriate.  Our country has a strong interest in the uniform application of immigration law\nS N 16 and policy.  Plaintiffs have established injury that reaches beyond the geographical bounds\nted  For the  17 of the Northern District of California.  The problem affects every state and territory of the\ni\nn\nU\n18 United States. \n19 In February 2017, our court of appeals considered this very issue in Washington v.\n20 Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 2017), and upheld a nationwide injunction imposed by a\n21 single district court, observing that limiting the geographic scope of an injunction on an\n22 immigration enforcement policy “would run afoul of the constitutional and statutory\n23 requirements for uniform immigration law and policy” and that, as here, “the government ha[d]\n24 not proposed a workable alternative.”  Indeed, the Fifth Circuit reached the same conclusion in\n25 determining the appropriate scope of an injunction over DAPA, Texas, 809 F.3d at 187–88,\n26\n27\n28\n47\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 48 of 49\n1 holding that uniform application of the immigration laws justified a nationwide injunction.  So\n2 too here.21\n3 Limiting relief to the States in suit or the Individual Plaintiffs would result in\n4 administrative confusion and simply provoke many thousands of individual lawsuits all over the\n5 country.  The most practical relief is to maintain DACA in the same manner to which the agency\n6 and recipients are accustomed, subject to the exceptions above noted.  \n7 CONCLUSION\n8 Defendants’ motion to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(1) is GRANTED IN PART only to the\n9 limited extent stated above and is otherwise DENIED.  Maine and Minnesota’s APA claims are\n10 hereby DISMISSED.  Maine or Minnesota may seek leave to amend and will have 21 CALENDAR\nt 11 DAYS from the date of this order to file a motion, noticed on the normal 35-day track, for leave to\nr\nu\no a 12 file an amended complaint.  A proposed amended complaint must be appended to the motion and\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 plaintiffs must plead their best case.  Any such motion should clearly explain how the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 amendments to the complaint cure the deficiencies identified herein.  To the extent stated above,\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 plaintiffs’ motion for provisional relief is GRANTED.  A separate order will address defendants’\nS N 16 motion to dismiss pursuant to FRCP 12(b)(6).\nted  For the  17 CERTIFICATION UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)\ni\nn\nU\n18 Pursuant to our court of appeals’ order dated December 21, 2017, the district court\n19 hereby certifies for interlocutory appeal the issues decided herein (i) whether (or not) the\n20 rescission of DACA is unreviewable as committed to agency discretion or by reason of 8 U.S.C.\n21 § 1252(g), (ii) whether (or not) plaintiffs have standing, and (iii) all other questions interposed\n22 by the government in its motion to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)(1).  This order finds that these are\n23 controlling questions of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and\n24\n25\n21  Oddly, the government’s contrary authority is Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1169–70 (9th Cir.\n1987), a decision in which our court of appeals upheld a nationwide injunction and held, “[t]here is no general\n26\nrequirement that an injunction affect only the parties in the suit,” and “nationwide relief in federal district or\ncircuit court [is permitted] when it is appropriate.”  Bresgal merely observed that “[w]here relief can be\n27\nstructured on an individual basis, it must be narrowly tailored to remedy the specific harm shown.”  Id. at 1170. \nHere, it cannot be so structured.  Nor are any of the government’s other authorities, which restate the general\n28\nproposition that a remedy should match the injury alleged, see, e.g., Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc.,\n137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017), to the contrary. \n48\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 48   Filed 01/09/18   Page 49 of 49\n1 that their resolution by the court of appeals will materially advance the litigation.  This order\n2 realizes that the same issues are reviewable upon appeal of this injunction.

Plaintiffs  County  of Santa  Clara  (“County”)  and  Service  Employees  International \nUnion  Local  521  (“Local  521”’),  acting  in  its  capacity  as  the  representative  of more  than  10,000 \nCounty  employees,  challenge  the  actions  of Defendants  President  Donald  J.  Trump,  Attorney \nGeneral  Jefferson  Beauregard  Sessions,  and  Acting  Department  of Homeland  Security  (“DHS’’) \nSecretary  Elaine  Duke  related  to  the  rescission  of the  Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals \n(“DACA”)  program.  DACA  affords  a  two-year period  of  “deferred  action”  status  for  young  people \nwho  were  brought  to  this  country  as  children,  meaning  that  recipients  are  not  subject  to  immigration \nenforcement  actions  during  that  time.  Recipients  are  also  afforded  the  opportunity  to  receive  work \n10 \nauthorization,  allowing  them  to  work  legally,  report  income,  and  pay  taxes.  Because  of DACA, \n11 \napproximately  800,000  young  people,  brought  to  this  country  as  children,  have  been  able  to  come \n12 \nout  of the  shadows  of American  life,  work  legally  to  support  themselves  and  their  families,  go  to \n13 \nschool,  pay  taxes,  and  participate  more  fully  in  their  communities.  The  DACA  program  has  been \n14 \nhugely  successful.  But  the  benefits  the  program  provided  communities  locally  and  nationally  are \n      \n15 \nnow  at  risk,  as  are  the  futures  of DACA  recipients. \n16 \n2.  Because  of the  stringent  requirements  governing  eligibility  for  the  DACA  program \n17 \nfrom  its  inception,  DACA  recipients  are  undeniably  contributing  members  of society  who  pose  no \n18 \nthreat  to  public  safety  or  national  security.  These  individuals  find  themselves  on  the  wrong  side  of \n19 \nAmerica’s  immigration  laws  through  no  fault  of their  own,  and  have  made  substantial  contributions \n20 \nto  their  communities  despite  the  constant  threat  of removal  they  faced  prior  to  receiving  DACA \n21 \nstatus. \n22 \n3.  DACA  has  conferred  innumerable  benefits  on  recipients,  their  families,  and  their \n23 \ncommunities.  DACA  recipients  can  live  their  lives  in  the  open  and  more  fully  participate  in  civic \n24 \nlife,  including  by  working  legally,  attending  college  (and  receiving  financial  aid  to  do  so),  opening \n25 \nbank  accounts,  paying  taxes,  and  living  free  of the  daily  fear  of deportation.  The  families  of DACA \n26 \nrecipients  benefit  from  the  higher  wages  many  recipients  are  able  to  earn  and  the  stability  of \n27 \nknowing  that  loved  ones  will  not  be  separated.  The  communities  in  which  DACA  recipients  live \n28 \nbenefit  not  only  from  the  taxes  paid  by  recipients  as  they  work  legally  and  report  income,  but  also \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Documenti1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  3  of  28 \nfrom  DACA  recipients’  increased  willingness  to  interact  with  government  institutions,  such  as  by \ncontacting  and  cooperating  with  law  enforcement. \n4.  To  induce  individuals  to  apply  for  DACA,  the  federal  government  assured  potential \napplicants  that  the  information  they  provided  in  connection  with  the  program  would  not  be  used  for \nimmigration  enforcement.  These  representations,  made  consistently  throughout  the  life  of the \nDACA  program,  were  crucial  to  encouraging  participation.  The  government  asked  DACA \napplicants  to  take  a  leap  of faith  in  identifying  themselves  and,  indirectly,  their  families,  to  the  very \ngovernment  agency  that  possesses  the  authority  to  detain  them  and  ultimately  to  deport  them  from \nthe  country.  DACA  applicants  were  asked  to  provide  information  concerning,  among  other  things, \n10 \ntheir  names,  addresses,  places  of birth,  dates  of entry  to  the  United  States,  and  any  criminal  histories. \n11 \nBecause  of the  huge  risk  undertaken  by  DACA  applicants  in  providing  this  information  to  the \n12 \nfederal  government,  most  were  willing  to  do  so  only  in  reliance  on  the  government’s  repeated \n13 \nassurances  that  this  information  would  not  be  used  for  immigration  enforcement  purposes. \n14 \n5.  The  DACA  program  also  provided  recipients  the  opportunity  to  renew  their  deferred \n      \n15 \naction  status  at  the  end  of each  two-year  period  for  which  status  is  granted.  From  the  time  that \n16 \nDACA  was  implemented  until  Defendants’  recent  actions,  the  federal  government  has  consistently \n17 \nassured  DACA  applicants  that  they  will  remain  eligible  for  renewed  status  and  work  authorization  as \n18 \nlong  as  they  comply  with  all  of the  conditions  of the  program.  This  opportunity  to  renew  is  a  critical \n19 \naspect  of the  program  because  it  would  make  little  sense  for  individuals  to  risk  coming  forward  to \n20 \nidentify  themselves  as  lacking  regular  immigration  status  in  exchange  for  a  temporary  benefit. \n21 \nSimilarly,  it  would  make  little  sense  for  employers,  like  the  County,  to  expend  the  time  and \n22 \nresources  to  hire  and  train  DACA  recipients  if their  work  authorization  were  so  limited. \n23 \n6.  Despite  the  program’s  extensive  benefits,  on  September  5,  2017,  Acting  Secretary \n24 \nDuke  issued  a  memorandum  formally  rescinding  DACA.  The  memorandum  stated  that  DHS  would \n25 \nnot  consider  any  initial  DACA  applications  received  after  September  5,  2017  and  explained  that \n26 \nthose  individuals  who  currently  have  DACA  status  and  work  authorization  would  no  longer  be  able \n27 \nto  renew  that  status  after  October  5,  2017.  Unlike  the  administrative  actions  creating  the  DACA \n28 \nprogram,  which  afforded  officials  significant  discretion  to  decide  on  a  case-by-case  basis  when  it  is \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n2 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Documenti1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  4  of  28 \nappropriate  to  grant  deferred  action  status  and  work  authorization,  the  policy  announced  by  Acting \nSecretary  Duke’s  September  5  memorandum  is  categorical  —  the  DACA  program  is  discontinued  and \nno  individual,  no  matter  how  deserving,  will  be  able  to  apply  for  deferred  action  and  work \nauthorization  pursuant  to  DACA.  Acting  Secretary  Duke’s  memorandum  did  not  explain  the \nadministration’s  reasons  for  rescinding  DACA  (other  than  to  speculate  that  it  may  be  held  unlawful, \ndespite  the  federal  government’s  previous  position  to  the  contrary),  and  gave  no  indication  that  the \nadministration  had  considered  the  benefits  of the  program  before  ending  it  so  abruptly. \n7.  Defendants’  actions  in  rescinding  the  DACA  program  are  unlawful.  First,  they \nviolate  the  Due  Process  Clause  of the  Fifth  Amendment  because  they  deprive  Plaintiffs  of \n10 \nconstitutionally  protected  interests,  including  Plaintiffs’  interests  in  their  mutual  employment \n11 \nagreements  and  DACA  recipients’  interest  in  the  continuation  of the  DACA  program,  upon  which \n12 \nthey  have  been  induced  to  rely.  Indeed,  the  DACA  program  permitted  recipients  to  work  legally,  to \n13 \nparticipate  in  other  government  programs,  to  open  bank  accounts,  and  to  participate  in  civic  life  in \n14 \nmyriad  ways  which  will  now  be  unavailable  to  them.  Each  of these  activities  gives  rise  to  an  interest \n      \n15 \nprotected  by  the  Due  Process  Clause.  Yet,  deprivation  of these  interests  has  been  accomplished \n16 \nwithout  the  due  process  required  by  law.  Moreover,  insofar  as  the  government  uses  the  information \n17 \nprovided  by  DACA  applicants  for  immigration  enforcement  purposes  —  and  having  broken  one \n18 \npromise,  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  Defendants  intend  to  keep  this  subsidiary  promise  —  such \n19 \nuse  will  independently  violate  the  Due  Process  Clause.  Under  the  Due  Process  Clause  the \n20 \ngovernment  may  not  induce  vulnerable  individuals  to  share  information  to  obtain  a  benefit  with  the \n21 \npromise  that  such  information  will  not  be  used  against  them,  only  to  turn  around  and  use  that \n22 \ninformation  against  them.  Immigration  enforcement,  like  all  government  law  enforcement,  must  be \n23 \nfundamentally  fair. \n24 \n8.  Second,  Defendants’  actions  violate  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (“APA”),  5 \n25 \nU.S.C.  §706(2)(A),  because  they  constitute  arbitrary  and  capricious  decision-making.  Indeed,  this \n26 \ncase  presents  an  archetypal  example  of arbitrary  decision-making  in  that  Defendants  have  terminated \n27 \na  program  implemented  five  years  ago,  and  upon  which  millions  of Americans  (DACA  recipients, \n28 \ntheir  families,  and  employers)  have  come  to  rely,  with  no  explanation  whatsoever  for  the  abrupt \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n3 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Documenti1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  5  of  28 \nabout-face,  much  less  the  type  of careful  analysis  one  would  expect  before  such  a  consequential \naction  is  taken.  The  APA  requires  that  administrative  agencies  provide  a  reasoned  explanation  for \ntheir  actions,  and  this  obligation  is  especially  important  where  the  agency  action  in  question  reverses \na  prior  policy  that  has  engendered  reliance  by  affected  parties.  Defendants’  total  disregard  for \nPlaintiffs’  and  similarly  situated  parties’  reliance  on  the  DACA  program  is  evident  in  their  failure  to \nprovide  any  reasoned  explanation  for  the  rescission  that  takes  into  account  the  program’s  benefits. \n9.  Third,  Defendants’  actions  violate  the  Equal  Protection  component  of the  Fifth \nAmendment.  The  Fifth  Amendment  requires  that  the  federal  government  afford  all  individuals  equal \nprotection  of the  laws  and  refrain  from  discriminating  against  disfavored  classes.  In  this  case,  it  is \n10 \ninarguable  that  the  rescission  of DACA  falls  most  heavily  on  two  historically  persecuted  minorities, \n11 \nLatinos  and  Mexican  immigrants.  Indeed,  93%  of the  approved  DACA  applications  (initial  and \n12 \nrenewal)  since  the  program  was  implemented  are  from  immigrants  from  Latin  America  and  almost \n13 \n80%  are  from  immigrants  from  Mexico.  Moreover,  there  is  extensive  evidence,  not  least  of which \n14 \nare  the  President’s  own  statements,  that  the  rescission  was  motivated  by  impermissible  animus.  Two \n      \n15 \nyears  ago,  the  President  launched  his  campaign  by  announcing:  “When  Mexico  sends  its  people, \n16 \nthey’re  not  sending  their  best....  They’re  sending  people  that  have  lots  of problems,  and  they’re \n17 \nbring  those  problems  with  us  [sic].  They’re  bringing  drugs.  They’re  bringing  crime.  They’re \n18 \nrapists.”  This  hostility  toward  immigrants,  and  particularly  Mexican  immigrants,  remained  a  theme \n19 \nthroughout  his  campaign  and  the  first  months  of his  administration.  Coupled  with  the  lack  of a \n20 \nlegitimate  explanation  for  the  rescission  and  the  irregular  (and  unlawful)  process  by  which  the \n21 \nrescission  was  accomplished,  the  President’s  repeated  statements  of animus  show  that  the  rescission \n22 \nwas  motivated  by  animus  in  violation  of the  Fifth  Amendment. \n23 \n10.  For  all  of these  reasons,  Plaintiffs  ask  this  Court  to  declare  the  rescission  of DACA \n24 \nunlawful  and  unenforceable,  and  to  enjoin  and  restrain  Defendants  from  taking  further  steps  to \n25 \nrescind  the  program.  Further,  the  Court  should  declare  that  Defendants  are  equitably  estopped  from \n26 \nrescinding  the  program  or  using  information  provided  in  connection  with  DACA  applications  for \n27 \npurposes  of immigration  enforcement,  and  should  enjoin  and  restrain  Defendants  from  doing  so. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n4 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page 6  of  28 \nThe  DACA  program  has  worked  to  the  benefit  of DACA  recipients,  their  employers,  local \ncommunities,  and  American  society  as  a  whole.  All  of these  stakeholders  deserve  better. \nJURISDICTION  AND  VENUE \n11.  This  Court  has jurisdiction  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§1331,  1361,  and  2201-2202, \nbecause  this  action  arises  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  and  Equal  Protection  component  of the  Fifth \nAmendment  and  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  5  U.S.C.  §551  et  seg.  This  Court  has  additional \nremedial  authority  under  the  APA,  5  U.S.C.  §§701-06. \n12.  There  exists  an  actual  and justiciable  controversy  between  Plaintiffs  and  Defendants \nrequiring  resolution  by  this  Court.  Plaintiffs  have  no  adequate  remedy  at  law. \n10 \n13.  Venue  is  proper  in  the  Northern  District  of California  because  Plaintiff County  of \n11 \nSanta  Clara  is  a  public  entity  in  this judicial  district  and  a  substantial  part  of the  events  or  omissions \n12 \ngiving  rise  to  this  action  have  occurred  or  will  occur  in  this  District.  28  U.S.C.  §81391(b)(2), \n13 \n1391(e)(1).  Plaintiff Local  521  is  located  in  the  Northern  District  of California  and  many  of its \n14 \nmembers,  on  behalf of whom  it  brings  this  lawsuit,  reside  and  are  employed  within  the  Northern \n      \n15 \nDistrict  of California.  This  is  a  civil  action  in  which  Defendants  are  agencies  of the  United  States  or \n16 \nofficers  thereof and  no  real  property  is  involved  in  this  action. \n17 \n14.  Intra-district  assignment  is  proper  in  San  Jose  pursuant  to  Local  Rules  3-2(c)  and  (e) \n18 \nbecause  a  substantial  part  of the  events  or  omissions  which  give  rise  to  Plaintiffs’  claims  occurred  in \n19 \nSanta  Clara  County. \n20 \nPARTIES \n21 \n15.  Plaintiff County  of  Santa  Clara  is  a  charter  county  organized  and  existing  under  the \n22 \nlaws  of the  State  of California.  With  an  estimated  population  of more  than  1.9  million  people,  Santa \n23 \nClara  County  is  the  largest  county  in  the  Bay  Area  and  the  sixth  largest  county  in  California.  As  a \n24 \ncounty  of immigrants,  the  County  has  especially  benefited  from  DACA  and  is  especially  harmed  by \n25 \nthe  program’s  rescission.  Thirty-eight  percent  of  Santa  Clara  County  residents  are  foreign  born,  and \n26 \napproximately  sixty  percent  of children  in  the  county  have  at  least  one  parent  who  is  foreign  born. \n27 \nSanta  Clara  County  has  the  highest  percentage  of foreign-born  residents  of  all  counties  in  California. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n5 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Documenti1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  7  of  28 \nMore  than  half of county  residents  speak  a  language  other  than  English  at  home,  and  more  than  100 \nlanguages  and  dialects  are  spoken  within  the  county. \n16.  The  County  is  the  level  of government  tasked  with  provision  of core  safety-net \nservices  to  this  diverse  community;  it  employs  a  workforce  of more  than  18,000,  and  must  ensure \nthat  this  workforce  possesses  the  skills  necessary  to  effectively  serve  this  community.  The  County \nemploys  DACA  recipients  in  key  positions  throughout  the  organization,  providing  upward  mobility \nto  young  people  who  deserve  the  opportunity  to  serve  their  communities  through  the  public  sector, \nand  leveraging  the  unique  experience  and  skills  these  employees  bring  to  the  County  government. \n17.  The  County  also  operates  the  In-Home  Supportive  Services  (“ITHSS”)  program,  which \n10 \nprovides  in-home  care  in  the  form  of assistance  with  activities  of daily  living,  to  eligible  aged,  blind, \n11 \nand  disabled  individuals  who  would  otherwise  be  unable  to  remain  safely  in  their  own  homes.  The \n12 \nIHSS  program  is  funded  through  a  combination  of federal,  state,  and  county  funds,  and  provides \n13 \nservices  to  over  22,000  IHSS  beneficiaries  in  Santa  Clara  County. \n14 \n18.  Plaintiff Service  Employees  International  Union  Local  521  is  a  labor  union  that \n      \n15 \nrepresents  approximately  40,000  public-  and  private-sector  workers  in  the  central  Bay  Area  and \n16 \nCalifornia’s  Central  Valley,  including  more  than  10,000  who  are  employed  by  the  County  of  Santa \n17 \nClara.  Local  521  is  an  affiliate  of the  Service  Employees  International  Union  (“SEIU”),  which \n18 \nrepresents  2.2  million  working  men  and  women  around  the  world.  A  large  percentage  of Local \n19 \n521’s  membership  is  Latino  and  many  are  first-generation  immigrants.  The  primary  mission  of \n20 \nLocal  521  is  to  organize,  represent,  and  empower  employees. \n21 \n19.  In  addition,  Local  521  works  in  partnership  with  SEIU  and  other  groups  to  combat \n22 \ndiscrimination  and  mobilize  for  immigration  reform  at  the  national  level.  Local  521’s  efforts  include \n23 \nits  Committee  on  Comprehensive  Immigration  Reform,  a  member-based  committee  that  engages  in \n24 \norganizing,  advocacy,  and  education  to  help  undocumented  workers.  Local  521  has  conducted \n25 \n“know  your  rights”  information  sessions  and  workshops,  engaged  in  legislative  advocacy  on \n26 \nimmigration-related  bills  at  the  state  level,  held  community  forums  on  DACA  and  Deferred  Action \n27 \nfor  Parents  of Americans  and  Lawful  Permanent  Residents  in  conjunction  with  the  California \n28 \nAttorney  General,  and  participated  as  an  amicus  in  litigation  brought  by  the  County  of Santa  Clara \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n6 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  8  of  28 \nand  others  challenging  the  Trump  administration’s  threat  to  cut  off federal  funding  to  sanctuary  cities \nand  counties.  Local  521  has  members  who  are  DACA  recipients,  including  members  who  work  for \nthe  County  of  Santa  Clara.  These  members  are  able  to  work  and,  thus,  to  be  Local  521  members, \nbecause  of the  work  authorization  they  obtain  through  the  DACA  program. \n20.  Local  521  brings  this  action  as  an  associational  plaintiff on  behalf of its  members  who \nare  DACA  recipients,  asserting  claims  on  behalf of those  members.  Local  521  also  brings  this \nlawsuit  to  protect  the  rights  and  interests  of its  members  and  prospective  members,  to  preserve  its \nability  to  organize  new  members  who  are  DACA  recipients,  and  to  preserve  its  representational \nrelationship  with  current  DACA  recipients. \n10 \n21.  Defendant  Donald  J.  Trump  is  the  President  of the  United  States.  President  Trump \n11 \nmade  the  decision  to  rescind  the  DACA  program  and  is  sued  in  his  official  capacity. \n12 \n22.  Defendant  Jefferson  Beauregard  Sessions  is  the  Attorney  General  of the  United \n13 \nStates.  Attorney  General  Sessions  announced  the  rescission  of the  DACA  program  and  has  ultimate \n14 \nauthority  over  the  Department  of Justice’s  prosecution  of violations  of immigration  laws.  He  is  sued \n      \n15 \nin  his  official  capacity. \n16 \n23.  Defendant  Elaine  Duke  is  the  Acting  Secretary  of the  Department  of Homeland \n17 \nSecurity  (“DHS”).  Acting  Secretary  Duke  is  responsible  for  managing  DHS,  and  oversees  the \n18 \nUnited  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Service  (“USCIS”)  and  the  Immigration  and  Customs \n19 \nEnforcement  (“ICE”).  Her  responsibilities  include  the  administration  and  enforcement  of policies \n20 \nand  practices  related  to  DACA.  She  is  sued  in  her  official  capacity. \n21 \n24.  Defendant  DHS  is  a  federal  agency  responsible  for  implementing,  administering  and \n22 \nenforcing  the  nation’s  immigration  laws  and  policies,  including  the  DACA  program.  DHS  isa \n23 \nDepartment  of the  Executive  Branch  and  is  an  agency  within  the  meaning  of 5  U.S.C.  §552(f)(1). \n24 \nFACTUAL  BACKGROUND \n25 \nThe  DACA  Program \n26 \n25.  DHS  announced  the  DACA  program  in  2012,  in  a  memorandum  issued  by  former \n27 \nDHS  Secretary  Janet  Napolitano.  The  reasoning  behind  the  program  was  that  it  made  no  sense  to \n28 \npunish  individuals  who  were  brought  to  the  United  States  as  children,  through  no  fault  of their  own, \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n7 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Documenti1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  9  of  28 \nand  who  had  proven  themselves  to  be  trustworthy,  contributing  members  of their  communities. \nDACA  was  also  intended  to  generate  the  wide-reaching  benefits  that  would  accrue  to  recipients,  their \nfamilies  and  their  communities,  as  undocumented  individuals  were  permitted  to  live  and  work \nwithout  the  ever-present  threat  of deportation. \n26.  DACA  allows  people  who  were  brought  to  the  United  States  as  children  and  who \nmeet  certain  criteria  to  apply  for  temporary  deferral  of deportation  (sometimes  referred  to  as \n“deferred  action’’)  and  for  work  authorization.  According  to  USCIS,  as  of March  31,  2017, \napproximately  800,000  young  people  have  been  granted  deferred  action  under  DACA  in  the  five \nyears  the  program  has  been  in  place.  Applicants  are  eligible  for  deferred  action  status  under  DACA \n10 \nonly  if they:  (1)  were  under  the  age  of  31  on  June  15,  2012;  (1)  were  brought  to  the  United  States \n11 \nbefore  their  16th  birthday;  (411)  continuously  resided  in  the  United  States  since  June  15,  2007  to  the \n12 \npresent;  (iv)  were  physically  present  in  the  United  States  on  June  15,  2012,  and  at  the  time  they  made \n13 \ntheir  DACA  application;  (v)  did  not  have  lawful  immigration  status  on  June  15,  2012;  (vi)  are \n14 \ncurrently  in  school,  have  graduated  or  obtained  a  GED,  or  were  honorably  discharged  from  the \n      \n15 \nUnited  States  military  or  Coast  Guard;  and  (vii)  have  not  been  convicted  of a  felony,  significant \n16 \nmisdemeanor,  or  three  or  more  misdemeanors,  and  do  not  pose  a  threat  to  national  security  or  public \n17 \nsafety. \n18 \n27.  To  apply  for  deferred  action  status  under  DACA,  applicants  are  required  to  pay  a \n19 \nsubstantial  fee  of $495,  submit  a  detailed  application,  and  submit  to  a  background  check  and  any \n20 \nother  screening  that  DHS  deems  necessary. \n21 \n28.  Pursuant  to  DACA,  deferred  action  status,  as  well  as  work  authorization,  is  granted \n22 \nfor  two-year periods.  From  the  time  DACA  was  first  implemented,  however,  applicants  were  told \n23 \nthat  they  would  have  the  opportunity  to  apply  for  renewal  of deferred  action  status  and  were  given \n24 \ndetailed  instructions  for  doing  so.  In  particular,  recipients  were  instructed  that  they  should  apply  for \n25 \nrenewal  approximately  120  days  (but  no  more  than  150  days)  before  the  expiration  of their  2-year \n26 \nperiod.  Recipients  were  told  that  they  would  be  eligible  for  renewal  if they  met  the  requirements  for \n27 \nan  initial  DACA  application  and  also:  (4)  had  not  departed  the  United  States  on  or  after  June  15, \n28 \n2007;  (11)  continuously  resided  in  the  United  States  since  submission  of their  most  recent  DACA \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n8 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  10  of  28 \napplication;  and  (iii)  had  not  in  the  interim  been  convicted  of a  disqualifying  crime  or  otherwise \nposed a  threat  to  national  security  or  public  safety.  The  opportunity  to  renew  is  a  crucial  aspect  of \nthe  DACA  program.  There  is  little  reason  for  eligible  individuals  to  run  the  risk  of identifying \nthemselves  as  lacking  regular  immigration  status  for  a  temporary  benefit  and,  similarly,  there  is  little \nreason  for  employers  to  take  the  time  and  effort  to  hire  and  train  DACA  recipients  who  have \nreceived  work  authorization  unless  there  is  some  assurance  that  those  individuals  will  be  eligible  to \nrenew  that  authorization. \n29.  As  part  of the  DACA  application  process,  Defendants  solicited  extensive  information \nfrom  DACA  recipients,  including  names,  addresses,  birthdates,  country  of origin,  and  educational \n10 \nand  criminal  history.  Most  significantly,  by  issuing  an  open  invitation  to  apply  for  DACA,  the \n11 \ngovernment  asked  undocumented  immigrants  to  take  a  leap  of faith  and  identify  themselves  and, \n12 \nindirectly,  their  families  to  the  federal  government  and  acknowledge  their  undocumented  status.  To \n13 \nassuage  fears  that  the  DACA  program  was  a  cynical  trap,  Defendants  expressly  promised  that  the \n14 \ninformation  provided  by  DACA  applicants  would  not  be  used  against  them  or  their  families  for \n      \n15 \nimmigration  enforcement  purposes,  except  in  narrow,  specified  circumstances  that  would  not \n16 \nnormally  apply  to  individuals  eligible  for  DACA. \n17 \n30.  The  DACA  program  has  been  tremendously  successful,  creating  much-needed \n18 \nstability  for  DACA  recipients,  their  families  and  their  communities,  which  has  resulted  in  extensive \n19 \nbenefits  to  all  of those  groups.  Under  DACA,  law-abiding,  long-term  U.S.  residents  who  lack  legal \n20 \nimmigration  status  have  access  to  better jobs  and  improved  working  conditions.  Because \n21 \nundocumented  immigrants  who  lack  work  authorization  must  seek jobs  that  minimize  their  risk  of \n22 \nbeing  identified  and  deported,  they  often  do  not  work  in jobs  that  best  fit  their  education,  skills,  and \n23 \nabilities,  or  those  that  would  maximize  their  earning  potential.  Patrick  Oakford,  Center  for \n24 \nAmerican  Progress,  Administrative Action  on  Immigration  Reform,  The  Fiscal Benefits  of Temporary \n25 \nWork Permits,  at  6  (September  2014),  available  at:  https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp- \n26 \ncontent/uploads/2014/09/OakfordAdminRelief.pdf  (last  visited  Oct.  9,  2017).  Making  workers \n27 \neligible  to  apply  for  deferred  action  and  work  permits  allows  them  greater  occupational  mobility, \n28 \nenabling  them  to  seek  out  a  wider  range  of potential  career  opportunities.  Moreover,  “[t]he \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n9 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  11  of  28 \ninteraction  between  our broken  immigration  system  and  employment  and  labor  laws  have  made \nundocumented  workers  more  susceptible  to  exploitation  in  the  workplace,  leading  them  to  earn  lower \nwages  than  they  otherwise  could.”  /d.  at  5.  Eliminating  the  fear  of retaliatory  reporting  of \nimmigration  violations  and  potential  deportation  allows  these  workers  to  better protect  their  own \nworkplace  rights  and  those  of their  co-workers,  leading  to  higher  real  wages  and  fewer  violations  of \nemployment  and  labor  laws  and  regulations. \n31.  Those  who  have  received  DACA  status  enjoy  increased  earning  potential,  producing  a \npositive  multiplier  effect  on  local  economies.  Fiscal  Policy  Institute,  President’s  Immigration Action \nExpected  to  Benefit  Economy  (Nov.  21,  2014),  available  at:  http://bit.ly/1FbnS7q  (last  visited  Oct.  9, \n10 \n2017)  (estimating  that  wages  for  those  eligible  for  work  authorization  will  increase  by  five  to  10 \n11 \npercent);  Oakford,  Administrative Action  on  Immigration  Reform,  The  Fiscal Benefits  of Temporary \n12 \nWork Permits,  at  3  (“Temporary  work  permits  would  increase  the  earnings  of undocumented \n13 \nimmigrants  by  about  8.5  percent  as  they  are  able  to  work  legally  and  find jobs  that  match  their \n14 \nskills.”).  Indeed,  the  upward  mobility  afforded  by  DACA  is  apparent  from  the  results  of a  national \n      \n15 \nsurvey  of  1,402  young  adults  who  were  approved  for  DACA  through  June  2013: \n16  Since  receiving  DACA,  young  adult  immigrants  have  become  more  integrated  into \nthe  nation’s  economic  institutions.  Approximately  61%  of DACA  recipients \n17 \nsurveyed  have  obtained  a  new job  since  receiving  DACA.  Meanwhile,  over  half have \nopened  their  first  bank  account,  and  38%  have  obtained  their  first  credit  card. \n18 \n19 \nRoberto  G.  Gonzales  and  Veronica  Terriquez,  American  Immigration  Council,  How  DACA  is \n20 \nImpacting  the  Lives  of Those  who  are  now  DACAmented:  Preliminary  Findings from  the  National \n21 \nUnDACAmented Research  Project  (Aug.  15,  2013),  available  at:  http://bit.ly/ljaSOtgq  (last  visited \n22 \nOct.  9,  2017).  In  short,  DACA  created  significant  economic  benefits  for  qualifying  individuals  and \n23 \nfor  the  nation  at  large  by  permitting  greater  levels  of contribution  to  the  workforce  by  educated \n24 \nindividuals  who  previously  had  limited  employment  opportunities. \n25 \nThe  County’s  Employment  Relationships  With  DACA  Recipients \n26 \n32.  The  County  is  one  of the  largest  employers  in  the  region,  with  more  than  18,000 \n27 \nemployees  performing  a  vast  array  of functions  to  meet  the  needs  of this  diverse  community.  One  of \n28 \nthe  main  ways  in  which  the  County  has  benefited  from  the  DACA  program  is  through  its \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n10 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  12  of  28 \nemployment  relationships  with  DACA  recipients.  In  particular,  the  County  currently  employs  many \nDACA  recipients  as  full-time  employees.  The  County  has  expended  significant  resources,  both  time \nand  money,  in  training  these  employees  and  relies  upon  them  to  provide  County  services.  Because \nDACA  recipients  are  under  no  obligation  to  identify  themselves  as  such  when  they  apply  for  a job, \nand  they  present  the  same  form  of work  authorization  card  as  other  categories  of immigrants,  the \nCounty  cannot  determine  with  certainty  the  total  number  of DACA  recipients  it  employs. \n33.  DACA  recipients  are  also  employed  through  the  County’s  In-Home  Supportive  Services \nprogram,  which  is  funded  through  a  combination  of federal,  state,  and  county  funds. \n34.  DACA  recipients  have  special  skills  that  make  them  especially  valuable  employees  of \n10 \nthe  County.  For  example,  over  ninety-five  percent  of DACA  recipients  are  bilingual.  The  County \n11 \nvalues  this  skill  because  it  must  employ  a  workforce  that  is  able  to  meet  residents’  language  needs  to \n12 \nensure  meaningful  access  to  County  services,  programs,  and  benefits.  See  County  of  Santa  Clara, \n13 \nBoard  Policy  3.58.  Indeed,  forty-six  percent  of clients  currently  receiving  health,  financial,  or \n14 \nemployment  assistance  through  the  County  Department  of Employment  and  Benefit  Services  speak  a \n      \n15 \nprimary  language  other  than  English.  Santa  Clara  Valley  Medical  Center,  a  public  hospital  owned \n16 \nand  operated  by  the  County,  is  required  by  law  to  provide  qualified  interpreters  to  limited-English- \n17 \nproficient  individuals  and  relies  on  medical  interpreters  to  satisfy  that  requirement.  It  takes  an \n18 \naverage  of five  to  six  months  to  fill  interpreter  vacancies  for  the  County’s  hospital  and  clinics,  and \n19 \nthe  County  has  had  difficulty  filling  several  open  positions. \n20 \n35.  If the  DACA  recipients  currently  employed  by  the  County  were  to  lose  their  work \n21 \nauthorization,  the  County  would  be  forced  to  expend  significant  resources  to  temporarily  cover  those \n22 \nemployees’  responsibilities,  conduct  searches  for  replacements,  and  train  new  employees.  On \n23 \naverage,  it  takes  the  County  81  days  to  fill  a  vacancy.  Nearly  all  County  employees,  including  Local \n24 \n521  members,  are  covered  by  merit  system  rules  and  collective  bargaining  agreements  that  protect \n25 \nthem  against  arbitrary  dismissal  and  other  adverse  employment  actions,  and  that  include  anti- \n26 \ndiscrimination  provisions.  Despite  these  protections,  County  employment  is  contingent  on  valid \n27 \nwork  authorization.  Without  the  DACA  program,  these  valued  employees  will  be  unable  to  work  for \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n11 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  13  of  28 \nthe  County  or,  indeed,  to  work  in  any  legal  capacity  for  any  employer,  public  or  private,  within  Santa \nClara  County  or  the  United  States. \n36.  The  County  also  employs  at  least  three  DACA  recipients  in  its  New  Americans \nFellowship  Program.  This  program  aims  to  identify,  recruit,  develop,  and  equip  DACA-eligible \nyouth  with  the  skills  and  tools  to  serve  as  ambassadors  to  the  Santa  Clara  County  community. \nFellows  commit  to  working  at  least  20  hours  per  week,  for  a  period  of no  less  than  10  weeks,  on  a \nproject-based  fellowship  under  the  supervision  of a  County  Department,  the  County  Office  of \nImmigrant  Relations,  or  a  Member  of the  Board  of  Supervisors’  Office.  Examples  of the  types  of \nprojects  on  which  fellows  work  include: \n10 \ne  Research  on  improving/bridging  relationships  between  law  enforcement  and  the \nimmigrant  community; \n11 \ne  Developing  a  plan  for  a  “Community  Safety  Initiative”  focused  on  establishing  problem- \n12 \nsolving  relationships  between  the  immigrant  and  refugee  population  and  local  law \nenforcement; \n13 \ne  Developing  the  framework  for  a  “Civics  Empowerment  Education  Program”  to  establish \n14 \nthe  curriculum  for  immigrants  and  refugees  who  want  to  learn  more  about  law  and \n      \n15  policy; \n16  e  Creating  a  training  in  civic  participation  to  inform  the  community  about  federal,  state, \nand  county  government  structures  and  delivering  presentations  to  decision-making \n17  bodies; \n18  e  Providing  information  to  the  undocumented  population,  including  the  following:  know \nyour  rights  at  home,  in  the  work  place,  and  when  seeking  services  via  immigration \n19 \nconsultants; \n20 \ne  Fraud  prevention  and  education; \n21 \ne  Drafting  or  updating  existing  resources  on  family  emergency  plans; \n22 \ne  Increasing  awareness  of public  services  programs  such  as  Medi-Cal,  CalFresh,  and \nCovered  California; \n23 \ne  Launching  a  countywide  campaign  to  promote  financial  literacy  among  immigrants  and \n24 \nrefugees;  and \n25 \ne  Collaborating  with  banking  institutions  on  providing  financial  planning  tools  for \nimmigrants  and  refugees. \n26 \n27 \n37.  The  County  began  the  New  Americans  Fellowship  Program  in  July  2017.  Since  that \n28 \ntime,  20  fellows  have  participated  in  the  program  and  contributed  significantly  to  the  County  and \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n12 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  14  of  28 \ntheir  communities.  The  County  assigned  ten  fellows  to  County  departments  and  community-based \norganizations  throughout  Santa  Clara  County  and  ten  fellows  participated  in  the  “Silicon  Valley \nDream  Summer,”  a  fellowship  program  that  places  immigrant  youth  at  community-based  and  social \njustice  organizations.  The  County  has  allocated  funding  to  support  additional  fellows  during  the \n2017-2018  fiscal  year,  but  planning  for  the  next  cohort  of fellows  has  been  put  on  hold  due  to \nDefendants’  actions.  Like  other  forms  of County  employment,  the  New  Americans  Fellowship \nProgram  cannot  survive  Defendants’  rescission  of DACA,  for  once  existing  work  authorizations \nexpire,  DACA  participant-employees  will  no  longer  be  able  to  work  for  the  County  and  the  County \nwill  lose  this  bridge  to  their  communities. \n10 \nReliance  on  the  DACA  Program  and  the  Government’s  Representations \n11 \n38.  Trusting  the  federal  government’s  representations  about  the  program,  hundreds  of \n12 \nthousands  of young  people  from  across  the  country  have  applied  for  and  received  DACA  status  since \n13 \nthe  program  was  initiated  in  2012.  The  DACA  program  has  changed  the  lives  of DACA  recipients. \n14 \nPrior  to  DACA,  many  law-abiding  undocumented  young  people  saw  little  purpose  to  completing \n      \n15 \nhigher  education  because  they  would  be  unable  to  work  legally  upon  graduation.  DACA  gave  them \n16 \nthe  ability  to  attend  college,  work  to  earn  money  to  pay  for  higher  education,  and  to  utilize  their \n17 \ndegrees  to  attain  high-skilled jobs.  It  also  gave  them  access  to  health  care,  and  the  opportunity  to \n18 \nbecome  more  integrated  into  their  communities.  DACA  gave  these  young  people  hope  that  a  better \n19 \nlife  was  possible,  and  allowed  them  to  emerge  from  the  shadows  of  society  to  serve  their \n20 \ncommunities,  including  through  work  for  government  agencies  like  the  County  of  Santa  Clara. \n21 \n39,  Loss  of DACA  status  and  work  authorization  would  be  devastating  for  County \n22 \nworkers  who  depend  on  the  DACA  program  to  maintain  employment,  health  insurance,  and  other \n23 \nbenefits.  Indeed,  several  County  employees  with  DACA  status  desired  to join  as  individual  plaintiffs \n24 \nin  this  litigation  challenging  the  DACA  rescission,  but  ultimately  chose  not  to  come  forward  out  of \n25 \nfear  that  Defendants  would  retaliate  against  them  or  their  families. \n26 \nAO.  The  County  has  also  relied  on  the  government’s  representations  concerning  the \n27 \nDACA  program.  The  County  has  expended  significant  time  and  financial  resources  in  hiring  and \n28 \ntraining  DACA  recipients  for  various  positions  in  County.  Those  employees  carry  out  important \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n13 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  15  of  28 \nfunctions  in  County  government  and  make  significant  contributions  in  providing  services  to  County \nresidents.  There  is  little  reason  for  employers  like  the  County  to  take  the  time  and  effort  to  hire  and \ntrain  DACA  recipients  who  have  received  work  authorization  unless  there  is  some  assurance  that \nthose  individuals  will  be  eligible  to  renew  that  authorization. \nOther  Benefits  to  the  County  from  the  DACA  Program \n41.  Santa  Clara  County  is  home  to  Silicon  Valley,  where  many  of the  country’s  leading \nhigh-tech  and  Internet-based  companies  are  located.  Technology  companies  based  in  the  county, \nincluding  Apple  and  Google,  employ  tens  of thousands  of workers.  Similarly,  health  care  providers, \nincluding  Kaiser  Permanente,  Stanford  Hospital  and  Clinics,  and  the  County’s  own  hospital  and \n10 \nclinics,  employ  additional  tens  of thousands.  Many  of these  organizations  employ  DACA  recipients. \n11 \nFor  example,  Tim  Cook,  CEO  of Apple,  recently  noted  that  250  Apple  employees  are  “Dreamers,” \n12 \nor  DACA  recipients.  Silicon  Valley  is  projected  to  face  a  shortfall  of 72,500  private  sector  workers \n13 \nby  the  year  2020,  and  immigration  policies  such  as  DACA,  which  increase  the  availability  of  skilled \n14 \nworkers,  help  address  this  shortfall.  Indeed,  Silicon  Valley  has  long  been  reliant  on  the  contributions \n      \n15 \nof immigrants.  One  study  noted  that  immigrants  launched  a  quarter  of all  engineering  and \n16 \ntechnology  companies  in  the  United  States  from  1995  to  2005,  Vivek  Wadhwa  et  al.,  America’s  New \n17 \nImmigrant Entrepreneurs:  Part I,  Duke  Science,  Tech.  &  Innovation  Paper  No.  23  (Jan.  4,  2007), \n18 \navailable  at:  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id1=592#9#0   (last  visited  Oct.  9, \n19 \n2017),  and  over  half of  Silicon  Valley  start-ups  in  the  same  period  count  at  least  one  immigrant  as  a \n20 \nkey  founder,  Richard  T.  Herman,  Immigrant,  Inc.:  Why  Immigrant  Entrepreneurs  Are  Driving  the \n21 \nNew  Economy  (and  how  they  will  save  the  American  worker)  5  (2009). \n22 \n42.  In  2016,  the  Migration  Policy  Institute  (MPI)  estimated  that  there  were  23,000  DACA- \n23 \neligible  individuals  in  Santa  Clara  County,  including  15,000  who  were  immediately  eligible.  MPI, \n24 \nDeferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals  Data  Tools,  available  at: \n25 \nhttp://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca-profiles \n26 \n(last  visited  Oct.  9,  2017).  According  to  MPI’s  estimates,  Santa  Clara  County  has  the  twelfth  largest \n27 \nDACA-eligible  population  among  counties  nationwide,  and  the  largest  DACA-eligible  population  of \n28 \nall  northern  California  counties.  MPI,  National  and  County  Estimates  of Populations  Eligible  for \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n14 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  16  of  28 \nDeferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals  Program,  2016,  available  at: \nhttp://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/datahub/State-County-DACA-Estimates.xIsx  (last \nvisited  Oct.  9,  2017). \n43.  Ninety-one  percent  of DACA  recipients  are  employed.  John  W.  Schoen,  DACA \nDeportations  Could  Cost  US Economy  More  than  $400 Billion,  CNBC.com  (Sept.  5,  2017), \navailable  at:  https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/05/daca-deportations-could-cost-us-economy-more- \nthan-400-billion.html  (last  visited  Oct.  9,  2017).  It  is  estimated  that  if DACA  recipients  lose  the \nability  to  work  legally,  California  alone  would  suffer  a  GDP  loss  of approximately  $11.3  billion  a \nyear.  Id.  As  one  of the  counties  with  the  largest  number  of DACA  recipients,  much  of this  negative \n10 \neconomic  effect  will  be  felt  in  Santa  Clara  County. \n11 \n44.  Moreover,  because  they  are  able  to  work  legally,  DACA  recipients  are  employed  in \n12 \nmore  highly  compensated jobs  and  contribute  more  in  state  and  local  taxes  than  they  would  without \n13 \nDACA.  One  recent  study  estimates  that  the  1.3  million  young  people  immediately  eligible  for \n14 \nDACA  contribute  $2  billion  a  year  in  state  and  local  taxes.  Institute  on  Taxation  and  Economic \n      \n15 \nPolicy,  State  &  Local  Tax  Contributions  of Young  Undocumented Immigrants  (Apr.  25,  2017), \n16 \navailable  at:  https://itep.org/state-local-tax-contributions-of-young-undocumented-immigrants/  (last \n17 \nvisited  Oct.  9,  2017).  Indeed,  “DACA-eligible  individuals  pay  on  average  8.9  percent  of their \n18 \nincome  in  state  and  local  taxes.  Their  effective  tax  rate  is  higher  than  the  average  rate  paid  by  the \n19 \ntop  1%  of taxpayers  in  state  and  local  taxes....”  Jd.  “Repealing  the  temporary  legal  status  and \n20 \nwork  authorizations  permitted  by  DACA  would  reduce  estimated  state  and  local  revenues  by  nearly \n21 \n$800  million...  .”  Jd.  The  same  study  estimates  that  DACA  eligible  individuals  contribute  more \n22 \nthan  $530  million  in  state  and  local  taxes  in  California  alone  and,  because  Santa  Clara  County  has  a \n23 \nlarge  number  of DACA-eligible  residents,  the  County  stands  to  lose  significant  tax  revenue  because \n24 \nof the  rescission  of DACA. \n25 \n45.  In  addition  to  its  broad  negative  effects  on  the  County’s  economy  and  fisc,  the \n26 \nrescission  of DACA  will  make  it  more  difficult  and  expensive  for  the  County  to  provide  services  to \n27 \nits  residents.  For  example,  DACA  recipients  who  do  not  have  employer-sponsored  insurance  and \n28 \nwho  satisfy  income-eligibility  requirements  qualify  for  “full-scope”  coverage  under  Medi-Cal, \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n15 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  17  of  28 \nCalifornia’s  Medicaid  program.  Through  Medi-Cal,  DACA  recipients  receive  coverage  for  a  core \nset  of health  benefits,  including  preventative  care,  doctor’s  visits,  immunizations,  prescriptions,  and \nmental  health  and  substance  abuse  services.  If these  individuals  lose  deferred  action  status,  they  will \nbe  eligible  only  for  very  limited  Medi-Cal  coverage  of emergency  and  pregnancy-related  services, \nincreasing  their  reliance  on  other  safety-net  health  care  services  provided  by  the  County. \n46.  The  County  operates  the  Santa  Clara  Valley  Medical  Center  (“SCVMC’’),  a  public \nsafety-net  Level  I  trauma  hospital  that  provides  critical  health  care  services  to  poor  and  uninsured \nCounty  residents.  Payments  from  these  patients  and  from  public  insurance  programs  such  as  Medi- \nCal  do  not  cover  the  costs  of services  they  receive  at  SCVMC.  As  a  result,  each  year  the  County \n10 \nprovides  a  substantial  subsidy  to  SCVMC  to  cover  deficits  incurred  by  SCVMC  in  serving  these \n11 \npatients.  During  the  first  three  quarters  of Fiscal  Year  2017,  SCVMC  operated  at  a  deficit  of well \n12 \nover  $90  million.  Rescission  of the  DACA  program  will  negatively  affect  SCVMC.  Because \n13 \nDACA  recipients  who  are  now  employed  pursuant  to  work  authorization  granted  under  the  program \n14 \nwill  lose  their jobs  —  and  their  employer-sponsored  health  insurance  —  former  DACA  recipients,  and \n      \n15 \nfamily  members  who  were  covered  by  the  recipient’s  insurance,  are  more  likely  to  fall  back  on \n16 \nsafety-net  hospitals  like  SCVMC.  Additionally,  lacking  employer-sponsored  health  insurance, \n17 \nunable  to  access  full-scope  Medi-Cal,  and  burdened  with  a  fear  of detention  and  deportation,  these \n18 \nindividuals  are  less  likely  to  obtain  regular  check-ups  and  routine,  preventative  care.  As  a  result, \n19 \nthey  will  be  more  likely  to  seek  medical  care  only  when  health  problems  worsen  —  often  at \n20 \nSCVMC’s  Emergency  Department  —  at  which  point  care  becomes  more  difficult  and  more \n21 \nexpensive.  The  rescission  of DACA  will  increase  the  County’s  costs  in  subsidizing  free  and  below- \n22 \ncost  care  at  SCVMC. \n23 \n47.  In  addition  to  health  care,  the  County  provides  (and  is  often  required  to  provide) \n24 \nmany  other  services  to  community  members  regardless  of immigration  status,  and  it  will  become \n25 \nmore  difficult  to  provide  these  services  to  DACA  recipients  after  they  lose  deferred  action  status \n26 \nbecause  of their  renewed  hesitancy  to  interact  with  the  government  for  fear  of detention  and \n27 \ndeportation.  At  the  same  time,  it  will  be  even  more  critical  for  individuals  who  lose  DACA  status  to \n28 \naccess  County  services  —  and  the  County  will  need  to  spend  more  to  support  them  —  because  the \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n16 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  18  of  28 \nsame  individuals  will  be  losing  work  authorization  and,  thus,  the  ability  to  work  legally  to  support \nthemselves  and  their  families. \n48.  For  example,  the  County  invests  significant  resources  in  programs  to  provide  housing \nto  the  homeless  and  to  prevent  homelessness.  In  fiscal  year  (FY)  2015,  the  County  allocated  over \n$73.8  million  in  resources  to  housing  and  related  services  countywide  and,  in  2015,  the  Board  of \nSupervisors  approved  increasing  these  expenditures  by  a  total  of  $33.9  million  over  FY  2016-2018. \nIn  addition  to  providing  housing  to  homeless  individuals  and  families  who  utilize  other  County \nservices,  the  County  also  funds  homelessness  prevention  and  emergency  housing  programs, \nincluding  homeless  shelters,  a  cold  weather  shelter  program,  interim  housing  for  the  chronically \n10 \nhomeless,  and  24-hour  care  shelter placements.  Because  DACA  recipients  are  able  to  obtain  work \n11 \nauthorization  and  work  legally,  the  program  has  helped  recipients  support  themselves  and  their \n12 \nfamilies,  greatly  reducing  their  risk  of homelessness  and  reliance  on  County  services.  These  benefits \n13 \nare  lost  with  rescission  of the  DACA  program. \n14 \n49.  The  DACA  program  also  reduces  reliance  on  the  County’s  safety-net  services  by \n      \n15 \nkeeping  families  together.  Twenty-five  percent  of DACA  recipients  have  at  least  one  U.S.-born \n16 \nchild.  Dara  Lind,  9 facts  that  explain  DACA,  the  immigration program  Trump  is  threatening  to  end, \n17 \nVox.com  (Sept.  5,  2017),  available  at:  https://www.vox.com/policy-and- \n18 \npolitics/2017/8/3 1/16226934/daca-trump-dreamers-immigration  (last  visited  Oct.  9,  2017).  If these \n19 \nparents  lose  DACA  status  and  are  subject  to  deportation,  some  of their  U.S.  citizen  children  may \n20 \nenter  the  foster  care  system.  The  County  provides  financial  support  to  foster  parents  to  meet  the \n21 \nbasic  needs  of foster  youth  placed  in  their  care.  In  the  2017  fiscal  year,  the  County  invested  $25 \n22 \nmillion  in  foster  care  youth,  and  rescission  of the  DACA  program  could  bring  more  young  people \n23 \ninto  the  system,  increasing  costs  and  placing  greater  strains  on  County  resources. \n24 \n50.  Rescission  of DACA  would  also  hinder  the  County’s  ability  to  protect  the  public \n25 \nhealth  and  the  safety  of its  residents.  The  County’s  Public  Health  Department  (“PHD”)  runs \n26 \nnumerous  programs  that  protect  the  health  not  only  of the  individual  served,  but  of the  wider \n27 \ncommunity.  PHD  provides  immunization  clinics,  tuberculosis  testing,  STD  testing,  and  other \n28 \nservices  that  prevent  the  spread  of communicable  diseases.  DACA  has  improved  PHD’s  ability  to \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n17 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  19  of  28 \nprovide  these  critical  services  to  immigrant  communities  by  alleviating  the  fear  of deportation  that \noften  prevents  undocumented  immigrants  from  seeking  government  services.  If DACA  recipients \nlose  their  deferred  action  status,  they  —  and  their  U.S.  citizen  children  —  may  be  less  likely  to  receive \nnecessary  immunizations  and  testing,  thereby  increasing  health  risks  for  the  community  as  a  whole. \n51.  For  similar  reasons,  DACA  has  had  a  positive  effect  on  the  relationship  between \nimmigrant  communities  and  local  law  enforcement.  Because  of a justified  fear  of detention  and \ndeportation,  undocumented  individuals  are  often  hesitant  to  contact  law  enforcement  even  when  they \nare  victims  of crimes.  By  providing  an  assurance  that  they  are  protected  from  immigration \nenforcement  actions,  DACA  has  permitted  recipients  to  be  more  willing  to  report  crimes,  act  as \n10 \nwitnesses,  and  otherwise  cooperate  with  local  law  enforcement,  as  well  as  with  other  emergency \n11 \nservices  and  first  responders.  This  improved  relationship  is  invaluable  not just  to  DACA  recipients \n12 \nthemselves,  but  also  to  their  communities  and  the  County. \n13 \n52.  DACA  has  had  a  similar  effect  on  the  County’s  Code  Enforcement  Division,  which \n14 \nenforces  zoning  and  building  ordinances  to  ensure  safe  living  conditions  for  county  residents.  The \n      \n15 \nCounty  has  received  reports  that  some  tenants  are  reluctant  to  come  forward  with  reports  of code \n16 \nviolations  because  landlords  have  threatened  to  report  immigrants  to  ICE.  DACA  status \n17 \nsubstantially  reduces  that  threat,  thereby  helping  the  County  ensure  that  unsafe  or  unsanitary  housing \n18 \nconditions  are  abated  for  the  safety  and  benefit  of the  entire  community. \n19 \n53.  DACA’s  benefits  to  the  County  are  also  evidenced  by  the  County’s  willingness  to \n20 \ninvest  in  DACA  recipients.  For  example,  the  County  previously  allocated  $200,000  for  outreach  and \n21 \neducation  concerning  the  DACA  program,  to  ensure  that  eligible  County  residents  know  of and  have \n22 \nsupport  necessary  to  apply  for  DACA  status.  Just  after  the  administration’s  announcement  that \n23 \nDACA  would  be  rescinded,  the  County  allocated  an  additional  $200,000  from  its  emergency  reserve \n24 \nto  establish  an  emergency  program  to  help  DACA  recipients  submit  renewal  applications  before  the \n25 \nadministration’s  arbitrary  October  5,  2017  deadline.  Additionally,  the  County  has  allocated \n26 \n$400,000  to  the  New  Americans  Fellowship  Program,  described  above. \n27 \n54.  In  light  of the  many  ways  in  which  the  County  has  benefited  from  the  DACA \n28 \nprogram,  on  August  15,  2017,  the  County’s  Board  of Supervisors  unanimously  adopted  a  resolution \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n18 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  20  of  28 \naffirming  its  support  for  the  DACA  program  and  its  commitment  to  immigrant  youth  and  young \nadults. \nRescission  of the  DACA  Program \n55.  The  administration’s  decision  to  rescind  the  DACA  program  was  announced  by \nAttorney  General  Jefferson  Sessions  at  a  press  conference  on  September  5,  2017.  In  his  statement, \nAttorney  General  Sessions  made  a  number  of factual  assertions  concerning  the  DACA  program  that \nare  demonstrably  false,  including  the  statement  that  DACA  had  “denied jobs  to  hundreds  of \nthousands  of Americans”  and  that  DACA  “contributed  to  a  surge  of unaccompanied  minors  on  the \nsouthern  border  that  yielded  terrible  humanitarian  consequences.”  Notably,  the  Attorney  General \n10 \nprovided  no  evidence  to  support  these  assertions  and  gave  no  indication  that  the  administration  had \n11 \nstudied  DACA  or  its  effects  in  any  meaningful  or  systematic  fashion.  Rather,  he  simply  assumed \n12 \nthat  DACA  had  negative  effects,  completely  ignored  the  program’s  positive  effects,  and  concluded \n13 \nthat  “[o]Jur  collective  wisdom  is  that  the  policy  is  vulnerable  to  the  same  legal  and  constitutional \n14 \nchallenges  that  the  courts  recognized  with  respect  to  the  [Deferred  Action  for  Parents  of Americans \n      \n15 \nand  Lawful  Permanent  Residents]  program.” \n16 \n56.  Shortly  after  the  press  conference,  Acting  Secretary  Duke  issued  a  memorandum \n17 \nformally  rescinding  DACA.  The  memorandum  stated  that  DHS  would  not  consider  any  initial \n18 \nDACA  applications  received  after  September  5,  2017.  As  for  individuals  who  currently  have  DACA \n19 \nstatus  and  work  authorization,  the  memorandum  stated  that  DHS  would  adjudicate  pending  renewal \n20 \nrequests  properly  filed  and  accepted  by  DHS  as  of  September  5,  2017,  and  renewal  requests  properly \n21 \nfiled  and  accepted  by  DHS  by  October  5,  2017  from  individuals  whose  DACA  benefits  expire \n22 \nbetween  September  5,  2017  and  March  5,  2018.  All  other  DACA  renewal  requests,  including  any \n23 \nrequests  received  after  October  5,  2017,  would  be  rejected. \n24 \n57.  Acting  Secretary  Duke’s  memorandum  did  not  explain  the  administration’s  reasons \n25 \nfor  rescinding  DACA  and  gave  no  indication  that  the  administration  had  considered  the  benefits  of \n26 \nthe  program  before  abruptly  ending  it.  Rather,  the  memorandum  simply  refers  to  the  Attorney \n27 \nGeneral’s  speculation  that  the  DACA  program  may  be  held  unlawful,  explaining  that  the  Fifth \n28 \nCircuit  had  held  different  programs  (Deferred  Action  for  the  Parents  of Americans  and  Lawful \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n19 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  21  of  28 \nPermanent  Residents  (““DAPA”)  and  an  expansion  of the  DACA)  to  be  unlawful,  and  that  this \ndecision  was  affirmed  by  an  equally  divided  Supreme  Court.  Secretary  Duke’s  memorandum  cites  a \nSeptember  4,  2017  letter  from  Attorney  General  Sessions,  which  provides  no  legal  analysis \nwhatsoever  and  simply  concludes  that  “it  is  likely  that  potentially  imminent  litigation  would  yield \nsimilar  results  with  respect  to  DACA.” \n58.  On  the  same  day  that  Attorney  General  Sessions  announced  the  rescission  of DACA, \nDHS  published  guidance  in  the  form  of  “frequently  asked  questions”  (“FAQs”)  concerning  the \nrescission  of DACA.  These  FAQs  reflect  a  changed  orientation  toward  the  use  of DACA  applicants’ \ninformation  for  immigration  enforcement.  Previously,  applicants  had  been  told  that  “Information \n10 \nprovided  in  [a  DACA]  request  is  protected  from  disclosure  to  ICE  and  CBP  [U.S.  Customs  and \n11 \nBorder  Protection]  for  the  purpose  of immigration  enforcement  proceedings  unless  the  requestor \n12 \nmeets  the  criteria  for  the  issuance  of a  Notice  to  Appear  or  a  referral  to  ICE  under  the  criteria  set \n13 \nforth  in  USCIS’  Notice  to  Appear  guidance...  .”.  USCIS,  DACA  Frequently  Asked  Questions, \n14 \navailable  at:  https://www.uscis.gov/archive/frequently-asked-questions  (last  visited  Oct.  9,  2017). \n      \n15 \nBy  contrast,  the  September  5,  2017  guidance  provides:  “Information  provided  to  USCIS  in  DACA \n16 \nrequests  will  not  be proactively provided to  ICE  and  CBP  for  the  purpose  of immigration \n17 \nenforcement  proceedings,  unless  the  requestor  meets  the  criteria  for  the  issuance  of a  Notice  to \n18 \nAppear  or  a  referral  to  ICE  under  the  criteria  set  forth  in  USCIS’  Notice  to  Appear  guidance...  .” \n19 \nDHS,  Frequently  Asked  Questions:  Rescission  of Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals  (Sept.  5, \n20 \n2017)  (emphasis  added),  available  at:  https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/frequently-asked- \n21 \nquestions-rescission-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca  (last  visited  Oct.  9,  2017).  This  change \n22 \nappears  to  indicate  that  information  provided  by  DACA  applicants  will  be  used  for  immigration \n23 \nenforcement  purposes,  and  made  available  to  ICE  and  CBP  upon  request,  even  if not  “proactively \n24 \nprovided.” \nFIRST  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n25 \nViolation  of Due  Process \n26  U.S.  Const.  amend.  V \n27  59.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  all  the  allegations  set  forth  in  this \nComplaint. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n20 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  22  of  28 \n60.  The  County  has  a  constitutionally  protected  interest  in  its  employment  relationships \nwith  its  employees,  including  DACA  recipients,  as  well  as  protected  interests  in  the  benefits  that \nflow  from  those  relationships.  The  County  employs  DACA  recipients  as  full-time  and  part-time \nemployees,  and  as  fellows  in  the  County’s  New  Americans  Fellowship  Program.  The  County  has \nmade  significant  investments  of employee-time  and  money  to  hire  and  train  those  employees.  The \nrescission  of the  DACA  program,  and  DACA  recipients’  consequent  inability  to  apply  for renewed \nwork  authorization,  will  necessarily  result  in  the  termination  of those  employment  relationships. \nThe  County  will  therefore  lose  not  only  its  investment  in  these  employees,  but  also  the  benefit  of \ntheir  expertise  and  experience. \n10 \n61.  County  employees  and  others  who  participate  in  the  DACA  program,  including  Local \n11 \n521  members,  have  a  constitutionally  protected  interest  in  their jobs.  As  a  result  of the  rescission, \n12 \nwhen  their  current  two-year  authorization  expires,  employees  who  participate  in  the  DACA  program \n13 \nwill  no  longer  be  able  to  keep  their jobs  with  the  County  or  with  other  employers. \n14 \n62.  The  County  has  a  constitutionally  protected  interest  in  the  programs  and  services  it \n      \n15 \noffers  to  County  residents,  including  the  funds  expended  to  support  those  programs.  It  will  become \n16 \nmore  difficult  to  provide  these  services  to  DACA  recipients  after  they  lose  deferred  action  status \n17 \nbecause  of their  renewed  hesitancy  to  interact  with  the  government  for  fear  of detention  and \n18 \ndeportation.  At  the  same  time,  it  will  be  even  more  critical  for  individuals  who  lose  DACA  status  to \n19 \naccess  County  services  —  and  the  County  will  need  to  spend  more  to  support  them  —  because  the \n20 \nsame  individuals  will  be  losing  work  authorization  and,  thus,  the  ability  to  work  legally  to  support \n21 \nthemselves  and  their  families. \n22 \n63.  Rescission  of the  DACA  program  and  Defendants’  actions  in  accordance  therewith \n23 \nunlawfully  deprive  the  County,  its  employees  and  its  residents  of these  and  other  constitutionally \n24 \nprotected  interests  without  due  process  of law.  Such  deprivation  occurred  with  no  notice  or \n25 \nopportunity  to  be  heard. \n26 \n64.  Moreover,  to  the  extent  that  Defendants  seek  to  use  for  purposes  of immigration \n27 \nenforcement  the  information  that  DACA  recipients  provided  in  connection  with  their  applications, \n28 \nsuch  use  would  also  violate  due  process.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of the  Fifth  Amendment  requires \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n21 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  23  of  28 \nthat  the  federal  government’s  immigration  enforcement  actions  be  fundamentally  fair.  Defendants \ninduced  DACA  applicants  to  provide  this  information  with  the  express  promise  that  it  would  not  be \nused  against  the  applicant  in  immigration  enforcement  proceedings.  For  Defendants  to  turn  around \nand  now  use  this  information  as  they  previously  promised  they  would  not,  would  abuse  DACA \napplicants’  trust  in  government  and  offend  fundamental  principles  of fairness  and justice. \n65.  Rescission  of the  DACA  program  violated  the  Due  Process  Clause  of the  Fifth \nAmendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  Likewise,  use  of the  information  DACA  recipients \nprovided  to  Defendants  as  part  of their  DACA  applications  to  target  DACA  recipients  or  their \nfamilies  for removal  or  to  support  removal  proceedings  would  violate  the  Due  Process  Clause  of the \n10 \nFifth  Amendment. \n11 \n66.  The  County,  its  employees  and  its  residents,  and  Local  521  and  its  members  have \n12 \nbeen  harmed  and  continue  to  be  harmed  by  these  unlawful  acts. \n13 \nSECOND  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n14  Violation  of Administrative  Procedure  Act \n     Arbitrary  and  Capricious  Agency  Action   \n15  5  U.S.C.  §706 \n16  67.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  all  the  allegations  set  forth  in  this \n17  Complaint. \n18  68.  The  Department  of Homeland  Security  is  subject  to  the  requirements  of the  APA. \n19  See  5  U.S.C.  §703.  The  termination  of the  DACA  program  is  final  agency  action  subject  to judicial \n20  review  because  it  marks  the  “consummation  of the  .  .  .  decisionmaking  process”  and  is  one  “from \n21  which  legal  consequences  will  flow.”  Bennett  v.  Spear,  520  U.S.  154,  178  (1997)  (internal  quotation \n22  marks  omitted). \n23  69.  Under  5  U.S.C.  §706(2),  courts  shall  “hold  unlawful  and  set  aside”  agency  action \n24  found  to  be  arbitrary,  capricious,  and  abuse  of discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law; \n25  contrary  to  a  constitutional  right,  power,  privilege,  or  immunity;  in  excess  of  statutory jurisdiction, \n26  authority,  or  limitations,  or  short  of  statutory  right;  without  observance  of procedure  required  by  law. \n27  70.  Rescission  of the  DACA  program  is  final  agency  action  subject  to  APA  review  by \n28  this  Court. \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n22 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  24  of  28 \n71.  Defendants’  actions  rescinding  DACA  are  arbitrary  and  capricious,  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion,  and  not  in  accordance  with  law  because,  among  other  things,  Defendants  have  not \nidentified  a  reasonable  explanation  for  their  decision  to  do  so.  Nor  in  rescinding  the  DACA  program \ndid  Defendants  consider  all  relevant  factors,  including  the  benefits  provided  by  the  program.  Not \nonly  have  Defendants  failed  to  meaningfully  assess  the  benefits  of the  DACA  program,  but  they \nhave  not  addressed  the  comprehensive  legal  arguments  previously  developed  by  DHS  itself and  the \nDepartment  of Justice’s  Office  of Legal  Counsel  as  to  why  the  DACA  program  is  a  lawful  exercise \nof prosecutorial  discretion.  The  failure  to  address  these  legal  opinions,  or  offer  any  legal  reasoning, \nis  especially  egregious  in  this  case,  given  that  the  only  rationale  for  rescinding  DACA  offered  in \n10 \nDefendant  Duke’s  September  5  memorandum  is  that  the  program  is  likely  to  be  found  unlawful. \n11 \nDefendants  have  committed  a  clear  error  in judgment. \n12 \n72.  Defendants  also  disregarded  the  serious  reliance  interests  created  by  the  DACA \n13 \nprogram,  including  those  of the  County  and  DACA  recipients.  On  the  basis  of Defendants’ \n14 \nrepresentations  that  the  DACA  program  would  provide  them  an  avenue  to  come  out  of the  shadows \n      \n15 \nand  participate  more  fully  in  their  communities,  and  that  the  information  they  provided  to \n16 \nDefendants  would  not  be  used  against  them  in  immigration  proceedings,  DACA  recipients  applied \n17 \nfor  deferred  action  status  and  organized  their  lives  around  the  expectation  that  they  would  be \n18 \npermitted  to  maintain  that  status  as  long  as  they  were  in  compliance  with  program  requirements. \n19 \nWhere  “longstanding  policies  may  have  ‘engendered  serious  reliance  interests,’” 999  those  interests \n20 \n“must  be  taken  into  account.”  Encino  Motorcars,  LLC  v.  Navarro,  136  S.  Ct.  2117,  2126  (2016) \n21 \n(quoting  FCC  v.  Fox  Tele.  Stations,  Inc.,  556  U.S.  502,  515  (2009)).  “[A]  reasoned  explanation  is \n22 \nneeded  for  disregarding  facts  and  circumstances  that  underlay  or  were  engendered  by  the  prior \n23 \npolicy,”  id.  (quoting  Fox,  556  U.S.  at  516),  and  “[i]t  follows  that  an  ‘[u]nexplained  inconsistency’  in \n24 \nagency  policy  is  ‘a  reason  for  holding  an  interpretation  to  be  an  arbitrary  and  capricious  change  from \n25 \nagency  practice.”  /d.  (quoting  Nat’!  Cable  &  Telecomm.  Ass’n  v.  Brand X Internet  Servs.,  545  U.S. \n26 \n967,  981  (2005)). \n27 \n73.  The  County,  its  employees,  and  its  residents,  and  Local  521  and  its  members  have \n28 \nbeen  harmed  and  continue  to  be  harmed  by  these  unlawful  acts. \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n23 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  25  of  28 \nTHIRD  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \nViolation  of Equal  Protection \nU.S.  Const.  amend.  V \n74.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  all  of the  allegations  set  forth  in  this \nComplaint. \n75.  Defendants’  actions  rescinding  DACA  target  Latinos  and,  specifically,  immigrants \nfrom  Mexico,  and  are  motivated  by  animus  toward  these  groups.  Of the  approximately  1.59  million \nDACA  applications  (both  initial  and  renewal)  that  were  approved  from  the  beginning  of the  program \nthrough  March  2017,  approximately  1.48  million,  or  approximately  93%,  were  submitted  by  people \nfrom  countries  in  Latin  America  and  approximately,  1.24  million,  or  approximately  80%,  were  from \n10 \nMexican  immigrants.  Accordingly,  the  overwhelming  majority  of the  direct  beneficiaries  of the \n11 \nDACA  program  have  been  Latinos  and  Mexican  immigrants.  There  is  no  question  but  that \n12 \nrescission  of the  DACA  program  imposes  a  disproportionate  burden  on  Latinos  generally  and, \n13 \nspecifically,  persons  from  Mexico. \n14 \n76.  The  rescission  is  motivated  by  impermissible  animus.  From  the  moment  he  launched \n      \n15 \nhis  campaign,  President  Trump  has  publicly  announced  his  animus  toward  Latinos  and  Mexican \n16 \nimmigrants.  Indeed,  such  animus  was  a  feature  of his  campaign,  in  which  President  Trump \n17 \ndistinguished  himself with  his  hardline  stance  on  immigration,  highlighted  by  harsh  rhetoric \n18 \ndisparaging  Mexican  immigrants.  In  the  speech  in  which  he  announced  his  candidacy,  President \n19 \nTrump  stated:  “When  Mexico  sends  its  people,  they’re  not  sending  their  best...  .  They’re  sending \n20 \npeople  that  have  lots  of problems,  and  they’re  bring  those  problems  with  us  [sic].  They’re  bringing \n21 \ndrugs.  They’re  bringing  crime.  They’re  rapists.”  As  an  afterthought,  he  added,  “[a]nd  some,  I \n22 \nassume,  are  good  people.”  Later,  then-candidate  Trump  repeatedly  disparaged  the  federal  district \n23 \njudge  presiding  over  a  case  brought  by  students  alleging  they  were  defrauded  by  Trump  University, \n24 \ncalling  the judge  a  “hater”  who  is  “very  hostile”  to  President  Trump  because,  as  the  President  has \n25 \nexplained  on  different  occasions,  he  “happens  to  be  Spanish,”  is  “Hispanic,”  or  “happens  to  be,  we \n26 \nbelieve,  Mexican.”  More  recently,  in  August  2017,  at  a  rally  in  Phoenix,  President  Trump  referred \n27 \nto  undocumented  immigrants  as  “animals”  who  are  responsible  for  “the  drugs,  the  gangs,  the  cartels, \n28 \nthe  crisis  of smuggling  and  trafficking.”  Throughout  his  campaign  and  in  his  first  months  in  office, \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n24 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  26  of  28 \nthe  President  has  maintained  this  attitude,  culminating  in  the  decision  to  rescind  the  DACA  program. \n77.  Moreover,  other  factors  indicative  of an  intent  to  discriminate  are  present  in  this  case. \nIn  rescinding  the  DACA  program,  Defendants  departed  significantly  from  normal  procedures.  In \nparticular,  Defendants  elected  to  entirely  forego  the  APA  procedures  required  for  implementation  of \na  categorical  rule  such  as  the  rescission  of DACA.  Additionally,  the  purported justifications  offered \nfor  the  rescission  are  plainly  pretextual.  The  September  5,  2017  memorandum  from  Defendant \nSecretary  Duke  announcing  the  rescission  explains  only  that  the  Fifth  Circuit  had  held  the  different \nDAPA  program  and  an  expansion  of DACA  to  be  unlawful,  and  that  this  decision  was  affirmed  by \nan  equally  divided  Supreme  Court.  Secretary  Duke’s  memorandum  cites  a  September  4,  2017  letter \n10 \nfrom  Attorney  General  Sessions,  which  provides  no  legal  analysis  whatsoever  and  simply  concludes \n11 \nthat  “it  is  likely  that  potentially  imminent  litigation  would  yield  similar  results  with  respect  to \n12 \nDACA.”  No  court  has  considered  the  lawfulness  of the  DACA  program  at  issue  here. \n13 \n78.  As  such,  the  rescission  of DACA  deprives  Latino  DACA  recipients  of equal \n14 \nprotection  of the  laws,  guaranteed  by  the  Fifth  Amendment.  The  County,  Local  521,  and  its \n      \n15 \nmembers  are  harmed  and  continue  to  be  harmed  by  Defendants’  actions. \n16 \nFOURTH  CLAIM  FOR  RELIEF \n17  Declaratory  Relief —  Equitable  Estoppel \n18 \n79.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  all  of the  allegations  set  forth  in  this \n19 \nComplaint. \n20 \n80.  The  federal  government,  by  its  conduct  and  explicit  statements,  represented  to \n21 \neligible  applicants  that  the  information  applicants  provided  in  connection  with  applications  for \n22 \ndeferred  action  status  would  not  be  used  in  immigration  enforcement  proceedings,  except  in  certain \n23 \nlimited  circumstances,  and  that  DACA  recipients  would  have  the  opportunity  to  apply  for  renewed \n24 \ndeferred  action  status  at  the  end  of their  respective  two-year  authorization  periods. \n25 \n81.  In  reliance  on  these  assurances,  DACA  applicants  identified  themselves  to  the \n26 \ngovernment,  acknowledging  their  undocumented  status,  and  provided  important  information  about \n27 \nthemselves  and  their  family  members  that  exposed  them  to  the  risk  of deportation. \n28 \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n25 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  27  of  28 \n82.  From  the  initial  implementation  of DACA  to  the  announcement  rescinding  the \nprogram,  the  government  continuously  made  representations  about  the  validity  and  legality  of the \nprogram,  the  use  of information  provided  by  applicants,  and  the  continuing  opportunity  to  apply  for \nrenewal  of deferred  action  status. \n83.  DACA  recipients  rearranged  their  lives,  daring  to  become  more  visible  and  more \nintegrated  into  the  fabric  of their  communities,  including  by  seeking  employment,  pursuing  higher \neducation,  and  paying  taxes.  But  now  they  are  at  a  heightened  risk  of removal  and  deportation \nbecause  of their  reliance  on  the  government’s  prior  statements. \n84.  Therefore,  Defendants  should  be  equitably  estopped  from  terminating  the  DACA \n10 \nprogram  and  from  using  information  provided  pursuant  to  DACA  for  immigration  enforcement \n11 \npurposes,  except  as  previously  authorized  under  DACA. \n12 \n85.  An  actual  controversy  between  Plaintiffs  and  Defendants  exists  as  to  whether \n13 \nDefendants  should  be  equitably  estopped. \n14 \n86.  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  Defendants  are  equitably  estopped. \n      \n15 \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \n16 \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  that  the  Court  grant  the  following  relief: \n17 \nA.  Vacate  and  set  aside  the  rescission  of the  DACA  program  and  any  other  action  taken \n18 \nby  Defendants  in  furtherance  of the  rescission; \n19 \nB.  Declare  that  the  rescission  of DACA  and  Defendants’  actions  in  connection  therewith \n20 \nare  void  and  without  legal  force  or  effect; \n21 \nC.

Declare  that  the  rescission  of DACA  and  Defendants’  action  in  connection  therewith \n25 \nviolate  the  Constitution  and  laws  of the  United  States; \n26 \nE.  Declare  that  Defendants  are  equitably  estopped  from  terminating  the  DACA  program \n27 \nor  from  using  information  provided  pursuant  to  DACA  for  immigration  enforcement  purposes, \n28 \nexcept  as  previously  authorized  under  the  program; \nCOMPLAINT  FOR DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n26 \nCase  5:17-cv-05813  Document1  Filed  10/10/17  Page  28  of  28 \nF,  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoin  and  restrain  Defendants,  their  agents,  servants, \nemployees,  attorneys,  and  all  persons  in  active  concert  or participation  with  any  of them,  from \nimplementing  or  enforcing  the  rescission  of DACA  and  from  taking  any  other  action  that  is  not  in \ncompliance  with  applicable  law; \nG.

Federal defendants oppose.  For the reasons herein, plaintiffs’ motion is\n22\nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n23\nSTATEMENT\n24\nOn June 15, 2012, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security issued a\n25\nmemorandum promulgating a deferred action policy for those without lawful immigration status\n26\nwho came to the United States as children, were continuous residents in the United States for at\n27\nleast five years, had graduated from high school, obtained a GED, or served in the military, and\n28\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 2 of 14\n1 met certain other criteria — a memorandum and policy known as Deferred Action for\n2 Childhood Arrivals, “DACA” for short (Dkt. No. 64-1 at 1–3).1\n3 After the change in administrations in 2017, the new Secretary of DHS, John Kelly,\n4 announced that DACA would be continued notwithstanding the rescission of other immigration\n5 policies (id. at 230).  This was done despite, and with the knowledge of, the decision of the\n6 Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015),\n7 invalidating a different deferred action policy and the Supreme Court’s affirmance of that\n8 decision by an equally divided vote, United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per\n9 curiam).\n10 On September 5, 2017, however, the Acting Secretary of DHS, Elaine Duke, reversed\nt 11 the agency’s position and announced DACA’s end, effective March 5, 2018. \nr\nu\no a 12 We now have five lawsuits in this district challenging that rescission.2  Each action is\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 proceeding on a parallel track and on the same schedule, which schedule was designed to reach\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 a decision on the merits and to allow appellate review by the March 5 deadline.3    \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Pursuant to the scheduling order, the federal defendants filed the administrative record\nS N 16 on October 6.  It consisted of fourteen documents spanning 256 pages, each of which was\nted  For the  17 already available to the public, and had, in fact, already been filed in this action (Dkt. No. 49\ni\nn\nU\n18 ¶ 3; Dkt. No. 64-1).\n19 In unison, plaintiffs now move to require completion of the administrative record in\n20 accordance with Section 706 of Title 5 of the United States Code.  They argue that the current\n21 record is incomplete because it contains only documents personally considered by the Acting\n22 Secretary (and then only some considered by her) and excludes any and all other documents that\n23 indirectly led to the rescission. \n24\n25 1    All docket numbers herein refer to the docket in Case No. C 17-05211 WHA.\n26\n2   There are two additional DACA lawsuits proceeding in the Eastern District of New York before\nJudge Nicholas Garaufis, State of New York v. Trump, Case No. 17-cv-05228 NGG, and Vidal v. Baran, Case\n27\nNo. 16-cv-04756 NGG.\n28\n3  The fifth lawsuit,  County of Santa Clara v. Trump, Case No. 17-cv-05813 HRL, was related after\nplaintiffs’ motion was fully briefed and argued.\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 3 of 14\n1 The federal defendants oppose, arguing that they have already filed a complete\n2 administrative record, which they contend is properly limited to unprivileged documents\n3 actually considered by the “decision-maker,” here, the Acting Secretary (Opp. at 8–9).  \n4 This order follows full briefing and oral argument and the Court’s review of all\n5 materials in camera that appeared on the government’s privilege log.\n6 ANALYSIS\n7 1. SCOPE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD.\n8 Section 706 of the APA provides that judicial review of agency action shall be based\n9 on “the whole record.”  The administrative record “is not necessarily those documents that the\n10 agency has compiled and submitted as the administrative record” but rather “consists of all\nt 11 documents and materials directly or indirectly considered by agency decision-makers and\nr\nu\no a 12 includes evidence contrary to the agency’s position.”  Thompson v. United States Dep’t of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Labor, 885 F.2d 551, 555–56 (9th Cir. 1989).  This includes not only documents that “literally\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 pass[ed] before the eyes of the final agency decision maker” but also documents that were\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 considered and relied upon by subordinates who provided recommendations to the decision-\nS N 16 maker.  People of State of Cal. ex rel. Lockyer v. United States Dep’t of Agriculture, Nos.\nted  For the  17 C05-3508 & C05-4038, 2006 WL 708914, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2006) (Magistrate Judge\ni\nn\nU\n18 Elizabeth Laporte) (internal citations and quotations omitted); see also Amfac Resorts, L.L.C. v.\n19 United States Dep’t of the Interior, 143 F. Supp. 2d 7, 12 (D.D.C. 2001) (Judge Royce\n20 Lamberth).\n21 The requirement that a reviewing court consider “the whole record” before rendering a\n22 decision “ensures that neither party is withholding evidence unfavorable to its position and that\n23 the agencies are not taking advantage of post hoc rationalizations for administrative decisions. \n24 Walter O. Boswell Mem’l Hosp. v. Heckler, 749 F.2d 788, 792 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\n25 While it is presumed that the administrative record submitted by defendants is complete,\n26 plaintiffs can rebut this presumption with “clear evidence to the contrary.”  Cook Inletkeeper v.\n27 EPA, 400 F. App’x 239, 240 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F.2d 735,\n28 740 (10th Cir. 1993)). \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 4 of 14\n1 Defendants contend a showing of bad faith or impropriety is required in order to compel\n2 a complete production of the administrative record.  This is incorrect.  True, bad faith is one\n3 basis for requiring supplementation of an administrative record, but it is not the exclusive basis. \n4 Our court of appeals has repeatedly recognized other grounds for requiring supplementation,\n5 including where it appears the “agency relied on documents not [already] included in the\n6 record.”  Pub. Power Council v. Johnson, 674 F.2d 791, 794 (9th Cir. 1982); Fence Creek\n7 Cattle Co. v. United States Forest Serv., 602 F.3d 1125, 1131 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Lands\n8 Council v. Powell, 395 F.3d 1019, 1030 (9th Cir. 2005).  \n9 The “bad faith” standard of Overton Park applies where, though an administrative\n10 record exists, plaintiffs ask to go beyond the record that was before the agency and inquire into\nt 11 the thought processes of decision-makers —  in Overton Park, by taking the testimony of\nr\nu\no a 12 agency officials.  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971)\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Our plaintiffs are not seeking materials beyond what were already considered, directly\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 or indirectly, by the decision-maker, and therefore need not show bad faith.  Supplementation\nS N 16 is appropriate if they show, by clear evidence, that the agency relied on materials not already\nted  For the  17 included in the record.  See Portland Audubon Soc. v. Endangered Species Comm., 984 F.2d\ni\nn\nU\n18 1534, 1548 (9th Cir. 1993) (distinguishing between materials “never presented to the agency”\n19 and materials that were “allegedly [] before the agency”); Fence Creek Cattle Co., 602 F.3d at\n20 1131.  \n21 Nor is defendants’ contention that it need only produce documents directly considered\n22 by the Acting Secretary correct.  Documents reviewed by subordinates, or other agencies\n23 who informed her on the issues underlying the decision to rescind DACA, either verbally or\n24 in writing, should be in the administrative record.  See Lockyer, 2006 WL 708914, at *2. \n25 The threshold question is whether plaintiffs have shown, by clear evidence, that the record\n26\n27\n28\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 5 of 14\n1 defendants produced is missing documents that were considered, directly or indirectly, by DHS\n2 in deciding to rescind DACA.4 \n3 2. PLAINTIFFS’ SHOWING OF INCOMPLETENESS.\n4 Here, the tendered administrative record consists merely of fourteen documents\n5 spanning 258 pages, which defendants contend constitute the entire record considered in\n6 making the decision to rescind DACA.  These are plainly pertinent materials, although all were\n7 publicly known and already part of the pleadings herein.   \n8 Plaintiffs seek additional materials including emails, departmental memoranda, policy\n9 directives, meeting minutes, materials considered by Secretary Duke’s subordinates,\n10 communications from White House officials or staff, communications from the Department of\nt 11 Justice, and communications between DHS and state authorities, which they contend should\nr\nu\no a 12 necessarily be part of the administrative record (Br. at 9–10).  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs drew this list, in part, from a United States Department of Justice Guidance,\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 which sets forth non-binding recommendations for how to compile an administrative record and\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 what to include.  United States Dep’t of Justice, Env’t and Nat. Res. Div., Guidance to Federal\nS N 16 Agencies on Compiling the Administrative Record (Jan. 1999).  Specifically, the Guidance\nted  For the  17 states that the administrative record should “[i]nclude all documents and materials prepared,\ni\nn\nU\n18 reviewed, or received by agency personnel and used by or available to the decision-maker,\n19 even though the final decision-maker did not actually review or know about the documents\n20 and materials.”  Id. at 3.  It further provides that the record should include “communications\n21 the agency received from other agencies . . . documents and materials that support or oppose\n22 the challenged agency decision . . . minutes of meetings or transcripts thereof . . . [and]\n23\n24\n25\n4   Defendants also argue that they should not be required to produce any administrative record\nwhatsoever because the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to end DACA was an exercise of\n26\nprosecutorial discretion not subject to judicial review (Opp. at 1).  Earlier in these actions, our defendants\nagreed to produce the administrative record by October 6, and were then ordered to do so.  They may not now\n27\nrenege on that commitment.  At this stage, defendants are required to produce an administrative record.  Should\nthey prevail on this argument on their eventual motion to dismiss, it will be with the benefit of a proper\n28\nadministrative record.  \n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 6 of 14\n1 memorializations of telephone conversations and meetings, such as memorandum or\n2 handwritten notes.”5  \n3 Plaintiffs contend that communications from DOJ and the White House are a critical\n4 part of “the whole record” due to their significant public participation in the process of\n5 rescinding DACA.  Plaintiffs first point to Attorney General Sessions’ September 4 letter,\n6 which DHS expressly relied upon in its memorandum terminating the program (see Dkt. No.\n7 64-1 at 251, 255).  Despite this critical and publicly disclosed role in the decision, the only DOJ\n8 document defendants include in the record is this one-page September 4 letter.  This, plaintiffs\n9 contend, is clear evidence that defendants omitted documents supporting (or contradicting) the\n10 opinions set forth in Attorney General Sessions’ letter, in particular the opinion that DACA was\nt 11 unlawfully implemented.    \nr\nu\no a 12 Additionally, the White House has repeatedly emphasized the President’s direct role\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 in decisions concerning DACA.  For example, a September 5 White House press release\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 announced “President Donald J. Trump Restores Responsibility and the Rule of Law to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Immigration” by rescinding DACA, and repeatedly stated that “President Trump” had acted to\nS N 16 end the program.   Press Release, The White House Office of the Press Secretary, President\nted  For the  17 Donald J. Trump Restores Responsibility and the Rule of Law to Immigration (Sept. 5, 2017),\ni\nn\nU\n18 https://www.whitehouse.gov/thepress-office/2017/09/05/president-donald-j-trump-restores-\n19 responsibility-and-rule-law.  Other articles likewise emphasize White House officials’ roles\n20 in decision-making regarding DACA.  See, e.g., Michael D. Shear & Julie Hirschfeld Davis,\n21 Trump Moves to End DACA and Calls on Congress to Act, New York Times (Sept. 5, 2017). \n22 Moreover, defendants concede in their response that Secretary Duke “received advice from\n23 other members of the executive branch” in making her decision (Opp. at 17) and refer to “White\n24 House memorandum” in their privilege log (Dkt. No. 71-2).  And at oral argument, counsel for\n25\n5  A 2008 DOJ memorandum specifically notes that the 1999 Guidance is a non-binding internal\n26\ndocument, which does not “limit the otherwise lawful prerogatives of the Department of Justice or any other\nfederal agency” (Dkt. No. 71-1 at 3).  In particular, the 2008 memorandum takes issue with outside parties’ use\n27\nof the Guidance in litigation to advocate for a particular composition of the administrative record or process for\nits assembly (ibid.).  Recognizing that the 1999 Guidance is not binding upon agencies, this order finds that the\n28\nGuidance nevertheless provides helpful insight into the types of documents and materials an agency should\nconsider when assembling an administrative record.   \n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 7 of 14\n1 defendants said it was likely Secretary Duke had received verbal input before making her\n2 decision.  Despite this, defendants have failed to provide even a single document from any\n3 White House officials or staff. \n4 Plaintiffs further observe that not a single document from one of Secretary Dukes’\n5 subordinates is in the record.  It strains credulity to suggest that the Acting Secretary of DHS\n6 decided to rescind a program covering 800,000 enrollees without consulting one advisor or\n7 subordinate within DHS.  Again, at oral argument, government counsel represented that she\n8 had likely received verbal input.  The government’s in camera submission confirms that she\n9 did receive substantial DACA input.      \n10 Finally, former DHS Secretary John Kelly issued a memorandum in February 2017,\nt 11 in which he rescinded all DHS memoranda that conflicted with newly stated immigration\nr\nu\no a 12 enforcement policies — but expressly declined to rescind DACA  (Dkt. No. 64-1 at 229–30). \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 This decision, of course, is directly contrary to that taken by Acting Secretary Duke seven\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 months later.  The administrative record, however, omits all materials explaining the change\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 in position from February to September, with two exceptions — (1) a June 29 letter from Ken\nS N 16 Paxton, the Attorney General of Texas, to Attorney General Sessions, in which he threatens\nted  For the  17 to amend the suit challenging DAPA to also challenge DACA if it is not rescinded by\ni\nn\nU\n18 September 5, and (2) Attorney General Sessions’ September 4 letter to Secretary Duke\n19 expressing the opinion that DHS should rescind DACA.  Reasoned agency decision-making\n20 ordinarily “demand[s] that [the agency] display awareness that it is changing position” and\n21 “show that there are good reasons for the new policy.”  F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,\n22 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  Accordingly, “the whole record” would ordinarily contain materials\n23 giving a “reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding the facts and circumstances that underlay or\n24 were engendered by the prior policy.”  Ibid.  It is simply not plausible that DHS reversed policy\n25 between February and September because of one threatened lawsuit (never actually filed)\n26 without having generated any materials analyzing the lawsuit or other factors militating in favor\n27 of and against the switch in policy.         \n28\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 8 of 14\n1 Based on the foregoing, plaintiffs have clearly shown that defendants excluded highly\n2 relevant materials from the administrative record and in doing so have rebutted the presumption\n3 that the record is complete.\n4 Defendants’ argument to the contrary is unpersuasive.  Their position that only selected\n5 documents that Acting Secretary Duke personally reviewed need be part of the administrative\n6 record must yield to legal authority requiring both directly and indirectly considered documents\n7 be included in the record, see, e.g., Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555–56, and by public statements\n8 illustrating both DOJ and the White House’s direct involvement in the decision to rescind\n9 DACA.  The rule that government counsel advocates would allow agencies to contrive a record\n10 that suppresses information actually considered by decision-makers and by those making\nt 11 recommendations to the decision-makers, information that might undercut the claimed rationale\nr\nu\no a 12 for the decision.   \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 As stated, privilege log entries reveal several documents that were considered in arriving\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 at the decision to rescind DACA.  For example, at least seven entries refer to commentary in\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 media articles regarding DACA.  At oral argument, government counsel admitted that the\nS N 16 Acting Secretary had seen several media items on the issue.  There were not, however, any\nted  For the  17 media articles on DACA in the administrative record, but those that came to the Acting\ni\nn\nU\n18 Secretary should, of course, be included.6 \n19 Here, plaintiffs have rebutted the presumption of completeness.  It is evident that Acting\n20 Secretary Duke considered information directly, or indirectly, through the advice of other\n21 agencies and others within her own agency.  These documents, as set forth in detail below,\n22 should be made part of the administrative record and must be produced by defendants in an\n23 amended administrative record by NOON ON OCTOBER 27.\n24\n6  Many documents were evidently excluded in their entirety based on an assertion of “deliberative-\n25\nprocess” privilege.  Any “[f]actual portions of documents covered by the deliberative process privilege,\n[however], must be segregated and disclosed unless they are so interwoven with the deliberative material” that\n26\nthey are not segregable.  See Pac. Fisheries, Inc. v. United States, 539 F.3d 1143, 1148 (9th Cir 2008) (citations\nand quotations omitted).  Accordingly, to the extent that media articles or other non-privileged factual materials\n27\nwere considered, they should have been included in the administrative record, and shall be filed as part of the\namended administrative record, even if passages are redacted as deliberative, and called out as such in the\n28 privilege log.  \n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 9 of 14\n1 3. WAIVER OF ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE. \n2 Plaintiffs next argue that defendants have waived attorney-client privilege because they\n3 have put their attorneys’ legal opinions at issue by arguing that the rescission was required due\n4 to concerns over DACA’s legality (Br. at 15–16).  Indeed, one of DHS’s primary rationales for\n5 rescinding DACA was its purported illegality (see Dkt. No. 64-1 at 253–56 (Rescission\n6 Memorandum)).  \n7 Parties are not permitted to advance conclusions that favor their position in litigation,\n8 and at the same time shield the information that led to those conclusions from discovery. \n9 See Chevron Corp. v. Pennzoil Co., 974 F.2d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir. 1992).  Put differently, “[t]he\n10 privilege which protects attorney-client communications may not be used both as a sword and a\nt 11 shield.”   Ibid.  Where a party raises a claim, which in fairness to its adversary requires it to\nr\nu\no a 12 reveal the information or communication that claim is predicated upon, it has implicitly waived\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 any privilege over that communication.  \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Here, defendants argue that DHS had to rescind DACA because it exceeded the lawful\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 authority of the agency.  They cannot, therefore, simultaneously refuse to disclose the legal\nS N 16 research that led to that conclusion.  Defendants indeed, have included the September 4 legal\nted  For the  17 opinion of the Attorney General, pithy as it may be — yet they seek to conceal all other legal\ni\nn\nU\n18 analysis available to the Acting Secretary and to the Attorney General.   \n19 Significantly, defendants slide into a backup argument that the agency’s legal worry was\n20 “reasonable” even if wrong.  If this backup argument comes into play (as government counsel\n21 posits) then the “reasonableness” of taking an incorrect legal position would heavily turn on the\n22 underlying legal analysis so far withheld from view.   In other words, assessing the\n23 reasonableness of the Secretary’s legal rationale would turn, in part, on how consistent the\n24 analysis has been in the runup to the rescission.\n25 Defendants’ arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  They first argue, without citation\n26 to any legal authority, that “[w]ere plaintiffs’ argument accepted, the government would be\n27 deemed to have waived all privileges any time an assessment of the legal landscape informed an\n28 agency’s decisionsmaking” (Opp. at 21).  This argument vastly exaggerates plaintiffs’ position,\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 10 of 14\n1 and misrepresents the position defendants have staked out in this litigation.  DHS specifically\n2 relied upon DOJ’s assessment that DACA “was effectuated . . . without proper statutory\n3 authority,” “was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch” and “has\n4 the same legal and constitutional defects that courts recognized as to DAPA” (Dkt. No. 64-1 at\n5 254).  Plaintiffs are entitled to challenge whether this was a reasonable legal position and thus a\n6 reasonable basis for rescission.  In making that challenge, plaintiffs are entitled to review the\n7 internal analyses that led up to this change in position.        \n8 Defendants further argue that the decisions cited by plaintiffs are inapplicable because\n9 they arose in different contexts than the present action.  True, the decisions plaintiffs cite did\n10 not arise in identical circumstances.  E.g. Chevron Corp., 974 F.2d at 1162 (defendant\nt 11 prohibited from relying on legal opinion that tax position was reasonable while refusing to\nr\nu\no a 12 disclose the attorney communications leading to that conclusion).  They still, however, stand for\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 the widely-accepted proposition that it is unfair for a litigant to defend his action with a\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 selective disclosure of evidence.  This principle carries no less force here.  \n  Di\ntates orthern  15 In the related context of FOIA, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that\nS N 16 “the attorney-client privilege may not be invoked to protect a document adopted as, or\nted  For the  17 incorporated by reference into an agency’s policy.”  Nat’l Council of La Raza v. Dep't of\ni\nn\nU\n18 Justice, 411 F.3d 350, 360 (2d Cir. 2005).  There, DOJ invoked the reasoning of an OLC\n19 memorandum to justify its new position on an immigration issue.  Id. at 357.  The court held\n20 that the agency’s “view that it may adopt a legal position while shielding from public view the\n21 analysis that yielded that position is offensive to FOIA.”  Id. at 360.  So too here.     \n22 Defendants have waived attorney-client privilege over any materials that bore on\n23 whether or not DACA was an unlawful exercise of executive power and therefore should be\n24 rescinded. \n25 4. DELIBERATIVE-PROCESS PRIVILEGE BALANCING.\n26 Defendants further assert the deliberative-process privilege over many documents.  \n27 The deliberative-process privilege, however, is qualified and will yield when the need\n28 for materials and accurate fact-finding “override the government’s interest in non-disclosure.” \n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 11 of 14\n1 F.T.C. v. Warner Commc’ns Inc., 742 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1984).  “Among factors to\n2 be considered in making this determination are:  (1) the relevance of the evidence; (2) the\n3 availability of other evidence; (3) the government’s role in the litigation; and (4) the extent to\n4 which disclosure would hinder frank and independent discussion regarding contemplated\n5 policies and decisions.”  Ibid.  \n6 As set forth below, the judge has personally reviewed in camera all materials on the\n7 privilege log and applied the foregoing test to each document for which the deliberative-process\n8 privilege is claimed.7\n9 5. PRIVILEGE LOG REQUIREMENT.\n10 While defendants did not file a privilege log with their original production, they have\nt 11 since, pursuant to order, filed a privilege log claiming attorney-client or deliberative-process\nr\nu\no a 12 privilege over 84 documents considered by Secretary Duke but not included in the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 administrative record (Dkt. Nos. 67; 71-2).  Nevertheless, defendants argue that privilege logs\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 are not generally required in connection with an administrative record and that one should not\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 be required here.    \nS N 16   Our court of appeals has not spoken on the issue.  Every court in this district\nted  For the  17 considering the issue, however, has required administrative agencies to provide a privilege log. \ni\nn\nU\n18 See, e.g., Ctr. for Food Safety v. Vilsack, No. 15CV01590HSGKAW, 2017 WL 1709318, at *5\n19 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 2017) (Magistrate Judge Kandis Westmore) (“[C]ourts in this district have\n20 required parties withholding documents on the basis of the deliberative process privilege to, at a\n21 minimum, substantiate those claims in a privilege log.”); Inst. for Fisheries Res. v. Burwell, No.\n22 16-CV-01574-VC, 2017 WL 89003, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2017) (Judge Vince Chhabria);\n23 Lockyer, 2006 WL 708914, at *4.  \n24\n25\n26\n27\n7  Although not addressed in the brief or at oral argument, the privilege log referenced personal privacy\nand executive privilege objections for certain documents.  No substantial privacy interest is implicated in any of\n28\nthe documents ordered to be produced below, nor do any of these documents fall within the executive privilege.  \n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 12 of 14\n1 “If a privilege applies, the proper strategy isn’t pretending the protected material wasn’t\n2 considered, but withholding or redacting the protected material and then logging the privilege.” \n3 Inst. for Fisheries Res., 2017 WL 89002 at *1.8 \n4 Courts outside this district that have determined no privilege log was required have done\n5 so on the grounds that the defendants’ judgment of what constitutes the administrative record is\n6 entitled to a presumption of correctness.  See San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Jewell,\n7 No. 115CV01290LJOGSA, 2016 WL 3543203, at *19 (E.D. Cal. June 23, 2016) (Judge\n8 Lawrence O’Neill); Nat’l Ass’n of Chain Drug Stores v. United States Dep't of Health &\n9 Human Servs., 631 F. Supp. 2d 23, 27 (D.D.C. 2009).  Here, however, that presumption has\n10 been overcome by plaintiffs’ showing that defendants failed to include documents considered in\nt 11 arriving at the final decision to rescind DACA in the administrative record.  Therefore, even\nr\nu\no a 12 applying those courts’ logic, a privilege log would still be appropriate here.\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Going forward, defendants shall comply with the standing order in this case and provide\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 a privilege log for all documents withheld on grounds of privilege, which log shall include all\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 authors and recipients of privileged documents, as well as other information set forth in the rule\nS N 16 (see Dkt. No. 23 ¶ 18).\nted  For the  17 RELIEF ORDERED\ni\nn\nU\n18 Plaintiffs’ motion to complete the administrative record is GRANTED to the extent now\n19 stated.  Defendants are directed to complete the administrative record by adding to it all emails,\n20 letters, memoranda, notes, media items, opinions and other materials directly or indirectly\n21 considered in the final agency decision to rescind DACA, to the following extent:  (1) all\n22 materials actually seen or considered, however briefly, by Acting Secretary Duke in connection\n23 with the potential or actual decision to rescind DACA (except as stated in the next paragraph\n24 below), (2) all DACA-related materials considered by persons (anywhere in the government)\n25 who thereafter provided Acting Secretary Duke with written advice or input regarding the\n26\n8   In a memorandum opinion, our court of appeals denied a plaintiff’s request to require a privilege log. \n27\nSee Cook Inletkeeper v. EPA, 400 F. App'x 239,  240 (2010).  In that decision, however, our court of appeals\nfirst denied a motion to supplement the record, and finding that the plaintiffs had not presented evidence that the\n28\nagency had considered the documents the plaintiffs sought to compel, only then denied the accompanying\nmotion for preparation of a privilege log without further explanation.  \n12\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 12   Filed 10/17/17   Page 13 of 14\n1 actual or potential rescission of DACA, (3) all DACA-related materials considered by persons\n2 (anywhere in the government) who thereafter provided Acting Secretary Duke with verbal input\n3 regarding the actual or potential rescission of DACA, (4) all comments and questions\n4 propounded by Acting Secretary Duke to advisors or subordinates or others regarding the actual\n5 or potential rescission of DACA and their responses, and (5) all materials directly or indirectly\n6 considered by former Secretary of DHS John Kelly leading to his February 2017 memorandum\n7 not to rescind DACA.\n8 The undersigned judge has balanced the deliberative-process privilege factors and\n9 determined in camera that the following materials from the government’s in camera\n10 submission, listed by tab number, shall be included in the administrative record: 1–6, 7 (only\nt 11 the header and material on pages 3–4 concerning DACA), 12, 14, 17–25, 27–30, 36, 39, 44, 47,\nr\nu\no a 12 49 (only the first paragraph, and the paragraph captioned “General”), 69–70, 73–74, 77, 79, 81,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 84.  The remainder of the in camera submission need not be included. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 If the government redacts or withholds any material based on deliberative-process, or\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 any other privilege in its next filing, it shall simultaneously lodge full copies of all such\nS N 16 materials, indicating by highlighting (or otherwise) the redactions and withholdings together\nted  For the  17 with a log justification for each.  The judge will review and rule on each item.\ni\nn\nU\n18 Plaintiffs’ insistence that defendants scour the Department of Justice and the White\n19 House for documents for inclusion in the administrative record is overruled except to the\n20 limited extent that DOJ or White House personnel fall within the category described in the first\n21 paragraph above as someone who gave verbal or written input to the Acting Secretary.  Nor do\n22 defendants have to search for DACA materials below the agency levels indicated in the first\n23 paragraph above.  These are intended as practical limits on what would otherwise be a bone-\n24 crushing expedition to locate needles in haystacks. \n25 This order, however, is not intended to limit the scope of discovery (as opposed to the\n26 scope of the administrative record).

Begun in 2012, DACA provided deferred action for certain individuals \nwithout lawful immigration status who had entered the United States as children. Several sets of \nplaintiffs sued to enjoin the rescission of DACA under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and \nunder various constitutional theories not relevant here. \nThe merits of those claims are not before us today. The only issue is a procedural one, raised by the \ngovernment's petition for a writ of mandamus. The government asks us to permanently stay the \ndistrict court's order of October 17, 2017, which required it to complete the administrative \nrecord.[1] See Order re Motion to Complete Administrative Record, Regents of the 1205*1205 Univ. of \nCal. v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., No. C 17-05211 WHA, 2017 WL 4642324 (October 17, 2017) \n(\"Order\"). We have jurisdiction pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. Because the district \ncourt did not clearly err by ordering the completion of the administrative record, we hold that the \ngovernment has not met the high bar required for mandamus relief. \nOne note at the outset: We are not unmindful of the separation-of-powers concerns raised by the \ngovernment. However, the narrow question presented here simply does not implicate those \nconcerns. We consider only whether DHS failed to comply with its obligation under the APA to \nprovide a complete administrative record to the court — or, more precisely, whether the district court \n\nclearly erred in so holding. See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420, \n91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (\"[R]eview is to be based on the full administrative record that \nwas before the Secretary at the time he made his decision.\"). This obligation is imposed to ensure \nthat agency action does not become effectively unreviewable, for \"[i]f the record is not complete, \nthen the requirement that the agency decision be supported by `the record' becomes almost \nmeaningless.\" Portland Audubon Soc'y v. Endangered Species Comm., 984 F.2d 1534, 1548 (9th \nCir. 1993). Assuring that DHS complies with this requirement — imposed by the APA on all agencies \nand embodied in decades of precedent — is undoubtedly a proper judicial function. \n1. \"The writ of mandamus is a drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved only for really \nextraordinary cases.\" In re Van Dusen, 654 F.3d 838, 840 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Ex parte \nFahey, 332 U.S. 258, 259-60, 67 S.Ct. 1558, 91 L.Ed. 2041 (1947) (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). Indeed, \"only exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power or a \nclear abuse of discretion will justify the invocation of this extraordinary remedy.\" Cheney v. U.S. Dist. \nCourt, 542 U.S. 367, 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004) (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). Ultimately, the issuance of the writ is \"in large measure ... a matter of the court's \ndiscretion.\" Johnson v. Consumerinfo.com, Inc., 745 F.3d 1019, 1023 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting United \nStates v. Sherman, 581 F.2d 1358, 1361 (9th Cir. 1978)). \nOur discretion is guided by the five factors laid out in Bauman v. U.S. District Court, 557 F.2d 650 \n(9th Cir. 1977). However, we need not consider four of those five factors here, because \"the \nabsence of factor three — clear error as a matter of law — will always defeat a petition for \nmandamus.\" In re Bundy, 840 F.3d 1034, 1041 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting In re United States, 791 F.3d \n945, 955 (9th Cir. 2015)). This factor — whether \"[t]he district court's order is clearly erroneous as a \nmatter of law,\" Bauman, 557 F.2d at 654-55 — \"is significantly deferential and is not met unless the \nreviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" In re \nBundy, 840 F.3d at 1041 (quoting In re United States, 791 F.3d at 955). \n2. The district court's order is not clearly erroneous as a matter of law. APA § 706 provides that \narbitrary and capricious review shall be based upon \"the whole record or those parts of it cited by a \nparty.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706. The whole record \"includes everything that was before the agency pertaining \nto the merits of its decision.\" Portland Audubon, 984 F.2d at 1548; see also, e.g., James Madison \nLtd. by Hecht v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085, 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (\"The administrative record includes all \nmaterials compiled by the agency that were before the agency at the time 1206*1206 the decision \nwas made.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). More specifically, we have explained \nthat the whole administrative record \"consists of all documents and materials directly \nor indirectly considered by agency decision-makers and includes evidence contrary to the agency's \nposition.\" Thompson v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 885 F.2d 551, 555 (9th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); see also Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F.2d 735, 739 (10th Cir. 1993) (same). \nThe record is thus not necessarily limited to \"those documents that the agency has compiled and \nsubmitted as `the' administrative record.\" Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nAt the initial case management conference before the district court, the government agreed to \nproduce the complete administrative record on October 6, 2017. On that date, the government \nsubmitted as \"the\" administrative record fourteen documents comprising a mere 256 pages, all of \nwhich are publicly available on the internet. Indeed, all of the documents in the government's \nproffered record had previously been included in filings in the district court in this case, and 192 of its \n256 pages consist of the Supreme Court, Fifth Circuit, and district court opinions in the Texas v. \nUnited States litigation.[2] \n\nFaced with this sparse record, and on the plaintiffs' motion (opposed by the government), the district \ncourt ordered the government to complete the record to include, among other things, all DACA-\nrelated materials considered by subordinates or other government personnel who then provided \nwritten or verbal input directly to Acting Secretary Duke. The district court excluded from the record \ndocuments that it determined in camera are protected by privilege. Order at *8. \n3. The administrative record submitted by the government is entitled to a presumption of \ncompleteness which may be rebutted by clear evidence to the contrary. Bar MK Ranches, 994 F.2d \nat 740; see also Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555 (noting that the administrative record \"is not necessarily \nthose documents that the agency has compiled and submitted as `the' administrative record.\"). The \ndistrict court correctly stated this legal framework and concluded that the presumption of \ncompleteness had been rebutted here. Order at *5. This conclusion was not clear legal error: Put \nbluntly, the notion that the head of a United States agency would decide to terminate a program \ngiving legal protections to roughly 800,000 people[3] based solely on 256 pages of publicly available \ndocuments is not credible, as the district court concluded.[4] \nThe district court identified several specific categories of materials that were likely considered by the \nActing Secretary or those advising her, but which were not included in the government's proffered \nrecord. For example, the record contains no materials from the Department of Justice or the White \nHouse — other than a 1207*1207 one-page letter from Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions — \ndespite evidence that both bodies were involved in the decision to end DACA, including the \nPresident's own press release taking credit for the decision.[5] Nor does the proffered record include \nany documents from Acting Secretary Duke's subordinates; we agree with the district court that \"it \nstrains credulity\" to suggest that the Acting Secretary decided to terminate DACA \"without consulting \none advisor or subordinate within DHS.\" Order at *4. And the proffered record contains no materials \naddressing the change of position between February 2017 — when then-Secretary John Kelly \naffirmatively decided not to end DACA — and Acting Secretary Duke's September 2017 decision to \ndo the exact opposite, despite the principle that reasoned agency decision-making \"ordinarily \ndemand[s] that [the agency] display awareness that it is changing position\" and \"show that there are \ngood reasons for the new policy.\" F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515, 129 \nS.Ct. 1800, 173 L.Ed.2d 738 (2009). \nAt oral argument, the government took the position that because the Acting Secretary's stated \njustification for her decision was litigation risk, materials unrelated to litigation risk need not be \nincluded in the administrative record. Simply put, this is not what the law dictates. The administrative \nrecord consists of all materials \"considered by agency decision-makers,\" Thompson, 885 F.2d at \n555 (emphasis added), not just those which support or form the basis for the agency's ultimate \ndecision. See also, e.g., Amfac Resorts, LLC v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 143 F.Supp.2d 7, 12 (D.D.C. \n2001) (\"[A] complete administrative record should include all materials that `might have influenced \nthe agency's decision,' and not merely those on which the agency relied in its final decision.\") \n(quoting Bethlehem Steel v. EPA, 638 F.2d 994, 1000 (7th Cir. 1980)). And even if the record were \nproperly limited to materials relating to litigation risk, the district court did not clearly err in concluding \nthat it is implausible that the Acting Secretary would make a litigation-risk decision \"without having \ngenerated any materials analyzing the lawsuit or other factors militating in favor of and against the \nswitch in policy.\" Order at *4. \nIt was therefore not clear error for the district court to conclude that the presumption of regularity that \nattaches to the government's proffered record is rebutted, and that ordering completion of the record \nwas necessary and appropriate. \n4. Nor did the district court clearly err in identifying the materials that should have been included \nwithin the scope of the complete administrative record. The government challenges the decision to \n\ninclude materials considered by subordinates who then briefed the Acting Secretary, but this \ndecision was not clear legal error. We have held that the record properly includes \"all documents \nand materials directly or indirectly considered by agency decision-makers,\" Thompson, 885 F.2d at \n555, but have not yet clarified the exact scope of \"indirectly considered.\" District courts in this and \nother circuits, however, have interpreted that phrase to include materials relied on by subordinates \nwho directly advised the ultimate decision-maker. See, e.g., Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Gutierrez, No. \nC 01-0421 JL, 2008 WL 11358008, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 14, 2008) (\"To the extent 1208*1208 [the \ngovernment argues] that only those documents that reached [the agency's] most senior \nadministrators were in fact `considered,' courts have rejected that view as contrary to the Ninth and \nother Circuits' pronouncements....\"); GeorgiaCarry.org, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 212 \nF.Supp.3d 1348, 1352 (N.D. Ga. 2016) (\"Documents and materials indirectly considered by agency \ndecision-makers are those that may not have literally passed before the eyes of the decision-\nmakers, but were so heavily relied on in the recommendation that the decisionmaker constructively \nconsidered them.\"); Amfac Resorts, 143 F.Supp.2d at 12 (\"[I]f the agency decisionmaker based his \ndecision on the work and recommendations of subordinates, those materials should be included as \nwell.\").[6] \nMoreover, as noted in the district court's October 17 order, a Department of Justice guidance \ndocument directs agencies compiling the administrative record to \"[i]nclude all documents and \nmaterials prepared, reviewed, or received by agency personnel and used by or available to the \ndecision-maker, even though the final decision-maker did not actually review or know about the \ndocuments and materials.\" U.S. Dep't of Justice, Env't and Nat. Res. Div., Guidance to Federal \nAgencies on Compiling the Administrative Record 3 (Jan. 1999) (emphasis added). It further \nprovides that the administrative record should include \"communications the agency received from \nother agencies ... documents and materials that support or oppose the challenged agency decision \n... minutes of meetings or transcripts thereof... [and] memorializations of telephone conversations \nand meetings, such as a memorandum or handwritten notes.\" Id. at 3-4. The district court's October \n17 order complies with this Department of Justice guidance; the government's proffered record does \nnot. \nWe recognize that such guidance is not binding; we nevertheless find it persuasive as a statement \nby the Department of Justice as to what should be included in a complete administrative record. We \nalso note that the guidance document DHS failed to comply with here was inexplicably rescinded the \nvery same day that the government filed this petition for a writ of mandamus. \nGiven that the district court's interpretation of Thompson is consistent with the rulings of other district \ncourts, comports with the Department of Justice's guidance on administrative records, and is not \nforeclosed by Ninth Circuit authority, we cannot say that the district court's interpretation was clearly \nerroneous as a matter of law. See In re Swift Transp. Co., 830 F.3d 913, 916-17 (9th Cir. 2016) (\"It is \nwell established that `[t]he absence of controlling precedent weighs strongly against a finding of \nclear error [for mandamus purposes].'\") (quoting In re Van Dusen, 654 F.3d at 845).[7] \n1209*1209 5. The district court's order that the government complete the record with documents \nconsidered by former DHS Secretary John Kelly in the course of deciding not to terminate DACA in \nFebruary 2017 also withstands mandamus scrutiny. This is not because of some freestanding \nrequirement that all the materials underlying a previous decision on a similar subject are always part \nof the administrative record; rather, it simply recognizes that both decisions were part of an ongoing \ndecision-making process regarding deferred action: In February 2017, Secretary Kelly ended other \nprioritization programs, but left DACA and DAPA in place; in June 2017, Secretary Kelly ended \nDAPA but left DACA intact; finally, in September 2017, Acting Secretary Duke ended DACA. The \nmaterials considered by Secretary Kelly in the course of deciding against ending DACA in February \n2017 did not cease to be \"before the agency\" for purposes of the administrative record during that \n\nseven-month evolution in policy. Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555-56. The district court's decision to order \ntheir inclusion in the record was therefore not clear legal error. \n6. Finally, the government makes two categorical arguments with respect to privilege.[8] First, it \ncontends that Cheney v. U.S. District Court, 542 U.S. 367, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 \n(2004), bars the completion of the administrative record with any White House materials, because \nrequiring White House officials to search for and assert privilege as to individual documents would \nbe an unwarranted intrusion into executive decision-making. Cheney, of course, did not involve an \nadministrative agency's obligation under the APA to provide the court with the record underlying its \ndecision-making. It instead involved civil discovery requests that the Supreme Court described \nvariously as \"overbroad\" and as \"ask[ing] for everything under the sky.\" Id. at 383, 387, 124 S.Ct. \n2576. We do not read Cheney as imposing a categorical bar against requiring DHS to either include \nWhite House documents in a properly-defined administrative record or assert privilege individually as \nto those documents. \nMoreover, the reasoning of Cheney appears to be based substantially on the fact that the Vice \nPresident himself was the subject of discovery. See id. at 381, 124 S.Ct. 2576 (\"Here, however, the \nVice President and his comembers on the NEPDG are the subjects of the discovery orders.\"), 382 \n(\"These separation-of-powers considerations should inform a court of appeals' evaluation of a \nmandamus petition involving the President or the Vice President.\"). Here, although the government \nis of course correct that the President is named as a defendant in some of the underlying lawsuits, \nthere is no indication that either his documents or those of the Vice President would fall within the \ncompleted administrative record as ordered by the district court. Cheney therefore does not render \nthe district court's order clearly erroneous. \n1210*1210 Second, the government argues that it was clear legal error to require a privilege log and \nto evaluate documents allegedly protected by the deliberative process privilege on an individual \nbasis, since \"deliberative\" materials are not properly within the administrative record at all. As noted \nabove, the district court reviewed in camera each of the documents as to which the government \nasserted the deliberative process privilege, and ordered the inclusion of only those documents that \nmet the balancing standard laid out in FTC v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 742 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. \n1984). The court stated that it would similarly review in camera any additional documents as to \nwhich the government claims privilege in the future. Order at *8. \nAs the government acknowledges, we have not previously addressed whether assertedly \ndeliberative documents must be logged and examined or whether the government may exclude \nthem from the administrative record altogether. However, many district courts within this circuit have \nrequired a privilege log and in camera analysis of assertedly deliberative materials in APA \ncases. See, e.g., Ctr. for Food Safety v. Vilsack, No. 15-cv-01590, 2017 WL 1709318, at *5 (N.D. \nCal. May 3, 2017); Inst. for Fisheries Res. v. Burwell, No. 16-cv-01574 VC, 2017 WL 89003, at *1 \n(N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2017); California ex rel. Lockyer v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., No. C05-03508 EDL, \n2006 WL 708914, at *4 (N.D. Cal. March 16, 2008). Again, \"the absence of controlling precedent\" \nand the practice of the district courts \"weigh[] strongly against a finding of clear error\" for purposes of \nmandamus. In re Swift Transp. Co., 830 F.3d at 916-17 (citation omitted). \nWe further note that the \"deliberative\" materials at issue in the main case cited by the \ngovernment, San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 789 F.2d 26 \n(D.C. Cir. 1986) (en banc), were transcripts of literal deliberations among the members of a multi-\nmember agency board. See id. at 44. Where — as in Mothers for Peace — an agency is headed by \na multi-member board, the deliberations among those members are analogous to the internal mental \nprocesses of the sole head of an agency, and thus are generally not within the scope of the \nadministrative record. Cf. Portland Audubon, 984 F.2d at 1549 (distinguishing Mothers for Peace as \n\ninvolving \"the internal deliberative processes of the agency [and] the mental processes of individual \nagency members\") (emphases added). No such deliberations among a multi-member agency are at \nissue here. The district court's decision to require a privilege log and evaluate claims of privilege on \nan individual basis before including documents in the record was not clearly erroneous as a matter \nof law. \n* * * \nThe district court's October 17, 2017 order represents a reasonable approach to managing the \nconduct and exigencies of this important litigation — exigencies which were dictated by the \ngovernment's March 5, 2018 termination date for DACA. In order for the government to prevail in its \nrequest for the extraordinary remedy of mandamus, we must be \"left with a definite and firm \nconviction that a mistake has been committed.\" In re Bundy, 840 F.3d at 1041 (quoting In re United \nStates, 791 F.3d at 955). We are left with no such conviction here, and mandamus relief is therefore \nnot appropriate. \nAccordingly, the stay of proceedings entered on October 24, 2017 is lifted. \nPETITION DENIED. \nWATFORD, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nI understand why the district court ordered the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide a \nmore fulsome administrative record. The agency's decision 1211*1211 to rescind DACA will \nprofoundly disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, and a policy shift of that magnitude \npresumably would not have been made without extensive study and analysis beforehand. But the \ndesire for greater insight into how DHS arrived at its decision is not a legitimate basis for ordering \nthe agency to expand the administrative record, unless the plaintiffs make a threshold factual \nshowing justifying such action. They have not done so here. As a result, I think the district court's \norder constitutes \"a clear abuse of discretion,\" and the burden imposed by the order is exceptional \nenough to warrant the extraordinary remedy of mandamus. Cheney v. United States District Court \nfor the District of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 380, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004). \nThe district court's order violates two well-settled principles governing judicial review of agency \naction under the Administrative Procedure Act. The first is that a court ordinarily conducts its review \n\"based on the record the agency presents to the reviewing court.\" Florida Power & Light Co. v. \nLorion, 470 U.S. 729, 743-44, 105 S.Ct. 1598, 84 L.Ed.2d 643 (1985); see also Camp v. Pitts, 411 \nU.S. 138, 142, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973) (per curiam). If the record compiled by the \nagency is inadequate to support the challenged action, the reviewing court will usually be required to \nvacate the agency's action and remand for additional investigation or explanation. Florida \nPower, 470 U.S. at 744, 105 S.Ct. 1598. So in most cases the agency bears the risk associated with \nfiling an incomplete record, not the challengers. \nThe second principle is that documents reflecting an agency's internal deliberative processes are \nordinarily not part of the administrative record. See In re Subpoena Duces Tecum Served on the \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, 156 F.3d 1279, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1998); Kansas State \nNetwork, Inc. v. FCC, 720 F.2d 185, 191 (D.C. Cir. 1983). An agency generally has no obligation to \ninclude documents that were prepared to assist the decision-maker in arriving at her decision, such \nas memos or emails containing opinions, recommendations, or advice. These pre-decisional \nmaterials are not deemed part of the administrative record because they are irrelevant to the \nreviewing court's task. The court's function is to assess the lawfulness of the agency's action based \n\non the reasons offered by the agency, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United \nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 \nL.Ed.2d 443 (1983), not to \"probe the mental processes\" of agency decision-makers in reaching their \nconclusions. Morgan v. United States, 304 U.S. 1, 18, 58 S.Ct. 773, 82 L.Ed. 1129 (1938). Requiring \nroutine disclosure of deliberative process materials would also chill the frank discussions and \ndebates that are necessary to craft well-considered policy. See Assembly of the State of California v. \nDepartment of Commerce, 968 F.2d 916, 920 (9th Cir. 1992); San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace v. \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, 789 F.2d 26, 45 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (en banc) (plurality opinion). \nThere are exceptions to these general rules. First, expansion of the record may be required when \nthe agency fails to make formal findings and thus leaves the reviewing court unable to discern the \nagency's reasons for taking the action that it did. See Public Power Council v. Johnson, 674 F.2d \n791, 793-94 (9th Cir. 1982). (This exception doesn't apply here because the memo issued by the \nActing Secretary explicitly states her asserted reason for rescinding DACA: concern that the \nprogram would be invalidated in threatened litigation.) Second, the record may be expanded if there \nis evidence that the agency cherry-picked the materials it included by omitting factual information \nundermining the 1212*1212 conclusions it reached. See Portland Audubon Society v. Endangered \nSpecies Committee, 984 F.2d 1534, 1548 (9th Cir. 1993). And third, documents reflecting an \nagency's internal deliberations may on occasion be made part of the record, but only if the \nchallengers make \"a strong showing of bad faith or improper behavior\" on the part of agency \ndecision-makers. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420, 91 S.Ct. 814, \n28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. \n980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, 156 F.3d at 1279-80. \nThe plaintiffs have not made the showing necessary to trigger either of the latter two exceptions. \nThey have not shown any likelihood that factual information considered by the Acting Secretary and \nrelevant to her decision has been omitted from the record. Indeed, it would be implausible to think \nthat any such material exists, given the nature of the reason asserted by the Acting Secretary for \nrescinding DACA. Concern over the program's vulnerability to legal challenge would rest not on \nfactual information but on the legal analysis of lawyers. Documents analyzing DACA's potential legal \ninfirmities, prepared to assist the Acting Secretary in assessing the gravity of the litigation risk \ninvolved, fall squarely within the category of deliberative process materials mentioned above. They \nare presumptively outside the scope of what must be included in the administrative record (and may \nbe privileged in any event). \nNor have the plaintiffs attempted at this stage of the case to show bad faith or improper behavior on \nthe part of the Acting Secretary. To be sure, they assert in their brief that they suspect her stated \nreason for rescinding DACA is pretextual. But bare assertions of that sort fall far short of the showing \nneeded to overcome the presumption that agency decision-makers have acted for the reasons \nthey've given. \nBecause the plaintiffs have failed to establish that any of these exceptions apply, I don't think the \ndistrict court's order can stand. The court directed DHS to include in the administrative record all \nDACA-related \"emails, letters, memoranda, notes, media items, opinions, and other materials\" \nconsidered by the Acting Secretary, and all such materials considered by any other government \nofficial — including officials from the Department of Justice and the White House — who provided \nthe Acting Secretary with written or verbal input on the decision to rescind DACA. The court further \nexpanded the record to include \"all comments and questions propounded by Acting Secretary Duke \nto advisors or subordinates or others regarding the actual or potential rescission of DACA and their \nresponses.\" \n\nIn my view, the district court exceeded the scope of its lawful authority to expand the administrative \nrecord. The order sweeps far beyond materials related to the sole reason given for rescinding DACA \n— its supposed unlawfulness and vulnerability to legal challenge. The order requires the inclusion of \nall documents mentioning DACA-related issues of any sort, and is overbroad for that reason alone. \nBut even if the order had been limited to documents analyzing the risk that DACA might be \ninvalidated, those materials are deliberative in character and thus could not be made part of the \nadministrative record absent a showing of bad faith or improper behavior. And to the extent the order \nwill compel the production of communications between the Acting Secretary and high-level officials \nin the White House — including, potentially, the President himself — the order raises the same \nsensitive separation-of-powers concerns that made mandamus relief appropriate in Cheney. \nSee 542 U.S. at 389-90, 124 S.Ct. 2576. \n1213*1213 These departures from settled principles are enough to establish that the district court's \norder is \"clearly erroneous as a matter of law,\" which is the most important of the factors we consider \nwhen deciding whether to grant mandamus relief. In re Bundy, 840 F.3d 1034, 1041 (9th Cir. 2016). \nThe other factors weigh in favor of granting relief as well. The order isn't immediately appealable, \nand if relief is denied the harm inflicted will be immediate and irreparable. As the declarations \nsubmitted by the government attest, the search for documents responsive to the court's order will be \nburdensome and intrusive, given the large number of government officials who may have provided \nwritten or verbal input to the Acting Secretary. And the damage caused by public disclosure of \notherwise privileged materials can't be undone following an appeal from the final judgment. \nThis strikes me as a classic case in which mandamus relief is warranted, and I would therefore grant \nthe writ. \n[1] Issues regarding supplementation — as opposed to completion — of the record and the propriety of discovery on the \nnon-APA claims, including the propriety of depositions, are not properly before us at this time, and we do not address them \nhere. \n[2] That lawsuit challenged a related but distinct deferred action policy, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful \nPermanent Residents, or DAPA. See United States v. Texas, ___ U.S. ___, 136 S.Ct. 2271, 195 L.Ed.2d 638 (2016); Texas \nv. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015); Texas v. United States, 86 F.Supp.3d 591 (S.D. Tex. 2015). \n[3] See U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Number of Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals, by Fiscal Year, Quarter, Intake, Biometrics and Case Status Fiscal Year 2012-2017 (June 30) (Sept. 20, 2017), \ngoo.gl/UcGJww. \n[4] The dissent agrees that \"a policy shift of that magnitude presumably would not have been made without extensive study \nand analysis beforehand.\" Dissent at 1211. \n[5] See Press Release, White House Office of the Press Secretary, President Donald J. Trump Restores Responsibility and \nthe Rule of Law to Immigration (Sept. 5, 2017), https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/05/president-donald-j-\ntrump-restores-responsibility-and-rule-law. \n[6] We also note that the government has conceded in other cases that documents relied on by subordinates are properly \npart of the administrative record. See Oceana, Inc. v. Pritzker, No. 16-cv-06784-LHK (SVK), 2017 WL 2670733, at *4 (N.D. \nCal. June 21, 2017) (\"Defendants acknowledge ... that a decision-maker can be deemed to have `constructively considered' \nmaterials that, for example, were relied on by subordinates....\"). \n[7] There is tension within our decisions about whether controlling Ninth Circuit precedent is a necessary precondition to \nfinding clear error as a matter of law. Compare In re Swift Transp. Co., 830 F.3d at 917 (\"If `no prior Ninth Circuit authority \nprohibited the course taken by the district court, its ruling is not clearly erroneous.'\") (quoting In re Morgan, 506 F.3d 705, \n713 (9th Cir. 2007)), with Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 591 F.3d 1147, 1159 (9th Cir. 2010) (\"[T]he necessary clear error factor \ndoes not require that the issue be one as to which there is established precedent.\") (emphasis added). At a minimum, \nhowever, the lack of such authority \"weighs strongly\" against finding clear error. In re Swift Transp. Co., 830 F.3d at 916. \n\n[8] The government also appears to challenge the district court's individual privilege determinations, but it has provided little \nin the way of argument regarding the specific documents ordered disclosed by the district court. We are unable to conclude \nthat the government has met its burden of showing that the district court's privilege analysis was clearly erroneous as a \nmatter of law. \n ",

For the reasons discussed below, the motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n23\nSTATEMENT\n24\nThis order incorporates the statement set forth in the order dated January 9, 2018,\n25\nlargely denying dismissal under FRCP 12(b)(1) and largely granting plaintiffs’ motion for\n26\nprovisional relief (Dkt. No. 234).  This order, however, addresses a separate motion by the\n27\ngovernment to dismiss all claims for failure to state a claim for relief under FRCP 12(b)(6). \n28\nThis order sustains three claims for relief but finds that the rest fall short.  \n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 2 of 14\n1 ANALYSIS\n2 1. APA CLAIMS UNDER 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\n3   For the same reasons that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the\n4 rescission of DACA was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n5 accordance with law” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, as explained in the\n6 January 9 order, the government’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ APA claims under 5 U.S.C. §\n7 706(2)(A) is DENIED.\n8 2. APA CLAIMS UNDER 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).\n9 The original DACA program began in 2012 without any notice or opportunity for public\n10 comment.  Likewise, the rescission in question ended DACA without notice or opportunity for\nt 11 public comment.  One issue now presented is whether the rescission is invalid for having been\nr\nu\no a 12 carried out without notice-and-comment procedures.  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Under the APA, an agency action must be set aside if it was done “without observance\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  An agency is required to follow\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 prescribed notice-and-comment procedures before promulgating certain rules.  5 U.S.C. § 553. \nS N 16 The Regulatory Flexibility Act further requires that notice-and-comment rulemaking include\nted  For the  17 an assessment of the impact on small entities.  5 U.S.C. § 604(a).  These requirements do not\ni\nn\nU\n18 apply, however, to general statements of policy.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A).  \n19 A general statement of policy “advis[es] the public prospectively of the manner in which\n20 the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.”  Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d\n21 1006, 1012–13 (9th Cir. 1987).  Such policies also “serve to educate and provide direction to\n22 the agency’s personnel in the field, who are required to implement its policies and exercise its\n23 discretionary power in specific cases.”  Id. at 1013 (quotes and citations omitted).  “The critical\n24 factor” in determining whether a directive constitutes a general statement of policy is “the\n25 extent to which the challenged [directive] leaves the agency, or its implementing official, free to\n26 exercise discretion to follow, or not to follow, the [announced] policy in an individual case.” \n27 Ibid.  Thus, to qualify as a statement of policy two requirements must be satisfied:  (1) the\n28 policy operates only prospectively, and (2) the policy does “not establish a binding norm,” and\n2\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 3 of 14\n1 is not “finally determinative of the issues or rights to which [it] address[es],” but instead leaves\n2 officials “free to consider the individual facts in the various cases that arise.”  Id. at 1014\n3 (quotes and citations omitted).  Under this standard, the rescission memorandum is a general\n4 statement of policy.\n5 This order rejects plaintiffs’ contention that the rescission could only be done through\n6 notice and comment.  For the same reasons that the promulgation of DACA needed no notice\n7 and comment, its rescission needed no notice and comment.  \n8 Almost this exact problem was addressed in Mada-Luna.  There, our court of appeals\n9 held that the repeal of an INS policy under which applicants could seek deferred action was not\n10 subject to notice and comment.  It rejected the argument that the repeal could not constitute a\nt 11 general statement of policy because it diminished the likelihood of receiving deferred action for\nr\nu\no a 12 a class of individuals.  Id. at 1016.  Rather, because the original policy allowed for discretion\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 and failed to establish a “binding norm,” the repeal of that policy also did not require notice and\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 comment.  Id. at 1017.  So too here.  The DACA program allowed but did not require the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 agency to grant deferred action, and upon separate application, travel authorization, on a case-\nS N 16 by-case basis at the agency’s discretion.  Therefore, neither its promulgation nor its rescission\nted  For the  17 required notice and comment.  \ni\nn\nU\n18 Parco v. Morris, 426 F. Supp. 976 (E.D. Pa. 1977), on which plaintiffs heavily rely,\n19 does not warrant the conclusion that the rescission policy is a substantive rule.  Parco also\n20 addressed whether the rescission of an INS policy required notice and comment.  Notably, the\n21 government in Parco stipulated that the policy’s precipitous rescission was the sole reason for\n22 denial of the plaintiff’s application for immigration relief.  Id. at 984.  The district court\n23 determined that the repeal therefore left no discretion, explaining that “discretion” was stripped\n24 of all meaning where “one contends that under a certain regulation ‘discretion’ was exercised\n25 favorably in all cases of a certain kind and then, after repeal of the regulation, unfavorably in\n26 each such case.”  Ibid.  Here, by contrast, plaintiffs do not allege that all deferred action\n27 applications under DACA were approved but now, after the rescission, all requests for deferred\n28 action will be denied.  \n3\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 4 of 14\n1 Plaintiffs argue that the rescission memorandum is more than a policy because it creates\n2 a blanket prohibition against granting deferred action to DACA applicants.  Plaintiffs are\n3 correct that the rescission policy contains mandatory language on its face.  It is also true that the\n4 rescission memorandum categorically eliminates advance parole for DACA recipients. \n5 This comes closer to resembling a substantive rule.  However, it remains the case that because\n6 the original promulgation of the discretionary program did not require notice and comment,\n7 a return to the status quo ante also does not require notice and comment.  Mada-Luna, 813 F.2d\n8 at 1017.  \n9 Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to Section 706(2)(D) of the\n10 APA and the Regulatory Flexibility Act is accordingly GRANTED.\nt 11 3. DUE PROCESS CLAIMS.\nr\nu\no a 12 To assert a due process claim, a plaintiff must first show that he or she has an interest in\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 liberty or property protected by the Constitution.  See Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 (1972).  Plaintiffs fail to make the threshold showing that they have a protected interest in the\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 continuation of DACA and, accordingly, their due process claims based on the rescission must\nS N 16 be dismissed.  Plaintiffs have adequately alleged, however, that the agency’s changes to its\nted  For the  17 information-sharing policy are “fundamentally unfair.”  \ni\nn\nU\n18 A. Deferred Action.\n19 Because discretionary immigration relief “is a privilege created by Congress, denial of\n20 such relief cannot violate a substantive interest protected by the Due Process clause.”  Munoz v.\n21 Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing INS v. Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 30 (1996)). \n22 Moreover, “aliens have no fundamental right to discretionary relief from removal” for purposes\n23 of due process.  Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, 361 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir. 2004).  Our court of\n24 appeals has accordingly held there is no protected interest in temporary parole, since such relief\n25 is “entirely within the discretion of the Attorney General.”  Kwai Fun Wong v. United States,\n26 373 F.3d 952, 967–68 (9th Cir. 2004).  Nor did an INS policy which allowed the agency to\n27 recommend deferred action as “an act of administrative choice” create substantive liberty\n28 interests.  Romeiro de Silva v. Smith, 773 F.2d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 1985).  These authorities\n4\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 5 of 14\n1 foreclose any argument that plaintiffs have a protected interest in continued deferred action or\n2 advance parole under DACA.1\n3 Plaintiffs reply that even absent a protected interest in the initial, discretionary grant of\n4 deferred action, there is a protected interest in the renewal of DACA and its associated benefits. \n5 Yet a benefit is not a “protected entitlement” where “government officials may grant or deny it\n6 in their discretion.”  Castle Rock, 545 U.S. 748, 756 (2005).  Rather, an individual has a\n7 protected property right in public benefits where the rules conferring those benefits “greatly\n8 restrict the discretion” of the people who administer them.  Nozzi v. Hous. Auth. of City of Los\n9 Angeles, 806 F.3d 1178, 1191 (9th Cir. 2015).  Plaintiffs’ authorities confirm that the same\n10 principle applies in the context of renewing or retaining existing benefits.  Wedges/Ledges of\nt 11 California, Inc. v. City of Phoenix, Ariz., 24 F.3d 56, 64 (9th Cir. 1994); Stauch v. City of\nr\nu\no a 12 Columbia Heights, 212 F.3d 425, 430 (8th Cir. 2000).  No such limitations on agency discretion\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 are alleged to have applied under DACA.  Rather, the USCIS DACA FAQs referenced by\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 plaintiffs in their complaints make clear that “USCIS retain[ed] the ultimate discretion to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 determine whether deferred action [was] appropriate in any given case even if the guidelines\nS N 16 [were] met” (Garcia Compl. ¶ 24 n.16; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; UC Compl., Exh. B; State\nted  For the  17 Compl., Exh. E).\ni\nn\nU\n18 Next, plaintiffs argue that once DACA status was conferred, and recipients organized\n19 their lives in reliance on the program’s protections and benefits, they developed interests\n20 protected by the Constitution.  Plaintiffs’ authorities, however, stand only for the\n21 uncontroversial proposition that once in possession of a particular benefit, the alteration,\n22 revocation or suspension of that benefit may implicate due process.2  Such a principle has no\n23 application where, as here, extant benefits are not impacted by a change in policy.  Indeed, there\n24 is no dispute that the rescission acts only prospectively.  That is, all existing DACA recipients\n25\n1  Plaintiffs’ attempt to distinguish Romeiro de Silva on the ground that the INS policy there involved\n26\n“unfettered discretion,” whereas the exercise of prosecutorial discretion under DACA was guided by standard\noperating procedures, is unconvincing.  \n27\n2  See Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971); Gallo v. U.S. Dist. Court For Dist. of Arizona,\n28\n349 F.3d 1169, 1179 (9th Cir. 2003); Medina v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2017 WL 5176720, at *9\n(W.D. Wash. Nov. 8, 2017).\n5\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 6 of 14\n1 will receive deferred action through the end of their two-year terms.  What they will not receive,\n2 if the rescission endures, will be DACA renewal, thereafter.  For this reason, Ixcot v. Holder,\n3 646 F.3d 1202 (9th Cir. 2011), and Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003), which\n4 addressed whether amendments to the INA were impermissibly retroactive, do not compel a\n5 different result.\n6 Plaintiffs contend that the government’s communications with plaintiffs regarding\n7 renewals, its operation of the program, and the public promises of government officials\n8 “together created an understanding that DACA recipients were entitled to the continued benefits\n9 of the program so long as they met the renewal criteria” (Dkt. No. 205 at 29).  Plaintiffs are\n10 correct, of course, that claims of entitlement can be defined by “rules or mutually explicit\nt 11 understandings.”  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972).  Importantly, however, a\nr\nu\no a 12 person’s belief of entitlement to a government benefit, no matter how sincerely or reasonably\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 held, does not create a protected right if that belief is not mutually held by the government. \ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 Gerhart v. Lake Cty., Mont., 637 F.3d 1013, 1020 (9th Cir. 2011).  An agency’s past practice of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 generally granting a government benefit is also insufficient to establish a legal entitlement. \nS N 16 Ibid.\nted  For the  17 This order empathizes with those DACA recipients who have built their lives around\ni\nn\nU\n18 the expectation that DACA, and its associated benefits, would continue to be available to them\n19 if they played by the rules.  That expectation, however, remains insufficient to give rise to a\n20 constitutional claim under the Fifth Amendment.  Because plaintiffs have failed to allege facts\n21 demonstrating a protected interest in DACA’s continuation or the renewal of benefits\n22 thereunder, defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ due process claims based on the rescission\n23 must be GRANTED.  \n24 B. Information-Sharing Policy.\n25 Plaintiffs fare better with their substantive due process claim that DHS allegedly\n26 changed its policy with respect to the personal information provided by DACA recipients\n27 during the application process.  Plaintiffs allege that the government repeatedly represented\n28 that information provided by DACA applicants would not be used for immigration enforcement\n6\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 7 of 14\n1 purposes absent special circumstances, and that DACA recipients relied on these promises in\n2 submitting the extensive personal information needed to meet the program’s requirements.\n3 Defendants insist that the agency’s information-sharing policy remains unchanged. \n4 On a motion to dismiss, however, the well-pled factual allegations in a complaint must be\n5 accepted as true.  Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir.\n6 2008).  Plaintiffs have clearly alleged that DHS changed its information-sharing policy such\n7 that now, rather than affirmatively protecting DACA recipients’ information from disclosure,\n8 the government will only refrain from “proactively” providing their information for purposes of\n9 immigration enforcement proceedings (Garcia Compl. ¶ 126; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; State\n10 Compl. ¶ 122).  \nt 11 Plaintiffs have also adequately alleged a “mutually explicit understanding” giving rise\nr\nu\no a 12 to a protected interest in the confidentiality of DACA recipients’ personal information. \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 They allege that throughout DACA’s existence, DHS made affirmative representations as to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 how this information would (and would not) be used.  The policy stated (Garcia Compl. ¶ 126;\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 58; State Compl. ¶ 121 (citing USCIS DACA FAQs)): \nS N 16 Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure\nted  For the  17 tpor oIcCeEe dainndg sC uBnPle fsosr t hthee r pequurpeostsoer o mf eimetms tihgera ctiroitne reina ffoorrc ethmee insstuance\ni\nn of a Notice to Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set\nU\n18 forth in USCIS’ Notice to Appear guidance\n(www.uscis.gov/NTA).  Individuals whose cases are deferred\n19 pursuant to DACA will not be referred to ICE.  The information\nmay be shared with national security and law enforcement\n20 agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal,\nincluding for assistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify\n21 or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or for\nthe investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense.  The above\n22 information sharing policy covers family members and guardians,\nin addition to the requestor.  This policy, which may be modified,\n23 superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended\nto, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or\n24 benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party\nin any administrative, civil, or criminal matter.\n25\nThe language contained in the policy’s caveat, that it could “be modified, superseded,\n26\nor rescinded at any time,” is ambiguous.  One reading advanced by the government is that this\n27\ncaveat allows the agency to change how it treats information already received from DACA\n28\napplicants.  Another reading, however, is that it simply allows the government to change its\n7\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 8 of 14\n1 policy in connection with future applicants.  Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson’s\n2 December 2016 letter to United States Representative Judy Chu supports the later reading. \n3 He stated that, “[s]ince DACA was announced in 2012, DHS has consistently made clear that\n4 information provided by applicants . . . will not later be used for immigration enforcement\n5 purposes except where it is independently determined that a case involves a national security\n6 or public safety threat, criminal activity, fraud, or limited other circumstances where issuance\n7 of a notice to appear is required by law” (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 36–37; State Compl. ¶ 98, Exh. F). \n8 This ambiguity presents a question of fact that cannot be resolved on the pleadings.  \n9 Taken as true at this stage, as must be done on a FRCP 12(b)(6) motion, plaintiffs’\n10 allegations regarding the government’s broken promise as to how DACA recipients’ personal\nt 11 information will be used — and its potentially profound consequences — “shock[s] the\nr\nu\no a 12 conscience and offend[s] the community’s sense of fair play and decency.”  Marsh v. County of\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 San Diego, 680 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir. 2012) (quotes and citations omitted).  Defendants’\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ due process claims based on changes to the government’s\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 information-use policy is DENIED.  \nS N 16 4. EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL.\nted  For the  17 Plaintiffs bring claims for equitable estoppel, arguing that the government should not be\ni\nn\nU\n18 permitted to terminate DACA or use the information collected from applicants for immigration\n19 enforcement purposes. \n20 Defendants first contend that plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel claims fail because there is no\n21 recognized claim for relief based on estoppel.  The Supreme Court has refused to adopt,\n22 however, “a flat rule that estoppel may not in any circumstances run against the Government,”\n23 noting that “the public interest in ensuring that the Government can enforce the law free from\n24 estoppel might be outweighed by the countervailing interest of citizens in some minimum\n25 standard of decency, honor, and reliability in their dealings with their Government.”  Heckler v.\n26 Cmty. Health Servs. of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 60–61 (1984).  Moreover, our court of\n27 appeals has addressed such claims on the merits, and has held that the government may be\n28\n8\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 9 of 14\n1 subject to equitable estoppel if it has engaged in “affirmative misconduct.”  Watkins v. U.S.\n2 Army, 875 F.2d 699, 706–07 (9th Cir. 1989).  \n3 To state an equitable estoppel claim against the government, a party must show\n4 (1) that the government engaged in “affirmative conduct going beyond mere negligence”; and\n5 (2) “the government’s wrongful act will cause a serious injustice, and the public’s interest will\n6 not suffer undue damage” if the requested relief is granted.  Id. at 707.  “Neither the failure to\n7 inform an individual of his or her legal rights nor the negligent provision of misinformation\n8 constitute affirmative misconduct.”  Sulit v. Schiltgen, 213 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 2000). \n9 Moreover, our court of appeals has defined “affirmative misconduct” to mean a “deliberate lie”\n10 or “a pattern of false promises.”  Socop-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., 272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir. 2001). \nt 11 The allegations in the complaints fail to meet this standard, inasmuch as no affirmative instances\nr\nu\no a 12 of misrepresentation or concealment have been plausibly alleged.  \nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs are correct that estoppel “does not require that the government intend to\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 mislead a party,” Watkins, 875 F.2d 707, but plaintiffs fail to explain how contradictory policies\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 under two different administrations add up to “affirmative misconduct beyond mere negligence.”\nS N 16  Plaintiffs fail to allege, for example, that the government’s past statements regarding DACA’s\nted  For the  17 legality were a “deliberate lie” or more than mere negligence.  Nor have plaintiffs pleaded that\ni\nn\nU\n18 the alleged change in the agency’s information-use policy was the result of an affirmative\n19 misrepresentation.  Rather, they have merely alleged a change in policy.  Under plaintiffs’ theory\n20 new administrations would almost never be able to change prior policies because someone could\n21 always assert reliance upon the old policy.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ equitable\n22 estoppel claims is GRANTED. \n23 5. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIMS.  \n24 To state an equal protection claim plaintiffs must show that the rescission was motivated\n25 by a discriminatory purpose.  Arce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d 968, 977 (2015) (citing Vill. of\n26 Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977)).  Determining\n27 whether discrimination is a motivating factor “demands a sensitive inquiry into such\n28 circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.”  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at\n9\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 10 of 14\n1 266.  A plaintiff need not show that the discriminatory purpose was the sole purpose of the\n2 challenged action, but only that it was a “motivating factor.”  Ibid.  In analyzing whether a\n3 facially-neutral policy was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, district courts must consider\n4 factors such as whether the policy creates a disparate impact, the historical background and\n5 sequence of events leading up to the decision, and any relevant legislative or administrative\n6 history.  Id. at 266–68.3  \n7 First, Individual Plaintiffs and Santa Clara clearly allege that the rescission had a\n8 disproportionate impact on Latinos and Mexican nationals.  Indeed, such individuals account\n9 for 93 percent of DACA recipients (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 100, 151; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 9, 75). \n10 Defendants reply that this disparate impact is an accident of geography, not evidence of\nt 11 discrimination.  True, a disparate impact of a facially-neutral rule, standing alone, cannot\nr\nu\no a 12 establish discriminatory intent.  See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976).  Individual\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 Plaintiffs and Santa Clara, however, have alleged a discriminatory impact only as a starting\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 point.  They also allege a history of bias leading up to the rescission of DACA in the form of\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 campaign statements and other public comments by President Trump, as next discussed.4 \nS N 16 Second, plaintiffs allege that President Trump has, on multiple occasions since he\nted  For the  17 announced his presidential campaign, expressed racial animus towards Latinos and Mexicans. \ni\nn\nU\n18 When President Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015, for example, he\n19 characterized Mexicans as criminals, rapists, and “people that have lots of problems.”  Three\n20 days later, President Trump tweeted that “[d]ruggies, drug dealers, rapists and killers are coming\n21 across the southern border,” and asked, “When will the U.S. get smart and stop this travesty?” \n22\n23\n3  The Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456 (1996), which addressed\nthe showing necessary for a defendant to be entitled to discovery on a selective-prosecution claim, has no\n24\napplication here.  Plaintiffs’ claims cannot fairly be characterized as selective-prosecution claims because they\ndo not “implicate the Attorney General’s prosecutorial discretion — that is, in this context, his discretion to\n25\nchoose to deport one person rather than another among those who are illegally in the country.”  Kwai Fun\nWong, 373 F.3d at 970.  Rather, plaintiffs allege that the agency’s decision to end a nationwide deferred action\n26\nprogram was motivated by racial animus towards a protected class.  \n27\n4  The City of San Jose’s equal protection claim falls a little short.  Rather than alleging a disparate\nimpact on a protected class, it alleges only that “[d]efendants’ actions target individuals for discriminatory\n28\ntreatment based on their national origin, without lawful justification” (San Jose Compl. ¶ 54).  For this reason,\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss San Jose’s equal protection claim is GRANTED.  \n10\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 11 of 14\n1 During the first Republican presidential debate, President Trump claimed that the Mexican\n2 government “send[s] the bad ones over because they don’t want to pay for them.”  And in\n3 August 2017, he referred to undocumented immigrants as “animals” who are responsible for “the\n4 drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking, MS 13” (Garcia Compl. ¶¶\n5 102–13, 124; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 75–76).\n6 Circumstantial evidence of intent, including statements by a decisionmaker, may be\n7 considered in evaluating whether government action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. \n8 Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68.  These statements were not about the rescission (which\n9 came later) but they still have relevance to show racial animus against people south of our\n10 border. \nt 11 Should campaign rhetoric be admissible to undermine later agency action by the victors? \nr\nu\no a 12 This order recognizes that such admissibility can readily lead to mischief in challenging the\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 policies of a new administration.  We should proceed with caution and give wide berth to the\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 democratic process.  Yet are clear cut indications of racial prejudice on the campaign trail to be\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 forgotten altogether?\nS N 16 Our court of appeals recently confirmed that “evidence of purpose beyond the face of the\nted  For the  17 challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause\ni\nn\nU\n18 claims.”  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 2017).  Washington found that\n19 President Trump’s statements regarding a “Muslim ban” raised “serious allegations and\n20 presented significant constitutional questions,” although it ultimately reserved consideration of\n21 plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  Id. at 1167–68.  Citing to Washington, at least two district\n22 courts have since considered President Trump’s campaign statements in finding a likelihood of\n23 success on Establishment Clause claims.  See, e.g., Aziz v. Trump, 234 F. Supp. 3d 724, 736\n24 (E.D. Va. 2017) (Judge Leonie Brinkema); Hawai’i v. Trump, 245 F. Supp. 3d 1227, 1236 (D.\n25 Haw. 2017) (Judge Derrick Watson).  This order will follow these decisions and hold that, at\n26 least at the pleading stage, campaign rhetoric so closely tied to the challenged executive action is\n27 admissible to show racial animus.  \n28\n11\n\nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 53   Filed 01/12/18   Page 12 of 14\n1 Third, a final consideration is the unusual history behind the rescission.  DACA received\n2 reaffirmation by the agency as recently as three months before the rescission, only to be\n3 hurriedly cast aside on what seems to have been a contrived excuse (its purported illegality). \n4 This strange about-face, done at lightning speed, suggests that the normal care and consideration\n5 within the agency was bypassed (Garcia Compl. ¶ 154; Santa Clara Compl. ¶¶ 8, 77).  \n6 That President Trump has at other times shown support for DACA recipients cannot wipe\n7 the slate clean as a matter of law at the pleading stage.  Although the government argues that\n8 these allegations fail to suggest that the Acting Secretary (as the purported decisionmaker)\n9 terminated DACA due to racial animus, plaintiffs have alleged that it was President Trump\n10 himself who, in line with his campaign rhetoric, directed the decision to end the program\nt 11 (Garcia Compl. ¶¶ 11, 124; Santa Clara Compl. ¶ 21).\nr\nu\no a 12 Construed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as must be done at the pleading stage,\nC ni\n  or\nct alif 13 these allegations raise a plausible inference that racial animus towards Mexicans and Latinos\ni C\ntr of \nDis strict  14 was a motivating factor in the decision to end DACA.  The fact-intensive inquiry needed to\n  Di\ntates orthern  15 determine whether defendants acted with discriminatory intent cannot be made on the pleadings. \nS N 16 Accordingly, defendants’ motion to dismiss Santa Clara’s and Individual Plaintiffs’ equal\nted  For the  17 protection claims must be DENIED.\ni\nn\nU\n18 State Plaintiffs allege an equal protection claim on the alternative theory that the\n19 rescission “violates fundamental conceptions of justice by depriving DACA grantees, as a class,\n20 of their substantial interests in pursuing a livelihood to support themselves and further their\n21 education” (State Compl. ¶¶ 172–77).  Plaintiffs do not respond to the government’s arguments\n22 that this theory fails to state a claim under FRCP 12(b)(6).  Defendants’ motion to dismiss State\n23 Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim is accordingly GRANTED.  \n24 6. DECLARATORY RELIEF.\n25 Defendants move to dismiss the Individual Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief. \n26 Individual Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief is also contained in their prayer for relief and,\n27 accordingly, the standalone claim is superfluous.

Plaintiffs County of Santa Clara (“County”) and Service Employees International \n3  Union Local 521 (“Local 521”), acting in its capacity as the representative of more than 11,000 \n4  County employees, challenge the unlawful actions of the President of the United States and the \n5  federal government related to their attempts to terminate or curtail the Deferred Action for \n6  Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program.  \n7  2.  Since 2012, DACA has protected from deportation and extended work authorization \n8  to more than 800,000 young people who were brought to this country as children through no fault of \n9  their own.  Under its original terms, the DACA program affords recipients a two-year period of \n10  “deferred action,” meaning they are not subject to immigration enforcement actions during that time, \n11  and work authorization, allowing them to work legally, report income, and pay taxes. \n12  3.  The DACA program has been hugely successful.  Recipients have been able to come \n13  out of the shadows of American life, work legally to support themselves and their families, go to \n14  school, pay taxes, and participate more fully in their communities.  Their families have benefitted \n15  from the higher wages many recipients are able to earn and the stability of knowing that loved ones \n16  will not be separated.  And the communities in which DACA recipients live—including the County \n17  of Santa Clara—have benefitted not only from the taxes paid by recipients as they work legally and \n18  report income, but also from DACA recipients’ increased willingness to interact with government \n19  institutions, such as by contacting and cooperating with law enforcement and public health officials. \n20  4.  Despite these extensive benefits, Defendants have sought to rescind or undermine key \n21  components of the DACA program for arbitrary and inconsistent reasons.   \n22  5.  On September 5, 2017, Defendants attempted to categorically terminate the DACA \n23  program, through a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) Memorandum issued by former \n24  Acting Secretary Elaine Duke (“Duke Memorandum”).  The Duke Memorandum stated that DHS \n25  would not consider any initial DACA applications received after September 5, 2017, and explained \n26  that current DACA recipients would no longer be able to renew after October 5, 2017.  The Duke \n27  Memorandum gave no explanation for rescinding DACA other than that the Attorney General had \n28  concluded that the program was unlawful, and gave no indication that the Administration had \n \n  2 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 3 of 40\n1  considered the benefits of the program, changes that could be made to the program to address any \n2  unlawful aspects, or the reliance interests of recipients, their families, communities, and employers, \n3  before ending it so abruptly.   \n4  6.  In January 2018, this Court entered a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to \n5  continue processing renewal applications; the Ninth Circuit affirmed; and ultimately, on June 18, \n6  2020, the Supreme Court set aside the Duke Memorandum rescinding DACA as arbitrary and \n7  capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.  The Supreme Court also denied the federal \n8  government’s then-pending petition for certiorari from a ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n9  Fourth Circuit, which likewise concluded that the Duke Memorandum was arbitrary and capricious \n10  and must be set aside.  Shortly thereafter, the Fourth Circuit issued the mandate associated with its \n11  ruling. \n12  7.  Notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s decision and the Fourth Circuit’s mandate, \n13  DHS did not return to the status quo ante and restore the DACA program on its original terms.  \n14  Instead of complying with its legal obligations under the Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit \n15  decisions, it “generally held” initial DACA applications starting June 18, 2020, and requests for \n16  advance parole starting July 24, 2020, both “in anticipation of potential policy changes” to the \n17  program.  DHS has represented that it continued to process and grant DACA renewal requests during \n18  this period. \n19  8.  The anticipated policy changes came July 28, 2020, when Defendant Chad Wolf—the \n20  purported Acting Secretary of Homeland Security—issued without authority a memorandum (the \n21  “Wolf Memorandum”) directing DHS to make immediate “interim” changes to DACA while he \n22  considered whether to fully rescind the program.  The Wolf Memorandum orders DHS to reject all \n23  new initial DACA applications, to reject all advance parole applications absent exceptional \n24  circumstances, and to reduce the renewal period for current DACA recipients from two years to one \n25  year.  The Wolf Memorandum unlawfully applies these changes retroactively to all applications \n26  submitted after the Supreme Court’s June 18, 2020 decision.   \n27  9.  Defendant Joseph Edlow, in his purported capacity as Deputy Director of Policy of \n28  Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), issued a policy directive \n \n  3 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 4 of 40\n1  purporting to implement the Wolf Memorandum (the “Edlow Directive”) and instructing USCIS \n2  staff to reject DACA renewal requests received more than 150 days prior to the expiration of the \n3  DACA recipients’ current renewal period. \n4  10.  Defendants’ latest actions to diminish or rescind core components of the DACA \n5  program are unlawful and must be set aside, for multiple independent reasons.   \n6  11.  Because Defendant Wolf was, and continues to be, improperly serving in the role of \n7  Acting Secretary of Homeland Security in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 \n8  (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3341 et seq., and the Homeland Security Act of 2002, 6 U.S.C. § 111 et seq. \n9  (“HSA”), he lacked the authority to direct changes to the DACA program or to appoint Defendant \n10  Edlow as Deputy Director of Policy of Defendant USCIS.  Accordingly, the Wolf Memorandum and \n11  the Edlow Directive are void and must be set aside as unlawful under the FVRA and HSA, and as in \n12  excess of statutory authority under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n13  § 702(2)(A).  Moreover, even if Defendant Wolf had been lawfully serving under the FVRA and \n14  HSA, both his unreasonably long tenure as Acting Secretary and his appointment by another inferior \n15  officer violate the Appointments Clause, and the actions he has taken in that role are unlawful.   \n16  12.  In addition, the Wolf Memorandum and the Edlow Directive constitute arbitrary and \n17  capricious decision making under the APA.  They make immediate, interim changes to DACA based \n18  on policy justifications that are not supported by evidence and that are, in any event, untethered to \n19  the interim actions taken.  And they are based on a concededly incomplete consideration of the \n20  relevant factors, including the reliance interests engendered by the program and the harms or legality \n21  of applying any interim changes retroactively.  \n22  13.  For these reasons, Plaintiffs ask this Court to declare the Wolf Memorandum and \n23  Edlow Directive unlawful and unenforceable, and to enjoin and restrain Defendants from taking \n24  further steps to modify the DACA program pursuant to those unlawful actions.  The DACA program \n25  has worked to the benefit of DACA recipients, their families, their employers, local communities, \n26  and American society as a whole.  These stakeholders deserve, and the law demands, better.  \n27  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n28  14.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1361, and 2201–02,  \n \n  4 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 5 of 40\n1  because this action arises under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. art. \n2  II, § 2, cl. 2; the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq.; the Federal Vacancies \n3  Reform Act of 1998, 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq.; and the Homeland Security Act of 2002, 6 U.S.C. \n4  §§ 112–13.  This Court has additional remedial authority under the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06.  \n5  15.  There exists an actual and justiciable controversy between Plaintiffs and Defendants \n6  requiring resolution by this Court.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. \n7  16.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California.  Plaintiff County of Santa Clara \n8  is a public entity in this judicial district and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \n9  this action have occurred or will occur in this District.  28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2), 1391(e)(1).  \n10  Plaintiff Local 521 is located in the Northern District of California and many of its members, on \n11  whose behalf it brings this lawsuit, reside and are employed within the Northern District of \n12  California.  This is a civil action in which Defendants are agencies of the United States or officers \n13  thereof and no real property is involved in this action. \n14  PARTIES \n15  17.  Plaintiff County of Santa Clara is a charter county organized and existing under the \n16  laws of the State of California.  With an estimated population of more than 1.9 million people, Santa \n17  Clara County is the largest county in the Bay Area and the sixth largest county in California.  As a \n18  county of immigrants, the County has especially benefited from DACA and is especially harmed by \n19  the “interim” changes to the program.  Thirty-eight percent of Santa Clara County residents are \n20  foreign born, and approximately sixty percent of children in the County have at least one parent who \n21  is foreign born.  Santa Clara County has the highest percentage of foreign-born residents of all \n22  counties in California.  More than half of County residents speak a language other than English at \n23  home, and more than 100 languages and dialects are spoken within the County. \n24  18.  The County is the level of government tasked with provision of core safety-net \n25  services to this diverse community.  It employs a workforce of more than 23,000 and must ensure \n26  that this workforce possesses the skills necessary to effectively serve this community.  The County \n27  employs DACA recipients in key positions throughout the organization, providing upward mobility \n28  to young people who deserve the opportunity to serve their communities through the public sector, \n \n  5 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 6 of 40\n1  and leveraging the unique experience and skills these employees bring to the County government. \n2  19.  Plaintiff Service Employees International Union Local 521 is a labor union that \n3  represents approximately 40,000 public- and private-sector workers in the Bay Area and California’s \n4  Central Valley, including more than 11,000 who are employed by the County of Santa Clara.  Local \n5  521 is an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”), which represents 2.2 \n6  million working men and women around the world.  A large percentage of Local 521’s membership \n7  is Latino and many are first-generation immigrants.  The primary mission of Local 521 is to \n8  organize, represent, and empower employees. \n9  20.  In addition, Local 521 works in partnership with SEIU and other groups to combat \n10  discrimination and mobilize for immigration reform at the national level.  Local 521’s efforts include \n11  its Committee on Comprehensive Immigration Reform, a member-based committee that engages in \n12  organizing, advocacy, and education to help undocumented workers.  Local 521 has conducted \n13  “know your rights” information sessions and workshops, engaged in legislative advocacy on \n14  immigration-related bills at the state level, held community forums on DACA and Deferred Action \n15  for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents in conjunction with the California \n16  Attorney General, and participated as an amicus in litigation brought by the County of Santa Clara \n17  and others challenging the Trump administration’s threat to cut off federal funding to sanctuary \n18  cities and counties.  Local 521 has members who are DACA recipients, including members who \n19  work for the County of Santa Clara.  These members are able to work and, thus, to be Local 521 \n20  members, because of the work authorization they obtain through the DACA program.  These \n21  members would be unable to work should their deferred action and work authorization lapse due to \n22  the shortened renewal period.  In addition, Local 521 members have children, siblings, and other \n23  relatives who would have been eligible to apply for DACA between the time that Defendants \n24  terminated accepting DACA applications in September 2017 and the present, and who would have \n25  applied for DACA or would now apply for DACA but for Defendants’ unlawful actions. \n26  21.  Local 521 brings this action as an associational plaintiff on behalf of its members who \n27  are DACA recipients, asserting claims on behalf of those members.  Local 521 also brings this \n28  lawsuit to protect the rights and interests of its members and prospective members, to preserve its \n \n  6 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 7 of 40\n1  ability to organize new members who are DACA recipients, and to preserve its representational \n2  relationship with current DACA recipients. \n3  22.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States.  President Trump \n4  made the decisions to rescind the DACA program and is sued in his official capacity. \n5  23.  Defendant Chad F. Wolf is the purported Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.  \n6  The Acting Secretary is responsible for managing DHS, and oversees the United States Citizenship \n7  and Immigration Service (“USCIS”) and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”).  The \n8  Acting Secretary’s responsibilities include the administration and enforcement of policies and \n9  practices related to immigration, including the DACA program.  Defendant Wolf is sued in his \n10  official capacity. \n11  24.   Defendant Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a federal agency \n12  responsible for implementing, administering, and enforcing the nation’s immigration laws and \n13  policies, including the DACA program.  DHS is a Department of the Executive Branch and is an \n14  agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1). \n15  25.  Defendant Joseph Edlow is serving as the Deputy Director of Policy of USCIS.  \n16  Defendant Wolf purported to appoint Defendant Edlow as Deputy Director of USCIS on February \n17  19, 2020, and addressed his July 28, 2020 Memorandum to Defendant Edlow, among others.  \n18  Defendant Edlow issued the challenged Edlow Directive in his purported capacity as USCIS Deputy \n19  Director of Policy.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n20  26.  Defendant USCIS is a component of DHS, 6 U.S.C. § 271, and an agency within the \n21  meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 551(1).  USCIS is the agency responsible for processing and adjudicating \n22  DACA applications. \n23  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n24  The DACA Program \n25  27.  On June 15, 2012, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a \n26  memorandum establishing the DACA program.  According to the memorandum, the purpose of the \n27  program was to appropriately allocate resources to individuals who were higher priorities for \n28  immigration enforcement.  In addition, the memorandum recognized that it made little sense to \n \n  7 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 8 of 40\n1  punish individuals who were brought to the United States as children, through no fault of their own,  \n2  and who had proven themselves to be trustworthy, contributing members of their communities.  \n3  Finally, DACA was intended to generate wide-reaching benefits that would accrue to recipients, \n4  their families, and their communities, as undocumented individuals would be permitted to live and \n5  work without the ever-present threat of deportation. \n6  28.  DACA allows people who were brought to the United States as children and who \n7  meet certain criteria to apply for temporary deferral of deportation (“deferred action”) and for work \n8  authorization.  According to USCIS, as of March 31, 2017, approximately 800,000 young people \n9  had been granted deferred action under DACA in the five years the program had been in place.  As \n10  of March 31, 2020, there were 639,850 current DACA recipients.  There are currently an estimated \n11  1,326,000 individuals who would be eligible to apply for DACA under the program’s original terms.  \n12  Of those, an estimated 56,000 individuals became eligible for DACA since Defendants’ unlawful \n13  rescission in 2017. \n14  29.  Under the DACA program’s original terms, applicants are eligible for deferred action \n15  under DACA only if they: (i) were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012; (ii) were brought to the \n16  United States before their 16th birthday; (iii) have continuously resided in the United States since \n17  June 15, 2007; (iv) were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time \n18  they made their DACA application; (v) did not have lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012; (vi) \n19  are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a GED, or were honorably discharged from the \n20  United States military or Coast Guard; and (vii) have not been convicted of a felony, significant \n21  misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not pose a threat to national security or public \n22  safety. \n23  30.  To apply for deferred action under DACA, applicants were required to pay a \n24  substantial fee of $495, submit a detailed application, and submit to a background check and any \n25  other screening that DHS deems necessary. \n26  31.  Pursuant to the program’s original terms, deferred action and related work \n27  authorizations were granted for two-year periods.  From the time DACA was first implemented, \n28  applicants were told that they would have the opportunity to apply for renewal of deferred action and \n \n  8 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 9 of 40\n1  were given detailed instructions for doing so.  In particular, recipients were instructed that they \n2  should apply for renewal approximately 120 days (but no more than 150 days) before the expiration \n3  of their two-year period.  Recipients were told that they would be eligible for renewal if they met the \n4  requirements for an initial DACA application and also: (i) had not departed the United States on or \n5  after June 15, 2007; (ii) had continuously resided in the United States since submission of their most \n6  recent DACA application; and (iii) had not in the interim been convicted of a disqualifying crime or \n7  otherwise posed a threat to national security or public safety.  The opportunity to renew is a crucial \n8  aspect of the DACA program.  There is little reason for eligible individuals to run the risk of \n9  identifying their immigration status for a temporary benefit, and there is little reason for employers \n10  such as the County to take the time and resources to hire and train DACA recipients who have \n11  received work authorization unless there is some assurance that those individuals will be eligible to \n12  renew that authorization. \n13  32.  Defendants solicited extensive information from applicants for DACA, including \n14  names, addresses, birthdates, country of origin, and educational and criminal history.  By issuing an \n15  open invitation to apply for DACA, the government asked undocumented immigrants to take a leap \n16  of faith and identify themselves and, indirectly, their families to the federal government and \n17  acknowledge their undocumented status.  To assuage fears about disclosing this and other sensitive \n18  information, Defendants expressly promised that the information provided by DACA applicants \n19  would not be used against them or their families for immigration enforcement purposes, except in \n20  narrow, specified circumstances that would not normally apply to individuals eligible for DACA.   \n21  33.  The DACA program has been tremendously successful, creating much-needed \n22  stability for DACA recipients, their families, and their communities, and resulting in extensive \n23  benefits to all of these groups.  Under DACA, law-abiding, long-term U.S. residents who lack legal \n24  immigration status have access to better jobs and improved working conditions.  Because \n25  undocumented immigrants who lack work authorization must seek jobs that minimize their risk of \n26  being identified and deported, they often do not work in jobs that best fit their education, skills, and \n27  abilities, or those that would maximize their earning potential.  See Patrick Oakford, Center for \n28  American Progress, Administrative Action on Immigration Reform, The Fiscal Benefits of \n \n  9 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 10 of 40\n1  Temporary Work Permits, at 6 (September 2014), available at https://tinyurl.com/y24q7msf (last \n2  visited Nov. 2, 2020).  Making workers eligible to apply for deferred action and work permits allows \n3  them greater occupational mobility, enabling them to seek out a wider range of potential career \n4  opportunities.  Moreover, “[t]he interaction between our broken immigration system and \n5  employment and labor laws have made undocumented workers more susceptible to exploitation in \n6  the workplace, leading them to earn lower wages than they otherwise could.”  Id. at 5.  Eliminating \n7  the fear of retaliatory reporting of immigration violations and potential deportation allows these \n8  workers to better protect their own workplace rights and those of their co-workers, leading to higher \n9  real wages and fewer violations of employment and labor laws and regulations. \n10  34.  Those who have received deferred action under DACA and related work \n11  authorization enjoy increased earning potential, producing a positive multiplier effect on local \n12  economies.  Fiscal Policy Institute, President’s Immigration Action Expected to Benefit Economy \n13  (Nov. 21, 2014), available at http://bit.ly/1FbnS7q (last visited Nov. 2, 2020) (estimating that wages \n14  for those eligible for work authorization will increase by five to 10 percent); Oakford, Administrative \n15  Action on Immigration Reform, The Fiscal Benefits of Temporary Work Permits, at 3 (“Temporary \n16  work permits would increase the earnings of undocumented immigrants by about 8.5 percent as they \n17  are able to work legally and find jobs that match their skills.”).  Indeed, the upward mobility \n18  afforded by DACA is apparent from the results of a national survey of 1,402 young adults who were \n19  approved for DACA through June 2013: \n20  Since receiving DACA, young adult immigrants have become more integrated \ninto the nation’s economic institutions.  Approximately 61% of DACA recipients \n21 \nsurveyed have obtained a new job since receiving DACA.  Meanwhile, over half \nhave opened their first bank account, and 38% have obtained their first credit \n22 \ncard. \n \n23 \nRoberto G. Gonzales and Veronica Terriquez, American Immigration Council, How DACA is \n24 \nImpacting the Lives of Those who are now DACAmented: Preliminary Findings from the National \n25 \nUnDACAmented Research Project (Aug. 15, 2013), available at https://tinyurl.com/yykybgnx (last \n26 \nvisited Nov. 2, 2020).  In short, DACA created significant economic benefits for qualifying \n27 \nindividuals and for the nation at large by permitting greater levels of contribution to the workforce \n28 \n \n  10 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 11 of 40\n1  by educated individuals who previously had limited employment opportunities. \n2  The County’s Employment Relationship with DACA Recipients \n3  35.  The County is one of the largest employers in the region, with more than 23,000 \n4  employees performing a vast array of functions to meet the needs of this diverse community.  One of \n5  the main ways in which the County has benefited from the DACA program is through its \n6  employment relationships with DACA recipients.  In particular, the County currently employs \n7  DACA recipients as full-time employees.  The County has expended significant resources, both time \n8  and money, in recruiting, hiring, and training these employees and relies on them to provide County \n9  services.  Because DACA recipients are under no obligation to identify themselves as such when \n10  they apply for a job, and they present the same form of work authorization card as other categories \n11  of immigrants, the County cannot determine with certainty the total number of DACA recipients it \n12  employs. \n13  36.  As one example, DACA recipients are employed through the County’s In-Home \n14  Supportive Services (“IHSS”) program, which provides in-home care in the form of assistance with \n15  activities of daily living, to eligible aged, blind, and disabled individuals who would otherwise be \n16  unable to remain safely in their own homes.  The County’s IHSS program is funded through a \n17  combination of federal, state, and county funds, and provides services to over 22,000 IHSS \n18  beneficiaries in Santa Clara County.   \n19  37.  The County also currently employs at least three DACA recipients who are alumni of \n20  the County’s New Americans Fellowship Program.  This program provides a summer career \n21  development opportunity for DACA recipients in order to develop valuable professional skills and \n22  serve as ambassadors to the County of Santa Clara community.  The program is also intended to \n23  introduce DACA recipients to various aspects of local government work, and to provide \n24  opportunities for participants to gain the experience and skills necessary to ultimately work for local \n25  governments like the County.  Fellows receive a stipend and commit to working at least 20 hours per \n26  week, for a period of no less than 10 weeks, on a project-based fellowship under the supervision of a \n27  County Department, the County Office of Immigrant Relations, or a Member of the Board of \n28  Supervisors’ Office.  The fellowship culminates in a final research project and presentation.  \n \n  11 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 12 of 40\n1  Examples of the types of projects on which fellows work include improving the relationships \n2  between law enforcement and the immigrant community, and launching a countywide campaign to \n3  promote financial literacy among immigrants and refugees. \n4  38.  The County began the New Americans Fellowship Program in July 2017.  The \n5  County has hosted 49 fellows over the past four summers.  Fourteen DACA recipients participated in \n6  the fourth annual New Americans Fellowship Program, which began in June 2020.  Final research \n7  projects for the 2020 Program included “Immigrant Students’ Access to K-12 Education During \n8  COVID-19,” “COVID-19 Impacts on Immigrant Community,” and “Culturally Competent Services \n9  Provided to Immigrant Clients in Pre-Trial Process.”  Three Program alumni who currently work for \n10  the County assisted with the 2020 Program by, for example, hosting fellows at their County \n11  Department sites and/or co-hosting workshops and events for the fellows. \n12  39.  DACA recipients have special skills that make them especially valuable employees of \n13  the County.  For example, over ninety-five percent of DACA recipients are bilingual.  The County \n14  values this skill because it must employ a workforce that is able to meet residents’ language needs to \n15  ensure meaningful access to County services, programs, and benefits.  See County of Santa Clara, \n16  Board Policy 3.58.  Indeed, forty-five percent of clients currently receiving health, financial, or \n17  employment assistance through the County Department of Employment and Benefit Services speak a \n18  primary language other than English.  Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, a public hospital owned \n19  and operated by the County, is required by law to provide qualified interpreters to limited-English- \n20  proficient individuals and relies on medical interpreters to satisfy that requirement.  It frequently \n21  takes months to fill interpreter vacancies for the County’s hospital and clinics, and the County has \n22  had difficulty filling several open positions.  For example, it recently took Language Services for the \n23  Santa Clara Health System ten months to complete the hiring process for a qualified interpreter. \n24  40.  If the DACA recipients currently employed by the County were to lose their work \n25  authorization, these valued employees would be unable to work for the County or, indeed, to work in \n26  any legal capacity for any employer, public or private, within Santa Clara County or the United \n27  States.  The County would be forced to expend significant resources to temporarily cover those \n28  employees’ responsibilities, conduct searches for replacements, and train new employees.  On \n \n  12 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 13 of 40\n1  average, it takes the County nearly three months to fill a vacancy.  Nearly all County employees, \n2  including Local 521 members, are covered by merit system rules and collective bargaining \n3  agreements that protect them against arbitrary dismissal and other adverse employment actions, and \n4  that include anti-discrimination provisions.  Despite these protections, County employment is \n5  contingent on valid work authorization.   \n6  Reliance on the DACA Program and the Federal Government’s Representations \n7  41.  Trusting the federal government’s representations about the program, hundreds of \n8  thousands of young people from across the country have applied for and received deferred action \n9  under DACA since the program was initiated in 2012.  The DACA program has changed the lives of \n10  DACA recipients.  Prior to DACA, many law-abiding undocumented young people saw little \n11  purpose to completing higher education because they would be unable to work legally upon \n12  graduation.  DACA gave them the ability to attend college, work to earn money to pay for higher \n13  education, and to utilize their degrees to attain high-skilled and higher-paid jobs.  It also gave them \n14  access to health care, medical benefits, credit, and the opportunity to become more integrated into \n15  their communities.  DACA gave these young people hope that a better life was possible, and allowed \n16  them to emerge from the shadows of society to serve their communities, including through work for \n17  government agencies like the County of Santa Clara. \n18  42.  Loss of DACA and work authorization would be devastating for County workers who \n19  depend on the DACA program to maintain employment, health insurance, and other benefits.  \n20  Indeed, several County employees who are DACA recipients desired to join as individual plaintiffs \n21  in this litigation, but ultimately chose not to come forward out of fear that Defendants would \n22  retaliate against them or their families. \n23  43.  Shortening the renewal period from two years to one year will also result in a \n24  significant reduction in the number of DACA recipients who are able to renew and thus maintain \n25  both deferred action and work authorization.  As detailed in a recent survey of 1,760 DACA \n26  recipients conducted by the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration and \n27  TheDream.US, 62% of current DACA recipients surveyed responded that a one-year grant period \n28  would constitute “a substantial barrier” to renewal.  Lora Adams et al., Discouraging and Denying \n \n  13 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 14 of 40\n1  Renewals, THEDREAM.US, PRESIDENTS’ ALLIANCE ON HIGHER EDUCATION AND IMMIGRATION (Sept. \n2  29, 2020) at 4.  Survey respondents cited as one barrier the increased legal fees and application fees \n3  associated with filing for renewal twice as often.  Id. at 4–5.  Administrative backlog may also \n4  interfere with DACA recipients’ ability to timely renew.  For example, the survey found that eleven \n5  percent of respondents received approval for their DACA renewal more than 150 days after they \n6  applied.  Id. at 5.  And USCIS currently estimates processing times for DACA applications and \n7  renewals to range from eight to eleven months at certain service centers.  Id.  But DACA recipients \n8  cannot try to avoid a lapse in work authorization by applying even earlier because the Edlow \n9  Directive requires DHS staff to “generally reject DACA renewal requests received more than 150 \n10  days prior to the expiration of the DACA recipient’s current DACA validity period.”  This Catch-22 \n11  means that many DACA recipients may regularly experience lapses even if they timely apply, \n12  leading to at least a temporary a loss of work authorization.   \n13  44.  The County has also relied on the government’s representations concerning the \n14  DACA program.  The County has expended significant time and financial resources in recruiting, \n15  hiring, and training DACA recipients for various positions in County.  Those employees carry out \n16  important functions in County government and make significant contributions in providing services \n17  to County residents.  Shortening the renewal period under DACA from two years to one year will \n18  harm the County in at least four ways.   \n19  45.  First, halving the work authorization period to one year threatens the significant \n20  investments in recruiting, hiring, and training of DACA recipients that the County have made.  And \n21  unfortunately, employers like the County have less incentive to take the time and effort to train \n22  employees with shorter-term work authorizations, particularly if there is a possibility that some of \n23  those authorizations may lapse despite employees’ best efforts to timely renew.   \n24  46.  Second, the shorter renewal period also imposes additional administrative burdens on \n25  the Employee Benefits Department of the Santa Clara County Services Agency.  The Employee \n26  Benefits Department verifies employee I-9 Forms and work authorizations, tracks the expiration \n27  dates of all employees’ work authorizations, and follows up with employees to ensure the County \n28  has active work authorizations on file.  Shortening the renewal period for DACA means that the \n \n  14 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 15 of 40\n1  Employee Benefits Department will have to more frequently follow up with employees regarding \n2  expiring work authorizations and more frequently process and verify I-9 Forms and update the \n3  corresponding employee files.   \n4  47.  Third, because the halved renewal period will likely result in more lapses in deferred \n5  action under DACA and loss of work authorizations, the Employee Benefits Department will need to \n6  process more termination paperwork when former DACA recipients separate from the County and, \n7  in turn, more new-hire paperwork when those employees are eventually replaced.   \n8  48.  Fourth, County Agencies and Departments may also incur the administrative burden \n9  of terminating the employment of individuals whose work authorizations expire and in turn expend \n10  resources in recruiting, hiring, and training their replacements. \n11  Other Benefits to the County from the DACA Program \n12  49.  Santa Clara County is home to Silicon Valley, where many of the country’s leading \n13  high-tech and Internet-based companies are located.  Technology companies based in the County, \n14  including Apple and Google, employ tens of thousands of workers.  Similarly, health care providers, \n15  including Kaiser Permanente, Stanford Hospital and Clinics, and the County’s own hospitals and \n16  clinics, employ additional tens of thousands.  Many of these organizations employ DACA recipients. \n17  For example, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, noted in 2017 that 250 Apple employees are “Dreamers,” or \n18  DACA recipients.  In 2019, Mr. Cook announced that that number had increased to 443 DACA \n19  recipients.  Silicon Valley has long been reliant on the contributions of immigrants.  One study noted \n20  that immigrants launched a quarter of all engineering and technology companies in the United States \n21  from 1995 to 2005, Vivek Wadhwa et al., America’s New Immigrant Entrepreneurs: Part I, Duke \n22  Science, Tech. & Innovation Paper No. 23 (Jan. 4, 2007), available at  \n23  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=990152## (last visited Nov. 2, 2020), and over \n24  half of Silicon Valley start-ups in the same period count at least one immigrant as a key founder, \n25  Richard T. Herman, IMMIGRANT, INC.: WHY IMMIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS ARE DRIVING THE NEW \n26  ECONOMY (AND HOW THEY WILL SAVE THE AMERICAN WORKER) 5 (2009). \n27  50.  In 2016, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimated that there were 23,000 \n28  DACA-eligible individuals in Santa Clara County, including 15,000 who were immediately eligible. \n \n  15 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 16 of 40\n1  MPI, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Data Tools, available at \n2  http://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca-profiles \n3  (last visited Nov. 2, 2020).  According to MPI’s estimates, Santa Clara County has the twelfth \n4  largest DACA-eligible population among counties nationwide, and the largest DACA-eligible \n5  population of all northern California counties.  MPI, National and County Estimates of Populations \n6  Eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, 2016, available at: \n7  http://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/datahub/State-County-DACA-Estimates.xlsx (last \n8  visited Nov. 2, 2020). \n9  51.  In September 2017, ninety-one percent of DACA recipients were employed.  John W. \n10  Schoen, DACA Deportations Could Cost US Economy More than $400 Billion, CNBC.com (Sept. 5, \n11  2017), available at https://tinyurl.com/y7xnpfpg (last visited Nov. 2, 2020).  It is estimated that if \n12  DACA recipients lose the ability to work legally, California alone would suffer a GDP loss of \n13  approximately $11.3 billion a year.  Id.  As one of the counties with the largest number of DACA \n14  recipients, much of this negative economic effect will be felt in Santa Clara County. \n15  52.  Moreover, because they are able to work legally, DACA recipients are employed in \n16  more highly compensated jobs and contribute more in state and local taxes than they would without \n17  DACA.  One 2017 study estimated that the 1.3 million young people immediately eligible for \n18  DACA contribute $2 billion a year in state and local taxes.  Institute on Taxation and Economic \n19  Policy, State & Local Tax Contributions of Young Undocumented Immigrants (Apr. 25, 2017), \n20  available at https://tinyurl.com/y7ohqagb (last visited Nov. 2, 2020).  Indeed, “DACA-eligible \n21  individuals pay on average 8.9 percent of their income in state and local taxes.  Their effective tax \n22  rate is higher than the average rate paid by the top 1% of taxpayers in state and local taxes . . . .”  Id.  \n23  “Repealing the temporary legal status and work authorizations permitted by DACA would reduce \n24  estimated state and local revenues by nearly $800 million . . . .”  Id.  The same study estimated that \n25  DACA eligible individuals contribute more than $530 million in state and local taxes in California \n26  alone and, because Santa Clara County has a large number of DACA-eligible residents, the County \n27  stands to lose significant tax revenue because of the “interim” modifications to DACA. \n28  53.  In addition to its broad negative effects on the County’s economy and fisc, the \n \n  16 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 17 of 40\n1  “interim” modifications to DACA will make it more difficult and expensive for the County to \n2  provide services to its residents.  It is all the more critical that the County be able to provide key \n3  services, such as health care and public health services, to all residents during the current COVID-19 \n4  pandemic.  For example, DACA recipients who do not have employer-sponsored insurance and who \n5  satisfy income-eligibility requirements qualify for “full-scope” coverage under Medi-Cal, \n6  California’s Medicaid program.  Through Medi-Cal, DACA recipients receive coverage for a core \n7  set of health benefits, including preventative care, doctor’s visits, immunizations, prescriptions, and \n8  mental health and substance abuse services.  If these individuals lose deferred action, many of them \n9  will be eligible only for very limited Medi-Cal coverage of emergency and pregnancy-related \n10  services, increasing their reliance on other safety-net health care services provided by the County. \n11  54.  The County operates the County of Santa Clara Health System, which is the only \n12  public safety-net health care provider in Santa Clara County and the second largest such provider in \n13  the State of California.  The Health System includes, among other things, the Santa Clara Valley \n14  Medical Center (“SCVMC”), a Level I trauma hospital; O’Connor Hospital; St. Louise Hospital; and \n15  a network of clinics—all of which provide critical health care services to poor and uninsured County \n16  residents.  Payments from these patients and from public insurance programs such as Medi-Cal do \n17  not cover the costs of services they receive through the County Health System.  As a result, each \n18  year the County provides a substantial subsidy to cover deficits incurred in serving the Health \n19  System’s patients.  During the first three quarters of Fiscal Year 2017, SCVMC operated at a deficit \n20  of well over $90 million.  During Fiscal Year 2020, the Health System required over $198 million in \n21  County General Fund subsidy to maintain operations for that year.  Restriction of the DACA \n22  program will negatively affect the County Health System, and likely increase its operational deficit.  \n23  Because DACA recipients who are now employed pursuant to work authorization granted under the \n24  program may lose their work authorization and their jobs as well as their employer-sponsored health \n25  insurance, former DACA recipients, and family members who were covered by the recipient’s \n26  insurance, are more likely to fall back on safety-net providers like the Health System.  Additionally, \n27  lacking employer-sponsored health insurance, potentially unable to access full-scope Medi-Cal, and \n28  burdened with a fear of detention and deportation, these individuals are less likely to obtain regular \n \n  17 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 18 of 40\n1  check-ups and routine, preventative care.  As a result, they will be more likely to seek medical care \n2  only when health problems worsen—often at the Health System’s Emergency Departments—at \n3  which point care becomes more difficult and more expensive.  Gutting key components of the \n4  DACA program—such as accepting new applications and granting a two-year renewal period—will \n5  increase the County’s costs in subsidizing free and below-cost care through its Health System. \n6  55.  In addition to health care, the County provides (and is often required to provide) \n7  many other services to community members regardless of immigration status, and it will become \n8  more difficult to provide these services to DACA recipients if they lose deferred action because of \n9  their renewed hesitancy to interact with the government for fear of detention and deportation.  At the \n10  same time, it will be even more critical for individuals who lose DACA to access County services—\n11  and the County will need to spend more to support them—because the same individuals will be \n12  losing work authorization and, thus, the ability to work legally to support themselves and their \n13  families. \n14  56.  For example, the County invests significant resources in programs to provide housing \n15  to the homeless and to prevent homelessness.  In Fiscal Year 2015, the County allocated over $73.8 \n16  million in resources to housing and related services countywide and, in 2015, the Board of \n17  Supervisors approved increasing these expenditures by a total of $33.9 million over Fiscal Years \n18  2016–2018.  For Fiscal Year 2021, the County allocated to housing and related services $316.4 \n19  million, including $116.2 million from an affordable housing bond.  In addition to providing housing \n20  to homeless individuals and families who utilize other County services, the County also funds \n21  homelessness prevention and emergency housing programs, including homeless shelters, a cold \n22  weather shelter program, interim housing for the chronically homeless, and 24-hour care shelter \n23  placements.  DACA recipients are less likely to rely on these County and/or other services because \n24  they can work legally and provide for their families.  If DACA recipients are no longer able to work \n25  legally, they may be more likely to rely on County and/or other services.  And individuals who \n26  would have been eligible to apply for DACA and receive work authorization but for the Wolf \n27  Memorandum’s “interim” modifications likewise may more be more likely to rely on these services. \n28  57.  The DACA program also reduces reliance on the County’s safety-net services by \n \n  18 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 19 of 40\n1  keeping families together.  Twenty-five percent of DACA recipients have at least one U.S.-born \n2  child.  Dara Lind, 9 facts that explain DACA, the immigration program Trump is threatening to end, \n3  Vox.com (Sept. 5, 2017), available at https://tinyurl.com/y8eweo2h (last visited Nov. 2, 2020).  If \n4  these parents are subject to deportation without DACA, some of their U.S. citizen children may enter \n5  the foster care system.  The County provides financial support to foster parents to meet the basic \n6  needs of foster youth placed in their care.  In the 2017 Fiscal Year, the County invested $25 million \n7  in foster care youth, and the Wolf Memorandum’s limitations on the DACA program could bring \n8  more young people into the system, increasing costs and placing greater strains on County resources. \n9  58.  Modifying key components of the DACA program, even on an “interim” basis, would \n10  also hinder the County’s ability to protect the public health and the safety of its residents.  The \n11  County’s Public Health Department (“PHD”) runs numerous programs that protect the health not \n12  only of the individual served, but of the wider community.  PHD provides immunization clinics, \n13  tuberculosis testing, STD testing, COVID-19 testing, and other services that prevent the spread of \n14  communicable diseases.  DACA has improved PHD’s ability to provide these critical services to \n15  immigrant communities by alleviating the fear of deportation that often prevents undocumented \n16  immigrants from seeking government services.   \n17  59.  Trust between immigrant communities and public health officials is especially critical \n18  during the current COVID-19 pandemic.  Crowded and multi-generation housing, employment as \n19  essential workers, and hesitancy to seek government services can contribute to high rates of COVID-\n20  19 transmission among immigrant communities in the County.  PHD has partnered with numerous \n21  community organizations in the County to build trust with immigrant populations and ensure access \n22  to COVID-19 testing and other critical services during the pandemic.  For example, contact tracing \n23  is a key public health program that helps slow the spread of infectious disease like COVID-19.  PHD \n24  workers and other government employees serving as contact tracers will interview someone who \n25  tests positive for COVID-19 in order to determine who they have recently been in contact with and \n26  notify those contacts that they may have been exposed, should get tested for COVID-19, and then \n27  isolate themselves for a period of time.  Contact tracers must gain the trust of whomever they \n28  interview because they may ask for personal information like name, age, address, contact \n \n  19 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 20 of 40\n1  information, places the person recently visited, and people the person recently spent time with.  \n2  Because participation in contact tracing efforts is voluntary, it is imperative that immigrant \n3  communities trust the public health workers, including those from PHD. \n4  60.  If DACA recipients lose deferred action, they—and their U.S. citizen children—may \n5  be less likely to receive necessary immunizations and testing or participate in key public health \n6  measures, such as contact tracing, during the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby increasing health risks \n7  for the community as a whole.  And individuals who would have been eligible to apply for DACA \n8  but for the Wolf Memorandum’s unlawful “interim” modifications likewise may be less likely to risk \n9  revealing their lack of immigration status and receive necessary services from PHD. \n10  61.  For similar reasons, DACA has had a positive effect on the relationship between \n11  immigrant communities and local law enforcement.  Because of a justified fear of detention and \n12  deportation, undocumented individuals are often hesitant to contact law enforcement even when they \n13  are victims of crimes.  By providing an assurance that they are protected from immigration \n14  enforcement actions, DACA has permitted recipients to be more willing to report crimes, act as \n15  witnesses, and otherwise cooperate with local law enforcement, as well as with other emergency \n16  services and first responders.  This improved relationship is invaluable not just to DACA recipients \n17  themselves, but also to their communities and the County \n18  62.  DACA has had a similar effect on the County’s Code Enforcement Division, which \n19  enforces zoning and building ordinances to ensure safe living conditions for Santa Clara County \n20  residents.  The County has received reports that some tenants are reluctant to come forward with \n21  reports of code violations because landlords have threatened to report immigrants to ICE.  DACA \n22  substantially reduces that threat, thereby helping the County ensure that unsafe or unsanitary housing \n23  conditions are abated for the safety and benefit of the entire community. \n24  63.  DACA’s benefits to the County are also evidenced by the County’s willingness to \n25  invest in DACA recipients.   \n26  64.  The County has allocated on an annual basis at least $200,000 to the New Americans \n27  Fellowship Program, described above.   \n28  65.  In addition, in Fiscal Year 2017, the County allocated $200,000 for outreach and \n \n  20 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 21 of 40\n1  education concerning the DACA program, to ensure that eligible County residents know of and have \n2  support necessary to apply for DACA.  In Fiscal Year 2019, the County allocated another $200,000 \n3  to five agencies that specifically provide DACA-related services.   \n4  66.  The County has invested in DACA recipients beyond these annual allocations.  For \n5  example, just after Defendants announced that DACA would be rescinded in 2017, the County \n6  allocated an additional $200,000 from its emergency reserve to establish an emergency program to \n7  help DACA recipients submit renewal applications before the Administration’s arbitrary October 5, \n8  2017 deadline.  Using these funds, a total of 453 DACA recipients received scholarship grants in \n9  order to pay their renewal application fees.  The County has continued this financial support for \n10  renewal applications, executing in 2019 a $200,000 grant agreement with the Santa Clara County \n11  DACA Collaborative to administer funding for DACA scholarships to pay for renewal application \n12  fees.  Between January and May 2020, this County funding supported 405 scholarships to pay the \n13  $495 renewal application fee for 405 low-income DACA recipients, including some who lost their \n14  employment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In Fiscal Year 2020, County funding also \n15  supported the provision of free legal services for 916 DACA recipients who were able to apply for \n16  and receive DACA renewal.  With renewals occurring each year instead of every two, demand for \n17  these types of assistance will only increase.   \n18  67.  In light of the many ways that the County has benefited from the DACA program, on \n19  August 15, 2017, the County’s Board of Supervisors unanimously adopted a resolution affirming its \n20  support for the DACA program and its commitment to immigrant youth and young adults. \n21  The Administration’s 2017 Attempt to Rescind the DACA Program \n22  68.  On September 5, 2017—more than five years after DHS encouraged individuals to \n23  come out of the shadows and apply for DACA, and despite the program’s success—then-Acting \n24  Secretary Elaine Duke issued a memorandum formally rescinding DACA (“Duke Memorandum”).  \n25  The Duke Memorandum stated that DHS would not consider any initial DACA applications received \n26  after September 5, 2017.  As for then-current DACA recipients, the Duke Memorandum stated that \n27  DHS would adjudicate pending renewal requests properly filed and accepted by DHS as of \n28  September 5, 2017, and renewal requests properly filed and accepted by DHS by October 5, 2017 \n \n  21 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 22 of 40\n1  from individuals whose DACA benefits would expire between September 5, 2017 and March 5, \n2  2018.  All other DACA renewal requests, including any requests received after October 5, 2017, \n3  would be rejected. \n4  69.  Former Acting Secretary Duke’s memorandum did not explain the Administration’s \n5  reasons for departing from prior agency statements regarding the DACA program and rescinding the \n6  program.  In its single explanatory paragraph, the Duke Memorandum gave no indication that DHS \n7  had considered the benefits of the program, or the reliance interests of DACA recipients, their \n8  families, communities, or employers, before abruptly ending it.  Rather, it simply referred to the \n9  then-Attorney General’s conclusion that the DACA program was unlawful, explaining that the Fifth \n10  Circuit had held different programs (Deferred Action for the Parents of Americans and Lawful \n11  Permanent Residents (“DAPA”) and an expansion of the DACA) to be unlawful, and that this \n12  decision had been affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court.  The Duke Memorandum cited a \n13  September 4, 2017 letter from the then-Attorney General, which provided no legal analysis \n14  whatsoever and simply concluded that “it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield \n15  similar results with respect to DACA.”  The Duke Memorandum also did not indicate that the Acting \n16  Secretary had given any consideration to measures that would have addressed the Attorney \n17  General’s legal concerns without completely rescinding the program. \n18  70.  Pursuant to the Duke Memorandum, the federal government announced that it would \n19  limit renewals for those DACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire before March 5, 2018, \n20  provided they applied for renewal by October 5, 2017.  DHS immediately stopped accepting all new \n21  applications under DACA. \n22  71.  In January 2018, this Court entered a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to \n23  continue processing renewal applications.  See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of \n24  Homeland Sec. (“Regents I”), 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2018).  The U.S. Court of Appeals \n25  for the Ninth Circuit affirmed this Court’s preliminary injunction in November 2018.  See Regents of \n26  the Univ. of Cal. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. (“Regents II”), 908 F.3d 476 (9th Cir. 2018).  The \n27  federal government petitioned for certiorari, and the Supreme Court granted that petition along with \n28  the federal government’s petitions for certiorari in parallel litigation in the U.S. District Court for the \n \n  22 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 23 of 40\n1  District of Columbia and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. \n2  72.  On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court held that the Duke Memorandum rescinding \n3  DACA was unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.  See Dep’t \n4  of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (“Regents III”), 140 S. Ct. 1891 (2020).  The \n5  Supreme Court concluded that the Duke Memorandum had failed to address the reliance interests of \n6  DACA recipients, their communities, and their employers, id. at 1915–16, and had failed to \n7  adequately consider or explain the decision to terminate the deferred action aspect of the DACA \n8  program rather than only the program’s work authorization and other benefits, id. at 1910–15.  The \n9  Supreme Court expressly affirmed in full the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia’s \n10  vacatur of the rescission of the DACA program.  Id. at 1916 & n.17 (affirming summary judgment \n11  ruling in NAACP v. Trump, 315 F. Supp. 3d 457 (D.D.C. 2018)); see also NAACP, 315 F. Supp. 3d \n12  at 473 (holding that DACA’s rescission was unlawful and must be set aside). \n13  73.  Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court denied the federal government’s pending \n14  petition for certiorari from a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruling, which likewise set \n15  aside the 2017 Duke Memorandum as arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  See Casa de Md. v. \n16  U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 924 F.3d 684, 706 (4th Cir. 2019), cert. denied 2020 WL 3492650 \n17  (Mem.) (U.S. June 29, 2020) (No. 18-1469). \n18  74.  On June 30, 2020, the Fourth Circuit issued the mandate associated with its ruling.  \n19  See Mandate, Casa de Md., 18-1521, ECF No. 71 (4th Cir. June 30, 2020).  The effect of this \n20  mandate was to vacate the 2017 Duke Memorandum rescinding DACA, to the extent it had not \n21  already been vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Regents III decision.  \n22  The Administration’s 2020 “Interim” Modifications to the DACA Program \n23  75.  Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Regents III, DHS was required to return to \n24  the status quo ante, restore the DACA program to its original terms, and resume processing \n25  applications including from those who had aged into eligibility for the program during the pendency \n26  of the unlawful Duke Memorandum.  DHS did not.  Instead, it unlawfully “generally held” initial \n27  DACA applications and requests for advance parole “in anticipation of potential policy changes.”  \n28  See Mem. from Chad F. Wolf, Acting Sec’y of Homeland Security, to Mark Morgan, Senior Official \n \n  23 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 24 of 40\n1  Performing the Duties of Comm’r, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, et al., Reconsideration of \n2  the June 15, 2012 Memorandum Entitled “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to \n3  Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children” (July 28, 2020) (“Wolf Memorandum”). \n4  76.  Those policy changes came approximately six weeks after the Regents III opinion.  \n5  The Wolf Memorandum, issued on July 28, 2020, announces that Defendant Wolf is “considering \n6  anew the DACA policy.”  Id. at 4.  The Wolf Memorandum “rescind[s] the Nielsen Memorandum \n7  and the Duke Memorandum, and mak[es] certain immediate changes to the DACA policy to mitigate \n8  [Defendant Wolf’s] enforcement policy concerns while [he] conduct[s] a full and careful \n9  consideration of the full rescission.”  Id.  The Wolf Memorandum directs DHS to make three \n10  “immediate changes”:  to reject all new initial applications, to reject all advance parole applications \n11  absent “exceptional circumstances,” and to halve the renewal period for current DACA recipients \n12  from two years to one year.  Id. at 7–8.  The Wolf Memorandum unlawfully applies these changes \n13  retroactively to all applications submitted after the Supreme Court’s June 18, 2020 Regents III \n14  decision.  Id. at 7. \n15  77.  As justification, the Wolf Memorandum alludes to “significant questions of law and \n16  legal policy,” but does not elaborate further on those questions of law.  Id. at 4.  Instead, Defendant \n17  Wolf focuses on several “serious policy concerns that may warrant [the DACA program’s] full \n18  rescission.”  Id.  He cites four enforcement policy concerns, none of which provides a reasoned basis \n19  for the “interim” modifications his Memorandum imposes.  First, Defendant Wolf states that the \n20  DACA program was intended as a temporary “stopgap measure” while Congress considered various \n21  proposals for the individuals covered by the program.  Id. at 4–5.  He hypothesizes that “rescinding \n22  DACA entirely may well create a more pressing need for Congress” to enact immigration reform.  \n23  Id.  Even assuming that using the DACA program as a political pawn to pressure another branch of \n24  government to enact immigration reform were a legitimate rationale, the Wolf Memorandum fails to \n25  explain how its “interim” measures may spur legislative action.  Second, he expresses general \n26  concerns about general policies of non-enforcement.  Id. at 5.  Third, and relatedly, he expresses \n27  concern that DHS may be sending “mixed messages” about the agency’s “intention to consistently \n28  enforce the immigration laws as Congress has written them.”  Id.  And fourth, he guesses that \n \n  24 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 25 of 40\n1  “rescinding the DACA policy”—which he concedes “would not apply to children who are sent or \n2  brought to this country today”—“may further DHS’s efforts to discourage illegal immigration \n3  involving children going forward.”  Id.  The Memorandum provides no indication that Defendant \n4  Wolf relied on any evidence demonstrating that the DACA program has had any impact on rates of \n5  migration of children and again provides no explanation of how its chosen policy changes, such as \n6  halving the renewal period, mitigates this policy concern.  \n7  78.  The Wolf Memorandum minimizes the reliance interests engendered by the DACA \n8  program.  It asserts, for example, that reliance interests are not “significantly affected” by halving \n9  the renewal period because this change could potentially lessen the impact should Defendant Wolf \n10  ultimately rescind DACA in full.  Id. at 6.  The Memorandum likewise dismisses the reliance \n11  interests of individuals who would be eligible to apply for deferred action under DACA but for the \n12  Memorandum’s prohibition on new applications.  The Memorandum says it “makes sense” to \n13  “continue” the “status quo for more than two years” of not processing new DACA applications, but \n14  completely ignores that this was the “status quo” only because of Defendants’ unlawful rescission in \n15  2017.  Under the Supreme Court’s Regents III decision, DHS was required to return to the status quo \n16  ante before the unlawful rescission and begin processing anew initial DACA applications.   \n17  79.  On August 21, 2020, Defendant Edlow, the purported Deputy Director of Policy of \n18  Defendant USCIS, issued a policy directive purporting to implement the Wolf Memorandum, \n19  instructing USCIS officials to take the actions directed by the Wolf Memorandum.  Mem. from \n20  Joseph Edlow, Deputy Dir. For Pol’y, to Assoc. Dirs. And Program Off. Chiefs, Implementing \n21  Acting Secretary Chad Wolf’s July 28, 2020 Memorandum, “Reconsideration of the June 15, 2012 \n22  Memorandum ‘Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the \n23  United States as Children’” (Aug. 21, 2020) (“Edlow Directive”).  In addition, the Edlow Directive \n24  directs USCIS staff to “generally reject DACA renewal requests received more than 150 days prior \n25  the expiration of the DACA recipient’s current DACA validity period.”  Id. at 3–4. \n26  The Unlawful Designation of Defendant Wolf as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and \n27  Defendant Edlow as Deputy Director of Policy of USCIS \n28  80.  At the time he issued the Wolf Memorandum, and continuing to this date, Defendant \n \n  25 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 26 of 40\n1  Wolf was unlawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and lacked authority to \n2  exercise the powers of the office of the Secretary.   \n3  81.  There has been no Senate-confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security since April 10, \n4  2019, when former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned.  Upon Nielsen’s resignation, then-Customs \n5  and Border Patrol (“CBP”) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan assumed the office of Acting \n6  Secretary.  His appointment contravened the order of succession previously designated by the \n7  Secretary under the Homeland Security Act.  Nonetheless, McAleenan purported to exercise the \n8  Acting Secretary’s powers, including, among other things, to amend the designated order of \n9  succession.  When McAleenan resigned on November 13, 2019, Defendant Wolf purported to take \n10  office as Acting Secretary of Homeland Secretary pursuant to McAleenan’s amendment to the \n11  succession order.   \n12  82.  Defendant Wolf’s tenure as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security is contrary to the \n13  Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq., the Homeland Security Act \n14  (“HSA”), 6 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., and the Appointments Clause, for three primary and independent \n15  reasons.  First, Defendant Wolf’s predecessor, McAleenan, was not the lawful successor to former \n16  Secretary Nielsen, and therefore lacked the authority to amend DHS’s order of succession and make \n17  Defendant Wolf next in line to serve as Acting Secretary.  Because McAleenan’s amendment to the \n18  order of succession was performed without lawful authority under the HSA or the FVRA, it had “no \n19  force and effect,” 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1), and also must be set aside as in excess of statutory \n20  authority, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  This means that Defendant Wolf’s accession to the role of Acting \n21  Secretary based on McAleenan’s amendment was likewise unlawful.  Second, because more than \n22  210 days had passed since former Secretary Nielsen’s resignation, the office of the Secretary was \n23  required to “remain vacant” until the President submitted a new nominee for Senate confirmation.  \n24  Id. §§ 3346, 3347(b)(1).  Third, beyond statutory requirements, Defendant Wolf’s unreasonably long \n25  service in the role of Acting Secretary and appointment to that role by another inferior officer \n26  violated the Appointments Clause.  As a result of each of these legal infirmities, Defendant Wolf \n27  lacked the authority to issue his Memorandum rescinding key components of the DACA program. \n28  // \n \n  26 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 27 of 40\n1  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act and the Homeland Security Act \n2  83.  Two federal statutes govern the order of succession for Acting Secretary of Homeland \n3  Security: the FVRA, 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq., and HSA, 6 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.   \n4  84.  In addition, both the HSA and the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution \n5  require the Secretary of Homeland Security to be appointed by the President with the advice and \n6  consent of the Senate.  See 6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(1); Fin. Oversight & Mgmt. Bd. for Puerto Rico v. \n7  Aurelius Inv., LLC, 140 S. Ct. 1649, 1657 (2020) (Heads of Departments are principal officers \n8  subject to the Appointments Clause). \n9  85.  Under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the President “shall \n10  nominate, and by and with Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Officers, of the \n11  United States.”  U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  Offices requiring Presidential appointment and Senate \n12  confirmation (“PAS offices”) wield critical power in the federal government.  The advice-and-\n13  consent requirement therefore represents a “significant structural safeguard[] of the constitutional \n14  scheme.”  Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 659 (1997). \n15  86.  The FVRA establishes a default framework for temporarily filling vacant PAS \n16  offices.  Under the FVRA, the “first assistant to the officer” of a vacant office becomes the acting \n17  official by default, 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)(1), unless the President appoints someone who already serves \n18  in a different Senate-confirmed position or authorizes an officer or employee of the relevant agency \n19  if they satisfy certain other conditions, id. §§ 3345(a)(2), (a)(3). \n20  87.  The FVRA framework is the “exclusive means” for authorizing acting officials \n21  unless, as relevant here, an agency-specific statute expressly designates the succession order or \n22  authorizes the President, a court, or head of an Executive department to designate the succession \n23  order.  Id. §§ 3347(a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(B). \n24  88.  The HSA is such an agency-specific statute because it establishes an order of \n25  succession for the position of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.  6 U.S.C. § 113(g).  Under 6 \n26  U.S.C. § 113(a)(1)(A), the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security is the “first assistant” to the \n27  Secretary for purposes of the FVRA and automatically assumes her office if it is vacant.  Under 6 \n28  U.S.C. § 113(g)(1), the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security \n \n  27 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 28 of 40\n1  assumes the office of Acting Secretary in the event neither the Secretary nor the Deputy Secretary is \n2  available to exercise the functions and duties of the Secretary. \n3  89.  The HSA authorizes the Secretary to designate a further order of succession in the \n4  event that neither the Secretary nor the Deputy Secretary nor the Under Secretary for Management is \n5  available to exercise the functions and duties of the Secretary.  Id. § 113(g)(2). \n6  90.  Regardless of the method by which an acting official assumes office, a vacant office \n7  may not be occupied by acting officials “for longer than 210 days beginning on the day the vacancy \n8  occurs.”  5 U.S.C. § 3346(a).  And a person who has been nominated to permanently hold that \n9  position may not serve as an acting officer, except under specified circumstances not applicable here. \n10  Id. § 3345(b)(1)(B).   \n11  91.  Unless an officer is performing the functions and duties of the vacant office \n12  consistent with the FVRA or an agency-specific statute as authorized by section 3347 of the FVRA, \n13  “the office shall remain vacant.”  5 U.S.C. § 3348(b)(1).  \n14  92.  An agency action taken by an unlawfully serving acting official in the performance of \n15  a “function or duty” of the vacant office “shall have no force and effect” and “may not be ratified.”  \n16  Id. §§ 3348(d)(1), (d)(2).  A “function or duty” is any function or duty that is established by statute \n17  or regulation that is required by statute or regulation “to be performed by the applicable officer (and \n18  only that officer).”  Id. § 3348(a)(2). \n19  93.  Establishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities is a function of \n20  the Secretary of Homeland Security.  6 U.S.C. § 202(5).  Defendant Wolf relied on section 202 when \n21  issuing the Wolf Memorandum, which purports to set enforcement priorities.  See Wolf \n22  Memorandum at 4. \n23    The DHS Succession Order \n24  94.  Since December 2016, the further order of succession for the Secretary of Homeland \n25  Security under the HSA has been governed by Executive Order 13753 and DHS Delegation Number \n26  00106 (“Directive 00106”), issued by then-Secretary Jeh Johnson.  Together, these documents set \n27  forth two orders of succession depending on the reason the Secretary is unavailable.   \n28  95.  Executive Order 13753, issued pursuant to the President’s authority under section \n \n  28 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 29 of 40\n1  3345 of the FVRA, designated the order of DHS officials who would become Acting Secretary \n2  “during any period in which the Secretary has died, resigned, or otherwise become unable to perform \n3  the functions and duties of the office of Secretary.”  Exec. Order 13753 § 1, Amending the Order of \n4  Succession in the Department of Homeland Security, 81 Fed. Reg. 90,667, 90,667 (Dec. 9, 2016).  \n5  Section II.A of Directive 00106 adopted the order of succession laid out in Executive Order 13753 \n6  “[i]n case of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the Office.”  \n7  Section II.B of Directive 00106, by contrast, set forth a separate order of succession for a different \n8  set of circumstances: when the Secretary becomes “unavailable to act during a disaster or \n9  catastrophic emergency.”  Annex A to the Directive set forth this alternative order of succession \n10  under Section II.B.  In other words, there were two separate orders for the office of the Secretary of \n11  Homeland Security: one that applied when the Secretary had “died, resigned, or otherwise become \n12  unable to perform” her duties (Section II.A and Executive Order 13753) and one that applied when \n13  the Secretary was “unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency” (Section II.B and \n14  Annex A).   \n15  96.  On April 7, 2019, then-Secretary Nielsen announced on Twitter that she had resigned \n16  office effective that day.  She later tweeted that day that she had agreed to stay on as Secretary \n17  through April 10 “to assist with an orderly transition.”  On April 9, 2019, then-Secretary Nielsen \n18  signed a memorandum that amended Directive 00106 to replace Annex A’s order referenced in \n19  Section II.B of Directive 00106, which applied only when the Secretary become unavailable due to \n20  an disaster or catastrophic emergency.  The Amendment to Annex A identified that document not as \n21  an “order of succession,” but rather as an “order of delegation of authority.”  The April 2019 \n22  memorandum did not, however, amend the language in Section II.A of Directive 00106, which \n23  applied when the Secretary died, resigned, or became unable to perform her functions.   \n24  97.  The effect of then-Secretary Nielsen’s memorandum was to leave intact the separate \n25  orders of succession for the Secretary in case of her “death, resignation, or inability to perform the \n26  functions of the Office” and her “unavailab[ility] to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency” \n27  respectively.  Thus, at the time she resigned on April 10, 2019, the relevant order of succession \n28  under Section II.A, which adopted Executive Order 13753, for the acting position was: Deputy \n \n  29 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 30 of 40\n1  Secretary, Under Secretary for Management, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency \n2  Management Agency (“FEMA”), the Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs, the \n3  Under Secretary for Science and Technology, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, and \n4  Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.   \n5  98.  On April 10, 2019, four of the six offices in the line of succession when the \n6  Secretary’s office becomes vacant due to resignation were vacant (Deputy Secretary of Homeland \n7  Security, Under Secretary for Management, FEMA Administrator, and Under Secretary for Science \n8  and Technology).  Two offices in the line of succession were not vacant—the Under Secretary for \n9  National Protection and Programs and the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis—but \n10  neither of the individuals holding these offices assumed the office of Acting Secretary.  Instead, CBP \n11  Commissioner Kevin McAleenan assumed the office of Acting Secretary.  While the CBP \n12  Commissioner would have been next in line to serve as Acting Secretary in the event of the \n13  Secretary’s unavailability “to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency” under Section II.B of \n14  Directive 00106 and Annex A, the CBP Commissioner was not next in line in case of death, \n15  resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the office under Section II.A of Directive 00106.  \n16  Because the need for an Acting Secretary arose due to Secretary Nielsen’s resignation, \n17  Commissioner McAleenan’s accession to the office of Acting Secretary was contrary to Directive \n18  00106 and Executive Order 13753. \n19  99.  On November 8, 2019 (212 days after Nielsen resigned), Commissioner McAleenan \n20  issued an order in his purported capacity as Acting Secretary to further amend Directive 00106.  \n21  These amendments (1) provided that Annex A would also govern the order of succession in cases of \n22  death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the office, and (2) replaced Annex A’s \n23  order of succession with a new one under which the CBP Commissioner would be third in line to \n24  serve as Acting Secretary and the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans would be fourth in \n25  line.  However, because Commissioner McAleenan was not the lawful Acting Secretary following \n26  Secretary Nielsen’s resignation, and also because the office of the Secretary had been vacant for \n27  more than 210 days, he did not have lawful authority to amend the DHS order of succession.   \n28  100.  Defendant Wolf was confirmed as Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans on \n \n  30 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 31 of 40\n1  November 13, 2019. \n2  101.  Also on November 13, 2019 (217 days after Nielsen resigned), Commissioner \n3  McAleenan resigned as Acting Secretary of Homeland Secretary.  Defendant Wolf purported to take \n4  office as Acting Secretary of Homeland Secretary pursuant to Commissioner McAleenan’s \n5  November 8, 2019 amendments to Directive 00106.  Because Defendant Wolf’s installation as \n6  Acting Secretary was based on the amendments to the order of succession that McAleenan lacked \n7  the authority to make, it was likewise unlawful. \n8  102.  When Defendant Wolf appointed Defendant Edlow to the office of Deputy Director \n9  of Policy of USCIS on February 19, 2020, the office of the Secretary had been vacant for 315 days. \n10  103.  When Defendant Wolf issued the Wolf Memorandum on July 28, 2020, the office of \n11  the Secretary had been vacant for 475 days and Defendant Wolf had been unlawfully serving as \n12  Acting Secretary for 258 days. \n13  The Government Accountability Office Concludes that Defendant Wolf Is Not Lawfully \n14  Serving as Acting Secretary \n15  104.  On November 15, 2019, the Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland \n16  Security and the Acting Chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform wrote the \n17  United States Comptroller General, who is head of the United States Government Accountability \n18  Office (“GAO”).  Their letter expressed doubt that Commissioner McAleenan had lawfully assumed \n19  office as Acting Secretary consistent with section 113(g) of the HSA, that Commissioner McAleenan \n20  had lawfully amended Directive 00106 on November 8, 2019, and that Defendant Wolf had lawfully \n21  succeeded Commissioner McAleenan as Acting Secretary pursuant to Directive 00106. \n22  105.  On August 14, 2020, the GAO’s General Counsel concluded that Defendant Wolf had \n23  never lawfully served in the role of Acting Secretary because his assumption of that role—based on \n24  amendments McAleenan had no authority to make—had violated the FVRA and HSA.  See U.S. \n25  Gov’t Accountability Office, B-3321650, Decision Letter on Legality of Service of Acting Secretary \n26  of Homeland Security and Service of Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy Secretary of \n27  Homeland Security (Aug. 14, 2020), available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/708830.pdf \n28  (“GAO Opinion”).

Id. at 2 n.1 \n3  106.  DHS requested that the GAO reconsider and rescind its report, but the GAO denied \n4  the request, concluding that DHS had not shown that the report contained any material errors of fact \n5  or law.  See U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, B-332451, Decision Letter on Legality of Service of \n6  Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and Service of Senior Official Performing the Duties of \n7  Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security—Reconsideration (Aug. 21, 2020), available at \n8  https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/708944.pdf; see also Office of the General Counsel, DHS, Letter to \n9  Thomas A.

On August 25, 2020, President Trump announced on Twitter that he intended to \n13  nominate Defendant Wolf as the permanent Secretary of Homeland Security. \n14  108.  On September 10, 2020, President Trump formally nominated Defendant Wolf to be \n15  Secretary of Homeland Security. \n16  109.  Also on September 10, 2020, FEMA Administrator Peter T. Gaynor re-issued the \n17  order of succession first issued by Commissioner McAleenan in November 2019.  Peter T. Gaynor, \n18  Order Designating the Order of Succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security (Sept. 10, 2020) \n19  (“Gaynor Order”).  The Gaynor Order did not concede that the orders of succession issued by former \n20  Secretary Nielsen and Commissioner McAleenan were unlawful, but acknowledged the GAO \n21  Opinion’s conclusion that “no Secretary has ever properly invoked 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2)” to issue a \n22  “further order of succession.”  According to the Gaynor Order, if that were the case, the FVRA \n23  “would provide an alternative basis for an official to exercise the functions and duties of the \n24  Secretary in an acting capacity,” and under Executive Order 13753, the next-in-line official under \n25  the FVRA would be the FEMA Administrator—Mr. Gaynor.  Exercising “any authority [he] may \n26  have been granted by the FVRA,” and “out of an abundance of caution,” Mr. Gaynor re-issued \n27  pursuant to § 113(g)(2) the same order of succession previously issued by Commissioner \n28  McAleenan.  According to Mr. Gaynor, under his reissuance of the order of succession, Defendant \n \n  32 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 33 of 40\n1  Wolf became Acting Secretary.   \n2  110.  Although the FVRA bars—subject to exceptions not applicable here—officials who \n3  have been formally nominated for a position from serving in that role in an acting capacity, see 5 \n4  U.S.C. 3345(b)(1)(B), and President Trump formally nominated Defendant Wolf on September 10, \n5  2020, Defendant Wolf has continued to claim to be Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.   \n6  111.  On September 17, 2020, Defendant Wolf issued a memorandum purporting to ratify \n7  actions he took as Acting Secretary prior to the Gaynor Order.  See Ratification of Department \n8  Actions, 89 Fed. Reg. 59651, 59652–54 (Sept. 23, 2020) (“First Ratification Memorandum”).  Like \n9  the Gaynor Order, the First Ratification Memorandum did not concede that Defendant Wolf’s \n10  service as Acting Secretary was unlawful, and instead affirmed that Defendant Wolf “remain[s] the \n11  Acting Secretary notwithstanding [his] nomination” and the FVRA’s time limits.  But “out of an \n12  abundance of caution,” the First Ratification Memorandum relied on “alternate scenario” set forth in \n13  the Gaynor Order as another basis for Wolf’s authority. \n14  112.  The First Ratification Memorandum also asserted that the FVRA’s prohibition on \n15  nominees serving in an acting capacity during the pendency of the nomination does not apply to the \n16  office of the Secretary under the HSA, and that Defendant Wolf’s nomination “restarted the FVRA’s \n17  time limits” to the extent they applied to the office of the Secretary. \n18  113.  The First Ratification Memorandum then purported to exercise the authority of the \n19  Acting Secretary to “affirm and ratify any and all actions involving delegable duties” taken by \n20  Defendant Wolf “from November 13, 2019, through September 10, 2020.” \n21  114.  Defendant Wolf issued another ratification memorandum on October 7, 2020, this \n22  one purporting to ratify, among other actions, “one delegable action taken by U.S. Citizenship and \n23  Immigration Services (USCIS) Deputy Directive for Policy Edlow,” including the August 21, 2020 \n24  Edlow Directive.  See Ratification of Department Actions, 89 Fed. Reg. 65653, 65653–56 (Oct. 16, \n25  2020) (“Second Ratification Memorandum”). \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n \n  33 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 34 of 40\n1  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n3  The Wolf Memorandum and the Edlow Directive \n4  115.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set forth in this \n5  Amended Complaint. \n6  116.  The Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Directive are final agency actions subject to \n7  judicial review under the APA. \n8  117.  Under the APA, courts shall “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action “found to be \n9  arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to a \n10  constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \n11  limitations, or short of statutory right; without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. \n12  § 706(2). \n13  118.  The Wolf Memorandum is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, contrary \n14  to law, and in excess of statutory authority.  Instead of reasoned explanation, the Wolf Memorandum \n15  is based on asserted policy justifications that are not supported by evidence and that are, in any \n16  event, untethered to the interim actions taken.  Some are also improper.  For example, the Wolf \n17  Memorandum effectively concedes that it is temporarily rescinding core components of the DACA \n18  program in order to spur congressional action on immigration reform.  But wielding DACA—a \n19  hugely successful program on which hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients, their families, and \n20  their communities—as a political pawn reveals the Wolf Memorandum’s lack of reasoned \n21  justification. \n22  119.  What is more, although the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Directive have immediate \n23  consequences for Plaintiffs and numerous DACA recipients and DACA-eligible individuals, \n24  Defendants characterize their actions as an “interim” measure, effectively conceding that they did \n25  not conduct a full consideration of the contemplated changes as required by the APA and by the \n26  Supreme Court’s Regents III decision.   \n27  120.  The Wolf Memorandum also fails to consider all the relevant factors, including those \n28  set out by the Supreme Court.  For example, the Memorandum fails to fully consider the reliance \n \n  34 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 35 of 40\n1  interests of those who have participated in or in other ways benefited from the DACA program or \n2  the reliance interests of those who would be eligible to apply for DACA but for the Memorandum, \n3  including those who the law required to be allowed to apply after the Regents III decision.  It also \n4  fails to assess the arbitrariness or harms of applying its policies retroactively.   \n5  121.  In addition, the retroactive application of the Wolf Memorandum’s new policies \n6  violates the legal obligations imposed by the Supreme Court’s Regents III decision and the Fourth \n7  Circuit’s mandate to return to the status quo ante before Defendants’ unlawful rescission in 2017.   \n8  122.  Finally, the Wolf Memorandum was issued by an agency official who lacked legal \n9  authority to do so because Defendant Wolf was not lawfully serving as Acting Secretary of \n10  Homeland Security.  The Wolf Memorandum is thus contrary to law in violation of the Homeland \n11  Security Act, Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and the Appointments Clause, and is invalid and void. \n12  123.  The Edlow Directive is also arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and \n13  otherwise not in accordance with law because, among other reasons, it purports to implement the \n14  unlawful Wolf Memorandum and unreasonably instructs USCIS staff to reject renewal applications \n15  filed more than 150 days before the expiration of current DACA recipients’ validity period even \n16  though USCIS’ current estimates of processing times for DACA applications far exceed 150 days.  \n17  In addition, the Directive was issued by an individual who did not have legal authority to do so: \n18  Defendant Edlow was designated to serve in his position by Defendant Wolf, who was and still is \n19  unlawfully serving as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.   \n20  124.  The Wolf Memorandum and the Edlow Directive implementing it are therefore \n21  arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and in excess of statutory authority in violation of 5 U.S.C. \n22  § 706(2)(A) & (C), and must be held unlawful and set aside. \n23  125.  The County, its employees, and its residents, and Local 521 and its members have \n24  been harmed and continue to be harmed by these unlawful acts. \n25  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n26  Federal Vacancies Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq., and Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. \n27  §§ 112–13 \n28  126.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set forth in this \n \n  35 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 36 of 40\n1  Amended Complaint. \n2  127.  The Secretary of Homeland Security must be appointed by the President with the \n3  advice and consent of the Senate.  6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(1). \n4  128.  When the office of the Secretary is vacant, only a valid Acting Secretary may perform \n5  the functions or duties of the Secretary.  \n6  129.  Commissioner McAleenan lacked the authority to amend the order of succession \n7  which purported to make Defendant Wolf next in line for Acting Secretary for at least three \n8  independent reasons.   \n9  130.  First, Commissioner McAleenan improperly assumed the position of Acting Secretary \n10  in violation of the order of succession under the HSA, 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2), and so was not lawfully \n11  serving as Acting Secretary.   \n12  131.  Second, section 113(g)(2) of the HSA authorizes only the Secretary, not an Acting \n13  Secretary, to establish a further order of succession to that office.  See Nw. Immgr. Rts. Project v. \n14  U.S. Citizenship & Immigr. Servs., No. 19-cv-03283-RDM, slip op. at 38–42, 52 (D.D.C. Oct. 8. \n15  2020) (Moss, J.) (“The Court therefore concludes that ‘Secretary’ in § 113(g)(2) does not include an \n16  Acting Secretary, but instead means the Secretary and only the Secretary.”).   \n17  132.  And third, by the time Commissioner McAleenan purported to amend the DHS order \n18  of succession, he had already been serving for longer than the FVRA’s limit of 210 days.  See 5 \n19  U.S.C. § 3346(a).  Because the office of the Secretary had been vacant for more than 210 days, the \n20  FVRA required that it “remain vacant” until the President submitted a nominee to the Senate.  Id. \n21  § 3348(b)(1).   \n22  133.  Thus, for these reasons, Commissioner McAleenan amended the order of succession \n23  without lawful authority, and his actions “have no force or effect.”  5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1).  Because \n24  Defendant Wolf assumed the position of Acting Secretary pursuant to Commissioner McAleenan’s \n25  unlawful amendments, his service in that role is unlawful under both the HSA and FVRA. \n26  134.  Besides these defects in Commissioner McAleenan’s authority, by the time \n27  Defendant Wolf assumed the role of Acting Secretary on November 13, 2019, the office of the \n28  Secretary had been vacant for 217 days, a week past the total 210 days an office can by occupied by \n \n  36 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 37 of 40\n1  acting officials before it must remain vacant under the FVRA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 3346(a).  And by the \n2  time Defendant Wolf issued the Wolf Memorandum on July 28, 2020, the office of the Secretary had \n3  been vacant for 475 days and Defendant Wolf had been serving as Acting Secretary for 258 days.  \n4  For these reasons as well, Defendant Wolf’s assumption of the office and issuance of the Wolf \n5  Memorandum were unlawful. \n6  135.  As a result of these separate and independent legal infirmities, Defendant Wolf was \n7  not lawfully serving as the Acting Secretary and did not have the legal authority to issue the Wolf \n8  Memorandum or appoint Defendant Edlow to serve as Deputy Director of Policy of USCIS.  In fact, \n9  at that time, no officer could perform the functions of Acting Secretary and no officer had legal \n10  authority to issue a memorandum even temporarily rescinding or modifying key components of the \n11  DACA program. \n12  136.  Because the Wolf Memorandum was issued by an officer unlawfully serving as \n13  Acting Secretary, it “shall have no force and effect” and “may not be ratified.”  5 U.S.C. \n14  §§ 3348(d)(1), (d)(2).  Defendant Wolf’s First and Second Ratification Memoranda are therefore \n15  contrary to the plain terms of the FVRA and cannot remedy the legal defects of the Wolf \n16  Memorandum or the Edlow Directive.  Even if the plain text of the FVRA did not bar ratification, \n17  Defendant Wolf could not have issued his Ratification Memoranda because, as already explained, \n18  the office of the Secretary has been vacant for far more than 210 days and must “remain vacant,” 5 \n19  U.S.C. § 3346(a); the FVRA prohibits nominees from serving in an acting capacity the role for \n20  which they have been nominated, see id. § 3345(b)(1); and, in any event, the Gaynor Order did not \n21  and could not cure the defects in Wolf’s unlawful assumption of the role of Acting Secretary. \n22  137.  The County, its employees, and its residents, and Local 521 and its members have \n23  been harmed and continue to be harmed by these unlawful acts. \n24  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n25  Violation of the Appointments Clause, U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2 \n26  138.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all the allegations set forth in this \n27  Amended Complaint. \n28  139.  Under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the President “shall \n \n  37 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 38 of 40\n1  nominate, and by and with Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Officers, of the \n2  United States.”  U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  As a limited exception, Congress may authorize the \n3  President, a court of law, or “Heads of Departments” to appoint inferior officers without the advice \n4  and consent of the Senate.  Id. \n5  140.  The Department of Homeland Security is an Executive Department.  5 U.S.C. § 101.  \n6  As a Head of Department, the Secretary of Homeland Security is a principal officer subject to the \n7  Appointments Clause.  See Fin. Oversight & Mgmt. Bd. for Puerto Rico v. Aurelius Inv., LLC, 140 S. \n8  Ct. 1649, 1657 (2020). \n9  141.  An inferior officer may perform the functions of a vacant principal office but only \n10  “for a limited time, and under special and temporary conditions.”  United States v. Eaton, 169 U.S. \n11  331, 338 (1898) (emphasis added).  In other words, the Appointments Clause does not tolerate an \n12  acting official or acting officials serving for an unreasonably long period of time in a vacant position \n13  that requires Senate confirmation. \n14  142.  Defendant Wolf has not been confirmed by the Senate for the position of Secretary of \n15  Homeland Security.   \n16  143.  When he appointed Defendant Edlow to the office of Deputy Director for Policy of \n17  USCIS on February 19, 2020, Defendant Wolf had not been nominated by the President or \n18  confirmed by the Senate for the position of Secretary of Homeland Security.  By February 19, 2020, \n19  the office of the Secretary had been vacant for 315 days. \n20  144.  When he issued his Memorandum on July 28, 2020, Defendant Wolf had not been \n21  nominated by the President or confirmed by the Senate for the position of Secretary of Homeland \n22  Security.  By July 28, 2020, the office of the Secretary had been vacant for 475 days. \n23  145.  Even if Defendant Wolf’s service as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security were \n24  consistent with the HSA and FVRA, his unreasonably long service in that role would violate the \n25  Appointments Clause. \n26  146.  In addition, Defendant Wolf’s appointment as Acting Secretary by another inferior \n27  officer violates the Appointments Clause. \n28  147.  Under the Appointments Clause, a “Head of Department” is a principal officer who \n \n  38 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 39 of 40\n1  may be authorized to appoint inferior officers.  But an acting official is an inferior officer, not \n2  principal officer.  Eaton, 169 U.S. at 338.  Thus, although an acting secretary performs the functions \n3  or duties of the secretary of a department, that acting secretary is not a “Head of Department” and \n4  cannot appoint another inferior officer.  To allow otherwise would permit acting secretaries to \n5  appoint their replacements seriatim, avoiding indefinitely the strictures of the Appointments Clause. \n6  148.  When Commissioner McAleenan amended DHS’s order of succession, he was an \n7  inferior officer purportedly serving as Acting Secretary.  Because Commissioner McAleenan was \n8  not a Head of Department within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, he did not have authority \n9  to amend DHS’s order of succession and thus appoint another inferior officer to serve in an acting \n10  capacity.  Therefore, even if McAleenan had lawfully served as Acting Secretary, Defendant Wolf \n11  could not have properly assumed the role of Acting Secretary based on Commissioner McAleenan’s \n12  amendments.    \n13  149.  Because Defendant Wolf was not serving legally as the Acting Secretary of \n14  Homeland Security, he did not have legal authority to issue the Wolf Memorandum or to appoint \n15  Defendant Edlow to serve as Deputy Director of Policy of USCIS. \n16  150.  Because they were issued by officials without the authority to do so, the Wolf \n17  Memorandum and Edlow Directive are invalid and must be vacated.   \n18  151.  The County, its employees, and its residents, and Local 521 and its members have \n19  been harmed and continue to be harmed by these unlawful acts. \n20  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n21  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant the following relief: \n22  A.  Vacate and set aside the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Directive; \n23  B.  Declare that the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Directive and Defendants’ actions in \n24  connection therewith were issued in violation of the Homeland Security Act and the Federal \n25  Vacancies Reform Act and are void and without legal force or effect;  \n26  C.  Declare that the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Directive were issued in violation of \n27  the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution; \n28  D.  Declare that the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Directive and Defendants’ actions in \n \n  39 \n AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-05813-WHA   Document 87   Filed 11/02/20   Page 40 of 40\n1  connection therewith are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in \n2  accordance with law required by law in violation of 5 U.S.C. §§ 702–06;  \n3  E.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin and restrain Defendants, their agents, servants, \n4  employees, attorneys, and all persons in active concert or participation with any of them, from \n5  implementing or enforcing the Wolf Memorandum and Edlow Directive or from taking any other \n6  action to rescind DACA that is not in compliance with applicable law;  \n7  F.  Grant Plaintiffs further relief as necessary to remedy the injuries caused by the \n8  unlawful actions taken by Defendants, including by allowing those individuals who would have been \n9  eligible to apply for deferred action under DACA were it not for the unlawful rescission in 2017 to \n10  apply for DACA now;  \n11  G.  Award Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; and  \n12  H.  Grant Plaintiffs such further and additional relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n13   \n14  Dated:  November 2, 2020  Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n15  /s/ James R. Williams \n  JAMES R.

Detroit Timber & Lumber  Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337. \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nSyllabus  \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND  SECURITY  ET AL. v. \nREGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY  OF  \nCALIFORNIA ET AL. \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE NINTH CIRCUIT  \nNo. 18–587.  Argued November 12, 2019—Decided June 18, 2020*  \nIn 2012, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a memo-\nrandum announcing an immigration relief program known as Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which allows certain unauthor-\nized aliens who arrived in the United States as children to apply for a \ntwo-year forbearance of removal.  Those granted such relief become \neligible for work authorization and various federal benefits.  Some  \n700,000 aliens have availed themselves of this opportunity. \n     Two years later, DHS expanded DACA eligibility and created a re-\nlated program known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and \nLawful Permanent Residents (DAPA).  If implemented, that program \nwould have made 4.3 million parents of U.  S. citizens or lawful perma-\nnent residents eligible for the same forbearance from removal, work  \neligibility, and other benefits as DACA recipients.  Texas, joined by 25 \nother States, secured a nationwide preliminary injunction barring im-\nplementation of both the DACA expansion and DAPA.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit upheld the injunction, concluding that the program violated the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA), which carefully defines eligi-\nbility for benefits.  This Court affirmed by an equally divided vote, and \n—————— \n*Together  with No. 18–588, Trump, President of the United States, et  \n \nal. v. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People et al., \non certiorari before judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for  \nthe District of Columbia Circuit, and No. 18–589, Wolf, Acting Secretary \nof Homeland  Security, et al. v.  Batalla  Vidal et al., on certiorari before \njudgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \n \n\n2  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nSyllabus  \nthe litigation then continued in the District Court.   \n     In June 2017, following a change in Presidential administrations,  \nDHS rescinded the DAPA Memorandum, citing, among other reasons, \nthe ongoing suit by Texas  and new policy priorities.  That September, \nthe Attorney General advised Acting Secretary of Homeland Security \nElaine C. Duke that DACA shared DAPA’s legal flaws and should also \nbe rescinded.  The next day, Duke acted on that advice.  Taking into \nconsideration the Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court rulings and the At-\ntorney General’s letter, Duke decided to terminate the program.  She \nexplained that DHS would no longer accept new applications, but that \nexisting DACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire within six \nmonths could apply for a two-year renewal.  For all other DACA recip-\nients, previously issued grants of relief would expire on their own \nterms, with no prospect for renewal.   \n     Several groups of plaintiffs challenged Duke’s decision to rescind  \nDACA, claiming that it was arbitrary  and capricious in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) and infringed the equal protec-\ntion guarantee of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  District  \nCourts in California (Regents, No. 18–587), New York (Batalla Vidal, \nNo. 18–589), and the District of Columbia (NAACP, No. 18–588) all  \nruled for the plaintiffs.  Each court rejected the Government’s argu-\nments that the claims were unreviewable under the APA and that the  \nINA deprived the courts of jurisdiction. In Regents and Batalla Vidal, \nthe District Courts further held that the equal protection claims were \nadequately alleged, and they entered coextensive nationwide prelimi-\nnary injunctions based on the conclusion that the plaintiffs were likely \nto succeed on their APA claims.  The District Court in  NAACP took a \ndifferent approach.  It deferred ruling on  the equal protection chal-\nlenge but granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their \nAPA claim, finding that the rescission was inadequately explained.  \nThe court then stayed its order for 90 days to permit DHS to reissue a \nmemorandum rescinding  DACA, this time with a fuller explanation of \nthe conclusion that DACA was unlawful.  Two months later, Duke’s  \nsuccessor, Secretary Kirstjen M.  Nielsen, responded to  the court’s  or-\nder.  She declined to disturb or replace Duke’s rescission decision and \ninstead explained why she thought her predecessor’s decision was \nsound.  In addition to reiterating the illegality conclusion, she offered \nseveral new justifications for the rescission.  The Government moved  \nfor the District Court to reconsider in light of this additional explana-\ntion, but the court concluded that the new reasoning failed to elaborate \nmeaningfully on the illegality rationale.  \n     The Government appealed  the various District Court  decisions to  \nthe Second, Ninth, and D.  C. Circuits, respectively.  While those ap-\npeals were pending, the Government filed three petitions  for certiorari  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \nbefore judgment.  Following  the Ninth Circuit affirmance in Regents, \nthis Court granted  certiorari.  \nHeld: The judgment in No. 18–587 is vacated in part and reversed in \npart; the judgment in No. 18–588 is affirmed; the February 13, 2018 \norder in No. 18–589 is vacated, the November 9, 2017 order is affirmed  \nin part, and the March 29, 2018 order is reversed in part; and all of the \ncases are remanded. \nNo. 18–587, 908 F. 3d 476, vacated in part and reversed in part; No. 18–\n588, affirmed; and No. 18–589, February  13, 2018 order vacated, No-\nvember 9, 2017 order affirmed in part, and March 29, 2018 order re-\nversed in part; all cases remanded. \n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to  \nPart IV, concluding: \n   1. DHS’s rescission decision  is reviewable under the APA and is \nwithin this Court’s jurisdiction.  Pp. 9–13. \n     (a) The APA’s “basic presumption of judicial review” of agency ac-\ntion, Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140, can be rebut-\nted by showing that the “agency action is committed to agency discre-\ntion by law,” 5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2).  In Heckler v. Chaney, the Court held  \nthat this narrow exception includes an agency’s decision not to insti-\ntute an enforcement action.  470 U. S. 821, 831–832.  The Government  \ncontends that DACA is a general non-enforcement policy  equivalent to \nthe individual non-enforcement decision in  Chaney.  But the DACA  \nMemorandum  did not merely decline to institute enforcement proceed-\nings; it created a program for conferring  affirmative immigration re-\nlief.  Therefore,  unlike  the  non-enforcement  decision  in  Chaney, \nDACA’s creation—and its rescission—is an “action [that] provides a  \nfocus for judicial review.”   Id., at 832.  In addition, by virtue of receiving \ndeferred action, 700,000 DACA recipients may  request work  authori-\nzation and are eligible for Social Security and Medicare.  Access to such  \nbenefits is an interest “courts often are called upon to protect.”  Ibid.   \nDACA’s rescission is thus subject to review under the APA.  Pp. 9–12.\n     (b) The two jurisdictional provisions of the INA invoked by the \nGovernment do not apply.  Title 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9), which bars re-\nview of claims arising from “action[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to re-\nmove an alien,” is inapplicable where, as here, the parties do not chal-\nlenge any removal proceedings.  And the rescission is not a decision “to  \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders” \nwithin the meaning of §1252(g).  Pp. 12–13. \n   2. DHS’s decision to rescind DACA was arbitrary  and capricious un-\nder the APA.  Pp. 13–26. \n     (a) In assessing the rescission, the Government urges the Court to \nconsider not just the contemporaneous explanation offered by Acting \nSecretary Duke but also  the additional reasons supplied by Secretary \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nSyllabus  \nNielsen nine months later.  Judicial review of agency action, however, \nis limited to “the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the \naction.”  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U. S. 743, 758.  If those grounds are \ninadequate, a court may  remand for the agency to offer “a fuller expla-\nnation of the agency’s reasoning at the time of the agency  action,” Pen-\nsion Benefit Guaranty Corporation v.  LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654  \n(emphasis added), or to “deal with the problem afresh” by taking  new  \nagency action, SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.  S. 194, 201.  Because Sec-\nretary Nielsen chose not to take new action, she was limited to elabo-\nrating on the agency’s original reasons.  But her reasoning bears little \nrelationship to that of her predecessor and consists primarily of imper-\nmissible “post hoc rationalization.”  Citizens to Preserve  Overton Park, \nInc. v.  Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 420.  The rule requiring a new decision  \nbefore considering new reasons is not merely a  formality.  It serves \nimportant administrative law values by  promoting agency accounta-\nbility to the public, instilling confidence that the reasons given are not \nsimply convenient litigating positions, and facilitating orderly review.  \nEach of these values would be markedly undermined if this Court al-\nlowed DHS to  rely on reasons offered nine months after the rescission \nand after three different courts had identified flaws in the original ex-\nplanation.  Pp. 13–17. \n     (b)  Acting Secretary Duke’s  rescission memorandum failed to con-\nsider important aspects of the problem before the agency.  Although \nDuke was bound by the Attorney General’s determination that DACA \nis illegal, see 8 U. S. C. §1103(a)(1), deciding  how best to address that \ndetermination involved important policy choices reserved for DHS.   \nActing Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretionary authority \nin winding down the program, but she did not appreciate the full scope \nof her discretion.  The Attorney General concluded that the legal de-\nfects in DACA mirrored those that the courts had recognized in DAPA.  \nThe Fifth Circuit, the highest court to offer a reasoned opinion on \nDAPA’s legality, found that DAPA violated the INA because it ex-\ntended eligibility for benefits to a class of unauthorized aliens.  But the \ndefining feature of DAPA (and DACA) is DHS’s decision to defer re-\nmoval, and the Fifth Circuit carefully distinguished that forbearance \ncomponent from the associated benefits eligibility.  Eliminating bene-\nfits eligibility while continuing forbearance thus remained squarely \nwithin Duke’s  discretion.  Yet, rather than addressing forbearance in \nher decision, Duke treated the Attorney General’s conclusion regard-\ning the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both benefits and \nforbearance, without explanation.  That reasoning repeated the error \nin Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc.  \nv. State Farm— treating a rationale that applied to only part of a policy \nas sufficient to rescind the entire policy.   463 U. S. 29, 51.  While DHS \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nSyllabus  \nwas not required to “consider all policy alternatives,” ibid., deferred \naction was “within the ambit of the existing” policy,  ibid.; indeed, it \nwas the centerpiece of the policy.  In failing to consider the option to \nretain deferred action, Duke “failed to supply the requisite ‘reasoned \nanalysis.’ ” Id., at 57. \n \n   That omission alone renders Duke’s decision arbitrary  and capri-\ncious, but it was not the only defect.  Duke also failed to address \nwhether there was “legitimate reliance” on the DACA Memorandum.  \nSmiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742.  Certain  \nfeatures of the DACA policy may affect the strength of any reliance \ninterests, but those features are for the agency to consider in the first \ninstance. DHS has flexibility in addressing  any reliance interests and \ncould have considered various accommodations.  While the agency was \nnot required to pursue these accommodations, it was required to assess \nthe existence and strength of any reliance interests, and weigh them \nagainst competing policy concerns.  Its failure to do so was arbitrary  \nand capricious.  Pp. 17–26.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG,  JUSTICE BREYER, \nand JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that respondents’ claims fail \nto establish a plausible inference that the rescission was motivated by \nanimus in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \nAmendment.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS  delivered  the  opinion  of  the \nCourt, except as to Part IV. \n  In the summer of 2012, the Department of Homeland Se-\ncurity (DHS) announced an immigration program known as \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  That \nprogram allows certain unauthorized aliens who entered \nthe United States as children to apply for a two-year for-\nbearance of removal.  Those granted such relief are also \neligible for work authorization and various federal benefits.  \nSome  700,000  aliens  have  availed  themselves  of  this \nopportunity. \n  Five years later, the Attorney General advised DHS to \nrescind DACA, based on his conclusion that it was unlaw-\nful. The Department’s Acting Secretary issued a memoran-\ndum terminating the program on that basis.  The termina-\ntion  was  challenged  by  affected  individuals  and  third\nparties who alleged, among other things, that the Acting \nSecretary had violated the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA) by failing to adequately address important factors \nbearing on her decision.  For the reasons that follow, we \nconclude that the Acting Secretary did violate the APA, and \nthat the rescission must be vacated.  \nI \nA \n  In June 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security issued \na memorandum announcing an immigration relief program \nfor “certain young people who were brought to this country \nas children.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 18–587, p. 97a  \n(App. to Pet. for Cert.).  Known as DACA, the program ap-\nplies to childhood arrivals who were under age 31 in 2012;\nhave continuously resided here since 2007; are current stu-\ndents, have completed high school, or are honorably dis-\ncharged veterans; have not been convicted of any serious \ncrimes; and do not threaten national security or public  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nsafety.  Id., at 98a.  DHS concluded that individuals who \nmeet these criteria warrant favorable treatment under the \nimmigration laws because they “lacked the intent to violate\nthe law,” are “productive” contributors to our society, and \n“know only this country as home.”  Id., at 98a–99a. \n  “[T]o prevent [these] low priority  individuals from being \nremoved from the United States,” the DACA Memorandum \ninstructs Immigration and Customs Enforcement to “exer-\ncise prosecutorial discretion[] on an individual basis . . . by\n \ndeferring action for a period of two years, subject to re-\nnewal.”  Id., at 100a.  In addition, it directs U. S. Citizen-\nship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to “accept applica-\ntions to determine whether these individuals qualify for \nwork authorization during this period of deferred action,”  \nid., at 101a, as permitted under regulations long predating \nDACA’s creation, see 8  CFR §274a.12(c)(14) (2012) (permit-\nting work authorization for deferred action recipients who \nestablish “economic necessity”); 46 Fed. Reg. 25080–25081 \n(1981) (similar). Pursuant to other regulations, deferred ac-\ntion recipients are considered “lawfully present” for pur-\nposes of, and therefore eligible  to receive, Social Security  \nand Medicare benefits.  See 8 CFR §1.3(a)(4)(vi); 42 CFR\n§417.422(h) (2012). \n  In November 2014, two years after DACA was promul-\ngated,  DHS  issued  a  memorandum  announcing  that  it \nwould expand DACA eligibility by removing the age cap, \nshifting the date-of-entry requirement from 2007 to 2010, \nand extending the deferred action and work authorization \nperiod to three years.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a–107a.  In \nthe same memorandum, DHS created a new, related pro-\ngram known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans \nand Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.  That program \nwould have authorized deferred action for up to 4.3 million \nparents whose children were U. S. citizens or lawful perma-\nnent residents.  These parents were to enjoy the same for-\nbearance,  work  eligibility,  and  other  benefits  as  DACA \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nrecipients.\n  Before the DAPA Memorandum was implemented, 26 \nStates, led by Texas, filed suit in the Southern District of \nTexas.  The States contended that DAPA and the DACA  \nexpansion violated the APA’s notice and comment require-\nment, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the \nExecutive’s duty under the Take Care Clause of the Consti-\ntution. The District Court found that the States were likely \nto succeed on the merits of at least one of their claims and  \nentered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring imple-\nmentation of both DAPA and the DACA expansion.  See \nTexas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 677–678 (2015). \n  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed the preliminary injunction.  Texas v. United  \nStates, 809 F. 3d 134, 188 (2015).  In opposing the injunc-\ntion, the Government argued that the DAPA Memorandum \nreflected an unreviewable exercise of the Government’s en-\nforcement discretion. The Fifth Circuit majority disagreed.  \nIt reasoned that the deferred action described in the DAPA  \nMemorandum was “much more than nonenforcement: It \nwould affirmatively confer ‘lawful presence’ and associated \nbenefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens.”   Id., at 166.  \nFrom this, the majority concluded that the creation of the \nDAPA program was not an unreviewable action “committed \nto agency discretion by law.”  Id., at 169 (quoting 5 U. S. C. \n§701(a)(2)).\n  The majority then upheld the injunction on two grounds.  \nIt first concluded the States were likely to succeed on their \nprocedural claim that the DAPA Memorandum was a sub-\nstantive rule that was required to undergo notice and com-\nment.  It then held that the APA required DAPA to be set \naside because the program was “manifestly contrary” to the \nINA, which “expressly and carefully provides legal designa-\ntions allowing defined classes” to “receive the benefits” as-\nsociated with “lawful presence” and to qualify for work  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nauthorization, 809 F. 3d, at 179–181, 186 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  Judge King dissented. \n  This Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote, which meant that no opinion was is-\nsued.  United States v.  Texas, 579 U. S. ___ (2016) (per cu-\nriam).  For the next year, litigation over DAPA and the\nDACA  expansion  continued  in  the  Southern  District  of \nTexas, while implementation of those policies remained \nenjoined. \n  Then, in June 2017, following a change in Presidential \nadministrations, DHS rescinded the DAPA Memorandum.  \nIn explaining that decision, DHS cited the preliminary in-\njunction  and  ongoing  litigation  in  Texas,  the  fact  that \nDAPA had never taken effect, and the new administration’s  \nimmigration enforcement priorities.\n  Three  months  later,  in  September  2017,  Attorney \nGeneral Jefferson B. Sessions III sent a letter to Acting Sec-\nretary of Homeland Security Elaine C. Duke, “advis[ing]” \nthat DHS “should rescind” DACA as well.  App. 877.  Citing\nthe Fifth Circuit’s opinion and this Court’s equally divided \naffirmance, the Attorney General concluded that DACA \nshared the “same legal . . . defects that the courts recog-\nnized as to DAPA” and was “likely” to meet a similar fate.   \nId., at 878. “In light of the costs and burdens” that a rescis-\nsion would “impose[] on DHS,” the Attorney General urged \n \nDHS  to  “consider  an  orderly  and  efficient  wind-down \nprocess.”  Ibid.  \n  The next day, Duke acted on the Attorney General’s ad-\nvice.  In her decision memorandum, Duke summarized the  \nhistory of the DACA and DAPA  programs, the Fifth Circuit \nopinion and ensuing affirmance, and the contents of the At-\ntorney General’s letter.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a–117a.  \n“Taking into consideration the Supreme Court’s and the \nFifth Circuit’s rulings” and the “letter from the Attorney \nGeneral,” she concluded that the “DACA program should be \nterminated.”  Id., at 117a. \n \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Duke then detailed how the program would be wound \ndown: No new applications would be accepted, but DHS\nwould entertain applications for two-year renewals from \nDACA recipients whose benefits were set to expire within \nsix months.  For all other DACA recipients, previously is-\nsued  grants  of  deferred  action  and  work  authorization  \nwould not be revoked but would expire on their own terms, \nwith no prospect for renewal.  Id., at 117a–118a. \nB \n  Within days of Acting Secretary  Duke’s rescission an-\nnouncement, multiple groups of plaintiffs ranging from in-\ndividual DACA recipients and States to the Regents of the \nUniversity of California and the National Association for \nthe Advancement of Colored People challenged her decision \nin the U. S. District Courts for the Northern District of Cal-\nifornia (Regents, No. 18–587), the Eastern District of New \nYork (Batalla Vidal, No. 18–589), and the District of Co-\nlumbia (NAACP, No. 18–588).  The relevant claims are that \nthe rescission was arbitrary and capricious in violation of\nthe APA and that it infringed the equal protection guaran-\ntee of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.1  \n  All three District Courts ruled for the plaintiffs, albeit at \ndifferent stages of the proceedings.2  In doing so, each court \nrejected the Government’s threshold arguments that the \n—————— \n1Plaintiffs also raised notice and comment claims, which uniformly \n \nfailed below, and assorted due process challenges, some of which sur-\nvived motions to dismiss.  Those claims are not before us. \n2In a related challenge not at issue here, the District Court for the \n \nDistrict of Maryland granted partial summary judgment in favor of the \nGovernment.  Casa de Maryland v. United States Dept. of Homeland Se-\ncurity, 284 F. Supp. 3d 758 (2018).  After the Government filed petitions \nfor certiorari in the instant cases, the Fourth Circuit reversed that deci-\nsion and vacated Acting Secretary Duke’s rescission as arbitrary and ca-\npricious. Casa de  Maryland  v.  United States Dept. of Homeland Security, \n924 F. 3d 684 (2019), cert. pending, No. 18–1469.  The Fourth Circuit has  \nsince stayed its mandate.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nclaims were unreviewable under the APA and that the INA \ndeprived the court of jurisdiction.  298 F. Supp. 3d 209, \n223–224, 234–235 (DC 2018); 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1029–\n1033 (ND Cal. 2018); 295 F. Supp. 3d 127, 150, 153–154 \n(EDNY 2017).\nIn Regents and Batalla Vidal, the District Courts held  \nthat the equal protection claims were adequately alleged.  \n298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1315 (ND Cal. 2018); 291 F. Supp. 3d \n260, 279 (EDNY 2018).  Those courts also entered coexten-\nsive nationwide preliminary injunctions, based on the con-\nclusion that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the mer-\nits of their claims that the rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious. These injunctions did not require DHS to accept \nnew applications, but did order the agency to allow DACA\nrecipients to “renew their enrollments.”  279 F.  Supp. 3d, at \n1048; see 279 F. Supp. 3d 401, 437 (EDNY 2018). \nIn  NAACP,  the  D. C.  District  Court  took  a  different  \ncourse.  In  April 2018, it deferred ruling on the equal pro-\ntection challenge but granted partial summary judgment to \nthe plaintiffs on their APA claim, holding that Acting Sec-\nretary Duke’s “conclusory statements were insufficient to \nexplain the change in [the agency’s] view of DACA’s lawful-\nness.”  298 F. Supp. 3d, at 243.  The District Court stayed \nits order for 90 days to permit DHS to “reissue a memoran-\ndum rescinding DACA, this time providing a fuller expla-\nnation for the determination that the program lacks statu-\ntory and constitutional authority.”  Id., at 245.  \n  Two months later, Duke’s successor, Secretary Kirstjen \nM. Nielsen, responded via memorandum.  App. to Pet. for\nCert. 120a–126a.  She explained that, “[h]aving considered \nthe Duke memorandum,” she “decline[d] to disturb” the re-\nscission. Id., at 121a.  Secretary Nielsen went on to articu-\nlate her “understanding” of Duke’s memorandum, identify-\ning  three  reasons  why,  in  Nielsen’s  estimation,  “the\ndecision to rescind the DACA policy was, and remains, \nsound.”  Ibid.  First, she reiterated that, “as the Attorney  \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nGeneral concluded, the DACA policy was contrary to law.”  \nId., at 122a. Second, she added that, regardless, the agency\nhad “serious doubts about [DACA’s] legality” and, for law \nenforcement reasons, wanted to avoid “legally questiona-\nble” policies.   Id., at 123a.  Third, she identified multiple \npolicy reasons for rescinding DACA, including (1) the belief \nthat any class-based immigration relief should come from \nCongress,  not  through  executive  non-enforcement;  (2)\nDHS’s preference for exercising prosecutorial discretion on \n“a truly individualized, case-by-case basis”; and (3) the im-\nportance of “project[ing] a message” that immigration laws \nwould be enforced against all classes and categories of al-\niens.  Id., at 123a–124a.  In her final paragraph, Secretary \nNielsen acknowledged the “asserted reliance interests” in \nDACA’s continuation but concluded that they did not “out-\nweigh the questionable legality of the DACA policy and the\nother reasons” for the rescission discussed in her memoran-\ndum.  Id., at 125a. \n  The Government asked the D. C. District Court to revise  \nits prior order in light of the reasons provided by Secretary \nNielsen, but the court declined.  In the court’s view, the new \nmemorandum, which “fail[ed] to elaborate meaningfully” \non the agency’s illegality rationale, still did not provide an \nadequate explanation for the September 2017 rescission.  \n315 F. Supp. 3d 457, 460, 473–474 (2018). \n  The Government appealed the various District Court de-\ncisions to the Second, Ninth, and D. C. Circuits, respec-\ntively.  In November 2018, while those appeals were pend-\ning, the Government simultaneously filed three petitions \nfor certiorari before judgment.  After the Ninth Circuit af-\nfirmed the nationwide injunction in  Regents, see 908 F. 3d  \n476 (2018), but before rulings from the other two Circuits, \nwe granted the petitions and consolidated the cases for ar-\ngument.  588 U. S. ___ (2019).  The issues raised here are  \n(1) whether  the  APA  claims  are  reviewable,  (2)  if  so, \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nwhether the rescission was arbitrary and capricious in vio-\nlation of the APA, and (3) whether the plaintiffs have stated \nan equal protection claim. \nII  \n  The dispute before the Court is not whether DHS may \nrescind DACA.  All parties agree that it may.  The dispute\nis instead primarily about the procedure the agency fol-\nlowed in doing so. \n  The APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal\nagencies are accountable to the public and their actions \nsubject to review by the courts.” Franklin v. Massachusetts, \n505 U. S. 788, 796 (1992).  It requires agencies to engage in\n“reasoned decisionmaking,” Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.  S.  \n743, 750 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted), and di-\nrects that agency actions be “set aside” if they are “arbi-\ntrary” or “capricious,” 5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A).  Under this \n“narrow standard of review, . . . a court is not  to substitute  \nits judgment for that of the agency,”  FCC v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502, 513 (2009) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted), but instead to assess only whether the de-\ncision was “based on a consideration of the relevant factors \nand whether there has been a clear error of judgment,” Cit-\nizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, \n416 (1971).\n  But before determining whether the rescission was arbi-\ntrary and capricious, we must first address the Govern-\nment’s contentions that DHS’s decision is unreviewable  \nunder the APA and outside this Court’s jurisdiction. \nA \n  The APA establishes  a “basic presumption of judicial \nreview [for] one ‘suffering legal wrong because of agency ac-\ntion.’”  Abbott Laboratories v.  Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140  \n \n(1967) (quoting §702).  That presumption can be rebutted \nby a showing that the relevant statute “preclude[s]” review,  \n \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n§701(a)(1),  or  that  the  “agency  action  is  committed  to \nagency discretion by law,” §701(a)(2).  The latter exception \nis at issue here. \n  To “honor the presumption of review, we have read the \nexception in §701(a)(2) quite narrowly,” Weyerhaeuser Co. \nv. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U. S. ___, ___ \n(2018) (slip op., at 12), confining it to those rare “adminis-\ntrative decision[s] traditionally left to agency discretion,”  \nLincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 191 (1993).  This limited cat-\negory of unreviewable actions includes an agency’s decision \nnot  to  institute  enforcement  proceedings,  Heckler  v.  \nChaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831–832 (1985), and it is on that ex-\nception that the Government primarily relies. \nIn  Chaney,  several  death-row  inmates  petitioned  the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) to take enforcement \naction against two States to prevent their use of certain \ndrugs for lethal injection.  The Court held that the FDA’s \ndenial of that petition was presumptively unreviewable in \nlight of the well-established “tradition” that “an agency’s \ndecision not to prosecute or enforce” is “generally commit-\nted to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Id.,  at 831.  We \nidentified a constellation of reasons that underpin this tra-\ndition. To start, a non-enforcement decision “often involves \na  complicated  balancing  of  a  number  of  factors  which  \nare  peculiarly  within  [the  agency’s]  expertise,”  such  as \n“whether the particular enforcement action requested best \nfits the agency’s overall policies.”  Ibid.  The decision also  \nmirrors, “to some extent,” a prosecutor’s decision not to in-\ndict, which has “long been regarded as the special province\nof the Executive Branch.”  Id., at 832.  And, as a practical \nmatter, “when an agency refuses to act” there is no action \nto “provide[] a focus for judicial review.”  Ibid. \n \n  The Government contends that a general non-enforcement \npolicy  is  equivalent  to  the  individual  non-enforcement \ndecision at issue in  Chaney.  In each case, the Government  \nargues, the agency must balance factors peculiarly within  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  11  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nits expertise, and does so in a manner akin to a criminal \nprosecutor.  Building on that premise, the Government ar-\ngues that the rescission of a non-enforcement policy is no  \ndifferent—for purposes of reviewability—from the adoption \nof that policy.  While the rescission may lead to increased \nenforcement, it does not, by itself, constitute a particular  \nenforcement action.  Applying this logic to the facts here, \nthe Government submits that DACA is a non-enforcement  \npolicy and that its rescission is therefore unreviewable. \n  But we need not test this chain of reasoning because \nDACA is not simply a non-enforcement policy.  For starters, \nthe DACA Memorandum did not merely “refus[e] to insti-\ntute proceedings” against a particular entity or even a par-\nticular class.   Ibid.  Instead, it directed USCIS to “establish  \na clear and efficient process” for identifying individuals who \nmet the enumerated criteria.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a.  \nBased on this directive, USCIS solicited applications from \neligible aliens, instituted a standardized review process, \nand sent formal notices indicating whether the alien would \nreceive the two-year forbearance.  These proceedings are ef-\nfectively “adjudicat[ions].”  Id., at 117a.  And the result of \nthese adjudications—DHS’s decision to “grant deferred ac-\ntion,” Brief for Petitioners 45—is an “affirmative act of ap-\nproval,” the very opposite of a “refus[al] to act,” Chaney, 470  \nU. S., at 831–832.  In short, the DACA Memorandum does \nnot announce a passive non-enforcement policy; it created \na program for conferring affirmative immigration relief.  \nThe creation of that program—and its rescission—is an “ac-\ntion [that] provides a focus for judicial review.”  Id., at 832. \n  The  benefits  attendant  to  deferred  action  provide \nfurther confirmation that DACA is more than simply a  \nnon-enforcement policy.  As described above, by virtue of \nreceiving deferred action, the 700,000 DACA recipients may \nrequest work authorization and are eligible for Social Secu-\nrity and Medicare.  See supra, at 3.  Unlike an agency’s re-\nfusal to take requested enforcement action, access to these \n \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \ntypes of benefits is an interest “courts often are called upon \nto protect.”  Chaney, 470 U. S., at 832.  See also Barnhart v.  \nThomas, 540 U. S. 20 (2003) (reviewing eligibility determi-\nnation for Social Security benefits).\n  Because the DACA program  is more than a non-enforce-\nment policy, its rescission is subject to review under the\nAPA.  \nB \n  The Government also invokes two jurisdictional provi-\nsions of the INA as independent bars to review.  Neither \napplies. \n  Section 1252(b)(9) bars review of claims arising from “ac-\ntion[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to remove an alien.”  66 \nStat. 209, as amended, 8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9).  That tar-\ngeted language is not aimed at this sort of case.  As we have  \nsaid before, §1252(b)(9) “does not present a jurisdictional \nbar” where those bringing suit “are not asking  for review of \nan order of removal,” “the decision . . . to seek removal,” or  \n“the process by which . .  . removability will be determined.”  \nJennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (plu-\nrality opinion) (slip op., at 10–11);  id., at ___ (BREYER, J., \ndissenting) (slip op., at 31).  And it is certainly not a bar\nwhere, as here, the parties are not challenging any removal \nproceedings.\n  Section 1252(g) is similarly narrow.  That provision limits \nreview of cases “arising from” decisions “to commence pro-\nceedings,  adjudicate  cases,  or  execute  removal  orders.”  \n§1252(g). We have previously rejected as “implausible” the \nGovernment’s suggestion that §1252(g) covers “all claims \narising from deportation proceedings” or imposes “a general \njurisdictional  limitation.”    Reno  v.  American-Arab  Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471, 482 (1999).  The re-\nscission, which revokes a deferred action program with as-\nsociated benefits, is not a decision to “commence proceed-\nings,”  much  less  to  “adjudicate”  a  case  or  “execute”  a  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nremoval order. \n  With these preliminary arguments out of the way, we \nproceed to the merits. \nIII  \nA \n  Deciding  whether  agency  action  was  adequately  ex-\nplained  requires,  first,  knowing  where  to  look  for  the \nagency’s explanation. The natural starting point here is the \nexplanation provided by Acting Secretary Duke when she \nannounced the rescission in September 2017. But the Gov-\nernment urges us to go on and consider the June 2018 mem-\norandum submitted by Secretary Nielsen as well.  That  \nmemo was prepared after the D. C. District Court vacated  \nthe Duke rescission and gave DHS an opportunity to “reis-\nsue a memorandum rescinding DACA, this time providing \na fuller explanation for the determination that the program \nlacks statutory and constitutional authority.”  298 F. Supp. \n3d, at 245. According to the Government, the Nielsen Mem-\norandum is properly before us because it was invited by the \nDistrict Court and reflects the views of the Secretary of  \nHomeland Security—the official responsible for immigra-\ntion policy. Respondents disagree, arguing that the Nielsen \nMemorandum, issued nine months after the rescission, im-\npermissibly asserts prudential and policy reasons not relied \nupon by Duke. \n  It is a “foundational principle of administrative law” that \njudicial review of agency action is limited to “the grounds \nthat the agency invoked when it took the action.”  Michigan, \n576 U. S., at 758.  If those grounds are inadequate, a court \nmay remand for the agency to do one of two things: First, \nthe agency can offer “a fuller explanation of  the agency’s \nreasoning at the time of the agency action.” Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 654  \n(1990)  (emphasis  added).  See  also  Alpharma,  Inc.  v.  \n \n\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nLeavitt, 460 F. 3d 1, 5–6 (CADC 2006) (Garland, J.) (per-\nmitting an agency to provide an “amplified articulation” of \na prior “conclusory” observation (internal quotation marks \nomitted)).  This route has important limitations.  When  an  \nagency’s initial explanation “indicate[s] the determinative \nreason for the final action taken,” the agency may elaborate \nlater on that reason (or reasons) but may not provide new \nones. Camp v. Pitts, 411 U. S. 138, 143 (1973) (per curiam).  \nAlternatively,  the  agency  can  “deal  with  the  problem\nafresh” by taking new agency action.  SEC v. Chenery Corp., \n332 U. S. 194, 201 (1947) (Chenery II).  An agency taking \nthis route is not limited to its prior reasons but must comply \nwith the procedural requirements for new agency action. \n  The District Court’s remand thus presented DHS with a \nchoice: rest on the Duke Memorandum while elaborating on \nits prior reasoning, or issue a new rescission bolstered by \nnew reasons absent from the Duke Memorandum.  Secre-\ntary Nielsen took the first path. Rather than making a new\ndecision, she “decline[d] to disturb the Duke memoran-\ndum’s rescission” and instead “provide[d] further explana-\ntion” for that action.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 121a.  Indeed,  \nthe Government’s subsequent request for reconsideration \ndescribed the Nielsen Memorandum as “additional expla-\nnation for [Duke’s] decision” and asked the District Court \nto “leave in  place [Duke’s] September 5, 2017 decision to re-\nscind the DACA policy.”  Motion to Revise Order in No. 17– \ncv–1907 etc. (D DC), pp. 2, 19. Contrary to the position of \nthe  Government  before  this  Court,  and  of  JUSTICE  \nKAVANAUGH in dissent, post, at 4 (opinion concurring in \njudgment in part and dissenting in part), the Nielsen Mem-\norandum was by its own terms not a new rule implementing \na new policy.\n  Because Secretary Nielsen chose to elaborate on the rea-\nsons for the initial rescission rather than take new admin-\nistrative action, she was limited to the agency’s original rea-\nsons, and her explanation “must be viewed critically” to  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nensure that the rescission is not upheld on the basis of im-\npermissible “post hoc rationalization.”  Overton Park, 401 \nU. S., at 420.  But despite purporting to explain the Duke \nMemorandum, Secretary Nielsen’s reasoning bears little \nrelationship to that of her predecessor.  Acting Secretary \nDuke  rested the rescission on the conclusion that DACA is \nunlawful.  Period.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.  By con-\ntrast, Secretary Nielsen’s new memorandum offered three \n“separate and independently sufficient reasons” for the re-\nscission, id., at 122a, only the first of which is the conclusion \nthat DACA is illegal. \n  Her second reason is that DACA is, at minimum, legally \nquestionable and should be terminated to maintain public\nconfidence in the rule of law and avoid burdensome litiga-\ntion.  No such justification can be found in the Duke Mem-\norandum. Legal uncertainty is, of course, related to illegal-\nity.  But the two justifications are meaningfully distinct, \nespecially in this context.  While an agency might, for one \nreason or another, choose to do nothing in the face of uncer-\ntainty, illegality presumably requires remedial action of \nsome sort.  \n  The policy reasons that Secretary Nielsen cites as a third \nbasis for the rescission are also nowhere to be found in the \nDuke Memorandum.  That document makes no mention of \na preference for legislative fixes, the superiority of case-by-\ncase decisionmaking, the importance of sending a message \nof robust enforcement, or any other policy consideration.  \nNor are these points included in the legal analysis from the \nFifth Circuit and the Attorney General.  They can be viewed\nonly as impermissible post hoc rationalizations and thus  \nare not properly before us.\n  The Government, echoed by JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, pro-\ntests that requiring a new decision before considering Niel-\nsen’s new justifications would be “an idle and useless for-\nmality.”  NLRB  v. Wyman-Gordon  Co., 394 U. S. 759, 766, \n \n\n16   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \nn. 6 (1969) (plurality opinion).  See also post,  at 5.  Proce-\ndural requirements can often seem such. But here the rule \nserves important values of administrative law.  Requiring \na new decision before considering new reasons promotes \n“agency accountability,” Bowen v. American Hospital Assn., \n476 U. S. 610, 643 (1986), by ensuring that parties and the \npublic can respond fully and in a timely manner to an \nagency’s exercise of authority.  Considering only contempo-\nraneous explanations for agency action also instills confi-\ndence that the reasons given are not simply “convenient lit-\nigating position[s].”  Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham  \nCorp., 567 U. S. 142, 155 (2012) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Permitting agencies to invoke belated justifica-\ntions, on the other hand, can upset “the orderly functioning \nof the process of review,” SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. \n80, 94 (1943), forcing both litigants and courts to chase a\nmoving target.  Each of these values would be markedly un-\ndermined were we to allow DHS to rely on reasons offered \nnine months after Duke announced the rescission and after \nthree different courts had identified flaws in the original \nexplanation.\nJUSTICE  KAVANAUGH  asserts  that  this  “foundational \nprinciple of administrative law,” Michigan, 576 U. S., at \n758, actually limits only what lawyers may argue, not what \nagencies may do. Post, at 5.  While it is true that the Court \nhas often rejected justifications belatedly advanced by ad-\nvocates, we refer to this as a prohibition on post hoc ration-\nalizations, not advocate rationalizations, because the prob-\nlem is the timing, not the speaker.  The functional reasons \nfor  requiring  contemporaneous  explanations  apply  with \nequal force regardless whether post hoc justifications are \nraised in court by those appearing on behalf of the agency\nor by agency officials themselves.  See American Textile  \nMfrs. Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U. S. 490, 539 (1981) \n(“[T]he post hoc rationalizations of the agency . . . cannot \nserve as a sufficient predicate for agency action.”); Overton  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  17  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nPark, 401 U. S., at 419 (rejecting “litigation affidavits” from \nagency officials as “merely ‘post hoc’ rationalizations”).3  \n  Justice Holmes famously wrote that “[m]en must turn  \nsquare corners when they deal with the Government.” Rock \nIsland, A. & L. R. Co. v. United States, 254 U. S. 141, 143  \n(1920).  But it is also true, particularly when so much is at \nstake, that “the Government should turn square corners in \ndealing with the people.”  St. Regis Paper Co. v. United \nStates, 368 U. S. 208, 229 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting).  The \nbasic rule here is clear: An agency must defend its actions \nbased on the reasons it gave when it acted.  This is not the  \ncase for cutting corners to allow DHS to rely upon reasons \nabsent from its original decision.  \nB \n  We turn, finally, to whether DHS’s decision to rescind \nDACA  was arbitrary and capricious.  As noted earlier, Act-\ning Secretary Duke’s justification for the rescission was suc-\ncinct: “Taking into consideration” the Fifth Circuit’s conclu-\nsion that DAPA was unlawful because it conferred benefits \nin violation of the INA, and the Attorney General’s conclu-\nsion that DACA was unlawful for the same reason, she \nconcluded—without elaboration—that the “DACA program \nshould be terminated.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.4  \n—————— \n3  JUSTICE  KAVANAUGH further argues that the contemporaneous expla-\nnation  requirement  applies  only  to  agency  adjudications,  not  rule-\nmakings.  Post,  at 5–6 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis-\nsenting in part).  But he  cites no  authority limiting this basic principle—\nwhich the Court regularly articulates in the context of rulemakings—to \nadjudications.  The Government does not even raise this unheralded ar-\ngument.  \n4The Government contends that Acting Secretary Duke  also focused \n \non litigation risk.  Although the background section of her memo refer-\nences a letter from the Texas Attorney General threatening to challenge \nDACA, the memo never asserts that the rescission was intended to avert \nlitigation.  And, given the Attorney General’s conclusion that the policy \nwas unlawful—and thus presumably could not be maintained or de-\nfended in its current form—it is difficult to see how the risk of litigation  \n \n\n18   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Respondents maintain that this explanation is deficient \nfor three reasons.  Their first and second arguments work \nin tandem, claiming that the Duke Memorandum does not \nadequately explain the conclusion that DACA is unlawful,  \nand that this conclusion is, in any event, wrong.  While \nthose arguments carried the day in the lower courts, in our \nview they overlook an important constraint on Acting Sec-\nretary Duke’s decisionmaking authority—she was bound by\nthe Attorney General’s legal determination. \n  The same statutory provision that establishes the Secre-\ntary of Homeland Security’s authority to administer and en-\nforce immigration laws limits that authority, specifying \nthat, with respect to “all questions of law,” the determina-\ntions of the Attorney General “shall be controlling.”  8 \nU. S. C. §1103(a)(1).  Respondents are aware of this con-\nstraint.  Indeed they emphasized the point in the reviewa-\nbility sections of their briefs.  But in their merits argu-\nments, respondents never addressed whether or how this \nunique statutory provision might affect our review.  They\ndid not discuss whether Duke was required to explain a le-\ngal conclusion that was not hers to make.  Nor  did they dis-\ncuss whether the current suits challenging Duke’s rescis-\nsion decision, which everyone agrees was within her legal \nauthority under the INA, are proper vehicles for attacking \nthe Attorney General’s legal conclusion. \n  Because of these gaps in respondents’ briefing, we do not\nevaluate the claims challenging the explanation and cor-\nrectness of the illegality conclusion.  Instead we focus our \nattention on respondents’ third argument—that Acting Sec-\nretary Duke “failed to consider . . . important aspect[s] of\nthe  problem”  before  her.  Motor  Vehicle  Mfrs.  Assn.  of \nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., \n463 U. S. 29, 43 (1983). \n—————— \ncarried any independent weight.  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  19  \n \nOpinion of the Court \n  Whether DACA is illegal is, of course, a legal determina-\ntion, and therefore a question for the Attorney General.  But \ndeciding how best to address a finding of illegality moving \nforward can involve important policy choices, especially \nwhen the finding concerns a program with the breadth of \nDACA.  Those policy choices are for DHS. \n  Acting Secretary Duke plainly exercised such discretion-\nary authority in winding down the program.  See App. to\nPet. for Cert. 117a–118a (listing the Acting Secretary’s de-\ncisions on eight transition issues).   Among other things, she \nspecified that those DACA recipients whose benefits were \nset to expire within six months were eligible for two-year \nrenewals.  Ibid. \n  But Duke did not appear to appreciate the full scope of \nher discretion, which picked up where the Attorney Gen-\neral’s legal reasoning left off.  The Attorney General con-\ncluded that “the DACA policy has the same legal . . . defects \nthat the courts recognized as to DAPA.”  App. 878.  So, to \nunderstand those defects, we look to the Fifth Circuit, the  \nhighest court to offer a reasoned opinion on the legality \nof DAPA.  That court described the “core” issue before it as \nthe “Secretary’s decision” to grant “eligibility for benefits”—\nincluding  work  authorization,  Social  Security,  and \nMedicare—to unauthorized aliens on “a class-wide basis.”   \nTexas, 809  F. 3d, at 170; see id., at 148, 184. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit’s focus on these benefits was central to every stage of \nits analysis.  See id., at 155 (standing); id., at 163 (zone of\ninterest); id., at 164 (applicability of §1252(g));  id., at 166 \n(reviewability); id., at 176–177 (notice and comment); id., at  \n184 (substantive APA).  And the Court ultimately held that \nDAPA was “manifestly contrary to  the INA” precisely be-\ncause it “would make 4.3 million otherwise removable al-\niens” eligible for work authorization and public benefits.  \nId., at 181–182 (internal quotation marks omitted).5  \n—————— \n5As the Fifth Circuit noted, DAPA recipients were eligible for Social  \n \n \n\n20   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  But there is more to DAPA (and DACA) than such bene-\nfits.  The defining feature of deferred action is the decision \nto defer removal (and to notify the affected alien of that de-\ncision). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 99a.  And the Fifth Circuit  \nwas careful to distinguish that forbearance component from \neligibility for benefits. As it explained, the “challenged por-\ntion of DAPA’s deferred-action program” was the decision \nto make DAPA recipients eligible for benefits.  See Texas, \n809 F. 3d, at 168, and n. 108.  The other “[p]art of DAPA,” \nthe court noted, “involve[d] the Secretary’s decision—at \nleast temporarily—not to enforce the immigration laws as \nto a class of what he deem[ed] to be low-priority illegal al-\niens.”  Id., at 166.  Borrowing from this Court’s prior de-\nscription of deferred action, the Fifth Circuit observed that \n“the states do not challenge the Secretary’s decision to ‘de-\ncline to institute proceedings, terminate proceedings, or de-\ncline to execute a final order of deportation.’”  Id., at 168 \n \n(quoting Reno, 525 U. S., at 484).  And the Fifth Circuit un-\nderscored that nothing in its decision or the preliminary in-\njunction “requires the Secretary  to remove any alien or to\nalter” the Secretary’s class-based “enforcement priorities.”   \nTexas, 809 F. 3d, at 166, 169.  In other words, the Secre-\ntary’s forbearance authority was unimpaired. \n  Acting Secretary Duke recognized that the Fifth Circuit’s \nholding addressed the benefits associated with DAPA.  In  \nher memorandum she explained that the Fifth Circuit con-\n—————— \nSecurity and Medicare benefits because they had been designated “law-\nfully present.” Texas, 809 F. 3d, at 168.  Lawful presence is a statutory  \nprerequisite for receipt of  certain benefits.  See id., at 148 (citing 8  \nU. S. C. §1611).  It is not the same as forbearance nor does it flow inexo-\nrably from forbearance.  Thus, while deferred action recipients have been \ndesignated lawfully present for purposes of Social Security and Medicare \neligibility, see 8 CFR §1.3; 42 CFR §417.422(h), agencies can also exclude \nthem from this designation, see 45 CFR §152.2(8) (2019) (specifying that \nDACA recipients are not considered lawfully present for purposes of cov-\nerage under the Affordable Care Act). \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  21  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ncluded that DAPA “conflicted with the discretion author-\nized by Congress” because the INA “‘flatly does not permit \n \nthe reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully\npresent and thereby make them newly eligible for a host of \nfederal and state benefits, including work authorization.’”  \n \nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 114a (quoting Texas, 809 F. 3d, at  \n184).  Duke did not characterize the opinion as one about \nforbearance. \n  In short, the Attorney General neither addressed the for-\nbearance policy at the heart of DACA nor compelled DHS \nto abandon that policy.  Thus, removing benefits eligibility \nwhile continuing forbearance remained squarely within the \ndiscretion of Acting Secretary Duke, who was responsible \nfor “[e]stablishing national immigration enforcement poli-\ncies and priorities.” 116 Stat. 2178, 6 U. S. C. §202(5).  But \nDuke’s memo offers no reason  for terminating forbearance.  \nShe instead treated the Attorney General’s conclusion re-\ngarding the illegality of benefits as sufficient to rescind both \nbenefits and forbearance, without explanation. \n  That reasoning repeated the error we identified in one of \nour leading modern administrative law cases, Motor Vehicle \nManufacturers Association of the United States, Inc. v. State \nFarm  Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.  There, the Na-\ntional  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA) \npromulgated a requirement that motor vehicles produced \nafter 1982 be equipped with one of two passive restraints: \nairbags or automatic seatbelts.  463 U. S., at 37–38, 46.  \nFour years later, before the requirement went into effect, \nNHTSA concluded that automatic seatbelts, the restraint of  \nchoice for most manufacturers, would not provide effective \nprotection.  Based on that premise, NHTSA rescinded the \npassive restraint requirement in full.  Id., at 38. \n  We concluded that the total rescission was arbitrary and \ncapricious.  As we explained, NHTSA’s justification sup-\nported only “disallow[ing] compliance by means of ” auto-\n \nmatic seatbelts.  Id., at 47.  It did “not cast doubt” on the  \n \n\n22   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n“efficacy  of  airbag  technology”  or  upon  “the  need  for  a \npassive restraint standard.”  Ibid.  Given NHTSA’s prior \njudgment that “airbags are an effective and cost-beneficial \nlifesaving  technology,”  we  held  that  “the  mandatory\npassive restraint rule [could] not be abandoned without any \nconsideration whatsoever of an airbags-only requirement.”  \nId., at 51. \n  While the factual setting is different here, the error is the \nsame.  Even if it is illegal for DHS to extend work authori-\nzation and other benefits to DACA recipients, that conclu-\nsion supported only “disallow[ing]” benefits.  Id., at 47.  It \ndid “not cast doubt” on the legality of forbearance or upon \nDHS’s original reasons for extending forbearance to child-\nhood arrivals.  Ibid.  Thus, given DHS’s earlier judgment \nthat  forbearance  is  “especially  justified”  for  “productive  \nyoung  people”  who  were  brought  here  as  children  \nand “know only this country as home,”  App. to Pet. for \nCert. 98a–99a, the DACA Memorandum could not be re-\nscinded in full “without any consideration whatsoever” of a \nforbearance-only policy, State Farm, 463 U. S., at 51.6  \n  The Government acknowledges that “[d]eferred action \ncoupled with the associated benefits are the two legs upon \nwhich the DACA policy stands.”  Reply Brief 21.  It insists, \nhowever, that “DHS was not required to consider whether \nDACA’s illegality could be addressed by separating” the \n—————— \n6The three-page memorandum that established DACA is devoted en-\n \ntirely to forbearance, save for one sentence directing USCIS  to “deter-\nmine whether [DACA recipients] qualify for work authorization.”  App. \nto Pet. for Cert. 101a.  The benefits associated with DACA flow from a  \nseparate  regulation.  See  8  CFR  §1.3(a)(4)(vi);  see  also  42  CFR \n§417.422(h) (cross-referencing 8 CFR §1.3).  Thus, DHS could have ad-\ndressed the Attorney General’s determination that such benefits were \nimpermissible under the INA by amending 8 CFR §1.3 to exclude DACA \nrecipients from those benefits without rescinding the DACA Memoran-\ndum and the  forbearance policy it established.  But Duke’s rescission  \nmemo shows no cognizance of this possibility. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  23  \n \nOpinion of the Court \ntwo.  Ibid.   According to the Government, “It was not arbi-\ntrary and capricious for DHS to view deferred action and its \ncollateral benefits as importantly linked.”  Ibid.  Perhaps.  \nBut that response misses the point. The fact that there may \nbe a valid reason not to separate deferred action from ben-\nefits does not establish that DHS considered that option or \nthat such consideration was unnecessary. \n  The lead dissent acknowledges that forbearance and ben-\nefits are legally distinct and can be decoupled.  Post, at 21– \n22, n. 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J). It contends, however, that \nwe should not “dissect” agency action “piece by piece.”  Post,  \nat 21.  The dissent instead rests on the Attorney General’s\nlegal determination—which considered only benefits—“to \nsupply the ‘reasoned analysis’” to support rescission of both \n \nbenefits and forbearance.  Post, at 22 (quoting State Farm, \n463 U. S., at 42).  But State Farm teaches that when an  \nagency rescinds a prior policy its reasoned analysis must \nconsider the “alternative[s]” that are “within the ambit of \nthe existing [policy].”  Id., at 51.  Here forbearance was not \nsimply “within the ambit of the existing [policy],” it was the \ncenterpiece of the policy: DACA, after all, stands for “De-\nferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.”  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n111a (emphasis added).  But the rescission memorandum  \ncontains no discussion of forbearance or the option of retain-\ning forbearance without benefits.  Duke “entirely failed to \nconsider [that] important aspect of the problem.”  State \nFarm, 463 U. S., at 43.  \n  That omission alone renders Acting  Secretary Duke’s de-\ncision arbitrary and capricious.  But it is not the only defect.   \nDuke also failed to address whether there was “legitimate \nreliance” on the DACA Memorandum.  Smiley v. Citibank  \n(South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742 (1996).  When  an \nagency changes course, as DHS did here, it must “be cogni-\nzant that longstanding policies may have ‘engendered seri-\nous reliance interests that must be taken into account.’” \n \nEncino Motorcars, LLC  v. Navarro, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) \n \n\n24   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n(slip op., at 9) (quoting Fox Television, 556 U. S., at 515).  “It \nwould be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters.”   \nId., at 515.  Yet that is what the Duke Memorandum did. \n  For its part, the Government does not contend that Duke \nconsidered potential reliance interests; it counters that she \ndid not need to.  In the Government’s view, shared by the \nlead dissent, DACA recipients have no “legally cognizable \nreliance interests” because the DACA Memorandum stated  \nthat the program “conferred no substantive rights” and pro-\nvided benefits only in two-year increments. Reply Brief 16–\n17; App. to Pet. for Cert. 125a. See also post, at 23–24 (opin-\nion of THOMAS, J). But neither the Government nor the lead  \ndissent cites any legal authority establishing that such fea-\ntures automatically preclude reliance interests, and we are \nnot aware of any. These disclaimers are surely pertinent in \nconsidering the strength of any reliance interests, but that\nconsideration must be undertaken by the agency in the first \ninstance, subject to normal APA review.  There was no such  \nconsideration in the Duke Memorandum. \n  Respondents and their amici assert that there was much \nfor DHS to consider.  They stress that, since 2012, DACA\nrecipients have “enrolled in degree programs, embarked on \ncareers, started businesses, purchased homes, and even  \nmarried and had children, all in reliance” on the DACA pro-\ngram.  Brief for Respondent Regents of Univ. of California \net al. in No. 18–587, p.  41 (Brief for Regents).  The conse-\nquences of the rescission, respondents emphasize, would \n“radiate outward” to DACA recipients’ families, including \ntheir 200,000 U. S.-citizen children, to the schools where \nDACA recipients study and teach, and to the employers who\nhave invested time and money in training them. See id., at \n41–42; Brief for Respondent State of New York et al. in No. \n18–589, p. 42 (Brief for New York).  See also Brief for 143 \nBusinesses as Amici Curiae 17 (estimating that hiring and\ntraining replacements would cost employers $6.3 billion).  \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  25  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nIn addition, excluding DACA recipients from the lawful la-\nbor force may, they tell us, result in the loss of $215 billion \nin economic activity and an associated $60 billion in federal \ntax revenue over the next ten years.  Brief for Regents 6.  \nMeanwhile, States and local governments could lose $1.25 \nbillion in tax revenue each year.  Ibid.  \n  These are certainly noteworthy concerns, but they are not \nnecessarily dispositive.  To the Government and lead dis-\nsent’s point, DHS could respond that reliance on forbear-\nance and benefits was unjustified in light of the express lim-\nitations in the DACA Memorandum.  Or it might conclude \nthat reliance interests in benefits that it views as unlawful \nare entitled to no or diminished weight.  And, even if DHS \nultimately concludes that the reliance interests rank as se-\nrious, they are but one factor to consider.  DHS may deter-\nmine, in the particular context before it, that other interests \nand policy concerns outweigh any reliance interests.  Mak-\ning that difficult decision was the agency’s  job, but the \nagency failed to do it.\n  DHS has considerable flexibility in carrying out its re-\nsponsibility.  The wind-down here is a good example of the \nkind of options available.  Acting Secretary Duke author-\nized DHS to process two-year renewals for those DACA re-\ncipients  whose  benefits  were  set  to  expire  within  six \nmonths.  But Duke’s consideration was solely for the pur-\npose of assisting the agency in dealing with “administrative \ncomplexities.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 116a–118a.  She should \nhave considered whether she had similar flexibility in ad-\ndressing any reliance interests of DACA recipients.  The \nlead dissent contends that accommodating such interests \nwould be “another exercise of unlawful power,” post, at 23 \n(opinion of THOMAS, J.), but the Government does not make\nthat argument and DHS has already extended benefits for \npurposes other than reliance, following consultation with \nthe Office of the Attorney General.  App. to Pet. for Cert.  \n116a. \n \n\n26   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of the Court \n  Had Duke considered reliance interests, she might, for \nexample, have considered a broader renewal period based\non the need for DACA recipients to reorder their affairs.  Al-\nternatively, Duke might have considered more accommo-\ndating termination dates for recipients caught in the mid-\ndle of a time-bounded commitment, to allow them to, say, \ngraduate from their course of study, complete their military \nservice, or finish a medical treatment regimen.  Or she  \nmight have instructed immigration officials to give salient \nweight to any reliance interests engendered by DACA when \nexercising individualized enforcement discretion.\n  To be clear, DHS was not required to do any of this or to \n“consider all policy alternatives in reaching [its] decision.”  \nState Farm, 463 U. S., at 51.  Agencies are not compelled to\nexplore “every alternative device and thought conceivable \nby the mind of man.” Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, \n551 (1978).  But, because DHS was “not writing on a blank \nslate,” post, at 22, n. 14 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), it was re-\nquired to assess whether there were reliance interests, de-\ntermine whether they were significant, and weigh any such \ninterests against competing policy concerns.\n  The lead dissent sees all the foregoing differently.  In its \nview, DACA is illegal, so any actions under DACA are them-\nselves illegal.  Such actions, it argues, must cease immedi-\nately and the APA should not be construed to impede that \nresult.  See post, at 19–23 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n  The dissent is correct that DACA was rescinded because \nof  the  Attorney  General’s  illegality  determination.    See  \nante, at 20.  But nothing about that determination fore-\nclosed or even addressed the options of retaining forbear-\nance or accommodating particular reliance interests.  Act-\ning Secretary Duke should have considered those matters \nbut did not.  That failure was arbitrary and capricious in \nviolation of the APA. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

J. \nIV \n  Lastly, we turn to respondents’ claim that the rescis-\nsion violates the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth \nAmendment. \n  The parties dispute the proper framing of this claim.  The  \nGovernment contends that the allegation that the Execu-\ntive, motivated by animus, ended a program that dispropor-\ntionately benefits certain ethnic groups is a selective en-\nforcement claim.  Such a claim, the Government asserts,  \nis barred by our decision in Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee.  See 525 U. S., at 488 (holding \nthat “an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitu-\ntional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense \nagainst his deportation”).  Respondents counter that their \nclaim falls outside the scope of that precedent because they \nare not challenging individual enforcement proceedings.  \nWe need not resolve this debate because, even if the claim \nis cognizable, the allegations here are insufficient. \n  To plead animus, a plaintiff must raise a plausible infer-\nence that an “invidious discriminatory purpose was a moti-\nvating factor” in the relevant decision.  Arlington Heights v.  \nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, \n266 (1977). Possible evidence includes disparate impact on \na particular group, “[d]epartures from the normal proce-\ndural sequence,” and “contemporary statements by mem-\nbers of the decisionmaking body.”  Id., at 266–268.  Track-\ning  these  factors,  respondents  allege  that  animus  is\nevidenced by (1) the disparate impact of the rescission on \nLatinos from Mexico, who represent 78% of DACA recipi-\nents; (2) the unusual history behind the rescission; and \n(3) pre- and post-election statements by President Trump.  \nBrief for New York 54–55. \n  None of these points, either singly or in concert, estab-\nlishes a plausible equal protection claim.  First, because \nLatinos make up a large share of the unauthorized alien\npopulation, one would expect them to make up an outsized \n \n\n28   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpOinpiionnio onf  oRfO tBhEeR CTSo,u  Crt.   J. \nshare of recipients of any cross-cutting immigration relief  \nprogram. See B. Baker, DHS, Office of Immigration Statis-\ntics,  Population  Estimates,  Illegal  Alien  Population \nResiding in the United States: January 2015, Table 2 (Dec. \n2018),  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/\n18_1214_PLCY_pops-est-report.pdf.  Were this fact suffi-\ncient to state a claim, virtually any generally applicable im-\nmigration policy could be challenged on equal protection \ngrounds. \n  Second, there is nothing irregular about the history lead-\ning up to the September 2017 rescission.  The lower courts  \nconcluded that “DACA received reaffirmation by [DHS] as \nrecently as three months before the rescission,” 908 F. 3d, \nat 519 (quoting 298 F. Supp. 3d, at 1315), referring to the \nJune 2017 DAPA rescission memo, which stated that DACA \nwould “remain in effect,” App. 870.  But this reasoning con-\nfuses abstention with reaffirmation.  The DAPA memo did \nnot address the merits of the DACA policy or its legality.  \nThus, when the Attorney General later determined that \nDACA  shared  DAPA’s  legal  defects,  DHS’s  decision  to  \nreevaluate DACA was not a “strange about-face.”  908 F. 3d,  \nat 519.  It was a natural response to a newly identified \nproblem.\n  Finally, the cited statements are unilluminating.  The  \nrelevant actors were most directly Acting Secretary Duke \nand the Attorney General.  As the Batalla Vidal court  \nacknowledged, respondents did not “identif[y] statements\nby [either] that would give rise to an inference of discrimi-\nnatory motive.”  291 F. Supp. 3d, at 278. Instead, respond-\nents contend that President Trump made critical state-\nments  about  Latinos  that  evince  discriminatory  intent.  \nBut,  even  as  interpreted  by  respondents,  these  state-\nments—remote in time and made in unrelated contexts— \ndo not qualify as “contemporary statements” probative of \nthe decision at issue.  Arlington Heights, 429 U. S., at 268.   \nThus, like respondents’ other points, the statements fail to \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  29  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nraise a plausible inference that the rescission was moti-\nvated by animus. \n*  *  * \n  We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are \nsound policies.  “The wisdom” of those decisions “is none of \nour concern.”  Chenery  II, 332 U. S., at 207.  We address \nonly whether the agency complied with the procedural re-\nquirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its ac-\ntion. Here the agency failed to consider the conspicuous is-\nsues of whether to retain forbearance and what if anything \nto do about the hardship to DACA recipients.  That dual  \nfailure raises doubts about whether the agency appreciated \nthe scope of its discretion or exercised that discretion in a \nreasonable manner.  The appropriate recourse is therefore \nto remand to DHS so that it may consider the problem  \nanew. \n  The judgment in NAACP, No. 18–588, is affirmed.7  The  \njudgment in Regents, No. 18–587, is vacated in part and re-\nversed in part.  And in Batalla Vidal, No. 18–589, the Feb-\nruary 13, 2018 order granting respondents’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction is vacated, the November 9, 2017 or-\nder partially denying the Government’s motion to dismiss \nis affirmed in part, and the March  29, 2018 order partially \ndenying the balance of the Government’s motion to dismiss \nis reversed in part. All three cases are remanded for further  \nproceedings consistent with this opinion.  \n \nIt is so ordered.  \n—————— \n7Our affirmance of the  NAACP order vacating the rescission makes it \n \nunnecessary to examine the propriety of the nationwide scope of the in-\njunctions issued by the District Courts in  Regents and Batalla Vidal. \n \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \n  The majority rightly holds that the Department of Home-\nland Security (DHS) violated the Administrative Procedure \nAct in rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arri-\nvals (DACA) program.  But the Court forecloses any chal-\nlenge to the rescission under the Equal Protection Clause.  \nI believe that determination is unwarranted on the existing \nrecord and premature at this stage of the litigation.  I would \ninstead permit respondents to develop their equal protec-\ntion claims on remand. \n  Respondents’ equal protection challenges come to us in  a \npreliminary posture.  All that respondents needed to do at \nthis stage of the litigation was state sufficient facts that \nwould “allo[w a] court to draw the reasonable inference that \n[a] defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft  \nv. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662,  678 (2009).  The three courts to eval-\nuate respondents’ pleadings below held that they cleared \nthis modest threshold.  908 F. 3d 476, 518–520 (CA9 2018) \n(affirming the District Court’s denial of the Government’s \nmotion to dismiss); see also Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 291 F. \nSupp. 3d 260, 274 (EDNY 2018). \n  I too would permit respondents’ claims to proceed on re-\nmand.  The complaints each set forth particularized facts \nthat plausibly allege discriminatory animus.  The plurality \ndisagrees, reasoning that “[n]one of these points, either sin-\ngly or in concert, establishes a plausible equal protection \nclaim.”  Ante, at 27.  But it reaches that conclusion by dis-\ncounting some allegations altogether and by narrowly view-\ning the rest.\n  First, the plurality dismisses the statements that Presi-\ndent Trump made both  before and after he assumed office.  \nThe  Batalla  Vidal  complaints  catalog  then-candidate \nTrump’s declarations that Mexican immigrants are “people \nthat have lots of problems,” “the bad ones,” and “criminals, \ndrug dealers, [and] rapists.” 291 F.  Supp. 3d, at 276 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).  The Regents complaints ad-\n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \nditionally quote President Trump’s 2017 statement compar-\ning undocumented immigrants to “animals” responsible for \n“the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling \nand trafficking, [and] MS13.”  298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1314 \n(ND Cal. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \nplurality brushes these aside as “unilluminating,” “remote \nin time,” and having been “made in unrelated contexts.”  \nAnte, at 28.  \n  But “nothing in our precedent supports [the] blinkered \napproach” of disregarding any of the campaign statements \nas remote in time from later-enacted policies.  Trump v. Ha-\nwaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2018) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dis-\nsenting) (slip op., at 11, n. 3).  Nor did any of the statements \narise in unrelated contexts.  They bear on unlawful migra-\ntion from Mexico—a keystone of President Trump’s cam-\npaign and a policy priority of his administration—and, ac-\ncording to respondents, were an animating force behind the \nrescission of DACA. Cf. ibid. (noting that Presidential Proc-\nlamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (2017), which barred \nentry of individuals from several Muslim-majority coun-\ntries, was an outgrowth of the President’s campaign state-\nments about Muslims).  Taken together, “the words of the \nPresident” help to “create the strong perception” that the \nrescission  decision  was  “contaminated  by  impermissible \ndiscriminatory  animus.”  585  U. S.,  at  ___  (opinion  of  \nSOTOMAYOR, J.) (slip op., at 13).  This perception provides\nrespondents with grounds to litigate their equal protection \nclaims further. \n  Next, the plurality minimizes the disproportionate im-\npact of the rescission decision on Latinos after considering \nthis point in isolation. Ante, at 28 (“Were this fact sufficient \nto state a claim, virtually any generally applicable immi-\ngration  policy  could  be  challenged  on  equal  protection\ngrounds”).  But the impact of the policy decision must be \nviewed in the context of the President’s public statements \non and off the campaign trail.  At the motion-to-dismiss \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J. \nstage, I would not so readily dismiss the allegation that an \nexecutive decision disproportionately harms the same ra-\ncial group that the President branded as less desirable mere \nmonths earlier. \n  Finally, the plurality finds nothing untoward in the “spe-\ncific sequence of events leading up to the challenged deci-\nsion.”  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop-\nment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 267 (1977).  I disagree.  As late  \nas  June  2017,  DHS  insisted  it  remained  committed  to \nDACA, even while rescinding a related program, the De-\nferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Perma-\nnent Residents.  App. 718–720.  But a mere three months  \nlater,  DHS  terminated  DACA  without,  as  the  plurality \nacknowledges, considering important aspects of the termi-\nnation.  The abrupt change in position plausibly suggests \nthat something other than questions about the legality of \nDACA motivated the rescission decision.  Accordingly, it \nraises the possibility of a “significant mismatch between the \ndecision . . . made and the rationale . . . provided.”  Depart-\nment of Commerce  v.  New York, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) \n(slip op., at 26).  Only by bypassing context does the plural-\nity conclude otherwise. \n*  *  * \n  The facts in respondents’ complaints create more than a\n“sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  \nIqbal, 556 U. S., at 678.  Whether they ultimately amount \nto actionable discrimination should be determined only af-\nter factual development on remand.  Because the Court  \nprematurely  disposes  of  respondents’  equal  protection \nclaims by overlooking the strength of their complaints, I \njoin all but Part IV of the opinion and do not concur in the \ncorresponding part of the judgment. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  Between 2001 and 2011, Congress considered over two \ndozen bills that would have granted lawful status to mil-\nlions of aliens who were illegally brought to this country as \nchildren.  Each of those legislative efforts failed.  In the \nwake of this impasse, the Department of Homeland Secu-\nrity (DHS) under President Barack Obama took matters  \ninto its own hands.  Without any purported delegation of \nauthority from Congress and without undertaking a rule-\nmaking, DHS unilaterally created a program known as  \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  The three-\npage DACA memorandum made it possible for approxi-\nmately 1.7 million illegal aliens to qualify for temporary \nlawful  presence  and  certain  federal  and  state  benefits.  \nWhen President Donald Trump took office in  2017, his Act-\ning Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through yet an-\nother memorandum, rescinded the DACA memorandum.  \nTo state it plainly, the Trump administration rescinded \nDACA the same way that the Obama administration cre-\nated it: unilaterally, and through a mere memorandum. \n  Today the majority makes the mystifying determination \nthat this rescission of DACA was unlawful.  In reaching \nthat conclusion, the majority acts as though it is engaging \nin the routine application of standard principles of admin-\nistrative law. On the contrary, this is anything but a stand-\nard administrative law case. \n  DHS created DACA during the Obama administration \nwithout  any  statutory  authorization  and  without  going \nthrough the requisite rulemaking process.  As a result, the  \nprogram was unlawful from its inception.  The majority \ndoes not even attempt to explain why a court has the au-\nthority to scrutinize an agency’s policy reasons for rescind-\ning an unlawful program under the arbitrary and capri-\ncious microscope. The decision to countermand an unlawful \nagency action is clearly reasonable.  So long as the agency’s \ndetermination of illegality is sound, our review should be at \nan end. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  Today’s decision must be recognized for what it is: an ef-\nfort to avoid a politically controversial but legally correct \ndecision. The Court could have made clear that the solution  \nrespondents seek must come from the Legislative Branch.  \nInstead, the majority has decided to prolong DHS’ initial \noverreach by providing a stopgap measure of its own.  In \ndoing so, it has given the green light for future political bat-\ntles to be fought in this Court rather than where they right-\nfully belong—the political branches. Such timidity forsakes \nthe Court’s duty to apply the law according to neutral prin-\nciples, and the ripple effects of the majority’s error will be \nfelt throughout our system of self-government. \n  Perhaps even more unfortunately, the majority’s holding \ncreates perverse incentives, particularly for outgoing ad-\nministrations.  Under the auspices of today’s decision, ad-\nministrations  can  bind  their  successors  by  unlawfully \nadopting  significant  legal  changes  through  Executive \nBranch agency memoranda.  Even if the agency lacked au-\nthority to effectuate the changes, the changes cannot be un-\ndone by the same agency in a successor administration un-\nless the successor provides sufficient policy justifications to \nthe satisfaction of this Court.  In other words, the majority \nerroneously holds that the agency is not only permitted, but \nrequired,  to  continue  administering  unlawful  programs \nthat it inherited from a previous administration.

Despite  these \nchanges, the memorandum contradictorily claimed that it \n“confer[red] no substantive right [or] immigration status,” \nbecause “[o]nly the Congress, acting through its legislative \nauthority, can confer these rights.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 18–587, at 101a. \n  In 2014, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh John-\nson broadened the deferred-action program in yet another \nbrief memorandum.  This 2014 memorandum expanded\nDACA eligibility by extending the deferred-action period to \nthree years and by relaxing other criteria.  It also imple-\nmented a related program, known as Deferred Action for \nParents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \n(DAPA).  DAPA allowed unlawfully present parents to ob-\ntain deferred action derivatively through their children who \nwere either citizens or lawful permanent residents.  Ap-\nproximately 4.3 million aliens qualified for DAPA and, as \nwith DACA, these individuals would have become eligible \nfor certain federal and state benefits upon the approval of \ntheir DAPA applications.  See Texas v. United States, 809 \nF. 3d 134, 181 (CA5 2015).  Nevertheless, the 2014 memo-\nrandum repeated the incongruous assertion that these pro-\ngrams “d[id] not confer any form of legal status in this coun-\ntry” and added that deferred action “may be terminated at \nany time at the agency’s discretion.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. \nin No. 18–587, at 104a. \nB \n  Twenty-six States filed suit to enjoin the implementation \nof  these  new  programs,  DAPA  and  “expanded  DACA,” \nmaintaining that they violated the Constitution, the Ad-\nministrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Immigration \nand Naturalization Act (INA).  The States contended that, \nbecause the 2014 memorandum allowed aliens to receive \ndeferred action and other benefits, it amounted to a legisla-\ntive rule that had to comply with the APA’s notice  and \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

The States also argued that DHS’ de-\ncision to recategorize an entire class of aliens from “unlaw-\nfully present” to “lawfully present” exceeded its statutory \nauthority under the federal immigration laws.  According \nto the States, these defects rendered the 2014 memoran-\ndum arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.  \n  The District Court preliminarily enjoined DAPA and ex-\npanded DACA.  The Fifth Circuit  affirmed, rejecting DHS’ \nclaim that the programs were an exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion.  Texas, 809 F. 3d, at 167, 188.  The court con-\ncluded that the States were likely to succeed on their claim \nthat the 2014 memorandum was a legislative rule that had \nto be adopted through notice and comment rulemaking.  Id., \nat 171–178.  The court further concluded that the 2014  \nmemorandum was “substantively contrary to law” because\nthe INA did not grant DHS the statutory authority to im-\nplement either program.  Id., at 170, 178–186. \n  This Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment by an \nequally divided vote.  United States v. Texas, 579 U. S. ___ \n(2016) (per curiam).  \nC \n  The 2014 memorandum was rescinded on June 15, 2017, \nbefore taking effect.  Shortly after that rescission, several \nof the plaintiff States sent a letter to then-Attorney General \nJefferson Sessions III. They contended that the 2012 DACA \nmemorandum was also legally defective because, “just like \nDAPA, DACA unilaterally confers eligibility for . . . lawful \npresence without any statutory authorization from Con-\ngress.” App. 873.  The States wrote that they would amend \ntheir complaint to challenge DACA if the administration \ndid not rescind the 2012 memorandum creating DACA by \nSeptember 5, 2017.\n  On September 4, then-Attorney General Sessions wrote \nto  then-Acting  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  Elaine  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

Sessions stated that, \nin his legal opinion, DACA took effect “through executive \naction, without proper statutory authority and with no es-\ntablished end-date, after Congress’ repeated rejection of \nproposed legislation that would have accomplished a simi-\nlar result.  Such an open-ended circumvention of immigra-\ntion laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by \nthe Executive Branch.”  Id., at 877.  The letter also stated \nthat DACA was infected with the “same legal . . . defects  \nthat the courts recognized as to DAPA,” id., at  878, and thus \nDACA would likely be enjoined as well. \n  Then-Acting Secretary Duke  rescinded DACA the next \nday, also through a memorandum.  Her memorandum be-\ngan by noting that DACA “purported to use deferred action \n. . . to confer certain benefits to illegal aliens that Congress \nhad not otherwise acted to provide by law.” App. to Pet. for  \nCert. in No. 18–587, at 112a.  It described the history of the\nFifth Circuit litigation, noting that the court had concluded \nthat DAPA “conflicted with the discretion authorized by  \nCongress”  because  “the [INA] flatly does not permit the  \nreclassification  of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully pre-\nsent.”  Id., at 114a (internal quotation marks omitted).  Fi-\nnally, the memorandum accepted then-Attorney General \nSessions’ legal determination that DACA was unlawful for \nthe same reasons as DAPA.  See §1103(a)(1). In light of the\nlegal conclusions reached by the Fifth Circuit and the At-\ntorney General, then-Acting Secretary Duke set forth the \nprocedures for winding down DACA. \n  These three cases soon followed.  In each, respondents\nclaimed, among other things, that DACA’s rescission was \narbitrary  and  capricious  under  the  APA.    Two  District  \nCourts granted a preliminary nationwide injunction, while \nthe third vacated the rescission. \nII \n  “‘[A]n agency literally has no power to act . . . unless and  \n \n\n8  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

S. 290, 317 (2013) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (quot-\ning Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U. S. 355,  \n374 (1986)).  When an  agency exercises power beyond the\nbounds of its authority, it acts unlawfully.  See, e.g., SAS  \nInstitute Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U. S. ___, ___, n. (2018) (slip op., \nat 11, n.).  The 2012 memorandum creating DACA provides \na poignant illustration of ultra vires agency action.\n  DACA alters how the immigration laws apply to a certain \nclass of aliens.  “DACA [recipients] primarily entered the \ncountry either by overstaying a visa or by entering without \ninspection, and the INA instructs that aliens in both classes \nare removable.”  Texas v. United States, 328 F. Supp. 3d \n662, 713 (SD Tex. 2018) (footnote omitted).  But DACA \ngranted its recipients deferred action, i.e., a decision to “de-\ncline  to  institute  [removal]  proceedings,  terminate  [re-\nmoval] proceedings, or decline to institute a final order of \n[removal].”  Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination  \nComm., 525 U. S. 471, 484 (1999) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Under other regulations, recipients of deferred \naction are deemed lawfully present for purposes of certain \nfederal benefits. See supra, at 4. Thus, DACA in effect cre-\nated a new exception to the statutory provisions governing \nremovability and, in the process, conferred lawful presence \non an entire class of aliens.  \n  To  lawfully  implement  such  changes,  DHS  needed  a \ngrant of authority from Congress to either reclassify remov-\nable DACA recipients as lawfully present, or to exempt the \nentire class of aliens covered by DACA from statutory re-\nmoval procedures. No party disputes that the immigration \nstatutes lack an express delegation to accomplish either re-\nsult.  And, an examination of the highly reticulated immi-\ngration regime makes clear that DHS has no implicit dis-\ncretion to create new classes of lawful presence or to grant \nrelief from  removal out of whole cloth.  Accordingly, DACA  \nis substantively unlawful. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  9 \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  This conclusion should begin and  end our review.  The  \ndecision to rescind an unlawful agency action is per se law-\nful. No additional policy justifications or considerations are  \nnecessary.  And, the majority’s contrary holding—that an \nagency is not only permitted, but required, to continue an  \nultra vires action—has no basis in  law. \nA \n  Congress has not authorized DHS to reclassify an entire \nclass of removable aliens as lawfully present or to categori-\ncally exempt aliens from statutory removal provisions.  \n1 \n  I begin with lawful presence.  As just stated, nothing in \nthe federal immigration laws expressly delegates to DHS\nthe unfettered discretion to create new categories of law-\nfully present aliens.  And, there is no basis for concluding \nthat Congress implicitly delegated to DHS the power to re-\nclassify categories of aliens as lawfully present.  The immi-\ngration statutes provide numerous ways to obtain lawful \npresence, both temporary and permanent.  The highly de-\ntailed nature of these provisions indicates that Congress \nhas exhaustively provided for all of  the ways that it thought \nlawful presence should be obtainable, leaving no discretion \nto DHS to add new pathways. \n  For example, federal immigration laws provide over 60\ntemporary nonimmigrant visa options, including visas for \nambassadors, full-time students and their spouses and chil-\ndren, those engaged to marry a United States citizen within \n90 days of arrival, athletes and performers, and aliens with \nspecialized  knowledge  related  to  their  employers.    See  \n§§1101(a)(15)(A)–(V), 1184; 8 CFR §214.1; see also Congres-\nsional Research Service, J. Wilson, Nonimmigrant and Im-\nmigrant Visa Categories: Data Brief 1–6 (2019) (Table 1).  \nIn addition, the statutes permit the Attorney General to \ngrant temporary “parole” into the  United States “for urgent \n\n10   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nhumanitarian reasons or [a] significant public benefit,” 8 \nU. S. C.  §1182(d)(5)(A);  provide  for  temporary  protected \nstatus when the Attorney General finds that removal to a\ncountry with an ongoing armed conflict “would pose a seri-\nous threat to [an alien’s] personal safety,” §1254a(b)(1)(A); \nand allow the Secretary of Homeland Security (in consulta-\ntion with the Secretary  of State) to waive visa requirements \nfor certain aliens for up to 90 days, §§1187(a)–(d). \n  The immigration laws are equally complex and detailed \nwhen it comes to obtaining lawful permanent residence.  \nCongress  has  expressly  specified  numerous  avenues  for  \nobtaining an immigrant visa, which aliens  may then use  \nto become lawful permanent residents.  §§1201, 1255(a).   \nAmong  other  categories, immigrant visas are available to \nspecified  family-sponsored aliens, aliens with advanced de-\ngrees or exceptional abilities, certain types of skilled and \nunskilled workers, “special immigrants,” and those enter-\ning the country to “engag[e] in a new commercial enter-\nprise.”  §§1153(a)–(b),  1154;  see  also  Congressional  Re-\nsearch  Service,  Nonimmigrant  and  Immigrant  Visa \nCategories, at 6–7 (Table 2).  Refugees and asylees also may \nreceive lawful permanent residence under certain condi-\ntions, §1159; 8 CFR §§209.1, 209.2.4  As with  temporary  \nlawful presence,  each  avenue to lawful  permanent resi-\ndence status has its own set of rules and exceptions.5  \n  As the Fifth Circuit held in the DAPA litigation, a conclu-\nsion with which then-Attorney General Sessions agreed, \n“specific and detailed provisions[ of] the INA expressly and \n—————— \n4The immigration statutes also provide for conditional lawful perma-\n \nnent residence status.  See §1186a(b)(1)(A)(i) (two years for spouses to \ndemonstrate that the marriage “was [not] entered into for the purpose of \nprocuring an  alien’s admission as an immigrant”); §1186b (qualifying  \nbusiness entrepreneurs). \n5For instance, Congress has  carved out rules for aliens who served in \n \nthe Armed Forces, §§1438–1440, and alien spouses who have been sub-\nject to domestic abuse, §§1186a(c)(4)(C)–(D). \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

In light of this elaborate statutory scheme, the lack of \nany similar provision for DACA recipients convincingly es-\ntablishes that Congress left DHS with no discretion to cre-\nate an additional class of aliens eligible for lawful presence.  \nCongress knows well how to provide broad discretion, and\nit has provided open-ended delegations of authority in stat-\nutes too numerous to name.  But when it comes to lawful \npresence, Congress did something strikingly different.  In-\nstead of enacting  a statute with “broad general directives” \nand leaving it to the agency to fill in the lion’s share of the \ndetails,  Mistretta  v.  United  States,  488  U.  S.  361,  372 \n(1989), Congress put in place intricate specifications gov-\nerning eligibility for lawful presence.  This comprehensive \nscheme indicates that DHS has no discretion to supplement \nor amend the statutory provisions in any manner, least of \nall by memorandum.  See FDA v. Brown & Williamson To-\nbacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 125 (2000) (An agency “may not \nexercise its authority in a manner that is inconsistent with \nthe administrative structure that Congress enacted” (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)); see also ETSI Pipeline Pro-\nject v. Missouri, 484 U. S. 495, 509–510 (1988). \n2 \n  The relief that Congress has extended to removable al-\niens likewise confirms that DACA exceeds DHS’ delegated \nauthority.  Through deferred action, DACA grants tempo-\nrary relief to removable aliens on a programmatic scale.  \nSee Texas, 328 F. Supp. 3d, at 714.  But as with lawful pres-\nence, Congress did not expressly grant DHS the authority \nto create categorical exceptions to the statute’s removal re-\nquirements.  And again, as with lawful presence, the intri-\ncate level of detail in the federal immigration laws regard-\ning  relief  from  removal  indicates  that  DHS  has  no  \ndiscretionary authority to supplement that relief with an  \n\n12   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nentirely new programmatic exemption.\n  At the outset, Congress clearly knows how to provide for \nclasswide deferred action when it wishes to do so.  On mul-\ntiple  occasions,  Congress  has  used  express  language  to \nmake certain classes of individuals eligible for deferred ac-\ntion. See 8 U. S. C. §§1154(a)(1)(D)(i)(II), (IV) (certain indi-\nviduals covered under the Violence Against Women Act are \n“eligible for deferred action”); Victims of Trafficking and Vi-\nolence Protection Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1522 (“‘Any individ-\n \nual described in subclause (I) is  eligible for deferred ac-\ntion’”); Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \n \nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Ter-\nrorism (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001, §423(b), 115 Stat. \n361 (“Such  spouse, child, son, or daughter may be eligible \nfor deferred action”); National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2004, §§1703(c)(1)(A), (2), 117 Stat. 1694–\n1695 (“Such spouse or child shall be eligible for deferred ac-\ntion”).6  Congress has failed to provide similar explicit pro-\nvisions for DACA recipients, and the immigration laws con-\ntain no indication that DHS can, at will, create its own \ncategorical policies for deferred action. \n  Other provisions pertaining to relief from removal fur-\nther demonstrate that DHS lacked the delegated authority  \n—————— \n6In the DAPA litigation, DHS noted that some deferred-action pro-\n \ngrams have been implemented by the Executive Branch without explicit \nlegislation.  But “ ‘past practice does not, by itself, create [executive]  \n \npower.’ ” Medellín v.  Texas, 552 U. S. 491, 532 (2008) (quoting  Dames & \n \nMoore v.  Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 686 (1981)).  If any of these programs had \nbeen challenged, it would seem that they would be legally infirm for the  \nsame reasons as DACA.  Moreover, if DHS had the authority to create \nnew categories of aliens eligible for deferred action, then all of Congress’ \ndeferred-action legislation was but a superfluous exercise.   Duncan v.  \nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001).  Finally, whereas some deferred-action \nprograms were followed by legislation, DACA has existed for eight years, \nand Congress is no closer to a legislative solution than it was in 2012.   \nSee, e.g., American Dream and Promise Act of 2019, H. R. 6, 116th Cong., \n1st Sess.  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  13  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nto create DACA.  As with lawful presence, Congress has \nprovided a plethora of methods by which aliens may seek \nrelief from removal.  For instance, both permanent and \ntemporary residents can seek cancellation of removal if  \nthey meet certain residency requirements and have not \ncommitted certain crimes.  §§1229b(a)–(b).  And certain \nnonpermanent residents may have their status adjusted to \npermanent  residence  during  these  proceedings.  \n§1229b(b)(2). Aliens can apply for asylum or withholding of \nremoval during removal proceedings unless they have com-\nmitted certain crimes.  §§1158, 1231(b)(3).  Applicants for \ncertain nonimmigrant visas may be granted a stay of re-\nmoval until the visa application is adjudicated.  §1227(d).  \nAnd, aliens may voluntarily depart rather than be subject\nto an order of removal. §1229c.\n  In sum, like lawful presence, Congress has provided for \nrelief from removal in specific and complex ways.  This nu-\nanced detail indicates that Congress has provided the full \npanoply of methods it thinks should be available for an al-\nien to seek relief from removal, leaving no discretion to DHS \nto provide additional programmatic forms of relief.7  \n3 \n  Finally, DHS could not appeal to general grants of au-\nthority, such as the Secretary’s ability to “perform such\nother acts as he deems necessary for carrying out his au-\nthority under the provisions of this chapter,” §1103(a)(3), or \nto “[e]stablis[h] national immigration enforcement policies\nand  priorities,”  6  U. S. C.  §202(5).    See  also  8  U. S. C.  \n§1103(g)(2).  Because we must interpret the statutes “as a \n—————— \n7It is uncontested that deferred action frequently occurs  on a case-by-\n \ncase basis, often justified on the grounds that the agency lacks resources  \nto remove all removable aliens.  Even assuming that these ad hoc exer-\ncises of discretion are permissible, however, we  have stated that “[a]n \nagency confronting resource  constraints may change its own conduct, but \nit cannot change the law.”  Utility Air Regulatory Group v.  EPA, 573 U. S.  \n302, 327 (2014). \n\n14   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

S. 561, 569 (1995), these grants of au-\nthority must be read alongside the express limits contained \nwithin the statute.  Basing the Secretary’s ability to com-\npletely overhaul immigration law on these general grants \nof  authority  would  eviscerate  that  deliberate  statutory \nscheme by “allow[ing the Secretary of DHS] to grant lawful  \npresence  . .  .  to  any  illegal  alien  in  the  United States.”  \nTexas, 809 F. 3d, at 184.  Not only is this “an untenable po-\nsition in light of the INA’s intricate system,” ibid., but it \nwould also render many of those provisions wholly super-\nfluous due to DHS’ authority to disregard them at will, \nDuncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001).  And in addi-\ntion to these fatal problems, adopting a broad interpreta-\ntion of these general grants of authority would run afoul of \nthe presumption that “Congress . . . does not alter the fun-\ndamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or \nancillary  provisions.”  Whitman  v.  American  Trucking  \nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001).  And it would also  \nconflict with the major questions doctrine, which is based \non the expectation that  Congress speaks clearly when it del-\negates the power to make “decisions of vast economic and \npolitical significance.”  Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, \n573  U. S.  302,  324  (2014)  (UARG)  (internal  quotation \nmarks omitted); see also  Texas, 787 F. 3d, at 760–761. \n  Read together, the detailed statutory provisions govern-\ning temporary and lawful permanent resident status, relief \nfrom removal, and classwide deferred-action programs lead\nineluctably to the conclusion that DACA is “inconsisten[t] \nwith the design and structure of the statute as a whole.”  \nUniversity of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, \n570 U. S. 338, 353 (2013).  As the District Court stated in \nthe DAPA litigation and as then-Attorney General Sessions \nagreed, “[i]nstead of merely refusing to enforce the INA’s \nremoval laws against an individual, the DHS has enacted a \nwide-reaching program that awards legal presence . . . to  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d 591, 654 (SD Tex.  \n2015). The immigration statutes contain a level of granular \nspecificity that is exceedingly rare in the modern adminis-\ntrative state.  It defies all logic and common sense to con-\nclude that a statutory scheme detailed enough to provide \nconditional lawful presence to groups as narrowly defined\nas “alien entrepreneurs,” §1186b, is simultaneously capa-\ncious enough for DHS to grant lawful presence to almost \ntwo million  illegal aliens with the stroke of a Cabinet secre-\ntary’s pen. \nB \n  Then-Attorney General Sessions concluded that the ini-\ntial DACA program suffered from the “same legal . . . de-\nfects” as DAPA and expanded DACA, finding that, like \nthose programs, DACA was implemented without statutory\nauthority. App. 877–878. Not only was this determination \ncorrect, but it is also dispositive for purposes of our review.  \n“It is axiomatic that an administrative agency’s power . . .  \nis limited to the authority granted by Congress.”  Bowen v.  \nGeorgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 208 (1988).  DHS \nhad no authority here to create DACA, and the unlawful-\nness of that program is a sufficient justification for its re-\nscission.  \n  The majority opts for a different path, all but ignoring \nDACA’s substantive legal defect.  See ante, at 18–19.  On \nthe majority’s understanding of APA review, DHS was re-\nquired to provide additional policy justifications in order to \nrescind an action that it had no authority to take.  This rule \n“has no basis in our jurisprudence, and support for [it] is \nconspicuously absent from the Court’s opinion.”  Massachu-\nsetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497, 536 (2007) (ROBERTS, C.

J., dissenting), not \nto perpetuate a decision to unlawfully wield power in direct \ncontravention  of  the enabling  statute’s  clear  limits,  see \nUARG, 573 U. S., at 327–328; Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., \n534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002).\n  Under our precedents, DHS can only exercise the author-\nity that Congress has chosen to delegate to it.  See UARG, \n573 U. S., at 327.  In implementing DACA, DHS under the \nObama administration arrogated to itself power it was not \ngiven by Congress. Thus, every action taken by DHS under \nDACA is the unlawful exercise of power.  Now, under the  \nTrump administration, DHS has provided the most compel-\nling reason to rescind DACA: The program was unlawful \nand would force DHS to continue acting unlawfully if it car-\nried the program forward.  \nIII  \n  The majority’s demanding review of DHS’ decisionmak-\ning process is especially perverse given that the 2012 mem-\norandum flouted the APA’s procedural requirements—the\nvery  requirements  designed  to  prevent  arbitrary  deci-\nsionmaking. Even if DHS were authorized to create DACA,  \nit could not do so without undertaking an administrative \nrulemaking.  The fact that DHS did not engage in this pro-\ncess likely provides an independent basis for rescinding \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

But at the very least, this procedural defect com-\npounds the absurdity of the majority’s position in these \ncases. \n  As described above, DACA fundamentally altered the im-\nmigration laws. It created a new category of aliens who, as \na class, became exempt from statutory removal procedures, \nand it gave those aliens temporary lawful presence.  Both \nchanges contravened statutory limits.  DACA is thus what  \nis commonly called a substantive or legislative rule.8  As the  \nname implies, our precedents state that legislative rules \nare those that “have the force and effect of law.”  Chrysler  \nCorp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 295 (1979) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n  Our  precedents  allow  the  vast  majority  of  legislative \nrules to proceed through so-called “informal” notice and \ncomment rulemaking.  See United States v. Florida East \nCoast R. Co., 410 U. S. 224, 237–238 (1973).9 But under our \nprecedents, an agency must engage in certain procedures \nmandated by the APA before its rule carries legal force.  Ki-\nsor v. Wilkie, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (plurality opinion) \n(slip op., at 23) (“[A] legislative rule, . . . to be valid[,] must \ngo through notice and comment”); id., at ___ (GORSUCH, J.,  \nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 17) (same); Perez v. \nMortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.

These procedures specify that the \nagency “shall” publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in  \n—————— \n8The majority  tacitly acknowledges as much, as it must.  See ante, at \n \n11–12.  Otherwise, the majority would have to accept that DACA was \nnothing more than a policy of prosecutorial discretion, which would make \nits rescission  unreviewable.  See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831  \n(1985). \n9As I have previously pointed out, “the APA actually contemplated a  \n \nmuch more formal process  for most rulemaking.”   Perez v. Mortgage  \nBankers Assn., 575 U.

S. C. §§553(b)–(c); see also Kisor, 588 U. S., at ___ (opin-\nion of GORSUCH, J.) (slip op., at 17). As we have recognized\nrecently, use of the word “shall” indicates that these proce-\ndures impose mandatory obligations on the agency before it \ncan adopt a valid binding regulation.  See Maine Commu-\nnity Health Options v.  United States, 590 U. S. ___, ___  \n(2020) (slip op., at 12).  After undergoing notice and com-\nment, the agency then publishes the final rule, which must \n“articulate a satisfactory explanation for [the] action in-\ncluding a rational connection between the facts found and \nthe choice made.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United  \nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463  \nU. S.  29,  43  (1983)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  \nOnly after completing this process is the legislative rule a \nvalid law. See Kisor, 588 U. S., at ___ (opinion of GORSUCH, \nJ.) (slip op., at 17).10  \n  Because DACA has the force and effect of law, DHS was  \nrequired to observe the procedures set out in the APA if it \nwanted to promulgate a legislative rule.  It is undisputed, \nhowever, that DHS did not do so.  It provided no oppor-\ntunity for interested parties to submit comments regarding \nthe effect that the program’s dramatic and very significant \nchange in immigration law would have on various aspects \nof society.  It provided no discussion of economic considera-\ntions or national security interests.  Nor did it provide any \nsubstantial policy justifications for treating young people \n—————— \n10The APA also provides certain exceptions from notice and comment \n \nrulemaking.  For example, an agency may promulgate a legally binding \nrule without notice and comment if good cause exists to do so.  5 U.  S. C.  \n§553(b)(B).  This text would become a nullity if the agency  could achieve \nthe same effect by simply dispensing with notice and comment proce-\ndures altogether. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U.

And, it did not invoke any law authorizing  \nDHS to create such a program beyond its inexplicable as-\nsertion that DACA  was consistent with existing law.  Be-\ncause DHS failed to engage in the statutorily mandated\nprocess, DACA never gained status as a legally binding reg-\nulation that could impose duties or obligations on third par-\nties.  See id., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 23);  id., \nat ___ (opinion of GORSUCH, J.) (slip op., at 17).\n  Given this state of affairs, it is unclear to me why DHS \nneeded to provide any explanation whatsoever when it de-\ncided to rescind DACA.  Nothing in the APA suggests that \nDHS was required to spill any ink justifying the rescission\nof an invalid legislative rule, let alone that it was required \nto provide policy justifications beyond acknowledging that \nthe program was simply unlawful from the beginning.  And,  \nit is well established that we do not remand for an agency \nto correct its reasoning when it was required by law to take \nor abstain from an action.  See Morgan Stanley Capital \nGroup Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 \nU. S. 527, 544–545 (2008).  Here, remand would be futile,  \nbecause no amount of policy explanation could cure the fact \nthat DHS lacked statutory authority to enact DACA in the \nfirst place.\n  Instead of recognizing this, the majority now requires the \nrescinding Department to treat the invalid rule as though \nit were legitimate.  As just explained, such a requirement \nis not supported by the APA.11  It is also absurd, as evi-\ndenced by its application to DACA in these cases.  The ma-\njority insists that DHS was obligated to discuss its choices \nregarding benefits and forbearance in great detail, even \n—————— \n11Thus, it is not  that the APA “should  not” be construed to support the \n \nmajority’s result, ante, at 26 (emphasis added), it is that the APA does  \nnot and cannot support that result. \n\n20   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nthough no such detailed discussion accompanied DACA’s is-\nsuance. And, the majority also requires DHS to discuss re-\nliance interests at length, even though deferred action tra-\nditionally does not take reliance interests into account and \nDHS was not forced to explain its treatment of reliance in-\nterests in the first instance by going through notice and \ncomment.  See infra, at 23–24.  The majority’s demand for\nsuch an explanation here simply makes little sense. \n  At bottom, of course, none of this matters, because DHS  \ndid provide a sufficient explanation for its action.  DHS’ \nstatement that DACA was ultra vires  was more than suffi-\ncient to justify its rescission.12  By requiring more, the ma-\njority has distorted the APA review process beyond recogni-\ntion,  further  burdening  all  future  attempts  to  rescind \nunlawful programs.  Plaintiffs frequently bring successful \nchallenges to agency actions by arguing that the agency has \nimpermissibly dressed up a legislative rule as a policy state-\nment and must comply with the relevant procedures before \nfunctionally binding regulated parties.  See, e.g., Mendoza  \nv. Perez, 754 F. 3d 1002 (CADC 2014); Natural Resources \nDefense Council v. EPA, 643 F. 3d 311 (CADC 2011); Na-\ntional Family Planning & Reproductive Health Assn., Inc.  \nv. Sullivan, 979 F. 2d 227 (CADC 1992).  But going forward, \nwhen a rescinding agency inherits an invalid legislative\nrule that ignored virtually every rulemaking requirement \nof the APA, it will be obliged to overlook that reality.  In-\nstead of simply terminating the program because it did not \ngo through the requisite process, the agency will be com-\npelled to treat an invalid legislative rule as though it were \nlegitimate.13  \n—————— \n12I express no view on what other reasons would justify  an agency’s  \n \ndecision to rescind a procedurally unlawful action.  I merely point out \nthat correctly concluding that the program was illegal is sufficient. \n13In my view, even if DACA were permitted under the federal immi-\n \ngration laws and had complied with the APA, it would still violate the \nConstitution as an impermissible delegation of legislative power.  See  \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  21  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nIV \n  Even  if  I  were  to  accept  the  majority’s  premise  that \nDACA’s rescission required additional policy justifications, \nthe majority’s reasons for setting aside the agency’s deci-\nsion still fail. \nA \n  First, the majority claims that the Fifth Circuit discussed \nonly the legality of the 2014 memorandum’s conferral of \nbenefits, not its “forbearance component”—i.e., the decision \nnot to place DACA recipients into removal proceedings.  \nAnte, at 20.  The majority, therefore, claims that, notwith-\nstanding  the  then-Attorney  General’s  legal  conclusion, \nthen-Acting Secretary Duke was required to consider re-\nvoking  DACA  recipients’  lawful  presence  and  other  at-\ntendant benefits while continuing to defer their removal.  \nAnte, at 22–23. Even assuming the majority correctly char-\nacterizes the Fifth Circuit’s opinion, it cites no authority for \nthe proposition that arbitrary and capricious review re-\nquires an agency to dissect an unlawful program piece by \npiece,  scrutinizing  each  separate  element  to  determine \nwhether it would independently violate the law, rather \nthan just to rescind the entire program.14  \n—————— \nDepartment of Transportation v.  Association of American Railroads, 575  \nU. S. 43, 77 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).  Putting aside \nthis constitutional concern, however, the notice and comment process at \nleast attempts to provide a “surrogate political process” that takes some \nof the sting out of the inherently undemocratic and unaccountable rule-\nmaking process.  Asimow, Interim-Final Rules: Making Haste Slowly, 51  \nAdmin. L. Rev. 703, 708 (1999). \n14The majority’s interpretation of the Fifth Circuit’s opinion is highly \n \nquestionable.  Because a grant of deferred action renders DACA recipi-\nents eligible for certain benefits and work authorization, it is far from \nclear that the Department could separate  DACA’s “forbearance compo-\nnent” from the major benefits it conferred without running into yet an-\nother APA problem.  The majority points to the fact that, under the Pa-\ntient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, relevant regulations \nexclude those receiving deferred action through DACA from coverage.  \n\n22   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojund ogfm TeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \n  The then-Attorney General reviewed the thorough deci-\nsions of the District Court and the Fifth Circuit.  Those \ncourts exhaustively examined the INA’s text and structure, \nthe relevant provisions of other federal immigration stat-\nutes, the historical practice of deferred action, and the gen-\neral grants of statutory authority to set immigration policy.  \nBoth decisions concluded that  DAPA and expanded DACA \nviolated the carefully crafted federal immigration scheme, \nthat such violations could not be justified through reference \nto past exercises of deferred action, and that the general \ngrants of statutory authority did not give DHS the power to \nenact such a sweeping nonenforcement program. Based on  \nthe reasoning of those decisions, then-Attorney General \nSessions concluded that DACA was likewise implemented \nwithout statutory authority.  He directed DHS to restore \nthe rule of law.  DHS followed the then-Attorney General’s \nlegal analysis and rescinded the program.  This legal con-\nclusion more than suffices to supply the “reasoned analysis” \nnecessary to rescind an unlawful program. State Farm, 463  \nU. S., at 42.  \n  The majority has no answer except to suggest that this \napproach is inconsistent with  State Farm.  See ante, at 21– \n22.  But in doing so, the majority ignores the fact that, un-\nlike the typical “prior policy” contemplated by the Court in  \n—————— \nAnte, at 19, n. 5.  But that misses the point.  Those regulations were \npromulgated before “anyone with deferred action under the DACA pro-\ncess applie[d]” for those benefits.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 52616 (2012).  By \ncontrast, DACA recipients have been eligible for and have received Med-\nicare, Social Security, and work authorization for  years.  DHS therefore \nis not writing on a blank slate.  Under the majority’s rule, DHS would  \nneed to amend all relevant regulations and explain why all recipients of\ndeferred action who have previously received such benefits may no longer \nreceive them.  Alternatively and perhaps  more problematically, it would \nneed to provide a reason why other recipients of deferred action should  \ncontinue to qualify, while DACA recipients should not.  It thus seems  \nhighly likely that the majority’s proposed course of action would be sub-\nject to serious arbitrary and capricious challenges. \n\n  Cite as:  591 U. S. ____ (2020)  23  \n \nTHOMAS, J., concurring iOn ptihnei ojnu dogf mTeHnOtM iAnS p,  aJr. t and dissenting in part \nState Farm, DACA is unlawful.  Neither State Farm nor \nany other decision cited by the majority addresses what an \nagency must do when it has inherited an unlawful program.  \nIt is perhaps for this reason that, rather than responding \nwith authority of its own, the majority simply opts to excise \nthe “unlawful policy” aspect from its discussion. \nB \n  Second, the majority claims that DHS erred by failing to \ntake into account the reliance interests of DACA recipients.   \nAnte, at 23–26.  But reliance interests are irrelevant when  \nassessing whether to rescind an action that the agency \nlacked statutory authority to take.  No amount of reliance \ncould ever justify continuing a program that allows DHS to \nwield power that neither Congress nor the Constitution \ngave it. Any such decision would be “not in accordance with \nlaw” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority.”  5 U. S. C. \n§§706(2)(A), (C). Accordingly, DHS would simply be engag-\ning in yet another exercise of unlawful power if it used reli-\nance interests to justify continuing the initially unlawful \nprogram, and a court would be obligated to set aside that \naction.15  \n  Even if reliance interests were sometimes relevant when \nrescinding an ultra vires action, the rescission still would \nnot be arbitrary and capricious here.  Rather, as the major-\nity does not dispute, the rescission is consistent with how\ndeferred action has always worked.  As a general matter, \ndeferred action creates no rights—it exists at the Govern-\nment’s discretion and can be revoked at any time.  See App.  \n—————— \n15The majority contends that this argument does not carry force be-\n \ncause the rescission implemented a winddown period during which re-\ncipients would continue to receive benefits.  But whether DHS’ decision \nto wind down DACA was lawful is a separate question from whether \nDHS was required to consider reliance interests before discontinuing an \nunlawful program. \n\n24   DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v.  \n  REGENTS OF UNIV.

The Government has made clear time \nand again that, because “deferred action is not an immigra-\ntion status, no alien has the right to deferred action.  It is  \nused solely in the discretion of the [Government] and con-\nfers no protection or benefit upon an alien.” DHS Immigra-\ntion and Customs Enforcement Office of Detention and Re-\nmoval, Detention and Deportation Officers’ Field Manual \n§20.8 (Mar. 27, 2006); see also Memorandum from D.

Thus, con-\ntrary to the majority’s unsupported assertion,  ante, at 23,  \nthis longstanding administrative treatment of deferred ac-\ntion provides strong evidence and authority for the proposi-\ntion that an agency need not consider reliance interests in\nthis context.16  \n  Finally, it is inconceivable to require DHS to study reli-\nance interests before rescinding DACA considering how the \nprogram was previously defended.  DHS has made clear \nsince DACA’s inception that it would not consider such re-\nliance interests.  Contemporaneous with the DACA memo, \nDHS stated that “DHS can terminate or renew deferred ac-\ntion at any time at the agency’s discretion.”  Consideration  \n—————— \n16The majority’s  approach will make it far  more difficult to change \n \ndeferred-action programs going forward, which is hardly in keeping with \nthis Court’s own understanding that deferred action is an “exercise in  \nadministrative discretion” used for administrative “convenience.”  Reno  \nv.

In fact,  \nDHS repeatedly argued in court that the 2014 memoran-\ndum was a valid exercise of prosecutorial discretion in part \nbecause deferred action created no rights on which recipi-\nents could rely.  Before the Fifth Circuit, DHS stated that  \n“DHS may revoke or terminate deferred action and begin \nremoval proceedings at any time at its discretion.”  Brief for  \nAppellants in Texas v.

T. 2015, No. 15–674, p. 5; see also id., at 37.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of ALITO,  J. \nnow  plays  in  our  constitutional system  should  consider\nwhat has happened in these cases.  Early in the term of the\ncurrent President, his administration took the controver-\nsial step of attempting to rescind the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Shortly thereafter, \none of the nearly 700 federal district court judges blocked \nthis rescission, and since then, this issue has been mired in \nlitigation.  In November 2018, the Solicitor General filed \npetitions for certiorari, and today, the Court still does not \nresolve the question of DACA’s rescission.  Instead, it tells \nthe Department of Homeland Security to go back and try \nagain. What this means is that the Federal Judiciary, with-\nout holding that DACA cannot be rescinded, has prevented \nthat from occurring during an entire Presidential term.  \nOur constitutional system is not supposed to work that way. \n  I join JUSTICE THOMAS’s opinion.   DACA presents a deli-\ncate political issue, but that is not our business. As JUSTICE \nTHOMAS explains, DACA was unlawful from the start, and \nthat alone is sufficient to justify its termination.  But even  \nif DACA were lawful, we would still have no basis for over-\nturning its rescission.  First, to the extent DACA repre-\nsented a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion, its re-\nscission represented an exercise of that same discretion, \nand it would therefore be unreviewable under the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act.  5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2); see Heckler v. \nChaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831–832 (1985).  Second, to the ex-\ntent we could review the rescission, it was not arbitrary and \ncapricious for essentially the reasons explained by JUSTICE \nKAVANAUGH.

OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \n  For the last 20 years, the country has engaged in conse-\nquential policy, religious, and moral debates about the legal \nstatus of millions of young immigrants who, as children, \nwere brought to the United States and have lived here ever \nsince.  Those young immigrants do not have legal status in \nthe United States under current statutory law.  They live, \ngo to school, and work here with uncertainty about their \nfutures.  Despite many attempts over the last two decades, \nCongress has not yet enacted legislation to afford legal sta-\ntus to those immigrants. \n  In 2012, exercising its view of the Executive’s prosecuto-\nrial discretion under Article II and the immigration laws, \nPresident Obama’s administration unilaterally instituted a \nprogram known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, \nor DACA.  Under DACA, eligible young immigrants may \napply for and receive deferred action.  They must renew \ntheir DACA status every two years.  Under the program, \nthe Executive Branch broadly forbears from enforcing cer-\ntain immigration removal laws against DACA recipients.  \nAnd by virtue of the forbearance, DACA recipients also be-\ncome eligible for work authorization and other benefits. \n  Since  2017,  President  Trump’s  administration  has \nsought to rescind DACA based on its different and narrower \nunderstanding of the Executive’s prosecutorial discretion \nunder Article II and the immigration laws.  In its view, the \nExecutive Branch legally may not, and as a policy matter \nshould not, unilaterally forbear from enforcing the immi-\ngration laws against such a large class of individuals.  The \ncurrent administration has stated that it instead wants to \nwork with Congress to enact comprehensive legislation that \nwould address the legal status of those immigrants together \nwith other significant immigration issues. \n  The question before the Court is whether the Executive \nBranch acted lawfully in ordering rescission of the ongoing \nDACA program.  To begin with, all nine Members of the \nCourt accept, as do the DACA plaintiffs themselves, that \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nthe Executive Branch possesses the legal authority to re-\nscind DACA and to resume pre-DACA enforcement of the \nimmigration laws enacted by Congress.  Having previously \nadopted a policy of prosecutorial discretion and nonenforce-\nment with respect to a particular class of offenses or indi-\nviduals, the Executive Branch has the legal authority to re-\nscind such a policy and resume enforcing the law enacted \nby Congress.  The Executive Branch’s exercise of that re-\nscission authority is subject to constitutional constraints \nand may also be subject to statutory constraints.  The nar-\nrow legal dispute here concerns a statutory constraint—\nnamely, whether the Executive Branch’s action to rescind \nDACA satisfied the general arbitrary-and-capricious stand-\nard of the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA. \n  The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard  requires \nthat agency action be reasonable and reasonably explained.  \nAs the Court has long stated, judicial review under that \nstandard is deferential to the agency.  The Court may not \nsubstitute its policy judgment for that of the agency.  The \nCourt simply ensures that the agency has acted within a \nbroad zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has reason-\nably  considered  the  relevant  issues  and  reasonably  ex-\nplained the decision.  See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 556 U. S. 502 (2009); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of \nUnited States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., \n463 U. S. 29 (1983). \n  The Executive Branch explained its decision to rescind \nDACA in two sequential memorandums by successive Sec-\nretaries of Homeland Security: the 2017 Duke Memoran-\ndum and the 2018 Nielsen Memorandum.  The Duke Mem-\norandum focused on DACA’s perceived legal flaws.  The \nCourt today finds the Duke Memorandum insufficient un-\nder the APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard. \n  But regardless of whether the Court is correct about the \nDuke Memorandum, the Nielsen Memorandum more fully \nexplained the Department’s legal reasons for rescinding \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nDACA, and clarified that even if DACA were lawful, the De-\npartment would still rescind DACA for a variety of policy \nreasons.    The  Nielsen  Memorandum  also  expressly  ad-\ndressed the reliance interests of DACA recipients.  The \nquestion under the APA’s deferential arbitrary-and-capri-\ncious standard is not whether we agree with the Depart-\nment’s decision to rescind DACA.  The question is whether \nthe Nielsen Memorandum reasonably explained the deci-\nsion to rescind DACA.  Under ordinary application of the \narbitrary-and-capricious standard, the Nielsen Memoran-\ndum—with its alternative and independent rationales and \nits discussion of reliance—would pass muster as an expla-\nnation for the Executive Branch’s action. \n  The Nielsen Memorandum was issued nine months after \nthe Duke Memorandum.  Under the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act, the Nielsen Memorandum is itself a “rule” setting \nforth “an agency statement of general . . . applicability and \nfuture effect designed to implement . . . policy.”  5 U. S. C. \n§551(4).  Because it is a rule, the Nielsen Memorandum con-\nstitutes “agency action.”  §551(13).  As the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, Secretary Nielsen had the authority to \ndecide whether to stick with Secretary Duke’s decision to \nrescind DACA, or to make a different decision.  Like Secre-\ntary Duke, Secretary Nielsen chose to rescind DACA, and \nshe provided additional explanation.  Her memorandum \nwas akin to common forms of agency action that follow ear-\nlier agency action on the same subject—for example, a sup-\nplemental or new agency statement of policy, or an agency \norder with respect to a motion for rehearing or reconsider-\nation.  Courts often consider an agency’s additional expla-\nnations of policy or additional explanations made, for exam-\nple, on agency rehearing or reconsideration, or on remand \nfrom a court, even if the agency’s bottom-line decision itself \ndoes not change. \n  Yet the Court today jettisons the Nielsen Memorandum \nby classifying it as a post hoc justification for rescinding \n\n  Cite as: 591 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nDACA.  Ante, at 14–16.  Under our precedents, however, the \npost hoc justification doctrine merely requires that courts \nassess agency action based on the official explanations of \nthe agency decisionmakers, and not based on after-the-fact \nexplanations advanced by agency lawyers during litigation \n(or  by  judges).   See,  e.g.,  State  Farm, 463 U. S., at  50 \n(“courts may not accept appellate counsel’s post hoc ration-\nalizations for agency action”); FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. \n380, 397 (1974) (same); NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., \n380 U. S. 438, 443–444 (1965) (same); Burlington Truck \nLines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U. S. 156, 168–169 (1962) \n(same).  As the D. C. Circuit has explained, the post hoc jus-\ntification doctrine “is not a time barrier which freezes an \nagency’s exercise of its judgment after an initial decision \nhas been made and bars it from further articulation of its \nreasoning.  It is a rule directed at reviewing courts which \nforbids judges to uphold agency action on the basis of ra-\ntionales  offered  by  anyone  other  than  the  proper  deci-\nsionmakers.”  Alpharma, Inc. v. Leavitt, 460 F. 3d 1, 6 \n(2006) (Garland, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  Indeed, the ordinary judicial remedy for an agency’s in-\nsufficient explanation is to remand for further explanation \nby the relevant agency personnel.  It would make little \nsense for a court to exclude official explanations by agency \npersonnel such as a Cabinet Secretary simply because the \nexplanations are purportedly post hoc, and then to turn \naround and remand for further explanation by those same \nagency personnel.  Yet that is the upshot of the Court’s ap-\nplication of the post hoc justification doctrine today.  The \nCourt’s refusal to look at the Nielsen Memorandum seems \nparticularly  mistaken,  moreover,  because  the  Nielsen \nMemorandum shows that the Department, back in 2018, \nconsidered the policy issues that the Court today says the \nDepartment did not consider.  Ante, at 20–26. \n  To be sure, cases such as Overton Park and Camp v. Pitts \nsuggest that courts reviewing certain agency adjudications \n\n6  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. \n  REGENTS OF UNIV. OF CAL. \nOpinion of KAVANAUGH, J. \nmay in some circumstances decline to examine an after-the-\nfact agency explanation.  See Camp v. Pitts, 411 U. S. 138, \n142–143 (1973) (per curiam); Citizens to Preserve Overton \nPark, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402, 419–421 (1971).  But \nagency adjudications are “concerned with the determina-\ntion of past and present rights and liabilities,” Attorney \nGeneral’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 14 \n(1947), and implicate the due process interests of the indi-\nvidual parties to the adjudication.  Judicial review of an ad-\njudication therefore ordinarily focuses on what happened \nduring the agency’s adjudication process of deciding that in-\ndividual case. \n  Even if certain agency adjudications have a slightly more \nstringent restriction on post hoc explanations, the APA is \n“based upon a dichotomy between rule making and adjudi-\ncation,” ibid., and this case involves an ongoing agency rule \nthat has future effect—the rescission of DACA.  The Nielsen \nMemorandum implements and explains the rescission of \nDACA.  I am aware of no case from this Court, and the \nCourt today cites none, that has employed the post hoc jus-\ntification doctrine to exclude an agency’s official explana-\ntion of an agency rule.  For purposes of arbitrary-and-capri-\ncious review, it does not matter whether the latest official \nexplanation was two years ago or three years ago.  What \nmatters is whether the explanation was reasonable and fol-\nlowed the requisite procedures.  In my view, the Court \nshould  consider  the  Nielsen  Memorandum  in  deciding \nwhether the Department’s rescission of DACA satisfies the \nAPA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard. \n  Because the Court excludes the Nielsen Memorandum, \nthe Court sends the case back to the Department of Home-\nland Security for further explanation.  Although I disagree \nwith the Court’s decision to remand, the only practical con-\nsequence of the Court’s decision to remand appears to be \nsome delay.  The Court’s decision seems to allow the De-\npartment on remand to relabel and reiterate the substance \n\n  Cite as: 591 U.

Ante, at 23–26.*\n*    *    * \n  The Court’s resolution of this narrow APA issue of course \ncannot eliminate the broader uncertainty over the status of \nthe DACA recipients.  That uncertainty is a result of Con-\ngress’s inability thus far to agree on legislation, which in \nturn has forced successive administrations to improvise, \nthereby triggering many rounds of relentless litigation with \nthe prospect of more litigation to come.  In contrast to those \nnecessarily  short-lived  and  stopgap  administrative \nmeasures, the Article I legislative process could produce a \nsturdy and enduring solution to this issue, one way or the \nother, and thereby remove the uncertainty that has per-\nsisted for years for these young immigrants and the Na-\n—————— \n*Because I conclude that the Executive Branch satisfied the APA’s ar-\n \nbitrary-and-capricious standard, I need not consider whether its prose-\ncutorial enforcement policy was “committed to agency discretion by law” \nand therefore not subject to APA arbitrary-and-capricious review in the \nfirst place.  5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2).  Several judges have advanced argu-\nments suggesting that DACA—at least to the extent it was simply an \nexercise of forbearance authority—and the repeal of DACA are decisions \nabout whether and to what extent to exercise prosecutorial discretion \nagainst a class of offenses or individuals, and are therefore unreviewable \nunder the APA as “committed to agency discretion by law.”  Ibid.; see \nCasa De Maryland v.

In the meantime, as to the nar-\nrow APA question presented here, I appreciate the Court’s \ncareful analysis, but I ultimately disagree with its treat-\nment of the Nielsen Memorandum.
