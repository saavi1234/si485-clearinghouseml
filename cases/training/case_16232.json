    "summary": "<p><p><strong>Background and Complaint</strong> In 1988, the Connecticut Education Commissioner published a report showing that school segregation by race was worsening in his state; 80 percent of the state&rsquo;s minority students were concentrated within 14 of its 165 school districts. The problem was even more pronounced in Hartford where minority students made up 92 percent of the public school population there, as compared to the suburban districts outside of Hartford, where only seven out of 21 had minority populations exceeding 10 percent. Desegregated Differently, The American Prospect. Rachel M. Cohen, Desegregated, Differently. American Prospect (Oct. 18, 2017). It was within this context that Elizabeth Sheff, mother of ten-year-old black Hartford student, brought this action on behalf of her son. She was joined not only by several other Hartford parents, but also white parents and students from the districts outside of Hartford. In suing the Governor of Connecticut, state Board of Education members, the Education Commissioner, and other state officials, these parents sought declaratory and injunctive relief, specifically for the plaintiff children to have an integrated education, equal educational opportunities, and a minimally adequate education. The plaintiffs also sought for the court to maintain jurisdiction over the case until full relief was granted. They claimed the inherent inequality across school districts, including depriving white children the opportunity to learn from students of other backgrounds, violated various Connecticut statutes and the Due Process Clause of the Connecticut Constitution. The plaintiffs filed this complaint on April 26, 1989 in Connecticut Superior Court and were represented by the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, Hispanic Advocacy Project, and private counsel. <strong>Procedural History and Sheff Holding</strong> The defendants raised the seven following defenses to the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims: (1) sovereign immunity; (2) stare decisis; (3) separation of powers; (4) the lack of a justiciable controversy; (5) the plaintiffs' failure to join necessary parties, including the city of Hartford; (6) the absence of state action; and (7) the unavailability of court-ordered remedies. The trial court initially denied the defendants&rsquo; motions to strike and motions for summary judgment based on these defenses. The court did, however, find that the plaintiffs lacked a state cause of action and ruled in favor of the defendants, as there was no evidence supporting the claim that actions of the state had in fact caused the conditions discussed in their complaint. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Connecticut. A coalition of civil rights organizations soon joined efforts to represent the plaintiffs, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the ACLU. In July 1996, the Connecticut Supreme Court, fully adopting the trial court&rsquo;s findings of fact, voted in a 5-4 decision to reverse the trial court&rsquo;s judgment and issue declaratory judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. Sheff v. O&rsquo;Neill, 238 Conn. 1(1996). In reaching its judgment, the Court applied the test from another Connecticut Supreme Court case, Horton v. Meskill, 195 Conn. 24, 486 A.2d. 1099 (1985), which established that after the plaintiffs demonstrate that educational disparities are more than de minimis, the state must show both that the disparities are incidental to a legitimate state policy and they are constitutional. The Court agreed with the defendants that their districting policies were not intended to cause the significant disparities, but found the disparities still infringed on the plaintiffs&rsquo; state constitutional right to equal educational opportunity. <strong>Legislative Response and Stipulation Agreements</strong> The Court noted that it opted for declaratory judgment and stayed further judicial proceedings in order to give the Connecticut General Assembly an opportunity to provide a legislative remedy to the state&rsquo;s educational disparities. By 1997, the legislature responded with new funding for early childhood education, a state takeover of Hartford&rsquo;s schools, and an expanded interdistrict school choice program featuring integrated magnets. This effort was later seen as severely weakened by limited funding and the voluntary nature of integration efforts. In 2003, the parties reached a settlement agreement that included a state commitment to having 30 percent of Hartford students enrolled in integrated schools by 2007. The agreement also included a formula for monitoring progress, and provided that interdistrict magnet schools, the Open Choice program, and interdistrict cooperative programs would be the three key instruments in meeting this goal. But with slow progress towards this goal and limited political commitment to providing more funds, the plaintiffs went back to court in 2008 and reached a new, more robust stipulation agreement. The parties agreed to set a goal of either meeting 80 percent of Hartford minority student demand for schooling in integrated settings or 41 percent of Hartford minority students actually in reduced-isolation school settings by the 2012-2013 year. This agreement included specific benchmarks and mandated the creation of state offices and a Comprehensive Management Plan. According to the American Prospect, the percentage of Hartford students in integrated schools increased from 19 percent in 2008 to 41 percent in 2013. <strong>Extensions and New Litigation</strong> Beginning in 2013, the parties periodically extended the stipulation agreement and increased its target percentage of minority students in integrated schools, culminating in a goal of 47.5 percent for the 2016-2017 year. Sheff v. O'Neill, 2017 WL 4812624. The parties were unable to extend the stipulation beyond June 30, 2017. On May 30, 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion for order seeking further implementation of the 1996 decision. They also filed a motion for temporary injunction, seeking to extend the terms of the last stipulation agreement pending a hearing on the motion for order. The court granted the temporary injunction on June 16, 2017. The state then moved to unilaterally change the agreed-upon definition of an integrated setting from 75 percent minority students to 80 percent. The Superior Court denied this motion, opting to maintain the 75 percent standard for that school year&rsquo;s magnet lottery. This case is ongoing.</p>\r</p><p><p>On January 27, 2022, the parties reached a final settlement agreement, waiting approval by a judge and the Connecticut State Legislature. If approved, it would result in a permanent injunction enforcing the terms of a plan that would significantly expand the number of available seats for students from Black, Latinx, and/or low-income families who experienced systemic discrimination and would require Connecticut&rsquo;s Department of Education to publicly report data on educational equity and to commit to greater diversity in its hiring practices. The case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p></p>",

    "summary_short": "In 1989, a group of Hartford, Connecticut parents sued state education officials alleging violations of their children's state constitutional right to an adequate education through discriminatory districting policies. The Connecticut Supreme Court granted declaratory relief in July 1996, finding the state's districting policies, while not intended to cause segregation, did constitute a violation of students' constitutional rights. The parties have periodically reached stipulation agreements since then, ultimately resulting in expanded school choice, interdistrict magnet programs, and the creation of various state offices. Based on various metrics, school segregation has significantly decreased in Hartford since these changes were put into effect. The parties failed to extend their stipulation agreement beyond June 30, 2017, and thus this case is ongoing.",

FEBRUARY 22,2010 \nMEMORANDUM OF DECISION \nI \nOn July 9, 1996, our Supreme Court declared: \"The uncontested evidence of the severe \nracial and ethnic isolation of Hartford's schoolchildren demonstrates that the state has failed to \nfulfill its affirmative constitutional obligation to provide all of the state's schoolchildren with a \nsubstantially equal educational opportunity.  Much like the substantially unequal access to fiscal \nresources that we found constitutionally unacceptable in Horton I [Horton v. Meskill, 172 Conn. \n615,376 A.2d 359 (1977)], the disparity in access to an unsegregated educational environment \nin this case arises out of state action and inaction that, prima facie, violates the plaintiffs' \nconstitutional rights, although that segregation has occurred de facto rather than de jure.\"  Sheff \nv. O'Neill, 238 Conn. I, 39-40,678 A.2d 1267 (1996). \nAcknowledging the separation of powers doctrine, the court rejected the idea of an \n.IJT O:~CJ.:!J d\\1H \nevidentiary hearing on potential remedies before the trial coun.ot(fl}ft~efarr~~fe.~rgument. \n\"'··-' IJ Jd.L -''j jJ,J.:.tJ \nbE  :n  d  ?.Z 03J  0102 \n\nId., 45.  \"In light of the complexities of developing a legislative program that would respond to \nthe constitutional deprivation that the plaintiffs had established, we concluded, in Horton I, that \nfurther judicial intervention should be stayed to afford the General Assembly an opportunity to \ntake appropriate legislative action .... Prudence and sensitivity to the constitutional authority of \ncoordinate branches of government counsel the same caution in this case .... We direct the \nlegislature and the executive branch to put the search for appropriate remedial measures at the \ntop of their respective agendas.  We are confident that with energy and good will, appropriate \nremedies can be found and implemented in time to make a difference before another generation \nof children suffers the consequences of a segregated public school education.\"  (Citation omitted; \ninternal quotation marks omitted.)  Id., 45-46.  In reversing the judgment of the trial court and \nremanding the case, the court directed the Superior Court \"to retain jurisdiction in accordance \nwith this opinion.\"  Id., 47. \n-2-\n\nThis case returns to court yet again.1  On December 9, 2009, as amended on December \n11, 2009, the plaintiffs moved this court to find a material breach2 of the most recent stipulation \n1  On March 6, 1998, the plaintiffs first returned to court seeking further judicial involvement, \nbut, the court, Aurigemma, J., found that the plaintiffs had returned to court too soon.  See Sheff \nv. 0 'Neill, 45 Conn. Sup. 630, 667, 733 A.2d 925 ( 1999) (\"[t]he legislative and executive \nbranches should have a realistic opportunity to implement their remedial programs before further \ncourt intervention\").  Then, after a three week hearing before Judge Aurigemma in December of \n2000, the parties entered into an agreement (the 2003 stipulation) covering the 2003-2004 \nthrough 2006-2007 school years.  The 2003 stipulation was approved by Judge Aurigemma as an \norder in this case on March 12, 2003.  The plaintiffs sought judicial intervention in August, 2004 \nand, on June 15, 2005, the parties filed a stipulation concerning magnet school enrollments for \nthe 2003-2006 school years together with projected enrollments for certain schools under \nconstruction.  On August 31, 2006, the city of Hartford sought to intervene in this matter and, \nafter argument, this court granted the motion on January 4, 2007. \nPrior to the expiration of the 2003 stipulation on June 30, 2007, the plaintiffs, the city and \nthe state defendants entered into negotiations for a second phase stipulation.  The discussions \nresulted in a new stipulation and order, dated May 29, 2007, covering the period through June \n30, 2012.  The agreement was signed by the plaintiffs, but not by the state defendants. With the \nexpiration of the 2003 stipulation on June 30, 2007 and the lack of approval of a new agreement, \nthe plaintiffs once again sought judicial involvement by filing a motion for order to enforce \njudgment on July 5, 2007.  A hearing commenced on November 6, 2007, but the parties entered \ninto a new agreement dated April4, 2008 (the April stipulation).  On June 11, 2008, this court \napproved the April stipulation concerning the second phase of a \"timetable for reasonable \nprogress in reducing racial, ethnic, and economic isolation in the Hartford Public Schools until \nJune 30, 2013.\"  Paragraph II.B.1 ofthe April stipulation stated the goals ofthe parties: \"to \nincrease the number of Hartford-resident minority students in a reduced-isolation educational \nsetting, and to move toward meeting demand of Hartford-resident minority students seeking \nplacement in such settings\" noting that the goal would be attained if by the 2012-2013 school \nyear (year 5), \"at least 80% of the demand for a reduced-isolation setting is met.\" Paragraph \nII.C.5 set forth the interim performance benchmark for the 2009-2010 school year (year 2) that \nprovided \"27% of Hartford-resident minority students shall be in a reduced-isolation educational \nsetting.\" \n2  Section IV.C, \"Material Breach and Enforcement,\" in relevant part, states: \"1.  The following \nfailures shall be considered matters of material breach by the State .... b. Significant failure to \nmeet each interim performance benchmark identified in Part II.C.5 of this Stipulation. A \n-3-\n\n(the April stipulation) arguing that the defendant, the state of Connecticut (state), failed to attain \nthe 2009-20 I 0 school year goal of 27 percent of Hartford-resident minority students enrolled in a \nreduced-isolation setting.  Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the 521 Hartford-resident \nminority students attending Naylor School in Hartford are not in a reduced-isolation setting \nmeeting the desegregation standard of75 percent3 and the state should not have included them in \ntheir calculations to determine if the interim benchmark had been met.  Hence, the plaintiffs \nargue that the actual percentage of Hartford-resident minority students deemed to be in a \nreduced-isolation setting for the current school year is 24.9 percent rather than 27.3 percent as \nclaimed by the state.  The parties filed a stipulation of facts, dated January 4, 2010 (January \nstipulation of facts), and this court heard argument on the plaintiffs' corrected motion on January \n7,2010. \n'significant failure' shall be deemed to have occurred for a given year ifperfom1ance for that \nyear, as calculated pursuant to Part II.C.5 of this Stipulation, falls short by more than one \npercentage point of the annual benchmark for that year, as identified in Part II.C.5 ofthis \nStipulation.\" \n3  Paragraph I.J. states: \"The Desegregation Standard shall be the lesser of the Sheff Region's \naggregate minority percentage enrollment plus thirty percentage points or seventy-five percent \n(75%).  The Desegregation Standard shall be calculated for each year of the Stipulation based on \nthat year's aggregate minority percentage enrollment figures but in no event shall it exceed \nseventy-five percent (75%).\" \n-4-\n\nII \nA. \nAdditional facts, set forth in the January stipulation of facts, are important to resolve this \ndispute and some are reproduced herein: \n\"1.  The October 2009 Sheff region aggregate minority enrollment percentage is \n45.7%.  This percentage calculation is based on a total Hartford-resident minority student \nenrollment of approximately 21,713. \n\"2.  Under the [April] Stipulation and Order, the desegregation standard for school \nyear 2009-2010 is 75%. \n\"3.  Open Choice is among those programs that the State has employed to reduce \nracial, ethnic and economic isolation. \n\"4.  Until the 2009-2010 application year, Open Choice has been directed at \npermitting Hartford-resident students to attend public schools in nearby towns. \n\"5.  Hartford-resident minority students enrolled in Hartford-area suburban schools \nthrough Open Choice are automatically deemed to be in a reduced isolation setting by operation \nof the April 4, 2008, Stipulation and Order.  More than 60% of the Hartford-area suburban \nschools participating in Open Choice have non-minority student populations in excess of 80%. \n\"6.  In May 2008, the State created the Regional School Choice Office to support the \ncollaborative effort between the State and various stakeholders to support Sheff initiatives and \nprogramming to reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation. \n-5-\n\n\"7.  The State Board of Education contracted with the Capitol Regional Education \nCouncil (CREC), by agreement dated May 29, 2008, to collaborate with the Regional School \nChoice Office and implement some of the responsibilities of the April 4, 2008 Stipulation and \nOrder. \n\"8.  The 2009-2010 Common Application and Schools of Choice Catalog were \nproduced by CREC, in consultation with representatives from the State Department of \nEducation, Hartford Public Schools, and the plaintiffs, pursuant to the May 2008 contract \nagreement between CREC and the State Board of Education. \n\"9.  The 2009-2010 Common Application and Schools of Choice Catalog describe \nOpen Choice as a program that allows Hartford students to attend public schools in nearby \nsuburban towns and suburban students to attend public schools in Hartford, at no cost to the \nstudent.  The Open Choice program that allows a suburban student to attend a Hartford public \nschool is commonly referred to as Reverse Choice.  New Haven Public Schools have operated \nOpen Choice in this manner for several years. \n\"I 0.  For the 2009-2010 school year, 1,065 suburban students timely applied to attend a \nHartford public school through the Open Choice program. \n\"15.  The State authorized the allocation of a maximum of 75 seats in Hartford Public \nSchools for purposes of Reverse Choice for the 2009-2010 school year, the funding ofwhich \nwas based on unexpended Choice money that could not be allocated given that the number of \n-6-\n\nfunded suburban seats statewide exceeded actual enrollment and the funds could not be \nreappropriated for other Sheff purposes without express legislative authority. \n\"16.  Hartford Public Schools allocated seats in Naylor School as one of the Hartford \nschools participating in Reverse Choice.  Naylor School is located in Hartford near the \nWethersfield border. \n\"17.  Naylor School in Hartford, the only Reverse Open Choice Hartford School \nincluded in the interim benchmark figures, is operating pursuant to an Enrollment Management \nPlan (\"EMP\") approved by the State Department of Education on November 24, 2009.  Hartford \nPublic Schools submitted the EMP in accordance with the EMP template prior to November 13, \n2009, upon notice to Naylor from the State that the State intended to include Naylor's enrollment \nfigures in the interim benchmark calculation.  Hartford Public Schools received verbal and \nwritten notice that its EMP had been accepted.  The initial acceptance notice, dated December \n10, 2009, was reissued on December 30, 2009, to clarify that acceptance of the EMP applied to \nHartford Sheff-related programming and was not limited to Hartford magnet schools. \n\"18.  For 2009-2010, Naylor enrolled 665 students-134 non-minority students (20%) \nand 531 minority students (80%). \n\"19.  Eleven of the 665 Naylor students are non-Hartford-resident students and were \nenrolled in Naylor through the Reverse Open Choice program.  Ten of the 11 non-Hartford \nresident students are minority.\" \n-7-\n\nB. \nThe plaintiffs argue that Naylor students cannot be deemed to be in a reduced-isolation \nsetting for three reasons: \n(a) Paragraph II.C.5.c4 of the April stipulation allowing a 5 percent increase to the \n75 percent desegregation standard does not apply to Naylor \"because the 521 Hartford minority \nstudents are not enrolled at Naylor through the Open Choice program under paragraphs I.K.2 \nand II.C.5.c; rather the II non-Hartford-resident students are;\" \n(b) Naylor's program \"does not qualify as a voluntary interdistrict program under \nparagraph l.F5 because 90.9% of the transfer students are minority and therefore such transfers \ndo not 'contribute to the reduction of racial and ethnic isolation;\"' \n(c) Even if Naylor's program qualified \"as a voluntary interdistrict program under \nparagraph I.F, the increase of 5 percentage points to the 75% limit does not apply ... because \n4  Paragraph II.C.5.c states: \"Hartford-resident minority students who are enrolled in a \nVoluntary Interdistrict Program that does not provide a reduced-isolation setting will be included \nin any interim performance benchmark calculation or goal calculation during the term of this \nStipulation only if ( 1) the school is operating pursuant to an approved Enrollment Management \nPlan pursuant to Part IV.A. below, and (2) the minority enrollment in such school does not \nexceed the Desegregation Standard by more than 5%.  In no case shall any Voluntary \nInterdistrict Program be included within this exception for more than two of the five years of this \nStipulation.\" \n5  Paragraph I. F states: \"Open Choice is a voluntary interdistrict transfer program that allows \nstudents to transfer between Hartford and the suburban school districts when such transfers \ncontribute to the reduction of racial and ethnic isolation.\" \n-8-\n\nparagraph II.C.5.c applies only to schools operating under an approved Enrollment Management \nPlan pursuant to paragraph IV.A\" and that paragraph does not apply to Open Choice. \nThe state and the city of Hartford disagree.  In its objection to the plaintiffs' motion/' the \nstate argues that the Reverse Choice program utilized at Naylor School is consistent with the \nApril stipulation's stated goals.  It notes that Open Choice falls within the voluntary interdistrict \nprograms as defined in paragraph LA and that Open Choice is one of the \"instruments employed \nunder this Stipulation to reduce racial, ethnic, and economic isolation.\"  Unlike the plaintiffs, it \nasserts that paragraph II.C.5.c applies because Naylor's enrollment is within the 80 percent \ndesegregation standard and because it is operating pursuant to an approved enrollment \nmanagement plan.  It argues that paragraph II.C.5.c was designed to cover the schools that were \nnot immediately compliant and reflected the reality that it takes time - at least a couple of \nyears-to meet the 75 percent desegregation standard.  Indeed, the state notes that this is exactly \nwhat occurred with most of the Hartford-host magnet schools.  They initially opened with \nsuburban enrollment of mostly minority students, but the non-minority student enrollment \nincreased over time and thus, for the 2009-2010 school year, eight of ten Hartford host magnet \nschools were included in the benchmark figures.  (See January stipulations of fact, paragraph \n6  The state filed its objection to the plaintiff's corrected motion for material breach of \nstipulation on January 7, 2010.  Neither the plaintiffs nor the city of Hartford, which noted its \nobjection to the plaintiffs' motion at the hearing, chose to file responsive memoranda. \n-9-\n\n[para.] 21.)  As a new participant in the Reverse Choice program, Naylor appears to be following \nthat same pattern. \nThe parties, of course, differ as to the meaning of the phrase \"an approved Enrollment \nManagement Plan pursuant to Part IV.A\" used in paragraph II.C.5.c.  The state also rejects the \nplaintiffs' third argument that paragraph II.C.5.c does not apply to the Open Choice program \nbecause it is not mentioned; the state argues that paragraph IV.A is not so limiting and, \nmoreover, paragraph IV.A.3 provides a \"catch all\" provision.  The state also maintains that the \nplaintiffs' argument that the Hartford-resident minority students are not enrolled through an \nOpen Choice plan ignores other provisions of the April stipulation and the overall intent ofthe \nparties to \"increase the number of Hartford-resident minority students in a reduced-isolation \neducational setting\" through voluntary interdistrict programs that include Open Choice and thus \nReverse Choice. \nFinally, the state disagrees with the plaintiffs' second argument that the Naylor program \ndoes not qualify as a voluntary interdistrict program because 90.9 percent of the transfer students \nare minority and therefore it does not meet the requirement of paragraph I.F that the transfers \n\"contribute to the reduction of racial and ethnic isolation.\"  The 90.9 perce1it figure translates to \njust ten students; in the 2009-2010 school year, Naylor has 134 non-minority students (20 \npercent) and 531 minority students (80 percent).  (January stipulations of fact, paras.18 and 19.) \nThe state argues that consistent with the integration patterns of the Hartford-host magnets, \n-10-\n\ndiscussed above, Naylor will follow the same pattern, which inevitably requires time especially \nin light of the demographics of the first ring of towns surrounding Hartford. 7 \nIII \n\"A stipulated judgment is not a judicial detern1ination of any litigated right. ... It may \nbe defined as a contract of the parties acknowledged in open court and ordered to be recorded by \na court of competent jurisdiction. . . . The essence of the judgment is that the parties to the \nlitigation have voluntarily entered into an agreement setting their dispute or disputes at rest and \nthat, upon this agreement, the court has entered judgment conforming to the terms of the \nagreement.\"  (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)

Dougherty discussed a \nreport, \"Missing the Goal: A Visual Guide to Sheffvs. O'Neill School Desegregation June \n2007,\" that compiled data obtained from state sources about the school districts in the Sheff \nregion and beyond.  The report compared minority population by school district for the 1988-\n1989 and 2006-2007 school years and showed that each district's minority population, except for \nHartford and Bloomfield, had at least doubled in those years.  For example, Windsor's minority \npopulation increased from 31 percent in 1988-1989 to 66 percent in 2006-2007.  Windsor's \nschool district hosted thirteen Open Choice students in the 2006-2007 school year making up \nthree-tenths of one percent of its total enrollment.  In Bloomfield, the minority population \nincreased from 74 percent in 1988-1989 to 95 percent in 2006-2007, but the report does not state \nhow many Open Choice students attended Bloomfield's schools. \n-11-\n\nbeing a question of the parties' intent, is a question of fact ...

Detels v. Detels, 79 Conn. App. 467, 472, 830 A.2d \n381 (2003). \n-12-\n\nA. \nThis dispute concerns the definiteness of the language of the April stipulation as it \napplies generally to the use of Reverse Choice in the Hartford public school system, and \nspecifically, to the counting of Hartford-resident minority students attending Naylor School \ntoward the interim performance benchmark for the 2009-2010 school year.  The parties \nestablished that 27 percent of Hartford-resident minority students shall be in a reduced-isolation \neducational setting for the 2009-2010 school year pursuant to paragraph II.C.5.a.2.  Paragraph \nII.C.5.c allows \"Hartford-resident minority students who are enrolled in a Voluntary Interdistrict \nProgram that does not provide a reduced-isolation setting [to] be included in any interim \nperformance benchmark calculation or goal calculation during the term of this Stipulation only if \n( 1) the school is operating pursuant to an approved Enrollment Management Plan pursuant to \nPart IV.A below, and (2) the minority enrollment in such school does not exceed the \nDesegregation Standard by more than 5%.\" \nIn paragraph I. A of the April stipulation, voluntary interdistrict programs are defined as \n\"instruments employed under this Stipulation to reduce racial, ethnic, and economic isolation\" \nand specifically include Open Choice.  \"Open Choice is among those programs that the State has \nemployed to reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation.\"  (January stipulations of fact, para. \n3.)  In tum, Open Choice is defined in paragraph I.F as \"a voluntary interdistrict program that \nallows students to transfer between Hartford and the suburban school districts when such \n-13-\n\ntransfers contribute to the reduction of racial and ethnic isolation.\"8  This definition permits the \ntransfer of students both into and out ofthe Hartford public school system.9  The parties also \nstipulate that Reverse Choice, although not specifically mentioned in the April stipulation, 10 is \npart of the Open Choice program.  (January stipulations of fact, para. 9.)  Thus, Reverse Choice, \nor the transfer of suburban students into the Hartford public schools, is part of Open Choice and \nis, therefore, a voluntary interdistrict program. \nAccording to paragraph I.K, a reduced-isolation setting \"refers to an educational setting \nwith reduced racial, ethnic, and economic isolation.\"  This term is further defined in \nsubparagraph one and two: \"1. An Interdistrict Magnet School, State Technical School, Regional \n8  Unlike other paragraphs of the April stipulation including, but not limited to, paragraphs I. A, \nI.G, I.K, II.B, II.C.l-5, II.D, paragraph I.F's definition of\"Open Choice\" is the only definition \nthat did not mention economic isolation.  Interestingly, the parties use the phrase \"racial, ethnic \nand economic isolation\" in paragraph three of the January stipulations of fact. \n9  The court notes \"[u  ]ntil the 2009-2010 application year, Open Choice has been directed at \npermitting Hartford-resident students to attend public schools in nearby towns.\"  (January \nstipulations of fact, para. 4.)  For the present school year,\"1 065 suburban students timely applied \nto attend a Hartford public school through the Open Choice program.\"  (ld., para. 10.)  \"The \nState authorized the allocation of a maximum of 75 seats in Hartford Public Schools for purposes \nof Reverse Choice for the 2009-2010 school year.\"  (Id., para. 15.) \n10  Whether the failure to discuss or to include Reverse Choice in the April stipulation was \nintentional or an oversight or, to a lesser degree, whether the omission of the word \"economic\" \nfrom the phrase in paragraph I.F was intentional or again, an oversight, ambiguity exists within \nthe April stipulation.  See Tallmadge Bros., Inc. v. Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., \nsupra, 252 Conn. 498 (\"any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the \ncontract rather than from one party's subjective perception of the terms\" [internal quotation \nmarks omitted]). \n-14-\n\nVocational Agriculture Center, or Charter School shall be deemed to provide a reduced-isolation \nsetting if its enrollment is such that the percentage of minority students in the school does not \nexceed the Desegregation Standard.  2. A school that enrolls Hartford-resident minority students \nthrough the Open Choice program shall be deemed to provide a reduced-isolation setting.\" \nThus, schools that participate in Open Choice are deemed reduced-isolation settings if they \nenroll Hartford-resident minority students regardless of the minority population. \nBy the express language of the April stipulation, a school, like Naylor, that participates in \nReverse Choice as an Open Choice program should be deemed to provide a reduced-isolation \nsetting because I.K.2 does not take into account minority population.  However, Hartford-\nresident minority students attending Naylor are not enrolled through the Open Choice program \nas I.K.2 requires nor are they transfer students under I.F. \nAt the end of oral argument on January 7, 2010, plaintiffs' counsel indicated that \nHartford-resident minority students at Naylor could be counted toward the interim benchmark \nonly if Naylor met the 75 percent desegregation standard, not the 80 percent desegregation \nstandard. 11  Such an interpretation is not supported by language of the April stipulation or its \nunderlying intent.  Under paragraph II.C.5.c, Hartford-resident minority students enrolled in a \nvoluntary interdistrict program that does not provide a reduced-isolation setting will be included \nin any interim performance benchmark calculation if the school operates under an enrollment \n11  Plaintiffs' counsel stated, \"[W]e wouldn't be here if[Naylor] met the seventy-five percent \nnumber.\" \n-15-\n\nmanagement plan pursuant to Part IV.A and the minority enrollment in the school does not \nexceed 80 percent.  Hartford-resident minority students enrolled at Naylor may not be enrolled \nthrough Open Choice, but are enrolled in a voluntary interdistrict program-Reverse Choice as \npart of the Open Choice program.  It is undisputed that Naylor does not currently provide a \nreduced-isolation setting.  Therefore, the Hartford-resident minority students enrolled at Naylor \nshould be included in the benchmark calculation if it has an enrollment management plan \npursuant to Part IV.A and its minority enrollment does not exceed 80 percent.  Naylor \nundisputedly has an enrollment management plan and its minority enrollment does not exceed \n80 percent.12 \nNevertheless, the plaintiffs argue that Part IV.A does not apply to a Reverse Choice \nschool.  A review of Part IV.A indicates that none of the three subparagraphs specifically \nmentions Open Choice or Reverse Choice.  Subparagraph one prescribes enrollment \nmanagement plans for existing magnet schools not meeting the desegregation standard and \nsubparagraph two concerns enrollment management plans for new interdistrict magnet schools, \ncharter schools, regional vocational schools, agricultural centers or state technical schools not \nmeeting the desegregation standard in their second year of operation.  Subparagraph three is, \nhowever, more general and, while it does not mention any particular school, it provides that \n12  For the present school year, Naylor School enrolled a total of 665 students which includes \neleven transfer students: 134 non-minority (20 percent) and 531 minority students (80 percent); \nand ten of the eleven transfer students were minority students.  (January stipulation of facts, \nparas. 18 and 19.) \n-16-\n\n\"[t]he State is responsible for overseeing the development, implementation, and effectiveness of \neach Enrollment Management Plan.  The Enrollment Management Plan shall be directed toward \ncompliance with the Desegregation Standard within the period specified in such Plan approved \nby the State.\"  Thus, although it does not mention a particular voluntary interdistrict program, \nsubparagraph three sets forth requirements of general applicability for all enrollment \nmanagement plans.  Hence, a Reverse Choice school, like a magnet school, that does not meet \nthe desegregation standard must operate under an enrollment management plan pursuant to Part \nIV.A, in addition to other requirements, and must comply with the dictates of the state \nconcerning the \"development, implementation, and effectiveness\" of said plan or the enrollment \nmanagement plan must \"be directed toward compliance with the Desegregation Standard within \nthe period specified in such Plan.\"  The fact that Reverse Choice is not specifically listed does \nnot mean that Part IV.A does not apply; subparagraph three sets forth the requirements for all \nenrollment management plans.  Indeed, if simply moved to the beginning and renumbered as \nsubparagraph one, it would be patently clear.  This court finds that Part IV.A applies to a \nReverse Choice school. \nAdditionally, as previously stated, Reverse Choice is not specifically mentioned in the \nApril stipulation, but its role as part of the Open Choice program is not questioned.  As noted by \nthe state, Reverse Choice is provided for in the comprehensive plan and, in fact, is provided for \n-17-\n\nin General Statutes § 10 -266aa ( c ).13  With the strong demand to attend Hartford public schools as \nevidenced by the 1065 suburban students applying14 (January stipulations of fact, para. 10); the \n; \nReverse Choice program will likely be essential in reducing racial, ethnic and economic isolation \nin the Hartford schools.15 \n13  Section 10 -266aa, in relevant part, provides: \"b) There is established, within available \nappropriations, an interdistrict public school attendance program. The purpose of the program \nshall be to: ( 1) Improve academic achievement; (2) reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation \nor preserve racial and ethnic balance; and (3) provide a choice of educational programs for \nstudents enrolled in the public schools. The Department of Education shall provide oversight for \nthe program, including the setting of reasonable limits for the transportation of stud~nts \nparticipating in the program, and may provide for the incremental expansion of the program for \nthe school year commencing in 2000 for each town required to participate in the program \npursuant to subsection (c) of this section. \n\"(c) The program shall be phased in as provided in this subsection. (1) For the school \nyear commencing in 1998, and for each school year thereafter, the program shall be in operation \nin the Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport regions. The Hartford program shall operate as a \ncontinuation of the program described in section 10 -266j. Students who reside in Hartford, New \nHaven or Bridgeport may attend school in another school district in the region and students who \nreside in such other school districts may attend school in Hartford, New Haven or Bridgeport \n14  The state noted in its objection to the plaintiffs' motion that during the 2007 hearing before \nthis court, the plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Gerald Stevens, agreed that the Sheff remedy would be more \neffective ifthe Hartford school system is healthy. \n15  At oral argument on January 7, 20 I 0, counsel for the state argued: \"Using Reverse Choice, \nincluding Naylor, even at these early stages, creates an opportunity for the state to demonstrate \nthat with time, a voluntary regional school district system can work, and offer the benefits of a \nreduced isolation setting to both Hartford and suburban students. \n\"Denying the state this tool creates a situation in which aside from the 3500 or so \nHartford students who are in magnet schools, or charter schools or the [vocational-technical] \nschools, approximately 18,000 minority [students] who are in Hartford, with a demand for \ndesegregated settings can only have this opportunity if they leave Hartford under traditional open \nchoice to go to the surrounding suburban districts. \n-18-\n\nFurthermore, more than 60 percent of the Hartford-area suburban schools participating in \nOpen Choice have non-minority student populations in excess of80 percent.  (Id., para. 5.) \nTherefore, Naylor, with 134 non-minority students, or 20 percent of its student body, might be \nfar more diverse than a suburban school. \nB. \n\"A contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined \nfrom the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the \ncircumstances connected with the transaction.\"  (Internal quotation marks omitted.)  Tallmadge \nBros., Inc. v. Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., supra, 252 Conn. 498.  There is no \nquestion here about the overall intention and good faith of all parties to meet the mandates of our \nSupreme Court's directive.  It is clear from the April stipulation and the January stipulations of \n\"A failure to count Naylor, even and especially at this stage, puts forth the message that \nthe Hartford public schools have no worth as a viable option for obtaining a quality education. \n\"It makes no sense to argue, as the plaintiffs must, that two minority students attending \nan A von public school make that an integrated setting for purposes of meeting the \n[desegregation] standard. \n\"But two white students attending the Naylor School in Hartford do not create an \nintegrated setting for the same purpose.  We're not saying that we count all the kids in the \nsuburban school[s].  We're saying, though, that those Hartford minority students should be \ncounted for purposes of being in an integrated setting. \n\"And so, plaintiffs argument eventually boils down to a statement that a minority student \ncoming from a suburban town into Hartford somehow isn't as good to count as a non-minority \nstudent coming from the same town, thus making this case solely fixated on race and not on \neconomic or ethnic isolation.\" \n-19-\n\nfact that \"the parties have a mutual interest in reducing the racial, ethnic, and economic isolation \nof students in the Hartford Public Schools.\" \nYet, it is also clear that the April stipulation did not explicitly mention the term Reverse \nChoice or how Hartford-resident minority students in Reverse Choice should be counted toward \nthe interim goal.  As noted earlier, it could be argued that pursuant to the paragraph LF definition \nof Open Choice that Naylor is deemed a reduced-isolation setting regardless of its minority \nstudent population and, therefore, all of Naylor's Hartford-resident minority students should be \ncounted to the goaL  It could also be asserted that no Hartford-resident minority students in a \nschool that participates in Reverse Choice should be counted toward the interim goal because the \nApril stipulation does not expressly provide for it.  Thus, ambiguity exists in the April \nstipulation.  See Tallmadge Bros., Inc. v. Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., supra, 252 \nConn. 498. \nThe state attempted to resolve the confusion concerning Reverse Choice more than one \nyear ago, but to no avail.  The January stipulations of fact, extrinsic factual evidence to the April \nstipulation, assist in detem1ining the intent of the parties.  See Tallmadge Bros., Inc. v. Iroquois \nGas Transmission System, L.P., supra, 252 Conn. 495; see also TIE Communications, Inc. v. \nKopp, 218 Conn. 281,288-89,589 A.2d 329 (1991) (evidence, also called parol evidence, cannot \nbe utilized to vary or contradict terms of integrated agreement, but may be admitted to explain \nambiguities or to add missing term to agreement that indicates on its face that it does not set \nforth complete agreement).  Those January stipulations of fact, submitted by agreement ofthe \n-20-\n\nparties for the sole purpose of resolving this dispute, indicate that Reverse Choice, a program \nauthorized by statute, is clearly a part of the Open Choice program and one of the \"programs \nemployed by the State to reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation.\"  Further, Naylor School \nis \"one of the Hartford schools participating in Reverse Choice.\"  Finally, as noted in the January \nstipulation of facts and confirmed by the letter, dated February 25, 2009, attached to the January \nstipulation of facts, the plaintiffs took no position on Reverse Choice other than to raise funding \nissues.  This evidence resolves the ambiguities in the contract by clearly demonstrating the \nparties' intent to include Reverse Choice as an appropriate voluntary interdistrict program as part \nof the Open Choice program.  As such, Naylor School qualifies as providing a reduced-isolation \nsetting pursuant to paragraph I.K.2.  Further, paragraph II.C.5.c evinces the parties \nunderstanding, through their experience with the Hartford-host magnet schools, that a few years \nare needed to commence and operate a program that will meet the 75 percent desegregation \nstandard.  Paragraph II.C.5.c appropriately applies to the 521 Hartford-resident minority students \nattending Naylor School and they were properly counted toward the interim benchmark. 16 \nIV. \nFor the above reasons, this court denies the plaintiffs' corrected motion for material \nbreach of the April stipulation and sustains the state's objection thereto. \nBerger, J.  \\ \n16  The court notes that the interim period is expiring and issues remain as to the changing \ndemographics of the region; see footnote 7; and the ambiguities in the April stipulation. \n-21-",

All such training shall be \nconducted by CREC and the costs of such training shall be included in the \nState-CREC contract described herein. \n \n8 \n\nD.7.3.4.6  CREC shall be responsible for magnet program planning \nand program assessing activities and the costs of such planning and \nassessing shall be included in the State-CREC contract described herein. \n         \nD.7.3.4.7  CREC shall provide advisory assistance to the Hartford \nPublic Schools in facility-use planning so that development of the \nHartford Host Magnet Schools is coordinated with facility planning for the \nDistrict as a whole, and the costs of such advisory assistance shall be \nincluded in the State-CREC contract described herein. The State shall \nprovide special assistance and  ‘good offices’ to Hartford on CREC-\napproved facility projects, including but not limited to facility \nconversions, consolidations, renovations and new construction. \n \nD.7.3.4.8  CREC shall develop a transition procedure to effect the \ntransition from CREC management to Hartford management of the \nHartford Host Magnet Schools at the end of Phase II, and the costs of such \ntransition work shall be included in the State-CREC contract described \nherein. \n \n \nE.   FOUNDATIONAL ISSUES \n \nE.1  Each issue described below is critical to Phase II effectiveness and therefore shall be \naddressed by specific provisions or recommendations in the Comprehensive Management Plan \nfor Phase II described herein. \n \nE.2  OPEN CHOICE \n \nThe financing model historically has provided insufficient incentive to suburban districts to \nparticipate in the program at maximum level.   \n \nThe financing problem is exacerbated for Open Choice applicants in middle school and high \nschool, and for those with special needs, whose cost of education is higher than that of \nelementary level students in regular programs. \n \nThe State has historically been unable to induce suburban districts to make seats available to \nOpen Choice students commensurate with the demand for seats, resulting in waitlists. \n \nThere are no requirements that suburban districts participate in Open Choice, or that they \nparticipate at minimum levels or increase their level of participation from year to year. \n \nSuburban districts have historically been permitted to build schools and add capacity with no \nprovision for new seats for Open Choice students, thereby allowing State investment in new \nschools not to contribute to expansion of the Open Choice program. \n \n9 \n\nNo constraints are placed on which suburban districts may be sought by Hartford-resident \nstudents seeking placement in Open Choice.  This contributes to inefficiency in transportation \nservice.  Consideration should be given to pairing certain geographic sections of Hartford with \ncertain suburban districts in the interest of making transportation service efficient and shortening \nbus ride time for students. \n             \nE.3  REGIONAL MAGNET SCHOOLS               \n       \nThe financing model works as a disincentive for districts to allow students to participate, since \nthey are required to provide a portion of the operating cost of these schools in the form of tuition \nfor their students. \n \nHistorically, the financing model has resulted in chronic underfunding of these schools, requiring \nregular supplemental funding to resolve financial shortfalls.  \n \nThe magnets are intended to be instruments of Sheff desegregation, but in the aggregate they \nenroll more Minority students from the suburbs than Minority students from Hartford. \n \nThese magnets are models of instructional innovation.  But the contact between them and \nHartford Host Magnet Schools, or between them and regular Hartford schools, has been minimal.  \nAs a result, the lessons of their exemplary programs are not shared with other schools in the \nregion.  Nor are these exemplar schools used as sites for the training of teachers and \nadministrators in the region. \n   \nIntegration programs by definition depend on a two-way flow of students; otherwise, students of \none racial group bear a disproportionate share of the burden of traveling to get to integrated \nschools.  For this reason, and also for reason of strengthening Hartford as the region’s center \ncity, sites in the city should be seen as preferred options for future regional magnet schools.  In \nthe alternative, Hartford Host Magnet Schools should be seen as the preferred form of new inter-\ndistrict magnet schools.  This requires more intensive planning than has been demonstrated to \ndate. \n \n \nE.4  HARTFORD HOST MAGNET SCHOOLS \n           \nThe financing model prevents Hartford from obtaining sufficient funds to plan and develop \nmagnets before they open for students, a critical period in magnet school development \nrecognized by the federal Magnet Schools Assistance Program but not by the State. \n \nThese magnets have opened with insufficient White students to meet the Desegregation Standard \nof Sheff.    \n \nThe planning and development of these magnets is unconnected to the development of the \nRegional Magnet Schools, a consequence of their control by different governing bodies.  \n \n10 \n\nSecondary magnet schools (Grades 6-8, 6-12,  9-12) with career themes (Law & Public Service, \nHealth Careers, Business & Finance, Mass Communications, etc.) are under-represented in the \nRegional and Hartford magnets developed to date.  They represent a potential attraction for both \ncity and suburban students, especially if partnered with respected non-school institutions.  The \nAcademies of Art and Math-Science are working models.  Concerted planning in this direction \nhas been absent.           \n \nAs magnet schools, these schools are models of instructional innovation in the city district.  As \nsuch, they should be paired with non-magnet schools in the city for the purpose of sharing their \ninstructional assets with other schools.  \n \nF.  ACCOUNTABILITY \n \nF.1  All Phase II implementation contracts described herein, both for their original terms and \nrenewal terms, shall be subject to sign-off by the Plaintiffs, who shall have a 30-day review \nperiod from receipt of each such proposed contract.  Disputes shall be resolved by the State and \nthe Plaintiffs.  Unresolved disputes shall be referred to the Court for resolution. \n \nF.2   The Comprehensive Management Plan described herein shall be approved by the State by \nJanuary 31, 2009 and is subject to sign-off by the Plaintiffs who shall have 30 days following \nreceipt of the Plan approved by the State to sign off on the Plan or to submit objections to the \nState and to CREC.  In the event of Plaintiffs’ objections, the State and Plaintiffs shall resolve \nsuch objections or refer the matter to the Court. \n \nF.3  Subsequent amendments to the Comprehensive Management Plan shall be approved by \nthe State, and shall be subject to sign-off by the Plaintiffs who shall have 20 days following \nreceipt of the amendment(s) approved by the State t sign off on the amendment(s) or to submit \nobjections to the State and to CREC.  In the event of Plaintiffs’ objections, the State and \nPlaintiffs shall resolve such objections or refer the matter to the Court. \n \nF.4  Plaintiffs shall be provided copies of the Minutes of the Work Meetings described herein \nconducted by CREC, as well as the annual Implementation Reports produced by CREC \ndescribed herein. \n \nF.5  There shall be semi-annual meet and confer meetings between the State and the Plaintiffs.  \nOther entities or persons mutually agreed by the parties may be invited to attend. \n \nF.6  There shall be an annual status conference with the Court throughout Phase II scheduled \njointly by the State and the Plaintiffs. \n \nF.7  The State shall report annually in August of each year during Phase II data and \ninformation as described in Attachment A as well as such supplemental information the State \nmay deem relevant. \n \nF.8  During Phase II, the Plaintiffs may re-open negotiations with the State regarding the \ncontent of this Phase II Plan should the Plaintiffs view the Plan as having produced unforeseen \n11 \n\nnegative consequences for the interest of Hartford-resident Minority students in integrated \neducational opportunity.  Disputes may be referred to the Court for resolution. \n   \nF.9   The Plaintiffs will monitor implementation of Phase II for the purpose of contributing to \nPhase II effectiveness.  The State shall reimburse the Plaintiffs quarterly for the costs of \nmonitoring Phase II implementation.  Plaintiffs’ reimbursement requests shall be resolved by the \nCourt as necessary. \n \nF.10  Plaintiffs shall be free to communicate directly with CREC or any alternative entity \nserving as contractor to the State for Phase II implementation.   \n \nF.11  In the interest of effective monitoring, the State and its Phase II contractor(s) shall timely \nprovide such information and data that may be requested by the Plaintiffs, and relevant State \nemployees shall be made available to Plaintiffs for discussions and interviews.  Plaintiffs may \nrequest data and information in forms and formats suitable for monitoring purposes.  Disputed \nissues of Plaintiffs’ access to persons or information will be resolved by the Court. \n \nF.12  Plaintiffs will provide the State and its Phase II contractor(s) copies of its monitoring \nfindings and recommendations and will make their counsel or other representatives available to \nthe State and its Phase II contractor(s) to discuss such reports when the State or the contractor(s) \nso request. \n \nF.13  Plaintiffs’ monitoring recommendations shall be given due consideration by the State and \nits Phase II contractor(s)  for implementation.  Matters of dispute shall be referred to the Court \nfor resolution. \n \nF.14  Throughout Phase II and during any inactive period of the case, the State or the Plaintiffs \nmay re-open the Phase II Plan to propose modification(s) intended to further the results of the \nPlan.  Proposed modifications that cannot be resolved by agreement of the parties may be \nreferred to the Court for resolution. \n   \nF.15  The following failures shall be considered matters of material breach by the State: \n \nF.15.1 Failure by April 1, 2008, to execute the CREC contracts described herein.   \n \nF.15.2 Failure by April 1, 2008 to execute a State letter of agreement with the Hartford \nPublic Schools delineating Hartford’s agreement to temporary CREC management of the \nHartford Host Magnet Schools during Phase II as described herein.  \n \nF.15.3  Failure by October 1, 2008, to have all pre-Phase II Regional  Magnet Schools \nand Hartford Host Magnet Schools comply with the Desegregation Standard, or in the \nalternative, to have non-compliant schools operating with a corrective action plan as \nprescribed herein. \n \nF.15.4 Failure by January 31, 2009 to approve the Comprehensive Management Plan \ndeveloped by CREC. \n12 \n\n \nF.15.5  Failure during Phase II to act timely on amendments to the Plan recommended by \nCREC. \n \nF.15.6  Failure by the opening of the second school year of any new Regional Magnet \nSchool or new Hartford Host Magnet School to comply with the Desegregation Standard. \n \nF.15.7  Failure during Phase II to permit any inter-district magnet school not in \ncompliance with the Desegregation Standard to operate without a corrective action plan \nas prescribed herein.  \n \nF.15.8  Failure to meet the annual benchmarks of progress set forth in the Comprehensive \nManagement Plan, beginning with Year II of the Plan. \n \nF.15.9  Failure to maintain in force and to make timely payments on the contracts with \nCREC as described herein. \n \nF.15.10  Failure to respond timely to requests from the Plaintiffs for information or \naccess to State employees in relation to the Plaintiffs’ monitoring responsibility described \nherein. \n \n \nG.   GOAL MEASUREMENT \n \nG.1  Measurement of Goal attainment during Phase II and during any period of inactive status \nof Sheff shall be performed only as described herein.   \n \nG.2  In November of the final school year of Phase II, the State shall convene a meeting with \nthe Plaintiffs for the purpose of demonstrating its attainment of the Goal of Phase II as set forth \nherein.  At that time, the State will seek to show that: \n \nG.2.1  At minimum, the aggregate number of pre-Phase II seats in Regional Magnet \nSchools, Hartford Host Magnet Schools and Open Choice as defined herein has at \nminimum been doubled; and, in addition, \n \nG.2.2  For two of the final three years of Phase II including the final year, there is no \nunmet demand for seats in integrated settings as defined herein by Hartford-resident \nMinority students. \n \nG.2.3  In the counting of seats at he end of Phase II to determine whether the number has \nbeen doubled at minimum, the operative number is the total seats in the three programs \ncombined, not the number of seats in each respective program.  Seats in schools that do \nnot meet the Desegregation Standard at the time of the count shall not be counted. \n   \nG.2.4  For purposes of this Plan, meeting all demand for seats in integrated settings shall \nbe demonstrated only by a showing that no Minority students resident in Hartford are on \n13 \n\nwait-lists on October 1 awaiting placement in Regional Magnet Schools, Hartford Host \nMagnet Schools or the Open Choice program. \n \nG.2.4.1  Applicants on wait lists to Regional Magnet Schools, Hartford \nHost Magnet Schools or Open Choice who were offered placement by October 1 \nin any of these programs, including a program for which they did not apply, shall \nnot be counted as wait listed whether or not the placement offer was accepted.   \n \nG.2.4.2  Placement offers to a school in noncompliance at the time of the \noffer with the Desegregation Standard shall not be considered valid offers.   \n \nG.3  Should Plaintiffs concur that the State’s showing demonstrates attainment of the Goal, \nPlaintiffs will make an appropriate filing with the Court, independently or jointly, to bring about \nplacement of Sheff in an inactive status by the Court.  \n \nG.3.1  Once placed in an inactive status, Sheff shall so remain for an indefinite period to \nensure that demand by Hartford-resident Minority students continues to be fully met \nconsistent with the goal of Phase II.   \n \nG.3.2  If such demand is fully met for nine consecutive years, the State may petition the \nCourt for closure of the case.  The period of nine years will ensure that a Hartford-\nresident Minority student enrolled in Kindergarten at the start of the inactive period will \nhave reached high school with certainty of an integrated option from Kindergarten \nthrough Grade 12.  \n \n  G.3.3  During the period of inactive status: \n \nG.3.3.1  The State shall increase the number of seats in integrated settings \nor take other necessary steps to meet fully the demand for integrated education of \nHartford-resident Minority students. \n \nG.3.3.2  The State shall produce annual reports and provide them to the \nPlaintiffs consistent in form and content with the annual reports produced during \nPhase II.  \n \nG.3.3.3  The State at its discretion, and at its own risk, may continue, \nmodify or end its contracts with CREC or other external contractors engaged to \nhelp plan and implement Phase II; \n \nG.3.3.4  The State shall meet and confer with the Plaintiffs on its own \ninitiative or at Plaintiffs’ request.  \n \nG.3.3.5  The Plaintiffs may petition the Court to reactivate Sheff by a claim \nthat the Goal of Phase II is not being met or that the Plan has produced unforeseen \nnegative consequences for the interest of Hartford-resident Minority students in \nintegrated educational opportunity.   \n14 \n\n   \nG.4  Should Plaintiffs as a result of the Phase II conference with the State described above view \nthe Phase II Goal as not having been met, Phase II shall be extended for a period of two years. \n       \nG.4.1  Extensions shall be effected by agreement of the Parties with notice to the Court, \nor by determination of the Court that the Goal of Phase II has not been met. \n \nG.4.2  There shall be as many two-year extensions as necessary to attain the Goal of \nPhase II.   \n \nG.4.3  Prior to each extension, the Court will appoint a special master with authority to \noversee State compliance work and to issue directives to the Commissioner of Education \nto further compliance.   \n \nG.4.3.1  At its discretion, the Court may request nominations from the Parties to \nfill the position of special master.   \n \n   G.4.3.2  The State shall bear the costs of the office of special master.   \n \n \n \n \n15 \n\n \nATTACHMENT A \n \n \nAnnual Report Specifications  \n \nMinimum Data and Information  \nto be Reported by the State during Phase II \n \n   \n \n \n  A.

B. 2 of that Phase II Stipulation were not \nmet by the Defendants; and \nWHEREAS, Section II. C. 4 of the Stipulation authorizes a one-year extension upon mutual \nagreement of the parties to achieve the 80% demand benchmark or 41% integration standard; \nand \nWHEREAS, the parties have a mutual interest in reducing the racial, ethnic, and economic \nisolation of students in the Hartford Public Schools; and \nWHEREAS, this agreement represents reasonable measures to reduce racial, ethnic, and \neconomic isolation in the Hartford Public Schools for the 2013-14 school year until June 30, \n2014;and \n\nWHEREAS, the parties are cognizant that efforts will need to continue beyond June 30,2014 to \nfurther reduce racial, ethnic, and economic isolation in the Hartford Public Schools; and \nWHEREAS, the parties do hereby knowingly and voluntarily enter into this Stipulation and \nagree to be bound thereby; \nNOW THEREFORE, the parties herebystipulate and agree as follows: \nI.  EXTENSION OF STIPULATION \nA.  Pursuant to Section II. C. 4 of the Phase II Stipulation, the Phase II Stipulation shall be \nextended for a period of one year, until June 30, 2014.

C.4 of the Phase II Stipulation, Defendants shall provide \n· the necessary resources to plan, develop, open and operate the schools and programs set \nforth in Appendix A hereto as a Plan for achieving either benchmark within the one year \nextension period in accordance with the terms below.  The patties acknowledge and agree \nwith respect to all provisions of the Phase II Stipulation as are being modified by this \nextension that the plan set forth in Appendix A and elsewhere in this extension represents \nthe parties' best estimate of the steps that will be most effective in meeting either the \nrequirements of demand as set forth in paragraph II.B.2.ofthe Phase II Stipulation (80%) or \nthe overall percentage of Hartford resident minority students in reduced isolation settings \nas set forth in paragraph II.C.4 of the Phase II Stipulation. However, deviation from any \n-2-\n\nprovision(s) of Appendix A, or provisions of this extension with respect to schools, grades, \nmagnet seats offered or filled, Open Choice seats offered or filled, Interdistrict Cooperative \nprograms offered or filled, or legislation proposed or passed into law, shall not be a \nmaterial breach so long as the requirement of one of the two goal paragraphs cited above is \nmet.  In the event of substantial deviation from the Plan, as reasonably determined by the \nSDE, SDE will notifY plaintiffs and meet to discuss alternate ways to modifY the Plan in \norder to accommodate the substantial deviation.  The Plan represented by Appendix A is \nbased on the following estimates and projections summarized below by program: \nProgram  Projected Hartford  Estimated Offers to \nSeats  Hartford-Resident \nStudents in Demand Pool \nMagnet Schools - Expansion of  1,395  1,674 \nExisting Capacity \nMagnet Schools-New School  522  678 \nCapacity \nOpen Choice  451  902 \nCTHSS Regional Application  155  202 \n: toJlllYh~ 2\" i}::;f;;( ;, ( j'r:,-:·:~~:i ;~:~;:~:_.>-., ~·-c,_·': ·_,_: -:,:-;::..':-:'; ';'   .2,523;.; ,' ''~4--' -~x-.. -7._;_-,-,_'. .. -.~, ;_;-_, ,:_,,:.~_;.)_,, .,-~,- - c:;c,  ,·c; ,·,  ' \nA.

The State \nand its partners will develop an appropriate assignment plan(s) for any \nsuch select school(s). \ni.  Interdistrict Cooperative Programs: The performance goal calculation \nestablished in Section III.A.5. will be increased by up to three \npercentage points for Interdistrict Cooperative Programs, as follows: A \ncredit of one percentage point shall be added for every 500 Hartford \nresident minority students who participate in meaningful and \nsubstantial Interdistrict Cooperative Programs, up to a total of three \npercentage points.  Such programs, to be considered meaningful and \nsubstantial, shall entail no less than 45 hours in duration, of which at \nleast 30 hours must be face-to-face contact time.  Time spent \ntransporting students shall not be counted in the duration.  A student \nwho participates in a program of at least 90 hours in duration, of which \nat least 60 hours is face-to-face contact time, shall be counted as 1.5 \nstudents for the purpose of this calculation. \nIV.  Sheff Administration \nA.  The State shall continue to operate the Regional School Choice Office (\"RSCO\"), \nwith its dedicated Director, to support the collaborative effort between the State \nand a group of stakeholders that support Sheff initiatives and progranuning to \nreduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation of Hartford-resident minority \n7 \n\nstudents.  Such efforts shall include an ongoing marketing, recruitment and \noutreach campaign, including maintenance of successful satellite parent \ninformation centers; appropriate data collection and analyses; implementation of \ncommon application and lottery processes; oversight of a coordinated \ntransportation program; and administration of applicable grant programs. \nB.  The satellite offices contracted by RSCO and used for recruitment during the \n2013-14 school year shall receive extensions on their contracts, as appropriate, \nand shall be staffed, trained and equipped to assist families to apply for \nopportunities offered through the Sheff choice programs.  To the extent collected \ndata and information does not suppott the continuation of one or more satellite \nsites beyond the 2013-14 school year, RSCO will discontinue such satellite offices \nand, within 90 days of the discontinuation, identify. and support the addition of \nsubstitute or additional satellite sites in strategic locations, as appropriate, to \nsupport continued outreach to and recruitment of families in the Greater Hartford \nRegion. \nC.  SDE staff, including the Commissioner of Education and the Chief Operating \nOfficer, as necessary, will continue to contact and/or meet with any district's \nboard of education, and/or superintendent, whose participation rate in Open \nChoice is, in SDE's view, substantially less than its capacity for participation, in \norder to strongly encourage greater participation. \nD.  SDE will continue to collect retention data on Open Choice and will consider the \nresults of any comprehensive and detailed study of Open Choice for future \nimplementation and improvement of the operation of Open Choice. \nE.  To the extent that Open Choice seats remain unfilled after the waitlist for Hartford \nOpen Choice applicants is exhausted, Hartford-resident applicants currently on \nmagnet school waitlists may be offered placement in an available Open Choice \nseat in the grade to which they applied, provided the applicant has not received a \nmagnet placement offer prior to the date of the Open Choice offer. \nF.  SDE will continue its efforts to move the Parent Intake Center to a more \naccessible, permanent location.  During this interim period, one of the satellite \nlocations, to be opened 12 months per year, funded and staffed at least half-time \nby personnel knowledgeable in the application process, will serve as a primary \nparent information center to support the central Parent Intake Center at 165 \nCapitol Avenue, Hartford.  SDE will consider plaintiffs' timely input as to the \nsatellite site that shall serve as the primary satellite office. \nG.  SDE shall allocate a portion of the social and academic support grant to provide a \nprofessional development support program during the school year to those \n8 \n\ndistricts accepting Open Choice students.

Measures taken by the State since that time, including those provided for \nin the Phase I Stipulation of 2003, have failed to make significant progress towards reducing the \nracial, ethnic, and economic isolation of Hartford’s resident minority public school students.    \n \nWith the July 1, 2007 expiration of the Phase I Stipulation, the State and the plaintiffs entered \ninto an agreement known as the Phase II Stipulation and Order, which was approved by the court \non June 11, 2008.  The Phase II term shall be from the date of its execution to June 30, 2013.  \nThe Phase II term may extend to include school year 2013-14.  However, by September 15, \n2012, the parties to the stipulation will meet to review the progress made under the stipulation \nand commence negotiations for a Phase III settlement, the purpose of which shall be to meet the \ndemand for integrated education of Hartford-resident minority students. \n \nThe effective implementation of Phase II is to be accomplished by the State through the creation \nand performance of the strategies identified in a Comprehensive Management Plan (CMP), and \nwith implementation assistance from a newly created Regional School Choice Office (RSCO).   \nThe CMP “must set out a connected series of goals, implementation methods, and measurements \nof  success;  centralize  authority  and  accountability;  ensure  coordination  of  key  facets  of \ndesegregation,  including  transportation,  recruitment,  and  student  support;  provide  strategic \ntargets for evaluating progress; and evaluate and address education funding needs throughout \nthe Region”.  It will frame and direct state and local efforts in the Hartford Region necessary to \nincrease and sustain the numbers of Hartford-resident minority students in reduced-isolation \neducational settings, and move the State in a thoughtful and deliberate way toward meeting the \ndemand of Hartford-resident minority students seeking placement in such settings.   \n \nImportantly, it is the State’s intention through the implementation of the CMP to create wherever \npossible the opportunity for continuous PreK-12 or K-12 educational pathways for students and \nfamilies interested in those programs in the Sheff Region.  Opportunities for continuation in \nvoluntary interdistrict programming for a child’s entire school career will be developed by \nexamining  the  themes  and  pedagogy  of  existing  programming,  and  exploring  and  forming \nnatural pathways based on grade configuration, student interest, seat availability, and applicable \nprogram preferences.  The State will support and has requested new Sheff programming that \ncreates  opportunities  for  feeder  patterns  that  promote  continuous  educational  pathways  for \nstudents,  including  those  that  provide  post-secondary  education  opportunities.    Indeed  it  is \nexpected that Hartford-resident minority school children in the Open Choice program in the \nSheff Region will have the ability to attend schools in suburban districts without a break in their \neducational experience in that district if they so choose. \n \n\nThis Plan Envisions: \n \n•  The  creation  of  a  variety  of  high  quality,  accessible,  reduced-isolation  educational \nprogramming  options  for  Hartford-resident  minority  students  through  Open  Choice, \ninterdistrict  magnet  schools,  State  technical  high  schools,  charter  schools,  regional \nvocational agriculture centers and/or interdistrict cooperative grants. \n \n•  The  development  of  a  comprehensive  and  coordinated  system  of  program  supports, \nincluding but not limited to community education and outreach, financing, marketing, \ntransportation,  and  social  and  academic  supports,  designed  to  ensure  the  successful \nparticipation of Hartford area students, families, schools and school districts in reduced-\nisolation choice program settings. \n \n•  Implementation of an integrated system directed by the State through a Regional School \nChoice Office comprised of the Hartford Public Schools, the Capitol Region Education \nCouncil, the State, and other area stakeholders as appropriate. \n \n•  The development of data collection and survey systems to inform the development of \nprograms and supports which will be most effective in achieving State education and \nintegration goals.  \n \n•  The development of a demand model designed to determine Hartford-resident minority \nstudents’ demand for reduced-isolation educational settings. \n \n•  The  development  of  a  system  to  support  integrated  education  and  best  practices  to \nimprove  academic  achievement  and  quality  education  goals  among  all  Hartford \neducational programs through training centers and pairing of non-magnet schools with \ninterdistrict programs.  \n \n•  The creation of a process for the State to accommodate and respond to such demand \nthrough the planning and managing of a system of reduced-isolation environments. \n \n \n \nOrganization of the Document \n \nThe Sheff II Stipulation and Proposed Order  define performance benchmarks, specifying a \npercentage of Hartford-resident minority students to be educated in reduced-isolation settings, \nincreasing annually.  This CMP outlines objectives and strategies the State intends to employ to \naccomplish these benchmarks.  “Measurements of Success” refer to successful implementation \nof described strategies; such process measures are in place to ensure fidelity of implementation \nof the CMP. While ultimate responsibility for meeting the goals of the Stipulation lies with the \nState certain activities have been contracted for by the State and in such cases a “Responsible \nAgency” is identified and defines the organization responsible for the implementation of specific \nactivities: the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE), the Regional School Choice \nOffice (RSCO), the Capitol Region Education Council (CREC), or Hartford Public Schools \n(HPS).  Progress toward the performance benchmarks will be continuously reviewed.  If data \nindicate that the anticipated progress may not be made, strategies will be revised accordingly.   \n \n\nI. Meeting the Goals of the Phase II Stipulation \n \nA.  The goal of this Stipulation is to increase the number of Hartford-resident minority students \nin a reduced-isolation educational setting, and to move toward meeting the demand of Hartford-\nresident minority students seeking placement in such settings.  The goal is attained by the State \nif: \n \n1.  By Year 5 of this Stipulation, at least 80% of the demand for a reduced-isolation setting \nis met; or \n2.  Notwithstanding  Part  IV.C.1.c  of  the  Stipulation,  failure  to  meet  the  80%  demand \nstandard, subject to any adjustment pursuant to Part IV.B.4 shall not constitute a material \nbreach if a minimum of 41% of Hartford-resident minority students are in a reduced-\nisolation setting by Year 5. \n \nB.  In accordance with the Stipulation, the goal is to be attained through implementation of the \nfollowing Voluntary Interdistrict Programs provided they meet the “Desegregation Standard” (as \ndefined below):   \n \no  Interdistrict Magnet Schools, including Hartford Host Magnets, Regional Magnet \nSchools, Suburban Host Magnet Schools, and Incubator Magnet Schools;  \no  Charter Schools \no  CT Technical High Schools \no  Regional Agricultural Science and Technology Centers \no  Open Choice \no  Interdistrict Cooperative Grant Programs (up to a maximum of 3%) \n \nDesegregation Standard – Shall be the lesser of the Sheff Region’s aggregate minority \npercentage enrollment plus thirty percentage points or seventy-five percent (75%).  The \nStandard shall be calculated for each year of the Stipulation based on that year’s aggregate \nminority percentage enrollment figures but in no event shall it exceed seventy-five percent. \n \nC.  The State is required to provide sufficient resources to plan, develop, open and operate the \nschools and programs (identified above) necessary to achieve each of the performance \nbenchmarks, which are described below: \n \nInterim Performance Benchmarks: \n \nIn accordance with the Stipulation the State is required to attain the following benchmarks for \nthe first two years of the Phase II term: \n \n1)  In Year I (2008-09), 19% of Hartford-resident minority students shall be in a reduced-\nisolation educational setting.  This translates into over 3,600 Hartford-resident-minority \nstudents  attending  a  reduced-isolation  voluntary  interdistrict  program  and  1,500 \nparticipating in meaningful part-time interdistrict cooperative programs.  \n \n2)  In Year 2 (2009-10), 27% of Hartford-resident minority students shall be in a reduced-\nisolation educational setting.  This translates into approximately 5,500 Hartford-resident \nminority students attending a reduced-isolation voluntary interdistrict program and 1,500 \nparticipating in meaningful part-time interdistrict cooperative programs. \n \n\nPerformance Benchmarks Based on Demand: \n \n1)  Beginning in Year 3 (2010-11), the State shall examine the demand for seats in reduced-\nisolation  settings  by  Hartford-resident  minority  students  based  on  the  number  of \nHartford-resident minority applicants for a Voluntary Interdistrict Program for the next \nschool year.   \n \nDemand, for the purposes of this stipulation, shall include only the number of those \nHartford-resident minority students who apply, via an approved application form, to \neither  (a)  Open  Choice,  or  (b)  at  least  three  placement  choices  in  a  Voluntary \nInterdistrict Program that meets the Desegregation Standard at the time of application.  \n \n2)  In November of Year 4 (2011-12), the State shall evaluate the number of Hartford-\nresident minority students on a waitlist for a Voluntary Interdistrict Program to determine \nthe degree to which existing programs and planned new programs meet demand for seats \nin reduced-isolation settings by Hartford-resident minority students. The Comprehensive \nSchool Choice Waitlist shall reflect the aggregate number of Hartford-resident minority \nstudents who submit applications for placement in Voluntary Interdistrict Programs that \nmeet the Desegregation Standard at the time of application but are not offered a seat in \nany such program for that school year. To be included on the Comprehensive School \nChoice Waitlist the student (1) must not be offered a seat in any such program for that \nschool year, and (2) meet all of the program admission requirements, and (3) have \nindicated their intent as part of the application process, as defined in the CMP, to be \nplaced on a waitlist if not accepted. \n   \nIf less than 65% of the demand for seats in reduced-isolation settings by Hartford-\nresident minority students is met then the State, in consultation with the Regional School \nChoice Office, shall amend the Comprehensive Management Plan, as described in Part \nIII.B, to plan additional capacity for seats in reduced-isolation settings. “Met demand” \nshall be defined as one hundred minus the percentage of Hartford-resident minority \nstudents on the waitlist for a Voluntary Interdistrict Program as calculated by dividing \nthe number of Hartford-resident minority students on the waitlist as of November 15th, by \nthe total number of Hartford-resident minority applicants for a Voluntary Interdistrict \nProgram  for  that  school  year  who  apply  to  either  Open  Choice  or  at  least  three \nVoluntary Interdistrict Programs that meet the Desegregation Standard.  \n \n3)  If  in  November  of  the  final  year  (2012-2013)  of  Phase  II,  the  State  is  unable  to \ndemonstrate its attainment, through reasonable efforts, of the goal of meeting 80% of \ndemand, the parties shall convene to revisit the Comprehensive Management Plan and to \ndetermine what steps are necessary to meet the demand standard by the following year.  \n \n\nPlease find below a projected summary of where Hartford-minority students may be educated \nin order to meet the terms of the Stipulation.  Summary Table 1 includes projected numbers \nwhich will be modified in accordance with data collections during the applicable year. \n \nTable 1 \n \nNumber of Hartford-Resident Minority Students in Reduced-\nisolation Settings (Based on 10/1/08 Estimated) \n \nProgram  2008-09  2009-10  2010-11  2011-12  2012-13 \nMagnet Schools  2,291  3,493   4,907  5,583  5,833 \nOpen Choice  1,123  1,500  1,800  2,200  2,500 \nCharter Schools  58  90  125  125  125 \nCareer & Technical Prog.  74  210  285  350  795 \nTotal Participation  3,546  5,293  7,117  8,258  9,253 \n% Participation  16.1%  24%  32.3%  37.4%  41.9% \nInterdistrict %  3%  3%  3%  3%  3% \nTotal % Participation  19.1%  27%.  35.3%  40.4%  44.9% \n \n \nGuiding Questions Relevant to Meeting the Goals of the Phase II Stipulation* \n \n•  To what degree is the State on track to meet the desegregation goals outlined in the \nstipulation agreement? \n•  At what rate do special education students and English language learners participate in \nchoice options?

Organizational Responsibility for Sheff \n(Please see Appendix A for Organization Chart) \n \nState Department of Education - Sheff Office: \nTo  ensure  the  State  meets  its  obligations  under  the  Phase  II  Stipulated  Agreement,  the \nCommissioner of the State Department of Education created the Sheff Office which is dedicated \nto the administration, implementation, and oversight of the State’s efforts.  The Office has a staff \nof five and operates under the direction and supervision of the Deputy Commissioner.  Staff is \nresponsible for the: \n \n•  Creation, development and implementation of the Comprehensive Management Plan.   \n•  State’s outreach, communication, and education of area stakeholders and policy makers \naround the role of Sheff in the Hartford Region. \n•  Planning  and  development  of  programs  to  meet  the  demand  of  Hartford-minority \nstudents for educational opportunities in a reduced-isolation setting.   \n•  Support, evaluation, monitoring and reporting on the progress of all programs in the \nGreater Hartford Region devoted to reducing the racial, ethnic and economic isolation of \nHartford-resident minority students.   \n•  Continuously review data to inform efforts to generate and accommodate demand for \nreduced isolation educational settings in the Hartford Region. \n•  Administration of contracts for activities to be carried out by the Regional School Choice \nOffice. \n•  Review and approval of Enrollment Management Plans for all Sheff magnet schools, in \nparticular those not in compliance with the desegregation standard. \n•  Development of legislative and policy initiatives to support the implementation of the \nStipulation. \n \nRegional School Choice Office (RSCO): \nThe State has established and funds a Regional School Choice Office (RSCO).  Located at 43 \nVernon  Street,  in  Hartford’s  educational  complex  known  as  the  Learning  Corridor,  RSCO \nfacilitates collaborative efforts between the State, the Hartford Public Schools and the Capitol \nRegion Education Council (CREC) to promulgate and support Sheff II goals.  The State is in the \nprocess of contracting with a person who will function as the Executive Director of RSCO and \ncoordinate on the State’s behalf the day-to-day activities of the office.  Please note that a \nrepresentative of the plaintiffs is participating in the process currently underway to find the \nDirector.  The Executive Director will report directly to the Deputy Commissioner at the State \nDepartment of Education. \n \nTo support the operation of the office, the State has contracted for a five-year period, beginning \nMay 30, 2008, directly with CREC and the Hartford Public Schools to provide the following \nservices through the RSCO office: \n•  Development  and  implementation  of  exemplary  school  models  to  serve  as  training \ncenters for teachers and administrators in the Greater Hartford Region; \n•  Development  of  a    comprehensive  marketing  and  recruiting  strategy  for  all  Sheff \nprogramming; \n•  Transportation of Hartford and suburban students who participate in Sheff programs;  \n•  Developing and implementing a common application process for Sheff programming in \nthe Greater Hartford region; \n\n•  Developing and implementing a lottery process for Sheff programming in the Greater \nHartford region; \n•  Collection and maintenance of statistics and data regarding demand, enrollment, retention \nand wait list data for reporting purposes. \nThe contracts total $12.5 million over the five-year period.  (Please see Appendix B for copies of \ncontracts.)  The Sheff Plaintiffs have selected a representative to serve as a participant in the \nplanning responsibilities of the RSCO and a member of the State Department of Education - \nSheff Office is also assigned on a part-time basis to the RSCO.   \n \nRegional School Choice Office – School Choice Information Service Center: \n \nThe State has also contracted with both parties for the operation, within the RSCO office, of a \nSchool Choice Information Service Center.  The Center will be the main vehicle through which \nthe State increases regional awareness of quality school choice options and provides parents easy \naccess to information about the application and enrollment processes.  The Center is a critical \ncomponent  of  the  State’s  efforts  to  engage  and  educate  prospective  student  and  family \nparticipants, particularly underserved populations like English language learners and special \neducation or special needs students.  Importantly, the Center will utilize bilingual staff, employ \nflexible scheduling for staff, and partner with community-based agencies and organizations to \nensure that the needs of families are met.  The Center will be a one-stop location where families \ncan either call or visit to obtain: \n \n•  information available in multiple languages regarding the broad spectrum of PreK-12 \nvoluntary  interdistrict  programming  options,  including  those  opportunities  for \ncontinuous pathways; \n•  information on transportation available to the various interdistrict programming options; \n•  assistance with the completion and filing of applications; and \n•  individual  consultation  with  Parent  Intake  Specialists  about  specific  voluntary \ninterdistrict programming options. \n \nThe charge to the Center is to communicate effectively and continuously with families in the \nHartford Region to support their efforts to make informed choices for quality, reduced-isolation \ninterdistrict programming for their children.  Particular attention has been placed on outreach to \nHartford’s  significant  Latino  population  using  Spanish  media  (television,  print,  radio)  and \nmaking certain that communications are available in Spanish and English. \n \nAs  a  direct  result  of  working  with  organizations  in  Hartford  like  the  Refugee  Assistance \nCenterand the Center for Children’s Advocacy, Hartford has identified nine distinct minority \ngroups  (Burundian,  Bosnians,  Ghanaian,  Hispanic,  Iraqi,  Karen,  Liberian,  Portuguese,  and \nSomali-Bantu) within its borders.  In an effort to provide members of these communities with \nmeaningful access to all the voluntary interdistrict program options, Hartford has utilized the \nresources provided by the State though its RSCO contract to develop a multi-faceted plan for \noutreach to these constituents.  Application materials are available in multiple languages (e.g., \nSpanish, Karen, Portuguese, Somali and Bantu).   Additionally, partnerships with agencies and \ncommunity-based  organizations  in    Hartford  such  as  Grandparents  Raising  Grandchildren, \nCatholic Charities, Hartford Public Schools Welcome Center, Brazilian Alliance, Community \nRenewal  Team,  Hispanic  Health  Council,  Department  of  Children  and  Families,  Sheff \nMovement, and the Mayor’s Office For Young Children, have allowed the Center and RSCO to \nreach families, and agencies and organizations that serve Hartford families.   \n\nIII. Program Development – Meeting Demand \n \nTo meet the 19% and 27% goals outlined for the first two years of the Phase II stipulation, the \nState has focused on the quality and desegregation status of existing interdistrict magnet school \nprograms  and  expansion  of  quality  Open  Choice  placements.    Connecticut  Technical  High \nSchools in the Sheff Region, regional vocational agricultural programs, charter school programs, \nand additional magnet programming are also options the State will utilize as appropriate to \nensure that 80% of Hartford-resident minority student demand is met.   \n \nA. Making Existing Magnet Schools Sheff Compliant \n \nOn October 1, 2007 two of the twelve Hartford Host Interdistrict Magnet schools—Breakthrough \nMagnet and Hartford Magnet Middle School—were Sheff compliant.  Of the seven CREC \nmagnet schools that accepted Hartford applicants four schools—Greater Hartford Academy of \nthe  Arts,  Two  Rivers  Magnet  Middle  School,  Great  Path  Academy  and  Greater  Hartford \nAcademy of Mathematics and Science—were Sheff compliant.  As a result, in 2007 Enrollment \nManagement  Plans  (EMPs)  were  required  of  non-compliant  Hartford  and  CREC  Sheff \ninterdistrict magnet schools.  Each EMP contained a comprehensive action plan for bringing \nnon-compliant schools into compliance by a specified date.  The EMPs included information and \ndata concerning: marketing and recruitment efforts; demographic information for students who \napplied and accepted placement; enrollment and retention numbers; strategies to engage parents; \nand an action plan for professional development.  Both Hartford and CREC submitted their plans \nto the department for all schools not meeting the Sheff Desegregation Standard.  A list of \nexisting magnet schools and the anticipated numbers of Hartford-resident minority students in \nreduced-isolation settings can be found below.  Please note - data will be modified in accordance \nwith the annual October 1 collection during the applicable year.  \n \nTable 2 \n \nNumber of Hartford-Resident Minority Students in Reduced-isolation \nSettings (Based on 10/1/08 Estimated) \n \nMagnet School  2008-09  2009-10  2010-11  2011-12  2012-13 \nHartford:           \nHartford Middle Magnet  304  320  320  320  320 \nPathways to Technology  0  0  240  240  240 \nSport and Medical \nSciences Academy  289  325  325  325  325 \nUniversity High School \nof Science and \nEngineering  0  200  200  240  240 \nKinsella Performing Arts \nMagnet  0  0  462  462  462 \nBreakthrough Magnet  169  170  170  170  170 \nClassical Magnet  355  355  355  355  355 \nCapital Preparatory \nMagnet  0  150  200  207  207 \nNoah Webster \nMicroSociety Magnet  0  300  300  300  300 \nSub-total Hartford:  1,117  1,820  2,572  2,619  2,619 \nCREC           \nTwo Rivers Magnet \nMiddle School  151  151  151  151  151 \n\n \nNumber of Hartford-Resident Minority Students in Reduced-isolation \nSettings (Based on 10/1/08 Estimated) \n \nMagnet School  2008-09  2009-10  2010-11  2011-12  2012-13 \nGreater Hartford \nAcademy of Math and \nScience (total full and \npart-time students)  74  150  192  192  192 \nGreater Hartford \nAcademy of  the Arts \n(total full and part-time \nstudents)  94  115  156  160  160 \nMetropolitan Learning \nCenter  216  216  220  220  220 \nMontessori Magnet  155  163  163  163  163 \nGreat Path Academy  56  100  150  150  150 \nEast Hartford – \nGlastonbury Magnet  0  0  0  100  150 \nUniversity of Hartford \n(Multiple Intelligences) \nMagnet  192  205  205  205  205 \nSub-total CREC:  938  1,100  1,237  1,341  1,391 \nEast Hartford:           \nInternational \nBaccalaureate (High \nSchool)  23  23  23  23  23 \nTOTAL MAGNETS  2,078  2,943  3,832  3,983  4,033 \nNote:  Zero (0) in the above chart is entered where an interdistrict magnet school did not or is not expected to \nmeet the Sheff Desegregation Standard for that school year and therefore Hartford-resident minority \nstudents enrolled in the school could not be included in the Sheff compliant enrollment count. \n \nAfter consultation with both Hartford and CREC, the State developed an EMP template for \nmagnet program operators to use to identify the strategies and actions that can produce compliant \nSheff programming.  The intention is not to record failures, but rather to cultivate and sustain \nsuccessful learning communities.  The EMP process is intended to promote ongoing external \n(State) and internal (program) review so that successes can be highlighted and shared, and \nobstacles to success can be identified with meaningful opportunity for remediation using existing \nresources, or through targeted planning for additional resources.   \n \nBeginning with the 2008-09 school year non-compliant program operators submitting an EMP \nwill use the prototype included here as Appendix C.  Additionally, the State has determined that \neach Sheff magnet program operator submitting an EMP for a non-compliant program must \nconduct  periodic  assessments  of  program  quality,  participant  satisfaction,  and  enrollment \ndemographics.  Presently, three times per year enrollment data is reported to the State by schools  \n(in October, January and June.)  Therefore, three times per year program operators of non-\ncompliant schools will be required to do more than simply collect and report the numbers.  Non-\ncompliant  schools  will  be  expected  to  examine their  data  relative  to:  student  achievement, \nparticipant satisfaction,  and  student  enrollment  and  retention.    Analysis  of  the  data  by  the \ncollecting school, including the methods and dates of collection, and the resulting action plan \nmust be reported in the EMP.  Data analysis will be used to inform programming changes and \ncreate  an  action  plan  that  establishes  timelines,  measurable  objectives  and  goals  for \nimplementing  modifications  designed  to  provide  higher  quality  programming,  targeted \nrecruitment and retention efforts, and compliance with the Desegregation Standard.  EMPs will \n\nreceive an annual review by the State Department of Education each fall to determine their \neffectiveness as measured by the likelihood that the school’s student enrollment will meet the \nDesegregation Standard.  Where necessary, program themes and structures will be modified or \nredesigned to promote Sheff goals and reflect best educational practices.  Where EMPs do not \nresult in improved educational programming and Sheff compliance within the stated timeframe, \ndespite efforts by the State and school operators to get the program on track towards meeting the  \nDesegregation Standard, the State may determine that the program is not a viable interdistrict \nmagnet opportunity and de-magnetize the program or take it off line as an interdistrict magnet to \nfacilitate the redesign process.  In either case, the cessation of operation as an interdistrict \nmagnet school will result in the loss of interdistrict magnet funding for that school.   \n \nBecause the State is committed to building and supporting a system of interdistrict magnet \nschools in the Hartford Region that enrich the lives of the students that attend them and the \ncommunities where they are located, beginning in school year 2009-10 all Sheff magnet program \noperators will be required to submit an EMP.   Since both compliant and non-compliant program \noperators will prepare and file an EMP, this will provide another opportunity for the State to use \nand  share  specific  information  and  strategies  from  successful  educational  models  to  assist \nprograms with overcoming challenges.  Working in concert with the program operators, the State \nwill continue to provide the human capital, legislative efforts and available resources to ensure \nhigh quality, integrated programming with opportunities for continuous educational pathways for \nall children in the Hartford Region.  Making the existing programs Sheff compliant would \nprovide  opportunities  for  approximately  3,800  (17%)  of  Hartford-resident  minority \nstudents to attend school in quality reduced-isolation settings without creating any new \nschools.  \n \nExisting Magnet Programs Action Plan \n \nGoal:  Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of recruitment and enrollment strategies to attract \nand retain students, and identify and provide for academic and social supports necessary to \nestablish  and  maintain  Sheff  compliant  enrollment  in  quality  reduced-isolation  educational \nsettings. \n \nSheff  II  Stipulation  References:    III.B.2.f;  C.2.d,  f-g;  D.2.a-c.

If so, why? \n•  Do all students, including special education students and English Language Learners, \nhave equal opportunities for success in the existing interdistrict magnet schools? \n \n \n \nB. Open Choice – Program Expansion and Support: \n \nThe Open Choice program allows Hartford-resident minority students to attend public schools in \nnearby suburban communities.  Those same suburban communities may also send children to \nHartford if parents choose to participate in a Hartford program.  It is expected that Hartford-\nresident minority school children in the Open Choice program in the Sheff Region will have the \nability to attend schools in suburban districts without a break in their educational experience in \nthat district if they so choose.  Open Choice is intended to reduce racial, ethnic, and economic \nisolation,  improve  student  achievement  and  provide  parents  with  a  choice  for  educational \nprogramming.    This  program  is  a  significant  focus  of  the  Sheff  II  effort  and  offers  the \nopportunity to advance reduced-isolation goals in quality educational settings using existing \nprogramming in most cases.  As we look at Sheff Region district enrollments the State will \nconsider the changing demographics of some communities and examine the grade levels where \nsuburban districts report seats for Hartford-resident minority school children.   The focus of the \nCommissioner and the Sheff Office is to raise awareness of Open Choice, increase the scope and \nlevel of academic and social supports for participating students, their families, and receiving \nsuburban  districts,  and  thereby  encourage  Hartford  families  and  suburban  communities  to \nsignificantly increase participation in the program.  The critical focus of the strategies proposed \n\nin this Comprehensive Management Plan is the best interests of Hartford-resident minority \nschool children and their families. \n \nIn  the  Hartford  Region  the  program  is  operated  by  the  Capitol  Region  Education  Council \n(CREC).  For the 2007-08 school year, 1,092 children participated in the program, with one child \ncoming into Hartford and 1,091 children leaving Hartford.  Of those 1,091 children 1,080 were \nchildren of color.  These children went to 27 different suburban communities, 18 of which were \nin the Sheff Region.   \n \nThe Commissioner’s long-term goal is to increase each suburban district’s participation to \nat least 3% of its student population.  This would enable approximately 3,000 additional \nHartford-resident minority students to be enrolled in quality reduced-isolation settings.   In \ncombination with making the existing magnet programs compliant as described above, this \nwould mean approximately 6,800 (30%) of Hartford’s students of color would be able to \nattend school in reduced-isolation settings.  It is important to note that this outcome is \nwithout a single new school being created.   In fact this result could be bolstered by applying \nthe existing Open Choice construction bonus to appropriate existing, pending and planned school \nconstruction projects in the Sheff Region. \n \nPast program history, along with recent outreach to Sheff Region superintendents has indicated \nthat the State can achieve this goal by offering greater levels of academic and financial support \n(Please see Academic and Social Supports & Financial Sections).  Another critical component \nwill be the significant expansion of opportunities for pre-school and kindergarten children to \nenroll  in  full-day  programs  in  quality  suburban  programs.      Where  appropriate,  the \nCommissioner,  the  Sheff  Office  and  RSCO  will  seek  opportunities  to  help  suburban \ncommunities expand their pre-school and kindergarten spaces so they can offer high quality, full-\nday programming to their own children while increasing their commitment to Open Choice \nstudents.  In keeping with the State’s commitment to provide all children with quality early \nchildhood settings the Sheff office will collaborate with the Early Childhood Education Cabinet \nand School Readiness offices to determine where space can be expanded in public school \nsettings and funding coordinated to allow a greater number of Hartford and suburban children a \nquality, integrated preschool experience without a break in their education program. \n \nOpen Choice Action Plan \n \nGoal:  Increase recruitment, enrollment, achievement and retention of Open Choice students in \nquality reduced-isolation educational settings that provide pathways for continuous education. \n \nSheff II Stipulation References:  III.B.2.e-j, m, r-t (Implementation) \n \n\nObjective  #1:    Collect,  analyze,  and  report  data  and  information  relevant  to  Project \nConcern/Open Choice participation to inform program expansion. \n \n1.

Career and Technical Programs- Expansion and Support \n \nIn its efforts to meet the goals of the Stipulation, the State will utilize its Connecticut \nTechnical  High  School  System  (CTHSS)  and  Regional  Agricultural  Science  and \nTechnology programs in the Sheff Region to expand opportunities for Hartford students.   \n \nFor the first time in 2008-09 school year, the Connecticut Technical High School System \nused  a  collaborative  recruiting  model  between  Cheney  Technical  High  School  in \nManchester and A.I. Prince Technical High School in Hartford.  Previously A.I Prince \nsolely recruited students from Hartford Public Schools.  The new recruitment model \nresulted in an unprecedented number of Hartford minority students entering the freshman \nclass  for  2008-09  at  Cheney  Technical  High  School.    With  intensive  outreach  and \n\nrecruiting being implemented in the fall 2008, the State’s goal in 2009-10 is for every \nincoming freshman class at A.I. Prince to be Sheff compliant with the enrollment of at \nleast 46 white children each year.  To further attract area students to the technical high \nschools, new trade programs at A.I. Prince and Cheney in Communications and Music \nand Theater Production programs will open for fall 2009. The recruitment model will be \nexpanded in the 2009-10 school year with two additional CT Technical High Schools \nparticipating in the Sheff effort:  Vinal Technical High School in Middletown and E.C. \nGoodwin Technical High School in New Britain. \n \nTo provide incoming ninth grade students with academic and social support, during \nsummer 2008 the CT Technical High School System implemented a trade exploratory \nprogram for students in the Greater Hartford Region. The CT Technical High Schools \nplans to expand the summer academic and leadership programs for the 2009 year to \npromote retention and increase academic and social success.  In the summer of 2009, the \nexpansion will include 7th and 8th grade students in the Greater Hartford Region to \nincrease student and parent awareness as to the educational opportunities provided by the \nCT Technical High School System.  \n \nThe Sheff Office has also approached the Regional Agricultural Science and Technology \nprograms in the region about having greater participation in Sheff.  This led to the \nSuffield Board of Education approving a resolution to open up seats for Hartford children \nbeginning in the 2008-09 school year.   In the 2009 school year Glastonbury Regional \nAgricultural Science and Technology program will be approached to further expand the \nopportunities for Hartford students. \n \nCareer and Technical Programs Action Plan \n \nGoal:  Increase recruitment, enrollment, achievement and retention of Hartford-resident \nminority students in quality reduced-isolation educational settings. \n \nSheff II Stipulation References:  III.B.2.e-j, m, r-t (Implementation) \n \nObjective  #1:    Expand  opportunities  for  Hartford  students  to  attend  a  Connecticut \nTechnical High School in a quality reduced-isolation educational setting. \n \nStrategy  1.

New Sheff Magnet & Charter Schools: \n \nThe final prong of the State’s efforts to meet the goals of the Stipulation will involve the \nthoughtful  and  strategic  development  of  new  Sheff  interdistrict  magnet  or  charter  school \nprograms.  As we move to the uncertainty of what level of demand will arise from the “demand \nmodel” the state must carefully plan how much additional capacity needs to be built into the \nsystem.    This  is  particularly  important  as  suburban  enrollments  decline  and  schools  are \ndownsized or closed.  In those instances it would be more economical for both the districts and \nthe State if those districts absorbed additional Open Choice capacity instead of building new.  In \noverseeing the planning and development of new Sheff magnet or charter school programming, \nthe State intends to focus on high quality programming that has great interest with Hartford and \nsuburban constituencies, and therefore offers the greatest possibility to open and remain Sheff \ncompliant.  For example, educational programming connected to higher education is attractive to \nparents of elementary and secondary students.  Similarly Sheff programming sited in or on the \nborder of suburban communities contiguous to Hartford is appealing to eligible students and \nfamilies because the ride times for many students can be positively impacted, and partnership \nwith one or two strategic suburban districts promotes Sheff compliance.   \n \nThe State does recognize that to meet the interim goals of the Stipulation and the back-up \nposition of 41% if we are unable to meet the requirements of the demand model, additional \nchoice programming will be required.  Therefore, as outlined in the table below, in addition to \nthe reconstituted Montessori at Annie Fisher program, three new interdistrict magnet programs \nand one State Charter School were opened this year and several more are planned. Please note - \ndata will be modified in accordance with the annual October 1 collection during the applicable \nyear. \n \nTable 6 \n \nNumber of Hartford-Resident Minority Students in Reduced-\nIsolation Settings (Based on 10/1/08 Estimated) \nNew Choice   \nPrograms  2008-09  2009-10  2010-2011  2011-2012  2012-2013 \nMary Hooker Env. \nStudies – Hartford*  0  0  100  300  300 \nAnnie Fisher – STEM \n– Hartford*  0  0  100  200  250 \nGoodwin College - \nCREC  0  75  125  150  200 \n\n \nNumber of Hartford-Resident Minority Students in Reduced-\nIsolation Settings (Based on 10/1/08 Estimated) \nNew Choice   \nPrograms  2008-09  2009-10  2010-2011  2011-2012  2012-2013 \nAllied Health - CREC  0  75  125  150  200 \nCharter School for \nYoung Children at \nAsylum Hill  58  90  125  125  125 \nMontessori at Annie \nFisher – Hartford*  45  70  125  150  150 \nEarly Childhood- The \nReggio Emilia Magnet \nSchool of the Arts - \nCREC  54  105  150  175  200 \nEarly Childhood – The \nInternational \nBaccalaureate - CREC  60  100  150  175  200 \nPublic Safety \nAcademy - CREC  59  125  200  300  300 \nTotal   276  640  1,200  1,725  1,925 \n \n*Currently the redesign and modification of two Hartford Host programs is underway.  Annie Fisher \nMultiple Intelligences Magnet closed as a Multiple Intelligences program at the end of school year 2007-\n08 and is being reconstituted as two separate interdistrict host magnet schools, one Montessori and the \nother Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM).  On August 25, 2008 the Montessori Magnet \nSchool at Annie Fisher opened as an interdistrict magnet school with 102 students, 52 which were \nHartford-minority students.  STEM at Annie Fisher is scheduled to open as a Sheff compliant interdistrict \nmagnet school in the fall of 2010.  The Mary Hooker Environmental Studies Magnet School, which had a \nminority enrollment of 93% in 2007-08, has ceased operation as an interdistrict magnet program while \nthe curriculum is revamped and a new school building is constructed.  It is anticipated that the school \nwill re-open for school year 2010-2011 as a Sheff compliant program. \n   \nNew Sheff Magnet & Charter School Action Plan \n \nGoal:  Create a process for meeting the need for additional Hartford-resident minority students \nto be placed reduced-isolation choice programming in order to meet the requirements of the \nStipulated Agreement. \n \nSheff II Stipulation References:  III.B.2.k - l (Implementation) \n \n\nObjective #1:  Determine annually the State’s compliance with the Stipulated Agreement in \nregards to the number of Hartford-resident minority students required to be placed in reduced-\nisolation educational settings. \n \n1.

Academic and Social Supports \n \nMeeting the goals of the Phase II Stipulation order is dependent upon educating Hartford-\nresident minority students and white students residing in Sheff Region suburban districts in \nreduced-isolation educational settings.  The need to attract and retain students in such settings \nrequires us to recognize and attend to the academic and social supports students, families, and \nschools may require in order to ensure that their experiences are of high quality.  To that end, the \nCMP describes below a plan for the development of a comprehensive system of supports.   \n \nEmbedded in this system of supports will be opportunities to provide more immediate short term \nsolutions as well as programs and services to meet long term goals.  For example: \n \n•  In response to concerns about outcomes for Open Choice students in their districts, \nAvon,  Farmington,  Granby  and  Simsbury  requested  and  received  funding  for  a \nChoice  Intervention  Specialist  to  provide  services  to  students  with  intent  of \nimproving attendance, academic performance, discipline, and parent involvement.  \nFor the last three months of the 2007-08 and the entire 2008-09 school year, CSDE \nwill fund 0.5 FTE of this position, with the districts funding the other 0.5 FTE.  \n \n•  In order to facilitate a smooth transition for Hartford students attending Cheney \nTechnical High School, CSDE funded a summer program for students accepted into \nthe school as freshmen for the 2008-09 school year.  The purpose of the program was \n\nto promote the retention of Hartford students accepted into the program through the \nprovision of academic supports, leadership, and career exploration opportunities.  \n  \nThe outcomes of these programs are to be determined.  However, the willingness of the State to \nengage in a process with stakeholders whereby needs are identified and met in a collaborative \nmanner has been established.   This process, hand-in-hand with a deliberate examination of \navailable data on student, family, and staff experiences with Sheff choice programs, will provide \nthe foundation for our system of academic and social supports. \n \nGoal:  Establish a process to identify, fund, and implement appropriate and adequate academic \nand social support services for student and school participants in school choice opportunities to \nensure quality integrated education. \n \nSheff II Stipulation References:  IIIB1, IIIB2c-d, IIIB2f-h, IIIB2m, IIIB2o-p \n \nObjective #1:  Collect and analyze data and information related to academic and social supports \nprovided to school choice participants to ensure that strategies with a history of successful \noutcomes can inform continued efforts.   \n \n1.

Measuring Progress – The Demand Model \n \nGoal: Develop and implement a process for determining demand for each of the voluntary \ninterdistrict programs.  \n \nSheff II Stipulation References:  IIIB2a, IIIB2q \n \nAlready underway and to be completed by June 30, 2009, the State in cooperation with RSCO is \ndeveloping a procedure to be utilized, beginning in school year 2010-11, to determine the \ndemand for each of the voluntary interdistrict programs defined in Section 2 of the Stipulated \nAgreement.  The procedure will include: \n \n1.  Calculating  the  number  of  Hartford  minority  applicants  to  voluntary  integrated \ninterdistrict programs that meets the desegregation standard at the time of application. \n \n2.  Developing a comprehensive annual waitlist system that will be universally applied \nfor  recording  Hartford-resident  minority  student  applicants  who  voluntarily  apply  to \ninterdistrict programs that meet the desegregation standard but are not offered placement \nin any such program during the application year.  \n \n3.  Designing and implementing a procedure that identifies families that intend to remain on \nthe waitlist after receiving notice that the applicant has not been placed for the coming \nschool year in a reduced-isolation voluntary interdistrict program. \n \n4.  Developing of a process for calculating met demand based upon the above collected data. \n \nBased on an analysis of the demand data received during the 2010-11 school year the \nState will develop a process for evaluating capacity as compared to demand, and devise a \nsystem for responding to the results yielded by the 2010-11 data collection. \n \nAs a basis for informing the establishment of the demand procedure the State is taking \nthe following measures during the 2008-09 school year. \n \n1.  An online and paper version of a common application, which incorporates all voluntary \ninterdistrict  programs,  for  use  for  the  2009-10  school-year  has  been  developed  in \nconjunction with the Regional School Choice Office.  The application and brochure are in \nEnglish and Spanish along with five other languages.  Hartford and suburban parents are \ncurrently applying to the interdistrict programs using this form. \n  \n2.  The State has contracted with its RSCO partners to develop a unified lottery system \nacross all of the magnet programs with timelines that consider and align with the Open \nChoice, CT Technical High Schools, and Regional Agricultural Science and Technology \nprograms lottery and placement processes.  Discussions are underway to have a system in \nplace for March 2009 to operate the lottery for the 2009-10 school-year.  The State is \ncommitted to ensuring a process that attracts and includes a pool reflective of Hartford’s \nentire  minority  student  population,  including  but  not  limited  to  special  education, \nbilingual and ELL students.  This means all preferences included in the current system \nwill be reconsidered to determine if they might discourage parents from applying.   \n \n\n3.  Develop a means of identifying those families that intend to remain on the waitlist after \nreceiving notice that the applicant has not been placed so as to familiarize them with the \nwaitlist process that will be used in year 4 of the stipulated agreement. \n \n\nConclusion \n \nThe CMP describes a cooperative process that will guide the State, along with its partners, as we \n“increase the number of Hartford-resident minority students in reduced-isolation educational \nsettings and …move toward meeting demand of Hartford-resident minority students seeking \nplacement in such settings.”  To accomplish this goal, the State has outlined five types of \nreduced-isolation  educational  settings  in  which  Hartford-resident  minority  students  may \nparticipate: \n \n1.  Magnet Schools:  increase the number of magnet schools and ensure the desegregation \nstatus of new and existing magnet schools \n2.  Open Choice:  expand opportunities in Sheff Region suburban school districts \n3.  Charter Schools:  establish one or more charter schools in the Sheff Region  \n4.  Connecticut Technical High School System:  expand opportunities in suburban CTHS \nprograms and ensure desegregation status of CTHS program in Hartford \n5.  Agricultural Science and Technology Programs:  expand opportunities in Sheff Region \nsuburban programs \n \nIn addition, programs, services and support systems will be implemented to ensure the successful \nparticipation of Hartford-resident minority students in such programs: \n \n1.  Building Demand and Capacity:  programs will be marketed to increase interest in choice \nprograms in both Hartford and suburban families through public awareness and attention \nto quality of programming \n2.  Academic and Social Supports:  needs of students and families will be addressed in order \nto promote student achievement and satisfaction of students, families, and school staff \n3.  Transportation:  barriers to participation will be reduced through the development and \nimplementation of a cost-effective and convenient transportation plan \n4.  Legislation, Policy and Funding:  legislative proposals will be developed to request \npolicy and/or funding to support promising and successful strategies \n5.  Data Collection and Evaluation:  action will be informed by results through purposeful \ncollection, analysis and dissemination of data \n \nThe CMP is a living document, to be enhanced and adjusted based on what the Department \nlearns through implementation.  Revisions will be informed by data and feedback from school \ndistricts,  educational  program  providers,  community  members  and,  most  importantly, \nparticipants.  Developed in collaboration with stakeholders, this plan attends not only to the \nquantifiable targets described in the Phase II Stipulation and Order, but to our shared goal for \nparticipating  students  to  experience  success  in  the  educational  settings  that  they  and  their \nfamilies choose.   \n ",

J. \nThe public elementary and high school students in Hartford suffer daily from the devastating effects \nthat racial and ethnic isolation, as well as poverty, have had on their education. Federal \nconstitutional law provides no remedy for their plight. The principal issue in this appeal is whether, \nunder the unique provisions of our state constitution, the state, which already plays an active role in \nmanaging public schools, must take further measures to relieve the severe handicaps that burden \nthese children's education. The issue is as controversial as the stakes are high. We hold today that \n\nthe needy schoolchildren of Hartford have waited long enough. The constitutional imperatives \ncontained in article eighth, § 1,[1] and article first, §§ 1 and 20,[2] of our 4*4 state constitution entitle \nthe plaintiffs to relief. At the same time, the constitutional imperative of separation of powers \npersuades us to afford the legislature, with the assistance of the executive branch, the opportunity, \nin the first instance, to fashion the remedy that will most appropriately respond to the constitutional \nviolations that we have identified. The judgment of the trial court must, accordingly, be reversed. \nI \nTHE HISTORY AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THIS \nLITIGATION \nIn their action seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, the eighteen plaintiffs[3] filed a \nfour count complaint in which they claimed that the defendants[4] had a constitutional obligation, \nunder article 5*5 eighth, § 1, and article first, §§ 1 and 20, to remedy alleged educational inequities in \nthe Hartford public schools. The trial court denied the defendants' motions to strike the complaint \nand for summary judgment. After an evidentiary hearing, the court concluded, however, that the \nplaintiffs had failed to prove that \"state action exists under the facts and circumstances of this case,\" \nand rendered judgment in favor of the defendants. \nA \nThe plaintiffs' revised four count complaint alleges that students in the Hartford public schools are \nburdened by severe educational disadvantages arising out of their racial and ethnic isolation and \ntheir socioeconomic deprivation. Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, each count of their \ncomplaint is grounded on the proposition that the defendants have failed to fulfill their state \nconstitutional responsibility to remedy these severe educational disadvantages. Count one alleges \nthat the defendants bear responsibility for the de facto racial and ethnic segregation between \nHartford and the surrounding suburban public school districts and thus have deprived the plaintiffs of \nan equal opportunity to a free public education as required by article first, §§ 1 and 20, and article \neighth, § 1. Count two alleges that the defendants have perpetuated the racial and ethnic \nsegregation that exists between Hartford and the surrounding suburban public school districts, and \nthus have discriminated against the plaintiffs and have failed to provide them with an equal \nopportunity to a free public education as required by article first, §§ 1 and 6*6 20, and article eighth, \n§ 1. Count three alleges that the defendants have failed to provide the plaintiffs with an equal \nopportunity to a free public education as required by article first, §§ 1 and 20, and article eighth, § 1, \nbecause the defendants have maintained in Hartford a public school district that, by comparison with \nsurrounding suburban public school districts: (1) is severely educationally disadvantaged; (2) fails to \nprovide equal educational opportunities for Hartford schoolchildren; and (3) fails to provide a \nminimally adequate education for Hartford schoolchildren. Count four alleges that the defendants \nhave failed to provide the plaintiffs with a substantially equal educational opportunity as required by \nConnecticut law, including General Statutes § 10-4a,[5] in violation of the plaintiffs' rights to due \nprocess under article first, §§ 8 and 10.[6] \nThe defendants not only denied the underlying factual and legal premises of the plaintiffs' complaint, \nbut also raised seven special defenses. These defenses alleged that the defendants were not liable \nbecause of: (1) sovereign immunity; (2) stare decisis; (3) separation of powers; (4) the lack of a \njusticiable controversy; (5) 7*7 the plaintiffs' failure to join necessary parties, including the city of \nHartford; (6) the absence of state action; and (7) the unavailability of court-ordered remedies. \n\nThe trial court initially denied the defendants' motions to strike and for summary judgment that were \npremised on these special defenses. After an evidentiary hearing, however, the court ruled in favor \nof the defendants on their sixth special defense. Relying heavily on principles drawn from federal \nconstitutional law, the court determined that the plaintiffs could not prevail without establishing that \nstate action was the \"direct and sufficient cause of the conditions\" alleged in their complaint, and \nconcluded that they had failed to prove such causation. Finding no such state action, the court \nrendered judgment for the defendants without addressing the merits of the constitutional claims \nasserted by the plaintiffs. \nB \nBecause of the importance of the novel and controversial questions of constitutional law raised in \nthis litigation, pursuant to Practice Book § 4023 and General Statutes § 51-199 (c), we transferred to \nthis court the plaintiffs' appeal from the judgment of the trial court. Noting that the plaintiffs' complaint \nhad been pending since 1989, we held a special hearing, shortly after the appeal had been filed, to \norder supplementation of the trial record. We directed the parties to prepare a joint stipulation of all \nrelevant undisputed facts and to assist the trial court in making findings of fact on matters upon \nwhich the parties could not agree.[7] Our resolution of this appeal has proceeded on the basis of this \nsupplemented 8*8 record, which the parties and the court promptly prepared in accordance with our \norder. \nC \nThe stipulation of the parties and the trial court's findings establish the following relevant facts. \nStatewide, in the 1991-92 school year, children from minority groups constituted 25.7 percent of the \npublic school population. In the Hartford public school system in that same period, 92.4 percent of \nthe students were members of minority groups, including, predominantly, students who were either \nAfrican-American or Latino.[8] Fourteen of Hartford's twenty-five elementary schools had a white \nstudent enrollment of less than 2 percent. The Hartford public school system currently enrolls the \nhighest percentage of minority students in the state. In the future, if current conditions continue, the \npercentage of minority students in the Hartford public school system is likely to increase rather than \ndecrease. Since 1980, the percentage of African-Americans in the Hartford student population has \ndecreased, while the percentage of Latinos has increased. Although enrollment of African-American \nstudents in the twenty-one surrounding suburban towns has increased by more than 60 percent from \n1980 to 1992, only seven of these school districts had a minority student enrollment in excess of 10 \npercent in 1992. Because of the negative consequences of racial and ethnic isolation, a more \nintegrated public school system would likely be beneficial to all schoolchildren. \nA majority of the children who constitute the public school population in Hartford come from homes \nthat are economically disadvantaged, that are headed by a single parent and in which a language \nother than English is spoken. The percentage of Hartford schoolchildren 9*9 at the elementary level \nwho return to the same school that they attended the previous year is the lowest such percentage in \nthe state. Such socioeconomic factors impair a child's orientation toward and skill in learning and \nadversely affect a child's performance on standardized tests. The gap in the socioeconomic status \nbetween Hartford schoolchildren and schoolchildren from the surrounding twenty-one suburban \ntowns has been increasing. The performance of Hartford schoolchildren on standardized tests falls \nsignificantly below that of schoolchildren from the twenty-one surrounding suburban towns. \nDirectly or indirectly, the state has always controlled public elementary and secondary education in \nConnecticut. The legislature directs many aspects of local school programs, including courses of \nstudy and curricula, standardized testing, bilingual education, graduation requirements and school \n\nattendance. Since 1941, as a result of a state statute; see General Statutes § 10-240;[9] the public \nschool district boundaries in Hartford have been coterminous with the boundaries of the city of \nHartford. Since at least 1909, as a result of another state statute; see General Statutes § 10-\n184;[10]schoolchildren 10*10 have been assigned to the public school district in which they reside. \nThe legislature provides substantial support to communities throughout the state to finance public \nschool operations. State financial aid is distributed so that the neediest school districts receive the \nmost aid. Accordingly, in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 school years, overall per pupil state expenditures \nin Hartford exceeded the average amount spent per pupil in the twenty-one surrounding suburban \ntowns. The state reimburses Hartford for its school renovation projects at a rate that is considerably \nhigher than the reimbursement rate for the twenty-one surrounding suburban towns. \nThe state has not intentionally segregated racial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school \nsystem. Except for a brief period in 1868, no students in Connecticut have intentionally been \nassigned to a public school or to a public school district on the basis of race or ethnicity.[11] There \nhas never been any other manifestation of de jure segregation either at the state or the local level. In \naddition to various civil rights initiatives undertaken by the legislature from 1905 to 1961 to combat \nracial discrimination, the state board of education was reorganized, during the 1980s, to concentrate \non the needs of urban schoolchildren and to promote diversity in the public schools. Since 1970, the \nstate has supported and encouraged voluntary plans for increasing interdistrict diversity. \nThe state has nonetheless played a significant role in the present concentration of racial and ethnic \nminorities in the Hartford public school system. Although 11*11 intended to improve the quality of \neducation and not racially or ethnically motivated, the districting statute that the legislature enacted \nin 1909, now codified at § 10-240,[12] is the single most important factor contributing to the present \nconcentration of racial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school system. The districting \nstatute and the resultant school district boundaries have remained virtually unchanged since 1909. \nThe districting statute is of critical importance because it establishes town boundaries as the dividing \nline between all school districts in the state. \nNonetheless, according to the findings of the trial court, poverty, and not race or ethnicity, is the \nprincipal causal factor in the lower educational achievement of Hartford students. The court also \nfound that the Hartford public school system provides its students with a minimally adequate \neducation under article first, §§ 1 and 20, and article eighth, § 1, because, regardless of the \ncomparative levels of achievement between Hartford students and students from the twenty-one \nsuburban towns, the education provided to Hartford students gives them a chance to lead successful \nlives. It further found that the Hartford public school system provides its students with an equal \neducational opportunity because they receive resources, educational programs and curricula similar \nto those received by students in other communities in the state. It then found that school district lines \nwould have to be redrawn in order to remedy effectively the severe racial, ethnic and socioeconomic \nisolation that exists in the Hartford public school system. In addition to these findings addressed to \nthe plaintiffs' specific legal claims, the court also found that any form of mandatory intervention would \nhave to rely on coercive measures that would not assure educationally desirable outcomes. \n12*12 D \nThe plaintiffs' appeal challenges the validity of many of the trial court's findings of fact and all of its \nconclusions of law.[13] The defendants ask us to affirm the judgment of the trial court, by reversing its \nconclusion that the plaintiffs' complaint is justiciable or by upholding its conclusion that the complaint \nis barred by an absence of the requisite state action. If we reject these affirmative defenses, the \ndefendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to establish their claims of law in light of the findings \n\nof the trial court. We are unpersuaded by the defendants' affirmative defenses and, on the merits, we \nreverse the judgment of the trial court. \nII \nTHE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES \nThe defendants renew two affirmative defenses that they raised at trial.[14] They argue that the text of \narticle eighth, § 1, deprives the trial court of jurisdiction to consider whether the plaintiffs are entitled \nto relief by way of an order to the legislature to provide a remedy for their impaired educational \nopportunities. They also argue that, even if the trial court had jurisdiction, the plaintiffs cannot \nrecover because they have not alleged that their educational impairment results from intentional \nstate misconduct. We are not persuaded by either of these affirmative defenses. \n13*13 A \nThe defendants maintain that the trial court should have dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint because \nthe plaintiffs' claims are nonjusticiable. Granting the plaintiffs the relief they seek would, according to \nthe defendants, require this court to respond to a political question that our constitution has \nexpressly and exclusively entrusted to the legislature. We disagree. \nExisting precedents describe the uneasy line that distinguishes between cases that are justiciable \nand cases that are not. Because of the doctrine of separation of powers, courts do not have \njurisdiction to decide cases that involve matters that textually have been reserved to the legislature, \nsuch as the implementation of a constitutional spending cap; Nielsen v. State, 236 Conn. 1, 9-10, 670 \nA.2d 1288 (1996); or the appointment of additional judges. Pellegrino v. O'Neill, 193 Conn. 670, 683, 480 \nA.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984); see \nalso Nielsen v. Kezer, 232 Conn. 65, 74, 652 A.2d 1013 (1995). In the absence of such a textual \nreservation, however, it is the role and the duty of the judiciary to determine whether the legislature \nhas fulfilled its affirmative obligations within constitutional principles. Marbury v. Madison,5 U.S. (1 \nCranch) 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803); Pratt v. Allen, 13 Conn. 119, 132 (1839); see Caldor, \nInc. v. Thornton, 191 Conn. 336, 344, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d \n2557 (1985); Horton v. Meskill, 172 Conn. 615, 625, 649-50, 376 A.2d 359 (1977) (Horton \nI); Preveslin v. Derby & Ansonia Developing Co.,112 Conn. 129, 145, 151 A. 518 (1930). \"Deciding whether \na matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, \nor whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a \ndelicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate \ninterpreter 14*14 of the Constitution.\" Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 211, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 \n(1962); see Massameno v. Statewide Grievance Committee, 234 Conn. 539, 552, 663 A.2d 317 \n(1995); Nielsen v. Kezer, supra, 74-75; see also L. Henkin, \"Is There a `Political Question' Doctrine?,\" \n85 Yale L.J. 597, 599-600 (1976); M. Redish, \"Judicial Review and the `Political Question,'\" 79 Nw. \nU.L. Rev. 1031, 1051-60 (1984-85). \nIn the context of judicial enforcement of the right to a substantially equal educational opportunity \narising under article eighth, § 1, and article first, §§ 1 and 20, justiciability is not a matter of first \nimpression for this court. In Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 615, and Horton v. Meskill, 195 Conn. 24, 486 A.2d \n1099 (1985) (Horton III),[15] we reviewed, in plenary fashion,[16] the actions taken by the legislature to \nfulfill its constitutional obligation to public elementary and secondary schoolchildren. Judicial \nauthority to render these decisions was expressly reaffirmed in Nielsen v. State, supra, 236 Conn. 9-\n10, and in Pellegrino v. O'Neill, supra, 193 Conn. 683. \n\nThe defendants do not challenge the continued validity of Horton I and Horton III, but argue that their \nclaim of nonjusticiability differs. That argument is unavailing. The plaintiff schoolchildren in the \npresent case invoke the same constitutional provisions to challenge the constitutionality of state \naction that the plaintiff schoolchildren 15*15 invoked in Horton Iand Horton III. The text of article \neighth, § 1, has not changed. Furthermore, although prudential cautions may shed light on the \nproper definition of constitutional rights and remedies; see Fonfara v. Reapportionment Commission, 222 \nConn. 166, 184-85, 610 A.2d 153 (1992); such cautions do not deprive a court of jurisdiction. \nIn light of these precedents, we are persuaded that the phrase \"appropriate legislation\" in article \neighth, § 1, does not deprive the courts of the authority to determine what is \"appropriate.\"[17] Just as \nthe legislature has a constitutional duty to fulfill its affirmative obligation to the children who attend \nthe state's public elementary and secondary schools, so the judiciary has a constitutional duty to \nreview whether the legislature has fulfilled its obligation.[18] Considerations of justiciability must be \nbalanced against the principle that every presumption is to be indulged in favor of subject matter \njurisdiction. See, e.g., Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Hillcrest Associates, 233 Conn. 153, 163, 659 A.2d \n138 16*16 (1995); Simms v. Warden, 230 Conn. 608, 614, 646 A.2d 126 (1994); Statev. Metz, 230 Conn. 400, \n410, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); Tolly v. Dept. of Human Resources,225 Conn. 13, 29, 621 A.2d 719 (1993); see \nalso United States Dept. of Commerce v. Montana, 503 U.S. 442, 459, 112 S. Ct. 1415, 118 L. Ed. 2d 87 \n(1992). In this case, our precedents compel the conclusion that the balance must be struck in favor of \nthe justiciability of the plaintiffs' complaint. \nB \nThe defendants maintain that even if the plaintiffs' claims are justiciable, the plaintiffs are not entitled \nto judicial relief because the educational disparities of which they complain do not result from the \nrequisite state action. The plaintiffs claim that the state bears responsibility to correct the \nconstitutional violations alleged in their complaint because of the state's failure to \"take corrective \nmeasures to [e]nsure that its Hartford public schoolchildren receive an equal educational \nopportunity.\"[19] That failure is actionable, according to the plaintiffs, because of the state's \nknowledge of the racial and ethnic isolation in the Hartford schools, combined with the state's \nextensive involvement in the operations of Connecticut's public schools and the impact of state \nstatutes mandating school attendance within statutorily defined school districts. General Statutes §§ \n10-184 and 10-240.[20] The defendants maintain, to the contrary, that the state's constitutional duty to \nprovide for the elementary and secondary education of Connecticut schoolchildren is triggered only \nby state action that is alleged to be intentional state misconduct. The trial court relied on the absence \nof such intentional state 17*17 action in denying relief to the plaintiffs. We disagree with the trial \ncourt's decision. \nThe defendants' argument, derived largely from principles of federal constitutional law, founders on \nthe fact that article eighth, § 1, and article first, §§ 1 and 20, impose on the legislature \nan affirmative constitutional obligation to provide schoolchildren throughout the state with a \nsubstantially equal educational opportunity. Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 648-49. It follows that, if the \nlegislature fails, for whatever reason, to take action to remedy substantial inequalities in the \neducational opportunities that such children are being afforded, its actions and its omissions \nconstitute state action. \nThe affirmative constitutional obligation that we recognized in Horton I and Horton III,and reaffirmed \nrecently in Moore v. Ganim, 233 Conn. 557, 595-96, 660 A.2d 742 (1995), was not premised on a \nshowing that the legislature had played an active role in creating the inequalities that the constitution \nrequires it to redress. In Horton I, we determined that the state's educational financing scheme was \nunconstitutional even though it was facially nondiscriminatory and even though the disparities \nresulting therefrom had not been created intentionally by the legislature. These constitutionally \n\nunacceptable disparities developed, instead, \"from the circumstance that over the years there [had] \narisen a great disparity in the ability of local communities to finance local education,\" and from the \nlegislature's failure to consider \"the financial capability of [each] municipality....\" Horton I, supra, 172 \nConn. 648. In declaring this statutory scheme unconstitutional in Horton I, and in requiring further \nremedial action in Horton III, supra, 195 Conn. 38, 43-44, we necessarily determined that the state's \nfailure adequately to address school funding inequalities constituted the state action that is the \nconstitutional prerequisite for affording judicial relief. \n18*18 The claims now before us likewise implicate the legislature's affirmative constitutional \nobligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity to all of the state's schoolchildren. \nThe plaintiffs document the existence of an extensive statutory system developed in response to the \nlegislature's plenary authority over state public elementary and secondary schools.[21] As a general \nmatter, the plaintiffs challenge the failure of the legislature to address continuing unconstitutional \ninequities resulting, de facto, from that scheme. In addition, and more specifically, they point to two \nstatutes that directly impact on their claims of constitutional deprivation. State law sets the borders of \nschool districts to coincide with town boundaries; General Statutes § 10-240;[22] and requires all \nchildren to attend public school within the district in which they reside. General Statutes § 10-\n184.[23] The trial court expressly found that the enforcement of these statutes constitutes the \"single \nmost important factor\" creating the present racial and 19*19 ethnic imbalance in the Hartford public \nschool system.[24] The failure adequately to address the racial and ethnic disparities that exist among \nthe state's public school districts is not different in kind from the legislature's failure adequately to \naddress the \"great disparity in the ability of local communities to finance local education\" that made \nthe statutory scheme at issue in Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 648, unconstitutional in its application.[25] \nThe defendants maintain, however, that the logic of this inference is undermined by certain other \nprecedents of this court. The defendants rely particularly on Savage v. Aronson, 214 Conn. 256, 571 \nA.2d 696 (1990), in which we concluded that the state's failure to provide emergency housing to \nrecipients of federal welfare benefits did not constitute state action. Although we recognized that the \nabsence of emergency housing might 20*20 have a deleterious impact on the opportunity of children \nto attend school, we held that this secondary effect was not a sufficient basis for imposing \nconstitutional liability upon the state. See id., 286-87. Savage, however, sheds no light on the state \naction requirement in this case because, as we explained in Savage; see id., 284-86; the state has \nno affirmative constitutional obligation to provide emergency housing, while it does have an \naffirmative constitutional obligation with respect to public elementary and secondary education. \nThe defendants also invoke two cases in which this court declined to find state action because the \npertinent actors were private parties rather than the state itself. In Lockwood v. Killian, 172 Conn. 496, \n504-505, 375 A.2d 998 (1977), we concluded that private discrimination by the testator of a scholarship \nfund who had restricted its beneficiaries on the basis of religion did not constitute state action. \nIn Cologne v. Westfarms Associates, 192 Conn. 48, 64-66, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984), we concluded that the \ngovernmental regulation and public use of a private shopping mall did not transform the mall owners' \nrefusal to allow political speech within the mall into state action. Although this aspect of the state \naction doctrine arguably is related to the question before us; see Lebron v. National R.R. Passenger \nCorp., 513 U.S. 374, 378-79, 115 S. Ct. 961, 130 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1995); it cannot be controlling in a case in \nwhich action or inaction by the state is directly implicated. \nIn addition to these state cases, the defendants urge us to follow federal precedents that concededly \nrequire, as a matter of federal constitutional law, that claimants seeking judicial relief for educational \ndisparities pursuant to the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States \nconstitution must prove intentional governmental discrimination against a suspect class. See, \ne.g., Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 494,112 S. Ct. 1430, 118 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1992) (\"[o]nce 21*21 the racial \nimbalance due to the de jure violation has been remedied, the school district is under no duty to \n\nremedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors\"); Pasadena City Board of \nEducation v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 434, 96 S. Ct. 2697, 49 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1976)(United States \nconstitution is not violated in absence of segregative efforts by state); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. \n717, 746-47, 747 n.22, 94 S. Ct. 3112, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (1974) (\"[t]he suggestion ... that schools which \nhave a majority of [African-American] students are not `desegregated' ... however neutrally the \ndistrict lines have been drawn and administered, finds no support in our prior cases\"); cf. Arlington \nHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-65, 97 S. Ct. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 \n(1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242, 96 S. Ct. 2040, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1976). According to the \ndefendants, because the plaintiffs raise claims of unconstitutional disparities in educational \nopportunities on the basis of severe racial and ethnic imbalances among school districts, the \nplaintiffs, too, must prove intentional state action.[26] \nFor two reasons, we are not persuaded that we should adopt these precedents as a matter of state \nconstitutional law. First and foremost, the federal cases start from the premise that there is no right \nto education under the United States constitution. San Antonio Independent School \nDistrict v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 35, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16 (1973). Our Connecticut constitution, \nby contrast, contains a fundamental right to education and a corresponding affirmative state \nobligation to implement and maintain that right. See Moore v. Ganim, supra, 233 Conn. 595-\n96; Broadley v. Board of 22*22Education, 229 Conn. 1, 6, 639 A.2d 502 (1994); Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. \n645. Second, the federal cases are guided by principles of federalism as \"a foremost consideration in \ninterpreting any of the pertinent constitutional provisions under which [a court] examines state \naction.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, supra, \n44; see generally L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1988) § 18-2, p. 1691. As the United \nStates Supreme Court noted, \"it would be difficult to imagine a case having a greater potential \nimpact on our federal system than the one now before us, in which we are urged to abrogate \nsystems of financing public education presently in existence in virtually every State.\" San Antonio \nIndependent School District v. Rodriguez, supra, 44. Principles of federalism, however, do not \nrestrict our constitutional authority to enforce the constitutional mandates contained in article eighth, \n§ 1, and article first, §§ 1 and 20. \nFederal constitutional law, furthermore, has not invariably required intentional state action as a \nrequisite foundation for constitutional remedies. In cases involving the fundamental right to vote, the \nUnited States Supreme Court has held state action to be implicated by the legislature's failure to \ntake the proper steps to implement its affirmative constitutional duty. See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. \n533, 561-63, 568, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1964); see also Board of Estimate v. Morris, 489 U.S. \n688, 692-93, 109 S. Ct. 1433, 103 L. Ed. 2d 717 (1989); Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, 479 \nU.S. 208, 227, 107 S. Ct. 544, 93 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1986); Abate v. Mundt, 403 U.S. 182, 185-86, 91 S. Ct. 1904, \n29 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1971); Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 818, 89 S. Ct. 1493, 23 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1969); United \nStates v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 318-19, 61 S. Ct. 1031, 85 L. Ed. 1368 (1941).[27] We can perceive \nno 23*23 principled distinction between judicial intervention to require legislative action to protect the \nfundamental right to vote and judicial intervention to require legislative action to protect the \nfundamental right to a substantially equal educational opportunity. \nIn summary, under our law, which imposes an affirmative constitutional obligation on the legislature \nto provide a substantially equal educational opportunity for all public schoolchildren, the state action \ndoctrine is not a defense to the plaintiffs' claims of constitutional deprivation. The state had ample \nnotice of ongoing trends toward racial and ethnic isolation in its public schools, and indeed \nundertook a number of laudable remedial efforts[28] that unfortunately have not achieved their \ndesired end. The fact that the legislature did not affirmatively create or intend to create the \nconditions that have led to the racial and ethnic isolation in the Hartford public school system does \nnot, in and of itself, 24*24 relieve the defendants of their affirmative obligation to provide the plaintiffs \nwith a more effective remedy for their constitutional grievances. \n\nIII \nTHE PLAINTIFFS' CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS \nWe turn now to the merits of the plaintiffs' claims. No statute, no common law precedent, no federal \nconstitutional principle provides this state's schoolchildren with a right to a public education that is \nnot burdened by de facto racial and ethnic segregation. The plaintiffs make no such claim. The issue \nthat they raise is whether they have stated a case for relief under our state constitution, which was \namended in 1965 to provide both a right to a free public elementary and secondary education; Conn. \nConst., art. VIII, § 1; and a right to protection from segregation. Conn. Const., art. I, § 20. This issue \nraises questions that are difficult; the answers that we give are controversial. We are, however, \npersuaded that a fair reading of the text and the history of these amendments demonstrates a deep \nand abiding constitutional commitment to a public school system that, in fact and in law, provides \nConnecticut schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity. A significant \ncomponent of that substantially equal educational opportunity is access to a public school education \nthat is not substantially impaired by racial and ethnic isolation. \nOur analysis of this issue has three parts. First, what are the constituent elements of the affirmative \nconstitutional mandate to provide all public schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational \nopportunity in the context of alleged racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities? Second, does the \nplaintiffs' complaint encompass these elements? Third, have the plaintiffs proven their claim? \n25*25 A \nSince Horton I, it is common ground that the state has an affirmative constitutional obligation to \nprovide all public schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity. Horton I, supra, \n172 Conn. 648-49; see also Benjamin v. Bailey, 234 Conn. 455, 461-62, 662 A.2d 1226 (1995); New \nHaven v. State Board of Education, 228 Conn. 699, 707-708, 638 A.2d 589 (1994); Horton III, supra, 195 \nConn. 34-35. Any infringement of that right must be strictly scrutinized. Horton I, supra, 646. \nThe issue presented by this case is whether the state has fully satisfied its affirmative constitutional \nobligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity if the state demonstrates that it \nhas substantially equalized school funding and resources. The defendants urge us to adopt such a \nlimited construction of our constitution. The plaintiffs, to the contrary, urge us to adopt a broader \nformulation. They argue that the combination of \"racial segregation, the concentration of poor \nchildren in the schools, and disparities in educational resources ... deprive [Hartford schoolchildren] \nof substantially equal educational opportunities.\" We agree with the plaintiffs in part. We need not \ndecide, in this case, the extent to which substantial socioeconomic disparities or disparities in \neducational resources would themselves be sufficient to require the state to intervene in order to \nequalize educational opportunities. For the purposes of the present litigation, we decide only that the \nscope of the constitutional obligation expressly imposed on the state by article eighth, § 1, is \ninformed by the constitutional prohibition against segregation contained in article first, § 20. Reading \nthese constitutional provisions conjointly, we conclude that the existence of extreme racial and \nethnic isolation in the public school system deprives schoolchildren of a substantially equal \neducational opportunity 26*26 and requires the state to take further remedial measures. \nTwo factors persuade us that it is appropriate to undertake a conjoint reading of these provisions of \nour state constitution. One is the special nature of the affirmative constitutional right embodied in \narticle eighth, § 1. The other is the explicit prohibition of segregation contained in article first, § 20. \n\nThe affirmative constitutional obligation of the state to provide a substantially equal educational \nopportunity, which is embodied in article eighth, § 1, differs in kind from most constitutional \nobligations. Organic documents only rarely contain provisions that explicitly require the state to act \nrather than to refrain from acting. See Moore v. Ganim,supra, 233 Conn. 557. As we observed, \nhowever, in Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 645,\"educational equalization cases are `in significant aspects \nsui generis' and not subject to analysis by accepted conventional tests or the application of \nmechanical standards. The wealth discrimination found among school districts differs materially from \nthe usual equal protection case where a fairly defined indigent class suffers discrimination to its \npeculiar disadvantage. The discrimination is relative rather than absolute.\" See also Horton III,supra, \n195 Conn. 35. Nothing in the description of the relevant legal landscape in any of our cases suggests \nthat the constitutional right that we articulated in Horton I was limited to school financing. \nFor Connecticut schoolchildren, the scope of the state's constitutional obligation to provide a \nsubstantially equal educational opportunity is informed and amplified by the highly \nunusual[29] provision in article 27*27 first, § 20, that prohibits segregation not only indirectly, by \nforbidding discrimination, but directly, by the use of the term \"segregation.\" The section provides in \nrelevant part: \"No person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to \nsegregation or discrimination... because of ... race [or] ... ancestry....\" (Emphasis added.) \nThe express inclusion of the term \"segregation\" in article first, § 20, has independent constitutional \nsignificance. The addition of this term to the text of our equal protection clause distinguishes this \ncase from others in which we have found a substantial equivalence between our equal protection \nclause and that contained in the United States constitution.[30] Broadley v. Board of Education, supra, \n229 Conn. 8 n.15; Franklin v. Berger, 211 Conn. 591, 594 n.5, 560 A.2d 444 \n(1989); Keogh 28*28 v. Bridgeport, 187 Conn. 53, 66, 444 A.2d 225 (1982). Fundamental principles of \nconstitutional interpretation require that \"[e]ffect must be given to every part of and each word in our \nconstitution....\" Cahill v. Leopold, 141 Conn. 1, 21, 103 A.2d 818 (1954); State v. Gethers, 197 Conn. 369, \n386, 497 A.2d 408 (1985); Stolberg v. Caldwell, 175 Conn. 586, 597-98, 402 A.2d 763 (1978), appeal \ndismissed sub nom. Stolberg v. Davidson,454 U.S. 958, 102 S. Ct. 496, 70 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1981). In other \ncases, we have held that, insofar as article first, § 20, differs textually from its federal counterpart, its \njudicial construction must reflect such a textual distinction. See AFSCME, Council 4, Local 681, AFL-\nCIO v. West Haven, 234 Conn. 217, 221 n.6, 661 A.2d 587 (1995) (per curiam); Daly v. DelPonte, 225 Conn. \n499, 513, 624 A.2d 876 (1993). \nThe issue before us, therefore, is what specific meaning to attach to the protection against \nsegregation contained in article first, § 20, in a case in which that protection is invoked as part of the \nplaintiff schoolchildren's fundamental affirmative right to a substantially equal educational opportunity \nunder article eighth, § 1. In concrete terms, this issue devolves into the question of whether the state \nhas a constitutional duty to remedy the educational impairment that results from segregation in the \nHartford public schools, even though the conditions of segregation that contribute to such \nimpairment neither were caused nor are perpetuated by invidious intentional conduct on the part of \nthe state. \nLinguistically, the term \"segregation\" in article first, § 20, which denotes \"separation,\"[31]is neutral \nabout segregative 29*29 intent. The section prohibits segregation that occurs \"because of religion, \nrace, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability\"; (emphasis added); without \nspecifying the manner in which such a causal relationship must be established. \nWhatever this language may portend in other contexts, we are persuaded that, in the context of \npublic education, in which the state has an affirmative obligation to monitor and to equalize \neducational opportunity, the state's awareness of existing and increasing severe racial and ethnic \nisolation imposes upon the state the responsibility to remedy \"segregation ... because of race [or] ... \n\nancestry ... ,\"[32] We therefore hold 30*30 that, textually, article eighth, § 1, as informed by article first, \n§ 20, requires the legislature to take affirmative responsibility to remedy segregation in our public \nschools, regardless of whether that segregation has occurred de jure or de facto. \nThe history of the promulgation of article eighth, § 1, and article first, § 20, supports our conclusion \nthat these constitutional provisions include protection from de facto segregation, at least in public \nschools. That history includes not only the contemporaneous addition, in 1965, of these two \nprovisions to our constitution, but also the strong commitment to ending discrimination and \nsegregation that is evident in the remarks of the delegates to the 1965 constitutional convention. \nFirst, it is undisputed that the duty to provide a public education contained in article eighth, § 1, and \nthe prohibition against segregation contained in article first, § 20, were proposed to and adopted by \nthe voters of this state in response to the constitutional convention of 1965. When the convention \ndelegates debated the desirability of both amendments to our state constitution, they recognized and \nendorsed the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 495, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. \nEd. 873 (1954), declaring the unconstitutionality of \"separate but equal\" public school education. See \n2 Proceedings of the Connecticut Constitutional Convention of 1965, p. 691, remarks of Chase G. \nWoodhouse.[33] The primary motivation for the addition of article eighth, § 1, to the constitution in \n1965 appears to have been the realization that Connecticut 31*31 was the only state in the nation \nthat did not provide any express right to public elementary and secondary education in its \nconstitution. See 3 Proceedings, supra, pp. 1039-40, remarks of Simon J. Bernstein.[34] The \ndelegates' expectation that the proposed amendments to the constitution would secure interrelated \nconstitutional rights was underscored by Bernstein's remark that article first, § 20, was intended to \nbe applied in the context of the \"rights of freedom in education.\" 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 694. \nSecond, it is significant that the debate over the amendment of article first, § 20, manifested the \nintention of the convention delegates to extend broad protection to all persons from all forms of racial \nand ethnic discrimination and segregation. The debate over the express inclusion of the term \n\"segregation\" focused not on whether including such a term might reach too far, but rather on \nwhether it might invite too narrow a construction of the prohibition against discrimination. It was for \nthis reason that the rules committee felt that language regarding segregation was unnecessary. 2 \nProceedings, supra, p. 692, remarks of Chief Justice Raymond E. Baldwin. The convention \ndelegates' decision nonetheless to retain the term \"segregation\"[35] was 32*32 premised on the \nacknowledged importance of unequivocal opposition to all that is encompassed by this invidious \nphilosophy and practice. See 2 Proceedings, supra, pp. 690-92, remarks of Chase G. Woodhouse \nand James J. Kennelly.[36] In effect, the convention delegates inserted into article first, § 20, \nconstitutional language that was intended to prohibit not only discrimination, but also segregation on \nthe basis of race or ethnicity.[37] \nFinally, the convention delegates' manifest intent that article first, § 20, by prohibiting segregation, \nshould provide 33*33 \"total protection against discrimination\"; 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 692, remarks \nof James J. Kennelly; supports our conclusion that they intended to encompass de facto segregation \nin the circumstances presented by the present case. If significant racial and ethnic isolation \ncontinues to occur within the public schools, for which the legislature has an affirmative constitutional \nobligation to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity, no special showing of an \ninvidious segregative intent is required. \nIt would be illogical not to prohibit all such segregation in light of the legislature's otherwise \ncomprehensive assumption of responsibility for the education of Connecticut schoolchildren. The \nlegislature has created the current school districts, has required students to attend school and has \ndetermined which students will attend a particular school district. General Statutes §§ 10-184 and \n\n10-240. The state cannot now avoid its responsibilities by invoking constitutional restraints \narticulated for different purposes under different constitutional provisions. \nSound principles of public policy support our conclusion that the legislature's affirmative \nconstitutional responsibility for the education of all public schoolchildren encompasses responsibility \nfor segregation to which the legislature has contributed, even unintentionally. The parties agree, as \nthe trial court expressly found, that racial and ethnic segregation is harmful, and that integration \nwould likely have positive benefits for all children and for society as a whole. Further, as the trial \ncourt also expressly found, the racial and ethnic isolation of children in the Hartford schools is likely \nto worsen in the future. \nRacial and ethnic segregation has a pervasive and invidious impact on schools, whether the \nsegregation 34*34 results from intentional conduct or from unorchestrated demographic factors. \n\"[S]chools are an important socializing institution, imparting those shared values through which \nsocial order and stability are maintained.\" Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 222 n.20, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 72 L. \nEd. 2d 786 (1982). Schools bear central responsibility for \"inculcating [the] fundamental values \nnecessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system....\" Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 77, \n99 S. Ct. 1589, 60 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1979). When children attend racially and ethnically isolated schools, \nthese \"shared values\" are jeopardized: \"If children of different races and economic and social groups \nhave no opportunity to know each other and to live together in school, they cannot be expected to \ngain the understanding and mutual respect necessary for the cohesion of our society.\" (Internal \nquotation marks omitted.) Jenkins v. Township of Morris School District, 58 N.J. 483, 498, 279 A.2d 619 \n(1971). \"[T]he elimination of racial isolation in the schools promotes the attainment of equal \neducational opportunity and is beneficial to all students, both black and white.\" Lee v. Nyquist, 318 F. \nSup. 710, 714 (W.D.N.Y. 1970), affd without opinion, 402 U.S. 935, 91 S. Ct. 1618, 29 L. Ed. 2d 105 (1971). \nOur state constitution, as amended in 1965, imposes on the state an affirmative obligation to \nrespond to such segregation. \nB \nHaving concluded that the provisions of article eighth, § 1, as informed by article first, § 20, permit a \nstate constitutional challenge to substantial disparities in educational opportunities resulting from \nracially and ethnically segregated public schools, we turn now to an examination of the plaintiffs' \npleadings to determine whether they fairly can be read to encompass such a challenge. Because the \nremedies sought by the plaintiffs in their complaint are not differentially tied to the \nvarious 35*35 substantive claims that they have alleged, the plaintiffs can succeed if any of their \nclaims falls within the constitutional right as we have defined it. We are persuaded that the plaintiffs' \npleadings cross this threshold. \nIn the first count of their complaint, the plaintiffs relied on article first, §§ 1 and 20, and article eighth, \n§ 1, for what they have characterized as a per se claim that they have suffered from unconstitutional \nsegregation.[38] In the second count, the plaintiffs alleged that disparities in the racial and ethnic \ncomposition of Hartford public schools as compared with schools in the surrounding school districts \nviolated their constitutional rights under the same constitutional provisions.[39] These two counts can \nreasonably be construed to state a constitutional claim of school segregation as we have defined it. \nBoth counts allege a deprivation of the plaintiffs' right to a substantially equal educational opportunity \nexpressly predicated upon the severe racial and ethnic isolation that exists in the Hartford public \nschool system. The constitutional implications raised by these allegations were fully argued before \nthe trial court, and were fully briefed by the parties before this court. Under 36*36 these \ncircumstances, we conclude that the plaintiffs' pleadings, with respect to counts one and two, state a \nclaim for the deprivation of a substantially equal educational opportunity. We would be remiss in the \nexercise of our constitutional obligation to provide \"remedy by due course of law ... without ... delay\"; \n\nConn. Const., art. I, § 10; if we were to deprive the plaintiffs of a remedy solely because, as a \npleading matter, their claims were stated in two counts rather than combined in one.[40] \nIn the third count of the plaintiffs' complaint, they invoked article first, §§ 1 and 20, and article eighth, \n§ 1, for a different purpose. They alleged that the defendants have failed to provide schoolchildren in \nthe Hartford public school system with the educational resources necessary to obtain a minimally \nadequate education. As pleaded in their complaint and as argued before the trial court, this claim \nwas not expressly predicated upon the severe racial and ethnic isolation that exists in the Hartford \npublic school system. Moreover, at oral argument, the plaintiffs conceded that they had never \nclaimed, either at trial or in their appellate brief, that the opportunity to participate in a racially and \nethnically diverse education is a constitutionally required component of a minimally adequate \neducation. Accordingly, we conclude that the third count of the plaintiffs' complaint does not implicate \nthe constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity as defined in part III A. \nBecause, however, the plaintiffs' remedial claims do not depend upon the validity of the \nthird 37*37 count of their complaint, we need not reach the merits of this claim.[41] \nC \nThe final issue before us is whether, in light of the findings of the trial court, some of which the \nplaintiffs deem erroneous, the plaintiffs have proven a violation of their fundamental right, under the \nstate constitution, to a substantially equal educational opportunity that is free from substantial racial \nand ethnic isolation. We conclude that they have done so. \n\"[I]n Connecticut the right to education is so basic and fundamental that any infringement of that right \nmust be strictly scrutinized.\" Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 646; Horton III,supra, 195 Conn. 35. Proper \nevaluation of the plaintiffs' claims is best pursued in accordance with the methodology that we \nadopted and applied in Horton III, supra, 38-39. This methodology requires us to balance the \nlegislature's affirmative constitutional obligation to provide all of the state's schoolchildren with a \nsubstantially equal educational opportunity against the legislature's recognized significant discretion \nin matters of public elementary and secondary education. \nThe analysis that we adopted in Horton III to scrutinize legislation that allegedly infringes upon the \nfundamental right to education requires a three-step process: \n38*38 \"First, the plaintiffs must make a prima facie showing that the disparities ... are more than de \nminimis in that the disparities continue to jeopardize the plaintiffs' fundamental right to education. If \nthey make that showing, the burden then shifts to the state to justify these disparities as incident to \nthe advancement of a legitimate state policy. If the state's justification is acceptable, the state must \nfurther demonstrate that the continuing disparities are nevertheless not so great as to be \nunconstitutional.\" Id., 38; see also id., 45, 45 n.25. Applying the parties' stipulated facts and the trial \ncourt's factual findings to this analytical framework, we are persuaded that the current school \nassignment scheme, principally embodied in §§ 10-184 and 10-240, violates the plaintiffs' \nfundamental right to a substantially equal educational opportunity. \nThe plaintiffs have shown, and the defendants do not contest, that the disparities in the racial and \nethnic composition of public schools in Hartford and the surrounding communities are more than de \nminimis. While children from minority groups constituted 25.7 percent of the statewide public school \npopulation in the 1991-92 school year, 92.4 percent of the children in the Hartford public school \nsystem were members of minority groups, including, predominantly, students who were either \nAfrican-American or Latino. The percentage of minority students enrolled in Hartford's public schools \nhas since increased. In the 1994-95 school year, 94.5 percent of the children in the Hartford public \n\nschool system were members of minority groups.[42] Moreover, the Hartford public school system \ncurrently enrolls the highest percentage of minority students in the state, and this \npercentage 39*39 is likely to become even higher in the future, if current conditions continue. These \ndisparities jeopardize the plaintiffs' fundamental right to education. \nThe defendants stress that the trial court also made extensive findings about the significant role that \nadverse socioeconomic conditions play in the difficulties encountered by Hartford schoolchildren. \nAlthough the findings of the trial court are supported by credible evidence, they do not undermine the \nplaintiffs' claim. It is well established, under prevailing principles governing the law of equal \nprotection, that poverty is not a suspect classification. Moscone v. Manson, 185 Conn. 124, 130, 440 \nA.2d 848 (1981); see Harrisv. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 323, 100 S. Ct. 2671, 65 L. Ed. 2d 784 (1980). The \nplaintiffs have not brought an equal protection claim challenging these principles. \nThe trial court's findings simply demonstrate that Hartford's schoolchildren labor under a dual \nburden: their poverty and their racial and ethnic isolation. These findings regarding the causal \nrelationship between the poverty suffered by Hartford schoolchildren and their poor academic \nperformance cannot be read in isolation. They do not diminish the significance of the stipulations and \nundisputed findings that the Hartford public school system suffers from severe and increasing racial \nand ethnic isolation, that such isolation is harmful to students of all races, and that the districting \nstatute codified at § 10-240 is the single most important factor contributing to the concentration of \nracial and ethnic minorities in the Hartford public school system. The fact that, as pleaded, the \nplaintiffs' complaint does not provide them a constitutional remedy for one of their afflictions, namely, \ntheir poverty, is not a ground for depriving them of a remedy for the other. \nThe uncontested evidence of the severe racial and ethnic isolation of Hartford's schoolchildren \ndemonstrates 40*40 that the state has failed to fulfill its affirmative constitutional obligation to provide \nall of the state's schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity. Much like the \nsubstantially unequal access to fiscal resources that we found constitutionally unacceptable \nin Horton I, the disparity in access to an unsegregated educational environment in this case arises \nout of state action and inaction that, prima facie, violates the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, although \nthat segregation has occurred de facto rather than de jure. Thus, because the plaintiffs have made \nthe requisite prima facie showing that their fundamental right to a substantially equal educational \nopportunity has been jeopardized, the burden of justification shifts to the state. \nWe next consider whether the defendants have met their burden of demonstrating that the \ndisparities in the plaintiffs' educational opportunities are \"incident to the advancement of a legitimate \nstate policy.\" Horton III, supra, 195 Conn. 38. The defendants emphasize the uncontested fact that, \nalthough the state has created and maintained the public elementary and secondary school system, \nincluding the districting and the attendance statutes; General Statutes §§ 10-184 and 10-240; the \nstate bears no de jure responsibility for the racial and ethnic isolation that the plaintiffs have \nencountered. \nThe statutes enacted by the legislature and the educational strategies adopted by the state \ndemonstrate that the state has acted to further policies that are both legitimate and facially neutral \nwith respect to racial and ethnic isolation. The General Assembly has enacted no legislation that was \nintended to cause either de jure or de facto segregation. It enacted the districting statute, not to \nimpose or to foster racial or ethnic isolation, but to improve educational quality for all Connecticut \nschoolchildren by increasing state involvement in all aspects of public elementary and secondary \neducation. 41*41 Moreover, the districting scheme presently furthers the legitimate nonracial \ninterests of permitting considerable local control and accountability in educational matters. \nFurthermore, in recognition of its moral obligation to address the adverse consequences of racial \nand ethnic discrimination, the state reorganized the board of education, during the 1980s, to \n\nconcentrate on the needs of urban schoolchildren and to promote diversity in the public schools. \nUnder General Statutes § 10-226a et seq., which the legislature enacted to remedy racial \nimbalances within public school districts, all schools within a district must maintain, within specified \ntolerances, a student population that reflects the student population in the district as a whole. In \naddition, the state has supported and encouraged voluntary plans for increasing interdistrict \ndiversity. It has provided financial support to interdistrict magnet programs and has enacted \nlegislation to promote voluntaryinterdistrict solutions to racial and ethnic isolation. See General \nStatutes § 10-264a et seq. In all these respects, the state has furthered agendas that are legitimate. \nAccordingly, the defendants have sustained their initial burden of justifying the legitimacy of the \nstate's actions. \nIn light of the defendants' affirmative showing, we now consider the third part of the Horton III test. \nOnce the state's justification for its official actions has been shown to be acceptable, \"the state must \nfurther demonstrate that the continuing disparities are nevertheless not so great as to be \nunconstitutional.\" Horton III, supra, 195 Conn. 38. In the context of the present claims, the state must \ndemonstrate that, in light of its recognized discretion in matters of public elementary and secondary \neducation, and taking into account the measures that it has taken to remedy racial and ethnic \ndisparities in the public schools, the disparities are not so significant as to rise to the level of a \nconstitutional deprivation. In our assessment of whether the state has 42*42 met its burden, we again \nemphasize that, much like the substantially unequal fiscal resources that we found constitutionally \nunacceptable in Horton I and Horton III, the disparity in access to an unsegregated educational \nenvironment in this case arises out of discrimination that is de facto rather than de jure. \nWe conclude that the defendants have failed to satisfy their difficult burden. Despite the initiatives \nundertaken by the defendants to alleviate the severe racial and ethnic disparities among school \ndistricts, and despite the fact that the defendants did not intend to create or maintain these \ndisparities, the disparities that continue to burden the education of the plaintiffs infringe upon their \nfundamental state constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity. \nOur conclusion finds uncontested factual support in the stipulations of the parties, which provide \ndramatic documentation of the wide disparities in the racial and ethnic composition of the student \npopulations in the public schools in Hartford and those in the twenty-one surrounding communities. \nAlthough we have discussed these statistics previously in this opinion, they bear repeating. The \npercentage of minorities who attend Hartford public schools is significantly higher than the \npercentage of minorities who attend schools in the surrounding school districts. In the 1991-92 \nschool year, over 92 percent of the students in the Hartford public school system were members of \nminority groups. In stark contrast, in that same period, only seven of the twenty-one surrounding \nsuburban towns had a student minority enrollment above 10 percent. We rely also on the findings \nmade by the trial court, which have not been contested by any of the parties, that despite efforts by \nthe state to alleviate the severe racial and ethnic isolation that exists in the Hartford public school \nsystem, \"[s]tudents in the Hartford schools are racially isolated and are likely to become more \nisolated in the 43*43 future\"[43] and that \"[t]he single most important factor that contribute[s] to the \npresent concentration of racial and ethnic minorities in Hartford [is] the town-school district \nsystem [codified at § 10-240] which has existed since 1909, when the legislature consolidated most \nof the school districts in the state so that thereafter town boundaries became the dividing lines \nbetween all school districts in the state.\" (Emphasis added.) This record compels the conclusion that \nthe present state regulation of public elementary and secondary education \"emasculate[s] the goal of \nsubstantial equality.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Horton III, supra, 195 Conn. 38. We conclude, \ntherefore, that the school districting scheme, as codified at §§ 10-184 and 10-240 and as enforced \nwith regard to these plaintiffs, is unconstitutional. \n\nIt is crucial for a democratic society to provide all of its schoolchildren with fair access to an \nunsegregated education. As the United States Supreme Court has eloquently observed, a sound \neducation \"is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening \nthe child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to \nadjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be \nexpected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, \nwhere the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal \nterms.\" Brown v. Board of Education, supra, 347 U.S. 493. \"The American people have always regarded \neducation and [the] acquisition of knowledge as matters of supreme importance.... We have \nrecognized the public schools as a most vital civic institution for the preservation of a \ndemocratic 44*44 system of government ... and as the primary vehicle for transmitting the values on \nwhich our society rests.... And these historic perceptions of the public schools as inculcating \nfundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system have been \nconfirmed by the observations of social scientists.... [E]ducation provides the basic tools by which \nindividuals might lead economically productive lives to the benefit of us all. In sum, education has a \nfundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our society. We cannot ignore the significant social \ncosts borne by our Nation when select groups are denied the means to absorb the values and skills \nupon which our social order rests.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks \nomitted.) Plyler v. Doe, supra, 457 U.S. 221. \nAlthough the constitutional basis for the plaintiffs' claims is the deprivation that they themselves are \nsuffering, that deprivation potentially has an impact on \"the entire state and its economy—not only \non its social and cultural fabric, but on its material well-being, on its jobs, industry, and business. \nEconomists and business leaders say that our state's economic well-being is dependent on more \nskilled workers, technically proficient workers, literate and well-educated citizens. And they point to \nthe urban poor as an integral part of our future economic strength.... So it is not just that their future \ndepends on the State, the state's future depends on them.\" Abbott v. Burke, 119 N.J. 287, 392, 575 A.2d \n359 (1990). Finding a way to cross the racial and ethnic divide has never been more important than it \nis today. \nIV \nREMEDIES \nOur decision to reverse the judgment of the trial court, and to direct that judgment be rendered on \nbehalf of the plaintiffs on the merits of their constitutional 45*45 claims in the first and second counts \nof their complaint, requires us to consider what relief may properly be afforded to the plaintiffs. We \nrecognize that the fashioning of appropriate declaratory or injunctive relief requires careful \nconsideration in order to weigh the benefits and costs of various remedial measures. \nIn their appeal to this court, the plaintiffs have not focused their attention on the remedial \nconsequences of a substantive decision in their behalf. Their prayer for relief asks us to reverse the \njudgment of the trial court and to remand the case with direction to render a declaratory judgment \nand \"for further equitable relief not inconsistent with [our] decision.\" The defendants urge this court \nnot to assume direct control of the educational system in Connecticut and to eschew \"acting as a \nsuper-legislature and glorified [b]oard of [e]ducation.\" \nBecause the parties have not had the opportunity to present evidence directed to the remedial \nconsequences that follow from our decision on the merits of the plaintiffs' complaint, we could \nremand this case to the trial court for further proceedings to address remedies. Alternatively, if no \n\nfurther evidentiary inquiries would be required, we could invite further briefing in this court and \nattempt to resolve the issues ourselves. \nWe have decided not to follow either of these avenues but to employ the methodology used \nin Horton I. In that case, the trial court, after having found for the plaintiffs, limited its judgment by \ngranting only declaratory relief but retained jurisdiction to grant consequential relief, if needed, at \nsome future time. Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 650. In light of the complexities of developing a legislative \nprogram that would respond to the constitutional deprivation that the plaintiffs had established, we \nconcluded, in Horton I,that further judicial intervention should be stayed \"to afford the 46*46 General \nAssembly an opportunity to take appropriate legislative action.\" Id., 653. Prudence and sensitivity to \nthe constitutional authority of coordinate branches of government counsel the same caution in this \ncase. \nIn staying our hand, we do not wish to be misunderstood about the urgency of finding an appropriate \nremedy for the plight of Hartford's public schoolchildren. Every passing day denies these children \ntheir constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity. Every passing day \nshortchanges these children in their ability to learn to contribute to their own well-being and to that of \nthis state and nation. We direct the legislature and the executive branch to put the search for \nappropriate remedial measures at the top of their respective agendas. We are confident that with \nenergy and good will, appropriate remedies can be found and implemented in time to make a \ndifference before another generation of children suffers the consequences of a segregated public \nschool education. \nThe defendants counsel us, however, to stay our hand entirely. They claim that no judicial mandate \ncan properly take into account the daunting, if not intractable, difficulties of crafting a remedial \nsolution to the problem of de facto racial and ethnic segregation in the public schools of Hartford. \nWhen a similar question was raised about judicial authority to mandate the reform of state electoral \nsystems, the claim was given short shrift by the United States Supreme Court. The court stated, \nin Reynolds v. Sims, supra, 377 U.S. 566: \"We are told that the matter of apportioning representation in a \nstate legislature is a complex and many-faceted one. We are advised that States can rationally \nconsider factors other than population in apportioning legislative representation. We are admonished \nnot to restrict the power of the States to impose differing views as to political philosophy on their \ncitizens. We are cautioned about the dangers of entering into political thickets \nand 47*47 mathematical quagmires. Our answer is this: a denial of constitutionally protected rights \ndemands judicial protection; our oath and our office require no less of us.\" (Emphasis added.) Our \noath, our office and the constitutional rights of the schoolchildren of Hartford, require no less of us in \nthis case. \nThe judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render a declaratory judgment \nfor the plaintiffs; the Superior Court is directed to retain jurisdiction in accordance with this opinion. \nIn this opinion BERDON, NORCOTT and KATZ, Js., concurred. \nBERDON, J., concurring. I join the Chief Justice in her well reasoned majority opinion that concludes \nthat the racial and ethnic segregation that exists in our public school system deprives schoolchildren \nof their state constitutional right to a \"substantially equal educational opportunity.\"[1] More \nspecifically, I agree \"that, textually, 48*48 article eighth, § 1, [of the Connecticut constitution] as \ninformed by article first, § 20, requires the legislature to take affirmative responsibility to remedy \nsegregation in our public schools, regardless of whether that segregation has occurred de jure or de \nfacto.\" I write separately because, in my view and as the record reflects, a racially and ethnically \nsegregated educational environment also deprives schoolchildren of an adequate education as \nrequired by the state constitution.[2] \n\n49*49 In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954), the Supreme \nCourt of the United States noted that \"education is perhaps the most important function of state and \nlocal governments.... It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in \nawakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him [or her] for later professional training, and in \nhelping him [or her] to adjust normally to his [or her] environment. In these days, it is doubtful that \nany child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he [or she] is denied [an equal \neducational opportunity].\" Twenty-three years later, Justice Bogdanski, in his concurrence \nin Horton v. Meskill, 172 Conn. 615, 654-55, 376 A.2d 359 (1977),reaffirmed that thought: \"[T]he right of \nour children to an education is a matter of right not only because our state constitution declares it as \nsuch, but because education is the very essence and foundation of a civilized culture: it is the \ncohesive element that binds the fabric of society together. In a real sense, it is as necessary to a \ncivilized society as food and shelter are to an individual. It is our fundamental legacy to the youth of \nour state to enable them to acquire knowledge and possess the ability to reason: for it is the ability to \nreason that separates [men and women] from all other forms of life.\" \n50*50 Unlike the federal constitution, the constitution of Connecticut, article eighth, § 1, provides \nthat education is a fundamental right of every child regardless of his or her race or ethnicity. Id., 648-\n49 (\"in Connecticut, elementary and secondary education is a fundamental right, [and] pupils in the \npublic schools are entitled to the equal enjoyment of that right\"). Accordingly, it logically follows that \nthe education guaranteed in the state constitution must be, at the very least, within the context of its \ncontemporary meaning, an adequate education. Even Justice Loiselle, in his dissent \nin Horton v. Meskill, supra, 172 Conn. 658-59, conceded that the provision of an adequate education \nwas constitutionally required and, in discussing the need to interpret that requirement in a \nreasonable manner, stated \"[a] town may not herd children in an open field to hear lectures by \nilliterates.\" Indeed, long before the formal incorporation of this right into our present constitution, this \ncourt recognized the state's \"duty to provide for the propereducation of the young.\" (Emphasis \nadded.) State ex rel. Huntington v. Huntington School District, 82 Conn. 563, 566, 74 A. 882 (1909); see \nalso Bissell v. Davison, 65 Conn. 183, 191, 32 A. 348 (1894).[3] \nThe state has established the boundaries of school districts coextensively with town lines, thereby \nplacing in certain school districts, such as Hartford, overwhelming percentages of minority students. \nIndeed, the trial court found that \"[s]tudents in the Hartford schools are racially isolated and are likely \nto become more isolated in the future.\" In the 1987-88 academic year, 90.5 percent 51*51 of \nHartford's schoolchildren were of minority races or ethnicities. Yet, Hartford, like many of \nConnecticut's urban centers, is encircled by school districts whose student populations include only \na small percentage of minority children.[4] The trial court's forecast that racial and ethnic isolation \nwould increase has unfortunately proven to be accurate. Figures recently released for the 1994-95 \nacademic year, reveal that 93.4 percent of Hartford's students are from minority racial or ethnic \ngroups.[5] \nThis segregation can have a devastating impact on a minority student's education. The United \nStates Supreme Court recognized that segregation \"generates a feeling of inferiority [within the \nstudents] as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely \never to be undone.... Segregation of white and [African-American] children in public schools has a \ndetrimental effect upon [the African-American] children. The impact is greater when it has the \nsanction of the law; for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the \ninferiority of the [African-American]. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. \nSegregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to [retard] the educational and \nmental development of 52*52 [African-American] children and to deprive them of some of the benefits \nthey would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system.\" (Internal quotation marks \nomitted.) Brown v. Board of Education, supra, 347 U. S. 494. \n\nIn order to provide an adequate or \"proper\" education, our children must be educated in a \nnonsegregated environment. The trial court found, \"[e]ducation in its fullest sense for both white and \nminority school children involves interracial and multiethnic exposure to each other and interaction \nbetween them, because racial and ethnic isolation [have] negative effects on both groups.\" Indeed, a \nstudy commissioned by the state department of education in 1989, concluded that \"desegregation \nhas had some positive effect on the reading skills of black youngsters.... [T]here is some evidence \nthat desegregation may help to break what can be thought of as a generational cycle of segregation \nand racial isolation.\" J. Schofield, \"Review of Research on School Desegregation's Impact on \nElementary and Secondary School Students,\" Commissioned by the Connecticut Department of \nEducation (1989) p. 35. The study further concluded that \"there are indications that desegregated \nschooling can provide students with valuable behavioral experience which prepares them to function \nin a pluralistic society.... [T]here is some evidence that school desegregation may have long-term \npositive consequences on adult social relationships, housing patterns, and the like.\" Id., p. 36. \nThe poor academic achievement of Hartford's students is insightful into the devastating effects of \nracial isolation on the students' education. For example, in 1991-92, 94 percent of the sixth graders \nin Hartford's public schools failed to meet the state's goal for mathematics; 80 percent failed to \nachieve the state's goal for reading; and 97 percent failed to obtain the state's goal for writing. \nEqually disturbing is the knowledge that, 53*53 in that same year, 62 percent of Hartford's sixth \ngraders failed to achieve even the state's remedial standards for reading. \nScholastic achievement scores, are but one effect of segregation on education. Children of every \nrace and ethnic background suffer when an educational system is administered on a segregated \nbasis. Education entails not only the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic, but today, in our \nmulticultural world, it also includes the development of social understanding and racial tolerance. If \nthe mission of education is to prepare our children to survive and succeed in today's world, then they \nmust be taught how to live together as one people. Anything less will surely result in a segregated \nsociety with one racial and ethnic community pitted against another. Instead of fostering social \ndivision, we must build an integrated society, commencing with educating our children in a \nnonsegregated environment. \nAccordingly, I conclude that, in addition to the state's failure to provide Hartford schoolchildren with a \n\"substantially equal educational opportunity,\" these children are also being deprived of an adequate \neducation because of their racial and ethnic isolation. It matters little with respect to the quality of the \neducation that the segregation was unintentional. The fact that segregation exists as a result of the \nschool districting statute requires the state to take remedial action to eliminate the constitutional \nviolation of not providing these schoolchildren with an adequate education.[6] \nTime is precious, especially when we are confronted with a constitutional violation that impacts the \nlives of our children and the future of our society. Every day that goes by is one more day that the \nschoolchildren who reside in Hartford and other urban centers in Connecticut are deprived of an \nadequate education. The 54*54 plaintiff Milo Sheff was ten years old and in fourth grade when this \nlitigation commenced more than seven years ago. We cannot recover what has been lost for him \nand others, but for those children who are presently enrolled in our public schools and for those who \nwill enter in the future, we must eliminate the current segregation that exists. \nI agree, however, with the Chief Justice that the executive and legislative branches of the state \ngovernment should be given an opportunity[7] to remedy what is now 55*55 a terrible \nwrong. Nielsen v. State, 236 Conn. 1, 17, 670 A.2d 1288 (1996) (Berdon, J.,concurring). Nevertheless, in \nthe words of United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren, the state must act \"with all \ndeliberate speed.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 301, 75 S. Ct. 753, 99 L. Ed. 1083 (1955). \n\nI join in the majority opinion.[8] \nBORDEN, J., with whom CALLAHAN and PALMER, Js., join, dissenting. The majority has reached a \nresult driven conclusion based on a theory of constitutional liability that was never presented to the \ntrial court or to this court, is ungrounded in the text and history of Connecticut's constitutional \nprovisions regarding the rights to public education and equal protection of the laws and is wholly at \nodds with the factual record in this case. The majority's conclusion, moreover, is contrary to the \nteaching of Horton v. Meskill, 172 Conn. 615, 376 A.2d 359 (1977) (Horton I), this court's principal \nprecedent interpreting those provisions. In its zeal to reach a result that, it envisions, will eliminate \nracial and ethnic concentration in the public school districts of this state, the majority has \n\"[renounced] this Court's historical commitment to a conception of the judiciary as a source of \nimpersonal and reasoned judgments 56*56....\" (Internal quotation marks \nomitted.) Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 844, 111 S. Ct. 2597, 115 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1991) (Marshall and \nBlackmun, Js., dissenting). In essence, \"[p]ower, not reason, is the new currency of this Court's [state \nconstitutional] decisionmaking.\" Id. I therefore dissent.[1] \nMore specifically, in reaching a result that is unprecedented in American jurisprudence the majority \nhas created a constitutional theory of equal educational opportunity that: (1) in the long history of this \ncase, has never been presented to the trial court or to this court, and is, therefore, a theory to which \nthe defendants have never had an opportunity to respond; (2) misapplies our precedent on the \nmeaning of an equal educational opportunity as expressed in Horton I, and is contrary to the \nvoluminous factual findings of the trial court; (3) distorts the meaning of the term \"segregation\" in our \nstate constitution; and (4) misrepresents the record regarding the question of a remedy for the \nconstitutional violation that the majority has found. \nIn addition, the majority sends to the legislature and the executive branch a mandate to fashion a \nremedy for de facto racial and ethnic concentration in our public schools, a task that those branches \nof government will inevitably find to be extraordinarily difficult or perhaps even impossible, because \nthe majority articulates no principle upon which to structure such a remedy. The necessary \nimplication of the majority's reasoning is that virtually every school district in the state is now \neither 57*57 unconstitutional or constitutionally suspect. Without explicitly saying so, the majority has \neffectively struck down, not just for the greater Hartford area but for the entire state, the municipality \nbased school system that has been in effect in this state since 1909. \nIt is significant, moreover, that the majority does not respond to the major substantive flaws in its \nanalysis that this dissent identifies. Nor does it take issue with what I identify as the necessary \nimplications of its decision. \nI \nINTRODUCTION \nBefore analyzing the majority's reasoning and the constitutional claims that the plaintiffs did present \nin this case, I state the extent of my agreement with the majority. First, I agree that the case is \njusticiable, and that there is state action. Moreover, and most importantly, I agree with the majority \non the desirability—as a matter of public and educational policy—of eliminating from our public \nschools the type of racial and ethnic concentration demonstrated by this record. \nI also agree that racial and ethnic isolation in our public schools is harmful—both to those races and \nethnic groups that are so isolated and to the other races and ethnic groups from whom they are \nisolated. I also agree with the majority's statement, based upon the trial court's finding, that the racial \n\nand ethnic isolation of Hartford's schoolchildren is likely to worsen in the future. I agree, furthermore, \nthat racial and ethnic integration of our public schools would be beneficial for all children and society \nin general. These points of agreement rest on the notions that, as the majority recognizes, schools \nare important socializing institutions that bear a central responsibility for imparting our shared \ndemocratic values to our children, and that 58*58 the opportunity for children of different races, ethnic \nbackgrounds, economic levels and social groups to get to know each other in school is important if \nthey are to understand and respect each other. Finally, I agree with the majority that the health of the \neconomy of our state requires an educated workforce, which includes \"the urban poor as an integral \npart of our future economic strength.\" Abbott v. Burke, 119 N.J. 287, 392, 575 A.2d 359 (1990). Thus, I \nagree with the majority on the importance in our state—indeed, in our nation—of finding a way to \ncross the racial divide.[2] \n59*59 The majority, however, has transformed a laudable educational philosophy into a constitutional \nmandate. That philosophy is that racially and ethnically integrated schools are socially and \neducationally preferable to racially and ethnically concentrated schools, because they confer certain \nsignificant social benefits on their students that such concentrated schools cannot, and they avoid \ncertain significant social burdens that such concentrated schools are likely to impose. That belief, \nhowever, is utterly without basis as a constitutional claim of deprivation of an equal educational \nopportunity. Neither the record in this case, the text or history of the Connecticut constitution, nor our \ncase law supports such a claim. A similar example of judicial overreaching 60*60 comes to mind. \nNinety-one years ago the United States Supreme Court, in Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S. Ct. \n539, 49 L. Ed. 937 (1905), declared unconstitutional, as violative of the liberty of contract perceived to \nbe implicit in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, \nNew York's labor law imposing a daily limit of ten hours of work in the bakery industry. Justice \nHolmes dissented, stating that \"[t]he Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's \nSocial Statics,\" and that \"a constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory, \nwhether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the State or of laissez faire.\" Id., 75. \nThis decision ushered into our constitutional jurisprudence what came to be known as \nthe \"Lochner era,\" during which the Supreme Court undertook to strike down legislation that did not \ncomport with the particular economic theories held by a majority of the justices. \nSee Dolan v. Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 409, 114 S. Ct. 2309, 129 L. Ed. 2d 304 (1994) (Stevens, J., \ndissenting) (identifying the \"superlegislative power the Court exercised during the Lochner era\"); 2 R. \nRotunda & J. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1992) § 15.4, pp. 403-404 \n(\"independent review of legislation during [Lochner] era resulted in unprincipled control of social and \neconomic legislation\"); L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1988) § 8-2. \nThe majority opinion in this case does much the same. Just as the justices of the United States \nSupreme Court \"Lochnerized\" the federal due process clause by reading laissez faire economic \ntheory into it, the majority of this court has \"Lochnerized\" our education and equal protection clauses \nby reading into them an educational theory that mandates racially and ethnically integrated schools. \nThere is no more basis today in our constitution for judicial intervention to impose such a \nmandatory 61*61 educational theory than there was in the Lochner era for the judiciary to impose \nlaissez faire economics. \nThus, the majority has used this court's power to interpret the constitution in order to mandate a vast \nand unprecedented social experiment, using the state's schools and schoolchildren as test data, and \nthereby to construct what the majority perceives to be the necessary bridge over the racial \ndivide.[3] The majority has done so, however, without the bricks and mortar necessary to that \nconstruction—the facts, and sound constitutional principles. Indeed, had the factual findings by the \ntrial court been those unsuccessfully sought by the plaintiffs, this case would have been very \ndifferent on 62*62appeal. For example, had the trial court found, as the plaintiffs claimed, that racial \nand ethnic concentration, rather than poverty, results in different educational outcomes and \nachievements, and that the measurements of those outcomes and achievements are valid for \n\ninterdistrict purposes, the plaintiffs' constitutional claim of a deprivation of an equal educational \nopportunity, as they presented it, would have been powerful and might have legitimately prevailed. \nAs this record overwhelmingly demonstrates, however, the trial court found the facts, not in \naccordance with the plaintiffs' version of the evidence on that claim, but in accordance with the \ndefendants' version of the evidence. The trial court found that it is poverty, not racial or ethnic \nconcentration, that accounts for the differences in educational outcomes and achievements between \nthe children of the Hartford schools and those of the surrounding districts. The trial court also found, \ncontrary to the plaintiffs' factual claims but in accordance with the defendants' factual claims, that the \nmeasurements regarding those differences, although valid for certain intradistrict purposes, are not \nvalid for measuring educational differences between different school districts. \nThus, there are no facts in the record to support what the majority asserts, in an opinion long on \nrhetoric and short on reasoning, are the \"devastating effects that racial and ethnic isolation ... have \nhad on [the plaintiffs'] education.\" Indeed, the facts found by the trial court contradict that \nassertion.[4] Under the facts found by the trial court, all of the adverse effects on the \neducation 63*63 of the plaintiffs result, not from their racial or ethnic isolation—either in whole or in \npart—but from their poverty. The majority, nonetheless, compensates for these factual shortcomings \nand for the trial court's factual findings that are squarely contrary to the result the majority seeks to \nachieve, by ignoring those discomforting facts, and constructing a hitherto unknown constitutional \ntheory—hitherto unknown in the long history of this litigation, and hitherto unknown in our even \nlonger state constitutional history—that disregards all facts but those that are undisputed. \nThus, the majority opinion is, like the characters in Pirandello's play, a result in search of a \nrationale.[5] This case was litigated in the trial court for six years. The trial court heard evidence for \neleven weeks. After a remand by this court to the trial court for the purpose of supplementing the \nfactual record, the parties stipulated to 256 facts that are undisputed. Moreover, pursuant to our \nremand, the parties presented to the trial court for resolution a total of 676 disputed issues of fact—\n551 by the plaintiffs and 125 by the defendants. With respect to these disputed issues of fact, the \nparties had presented extensive and conflicting evidence during the eleven weeks of trial. As a \nresult, the trial court made 161 factual findings, in addition to the 256 stipulated facts. Those 417 \nfactual findings constitute the factual basis for the constitutional claims advanced by the plaintiffs in \nthe trial court and renewed on appeal. \nThose findings, however, particularly the 161 facts found by the trial court that had been disputed, \nare critically and fundamentally adverse to the plaintiffs' constitutional claims, as those claims were \npresented both to the trial court and to this court. Precisely because of that critical and fundamental \nfactual adversity, however, the majority has, in an exercise of judicial 64*64 revisionism, recast the \nplaintiffs' constitutional claims so that the trial court's critical factual findings have become irrelevant. \nMoreover, the assertion of the majority to the contrary notwithstanding, it cannot be tenably \nmaintained that the constitutional theory created by the majority was ever presented to the trial court \nor to this court. The defendants, therefore, have never had the opportunity to respond to that theory. \nThere is no question, therefore, that everyone involved in this case shares the same goal: the \nelimination of racial and ethnic isolation in the public schools of this state.[6]Every desirable or wise \npolicy, even every noble goal, however, is not necessarily embodied in the constitution. The debate, \ntherefore, is over whether that goal is constitutionally mandated under the facts of this case. The \nmajority, by an act of judicial will, without fidelity to the facts of the case or the claims of the parties, \nhas imposed a constitutional mandate and has usurped a policy function that legitimately belongs to \nthe legislature. \n\nII \nTHE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS AS DISCLOSED BY THE RECORD IN THIS CASE \nThe majority opinion[7] conceals the constitutional claims presented by the plaintiffs and responded \nto by 65*65 the defendants in the trial court, and on appeal in this court. In addition, the majority has \ncobbled together, from disparate parts of the plaintiffs' claims, a constitutional theory that is wholly \nwithout support in the text, history and purpose of the constitutional provisions at issue in this case, \nor in the facts as found by the trial court. In order to appreciate these criticisms of the majority \nopinion, it is necessary to summarize the plaintiffs' claims regarding a deprivation of an equal \neducational opportunity, as disclosed by this record rather than as expounded by the majority, and \nthen to compare the majority's analysis to the record. Only then is it possible to subject the facts \nfound by the trial court and the constitutional provisions at issue to a reasoned and dispassionate \nanalysis. \nThe plaintiffs presented three constitutional claims to the trial court: (1) the plaintiffs have been \ndenied their constitutional right to an equal educational opportunity by virtue of their racial and ethnic \nconcentration, and by the concentration of poverty in the Hartford school district, coupled with certain \ndisparities in educational resources and outcomes as compared to the suburban districts; (2) the \nracial and ethnic concentration of the plaintiffs in the Hartford school district constitutes a per se \nviolation of the education and equal protection clauses of the constitution, based solely on the \nundisputed demographic facts of that concentration; and (3) the inadequacy of certain educational \nresources in the Hartford school system constitute a denial to the plaintiffs of their constitutional right \nto a minimally adequate education.[8] \nIt is the plaintiffs' first claim—that of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity—that concerns \nus 66*66 here, because that is the claim that the majority sustains on the basis of the undisputed \ndemographic facts. It is indisputable, however, that the plaintiffs' claim of a deprivation of an equal \neducational opportunity was based, not solely on the demographic facts of racial and ethnic isolation \nand concentration of poverty, but on those facts coupled with other facts claimed by the plaintiffs to \ndemonstrate disparities, in terms of educational resources and outcomes, between the Hartford and \nsuburban districts. The plaintiffs' claim of the deprivation of an equal educational opportunity was \npremised on a factual showing that, because of—in a cause and effect sense—their racial and \nethnic isolation, the concentration of poverty in which they live, and the disparities between the \neducational resources available in the Hartford schools and those available in the suburban schools, \nthe quality of their education, as measured by educational outcomes, is significantly less than that of \ntheir suburban neighbors. Put another way, the plaintiffs undertook to persuade the trial court that, \nas a factual matter, all three of these factors—racial and ethnic isolation, concentration of poverty, \nand disparities in educational resources—have caused the quality of their education, as measured \nby the standards articulated by this court in Horton I, to be inferior to that of the surrounding \nsuburban districts. \nThus, it was critical to the plaintiffs' equal educational opportunity claim that they prove the following \nfacts: (1) they are racially and ethnically concentrated—an undisputed fact; (2) they suffer from the \neffects of a concentration of poverty—also undisputed; (3) the educational resources of the Hartford \ndistrict are less than those of the surrounding districts[9]—a disputed fact; 67*67 and (4) the \ncombination of the first three cause lesser educational outcomes in Hartford when compared to the \nsuburban districts—also a disputed fact. One cannot read this record—both the trial court record and \nthe appellate record—any other way. \n\nThus, at a minimum, proof of lesser educational outcomes as a result of racial and ethnic isolation \nwas essential to the plaintiffs' case, because their constitutional theory of deprivation of an equal \neducational opportunity is based on the provisions of article first, § 20, of the state constitution, \nregarding race and ethnicity. In other words, without either race or ethnicity, or both, as a causative \nfactor in lesser educational outcomes, the plaintiffs' case under article first, § 20, would fall, because \nthose are the two protected categories under that article that the plaintiffs invoke as the basis of their \nconstitutional theory.[10] Thus, it was essential for the plaintiffs to establish in the trial court that their \nracial and ethnic isolation, either alone or in combination with the concentration of poverty, caused \ndiminished educational outcomes relative to those of the surrounding communities. \nIt is also clear that the plaintiffs, the defendants and the trial court considered these issues as \nquestions of fact to be established by evidence—both documentary and by way of experts' \nopinions—and not questions of 68*68 law. It is equally clear that these arequestions of fact and not \nof law. Moreover, the plaintiffs, the defendants and the trial court all understood that the plaintiffs \nwere required to prove the existence of a diminished educational opportunity caused by the plaintiffs' \nracial and ethnic isolation, in addition to the more generalized benefits of an integrated educational \nsystem and burdens imposed by a racially and ethnically isolated system. \nIn other words, the plaintiffs never claimed that the general social benefits of racial and ethnic \nintegration and the burdens of racial and ethnic concentration were sufficient to establish the factual \nfoundation of their equal educational opportunity claim. The plaintiffs, the defendants and the trial \ncourt all understood that the plaintiffs were required, in order to come within the reasoning of Horton \nI, to establish the specific facts of diminished educational outcomes, relative to the suburban \ndistricts, as a result of their racial and ethnic and concentration. To corroborate this summary of the \nplaintiffs' claims, I now turn to a discussion of the factual background of this appeal.[11] \nA \nThe Plaintiffs' Claims as Presented to the Trial Court \nThe plaintiffs had presented their claims in a tripartite structure.[12] Before presenting their evidence, \nthe plaintiffs 69*69 made an opening oral argument to the court explaining their claims and relating \nthose claims to the specific counts of their complaint. The plaintiffs specifically drew a sharp \ndistinction between the first and second counts of their complaint. As they explained their case to the \ntrial court, the first count depended solely on the legal claim that the term \"segregation\" in article first, \n§ 20, of the state constitution encompassed de facto as well as de jure segregation, and that no \nevidence or facts regarding the effects of that segregation was necessary to prove the allegations of \nthat count.[13] They explained that the second count was, 70*70 unlike the first count, based on a \ncombination of facts: racial isolation; concentration of poverty; and inadequate educational \nresources; all combining to cause a quality of education inferior to that of the surrounding suburban \ndistricts.[14] \nIn the posttrial proceedings—both by way of their briefs and their oral arguments—the plaintiffs \nreiterated 71*71 that their claim of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity was premised on \na factual inquiry into the actual quality of the education provided to them, relative to that provided to \nthe students of the suburban districts. They repeatedly emphasized that they had proven that their \nracial and ethnic isolation, coupled with their inadequate educational resources and their \nconcentration of poverty, caused the quality of their education to be inferior to that provided to their \nsuburban counterparts.[15] In those proceedings, moreover, they repeatedly contrasted their equal \neducational 72*72 opportunity claim with their claim that de facto segregation was per se \n\nunconstitutional, making clear that the per se segregation claim was not an equal educational \nopportunity claim.[16] \nB \nThe Remand Proceedings in the Trial Court \nUpon our remand, the parties entered into a stipulation of 256 facts. Each side also presented to the \ntrial court those disputed facts that it claimed to have proven. From the plaintiffs' proposed factual \nfindings, it is clear that they sought to persuade the court to find facts that supported their claim that \nthe quality of the education provided the Hartford schoolchildren was inferior to that of the suburban \ndistricts, and that this inferiority was caused by their racial and ethnic isolation combined with the \nconcentration of poverty in the district.[17] The defendants' proposed findings, by \ncontrast, 73*73 reflected their view that the evidence proved that it was the plaintiffs' poverty, and not \ntheir racial and ethnic concentration, that caused the educational deficiencies of which the plaintiffs \ncomplained. \nC \nThe Findings of Fact Regarding Equal \nEducational Opportunity \nThereafter, the trial court issued its \"Finding,\" which constituted its factual determinations \"on the \ndisputed facts disclosed in the proposed findings of fact submitted by the parties....\" These findings \nindicate that the trial court was persuaded by the defendants' factual claims, and not by the those of \nthe plaintiffs. \nMany of the trial court's findings of fact are directly pertinent to the plaintiffs' claim of a deprivation of \nan equal educational opportunity. The trial court found as follows. Historically, racial or ethnic \nminority group membership has been associated with being educationally disadvantaged because \nmembers of those groups have failed to succeed in schools at the same levels as most members of \nthe majority group. The generally poorer academic performance of black and Hispanic youngsters is \nexplained for the most part by the social and economic conditions under which they and their \nfamilies live.[18] \n74*74 The court found further as follows: \"It is poverty and not race that is a principal causal factor in \nlower educational achievement.\" The problems of the Hartford schools are compounded by the fact \nthat minorities in the inner cities are disproportionately poor, and the \"real correlation with academic \nachievement is socioeconomic class rather than race....\" The fact that the students come from poor \nfamilies \"in and of itself is a significant problem in the schools.... The reason that children who live in \npoverty do not do well in statewide academic testing is because they are poor and disadvantaged \nand not because they are an ethnic or racial minority, because poor minority children exhibit the \nsame patterns as those of their poor white counterparts, and poverty is the strongest predictor of \npoor academic achievement.\" Moreover, the concentration of poverty may adversely affect academic \nachievement over and above the effect of family poverty. The socioeconomic status of \nschoolchildren dictates their academic performance. Thus, the improvement in the socioeconomic \nstatus of blacks explains the reduction by almost one half of the achievement gap between black \nand white students nationally between 1970 and 1990. The trial court also specifically found that \n\n\"[v]irtually all of the differences in performance between Hartford students and those in other towns, \nas well as differences in college attendance, can be explained by differences in socioeconomic \nstatus and the background factors that socioeconomic status represents.\" \nThe trial court also found that a higher concentration of students \"at risk\" may affect the achievement \nlevel of students in a particular school district. Thus, given two groups of students equal in all \nrespects except the incidence of students with \"at risk\" factors such as low 75*75 birth weight and \nmothers on drugs at birth, the group with the higher incidence of those \"at risk\" factors will perform \nmore poorly in school than the other group. \nThe trial court further found that the level of achievement that should be attained by the students in a \nparticular district cannot be assessed without considering the conditions that exist in the district that \nhinder academic achievement. Examples of those conditions are: the \"mobility\" of the students, \nnamely, the frequency of their moving from school to school during a school year or from one year to \nthe next; limited English proficiency of certain students; and the students' socioeconomic status. The \ncourt found that, in order to understand the quality or effectiveness of a particular educational \nprogram, it is necessary to separate the disadvantages that students bring to school with them from \nthe effects of the program itself. Moreover, it is necessary to separate the effects of poverty from the \neffects of racial isolation. Based on expert testimony, the court found that there are ways in which \nthe separate effects of racial isolation and poverty can be measured statistically. The plaintiffs' \nexperts did not employ these statistical techniques. \nThe trial court also made certain findings regarding the state mastery test scores. The court found \nthat the scores serve two purposes: (1) to inform districts so that they can improve their programs, \ncorrect deficiencies and plan for the future; and (2) to provide a basis for funding to districts that \nperform below remedial standards. This testing program was not designed for interdistrict \ncomparison, but to provide information about individual students and programs within particular \ndistricts, and to trigger remedial services to students in need of them. Moreover, the trial court found, \nit would be an abuse of the purposes of the testing program to use the scores as the basis for \ncomparing the quality of the education between schools or school systerns. 76*76 The test results \nshould not be seen as primarily caused by racial isolation in the schools because the results could \nbe related to many other factors. Thus, it is inappropriate to use the mastery test data as a basis for \ndrawing conclusions about the quality of education in Hartford without taking into account the effects \nof other important variables, such as socioeconomic status, early environmental deprivations, and \ndiminished motivation to succeed academically. Other variables that contribute to depressed test \nscores of Hartford schoolchildren that must be considered are the number of students with limited \nEnglish proficiency and the extraordinary mobility of the student population. \nThe trial court also found that Hartford students and those in the surrounding towns are scoring at \nthe level to be expected if the dramatic differences between them in poverty levels are taken into \naccount. The disparity in test scores does not indicate that Hartford is doing an inadequate job of \neducating its students or that its schools are failing, because the test scores, based on the relevant \nsocioeconomic factors, are at the approximate projected level when adjustments are made for those \nfactors. Teachers and administrators have no control over where their students live or the conditions \nunder which they live. They are not in a position to remedy the disadvantages that their students \nbring with them when they enter the educational system. Thus, the court found that there are no \neducational strategies or initiatives that can fully deal with the complex social issues that produce \ninequality of performance and undermine education, because hunger, parental neglect, crowded and \nsubstandard housing, and inadequate employment opportunities disproportionately attack minority \nchildren in our state and divert them from educational opportunity. \n\nThis, then, is the factual record upon which this case was presented to and decided by the trial court, \nand 77*77 upon which the appeal came to this court. I turn, next, to this appeal as presented to us by \nthe plaintiffs. \nD \nThe Plaintiffs' Case as Presented to \nThis Court on Appeal \nIn their initial and reply briefs in this court, the plaintiffs made crystal clear that the three \nconstitutional claims that they were presenting to us for our adjudication coincided perfectly with the \nthree claims that they had presented to the trial court. For ease of reference, and more importantly \nfor fidelity to the plaintiffs' own understanding and characterization of their claims, I refer to the three \nclaims as: (1) an equal educational opportunity; (2) per se segregation; and (3) a minimally adequate \neducation. The plaintiffs' briefs make equally clear that the first and third of these claims, namely, an \nequal educational opportunity and a minimally adequate education, are based on factualclaims \nregarding, not only the undisputed facts of the degree of racial and ethnic concentration in the \nHartford schools but, critically and essentially, the plaintiffs' version of the disputed facts regarding \nthe differences in educational outcomes and achievements in the Hartford schools relative to the \nsurrounding suburban school districts, and the causes of those differences. Thus, the plaintiffs' equal \neducational opportunity claim is squarely based on a combination of factual matrixes: the facts that \ndemonstrate the racial and ethnic isolation of the Hartford schools, combined with what the plaintiffs \nclaim to have established in the trial court as the educational deficienciesthat are caused by that \nisolation.[19] \n78*78 The plaintiffs set out the nature of their claims definitively at the very beginning of their \nappellate brief: \"Hartford children attend schools that are the most racially, ethnically, and \neconomically isolated in the state. These schools have the least educational resources and suffer \nfrom the worst academic performance. The cumulative effects of these inequities deprive Hartford's \nchildren of the preparation necessary to join the mainstream of society.\"[20] (Emphasis added.) \nWith this introduction in mind, I turn now to the plaintiffs' own more detailed explication of their claim \nof a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity[21] 79*79 as presented in their two briefs in this \ncourt. This explication is derived directly from, and is identical to, that claim as ultimately presented \nto the trial court for adjudication. The plaintiffs correctly point out that the right to an equal \neducational opportunity was recognized by this court in Horton I. The plaintiffs then accurately pose \nthe question under this claim: \"As a legal matter, this case falls squarely under [Horton I],[22] and the \nquestion before this Court is whether the undisputed condition of racial and economic isolation of the \npublic schools, coupled with the undisputed and extreme disparities in educational resources \nafforded Hartford's schoolchildren, violate plaintiffs' constitutional right to an equal educational \nopportunity.\" (Emphasis added.) \nThe plaintiffs then explain precisely why they maintain that their right to such an opportunity has \nbeen violated. Under the heading, \"The Segregated, Economically Isolated and Unequal Conditions \nin Hartford Metropolitan Area Public Schools Violate Plaintiffs' Right to an Equal Educational \nOpportunity\"; (emphasis added); the plaintiffs, quoting from Horton I, state: \"Equality of educational \nopportunity is ascertained by comparing the quality of education provided in the school districts. \nIn Horton I, this court identified criteria for measuring the quality of education, including: `(a) size of \nclasses; (b) training, experience and background of teaching staff; (c) materials, books and supplies; \n\n(d) school philosophy and objectives; (e) type of local control; (f) test scores as measured against \nability; (g) degree of motivation and application of the students; (h) course offerings and \nextracurricular activities.' Horton I, [supra, 172 Conn. 634].\" \n80*80 With this legal, and appropriate, standard in place for the evaluation of a claim of a deprivation \nof an equal educational opportunity, the plaintiffs then attempt to persuade us that, as demonstrated \nby the evidence presented in the trial court, they should prevail on this claim. They attempt to do so, \nhowever, not by relying on the general harms associated with a racially and ethnically isolated \nschool system or on the general benefits of an integrated school system, but by arguing that the trial \ncourt's adverse factual findings were clearly erroneous.[23] \nIn their reply brief in this court, the plaintiffs reinforce this understanding of the basis of their equal \neducational opportunity claim.[24] The plaintiffs then, in order 81*81 that we not be confused about \ntheir claims, reiterated the three claims that they had presented in this case, and the doctrinal \ndifferences between them. \"First, plaintiffs claim that the extreme levels of racial segregation and the \nconcentration of poor children in the Hartford schools, along with well-documented deficiencies and \ndisparities in educational resources and reflected by the vast gulf in outcomes, violates plaintiffs' \nfundamental right to an equal educational opportunity. Second, plaintiffs claim that the extreme \nlevels of racial segregation in the Hartford area constitute a per se violation of Connecticut's \nconstitution. Third, plaintiffs claim that the conditions in the Hartford schools violate plaintiffs' right to \na minimally adequate education, pursuant to Article Eighth, § 1 and plaintiffs' due process rights.\" \nTo summarize: the plaintiffs' first claim is their claim of a deprivation of equal educational opportunity \nas articulated in Horton I. As a factual matter, this claim rests on a complex factual matrix: the \nundisputed facts regarding the racial and ethnic concentration, and the concentration of poverty, in \nthe Hartford district; the disputed facts regarding the claimed inadequate educational resources in \nthe Hartford district; and the disputed causal effect of that combination of factors on the educational \noutcomes claimed to be prevalent in the Hartford district. \nThe plaintiffs' second claim is based entirely on the legal theory that the term \"segregation\" in article \nfirst, 82*82 § 20, means de facto segregation. As a factual matter, this claim rests on only the \nundisputed facts regarding the racial and ethnic concentration in the Hartford schools, to the \nexclusion of the disputed facts regarding the claimed disparities between the educational resources \nand outcomes of the Hartford school district, on one hand, and the resources and outcomes of the \nsuburban school districts, on the other hand. \nThe plaintiffs' third claim is their claim of a deprivation of a minimally adequate education under \narticle eighth, § 1, of the state constitution as articulated in Horton I. This claim rests on disputed \nfacts regarding certain claimed inadequacies in the Hartford school district. \nHaving summarized the plaintiffs' claims as disclosed by this voluminous record, I will next analyze \nthe majority opinion in light of the record in this case. I turn, therefore, to that task. \nIII \nTHE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS IN THE MAJORITY \nOPINION \nA \n\nThe Majority's Adjudicative Process \nThe first flaw in the majority opinion involves the adjudicative process by which the opinion was \ncreated. As the record demonstrates, the constitutional theory conceived by the majority bears only \na passing resemblance to the claims of the plaintiffs as disclosed by the record. The majority's \ntheory is a combination of the legal theories presented in the plaintiffs' first and second claims, \ncompletely shorn of the facts that the trial court found after six years of litigation. The theory upon \nwhich the majority opinion is based, therefore, is brand new and was never advocated by the \nplaintiffs. \n83*83 The majority asserts, nonetheless, that \"[t]he constitutional implications raised by these \nallegations were fully argued before the trial court, and were fully briefed by the parties before this \ncourt.\"[25] This is like saying that water is the same thing as hydrogen and oxygen because water is \nthe result when the two gases are combined in a certain proportion. \nThe majority's theory of a lack of an equal educational opportunity is a hybrid of two disparate parts \nof the plaintiffs' case, as argued to and litigated in the trial court and as argued and briefed in this \ncourt. One part of the hybrid is the legal theory of the plaintiffs' first claim, namely, that under Horton \nI, they have been deprived of an equal educational opportunity, but without the factual matrix that the \nplaintiffs themselves presented to support that theory. The second part of the hybrid is the theory of \nthe plaintiffs' second claim, namely, that \"segregation\" in article first, § 20, means de facto as well as \nde jure segregation when applied to education. That theory, however, does not constitute an equal \neducational opportunity claim, as understood and presented by the plaintiffs throughout this case, \nas 84*84 understood and responded to by the defendants throughout this case, and as briefed and \nargued in this court. \nMoreover, I confess that, having read the briefs carefully and having participated in the oral \nargument with great concentration, the majority's theory of a deprivation of an equal educational \nopportunity was a complete surprise to me. I can only wonder about the reaction of the defendants, \nwho for the past six years have been defending this case on the basis that the record demonstrates, \nrather than the basis on which the majority has decided the case. In fact, I suspect that even the \nplaintiffs are surprised that they have prevailed on a theory of a deprivation of an equal educational \nopportunity that they did not present, and that renders wholly immaterial the entire factual matrix that \nthey did present, appropriately albeit unsuccessfully, under that doctrine as articulated in Horton I. \nThe newness of the majority's constitutional theory is not only demonstrated by comparing the \nrecord to the majority opinion, it is demonstrated by certain language in the majority opinion itself. \nWhen the majority asks, at the beginning of its analysis, whether \"the plaintiffs' complaint \nencompass[es] [the constituent elements of the affirmative constitutional mandate to provide all \npublic schoolchildren with a substantially equal educational opportunity]\", it asks a question that no \none else has ever asked us to answer, namely, whether the plaintiffs' complaint is legally \nsufficient.[26] In elaborating on that question, moreover, the majority's language is curiously but \nrevealingly qualified: it refers to the plaintiffs' claim \"as we have defined it.\" This question and \nqualification are necessitated solely by 85*85 the fact that the majority's, rather than the plaintiffs', \ntheory of the equal educational opportunity claim has now become dispositive, and that this theory \nwas never in this case until the majority issued its opinion. \nAlthough prior to trial the defendants challenged the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs' complaint, they \nlost that challenge and, except for the arguments regarding justiciability and state action, did not \nrenew it on appeal. Moreover, at no time in this appeal was the question raised of whether the \nplaintiffs' pleadings stated a cognizable claim. At no time in this appeal was the question raised \n\nwhether the plaintiffs' pleadings could be read to support their constitutional challenge. The sole \nreason that these questions and these qualifications became necessary is that the majority has \nrecast the essential nature of the plaintiffs' complaint, as presented by the plaintiffs at trial and on \nappeal, in order to fit the majority's predetermined outcome. \nThis method of adjudication is fundamentally flawed for several reasons that call into question the \nintegrity of the majority decision. First, it is egregiously unfair to the defendants. Having defended \nthis case for six years in the trial court, and having responded to the plaintiffs' appeal on the legal \nand factual bases presented by the plaintiffs, the defendants have not had the opportunity to \nrespond to the new theory of equal educational opportunity fashioned by the majority either by \nevidence or argument in the trial court, or by briefs and oral argument in this court. Indeed, we will all \nhave to wonder what evidence or arguments the defendants would have produced in the trial court \nand this court had they known that this hybrid theory was the basis of the equal educational \nopportunity claim to which they were required to respond.[27] \n86*86 Second, the majority's treatment of the plaintiffs' pleadings in this case turns our traditional \ntreatment of pleadings on its head, and adds to the unfairness to the defendants. It is true that, \nunder our modern jurisprudence, we read pleadings \"broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly \nand technically.... Beaudoin v. Town Oil Co., 207 Conn. 575, 587-88, 542 A.2d 1124 \n(1988); Fuessenich v. DiNardo, 195 Conn. 144, 150-51, 487 A.2d 514 (1985). As long as the pleadings \nprovide sufficient notice of the facts claimed and the issues to be tried and do not surprise or \nprejudice the opposing party, we will not conclude that the complaint is insufficient to allow \nrecovery.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. v. Connecticut National \nBank,230 Conn. 486, 496, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994). \nThe application of that principle cannot, however, save what the majority has done here. That \nprinciple generally applies before trial to the construction of a complaint when it is challenged for \nlegal sufficiency; see, e.g., D'Ulisse-Cupo v. Board of Directors of Notre Dame High School, 202 Conn. \n206, 220-21, 520 A.2d 217 (1987); during trial, to a determination of whether certain evidence should \nbe admitted as within, or excluded as beyond, the fair boundaries of the complaint; see, \ne.g., Farrell v. St. Vincent's Hospital,203 Conn. 554, 557-58, 525 A.2d 954 (1987); and posttrial, where the \nparties have in fact litigated the case in a posture that includes the challenged theory, and there has \nbeen no prejudice or surprise. See, e.g., Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. v. Connecticut National \nBank, supra, 230 Conn. 497-98. The principle does not apply in this case, however, where the majority \nhas, after the trial and after appellate briefs and arguments, altered the theory of the complaint on \nwhich all of the parties 87*87 have relied, and then, without notice to anyone, has determined that \nthe complaint supports the altered theory. That process violates the fundamental principle that \"the \npleadings provide sufficient notice of the facts claimed and the issues to be tried and do not surprise \nor prejudice the opposing party....\" Id., 496. \nThe third flaw in the process by which the majority reached its decision is that, having decided to \nconsider a new theory of the case, the court has not afforded the parties the opportunity to file \nsupplemental briefs or to present further oral argument. In recent years, we have engaged in the \npractice of requesting supplemental briefs when, after oral argument, we have determined that the \nparties have not sufficiently addressed an issue or potentially dispositive theory of the case that \nsurfaced either in the oral argument or in the process of our deliberations. See, \ne.g., State v. Troupe, 237 Conn. 284, 286-87 n.4, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (continued viability of constancy of \naccusation doctrine); Williams v. Best Cleaners, Inc., 235 Conn. 778, 784, 670 A.2d 294 (1996)(definition \nof disability under General Statutes § 31-349), superseded, 237 Conn. 490, 677 A.2d 1356 \n(1996); Jackson v. Commissioner of Correction, 227 Conn. 124, 130, 629 A.2d 413 (1993) (appropriate \nstandard in habeas proceeding by which to determine effect of prior failure to raise constitutional \nclaim); State v. Oquendo, 223 Conn. 635, 657, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992) (whether denial of motion to \n\nsuppress can be sustained under abandonment doctrine). Indeed, we have reversed the Appellate \nCourt for disposing of an appeal on the basis of a plain error analysis that neither party had raised, \nwithout first giving the parties the opportunity to brief the perceived plain error claim. See, e.g., Lynch \nv. Granby Holdings, Inc., 230 Conn. 95, 98-99, 644 A.2d 325 (1994). \nThere are two reasons for this postargument appellate procedure: (1) fairness to the parties \nsuggests that they be confronted with a potentially dispositive theory 88*88 that they had not had the \nprior opportunity to discuss; and (2) we are more likely to be correct in our judgments if they follow \nadequate briefing. I acknowledge that we have not uniformly followed this procedure, and that there \nis no rule that requires that we do so. Indeed, there are cases in which, for various reasons, it is \nappropriate that we not do so. \nThis case, however, is the paradigm of when supplemental briefing and argument would have been \nappropriate. This case may be the most significant ruling of this court in this century. I can think of no \nother case decided by this court that will have more impact on the daily lives of our citizenry than this \ncase. Having ordered supplemental briefing and argument in cases involving issues of the continued \nviability of an evidentiary doctrine, the proper construction of second injury fund terminology, \npreservation of an issue for habeas review and the relevance of abandonment to the reasonable \nexpectation of privacy, we should have done so in this case, the enormous public importance of \nwhich demands the highest degree of both fairness to the parties and confidence in the correctness \nof the outcome. \nThe use of that prudent appellate procedure would have been particularly appropriate in this case. In \na case in which we exercise the judicial power to interpret a statute or explicate the common law, if \nwe are incorrect, the General Assembly is free to enact legislation correcting our error. In a case \nsuch as this, however, in which this court incorrectly interprets our constitution, the only remedy of \nthe people is the painful process of constitutional amendment. \nAlthough, in my view, these flaws in the majority's process of decision-making seriously undermine \nthe integrity of its opinion, the more fundamental question is whether, nonetheless, the reasoning of \nthe majority 89*89 opinion is sound. It is not. I turn next, therefore, to the substantive flaws in the \nmajority opinion. \nB \nThe Misapplication of Horton I \nThe first substantive flaw in the majority opinion is that it misapplies the principal precedent upon \nwhich the plaintiffs' equal educational opportunity claim is based, namely, Horton I. It does so by \ndisregarding the factual underpinning of Horton I, thereby rendering irrelevant the critical factual \ndifferences between this case and Horton I. Thus, the majority demonstrates its lack of fidelity \nto Horton I by severing the plaintiffs' claim from its jurisprudential roots and by shedding its essential \nfactual underpinnings. \nIn Horton I, this court held that the education clause; article eighth, § 1; and the equal protection \nclauses; article first, §§ 1 and 20; require \"that the state provide a substantially equal educational \nopportunity to its youth in its free public elementary and secondary schools.\" Horton I, supra, 172 \nConn. 649; see also Horton v. Meskill, 195 Conn. 24, 34-35, 486 A.2d 1099 (1985) (Horton \nIII) (characterizing Horton I as resting on article eighth, § 1, and article first, §§ 1 and 20). We also \nheld that the system of funding public education then prevailing, under which each town raised its \nown funds for education via property taxes, supplemented by a flat grant from the state according to \n\nthe average daily number of students attending school in the town; Horton I, supra, 628; violated that \nrequirement. Id., 648-49. \nThese conclusions rested on two sets of factual findings of the trial court in that case, which we \ndetermined were supported by the evidence. Id., 649. The first set of findings was that the existing \nsystem of school financing resulted in significant disparities between the amounts spent on \neducation by property-rich towns and the 90*90 amounts spent by property-poor towns. Id., 633. The \ncourt stated: \"[T]he present system of financing education in Connecticut ensures that, regardless of \nthe educational needs or wants of children, more educational dollars will be allotted to children who \nlive in property-rich towns than to children who live in property-poor towns.\" Id. \nThe second set of findings concerned the effect of these financial disparities on the children. That \nset of findings established that the per pupil spending disparities resulted in a lower quality of \neducation in the property-poor towns than in the property-rich towns. Id. The court stated: \"The \ncriteria for evaluating the `quality of education' in a town include the following: (a) size of classes; (b) \ntraining, experience and background of teaching staff; (c) materials, books and supplies; (d) school \nphilosophy and objectives; (e) type of local control; (f) test scores as measured against ability; (g) \ndegree of motivation and application of the students; (h) course offerings and extracurricular \nactivities. In most cases, the optimal version of these criteria is achieved by higher per pupil \noperating expenditures, and because many of the elements of a quality education require higher per \npupil operating expenditures, there is a direct relationship between per pupil school expenditures \nand the breadth and quality of educational programs.\" Id., 634-35.[28] All of these factual assertions \nby this court were based on the factual findings of the trial 91*91 court in Horton I, findings that had \nbeen vigorously contested by the state.[29] \nThe critical difference between Horton I and this case involves that second set of factual findings. \nIn 92*92 Horton I, the trial court found that, because of—in a cause and effect sense—the disparities \nin educational funding between the property-poor towns and the property-rich towns, the quality of \nthe educational opportunity available to students in the property-poor towns was not substantially \nequal to the quality of the educational opportunity available to students in the property-rich towns. \nId., 637-38. In Horton I, the plaintiffs undertook to prove that factual assertion, the trial court found \nthat they had proven it, and this court sustained the trial court's finding as supported by the \nevidence. Id., 648-49. Based on that finding, we concluded that the state's flat grant system of \nfunding education violated the plaintiffs' constitutional right to a substantially equal educational \nopportunity. Id., 649-50. \nIn this case, the plaintiffs' equal educational opportunity claim precisely parallels the plaintiffs' claim \nin Horton I. In this case, the plaintiffs claim that, because of—in a cause and effect sense—their \nracial and ethnic isolation, coupled with the concentration of poverty and lack of material resources \nin Hartford, the quality of the educational opportunity available to them, measured by the same \nstandards articulated by this court in Horton I, was not substantially equal to the quality of \neducational opportunity available to their suburban counterparts.[30] Put another way, the plaintiffs \nclaim that 93*93 their racial and ethnic isolation and the concentration of poverty in the \ncity causes the quality of their education to be inferior, as measured by the Horton I standards, than \nthat provided in the suburbs. As in Horton I, the plaintiffs undertook to prove that factual assertion in \nthe trial court. Unlike Horton I, however, in this case, the plaintiffs failed to persuade the trial court of \nthat factual assertion. \nIn this case, the trial court found that, contrary to the factual assertions of the plaintiffs, it is poverty, \nand not race or ethnicity, that accounts for any discrepancies between the quality of education \nprovided to the plaintiffs and the quality of education provided to their suburban counterparts. In \naddition, the trial court found that the principal standard of measure that the plaintiffs sought to use \n\nto demonstrate that difference in quality of education, the statewide mastery test scores, is not a \nvalid tool for measuring interdistrict differences in the quality of education. As I indicate later in this \ndissent, the trial court's factual findings are fully supported by the evidence. Thus, the analogues in \nthis case to the factual underpinnings that supported our conclusion in Horton I are not only missing \nhere; the factual analogues in this case are squarely contrary to the conclusion reached by the \nmajority.[31] \nConsequently, the majority's reliance on Horton I is unfounded. In Horton I, we did not conclude that \nthe plaintiffs had been deprived of an equal educational opportunity solely because of the disparities \nin educational funding between property-poor and property-rich 94*94 towns, unconnected to the \neducational effects of those disparities. The majority concludes, however, that the plaintiffs have \nbeen so deprived solely because of their racial and ethnic isolation. The majority reaches that \nconclusion, however, not only unconnected to but squarely contrary to those factual findings. Thus, \nthe majority's analysis is contrary to the analysis that we employed in Horton I. \nIndeed, the only attempt by the majority to link the facts of this case to Horton I occurs when the \nmajority states: \"As we observed, however, in Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 645,educational equalization \ncases are in significant aspects sui generis and not subject to analysis by accepted conventional \ntests or the application of mechanical standards. The wealth discrimination found among school \ndistricts differs materially from the usual equal protection case where a fairly defined indigent class \nsuffers discrimination to its peculiar disadvantage. The discrimination is relative rather than absolute. \nSee also Horton III,supra, 195 Conn. 35. Nothing in the description of the relevant legal landscape in \nany of our cases suggests that the constitutional right that we articulated in Horton I was limited to \nschool financing.\"[32] (Internal quotation marks omitted.) \nThe first part of this brief analysis is nothing more than a truism. The second part merely sets up the \nproverbial straw man. \nNo one disputes that educational equalization cases, whether based on claims of funding or race, \nare sui 95*95 generis. That truism is, however, the beginning of the inquiry, not the end. \nAlthough the constitutional right articulated in Horton I may not have been limited to school financing, \nthere was a factual basis in that case that is lacking here. Moreover, the argument that Horton I is \nlimited to school financing is but one of several arguments offered by the defendants.[33] They also \nargue that, assuming that Horton I is appropriately extended to race and ethnicity, the plaintiffs have \nfailed to prove that they are deprived of an equal educational opportunity by reason of race or \nethnicity because the factual findings of the trial court are to the contrary and are supported by the \nevidence. By pretending that the defendants' only response to the extension of Horton Ito race and \nethnicity is that Horton I is confined to financing, the majority dismantles the straw man, answering \nthe easy question posed by this appeal and ignoring the difficult ones. \nC \nThe Meaning of \"Segregation\" in Article First, § 20 \nThe next substantive flaw in the majority opinion is the meaning that the majority attributes to the \nterm \"segregation\" in article first, § 20. The majority somehow concludes that \"segregation\" means \nde facto, as well as de jure, segregation, on the basis of the text of article first, § 20, and the history \nin the 1965 constitutional convention of the adoption of article eighth, § 1, 96*96 and article first, § \n20.[34] The text provides no support for the majority's conclusion, and the history of the 1965 \nconvention squarely contradicts it. \n\n1 \nThe Text of Article First, § 20 \nThe constitution of Connecticut, article first, § 20, as amended by articles fifth and twenty-first of the \namendments, provides: \"No person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected \nto segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights \nbecause of religion, race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability.\"[35] It is \naxiomatic that we are limited in constitutional adjudication by the text of the particular constitutional \nprovision at issue. Moore v. Ganim, 233 Conn. 557, 581, 660 A.2d 742 (1995); State v. Miller, 227 Conn. \n363, 380-81, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993); Cologne v. Westfarms Associates, 192 Conn. 48, 77-78, 469 A.2d 1201 \n(1984). That text does not support the majority's reading of it. \nCritical to the majority's analysis is its conclusion that the phrase \"because of and the term \n\"segregation\" do not require a showing of an intent by the state to segregate or discriminate when \nthose terms are applied to the right to public education guaranteed under article eighth, § 1. Thus, \nthe major, albeit unstated, premise of the majority opinion is that, although \"because of and \n\"segregation\" may require a showing of an intent by the state to segregate when applied to all other \n\"civil 97*97 or political rights\" covered by article first, § 20, that same language does not require such \nan intent when applied to public education under article eighth, § 1. \nIt is true that the majority does not explicitly say that the terms, \"segregation\" and \"because of,\" do \nrequire a state intent to segregate when applied to other rights guaranteed by article first, § 20. \nInstead, the majority states: \"Whatever this language may portend in other contexts, we are \npersuaded that, in the context of public education, in which the state has an affirmative obligation to \nmonitor and equalize educational opportunity, the state's awareness of existing and increasing \nsevere racial and ethnic isolation imposes upon the state the responsibility to remedy `segregation ... \nbecause of race [or] ... ancestry ....'\" \nDespite the majority's futile attempt to avoid the necessary implications of its rationale, it is clear that \none such necessary implication is that the language at issue either does or does not require a \nsegregative intent when applied in other contexts. Thus, I can read this passage from the majority \nopinion in only two possible ways: (1) \"because of and \"segregation\" do not require a state intent to \nsegregate, irrespective of the particular legal context; or (2) \"because of and \"segregation\" do \nrequire a state intent to segregate when applied to other legal contexts, but not when applied to \npublic education. \nThe majority cannot mean that these terms do not require such an intent irrespective of the legal \ncontext. That would necessarily mean that, with respect to the exercise of all civil and political rights, \nthe state would be required to take affirmative steps to assure that these rights are not exercised by \nracially or ethnically concentrated groups, regardless of any state intent to segregate. This would \nmean, in turn, that any electoral district that is religiously, racially or ethnically concentrated \nis 98*98 unconstitutional and has been such since 1965, and that such was the intent of the \ndelegates to that convention. It would also mean that presently existing public housing projects in \nHartford and other cities whose tenants are racially or ethnically concentrated, not by design but as a \nresult of demographic and economic factors over which the state has no control, are unconstitutional \nand have been such because the 1965 convention delegates meant them to be. It is not hyperbole \nto say that the delegates would be astonished to have such an intent attributed to them. Nor is it \nhyperbole to say that such an interpretation would be so bizarre and unworkable as to be ludicrous. \n\nAlthough I disagree with the majority, I am not willing to attribute that meaning to it. It must be, \ntherefore, that the majority means to say that, although segregative intent is required when \"because \nof and \"segregation\" are applied to other civil and political rights, it is not required when applied to \npublic education. This, of course also necessarily means that the same language has opposite \nmeanings when applied to different rights—an interpretation that, in my view, is also utterly \nimplausible. Under the majority's view, therefore, the phrase \"because of and the term \"segregation\" \nhave one meaning when applied to public elementary and secondary education, namely, that racial \nconcentration need not be intentional on the part of the state, and the opposite meaning when \napplied to all other political and civil rights, namely, that racial concentration must be intentional. \nThis tortures the text of article first, § 20, and turns the process of constitutional adjudication upside \ndown. I acknowledge that it is an accepted, necessary and appropriate part of the judicial process to \nstretch the meaning of language in order to render a statutory scheme constitutional. See, \ne.g., State v. Indrisano, 228 Conn. 795, 805, 640 A.2d 986 (1994); Ambroise v. William 99*99 Raveis Real \nEstate, Inc., 226 Conn. 757, 764, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993); McConnell v. Beverly Enterprises-Connecticut, \nInc.,209 Conn. 692, 705, 553 A.2d 596 (1989). That does not justify, however, as the majority would \nhave it, breaking constitutional language in two so that the same words in the same sentence have \ntwo opposite meanings when applied to different sets of rights, in order to render a statutory scheme \nunconstitutional. \nIn my view, this position is untenable. First, there is nothing in the language, history or purpose of \narticle first, § 20, to support such a bizarre interpretation. We do not ordinarily read the same word or \nphrase in the same sentence to have opposite meanings depending on the subject matter to which \nthe word or phrase is applied. See Weinberg v. ARA Vending Co., 223 Conn. 336, 343, 612 A.2d 1203 \n(1992); Board of Education v. State Board of Labor Relations, 217 Conn. 110, 116, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991). \nThere is no reason to do so here. Article first, § 20, was not drafted or approved by Lewis Carroll, \nwhose character in Through the Looking-Glass, Humpty Dumpty, said, \"when I use a word ... it \nmeans just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.\" L. Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass \n(Messner Ed. 1982) p. 198. If the phrase \"because of and the term \"segregation\" mean that there is \nno intent requirement in the context of public education, but that there is such a requirement in the \ncontext of all other political and civil rights, it is only because the majority, like Humpty Dumpty, says \nso. \nSecond, the majority's rationale for saying so in this instance, namely, that the state has an \nobligation to monitor and equalize educational opportunity, both assumes the answer to the question \nposed by this case and proves too much. It assumes the answer because the question \nis whether the obligation to \"equalize\" extends to racial and ethnic concentration not \nintended 100*100 by the state. It proves too much because the state also has a constitutional \nobligation to monitor and equalize the electoral districts of the General Assembly. See Conn. Const., \nart. III, §§ 5 and 6.[36] Certainly, the right to vote, and to have one's vote given its appropriate \nconstitutional weight, is at least as fundamental under our constitution as the right to a public \neducation. See Conn. Const., art. VI, § 1. Therefore, because the right to vote is, like the right to \nattend a free public elementary and secondary school, a fundamental right that the state has a \ncontinuing obligation to monitor and equalize, under the majority's rationale every general assembly \ndistrict that is not racially, ethnically and religiously integrated is now unconstitutional. It is impossible \nrationally to conclude that the language adopted in 101*101 the 1965 convention was intended to \nhave this result. In short, the language of article first, § 20, simply cannot be cabined as the majority \nseeks to do. \nMoreover, the term \"segregation\" cannot, the suggestion of the majority to the contrary \nnotwithstanding,[37] be read to mean something different from \"discrimination\" in the context of article \nfirst, § 20. The nouns in this one sentence provision should not be read as having meanings that are \n\nmutually exclusive of, and unrelated to, the meanings of the other nouns that surround them. \nConsequently, the majority's reliance on the general interpretive guideline that ordinarily no word or \nphrase is to be regarded as superfluous is misplaced in this context. This broad, constitutional equal \nprotection provision was not intended to be interpreted as if it were the Uniform Commercial Code, \nwith each term having a neatly compartmentalized definition. Within the bounds of the language \nused, the terms are to be read as taking their meaning from and sharing their meaning with each \nother, under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis. \nThis approach to article first, § 20, is consistent with our precedents, which have generally treated \nboth article first, § 1, and article first, § 20, as expressing the same principle, namely, equal \nprotection of the law. See, e.g., Broadley v. Board of Education,229 Conn. 1, 8-10, 639 A.2d 502 \n(1994); Mario v. Fairfield, 217 Conn. 164, 173-77, 585 A.2d 87 (1991); Zapata v. Burns, 207 Conn. 496, 504-\n505, 542 A.2d 700 (1988); Carofano v. Bridgeport, 196 Conn. 623, 638-39, 495 A.2d 1011 \n(1985); Lyman v. Adorno,133 Conn. 511, 515, 52 A.2d 102*102 702 (1947); New Haven Metal & Heating \nSupply Co. v.Danaher, 128 Conn. 213, 219, 21 A.2d 383 (1941). The majority's interpretive method of \ninsisting that \"segregation\" must include de facto segregation because otherwise it would be \nsuperfluous, is inconsistent with the general approach of these precedents. By that reasoning, article \nfirst, § 1, and article first, § 20, themselves must also have meanings independent of each other, \notherwise one would be superfluous. We have never read these constitutional provisions in that \nfashion, and there is no justification for doing so now. \nThus, the reference in article first, § 20, to both \"equal protection of the law\" and \"segregation\" does \nnot suggest that \"segregation\" has some broader meaning than \"equal protection of the law.\" They \nboth express the same principle, as does the word \"discrimination,\" and the fact that the framers of \nthis provision used, and the electorate approved, the term \"segregation\" does not support the \nconclusion that it was intended to include de facto, as opposed to de jure, racial and ethnic isolation. \nWhen interpreting a constitution, \"`the intent to be arrived at is that of the people [who ratified it], and \nit is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words \nemployed, but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common \nunderstanding, and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be \nconveyed.'\" Cologne v. Westfarms Associates, supra, 192 Conn. 78. \nSimilarly, the reference to \"the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights\" further \nindicates that article first, § 20, is not meant to be read with the kind of categorical nicety that the \nmajority employs. This phrase refers to a generally broad, inclusive category of rights, the particulars \nof which will have to be explicated on a case-by-case basis. The textual point is that there is no \nobvious, sharp distinction that leaps to 103*103mind when considering whether rights are \"civil\" or \n\"political\" or both. \nThe appropriateness of this textual approach is further demonstrated by the references to \"religion, \nrace, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability.\" Although arguably the \nreference to \"religion\" can be read to mean something different from the other listed categories, it \ncannot be disputed that the categories of race, color, ancestry and national origin blend into one \nanother.[38] \nMoreover, the use of the phrase \"because of,\" followed by the list of protected categories, strongly \nsuggests a requirement of state intent to segregate or discriminate, or intentionally to maintain such \nsegregation. This reading of the phrase would be consistent with our precedents that, except where \nour text clearly departs from that of the federal equal protection clause, the two clauses have the \nsame meaning and limitations. See, e.g., State v. Leary, 217 Conn. 404, 409, 587 A.2d 85 \n(1991); Ecker v. West Hartford, 205 Conn. 219, 237, 530 A.2d 1056 (1987); Daily v. New Britain Machine \nCo., 200 Conn. 562, 577, 512 A.2d 893 (1986). \n\nUnder federal precedent, only state created or intentionally maintained racial segregation is \nunconstitutional, and the state is not constitutionally obligated to remedy interdistrict racial division \nthat is caused 104*104 primarily by economic and geographical factors. Keyes v. School District No. \n1, 413 U.S. 189, 198, 93 S. Ct. 2686, 37 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1973); Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, 443 \nU.S. 449, 464, 99 S. Ct. 2941, 61 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1979); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 744-45, 94 S. Ct. \n3112, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (1974). Indeed, the majority's analysis implicitly concedes that \"because of \ncarries a requirement of intentionality when applied to all civil and political rights except the right to \nfree public elementary and secondary schools. \nFurthermore, that \"segregation,\" as used in article first, § 20, does not include de facto racial and \nethnic concentration is demonstrated by simply reading the text as the simple sentence that it is, \nshorn of the majority's fiction that the words have opposite meanings when applied to public \neducation and all other rights. This constitutional provision is not an education provision. It does not \nmention education specifically at all. This provision relates to education because the right to attend a \npublic school comes within the phrase \"in the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political \nrights.\"[39] \nIf, as the majority concludes, \"segregation\" includes racial and ethnic concentration resulting, not \nfrom intentional state conduct but from demographic factors over which the state has no control, and \nif we are not willing to indulge in the fiction that the same words, used in the same sentence, \nnonetheless have opposite meanings when applied to different rights, then other areas of public life \nthat are covered by the phrase \"in the exercise of ... political or civil rights\" must also be subject to \nthe same proscription. Thus, for example, a local electoral district that, by virtue of the \nreligious, 105*105 racial or ethnic make-up of its constituents, is heavily Roman Catholic, African-\nAmerican, Puerto Rican or Polish-American, is \"segregated\" under the majority's understanding of \nthat term, and all voters within that district are being \"segregat[ed] or discriminat[ed] in the exercise \nor enjoyment of [their] civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry or national \norigin,\" in violation of article first, § 20. In short, under the majority's reading of \"segregation,\" the \n1965 constitutional amendments rendered all such electoral districts unconstitutional. It is not only \nimplausible that this is what the language used in 1965 was intended to mean, it is impossible \nrationally to reach such a conclusion. \n2 \nThe Record of the 1965 Constitutional Convention \nThe history of the term \"segregation\" in article first, § 20, in the 1965 convention makes even clearer \nthan its text that the members of the convention did not intend it to mean de facto racial or ethnic \nconcentration. It is inconceivable—except that the majority conceives it—and it is untenable to \nhold—except that the majority holds it—that the delegates to the 1965 constitutional convention \nintended the term \"segregation\" in that article to include de facto racial and ethnic concentration in \nthe public schools irrespective of any state intent to bring about or to perpetuate such concentration. \nThis question is not even close. \nI begin this part of my analysis with another factual finding of the trial court that the majority ignores. \nThe trial court found that \"the 1965 constitutional convention was a very conservative body that \nmade only those changes that had to be made in order to comply with the legislative \nreapportionment mandates of the federal courts and it was extremely reluctant to change \nanything 106*106 that did not have to be changed.\"[40] Thus, the 1965 convention was not called for \nthe purpose of a general overhaul of the 1818 constitution. It was called primarily for the purpose of \nbringing the Connecticut constitution into compliance with the then recently decided cases \n\nof Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 713, 84 S. Ct. 1472, 12 L. Ed. 2d 632 \n(1964), Reynoldsv. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1964), Wesberry v. Sanders,376 U.S. \n1, 84 S. Ct. 526, 11 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1964), and Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 83 S. Ct. 801, 9 L. Ed. 2d 821 \n(1963), and the delegates acted accordingly. The principal agenda of a constitutional convention is a \nuseful tool in construing its actions. See E. Peters, \"State Constitutional Law: Federalism in the \nCommon Law Tradition,\" 84 Mich. L. Rev. 583, 586 (1986) (\"courts must look to the agenda of the \nconstitution as a whole in the context of the historical and sociological issues that occupied center \nstage at the time of ratification\"). \nOne cannot square this unchallenged characterization of the 1965 convention with the notion that, \nwhen in the course of accomplishing its principal objective of legislative apportionment it also \nadopted article first, § 20, this \"very conservative\" convention also intended to accomplish results \nthat would at that time have rendered unconstitutional—or, at the very least, would have called into \nserious constitutional question—many school districts and general assembly districts in the state. \nYet, despite what the majority may say, these are the necessary implications of its decision and \nrationale. \nIn attempting to divine the intent of the framers of article first, § 20, we are not faced with the difficult \ntask of peering back through the mists of more than a 107*107 century to a sparse historical record, \nin order to determine the intent of persons of whom we have limited knowledge, as is often the case \nwhen we attempt to interpret the language used in the 1818 state constitution. The 1965 convention \ntook place but thirty-one years ago. The names and careers of the delegates are well known to \nanyone reasonably cognizant of Connecticut government and politics and there is a complete printed \nrecord. \nAmong the delegates were former and future governors of this state,[41] former and future United \nStates Senators and Representatives,[42] former and future state legislators,[43] former members of \nthis court, including two former chief justices,[44] and many other delegates with distinguished \npedigrees in government and politics. These were men and women with long and distinguished \ncareers in public life, who had practiced the arts of government and politics and who, presumably, \nknew the limits of both. They also knew that their effort would be placed before the electorate in \norder for the constitution to be amended. They knew, furthermore, that throughout Connecticut there \nwere local, intradistrict neighborhood school boundaries and schools that were, because of the \nhousing patterns then prevalent, heavily concentrated by religion, race and ethnic background. They \nknew, moreover, that, because of housing patterns, there would be local general assembly districts \nthroughout Connecticut, created by the General Assembly in accordance with the constitutionally \nrequired reapportionment provisions that they were 108*108 fashioning, that would also be heavily \nconcentrated by the same factors. \nIt is simply inconceivable that the convention delegates, with that knowledge, intended by the \nlanguage they used in article first, § 20, to render unconstitutional or to call into serious constitutional \nquestion, every one of those school boundaries, schools and electoral districts. In order to reach \nsuch a conclusion, one must posit the following line of hypothetical reasoning, or something similar, \nto the delegates regarding the meaning of \"segregation\": (1) \"because of and \"segregation\" mean \nintentional or de jure, rather than de facto, segregation, because otherwise the General Assembly \nwould be prevented from drawing mathematically equal but religiously, racially or ethnically \nconcentrated districts; and, although districts must now be substantially equal in population, it would \nbe a radical change also to require them to be integrated on the basis of religion, race and ethnicity, \na change far beyond the principal charge in this convention;[45] (2) in fact, intentional segregation is \nprobably what the United States Supreme Court was addressing in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 \nU.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954), when it outlawed the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, \nalthough that is not absolutely clear from the available federal decisions to date; (3) nonetheless, \n\nwhen the words \"because of and \"segregation\" come to be applied to interdistrict, but maybe not \nintradistrict, elementary and secondary school lines under the right to a free public education—\nwhich, by the way, will not be adopted until five days from now and, of course, has never been \ninterpreted—those words mean the opposite, 109*109 namely, de facto segregation; and (4) we \nentertain this dual intent without (a) clearly—or even unclearly—suggesting it by the language we \nuse, and (b) disclosing it on the record of this convention or to the voters who will have to ratify our \nwork. This scenario, I suggest, does no more than dramatize the reasoning behind the majority's \ntortuous and selective reading of the record of the 1965 convention. In my view, to attribute such a \nthought process to the delegates is not only implausible, it would have been irresponsible on the part \nof the delegates to have engaged in such a process sub rosa, and it is untenable to suggest that \nthey did. \nMy view of the intent of the convention delegates is buttressed by the fact that, as even the plaintiffs \nemphasized in their posttrial brief to the trial court and in their appellate brief to this court, \"[t]he \ndocumentation of racial and economic isolation in Connecticut schools in the 1960s was thorough \nand comprehensive. In addition to the state's own official annual documentation, the University of \nConnecticut Institute of Urban Research and the University's Educational Resources and \nDevelopment Center conducted a series of highly detailed reports on school segregation in \nConnecticut's major cities.\" In constitutionalizing the right of Connecticut's children to a free public \neducation, however, the politically seasoned delegates to the 1965 convention uttered not one word \neven suggesting that this well documented problem would be addressed by the constitutional \namendments that they had gathered to draft. In fact, the idea that the new education clause would \ncreate any sort of fundamental change in the state's education system was squarely rejected by \nSimon Bernstein, a delegate whom the majority ironically cites in support of its result. In reference to \nthe proposed education clause, Bernstein stated, \"[T]his again is not anything revolutionary, it is \nsomething 110*110 which we have....\" 3 Proceedings of the Connecticut Constitutional Convention of \n1965, p. 1039. \nMoreover, just one year before the convention, the New Haven board of education had adopted a \njunior high school pairing plan for the purpose of reducing unintended racial imbalance in its school \nsystem and in the interest of promoting equality of educational opportunity. That plan, which \ngenerated considerable public controversy, was the subject of several public hearings at which it \nwas vigorously defended and assailed, and resulted in an action for an injunction against the \nplan.[46] On July 8, 1965, while the convention was in session, the Superior Court decided in favor of \nthe board. See Guidav. Board of Education, 26 Conn. Sup. 121, 213 A.2d 843 (1965). \nThere can be little doubt that, if the delegates intended the word \"segregation\" in article first, § 20, to \nmean de facto segregation when applied to public education, the statutory authority that the Superior \nCourt concluded the board had in Guida would have been transformed into a constitutional \nobligation. It is fair to presume that the delegates who came from the 111*111 New Haven \narea,[47] men and women cognizant of the public affairs of their district, were aware of this \ncontroversial case, which was decided only two months earlier. Indeed, one of those delegates, \nformer Chief Justice Patrick B. O'Sullivan, was one of the drafters of article first, and the chairman of \nthe convention that adopted it, and another, Mary B. Griswold, spoke in favor of it. I cannot believe \nthat, if it were the intent of the convention in adopting the word \"segregation\" to constitutionalize the \nNew Haven board's plan, not one of the fourteen delegates from the district that included New \nHaven would have even mentioned its potential effect on the New Haven case. The record of the \nconvention, however, is bereft of any such mention. \nThat record, moreover, affirmatively demonstrates that the delegates did not intend \"segregation,\" as \nused in article first, § 20, to include de facto segregation. To the contrary, the history of the article \nand the debate over the term \"segregation\" in the 1965 convention compel the conclusion that the \n\ndelegates intended the term specifically to preclude, under our state constitution, the doctrine of \nstate-created \"separate but equal\" educational and other public facilities that the United States \nSupreme Court had expressly overruled, as a matter of fourteenth amendment jurisprudence, \nin Brown v. Board of Education, supra, 347 U.S. 483. \nIn February, 1950, the commission on state government organization issued its report to the General \nAssembly and to then Governor Chester Bowles. Among 112*112 its recommendations was a \nrevision of the constitution, which included a new article first, our Declaration of Rights, including the \nfollowing proposed article first, § 20: \"No person shall be denied the enjoyment of, nor be \ndiscriminated against in, nor be segregated in, any right or employment, nor be so treated in the \nmilitia, or in the public schools or in any public place, because of religious principles, race, color, \nancestry or national origin.\" The commission's recommendation to revise the constitution was not \nacted upon. \nDuring the 1965 convention, on July 28, 1965, Chase Going Woodhouse introduced Resolution No. \n168, which contained several recommendations for changes in our Declaration of Rights, article first. \nAmong these were two proposals that are relevant to this case. First, the resolution proposed that \narticle first, § 1,[48] be amended to add the provision that all men are \"entitled to the equal protection \nof the laws.\" Second, it proposed that article first, § 20,[49] be amended exactly as had been \nproposed by the commission to the General Assembly and the governor in 1950.[50] This resolution \nwas referred to the Committee on Resolutions. \nUltimately, the committee reported to the floor of the convention its Rules Committee Substitute for \nConstitutional Convention Resolution No. 168 (committee resolution 168). This resolution proposed \na number of changes in the provisions of article first. Included within committee resolution 168 was \nthe proposal that both article first, § 1, and then article first, § 20; see footnote 113*113 49; remain \nunchanged, and that there be a new article first, § 22,[51] providing as follows: \"No person shall be \ndenied the equal protection of the law, nor the enjoyment of his civil or political rights, nor be \ndiscriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color, ancestry or national \norigin.\" This draft of article first, § 22, therefore, incorporated the explicit references to equal \nprotection of the law and discrimination that had been in original Resolution No. 168, but omitted the \nspecific references to segregation, employment, the militia and the public schools that had also been \nin the original resolution. \nThis proposal prompted a letter to the convention by the Connecticut Council of Churches that \ncommittee resolution 168 was not specific enough. The council stated that \"`segregation constitutes \nsuch a core area of discrimination as it affects the pattern of relationship among persons and groups \nand needs thereby to be specifically guarded against through constitutional provision.' \" J. Zaiman, \n\"Anti-Separation Clause Urged for Bill of Rights,\" The Hartford Courant, Oct. 14, 1965, pp. 1 and 11. \nThe council also expressed the thoughts that, because \"`civil or political rights'\" was not defined in \nthe proposal, that language was \"`so broad as to be specifically excepted against in any \ncontroversial test of rights,'\" and that \"`[o]ur history seems to show that platitudinous phrases have \nnot helped many of our citizens to enjoy specific rights that could not be pointed to implicitly in \nconstitutional authority.'\" Id., p. 11. \nIn addition, according to a contemporary account in The Hartford Courant, certain civil rights groups \nalso thought that the proposal was not specific enough, and suggested reinserting the \n\"antisegregation\" clause. Id., p. 1. This prompted caucuses by both the Democrats 114*114 and \nRepublicans, as a result of which there was bipartisan agreement on reinserting language referring \nto segregation. \n\nAccordingly, on October 14, Woodhouse brought to the floor an amendment reinserting the \nreference to \"segregation,\" which resulted in the following language that ultimately became article \nfirst, § 20: \"No person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation \nor discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his civil or political rights because of religion, race, \ncolor, ancestry or national origin.\" \nIn proposing this amendment, Woodhouse reminded the convention that the word segregation had \nappeared in the original resolution, and that the only question was one of the appropriate wording to \nbe used.[52] 2 Proceedings, supra, pp. 690-91. Former Chief Justice Baldwin, one of the drafters of \ncommittee resolution 168 that was being amended, and another delegate, James J. Kennelly, both \nrose to stress the symbolic, as opposed to substantive, nature of the amendment.[53] Id., pp. 691-92. \n115*115 The only reference to education in the entire debate over committee resolution 168 was by \nBernstein, and that reference was made in the context of his delineating more specifically the \"civil \nand political rights\" to which the proposal referred. Bernstein stated: \"I just want to comment that in \nthis section which states that there will be enjoyment of civil and political rights, for the record, \nperhaps we might spell out a few of them so that courts and historians in the future may not fail to \nunderstand what we are talking about. These are rights which we have always assumed we have \nhad anyway and these rights include rights of freedom from discrimination in travel, rights of freedom \nin education, public accommodations, and employment and housing.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 694. \nO'Sullivan put the amendment to a voice vote, and ruled it adopted. O'Sullivan then ruled \"that \nthis 116*116 amendment is not a substantive change and therefore we can act upon the entire bill \ntoday.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 696. \nReading this record in an objective, dispassionate manner leads inescapably to the conclusions that \nthe use of the term \"segregation\" in what ultimately became article first, § 20: (1) was intended to \nemphasize that the entire section prohibited intentional segregation in the \"separate but equal\" \nsense; (2) was not intended to add substance to the provision, but was intended only to make the \ngeneral principles more specific; (3) was not intended to affect rights to education in a way different \nfrom other civil and political rights; and (4) cannot be read to mean one thing when applied to all \nsuch rights except education, but the opposite when applied to the right to public education under \narticle eighth, § 1. Several reasons compel these conclusions. \nFirst, the historical source of the term was the 1950 recommendation to the General Assembly and \ngovernor for a constitutional provision. In 1950, the term \"segregation,\" in the constitutional sense, \nreferred to the widespread system of laws in other parts of the nation, mandating the separation of \nthe races, the constitutionality of which was then maintained under the infamous \"separate but \nequal\" doctrine. There is no evidence, either in this case or historically in general, to suggest that in \n1950 this term was understood to mean racial or ethnic concentration that was not the product of \nstate intent. Moreover, this historical source was specifically noted as the source of original \nResolution No. 168, introduced to the 1965 convention by Woodhouse. \nSecond, after committee resolution 168 was reported out without the term \"segregation,\" the \nprincipal motive to reinsert it was to respond to the concern of civil rights groups and the Council of \nChurches, which was, not that the new resolution was not broad enough, but 117*117 that it was not \nspecific enough. Certainly, in 1965, eleven years after Brown and while the civil rights movement \nwas taking hold in the land and extending the principle of Brown to all areas of public life, the \nCouncil's reference to segregation as a \"core area of discrimination\" could only have referred to \nsegregation in its constitutional sense of legally mandated or sanctioned segregation, and cannot be \nplausibly read as referring to what we later have come to describe as de facto segregation.[54] \n\nThird, Woodhouse's remarks when she introduced the amendment reinforced the conclusion that the \nsubstance of what she sought to have enacted was already embodied in the provision, and that the \nreinsertion of the term was only to make the equal protection principle more specific, not to add \nsomething of substance that was not already included therein. See footnote 52. Read in the context \nof 1965, her reference to the \"philosophy and the practice of segregation\" could only have meant \nthat philosophy and practice as a legal concept. See 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 691. Indeed, one \nwonders what the reference to \"philosophy\" could have meant in the context of racial and ethnic \nconcentration that occurs as a result of demographic factors without any planning, intent, idea or \ndoctrine behind it. Woodhouse's final remarks, namely, that the amendment \"in no way limits the \nrights of anyone,\" and that it \"strengthens the wording\" of committee resolution 168; id.; were an \nassurance to the Council of Churches and others that their concern for specificity was being met. \nHer assurance that the 118*118 insertion of \"segregation\" makes the general more specific cannot be \nread, as the majority reads it, however, to make the general something else. \nFourth, the drafters of committee resolution 168, Baldwin, O'Sullivan and Bordon,[55]three former \nmembers of this court, including two former Chief Justices, chose to exclude the term. One of them, \nBaldwin, acknowledged that they had discussed in the Committee on Resolutions the question of \nwhether to include the term \"segregation,\" and had concluded that \"it was unnecessary to put in \nthere.\" Id., p. 692. Baldwin, and presumably O'Sullivan and Bordon, the other distinguished \nmembers of the drafting subcommittee, was nonetheless agreeable to the amendment \"if it will \nplease people.\" Id. \nIn addition, Baldwin disclosed that the subcommittee had canvassed the state's legislation \n\"protecting political and civil rights,\" and had found that our state led the nation in that respect. Id., \npp. 695-96. He expressed his pride in that legislative record, and noted that, if other states had \nlegislation like ours, \"we would not be having the trouble that we are having in some places today.\" \nId., p, 696. Among that legislation was General Statutes § 10-15c, which requires that public schools \nbe open to all children without discrimination on account of race, creed or color, and which had been \nin effect since 1868.[56] The most plausible inference from this 119*119 statement is that he was \nreferring, in part at least, to the still extant resistance, in other parts of the nation, to elimination of \nthe separate but equal doctrine, in education as well as other areas. \nHad there been any intent in reinserting the term \"segregation\" that it have one meaning when \napplied to education and an opposite meaning when applied to all the other political and civil rights, \nthe drafting subcommittee, who obviously commanded the respect of their colleagues, would have \nsaid so and would not have misled the delegates by assuring them that there was no change in \nsubstance intended by reinsertion. This is particularly true because if, as the majority posits, \nthere are dual and opposite meanings lurking in the language, (1) that duality is certainly not \napparent on the face of article first, § 20, (2) it is inconceivable that the draftsmen of the article would \nhave left that duality unexpressed, and (3) this unexpressed duality would have opened the entire \narticle to an even more bizarre interpretation, namely, that intention does not apply to, and is not \nrequired to constitute a violation of, any of the civil or political rights encompassed by the article. In \nsum, the majority's interpretation of article first, § 20, cannot rationally or responsibly be attributed to \nthe people who drafted it or to their colleagues with whom they discussed and adopted it. \nFifth, with one exception discussed immediately below, the debate on article first, § 20, is bereft of \nreferences to education. Thus, the majority's attempt to link the two, and to establish that the \nreference to \"segregation\" in the section was intended to mean de facto segregation, but solely when \napplied to article eighth, § 1, has no support in this record. Indeed, it is impossible to imagine how \nthe debate over \"segregation\" could indicate such an intent, because when the debate took place, \nconsideration of article eighth, § 1, the education clause, was five days in the future. \n\n120*120 The only reference to the subject of education in the entire debate on the amendment \noccurred in remarks by Bernstein. 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 694. Those remarks are significant for \nseveral reasons that have more to do with what they do not establish than what they do establish. As \nnoted, Bernstein made his remarks five days before the convention considered the resolution that \nultimately became the education provision, article eighth, § 1. Thus, they could have had no \nconceivable relevance to the interpretation of that provision. In addition, his reference to education \nwas intended to do nothing more than to indicate that education was one of those \"civil and political \nrights,\" along with, in his view, travel, public accommodations, employment and housing, that would \nbe covered by article first, § 20. Id. As discussed previously, when Bernstein did specifically address \nthe reach of the education clause five days after the adoption of the segregation clause, he made \nclear that the education clause was intended only to constitutionalize the then existing system of free \npublic education—a municipality based system that included well documented instances of racial \nisolation. 3 Proceedings, supra, p. 1039. \nThus, when the majority asserts that \"[t]he delegates' expectation that the proposed amendments to \nthe constitution would secure interrelated constitutional rights was underscored by Bernstein's \nremark that article first, § 20, was intended to be applied in the context of the `rights of freedom in \neducation,'\" the majority merely states the obvious. Of course article first, § 20, was intended to \napply to education, as one of the \"civil or political rights\" referred to in that article. To the extent, \nhowever, that the majority suggests that Bernstein's remarks imply some connection between that \nobvious application and a specific and different meaning of \"segregation\" in that article when applied \nto article eighth, § 1, the suggestion is utterly without basis. \n121*121 Sixth, O'Sullivan, another member of the drafting subcommittee, presiding as the chairman \nof the convention ruled the amendment to be technical and not substantive. 2 Proceedings, supra, p. \n696. Such a ruling cannot be squared with the notion that the amendment had the intended effect of \ntransforming the resolution from a straightforward equal protection provision, which specifically \nincorporated into our constitution principles that had already been held to be there by the established \ninterpretations of article first, § 1, into a provision that maintained those principles generally, but \naltered them radically with respect only to public education. If such a transformation is anything, it is \ncertainly substantive and not technical, and O'Sullivan would have called that fact to his colleagues' \nattention. \nSeventh, although we have on occasion interpreted article first, § 20, to have a broader meaning \nthan its federal counterpart, based on differing language between the two; see, \ne.g., Daly v. DelPonte, 225 Conn. 499, 513, 624 A.2d 876 (1993) (protecting from discrimination those \nwith physical and mental disabilities based on explicit language of article first, § 20); the record in \nthis case demonstrates that the linguistic difference, namely, the specific reference to \"segregation,\" \nwas not intended to have a meaning different from that of the federal equal protection clause. \nContrary to the assertion of the majority, this record demonstrates that it was intended only to \nconstitute a more specific application of the same principle of equal protection of the laws. \nEighth, even if one somehow were able to read the record as not clearly establishing the meaning of \n\"segregation\" to require intent, at the least it cannot be disputed that the record does not clearly \nindicate that \"segregation\" has no requirement of intent. Moreover, it cannot be disputed that reading \nthe record as the majority reads it works a radical change in our constitutional 122*122 equal \nprotection jurisprudence. We do not read our constitutional text to make radical changes without \nclear evidence of an intent to do so. Fonfara v. Reapportionment Commission, 222 Conn. 166, 172-73, 610 \nA.2d 153 (1992). The majority's approach violates this sound principle of constitutional interpretation. \nThus, there is no basis for the suggestion by the majority of relevance to the issues in this case that \nwhen both article eighth, § 1, and article first, § 20, were debated by the convention delegates, \"they \n\nrecognized and endorsed the landmark decision in Brown ...declaring the unconstitutionality of \n`separate but equal' public school education.\" First, there is no mention whatsoever of Brown, or of \nthe question of segregation of schools, in the debate over article eighth, § 1. The entire debate \nconcerned the fact that Connecticut was one of few states that did not mention education in its \nconstitution, and the desirability of doing so.[57] 3 Proceedings, supra, pp. 1038-41. If anything, the \nfact that the delegates obviously were aware of Brown contradicts the inference that the majority \nseeks to draw. The debate over article first, § 20, referred to the separate but equal doctrine \ndeclared invalid in Brown. That was a doctrine of state intended segregation, and there is no \nsuggestion in this debate that the framers intended the references to segregation to include the \nnotion of de facto concentration of races or ethnic groups.[58] \n123*123 Finally, the available historical evidence does not end with the printed record of the \nconvention. There are postconvention documents that shed light on the question involved in this \ncase, principally by the absence of any suggestion that comports with the majority's analysis. These \ndocuments are: (1) a resume by the secretary of the state of the proposals passed by the \nconvention; (2) an annotated copy of the proposed revised constitution, with marginal notes, \npublished by the convention itself \"as a guide to the people of the state\"; and (3) an account \npublished in The Hartford Courant, December 5, 1965, p. 36, of an interview with Baldwin in which \nhe explained the work of the convention. Each of these discusses article first, § 20, in brief and \nsummary fashion. None of them, however, even suggests that it could have opposite meanings \nwhen applied to education and other rights. If the majority's startling textual and historical \nconclusions are correct, it is curious that no one at the time understood what the convention had \ndone, not even the delegates themselves.[59] \n124*124 D \nRemedy \nThe final fundamental flaw in the majority opinion involves its discussion of a remedy for the \nconstitutional violation that it has found. In what must surely be one of the great understatements in \nthis court's history, the majority recognizes \"that the fashioning of appropriate declaratory or \ninjunctive relief requires careful consideration in order to weigh the benefits and costs of various \nremedial measures.\" The majority considers remanding the case to the trial court for the fashioning \nof a remedy because, in its view of the record, \"the parties have not had the opportunity to present \nevidence directed to the remedial consequences that follow from our decision on the merits of the \nplaintiffs' complaint,\" and because in this court the plaintiffs \"have not focused their attention on the \nremedial consequences of a substantive decision in their behalf.\" The majority eschews this course \nof action, as well as the notion of inviting further briefing in this court, however, in favor of \"the \nmethodology used in Horton I,\" namely, staying further judicial intervention to afford the General \nAssembly an opportunity to take appropriate action. In what must surely be one of the most ironic \nstatements in this court's history, given the majority's judicial overreaching in this case, the majority \noffers as its rationale for this methodology \"[p]rudence and sensitivity to the constitutional authority of \ncoordinate branches of government....\" \nThis flaw has two parts. First, it misrepresents the record in this case. Second, it imposes on the \nGeneral Assembly a mandate to enact a remedial regime without an articulation of principle to guide \nit in its endeavors. \n125*125 1 \n\nThe Record Regarding Remedy \nThe majority's assertion that \"the parties have not had the opportunity to present evidence directed \nto the remedial consequences that follow from our decision on the merits of the plaintiffs' complaint\" \nis contrary to the record. The question of a potential remedy was extensively litigated and briefed in \nthe trial court, which specifically noted that \"this is not a bifurcated hearing.\" The parties presented \nseveral witnesses on the subject of a remedy.[60] In their posttrial brief, the plaintiffs spent twelve \npages discussing the question of a remedy, and the defendants responded in kind, devoting thirty \npages to the question. \nIn addition, on remand the trial court made numerous findings regarding a potential remedy. The \nplaintiffs do 126*126 not challenge these findings in this appeal. The court found that no state in the \ncountry has a racial imbalance law that requires interdistrict balancing. Under the heading, \"The \nNature and Scope of the Remedy,\" the court made seventeen additional specific findings. Among \nthose findings were the following. The plaintiffs seek to have the court direct the Hartford school \ndistricts and the twenty-one suburban districts to address the claimed inequities jointly, to \nreconfigure district lines, and to take other steps sufficient to eliminate those inequities. The court \nalso found that the \"present racial, ethnic and socioeconomic concentration and isolation of the \nschoolchildren in the Hartford public school system on the basis of their residence is principally the \nresult of social and demographic patterns of change that have occurred over the past thirty years in \nthe Hartford metropolitan area.\" \nThe trial court found further that the relief sought by the plaintiffs includes the integration of the \npublic schools in the region for the purpose of eliminating economic, as well as racial and ethnic, \nisolation. The court noted that, although William Gordon, an expert witness for the plaintiffs, was of \nthe opinion that the federal courts' method of eliminating de jure segregation could be effectively \napplied to this case, the remedial planning in this case would be more complicated because the \nremedy sought by the plaintiffs includes interdistrict economic integration. The court also noted the \nplaintiffs' expert witnesses' opinions that problems of poverty can be appropriately addressed by the \npublic schools. The court rejected these opinions, however, as inconsistent with the \"general \nagreement that conventional educational approaches are inadequate to address the special \nproblems of the urban poor,\" and with the \"unanimous and apparently undisputed finding of the \ngovernor's commission on quality and integrated education that there [are] no educational strategies \nor 127*127 initiatives that could fully deal with the larger issues of poverty, unemployment, housing, \nhealth, substance abuse, hunger, parental neglect, and crowded and substandard housing\" that are \nassociated with the concentration of poverty. \nThe trial court specifically found that there \"are no existing standards or guidelines that educators, \nsocial scientists or desegregation planners can offer or recommend to achieve the proper racial, \nethnic and socioeconomic balance in the school districts of the Hartford metropolitan area.\" The \ncourt further found that \"[m]andatory student reassignment plans to achieve racial balance, whether \nintradistrict or interdistrict, are ineffective methods of achieving integration, whether they are \nmandated by racial imbalance laws or by court order.\" In this connection, the court also found that \n\"[p]roposed solutions to the problems of racial, ethnic and economic isolation which rely on coercion \nand which fail to offer choices and options either do not work or have unacceptable consequences.\" \nFinally, the court found that \"[i]ntegration in its fullest and most meaningful sense can only be \nachieved by building affordable housing in suburban areas in order to break up the inner city \nghettos, and by making urban schools more attractive for those who live outside the city.\" \nThese facts, like the facts regarding the educational effects of poverty rather than of race or \nethnicity, were drawn from the testimony of the witnesses whom the parties had presented at trial. \nThe competing factual claims were vigorously litigated at trial and briefed in the trial court, and both \n\nsides had a full and fair opportunity to brief them in this court. If, as the majority suggests, that \nopportunity was not adequately afforded here, it can only be attributed to the fact that the majority \nprecludes it by sending the case directly to the General Assembly and the executive branch. This \nbrings 128*128 me to the task that the majority has thrust upon those branches of government by its \nopinion. \n2 \nThe Lack of a Recognizable Principle or Standard \nI confess that, if I were a member of either the executive or legislative branch of our government, I \nwould have but the slightest glimmering of what kind of legislation would comport with the majority's \nmandate, because the opinion articulates no principle or standard upon which to base such \nlegislation. Confining my discussion here to the Hartford metropolitan area, I can find no principle or \nstandard in the majority opinion by which to measure the level of racial and ethnic integration of the \nAfrican-American and Hispanic schoolchildren that will be constitutional. \nThe closest thing to such a principle are three statements by the majority. The first is that \"the \nexistence of extreme racial and ethnic isolation\" in the public schools violates the constitution. \n(Emphasis added.) The second is that if \"significant racial and ethnic isolation continues to occur,\" \nno intent to bring about or maintain that isolation is required in order to establish a constitutional \nviolation. (Emphasis added.) The third is that a \"significant component of [a] substantially equal \neducational opportunity is access to a public school education that is not substantially impaired by \nracial and ethnic isolation.\" \nAssuming that these elliptical references constitute the majority's guidance to the General Assembly, \nis the lack of significant isolation, or the presence of substantial impairment, the same as \"substantial \nequality?\" Does significant isolation or \"substantially impaired\" mean that, with respect to the \nHartford metropolitan area, the legislature must start with the last census figures, and redraw the \ndistrict lines so that each municipality 129*129 has a substantially equal percentage of African-\nAmerican and Hispanic schoolchildren? Or does the reference to \"extreme racial and ethnic \nisolation\" mean that, so long as the concentration is not massive—something less than the current \n92 or 95 percent figure,[61] for example—the constitution will not be violated? Or is the measure a \nstatewide, rather than a district-wide figure? That is, must each municipality have a percentage of \nAfrican-American and Hispanic schoolchildren substantially equal to the percentage of such children \nin the state? Education is, after all, a state responsibility that has only been delegated to the \nmunicipalities. \nFurther, why is the municipality the appropriate measuring unit, rather than the individual school? \nAfter all, if a student's constitutional right to an integrated education is violated by being required to \nbe educated in a racially or ethnically concentrated setting, thereby, according to the majority, \nmissing out on the social benefits of an integrated education and incurring the social burdens of a \nsegregated education upon which the majority's analysis rests, then is it not appropriate that we look \nat the actual setting in which each child's education takes place? After all, a student who attends a \nracially and ethnically concentrated school, albeit in a racially and ethnically integrated school \ndistrict, will not have those benefits and will carry those burdens. If so, then it seems that each \nschool must, constitutionally, have the appropriate racial and ethnic makeup. 130*130 These are just \nsome of the questions that are raised, but not addressed, by the majority opinion. \nThe task of the state will be complicated, moreover, by the findings of the trial court in this case \nregarding remedy. The majority does not address these findings, but my examination of the record \n\ndiscloses that they are based on sufficient evidence to withstand appellate scrutiny. Among those \nfindings are the following. \nThe trial court found that there are no educational strategies or initiatives that could fully deal with \nthe larger issues of poverty, unemployment, housing, health, substance abuse, parental neglect, and \ncrowded and substandard housing that are associated with the concentration of poverty under which \nthe plaintiffs suffer. Thus, it is these factors, not the plaintiffs' racial and ethnic concentration, that \naccount for the educational deficiencies of which the plaintiffs complain. Furthermore, the court \nfound that there are no existing standards or guidelines that educators, social scientists or \ndesegregation planners can offer or recommend to achieve the proper racial, ethnic and \nsocioeconomic basis in the school districts of the Hartford metropolitan area. The majority's \nmandate, therefore, will require the state to devise a strategy to compel integration that, the trial \ncourt found after six years of litigation, will not significantly ameliorate the underlying educational \ndeficiencies of which the plaintiffs complain, and with respect to which educators, social scientists \nand desegregation planners could not offer standards or guidance. Thus, the majority thrusts on our \nstate government the truly awesome task of devising a remedy for educational deficiencies in \nHartford—a remedy that will necessarily require drastic statewide changes—without an intelligible \nguiding principle, and with no indication that the true source of Hartford's educational deficiencies will \nbe addressed thereby. \n131*131 In this respect, also, this case differs markedly from Horton I. In that case, like this case, the \nquestion of the availability of an appropriate remedy or remedies had been litigated. In that case, \nhowever, unlike this case, the trial court had found, and we affirmed based on that finding, that there \nwere feasible remedies available to achieve the substantial equality of educational opportunity that \nwas not being afforded by the flat grant funding system. Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 635-36. \nFurthermore, in that case, unlike this case, there were successful methods in use in many other \nstates for remedying the inequality of educational opportunity resulting from financial inequities. Id., \n651. According to the trial court's findings here, by contrast, there are no strategies available, or in \nsuccessful use elsewhere, for remedying differences in educational opportunities that result from \nconcentrations of poverty. In sum, whereas the remedy in Horton I involved moving dollars around \nand thereby ameliorating educational differences and deficiencies, the remedy here will involve \nmoving schoolchildren around without ameliorating such differences or deficiencies. \nIV \nTHE NECESSARY IMPLICATIONS OF THE MAJORITY \nOPINION \nDespite the effort of the majority to cabin its conclusions, it is clear to me that the effort must fail and \nthat, when the General Assembly attempts to enact legislation in order to meet the mandate of this \ncase, there are several necessary—not possible, not probable but, in my view, necessary—\nimplications of the majority opinion that it will be required to confront. I have already discussed what \nseems to me to be the most obvious implication, namely, that the majority's rationale applies, not just \nto interdistrict racial and ethnic concentrations, but to intradistrict and interschool \nconcentrations 132*132 as well. There are, however, other less obvious but equally necessary \nimplications. \nThese implications are compelled in part by the identity of the plaintiffs. Six of the eighteen plaintiffs \nare white students—four who reside in Hartford, and two who reside in West Hartford. Moreover, \nthere is no showing that the two who live in West Hartford are burdened by a concentration of \n\npoverty. The majority opinion vindicates these white students' constitutional right to attend \nunsegregated schools, as well as the constitutional right of the African-American and Hispanic \nplaintiffs. Furthermore, the racial and ethnic concentration involved in the Hartford school district is \nmore ethnic than racial. That is, a greater percentage of the students in Hartford are Hispanic than \nare African-American, and Hispanics are the fastest growing segment of the school population. \nThus, in terms of article first, § 20, this case is more about \"ancestry\" and \"national origin\" than it is \nabout \"race\" or \"color.\"[62] \n133*133 The first of the necessary implications of the majority opinion is that every school district in \nthe state that is primarily white and that does not have an appropriate percentage of African-\nAmerican and Hispanic students, is in violation of article first, § 20.[63] This conclusion, it seems clear \nto me, flows inexorably from the facts that (1) in this case, it is not only the constitutional rights to an \nunsegregated education of the African-American and Hispanic students, taken together, that are \nbeing violated, but the same rights of the white plaintiffs who live in Hartford and West Hartford, and \n(2) this violation is based on the general social benefits attributable to an integrated education, and \nthe general social burdens attendant upon a racially and ethnically concentrated education. \nCertainly, every predominantly white school district lacks the general social benefits of an integrated \neducation, and suffers from the general social burdens of a segregated education. Just as certainly, \nthe constitutional rights of white students in other parts of the state cannot be less than those in the \nHartford metropolitan area, and a student's constitutional right to attend school in an unsegregated \npublic school district, or to attend an unsegregated school within such a district, cannot depend on \nwhere the student happens to live. \nIndeed, the majority comes very close to making explicit this necessary implication of its decision. It \nstates that the right of \"Connecticut schoolchildren\" to a substantially equal educational opportunity \nrequires \"access to a public school education that is not substantially impaired by racial and ethnic \nisolation.\" Thus, every rural and suburban school district, from Litchfield to Pomfret and from \nGreenwich to Granby, is now either clearly or probably unconstitutional; its boundaries, \nor 134*134 the racial and ethnic makeup of its school population, or both, will have to be changed in \norder to remedy that unconstitutionality. This means the end of the traditional system of municipality \nbased school districts.[64] \nSecond, because ethnicity is a specifically protected class under article first, § 20, and because the \nfacts of this case rest more on ethnicity than on race, not only must every school district in this state \nhave an appropriate percentage of African-American and Hispanic students, taken together, but also \nan appropriate ethnic makeup, irrespective of race. Furthermore, I cannot see how such a makeup \ncan be properly confined to counting Hispanic students. Certainly, other ethnic groups have no \nlesser status than Hispanic students. Just as certainly, moreover, the general benefits of an \nintegrated education and the general burdens of a segregated education apply to ethnic, as well as \nracial, segregation. Therefore, if ethnicity is a protected class under article first, § 20, if \"segregation\" \ndoes not require intent, and if segregation prohibits ethnic as well as racial segregation, then in order \nfor a school district to be nonsegregated it will have to contain an appropriate percentage of the \nvarious major ethnic groups in the state. \nThird, because \"segregation\" in article first, § 20, does not have an intentionality requirement, and \nbecause that article protects religion on a par with race and ethnicity, every school district, and \nprobably every neighborhood school, that is heavily concentrated with students of one religion is \nsegregated. Consequently, all of the students in that district or school are being subjected to \nsegregation \"because of religion.\" Therefore, 135*135 the legislature will be required to address this \nnecessary implication of the majority's mandate, so that each district, or school, will have an \nappropriate percentage of Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish students.[65] \n\nAs a result of these implications, the legislature, if it is to take seriously its responsibilities under the \nmajority's mandate, will have few options, if any, other than a statewide realignment of school \ndistricts, accompanied by a statewide transportation system.[66] Such a system will be necessary to \nensure that the constitutional rights of every schoolchild in the state are protected.[67] \n136*136 V \nTHE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS AS PRESENTED TO THIS \nCOURT \nThis discussion brings me, finally, to a consideration of the plaintiffs' claims as they were \nactually presented to us for adjudication, not as reconstructed by the majority. The plaintiffs make \nthree claims that, in my view of the case, must be addressed.[68] These are, in general terms, that: \n(1) the defendants violated article first, §§ 1 and 20, and article eighth, § 1, by failing to provide \npublic schoolchildren in the Hartford metropolitan area an equal educational opportunity; (2) the \ndefendants violated article first, §§ 1 and 20, by providing education in the Hartford metropolitan \narea that is segregated on the basis of race and ethnicity; and (3) the defendants violated article \neighth, § 1, by failing to provide Hartford schoolchildren a minimally adequate education. Although \nmuch of my prior discussion disposes of most of these claims, some further discussion is \nappropriate. None of these claims is persuasive, moreover, because none is supported by the \nrecord. I would, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.[69] \nA \nEqual Educational Opportunity \nAs I indicated previously, the plaintiffs' equal educational opportunity claim is based on Horton I, and \nis 137*137 premised on the factual assertion that the racial and ethnic concentration in the district, \ncoupled with their concentration of poverty and their lesser educational resources, as compared to \nthe resources of the suburban districts, has caused educational outcomes in the Hartford school \ndistrict that are inferior to those in the suburban districts. The claim also depends in significant part \non the premise that, with respect to the relative educational outcomes of Hartford and the suburbs, \nthe state mastery test scores are a valid tool for measuring differences in educational outcomes \nbetween Hartford and the suburbs. Consequently, they argue, just as in Horton I, in which unequal \nfunding caused an inferior quality of education in the property-poor towns and violated the \nconstitution, in this case the combination of factors listed earlier has caused the quality of education \nin the Hartford district to be inferior to that provided in the surrounding suburban districts and violates \nthe constitution. Similarly, the plaintiffs argue that the relative quality of educational opportunities \nmust be measured by the same or similar factors that this court deemed relevant in Horton I, supra, \n172 Conn. 634, namely: educational outcomes, as reflected by the state mastery test scores, state \nremedial goals, scholastic aptitude test (SAT) scores and college attendance rates; plants and \nfacilities; equipment, supplies, textbooks and libraries; course offerings and curriculum; teaching and \nprofessional staff; bilingual education programs; and special needs programs. \nAs I indicated previously, although this claim might well be persuasive if its factual underpinnings \nwere sound, it founders on the factual findings of the trial court. It is not necessary to recount all of \nthose findings in this regard. It is sufficient to repeat here several that are fatal to the plaintiffs' claim. \n\n138*138 The trial court's findings are squarely contrary to the plaintiffs' claim that Hartford suffers \nfrom diminished educational resources compared to its suburban neighbors. The court found that, \nsince 1979, the state's method for financing public schools has taken into account the needs of \nurban school districts by including in the aid formula the number of children from low income families \nand, since 1989, a weighting factor that takes into account the number of students who score below \nthe remedial standard on the state's mastery test scores. The court also found that the 1986 \nEducational Enhancement Act addressed cities' financial needs by raising teachers' salaries \ndramatically, so that Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport have been able to recruit and retain \nteachers at salaries comparable to, if not higher than, the salary levels offered in the suburbs, and \nthat this has permitted urban class sizes to be reduced. The court found, in addition, that the priority \nschool district program provides that the poorer communities, like Hartford, receive the greatest \nfinancial benefit, that the state factors the mastery test scores into the aid formula as a measurement \nof a school district's need, and that where students do not meet remedial standards additional funds \nare made available. \nThe trial court found, moreover, that Hartford's teachers are as qualified as their suburban \ncounterparts, and that they are very committed and dedicated to providing a quality education for \ntheir students. Hartford's teacher training program is based on the \"effective schools\" concept, which \nis specifically directed to the needs of urban and minority children. Finally, the court found that \nHartford is not a negative educational setting, that there is \"outstanding education going on in its \nschools,\" that some \"of the best special education classes in the state can be found\" there, and that \nthe \"Hartford public schools offer academic programs that are sufficient to meet the basic \neducational needs of 139*139 all its students and also provide other programs that are required to \nmeet the special needs of its economically disadvantaged students.\" \nAs I indicated in great detail earlier, the trial court's findings are also squarely contrary to the \nplaintiffs' claim that there is a causal connection between their racial and ethnic concentration—\nwhether considered alone or in conjunction with the concentration of poverty—and any educational \ndeficiencies of which the plaintiffs complain. The gist of the trial court's findings in this regard is that it \nis not the racial and ethnic isolation of the plaintiffs, but their socioeconomic status—their poverty, its \nconcentration, and all of the social pathologies that are closely associated with poverty and its \nconcentration—that is the causative factor of those deficiencies.[70] These \"disadvantaging \ncharacteristics\" of poverty, which \"poor children bring with them\" from home and neighborhood to \nschool, include \"unemployment 140*140... substance abuse, hunger, parental neglect... crowded and \nsubstandard housing,\" and such \"at risk\" factors as low birth weight and mothers on drugs at birth. \nFinally, the trial court's findings are squarely contrary to the plaintiffs' claim that they have \nestablished valid differences in the educational outcomes between the Hartford school district and \nthe suburban districts. To the extent that the plaintiffs rely on the state mastery scores to measure \nthese differences, which as I read their brief is a considerable extent, the trial court found that such \nscores are not a valid means for measuring interdistrict achievements. Moreover, despite the \nplaintiffs' assertion to the contrary, the court's findings on this subject are not confined to the state \nmastery test scores.[71] \nThe plaintiffs contend, nonetheless, that the trial court's findings are clearly erroneous, that many of \nthe facts upon which they rely were undisputed in the trial court, and that the court was required to \naccept certain of the experts' opinions. Suffice it to say that neither the record nor the law bears out \nthat contention. The court's findings are fully supported by the evidence. None of the facts in \nquestion was undisputed; on the contrary, they were hotly disputed in the trial \ncourt, 141*141 originally and on our remand. Finally, it is axiomatic that a trial court is not required to \naccept an expert's opinion; Drabik v. East Lyme, 234 Conn. 390, 396, 662 A.2d 118 (1995); and that is \nparticularly true in this case, where the court indicated that some of the plaintiffs' experts' opinions \n\nwere flawed methodologically, and where there were contrary expert opinions that the trial court did \ncredit. \nB \nPer Se Segregation Under Article Eighth, § 1, and \nArticle First, § 20 \nThis claim of the plaintiffs bears little additional discussion. As I indicated previously, it rests entirely \non the proposition that \"segregation\" as used in article first, § 20, and applied to education under \narticle eighth, § 1, means de facto racial and ethnic concentration, without a requirement of state \nintention. As I also indicated previously, this claim is simply untenable, and such a conclusion cannot \nrationally be drawn from the language or history of those constitutional provisions. \nC \nA Minimally Adequate Education \nThe plaintiffs' final claim is that they have established that they are being deprived of their right, \nunder article eighth, § 1, to a minimally adequate education. This claim requires some additional \ndiscussion, because the majority did not discuss it and, therefore, it was not involved in my analysis \nof the majority opinion. I conclude, nonetheless, that the plaintiffs cannot prevail on this claim. \nThe plaintiffs argue, first, that, under both the majority opinion in Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. \n649 (referring to state's \"constitutional duty to educate its children\"), and the dissenting opinion \ntherein; id., 659 (Loiselle, J., 142*142 dissenting) (\"[w]hen the constitution says free education it must \nbe interpreted in a reasonable way. A town may not herd children in an open field to hear lectures by \nilliterates.\"); article eighth, § 1, embodies a requirement of a minimally adequate education that the \njudiciary is empowered to enforce. The plaintiffs also point to precedents from other jurisdictions \nthat, in their view, have held accordingly. They next contend that the trial court employed an \nimproper standard in defining a minimally adequate education and that, under the proper standard, \nthe evidence established a violation thereof as a matter of law. \nThe defendants respond, first, that article eighth, § 1, does not embody any particular substantive \nlevel of education that the judiciary has power to enforce. They contend that, although they agree \nthat the constitutional provision includes the right to an \"adequate education\"; id., 659; it \"does not \nauthorize the judiciary to establish specific educational programs and goals or levels of educational \nachievement as a constitutional requirement.\" The defendants next argue that, assuming we do \nconsider the issue, the trial court cannot be faulted for using a standard that the plaintiffs themselves \nproposed, that the standard now proposed by the plaintiffs is improper, and that, under any \nappropriate standard, the plaintiffs' rights have not been violated. \nIn my view, it is not necessary in this case to decide whether article eighth, § 1, embodies a \nrequirement that the state provide a minimally adequate education or, if it does, the extent to which \nsuch a requirement is subject to judicial review. Nor is it necessary to define the specific contours of \nsuch an education. Assuming that there is such a requirement that is subject to judicial review, I \nconclude that the standard proposed by the plaintiffs is improper and that, gauged by any \nappropriate standard, the plaintiffs have not been deprived of such a right. \n\n143*143 Although it is difficult to ascertain precisely the standard that the plaintiffs propose, it \nappears to be geared in significant part to student achievement, as measured by certain \nperformance goals set by the state, namely, the state mastery tests.[72] Thus, they assert that the \ntrial court improperly rejected as irrelevant to this claim their \"evidence relating to whether Hartford \nchildren were succeeding in the goals set by the state....\" They contend that this standard is not met \nin Hartford, which in their view is a \"school system whose children cannot read or write, even if \nprovided with significant resources,\" and that Hartford has not provided a minimally adequate \neducation because it is not a system \"that succeeds in teaching children to at least achieve a \nminimal level of reading, writing and arithmetic....\" As the defendants correctly point out, the plaintiffs \nbase these characterizations of the Hartford school district on the state mastery test scores for \nHartford. \nI reject, as did the trial court, the plaintiffs' proposed standard for a constitutionally required minimally \nadequate education. Performance or achievement of the student population, taken generally, cannot \nin my view be the principle upon which any such requirement is based. There is nothing in either the \nlanguage or the history of article eighth, § 1, to support such a standard. \nNot only the trial court's findings in this case, but also common sense tells me that any appropriate \nstandard by which to measure the state's assumed obligation to provide a minimally adequate \neducation must be based generally, not on what level of achievement students reach, but on what \nthe state reasonably attempts to make available to them, taking into account any special needs of a \nparticular local school system. 144*144 Although schools are important socializing institutions in our \ndemocratic society, they cannot be constitutionally required to overcome every serious social and \npersonal disadvantage that students bring with them to school, and that seriously hinder the \nacademic achievement of those students. Thus, as the trial court found, achievement levels as \nmeasured by such tools as the state mastery tests are an inappropriate measurement of the quality \nof education. Those test scores do not take into account important variables that erect difficult \nbarriers to achievement, such as socioeconomic status, early environmental deprivations, low birth \nweight, mothers on drugs at birth, diminished motivation to succeed academically, extraordinary \nmobility, limited English proficiency, and all of the other dismal factors associated with the \nconcentration of poverty in the Hartford school district. \nThis is not to say that, as part of its assumed constitutional obligation to provide a minimally \nadequate education, the state has no obligation to attempt, by reasonable means, to ameliorate \nthese problems. It may well have such an obligation. It is to say, however, that this record fully \nestablishes that the state has, through the programs, policies and funding mechanisms already \ndescribed, met that obligation. \nVI \nCONCLUSION \nIt is a bedrock principle of our system of government that the legislative branch is the source of the \nfundamental public policy of the state, and that the courts may invalidate such a policy only where it \nis established beyond a reasonable doubt that it violates a constitutional \nright. Morascini v. Commissioner of Public Safety, 236 Conn. 781, 789, 236 A.2d 1340 (1996). Not only \ndoes the majority fail even to give lip service to this principle, the majority violates it. \n145*145 With no justification other than its own view of the wiser course for the state to follow, the \nmajority strikes down a legislative public policy determination—in effect since 1909, more than half a \ncentury prior to the 1965 constitutional convention—in favor of municipality based public school \n\ndistricts, and substitutes its own policy choice for that legislative determination. With the same \nabsence of legitimate justification, the majority strikes down the legislative policy determination that \nmore can be accomplished toward the goal of diversity in our public school systems by voluntary and \nincremental means, supplemented by state funding and incentives, than by a mandate that requires \nthe abandonment of municipality based school districts and the institution of a statewide system of \ntransportation of schoolchildren. Instead, the majority substitutes its policy choice and opts for a \nmandate that will require such a statewide system of transportation based solely on racial, ethnic \nand religious factors. \nAlthough the majority may disagree with the legislature's choices and initiatives, it cannot be \nmaintained that reasonable people may not differ regarding the best way to reach the goal of \ndiversity in our public schools. Indeed, in states and communities across the nation people of \ngoodwill of all races and ethnic groups are struggling to find acceptable and feasible ways to reach \nand maintain that goal and, at the same time, to reach the twin goal of improving the quality of their \nchildren's education. This case, in which there are such disagreements and in which the defendants \nare engaged in a good faith effort to reach those goals, is the quintessential case for deference to \nthe policy choice of the legislative branch. \nThe majority concludes its opinion with a rhetorical invocation of its oath of office as a justification for \nits decision. That same oath of office, however, embraces the concept of judicial respect for the \nlegitimate policy 146*146 choices of the legislative branch, even when judges disagree with those \nchoices. \nOnly twelve years ago, we stated: \"This court has never viewed constitutional language as newly \ndescended from the firmament like fresh fallen snow upon which jurists may trace out their individual \nnotions of public policy uninhibited by the history which attended the adoption of the particular \nphraseology at issue and the intentions of its authors. The faith which democratic societies repose in \nthe written document as a shield against the arbitrary exercise of governmental power would be \nillusory if those vested with the responsibility for construing and applying disputed provisions were \nfree to stray from the purposes of the originators.\" Cologne v. Westfarms Associates, supra, 192 Conn. 62. \nIn this case, that snow has now fallen, and the shield against the arbitrary exercise of power has \nbeen shattered. \n[*] July 9, 1996, the date that this decision was released as a slip opinion, is the operative date for all substantive and \nprocedural purposes. \n[1] The constitution of Connecticut, article eighth, § 1, provides: \"There shall always be free public elementary and \nsecondary schools in the state. The general assembly shall implement this principle by appropriate legislation.\" \n[2] The constitution of Connecticut, article first, § 1, provides: \"All men when they form a social compact, are equal in rights; \nand no man or set of men are entitled to exclusive public emoluments or privileges from the community.\" The constitution of \nConnecticut, article first, § 20, as amended by articles five and twenty-one of the amendments, provides: \"No person shall \nbe denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of \nhis or her civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability.\" \n[3] The eighteen plaintiffs are: Milo Sheff, an African-American child residing in Hartford; Wildalize Bermudez, a Latino child \nresiding in Hartford; Pedro Bermudez, a Latino child residing in Hartford; Eva Bermudez, a Latino child residing in Hartford; \nOskar M. Melendez, a Latino child residing in Glastonbury; Waleska Melendez, a Latino child residing in Glastonbury; Martin \nHamilton, an African-American child residing in Hartford; Janelle Hughley, an African-American child residing in Hartford; \nNeiima Best, an African-American child residing in Hartford; Lisa Laboy, a Latino child residing in Hartford; David William \nHarrington, a white child residing in Hartford; Michael Joseph Harrington, a white child residing in Hartford; Rachel Leach, a \nwhite child residing in West Hartford; Joseph Leach, a white child residing in West Hartford; Erica Connolly, a white child \nresiding in Hartford; Tasha Connolly, a white child residing in Hartford; Michael Perez, a Latino child residing in Hartford; and \nDawn Perez, a Latino child residing in Hartford. \n\n[4] The defendants are: William O'Neill or his successor as the governor of the state of Connecticut; the state board of \neducation of the state of Connecticut; Abraham Glassman, A. Walter Esdaile, Warren J. Foley, Rita Hendel, John Mannix \nand Julia Rankin or their successor members of the state board of education; Gerald N. Tirozzi or his successor as the \ncommissioner of education for the state of Connecticut; Francis L. Borges or his successor as the treasurer of the state of \nConnecticut; and J. Edward Caldwell or his successor as the comptroller of the state of Connecticut. \nThe plaintiffs expressly disavowed at trial any claim that their constitutional rights had been violated by any acts or \nomissions on the part of the city of Hartford or its board of education, or on the part of the twenty-one surrounding suburban \ntowns or their boards of education. \n[5] General Statutes § 10-4a provides: \"Educational interests of state identified. For purposes of sections 10-4, 10-4b and \n10-220, the educational interests of the state shall include, but not be limited to, the concern of the state \n(1) that each child shall have for the period prescribed in the general statutes equal opportunity to receive a suitable \nprogram of educational experiences; \n(2) that each school district shall finance at a reasonable level at least equal to the minimum expenditure requirement \npursuant to the provisions of section 10-262J an educational program designed to achieve this end; and \n(3) that the mandates in the general statutes pertaining to education within the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education \nbe implemented.\" \n[6] The constitution of Connecticut, article first, § 8, as amended by article seventeen of the amendments, provides in \nrelevant part: \"No person shall be compelled to give evidence against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property \nwithout due process of law....\" \nThe constitution of Connecticut, article first, § 10, provides: \"All courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done to \nhim in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without \nsale, denial or delay.\" \n[7] We express herewith our sincere appreciation to all counsel for the diligence and the expedition with which they \nresponded to this court's request. Their professionalism is to be commended. \nWe also express herewith our sincere appreciation to the trial court for the diligence and the expedition with which that court \nresponded to this court's request. \n[8] We use the terms \"African-American\" and \"Latino\" because they are the terms that the parties used in their relevant \nstipulations of fact. \n[9] General Statutes § 10-240 provides: \"Control of schools. Each town shall through its board of education maintain the \ncontrol of all the public schools within its limits and for this purpose shall be a school district and shall have all the powers \nand duties of school districts, except so far as such powers and duties are inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.\" \n[10] General Statutes § 10-184 provides: \"Duties of parents. All parents and those who have the care of children shall bring \nthem up in some lawful and honest employment and instruct them or cause them to be instructed in reading, writing, \nspelling, English grammar, geography, arithmetic and United States history and in citizenship, including a study of the town, \nstate and federal governments. Each parent or other person having control of a child seven years of age and over and under \nsixteen years of age shall cause such child to attend a public day school regularly during the hours and terms the public \nschool in the district wherein such child resides is in session, or while the school is in session in which provision for the \ninstruction of such child is made according to law, unless the parent or person having control of such child is able to show \nthat the child is elsewhere receiving equivalent instruction in the studies taught in the public schools.\" \n[11] In 1868, Hartford enacted a town ordinance that assigned African-American students to a specially designated public \nschool. In response to the town ordinance, the General Assembly enacted legislation that provided for open enrollment in all \nof the state's public schools without regard to race. Public Acts, May Sess., 1868, c. CVIII; see General Statutes § 10-15c. \n[12] See footnote 9. \n\n[13] The plaintiffs have failed to brief and thus have abandoned the fourth count of their complaint that alleges that the \ndefendants have failed to provide the plaintiffs with a substantially equal educational opportunity in violation of article first, §§ \n8 and 10. See In re Bruce R., 234 Conn. 194, 215-16, 662 A.2d 107 (1995); State v. Mejia, 233 Conn. 215, 223 n.13, 658 A.2d 571 \n(1995). \n[14] The defendants have failed to pursue their defenses based on sovereign immunity, stare decisis and the plaintiffs' \nfailure to join necessary parties. We thus deem these claims abandoned and decline to address them. \n[15] In Horton v. Meskill, 187 Conn. 187, 445 A.2d 579 (1982) (Horton II), we addressed the ability of municipalities to intervene \nin the litigation arising out of our decision in Horton I. \n[16] The defendants in Horton I originally asserted defenses based on justiciability, sovereign immunity and standing. The \ntrial court ruled against the defendants on the issues of justiciability and standing, but did not address the issue of sovereign \nimmunity. Horton v. Meskill, 31 Conn. Sup. 377, 389, 332 A.2d 113 (1974). In their appeal to this court, the defendants in Horton \nI did not challenge the trial court's ruling. \nThe defendants in this case have not challenged the standing of the plaintiffs to bring this action. \n[17] Simmons v. Budds, 165 Conn. 507, 338 A.2d 479 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 940, 94 S. Ct. 1943, 40 L. Ed. 2d 291 (1974), on \nwhich the defendants rely, is not to the contrary. Although, in that case, we rejected a claim that the defendants, various \nUniversity of Connecticut officials, had violated the constitutional mandate of article eighth, § 2, that the university \"shall be \ndedicated to excellence in higher education,\" we did so on the merits. We did not hold that the claim was nonjusticiable. \n[18] Courts in other jurisdictions overwhelmingly have reached the same conclusion. See, e.g., Rose v. Council for Better \nEducation, Inc., 790 S.W.2d 186, 209 (Ky. 1989); McDuffy v. Secretary of Executive Office of Education, 415 Mass. 545, 610-11, 615 \nN.E.2d 516 (1993); Robinson v. Cahill, 69 N.J. 133, 145-47, 351 A.2d 713, cert. denied sub nom. Klein v. Robinson, 423 U.S. 913, 96 \nS. Ct. 217, 46 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975); Board of Education v. Nyquist, 57 N.Y.2d 27, 39, 439 N.E.2d 359, 453 N.Y.S.2d 643 \n(1982), appeal dismissed, 459 U.S. 1139, 103 S. Ct. 775, 74 L. Ed. 2d 986 (1983); Board of Education v. Walter, 58 Ohio St. 2d 368, \n383-86, 390 N.E.2d 813 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 665, 62 L. Ed. 2d 644 (1980); Washakie County School District \nNo. 1 v. Herschler, 606 P.2d 310, 317-18 (Wyo.), cert. denied sub nom. Hot Springs County School District No. 1 v. Washakie County \nSchool District No. 1, 449 U.S. 824, 101 S. Ct. 86, 66 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1980). \n[19] The plaintiffs also claim that the trial court improperly failed to find that the state actively contributed to the allegedly \nunconstitutional conditions that exist in the Hartford public school system. We find no merit to this claim. \n[20] See footnotes 9 and 10. \n[21] In fulfillment of its constitutional mandate to provide for the education of the state's youth, the legislature has developed \na detailed and comprehensive educational system. For example, the state identifies the educational interests that must be \nimplemented by the local school boards; General Statutes §§ 10-4a and 10-4b; sets the minimum length of the school year; \nGeneral Statutes § 10-15; sets the minimum length of the school day; General Statutes § 10-16; generally prescribes \nparticular courses of study; General Statutes §§ 10-16b, 10-18 and 10-19; requires bilingual education under some \ncircumstances; General Statutes § 10-17a; regulates special education programs; General Statutes §§ 10-76b and 10-76d; \nregulates teacher certification; General Statutes § 10-145b; requires attendance in the school district in which a student \nresides; General Statutes § 10-184; prescribes requirements for high school graduation; General Statutes § 10-221a; and \nregulates the suspension and expulsion of students. General Statutes §§ 10-233c and 10-233d. Although the legislature has \ndelegated the day-to-day functioning of the state's public elementary and secondary schools to towns; General Statutes §§ \n10-220 (defining duties of boards of education), 10-240 (providing town control of public schools within town boundaries) \nand 10-241 (defining powers of school districts); the legislature retains and exercises broad statutory authority in discharging \nits responsibility to meet the demands of the Connecticut constitution. \n[22] See footnote 9. \n[23] See footnote 10. \n[24] The significance of this finding is not diminished by the trial court's finding that \"social and demographic forces \ngenerated by the collective exercise of personal geographic preferences over which the state had no control\" had \ncontributed to the imbalance. Multiple factors may have significant impacts on the creation or perpetuation of a condition. \n\n[25] Courts in other jurisdictions have reached the same conclusion without directly addressing the state action question. \nFaced with state constitutional provisions that set forth an affirmative obligation to provide public education, these courts \nhave determined that legislative inaction with respect to the constitutional obligation may give rise to liability. \"The General \nAssembly must not only establish the system [of common schools], but it must monitor it on a continuing basis so that it will \nalways be maintained in a constitutional manner.\" Rose v. Council for Better Education, Inc., 790 S.W.2d 186, 211 (Ky. 1989); \nsee, e.g., McDuffy v. Secretary of Executive Office of Education, 415 Mass. 545, 606, 615 N.E.2d 516 (1993) (\"[T]he Commonwealth \nhas a duty to provide an education for all its children, rich and poor, in every city and town .... While it is clearly within the \npower of the Commonwealth to delegate some of the implementation of the duty to local governments, such power does not \ninclude a right to abdicate the obligation imposed ... by the Constitution. [Emphasis in original.]\"); Seattle School District No. \n1 v. State, 90 Wash. 2d 476, 523, 585 P.2d 71 (1978) (\"[T]he fact that the Legislature possesses an ultimate obligation to act is \nnot to say that it may act or not act as it chooses. The duty to act as well as the duty to do so within the parameters of [the \nconstitution] is constitutionally required.\"). \n[26] The federal precedents are unclear as to whether they require a showing of discriminatory intent to prove state action, \nor whether state action and discriminatory intent are independent requirements for proving a violation of the federal equal \nprotection clause. \n[27] The United States Supreme Court has never retreated from its holding in Reynolds. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 639-\n40, 113 S. Ct. 2816, 125 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1993) (citing Reynolds affirmatively); Burson v. Freeman,504 U.S. 191, 199, 112 S. Ct. 1846, \n119 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1992) (same); Board of Estimate v. Morris, supra, 489 U.S. 692-94 (extending principle set forth in Reynolds to \nelections of members of board of estimate). The court recently has addressed two other evils that violate the fourteenth \namendment to the United States constitution and threaten the right to vote: the dilution of the voting potential of minorities; \nsee Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 66, 100 S. Ct. 1490, 64 L. Ed. 2d 47 (1980); and the separation of voters into districts by race. \nSee Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 905, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1995); Shaw v. Reno, supra, 641-42. In these cases, \nthe court has required a showing of some form of intent in order to establish a constitutional claim. See Shaw v. Reno, supra, \n644-45, 649 (requiring proof that classification was motivated by racial purpose, although showing can be inferential if district \nlines are \"unexplainable on grounds other than race\"); Mobile v. Bolden,supra, 67-68 (requiring intent to discriminate). \n[28] See General Statutes § 10-226a et seq. (requiring public schools within districts to be racially balanced); General \nStatutes § 10-264a et seq. (promoting educational diversity through voluntary development and implementation of \ninterdistrict educational programs). In addition, the state has provided financial support and technical assistance to voluntary \ninterdistrict transfer programs, has provided technical assistance to intradistrict magnet schools and has authorized special \nbond funding for the construction and renovation of interdistrict magnet schools. \n[29] The only other constitutions that explicitly prohibit segregation are those of Hawaii and New Jersey. \nThe constitution of Hawaii, article first, § 9, provides: \"No citizen shall be denied enlistment in any military organization of this \nState nor be segregated therein because of race, religious principles or ancestry.\" No court has undertaken to interpret this \nprovision. The constitution of New Jersey, article first, paragraph 5, provides: \"No person shall be denied the enjoyment of \nany civil or military right, nor be discriminated against in the exercise of any civil or military right, nor be segregated in the \nmilitia or in the public schools, because of religious principles, race, color, ancestry or national origin.\" No court has \nconfronted the issue of whether this provision requires the state to prevent de facto segregation within its public school \nsystem. The Supreme Court of New Jersey has held that the state commissioner of education and local boards of education \nhave broad statutory authority, especially in light of the constitutional provision against segregation in schools, to prevent the \nimplementation of local decisions that would increase racial imbalance. See, e.g., Jenkins v. Township of Morris School \nDistrict, 58 N.J. 483, 506-508, 279 A.2d 619 (1971) (holding that commissioner may prevent withdrawal of town's children from \nparticular high school and enrollment in different high school if that change would result in increase in racial imbalance in \nthose schools); Booker v. Board of Education, 45 N.J. 161, 178, 212 A.2d 1 (1965) (holding that commissioner, in reviewing local \ndesegregation plan, must determine if plan takes sufficient and proper steps toward desegregation); Morean v. Board of \nEducation, 42 N.J. 237, 242-44, 200 A.2d 97 (1964) (supporting decision of town board of education to allocate children among \ndifferent schools in manner designed to prevent exacerbation of racial imbalance after board decided to close one junior \nhigh school). \n[30] The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \"No State shall ... deny to any \nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" \n[31] \"Segregation\" refers to the \"act or process of separation\"; Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); or to \"the separation or \nisolation of a race, class, or ethnic group by ... divided educational facilities, or by other discriminatory means....\" Webster's \nThird New International Dictionary (1961); see Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). \n\n[32] Neither Broadley v. Board of Education, supra, 229 Conn. 1, nor Savage v. Aronson, supra, 214 Conn. 256,is inconsistent with \nour constitutional analysis in this case. Neither case dealt with the particular combination of constitutional provisions on \nwhich the present plaintiffs rely. \nIn Broadley, we concluded that the state's special education statutes; General Statutes § 10-76a et seq.; had not \nestablished a constitutional right to an individualized educational program for gifted children. We held that \"when neither the \nlegislature nor the framers of our constitution have vested in gifted children any right to an individualized education program, \nwe cannot conclude that the plaintiff's right to a free public education under article eighth, § 1, of the Connecticut constitution \nincludes a right to a special education program.\" Broadley v. Board of Education, supra, 229 Conn. 8. Gifted children are not \nexpressly recognized as a cognizable constitutional class within article first, § 20. \nIn Savage v. Aronson, supra, 214 Conn. 287, we concluded that the constitutional right to a substantially equal educational \nopportunity does not include \"any [guarantee] that children are entitled to receive their education at any particular school or \nthat the state must provide [emergency] housing accommodations for them and their families close to the schools they are \npresently attending.\" In the absence of a claim of racial or ethnic isolation, the housing disparities that underlay this claim are \nnot expressly encompassed by article first, § 20. \nThe only decision of our sister states to which the parties draw our attention neither supports nor weakens our analysis. \nIn NAACP v. Dearborn, 173 Mich. App. 602, 615-16, 434 N.W.2d 444 (1988), appeal denied, 433 Mich. 906, 447 N.W.2d 751 \n(1989), the Michigan Court of Appeals determined that the plaintiffs need not show a discriminatory intent or purpose in \norder to prove a violation of the prohibition against racial discrimination embodied in that state's constitution. \nIn Dearborn, the Michigan court interpreted an equal protection provision that, without containing an express antisegregation \nclause, imposed an affirmative obligation on the state to prevent discrimination. \n[33] Woodhouse stated: \"[W]e have to realize that today the philosophy of segregation is something that is in the minds of all \nof us. It would be regrettable if it should be in any way suggested that this Constitution did not unequivocally oppose the \nphilosophy and the practice of segregation.\" 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 691. \n[34] In support of the amendment, Bernstein stated: \"In July I submitted a resolution No. 109 which pertained to the subject \nof education, actually it was the only resolution I did introduce and the statement of purpose of that resolution of mine was \nthat our system of free public education have a tradition acceptance on a par with our bill of rights and it should have the \nsame Constitutional sanctity. It was because our Constitution had no reference to our school system that I submitted my \nresolution and of course others were aware of the same omission in our Constitution and other similar resolutions were \nsubmitted. I became aware of this in the decade of the fifties when I served on a board of education .... [W]e have [had] \ngood public schools so that this again is not anything revolutionary, it is something which we have, it is which is [in] \npractically all Constitutions in the States of our nation and Connecticut with its great tradition certainly ought to honor this \nprinciple.\" 3 Proceedings, supra, p. 1039. \n[35] The provision when introduced on the convention floor stated: \"No person shall be denied the equal protection of the \nlaw, nor the enjoyment of his civil or political rights, nor be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, \nrace, color, ancestry or national origin.\" Rules Committee Substitute for Constitutional Convention Resolution No. 168, File \nNo. 7. \nThe amendments proposed by Woodhouse and others during the proceedings of the constitutional convention changed the \nprovision to state, as it does today: \"No person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to \nsegregation or discrimination in the exercise of and the enjoyment of his civil or political rights ....\" 2 Proceedings, supra, p. \n690. \n[36] Woodhouse stated: \"It would seem that this language as offered in the amendment is sufficiently general so that it would \nnot be interpreted as an exclusion or limit [on] rights. I think we all realize that rights of individuals in this country have \ndeveloped and have changed from time to time, and we certainly would not want to have in our Constitution any language \nthat would in the future perhaps limit new rights. On the other hand we have to realize that today the philosophy of \nsegregation is something that is in the minds of all of us. It would be regrettable if it should be in any way suggested that this \nConstitution did not unequivocally oppose the philosophy and the practice of segregation.\" 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 691. \nThese sentiments were echoed by Kennelly, who stated: \"It is further a broad statement of principle that is all inclusive and \nwould provide a complete umbrella for the total protection against discrimination and ... segregation, which is sound \nsymbolic language.\" 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 692. \nMary B. Griswold remarked on the same issue that \"it was very important to have the word segregation in our new amended \nbill of rights\" and Meade H. Alcorn remarked that \"the amendment offered this morning is a worthy addition to\" the provision. \n2 Proceedings, supra, pp. 693-94. \n\n[37] We note that at the time of the constitutional convention of 1965, it was jurisprudentially unclear whether the principles \nenunciated in Brown v. Board of Education, supra, 347 U.S. 483, would be limited to de jure segregation in the public schools. \nSee Booker v. Board of Education, 45 N.J. 161, 168-70, 212 A.2d 1 (1965); see also Jenkins v. Township of Morris School District, 58 \nN.J. 483, 497-98, 279 A.2d 619 (1971) (comparing lower federal court cases decided between 1966 and 1971 with United \nStates Supreme Court cases decided in 1971). \n[38] The first count of the plaintiffs' complaint claims: \"Separate educational systems for minority and non-minority students \nare inherently unequal. \n\"Because of the de facto racial and ethnic segregation between Hartford and the suburban districts, the defendants have \nfailed to provide the plaintiffs with an equal opportunity to a free public education as required by [a]rticle [f]irst, §§ 1 and 20, \nand [a]rticle [e]ighth, § 1, of the Connecticut [c]onstitution, to the grave injury of the plaintiffs.\" \n[39] The second count of the plaintiffs' complaint claims: \"Separate educational systems for minority and non-minority \nstudents in fact provide to all students, and have provided to plaintiffs, unequal educational opportunities. \n\"Because of the racial and ethnic segregation that exists between Hartford and the suburban districts, perpetuated by the \ndefendants and resulting in serious harm to the plaintiffs, the defendants have discriminated against the plaintiffs and have \nfailed to provide them with an equal opportunity to a free public education as required by [a]rticle [f]irst, §§ 1 and 20, and \n[a]rticle [e]ighth, § 1[,] of the Connecticut [c]onstitution.\" \n[40] Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, this is not a case in which further briefing was required. Unlike the cases on \nwhich the dissent relies, the constitutional provisions that are crucial to our holding have been at center stage in this case \nsince its inception. It cannot come as a surprise to anyone that this litigation is grounded on the interrelationship between \narticle first, §§ 1 and 20, and article eighth, § 1. \n[41] The plaintiffs have abandoned the claim contained in the fourth and last count of their complaint. See footnote 13. \nSignificantly, the plaintiffs have never claimed, either at trial or in this court, that the state has deprived them of a \nsubstantially equal educational opportunity by reason of the funding that the state provides to supplement the Hartford \nproperty tax. Specifically, the plaintiffs have never argued that the funding provided by the state does not sufficiently balance \nany deficiency in the funding provided through the local property tax. See Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 633. The parties \nstipulated that the state formula for distributing state aid to local school districts \"provide[s] the most state aid to the neediest \nschool districts.\" \n[42] We take judicial notice; see Joe's Pizza, Inc. v. Aetna Life & Casually Co., 236 Conn. 863, 873 n.14, 675 A.2d 441 \n(1996); Stamford Hospital v. Vega, 236 Conn. 646, 655 n.8, 674 A.2d 821 (1996); of the statistics compiled by the Hartford board of \neducation pursuant to General Statutes § 10-220 (c). Hartford School District Strategic School District Profile (1994-95). \n[43] This finding has proven to be accurate. As we have noted previously, in the 1994-95 school year, the percentage of \nminority students enrolled in the Hartford public school system increased to nearly 95 percent. \n[1] I also agree that this case is justiciable and one which requires judicial intervention to assure that the state constitutional \nrights of schoolchildren are protected. In this case, as in Nielsen v. State, 236 Conn. 1, 13-14, 670 A.2d 1288 (1996) (Berdon, \nJ., concurring), and Horton v. Meskill, 172 Conn. 615, 650-51, 376 A.2d 359 (1977),\"the constitution directs the legislature to act in \norder to implement the respective constitutional provisions.\" Nielsen v. State, supra, 13-14. As this court recognized \nin Horton, we have jurisdiction to compel the legislature to act in those situations in which it fails to carry out its constitutional \nmandate. \"We have a constitutional obligation to keep the doors of this court open in order to enforce our laws.... We cannot \nexcuse the legislature's default by merely labeling it a political question and thereby rendering the issue nonjusticiable. Nor \nis it appropriate for us to conclude that the only remedy available to the people is at the polling booth by `kicking the rascals \nout.' Our democracy depends in part on the willingness of the courts to enforce uniformly our constitutional law. We cannot \nbe selective and choose to enforce some provisions, while turning our backs on others. Indeed, as Chief Justice Peters \nwrote in dissent, `[w]hatever the reasons may be, legislative inaction does not, to my mind, relieve this court of its \nindependent duty to vindicate the constitutional rights of those who appear before us.' Pellegrino v. O'Neill, 193 Conn. 670, \n695, 480 A.2d 476, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984).\" Nielsen v. State, supra, 16 (Berdon, \nJ., concurring). Furthermore, I agree that the state's failure to act and to remedy the inequalities and inadequacies of public \neducation constitutes state action. Horton v. Meskill, supra, 172 Conn. 648-49; see Moore v. Ganim, 233 Conn. 557, 595-96, 660 \nA.2d 742 (1995). The state did not deliberately establish a segregated school system. The state, however, chose to discharge \nits constitutional obligation of providing public education by establishing school districts according to town boundaries; \nGeneral Statutes § 10-240; and by requiring schoolchildren to attend the public schools located within the district wherein \nthey reside. General Statutes § 10-184. Moreover, the state is aware that such a statutory scheme is producing segregated \n\nschool systems. Indeed, the trial court found that \"[t]he single most important factor that contributed to the present \nconcentration of racial and ethnic minorities in Hartford was the town-school district system which has existed since 1909....\" \nEven in the face of federalism, legislative inaction amounts to state action. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 570, 84 S. Ct. 1362, \n12 L. Ed. 2d 506, reh. denied, 379 U.S. 870, 85 S. Ct. 12, 13 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1964) (\"[l]egislative inaction coupled with the \nunavailability of any political or judicial remedy, had resulted, with the passage of years, in the perpetuated scheme \nbecoming little more than an irrational anachronism\"). \n[2] It is correct that at oral argument, as the Chief Justice notes, the plaintiffs acknowledged that their argument before the \ntrial court did not focus on the claim that racial and ethnic segregation deprives schoolchildren of a constitutionally mandated \nadequate education. Paragraph three of the third count of the complaint, however, expressly alleges: \"[T]he State of \nConnecticut, by tolerating school districts sharply separated along racial, ethnic, and economic lines, has deprived the \nplaintiffs and other Hartford children of their rights to an equal educational opportunity, and to a minimally adequate \neducation.\" (Emphasis added.) Further, in that portion of the third count of the complaint captioned \"Legal Claims,\" the \nplaintiffs claim that the Hartford school district maintained by the state \"fails to provide a majority of Hartford schoolchildren \nwith a minimally adequate education....\" (Emphasis added.) \nAlthough the trial court found that the schoolchildren are receiving a minimally adequate education, I would conclude, on the \nbasis of the entire record in this case, that that conclusion was clearly erroneous. The trial court specifically found, and as I \nhereinafter set forth in this concurrence: \"Education in its fullest sense for both white and minority school children involves \ninterracial and multiethnic exposure to each other and interaction between them, because racial and ethnic isolation has \nnegative effects on both groups.\" Furthermore, any finding that the children of Hartford are receiving an adequate academic \neducation is belied by their test scores. But equally important, as I have indicated in this concurrence, education is more \nthan what can be measured by mastery test results in reading, writing and arithmetic. \nWhether viewed as a separate constitutional ground for requiring the state to remedy the present segregated educational \nsystem or as the product of the current segregation that deprives Hartford's schoolchildren of an equal educational \nopportunity, the impact of racial and ethnic segregation on the quality of education is an important factor to consider in \ndeciding this case. \n[3] \"It is a duty not imposed by constitutional provision, but has always been assumed by the State; not only because the \neducation of youth is a matter of great public utility, but also and chiefly because it is one of great public necessity for the \nprotection and welfare of the State itself. In the performance of this duty, the State maintains and supports at great expense, \nand with an ever watchful solicitude, public schools throughout its territory, and secures to its youth the privilege of \nattendance therein.\" Bissell v. Davison, supra, 65 Conn. 191. \n[4] As stipulated, statistics compiled for the 1987-88 academic year reveal that, with the exception of Bloomfield and \nWindsor, in which 69 percent and 30 percent of their student bodies respectively were minority, Hartford's neighboring \nschool districts educated a nominal number of minority students: 3.8 percent of Avon's student population was minority; 7.7 \npercent of Farmington's student population was minority; 5.4 percent of Glastonbury's student population was minority; 6.4 \npercent of Newington's student population was minority; 3.3 percent of Wethersfield's student population was minority; and \n15.7 percent of West Hartford's student population was minority. \n[5] With respect to the more current statistics for the 1994-95 academic year, I, like the majority, take judicial notice of the \n\"Strategic School District Profile,\" designed by the Connecticut state department of education for the Hartford public schools. \n[6] See footnote 1. \n[7] The following findings of the trial court make it clear that the decision of the court today was foreshadowed: \n\"On January 6, 1993, the eleventh day of the trial, Governor [Lowell P.] Weicker, [Jr.] in his message to the legislature ... \nnoted the positive aspects of Connecticut's educational system, such as the fact that the state had the highest teacher \nsalaries and the best teacher-student ratio in the nation as well as one of the highest rankings among the states in per pupil \nspending. \n\"He also acknowledged that the racial and economic isolation in the state's school system was `indisputable' and whether it \nhad come about `through the chance of historical boundaries or economic forces beyond the control of the state or whether \nit came about through private decisions or in spite of the best educational efforts of the state, what matters is that it is here \nand must be dealt with.' ... \n\"He then proceeded to outline legislative proposals for six educational regions, the development by each region of a five \nyear plan proposed by local and regional representative groups to reduce racial isolation, and `to provide all students with a \n\nquality, integrated learning experience,' and emphasized the fact that `[l]ocal decisions and local involvement will guide the \nprocess.' ... \n\"On June 28, 1993, [No. 93-263 of the 1993 Public Acts] (now codified as General Statutes §§ 10-264a to 10-264b) entitled \n`An Act Improving Educational Quality and Diversity' was signed by the governor. The Act provided a timetable beginning on \nJanuary 15, 1994, for the convening of local and regional `forums' for the purpose of developing regional `education and \ncommunity improvement plans' which were to be voted on by each of eleven regions in the state. \n\"Thereafter, the plaintiffs, at the direction of the trial court, amended the complaint to state that Governor Weicker, `in \nresponse to this law suit ... called on the legislature to address \"[t]he racial and economic isolation in Connecticut's school \nsystem,\" and the related educational inequities in Connecticut's schools.' \n\"Paragraph 66b [of the plaintiffs' complaint] stated that `[a]s in the past, the legislature failed to act effectively in response to \nthe Governor's call for school desegregation initiatives [and instead], a voluntary desegregation planning bill was passed, \nP.A. 93-263, which contains no racial or poverty concentration goals, no guaranteed funding, no provisions for educational \nenhancements for city schools, and no mandates for local compliance.'\" \n[8] I would not, however, reach the conclusion, which the Chief Justice does in the majority opinion, that poverty under our \nstate constitution is not a suspect classification entitled to heightened judicial review. Although a reference to the state \nconstitution was made in Moscone v. Manson, 185 Conn. 124, 130, 440 A.2d 848 (1981),wherein this court recognized that \nfederal law did not provide heightened review concerning classifications predicated on poverty, no independent analysis was \nundertaken with respect to the state constitution. Because, as the majority recognizes, Hartford schoolchildren labor under a \ndual burden of both poverty and racial and ethnic segregation, the question of whether poverty constitutes a suspect \nclassification under the state constitution need not be reached. \n[1] I recognize the seriousness of these criticisms of the majority opinion, and it pains me to express them. I do so only \nbecause, in my view, the adjudicative process by which the majority's decision has been reached is so seriously flawed, \nbecause the opinion departs so radically from how this case was tried in the trial court and was briefed and argued on \nappeal, and because the resulting analysis so completely disregards the previously established principles governing the \nissues in the case, that I can come to no other conclusions. \n[2] The trial court specifically found that education \"in its fullest sense\" for all schoolchildren involves interracial and \nmultiethnic exposure to each other and interaction between them, because racial and ethnic isolation has negative effects \non both groups. Our state constitution, however, guarantees students a substantially equal educational opportunity; Horton \nI, supra, 172 Conn. 615; not education \"in its fullest sense,\" and neither the plaintiffs nor the majority claim otherwise. \nMoreover, as the trial court found and as the defendants note in their brief in this court, \"the state has had and continues to \nhave as a long-standing goal the reduction of racial and ethnic concentrations of students, and has implemented ... \nnumerous programs and initiatives... precisely to encourage this result. The defendants have always believed that all of our \ncitizens benefit from integrated schools in an integrated society.\" This long-standing state commitment to, and effort to \nachieve, the racial and ethnic integration of our schools is demonstrated by a host of statutory, funding and administrative \nprograms and policies, and is not disputed by the plaintiffs or the majority. \nThe trial court specifically found, for instance, that Connecticut is one of only three states that has voluntarily adopted \nlegislation designed to promote integration of the schools, and is one of only seven states that expend funds on programs to \nintegrate the schools without a court order. In 1969, the state enacted No. 773 of the 1969 Public Acts entitled \"An Act \nConcerning Racial Imbalance in the Public Schools,\" now codified at General Statutes § 10-226a et seq., which requires \nschool districts to maintain student populations that reflect the racial makeup of the student population in the district. The \nstate department of education has consistently and vigorously enforced this legislation. \nOn an interdistrict basis, the state has, for more than twenty-five years, helped to fund Project Concern, one of the nation's \nfirst voluntary interdistrict programs designed to promote the integration of the schools. In addition, the state supplies \ntechnical assistance and funds for constructing interdistrict magnet schools, and has established the Interdistrict \nCooperative Grant Program, which encourages the interdistrict placement of students. General Statutes § 10-74d. In 1993, \nthe state enacted No. 93-263 of the 1993 Public Acts entitled \"An Act Improving Educational Quality and Diversity,\" now \ncodified at General Statutes § 10-264a et seq. This act establishes regional advisory boards to plan for increased \ninterdistrict diversity and provides grants to fund such plans. \nFurthermore, since 1979, the state's educational funding formula has been weighted in favor of districts with high \nconcentrations of poor students, and since 1989 the formula has provided additional funds for remedial educational \nprograms. The purpose and effect of the formula is to provide the most state aid to the neediest school districts. Indeed, in \nthe 1991-92 school year, the state provided $4915 perpupil in educational aid to Hartford, representing more than two and \none-half times the average per pupil aid provided to the twenty-one suburban towns with which the Hartford school district is \n\ncompared in this case. In addition, the state provides funds, calculated according to the financial need of the recipient school \ndistricts, for school construction, student transportation and special education. \nMoreover, the department of education has established a Priority School District Program, which targets the eight largest \ncities in the state, including Hartford, for improvement of student achievement and enhancement of educational \nopportunities. In 1992, the department established an Office of Urban and Priority School Districts, the purpose of which is \n\"`to concentrate the resources of the department on the problems of the cities, and more specifically to improve the \nachievement of students in the three largest urban districts,'\" including Hartford. \nI do not, by recounting these state policies and programs, suggest that the state is doing everything possible to solve the \nterribly difficult problem of racial and ethnic concentration in our public schools. There undoubtedly is more that can and \nshould be done. I recount these steps only to underscore that the goal of achieving integrated schools is shared by the state, \nwhich neither the plaintiffs nor the majority dispute. \n[3] I am puzzled by the majority's facile and unexplained reference to the \"racial and ethnic divide.\" (Emphasis added.) I am \ncertainly aware of the history of racial discrimination in this nation, although it must be said that, in this state, such \ndiscrimination has never been state sponsored or maintained, and that our state has a long tradition of legal hostility to \nprivate racial discrimination. I am also aware of the current, and past, pattern of difficulties between whites and blacks; no \none who lives, works, reads and watches television could be unaware of that pattern in the nation at large and in this state \nas well. This pattern of difficulties is what I understand the term \"racial divide\" to mean. \nI am unaware, however, of an \"ethnic divide,\" at least in our state, that is analogous or similar to the racial divide between \nwhites and blacks. I am unaware of any similar history of ethnic discrimination in this state—private or public—or of any \npattern of difficulties between any particular ethnic groups. The majority assumes, apparently, although it does not appear in \nthis record, that there is such a pattern, amounting to a divide, between Hispanics and—what? other ethnic groups? \"whites\" \nof other ethnic groups? African-Americans? Asian-Americans? \nIt is true that, historically, various ethnic groups have, at various times, either sought to assimilate themselves into our state's \nculture, or to add to that culture in a different way, namely, by eschewing assimilation and maintaining their ethnic language \nand customs, or by a combination of both. I have not thought, however, that this process constituted an \"ethnic divide\" that \nrequired a constitutional cure. \nThus, the majority apparently is aware of a social phenomenon that escapes both this record and me. The reference to \n\"ethnic divide\" may sound politically correct—although I doubt even that, in today's climate that celebrates cultural diversity \nrather than ethnic assimilation—but its meaning is a mystery to me. \n[4] Similarly, equally bereft of factual support in this record, and equally contradicted by the factual findings of the trial court, \nare the majority's references to \"the severe handicaps that burden these children's education\" as a result of their racial and \nethnic isolation; \"the educational impairment that results from segregation in the Hartford public schools\"; and the \"pervasive \nand invidious impact on schools\" resulting from that isolation. \n[5] L. Pirandello, Six Characters in Search of an Author (1922). \n[6] Although this case involves only the school districts of the greater Hartford area, no one can pretend that the \nconstitutional violation found by the majority does not also directly apply to the school districts of the greater New Haven and \nBridgeport areas, and perhaps other urban school districts as well. Furthermore, although the majority does not address \nthem, the necessary implications of the majority opinion must also apply to everyschool district in the state, as I discuss later \nin this dissent. \n[7] Because I agree with the majority that the plaintiffs' claims are justiciable and that there is state action, I do not address \npart II of the majority opinion. My discussion, therefore, is confined to part III of the majority opinion, which addresses the \nmerits of the constitutional claim of a deprivation of equal educational opportunity, and part IV, which addresses the issue of \na remedy for the deprivation that the majority finds. \n[8] For ease of reference throughout this opinion, the claims are listed in the order in which they were presented in the \nplaintiffs' appeal to this court, which is not the same as the order in which they appeared in the complaint. Substantively, \nhowever, there is no difference between the two sets of claims. \n[9] It is difficult for me to square the plaintiffs' claim that the Hartford school district suffers from a deprivation of educational \nresources, relative to those of the surrounding districts, with the plaintiffs' simultaneous and consistent insistence that this is \nnot a school funding case, as was Horton I. Because resources are directly tied to funding, it is obvious to me that, at least \n\nto the extent that their constitutional claim rests on a disparity in resources, it comes squarely within the rubric of Horton \nI and, therefore, would also be subject to the same requirements of proof as are required under that rubric, namely, that the \nquality of education is diminished because of the diminished resources made available. See Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 637-38. \nNonetheless, I am satisfied that my difficulty is resolved because the trial court found as a matter of fact that the disparities \nin educational resources claimed by the plaintiffs do not exist, and that finding is supported by the evidence. \n[10] The plaintiffs have never claimed, either in the trial court or this court, that economic status—their concentration of \npoverty—alone entitles them to relief in this case. \n[11] I regret that my discussion of the trial court record is as lengthy and detailed as it is. It is because, however, the majority \nhas so dramatically altered the nature of the claims presented to the trial court and to this court, and in doing so has so \nplainly ignored the voluminous trial court proceedings to the contrary, that the length and detail is necessary. \n[12] The plaintiffs had brought this action in May, 1989. After the defendants had unsuccessfully challenged by motion \ncertain aspects of the plaintiffs' claims, the case was tried for approximately eleven weeks in late 1992 and early 1993. \nThereafter, in November, 1994, the plaintiffs filed their revised complaint, upon which the case was to be decided by the trial \ncourt. \nIn April, 1995, the trial court issued its memorandum of decision, the gravamen of which was that the plaintiffs had not \nestablished the requisite state action as the cause of the conditions of which they complained. Accordingly, the court \nrendered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiffs promptly appealed. Before any briefs were filed in this court, we held a \nspecial session in order to ensure that the record would contain all the factual findings necessary to a full consideration and \ndetermination of the appeal. Thereafter, on May 11, 1995, we remanded the case to the trial court for supplemental findings \nof fact, based on the understandings that (1) there were considerable areas of factual agreement between the parties, and \n(2) there were also considerable areas of factual disagreement that had been litigated during the eleven weeks of trial. Thus, \nwe ordered that: (1) to the extent that the parties agreed on certain facts, they present those facts by way of stipulation to \nthe trial court for its approval; (2) to the extent that they disagreed on facts, each side present to the trial court a proposed \nfinding of facts that it claimed to have proven; and (3) the trial court issue its finding of facts to resolve the disputed facts as \ndisclosed by the parties' proposed findings of fact. As indicated later in this dissent, the parties and the trial court complied \nwith our remand. \n[13] The plaintiffs stated: \"Article First, Section 20, which was adopted in 1965 ... expressly prohibits both segregation as \nwell as discrimination. And notice the Constitution does not say `de jure segregation.' It says `segregation.' This is a de facto \nsegregation case ... and de facto segregation is a form of segregation....\" \n\"The complaint ... has four counts. The first count basically says that de facto segregation is inherently unequal. And this \ndraws on Brown v. Board of Education, [374 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954)], that separate but equal is inherently \nunequal. \n\"Now ... we tend to forget, when we're just thinking about this first count, that slavery, even in Connecticut, was not \ncompletely abolished until the end of the Civil War. And I'm saying Connecticut, not the South. In Connecticut it was legal \nuntil that time. So, to perpetuate—and for the state to say there's nothing wrong with a virtually all minority school system \nsimply perpetuates this badge of inferiority, and it does so in two ways. \"First of all, poor minorities have no opportunity to \ninteract with the white population. And the other side is, the white population has no opportunity to interact with them, and so \nit just means more racial stereotypes and economic stereotypes on both sides. \n\"More fundamentally ... because the Equal Protection Clause expressly prohibits segregation, what difference does it make \nwhat the evidence shows about its effects? It's illegal, regardless of what the effects of integration are. Integration is required \nas a matter of principle by the Connecticut Constitution, and that should be the end of that. \n\"So, Your Honor, as we present evidence over the next few weeks, on the second through the fourth counts of the complaint \nabout the ill effects of segregation, Your Honor should not lose sight of the first count, for the first count requires no evidence \nother than the fact of segregation....\" \nIt is true that, as this transcript indicates, the plaintiffs initially analogize the first count to the concept of inherent inequality \nderived from the principle of \"separate but equal\" that the United States Supreme Court condemned in Brown v. Board of \nEducation, supra, 347 U.S. 495. It cannot be tenably maintained, however, that these few oral statements, taken in their \nimmediate context and in the context of all of the subsequent instances in which the plaintiffs articulated their claims to the \ntrial court and this court, support the reading of the plaintiffs' claim of equal educational opportunity created by the majority. \nIndeed, I do not read even the majority opinion to rest on the extravagant claim—wholly unsupported by any evidence in this \nrecord—that the feelings of inferiority inflicted on the schoolchildren in Brown by the state mandated separation of the races \n\nis present in any of these plaintiffs as a result of demographic factors over which the state has no control. As I discuss later \nin this dissent, moreover, Brown is not pertinent here generally; and even the badge of inferiority rightfully condemned \nin Brown rested on evidence in and findings of the Brown trial court, both of which are significantly absent from this record. \nMoreover, and \"more fundamentally,\" as the plaintiffs put it to the trial court, their claim under the first count rested, not on \nany such considerations, but on the meaning of \"segregation\" in article first, § 20. I also discuss the merits of that claim later \nin this dissent. \n[14] The plaintiffs stated: \"[T]he second count has to do with whether or not segregation is unequal as a matter of fact, \nwhether racial and economic isolation is unequal as a matter of fact. Now ... our proof ... [will show] the facts of racial \nisolation, [combined] with high concentration of poverty, combined with inadequate resources.\" \n[15] The plaintiffs claim that \"the extreme levels of racial and economic segregation in Hartford, along with well-documented \ndeficiencies and disparities in educational resources and outcomes, violate plaintiffs' fundamental right to equal educational \nopportunity.\" (Emphasis added.) In discussing this claim, the plaintiffs referred to the testimony of many witnesses to \nbuttress their position that they were not receiving an equal educational opportunity. They argued that the racial and ethnic \nisolation in the Hartford schools, combined with the inadequate and unequal educational conditions, deprived them of an \nequal educational opportunity. They stated: \"In light of the severe educational inequities imposed on a student population \nalready suffering serious harms from extreme levels of racial and economic isolation, it cannot be claimed that plaintiffs and \nother Hartford students are receiving equal educational opportunity.\" (Emphasis added.) In their posttrial reply brief, the \nplaintiffs identified \"[t]he central issue before this court [as] whether the most racially and economically isolated children in \nthe state who are performing the worst academically with the least amount of resources are entitled to judicial protection to \nensure that their constitutional right to [an] equal educational opportunity is realized.\" (Emphasis added.) \nIn their closing oral arguments to the trial court, the plaintiffs again made clear the factual basis of their equal educational \nopportunity claim. They argued that the effect of three factors, taken together—racial isolation, concentration of poverty and \ninadequate resources—deprives them of an equal educational opportunity. Later, they quoted from their posttrial brief: \"The \nfacts are that Hartford children go to school in poverty-concentrated and racially isolated schools without resources. Even for \nhigh-achieving students, the system's racial isolation and the inadequate resources have harmful effects .... Plaintiffs \npresented evidence on the long term effects of poverty concentration, racial segregation, and inadequate levels of \nresources, as well as the educational inequities separating Hartford and its neighboring districts.\" (Emphasis added.) \n[16] The plaintiffs claim that \"the extreme levels of racial segregation in the Hartford area constitute a per se violation of \nArticle I and Article VIII.\" They did not phrase this claim in terms of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity. They \nclaimed that the insertion of the term \"segregation\" in article first, § 20, provided an \"independent basis\" upon which they \nshould prevail. \nIn their closing oral arguments, the plaintiffs again distinguished their equal educational opportunity claim from their per se \nsegregation claim. Their counsel stated: \"I spent a lot of time on the term segregation and discrimination in article first, § 20, \nand I just want to make it clear that our primary argument is under Horton v. Meskill [and the] equal protection clause in its \ntraditional sense, plus article eight, § 1, namely every student in the state is entitled to an equal educational opportunity.\" \nLater, they reiterated that their per se segregation claim differed from their equal educational opportunity claim: \"Under our \nfirst count, the racial segregation itself violates article first, § 20 of the Connecticut constitution in the exercise of the \nfundamental right to education.\" \n[17] Our May 11, 1995 order directed the parties to \"identify, by appropriate headings, those legal claims presented to the \ntrial court....\" The plaintiffs listed 121 disputed facts that they claimed to have proven in the trial court, under the heading, \n\"Does the Racial, Ethnic and Economic Isolation and Poverty Concentration Coupled with Disparities in Resources and \nOutcomes Violate Plaintiff's Right to Equal Educational Opportunities Under Article Eighth, Section 1 and Article First, \nSections 1 and 20?\" Those 121 claimed facts are grouped under subheadings that involve matters such as: the \nsocioeconomic status of the Hartford metropolitan area students; the links between racial and economic isolation; the effects \nof integration; the disparities in educational resources between the Hartford and suburban districts, including staffing and \ncurriculum, instructional services, supplies, library resources, equipment, and plants and facilities; and the disparities \nbetween the Hartford and suburban districts in educational outcomes, including mastery test scores, credits earned, \nscholastic aptitude test scores, graduation and drop-out rates, and patterns of postsecondary activities. These are the facts \nthat the plaintiffs sought to have the trial court find in support of their constitutional claim that they have been deprived of an \nequal educational opportunity. \n[18] The court also found that two other factors that generally explain any poorer performance of minority students, namely, \nthe failure of a school system to offer culturally sensitive programs and patterns of institutional discrimination reflecting \ndiscrimination in society as a whole, are not present in and do not apply to the Hartford public schools. \n\n[19] In contrast, the second claim, that of per se segregation, is a purely legal claim, resting solely on the meaning of the \nterm \"segregation\" in article first, § 20, as applied to the right to a free public education guaranteed by article eighth, § 1, of \nthe state constitution. This claim, unlike the claims of a lack of an equal educational opportunity and a lack of a minimally \nadequate education, rests solely on the undisputed facts of racial and ethnic concentration. Under this claim, and only under \nthis claim, the plaintiffs argue that the term \"segregation\" as applied to education includes de facto racial and ethnic \nconcentration to the degree present in the Hartford schools. Moreover, the plaintiffs' briefs make clear that this legal claim is \nseparate and distinct from the claims of a deprivation of an equal educational opportunity and of a deprivation of a minimally \nadequate education, and has nothing to do with such deprivations. \n[20] The plaintiffs follow this introduction with an explanatory footnote so that we would have no trouble understanding their \nargument, relating the counts of their complaint specifically to their issues raised on appeal. They state as follows in page 1, \nfootnote 1, of their appellate brief: \"The Complaint is in [three] counts: first, that because Hartford metropolitan area schools \nare segregated on the basis of race, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status, and because the Hartford schools are \neducationally deficient when compared to the suburban schools, defendants have failed to provide plaintiffs an equal \nopportunity to a free public education as required by Article First, §§ 1 and 20 and Article Eighth, § 1 of the Connecticut \nConstitution, (Issue II on appeal); second, that the sharp segregation on the basis of race and ethnic background in Hartford \nmetropolitan area public schools, by itself, violates Article First, §§ 1 and 20 and Article Eighth, § 1 of the Connecticut \nConstitution, (Issue III on appeal); third, that the Hartford public schools are educationally deficient and fail to provide a \nmajority of Hartford schoolchildren with a minimally adequate education, measured by the state's own standards, and this \nviolates Article First, §§ 1 and 20 and Article Eighth, § 1, (now Issue IV)....\" (Emphasis added.) \n[21] Because the majority did not address the plaintiffs' claim of a deprivation of a minimally adequate education, I do not \naddress that claim in this part of this dissent, and do so later in my consideration of the plaintiffs' claims as they are properly \nbefore us. \n[22] In light of the plaintiffs' repeated insistence that this is not a school funding case, however, this reference to Horton I can \nonly be understood as an argument that the reasoning of Horton I, transplanted from the realm of financing inequities to the \nrealm of racial and ethnic concentration, applies to this case. The plaintiffs' subsequent discussion bears out this \nunderstanding. \n[23] The plaintiffs assert: \"The court below erroneously found that students in the Hartford metropolitan area are provided \nequal educational opportunities.\" In support of this assertion, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court \"committed error by \ncompletely bypassing analysis of disparities in the provision of materials, books and supplies and course offerings, by \nsimilarly neglecting the wide disparity in test scores, and by disregarding the impact of racial and ethnic isolation and the \nconcentration of poverty in reaching [its] conclusion.\" (Emphasis added.) Indeed, in the trial court the plaintiffs had presented \nexpert testimony regarding the educational impact of racial and ethnic isolation, and the plaintiffs complain in this court that \nthe trial court was required to find accordingly because, in the plaintiffs' view, there was \"no evidence in the record to show \nthat all of the plaintiffs' experts were unworthy of belief.\" \nIn the same vein, the plaintiffs continue their attack on the trial court's findings regarding the quality of the education \nprovided to the plaintiffs by referring back to a detailed summary of their evidence in the trial court. At pages 7 through 24 of \ntheir appellate brief, under the heading \"Unequal and Inadequate Education,\" the plaintiffs present a detailed summary of \ntheir trial court evidence that, they maintain, demonstrates as a factual matter that they are being deprived of an equal \neducational opportunity as a result of their racial and ethnic isolation. This factual recitation further demonstrates that the \nplaintiffs' claim regarding an equal educational opportunity rests on a factual matrix that combines the racial and ethnic \nisolation of the Hartford district, the claimed economic plight of the district and the educational deficiencies claimed to result \nfrom that isolation and plight. \n[24] In their reply brief, the plaintiffs state: \"The trial court ... succumbed to [an] error of law by failing to consider the totality \nof circumstances facing Hartford schoolchildren and how racial segregation, the concentration of poor children in the \nschools, and disparities in educational resources, including facilities and equipment, among other things, deprive children of \nsubstantially equal educational opportunities. Notwithstanding defendants' portrayal, this case is not simply about the \nextreme racial isolation of the Hartford schools, although that, too, is a ground for relief. Neither is the case solely about the \ndeficiencies in educational resources or the vast differences in educational outcomes. The plaintiffs' claim of denial of equal \neducational opportunity is about all of these harms together, just as they are experienced every day in the \nclassroom.\" (Emphasis added.) \n[25] I can find nothing in this voluminous record to support this assertion of the majority, insofar as it purports to refer to the \nclaim of equal educational opportunity. Indeed, the majority does not, because it cannot, quote or summarize any part of this \nrecord that supports the assertion. Moreover, the assertion is curious, to say the least, because the majority does not state \nthat the theory of equal educational opportunity that it has created wasbriefed in the trial court or this court. Rather, the \nmajority asserts that \"[t]he constitutional implications\" of that theory were addressed. I do not know what that means. \n\nIt may refer to the fact that the parties fully briefed and argued the question of the meaning of \"segregation\" in article first, § \n20. The parties addressed that issue, however, as part of the plaintiffs' per se segregation claim, which the plaintiffs \nthemselves had separated from their equal educational opportunity claim. To the extent that this legal issue is in the case \nunder that rubric, however, I acknowledge that it has been fully addressed by the parties. In my view, that does not \nsubstitute for giving the parties an opportunity to address its consequences for a claim, based on Horton I, that the plaintiffs \nhave been deprived of an equal educational opportunity. \n[26] The majority also asks whether the plaintiffs' pleadings \"fairly can be read to encompass such a challenge.\" It concludes \nthat \"the plaintiffs can succeed if any of their claims falls within the constitutional right as we have defined it.\" (Emphasis \nadded.) \n[27] The majority asserts simply that \"as a pleading matter, [the plaintiffs'] claims were stated in two counts rather than in \none.\" On the contrary, the majority has taken two separate and independent claims, chopped them up and recombined them \ninto a third, and different, claim that no one—not even the plaintiffs—had ever made. \n[28] In numerous other passages, the court in Horton I emphasized the factual, causal connection between per pupil \nexpenditure and quality of education. See Horton I, supra, 172 Conn. 638 (\"that variations in money available to different towns \nproduce variations in quality of instruction; that the financing system discriminates against pupils in Canton because the \nbreadth and quality of the education they receive is to a substantial degree narrower and lower than that which pupils \nreceive in comparable towns with larger tax bases and a greater ability to finance education\"); id., 645 (\"The wealth \ndiscrimination found among school districts differs materially from the usual equal protection case where a fairly defined \nindigent class suffers discrimination to its peculiar disadvantage. The discrimination is relative rather than absolute. Further, \nthe children living in towns with relatively low assessable property values are afforded public education but, as the trial court \nfound, the education they receive is to a substantial degree narrower and lower in quality than that which pupils receive in \ncomparable towns with a larger tax base and greater ability to finance education. True, the state has mandated local \nprovision for a basic educational program with local option for a program of higher quality but, as the trial court's finding \nindicates, that option to a town which lacks the resources to implement the higher quality educational program which it \ndesires and which is available to property-richer towns is highly illusory.\"); id., 648 (\"The present-day problem arises from \nthe circumstance that over the years there has arisen a great disparity in the ability of local communities to finance local \neducation, which has given rise to a consequent significant disparity in the quality of education available to the youth of the \nstate. It was well stated in the memorandum of decision of the trial court, which noted that the `present method [of financing \neducation in the state] is the result of legislation in which the state delegates to municipalities of disparate financial capability \nthe state's duty of raising funds for operating public schools within that municipality. That legislation gives no consideration \nto the financial capability of the municipality to raise funds sufficient to discharge another duty delegated to the municipality \nby the state, that of educating the children within that municipality. The evidence in this case is that, as a result of this duty-\ndelegating to Canton without regard to Canton's financial capabilities, pupils in Canton receive an education that is in a \nsubstantial degree lower in both breadth and quality than that received by pupils in municipalities with a greater financial \ncapability, even though there is no difference between the constitutional duty of the state to the children in Canton and the \nconstitutional duty of the state to the children in other towns.'\"); id., 652 (\"Obviously, absolute equality or precisely equal \nadvantages are not required and cannot be attained except in the most relative sense. Logically, the state may recognize \ndifferences in educational costs based on relevant economic and educational factors and on course offerings of special \ninterest in diverse communities. None of the basic alternative plans to equalize the ability of various towns to finance \neducation requires that all towns spend the same amount for the education of each pupil. The very uncertainty of the extent \nof the nexus between dollar input and quality of educational opportunity requires allowance for variances as do individual \nand group disadvantages and local conditions.\"). \n[29] In Horton I, supra 172 Conn. 621-22, the defendants unsuccessfully challenged \"the trial court's findings concerning the \nquality of education in Canton and the relation between expenditures and the quality of education.\" \n[30] In this connection, I note that this case also differs markedly from Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, \n98 L. Ed. 873 (1954). I do so only because the majority, although not relying directly on Brown, invokes some of its language \nregarding the importance of education, with which all involved in this case agree. Although Brown involved intentionally \nsegregated schools, which this case does not, and therefore differs in its legal posture, it also differs from this case in a \nsignificant factual respect. \nIn Brown, the decision rested in significant part on the trial court's finding that state-sponsored segregation inflicts feelings of \ninferiority and stigmatization on the African-American students. Id., 494. This was an important part of the foundation for the \nSupreme Court's holding that separate schools are inherently unequal. Id., 495. \nThere is no such finding in the present case. Were there such a finding, this might well be a very different case before us on \nappeal. \n\n[31] The plaintiffs recognize this essential factual underpinning of Horton I. They sought to persuade the trial court of their \nclaimed factual analogues to that underpinning, and they seek to persuade us that the trial court's contrary findings are \nclearly erroneous. The defendants also recognize the critical nature of those factual underpinnings. Only the majority \ninvokes Horton I while simultaneously discarding as irrelevant that essential factual basis. \n[32] Thus, when the majority asserts that the state's constitutional obligation includes the \"duty to remedy the educational \nimpairment that results from [de facto] segregation\"; (emphasis added); the majority ignores the facts of this case. Those \nfacts are that the \"injuries\" of which the plaintiffs complain, namely, the diminished educational opportunities claimed to \nresult from a combination of racial and ethnic concentration and concentration of poverty, do not result therefrom but result \nsolely from poverty. Consequently, the majority is forced to resort to the general effects on education of racial and ethnic \nconcentration, and to elevate those effects to the level of a constitutional mandate. \n[33] Even if this were the defendants' only argument on appeal, moreover, its weakness would not be a sufficient ground on \nwhich the plaintiffs should prevail. An appellant must establish more than that the appellee's argument is weak; the appellant \nmust first establish that its own arguments are persuasive. \n[34] Article first, § 20, was adopted by the convention on October 14, 1965. 2 Proceedings of the Connecticut Constitutional \nConvention of 1965, pp. 754-55. Article eighth, § 1, was adopted by the convention five days later, on October 19, 1965. 3 \nProceedings, supra, p. 1041. \n[35] When first adopted in 1965, article first, § 20, was limited to the protection of the categories of religion, race, color, \nancestry and national origin. Sex and physical or mental disability were added by subsequent constitutional amendments. \nConn. Const., amends. V and XXI. \n[36] The constitution of Connecticut, article third, § 5, as amended by article sixteen of the amendments, provides: \"The \nestablishment of congressional districts and of districts in the general assembly shall be consistent with federal constitutional \nstandards.\" \nThe constitution of Connecticut, article third, § 6, as amended by articles twelfth, sixteenth and twenty-sixth of the \namendments, provides in relevant part: \"a. The assembly and senatorial districts and congressional districts as now \nestablished by law shall continue until the regular session of the general assembly next after the completion of the taking of \nthe next census of the United States. On or before the fifteenth day of February next following the year in which the \ndecennial census of the United States is taken, the general assembly shall appoint a reapportionment committee .... Upon \nthe filing of a report of such committee with the clerk of the house of representatives and the clerk of the senate, the speaker \nof the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate shall, if the general assembly is not in regular \nsession, convene the general assembly in special session for the sole purpose of adopting a plan of districting.... Such \ngeneral assembly shall, upon roll call, by a yea vote of at least two-thirds of the membership of each house, adopt such plan \nof districting as is necessary to preserve a proper apportionment of representation in accordance with the principles recited \nin this article. Thereafter the general assembly shall decennially at its next regular session or special session called for the \npurpose of adopting a plan of districting following the completion of the taking of the census of the United States, upon roll \ncall, by a yea vote of at least two-thirds of the membership of each house, adopt such plan of districting as is necessary in \naccordance with the provisions of this article....\" \n[37] The majority also argues that, because article first, § 20, uses both \"equal protection\" language and the term \n\"segregation,\" that term must be given independent meaning, namely, de facto as well as de jure segregation. This analysis \nalso must mean, therefore, that \"segregation\" has some meaning independent of \"discrimination,\" because: (1) they are \ndifferent words; and (2) during the convention, the word \"segregation\" was reinserted into the text, which already contained \nthe word \"discrimination.\" \n[38] This case demonstrates the point. The majority refers to the plaintiffs as \"African-American,\" \"Latino\" and \"white.\" The \nplaintiffs, in their complaint, refer to themselves as \"black,\" \"Hispanic,\" \"Puerto Rican\" and \"white.\" Do \"black,\" \"white\" and \n\"African-American\" refer to the plaintiffs' race, their color or their national origin? Do \"Hispanic,\" \"Puerto Rican\" and \"Latino\" \nrefer to the plaintiffs' ancestry or their national origin? \nThe same can be said for the subsequent reference to physical or mental disability. Many \"physical\" disabilities carry serious \nemotional consequences with them that may be more disabling than the physical aspects of the condition. Similarly, many \n\"mental\" or emotional disabilities have physical origins. For example, is schizophrenia that is determined to be chemical in \norigin and treatable by drugs a \"physical\" or a \"mental\" disability? \n\n[39] This is precisely the plaintiffs' argument under the first count of their complaint. They stated in the trial court: \"Under our \nfirst count, the racial segregation itself violates article first, § 20 of the Connecticut constitution in the exercise of the \nfundamental right to education.\" (Emphasis added.) \n[40] This finding, which the plaintiffs do not challenge on appeal, was based on the testimony of their own expert witness on \nConnecticut history, Christopher Collier, professor of history at the University of Connecticut and the officially designated \nstate historian for the state of Connecticut. \n[41] Raymond E. Baldwin, Ella T. Grasso, John D. Lodge, Thomas J. Meskill and C. Wilbert. Snow. \n[42] Raymond E. Baldwin, Lawrence J. DeNardis, Ella T. Grasso, John D. Lodge, Edwin H. May, Jr., Thomas J. Meskill, \nHorace Seeley-Brown, Jr., and Chase Going Woodhouse. \n[43] Nicholas B. Eddy, Florence D. Finney, James J. Kennelly and J. Tyler Patterson, Jr. \n[44] Raymond E. Baldwin, Abraham S. Bordon and Patrick B. O'Sullivan. \n[45] That practice in drawing electoral lines persists today. Indeed, we recently held that it was a constitutionally permissible \nfactor for the General Assembly to employ in fulfilling its decennial obligation to reapportion itself. \nSee Fonfara v. Reapportionment Commission, 222 Conn. 166, 610 A.2d 153 (1992). \n[46] One school served a predominantly white area, and the other served a predominantly black area. The plan exchanged, \nby busing, the students in the seventh grade of one school for the students in the eighth grade in the other, thus reducing \nsomewhat the racial imbalance in the area served by the two schools. The plaintiffs claimed that the plan violated General \nStatutes § 10-15, which provided that all schools shall be \"open\" to all children without regard to race or color. \nIn Guida v. Board of Education, 26 Conn. Sup. 121, 123, 213 A.2d 843 (1965), the court upheld the validity of the plan. It held that \nthe plan, which was also aimed at improving the quality of education apart from the racial imbalance factor, was within the \nboard's general statutory powers over education. Id., 124. It held further that, although the desire to reduce racial imbalance \nwas a substantial factor in the formulation of the plan, \"a determination by the board which is otherwise lawful and \nreasonable does not become unlawful merely because the factor of racial imbalance is accorded relevance.\" Id. \n[47] The delegates to the convention were elected from the two major parties and the state's six congressional districts. \nThus, there were fourteen delegates—seven Democrats and seven Republicans—from each of the six districts. The \nfourteen delegates from the district embracing the New Haven area were: Frederick K. Biebel, Jr., George Cahill, Edith \nCook, Daniel O. Cosgrove, Lawrence J. DeNardis, Warren A. Field, James P. Geelan, Mary B. Griswold, William T. \nHolleran, John A. Maresca, Eugene McCabe, Patrick B. O'Sullivan, Arline Ryan and George F. Wright. \n[48] The constitution of Connecticut, article first, § 1, was the same then as it is now. \n[49] The constitution of Connecticut, article first, § 20, then provided: \"No hereditary emoluments, privileges or honors shall \never be granted, or conferred in this state.\" This language is now found in article first, § 18. \n[50] The stated purpose of original Resolution No. 168 was to \"amend the Declaration of Rights in accordance with the \nReport to the General Assembly and the Governor of the Commission on State Government Organization, dated February, \n1950.\" \n[51] Subsequently, what was article first, § 22, in committee resolution 168 became, as later amended on the floor of the \nconvention, article first, § 20. \n[52] \"I should like to point out ... that the word segregation was in the original resolution which I introduced. It was a \nfavorable report of the subcommittee, it was in the favorable report of the full committee. It was not in the substitute \nbill [committee resolution 168] as brought in by the rules committee, so I think the general idea was there. The only question \nthat has arisen is the idea of general language or more specific language. It would seem that this language as offered in the \namendment is sufficiently general so that it would not be interpreted as an exclusion or limit rights.... On the other hand, we \nhave to realize that today the philosophy of segregation is something that is in the minds of all of us. It would be regrettable \nif it should be in any way suggested that this Constitution did not unequivocally oppose the philosophy and the practice of \nsegregation. So I move this amendment as reading very definitely that it in no way limits the rights of anyone. It would not be \nso interpreted by the courts and it strengthens the wording that we have before us in the file.\" (Emphasis added.) 2 \nProceedings, supra, pp. 690-91, remarks of Chase Going Woodhouse. \n\n[53] \"We have spent a lot of time on this particular provision and I want to say that I have no objection. I am perfectly \nagreeable to having this changed. As a matter of fact we discussed this very thing in the committee and we thought that \nsegregation was unnecessary to put in there, but if it will please people, then I am perfectly agreeable to having it there as a \nmember of this convention.\" (Emphasis added.) 2 Proceedings, supra, pp. 691-92, remarks of Raymond Baldwin. \n\"This section would protect political rights such as registration, the voting right to hold public office, the right to assemble and \npetition as well as the traditional rights that we have always protected. It is further a broad statement of principle that is all \ninclusive and would provide a complete umbrella for the total protection against discrimination and the word \nsubjugation against segregation, which is sound symbolic language.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 692, remarks of James J. \nKennelly. \nBaldwin later added, \"[i]n preparing this particular clause to this bill of rights, the subcommittee of the committee made a \nstudy of the existing legislation in Connecticut protecting political and civil rights, and I just want to note for the benefit of the \nrecord, that there is no state in the entire union that has more comprehensive and more liberal legislation with reference to \nthe exercise of political and civil rights, than does the little sovereign State of Connecticut. I am proud to make that \nstatement because this legislation has been the work of successive legislators through several different administrations. I \nthink it should be noted here that if every state in the union had followed Connecticut's lead in dealing with this problem, we \nwould not be having the trouble that we are having in some places today.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., pp. 695-96. \n[54] This conclusion is buttressed by the council's reference to \"`[o]ur history,' \" which in the council's view showed that \n\"`platitudinous phrases have not helped many of our citizens to enjoy specific rights that could not be pointed to implicitly in \nconstitutional authority.'\" J. Zaiman, Hartford Courant, supra, p. 11. The reference to \"`[o]ur history'\" was obviously, not to \nConnecticut's history in particular, but to our nation's history in general and the south in particular, where under the separate \nbut equal doctrine \"many of our citizens [could not] enjoy\" true equality. See id. \n[55] These former justices were described to the convention as \"three of the most distinguished minds not only in this \nconvention, but in the State of Connecticut.\" 2 Proceedings, supra, p. 693, remarks of H. Meade Alcorn. \n[56] Undoubtedly, Baldwin was also referring to other long-standing civil rights legislation in this state. As the trial court found \nin this case, some examples of this include: legislation outlawing racial discrimination in hotels, restaurants, transportation \nfacilities and places of public amusements, which had been in place since 1905, and had been significantly expanded in \n1953 and 1961; legislation outlawing discrimination in public employment, which had been in place since 1936, and had \nbeen expanded to private employment in 1947, and to public housing in 1949; and legislation creating the nation's first civil \nrights commission in 1943. \n[57] Indeed, Bernstein, who introduced the resolution for article eighth, § 1, and who was one of two speakers on the \nquestion, did not mention either Brown or article first, § 20. \n[58] Contrary to the majority's suggestion, moreover, to the extent that the reach of Brown was unclear in 1965, the weight of \nthe available authority, which was confirmed by the United States Supreme Court in 1971; Swann v. Board of Education, 402 \nU.S. 1, 6, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1971); was clearly to the effect that, despite the ruling in Brown, there is no \naffirmative state duty \"`to change innocently arrived at school attendance districts by the mere fact that shifts in population \neither increase or decrease the percentage of either Negro or white pupils.'\" Bell v. School City of Gary, Indiana, 324 F.2d 209, \n213 (7th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 924, 84 S. Ct. 1223, 12 L. Ed. 2d 216 (1964); see also Springfield School \nCommittee v. Barksdale, 348 F.2d 261, 264 (1st Cir. 1965); Downs v. Board of Education, 336 F.2d 988, 998 (10th Cir. 1964), cert. \ndenied, 380 U.S. 914, 85 S. Ct. 898, 13 L. Ed. 2d 800 (1965); Blocker v. Board of Education, 226 F. Sup. 208, 230 (E.D.N.Y. 1964). \nThe two cases that the majority cites for such speculative reliance by the convention delegates do not support \nit. Bookerv. Board of Education, 45 N.J. 161, 177-78, 212 A.2d 1 (1965), holds that the New Jersey commissioner of education \nhas authority to reduce de facto segregation on the basis of state law and policy. Jenkins v. Township of Morris School \nDistrict, 58 N.J. 483, 497-98, 279 A.2d 619 (1971), while holding the same, collects cases from 1966, not 1965. \n[59] I recognize that my comments in this respect are premised on the notion that the majority's interpretation of article first, \n§ 20, constitutes a significant change from preexisting interpretations of that article, even in the educational context, and \neven giving due regard to the difference in language between the federal equal protection provision and this article. This \npremise is valid, nonetheless, particularly because the majority's analysis rests on the concurrent proposition that \"because \nof and \"segregation\" have dual meanings: one when applied to education under article eighth, § 1; and an opposite one \nwhen applied to all other civil and political rights. Given this premise, one would have expected some comment explicating \nthe startling linguistic and jurisprudential path by which the majority has read the two provisions together. \n[60] For example, the plaintiffs presented William Gordon as an expert in, among other things, \"desegregation planning, \ndesegregation techniques and equity analysis.\" He testified that he had never \"seen an interdistrict remedy that was put into \neffect that didn't have some type of Court order.\" He also testified regarding the need for a planning process to develop an \n\nintegration plan, the relative merits of different types of such plans, such as controlled choice, magnet schools and \neducational parks. \nThe plaintiffs also offered Gary Oldfield as \"an expert in the analysis of desegregation remedies, and the relationships \nbetween segregation and desegregation and opportunity.\" He testified about the conditions under which implementation of a \ndesegregation plan can succeed, the role of teacher involvement in desegregation plans, the role of transportation plans, the \nuse of a housing component, and the role of the court in such remedies. \nThe plaintiffs also introduced the depositions of two other witnesses that covered the question of remedies. John Mannix' \ndeposition testimony covered the question of busing, scattered housing in the suburbs and magnet schools. Gerald Tirozzi's \ndeposition testimony dealt with past efforts to remedy racial isolation and concentrations of poverty, and the relative merits \nof various approaches to integration plans. \nThe defendants presented Christine Rossell as their primary witness on the question of remedy. She testified regarding: a \ncomparison of the effectiveness of mandatory, as opposed to voluntary, desegregation plans; the merits of controlled choice \nplans; and the factors necessary to consider in bringing about stable integration. \n[61] Indeed, these figures constitute a combination of the percentages of African-American and Hispanic students in the \nHartford schools. Thus, underlying the majority's entire thesis of the constitutional need to remedy racial and ethnic isolation \nin the schools of our state is the unfounded assumption that, for purposes of measuring diversity in those schools, these two \ngroups constitute a monolithic cultural entity. In my view, such an assumption is insulting to both groups. In fact, viewed \nthrough a somewhat different prism—viewing these two groups not as culturally monolithic but as culturally different—a \nschool system like Hartford's can be seen as more culturally diverse than an all white school system. \n[62] A second significant factor that compels the drastic implications of the majority's opinion is its definition of \"segregation\" \nas used in article first, § 20, when applied to education under article eighth, § 1. This definition does not require any state \nintent to bring about racial or ethnic concentration, and it appears to require that there be no significant disparities in the \nracial and ethnic makeup of various school districts. \nA third such factor is the majority's rationale for that definition. That rationale is based on the recognition of the general \nsocial benefits of a racially and ethnically integrated educational setting and of the general social burdens of a racially and \nethnically concentrated educational setting. It deems irrelevant, however, the specific factual findings in this case, which are \nthat the educational deficiencies of the Hartford school district of which the plaintiffs in this case complain arise from the \nconcentration of poverty in Hartford, and not from the racial and ethnic concentration in the schools. \nA fourth factor is the language of article first, § 20, itself. That language prohibits discrimination or segregation, not only \nbecause of race or ethnicity, but also because of religion. There is nothing in the language or history of article first, § 20, to \nsuggest that it embodies a hierarchy of protected classes. Indeed, it would be Orwellian, and antithetical to the entire equal \nprotection premise of article first, § 20, to read it as embodying a principle that some classes are more equal than others. It \nfollows, therefore, that religious concentration in public schools, not resulting from a state intent, must be treated the same \nas racial and ethnic concentration. \n[63] I do not address the implications of the majority opinion for other racial and ethnic groups, such as Asian-Americans, \nPolish-Americans and Italian-Americans, not because I do not think there are such implications, but because attempting to \nfigure them out at this point is beyond my capability. \n[64] In fact, there are vast areas of the state, such as Litchfield, Tolland and Windham counties, where it will be difficult if not \nimpossible to find sufficient minority students to comply with the majority's mandate. In these areas, even broadly drawn \nregional school districts will be constitutionally deficient. \n[65] I have only mentioned what I assume are, in terms of our population, the three major religions in the state. It may be \nthat other religions, such as Islam, will also have to be taken into account. \n[66] Indeed, that is precisely the remedy that the plaintiffs sought in the trial court on an interdistrict basis. Moreover, the trial \ncourt also found that students who live in an environment of concentrated poverty bring with them to school the array of \nsocial disadvantages associated with poverty that seriously hinder academic achievement, and that it is those \ndisadvantages, rather than racial and ethnic isolation, that are the primary causes of educational difficulties. These findings \nare supported by the evidence in this case. Furthermore, although the majority has deemed these findings to be irrelevant to \nits constitutional analysis, I do not read the majority opinion to reject them as unfounded. Thus, after the legislature has \nundertaken the process of realigning school district lines and transporting students so as to achieve the constitutionally \n\nmandated degree of racial, ethnic and religious integration, under the findings in this case the poverty stricken students of \nour urban areas will carry their educational disadvantages with them. \n[67] I recognize that these implications do not take into account the fact that the majority's conclusions rest in part on the fact \nthat the plaintiffs' racial and ethnic isolation is also accompanied by a concentration of poverty. I nonetheless think that the \nimplications are present and are necessary, because the constitutional underpinnings of the majority's conclusion that the \nexisting district lines must be changed are that: (1) a racially and ethnically integrated educational system carries benefits \nthat a concentrated system does not, and is free of burdens that a segregated system imposes; and (2) \"segregation\" under \narticle first, § 20, means de facto racial and ethnic separation. Neither of these notions has anything to do with poverty or its \neffects. Indeed, the majority has deemed irrelevant to its constitutional analysis the findings in this case that all of the \neducational deficiencies that the plaintiffs attribute to the Hartford school system are attributable to the environment of \npoverty in which the families of the students live, and not to their racial and ethnic isolation. Thus, under the majority's \nanalysis, at the end of the day, the fact of the plaintiffs' concentration of poverty is constitutionally irrelevant. \n[68] There is a fourth claim, namely, that the defendants have failed \"to remedy the racial, ethnic and economic isolation and \nlack of educational resources despite their long-standing knowledge of the harmful effects of these conditions.\" Because this \nclaim presupposes that the plaintiffs have established a constitutional violation that requires the defendants to have \nremedied, and because I conclude that the plaintiffs have not done so, it is not necessary to address this claim. \n[69] Although I disagree with the trial court's conclusion that there is no state action involved, the facts found by the trial \ncourt and the applicable legal principles compel a judgment for the defendants on the merits of this case. \n[70] Some of these specific findings are as follows. The generally poorer academic performance of African-American and \nHispanic students is explained for the most part, not by their racial and ethnic isolation, but by the social and economic \nconditions under which their families live. Thus, it \"is poverty and not race that is a principal causal factor in lower \neducational achievement.\" The problems of the Hartford school district arise from the fact that the minorities in it are \nprimarily poor, and the \"real correlation with academic achievement is socioeconomic class rather than race....\" Children \nwho live in poverty do not do well in statewide academic testing because they carry with them the social disadvantages of \ntheir poverty, and not because they are racially or ethnically isolated. This is demonstrated further by the fact that poor white \nchildren exhibit the same educational patterns as poor minority children, because poverty, and the concentration thereof, is \nthe strongest predictor of diminished academic achievement. \nThus, the court specifically found that virtually \"all of the differences in performance between Hartford students and those in \nother towns, as well as differences in college attendance, can be explained by differences in socioeconomic status and the \nbackground factors that socioeconomic status represents.\" Among these background factors are the heightened \"mobility\" of \nthe Hartford students, and the limited English proficiency of many of them. In this connection, the court also found that it is \npossible statistically to separate the educational effects of poverty from those of racial isolation, which the plaintiffs' experts \nhad not done. \n[71] Specifically, the trial court found that the scores serve purposes that are not related to measuring interdistrict \nperformance, and that it would be an abuse of their purposes to use them for such a measurement. Moreover, the court \nfound that the scores should not be seen to be caused by racial and ethnic isolation, because the results could be related to \nother factors that have not been considered in that context. The test scores cannot serve as a basis for interdistrict \ncomparisons because they do not take into account other significant factors, such as socioeconomic status, environmental \ndeprivations at home, diminished motivation to succeed, the number of students with limited English proficiency, and the \nextraordinary mobility of the Hartford student population. The court also found that, because school officials have no control \nover where their students live or the conditions under which they live, the officials are not in a position to remedy the severe \ndisadvantages that their students bring with them to school. \n[72] In this connection, the plaintiffs also refer to \"other measures of achievement such as drop-out rate, graduation rate, \nSAT scores and college attendance.\" Although these do not involve any goals or standards set by the state, the plaintiffs link \nthem with the mastery test scores. \n ",

EDWARD  CALDWELL,  Comptroller, \nState of  Connecticut, \nDefendants. \nCOMPLAINT \n1.  This  complaint  is  brought  on  behalf  of  school  children \nin  the  Hartford  school  district,  a  great  majority  of  whom  -- 91 \npercent  are  black  or  Hispanic,  and  nearly  half  of  whom  -- 47.6 \npercent  live  in  families  that are poor.  These  children  attend \n\n2 \npublic  schools  in  a  district  that  is  all  but  overwhelmed  by  the \ndemand  to  educate  a  student  population  drawn  so  exclusively  from \nthe  poorest  families  in  the  Hartford  metropolitan  region.  The \nHartford  school  district  is  also  racially  and  ethnically \nisolated:  on  every  side  are  contiguous  or  adjacent  school \ndistricts  that,  with  one  exception,  are  virtually  all-~hite,  and \nwithout  exception,  are  middle- or  upper-class  in  socioeconomic \ncomposition. \n2.  This  complaint  is  also  brought  on  behalf  of  children  in \nsuburban  school  districts that  surround  Hartford.  Because  of  the \nracial,  ethnic,  and  economic  isolation  of  Hartford  net::-opolitan \nschool  districts,  these  plaintiffs  are  deprived  of  the \nopportunity  to  associate  with,  and  learn  from,  the  ninority \nchildren  attending  school  with  the  Hartford  school  district. \n3.  The  educational  achievement  of  school  children  educated \nin  the  Hartford  school  district  is  not,  as  a  whole,  nearly  as \ngreat  as  that  of  students  educated  in  the  surrounding \ncommunities.  These  disparities  in  achievement  are  not  the  result \nof  native  inability:  poor  and  minority  children  have  the \npotential  to become  well-educated,  as  do  any  other  children.  Yet \nthe  state  of  Connecticut,  by  tolerating  school  districts  sharply \n- separated  along  racial,  ethnic,  and  economic  lines,  has  deprived \nthe  plaintiffs  and  other  Hartford  children  of  their  rights  to  an \nequal  educational  opportunity,  and  to  a  minimally  adequate \neducation  rights  to  which  they  are  entitled  under  the \nConnecticut  Constitution  and  Connecticut  statutes. \n\n3 \n4.  The  defendants  and  their  predecessors  have  long  been \naware  of  the  educational  necessity  for  racial,  ethnic,  and \neconomic  integration  in  the  public  schools.  The  defendants  have \nrecognized  the  lasting  harm  inflicted  on  poor  and  minority \nstudents  by  the  maintenance  of  isolated  urban  school  districts. \nYet,  despite  their  knowledge,  despite  their  constitutional  and \nstatutory  obligations,  despite  sufficient  legal  tools  to  remedy \nthe  problem,  the  defendants  have  failed  to  act\"  effectively  to \nprovide  equal  educational  opportunity  to  plaintiffs  and  other \nHartford  schoolchildren. \n5.  Equal  educational  opportunity,  however,  1s  not  a  matter \nof  sovereign  grace,  to  be  given  or  withheld  at  the  discretion  of \nthe  Legislative  or  the  Executive  branch.  Under  Connecticut's \nConstitution,  it  is  a  solemn  pledge,  a  covenant  renewed  in  every \ngeneration  between  the  people  of  the  State  and  their  children. \nThe  Connecticut  Constitution  assures  to  every _connecticut  child, \nin  every  city  and  town,  an  equal  opportunity  to  education  as  the \nsurest  means  by  which  to  shape  hi.s  or  her  own  future.  This \nlawsuit  is  brought  to  secure  this  basic  constitutional  right  for \nplaintiffs and  all  Connecticut  schoolchildren. \nII.  PARTIES \nA.  PLAINTIFFS \n6.

A  SEPARATE  EDUCATION \n30.  School  children  in  public  schools  throughout  the  State \nof  Connecticut,  including  the  City. of  Hartford  and  its  adjacent \nsuburban  communities,  are  largely  segregated  by  race  and  ethnic \norigin. \n31.  Although  blacks  comprise  only  12. 1%  of  Connecticut's \nschool-aqe  population,  Hispanics  only..  8. 5%,  and  children  in \nfamilies  below  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture's \nofficial  \"poverty  line\"  only  9.7%  in  1986,  these  groups \ncomprised,  as  of  1987-88,  44.9%,  44.9%,  and  51.4%  respectively \nof  the  school-age  population  of  the  Hartford  school  district.  The \npercentage  of  black  and  Hispanic  (hereafter  ''minority'')  students \n\n9 \nenrolled  i~  the  Hartford  City  schools  has  been  increasing  sin~e \n1981  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  1.5%. \n32.  The  only  other  school  district  in  the  Hartford \nmetropolitan  area  with  a  significant  proportion  of  minority \nstudents  is  Bloomfield,  which  has  a  minority  student  population \nof  69.9%. \n33.  The  school-age  populations  in  all  other  suburban  school \ndistricts  immediately  adjacent  and  contiguous  'to  the  Hartford \nschool  district,  (hereafter  ''the  suburban  districts''),  by \ncontrast,  are  overwhelmingly  white.  An  analysis  of  1987-88 \nfigures  for  Hartford,  Bloomfield,  and  each  of  the  suburban \ndistricts  (excluding  Burlington,  which  has  a  joint  school  program \nwith  districts  outside  the  Hartford  metropolitan  area)  reveals \nthe  following  comparisons  by  race  and  ethnic  origin: \nTotal  School  Pop.  % Minority \nHartford  25,058  90.5 \nBloomfield  2,555  69.9 \n********* \nAvon  2.068  3.8 \nCanton  1,189  3 . 2 \nEast Granby  666  2. 3 \nEast  Hartford  5,905  20.6 \nEast  Windsor  1,267  8.5 \nEllington  1. 855  2.3 \nFarmington  2,608  7.7 \nGlastonbury  4,463  5.4 \nGranby  1,528  3.5 \nManchester  7,084  11.1 \nNewington  3,801  6.4 \nRocky  Hill  1,807  5.9 \nSimsbury  4,039  6.5 \nSouth  Windsor  3,648  9.3 \nSuffield  1,772  4.0 \nVernon  4,457  6.4 \nWest  Hartford  7,424  15.7 \nWethersfield  2,997  3. 3 \n\n10 \nWindsor  4,235  30.8 \nWindsor  Locks  1,642  4.0 \n34.

AN  UNEQUAL  EDUCATION  \\ \n35.  Hartford  schools  contain  a  far  greater  proportion  of \nstudents,  at all  levels,  from  backgrounds  that put  them  \"at  rlsk\" \nof  lower  educational  achievement.  The  cumulative  responsibility \nfor  educating this  high  proportion  of  at-risk  students  places  the \nHartford  public  schools  at  a  severe  educational  disadvantage  in \ncomparison  with  the  suburban  schools. \n\n11 \n36.  All  children,  including  those  deemed  at  risk  of  lower \neducational  achievement,  have  the  capacity  to  learn  if  given  a \nsuitable  education.  Yet  because  the  Hartford  public  schools  have \nan  extraordinary  proportion  of  at-risk  students  anong  their \nstudent  populations,  they  operate  at  a  severe  educational \ndisadvantage  in  addressing  the  educational  needs  of  all  students \n-- not  only  those  who  are  at  risk,  but  those  who  are  not.  The \nsheer proportion  of  at-risk students  imposes  enormous  educational \nburdens  on  the  individual  students,  teachers,  classrooms,  and  on \nthe  schools  within  the  City  of  Hartford.  These  burdens  have \ndeprived  both  the  at-risk  children  and  all  other  Hartford \nschoolchildren  of  their  right  to  an  equal  educational \nopportunity. \n37.  An  analysis  of  1987-88  data  from  the  Hartford  and \nsuburban  districts,  employing  widely  accepted  indices  for \nidentifying  at-risk students  -- including:  (i)  whether  a  child's \nfamily  receives  benefits  under  the  federal  Aid  to  Families  with \nDependent  Children  program,  (a  measure  closely  correlated  with \nfamily  poverty);  (ii)  whether  a  child  has  limited  English \nproficiency  (hereafter  ''LEP'');  or  (iii)  whether  a  child  is  from  a \nsingle-parent  family,  reveals  the  following  overall  comparisons: \n% on  AFDC  % LEP  !0l,   Sgl.Par.Fam.  * \nHartford  47.6  40.9  51.0 \n********* \nAvon  0.1  1.9  6.8 \nBloomfield  4.1  3.1%  12. 0 \nCanton  1.2  1.6  8.8 \nEast  Granby  1.1  0.2  10.1 \nEast  Hartford  7.2  9.8  19.7 \nEast Windsor  3.6  2.5  8.3 \n\n12 \nEllington·- 0.5  0.3  7.7 \nFarmington  0.7  4.7  14. 0 \nGlastonbury  1.5  1.4  10.0 \nGranby  0.6  o.o  5.6 \nManchester  3.4  2.5  17.9 \nNewington  1.2  6.2  9.5 \nRocky  Hill  0.6  7.5  13.4 \nsimsbury  0.2  1.4  7.6 \nSouth  Windsor  0.4  4.4  8. 4 \nSuffield  0,8  2. 1  8.4 \nVernon  6.2  0.9  l3. 5 \nWest  Hartford  2.0  7.3  10.9 \nWethersfield  3.1  0.8  9.6 \nWindsor  2.5  12.5  14.2 \nWindsor  Locks  3. 3  2. 3  11.4 \n*  (Community-wide  Data) \n38.  Faced  with  these  severe  educational  burdens,  schools  in \nthe  Hartford  school  district  have  been  unable  to  provide \neducational  opportunities  that  are  substantially  equal  to  those \nreceived  by  schoolchildren  in  the  suburban  districts. \n39.  As  a  result,  the  overall  achievement  of  schoolchildren \nin  the  Hartford  school  district-- assessed  by  virtually  any \nmeasure  of  educational  performance  -- is-substantially below  that \nof  schoolchildren  in  the  suburban  districts. \n40.  One  principal  measure  of  student  achievement  in \nConnecticut  is  the  Statewide  Mastery  Test  program.  Mastery \ntests,  administered  to  every  fourth,  sixth,  and  eighth  grade \nstudent,  are  devised  by  the  State  Department  of  Education  to \nmeasure  whether  children  have  learned  those  skills  deemed \nessential  by  Connecticut  educators  at  each  grade  level. \n41.  The  State  Department  of  Education  has  designated  both  a \n\"mastery  benchmark\"  which  indicates  a  level  of  performance \nreflecting mastery  of  all  grade-level  skills -- and  a  \"remedial \n\n13 \nbenchmark''--- which  indicates  mastery  of  \"essential  grade-level \nskills.\"  See  C.G.S.  §10-14n  (b)-{c). \n42.  Hartford  schoolchildren,  on  average,  perform  at  levels \nsignificantly  below  suburban  schoolchildren  on  statewide  Mastery \nTests.  For  example,  in  1988,  34%  (or  l-in  -3)  of  all  suburban \nsixth  graders  score  at  or  above  the  \"mastery  bench::1ark\"  for \nreading,  yet  only  4%  (or  1-in-25)  of  Hartford  schoolchildren meet \nthat  standard.  While  74%  of  all  suburban  sixth  graders  exceed \nthe  remedial  benchmark  on  the  test  of  reading  skills,  no  more \nthan  41%  of  Hartford  schoolchildren  meet  this  test  of  ''essential \ngrade-level  skills.''  In  other  words,  fifty-nine  percent  of \nHartford  sixth  graders  are  reading  below  the  State  remedial \nlevel. \n43.

Measured  by  the  State's  own  educational  standards, \nthen,  a  majority  of  Hartford  schoolchildren  are  not  currently \nreceiving  even  a  \"minimally  adequate  education.\" \n46.  Other  measures  of  educational  achievement  reveal  the \nsame  pattern  of disparities.  The  suburban  schools  rank  far  ahead \nof  the  Hartford  schools  when  measured  by:  the  percentage ·of \nstudents  who  remain  in  school  to  receive  a  high  school  diploma \nversus  the  percentage  of  students  who  drop  out;  the  percentage  of \n\n15 \nhigh  scho-ol  graduates  who  enter  four-year  colleges;  the \npercentage  of  graduates  who  enter  any  program  of  higher \neducation;  or  the  percentage  of  graduates  who  obtain  full-time \nemployment  within  nine  months  of  completing  their schooling. \n4 7.  These  disparities  in  educational  achievement  between \nthe  Hartford  and  suburban  school  districts  are  the  result  of  the \neducational  and  social  policies  pursued  and/or .. accepted  by  the \ndefendants,  including  the  racial,  ethnic,  and  socioeconomic \nisolation  of  the  Hartford  and  suburban  school  districts.  These \nfactors  have  already  adversely  affected many  of  the  plaintiffs  in \nthis  action,  and  will,  in  the  future,  inevitably  and  adversely \naffect  the  education  of  others. \n48.  The  racial,  ethnic,  and  economic  segregation  of  the \nHartford  and  suburban  districts  necessarily  limits,  not  only  the \nequal  educational  opportunities  of  the  plaintiffs,  but  their \npotential  employment  contacts  as  Qell,  since  a  large  percentage \nof  all  employment  growth  in  the  Hartford  metropolitan  region  is \noccurring  in  the  suburban  districts,  and  suburban  students  have  a \nstatistically higher  rate  of  success  in  obtaining  employment  with \nmany  Hartford-area  businesses. \n49.  Public  school  integration  of  children  in  the  Hartford \nmetropolitan  region  by  race,  ethnicity,  and  economic  status would \nsignificantly  improve  the  educational  achievement  of  poor  and \nminority  children,  without  diminution  of  the  education  afforded \ntheir  majority  schoolmates.  Indeed,  white  students  would  be \nprovided  thereby  with  the  positive  benefits  of  close  associations \n\n16 \nduring  ttie1r  formative  years  with  blacks,  Hispanics  and  poor \nchildren  who  will  make  up  over  30%  of  Connecticut's  population  by \nthe  year  2000. \nC.  THE  STATE'S  LONGSTANDING  KNOWLEDGE  OF  THESE  INEQUITIES \n50.  For  well  over  two  decades,  the  State  of  Connect:icut, \nthrough  its  defendant  O'Neill,  defendant  State  Board  of \nEducation,  defendant  Tirozzi,  and  their  predece£sors,  have  been \naware  of:  (i)  the  separate  and  unequal  pattern  of  public  school \ndistricts  in  the  state  of  Connecticut  and  the~ greater  Hartford \nmetropolitan  region;  ( i i)  the  strong  governmental  forces  that \nhave  created  and  maintained  racially  and  economically  isolated \nresidential  communities  in  the  Hartford  region;  and  (iii)  the \nconsequent  need  for  substantial  educational  changes,  within  and \nacross  school  district  lines,  to  end  this  pattern  of  isolation \nand  inequality. \n51.  In  1965,  the  United  States  Civil  Rights  Commission \npresented  a  report  to  Connecticut's  Commissioner  of  Education \nwhich  documented  the  widespread  existence  of  racially  segregated \nschools,  both  between  urban  and  suburban  districts  and  within \nindividual  urban  school  districts.  The  report  urged  the \ndefendant  state  Board  to  take  corrective  action.  None  of  the \ndefendants  or  their  predecessors  took  appropriate  action  to \nimplement  the  full  recommendations  of  the  report. \n52.  In  1965,  the  Hartford  Board  of  Education  and  the  city \nCouncil  hired  educational  consultants  from  the  Harvard  School  of \nEducation  who  concluded:  (i)  that  low  educational  achievement  in \n\n17 \nthe  Hartford  schools  was  closely  correlated  with  a  high  level  of \npoverty  among  the  student  population;  (ii)  that  racial  and \nethnic  segregation  caused  educational  damage  to  minority \nchildren;  and  (iii)  that  a  plan  should  be  adopted,  with \nsubstantial  redistricting  and  interdistrict  transfers  funded  by \nthe  State,  to  place  poor  and  minority  children  in  suburban \nschools. \n53.  In  1966,  the  civil  Rights  Commission  presented  a  formal \nrequest  to  the  Governor,  seeking  legislation  that  would  invest \nthe  State  Board  of  Education  with  the  authority  to  direct  full \nintegration  of  local  schools.  Neither  the  defendants  nor  their \npredecessors  acted  to  implement  the  request. \n54.  In  1966,  the  Committee  of  Greater  Hartford \nsuperintendents  proposed  to  seek  a  federal  grant  to  fund  a \nregional  educational  advisory  board  and  various  regional \nprograms,  one  of  whose  chief  aims  would  be  tne  elimination  of \nschool  segregation within  the metropolitan  region. \n55.  In  1968,  legislation  supported  by  the  civil  Rights \nCommission  was  introduced  in  the  Connecticut  Legislature  which \nwould  have  authorized  the  use  of  state  bonds  to  fund  the \nconstruction  of  racially  integrated,  urban/suburban  \"educational \nparks,\"  which  would  have  been  located at the  edge  of metropolitan \nschool  districts,  have  had  superior  academic  facilities,  have \nemployed  the  resources  of  local  universities,  and  have  been \ndesigned  to  attract  school  children  from  urban  and  suburban \ndistricts.  The  Legislature  did  not  enact  the  legislation. \n\n18 \n56.  In  1968,  the  defendant  State  Board  of  Education \nproposed  legislation  that  would  have  authorized  the  Board  to  cut \noff  State  funding  for  school  districts  that  failed  to  develop \nacceptable  plans  for  correcting  racial  imbalance  in  local \nschools.  The  proposal  offered  State  funding  for  assistance  in \nthe  preparation  of  the  local  plans.  The  Legislature  did  not \nenact  the  legislation. \n.. \n57.  In  1969,  the  Superintendent  of  the  Hartford  School \nDistrict  called  for  a  massive  expansion  of  ''Project  Concern,''  a \npilot program  begun  in  1967  which  bused  several  hundred  black  and \nHispanic  children  from  Hartford  to  adjacent  suburban  schools. \nThe  Superintendent  argued  that  without  a  program  involving  some \n5000  students  one  quarter  of  Hartford's  minority  student \npopulation  the  city  of  Hartford  could  neither  stop  white \ncitizens  from  fleeing  Hartford  to  suburban  schools  nor  provide \nquali t}'\"  education  for  those  students  \\vho  remained.  Project \nConcern  was  never  expanded  beyond  an  enrollment  of  approximately \n1,500  students.  In  1988-89,  the ·total  enrollment  in  Project \nConcern  was  no  more  than  747  students,  less  than  3  percent  of  the \ntotal  enrollment  in  the  Hartford  school  system. \n58.  In  1969,  the  State  Legislature  passed  a  Racial \nImbalance  Law,  requiring  racial  balance  within,  but  not  between, \nschool  districts.  C.G.S.  §  10-226a  et  seq.  The  Legislature \nauthorized  the  State  Department  of  Education  to  promulgate \nimplementing  regulations.  C.G.S.  §  10-226e.  For  over  ten  years, \n\n19 \nhowever,  from  1969  until  1980,  the  Legislature  failed  to  appro·\"e \nany  regulations  to  implement  the  statute. \n59.  From  1970  to  1982,  no  effective  efforts  were  made  by \ndefendants  fully  to  remedy  the  racial  isolation  and  educational \ninequities  already  previously  identified  by  the  defendants,  which \nwere  growing  in  severity during  this  period. \n60.  In  1983,  the  State  Department  of  Education  established \na  committee  to  address  the  problem  of  \"equal  educational \nopportunity''  in  the  State  of  Connecticut.  The  defendant  Board \nadopted  draft guidelines  in  December  of  1984,  which  culminated  in \nthe  adoption,  in  May  of  1986,  of  a  formal  Education  Policy \nStatement  and  Guidelines  by  the  State  Board.  The  Guidelines \ncalled  for  a  state  system  of  public  schools  under  which  \"no  group \nof  students  will  demonstrate  systematically  different  achievement \nbased  upon  the  differences  -- such  as  residence  or  race  or  sex--\nthat·  its  members  brought  with-them  when  they  entered  schoo1..\" \nThe  Guidelines  explicitly  recognized  \"the  benefits  of  residential \nand  economic  integration  in  (Connecticut]  as  important  to  the \nquality  of  education  and  personal  growth  for  all  students  in \nConnecticut.\" \n61.  In  1985,  the  State  Department  of  Education  established \n-\nan  Advisory  committee  to  study  connecticut's  Racial  Imbalance \nLaw.  In  an  interim  report  completed  in  February  of  1986,  the \nCommittee  noted  the  \"strong  inverse  relationship  between  racial \nimbalance  and  quality  education  in  Connecticut's  public  schools.\" \nThe  Committee  concluded  that  this  was  true  \"because  racial \n\n20 \nimbalance  ~s  coincident  with  poverty,  limited  resources,  low \nacademic  achievement  and  a  high  incidence  of  students  with \nspecial  needs.\"  The  report  recommended  that  the  State  Board \nconsider  voluntary  interdistrict  collaboration,  expansion  of \nmagnet  school  programs,  metropolitan  districting,  or  other \n''programs  that  ensure  students  the  highest  quality  instruction \npossible.\" \n.. \n62.  In  January,  1988,  a  report  prepared  by  the  Department \nof  Education's  Committee  on  Racial  Equity,  under  the  supervision \nof  defendant  Tirozzi,  was  presented  to  the  State  Board.  Entitled \n''A  Report  on  Racial/Ethnic  Equity  and  Desegregation  in \nConnecticut's  Public  Schools,\"  the  report  informed  the  defendant \nBoard  that \nMany  minority  children  are  forced  by  factors \nrelated  to  economic  development,  housing, \nzoning  and  transportation  to  live  in  poor \nurban  communities  where  resources  are \nlimited.  They  often  have  available  to- them \nfewer  educational  opportunities.  Of  equal \nsignificance  is  the  fact  that  separation \nmeans  that  neither  they  nor  their \ncounterparts  in  the  more  affluent  suburban \nschool  districts  have  the  chance  to  learn  to \ninteract  with  each  other,  as  they  will \ninevitably  have  to  do  as  adults  living  and \nworking  in  a  multi-cultural  society.  Such \ninteraction  is  a  most  important  element  of \nquality  education. \nReport,  at 7. \n63.  In  1988,  after  an  extensive  analysis  of  connecticut's \nMastery  Test  results,  the  state  Department  of  Education  reported \nthat  \"poverty,. as  assessed  by  one  indicator,  participation  in  the \nfree  and  reduced  lunch  program  [is  an]  important \n\n21 \ncorrelate(T of  low  achievement,  and  the  low  achievement  outcomes \nassociated  with  these  factors  are  intensified  by  geographic \nconcentration.\"  Many  other  documents  available  to,  or  prepared \nby,  defendant  State  Board  of  Education  and  the  State  Department \nof  Education  reflect  full  awareness  both  of  these  educational \nrealities  and  of  their  applicability  to  the  Hartford-area \nschools. \n64.  In  April  of  1989,  the  State  Departme·'n  t  of  Education \nissued  a  report,  ''Quality  and  Integrated  Education:  Options  for \nConnecticut,''  in  which  it concluded  that \n(r]acial  and  economic  isolation  have  profound  academic \nand  affective  consequences.  Children  who  live  in \npoverty  -- a  burden  which  impacts  disproportionately  on \nminorities  are  more  likely  to  be  educationally  at \nrisk  of  school  failure  and  dropping  out  before \ngraduation  than  children  from  less  impoverished  homes. \nPoverty  is  the  most  important  correlate  of  low \nachievement.  This  belief was  borne  out  by  an  analysis \nof  the  1988  Connecticut  Mastery  Test  data  that-focused \non  poverty  The  analysis  also  revealed  that \nthe  low  achievement  outcomes  associated  with  poverty \nare  intensified  by  geographic  and  racial \nconcentrations. \nReport,  at  1. \n65.  Turning  to  the  issue  of  racial  and  ethnic  integration, \nthe  report  put  forward  the  findings  of  an  educational  expert  who \nhad  been  commissioned  by  the  Department  to  study  the  effects  of \nintegration: \n[T]he  majority  of studies  indicate  improved  achievement \nfor minority  students  in  integrated  settings and  at  the \nsame  time  offer  no  substantiation  to  the  fear  that \nintegrated  classrooms  impede  the  progress  of  more \nadvantaged  white  students.  Furthermore,  integrated \neducation  has  long-term  positive  effects  on  interracial \nattitudes  and  behavioi. \n\n22 \n66.  Despite  recognition  of  the  \"alarming  degree  of \nisolation\"  of  poor  and  minority  schoolchildren  in  the  City  of \nHartford  and  other  urban  school  systems,  Report  at  3,  and  the \ngravely  adverse  impact  this  isolation  has  on  the  educational \nopportunities  afforded  to  plaintiffs  and  other  urban \nschoolchildren,  the  Report  recommended,  and  the  defendants  have \nannounced,  that  they  intend  to  pursue  an  approach  that  would  be \n\"voluntary  and  incremental.\"  Report,  at  34. \nE.  THE  STATE'S  FAILURE  TO  TAKE  EFFECTIVE  ACTION \n67.  The  duty  of  providing  for  the  education  of  Connecticut \nschool  children,  through  the  support  and  maintenance  of  public \nschools,  has  always  been  deemed  a  governmental  duty  resting  upon \nthe  sovereign  State. \n68.  The  defendants,  who  have  knowledge  that  Hartford \nschoolchildren  face  educational  inequities,  have  the  legal \nobligation  under  Article  First,  §§  1  and  20,  and  Article  Eighth, \n§  1  of  the  Connecticut  Constitution  to  correct  those  inequities. \n69.  Moreover,  the  defendants  have  full  power  under \nConnecticut  statutes  and  the  Connecticut  Constitution  to  carry \nout  their constitutional  obligations  and  to  provide  the  relief to \nwhich  plaintiffs  are  entitled.  c. G. S.  §  10-4,  which  addresses \nthe  powers  and  duties  of  the  State  Board  of  Education  and  the \nState  Department  of  Education,  continues  with  §  10-4a,  which \nexpresses  \"the  concern  of  the  state  ( 1)  that  each  child  shall \nhave  equal  opportunity  to  receive  a  suitable  program  of \n\n23 \neducationar experiences.''  Other  provisions  of  state  law  give  the \nBoard  the  power  to  order  local  or  regional  remedial  planning,  to \norder  local  or  regional  boards  to  take  reasonable  steps  to  comply \nwith  state  directives,  and  even  to  seek  judicial  enforcement  of \nits  orders.  See  §  10-4b.  The  Advisory  Committee  on  Educational \nEquity,  established  by  §  10-4d,  is  also  expressly  empowered  to \nmake  appropriate  recommendations  to  the  Connecticut  State  Board \nof  Education  in  order \"to ensure  equal  educational  opportunity  in \nthe  public  schools.'' \n70.  Despite  these  clear mandates,  defendants  have  failed  to \ntake  corrective  measures  to  insure  that  its  Hartford  public \nschoolchildren  receive  an  equal  educational  opportunity.  Neither \nthe  Hartford  school  district,  which  is  burdened  both  with  severe \neducational  disadvantages  and  with  racial  ~nd  ethnic  isolation, \nnor  the  nearby  suburban  districts,  which  are  also  racially \nisolated  but  ·do  not  share  the  educational  burdens  of  a  large, \npoverty-level  school  population,  have  been  directed  by  defendants \nto  address  these  inequities  jointly,  to  reconfigure  district \nlines,  or  to  take  other  steps  sufficient  to  eliminate  these \neducational  inequities. \n71.  Defendant  William  0' Neill  and  his  predecessors  have \nalso  failed  to  take  action  to  afford  meaningful  racial  and \neconomic  integration  of  housing  within  school  zones  and  school \ndistricts  in  the  Hartford  metropolitan  region.  These  failures \nhave  contributed  to  the  isolation  of  poor  and  minority  students \nwithin  the  Hartford  School  District. \n\n24 \n72.  -Deprived  of  more  effective  remedies,  the  Hartford \nschool  district  has  likewise  not  been  given  sufficient  money  and \nother  resources  by  the  defendants,  pursuant  to  §10-14o  or  other \nstatutory  and  constitutional  provisions,  adequately  to  address \nmany  of  the  worst  impacts  of  the  educational  deprivations  set \nforth  in  ~~  23-37  supra.  The  reform  of  the  State's  school \nfinance  law,  ordered  in  1977  pursuant  to  litigation  in  the  Horton \nv.  Meskill  case,  has  not  worked  in  practice  adequately  to  redress \nthese  inequities.  Many  compensatory  or  remedial  services  that \nmight  have  mitigated  the  full  adverse  effect  of  the \nconstitutional  violations  set  forth  above  either  have  been  denied \nto  the  Hartford  school  district  or  have  been  funded  by  the  State \nat  levels  that  are  insufficient  to  ensure  their  effectiveness  to \nplaintiffs and  other  Hartford  schoolchildren. \nIV.

Paragraphs  1  through  72  are  incorporated  herein  by \nreference. \n82.

A school may be considered an interdistricc magnet school even though it ha.s \nnot .reached the required percentages to qualify as a magnet school, for existing schools until \nthe 2005-2006 :lchool year, and for new schools not later than their third year of operation. \na.  Host Magnet Schools ate those inte.tdistrict magnet schools  thac  arc  governed and \n6peraced by the Hartford Public School System. \nb.  Regional Magnet Schools are those interdistrict magnet schools which may be opctated \nby a third party or a coosortill.In of school districts. \n3.  Open Choice is a volwu.ary interdisttict transfer program that allows students to transfer \nbetween Hartford and the suburban school districts when such ttansfers contribute to the \nteduction of racial and ethnic isolation. \n4.  Inte.tdistrict Coopetative Progr:un'l ate those multi-district cooperative part-time pt<)g:truns \nwhich provide a. diverse educational experience for Connecticut students and whose purpose \nis the reduction of tacial, ethnic :md economic isolation. \n5.  :MiJJ.o.rity Srudc.nts-For the purposes of this Stipulation, minority students shall mean those \nsrudents who are Black and/ or Hispanic, Asian, Nari\"t\"c American and Pacific Islander. \n6.  Sheff v.

Period of the Agreement-The period of this agreement shall be from the date of its \nexecution t:h.tough June 30, 2007.  The school years covered will be 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-\n06 and 2006-07, and these years will be used to me2Sure the progress in the implementation \nof the terms of this Stipulation in providing minority public school students who reside in \nHartford with educational settings that reduce xacial, ethnic and economic isolation. \n2 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  5- 1- 3  ;!0:56AM  LEGAL  DEPT_,  212  219  2052;#  4/14 \n2.

In no event shall th..is category exceed 3'%. \nI \ny=  All minority public school students residing in Hartford \n= \nThe percentage of minority public school students residing in Hartford who \ne:\"tperience an educational setting with reduced isolation.  · \n3.  The Goal - The parties agree that the three instruments used for the .ceduction of racial, \nethnic and economic isolation arc:  (1)  interdistrict magnet schools. (2)  the Open Choice \nprogmm. and (3) in.terdistrict cooperative programs.  The parties further agree [hat: a) it is \ndesirable  that  the  State have  flexibility  in  managing  the  respective  size  and respective \nimplementation timing of these three instruments, and b) it i.'>  vital that each of the th.tee \ninstruments be developed to a meaningful level during the start-up plan so that each is in \nposition to pby a meaningful role in the final plan. \nlh~ goal of the parties is that, by the end of the tenn of this Stipulation, at least 30 pc:r.cent of \nminority students residing in H:u:tfotd will have o.n  educational experience with reduced \nisolation through the use of the three instruments enumr::r.ttcd above.  (N'o~e:a rties \nacknowledge  that  the  2002-2003  compa.rable  percentage is  approximate  10%).  It is \nacknowledged that achievement of thi.c; goo is dependent on many f~ctors, su  as mtetest io \nthe types of programs offered, parental choice, the federal No Child Left Behind Act of \n2001 and others.  The four year 30% goal for participation of Hartford minority students is \nnot direcrly enforcenble pursuant to Section V.6. However, defendants' .inability to make \nsignificant progress towards this goal may be considered by the Court. as  one factor, in \ndetermining what future plans or OTders may be necessary to achieve future compliance \npurswnt to Sections V.3. or 6. after the expiration of this Stipul~t:ion and O.rdet.  The State \nacknowledges its lca.dcr!ihip role in accomplishing this goal.  Working with the Hartford \nPublic Schools, suburban school boards, region~l groups and others, the State shall he the \nconvener aod lead agency in the planning, design, lmplemP.nl·ation and evaluation of annual \nprogress toward achieving the goal of the Stipulation. \n3 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  5-1- 3  ;1Q:.57AM  LEGAL  DEPT-~  212  219  2052;#  5/14 \n4.  Maintenance of Effort -During the period of this Stipulation, the State will not reduce its \nfunding and in-kind support to Hartford interclistrict rrutgnet schools, the Open Choice \nprogram  or  interdistrict  cooperative  p.rogya.Jll8  serving  minority  studentS  .residing  in \nHartford.  In addition, the State agrees to use its best efforts to assist the Hartford Public \nSchool:! in min.im.i.2ing disruption for students remaining in regular Hartford public school-: \nwho arc not enrolled in magnet schools or the Open Choice p.togram. \nSECTION'III. \nIMPLEMENIAT10N \nA.  MAGNET SCHOOLS \n1.  The Sttte will provide sufficient resources to plan, develop, open and operate r:wo new \nhost  magnet  schools  of approximately  600  students  each,  for  ~pproxim.ate.ly 1200 \nstudents total per yea.r, each yeo.r of the four year period of thls Stipulation (or eight new \nmagnet schools).  At the State's sole discretion, one or more of these school5 may be \nregional magnet schools.  If, in any year of this  Stipulation, two such host magnet \nschools do not open, such a failure may be deemed to be a material breach pUisuam to \nSection V.6. of this Stipulation. \n2.  The State Department of Education will work with the Hartford Public Schools and \nothers as necessary to  ensure the successful planning and opening of all inte:r:district \nmagnet schools. \n3.  State assistance will include school construction funding of eligible costs.  However, \nrecognizing the length of time involved in the construction of new schools, the State \nDepartment of Education will work with the Hanford Public Schools to coordinate and \nidentify existing schools which may be used to open new magnet schools.  The State \nDepartment of Education will encourage the opening of these schools at facilities which \nhave been or are scheduled to be renovated in accordance with Hartford's long-tcnn \nschool building program pur~u~t to Sec. 10-220 of the Connecticut General Stat\\ltes. \nThe Hartford Public Schools and the City of I Iartford will be tequired by the State \nDepartment of Education  to update its  long range  facilities  plan, including  design \nchanges  to promote developmept of innovative  magnet themes;  to inco.cporate  the \nincrease in the number of interdistrict magnet schools in Hartford. \n4.  After  accommodating  students  from  member  towns  and  Hartford  students  in \naccordance with the approved eJUollment of any intctdutrict magnet school, any vacant \nsuburban sears may be open, by lottery, to any parent/ student who is a resident of a \nSheff rc:gion town, who shall be pc::onitted to attend, with a requirement of local support \nby the sending town equal to the per pupil tuition charged to a member town.  1bis \namount may  be withheld  from  the sending town's ECS grant and provided  to  the \n.lru\\gnet schuo! if necessary. \n4 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  5- 1- 3  ;!0:58AM  LEGAL  DEPT-~  212  219  2052;#  6/14 \nB.

The parties recognize that H:utford minority students in \nthe Open Choice program also :1ttend schools in certain towns outside of the Sheff v. \nO'Neill .region and can he counted towards the reduction of isolation pu.rsuant to this \nStipulation \n2.  The Commissioner will use his best efforts to encourage subuxban districts to participate \nin the Open Choice ptogJ:a.m as one means of complying with the requirements of Sec. \n10-4.1. of the Connecticut General Starutes.  The Commissioner will also usc his best \nefforts co review md encourage innovative methods of twlsporting Choice students in \norder to minimize the duration of school bw rides. \n3.  If the  Comm.issioner believes  that a distr:ict has greater capacity than reported, the \nCommissioner may  conduct an  independent review of the !!pace  availability of the \nsuburban districts in the Open Choice program. \n4.  The Commissioner will periodically evaluate the progress of participation in the Open \nChoice program and may take steps to increase participation.  Such steps may include \nattc:tnpt:s to improve communication with parents of public school students residing in \nHartford. \n5.  Minority students residing in Hartford will  not be counted in section (1)  of x of the \nformula in Section II of this Stipulation (Open Choice) unless  they attend a school \noutside of Hartford which has a minority student enrollment percent.age which does not \nexceed the Sheff region minority percentage enrollment plus 30 percent. \n6.  For the purposes of this agreement only, the sum of $250,000, beyond the statutory \nfunding formula, will be added each year (resulting in $1,000,000 additional funding in \nyear 2006-2007) to fund transportation costs for the Open Choke Program for Hartford \nstudents. \nC.  IN1ERDISTR.ICI COO~ERATIVE PROGRAMS \n1.  The State agrees to provide jncreased funding for these programs which· setve public \nschool students who reside in Hartford who are not enrolled in a magnet school or \nOpen Choice, and to give preference  to program proposals  that p.rovide substantial \ncontact  between  Hartford  students  and  non-minority  suburban  students.  These \nprograms sh:tll be meaningful and of high qualicy, a.nd the goal must be a susta.ined, \npositive impact on the reduction of racial, ethnic and ecnoomic iso.bt:ion.  The St~te \nDepartment  of Education  will  give  preference  to  proposal\"  which  will  cocourage \nexposute of minority students residing in Hartford to magnet school and Open Cho.ice \nprograms, such as activities which 'lVill take place at a magnet school or in a suburban \n5 \n\nSENT  BY:ACLU  5- 1- 3  ;!0:59AM  LEGAL  DEPT-+  212  219  2052;#  7114 \nschool district which p21ticipates in the Open Choice progtam.

Although the plaintiffs do not concur that intctdistrict cooperative progr.ams result in \nreduced  student  isolation,  tl1c  parties  recogni2c  that  these  put-time  interdistrict \ncooper.acive grant progr:uns provide educational benefit to their participants.  The parties \nagree that the weighting ptovided for in Section II.2. of this Stipulation w:ill be given to \nthese programs to be used in the cakulati.on of the teduct:i.on of isolation. \nSECTION IV \nPLANNING \n1.  The State Dcpa.rtmem of Education will p.t:ovide the necessary assistance and support to \nthe H2.ltford Public Schools to ensure the opening of the intetdistrict magnet schools \ncalled  for:  in  this  Stipulation.

Its  purpose  i.~  to  evaluate  alterna.tive  funding  methods  for \ninterdistrict magnet schools and issues of p:.u:cnt choice and poru.bility of pupil funding. \n4.  The parties agree that certain administrative and func.li.ng issues have been identified \nwhich may impede implementation of a successful program to reduce racial, ethnic and \neconomic isolation.  These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the state and local \nfunding fo.r  regional and host magnet schools,. transportation, and the Open Choice \np.rogram, including space availability in suburban schools.  The parties are hopeful that \nsome of these issues may be addressed by the recently appointed Task Force .referred to \nin Paragraph 3 ab()ve.  The parties acknowledge th.at the provisions of this Stipulation \nare in effect for the Hartford region and only fo:r the term of this Stipulation, and do not \naffect the .recommendations of the Task.

      "text": "HHD-X07-CV89-4026240-S \n \nMILO SHEFF, et al.  :   \n  :  SUPERIOR COURT B  \nPlaintiffs  :  COMPLEX LITIGATION  \n  :  DOCKET AT HARTFORD B X07 \nv.  :   \n  :   \nWILLIAM A. O’NEILL, et al.    : \n: \nDefendants  :  JULY 5, 2007 \n \n \n \nMOTION FOR ORDER ENFORCING JUDGMENT AND TO  \nOBTAIN A COURT-ORDERED REMEDY \n \n  Plaintiffs hereby move for further proceedings to enforce the judgment in Sheff v. \nO’Neill, 238 Conn. 1 (1996), and to obtain a court-ordered remedy to the unconstitutional system \nof public education in the Hartford region.  In support of this Motion, Plaintiffs state: \n1.  Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in 1989 to challenge racial isolation in, and educational \ndisparities between, public schools in Hartford and the surrounding communities. \n2.  In July 1996, the Connecticut Supreme Court found that Defendants’ maintenance of \nracially isolated schools in the Hartford region violated state constitutional prohibitions \non segregation and discrimination, and contravened the affirmative constitutional \nobligation to provide all schoolchildren with substantially equal educational \nopportunities.  Sheff, 238 Conn. at 24-34.  The Supreme Court further ordered the \nlegislative and executive branches to take immediate, urgent remedial action to address \nthese unconstitutional conditions.  Id. at 45-46 (directing the legislature and the executive \nbranch to “put the search for appropriate remedial measures at the top of their respective \nagendas”). \n       \n\n3.  Two years later, in March 1998, Plaintiffs filed a motion for an order directing that \neffective remedial measures be undertaken.  See Pls.’ Mot. for Order (Mar. 6, 1998) \n[Entry No. 259 on the Superior Court docket].  The trial court held a hearing in \nSeptember 1998, and issued a ruling in March 1999 declining to enter a remedial order on \nthe ground that Plaintiffs had returned to court too soon.  Sheff v. O’Neill, 45 Conn. Sup. \n630, 657 (1999) (“[T]he court finds that the plaintiffs failed to wait a reasonable time and \nthat their return to court was premature.”); see also id. at 667 (“The legislative and \nexecutive branches should have a realistic opportunity to implement their remedial \nprograms before further court intervention.”).  \n4.  In December 2000, Plaintiffs filed an order to show cause why Defendants’ efforts to \ncomply with the Supreme Court’s 1996 decision should not be held to be inadequate.  See \nPls.’ Mot. for Order Regarding Implementation (Dec. 28, 2000) [Entry No. 259].  The \ntrial court held a three-week hearing in 2002, which was followed by several months of \nsettlement negotiations between the parties.  Plaintiffs and Defendants ultimately agreed \nto a settlement, which was entered as an Order of the Court in March 2003 (“the 2003 \nOrder”) [Entry No. 306].  The 2003 Order created a four-year plan through which \nDefendants were to achieve stated interim goals toward reducing the racial isolation of \nHartford’s minority schoolchildren. \n5.  In August 2004, when it became clear that Defendants were in substantial noncompliance \nwith the 2003 Order, Plaintiffs filed a motion to declare Defendants in breach.  See Pls.’ \nMot. for Order Declaring Defs. in Material Breach (Aug. 3, 2004) [Entry No. 307].  This \nmotion was not judicially resolved, and the parties focused on cooperative efforts to \nimprove the state’s performance toward the requirements of the 2003 Order.  (In light of \n  2     \n\nthe expiration of the 2003 Order on June 30, 2007, Plaintiffs’ 2004 motion is moot.) \n6.  In August 2006, the City of Hartford moved to intervene in this action.  Intervention was \ngranted by order of this Court on January 4, 2007. \n7.  Throughout 2006 and 2007, the Plaintiffs and Defendants engaged in extensive and \nfrequent negotiations aimed at reaching a remedial settlement to be implemented upon \nexpiration of the 2003 Order.  These settlement discussions included the City of Hartford \nafter the City’s intervention was granted in January 2007.  The Plaintiffs and Defendants \nreached agreement on a proposed remedial settlement; the City indicated that it would not \nsign the proposed settlement but did not oppose the settlement. \n8.  The Attorney General submitted the proposed settlement to the General Assembly for \napproval, as required by C.G.S. § 3-125a.  The General Assembly did not approve the \nproposed Sheff settlement before the end of the 2007 legislative session. \n9.  The 2003 Order expired on June 30, 2007.  See 2003 Order § II.1.  The 2003 Order was \nan interim, not a final, remedial settlement.  See id. § V.3 (“The parties acknowledge that \nfull attainment of the goals of this Stipulation may not obviate the need for further efforts \nat reducing student isolation.”); § V.6 (“Nothing in this agreement shall prevent the \nplaintiffs from seeking further enforcement of the Sheff v. O’Neill 1996 decision \nfollowing the expiration of this Stipulation and Order on June 30, 2007.”). \n10.  Accordingly, the 2003 Order having expired, and there being no subsequent remedial \nagreement, Plaintiffs seek a court-ordered remedy to the persistent racial isolation of \npublic schools in the Hartford region, which continues to violate Article Eighth, § 1 and \nArticle First, §§ 1 and 20 of the Connecticut Constitution.  In support of the need for a \ncourt-ordered remedy, Plaintiffs state: \n  3     \n\na.  The Supreme Court directed this Court to retain jurisdiction to ensure that an \neffective remedy would be implemented, and expressly held that a judicially-\nmandated remedy would be appropriate if the state was unable to eliminate the \nunconstitutional racial isolation of the Hartford schools.  Sheff, 238 Conn. at 46-\n47 (“[A] denial of constitutionally protected rights demands judicial protection; \nour oath and our office require no less of us.”) (quoting Reynolds v. Sims, 377 \nU.S. 533, 566 (1964)). \nb.  In 1991, the earliest date discussed by the Supreme Court, the Hartford public \nschools had a student enrollment that was 92.4% minority.  Sheff, 238 Conn. at 8.  \nTen years after the Supreme Court held this level of racial isolation to be \nunconstitutional, Hartford-resident minority students suffer from even greater racial \nand ethnic isolation: For the 2006-07 school year, the Hartford public schools were \nnearly 95% minority.  The state’s efforts to comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling \nhave been wholly unsuccessful.  Cf. Sheff, 45 Conn. Sup. at 657 (“Certainly one \nmethod of assessing the efficacy of the state’s efforts to reduce racial and ethnic \nisolation in the Hartford schools is to wait a reasonable amount of time to see how \nmany students in Hartford are still attending schools in which they are racially or \nethnically isolated.”). \nc.  The 2003 Order established a goal of enrolling 30% of Hartford-resident minority \nstudents in a reduced-isolation educational setting by June 2007, and provided \nthat “defendants’ inability to make significant progress towards this goal may be \nconsidered by the Court, as one factor, in determining what future plans or orders \nmay be necessary.”  See 2003 Order § II.3.  The 2003 Order defines reduced-\n  4     \n\nisolation setting as any school in which the percentage of minority students does \nnot exceed the Sheff region minority percentage enrollment plus thirty percent.  \nId. § I.2. \nd.  The state has fallen woefully short of the 30% goal: the current rate of “legal” \ncompliance with the 2003 Order is 16.7%, barely more than half of the target.  \nMoreover, because the rate of legal compliance includes several categories of \nconstructive performance (including a performance increase for state spending on \ninterdistrict cooperative grants, and an exemption for new magnet schools from \nthe reduced-isolation standard for their first three years of operation, see 2003 \nOrder §§ I.2, II.2, III.C), the actual number of Hartford students attending \nreduced-isolation schools is a mere 8.8%. \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs move for further proceedings to enforce the \njudgment of the Supreme Court and to obtain a court-ordered remedy to the unconstitutional \nsystem of public education in the Hartford region.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n          By:   __________________________ \nWesley W.

Definitions \nA.  Voluntary  Interdistrict  Programs  are  the  instruments  employed  under this \nStipulation  to  reduce  racial,  ethnic,  and  economic  isolation:  namely,  Interdistrict \nMagnet  Schools  (Host  and  Regional),  State  Technical  Schools,  Charter  Schools, \nthe  Regional  Vocational  Agriculture  Centers  and  Open  Choice. \nInterdistrict  Magnet  School  refers  to  Hartford  Host  Magnet  Schools,  Suburban \nHost  Magnet  Schools,  Regional  Magnet  Schools,  and  Incubator  Magnet  Schools. \nI.  Hartford  Host  Magnet  Schools  are  those  Interdistrict  Magnet  Schools  that \nare  governed  and  operated  by  the  Hartford  Public  School  System. \n2.  Suburban  Host  Magnet  Schools  are  those  Interdistrict  Magnet  Schools  that \nare  governed  and  operated  by  a  school  district  within  the  Sheff Region \nother  than  Hartford,  alone  or with  a  third  party. \n3.  Regional  Magnet  Schools  are  those  host  and  regional  Interdistrict  Magnet \nSchools  that  may  be  operated  by  a  third  party  or  a  consortium  of school \ndistricts. \n4,  Incubator  Magnet  Schools  are  interdistrict  programs  established  in \ntemporary,  transitional,  start-up  space  to  begin  the  operation  of a  new \ninterdistrict  magnet  school  prior  to  the  completion  of construction  or \nrenovation  of the  permanent  facility. \n5.  Existing  Magnet  Schools  are  those  Interdistrict  Magnet  Schools  that  are  in \noperation  during  the  2008-09  school  year. \nCharter  School  refers  to  local  charter  schools  or  state  charter  schools,  as \nauthorized  by  Conn.  Gen.  Stat.  §  10-66aa,  that  are  specifically  intended  to  reduce \nracial,  ethnic,  and  economic  isolation  pursuant  to  Conn.  Gen.  Stat.  §  10-66bb(c). \nState  Technical  School  refers  to  certain  regional  vocational-technical  schools  that \nare  established  and  maintained  by  the  State  in  accordance  with  Conn.  Gen.  Stat. \n§  10-95,  and  such  programs  in  such  schools  as  designated  by  the  State \nDepartment  of Education.\nRegional  Vocational  Agriculture  Center  refers  to  certain  regional  vocational \nagriculture  schools  that  are  established  and  maintained  by  local  or  regional  boards \nof education  in  accordance  with  Conn.  Gen.  Stat.  §  10-64. \nOpen  Choice  is  a  voluntary  interdistrict  transfer  program  that  allows  students  to \ntransfer  between  Hartford  and  the  suburban  school  districts  when  such  transfers \ncontribute  to  the  reduction  of racial  and  ethnic  isolation. \nInterdistrict  Cooperative  Programs  are  those  multi-district cooperative  part-time \nprograms  established  in  accordance  with  Conn.  Gen.  Stat.  §  10-74d  that  provide  a \ndiverse  educational  experience  for  Connecticut  students  and  whose  purpose  is  the \nreduction  of racial,  ethnic,  and  economic  isolation. \nMinority  Students:  For  the  purposes  of this  Stipulation,  minority  students  shall \nmean  those  students  who  are  Black  and/or  Hispanic,  Asian,  Native  American,  and \nPacific  Islander. \nSheff Region:  As  defined  in  the  original  complaint,  the  Sheff Region  includes  the \nschool  districts  of Avon,  Bloomfield,  Canton,  East  Granby,  East  Hartford,  East \nWindsor,  Ellington,  Farmington,  Glastonbury,  Granby,  Hartford,  Manchester, \nNewington,  Rocky  Hill,  Simsbury,  South  Windsor,  Suffield,  Vernon,  West \nHartford,  Wethersfield,  Windsor,  and  Windsor  Locks. \nThe  Desegregation  Standard  shall  be  the  lesser  of the  Sheff Region’s  aggregate \nminority  percentage  enrollment  plus  thirty  percentage  points  or  seventy-five \npercent  (75%).  The  Desegregation  Standard  shall  be  calculated  for  each  year  of \nthe  Stipulation  based  on  that  year’s  aggregate  minority  percentage  enrollment \nfigures  but  in  no  event  shall  it  exceed  seventy-five  percent  (75%). \nReduced-Isolation  Setting  refers  to  an  educational  setting  with  reduced  racial, \nethnic,  and  economic  isolation. \n1.  An  Interdistrict  Magnet  School,  State  Technical  School,  Regional \nVocational  Agriculture  Center,  or  Charter  School  shall  be  deemed  to \nprovide  a  reduced-isolation  setting  if its  enrollment  is  such that  the \npercentage  of minority  students  in  the  school  does  not  exceed  the \nDesegregation  Standard. \n2.  A  school  that  enrolls  Hartford-resident  minority  students  through  the \nOpen  Choice  program  shall  be  deemed  to  provide  a  reduced-isolation \nsetting.\nI.  Goals  and  Performance \nA.  Term:  The  Phase  II  term  shall  be  from  the  date  of its  execution  to  June  30,  2013. \nThe  school  years  covered  will  be  2008-09  (Year  1),  2009-10  (Year  2),  2010-11 \n(Year  3),  and  2011-12  (Year 4),  and  2012-13  (Year  5).  Pursuant  to  Part  [.C.4  of \nthis  Stipulation,  the  Phase  II  term  may  extend  to  include  school  year  2013-14 \n(Year  6). \nGoals \nI.  The  goal  of this  Stipulation  is  to  increase  the  number  of Hartford-resident \nminority  students  in  a  reduced-isolation  educational  setting,  and  to  move \ntoward  meeting  demand  of Hartford-resident  minority  students  seeking \nplacement  in  such  settings. \nThe  goal  of this  Stipulation  is  attained  if,  by  Year  5  of this  Stipulation,  at \nleast  80%  of the  demand  for  a  reduced-isolation  setting  is  met. \na.  The  goal  of meeting  80%  of the  demand  for  a  reduced-isolation \nsetting  shall  be  subject  to  the  extension  provision  of Part  II.C.4 \nherein  and  possible  adjustment  by  mutual  agreement  of the  parties \nas  set  forth  in  Part  [V.B.4. \nThis  goal  is  to  be  attained  through  implementation  of the  Voluntary \nInterdistrict  Programs  defined  in  Part  I.A  above. \nThe  State  shall  provide  sufficient  resources  to  plan,  develop,  open,  and \noperate  the  schools  and  programs  necessary  to  achieve  each  of the  interim \nperformance  benchmarks  identified  in  Part  [I.C.5  below,  and  to  implement \nthe  programs  identified  in  Part  III  below. \nGoal  Measurement \nI.  In  April  of Year  3,  the  State  shall  examine  the  demand  for  seats  in \nreduced-isolation  settings  by  Hartford-resident  minority  students  based  on \nthe  number  of Hartford-resident  minority  applicants  for  a  Voluntary \nInterdistrict  Program  for  the  next  school  year.  Demand,  for  purposes  of \nthis  Stipulation,  shall  include  only  the  number  of those  Hartford-resident \nminority  students  who  apply,  via  an  approved  application  form,  to  either \n(a)  Open  Choice,  or  (b)  at  least  three  placement  choices  in  a  Voluntary \nInterdistrict  Program  that  meets  the  Desegregation  Standard  at  the  time  of \napplication.\n2.  In  November  of Year  4,  the  State  shall  evaluate  the  number  of Hartford- \nresident  minority  students  on  a  waitlist  for  a  Voluntary  Interdistrict \nProgram  to  determine  the  degree  to  which  existing  programs  and  planned \nnew  programs  meet  demand  for  seats  in  reduced-isolation  settings  by \nHartford-resident  minority  students.  The  waitlist  shall  reflect  the \naggregate  number  of Hartford-resident  minority  students  who  submit \napplications  for  placement  in  Voluntary  Interdistrict  Programs  that  meet \nthe  Desegregation  Standard  at  the  time  of application  but  are  not  offered  a \nseat  in  any  such  program  for that  school  year. \na.  Hartford  minority  students  shall  have  readily  available \nopportunities  to  submit  an  approved  application  for  placement  in \nVoluntary  Interdistrict  Programs. \nb.  If less  than  65%  of the  demand  for  seats  in  reduced-isolation \nsettings  by  Hartford-resident  minority  students  is  met then  the \nState,  in  consultation  with  the  Regional  School  Choice  Office,  shall \namend  the  Comprehensive  Management  Plan,  as  described  in  Part \nIII.B,  to  plan  additional  capacity  for  seats  in  reduced-isolation \nsettings.  “Met  demand”  shall  be  defined  as  one  hundred  minus  the \npercentage  of Hartford-resident  minority  students  on  the  waitlist  for \na  Voluntary  Interdistrict  Program  as  calculated  by  dividing  the \nnumber  of Hartford-resident  minority  students  on  the  waitlist  as  of \nNovember  15th,  by  the  total  number  of Hartford-resident  minority \napplicants  for  a  Voluntary  Interdistrict  Program  for that  school  year \nwho  apply  to  either  Open  Choice  or  at  least  three  Voluntary \nInterdistrict  Programs  that  meet  the  Desegregation  Standard. \nC.  For  purposes  of this  Stipulation,  the  waitlist  referenced  in  this  Part \nI.C  shall  be  a  comprehensive  school  choice  waitlist which  shall \ninclude  only  those  Hartford-resident  minority  students  who  have \napplied  for  placement  in  either  Open  Choice  or  at  least three \nVoluntary  Interdistrict  Programs  that  meet  the  Desegregation \nStandard  but  (1)  are  not  offered  a  seat  in  any  such  program  for  that \nschool  year,  and  (2)  meet  all  of the  program  admission \nrequirements,  and  (3)  have  indicated  their  intent  as  part  of the \napplication  process,  through  a  means  to  be  defined  in  the \nComprehensive  Management  Plan,  to  be  placed  on a  waitlist  if not \naccepted. \n3.  In  November  of the  final  school  year  of Phase  II,  the  State  shall  convene  a \nmeeting  with  the  Plaintiffs  for the  purpose  of demonstrating  its  attainment \nof the  goal  of Phase  II  as  set  forth  herein.  At  that  time,  the  State  will  seek\nto  show  that  by  Year  5,  at  least  80%  of the  demand  for  seats  in  reduced- \nisolation  settings  by  Hartford-resident  minority  students  is  met,  subject  to \nany  adjustments  pursuant  to  Part  1V.B.4.  Meeting  demand  for  seats  in \nreduced-isolation  settings  by  Year  5  as  defined  herein  shall  be \ndemonstrated  by  a  showing  that  less  than  20%  of Hartford-resident \nminority  students  who  have  applied  for  Open  Choice  or  at  least  three \nVoluntary  Interdistrict  Programs  that  meet  the  Desegregation  Standard  are \non  the  comprehensive  school  choice  waitlist  to  participate  in  such \nprograms  as  defined  in  Part  II.C.2.c. \nIf in  November  of the  final  year  of Phase  II,  the  State  is  unable  to \ndemonstrate  its  attainment,  through  reasonable  efforts,  of the  goal  of \nmeeting  80%  of demand,  the  parties  shall  convene  to  revisit the \nComprehensive  Management  Plan  and  to  determine  what  steps  are \nnecessary  to  meet  the  demand  standard  by  the  following  year.  Any \nagreement  that  is  reached  through  this  process  shall  be  incorporated  into  a \none-year  extension  of the  term  of this  Stipulation.  Notwithstanding  Part \nIV.C.1.c,  failure  to  meet  the  80%  demand  standard,  subject  to  any \nadjustment  pursuant  to  Part  IV.B.4,  shall  not  constitute  a  material  breach \nif a  minimum  of 41%  of Hartford-resident  minority  students  are  in  a \nreduced-isolation  setting  by  Year  5. \nInterim  Performance  Benchmarks \na.  The  State  shall  be  required  to  attain  the  following  annual \nbenchmarks  for  the  first  two  years  of the  Phase  IT  term: \n(1)  In  Year  |  (2008-09),  19%  of Hartford-resident  minority \nstudents  shall  be  in  a  reduced-isolation  educational  setting. \n(2)  In  Year  2  (2009-10),  27%  of Hartford-resident  minority \nstudents  shall  be  in  a  reduced-isolation  educational  setting. \nb.  Performance  of each  interim  performance  benchmark  as  well  as \nthe  41%  minimum  established  in  Part  I1.C.4  shall  be  calculated  by \ndividing  the  number  of Hartford-resident  minority  students  in \nreduced-isolation  settings  by  the  total  number  of Hartford-resident \nminority  students.  Performance  for  each  year  shall  be  calculated \nusing  the  October  enrollment data  for that year,  which  will  be \nmade  available  by  the  Defendants  to  the  Plaintiffs  and  Hartford  by \nNovember  15  of each  year. \nC.  Hartford-resident  minority  students  who  are  enrolled  in  a\nVoluntary  Interdistrict  Program  that  does  not  provide  a  reduced- \nisolation  setting  will  be  included  in  any  interim  performance \nbenchmark  calculation  or  goal  calculation  during  the  term  of this \nStipulation  only  if (1)  the  school  is  operating  pursuant  to  an \napproved  Enrollment  Management  Plan  pursuant  to  Part  [1V.A \nbelow,  and  (2)  the  minority  enrollment  in  such  school  does  not \nexceed  the  Desegregation  Standard  by  more  than  5%.  In  no  case \nshall  any  Voluntary  Interdistrict  Program  be  included  within  this \nexception  for  more  than  two  of the  five  years  of this  Stipulation. \nd.  Hartford-resident  minority  students  who  are  enrolled  in  an \nIncubator  Magnet  School  that  is  in  its  first  year  of operation  will \nbe  included  in  the  Year  |  interim  performance  benchmark  only  if \nthe  minority  enrollment  in  such  school  does  not  exceed  the \nDesegregation  Standard  by  more  than  10%.  In  no  case  shall  any \nIncubator  Magnet  School  be  included  within  this  exception  after \nYear  |  of the  term  of this  Stipulation. \ne.  Any  interim  performance  benchmark  as  well  as  the  41%  minimum \nestablished  in  Part  I1.C.4  will  be  increased  by  up  to  three \npercentage  points  for  Interdistrict  Cooperative  Programs,  as \nfollows:  A  credit  of one  percentage  point  shall  be  added  for  every \n500  Hartford-resident  minority  students  who  participate  in \nmeaningful  and  substantial  Interdistrict  Cooperative  Programs,  up \nto  a  total  of three  percentage  points.  Such  programs,  to  be \nconsidered  meaningful  and  substantial,  shall  entail  no  less  than  45 \nhours  in  duration,  of which  at  least  30  hours  must  be  face-to-face \ncontact  time.  Time  spent  transporting  students  shall  not  be \ncounted  in  the  duration.  A  student  who  participates  in  a  program \nof at  least  90  hours  in  duration,  of which  at  least  60  hours  is  face- \nto-face  contact time,  shall  be  counted  as  1.5  students  for the \npurpose  of this  calculation. \nThe  parties  acknowledge  that  full  attainment  of the  goals  of Phase  II  does  not \nobviate  the  need  to  increase  further  the  number  of Hartford-resident  minority \nstudents  in  reduced-isolation  settings.  By  at  least  September  15,  2012,  the  parties \nto  this  Stipulation  will  meet  to  review  the  progress  made  under the  Stipulation \nand  to  commence  negotiations  for  a  Phase  III  settlement,  the  purpose  of which \nshall  be  to  meet  the  demand  for  integrated  education  of Hartford-resident  minority \nstudents.\ni.
