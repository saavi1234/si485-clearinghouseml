    "summary": "<p>The background to this case concerns a policy known as the Small Area Fair Market Rent (&ldquo;FMR&rdquo;) rule that was set to go into effect on January 1, 2018, after years of advocacy, research, and public debate. The rule required the public housing agencies (PHAs) that administered the Housing Choice Voucher program (formerly Section 8) to set voucher values in 24 metropolitan areas based on the prevailing private market rents for each distinct zip code within those regions. The revised methodology recognized the existence of very different local rental markets within each metropolitan area and calibrated the vouchers more closely to the amount needed to live in various neighborhoods. It thus enabled voucher holders to access a wider range of housing, outside of voucher-concentrated, racially-segregated areas.</p>\r\n<p>However, in August 2017, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (&ldquo;HUD&rdquo;) abruptly announced it would be delaying the rule&rsquo;s implementation for two years, claiming that further study was needed. HUD stated the agency was waiting for a final review of the Small Area FMR report and a further review of public comments. Additionally, HUD determined that the Public Housing Authorities had not been given enough guidance and technical assistance to implement the use of Small Area FMRs.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 2017, Open Communities Alliance and two individual plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against HUD and its Secretary. The complaint challenged HUD&rsquo;s decision to suspend a rule that would have assisted low-income families in securing affordable housing. The Plaintiffs claimed that the delay would only further racial and economic segregation, and argued that HUD&rsquo;s failure to implement the Small Area FMR rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act (&ldquo;APA&rdquo;), the statute that governs how federal agencies propose and implement regulations. The Plaintiffs, represented by the NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and private counsel, sought to temporarily and permanently enjoin the suspension of the rule.</p>\r\n<p>On December 23, 2017, Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell granted the Plaintiff&rsquo;s Motion for Preliminary Injunction, requiring HUD to reinstate the Small Area Fair Market Rent regulation, criticizing HUD's decision to suspend final rules for two years without notice or comment or evidentiary findings. 286 F.Supp.3d 148. The Defendants requested an extension to contemplate how to proceed with the litigation. The extension was granted, and the Defendants' response was due February 15, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>On February 15, 2018, the parties stipulated that the HUD would no longer delay implementing the FMR rules and allowed the court to enter judgment for the Plaintiffs. HUD acknowledged that it was in the process of implementing the FMR rules.</p>\r\n<p>The Plaintiffs then moved for attorney's fees. On February 15, 2018, the Court entered final judgment for the Plaintiffs. Attorney's fees of $154,272.11 were awarded on June 15, 2018. 2018 WL 8622230. HUD paid the fees, and the court closed the case on August 15, 2018.</p>",

This suit challenges the decision of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) to abruptly and unlawfully suspend implementation of its own promulgated \nrule, the Small Area Fair Market Rent Rule (Small Area FMR Rule). The rule provides that, as of \nJanuary 1, 2018, tens of thousands of low-income families who participate in the Housing \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 2 of 47\n \nChoice Voucher (HCV) program—families who disproportionally are African-American, Latino, \nand other racial minorities—can use their housing vouchers to move from poor and racially \nsegregated communities to areas that provide greater opportunity in education, jobs, and more. In \ndoing so, the Small Area FMR Rule aligns the federal government’s primary rent subsidy \nprogram with HUD’s statutory mandates to ensure fair housing and avoid contributing to \nconcentrated poverty.  \n2.  HUD has announced that it is suspending this important rule, depriving thousands \nof families of housing choices, without following notice-and-comment requirements or providing \nadequate reasons. Plaintiffs—two HCV voucher holders who want to move to areas of greater \nopportunity but are being blocked by HUD’s action from doing so, along with an organization \nwhose mission to foster such mobility is being frustrated—bring this action under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) to require HUD to implement the Small Area FMR Rule on \nschedule.    \n3.  The HCV program—formerly known as the Section 8 voucher program—\nprovides a housing subsidy to more than two million households nationwide, enabling them to \nsecure affordable, decent-quality housing in the private market. A participating household \ngenerally pays 30 percent of its monthly income towards rent. An HCV voucher covers the \nremainder of the total rent amount (including utilities), so long as the rent does not exceed an \namount based primarily on what HUD determines is the “fair market rent,” or FMR, for a \ncomparable dwelling in the area. By subsidizing housing through these vouchers, rather than \nthrough public housing projects, the HCV program aims to provide low-income families greater \ngeographic choice in housing. A primary objective of the HCV program is to permit low-income \nfamilies to settle throughout metropolitan areas, thereby avoiding the high concentrations of \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 3 of 47\n \npoverty and racial segregation that have been linked to significant adverse health, educational, \nand economic outcomes for children and adults.  \n4.  In operation, however, the HCV program has not provided this meaningful choice \nto participating families, in large part because of how HUD calculates a voucher’s worth. HUD \nhistorically has calculated FMRs based on the average rent for entire metropolitan regions, \nwithout regard for the stark differences in housing costs from neighborhood to neighborhood \nwithin such regions. In low-rent (and low-opportunity) neighborhoods, these crudely calculated \nFMRs exceed what the market would bear, providing some landlords with a substantial windfall \nat taxpayer expense. Conversely, those same FMRs are too low for HCV households to use their \nvouchers in higher-rent neighborhoods with better schools, employment options, transportation, \nand other opportunities.  \n5.  The Small Area FMR Rule, which HUD adopted in 2016 after years of \ncommunity input and careful study and analysis, is a major step toward correcting this problem. \nThe rule requires the public housing agencies (PHAs) that administer the HCV program locally \nto set voucher values in 24 metropolitan areas based on the prevailing private market rents for \neach distinct zip code within those regions. This revised methodology recognizes the existence of \nvery different local rental markets within each metropolitan area and calibrates vouchers more \nfinely to the amount needed to live in various neighborhoods. It thus enables voucher holders to \naccess a wider range of housing, outside of voucher-concentrated, racially-segregated areas. \n6.  The experiences of Plaintiffs Crystal Carter and Tiara Moore illustrate how the \nSmall Area FMR Rule transforms the FMR methodology from one that contributes to racial \nsegregation and concentrated poverty to one that helps combat it. Ms. Carter and Ms. Moore are \nAfrican-American women who want to use their HCV vouchers to move their families from poor \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 4 of 47\n \nareas of Hartford and Chicago, respectively, to the higher-rent (and predominantly white) \nsuburbs outside those cities. They have been stymied from doing so by voucher rates too low to \nsecure housing where they want to live. That situation is due to change on January 1, 2018, \npursuant to the Small Area FMR Rule.  \n7.  For example, Ms. Moore’s voucher currently allows her to rent a two-bedroom \napartment for about $1,200 per month anywhere in the greater Chicago area. That amount proved \ninadequate when she searched for such an apartment in DuPage County, just outside the City of \nChicago. Under the Small Area FMR Rule, her voucher would be worth as much as $1,770 per \nmonth for a two-bedroom apartment in DuPage County, allowing her to rent in this more \nexpensive housing market. \n8.  On August 11, 2017, HUD abruptly announced that it would not require PHAs to \nimplement the Small Area FMR Rule’s requirements in 23 of the 24 metropolitan areas subject \nto the rule. The only area where the Small Area FMR Rule was not suspended was Dallas, where \nHUD implemented small area FMRs pursuant to a fair housing settlement. Each of the 23 areas \naffected by HUD’s suspension of the small area FMR requirements encompasses multiple PHAs, \nwith approximately 175 PHAs in all. \n9.  HUD announced it would suspend the requirement for two years (until January 1, \n2020). It said it would entertain applications from PHAs wanting to use small area FMRs \nvoluntarily in the meantime, but also made clear that it would not be assisting PHAs in \nimplementing small area FMRs and indicated that PHAs would be unwise to do so. Because very \nfew PHAs will implement small area FMRs voluntarily under these circumstances, HUD \neffectively has suspended the rule altogether. HUD made no attempt to follow notice-and-\ncomment procedure in suspending a rule that will provide housing choice to thousands of low-\n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 5 of 47\n \nincome families; instead, it acted by writing letters to the PHAs and posting a notice on its \nwebsite. \n10.  There is no legal basis for HUD’s suspension of the rule. The APA does not \npermit it to suspend a promulgated rule without notice-and-comment procedure. HUD purports \nto invoke a provision in the rule that authorizes a temporary suspension in a specific area because \nof area-specific and unforeseen “events,” such as a natural disaster. This provision does not \nauthorize a wholesale suspension of the Small Area FMR Rule’s start date, and HUD pointed to \nno unforeseen “event” that would justify its invocation. \n11.  Nor are HUD’s stated justifications well-reasoned. HUD has pointed to (1) its \nown supposed failure to take preliminary steps towards implementation, which it contends left \nPHAs unprepared to implement small area FMRs; (2) a purported need to study the small area \nFMR issue yet further; and (3) comments filed in a rulemaking not devoted to small area FMRs \nthat made arguments HUD already considered and rejected in promulgating the rule. None of \nthese reasons can support HUD’s suspension of a duly promulgated rule. \n12.  HUD adopted the Small Area FMR Rule only after studying the issue for years, \ntesting the use of small area FMRs in demonstration projects that spanned several jurisdictions, \nand conducting a lengthy rulemaking process that included multiple rounds of comments. And \neven after HUD published the final rule on November 16, 2016, it did not require PHAs in the 23 \naffected jurisdictions to begin using small area FMRs until January 1, 2018, thus building in \nsufficient time for PHAs to prepare for implementation. There is no evidence that further delay \nwill accomplish anything but depriving voucher holders like Ms. Carter and Ms. Moore of long-\noverdue choice in housing. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 6 of 47\n \n13.  HUD also has claimed that its decision was based on a recently released study of \nthe PHAs that are implementing small area FMRs as a demonstration project. That study does \nnot, however, contain any information that undermines HUD’s conclusions when promulgating \nthe rule or otherwise justifies suspending the rule. Rather, the demonstration project report \nindicates that small area FMRs, as intended, result in more families using vouchers in high \nopportunity areas.  \n14.  HUD’s suspension of the Small Area FMR Rule will disproportionately hurt non-\nwhite families, who make up the majority of HCV voucher holders in most of the affected areas. \nIn these areas, because of crudely calculated FMRs, the HCV voucher program has perpetuated, \nrather than ameliorated, racial segregation and concentrations of residential poverty. HCV \nfamilies have for too long been effectively excluded from richer, whiter areas and consigned to \npoor, racially segregated neighborhoods, contrary to the Fair Housing Act’s mandate.   \n15.  In taking the actions described herein, HUD is violating the APA in multiple \nways, including by:  \n•  suspending a deadline contained in its own promulgated rule without providing \nproper notice and opportunity to comment; \n•  purporting to suspend this regulatory requirement based on information that it had \npreviously considered when promulgating the rule (and that, therefore, cannot \nconstitute changed circumstances that support suspending the rule);  \n•  improperly relying upon a narrow provision that authorizes a targeted suspension of \nthe rule’s requirements in a discrete area upon extraordinary circumstances as \nauthority for a wholesale suspension of the rule; and \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 7 of 47\n \n•  violating the statutory mandates that underlie the Small Area FMR Rule, including \nHUD’s duty to ensure that federal funds are spent in a way that affirmatively furthers \nfair housing rather than perpetuating racial segregation and its duty to ensure that the \nSection 8 program promotes economically mixed housing rather than concentrating \npoverty.  \n16.  HUD’s unlawful decision to postpone the requirement that affected PHAs begin \nimplementing the Small Area FMR Rule is causing irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and tens of \nthousands of other voucher families. HUD is failing to take preliminary steps to assist the PHAs \nin implementing small area FMRs on January 1, 2018. It also is inducing the PHAs themselves to \nstop preparing for implementation by telling them they will not be required to comply on that \ndate. Each day in which HUD takes no preparatory action itself and discourages the PHAs from \ntaking such action makes it harder to implement the rule on schedule, depriving voucher families \nof the choice of housing to which they are entitled. \n17.  Plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring HUD to \nrescind its notice to PHAs that they will not be required to comply with the January 1, 2018 \ndeadline and to take all other necessary steps to ensure that the timeline set forth in the Small \nArea FMR Rule is followed. The Small Area FMR Rule still can be implemented on time and in \nan orderly manner, but HUD will not do so without judicial intervention. \nPARTIES \n18.  Plaintiff Open Communities Alliance (OCA) is a non-profit corporation \nheadquartered in Hartford, Connecticut, one of the metropolitan areas affected by the Small Area \nFMR Rule. Its mission is to provide greater opportunities and more choices for people living in \nlow-opportunity areas in Connecticut, including by furthering the ability of HCV voucher \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 8 of 47\n \nholders and others to move to higher opportunity areas should they wish to do so. As described \nfurther below, its mission is being frustrated by HUD’s decision to suspend the rule’s mandatory \nimplementation, and it is diverting resources to remedy that frustration of its mission as a result. \n19.  Plaintiff Crystal Carter resides in Hartford, Connecticut, one of the areas where \nsmall area FMRs are scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2018. She is an African-American \nwoman who has sought to provide better opportunities for her children, including by using a \nregional school integration program to enroll them in a high-performing school district outside of \nHartford. She lives in a four-bedroom apartment that she rents with the assistance of an HCV \nvoucher. As described further below, she would like to use her voucher to secure housing in an \narea that would provide her family with better opportunities, but she is prevented from doing so \nby how HUD calculates FMRs. \n20.  Plaintiff Tiara Moore resides in Chicago, Illinois, one of the areas where small \narea FMRs are scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2018. She is an African-American \nwoman who lives with her 11-month-old daughter. She has been issued a voucher and would like \nto use it to secure housing outside Chicago, in a place that would provide better opportunities for \nherself and her daughter. As described further below, she is prevented from doing so by how \nHUD calculates FMRs. \n21.

The Housing Choice Voucher program is the federal government’s primary \nprogram for assisting very low-income families, the elderly, and people with disabilities in \naffording decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private rental market. As the HCV program’s \nname indicates, providing housing choice is its touchstone goal. \n26.  The HCV program is part of the regulatory scheme colloquially known as \n“Section 8,” which was established by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, \nPub. L. No. 93-383, Title II, § 201(a), 88 Stat. 633, now codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f. Congress \nhas amended the relevant laws several times, including in the Housing Community Development \nAct of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-242, § 143, 101 Stat. 1815, 1850 (1988), codified as amended at 42 \nU.S.C. § 1437f(o). As required by Congress, HUD has promulgated an extensive regulatory \nframework governing the HCV program. See 24 C.F.R. § 888.111 et seq.; 24 C.F.R. § 982.1 et \nseq.  \n27.  Section 8 consists of the HCV program, a variety of project-based rental \nassistance programs, and other housing subsidy programs. It has two statutory purposes: (1) \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 10 of 47\n \n“aiding low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live” and (2) “promoting \neconomically mixed housing.” 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a).  \n28.  This second aim—of “promoting economically mixed housing”—makes the HCV \nprogram different from pre-1974 federal housing programs, which focused on funding the \nconstruction and maintenance of large public housing facilities. Under that previous regime, \nfederal funds facilitated the concentration of large numbers of people living in extreme poverty, \noften in racially segregated conditions. See Gautreaux v. Romney, 448 F.2d 731, 739 (7th Cir. \n1971) (concluding that, in funding racially segregated housing projects, HUD’s “past actions \nconstituted racially discriminatory conduct in their own right”). \n29.  In 1967, President Johnson commissioned the National Advisory Committee on \nCivil Disorders (generally known as the “Kerner Commission”) to study the causes of recent \nurban unrest and recommend solutions. The Kerner Commission’s report, released in February \n1968, recommended, among other things, that “[f]ederal housing programs must be given a new \nthrust aimed at overcoming the prevailing patterns of racial segregation,” and must be \n“[r]eorient[ed]” to “place more low and moderate income housing outside of ghetto areas.” \nReport of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders: Summary of Report, at 24 \n(1968), https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=35837. Otherwise, it found, “those programs will \ncontinue to concentrate the most impoverished and dependent segments of the population into \nthe central-city ghettos.” Id. \n30.  Congress first responded to the Kerner Commission’s Report by passing the Fair \nHousing Act of 1968 (FHA), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. \nSee Tex. Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, 576 U.S. ____, 135 S. Ct. \n2507, 2515-16, 2525-26 (2015). The FHA barred discrimination in housing on the basis of race. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 11 of 47\n \nIt also imposed on HUD the “affirmative[]” obligation to ensure that federal housing programs \nfurther racial desegregation and the FHA’s other purposes, rather than contributing to racial \nsegregation and concentrations of poverty. 42 U.S.C. § 3608(e)(5). As HUD regulations confirm, \nthis requirement to “affirmatively further fair housing” requires recipients of federal housing \nfunds (including PHAs) to take “meaningful actions” to “overcome the legacy of segregation, \nunequal treatment, and historic lack of opportunity in housing.” 24 C.F.R. § 5.152; see also \nAffirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, 80 Fed. Reg. 42,272 (Jul. 16, 2015).  \n31.  As HUD Secretary George Romney immediately recognized, this obligation to \novercome the legacy of racial segregation requires the coordinated efforts of multiple \njurisdictions and PHAs, to ensure that residents of segregated metropolitan areas are not blocked \nat a city’s border by surrounding jurisdictions that want to keep them out. Secretary Romney \nstated: “[T]he impact of the concentration of the poor and minorities in the central city extends \nbeyond the city boundaries to include the surrounding community. The City and the suburbs \ntogether make up what I call the ‘real city.’ To solve problems of the ‘real city,’ only \nmetropolitan-wide solutions will do.” Gautreaux v. Chi. Hous. Auth., 503 F.2d 930, 937 (7th Cir. \n1974) (quoting Statement by Secretary Romney, Appendix Z to HUD’s Memorandum to the \ncourt). \n32.  Then, in 1974, Congress revamped federal spending on low-income housing. It \ncreated the Section 8 program, which provides monthly rental subsidies to private owners who \nrent to people with low incomes, rather than housing those low-income people in government-\nowned property.  \n33.  The Section 8 program at first operated primarily through so-called “project \nbased” funding, i.e., contracting with building owners who offer reduced rents to low-income \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 12 of 47\n \nhouseholds in exchange for subsidies. Over the years, it has been transformed such that the \nprimary form of Section 8 subsidy is a “tenant-based” program that uses vouchers to subsidize \nrental payments tenants make to participating landlords. This program, now known as the \nHousing Choice Voucher program, gives low-income households more options and, when \nproperly implemented, empowers them to move to places of greater opportunity. Congress and \nHUD over the years have added and expanded features such as “portability”—pursuant to which \na voucher holder can move outside the jurisdiction of the PHA administering her voucher—in a \ncontinuing effort to expand voucher holders’ choices. As described below, however, those \nchoices have been unnecessarily and unreasonably constrained by how HUD has calculated the \namount that vouchers are worth. \nHUD’s Calculation of Fair Market Rents \n34.  HUD oversees, implements, and regulates the HCV program. Among other \nthings, it provides federal funding to and regulates PHAs, which administer the program locally \nby issuing vouchers to qualified individuals and families.  \n35.  Households participating in the HCV program use vouchers to secure housing in \nthe private rental market. Vouchers can be used for any housing that meets the program’s \nrequirements (including housing quality and rent standards), subject to the PHA’s approval. \n36.  The voucher’s value is based largely on HUD’s determination of the “fair market \nrent” for the size and type of dwelling in question (e.g., two-bedroom home). The FMR \nrepresents the amount of money that is required “to rent standard quality housing throughout the \ngeographic area in which rental housing units are in competition,” including “the cost of utilities, \nexcept telephone.” 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(a). HUD generally sets the FMR for a unit size at what it \ncalls “the 40th percentile rent,” i.e., a dollar amount at which 40 percent of rentals for standard-\n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 13 of 47\n \nquality units of that size (excluding newly built units, public housing units, and sub-standard \nquality units) are for a lower amount. Id.   \n37.  HUD is required to annually calculate and publish FMRs for different unit sizes in \neach market area.1 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1)(B); 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1). These rates become \neffective on October 1 each year. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1)(A). Any changes HUD proposes to \nmake to the FMR calculation procedures must also be published in the Federal Register. 42 \nU.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1)(B). \n38.  PHAs, in turn, must use those FMRs to establish “payment standards” for each \nunit type, effectively setting a cap on permissible “gross rent” (which includes utilities). A PHA \nmay set its payment standards between 90 and 110 percent of the HUD-calculated fair market \nrents. 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(b). Absent a “small-area FMR” designation (discussed below), a PHA \nmay vary payment standards within its market area—that is, it may set payment standards at 90 \npercent of the FMR in one neighborhood and at 110 percent in another—but it must honor the \n“basic range” established by HUD. 24 C.F.R. §§ 982.503(a)(3), (b)(2). In practice, few PHAs \nexercise this discretionary authority; most, instead, set a single payment standard for any type of \ndwelling within their market areas. A PHA may only set payment standards higher than 110 \npercent of the regional FMR (generally up to 120 percent) with documented need and explicit \nHUD approval.  \n39.  So long as a dwelling’s actual gross rent is at or below the relevant payment \nstandard, the participating household usually pays the landlord 30 percent of its monthly income \n                                                           \n1 In the past, HUD has published the fair market rents in the Federal Register. More recently, it \nhas published a notice in the Federal Register alerting the public that updated FMRs are available \non its website. FMRs for FY 2018—as well as previous years—can be found on HUD’s website \nat https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr.html. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 14 of 47\n \ntoward the rent, while the PHA pays the balance directly to the landlord. If, however, the actual \nrent for the apartment exceeds the payment standard, the participating household is usually \nresponsible for the balance. See 24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a)(3). Participation in the HCV program is \nlimited to low-income households, so this additional payment responsibility makes unaffordable \nto them dwellings where the actual rent substantially exceeds the payment standard. \n40.  The proper functioning of the HCV program thus depends on HUD setting FMRs \nthat mirror as closely as possible the actual rents being charged in the relevant private markets.  \nProblems with Fair Market Rents Based on Broad Metropolitan Areas \n41.  In practice, HUD’s FMRs have not accurately reflected the actual rents charged in \nmany neighborhoods within large metropolitan areas. That is because rents tend to vary widely \nwithin such regions—particularly those that are highly segregated by race, such as Chicago, \nHartford, or Baltimore. Rents in more desirable, lower poverty (and, typically, whiter) \ncommunities far exceed the regional average, while rents in poorer neighborhoods are much \nlower. Without FMRs that account for these neighborhood differences, the practical result is that \nHCV families are relegated to poor, racially segregated neighborhoods, unable to use their \nvouchers to secure housing in higher opportunity areas.  \n42.  HUD has been aware of this simple truth for decades. Indeed, from the outset of \nthe Section 8 program, HUD has been criticized for failing to calculate accurate fair market rents \nthat would permit families receiving Section 8 subsidies to live in all parts of metropolitan areas. \n43.  As early as 1977, a Comptroller General report to Congress noted that FMRs were \n“too low for program success” and that the calculation of FMRs by metropolitan area “ignores \nimportant distinctions between metropolitan central cities and suburban areas as well as among \nsuburban areas.” Comptroller Gen. of the U.S., CED-77-19, Major Changes Are Needed in the \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 15 of 47\n \nNew Leased-Housing Program, at 16, 21 (1977), http://www.gao.gov/assets/120/113728.pdf. \nThe same point has been made many times since, yet until adoption of the Small Area FMR \nRule, HUD failed to address it adequately. \n44.  HUD’s long-time failure to modify the program to address these concerns has had \npredictable results: a disproportionate number of HCV voucher holders end up living in areas of \nconcentrated poverty.  \n45.  In areas where HCV voucher holders disproportionately are racial minorities, this \nconcentration of voucher holders in high-poverty neighborhoods also contributes to racial \nsegregation. HUD’s Small Area FMR Rule focuses on precisely those areas: in 21 of the 24 \nmetropolitan areas covered by the rule, at least two-thirds of HCV users are non-white. In such \nareas, African-American and Latino voucher holders are particularly likely to live in \nneighborhoods that are poor as well as racially segregated.   \n46.  The greater Hartford area, home to plaintiffs OCA and Crystal Carter, illustrates \nthis well. In that area, 80 percent of HCV voucher holders are non-white (50 percent Latino, 30 \npercent African-American), compared with only 31 percent of the overall population. With \nFMRs calculated for the entire area, this predominantly non-white population has been \nconcentrated in poor, racially segregated neighborhoods.  \n47.  As of 2016, 41 percent of voucher households in the greater Hartford area (the \nHartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, CT HUD Metro FMR Area) live in high-poverty \nneighborhoods (census tracts with a poverty rate above 30 percent). By contrast, only 18 percent \nof voucher households in the area live in low-poverty neighborhoods (census tracts with a \npoverty rate below 10 percent). Sixty-seven percent of HCV households in the region live in \nmajority-minority neighborhoods. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 16 of 47\n \n48.  This concentration of voucher holders in the greater Hartford area in a few very \npoor areas—with many fewer voucher holders living in surrounding, low-poverty areas—is \nillustrated by the map below: \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 17 of 47\n \n49.  Similarly, the racial concentration map below illustrates the concentration of \nHartford-area voucher holders—who are themselves almost all non-white—in the small number \nof neighborhoods in the region that are predominantly non-white: \n \n50.  The Hartford area is representative of how HCV voucher holders in the areas \naffected by the Small Area FMR Rule are concentrated in poor, racially segregated \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 18 of 47\n \nneighborhoods. To cite one more example, in the greater Atlanta area (Atlanta-Sandy Springs-\nRoswell, GA HUD Metro FMR Area), 96 percent of HCV voucher holders are non-white (92 \npercent African-American), compared with only 51 percent of the overall population. Eighty-\neight percent of these HCV households in the region live in majority-minority neighborhoods, \nwhile 43 percent live in high-poverty neighborhoods. Just 8 percent of HCV households in the \ngreater Atlanta area live in low-poverty areas.  \n51.  This concentration of predominantly minority voucher holders in low-income \nneighborhoods has lifelong negative consequences for those voucher holders and their children.2 \nStudies have found a link between neighborhood poverty and children’s emotional health, \ncognitive development, and educational achievement.3 Neighborhood location can also affect \nadults’ access to jobs, transportation, food, and other basic goods and services.4 \n52.  Conversely, providing voucher holders the opportunity to move to high \nopportunity neighborhoods has demonstrated positive effects on both adults and children. In the \n1990s, HUD conducted an experiment entitled “Moving to Opportunity,” which offered \nrandomly selected families living in high-poverty housing projects vouchers that allowed them to \nmove to lower-poverty neighborhoods. Several analyses of the experiment demonstrated that \nmoving to lower-poverty areas greatly improved the mental health, physical health, and self-\n                                                           \n2 See, e.g., Patrick Sharkey, Stuck in Place: Urban Neighborhoods and the End of Progress \nToward Racial Equality (University of Chicago Press, 2013). \n3 See, e.g., Jennifer Darrah & Stefanie DeLuca, “Living Here Has Changed My Whole \nPerspective”: How Escaping Inner-City Poverty Shapes Neighborhood and Housing Choice, \n33(2) J.

For example, \nchildren who moved out of public housing to a low-poverty area at a young age were more likely \nto attend college and earn higher incomes. Id. at 857-59, 899. \n53.  In the preamble to the Small Area FMR Rule, HUD explained its determination \nthat alternatives to the use of small area FMRs are inefficient and inadequate to address the \nvoucher concentration created by area-wide fair market rent calculations. \n54.  For example, in 2000, HUD tried to address the issue of voucher concentration by \nraising rents across the board in the most concentrated regions. It did so by setting FMRs and \npayment standards based on the 50th percentile market rent, rather than the 40th percentile \nmarket rent, for certain geographic areas where such a change seemed appropriate. See, e.g., 65 \nFed. Reg. 58,870 (Oct. 2, 2000); 66 Fed. Reg. 50,024 (Oct. 1, 2001) (implementing new rule and \nsetting out affected areas). On average, this program resulted in an FMR increase of 7.3 percent. \n80 Fed. Reg. 31,332, 31,334-35 (Jun. 2, 2015).  \n55.  Concurrent with its adoption of the Small Area FMR Rule, HUD is now phasing \nout this 50th Percentile FMR program, after concluding that 50th percentile FMRs do not \nprovide substantially increased opportunities for tenants or measurably reduce concentration of \n                                                           \n5 See, e.g., Jens Ludwig, et al., Long-Term Neighborhood Effects on Low-Income Families:  \nEvidence from Moving to Opportunity, 103(3) American Economic Review 226 (2013); \nLawrence F. Katz, et al., Moving to Opportunity in Boston: Early Results of a Randomized \nMobility Experiment, 116(2) Quarterly Journal of Economics 607 (2001).   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 20 of 47\n \npoverty. 80 Fed. Reg. 31,333. Instead, “much of the benefit . . . simply accrues to landlords in \nlower rent submarket areas.” 81 Fed. Reg. 80,567, 80,570 (Nov. 16, 2016). That is because 50th \npercentile FMRs result in payment standards that are still too low to provide access to higher \nopportunity neighborhoods, yet at the same time are too high elsewhere and thus “unnecessarily \nrais[e] subsidies in neighborhoods with lower rents.” 80 Fed. Reg. 31,335. In short, the 50th \npercentile FMR experiment simply reaffirmed the need for HUD to better align its FMRs to the \nvarying rental markets within broad metropolitan areas. \nHUD’s Experience with Small Area FMRs Prior to Its Rulemaking \n56.  By the time HUD completed the rulemaking at issue here, it had considerable \nexperience with the results of using small area FMRs and the mechanics of implementing them. \n57.  In 2007, the Inclusive Communities Project (ICP) filed a lawsuit against HUD \nchallenging its setting of a single FMR for the 12-county Dallas metropolitan region. ICP alleged \nthat, by fashioning an FMR based on rent data from such a wide area, HUD was effectively \nsteering voucher holders—who, in that area, are predominantly African-American—away from \npredominantly white areas (where the FMR was inadequate to meet neighborhood market rents) \nand into predominantly minority areas. ICP alleged that HUD thus violated the Fair Housing Act \nand the Housing and Community Development Act. Complaint at ¶¶ 25, 36-37, Inclusive Cmtys. \nProject, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. and Urban Dev., No. 3:07-CV-0945 (N.D. Tex. May 29, \n2007). \n58.  HUD settled ICP’s lawsuit in 2010 by agreeing to institute Small Area FMRs \ncalculated at the zip code level in Dallas. \n59.  Also in 2010, HUD announced plans for a demonstration project that would test \nthe viability of a broader requirement that PHAs use small area FMRs. Section 8 Housing Choice \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 21 of 47\n \nVoucher Program, 75 Fed. Reg. 27,808, 27,811 (May 18, 2010). In 2012, five PHAs in five \ndifferent states began using small area FMRs pursuant to this project. Meanwhile, pursuant to the \nICP settlement, PHAs in Dallas also began using small area FMRs.  \n60.  These pilot projects have proven that small area FMRs are both administratively \nfeasible to implement and effective at accomplishing their goals. \n61.  For example, researchers Robert Collinson and Peter Ganong conducted an \nindependent study of the use of small area FMRs in Dallas pursuant to the ICP settlement. They \ndetermined that this change resulted in many voucher recipients exiting the lowest-rent \nneighborhoods in the inner city and moving to higher-rent neighborhoods. Collinson & Ganong, \nThe Incidence of Housing Voucher Generosity, at 15-16 (Apr. 2016), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol\n3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2255799. They found this effect to be “statistically large and \neconomically significant” and determined that the program added no net cost to the government. \nId., at 18-19. \n62.  The other demonstration project has had comparable results. By 2016, HUD had \nenough data from the demonstration project to state as part of its regulatory impact statement \nthat, in the areas being studied, the average neighborhood poverty level of voucher holders \ndeclined, as did overall subsidy payments. That is, small area FMRs led to voucher holders \nmoving out of impoverished neighborhoods and saved HUD money overall.

Since 2010, HUD has annually calculated small area FMRs by zip code for every \nmetropolitan area in the U.S. These numbers, which are publicly available on HUD’s website, \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 22 of 47\n \ndemonstrate concretely how small area FMRs can provide choice to HCV voucher holders—\nchoice that HUD is denying them by suspending the requirement that PHAs put small area FMRs \ninto effect. \n64.  For example, in the Chicago area, payment standards based on HUD’s small area \nFMRs would allow a voucher holder to secure a two-bedroom apartment in high-opportunity \nDuPage County—where plaintiff Tiara Moore wishes to live—renting for $1,300-$1,770 per \nmonth in most zip codes in the county.6 By contrast, without the use of small area FMRs, a two-\nbedroom apartment in any of the same zip codes would have an FMR of only $1,180.7 As Tiara \nMoore has found, it is considerably harder to rent a two-bedroom apartment in DuPage County \nfor that amount than it is for the higher amount that results from application of small area FMRs.   \n65.  The situation is similar in the Hartford area, where plaintiff Crystal Carter would \nlike to move from the city of Hartford to Simsbury, CT (zip code 06070), a predominantly white, \nlow-poverty, high-opportunity community outside of the city. Payment standards based on \nHUD’s small area FMRs would allow her to secure a four-bedroom apartment or house renting \nfor up to $1,940.8 By contrast, an FMR based on average rents across the broad Hartford region \nis only $1,620 for a four-bedroom apartment or house.9 Again, that amount is inadequate to \n                                                           \n6 See U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FY 2018 Hypothetical Small Area \nFMRs for Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL HUD Metro FMR Area.

All 2018 FMRs (that is, those not based on small areas) can be accessed at \nhttps://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr/fmrs/FY2018_code/select_Geography.odn.    \n8 See FY 2018 Hypothetical Small Area FMRs for Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, CT \nMetro FMR Area.  \n9 See FY 2018 Fair Market Rent Documentation System for Hartford-West Hartford-East \nHartford, CT HUD Metro FMR Area. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 23 of 47\n \npermit a voucher holder such as Ms. Carter the housing choice that the HCV voucher program is \nsupposed to provide. \n66.  Similar patterns exist in each of the other metropolitan areas subject to the \nmandatory Small Area FMR rule. Indeed, these areas were selected in part because they are areas \nwhere HCVs are exceptionally concentrated, and where implementing small area FMRs would \ngive low-income HCV voucher families the practical ability to move to lower poverty, less \nracially segregated neighborhoods.   \n67.  Thus, by the time it completed the rulemaking at issue here in 2016, HUD had \nyears of experience working with various PHAs to implement small area FMRs in different parts \nof the country. That experience made it clear both that small area FMRs work and that their \nimplementation is quite feasible. It also helped HUD to select those areas where implementation \nwould do the most to bring HUD’s administration of the HCV program into alignment with \nHUD’s statutory requirements. \nHUD Rulemaking \n68.  Having laid the groundwork for a larger roll-out of small area FMRs, HUD \nengaged in an intensive, year-and-a-half-long rulemaking process, with multiple opportunities \nfor public comment, culminating in the Small Area FMR Rule. \n69.  On June 2, 2015, HUD announced its intention to promulgate a rule pursuant to \nwhich some FMRs would be implemented by zip code rather than broader area. 80 Fed. Reg. \n31,332. HUD stated that its “experience with the SAFMR demonstration” suggested that broader \nuse of small area FMRs “could provide HCV tenants greater access to higher opportunity, lower \npoverty neighborhoods.” 80 Fed. Reg. 31,333.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 24 of 47\n \n70.  HUD sought comment on a variety of questions, including how broadly the \nprogram should be applied and the criteria it should use for selecting areas. In particular, HUD \nsought comment regarding the experiences of PHAs currently using small area FMRs, in the \ndemonstration areas and in Dallas. 80 Fed. Reg. 31,336. HUD received 78 comments in \nresponse, including several that urged it not to take any further action until the demonstration \nproject was completed.  \n71.  With the benefit of that input, on June 16, 2016, HUD published a proposed rule \nthat would make small area FMRs mandatory only in select jurisdictions meeting certain criteria, \nincluding a high level of voucher concentration and market conditions that would make small \narea FMRs particularly effective in ameliorating that concentration. 81 Fed. Reg. 39,218.  \n72.  HUD considered and rejected the suggestion that it wait for full results from the \ndemonstration project before promulgating a rule. The agency agreed that implementation of \nsmall area FMRs nationwide would be premature. It explained, however, that its rule covered \nonly specified areas where use of small area FMRs would be particularly appropriate. 81 Fed. \nReg. 39,223. HUD further committed to closely study implementation results and facilitate \nspecific research over the next five years. 81 Fed. Reg. 39,226. \n73.  HUD also considered and rejected a proposal to make implementation of small \narea FMRs voluntary rather than mandatory for PHAs within the affected areas. It observed that \nthe purpose of small area FMRs is to provide voucher holders the effective ability to choose \nhousing throughout the larger area, and allowing some PHAs within that area to opt out of the \nrule would be inconsistent with that goal. 81 Fed. Reg. 39,224.  \n74.  In the notice of proposed rulemaking, HUD sought comment on a variety of \nadditional questions about specific implementation issues, including how to reduce the \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 25 of 47\n \nadministrative burden on PHAs and simplify the transition to small area FMRs, and it invited \nfurther comment more generally. It received 113 comments in response. \n75.  On November 16, 2016, HUD published the final Small Area FMR Rule. The rule \nrequires that PHAs in 24 designated metropolitan areas use payment standards based on small \narea FMRs beginning on January 1, 2018. See Final Rule: Establishing a More Effective Fair \nMarket Rent System, 81 Fed. Reg. 80,567 (Nov. 16, 2016). It thus extends Small Area FMR \nimplementation to an additional 230,000 voucher households (about 10 percent of all HCV \nvoucher holders) spread across 175 PHAs.   \n76.  HUD explained that the Small Area FMR Rule is intended to reduce “the number \nof voucher families that reside in areas of high poverty concentration.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,567. \nHUD found that its former policies had “not proven effective in addressing the problem of \nconcentrated poverty and economic and racial segregation in neighborhoods.” Id. The Small \nArea FMR Rule, HUD found, was necessary to give voucher holders “a subsidy that is adequate \nto cover rents” in “areas of high opportunity.” Id. \n77.  Consistent with its statements in the proposed rulemaking, HUD limited the Small \nArea FMR Rule’s application to metropolitan areas where it would be particularly effective \nbased on local housing conditions. It determined that the rule should apply to areas with at least \n2,500 vouchers in use that have both (1) “significant voucher concentration challenges” and (2) \nrental market conditions, such as a sufficiently high vacancy rate, making it likely that higher \nvouchers could actually be used effectively in high opportunity areas. 81 Fed. Reg. 80,568-69; \nsee also 81 Fed. Reg. 80,576 (explaining that markets with low vacancy rates are not as good \ncandidates for immediate implementation). HUD set objective criteria for determining which \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 26 of 47\n \nareas qualify, with the coverage determination to be made at the beginning of each federal fiscal \nyear. 81 Fed. Reg. 80,568.   \n78.  For areas covered by the Small Area FMR Rule, fair market rents are to be \ndetermined for each zip code. Zip codes, HUD found, “are small enough to reflect neighborhood \ndifferences” and provide for easy and objective administration. 81 Fed. Reg. 80,568. \n79.  The Small Area FMR Rule provides that PHAs have three months to update their \npayment standards to be based on small area FMRs once the latest FMRs are published and \nbecome effective at the start of the new fiscal year, on October 1, 2017. Thus, PHAs have until \nJanuary 1, 2018 to update their payment standards. 81 Fed. Reg. 80,569. \n80.  In the final rule, HUD added language empowering it to temporarily suspend a \nsmall area FMR designation in unusual circumstances. That provision, 24 C.F.R. \n§ 888.113(c)(4), states: \nHUD will designate Small Area FMR areas at the beginning of a Federal fiscal \nyear, such designations will be permanent, and will make new area designations \nevery 5 years thereafter as new data becomes available. HUD may suspend a \nSmall Area FMR designation from a metropolitan area, or may temporarily \nexempt a PHA in a Small Area FMR metropolitan area from use of the Small \nArea FMRs, when HUD by notice makes a documented determination that such \naction is warranted. Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small \nArea FMRs are: \n(i)  A Presidentially declared disaster area that results in the loss of a \nsubstantial number of housing units; \n(ii)  A sudden influx of displaced households needing permanent housing; or \n(iii)  Other events as determined by the Secretary. \n \n81.  The description of § 888.113(c)(4) in the rule’s preamble confirms that HUD may \nsuspend a designation only for “events,” such as a natural disaster, that affect housing conditions \nin a specific area: \nProvides HUD may suspend a Small Area FMR designation for a metropolitan \narea, including at the request of a PHA, where HUD determines such action is \nwarranted based on a documented finding of adverse rental housing market \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 27 of 47\n \nconditions that will be set out by notice (for example, the metropolitan area \nexperiences a significant loss of housing units as a result of a natural disaster).  \n \n81 Fed. Reg. 80,569. \n \n82.  In the final rule, HUD made other changes to ameliorate concerns expressed in \ncomments. For example, some comments expressed concern that lowered payment standards in \nlower-rent neighborhoods could hurt voucher holders in those neighborhoods with existing \nleases based on the previous, higher standards. In response, HUD authorized PHAs to “hold \nharmless” for an extended time such households. 81 Fed. Reg. 80,572. \n83.  HUD also made changes to reduce the administrative burden on PHAs. For \nexample, the Small Area FMR Rule relaxes HUD’s preexisting requirement that PHAs conduct a \nnew “rent reasonableness review” for voucher-supported leases when the relevant FMRs decline. \nWhereas previously PHAs were required to make a new determination of whether the rent \ncharged remains reasonable when FMRs dropped five percent, now they only must do so upon a \nten percent drop. 81 Fed. Reg. 80,575. \n84.  HUD acknowledged the possibility of “administrative expenses associated with \nimplementation on the part of PHAs,” but determined that this cost was outweighed by the \nbenefits of the rule. 81 Fed. Reg. 80,569. \n85.  HUD once again considered and rejected the argument that the rule’s \npromulgation should await final results from the demonstration project. The agency concluded \nthat “it is not premature to implement Small Area FMRs on this limited basis in those areas \nwhere it has the potential to address significant voucher concentration concerns.” 81 Fed. Reg. \n80,579. \n86.  In announcing the Small Area FMR Rule’s promulgation and summarizing the \nrule’s requirements, HUD also stated its intention to take a variety of preliminary steps to \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 28 of 47\n \nfacilitate implementation. These steps included providing guidance and support to PHAs \nimplementing small area FMRs; webinars to share lessons learned and best practices from PHAs \nalready implementing small Area FMRs; and exploration of a mobile application to enable \ntenants to confirm a particular unit’s payment standard by entering the address. Key Aspects of \nHUD’s Final Rule on Small Area Fair Market Rents, http://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/fmr \n/fmr2016f/SAFMR-Key-Aspects-of-Final-Rule.pdf.   \n87.  The Small Area FMR Rule became effective on January 17, 2017. \nEvidence of Small Area FMRs Working \n88.  Since promulgating the Small Area FMR Rule, HUD has received further \nevidence regarding the effectiveness of small area FMRs in its demonstration projects. HUD \ncommissioned an extensive report, termed the Interim Evaluation, and released it publicly on \nAugust 15, 2017. The Interim Evaluation examines changes in the demonstration areas between \n2010 and 2015, and thus compares their trends pre- and post-use of small area FMRs. It also \ncompares findings in the demonstration sites against those for a group of 138 agencies not using \nsmall area FMRs. The Evaluation confirms the viability and importance of small area FMRs. \nSmall Area Fair Market Rent Demonstration Evaluation, Interim Report (Aug. \n2017), http://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/SAFMR-Interim-Report.pdf. \n89.  The Interim Evaluation found that, in demonstration sites where PHAs used small \narea FMRs, significantly more voucher holders moved to high-opportunity neighborhoods, even \nas overall housing subsidy costs fell. By contrast, the same beneficial effects were not seen for \ncomparable PHAs not subject to the demonstration project. Interim Evaluation at viii-x; 37-38. \n90.  Although the Interim Evaluation found some adverse impacts for tenants at some \nof the PHAs studied, it concluded that the Small Area FMR Rule anticipated these problems and \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 29 of 47\n \nmade changes to prevent them from recurring. For example, the Interim Evaluation found that \nsome voucher holders paid somewhat more in out-of-pocket rent in the demonstration sites \n(Interim Evaluation at vii-viii; 94-96), but the FMR Rule contains several provisions to protect \ntenants from such increases. 81 Fed. Reg. 80,572. Similarly, the Interim Evaluation found that, \nwhen some but not all PHAs within the same metropolitan area switch to small area FMRs, the \nresult within those jurisdictions can be a reduction in the total units that are offered for rent at or \nbelow the revised FMRs (Interim Evaluation at vii-viii; 32-36). The Small Area FMR Rule \naddresses this problem by making small area FMRs mandatory for all PHAs within specified \nregions, such that even if fewer units are available in some places, such losses will be offset by \ngains elsewhere. That is, this finding in the Interim Evaluation supports the Small Area FMR \nRule’s mandatory implementation for PHAs, not HUD’s suspension of that requirement. \n91.  The Interim Evaluation also found modest increases in administrative costs for \nPHAs, most of them of a one-time nature. For example, PHAs implementing small area FMRs \nfor the first time had to adjust computer software systems and amend client briefing materials. \nInterim Evaluation at x-xi; 68-84. However, these costs largely were not recurring, and they were \nmore than offset by cost savings from implementing the small area FMRs. Id. They also could be \nfurther ameliorated by HUD issuing guidance and providing technical assistance where needed, \ndrawing on the lessons of the demonstration project to reduce costs and administrative burden for \nlater PHAs.  \nHUD Suspension of the PHAs’ Requirements Under the Small Area FMR Rule \n92.  To date, HUD has not taken any of the steps that it publicly stated it would take to \nhelp PHAs implement the rule. For example, it has not provided affected PHAs with any \nguidance as to implementation. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 30 of 47\n \n93.  Instead, HUD has announced that it is suspending for two years the requirement \nthat PHAs affected by the Small Area FMR Rule must implement payment standards based on \nsmall area FMRs on January 1, 2018. HUD has not published a notice of this decision in the \nFederal Register and has not solicited public comment on it. Nor has it sought to amend the \nSmall Area FMR Rule. \n94.  According to HUD, its decision is based in part on comments it received in a \nproceeding not devoted to the Small Area FMR Rule. \n95.  On May 15, 2017, HUD published a notice in the Federal Register soliciting \ncomments on which existing HUD regulations it should consider repealing, replacing, or \nmodifying. See Notice and Request for Comment: Reducing Regulatory Burden; Enforcing the \nRegulatory Reform Agenda Under Executive Order 13777, 82 Fed. Reg. 22,344, 22,344-45 \n(May 15, 2017). This document did not specifically mention the Small Area FMR Rule; nor did \nmost of the comments HUD received in response. \n96.  The National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO), a \ngroup that characterizes itself as “a leader in the deregulation of programs and the design of \nprograms which provide the maximum flexibility at the local level,” used this opportunity to ask \nHUD to suspend the Small Area FMR Rule’s requirements for PHAs. NAHRO.org, History \n(accessed Oct. 20, 2017), http://www.nahro.org/nahro-history. Prior to the May 15 notice, \nNAHRO had sent HUD an unsolicited letter making this request, and it incorporated that letter \ninto its comments to the May 15 notice. NAHRO asserted that HUD, by filing a notice in the \nFederal Register invoking 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4)(iii), could make compliance with the rule \nvoluntary for all affected PHAs. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 31 of 47\n \n97.  On August 11, 2017—before the Interim Evaluation was publicly released—HUD \nannounced the suspension of the requirement that PHAs implement payment standards based on \nsmall area FMRs. It did so by sending identical letters to PHAs in 23 of the 24 areas governed by \nthe Rule. Each letter stated that HUD would not require the PHA to begin using small area FMRs \non January 1, 2018, and instead would suspend that requirement for two years, until January 1, \n2020. See Exhibit A. The only PHAs not to receive such a letter were the ones serving Dallas-\nPlano-Irving, Texas, which had been using small area FMRs pursuant to settlement of the ICP \ncase described above. \n98.  HUD has not published a notice of this decision in the Federal Register and has \nnot solicited public comment on it.  \n99.  In its letter to PHAs, HUD stated that its action should not be treated as “a \nsuspension of the Small Area Final Rule or a regulatory waiver.” Exhibit A, at 3. Rather, as \nNAHRO had suggested, HUD relied solely on its purported authority under 24 C.F.R. § \n888.113(c)(4) to suspend the rule’s application separately for each affected area. Id. HUD did not \npoint to any area-specific event to justify its action with respect to any of the affected areas. \n100.  HUD stated that its action was based, first, on its internal review of the Interim \nEvaluation’s findings from the small area FMR demonstration project—findings that were not \nyet available to the public. These interim findings, HUD stated, “suggest the need for further \nanalysis of the benefits and costs of Small Area FMR, particularly with respect to the impact on \nrent burdens on participating families and the availability of units in the metropolitan area.” \nExhibit A, at 1. HUD did not explain which data from the Interim Evaluation supported this \nconclusion or how the Interim Evaluation’s findings were inconsistent with information available \nat the time of the Small Area FMR Rule’s promulgation. HUD further stated, without \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 32 of 47\n \nelaboration, that “a policy change of this magnitude should be fully informed by the final report \non the completed demonstration,” expected in July 2018. Id. It did not attempt to reconcile this \nstatement with its express rejection of the same argument in the published Small Area FMR \nRule, at which time the report was well underway. \n101.  Second, HUD stated that, in response to its May 15 invitation for comments on \nregulatory change, “several PHA industry groups” had expressed “concerns about the Small \nArea FMR final rule and the timeline for implementation.” Exhibit A, at 2. It stated that its action \nwould allow it “to be informed by the public comments on reducing regulatory burden for the \nHCV program” as well as its own decision as to whether to “implement changes to reduce the \nregulatory burden on the HCV program.” Id. \n102.  Finally, HUD pointed to its own failure to take preliminary steps to assist PHAs \nin complying with their obligations under the Small Area FMR Rule. It admitted that it had \nbegun “developing guidance and planning to provide technical assistance to assist PHAs that \nmust implement the use of the Small Area FMRs as a result of the final rule” but decided not to \ncontinue. Exhibit A, at 2. Instead of meeting its obligations under law, HUD stated, it chose to \n“focus[] on soliciting input and feedback from PHAs and other stakeholders on a variety of \nregulations and policies, including the Small Area FMR Final Rule.” Id. As justification for its \ndeliberate choice not to take preliminary steps to best implement the rule, HUD repeated that (1) \nit was waiting for the 2018 final report on the small area demonstration project and (2) it might \ndecide to alter the rule. \n103.  After advising PHAs that it would be unwise to proceed with small area FMRs, \nand suspending the requirement that they do so by January 1, 2018, HUD said it would entertain \napplications from PHAs that nonetheless wished to use small area FMRs voluntarily. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 33 of 47\n \n104.  On August 15, 2017, HUD published its Interim Evaluation. It still did not, \nhowever, explain how that document supported its decision to suspend PHAs’ requirements \nunder the Small Area FMR Rule.  \n105.  On August 25, 2017, Todd M. Richardson, HUD’s Acting General Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research, made a public statement, posted on \nHUD’s website.  \n106.  Mr. Richardson stated that the decision to delay PHAs’ obligations was for the \nbenefit of the affected PHAs, which he contended were not ready to proceed and “needed more \ntime to integrate this big change into their voucher programs.” He further stated that the delay \nwould allow PHAs to review the findings of the demonstration project and “make sure their \nprograms are informed by the lessons learned by these early adopters.” See Exhibit B. \n107.  Mr. Richardson cited the Interim Evaluation as influencing these conclusions, but \ndid not explain what in that report justified them. And he stated that the Interim Evaluation \n“confirms that Small Area FMRs do open up previously inaccessible neighborhoods for voucher \ntenants” and that “with good planning, it is possible to have a successful program that does not \nbreak the bank.”  \n108.  HUD has provided no further explanation for its actions. \nIrreparable Injury to Plaintiffs and Others Caused by HUD’s Actions  \n \n109.  HUD’s decision not to require PHAs to implement the Small Area FMR Rule on \nschedule is causing, and will continue to cause, irreparable injury to Plaintiffs and others. \n110.  As HUD has repeatedly acknowledged, FMRs calculated by averaging private-\nmarket rents across broad metropolitan areas restrict voucher holders’ housing options. In the \nabsence of the Small Area FMR Rule’s adjustments to HUD’s methodology, voucher holders in \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 34 of 47\n \n23 of the 24 affected areas (not those in the Dallas area, where small area FMRs continue \npursuant to the ICP settlement) will continue to be artificially concentrated in poorer, low-rent, \nand often racially segregated areas, because their vouchers are insufficient for them to rent in \nareas of greater opportunity.  \n111.  HUD has repeatedly found that small area FMRs mitigate those effects and, in \nMr. Richardson’s recent words, “open up previously inaccessible neighborhoods for voucher \ntenants.” \n112.  HUD nonetheless has suspended PHAs’ obligation to use payment standards \nbased on small area FMRs beginning on January 1, 2018. This action deprives voucher holders—\nwho, in most of the affected areas, are predominantly non-white and are concentrated in \npredominantly non-white areas—of equal opportunity to rent throughout those geographic areas \nbeginning on that date. That is to say, it deprives voucher holders like Ms. Moore and Ms. Carter \nof precisely the benefit that the Small Area FMR Rule was meant to confer upon them. \n113.  Not only has HUD made adoption of small area FMRs voluntary for PHAs, it is \nactively discouraging them from exercising their discretion to adopt small area FMRs. HUD is \nrefusing to provide PHAs with guidance and other support in adopting small area FMRs. It also \nhas stated that, in the absence of such guidance and support, PHAs are unprepared to use small \narea FMRs. And it has stated—contrary to the actual evidence—that PHAs that do wish to use \nsmall area FMRs face formidable administrative and other hurdles in doing so. All of this has the \neffect and purpose of not simply making use of small area FMRs “voluntary,” but putting a \nheavy thumb on the scale with respect to PHA decision-making.    \n114.  Most of the PHAs that the Small Area FMR Rule requires to use small area FMRs \nwill not do so under these circumstances. To the extent that some PHAs do, it will be because \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 35 of 47\n \norganizations like OCA divert their resources to advocating for the use of small area FMRs and \nhelping PHAs with implementing them in the absence of support from HUD. \n115.  Ms. Carter is directly harmed by HUD’s action and will continue to be harmed \nunless HUD’s action is enjoined.  \n116.  Ms. Carter is an African-American HCV voucher holder who currently lives in a \nfour-bedroom apartment at 47 Gilman Street in Hartford, Connecticut, with her five dependent \nchildren. She currently works as a home health care aide. The rent for Ms. Carter’s current \napartment is $1,375 per month. She pays that rent with assistance from a voucher administered \nby the Hartford Housing Authority. The FMR for a four-bedroom dwelling in the greater Harford \nregion is $1,620. Use of small area FMRs would reduce the FMR for Ms. Carter’s zip code to \n$1,540—still easily enough for her to afford her current apartment, should she want to remain \nthere.  \n117.  Ms. Carter has worked hard to find the best educational opportunities for her \nchildren. Taking advantage of an “Open Choice” regional school integration program, she has \nenrolled her three youngest children in school in Simsbury, Connecticut. Simsbury, a \npredominantly white town, has high-performing schools and very little poverty—only 3.4 \npercent. \n118.   To maintain her children’s enrollment in Simsbury, Ms. Carter can only live in \nSimsbury or in Hartford. She would like to move to Simsbury, both to be closer to her children’s \nschools and to provide a safer and healthier environment for her children. The zip code in \nHartford where Ms. Carter now lives has a 32.2 percent poverty rate. Every zip code in Simsbury \nhas much lower poverty. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 36 of 47\n \n119.  Ms. Carter has not been able to find suitable housing in Simsbury, in large part \nbecause of the way FMRs are calculated. As described above in paragraph 65, FMRs calculated \nbased on the entire greater Hartford area are inadequate for Simsbury, where Ms. Carter would \nlike to live. Under the small area FMR system, Ms. Carter’s voucher could be used for a 4-\nbedroom dwelling in Simsbury renting for up to $1,940, instead of the $1,620 that applies to the \nentire greater Harford area under the current system. That increase in the FMR would make it \npossible for Ms. Carter to rent the housing she wants in Simsbury. \n120.  HUD’s action thus is directly harming Ms. Carter by preventing her voucher from \nhaving the purchasing power necessary to secure housing in Simsbury. \n121.  Tiara Moore, too, is directly harmed by HUD’s action and will continue to be \nharmed unless HUD’s action is enjoined. \n122.  Ms. Moore is a 32-year-old African-American woman. She lives at 5841 W. Ohio \nStreet in Chicago with her 11-month-old daughter and her uncle. Ms. Moore works as a bus aide \nfor the Chicago Public Schools and has a monthly gross income of $1,500. \n123.  Ms. Moore currently pays $400 per month in rent, which is all she can afford \nbased on her income. She lives in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago. More than a third (33.8 \npercent) of households in her zip code are in poverty. Her neighborhood also has very high \ncrime. \n124.  On July 28, 2017, Ms. Moore was issued a housing voucher by the Chicago \nHousing Authority, which she would like to use to find better housing for herself and her \ndaughter. That voucher has a value of $1,207 for a two-bedroom apartment. She must use it to \nfind housing by December 17, 2017, or it will expire. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 37 of 47\n \n125.  Ms. Moore does not want to use her voucher to find a new place in the City of \nChicago. She wants to live instead in nearby DuPage County, where her mother lives. That area \nhas better schools and provides other opportunities not present in Ms. Moore’s current location. \n126.  When Ms. Moore looked for an apartment in DuPage County, however, she could \nnot find suitable housing for the value of her voucher.  \n127.  If the Small Area FMRs go into effect on January 1, 2018, Ms. Moore’s voucher \nwill have a substantially higher value in most zip codes in DuPage County, reflecting the fact \nthat (as Ms. Moore herself experienced) $1,207 is insufficient to rent a two-bedroom apartment \nthere. Under the Small Area FMR Rule, the fair market rent for a two-bedroom dwelling in most \nDuPage County zip codes would be more than $1,300; in some places, it would be as high as \n$1,770. If Ms. Moore and her landlord had assurance her voucher would soon be worth that \nmuch, she would be able to use her voucher to get housing in DuPage County. \n128.  With an approaching deadline to find housing and the apparent futility of finding \nappropriate housing in DuPage County for her current voucher amount, Ms. Moore has given up \nlooking in DuPage County. She has refocused her energies on finding an apartment in Chicago \nfor $1,200 or less before her voucher expires in December. \n129.  If HUD’s action were to be enjoined, Ms. Moore would have reason to seek an \nextension of her December 17 deadline from the Chicago Housing Authority. With small area \nFMRs going into effect at the beginning at the year, she would have a real chance at finding the \nhousing she desires in DuPage County. \n130.  HUD’s suspension of the small area FMR requirement has harmed and continues \nto harm the Open Communities Alliance. The OCA, a non-profit organization based in Hartford, \nConnecticut, seeks to remedy Connecticut’s residential racial segregation and the \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 38 of 47\n \ndisproportionate isolation from opportunities—in education, employment, housing, and \notherwise—that the state’s African-American and Latino families face as a result. \n131.  Much of OCA’s work pertains to enabling HCV families to move to areas of \nhigher opportunity, including the suburbs of Hartford, and otherwise addressing the \nconcentration of voucher households (which are predominantly non-white in the Hartford area) \nin high-poverty, segregated areas.  \n132.  For example, OCA works with the Connecticut Department of Housing and \nmobility counseling agencies to advise on the design and implementation of programs that help \nvoucher households move to areas of greater opportunity. It also researches the impact of \ngovernment policies (at the federal, state, and local level) on voucher concentration and the \navailability of affordable housing where vouchers can be used; develops best practices and \npolicy recommendations; advocates for those policies with agency and legislative staff; engages \nin education and outreach to build public support for those best practices; and holds related \nmeetings and trainings. \n133.  OCA also has projects to expand the supply of rental housing that low-income \nhouseholds can afford outside of racially segregated and resource-poor areas. For example, it is \ncurrently partnering with the National Housing Trust, a nonprofit developer, on a project to \nacquire market-rate rental properties in high-opportunity Hartford suburbs and convert them to \nproperties suitable for rent to, among other people, HCV voucher families. OCA also works with \nother private developers to encourage and help them to engage in similar conversions. This \nproject is directly imperiled by HUD’s decision not to require PHAs to implement small area \nFMRs. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 39 of 47\n \n134.  The financial viability of a rental property that intends to offer many units to HCV \nvoucher families depends on those vouchers paying for rent that is actually commensurate with \narea fair market rents. Without the use of small area FMRs, voucher rent levels do not reflect the \nlocal market rents and so the anticipated income from renting to voucher holder is much lower. \nThis makes it much harder for the OCA-National Housing Trust project and for other private \ndevelopers to obtain the financing necessary to fund these conversions and create badly needed \naffordable housing in more expensive parts of the greater Hartford area that provide safer, \nhealthier environments for voucher families. \n135.  OCA has devoted considerable resources to advocating for, and then helping \nprepare for, the rollout of small area FMRs in the Hartford area. In response to HUD’s action, \nOCA already has begun diverting its scarce resources away from previously planned projects to \nremedying the harm HUD is causing it, and it will have to continue doing so. \n136.  For example, in order to assist implementation of the rule and help voucher \nholders and those who work with them understand newly available options, OCA planned to \nproduce a Small Area Fair Market Rent web portal which would have included (a) an analysis of \nthe difference between small area FMRs and FMRs across the state, (b) an explanation of small \narea FMRs, (c) data on the current location of voucher holders, and (d) the results of a time \nconsuming rent study that highlighted the additional units that would become available under the \nnew rent calculation formula. Because HUD’s action makes it uncertain which (if any) of these \nadditional units actually will be available to voucher holders, OCA is now revising the content of \nthis portal and will instead produce an article, based on the same data, explaining to the public \nwhy HUD’s program freeze is detrimental and what steps should be taken to counteract the \neffects of HUD’s actions. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 40 of 47\n \n137.  OCA also has determined that, as a consequence of HUD’s actions, it must spend \nconsiderable time and resources on a sustained effort to convince each individual Hartford-area \nPHA to implement small area FMRs voluntarily. This project, which OCA already is preparing \nto start, would be entirely unnecessary if not for HUD’s unlawful decision to suspend its \nregulation requiring those PHAs to implement small area FMRs.  \n138.  This project may prove futile with respect to many or most of the PHAs in the \nHartford area. Even to the extent it succeeds, it will do no more than restore OCA to the position \nit would be in if not for HUD’s action, at the cost of considerable expenditure of OCA’s time and \nresources. \n139.  OCA already has taken or is about to take many specific actions as part of this \nproject to remedy the effects of HUD’s suspension of the rule. Such actions include: \n•  Writing advocacy pieces, assembling a web portal, and otherwise engaging in sustained \npublic education (including with the state of Connecticut and area PHAs) about why the \nuse of small area FMRs is beneficial; \n•  Holding conversations, collecting affidavits, and otherwise gathering information about \nthe effect of HUD’s action on voucher holders; and \n•  Notifying other affected parties, including area non-profits that serve many voucher \nholders, of HUD’s action and its likely effect, and convening discussions with them about \nadvocacy efforts and other next steps. OCA’s partners expected and relied upon small \narea FMRs going into effect on January 1, 2018, and OCA now must spend time ensuring \nthat they are aware that their expectations have been unsettled and know how to proceed \nunder these changed circumstances. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 41 of 47\n \n140.  OCA will have to take many similar actions in the next two years if HUD’s action \nis not enjoined. It will have to divert much of its time and other resources to projects that, in \nvarious ways, counteract the damage that HUD’s action is doing to its ability to further its \nmission. OCA would not have to divert its resources in this way but for HUD’s action. \n141.  HUD’s announcement that it will suspend the January 1, 2018 deadline is already \ncausing irreparable harm that worsens every day for each of these plaintiffs and others. Each day \nthat HUD refuses to take the preliminary steps necessary to implement the rule on time, such as \nproviding guidance and technical assistance to participating PHAs, makes implementation on \nschedule harder. Moreover, HUD’s announcement to PHAs that it will not hold them to their \nregulatory deadline is causing irreparable harm by inducing the PHAs not to prepare for \nimplementation. \n142.  HUD has demonstrated that, absent injunctive relief, it will not conform its \nconduct to its own regulatory requirements or require PHAs to do so the same.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Cause of Action \nAdministrative Procedure Act – Agency Action Without Observance of Procedure \nRequired by Law \n \n143.  The APA empowers this Court to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions \ntaken “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n144.  HUD has announced that it is suspending for two years the Small Area FMR \nRule’s requirement that affected PHAs begin using FMRs based on zip codes on January 1, \n2018. HUD has informed affected PHAs of this purported change and has posted this action on \nits website. \n145.  HUD’s action materially alters the terms of the Small Area FMR Rule. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 42 of 47\n \n146.  HUD lacks legal authority to alter the date on which the Small Area FMR Rule \nrequires affected PHAs to begin using FMRs based on zip codes without undertaking notice and \ncomment rulemaking. \n147.  Although HUD purports to delay the January 1, 2018 deadline separately for \nPHAs in each of the 23 affected areas pursuant to 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4)(iii), it did not \nproperly invoke that provision with respect to any of the affected areas by pointing to an area-\nspecific “event” that results in local housing conditions. Nor is that provision lawfully used to \naccomplish a wholesale suspension of the Small Area FMR Rule’s requirement without notice \nand comment. \n148.  By failing to engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking before suspending the \nrule, HUD failed to observe procedures required by law, in contravention of the APA. \nSecond Cause of Action \nAdministrative Procedure Act – Agency Action that Is Arbitrary, Capricious, or an \nAbuse of Discretion \n \n149.  The APA empowers this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n150.  Even if HUD had authority, given sufficiently compelling reasons, to excuse \nPHAs from the requirement that they begin using small area FMRs on January 1, 2018, its stated \nreasons for the delay are unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious. \n151.  HUD’s stated reasons for delaying the requirement’s effective date—the \npurported need for further study of the issue and inability of affected PHAs to adequately \nprepare—contradict findings that HUD made in promulgating the requirement. No new evidence \nsupports its changing course. HUD has pointed to the Interim Evaluation in conclusory fashion \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 43 of 47\n \nbut has not explained how that document supports its decision. Even if it had, such an \nexplanation would be arbitrary and capricious, since the Interim Evaluation demonstrates that \nsmall area FMRs work as intended and do not impose unmanageable administrative burden. \n152.  HUD does not claim that it has changed its view of the evidence that was before it \nwhen it promulgated the rule. Any such claim would be arbitrary and capricious in any event. \n153.  HUD has not provided a reasoned explanation for disregarding the facts and \ncircumstances that underlay the Small Area FMR Rule, including but not limited to its original \nfindings regarding the rule’s benefits for voucher holders and the necessity of making small area \nFMRs mandatory rather than voluntary in affected areas. \n154.  HUD does claim that its decision is based in part on comments submitted by \nindustry groups in a proceeding not devoted to this matter. It has not explained how those \ncomments support its decision, and any such explanation would be arbitrary and capricious. \nMoreover, HUD has not given others the opportunity to weigh in on the decision. \n155.  In delaying the requirement that PHAs implement small area FMRs, HUD relies \nin part on its own failure to adequately prepare PHAs. It is arbitrary and capricious for an agency \nto bootstrap its own failure to act in accordance with its legal obligations into a reason to \ncontinue not to act. \n156.  The final rule makes clear that mandatory rather than voluntary compliance by all \nPHAs in the covered areas is essential to the rule’s success. HUD has not explained why it now \nbelieves otherwise, and any such explanation would be arbitrary and capricious.  \n157.  The rationale underlying HUD’s delay of the rule is arbitrary, capricious, or an \nabuse of discretion, in contravention of the APA. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 44 of 47\n \nThird Cause of Action \nAdministrative Procedure Act –Action Contrary to Statute \n \n158.  The APA empowers this Court set aside an agency action that is “not in \naccordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n159.  In promulgating the Small Area FMR Rule, HUD brought its practices—and the \nPHAs’—into closer compliance with its relevant authorizing statutes, the Fair Housing Act of \n1968, as amended, and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended. Its \nattempt to suspend PHAs’ obligation under the FMR Rule violates both Acts. \n160.  In promulgating the Small Area FMR Rule, HUD found that fair market rents \ncalculated across large metropolitan areas limit HCV voucher families—who, in most of the \nareas affected by the rule, are predominantly non-white—to less wealthy neighborhoods that \ntend to be predominantly African-American and Latino. HUD found that its previous practices \nhad “not proven effective in addressing the problem of concentrated poverty and economic and \nracial segregation in neighborhoods.” 81 Fed. Reg. 80,567. Instead, the HCV voucher program \nwas improperly distributing federal funds in a way that perpetuated racial segregation and \nartificially limited the housing choices of families that are disproportionately African-American \nand Latino. HUD made no contrary finding in suspending the Small Area FMR Rule. \n161.  HUD has an affirmative obligation under the FHA to ensure that federal housing \nprograms are administered, and federal housing funds spent, in a manner that furthers racial \ndesegregation and combats the related problem of concentration of poverty where possible. 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 3608(d), (e)(5). In suspending its requirement that selected PHAs act in accordance \nwith the Small Area FMR rule, HUD is affirmatively choosing to distribute federal housing \nfunds in a manner that it has found perpetuates racial segregation and does not provide the \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 45 of 47\n \nopportunity to rent standard quality housing throughout the geographic areas in question. As \nHUD itself has stated: \n[I]n areas with a history of segregation, if a program participant has the ability to \ncreate opportunities outside of the segregated, low-income areas but declines to \ndo so . . . there could be a legitimate claim that HUD and its program participants \nwere acting to preclude a choice of neighborhoods to historically segregated \ngroups. \n \nAffirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, 80 Fed. Reg. 42,279 (Jul. 16, 2015). In suspending the \nrequirements of its already finalized Small Area FMR Rule, HUD is doing exactly that. It also is \nacting in a way that has a significant, adverse disparate impact on African Americans and \nLatinos without any sufficient justification for doing so. \n162.  Similarly, HUD specifically found in promulgating the Small Area FMR Rule that \nits former practices failed to result in rental rates that provided opportunities to rent “throughout \nthe geographic area,” contrary to the Housing and Community Development Act’s requirement \nthat the Section 8 program promote “economically mixed housing” rather than concentrated \npoverty. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a). It made no contrary finding in deciding to suspend PHAs’ \nregulatory obligations. \n163.  HUD’s suspension of the Small Area FMR Rule thus violates the Fair Housing \nAct of 1968, as amended, and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as \namended, in contravention of the APA.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court: \n(a)  enter a declaratory judgment that the decision of the U.S. Department of Housing \nand Urban Development to suspend the requirement that PHAs in 23 metropolitan areas begin \nusing payment standards based on small area FMRs on January 1, 2018 violates the \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page 46 of 47\n \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, because it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or contrary to law, and without observance of procedure required by law; \n(b)  issue temporary and permanent injunctions requiring the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to timely implement and enforce all the requirements of its \nSmall Area FMR Rule, including but not limited to the requirement that PHAs in the areas \nsubject to that rule begin using payment standards based on small area FMRs on January 1, \n2018; \n(c)  direct HUD to take all affirmative steps necessary to remedy the effects of the \nillegal conduct described herein and to prevent similar occurrences in the future; \n(d)  award plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs; and \n(e)  order such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable. \n \nDated: October 23, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n \n   \ns/Sasha Samberg-Champion___________ \nSasha Samberg-Champion (DC Bar No. \n981553) \nSara Pratt (DC bar admission pending) \nMichael G.

Howell \nBEN S. CARSON, SR., Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development, in his official \ncapacity, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \n \n  Section 8 of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 serves two statutory purposes: (1) “aiding  low-\nincome families in obtaining  a decent place to live” and (2) “promoting  economically  mixed \nhousing.”  42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a).  This case is not about what is good housing policy,  however.  \nThis case is about the rule of law—whether an agency effectively may suspend a duly \npromulgated  regulation without observing the procedures or identifying  relevant factual criteria \nthat the law requires to effect such a change.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (“HUD”), without notice and comment or particularized  evidentiary findings,  has \ndelayed almost entirely by two years implementation  of a rule requiring over 200 local Public \nHousing Authorities (“PHAs”) in 24 metropolitan  areas, which HUD selected based on fixed, \nobjective criteria, to calculate housing vouchers’ values based on local, rather than metropolitan-\nwide, prevailing  market rents.  The plaintiffs,  two voucher holders and a nonprofit organization \ndevoted to providing  housing opportunities  for low-income  people in Connecticut, move to \npreliminarily  enjoin HUD to implement  the rule on January 1, 2018, the rule’s effective date.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 2 of 47\nPls.’ Mot. Preliminary  Injunction,  ECF No. 15 (“Pls.’ Mot.”).  For reasons this Memorandum \nOpinion  explains in detail, the plaintiffs’  motion for a preliminary  injunction  is granted. \nI.  FACTS \nA.    Overview of the Housing Choice Voucher Program and Fair Market Rents \nCongress enacted the Housing Act of 1937 to assist state and local governments “to \nremedy unsafe and insanitary housing conditions  and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and \nsanitary dwellings  for families of low income.”  Pub. L. No. 75-412, § 1, 50 Stat. 888, 888 \n(1937) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437(a)).  The Housing and Community  Development Act of \n1974, enacted nearly 40 years later, amended the Housing Act to add Section 8, which authorized \nHUD to contract with PHAs to pay landlords rental subsidies on low-income tenants’ behalf.  \nPub. L. No. 93-383, § 8(a), 88 Stat. 633, 662 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a)).  The Housing \nand Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-181, § 207, 97 Stat. 1153, 1181 (codified \nas amended at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)), created the Housing Choice Voucher (“HCV”) program, \nwhich is HUD’s “major program for assisting very low-income  families, the elderly, and the \ndisabled to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing  in the private market.”  Housing Choice \nVouchers Fact Sheet, U.S. DEP’T HOUSING & URB. DEV., \nhttps://www.hud.gov/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8  (last visited Dec. 23, \n2017) (“HCV Fact Sheet”).1  HUD oversees the HCV program, directing funds to PHAs to \nadminister the program locally by issuing vouchers to qualified  individuals  and families,  who use \nthose vouchers to secure housing in the private rental market.  Id.  A voucher holder may use a \nvoucher toward any housing that meets the HCV program’s requirements, subject to a PHA’s \n                                              \n1   Federal Rule of Evidence 201 allows a court to take judicial notice of “a fact that is not subject to \nreasonable dispute because it . . . is generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or . . . can be \naccurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  FED. R. EVID. \n201(b).  Both of these conditions apply to a description of the HCV program found on HUD’s public website. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 3 of 47\napproval.  24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a)(2).  HCV participation  is limited  to low-income households, \nwhich typically  cannot afford to rent dwellings  for which the rent substantially  exceeds the HCV \nprogram payment standard.  See HCV Fact Sheet, supra; see, e.g., Pls.’ Mot., Attach. 9, Decl. of \nTiara Moore (“Moore Decl.”) ¶¶ 3, 7, ECF No. 15-9. \n  A voucher’s value is calculated largely on the basis of HUD’s determination  of the “fair-\nmarket rent” (“FMR”) for a dwelling  of a particular size and type (e.g., a two-bedroom home).  \n24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1).  An FMR represents the amount required “to rent standard quality \nhousing throughout  the geographic area in which rental housing units are in competition,” \nincluding  “the cost of utilities,  except telephone.”  Id. § 888.113(a).  HUD annually calculates \nand publishes  in the Federal Register FMRs for different types of units in each market area as \nwell as any proposed changes to FMR calculation procedures. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1)(B); see \nalso 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1).  PHAs, in turn, use FMR calculations to establish “payment \nstandard amounts” for each unit type.  24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1).   \nA PHA generally sets a payment standard “between 90 percent and 110 percent of the \npublished  FMR for that unit size.”  Id. § 982.503(b).  A voucher holder typically  pays a landlord \n30 percent of her or his adjusted monthly  income toward rent; the PHA pays the rent’s balance \ndirectly to the landlord,  so long as a dwelling’s  actual gross rent is at or below the relevant \npayment standard.  Id. § 982.1(a)(3).  If, however, a dwelling’s  actual rent exceeds the payment \nstandard, the voucher holder pays the balance.  Id.  A PHA may use the same payment standard \namount for all areas within the PHA’s jurisdiction,  or else “may establish a separate payment \nstandard amount for each designated part of the FMR area.”  Id. § 982.503(a)(3). \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 4 of 47\nB.     Problems with FMR Calculations in Metropolitan Areas \nFMRs often do not, in practice, accurately reflect rents actually charged in neighborhoods \nwithin a broad metropolitan  area, as “rents can vary widely within a metropolitan  area depending \nupon the size of the metropolitan  area and the neighborhood  in the metropolitan  area within \nwhich one resides.”  See Establishing a More Effective Fair Market Rent System; Using Small \nArea Fair Market Rents in the Housing Choice Voucher Program Instead of the Current 50th \nPercentile FMRs, 81 Fed. Reg. 80,567,  80,567 (Nov. 16, 2016) (“Final Rule”).  Consequently, \n“[t]he result of determining  rents on the basis of an entire metropolitan  area is that a voucher \nsubsidy . . . may be too low to cover market rent in a given neighborhood.”   Id.  FMRs calculated \non metropolitan-wide  bases may not enable voucher holders to afford rents in high-rent,  high-\nopportunity  neighborhoods,  consigning  them to low-opportunity  areas of concentrated poverty.  \nSee id.; Moore Decl. ¶¶ 5–7; Pls.’ Mot., Attach. 4, Decl. of Crystal Carter (“Carter Decl.”) ¶¶ 6–\n7, ECF No. 15-4.  Calculating  FMRs locally,  in contrast, makes rents in high-opportunity  areas \nmore affordable. \nPrior to 2000, HUD generally calculated FMRs to reflect the 40th percentile rent in a \ngiven metropolitan  area.  See 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(a)–(b).  In 2000, however, HUD published  a \nnew rule authorizing  PHAs in areas meeting specified criteria to calculate payment standards \nbased on FMRs reflecting the 50th percentile rent in a given area.  See Fair Market Rents: \nIncreased Fair Market Rents and Higher Payment Standards for Certain Areas, 65 Fed. Reg. \n58,870, 58,870 (Oct. 2, 2000).  This new policy  was “designed to achieve two fundamental \nprogram objectives: (1) Ensuring that low-income families are successful in finding  and leasing \ndecent and affordable housing; and (2) ensuring that low-income  families have access to a broad \nrange of housing  opportunities  throughout  a metropolitan  area.”  Id.  Consistent with these goals, \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 5 of 47\nthe 50th Percentile Rule authorized PHAs to calculate payment standards using a 50th percentile \nFMR under two circumstances: where “families  are having difficulty  using housing vouchers to \nfind and lease decent and affordable housing” and “a FMR increase is most needed to promote \nresidential choice, help families  move closer to areas of job growth, and deconcentrate poverty.”  \nId.  FMR calculation  would revert to a 40th percentile basis, however, in PHAs that experienced \nno or an insufficient  decrease in concentration of voucher holders after three years.  Id. at 58,871. \nHUD has concluded, based on recent research, that the 50th Percentile Rule is “not an \neffective tool” for “increasing HCV tenant moves from areas of low opportunity  to higher \nopportunity  areas.”  Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,570.  Rather, HUD has found that “much of \nthe benefit of increased FMRs simply  accrues to landlords  in lower rent submarket areas in the \nform of higher rents rather than creating an incentive for tenants to move to units in communities \nwith more and/or better opportunities.”  Id.  HUD also observed that a “large number of areas \nhave been disqualified  from the 50th percentile program for failure to show measurable \nreduction in voucher concentration of HCV tenants since 2001 when the program started, which \nstrongly suggests that the deconcentration objective is not being met.”  Id. \nC.     The Small Area FMR Demonstration Project \nIn the wake of the 50th Percentile Rule’s apparent failure, HUD considered alternative \nways to expand housing opportunities  for voucher holders.  See id.  Using census data collected \nthrough the American Community  Survey, HUD developed “Small  Area FMRs” (“SAFMRs”), \nwhich reflect fair-market rents in individual  ZIP codes, rather than in broad metropolitan  areas.  \nId.  HUD’s goal in applying  this new, more targeted methodology  was to “create more effective \nmeans for HCV tenants to move into higher opportunity,  lower poverty areas by providing  them \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 6 of 47\nwith subsidy adequate to make such areas accessible and to thereby reduce the number of \nvoucher families that reside in areas of high poverty concentration.”  Id.2 \n  HUD undertook a demonstration  project to test SAFMRs’ effectiveness.  Section 8 \nHousing Choice Voucher Program Demonstration Project of Small Area Fair Market Rents in \nCertain Metropolitan Areas for Fiscal Year 2011, 75 Fed. Reg. 27,808, 27,809 (May 18, 2010) \n(“Proposed Demonstration Project”).  Notably, HUD recognized, in announcing  the project, that \n“[t]he small area FMR demonstration  project will not be effective unless the PHAs that operate \nvoucher programs covering the vast majority of voucher tenants in a metropolitan  area agree to \nparticipate and abide by the small area rents.”  Id. at 27,811.  In a subsequent notice describing \nthe project in more detail, HUD explained that SAFMRs “represent a fundamentally  different \nway of operating the voucher program in metropolitan  areas,” and that the project would help \nHUD “to better understand the programmatic impacts of changing the way voucher payment \nstandards are set.”  Final Fair Market Rents for the Housing Choice Voucher Program for Small \nArea Fair Market Rent Demonstration Program Participants; Fiscal Year 2013, 77 Fed. Reg. \n69,651,  69,652 (Nov. 20, 2012) (“Demonstration Project”).  HUD identified two purposes that \nthe demonstration  project would serve: to (1) “evaluate [SAFMRs] in terms of effectiveness in \nmeeting the primary goal of improving  tenants’ housing choices in areas of opportunity  while \nalso assessing the impact on tenants in areas with SAFMRs below the metropolitan-wide  FMR” \n                                              \n2   Although SAFMRs are a recent innovation, HUD recognized the shortcomings of FMR schedules based on \nmetropolitan area-wide, rather than more localized, rent levels as early as 1977.  See COMPTROLLER GEN. OF THE \nU.S., CED-77-19, MAJOR CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN THE NEW LEASED-HOUSING PROGRAM 21 (1977) (“HUD’s \ndecision to prepare single FMR schedules for entire SMSAs [Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas] or for \ncounties grouped into areas totaling 250,000 population is questionable.  This approach ignores important \ndistinctions between metropolitan central cities and suburban areas as well as among suburban areas within SMSAs, \nand it does not adequately consider the economic and demographic differences among non-SMSA counties.  For \nexample, the San Francisco-Oakland, California, SMSA had identical FMRs for the counties of Alameda, Contra \nCosta, Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo.  HUD field office officials said that each of these counties’ actual \nmarket rents could vary by 30 to 40 percent.”). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 7 of 47\nand (2) “understand and evaluate the administrative  and budget impacts of converting and \noperating the tenant-based voucher program using SAFMRs.”  Id.  In selecting pilot PHAs to \nparticipate in the demonstration project, HUD used seven fixed, objective criteria to define an \ninitial  pool of eligible  PHAs, then “randomly  selected” pilot areas “from stratified sets of eligible \nPHAs.”  Id.  HUD ultimately selected five pilot  PHAs from this pool: the (1) Chattanooga \n(Tenn.) Housing Authority,  (2) Housing Authority of the City of Laredo (Tex.), (3) Housing \nAuthority of the City of Long Beach (Cal.), (4) Housing Authority of the County of Cook (Ill.), \nand (5) Town of Mamaroneck (N.Y.) Public Housing Agency.  Id.  HUD also included all \nDallas, Texas, metropolitan  area PHAs, which since 2010 had implemented  SAFMRs pursuant \nto a settlement agreement, in the demonstration project.

Reg. 46,958,  46,962 (Aug. 4, 2010). \nD.     The SAFMR Rule \nBefore the demonstration project’s completion,  HUD published advance notice of \nproposed rulemaking  announcing  the agency’s intent to require several other metropolitan  areas \nmeeting certain criteria to implement  SAFMRs.  See Establishing a More Effective Fair Market \nRent (FMR) System; Using Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs) in Housing Choice \nVoucher Program Instead of the Current 50th Percentile FMRs; Advanced Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking, 80 Fed. Reg. 31,332 (June 2, 2015).  HUD cited in this advance notice “research \nand experience with the SAFMR demonstration” indicating  “that amending its current FMR \nregulation  to enable adoption of the SAFMR methodology  could provide HCV tenants greater \naccess to higher opportunity,  lower poverty neighborhoods.”   Id. at 31,333.  As part of the \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 8 of 47\nadvance notice, HUD also announced that the new Rule “would eliminate  the use of 50th \npercentile FMRs as a means to reduce HCV tenant concentration.”  Id.   \nOne year later, on June 16, 2016, HUD published  a notice of the proposed new rule.  See \nEstablishing a More Effective Fair Market Rent System; Using Small Area Fair Market Rents in \nHousing Choice Voucher Program Instead of the Current 50th Percentile FMRs, 81 Fed. Reg. \n39,218 (June 16, 2016) (“NPRM”).  In doing so, HUD acknowledged that “[i]n order for Small \nArea FMRs to work in expanding choice for voucher holders within designated metropolitan \nareas, all PHAs operating in the FMR area would be required to use Small Area FMRs.”  Id. at \n39,224.  The proposed rule addressed concerns raised in response to the advance notice and \nsought additional  comments on specific issues, including  policies HUD should adopt to “mitigate \nthe impact of significant  and abrupt decreases in the FMRs for certain ZIP code areas on families \n. . . in those impacted areas” and whether “this policy change would be particularly  burdensome” \nto any “specific groups within  the general population  of voucher holders.”  Id. at 39,225. \nHUD published  a final rule on November 16, 2016.  Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. 80,567.  \nCalculating  payment standards based on SAFMRs, HUD said, would “provid[e] . . . a subsidy \nadequate to make such [high-opportunity,  low-poverty] areas accessible and, consequently,  help \nreduce the number of voucher families that reside in areas of high poverty concentration.”  Id. at \n80,567.  “ZIP codes,” HUD reasoned, “are small enough to reflect neighborhood  differences and \nprovide an easier method of comparing rents within one ZIP code to another ZIP code area \nwithin a metropolitan  area.”  Id. at 80,568.  The rule contained several provisions  to address \nconcerns about SAFMRs’ potential adverse impacts on voucher holders in low-rent ZIP codes.  \nId. at 80,572.  Particularly relevant here, the rule authorized HUD to “suspend a Small Area \nFMR designation  for a metropolitan  area . . . where HUD determines such action is warranted \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 9 of 47\nbased on a documented finding  of adverse rental housing market conditions  that will be set out \nby notice,” id. at 80,569,  enumerating three circumstances that could warrant a designation’s \nsuspension or PHA’s exemption from the SAFMR mandate, 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).

Deputy Assistant Sec’y for Pol’y Dev. & Research (“HUD Decl.”) ¶ 5, ECF No. 24-\n1.  In so doing,  HUD required all PHAs within affected metropolitan  areas to implement \nSAFMRs.  These metropolitan  areas included the Dallas, Texas area, SAFMR Area Designations, \n81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679,  in which PHAs, pursuant to the earlier-referenced settlement agreement, \nalready had implemented  SAFMRs, see NPRM, 81 Fed. Reg. at 39,221. \nE.     The Interim Report’s Preliminary Findings \nAfter HUD announced the Rule’s promulgation,  but before the Rule was set to go into \neffect, HUD received preliminary  findings  from the demonstration  project in the form of an \nInterim Report titled Small Area Fair Market Rent Demonstration Evaluation.  Defs.’ Opp’n, Ex. \n1 (“Interim Report”), ECF No. 24-4.  This report contained good news on SAFMRs efficacy to \nachieve Section 8’s statutory goals, with mixed results for some demonstration  project PHAs. \nSpecifically,  the Interim Report found that SAFMRs in the pilot PHAs make “the \navailability  of units [] much more evenly distributed across different types of neighborhoods, \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 10 of 47\nleading to increased availability  in high-rent ZIP Codes and reduced availability  in low-rent ZIP \nCodes.”  Interim Report at vii; see also id. at viii (“Because SAFMRs increase access to high-\nrent ZIP Codes and reduce access to low-rent ZIP Codes, we found not unexpectedly that the \ntransition to SAFMRs led to an increase in units potentially  available to HCV holders in higher-\nopportunity  areas under SAFMRs compared with FMRs and fewer units in lower opportunity \nareas.”).  As a result, “[f]ollowing  the implementation  of SAFMRs, HCV holders in the \ndemonstration  sites are slightly  more likely  to live in high-rent ZIP Codes than they were prior to \nthe demonstration,”  while no such change was observed in “comparison PHAs.”  Id. at viii.  \nFurther, “[t]he slight changes in rents among the SAFMR PHAs also translate into slight changes \nin opportunity.”   Id.; see also id. at ix (finding  that “[a]cross all evaluation PHAs . . . changes in \nrents are also reflected in changes in access to opportunity.”).   Moreover, Housing Assistance \nPayment (“HAP”) costs, which “are the subsidy costs that PHAs incur on behalf of HCV holders \nfor rent and utilities,”  “declined in real terms per unit between 2010 and 2015 in SAFMR \nPHAs,” while “[r]ents paid to landlords remained nearly flat in real terms between 2010 and \n2015 but varied by rent category.”  Id. at x.  The report states, “[i]n summary, it appears that \nSmall Area Fair Market Rents are working as intended—increasing  access to units in higher-\nopportunity  areas and decreasing access in lower-opportunity  areas.”  Id. at 61. \nAt the same time, the Interim Report troublingly  found that “the gain in units with rents \nbelow the applicable  FMR in high-rent ZIP Codes does not offset the decrease in the number of \nunits in the low-rent and moderate-rent ZIP Codes, resulting in a net loss of units potentially \navailable to HCV holders overall.”  Id. at vii.  The net effect of SAFMR implementation  across \nthe pilot PHAs, the Interim Report found, was “a loss of over 22,000 units (3.4 percent) that \nmight otherwise be affordable to HCV holders.”  Id.  In addition,  the Interim Report noted that \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 11 of 47\naverage payment standard amounts declined by about 11 percent in inflation-adjusted  terms in \npilot PHAs, resulting in average rent burden increases for HCV voucher holders of about 16 \npercent overall and 22 percent in low-income ZIP codes.  Id. at ix–x.  In contrast, payment \nstandard amounts relying on metropolitan  area-wide FMRs declined by only about 2 percent, \nresulting in an average rent burden increase of 9 percent.  Id.  \nThe Interim Report’s findings  related only to Phase 1 of the demonstration  project.  Id. at \nxi.  In 2018, HUD will receive a Final Report combining  and synthesizing  data collected in \nPhases 1 and 2, the latter of which will (1) update the Interim Report’s empirical analyses with \nnew housing data, and (2) use qualitative  interviews of tenants and landlords  to determine how \nSAFMRs have affected or could affect housing decisions.  Id. at xi, 98. \nF.     HUD’s Two-Year Delay of the SAFMR Rule \nOn August 10, 2017, HUD issued a memorandum delaying  SAFMR designations  for 23 \nof the 24 metropolitan  areas subject to the Rule (excluding  Dallas), requiring PHAs in affected \nareas to implement  the Rule in 2020 rather than in 2018.  Defs.’ Opp’n, Ex. 2, Suspension of \nSmall Area Fair Market Rent (FMR) Designations (“Suspension Mem.”) at 2, ECF No. 24-5.  \nThe Suspension Memo expressly noted, however, that “any PHA operating in the covered \nmetropolitan  areas” could still “voluntarily  implement[]  the use of Small Area FMRs prior to . . . \n2019,” and that PHAs in the Dallas metropolitan  area would continue to implement  SAFMRs \npursuant to the settlement agreement.  Id. at 1, 3.  On August 11, 2017, HUD sent over 200 \naffected PHAs a letter informing  those PHAs that their metropolitan  areas’ mandatory SAFMR \ndesignations  were suspended until 2020.

Specifically,  the Suspension Memo stated that “[o]ne of the findings  of \nconcern from the interim report is that the gain in units with rents below the applicable FMR in \nhigh-rent ZIP codes did not offset the decrease in the number of units in the low-rent and \nmoderate-rent ZIP codes.”  Id.  The Suspension Memo acknowledged that, by contrast to the \noperation of SAFMRs in the pilot PHAs, the Rule capped any SAFMR decrease to 10 percent \nper year, but concluded that this provision  “may only slow the pace of the loss of units, as \nopposed to preventing the overall decline in the number of units available to HCV families in the \nmetropolitan  area.”  Id. at 5–6.  The Suspension Memo also recounted the Interim Report’s \nfindings  that SAFMRs have potential to increase voucher holders’ rent burdens.  Id. at 6.   The \nSuspension Memo again acknowledged that, by contrast to the operation of SAFMRs in the pilot \nPHAs, the Rule allows PHAs to hold nonmoving  families harmless from payment standard \namount decreases, but noted that “there is no protection for families that must move to a new unit \nor for applicant families off the waiting list who are trying to lease a unit on the program for the \nfirst time.”  Id. at 7. \nThe Suspension Memo identified  two other concerns with respect to implementing  the \nRule.  The first concern was that “several PHA industry groups have [expressed] concerns about \nthe Small Area FMR final rule and the timeline  for implementation”  in response to a separate \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 13 of 47\nFederal Register notice on reducing regulatory burdens.  Id. (citing Reducing Regulatory Burden; \nEnforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda Under Executive Order 13777, 82 Fed. Reg. 22,344 \n(May 15, 2017)).  The Suspension Memo recognized that “HUD has not yet completed its \nanalysis of these public comments,” but asserted that “[t]emporarily  suspending the Small Area \nFMR designation  until  FY 2020 will allow HUD to be informed by the public comments on \nreducing regulatory burden for the HCV program as well as the Final Report . . . before the use \nof Small Area FMRs is required.”  Id.  The second concern was that developing  and issuing \n“guidance and planning  to provide technical assistance to assist PHAs that must implement” \nSAFMRs “without  fully understanding  and incorporating  the lessons learned from the \nDemonstration will result in a product that does not adequately assist those PHAs that must make \nthis [] transition.”  Id. at 8.  Relatedly, HUD noted that “[i]mplementing  comprehensive guidance \nthat may become quickly  outdated as the result of related regulatory burden reduction and reform \nefforts is likewise problematic.”  Id. \nG.     The Plaintiffs \nThe plaintiffs  are two African-American women living  in metropolitan  areas the Rule \nwould affect, as well as Open Communities  Alliance (“OCA”), a nonprofit  organization  devoted \nto providing  social and economic opportunities  for low-income people.

Cir. \n2017) (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)). \n“A party seeking a preliminary  injunction  must make a ‘clear showing that four factors, \ntaken together, warrant relief: likely  success on the merits, likely  irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary  relief, a balance of the equities in its favor, and accord with the public interest.’”  \nLeague of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting  Pursuing \nAm.’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2016)).  Whether a plaintiff  must show \neach of the four factors independently,  or else may make a sufficiently  “strong showing on one \nfactor [to] make up for a weaker showing on another,” remains an open question in the D.C. \nCircuit.  Id. at 7 (quoting Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).4 \nIII.  DISCUSSION \n                                              \n4   The Supreme Court, in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008), has \nsuggested that a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must show each factor separately.  Winter referred to the \nfour factors conjunctively, holding that such a plaintiff “must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that \nhe is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  555 U.S. at 20.  Winter also rejected the contention that \n“when a plaintiff demonstrates a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits, a preliminary injunction may be \nentered based only on a ‘possibility’ of irreparable harm,” holding that “plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief [must] \ndemonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.”  Id. at 21–22 (emphasis in original).  \nThe D.C. Circuit repeatedly has observed that “the so-called ‘sliding-scale’ approach to weighing the four \npreliminary injunction factors” may no longer be viable post-Winter, but has never resolved this question one way or \nthe other.  League of Women Voters, 883 F.3d at 7; see also Pursuing Am.’s Greatness, 831 F.3d at 505 n.1 (“We \nneed not resolve here any tension in the case law regarding the showing required on the merits for a preliminary \ninjunction.”); Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“[I]t remains an open question whether the \n‘likelihood of success’ factor is ‘an independent, free-standing requirement,’ or whether, in cases where the other \nthree factors strongly favor issuing an injunction, a plaintiff need only raise a ‘serious legal question’ on the merits. . \n. . But we have no need to resolve this question here because the remaining factors do not, in any event, weigh in \npetitioners’ favor.”); Sherley, 644 F.3d at 392–93 (“[W]e read Winter at least to suggest if not to hold that a \nlikelihood of success is an independent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary injunction.” (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 17 of 47\nThe plaintiffs  seek a preliminary  injunction  requiring  HUD to implement  the Rule on its \neffective date of January 1, 2018.  Pls.’ Mot.  Their motion challenges the lawfulness of HUD’s \ntwo-year delay of the Rule’s implementation in ways relating to claims in the complaint.5  First, \nthe plaintiffs  argue that HUD failed to adhere to the requirements of notice and comment \nprocedure in delaying the Rule’s implementation.   Pls.’ Mem. at 22–27; see Compl. ¶ 143–48.  \nThe defendants acknowledge HUD delayed the Rule’s implementation  without notice or \ncomment, but argue that HUD had authority under a promulgated  regulation,  24 C.F.R. § \n888.113(c)(4), to suspend SAFMR designations  and exempt PHAs without resort to notice and \ncomment, Defs.’ Opp’n at 21–27.  The plaintiffs  dispute that this regulation conferred such \nauthority upon HUD.  Pls.’ Mem. at 24–27.  Second, the plaintiffs  argue that HUD’s delay of the \nRule’s implementation  was arbitrary and capricious because HUD failed to provide an adequate \nexplanation  for the delay.  Id. at 28–34; see Compl. ¶¶ 149–57.  The plaintiffs  contend that the \nRule’s delayed implementation  will irreparably harm them, and that both the balance of equities \nand consideration  of the public  interest weigh in favor of issuing a preliminary  injunction.   Pls.’ \nMem. at 34–43.  Here, for reasons explained in further detail below, the plaintiffs  have carried \ntheir burdens of demonstrating all four factors, and so merit a preliminary  injunction  under either \nthe “independent  factors” or “sliding  scale” approach.   \nA.     Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe plaintiffs’  (1) notice and comment and (2) arbitrary and capricious claims boil down \nto a common issue—whether HUD identified  adverse rental housing market conditions  local to \nthe particular PHAs as to which HUD delayed the Rule’s implementation.   For reasons explained \n                                              \n5   The complaint also raises a third claim, asserting that HUD acted contrary to statute in delaying the Rule’s \nimplementation by distributing housing funds in a manner that perpetuates racial segregation and does not provide \nopportunity to rent quality housing throughout a metropolitan area.  Compl. ¶¶ 158–163.  The plaintiffs’ motion \ndoes not address this argument, and the defendants do not respond to it.  See generally Pls.’ Mot.; Defs.’ Opp’n. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 18 of 47\nbelow, HUD did not.  HUD’s failure to connect the Rule’s delayed implementation  in specific \nPHAs by reference to local conditions  means 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4) gave the agency no \nauthority to act without notice and comment, and also that HUD’s decision-making  was arbitrary \nand capricious.  The plaintiffs  thus have shown likely  success on their claims’ merits. \n1.     HUD Lacked Authority to Delay the Rule’s Implementation. \n  The plaintiffs  argue that they likely  will succeed on the merits of their claim that HUD’s \ndelay of the Rule is procedurally defective because HUD did not observe the requirements of \nnotice and comment.  Pls.’ Mem. at 22–27.  HUD, invoking a provision  of the Rule, argues \nunsuccessfully that the Secretary has broad authority to delay the Rule’s implementation \nwholesale whenever the Secretary determines he has reason to do so.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 21–27; \nHr’g Tr. (Dec. 19, 2017) at 30.6  The plaintiffs,  relying on the same Rule provision,  argue that \nthe Secretary’s authority is more circumscribed, and does not reach HUD’s action here.  Hr’g Tr. \nat 7.  “To choose between those competing [constructions], we look to the context in which the \nwords appear.”  McDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2368 (2016).  The Court concludes \nthat although HUD may suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA within such a \ndesignated area under circumstances in which SAFMRs may adversely impact the area or PHA’s \nrental housing unit supply,  HUD has made no such area-specific showing with respect to the 23 \nmetropolitan  areas as to which the agency delayed the Rule’s implementation.   As such, the \nplaintiffs  have demonstrated likely success on the merits on their notice and comment claim.7 \n                                              \n6   All citations to the December 19, 2017 hearing transcript cite to a rough draft of the transcript.  A final \ndraft of the transcript is forthcoming and will be made available on this case’s docket.  Discrepancies between the \nrough and final transcript drafts regarding page numbers may exist. \n7   The defendants’ argument that HUD soon will rescind the Rule through notice and comment and thus moot \nthe plaintiffs’ notice and comment claim, see Defs.’ Opp’n at 31, only underscores that HUD has not yet invoked \nnotice and comment, and thus, that the plaintiffs’ claim is not moot.  The issue of whether HUD’s planned action \nwould moot the plaintiffs’ claim is not yet ripe for review. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 19 of 47\n  The APA generally requires a federal agency engaged in informal rulemaking  to engage \nin notice and comment procedures.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–(c).  “[A]n agency issuing  a \nlegislative  rule is itself bound by the rule until that rule is amended or revoked and may not alter \nsuch a rule without notice and comment.  Clean Air Council v. Pruitt, 862 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).  “[A]n order delaying [a] rule’s \neffective date” is “tantamount to amending or revoking a rule.”  Id. at 6; see also Nat. Res.

Cir. 1983) (“[S]uspension \nor delayed implementation  of a final regulation  normally  constitutes substantive rulemaking \nunder APA § 553.”); Council of S. Mountains, Inc. v.

Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. U.S. EPA, 683 F.2d \n752, 762 (3d Cir. 1982) (“If the effective date were not part of an agency statement such that \nmaterial alterations in that date would be subject to the rulemaking  provisions  of the APA, . . . an \nagency could guide a future rule through the rulemaking  process, promulgate  a final rule, and \nthen effectively repeal it, simply by indefinitely  postponing  its operative date.” (internal \nquotation marks omitted)). \n  The Rule, which requires PHAs administering  the HCV program in select metropolitan \nareas to use, as of January 1, 2018, SAFMRs, unquestionably  is a substantive regulation delay of \nwhich ordinarily  would require notice and comment.  HUD, however, did not delay the Rule’s \nimplementation  through notice and comment.  Thus, HUD’s action was lawful only if another \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 20 of 47\nsource of authority empowered HUD to delay the Rule’s implementation  without notice or \ncomment.  HUD asserts that 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c) conferred such authority.  HUD is wrong. \na)   Section 888.113(c)(4)’s Meaning \n  HUD’s failure to use notice and comment means that the agency’s authority to delay the \nRule’s implementation  must flow, if at all, from § 888.113(c)(4).  Section 888.113(c)(4) allows \nHUD to temporarily suspend a region’s SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA from use of \nSAFMRs under specified circumstances.  The regulation provides, in relevant part: \nHUD may suspend a Small  Area FMR designation  from a metropolitan  area, or \nmay temporarily  exempt a PHA in a Small Area FMR metropolitan  area from use \nof the Small Area FMRs, when HUD by notice makes a documented determination \nthat such action is warranted.  Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension \nof Small Area FMRs are:  \n     \n(i)  A Presidentially declared disaster area that results in the loss of a substantial \nnumber of housing units;  \n \n(ii)  A sudden influx of displaced households needing permanent housing; or \n \n(iii)  Other events as determined by the Secretary.  \n24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).   \n  Section 888.133(c)(4)’s plain language makes clear that HUD may suspend an SAFMR \ndesignation or exempt a PHA only upon one of three enumerated actions’ occurrence.  Further, \nunder the canon of ejusdem generis, which “limits  general terms which follow specific ones to \nmatters similar to those specified,” Wallaesa v. FAA, 824 F.3d 1071, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 2016) \n(quoting  Gooch v. United States, 297 U.S. 124, 128 (1936)), the third action must be construed to \nreach only events “of the same class as those listed” in the preceding exemplar actions, DeNaples \nv. Office of Comptroller of Currency, 706 F.3d 481, 490 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting BLACK’S \nLAW DICTIONARY 594 (9th ed. 2009)).  See also Yates v. United States, 135 S.

State \nDep’t of Soc. & Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 384 (2003) \n(alterations omitted)));  Hall St. Assocs., LLC v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586 (2008) (“Under \nth[e] rule [of ejusdem generis], when a statute sets out a series of specific items ending with a \ngeneral term, that general term is confined to covering subjects comparable to the specifics it \nfollows.”); Cole v.

Cir. 1997) (“[T]he rule of \nejusdem generis . . . limits general terms which follow specific ones to matters similar  to those \nspecified.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nSection 888.113(c)(4)’s first two enumerated actions each involve changes to local rental \nhousing market conditions  that drive rents up, to voucher holders’ detriment.  The over-arching \nrationale for HUD’s suspension authority that the Rule’s preamble sets out confirms the \nenumerated examples’ focus on local rental housing conditions.   There, the Rule states that an \nSAFMR designation’s suspension requires “a documented finding  of adverse rental housing \nmarket conditions.”   Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,569.  “[L]anguage in the preamble of a \nregulation,”  though “not controlling  over the language of the regulation  itself . . . is evidence of \nan agency’s contemporaneous understanding of its proposed rules.”  Wyo. Outdoor Council v. \nU.S. Forest Serv., 165 F.3d 43, 53 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  Were the third action—“Other events as \ndetermined by the Secretary”—intended to allow the Secretary unfettered discretion to suspend \nan SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA for any reason, the two other enumerated examples \nwould be mere surplusage.  As the Supreme Court has stressed in applying  the canon of ejusdem \ngeneris, if the disputed phrase was intended to have such a broad meaning “it is hard to see why” \nthe examples needed to be included at all.  Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 142 (2008); see \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 22 of 47\nalso CSX Transp., Inc. v. Ala. Dep’t of Revenue, 562 U.S. 277, 295 (2011) (“We typically \nuse ejusdem generis to ensure that a general word will not render specific words meaningless.”).   \nThe Supreme Court’s reasoning in Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233 (2010), is instructive. \nThe Attorney General claimed broad, unreviewable discretion, under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B), \nto act on a motion to reopen alien removal proceedings, but the Court held otherwise.  558 U.S. \nat 237.  The Court examined the provision’s  two clauses insulating  from judicial  review, in \nclause (i), certain discretionary administrative  judgments authorized by specific statutes, and, in \nclause (ii), “any other decision . . . the authority for which is specified under this subchapter.”  \nId. at 246.  Citing  the “lead line” introducing  both clauses, the “proximity  of clauses (i) and (ii) \nand the words linking  them—‘any other decision,’” the Supreme Court reasoned that “[t]he \nclause (i) enumeration . . . is instructive in determining  the meaning of the clause (ii) catchall,” \nultimately  reasoning “that Congress had in mind decisions of the same genre,” namely,  “that \nCongress barred court review of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the \nAttorney General’s discretionary authority in the statute.”  Id. at 24647. Consequently,  the Court \nheld, the judicial  review bar encompassed only administrative  decisions made discretionary by \nstatute, not by regulation.   Id. at 253–54.  As with Kucana, the “lead line” in § 888.113(c)(4) is \n“Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs are . . . ,” which places \nall three enumerated actions that follow within the category of actions that justify an SAFMR \nsuspension or PHA exemption.  These actions’ proximity  to the lead line and to one another, as \nwell as the “[o]ther events” term linking  the actions, shows that § 888.113(c)(4),  “[r]ead \nharminously,”  lets HUD suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA only for reasons “of \nthe same genre” as those in the first two enumerated actions.  Kucana, 558 at 246–47. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 23 of 47\nBegay likewise is clarifying.   The Armed Career Criminal  Act imposes a sentencing \nenhancement on a defendant who violates 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and has three prior convictions \n“for a violent  felony,” defined in part to mean a felony that “is burglary,  arson, or extortion, \ninvolves  use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential  risk of \nphysical injury to another.”  18 U.S.C. § 922(e)(2)(B)(ii).  “[T]he provision’s  listed examples,” \nBegay reasoned, “illustrate  the kinds of crimes that fall within the statute’s scope” and “indicates \nthat the statute covers only similar crimes, rather than every crime that presents a serious \npotential risk of physical injury  to another.”  553 U.S. at 142 (internal quotation  marks omitted).  \nA Congress intending  “the statute to be all encompassing” Begay said, likely would not “have \nneeded to include the examples at all,” as the statute “would cover all crimes that present a \nserious potential risk of physical injury” absent the examples.  Id. (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  “These considerations  taken together,” Begay concluded, “convince us that, to give \neffect to every clause and word of this statute, we should read the examples as limiting  the \ncrimes that [the statute] covers to crimes that are roughly  similar,  in kind as well as in degree of \nrisk posed, to the examples themselves.”  Id. at 143 (alterations and internal quotation  marks \nomitted).  Here, as in Begay, § 888.113(c)(4)’s “listed examples” limit  the third action’s scope to \nactions “that are roughly  similar” to the first two actions.  Id. at 142–43.  The third action thus is \nbest construed to encompass only events that involve adverse rental housing market conditions.8  \nFinally,  the Rule’s localist phrasing and the interrelation  of the Rule’s provisions,  viewed \nholistically,  show that HUD may justify a particular SAFMR designation’s  suspension or PHA’s \nexemption only through a localized  determination  that conditions  in a particular affected area or \n                                              \n8   Johnson v. United States abrogated Begay by voiding the phrase “otherwise involves conduct that presents \na serious potential risk of physical injury to another,” known as § 922(e)(2)(B)(ii)’s “residual clause,” for vagueness.  \n135 S. Ct. 2551, 2563 (2015).  Begay nonetheless persuasively illustrates the ejusdem generis canon’s application. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 24 of 47\nPHA warrant such action.  Section 888.113(c)(4)’s first sentence requires HUD to designate \nSAFMR areas each year, which “designations  will be permanent.”  24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).  \nElsewhere, the Rule identifies  (1) five fixed, objective “criteria used to determine those \nmetropolitan  areas” to receive designations  and (2) precise, dynamic “selection values” for each \ncriterion.  Id. § 888.113(c)(1) (identifying  selection criteria); SAFMR Area Designations, 81 Fed. \nReg. at 80,679 (identifying  selection values); see also infra Part III.A.2.  Section 888.113(c)(4)’s \nsecond sentence allows HUD to suspend “a Small Area FMR designation  from a metropolitan \narea” and to exempt “a PHA in a Small Area FMR metropolitan  area” upon “a documented \ndetermination that such action is warranted.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Notably, this sentence does \nnot authorize HUD to suspend, in wholesale fashion, “all SAFMR designations” or exempt “all \naffected PHAs” in “all metropolitan  areas.”  This language, rather, focuses HUD’s inquiry  on \nindividualized  reasons for suspending a particular designation or exempting a particular PHA. \nThe third sentence cabins HUD’s discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt \na PHA, enumerating three “[a]ctions” that “may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area \nFMRs.”  Id.9  The first two actions—“A Presidentially  declared disaster area that results in the \nloss of a substantial number of housing  units” and “A sudden influx  of displaced households \nneeding permanent housing,” id. § 888.113(c)(4)(i)–(ii)—do  not merely address free-floating \npolicy concerns.  Each action, by nature, affects discrete, particular geographic areas.  Thus, § \n888.113(c)(4), read as a whole and in concert with surrounding  provisions,  requires HUD to \njustify a particular SAFMR designation’s  suspension or PHA’s exemption by reference to \nspecific rental housing  market conditions  local to the affected area.  HUD may not, in other \n                                              \n9   Notably, again, this sentence references “a suspension of [SA]FMRs.”  24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4) \n(emphasis added). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 25 of 47\nwords, suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA by citing abstract policy concerns or \nconclusions  extrapolated from data with no or only tenuous relation to the specific affected PHA. \n  The plaintiffs  and defendants read § 888.113(c)(4) differently.  The plaintiffs  understand \nHUD’s authority to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA more narrowly, arguing \nthat the term “events” reaches only “unexpected events resulting in a sudden change in localized \nrental market conditions.”   Pls.’ Mem. at 26.  “Whether market conditions  have ‘negative \nimpacts on voucher families,’”  the plaintiffs  argue, “has nothing to do with whether any area \nmeets regulatory criteria for small area designation or whether its FMRs remain reliable.”  Pls.’ \nReply Mem. Supp. Mot. (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 9, ECF No. 25.  Section 888.113(c)(4), however, by \nits plain terms authorizes HUD to suspend an SAFMR designation  or exempt a PHA even when \nthe conditions  that triggered the SAFMR’s application  to that metropolitan  area or PHA still \napply, so long as a qualifying  event occurs.  HUD could have written § 888.113(c)(4) in terms \nthat would allow SAFMR suspensions or PHA exemptions only when a particular metropolitan \narea or PHA no longer satisfied the criteria for SAFMR designation  in the first place, but HUD \ndid not so limit  the suspension/exemption  authority that the regulation  conferred.  Cf. Wallaesa, \n824 F.3d at 1083 (“If Congress had intended that narrow meaning, it knew how to say so.”).  \nMoreover, to construe the term “events” to reach only adverse rental housing market condition \nchanges that are “sudden” and “unexpected” has no basis in the regulatory text, is neither \ncompelled by nor necessary to give effect to the two preceding actions, and would leave HUD \npowerless to suspend the Rule’s impact under circumstances that, though foreseen or gradual, \nnegatively impact voucher holders.  Construing  “events” to reach any “adverse rental housing \nmarket conditions,”  in contrast, finds support in the preambulatory  text, gives effect to the two \npreceding exemplar actions, and leaves HUD flexibility  to suspend an SAFMR designation  or \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 26 of 47\nexempt a particular PHA under circumstances that, although either foreseen or gradual, \nnonetheless negatively impact voucher holders. \nThe defendants, in turn, contend that § 888.113(c)(4) vests HUD with virtually  boundless \nauthority to suspend SAFMR designations  or exempt PHAs.  The defendants specifically  argue \nthat (1) the three enumerated actions merely illustrate,  rather than exhaust, the sort of actions that \ntrigger HUD’s authority to suspend an SAFMR designation  or exempt a PHA, and (2) the third \naction gives HUD unreviewable discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA \nfor essentially any reason.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 21–27.  These arguments do not pass muster. \nFirst, the defendants argue that § 888.113(c)(4) does not provide an exclusive list of \nactions that may justify suspending an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA, but merely \nnonexclusive  examples of such actions.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 23–24.  This construction is inconsistent \nwith § 888.113(c)(4)’s phrasing, which provides, “Actions that may serve as the basis of a \nsuspension of Small Area FMRs are,” then lists three specific actions.  24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4) \n(emphasis added).  Section 888.113(c)(4)’s use of the term “are” rather than “include” compels a \nconclusion that the enumerated examples constitute an exclusive, rather than merely illustrative, \nlist of actions that may justify suspending  an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA.  Had \nHUD wished to reserve to itself authority to suspend an SAFMR designation  for reasons other \nthan an enumerated action’s occurrence, HUD could have drafted § 888.113(c)(4) to provide that \n“Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs include” the three \nenumerated actions.  HUD, however, did not do that; by drafting § 888.113(c)(4) to contain the \nterm “are” rather than “include,”  HUD limited  its authority to suspend an SAFMR designation  to \nthe occurrence of an enumerated action.  Cf. Wallaesa, 824 F.3d at 1083. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 27 of 47\nSecond, the defendants argue that even if HUD may suspend an SAFMR designation or \nexempt a PHA only upon an enumerated action’s occurrence, the third action is phrased so \nbroadly as to give HUD essentially unreviewable discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation \nor exempt a PHA for any reason.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 22–26.  The ejusdem generis canon, the \ndefendants say, is inapplicable  because § 888.113(c)(4) contains no “general term which follows \nspecific ones.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 24 (alterations and internal quotation  marks omitted).  This is \nincorrect.  Section 888.113(c)(4) enumerates two specific actions—“A Presidentially  declared \ndisaster area that results in the loss of a substantial number of housing  units” and “A sudden \ninflux  of displaced needing permanent housing”—followed  by a third, more general action—\n“Other events as determined by the Secretary.”  24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).   \nThe defendants contend that the Rule’s overall context shows that ejusdem generis does \nnot apply, identifying  three aspects of the Rule that the defendants characterize indicating  “an \nintent to be expansive.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 24–25.  Although  “the ejusdem generis canon does not \ncontrol when the whole context dictates a different conclusion,”  Wallaesa, 824 F.3d at 1081 \n(alterations and internal quotation  marks omitted), the defendants’ argument actually ignores the \nregulation’s pertinent context and precise language.  The defendants observe that the regulation \nuses “self-contained,  broadly permissive language.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 25.  The ejusdem generis \ncanon applies, however, to language that otherwise reads broadly.  See Wallaesa, 824 F.3d at \n1081.  The defendants note that “the language introducing  the enumerated examples contains no \nindication  that those examples are meant to restrict the circumstances under which HUD may \nfind a suspension warranted.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 25.  The ejusdem generis canon, however, \nrequires no clear statement that specific language limits  general language’s scope.  Indeed, to \nrequire such clarity would defeat the canon’s purpose of clarifying  ambiguous  statutes.  Finally, \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 28 of 47\nthe defendants observe that the third action’s wording “specifically  states that the nature of the \nreferenced ‘events’ are those that are ‘determined by the Secretary,’ not those that are similar in \nkind to the preceding examples,” which the defendants argue “forecloses the notion that the \nnature of the ‘events’ referenced therein is to be limited  by the preceding examples.”  Id.  That \nHUD has some discretion to determine which events justify suspending an SAFMR designation \nis undisputed,  however; the question is whether that discretion is bounded.  Here, the sequence of \ntwo specifically-phrased  actions followed by a generally-phrased third action indicates that the \nfirst two actions limit  HUD discretion under the third action.  To construe the third action as \nreaching any event the first two actions do not reach would defeat the purpose of enumerating an \nexclusive list of “[a]ctions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs.”  24 \nC.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4). \nNor would applying  the ejusdem generis canon render the phrase “as determined by the \nSecretary” superfluous.  This language, read in context, can be read to vest HUD with discretion \nto determine whether a qualifying  event warrants an SAFMR designation’s  suspension or a \nPHA’s exemption, such that HUD need not suspend a designation or exempt a PHA each time a \ndesignated area or PHA experiences a disaster.  This language does not allow HUD to determine \nwhether something qualifies  as an “event” in the first place.  In other words, § 888.113(c)(4)(iii) \ngives HUD discretion, but cabins that discretion by allowing  its exercise only upon a qualifying \n“event[’s]” occurrence.  The defendants compare the phrase “other events as determined by the \nSecretary” to the language of 49 U.S.C. § 44702(d)(2),  which authorizes the Federal Aviation \nAdministration  to “rescind a delegation . . . at any time for any reason the [agency] considers \nappropriate”—language  the D.C. Circuit held “very clearly commits the renewal/nonrenewal \ndesignation  to agency discretion.”  Steenholdt v. FAA, 314 F.3d 633, 638 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  The \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 29 of 47\nphrase at issue here, however, is considerably  narrower than § 44702(d)(2)’s language.  \nSteeholdt, if anything,  cuts against the defendants’ position  by illustrating  how an agency might \ndraft a rule that confers the boundless discretion HUD claims to possess. \nFinally,  the defendants invoke the Auer doctrine to argue that their construction of the \nregulation is due deference even if the regulation’s meaning is not clear.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 25–26.  \nAs explained in detail above, however, the defendants’ construction is “inconsistent  with the \nregulation,”  Press Commc’ns LLC, 875 F.3d at 1121, and thus due no deference.10 \nb)   HUD Failed to Identify Local Adverse Rental Housing Market Conditions \n  Whether HUD invoked a proper triggering  “event” to justify delaying by two years the \nRule’s implementation  thus turns on whether HUD based the Rule’s delay on an event involving \nlocal “adverse rental housing market conditions.”  The Suspension Memorandum presents three \nrationales for delaying the Rule’s implementation:   (1) the Interim Report’s findings  showing the \nRule’s potentially  negative impact on voucher holders; (2) comments received in response to the \nReducing Regulatory Burden notice; and (3) HUD’s failure timely to create SAFMR guidance \nand technical assistance for affected PHAs.  Suspension Mem. at 5–8.  The latter two rationales \nhave nothing  to do with local rental housing market conditions  in the 23 affected PHAs, and so \ncannot independently  sustain HUD’s invocation  of § 888.113(c)(4)’s third action.  As to the \nRule’s potential adverse impact on voucher holders, the Suspension Memorandum identified \nevidence from the Interim Report, which evaluated the demonstration  project’s preliminary \nfindings,  that SAFMRs may decrease rental housing unit stock.  Id. at 5–6.  The demonstration \n                                              \n10   A conclusion that 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4) does not give HUD essentially boundless discretion to suspend \nan SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA for any reason, but rather provides meaningful standards by which a court \nmay evaluate the lawfulness of HUD’s actions, necessarily also defeats the defendants’ contention that HUD’s delay \nof the SAFMR Rule’s implementation is not reviewable.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 19–21; see Cody v. Cox, 509 F.3d 606, \n610 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“[Re]but[ting] the presumption that agency action is judicially reviewable” requires a \ndefendant to show that “the relevant statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against \nwhich to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 30 of 47\nproject’s 7 pilot  PHAs and the 200+ Rule-affected PHAs essentially do not overlap, however, \nand HUD has identified  no basis to conclude that any lessons on SAFMRs’ efficacy that can be \nextrapolated from the demonstration project findings  apply to the Rule-affected PHAs, as \nmaterial differences in the pilot and Rule-affected PHAs’ relevant characteristics exist. 11   \nIndeed, given that HUD selected the pilot and Rule-affected PHAs using entirely different \ncriteria to serve entirely different purposes, any assumption that the pilot PHAs represent the \nRule-affected PHAs, or vice versa, in relevant respects seems highly  questionable.  HUD thus \nhas failed to identify adverse rental housing market conditions  local to the 23 Rule-affected \nareas, and so cannot invoke the authority that § 888.113(c)(4) gives the agency to suspend an \nSAFMR designation  or exempt a PHA without notice and comment. \n  The Suspension Memorandum primarily  relied on the Interim Report’s findings  that \nSAFMR use caused a net loss of units available to voucher holders in the pilot  PHAs.  The \nInterim Report stated that although  the pilot PHAs’ use of SAFMRs \nshould increase the pool of units potentially  available . . . in high-rent FMRs, while \nreducing the pool of units that are located in lower-rent ZIP codes . . . . the gain in \nunits with rents below the applicable FMR in high-rent ZIP codes did not offset the \ndecrease in  the number  of units  in  the low-rent  and moderate-rent  ZIP codes, \nresulting in a net loss of units that are potentially  available to voucher families. \nSuspension Mem. at 5; see Interim Report at vii.  The Suspension Memorandum concluded that \n“[t]he net effect across the 7 study PHAs is a loss of over 22,000 units (3.4 percent) that might \notherwise have been affordable to voucher families.”  Suspension Mem. at 5.   \n                                              \n11   The one PHA that the demonstration project and Rule both affected is the Housing Authority of Cook \nCounty, Illinois.

For example, in at least \none significant  way, the Long Beach pilot PHA did not demographically  represent the Rule-\naffected PHAs.  Long Beach’s high-rent ZIP codes contained only 11 percent of the PHA’s \nrental housing units, a lower figure than for any other pilot  PHA.  Interim Report at 28 & tbl. 4-\n1.   By contrast, high-rent ZIP codes in each Rule-affected area must, according to the selection \ncriteria, contain at least 20 percent of the area’s total rental housing  unit supply.  See SAFMR \nArea Designations, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679; 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(1).12  This contrast is \nsignificant  because SAFMRs increase rental unit affordability  in high-rent ZIP codes and \ndecrease rental unit affordability  in low-rent ZIP codes, and thus reduce overall rental housing \nunit supply more dramatically  in areas like Long Beach, which have relatively  few high-rent \nunits, than areas with more high-rent units.  Interim Report at 32–34.  “[I]f fewer rental units . . . \nare in high-rent ZIP Codes than in low-rent ZIP Codes . . . then the shift to SAFMRs will mean \nfewer units” available.  Id. at 34. \nLong Beach, though only one of the seven pilot PHAs, distorted the demonstration \nproject’s findings  because much of the net decrease in rental housing unit supply that the project \nattributed to SAFMRs occurred in Long Beach.  The Interim Report found that decreases in \nrental housing unit supply largely were concentrated in Long Beach, which saw a greater than 10 \n                                              \n12   The Interim Report defined a high-rent ZIP code as a zip code with a “rent ratio”—the ratio of a two-\nbedroom SAFMR over a two-bedroom metropolitan area FMR—of greater than 1.1, and a low-rent ZIP code as a \nzip code with a rent ratio of below 0.9.  Interim Report at 27. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 32 of 47\npercent net loss of rental housing unit supply.  Id. at vii.13  By contrast, two pilot PHAs—Laredo \nand Mamaroneck—saw “virtually  no change in the overall number of units” available after \nimplementing  SAFMRs whatsoever.  Id. at 33 & tbl. 4-5.  Long Beach, an area demographically \nunrepresentative of the Rule-affected areas, thus skewed the demonstration  project’s findings. \nThe pilot PHAs also did not represent Rule-affected areas with respect to the SAFMR \nmandate’s geographic scope within a metropolitan  area.  Only two of the seven pilot PHAs—\nLaredo and Mamaroneck—mandated SAFMR use throughout  the entire metropolitan  area.  Id. at \n33.  Laredo and Mamaroneck were “unique among the SAFMR PHAs in that their jurisdictions \nare the same as the geographies for which their respective FMRs are calculated.”  Id.  Laredo and \nMamaroneck, in other words, were the only PHAs in their respective metropolitan  areas, and, as \nsuch, implementation  of SAFMRs applied across those two PHAs’ entire metropolitan  areas.  \nFive of the seven pilot PHAs, however, did not make PHA use mandatory across an entire \nmetropolitan  area.  Id.  In contrast, all PHAs within each metropolitan  area that the Rule affects \nuse SAFMRs.  24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(3); Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,568.  An SAFMR’s \ngeographic scope within a metropolitan  area matters because “[i]f only a few agencies within a \nmetropolitan  area use Small Area FMRs, voucher holders may have difficulty  moving to high-\nopportunity  neighborhoods  outside those agencies’ jurisdiction.”   CBPP Decl. ¶ 7.  “For \nexample, if an urban agency adopts Small Area FMRs but the surrounding  suburbs do not, then \nfamilies will face the same cost hurdles that currently prevent them from moving to lower-\npoverty, suburban neighborhoods.”   Id.  Indeed, HUD itself acknowledged this conclusion  during \nboth the demonstration  project and the rulemaking  period.  See NPRM, 81 Fed. Reg. at 39,224; \nProposed Demonstration Project, 75 Fed. Reg. at 27,811.  When PHAs in low-rent ZIP codes, \n                                              \n13   The Dallas pilot PHA also saw a large decrease in number of rental housing units lost, but this loss \namounted to only 4% of the Dallas pilot PHA’s total rental housing unit supply.  Interim Report at vii. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 33 of 47\nbut not PHAs in high-rent ZIP codes, adopt SAFMRs, voucher holders will face rising rents in \nlow-income areas but no commensurate decrease in rents in high-rent ZIP codes.  SAFMRs’ \nsuccess thus requires all PHAs within a metropolitan  area to adopt SAFMRs.  Laredo and \nMamaroneck, the only two pilot  PHAs that implemented  SAFMRs throughout  their entire \nmetropolitan  areas, significantly  were the only pilot PHAs that saw virtually  no decrease in \nrental housing unit supply.  Interim Report at 33.  The lack of any metropolitan  area-wide \nSAFMR mandate in five of seven pilot PHAs’ respective metropolitan  areas raises yet another \nquestion about the demonstration project findings’  applicability  to the Rule-affected areas, which \nmandate SAFMR use throughout their entire metropolitan  areas. \n  That the pilot  PHAs were not representative of Rule-affected PHAs is unsurprising,  as \nHUD used entirely different criteria to select these two groups.  HUD used five fixed, objective \n“selection criteria” to determine which PHAs the Rule would cover: the (1) “number of vouchers \nunder lease in the metropolitan  FMR area;” (2) “percentage of the standard quality rental stock, \nwithin the metropolitan  FMR area is in small areas (ZIP codes) where the Small Area FMR is \nmore than 110 percent of the metropolitan  FMR area;” (3) “percentage of voucher families living \nin concentrated low income areas;” (4) “percentage of voucher families living  in concentrated \nlow income areas relative to the percentage of all renters within these areas over the entire \nmetropolitan  area;” and (5) “vacancy rate for the metropolitan  area.”  24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(1).  \nHUD also, by notice published  in the Federal Register, identified  objective “selection values” for \neach criterion “to determine . . . metropolitan  FMR areas subject to Small Area FMRs”:  (1) \n“[t]here are at least 2,500 HCV under lease;” (2) “[a]t least 20 percent of the standard quality \nrental stock, within the metropolitan  FMR area is in small areas (ZIP codes) where the Small \nArea FMR is more than 110 percent of the metropolitan  FMR;” (3) “[t]he percentage of voucher \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 34 of 47\nfamilies living  in concentrated low income areas relative to all renters within the area must be at \nleast 25 percent;” (4) “[t]he measure of the percentage of voucher holders living  in concentrated \nlow income areas relative to all renters within these areas over the entire metropolitan  area \nexceeds 155 percent;” and (5) “[t]he vacancy rate for the metropolitan  area is higher than 4 \npercent.”  SAFMR Area Designations, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679.14   \nEntirely different criteria guided the pilot  PHAs’ selection.  HUD first constructed a pool \nof PHAs that met seven initial  criteria, which were entirely different than the criteria HUD used \nto determine the Rule’s coverage.  HUD included in the initial  pool each PHA that: (1) “[h]ad at \nleast 500 vouchers in use as of September 30, 2011;” (2) “[h]ad at least 10 housing choice \nvoucher (HCV) tenants living  in ZIP Codes where the SAFMR exceeded the metropolitan  area \nFair Market Rent (FMR) by more than 10 percent in fiscal year 2012;” (3) “[h]ad at least 10 \nHCV tenants living  in ZIP Codes where the SAFMR was more than 10 percent less than the \nmetropolitan  area FMR;” (4) “[h]ad attained at least 95 percent HCV family reporting in Public \nand Indian Housing Information Center;” (5) “[w]as not troubled, as determined by the Section 8 \nManagement Assessment Program;” (6) “[h]ad the administrative  capacity to carry out the \nSAFMR program;” and (7) “[h]ad not been involved  in litigation  that would seriously impede its \nability  to administer  the HCV program.”  Demonstration Project, 77 Fed. Reg. at 69,652.  These \ncriteria produced a pool of 247 eligible  PHAs, which HUD organized into eight selection clusters \nbased on each PHA’s (1) number of vouchers (small or large), (2) metropolitan  area two-\nbedroom FMR (low or high), and (3) number of working-age heads of household (low or high \n                                              \n14   With respect to the fifth criterion, HUD defined a metropolitan area’s vacancy rate as “the number of \nVacant For Rent Units divided by the sum of the number of Vacant For Rent Units, the number of Renter Occupied \nUnits, and the number of Rented, not occupied units.”  SAFMR Area Designations, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679.  HUD \ncalculated the vacancy rate “using data from the 1-year American Community Survey (ACS) tabulations” by \naveraging values “from the 3 most current ACS 1 year datasets available.”  Id. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 35 of 47\npercentage).  Interim Report at 99 & tbl. A-1.  HUD then randomly ordered PHAs within each \ncluster, and invited the PHA at the top of each cluster to participate in the demonstration project.  \nId. at 100.  When a PHA declined to participate, HUD invited a cluster’s next ranking PHA.  Id.  \nAfter several rounds of invitations,  five PHAs had agreed to participate in the demonstration \nproject.  Id.  Finally,  HUD included in the project two PHAs from the Dallas metropolitan  area, \nwhich have used SAFMRs since 2011 pursuant to a settlement agreement.  Id. at 3. \nHUD’s decision to use different selection criteria for the pilot PHAs and Rule-affected \nareas reflects the different purposes HUD intended the demonstration project and Rule to serve.  \nHUD “randomly  selected five PHAs for the demonstration  that differed across various \ncharacteristics” because HUD sought “[t]o test how SAFMRs may potentially  affect a range of \nPHA types.”  Interim Report at 2.  In promulgating  the Rule, however, HUD specifically  targeted \n“those metropolitan  areas . . . where establishing  FMRs by ZIP code areas has the potential to \nsignificantly  increase opportunities  for voucher families.”  Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,568.  \nHUD’s different objectives in undertaking  the demonstration project and promulgating  the Rule \nfurther illustrate the inadequacy of HUD’s reliance on the demonstration  project’s preliminary \nfindings  to justify the Rule’s delay. \n  Finally,  HUD’s incorporation  into the Rule of various provisions  designed to protect \nagainst the very concerns that the demonstration  project identified  further undermines HUD’s \nreliance on demonstration  project data to delay the Rule.  Most significantly,  as discussed above, \nthe Rule requires all PHAs within an affected metropolitan  area to use SAFMRs, addressing a \ncrucial issue that the demonstration project uncovered. 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(3); Final Rule, 81 \nFed. Reg. at 80,568.  The Rule also contains several other provisions  to protect voucher holders \nagainst issues the demonstration project revealed, including  (1) “limit[ing]  the annual decrease in \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 36 of 47\nSmall Area FMRs to no more than 10 percent of the area’s FMR in the prior fiscal year” and \nallowing  PHAs to (2) “hold  harmless those families remaining  in place from payment standard \nreductions,” (3) “establish a new payment standard for families under HAP contract between the \nfull ‘hold harmless’ option . . . and the new payment standard based on the Small Area FMR,” \n(4) “establish different policies regarding how decreases in payment standards will apply [to \nvoucher holders] for designated areas within their jurisdiction,”  and (5) “request and receive \napproval to establish an exception payment standard promptly  for a ZIP Code area if necessary \nto react to rapidly changing market conditions  or to ensure sufficient rental units are available for \nvoucher families.”  Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,572–74.  HUD has discounted the importance \nof two of these five enumerated voucher holder protections incorporated into the Rule, noting \nthat the 10 percent SAFMR cap “may only slow the pace of the loss of units, as opposed to \npreventing the overall decline in the number of units available to HCV families,”  and that the \n“hold harmless” provision does not “protect[] families that must move to a new unit or [] \napplicant families off the waiting list who are trying to lease a unit on the program for the first \ntime.”  Suspension Mem. at 5–7.  HUD seemingly  has not, however, considered or addressed the \nRule’s other voucher holder protection provisions.15 \n  In sum, the significant  differences between the (1) pilot  and Rule-affected PHAs, (2) \nselection criteria HUD used to identify  each group, and (3) purposes HUD sought the \ndemonstration  project and Rule to achieve impose on HUD a burden to show that any \nconclusions  the Interim Report extrapolated from the demonstration  project’s findings  apply to \n                                              \n15   As the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law, which filed a brief as amicus \ncuriae in support of plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, observe, various provisions of the Rule are \n“expressly designed to limit Rule-related increases in tenants’ rent burdens . . . . [b]ut HUD makes no mention of \nthese differences between the demonstration project and the Small Area Rule, even as it relies on the Interim \nEvaluation of the demonstration projects as a justification for suspending implementation of the Rule.”  Amicus Br. \nat 8, ECF No. 21.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 37 of 47\nthe specific Rule-affected areas.  Neither the Suspension Memo nor Letter to PHAs, however, \neven attempt to make such a showing.  Nor, for that matter, does the defendants’ briefing.  The \nplaintiffs  thus have established likely success on the merits of their notice and comment claim. \n2.  HUD’s Delay of the Rule’s Implementation Was Arbitrary and Capricious \nThe plaintiffs  also argue that HUD’s delay of the Rule’s implementation  was arbitrary \nand capricious.  Pls.’ Mem at 28–34.  According to the plaintiffs,  HUD failed adequately to \nexplain its reasons for delaying the Rule’s implementation.   Id. at 28.  As explained above, § \n888.113(c)(4) required HUD to identify adverse rental housing market conditions  local to a \nparticular area or PHA to justify suspending  an SAFMR designation  or exempting a PHA in that \narea.  HUD, as explained,  did no such thing.  Instead, HUD attempted to justify delaying the \nRule’s implementation  by two years by citing data based on a small number of pilot PHAs, \nwhich did not represent the Rule-affected areas in terms of demographics or scope and which \nHUD selected partially  randomly (1) on the basis of entirely different criteria than those HUD \nused to select the Rule-affected areas and (2) for entirely different objectives than HUD sought \nto achieve through the Rule’s promulgation.   HUD, in so doing,  “relied on factors”—i.e., the \ndemonstration  project data—“which [law] ha[d] not intended it to consider” and “entirely failed \nto consider an important aspect of the problem”—i.e., local rental housing market conditions  in \nthe Rule-affected areas.  Mayo, 875 F.3d at 19 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (alterations \nomitted)).  HUD’s two-year delay of the Rule’s implementation  therefore was arbitrary and \ncapricious.  As such, the plaintiffs  have demonstrated a likelihood  of success on the merits as to \ntheir arbitrary and capricious claim, for essentially  the same reasons they have shown likely \nsuccess on the merits as to their notice and comment claim. \nB.     Risk of Irreparable Harm \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 38 of 47\nThe plaintiffs  argue that they will suffer irreparable harm if HUD does not implement  the \nRule by January 1, 2018.  “The party seeking a preliminary  injunction  must make two showings \nto demonstrate irreparable harm.”  League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 7.  “First, the harm \nmust be ‘certain and great,’ ‘actual and not theoretical,’ and so ‘imminent  that there is a clear and \npresent need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.’”  Id. at 7–8 (quoting Chaplaincy of \nFull Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (alterations omitted)).  \n“Second, the harm ‘must be beyond remediation.’”  Id. at 8 (quoting  Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at \n297).  Here, plaintiffs  Crystal Carter, Tiana Moore, and OCA each have made a requisite \nshowing of irreparable harm from the Rule’s delay. \n1.     Crystal Carter \nPlaintiff Crystal Carter has demonstrated a risk of irreparable injury  sufficient to warrant \na preliminary  injunction.   Ms. Carter and her five minor children currently use a Housing Choice \nVoucher to rent a four-bedroom house in the City of Hartford, Connecticut.  Carter Decl. ¶ 1.  \nThree of Ms. Carter’s children attend high-performing  schools in the Simsbury School District \nthrough Hartford’s Open Choice school integration  program.  Id. ¶ 4.  Ms. Carter wishes to use \nher voucher to move to the town of Simsbury in Hartford County, Connecticut, to be closer to \nthose schools.  Id. ¶ 6.  Simsbury’s poverty rate of 3.4 percent, Decl. of Sasha Samberg-\nChampion (“Pls.’ Decl.”), Ex. I, Poverty Data for Simsbury  Town, CT, ECF No. 16-9, is much \nlower than the poverty rate in Ms. Carter’s ZIP code, which is 32.2 percent, Pls.’ Decl., Ex. G, \nPoverty Data for 06114 ZIP Code, ECF No 16-7.  Simsbury  offers higher quality education and a \nsafer living  environment for Ms. Carter’s entire family than does Hartford.  Carter Decl. ¶ 6.  As \nthe plaintiffs  observe, “[l]iving  close to her children’s schools has obvious benefits for any \nparent, including  reducing the children’s commute times, giving them more opportunity  to \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 39 of 47\nengage with their classmates out of school, and allowing  the parent to be more involved  with her \nchildren’s schools.”  Pls.’ Mem. at 39. \nThe Rule’s implementation  would enable Ms. Carter to move her family from Hartford to \nSimsbury; the Rule’s suspension deprives her of the Rule’s benefits.  If the Rule goes into effect, \nthe FMR for a four-bedroom unit in much of Simsbury will be $1,940 per month for Fiscal Year \n2018.  See Pls.’ Decl., Ex. F, 2018 Hartford SAFMRs at 2, ECF No. 16-6.16  Should the Rule’s \nimplementation  remain delayed, however, the FMR for a four-bedroom dwelling  in Simsbury \nwill be $1,620 per month, see Pls.’ Decl., Ex. E, 2018 Hartford FMRs at 5, ECF No. 16-5—an \namount that Ms. Carter’s experience shows to be insufficient  to find an appropriate in Simsbury.  \nCarter Decl. ¶ 7.  The fact that Ms. Carter’s PHA may implement  SAFMRs voluntarily,  see \nSuspension Mem. at 3; Letter to PHAs at 3, does not prevent Ms. Carter from showing \nirreparable harm.  For the reasons explained above, SAFMRs fail to assist voucher holders to \nrelocate to high-opportunity  areas unless all or substantially  all PHAs within a metropolitan  area \nimplement  SAFMRs, meaning that a single PHA, such as Ms. Carter’s, likely  will not implement \nSAFMRs voluntarily.   Further, HUD’s counsel conceded at oral argument that no Rule-affected \nPHA has come forward to opt into the Rule voluntarily,  Hr’g Tr. at 18–19, which likewise \nillustrates the unlikeliness  that Ms. Carter’s PHA will implement  SAFMRs voluntarily. \nThe defendants correctly observe that Ms. Carter’s children already attend school in \nSimsbury,  Defs.’ Opp’n at 34, but do not dispute that Ms. Carter would enjoy the obvious \nbenefits of “be[ing] closer to [her] children’s schools” and “liv[ing]  in a safer and healthier \nneighborhood  environment  for [her] children” if she lived in Simsbury.  Carter Decl. ¶ 6.  The \n                                              \n16   The Court, relying on the United States Postal Service’s “Look Up A ZIP Code” tool, see Look Up A Zip \nCodeTM, U.S. POSTAL SERV., https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action?mode=2&refresh=true (last \nvisited Dec. 23, 2017), takes judicial notice that the ZIP Code for much of Simsbury is 06070.  FED. R. EVID. 201. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 40 of 47\ndefendants argue that “the mere possibility  . . . that [Ms. Carter’s] school-age children may \npotentially  earn a higher income in their mid-twenties  if they move at some point to a lower-\npoverty area is entirely speculative and in no way imminent.”   Defs.’ Opp’n at 34.  The \nplaintiffs,  however, identify “robust evidence that children who moved to lower-poverty areas \nwhen they were young (below age 13) are more likely  to attend college,” to “have substantially \nhigher incomes as adults,” and to “live in better neighborhoods  themselves as adults,” and are \n“less likely  to become single parents.”  Raj Chetty et al., The Effects of Exposure to Better \nNeighborhoods on Children: New Evidence from the Moving to Opportunity Experiment, 106 \nAM. ECON. REV. 855, 899 (2016); see also LORA ENGDAHL, POVERTY & RACE RES. ACTION \nCOUNCIL, NEW NEIGHBORHOODS, NEW SCHOOLS: A PROGRESS REPORT ON THE BALTIMORE \nHOUSING MOBILITY PROGRAM 27–28 (2009) (finding  that relocation to low-poverty areas \nproduces significant  mental health benefits to Housing Choice Voucher holders); MARGERY \nAUSTIN TURNER & LYNETTE RAWLINGS, URBAN INST., PROMOTING NEIGHBORHOOD DIVERSITY: \nBENEFITS, BARRIERS, AND STRATEGIES 2 (2009) (describing the myriad ways “[n]eighborhoods \nmatter to the well-being of children and families.”).  The weight of this research certainly \nindicates that Ms. Carter’s family may enjoy some additional  benefits from living  in Simsbury. \nThe defendants also argue that Ms. Carter has not “identified  any imminent  risk that she \nor her family will actually be subject to criminal  activity in Hartford.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 34. This \narguments set the bar too high.  “[A]s a preliminary  injunction  requires only a likelihood  of \nirreparable injury,  . . . Damocles’s sword does not have to actually fall . . . before the court will \nissue an injunction.”   League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8–9.  Irreparable harm can flow not \nonly from actual criminal  victimization,  but also from “continued  exposure to [a] high crime rate \n. . . and unsafe conditions  of [one’s] present community.”  Bronson v. Crestwood Lake Section 1 \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 41 of 47\nHolding Corp., 724 F. Supp. 148, 153 (S.D.N.Y. 1989); see also ENGDAHL, supra, at 27 \n(“Families  in disadvantaged neighborhoods  are at higher risk for disease and earlier death likely \ndue” in part to “the cumulative stress arising from living  in unsafe neighborhoods  with limited \nresources.”); TURNER & RAWLINGS, supra, at 3 (“Young people who live in high-crime  areas are \nmore likely to commit crimes themselves.”). \nThe defendants observe that Ms. Carter has not “alleged that she has applied for housing \nin Simsbury,  that if she did apply she would be likely to be selected despite competition  from \nother applicants, or that there are sufficient landlords in Simsbury participating  in the HCV \nprogram and accepting voucher-holding  tenants including,  in particular, her.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at \n34.  To apply for housing in Simsbury prior to the Rule’s implementation,  however, would be \nfutile—the Rule’s premise is that voucher holders such as Ms. Carter cannot obtain housing in \nhigh-income  areas like Simsbury  because current payment standards do not suffice to make such \nhousing affordable.  Ms. Carter has established that she intends to apply for and obtain such \nhousing as soon as she possibly can.  Carter Decl. ¶¶ 6–7.  A landlord’s  discrimination  against \nvoucher holders, moreover, would violate Connecticut law.  See Con. Gen. Stat. § 46a-64c; \nComm’n on Human Rights & Opportunities v. Sullivan Assocs., 739 A.2d 238, 241 (Conn. \n1999).  Furthermore, HUD’s own calculation,  based on detailed housing market data, that an \nFMR of $1,940 will suffice to allow a voucher holder to rent a four-bedroom unit in Simsbury \nbelies HUD’s speculative assertion that such units may be unavailable  to Ms. Carter even under \nthe Rule, see Defs.’ Opp’n at 34. \nFinally,  the defendants dispute that any expenses associated with Ms. Carter’s longer \ncommute would be sufficiently  burdensome to warrant injunctive  relief.  Id.  This argument \nmischaracterizes the nature of the harm that Ms. Carter’s family would suffer from her commute.  \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 42 of 47\nThe relevant harm is not primarily  an economic injury,  but “the opportunity  cost of spending \nhours on a bus instead of participating  in after school activities,  studying,  and engaging in active \nplay.”  Pls.’ Reply at 21. \n2.  Tiara Moore \nPlaintiff Tiara Moore likewise has demonstrated a risk of irreparable injury sufficient to \nwarrant a preliminary  injunction.   Ms. Moore and her minor child live in an apartment in the City \nof Chicago, Illinois.   Moore Decl. ¶ 1.  The Chicago Housing Authority has issued Ms. Moore a \nHousing Choice Voucher for $1,207 per month for a two-bedroom unit.  Id. ¶¶ 4, 7.  Ms. Moore \nwishes to move to DuPage County, Illinois,  to live in a neighborhood  that will afford her family \ngreater employment  opportunities,  higher quality education, and a safer living  environment,  as \nwell as to be nearer to Ms. Moore’s mother, who provides child care so that Ms. Moore can \nwork.  Id. ¶¶ 5–6.  DuPage County’s poverty rate of 7.4 percent, Pls.’ Decl., Ex. J, Poverty Data \nfor DuPage County, Ill., ECF No. 16-10, is also much lower than the poverty rate in Ms. \nMoore’s ZIP code, which is 33.8 percent, Pls.’ Decl., Ex. H, Poverty Data for 60644 ZIP Code, \nECF No 16-8.  Ms. Moore has not, however, been able to locate any two-bedroom rental units in \nDuPage County for $1,207 per month.  Id. ¶ 7.  The Rule would enable Ms. Moore to move her \nfamily from the City of Chicago to DuPage County.  For fiscal year 2018, the FMR for a two-\nbedroom unit in the broad Chicago metropolitan  area, which includes DuPage County, would be \n$1,180 per month.  Pls.’ Decl., Ex. C, Chicago FMRs at 1, ECF No. 16-3.  In contrast, under the \nRule, 41 of DuPage County’s ZIP codes would have SAFMRs exceeding $1,180 per month, with \nSAFMRs in the highest-cost ZIP codes reaching $1,770 per month.  Pls.’ Decl., Ex. D, 2018 \nChicago SAFMRs, ECF No. 16-4.  This difference in voucher purchasing power throughout \nmuch of DuPage County would dramatically improve Ms. Moore’s ability  to find suitable \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 43 of 47\nhousing there.  In addition,  Ms. Moore will,  absent the Rule’s implementation,  continue to incur \nopportunity  and transportation costs arising from her daily trips to bring her child to and from her \nmother’s house for child care.  Moore Decl. ¶ 6. \nThe defendants argue that Ms. Moore will suffer no injury  from the Rule’s delay, as the \nRule would not benefit her in the first place.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 35.  The defendants observe that \nthe Chicago Housing Authority is a Moving to Work PHA and so would be exempt from use of \nSAFMRs even if the Rule were implemented.  See id., Attach. 3, Decl. of Marianne Nazzaro ¶¶ \n2–3, ECF No. 24-3; Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,578.  Ms. Moore, however, seeks to move to \nDuPage County, not to Chicago.  Moore Decl. ¶¶ 5–6, 9.  The DuPage County PHA, not the \nChicago Housing Authority,  sets payment standards for DuPage County, see 24 C.F.R. § \n982.503(a)(1) (providing  that PHAs set payment standards for their own jurisdictions),  and, \nunlike the Chicago Housing Authority, is not a Moving to Work PHA, see Moving to Work \n(MTW) - Participating Sites, U.S. DEP’T HOUSING & URBAN DEV., \nhttps://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph/mtw/mtwsites  (last \nvisited Dec. 23, 2017).  The Rule’s implementation  thus would benefit Ms. Moore.17 \n3.  OCA \nFinally,  Plaintiff OCA has demonstrated a risk of irreparable injury  sufficient to warrant a \npreliminary  injunction.   An organization,  to show irreparable harm, must show first that “the \n‘actions taken by the defendant have perceptibly impaired  the organization’s  programs.”  League \nof Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8 (quoting Fair Emp’t Council of Greater Wash., Inc. v. BMC \nMktg. Corp., 28 F.3d 1268, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).  “If so, the organization  must then also show \n                                              \n17   The defendants also assert that their arguments as to why Ms. Carter has not shown irreparable harm apply \nequally to Ms. Moore.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 34–35.  The defendants’ arguments fail as to Ms. Moore for the same reason \nthey fail as to Ms. Carter. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 44 of 47\nthat the defendant’s actions ‘directly conflict with the organization’s  mission.”  Id. (quoting  Nat’l \nTreasury Emps. Union v. United States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1430 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).  “[O]bstacles \n[that] unquestionably  make it more difficult  for [an organization]  to accomplish [its] primary \nmission . . . provide injury  for purposes [of] . . . irreparable harm.”  Id. at 9.  OCA works “to \npromote access to opportunity,”  including  educational, employment,  and housing opportunity, \n“for all people, and specifically to address the disproportionate  isolation  from opportunity \nexperienced by Blacks and Latinos in Connecticut due to residential segregation.”  Pls.’ Mot., \nAttach. 5, Decl. of Erin Boggs, Exec. Dir., OCA (“OCA Decl.”) ¶ 2, ECF No. 15-5.  “OCA’s \ncentral focus in this work is leveraging affordable and subsidized  housing programs to enable \nlow-income families to access housing outside of areas with concentrated poverty and \nsegregation.”  Id.  Much of this work involves enabling  families who receive housing  vouchers \nto move to higher-opportunity  areas and addressing the concentration of voucher holders (who, \nin the Hartford area, primarily  are nonwhite) in high-poverty,  segregated areas.  Id. ¶¶ 4–9.  For \nexample, OCA works to improve housing  mobility  programs for voucher users and to increase \nthe supply of rental housing suitable for voucher holders in high-opportunity  neighborhoods.   Id.   \nOCA has shown that the Rule’s delay will “perceptibly  impair[]” OCA’s programs and \n“directly conflict with the organization’s  mission.”  League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8.  The \nRule’s delay frustrates OCA’s ability  to assist voucher holders gain access to greater opportunity \nin several ways.  First, the delay frustrates OCA’s “engage[ment] with . . . developers to \nencourage the acquisition  and construction of housing that is affordable to voucher holders in \nnon-concentrated, high-opportunity  areas in the Hartford metropolitan  area,” because “[t]he \nanticipated income from voucher holders will not support financing of such development while \n[voucher] rents are being calculated on a metropolitan-wide  basis, rather than with a small-area \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 45 of 47\ncalculation.”  OCA Decl. ¶ 8.  OCA also has diverted scarce resources away from previously \nplanned projects to address HUD’s delay of the Rule.  Id. ¶¶ 10–12.  “With the suspension in \neffect,” OCA explains, “OCA will need to spend significant  resources on research, outreach, \npublic education, and advocacy to implement  small area market rents ‘voluntarily’  on a PHA-by-\nPHA basis across the Hartford metropolitan  area, a multi-year  effort that may ultimately  prove \nfutile.”  Id. ¶ 10.  OCA has already changed its activities as a result of the Rule’s delay.  For \nexample, OCA “planned to produce a Small Area Fair Market Rent web portal which would \nhave included (a) an analysis of the difference between SAFMRs and FMRs across the state, (b) \nan explanation  of SAFMRs, (c) data on the current location of voucher holders, and (d) the \nresults of a time consuming  rent study that highlighted  the additional  units that would become \navailable under the new rent calculation formula.”  Id. ¶ 11.  In light of the Rule’s delay, OCA is \n“now taking steps to revise the content of this portal and to instead produce an advocacy piece, \nbased on this data, explaining  why the program freeze is detrimental.”  Id.  Finally,  the Rule’s \ndelay has required OCA “to engage in further meetings and other communications  with \nstakeholders to ensure that the impact of this policy suspension is fully understood” and to \n“spen[d] time conducting outreach to [OCA’s] coalition  members to explain the freeze and its \nconsequences for voucher holders.”  Id. ¶ 12. \nThe defendants assert that plaintiffs  must show that OCA’s claimed monetary loss \n“threatens the very existence of the movant’s business” to support OCA’s claims of irreparable \neconomic injury.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 36 (quoting  Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. \nCir. 1985)).  The defendants misread the authority on which they rely.  Wisconsin Gas Co. held \nthat “[r]ecoverable monetary loss may constitute irreparable harm only where the loss threatens \nthe very existence of the movant’s business.”  758 F.2d at 674.  OCA’s monetary losses, \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 46 of 47\nhowever, are not recoverable, as the APA provides no damages remedy.  See 5 U.S.C. § 702 \n(authorizing  actions “seeking relief other than money damages”).  Wisconsin Gas Go. thus is \ninapposite;  to show irreparable harm, OCA need only show that HUD’s delay of the Rule will \n“perceptibly  impair[]” OCA’s programs and “directly  conflict with the organization’s  mission.”  \nLeague of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8.  For the reasons given, OCA has made such a showing. \nC.     Balance of Equities and Public Interest \nThe third and fourth factors that courts consider in determining  whether a preliminary \ninjunction  is warranted are “a balance of the equities in [the plaintiffs’]  favor, and accord with \nthe public interest.”  Id. at 6 (quoting  Pursuing Am.’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d at 505).  The \nharm the plaintiffs  would suffer from the Rule’s delay is clear, for the reasons explained above.  \nAs HUD’s counsel acknowledged at oral argument, moreover, the Rule’s delay would leave in \nplace the 50th Percentile Rule, which the defendants recognize has failed to serve Section 8’s \ngoals.  Hr’g Tr. at 17.  The harms the defendants assert that voucher holders would suffer should \nHUD implement  the Rule on schedule, in contrast, are wholly  speculative because they presume \nthe Interim Report’s findings  apply to Rule-affected areas, which, also for reasons explained \nearlier, the defendants have failed to show.  The defendants, moreover, “cannot suffer harm from \nan injunction  that merely ends an unlawful practice.”  Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, \n1145 (9th Cir. 2013); accord R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015) (same).  \nThe balance of equities thus weighs in the plaintiffs’  favor.  A preliminary  injunction’s  issuance \nalso would serve the public interest.  “There is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of \nunlawful agency action.”  League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 12.  “To the contrary, there is a \nsubstantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws”—such as \nthe APA, as well as regulations such as § 888.113(c)(4)—“that  govern their existence and \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-02192-BAH   Document 29   Filed 12/23/17   Page 47 of 47\noperations.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Gulf Coast Mar. Supply, Inc. v. \nUnited States, 218 F. Supp. 3d 92, 101 (D.D.C. 2016), aff’d, 867 F.3d 123 (D.C. Cir. 2017) \n(“The public interest is served both by ensuring that government agencies conform to the \nrequirements of the APA.”).  As such, the plaintiffs have met their burdens to show that the \nbalance of equities and consideration of the public  interest support the injunctive  relief they seek. \nIV.   CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs’  motion for preliminary  injunction  is granted.  \nAn appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion. \nDate: December 23, 2017 \n \n \n__________________________ \nBERYL A.

Howell \nBEN S. CARSON, SR., Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development, in his official \ncapacity, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n  The plaintiffs, Open Communities Alliance and two individuals, prevailed in their suit to \nenjoin the defendants, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and \nHUD Secretary Ben Carson, see Open Cmtys. All. v. Carson, 286 F. Supp. 3d 148 (D.D.C. \n2017), from delaying for two years, “without notice and comment or particularized evidentiary \nfindings,” id. at 152, the implementation of a final rule regarding the calculation of voucher \nsubsidies.  Now, following the entry of judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor, Stipulated Judgment \nand Order at 2, ECF No. 34, the plaintiffs seek a total award of $154,272.11 in attorneys’ fees \nand costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act (“EAJA”), 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), see Pls.’ \nMot.

Defs.’ Opp’n \n(“Defs.’ Suppl.”) at 2, ECF No. 39.  For the reasons set out below, the plaintiffs’ motion is \ngranted in full.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nAs noted, the plaintiffs seek fees for 700.3 hours of attorney time, billed at $198 per hour, \nand 103 hours of paralegal time, billed at $140 per hour.  Pls.’ Mot. at 8–10.1  The plaintiffs \nderive their attorney time calculation from timesheets submitted by each of five co-counsel \norganizations, which add up to 778.1 attorney hours and 114.4 paralegal hours—a total that the \nplaintiffs then voluntarily cut by 10 percent, or 77.8 attorney hours and 11.4 paralegal hours, in \norder “to account for any concerns that may arise regarding ‘block billing’ practices and to \nensure that their bottom line figure is reasonable.”  Id. at 11–13.   \nIn addition to the timesheets from each co-counsel organization, see Pls.’ Mot., Exs. E–I, \nECF Nos. 35-7–35-11, which include more than 430 individual entries, the plaintiffs submitted a \ndetailed declaration that explains how the plaintiffs chose which hours to bill by “carefully \nreview[ing] each time entry” and “exercis[ing] billing judgment to forego recovery of certain \nwork so as to ensure that the fees requested are reasonable,” Pls.’ Mot., Attach. 2, Decl. of Sasha \nSamberg-Champion, Counsel, Relman, Dane & Colfax, PLLC (Mar. 15, 2018) (“Pls.’ Decl.”) ¶ \n23, ECF No. 35-2.  Specifically, the plaintiffs excluded from their request “all time expended by \nall attorneys except the primary ones assigned to this case for each organization; [] attorney or \n                                                 \n1   The plaintiffs correctly point out that “the $198 figure is conservative and arguably undervalues Plaintiffs’ \ntime,” Pls.’ Mot. at 9, particularly in light of the attorney’s fee matrix prepared by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the \nDistrict of Columbia “for use in cases in which a fee-shifting statute permits the prevailing party to recover \n‘reasonable’ attorney’s fees,” USAO ATTORNEY’S FEES MATRIX, 2015–2018, Explanatory Note 1, available at \nhttps://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/file/796471/download.  Under this matrix, which does not apply to cases such as \nthis one brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A) “for judicial review of agency action,” lawyers with less than two \nyears of experience have a prevailing hourly rate in 2017–2018 of $302 per hour.  USAO ATTORNEY’S FEES \nMATRIX.  \n2 \n \n\nparalegal time spent on calls, at hearing preparation sessions, or at hearings for which that \nattorney or paralegal’s presence was not required;” time spent “on witnesses that ultimately were \nnot used;” time spent “responding to press inquiries;” and “substantial” amounts of time spent on \n“co-counsel and client agreements.”  Id. ¶ 24.  In addition to then cutting their overall hours by \nten percent “to account for any concerns regarding block billing or inefficiencies,” id. ¶ 27, the \nplaintiffs have not billed for any time worked after January 5, 2018, including time spent on the \ninstant motion, id. ¶¶ 25–26. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nThe EAJA provides, in pertinent part, that “a court shall award to a prevailing party other \nthan the United States fees and other expenses . . . incurred by that party in any civil action . . . \nincluding proceedings for judicial review of agency action,” 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), with \ncertain exceptions not relevant here, such as cases where the government’s position was \n“substantially justified” or “special circumstances make an award unjust.”  As the Supreme \nCourt has “often recognized, ‘the specific purpose of the EAJA is to eliminate for the average \nperson the financial disincentive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.’”  Astrue v. \nRatliff, 560 U.S. 586, 599 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (quoting Commissioner v. Jean, \n496 U.S. 154, 163 (1990)); see also Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 406 (2004) \n(authorizing attorney’s fee awards against the Federal Government was intended “to eliminate \nthe barriers that prohibit small businesses and individuals from securing vindication of their \nrights in civil actions and administrative proceedings brought by or against the Federal \nGovernment” (internal quotations and citation omitted)); Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U.S. 877, 883 \n(1989) (the EAJA was designed to address the problem that “[f]or many citizens, the costs of \n3 \n \n\nsecuring vindication of their rights and the inability to recover attorney fees preclude resort to the \nadjudicatory process” (internal quotations and citation omitted)). \nThe role of the district court is “to determine what fee is ‘reasonable.’”  Wash. All. of \nTech. Workers v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 857 F.3d 907, 910 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting \nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)); see also id. at 911 (fee awards under EAJA are \nreviewed for abuse of discretion).  In making this determination, the district court reviews “[t]he \nnumber of hours reasonably expended on behalf of the prevailing party . . . by evaluating the \ntotal number of hours expended and disallowing unproductive time or time spent on unsuccessful \nclaims” and excluding from the calculation “hours that are ‘excessive, redundant, or otherwise \nunnecessary.’”  Murray v. Weinberger, 741 F.2d 1423, 1427 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (quoting Hensley, \n461 U.S. at 434); Wash. All. of Tech. Workers, 857 F.3d at 910.  Fee applications must “include \ncontemporaneous time records of hours worked and rates claimed, plus a detailed description of \nthe subject matter of the work with supporting documents, if any.”  In re Donovan, 877 F.2d 982, \n994 (D.C. Cir. 1989). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nThe defendants contend that the plaintiffs’ requested fee award should be reduced by \none-third because: (1) the plaintiffs’ use of block billing, including the improper billing of time \nfor administrative or clerical work, is per se unreasonable, Defs.’ Opp’n at 10–15; and (2) the \nplaintiffs’ timesheet entries are vague and/or duplicative, id. at 4–10.  Neither contention is \npersuasive. \nA.  The Plaintiffs’ Did Not Submit Improper Bills \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ request “should be reduced as a result of the \nsignificant amount of block billing entries,” Defs.’ Opp’n at 10, citing 148 such entries, Defs.’ \n4 \n \n\nSuppl., Exs. A–B, D, ECF Nos. 39-1, 39-2, 39-4, which the defendants posit prevent the Court \nfrom determining the reasonableness of the time spent on various tasks.2  Although block billing, \nwhere “time records lump together multiple tasks,” can “mak[e] it impossible to evaluate their \nreasonableness,” Role Models Am., Inc. v. Brownlee, 353 F.3d 962, 971 (D.C. Cir. 2004), \ncontrary to the defendants’ view, such billing is not per se impermissible.  Instead, a fee petition \n“need not present the exact number of minutes spent nor the precise activity to which each hour \nwas devoted nor the specific attainments of each attorney.”  Shaw v. Dist. of Columbia, 210 F. \nSupp. 3d 46, 52 (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting Nat’l Ass’n of Concerned Veterans v. Sec’y of Def., 675 \nF.2d 1319, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). \nBlock billing is even less concerning where the plaintiffs have prevailed on all of their \nclaims, see DL v. Dist. of Columbia, 256 F.R.D. 239, 245 (D.D.C. 2009), rev’d on other grounds, \n713 F.3d 120, 129 (D.C. Cir. 2013), or where the block billing does not “interfere[] with the \n[c]ourt’s ability to evaluate the reasonableness of billed hours spent on specific motions or \nfilings,” Hernandez v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 257 F. Supp. 3d 100, 112 (D.D.C. 2017) \n(citing Role Models, 353 F.3d at 970).  Ultimately, the test of the plaintiffs’ timesheets is whether \nthey are “of sufficient detail and probative value to enable the court to determine with a high \ndegree of certainty that such hours were actually and reasonably expended.”  Role Models, 353 \nF.3d at 970 (quoting In re Olson, 884 F.2d 1415, 1428 (D.C. Cir. 1989)). \n                                                 \n2   The defendants supplemented their opposition brief with annotated timesheets showing which entries the \ndefendants viewed as block billed, Defs.’ Suppl. at 1, and “impermissible,” Defs.’ Opp’n at 1.  Rather than seek \nreduction of the fee award for the total amount allegedly block billed, the defendants propose reducing by 40 percent \nthe purportedly block billed entries.  Defs.’ Suppl. at 1.  This 40 percent reduction number appears to have been \nconjured by defendants out of thin air, with no citation to any case law or even any proffered rationale.  The \ndefendants’ suggested 50 percent reduction for “entries that were both block billed and contained some \nnoncompensable activities,” id., and proposed 30 percent reduction “for general excessiveness, duplication, and \nvagueness,” id., appear similarly made-up. \n5 \n \n\nThe plaintiffs’ timesheets meet that standard.  The defendants cite in their briefing three \nexamples of block billing, Defs.’ Opp’n at 11–12, none of which poses any difficulty in \nevaluating reasonableness.  Indeed, many of the 148 entries identified by the defendants as block \nbilled simply provide significant detail about related tasks and the defendants “appear[] to \nconflate entries in which plaintiff[s’] counsel has provided greater detail with impermissible \nblock billing.”  Hernandez, 257 F. Supp. 3d at 112 (finding that “most of the entries listed by the \ndefendant are simply not block billed”). \nSpecifically, the defendants criticize as examples of block billing (1) the 6.1 hours billed \non November 2, 2017, for time spent “edit[ing]” different components of the plaintiffs’ \npreliminary injunction motion, Defs.’ Opp’n at 11; (2) the 7.2 hours billed on November 6, 2017, \nfor editing and “compiling [the] final version” of the preliminary injunction brief, and \n“confer[ring]” with defendants’ counsel about the briefing schedule, id. at 12; and (3) the 13.7 \nhours billed on December 11, 2017, for time spent finalizing and then filing the plaintiffs’ reply \nbrief, id. \nYet, these entries describe complementary tasks that would seamlessly occur and for \nwhich disaggregation would be difficult.  Notably, however, the defendants do not contend that, \nirrespective of the granular breakdown, the 6.1 hours spent editing a preliminary injunction \nmotion to be filed in federal court in a complex challenge to federal agency action is in any way \nunreasonable, or that any of the other two examples evidence an excessive number of hours for \nthe tasks described. \nCertainly, none of the entries challenged by the defendants “lump” together work on \nunrelated matters, Role Models, 353 F.3d at 971, in a manner that would be impermissible, and \nall relate to the plaintiffs’ successful litigation.  Instead, the challenged entries provide details \n6 \n \n\nabout subsets of tasks, such as editing, where disaggregation of the entries would not be useful to \nthe Court’s reasonableness evaluation.  See Hernandez, 257 F. Supp. 3d at 112 (“Explaining the \nrelated tasks that went into drafting the closing statement, or in scheduling a conference call, or \nin drafting and researching a surreply is not block billing, but is detailing the specific tasks \nperformed related to a larger overarching task.”).  As the plaintiffs point out, the defendants’ \nproposed 40-percent reduction for all entries identified as block-billed, Defs.’ Suppl. at 1, \n“would penalize Plaintiffs’ counsel for providing too much detail about discrete but related \ntasks,” given that each of the three examples of alleged block billing cited by the defendants’ \nbrief “could reasonably have been described as ‘Editing and preparing preliminary injunction \nand supporting documents,’” Pls.’ Reply Supp. Pls.’ Mot. (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 6, ECF No. 40.   \nIn short, the plaintiffs’ thorough timesheet entries are “of sufficient detail and probative \nvalue,” Role Models, 353 F.3d at 970 (quoting In re Olson, 884 F.2d at 1428), to show that the \ntime billed is reasonable.   \nIn addition to accusing the plaintiffs of impermissible block billing, the defendants object \nto certain “entries that are non-compensable as a matter of law.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 12.  First, the \n“numerous hours relating to the press” that the defendants claim are improperly billed, id. at 13, \nwere not actually included in the plaintiffs’ final timesheets as filed with the Court, see Pls.’ \nReply at 7 n.1; see also Pls.’ Decl. ¶ 24 (noting the plaintiffs did not bill for “time associated \nwith responding to press inquiries”).   \nSecond, the defendants complain that the plaintiffs “attempt to bill attorneys’ hours for \ntasks that could have been performed by a paralegal, and paralegals for time spent on clerical \nwork.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 13.  The sole example of the former, however, quotes only part of an \nentry for December 11, 2017, describing the final editing and proofing of the plaintiffs’ reply \n7 \n \n\nbrief—including “directing and reviewing paralegal work product,” Pls.’ Reply at 7—which is a \nreasonable task for an attorney.  The defendants’ seven cited examples of entries “billing for \nclerical work,” Defs.’ Opp’n at 13–14, are likewise unconvincing.  Although the defendants are \ncorrect that “purely clerical or secretarial tasks should not be billed at a paralegal rate,” Missouri \nv. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 288 n.10 (1989), such tasks have been defined as including \n“‘delivering’ or ‘picking up’ various documents as well as photocopying,” In re Meese, 907 F.2d \n1192, 1203 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  The defendants cite no authority for their claim that \n“organiz[ing],” “draft[ing],” or “fil[ing]” documents, or “review[ing]” the Court’s standing order \nor local rules, Defs.’ Opp’n at 13–14, constitute “purely clerical” rather than paralegal tasks, and \nso this objection falls flat. \nNext, the defendants object to the plaintiffs’ billing “relating to administrative matters \nsuch as client recruitment, ‘retainer agreements,’ ‘recruiting co-counsel,’ and ‘drafting co-\ncounsel agreements.’”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 14 (citing Role Models, 353 F.3d at 973 (“The \ngovernment should not have to pay for administrative matters relating to the formal relationship \nbetween Role Models and its attorneys.”)).  The plaintiff in Role Models, however, had a single \nattorney for its suit over the “disposi[tion] of excess military property,” 353 F.3d at 964; see also \nRole Models America, Inc. v. White, 193 F. Supp. 2d 76, 77 (D.D.C. 2002), whereas the instant \nplaintiffs were represented by “five co-counsel organizations,” Pls.’ Mot. at 11, in a far more \ncomplex suit challenging agency action relating to “200 local Public Housing Authorities . . . in \n24 metropolitan areas,” Open Cmtys., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 152.  Given the complexity of this case, \nand the fact that coordination between counsel for different civil rights organizations presents \nchallenges beyond simply establishing “the formal relationship between” a single plaintiff and its \nattorneys, Role Models, 353 F.3d at 973, the instant plaintiffs’ billing is not barred by any \n8 \n \n\nbinding precedent, nor is it unreasonable, especially given that the plaintiffs already excised from \ntheir request “substantial time associated with the formation of co-counsel and client \nagreements,” Pls.’ Decl. ¶ 24.   \nFinally, the defendants’ objection to billing entries for the time between when the \npreliminary injunction was granted on December 23, 2018, and when the stipulated judgment \nwas entered on February 16, 2018, Defs.’ Opp’n at 14–15, is ill-founded.  The defendants rely on \na single case, Doe v. Rumsfeld, 501 F. Supp. 2d 186, 193 (D.D.C. 2007), but this case is \ninapposite.  In Doe, the court excluded a reimbursement request for “work that occurred after \n[its] final judgment,” id. at 193, which is very clearly not the same as work undertaken between a \npreliminary injunction and a final stipulated judgment.3 \nIn sum, the plaintiffs did not, as the defendants claim, improperly use block billing, nor \ndid they bill for time that is non-compensable as a matter of law. \nB.  Entries are Not Unduly Excessive, Duplicative, or Vague \nThe defendants argue separately that the plaintiffs’ timesheet entries are marked by \n“general excessiveness, duplication, and vagueness.”  Defs.’ Suppl. at 1; Defs.’ Opp’n at 4–10.  \nThe Court disagrees. \nThe defendants first point to the plaintiffs’ litigation team of “eleven attorneys and five \nparalegals” to argue this team was “unnecessary” and “its natural result is excessive billing.”  \nDefs.’ Opp’n at 7.  Although courts have reduced fee awards due to overstaffing, see, e.g., Am. \n                                                 \n3   Although the plaintiffs chose not to seek recovery for time spent on this case after January 5, 2018, “on \nmatters within the scope of this litigation, including monitoring Defendants’ implementation and compliance with \nthe preliminary injunction; reviewing comments submitted to HUD regarding the suspension of the Small Area \nFMR Rule; and negotiating the final judgment that this Court entered,” Pls.’ Mot. at 11, such time, as well as time \nspent on the instant motion to collect a fee award, could have been recoverable, see Jean, 496 U.S. at 162–66.  As \nthe plaintiffs note, the litigation did not end when the preliminary injunction was granted, and “[p]reparation for the \nnext step of litigation in a pending case is a necessary task of responsible lawyers,” particularly where “HUD did not \nannounce contemporaneously that it would comply with this Court’s order, how it would do so, whether it would \nappeal, or even whether it would file a subsequent motion to dismiss.”  Pls.’ Reply at 9. \n9 \n \n\nImmigration Council v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 82 F. Supp. 3d 396, 411–12 (D.D.C. \n2015), the notion that multiple attorneys necessarily leads to excessive billing has been rejected \nby the D.C. Circuit.  See, e.g., In re Cisneros, 454 F.3d 342, 349 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (declining to \nreduce attorneys’ fees where the non-moving party has objected to “two or more attorneys billing \nfor the same task”); In re Madison Guar. Sav. & Loan (Marceca Fee Application), 366 F.3d 922, \n928 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (reducing fee award on grounds other than that “certain tasks were \nperformed by multiple attorneys”).  The number of attorneys working on a case, by itself, simply \n“may not be a reason to eliminate hours,” Davis Cty. Solid Waste Mgmt. & Energy Recovery \nSpecial Serv. Dist. v. EPA, 169 F.3d 755, 761 (D.C. Cir. 1999), since “[t]he issue is not whether \n[a party] used too many attorneys, but whether the work performed was unnecessary,” Donnell v. \nUnited States, 682 F.2d 240, 250 n.27 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has held that \nattorneys’ fees may be awarded for time spent by multiple attorneys conferring about a matter \nbecause such communication can “ensure that a case is managed in an effective as well as \nefficient manner.”  Nat’l Ass’n of Concerned Veterans v. Sec’y of Def., 675 F.2d 1319, 1337 \n(D.C. Cir. 1982); see also Petties v. Dist. of Columbia, Civ. No. 95-148, 2009 WL 8663462, at \n*8 (D.D.C. Oct. 20, 2009) (approving reasonableness of billing where “plaintiffs’ attorneys have \ndivided among themselves the many complex matters involved in this case, [so] they must meet \noccasionally or talk on the phone or exchange e-mails to discuss these issues and to strategize”).  \nIn fact, to guard against excessive billing by multiple attorneys, the plaintiffs took the \nresponsible step of excluding from their fee request “all time expended by all attorneys except \nthe primary ones assigned to this case for each organization” and “attorney or paralegal time \nspent on calls, at hearing preparation sessions, or at hearings for which that attorney or \nparalegal’s presence was not required.”  Pls.’ Decl. ¶ 24. \n10 \n \n\nTo bolster their claim of excessive billing, the defendants also cite “the nature of this \ncase,” which the defendants describe as “present[ing] no novel issue of law, no administrative \nrecord, no disputes of fact, involv[ing] no discovery and present[ing] a straightforward challenge \nto HUD’s alleged failure to comply with governing statutes and its own regulation.”  Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 7.  This argument is wholly unpersuasive, because the fact that this case was largely \nresolved at the preliminary injunction stage, and without a multiplicity of filings, does not mean \nthat it was a simple matter.  The plaintiffs note that they “did the work of collecting and \nanalyzing what would have been the [administrative] record,” and filed “a lengthy, complicated \ncomplaint and papers in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction” which required \n“expert analysis of the lengthy Interim Report, fact-gathering,” and other research.  Pls.’ Reply at \n2.  Although courts “must exclude from fee awards ‘hours that are excessive, redundant, or \notherwise unnecessary,’” Precision Concrete v. NLRB, 362 F.3d 847, 853 (D.C. Cir. 2004) \n(quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 443), the plaintiffs’ billing 700.3 attorney hours is “not facially \nunreasonable,” Hernandez, 257 F. Supp. 3d at 107, in the context of the instant case. \nThe defendants’ general complaint that the numbers of hours spent on different phases of \nthis litigation was facially unreasonable, is also unpersuasive.  See Blackman v. Dist. of \nColumbia, 56 F. Supp. 3d 19, 28 (D.D.C. 2014) (“The Court will not reduce the overall award \nsimply based on the [] general objection that the hours billed are excessive.”).  Specifically, the \ndefendants object to the 293.4 attorney hours spent on the complaint, 257.6 attorney hours spent \n“drafting the preliminary injunction,” 107.9 hours spent on the reply, and 29.3 hours spent \npreparing for oral argument.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 8–9.  In light of similar billings that other courts \nhave found reasonable, however, along with the complexity of this case, these objections are \nentirely misplaced.  See, e.g., Bennett v. Castro, 74 F. Supp. 3d 382, 403 (D.D.C. 2014) (finding \n11 \n \n\nreasonable 576 hours spent on “preliminary work”); Hernandez, 257 F. Supp. 3d at 107–08 \n(finding reasonable 255.8 hours spent on opposition to motion for summary judgment); Am. \nPetroleum Inst. v. EPA, 72 F.3d 907, 917 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (finding reasonable 80 hours of \npreparation for oral argument). \nThe defendants also specifically object to “forty-four entries totaling 51.7 hours for calls \nthat do not state the subject matter of the call,” as well as other entries that do not “include a \ndescription of the subject matter.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 6.  Although the entries the defendants cite, \nid., are not themselves particularly helpful, they do appear to align with more descriptive entries \nby other counsel for calls on those days.  For instance, the August 30, 2017, entry for “litigation \nteam call” for one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, Pls.’ Mot., Ex. H, Timesheets for Phillip Tegeler \nand Megan Haberle, ECF No. 35-10 at 4, matches the August 30, 2017, entry including “confer \nw/ case team re: witness interview, drafting progress” for another of the attorneys, Pls.’ Mot. Ex. \nE, Timesheets for Sasha Samberg-Champion, ECF No. 35-7 at 1.  The Court also relies on the \nrepresentation by the plaintiffs’ lead counsel that he “carefully reviewed each time entry and \ndescription for each attorney and staff member for whom fees are sought and ha[s] exercised \nbilling judgment to forego recovery of certain work so as to ensure that the fees requested are \nreasonable,” including with respect to “participants on conference calls.”  Pls.’ Decl. ¶¶ 23–24.  \nThe plaintiffs’ declaration, and the context provided by reading their five timesheets together, \neffectively counter the defendants’ vagueness complaints. \nFinally, the defendants’ concerns about excessive or duplicative billing are fully \naddressed by the “exercise of billing judgment” noted in the plaintiffs’ declaration, Pls.’ Decl. ¶ \n24, and by the plaintiffs’ ten percent cut from their initial total of 778.1 attorney hours to 700.3 \nattorney hours in their fees request, see Ashraf-Hassan v. Embassy of Fr. in the U.S., 189 F. \n12 \n \n\nSupp. 3d 48, 58 (D.D.C. 2016) (finding the hours billed reasonable where “in an effort to reduce \nthe fee amount, Plaintiff’s counsel regularly no charged duplicative or unnecessary time, \nreviewing the over five years of billing entries to delete or no charge additional entries with the \nbenefit of hind-sight” (alterations adopted) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nIn sum, the plaintiffs’ timesheets and declaration—taking into consideration the \ncomplexity and speed of this case, and bearing in mind that, in the pursuit of “rough justice” \nrather than “auditing perfection,” “trial courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-\neyeshade accountants,” Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 838 (2011)—demonstrate that the plaintiffs’ \nfee request is reasonable, and the defendants’ protestations to the contrary are unpersuasive. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, upon consideration of the plaintiffs Open \nCommunities Alliance, Crystal Carter, and Tiara Moore’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs, \nECF No. 35, the related legal memoranda in support of and opposition to this motion, the \nexhibits and affidavits attached thereto, and the entire record herein, it is hereby \nORDERED that the plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs is GRANTED; and \nit is further \nORDERED that the defendant pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in the amount of \n$154,272.11, by August 14, 2018, unless the parties reach an alternative mutually agreeable date. \n \nDate: June 15, 2018 \n__________________________ \nBERYL A.
