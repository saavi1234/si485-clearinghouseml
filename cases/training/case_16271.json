          "description": "ORDER by Hon. Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr. DENYING Dkt. No. [238] Defendants' Motion to Deny Class Certification. The Court notes that the briefing schedule noticed by Defendants is inconsistent with Dkt. No. [232], the schedule stipulated to by the parties and set by the Court on April 12, 2021, and unfair to the Plaintiffs as it purports to require an opposition within two weeks. The Court also finds that this is not the type of unusual case in which a preemptive motion to deny certification is appropriate, efficient or helpful. See Taylor v. Shutterfly, Inc., No. 18-CV-00266-BLF, 2020 WL 1307043, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 19, 2020) (explaining that motions to deny class certification are \"disfavored and may be denied as premature.\"). Plaintiffs are currently conducting discovery relating to class certification, and this case therefore presents a different procedural posture than Vinole v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 571 F.3d 935 (9th Cir. 2009), the case upon which Defendants rely, because the plaintiffs there admitted that they \"had conducted significant discovery and did not intend to propound any additional discovery seeking information from [defendant] regarding the propriety of class certification.\" Id. at 943. Even then, the Ninth Circuit explained that while a district court may consider a preemptive motion to deny class certification, \"the better and more advisable practice for a District Court to follow is to afford the litigants an opportunity to present evidence as to whether a class action was maintainable.\" Id. at 942. This is especially true here given Defendants' effort to preemptively foreclose hypothetical amendments to the complaint never sought by Plaintiffs, and their suggestion that they may later oppose certification on \"additional grounds.\" Dkt. No. 238 at 21 n.13. This denial is without prejudice to Defendants raising the same issues and arguments in their opposition to class certification. (This is a text-only entry generated by the court.

To the extent Defendants want the Court to consider these documents, and wish to have some or all of them redacted and/or sealed, they need to file an administrative motion to seal meeting the strict requirements of Local Rule 79-5. As suggested by the Court's order denying Defendants' request to \"amend\" an earlier sealing order (Dkt. No. 471), sealing is not done by \"category\": it requires an independent document-by-document showing. Defendants have until April 21, 2022, to file this additional motion to seal. All parties are reminded that supporting documents should be filed as attachments to a motion, not filed as separate docket entries. This Order terminates Dkt. No. [478].

Then, within two business days, the parties must confer again, at least by videoconference, to see if they can resolve their dispute. If not, they each have four to five lines for their final proposed compromises and must insert them into the letter brief. The moving party thereafter is responsible for filing the letter brief.

The court thus denies the discovery without prejudice to the plaintiffs' raising the issue in a formal motion following a meaningful meet-and-confer on the issues. Within five business days, the parties must engage in that meet-and-confer in person or by videoconference. Thereafter, in a motion noticed on the ordinary five-week calendar, the plaintiffs can move to compel, but they must be specific about what they want and why it is relevant to the litigation as it exists on the date that they file the motion.

This order extends only to the two recently terminated motions in favor of the letter-brief process and this dispute. The parties must confer in light of the cabined case and submit a joint letter brief with their updated positions. This is more efficient and faster than the motions process, and with the current litigation landscape, it is important to move the case along. The court expects the parties to meet and confer by any means and then at least by video conference. They cannot mail it in and must tell the court exactly how long the video conference lasted when they submit their letter briefs. (This is a text-only entry generated by the court. There is no document associated with this entry.)"

The court would benefit from the defendants' position on the motion for reconsideration. Ordinarily, the court would direct a joint letter because the assertion is that the context is different now. But in the interest of efficiency, the court will not require a joint letter and instead asks for the defendants' position by next Wednesday, June 5. The plaintiffs can file a two-page response by Thursday, June 6. If there are exhibits that require a chambers copy, they must be lodged in chambers by noon on Friday. The parties are reminded to use the word \"discovery\" when they file a discovery-related document on the docket. The usual method of flagging it (via the title \"Discovery Letter Brief\") was not followed. There also was no chambers copy, as required by the standing order, either to the proposed order box or by lodging the required chambers copy for a more voluminous filing. The court stumbled on the motion only because there was an administrative motion with a proposed order, which was lodged in the orders box.In any event, going forward, the court would appreciate it if the parties followed the rules.

Within 30 days from today, the parties must submit an estimate for the number of hours required by each side to try the injunctive relief claims of the certified subclasses. Within 1 week from today (by 8/8/2024), the parties shall submit (1) a stipulation and proposed order setting a briefing schedule for the summary judgment/dispositive motions that gives the Court as much time as possible to consider the motions by the hearing date; (2) a stipulation and proposed order setting a briefing schedule on Plaintiffs' anticipated motion to certify an issue for interlocutory appeal; and (3) a list of magistrate judges that the parties mutually find suitable for conducting a settlement conference in this case. Upon receipt of their joint list, the Court will make a referral. Additionally, the parties must meet and confer about how Plaintiffs should provide notice of the access barriers they plan to litigate at trial.

Similarly, the motion at 738-3 was filed just after the latest order by the trial court. The court previously allowed a full briefing primarily because the letter briefs were unhelpful but that calculus has changed given that the litigation has changed. Thus, the court terminates the pending motions in favor of the following process. The parties must confer about the current case (cabined to six facilities) and engage in the meet-and-confer required by the court's standing order. Then, they must file separate letter briefs by issue, but must employ this process: opening letter brief of two pages by moving party emailed to opposing counsel in Word; four days later, opposing party emails two pages back; two days later, moving party emails back reply of up to one page and files the letter brief under the normal process. For exhibits, each party is limited to twenty pages each absent order of the court. Chambers copies with tabbed exhibits must be lodged. The court will order fuller briefing after reviewing the letter briefs (This is a text-only entry generated by the court. There is no document associated with this entry.)

    "summary": "<p>On July 13, 2017, elderly and dependent residents with physical or cognitive impairments who lived in assisted living facilities, represented by private counsel, filed this putative class action lawsuit in the US District Court of the Northern District of California under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and California state law against the corporation that owned the facilities. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant's California facilities and services failed to meet accessibility and usability requirements of persons with disabilities. The plaintiffs also asserted that the California facilities are understaffed, which resulted in insufficient care and services.</p>\r\n<p>On August 25, 2017, the complaint was amended to include additional plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On September 28, 2017, the defendant filed motions to dismiss, strike, and compel arbitration. Among other things, the motions requested that the court (Judge James Donato) dismiss any claims against communities operated by the defendant in which the plaintiffs had never lived. The defendant also claimed that their residential communities were not covered under Title III of ADA, and thus the plaintiffs' claims failed as a matter of law. If not dismissed, the defendant requested language regarding the understaffing allegations be stricken as the understaffing did not suggest discrimination under ADA. The defendant sought that class allegations be stricken due to a lack of factual allegations, and alternatively sought limitations to the class definition. Additionally, the defendant sought compelled arbitration of various plaintiffs based on arbitration agreements signed by the plaintiffs or their legal representatives.</p>\r\n<p>On March 29, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The amended complaint limited the scope of the injunctions sought to residents with mobility or visual disabilities class, and to residents with disabilities class.</p>\r\n<p>On April 16, 2018, the case was reassigned to Judge Haywood Gilliam. On April 19, 2018, the defendants&rsquo; renewed their motion to compel arbitration and motioned to dismiss/strike portions of the plaintiffs&rsquo; amended complaint. On January 25, 2019, the court denied the defendants&rsquo; motion to compel arbitration, but partially granted their motion to dismiss, which compelled the plaintiffs to submit a third amended complaint on February 15, 2019 (ECF #90).</p>\r\n<p>On February 25, 2019, the defendants appealed Judge Gilliam's arbitration ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. They also moved to stay proceedings pending appeal, and moved to certify a question for interlocutory appeal on whether their facilities are considered public accommodations under the ADA. Judge Gilliam denied the motion to stay and denied certification of the question on June 5, 2019, finding that even though there was a controlling question of law, there was no substantial ground for difference of opinion and the interlocutory appeal would not materially advance litigation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 24, 2020, the court of appeals reversed in part, and affirmed in part the defendant's interlocutory appeal from February 25, 2019. The court affirmed denial of the defendant's motion to compel arbitration for two of the plaintiffs' ADA and state law claims, and reversed denial of the defendant's motion to compel arbitration for one of the plaintiff's state law claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For the next two years, the parties litigated discovery issues. Defendants preemptively moved to deny class certification on April 30, 2021, which the court denied on May 3, 2021, finding it unfair to the plaintiffs while discovery was occurring, especially as it foreclosed hypothetical amendments to the complaint the plaintiffs never sought. Plaintiffs moved for class certification on August 18, 2021. On March 3, 2022, defendants moved to deny class certification.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Given the large amount of discovery disputes raised by the parties, the court has yet to rule on class certification. On September 30, 2022, the defendants moved to stay discovery pending the class certification ruling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of December 2022.&nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiffs and the proposed Classes bring this action for declaratory and \n3  injunctive relief and damages to stop the unlawful and fraudulent practices of Brookdale Senior \n4  Living, Inc. and Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc. (“BROOKDALE” or \n5  “Defendants”). \n6  2.  Plaintiffs are elderly or dependent individuals living in California who have \n7  significant care needs and disabilities.  Plaintiffs and their families were overwhelmed by and \n8  required assistance with their activities of daily living including, but not limited to, assistance \n9  with managing and taking medication, housekeeping, laundry, dressing, bathing, toileting, \n10  hygiene, food preparation, and transportation.  Plaintiffs and their families and the classes they \n11  seek to represent either chose a BROOKDALE facility or chose to stay in a facility purchased by \n12  BROOKDALE because they believed BROOKDALE’s repeated promises to provide the care \n13  and assistance that would allow them to age with dignity.  Instead, Plaintiffs, their family \n14  members, and the proposed class members have all encountered in BROOKDALE a system of \n15  understaffed assisted living facilities that fails to consistently provide even the most basic level \n16  of promised care. \n17  3.  Defendant BROOKDALE has engaged in a policy and practice of violating Title \n18  III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., \n19  accompanying regulations, and the Unruh Civil Rights Act (“Unruh Act”), California Civil Code \n20  §§ 51 et seq.  Among other things, Defendant has violated the ADA by failing to make its \n21  assisted living facilities readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities even though \n22  both the ADA and the Unruh Act impose affirmative duties upon Defendants to make their \n23  assisted living facilities accessible.  As set forth below, Defendants have a policy and practice of \n24  leaving physical access barriers in place in their newly constructed, altered and/or existing \n25  facilities in violation of the ADA and the Unruh Act.  Defendants have failed to perform new \n26  construction and alterations in compliance with applicable federal and state disability access \n27  standards, including but not limited to the 1991 Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility \n28  Guidelines (“ADAAG”) and the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, and have failed to \n    1   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 3 of 100\n \n1  evaluate their newly constructed and/or altered assisted living facilities to identify and remediate \n2  non-compliant and inaccessible construction and alterations therein.  Defendants have also failed \n3  and refused to identify and remove physical access barriers from their existing assisted living \n4  facilities where such barrier removal was readily achievable within the meaning of the ADA.  As \n5  a result of Defendants’ corporate policies and practices regarding disability access, Defendants’ \n6  assisted living facilities are characterized by multiple, pervasive physical access barriers that \n7  limit or deny full and equal access to persons with disabilities. \n8  4.  Moreover, Defendant has failed to make reasonable modifications to its policies, \n9  practices and procedures that are necessary for persons with disabilities to have full and equal \n10  access to and enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities, privileges, advantages and \n11  accommodations provided by BROOKDALE’s facilities.  Defendants’ goods, services, \n12  facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations include providing assistance with \n13  activities of daily living (assistance with eating, housekeeping and laundry, bathing, grooming, \n14  dressing, toileting, personal hygiene, provision of nutritious meals), medication management \n15  (ordering and storage of medications, assistance taking medications), social and recreational \n16  activities (group exercise, games, movies, scenic drives, happy hours and social mixers, and \n17  assistance with arrangements for utilization of local resources), and transportation to and \n18  coordination of off-site services.  Plaintiffs have specifically requested that Defendant \n19  BROOKDALE make reasonable modifications to its staffing policies, practices and procedures \n20  for its assisted living facilities in order to ensure that there is staffing in sufficient numbers and \n21  with adequate training to provide timely and effective assistance and care to residents with \n22  disabilities.  Despite the fact that such modifications are necessary to ensure that residents with \n23  disabilities receive full and equal access to and enjoyment of Defendants’ goods, services, \n24  facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations, and despite the fact that such \n25  modifications will not result in any fundamental alteration to BROOKDALE’s public \n26  accommodations, Defendant has refused to do so. \n27  5.  In addition, Defendant has violated the ADA by failing and refusing to provide \n28  residents with mobility disabilities with full and equal access to and enjoyment of its \n    2   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 4 of 100\n \n1  transportation services.  Further, Defendant has discriminated against residents with disabilities \n2  by failing to provide them with an emergency evacuation plan that is designed for and \n3  reasonably calculated to ensure the prompt and effective evacuation of persons with disabilities \n4  in the event of emergency. \n5  6.  Defendant BROOKDALE has also engaged in a policy and practice of violating \n6  the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”), Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750 et seq., committing Elder \n7  Financial Abuse, Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30, and Unlawful, Unfair and Fraudulent \n8  Business Practices (“UCL”), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq.  Defendants promise to \n9  provide the elderly and disabled the “quality of life they’ve earned,” but Defendants instead \n10  engage in a scheme to defraud seniors, persons with disabilities, and their family members.  In \n11  order to induce the elderly and disabled to move into and stay at its California assisted living \n12  facilities, BROOKDALE makes misrepresentations and misleading statements and conceals \n13  material facts about the quality and availability of care available at BROOKDALE.  Reasonable \n14  consumers are misled to believe, and reasonably expect, that BROOKDALE determines each \n15  resident’s needs and staffs each facility accordingly to deliver personalized care to meet those \n16  needs.  Instead, BROOKDALE systemically understaffs its facilities, cuts caregiver hours, and \n17  fails to train workers, all to boost its profitability, while the residents in BROOKDALE’s care \n18  are forced to endure increasingly expensive monthly charges and worsening care.  The results of \n19  BROOKDALE’s callous and profit-driven approach are devastating: as multiple reports by state \n20  regulators confirm, residents are left without assistance for hours after falling, they are given the \n21  wrong medications, they are denied clean clothing, showers, and nutritious food, and they are \n22  left in their own waste for long periods of time. \n23  7.  On any given day, residents of BROOKDALE’s many California facilities live \n24  with a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for and that \n25  they need.  Scores of family and resident council meetings and hundreds of communications to \n26  BROOKDALE management have failed to rectify these problems, leaving Plaintiffs and the \n27  class no choice but to seek redress in this Court. \n28  8.  This lawsuit seeks to end this systemic discrimination against persons with \n    3   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 5 of 100\n \n1  disabilities by requiring Defendant to provide them with full and equal access to and enjoyment \n2  of BROOKDALE’s facilities, services, goods, privileges, advantages and accommodations.  \n3  This action seeks to require that Defendants staff their facilities with a sufficient number of \n4  adequately trained staff to ensure that residents with disabilities are provided with full and equal \n5  access to and enjoyment of the services specified in BROOKDALE’s own resident assessments.  \n6  In addition, this action seeks to require that Defendants provide assistive living facilities that are \n7  readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities as required by the ADA.  Further, \n8  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief requiring Defendants to provide full and equal access to and \n9  enjoyment of Defendants’ transportation services and activities.  Plaintiffs also seek injunctive \n10  relief requiring Defendants to provide adequate emergency planning and evacuation procedures \n11  for residents with disabilities.  With respect to the CLRA, the UCL and the Elder Financial \n12  Abuse statute, this action seeks to require Defendant to disclose to prospective and current \n13  residents, their family members or responsible parties, and the class that BROOKDALE’s \n14  existing staffing policies and procedures preclude it from providing its residents with all the care \n15  and services they have been promised and are paying for.  Further, this action seeks to enjoin \n16  BROOKDALE from charging residents or their responsible parties monthly fees based on their \n17  Personal Service Plans until BROOKDALE implements staffing policies and procedures that \n18  enable it to deliver those services on a consistent basis. \n19  9.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and, unless BROOKDALE is \n20  preliminarily and permanently enjoined, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm as a \n21  result of being denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s goods, \n22  services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory \n23  and injunctive relief and statutory and actual damages as set forth below against BROOKDALE \n24  for its policy and practice of denying Plaintiffs full and equal access to and enjoyment of its \n25  services and facilities and violating the ADA and its accompanying regulations, the Unruh Act, \n26  and the CLRA, for committing Elder Financial Abuse, and for engaging in Unlawful, Unfair and \n27  Fraudulent Business Practices.  Plaintiffs also seek recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs \n28  and litigation expenses under federal and state law. \n    4   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 6 of 100\n \n1  EXHAUSTION OF PRE-LAWSUIT PROCEDURES FOR STATE LAW CLAIMS \n2  10.  By letter dated June 2, 2017, Plaintiffs notified Defendants of Plaintiffs’ intent to \n3  file suit against it based on violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, as required by \n4  California Civil Code § 1782.  BROOKDALE received the letter on June 6, 2017.  More than 30 \n5  days have passed since BROOKDALE’s receipt, and BROOKDALE has not corrected or \n6  remedied the violations alleged in the notice and herein. \n7  11.  Though they were not required to do so, Plaintiffs also notified BROOKDALE of \n8  its multiple violations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1201 et \n9  seq., the Unruh Civil Rights Act, California’s elder financial abuse law, and California’s Unfair \n10  Competition Law. \nJURISDICTION \n11 \n12  12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to  \n13  28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3)-(4).  The Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et \n14  seq., presents federal questions and confers jurisdiction on this Court over Plaintiffs’ claims \n15  regardless of the amount in controversy.  This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction of this \n16  action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2)(A) because this is a class action in which the proposed \n17  class includes at least 100 members, the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000, exclusive of \n18  interests and costs, and at least one putative class member is a citizen of a state different from \n19  one of the defendants.  Plaintiffs seek damages in the amount of a minimum $9,000 per class \n20  member and believe that the class consists of over 5,000 persons, making the amount in \n21  controversy well in excess of $5,000,000.  BROOKDALE is a Delaware corporation with its \n22  principal place of business in Tennessee, making it a citizen of both Delaware and Tennessee, \n23  and each of the named Plaintiffs are citizens of the State of California.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n24  § 1367, this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ pendent claims under California \n25  law. \n26  13.  Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in this Court because Defendants \n27  have sufficient minimum contacts in California, or otherwise intentionally avail themselves of \n28  the California market through ownership and/or management of assisted living facilities located \n    5   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

Venue is proper in the Northern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n6  § 1391(b), because the acts upon which this action is based occurred in part in this District \n7  within the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Lake, Monterey, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, \n8  Santa Cruz, and Sonoma. \n9  15.  A substantial part of the events or omissions which gave rise to Plaintiffs’ claims \n10  arose in the County of Sonoma and thus, pursuant to Civil Local Rules 3-2(c) and (d), \n11  assignment to the San Francisco Division of the District Court for the Northern District of \n12  California is proper. \n13  THE PARTIES \n14  16.  Plaintiff STACIA STINER is a qualified person with disabilities within the \n15  meaning of the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act.  She is also a dependent adult pursuant to \n16  Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.23; a disabled person pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code § 1761(g); and \n17  a consumer pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code § 1761(d).  She needs assistance with the following \n18  activities of daily living: housekeeping, laundry, dressing, bathing, managing medications, \n19  toileting, and transportation.  She uses a wheelchair for mobility.  STACIA STINER has been a \n20  resident of BROOKDALE San Ramon since approximately February 2016.  She is a resident of \n21  Contra Costa County in the State of California. \n22  17.  Plaintiff HELEN CARLSON is a qualified person with disabilities within the \n23  meaning of the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act.  She is also an elder pursuant to Cal. \n24  Welf. & Inst.

Defendant BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING, INC. is a corporation organized \n22  under the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal place of business in Brentwood, \n23  Tennessee.  Defendant BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES, INC. is a \n24  corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal place of \n25  business in Brentwood, Tennessee.  BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING, INC. and BROOKDALE \n26  SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES, INC. will be referred to collectively as “BROOKDALE” \n27  or “Defendants.” BROOKDALE owns, manages, and/or operates approximately eighty-nine \n28  (89) assisted living facilities throughout California.

BROOKDALE’s operations are centralized, \n2  hierarchical and standardized, and all of BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities in California \n3  use the same uniform corporate policies, practices and procedures.  These corporate policies, \n4  practices and procedures control all aspects of the operations, staffing and staff training in its \n5  assisted living facilities.  All of BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities in California are \n6  required to follow the uniform policies, practices and procedures established by \n7  BROOKDALE’s corporate headquarters.    \n8  24.  BROOKDALE’s unlawful conduct as alleged herein has been widespread, \n9  repeated, and consistent at each of its locations.  The operations of BROOKDALE’s assisted \n10  living facilities in California are standardized, if not identical.  BROOKDALE’s conduct, as \n11  alleged herein, was and is part of a statewide plan, practice, course of conduct and scheme, and \n12  affects all of the residents of BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities. \n13  25.  Defendants DOES 1-100 are sued herein under fictitious names because Plaintiffs \n14  do not presently know their true names and capacities.  Plaintiffs will seek leave to amend this \n15  Complaint to allege their true names and capacities when such are discovered.  Plaintiffs allege \n16  that each of these Defendants was responsible in some capacity for the events alleged herein, or \n17  is a necessary party for obtaining appropriate relief.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and \n18  thereon allege that in carrying out each of the acts and violations alleged in this Complaint, each \n19  Defendant acted as an agent, principal, and/or representative for each other Defendant. \n20  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n21  26.  BROOKDALE is the largest provider of assisted living for senior citizens and \n22  persons with disabilities in the nation and has the largest number of assisted living facility \n23  residents within the state of California.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that there are \n24  more than 5,000 residents in Defendants’ eighty-nine facilities in California. \n25  27.  Assisted living facilities, also called Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly \n26  (“RCFEs”), offer room, board and daily assistance for seniors and persons with disabilities in \n27  certain activities of daily living (“ADLs”), such as preparing meals, shopping, transportation, \n28  preparing and taking medication, housekeeping, laundry, bathing, toileting, grooming, dressing, \n    10   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 12 of 100\n \n1  and others. \n2  28.  Assisted living facilities are intended to provide a level of care appropriate for \n3  those who are unable to live by themselves, but who do not have medical conditions requiring \n4  more extensive nursing care. \n5  29.  In recent years, BROOKDALE has increasingly been accepting and retaining \n6  more residents with conditions and care needs that were once handled almost exclusively in \n7  skilled nursing facilities.  This has allowed it to increase not only the potential resident pool but \n8  also the amounts of money charged to residents and/or their family members. \n9  30.  At BROOKDALE facilities, residents are charged a base rate, which includes \n10  room, board, basic maintenance, housekeeping, laundry, dining services, planned social and \n11  recreational programs, scheduled transportation services, staffing 24 hours a day, observation \n12  and consultation, and assistance with access to outside services.  BROOKDALE uses its resident \n13  assessment system to assess each resident before admission and then again periodically \n14  throughout residency and/or whenever there is a change of the resident’s condition.  By \n15  performing these assessments, BROOKDALE determines what additional services a resident \n16  needs, such as assistance with ADLs, and develops a Personal Service Plan for the resident.  \n17  Each additional need, or service, is assigned a monthly Personal Service Rate, which is added \n18  onto the resident’s base rate.  The more personal services determined by BROOKDALE to be \n19  needed by a resident, the more money BROOKDALE charges that resident. \n20  31.  Every month, BROOKDALE sends each resident or his or her responsible party \n21  an invoice for services that BROOKDALE represents it will provide in the following month.  \n22  These invoices reflect the monthly rate for the Basic Services set forth in BROOKDALE’s \n23  standard residency agreements, the Personal Service Rate that is based on each resident’s \n24  Personal Service Plan, and any adjustments.  On information and belief, these monthly invoices \n25  range from approximately $4,000 to $10,000 per person per month. \n26  32.  On information and belief, as of January 1, 2016, BROOKDALE increased the \n27  Basic Service Rate and Personal Service Rate for residents in its California facilities by roughly \n28  6%, and as of January 1, 2017, it raised these rates again by approximately 7%.  In standard \n    11   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

BROOKDALE has violated Title III of the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act \n10  by failing to provide full and equal access to its facilities and services.  Rooms occupied by \n11  persons with mobility disabilities and common areas at the BROOKDALE San Ramon, \n12  Windsor, Fountaingrove, Scotts Valley, and likely other facilities, do not meet federal or state \n13  accessibility standards.  Under Title III, fifty percent of the residential rooms in long-term care \n14  facilities must meet the requirements of the 1991 ADAAG or the 2010 ADA Standards.  \n15  BROOKDALE’s facilities do not meet these standards. \n16  34.  There is a pattern of physical access barriers in BROOKDALE facilities, as \n17  described below: \n18  a.  Wheelchair users are placed in rooms that do not have sufficient turning \n19  space in the bathrooms or the bedroom area.  This means that they often \n20  cannot even use their bathroom unless they are able to transfer out of their \n21  wheelchair and enter without it.  Those who can enter in their wheelchair \n22  usually do not have enough space to transfer safely onto the toilet or into \n23  the shower or to use the sink or vanity space.  Some residents have given up \n24  on using their inaccessible toilet and must rely on adult briefs and \n25  caregiving staff to clean them. \n26  b.  There is no clearance for wheelchairs under the sinks and/or the sinks are \n27  too high for a wheelchair user to reach them, preventing residents from \n28  using them. \n    12   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 14 of 100\n \n1  c.  The grab bars that do exist in the bathrooms are not compliant with \n2  applicable access standards, and there are no roll-in showers.  Both of these \n3  barriers are safety hazards, increasing the likelihood of falls.  They also \n4  prevent most persons with mobility disabilities from bathing as \n5  independently as possible.  Some wheelchair users have stopped using their \n6  showers altogether and instead take sponge baths, hardly an adequate \n7  substitute. \n8  d.  There are barriers to using the outdoor space for the residents’ rooms, \n9  including hard-to-open sliding doors, a lip at the threshold of the door, and \n10  insufficient space to accommodate a wheelchair.  This prevents persons \n11  with mobility disabilities from using their outdoor space as persons without \n12  disabilities can. \n13  e.  The closets do not have accessible hanging and storage space, in that they \n14  are placed out of the reach of a wheelchair user.  This prevents persons with \n15  mobility disabilities from accessing their clothing and other personal items, \n16  forcing them to rely on others for assistance. \n17  f.  Kitchen countertops and sinks are too high for a wheelchair user to access, \n18  preventing those residents from fully using their kitchens. \n19  g.  Heavy doors in common areas cannot be used independently by and pose a \n20  safety risk to many persons with disabilities. \n21  35.  These physical access barriers, which residents live with on a daily basis, prevent \n22  them from having full and equal access to their rooms as required by law. \n23  Understaffing \n24  36.  BROOKDALE does not schedule or provide sufficient numbers of trained staff to \n25  deliver promised services and meet the needs of its residents.  Plaintiffs allege on information \n26  and belief that BROOKDALE staffs its facilities based on predetermined labor budgets and \n27  desired profit margins.  Pursuant to Defendants’ corporate policies and procedures, the executive \n28  directors who manage individual BROOKDALE facilities must request permission from \n    13   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 15 of 100\n \n1  Defendants’ corporate headquarters to deviate from these pre-determined budgets.  Executive \n2  directors have a disincentive to request increased labor budgets for their facilities because they \n3  are not eligible for bonuses unless they meet earnings targets set by Defendants’ corporate \n4  headquarters.  As a result of Defendants’ corporate policies, practices and procedures \n5  BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities are inadequately staffed. \n6  37.  Reports issued by California Department of Social Services’ Community Care \n7  Licensing Division (“Community Care Licensing”), the state agency that regulates assisted \n8  living facilities, indicate that inadequate staffing pervades Defendants’ California facilities.  For \n9  instance, Community Care Licensing recently issued a citation to BROOKDALE Corona after a \n10  licensing inspector found “that there are not enough staff present” and observed five residents \n11  sitting unsupervised in the dining room and 19 residents in the activity room with only one staff \n12  member present.  In March 2017, Community Care Licensing cited a BROOKDALE facility in \n13  Santa Cruz County after a licensing inspector found that the facility did not have an adequate \n14  amount of staff to meet residents’ needs.  In June 2016, BROOKDALE Oceanside received a \n15  citation because it had only two caregivers on duty during daytime hours in the assisted living \n16  part of its facility. \n17  38.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that BROOKDALE uses pre-\n18  determined staffing schedules at its facilities and does not change these schedules or the number \n19  of staff hours worked when the facility has more residents or residents with greater needs.  \n20  Community Care Licensing records demonstrate the inadequacy of Defendants’ staffing to meet \n21  even the most basic needs of residents.  For instance, a personnel report that BROOKDALE \n22  filed with Community Care Licensing in February 2017 indicates that BROOKDALE \n23  Fountaingrove, a facility in Sonoma County, is understaffed for the night shift from 10:00 p.m. \n24  to 6:00 a.m.  That schedule lists only four resident caregivers assigned to the night shift, three of \n25  whom work only three days a week, with the result that in many instances there are as few as \n26  one resident caregiver on duty during the night shift to care for approximately 100 residents on \n27  three floors.  Moreover, the official numbers of caregivers on duty is often quite deceptive, as \n28  BROOKDALE frequently pulls caregivers from their responsibilities in order to perform other \n    14   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 16 of 100\n \n1  tasks, such as serving meals in the dining room. \n2  39.  As a direct result of Defendants’ discriminatory staffing practices, residents with \n3  disabilities have not received or run a substantial risk of not receiving the personal services, \n4  emergency and evacuation response, dining services, housekeeping and laundry services, \n5  transportation, and activities for which they are paying and that are necessary for full and equal \n6  enjoyment of Defendants’ goods, services, facilities, benefits, advantages and accommodations. \nImpact of Understaffing on Personal Services \n7 \n8  40.  The lack of sufficient numbers of trained staff at BROOKDALE means that \n9  residents with disabilities who need and pay for assistance with bathing, dressing, brushing their \n10  teeth, toileting, incontinence care, and other hygiene assistance do not receive it on a routine \n11  basis.  Scheduled showers are routinely skipped by staff who do not have time to bathe residents.  \n12  Staff often leave residents unattended on the toilet because another resident has activated their \n13  call pendant, and there is no one else available to respond.  Residents have been left on their bed \n14  undressed by staff called away to attend to other residents in need. \n15  41.  Residents who need assistance getting to the bathroom often wait for long periods \n16  of time for staff to respond to their call pendants.  Because they must wait so long for assistance, \n17  some residents have given up using the toilet altogether, instead relying on adult briefs and a \n18  caregiver to clean and change them when they have time.  Incontinent residents often wait for \n19  thirty minutes or more for a staff member to help them change out of soiled briefs, raising the \n20  risk of urinary tract infections and decubitus ulcers.  For example, an inspector from Community \n21  Care Licensing found in May 2016 that BROOKDALE San Pablo had insufficient staff to meet \n22  the residents’ needs, noting that “[i]ndividuals requiring incontinence care are not always \n23  changed in a timely manner.”  In November 2016, a licensing inspector found that even though a \n24  resident at BROOKDALE Cherry Hills was paying for regular incontinence checks, she was left \n25  lying on the floor for an extended amount of time after a fall because staff failed to check on her.  \n26  In March of 2017, a licensing inspector cited BROOKDALE Palm Springs for not providing a \n27  resident with those basic and personal care services—assistance with showering, dressing, \n28  transportation and medication—that the resident needed and for which the facility was being \n    15   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 17 of 100\n \n1  paid. \n2  42.  Insufficient staffing has also caused and continues to cause errors in medication \n3  administration, including providing the wrong dosage or the wrong medication, untimely or \n4  missed doses, and/or a failure to implement physicians’ orders.  Community Care Licensing has \n5  documented several recent examples from BROOKDALE’s Sonoma County facilities that \n6  illustrate the broader problem.  Community Care Licensing records show that the agency cited \n7  BROOKDALE Chanate five times on consecutive visits between October 28, 2015 and October \n8  13, 2016 for failing to give residents their prescribed medications.  At BROOKDALE Windsor, \n9  a resident recently received a double dose of medication because the nurse who administered the \n10  first dose failed to document that it had been given.  On a different occasion, staff gave a \n11  resident at BROOKDALE Windsor a medication that had been prescribed for a different \n12  resident.  Meanwhile, at BROOKDALE Rohnert Park, licensing inspectors found that staff were \n13  not properly trained on storing and administering residents’ medication, leading to a narcotic pill \n14  that went missing in August 2016 and staff’s failure to administer medications in October 2016.  \n15  Numerous other reports issued by Community Care Licensing confirm that problems with \n16  medication administration pervade Defendants’ facilities throughout California.  For example, \n17  Community Care Licensing cited BROOKDALE Palm Springs when 20 residents missed their \n18  medication doses on December 24, 2016 because there was no med tech on duty.  At \n19  BROOKDALE San Ramon, someone stole a number of residents’ medication from the facility \n20  during the overnight shift (“NOC SHIFT”) between July 9 and 10, 2017.  The facility did not \n21  inform all of the residents’ family members of the theft.  When one resident’s daughter-in-law, \n22  who learned about the theft from the resident, asked the facility’s acting Executive Director, \n23  Shawn Cull, which employees were on duty during the NOC shift, he told her that there were \n24  only two employees on duty to respond to all residents at the facility.  The facility has an \n25  occupancy of between approximately 70 to 80 residents.  Because no one was immediately \n26  available at the facility to pick up refills, at least one resident did not receive her pain medication \n27  until later that evening and was extremely anxious until that time.  Another resident’s family was \n28  not informed of the theft until almost 6 p.m., after the resident’s physician’s offices had closed \n    16   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 18 of 100\n \n1  and the family could not obtain a refill.  That resident was given an inadequate substitute pain \n2  medication in the evening, which was distressing to the resident and her family members, who \n3  had to reassure and calm her.  The following day, although BROOKDALE was notified that the \n4  refill was ready for pick-up at 10 a.m., the resident told her family that she did not receive her \n5  prescribed pain medication until 4 p.m. \n6  43.  BROOKDALE’s understaffing creates many dangerous situations for residents.  \n7  Among those are an increase in elopements from facilities by persons with cognitive \n8  impairments, because the facilities do not hire staff in sufficient numbers or with the training \n9  necessary to monitor residents and prevent escapes.  For example, BROOKDALE Oceanside \n10  was cited in April and September of 2016 for relying on delayed egress systems to compensate \n11  for insufficient staffing, resulting in resident elopements.  An informal conference was held by \n12  Community Care Licensing with BROOKDALE Oceanside management in December 2016 as a \n13  result of the elopements and other compliance failures.  Subsequently, on April 26, 2017, \n14  BROOKDALE staff failed to monitor residents on an outing, and one wandered away for \n15  approximately an hour. \n  Impact of Understaffing on Pendant Call Systems and Medical Emergencies \n16 \n17  44.  BROOKDALE’S failure to staff sufficiently results in caregivers’ inability to \n18  respond promptly to call pendants, if at all.  BROOKDALE has represented that residents who \n19  wear a call pendant, and pay a monthly fee for this service, may push a button to alert staff if \n20  they have an emergency, and staff will immediately respond to provide assistance.  Residents \n21  with disabilities rely heavily on these call pendants for assistance with basic tasks and activities \n22  of daily living, as well as for emergencies.  However, the call pendants do not notify staff of the \n23  resident’s location should they not be in their room.  In or about late 2016, a BROOKDALE San \n24  Ramon resident fell and hit his head on the pavement in the facility parking lot and pressed his \n25  pendant.  No one responded.  Bleeding profusely from his head, he used his mobile phone to call \n26  the front desk.  The son of another resident, a fire chief with emergency response training, found \n27  the resident in the parking lot just as BROOKDALE’s bookkeeper and maintenance director \n28  responded to the resident’s telephone call.  Because those employees have no caregiver or \n    17   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

The fire chief had to call \n2  911 and administer first aid while waiting. \n3  45.  Moreover, contrary to Defendants’ representations, staff do not immediately \n4  respond when residents use their call pendants.  For instance, in November 2016, a resident in \n5  the BROOKDALE Paso Robles facility pushed her emergency pendant after falling in her room \n6  and waited 22 hours on the floor with broken bones until staff finally found her.  That same \n7  month, a resident at the BROOKDALE Fountaingrove fell, injured her head, pressed her call \n8  pendant, and waited thirty minutes bleeding profusely from her head before staff arrived.  She \n9  died 10 days later.  In January 2017, a former resident of BROOKDALE Fountaingrove waited \n10  three hours for staff to respond to a call.  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of not \n11  maintaining its call pendant system properly and of not providing sufficient staff to respond to \n12  call pendants deprives residents with disabilities of full and equal enjoyment of its goods, \n13  services, facilities, and benefits. \n14  46.  Community Care Licensing records indicate lengthy emergency response times at \n15  Defendants’ facilities throughout California.  For example, in February 2017 a licensing \n16  inspector found that staff at BROOKDALE Riverside routinely took over 10 minutes to respond \n17  to emergency pendant calls, and on one occasion took 36 minutes to respond.  At \n18  BROOKDALE Orangevale, a licensing inspector tested an emergency call pendant during a \n19  January 2017 visit and found that it took over 45 minutes for facility staff to respond.  At \n20  BROOKDALE North Tarzana, a review of the facility’s records revealed numerous response \n21  times of over 30 minutes, including multiple response times of over an hour.  A licensing \n22  inspector who tested emergency pull cords at BROOKDALE Chatsworth found that it took staff \n23  24 minutes to respond during a June 2016 inspection; during another visit, the inspector found \n24  that it took staff 30 minutes to respond, and that they did so only after the inspector alerted the \n25  facility administrators.  At BROOKDALE Oceanside, an inspector found that as of April and \n26  May 2016, there were times when staff did not answer residents’ calls for 15 to 45 minutes.  The \n27  inspector’s report noted that there were only two direct caregivers on duty during the day and \n28  evening shifts at the facility, which has a capacity of 186 residents, and that those caregivers \n    18   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 20 of 100\n \n1  were responsible for numerous tasks in addition to answering emergency calls on two floors.  \n2  Community Care Licensing cited BROOKDALE Fountaingrove at the end of March 2017 after \n3  a review of the pendant system report revealed many instances of extremely lengthy response \n4  times, noting in particular a pendant pressed at 5:23 p.m. which was not answered for over 39 \n5  minutes and a pendant set off at 5:45 p.m. to which staff did not respond for one hour and 27 \n6  minutes. \n7  47.  Even when Defendants’ staff do respond within a reasonable amount of time to a \n8  request for assistance, the response is often inadequate.  In one case, staff at BROOKDALE \n9  Fountaingrove failed to notify a resident’s family after the resident had a fall and was sent to the \n10  emergency room.  Staff also failed to send identifying information or documents with the \n11  resident, as required by Defendants’ policies and procedures.  As a result, the resident was listed \n12  as a Jane Doe until the next morning.  A doctor at the hospital told the resident’s daughter that \n13  he would have operated on the resident shortly after she was admitted, but had to wait until the \n14  next morning because he had no family contact numbers to call.  The Community Care \n15  Licensing inspector who investigated this incident noted that she observed insufficient staffing at \n16  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove to ensure that the facility’s own policies and procedures were \n17  being followed.  On another occasion, a BROOKDALE Fountaingrove resident pressed the call \n18  button on her pendant because she could tell she was going to have terrible diarrhea.  While she \n19  waited for a response, the resident headed for the toilet, but by the time she got there, she had \n20  already soiled herself and her nightgown.  Although a caregiver responded to the pendant call, \n21  when the caregiver looked in the bathroom and saw the resident sitting on the toilet, she left \n22  without providing assistance and never returned.  The resident screamed for help and pressed the \n23  emergency button next to the toilet, but no one responded until roughly an hour later, when a \n24  new set of caregivers started their shifts. \n25  48.  Residents must resort to calling 911 for assistance when staff fail to promptly \n26  respond to their call pendants.  For example, public records kept by the Rincon Valley & \n27  Windsor Fire Protection Districts revealed that in a one-year period from June 2016 through \n28  May 2017, the agency responded to 83 emergency calls from 907 Adele Drive, the address of \n    19   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 21 of 100\n \n1  BROOKDALE Windsor.  Community Care Licensing records indicate that this facility has a \n2  capacity of 80, but often has fewer than 70 residents, suggesting that BROOKDALE Windsor \n3  residents averaged well over one 911 call per person over the past year.  Many of these calls \n4  were classified as “medical assists,” meaning the Rincon Valley & Windsor Fire Protection \n5  Districts provided assistance to another group or agency that had primary responsibility for \n6  medical care, such as assisting with moving a heavy patient.  Several of these 911 calls were \n7  classified as instances where a member of the public called the fire protection districts for \n8  routine help, such as assisting a person in returning to a bed or chair, with no transport or \n9  medical treatment given. \n10  49.  In other cases, Defendants’ staff failed to monitor residents’ health status as \n11  promised, placing residents in danger and distress in situations where the resident was not able \n12  to call for help.  At BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, one resident was left in her wheelchair all \n13  night because she requires staff assistance to get in and out of her wheelchair, but staff failed to \n14  help her into bed and never checked on her during the night.  In another case, a resident at \n15  BROOKDALE Scotts Valley fell in his apartment and went without food or water for 24 to 30 \n16  hours because staff failed to check on him.  The resident was taken to a hospital, where doctors \n17  diagnosed him with dehydration and rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which damaged skeletal \n18  muscle tissue breaks down and the damaged muscle cells are released into the bloodstream, \n19  causing further injury.  At BROOKDALE Riverside, a resident fell while outside and suffered \n20  severe sunburns because staff failed to regularly check on him.  In November 2016, Community \n21  Care Licensing issued a citation to BROOKDALE Hemet based on an incident in which staff \n22  left a resident with a known risk of falling unattended in a dining room chair.  The resident fell \n23  and hit his head, requiring ten stitches.  Just three days later, Defendants’ staff again left the \n24  resident unattended, and he fell and re-injured his head.  The licensing inspector noted that this \n25  resident had additional staff supervision as part of his care plan, but that BROOKDALE Hemet \n26  lacked sufficient staff to meet the resident’s needs. \n27  50.  Because Defendants’ staff are stretched so thin responding to emergency calls \n28  and attending to their other duties, they have attempted to dissuade residents from calling for \n    20   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 22 of 100\n \n1  assistance.  Residents have been told by overworked caregivers to use their call buttons “only in \n2  an emergency,” despite the fact that, short of screaming for help, this is the only way to alert \n3  caregivers that they need the assistance for which they are paying BROOKDALE.  In many \n4  instances, residents feel bad for overworked caregivers and attempt to perform tasks on their \n5  own, despite paying BROOKDALE for these services.  This has led to residents’ falling or \n6  otherwise injuring themselves. \n  Impact of Understaffing on Dining Services \n7 \n8  51.  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing has resulted in its cutting \n9  staffing hours and eliminating positions in dining services.  As a result, residents wait for long \n10  periods of time to be served.  Some residents give up in frustration.  Food is often served cold, \n11  and residents do not dare to make a special request, for fear that the wait will be extreme.  \n12  Moreover, the quality of the food has so deteriorated that it is in many cases nearly inedible.  \n13  Fresh ingredients are rare, meat of poor quality is hidden under sauces, and both residents and \n14  licensing inspectors have encountered food beyond its expiration date.  The understaffing also \n15  prevents staff from maintaining a clean and hygienic dining area. \n16  52.  At BROOKDALE San Ramon, the hours of serving staff were cut, and servers \n17  have left as a result, leaving the dining department severely understaffed.  At breakfast, there is \n18  often one server for 80 people.  On at least one day during June 2017, there were no servers in \n19  the dining room for breakfast, and the activities director was cleaning the tables while the chef \n20  both cooked and served meals.  At BROOKDALE Windsor, licensing inspectors found a single \n21  staff member working morning shifts in the dining room, with dirty dishes and food droppings \n22  strewn about because no other staff members were available to clean up.  BROOKDALE \n23  Riverside received a Community Care Licensing citation after investigators found that food was \n24  served cold and residents had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for food to be served.  The \n25  investigator attributed this problem to understaffing, noting in her report that “[i]t was revealed \n26  there is not enough servers for the number of residents in the dining room at one time.”  On a \n27  recent visit to BROOKDALE Corona, the licensing inspector found five residents sitting in the \n28  dining room without supervision, and noted that caregivers were expected to serve lunch, clean \n    21   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 23 of 100\n \n1  the dining room after meals, and sweep the floors in the dining room in addition to their other \n2  duties.  The same inspector found uncovered and dried-out ham and cheese sandwiches in the \n3  refrigerator and unrefrigerated cartons of strawberry milk in a cupboard. \n4  53.  The long waits and substandard meals in the dining room mean that some \n5  residents either purchase their own food or often forgo meals altogether, despite the fact that \n6  residents are paying BROOKDALE for three meals per day and snacks.  Residents’ nutrition \n7  needs are not being met, and to the extent that they look forward to meals as a pleasant social \n8  experience, they are being deprived of that benefit as well.  Residents have made numerous \n9  complaints to Defendants about the dining service, individually and through the family and \n10  resident councils.  For example, the Resident Council at BROOKDALE San Ramon has been \n11  complaining about the problems in dining services for over two years.  Yet residents have seen \n12  no durable improvements. There may be temporary improvements from time to time, but the \n13  overall trend is actually downward. \n  Impact of Understaffing on Housekeeping and Laundry \n14 \n15  54.  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing extends to housekeeping \n16  and laundry services.  For example, on information and belief, BROOKDALE San Ramon went \n17  for many months with only one housekeeper to clean approximately 80 rooms.  As a result, the \n18  maintenance director and the executive director also had to clean rooms and consequently had \n19  less time to perform maintenance and administrative duties.  Residents’ rooms have been left in \n20  deplorable and often unsanitary conditions, including toilet seats and showers covered in feces \n21  and rooms which smell strongly of urine. \n22  55.  BROOKDALE routinely fails to wash residents’ personal belongings and bed \n23  linens.  Even when BROOKDALE’s staff take these items for laundering, residents’ clothes and \n24  linens are often lost, or they are given back other residents’ clothing or linen instead of their \n25  own.  Residents are left in dirty and malodorous clothing.  For example, Loresia Vallette, the \n26  granddaughter of former BROOKDALE Hemet resident LAWRENCE QUINLAN observed that \n27  her grandfather’s clothes were never washed, and that staff continued to dress him in the same \n28  pair of urine-stained pants.  Some residents or their family members have despaired of waiting \n    22   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 24 of 100\n \n1  and begun to perform these services on their own, despite BROOKDALE’s promise to provide \n2  them as part of their base rate. \nDiscrimination in Transportation/Activities \n3 \n4  56.  Due to chronic understaffing at Defendants’ facilities, promised transportation \n5  services and activities are often sporadic or nonexistent.  Many residents rely on BROOKDALE \n6  for transportation to medical and lab appointments, church, grocery shopping, banking and other \n7  activities.  Additionally, they expected and would enjoy both on- and off-site activities.  Yet they \n8  do not receive these services on a regular basis, if at all.  Scheduled activities—such as poker, \n9  bingo and movies—are frequently cancelled, and BROOKDALE regularly fails to provide the \n10  promised transportation services to its residents.  Residents are often told about cancellations at \n11  the last minute for shuttles to planned events, such as church services.  The lack of staffing at \n12  BROOKDALE San Ramon means that its activities director must fulfill multiple duties.  In \n13  addition to her expected duties, she often works in the dining room serving food or cleaning and \n14  at the front desk as a receptionist.  She is frequently the only driver for facility-provided \n15  transportation.  On several occasions, residents of BROOKDALE San Ramon have been left \n16  waiting outside a medical office or a church because BROOKDALE staff forgot to pick them up \n17  and had to rely on others to take them back to the facility. \n18  57.  Additionally, BROOKDALE has implemented policies and practices regarding \n19  its provision of transportation services that discriminate against persons with mobility \n20  disabilities.  Residents at BROOKDALE San Ramon who use wheelchairs must be able to \n21  transfer from their chairs to a seat in the bus, despite the existence of a wheelchair lift and a \n22  system for securing wheelchairs in at least one of BROOKDALE San Ramon’s buses.  Making \n23  this transfer is impossible and/or unsafe for many wheelchair users.  The facility also requires \n24  wheelchair users to arrange for a family member or an outside care attendant to accompany them \n25  on any off-site activity, which deters many wheelchair users from participating and imposes a \n26  surcharge on those who do.  The facility also limits the number of wheelchair users for each off-\n27  site trip to two.  At BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, wheelchair users are limited to two off-site \n28  trips per month.  At least one wheelchair user at BROOKDALE San Ramon was told that she \n    23   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

BROOKDALE has emergency and evacuation policies and procedures in place \n5  for at least some of its facilities, but these policies and procedures do not take into account the \n6  needs of persons with disabilities, or if they do, Defendants have not informed the residents.  \n7  Residents with disabilities have been told to wait in their rooms for someone to come, and \n8  although the facilities have emergency drills, staff have not demonstrated for residents what will \n9  happen in the event of an actual emergency. \n10  59.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that these practices \n11  have been and are an official policy and practice by which Defendants operate their businesses \n12  and/or services. \n13  60.  Defendants’ failure and refusal to provide equal services to persons with \n14  disabilities is humiliating and degrading to and creates a serious safety risk for the members of \n15  the proposed class of persons with disabilities. \n16  61.  Defendants are responsible for their illegal operations and discriminatory policies \n17  and practices as described herein.  BROOKDALE residents, their family members, and staff \n18  members have raised these issues repeatedly with members of BROOKDALE management to \n19  no avail.   \n20  62.  Defendants have been notified of the civil rights violations described herein, but \n21  have refused to provide necessary reasonable modifications to its staffing policies, practices and \n22  procedures to provide residents with disabilities full and equal enjoyment of their goods, \n23  services, facilities, activities, benefits and accommodations and to comply with the requirements \n24  of the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act .  \n25    Retaliation Against Family and Resident Councils and Their Members   \n26  63.  Plaintiff filed their original complaint on July 13, 2017.  They filed a First \n27  Amended Complaint on August 25, 2017.  Since that time, BROOKDALE has retaliated against \n28  Plaintiffs and members of the family or resident council in at least two of the facilities in which \n    24   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 26 of 100\n \n1  the named Plaintiffs reside. \n2  64.  Pursuant to Cal. Health & Safety Code § 1569.158(a), residential care facilities \n3  may not prohibit the formation of a family council.  California law also requires that the facility \n4  provide a meeting space for the family council, as well as a prominent, visible space for family \n5  council announcements, such as meeting notices, minutes, and newsletters.  Cal. H&S Code § \n6  1569.158(d).  Moreover, a facility must respond in writing to any written concerns or \n7  recommendations submitted by the family council within 14 days. Cal. H&S Code § \n8  1569.158(f). \n9  65.  California law also prohibits assisted living facilities from willfully interfering \n10  with the “formation, maintenance, or promotion of a family council.”  Cal. H&S Code § \n11  1569.158(i).  The law defines “willful interference” as including “discrimination or retaliation in \n12  any way against an individual as a result of his or her participation in a family council, refusal to \n13  publicize family council meetings or provide appropriate space for meetings or postings as \n14  required . . ., or failure to respond to written requests by a family council in a timely manner.  \n15  Cal. H&S Code § 1569.158(i).   \n16  66.  At the BROOKDALE San Ramon facility, the executive director has stopped \n17  responding to many of the written inquiries from the family council. On July 26, 2017, the \n18  executive director of BROOKDALE San Ramon, Shawn Cull, informed the family council by \n19  email that he would not respond to the family council’s inquiries because of the lawsuit.  Despite \n20  a letter from Plaintiffs’ counsel to BROOKDALE’s counsel on August 17, 2017, informing \n21  them of Brookdale’s obligations under the Health & Safety Code, the executive director has \n22  continued to refuse to provide substantive responses to many of the family council’s inquiries.  \n23  On February 2, 2018, Mr. Cull responded to a request by family council and residents that he \n24  address all of their questions by stating, “Unfortunately, due to a lawsuit, some questions I am \n25  unable to answer.”   \n26  67.  On or about February 2, 2018, a family council board member, Sharon Eidler, \n27  posted family council flyers announcing an upcoming meeting in public announcement spots \n28  near the facility elevators and on the residents’ doors.  Two hours later, she discovered that \n    25   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

The flyers posted on the resident \n2  doors had been turned over and covered with a facility questionnaire.  When questioned by Ms. \n3  Eidler, Mr. Cull admitted to tampering with the flyers.  When Ms. Eidler told Mr. Cull he could \n4  not tamper with family council announcements, Mr. Cull ordered Ms. Eidler to leave the facility \n5  and then called the police to come and remove her.  After arriving at the facility and speaking \n6  with witnesses, the police neither arrested Ms. Eidler nor did they ask her to leave the facility. \n7  68.  Pursuant to Cal. Health & Safety Code § 1569.157(a), residential care facilities \n8  must assist the residents in establishing and maintaining a resident council.  Moreover, a facility \n9  must respond in writing to any written concerns or recommendations submitted by the resident \n10  council within 14 days. Cal. H&S Code § 1569.157(c). \n11  69.  California law also prohibits assisted living facilities from willfully interfering \n12  with the “formation, maintenance, or promotion of a resident council.”  Cal. H&S Code § \n13  1569.157(g).  The law defines “willful interference” as including “discrimination or retaliation \n14  in any way against an individual as a result of his or her participation in a resident council, \n15  refusal to publicize resident council meetings or provide appropriate space for either meetings or \n16  a bulletin board, or failure to respond to written requests by the resident council in a timely \n17  manner.”  Cal. H&S Code § 1569.157(g).   \n18  70.  BROOKDALE has not responded in writing to at least four letters sent to its \n19  corporate offices by Ms. JESTRABEK-HART in her capacity as chair of the BROOKDALE \n20  Scotts Valley residents’ council.  The letters addressed the lack of adequate staffing, facility \n21  maintenance concerns, the lack of emergency signals in the laundry rooms, common room doors \n22  that are difficult to open, and the high price of meals for visitors.  The executive director at the \n23  Scotts Valley facility responded to one of the letters orally, but BROOKDALE has not \n24  responded in writing to any of the above-mentioned letters, in violation of Cal. H&S Code§ \n25  1569.157(c) and (g) . \n26   \n27 \n28 \n    26   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 28 of 100\n \nBROOKDALE MISREPRESENTS, MAKES MISLEADING STATEMENTS, AND \n1  CONCEALS MATERIAL FACTS ABOUT THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF \nCARE IT PROVIDES TO ALL RESIDENTS \n2 \n3  71.  As a result of Defendants’ corporate policies and practices, BROOKDALE \n4  subjects all residents, regardless of disability, to a substantial risk that they will not receive the \n5  care and services they require and have paid for on any given day, as described in Paragraphs \n6  36-60.  BROOKDALE lures residents to move into or stay at its facilities by misrepresenting in \n7  various corporate written materials that it will provide the basic, personal, and therapeutic \n8  services each resident needs based on individualized assessments performed by BROOKDALE \n9  staff, and by failing to disclose and concealing that it cannot provide the promised services to all \n10  residents because its facilities are chronically understaffed. \n \n11  Standardized Residency Agreements \n12  72.  In order to move in to one of BROOKDALE’s California facilities, residents \n13  must sign one of Defendants’ standardized Residency Agreements.  In its standardized \n14  Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE represents to residents prior to move-in and throughout \n15  their residency that it will provide them with a standard set of basic services, additional personal \n16  services identified in the Personal Service Plan, and any select and therapeutic services for \n17  which the resident chooses to pay.  At the time of signing the Residency Agreement, residents or \n18  their responsible parties are required to confirm that they have reviewed and understand the \n19  document. \n20  73.  In Section I.A of its standardized Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE \n21  affirmatively represents to prospective residents that “[i]n order to provide you with care, \n22  supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet your \n23  needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services”: accommodations, including a \n24  residential suite and use of common areas; three meals a day plus snacks 24 hours a day; basic \n25  utilities; “light housekeeping once a week”; weekly laundry service of the resident’s “personal \n26  belongings and bed linens”; “planned social and recreational programs”; transportation services; \n27  and staffing by “Community associates … available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.”  \n28  Section I.A further represents that BROOKDALE will observe the resident’s “health status to \n    27   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

In Section I.B of its standardized Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE \n6  represents that “[p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use a \n7  personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  The personal \n8  service assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.”   \n9  75.  Defendants’ standardized price schedule for personal care services is attached to \n10  the standardized Residency Agreement.  This price schedule includes a variety of personal \n11  services, such as staff assistance with ordering, storing, and taking medication; staff assistance \n12  with eating, dressing, bathing, using the toilet, and other activities of daily living; escort and \n13  mobility assistance to get around Defendants’ facilities; and help taking care of residents’ pets.  \n14  This price schedule lists the monthly costs of each service and details how Defendants’ \n15  caregivers and other staff will provide the services.  For instance, a resident may require and \n16  agree to pay for “[s]taff attention while you administer your insulin injections”; “additional staff \n17  involvement” for residents who are reluctant to accept care; and bathroom assistance such as \n18  “reminders to get to the bathroom,” “pulling up and down pants, handling toilet paper, wiping, \n19  changing protective undergarments and getting onto and off of toilet,” as well as “weight-\n20  bearing or balance assistance from one associate” for residents “unable to stand independently \n21  while using the bathroom.” \n22  76.  BROOKDALE repeats these representations in the Personal Service Plan that it \n23  prepares for each resident before the resident moves in and updates periodically throughout his \n24  or her residency.  The Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff assistance that the resident \n25  requires and has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each.  For example, the \n26  Personal Service Plan for one former resident states that Defendants’ staff will “[p]rovide \n27  physical assistance to and from the dining room and/or community activities as needed” for a \n28  monthly fee of $273.  Standardized language in the Personal Service Plan states that “[t]he \n    28   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 30 of 100\n \n1  Personal Service Assessment and the Physician Plan of Care are used to determine the personal \n2  services that you require at move-in and periodically throughout your residency.  The Personal \n3  Service Assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.” \n4  77.  Pursuant to Sections I.B and III.F of its standardized Residency Agreement, \n5  “[t]he results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your personal care needs, and the cost \n6  of providing the additional personal services (the ‘Personal Service Rate’) will be shared with \n7  you,” and a change in the Personal Service Plan be offered or required “when we determine \n8  additional services are requested or required” and after 60 days’ written notice has been \n9  provided. \n10  78.  In Section I.C of its standardized Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE \n11  represents that it will make “Select Services and Therapeutic Services … available to you at \n12  your request,” but that the fees for these services are not included in the rates residents pay for \n13  basic services and personal services.  Defendants’ standardized Residency Agreement \n14  incorporates by reference a standardized price list which features prices for the select and \n15  therapeutic services that Defendants make available, many of which consist of staff assistance \n16  with the resident’s activities of daily living.  For example, residents may elect to pay for tray \n17  service in their rooms for up to three meals a day or for additional laundry and housekeeping \n18  services beyond what is provided in the basic service rate. \n19  79.  Every month, BROOKDALE sends each resident or his or her responsible party \n20  an invoice for services that the company represents it will provide the following month.  These \n21  invoices list the monthly rate for basic services, the Personal Service Rate that is based on each \n22  resident’s Personal Service Plan, and any rate adjustments. \n23  80.  BROOKDALE repeats these representations in the letters it periodically sends all \n24  residents informing them of increases in the rates they owe for basic services, personal services, \n25  and select and therapeutic services.  Using standardized language, Defendants’ rate increase \n26  letters notify the resident of changes to his or her monthly rates for these services, which \n27  BROOKDALE attributes to increases in the cost of “providing the services you desire and \n28  depend upon.” \n    29   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 31 of 100\n \nDefendants’ Communications Regarding the Merger and New Assessment System \n1 \n2  81.  In early 2014, Emeritus Senior Living (“Emeritus”), at the time a major chain of \n3  senior living facilities, sent residents a standardized letter informing them of the merger between \n4  BROOKDALE and Emeritus.  The letter promised that residents would not be impacted by the \n5  change but would “receive the same excellent care and service you expect at your community” \n6  and would “continue to enjoy all the amenities of your community.”  It further stated the merger \n7  would create a “senior living company offering the most comprehensive set of senior care \n8  solutions” with a commitment to “customer-focused cultures and a commitment to continuous \n9  improvement and innovation.”  Rather than inform residents that the merger would result in \n10  even lower staffing levels and poorly trained staff, the letter promised a continuum of care with \n11  likely improvements. \n12  82.  In or about October 2015, BROOKDALE sent residents a standardized letter \n13  informing them of an upgrade to its community assessment and care planning system effective \n14  December 1, 2015.  The upgrade would involve a conversion to a “new personal service system” \n15  which would “enhance our ability to match your needs and preferences with the right services at \n16  the right time.”  The letter promised “benefits from enhancements,” which included, inter alia, \n17  “[p]ersonalized service planning and care systems.” \n18  83.  Based on these representations, Plaintiffs, and the putative class members \n19  reasonably expected that the merger would result in improvements in care, or at the very least, \n20  would not result in a decline in services.  Additionally, they reasonably expected that the \n21  conversion to the new assessment and care planning system would result in improved delivery of \n22  basic services, personal services, and select and therapeutic services for which they were paying. \n23  Defendants’ Marketing Materials \n24  84.  Defendants’ public website, www.brookdale.com, prominently features online \n25  marketing materials directed at prospective residents.  In a section of its website entitled “What \n26  is Assisted Living?”, BROOKDALE claims that its “assisted living communities have staff and \n27  programs in place that support and assist residents with daily living and basic care in a homelike \n28  or apartment setting.  Residents receive three meals a day, recreational and social activities, \n    30   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 32 of 100\n \n1  housekeeping, linen service, apartment maintenance and transportation.  That means your loved \n2  one gets all the benefits of retired life, without the hassle of daily chores.” \n3  85.  Defendants’ online marketing materials also tout the personalized services that its \n4  assisted living facilities provide.  The company’s website explains that “[o]ur trained caregivers \n5  provide attention and assistance with medication support, bathing, dressing, cooking and other \n6  tasks throughout the day.  Our staff will also coordinate services with outside healthcare \n7  providers and monitor residents to ensure they are healthy.  So your loved one gets the care they \n8  need while enjoying the quality of life they’ve earned.” \n9  86.  Defendants’ online marketing materials promise a “Culinary Arts” program that \n10  uses “only the freshest meat, seafood, produce, herbs and spices.” \n11  87.  Defendants’ online marketing materials further represent that “[a]t Brookdale, we \n12  believe in delivering senior care that’s tailored to you and your loved one based on those unique \n13  needs and desires.  That’s why we provide a variety of options.  This personalized approach \n14  ensures that you and your family get exactly what you need without paying for what you don’t.” \n15  88.  BROOKDALE represents to prospective and current residents that it tailors its \n16  services to residents’ personal needs.  According to Defendants’ representations, the process \n17  begins with an individualized assessment, which BROOKDALE uses to produce a Personal \n18  Service Plan for each resident.  The Personal Service Plan includes a list of services for which \n19  the resident pays a monthly fee.  Defendants’ affirmative representations give rise to a \n20  reasonable expectation on the part of the reasonable consumer that BROOKDALE will \n21  determine and then provide the amount of caregiver and other staff time that is necessary to \n22  provide the personal services for which residents are paying. \n23  89.  BROOKDALE makes similar representations in the standardized marketing \n24  folder it distributes to prospective and incoming residents.  In this marketing folder, \n25  BROOKDALE represents that at its facilities, “Carefully selected and trained associates do more \n26  than assist with activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing and dispensing of \n27  medications; they implement custom care plans designed to meet the individual needs of each \n28  resident … It all begins with a Personal Service Assessment.  We take the time to listen to our \n    31   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 33 of 100\n \n1  residents so that we understand how to establish clinical, dining and program support that works \n2  for them in a meaningful way.  We recognize their individual needs and preferences and respond \n3  to them accordingly.  So, whether it’s a scented lotion, a unique snack, a favorite recipe or a \n4  lifelong interest, we integrate everything we learn to create a truly individualized living \n5  experience.”  Elsewhere in this marketing folder, BROOKDALE represents that it “provide[s] \n6  customized care solutions to meet residents’ unique needs and complement their vision for all \n7  the places they would still like their lives to go.  From our trained staff to our wide variety of \n8  amenities and activities, we strive to offer personalized care and exceptional service at \n9  competitive and affordable rates.  Fees for care and services are based on each resident’s needs \n10  and preferences, as determined by the Living Accommodation selected and their Personal \n11  Service Plan … This provides customer value because our residents only pay for what they \n12  need and want.” (Emphasis in original).  BROOKDALE’s marketing folder also promises an \n13  industry-leading dining services program that “continue[s] to satisfy the preferences and \n14  nutritional needs of residents with dining choices that offer mealtime fulfillment while meeting \n15  dietary requirements.” \n16  90.  Based on all of Defendants’ representations, Plaintiffs, the putative class \n17  members, and the general consuming public reasonably expect that BROOKDALE will ensure \n18  adequate staffing to perform the services promised to residents, including by providing sufficient \n19  levels of qualified and adequately trained staff to perform the services identified in each \n20  resident’s Personal Service Plan. \n21  Defendants’ Failures to Disclose \n22  91.  Contrary to Defendants’ representations regarding its provision of services, \n23  BROOKDALE has a corporate policy and practice of staffing its facilities according to a system \n24  that ensures all BROOKDALE residents run the continuing risk of not receiving the services for \n25  which they are paying, of not having their care needs met, and of suffering injury from the lack \n26  of care. \n27  92.  In addition to the Community Care Licensing records described in Paragraphs 37-\n28  38, 41-43, 46-49 and 52, current and former residents of BROOKDALE facilities confirm that \n    32   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 34 of 100\n \n1  Defendants’ staffing levels do not change when updates to personal service assessments show \n2  that residents require additional personal services.  BROOKDALE has in many cases modified \n3  residents’ Personal Service Plans—and raised monthly personal service fees accordingly—even \n4  though BROOKDALE failed to conduct an updated personal service assessment, failed to \n5  provide residents or their responsible parties with the results and method of the assessment, \n6  and/or failed to provide 60 days’ written notice.  Despite paying higher fees as a result of these \n7  changes to their Personal Service Plans, residents and their families have observed that neither \n8  the services provided nor staffing levels increased and, in many cases, decreased. \n9  93.  Caregivers have informed residents that they would like to work a 40-hour week, \n10  but BROOKDALE allows certain caregivers to work only 24 hours in a week.  Residents and \n11  their family members have also observed that BROOKDALE fails to ensure that all staff \n12  members receive necessary training.  At BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, the facility’s interim \n13  executive director admitted to residents’ families that BROOKDALE has insufficient staff to \n14  meet residents’ needs. \n15   \nBROOKDALE’S MISREPRESENTATIONS AND  \n16  CONCEALED FACTS WERE MATERIAL \n \n17 \n18  94.  BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations and the facts it conceals are material to the \n19  reasonable consumer.  An important and significant factor in choosing to move oneself or one’s \n20  relative to a BROOKDALE facility, to stay there after the facility was purchased by \n21  BROOKDALE, and/or to continue to agree to pay the amounts charged by BROOKDALE is the \n22  provision of staffing that is necessary to provide the services its residents need and for which the \n23  residents are paying. \n24  95.  BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements and omissions \n25  regarding its provision of staffing are material to prospective residents and their family \n26  members.  Assurances that a facility will provide the amount of staffing necessary to provide \n27  basic services and meet the personal service needs of residents based on BROOKDALE’s own \n28  assessments is a substantial factor (and indeed often the most important factor) in deciding to \n    33   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 35 of 100\n \n1  enter a certain facility.  The named Plaintiffs would not have, and the members of the putative \n2  class would in all reasonable probability not have, entered BROOKDALE’s facilities or stayed \n3  at these facilities after BROOKDALE purchased them from other companies, or they would \n4  have insisted on paying a lower price, if they had known that, although BROOKDALE would \n5  charge them based on the staffing associated with their Personal Service Plans, BROOKDALE \n6  did not and does not provide adequate staffing to carry out the services identified in residents’ \n7  Personal Service Plans, nor does it provide adequate staffing to perform basic services and select \n8  and therapeutic services. \n9  96.  This is true even for residents who currently are nearly independent.  These \n10  residents chose an assisted living facility as opposed to an independent living community or \n11  remaining at home because they wish to “age in place.”  They may not need significant \n12  assistance with the activities of daily living initially, but they will become more dependent as \n13  they age and do not want to move again when that happens.  Moreover, even the most \n14  independent residents depend on the basic services that BROOKDALE promised them, such as \n15  food, laundry, and housekeeping.  A key factor for these residents in selecting BROOKDALE is \n16  that the facility will provide the staffing that BROOKDALE itself has determined is necessary to \n17  meet their assessed needs, both now and as those needs increase. \n18  97.  BROOKDALE has a duty to disclose that its staffing policies and procedures \n19  preclude it from consistently providing basic services, personal services, and select and \n20  therapeutic services, because of, among other things, the substantial safety risk to current and \n21  future residents from BROOKDALE’s conduct. \n22  98.  The non-disclosure is material because, among other things, BROOKDALE \n23  knows that its conduct risks the safety of its residents.  In addition to individual complaints made \n24  by residents and family members, family and resident councils send regular correspondence to \n25  Executive Directors of BROOKDALE facilities, as well as regional and national mangers \n26  regarding the problems outlined above.  In the case of BROOKDALE San Ramon and \n27  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, local and regional management employees have attended \n28  numerous meetings of the Family and Resident Councils and have made unfulfilled promises to \n    34   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 36 of 100\n \n1  address the concerns outlined above.  Moreover, Community Care Licensing has conducted \n2  numerous licensing inspections which are delivered to BROOKDALE executives and managers \n3  of California facilities, describing the failure of various facilities to meet state laws and \n4  regulations. \n5  99.  BROOKDALE is fully aware of the facts alleged above.  Yet, BROOKDALE has \n6  failed to disclose and actively concealed from residents, prospective residents and their family \n7  members the true facts about how staffing is provided at BROOKDALE’s California facilities. \n8  Barriers to Moving Out \n9  100.  BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements, and material \n10  omissions affect not only the decision of residents to enter the facility but also the decision to \n11  stay at a BROOKDALE facility. \n12  101.  In choosing assisted living in general and a BROOKDALE facility in particular, \n13  the resident forgoes other options such as their former home, an independent living community, \n14  or other facilities.  Once in a facility, there are significant physical, emotional and other burdens \n15  for the residents that are triggered if they terminate residency, including impacts such as \n16  “transfer trauma.”  BROOKDALE knows and relies on this fact.  As BROOKDALE notes on its \n17  website “[a]s a resident’s health needs increase, they may transition from one level to the next—\n18  all within the same community.  This provides a permanent link to friends and families for them \n19  by assuring they remain in a single location.” \n20  102.  BROOKDALE puts great effort into increasing and maintaining building \n21  occupancy to the detriment of their current and future residents.  Plaintiffs allege on information \n22  and belief that when residents or their family members complain about staffing and/or \n23  conditions at a BROOKDALE facility, employees are instructed to reassure them that things will \n24  improve and that the incident or incidents are temporary snags.  For example, the Family \n25  Council of BROOKDALE Fountaingrove has been meeting every month for many months to \n26  address the inadequate staffing, slow response times to call buttons, and other health and safety \n27  issues faced by the Fountaingrove residents.  BROOKDALE representatives, including Vice \n28  President of Regional Operations Sharyl Ronan and Interim Executive Director Dan Devine, \n    35   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 37 of 100\n \n1  have appeared at many meetings, listened to the numerous complaints, and assured those present \n2  that they are looking into the problems and all will be well.  Notwithstanding these claims, \n3  members of the Family Council report little to no changes or action items undertaken by \n4  BROOKDALE staff after these meetings. \n5  103.  Similarly, residents and family members at BROOKDALE San Ramon hold \n6  monthly Family Council and Resident Council meetings and have informed facility \n7  management, as well as Rick Flynn, District Director of Operations, former Executive Director \n8  Steve Millard, Executive Director Shawn Cull, and former Acting Director Bill Grady of the \n9  problems described above.  In January 2017, Mr. Flynn, Mr. Grady and Mr. Cull attended a \n10  Family Council meeting at which family members and residents demanded answers to their \n11  questions about understaffing, poorly trained staff, undelivered services, food and dining \n12  deficiencies, cancelled activities, and problems with call pendants.  They were reassured at the \n13  meeting and subsequently told by email correspondence that BROOKDALE was working \n14  “diligently” on solutions and had reached out to the District Vice President of Operations Sheila \n15  Garner, who would be helping to resolve the problems.  BROOKDALE also represented that \n16  management had “made progress in our hiring process for clinical and dining,” and was \n17  monitoring the call pendant system and providing additional training to staff.  Since that time, \n18  BROOKDALE announced the hiring of additional employees but concealed from residents that \n19  it was simultaneously cutting the hours of its current employees, cuts which have led to \n20  significant staff turnover.  Residents and family members report that the problems described \n21  above have in fact worsened. \n22  104.  Such reassurances from BROOKDALE are common when residents and family \n23  members raise concerns about the quality of care and services they are receiving.  On \n24  information and belief, Regional Vice Presidents and Executive Directors are instructed to \n25  minimize potential move-outs.  Executive Directors are regularly told by upper management to \n26  do everything they can to “save” the move-out. \n27  105.  BROOKDALE thereby unjustly continues to profit from the original fraud by \n28  perpetuating the misrepresentations, misleading statements, and failures to disclose. \n    36   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

STACIA STINER has been a resident at BROOKDALE San Ramon since \n4  approximately February 13, 2016.  On or about February 12, 2016, STACIA STINER’s mother, \n5  Rita Stiner, read, reviewed, and signed an agreement with BROOKDALE as STACIA \n6  STINER’s legal representative and power of attorney.  As part of this “RESIDENCY \n7  AGREEMENT”, BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to provide you with care, supervision \n8  and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet your needs, we will \n9  provide you with the following Basic Services, which are included in the Basic Service Rate,” \n10  which included, among other things, the room, three daily meals and snacks on demand, weekly \n11  room cleaning, weekly laundry and linen service, planned activities, transportation, observation, \n12  and the availability of staff “24 hours a day, seven days a week.”  This standard residency \n13  agreement also stated that: \n14  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use a personal \n15  service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  The personal service \n16  assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.  The results of the \n17  assessment, our method for evaluating your personal care needs, and the cost of \n18  providing the additional personal services (the “Personal Service Rate”) will be shared \n19  with you. \n20  The Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff assistance that Ms. STINER requires \n21  and has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of staff assistance.  In \n22  addition, Ms. STINER’s mother Rita Stiner has received and reviewed, as enclosures to \n23  BROOKDALE’s rate increase letters, a personal service schedule and list of select and \n24  therapeutic services.  These documents describe a variety of available services, list the \n25  monthly or per-occurrence fee for each service, and detail how BROOKDALE’s \n26  caregivers or other staff will provide the service.  Every month, BROOKDALE sends \n27  Ms. STINER, through Rita Stiner, an invoice for services that the company impliedly \n28  represents it will provide in the following month.  These invoices list the monthly rate for \n    37   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

Ms. STINER, through her legal representative and power of attorney, Rita Stiner, \n5  read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations as statements that \n6  BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and staff \n7  BROOKDALE San Ramon in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services \n8  that BROOKDALE promised and Ms. STINER was paying for.  Ms. STINER, through Rita \n9  Stiner, relied on these representations in making the decision to enter BROOKDALE San \n10  Ramon.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to STACIA or Rita STINER at any time prior to her \n11  admission nor has it disclosed since that time that its corporate policy and procedure of \n12  providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing the \n13  care and services residents have been promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that \n14  they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day.  If \n15  BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to STACIA and/or Rita STINER prior to or early \n16  in Ms. STINER’s residency, RITA STINER would have looked for another facility for STACIA \n17  or would have told BROOKDALE that her daughter would not agree to pay the rates charged by \n18  BROOKDALE.   \n19  108.  Beginning in October 2016, BROOKDALE initiated increases in Ms. STINER’s \n20  basic service and personal service rates.  Ms. STINER and her mother Rita Stiner have been \n21  unable to decipher the changes in Ms. STINER’s bills.  On or about October of 24, 2016, Rita \n22  Stiner received a letter from BROOKDALE’s Executive Director informing her that \n23  Ms. STINER’s basic service rate would increase from $3,205 to $3,429 per month and that her \n24  personal service rate would increase by approximately 6%.  During an in-person meeting in \n25  January of 2017, BROOKDALE staff told Rita Stiner that Ms. STINER’s personal service rates \n26  would rise as follows: the monthly medication management fee would rise from $567 to $631; \n27  the monthly fee for staff assistance with dressing and grooming tasks would rise from $454 to \n28  $505; the monthly fee for assistance with two showers per week would rise from $113 to $631 \n    38   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 40 of 100\n \n1  per week (a significant increase because STACIA STINER was purportedly requiring more than \n2  the allotted 20 minutes of caregiver time per shower); and the monthly fee for assistance with \n3  toileting would increase from $397 to $442.  Rita Stiner had conversations with Shawn Cull, the \n4  acting Executive Director, during which he told her that BROOKDALE would not charge the \n5  full amount of the increases listed above.  Despite numerous communications with Mr. Cull and \n6  the billing department, the monthly bills remain confusing and BROOKDALE has sent Rita \n7  Stiner notices of late payment and even a “30-DAY FINAL DEMAND TO PAY” in December \n8  2016, stating that “[i]n order to provide the care our residents expect and deserve and at the same \n9  time support the professional staff we employ, it’s imperative that we receive our monthly rent \n10  and any additional charges in a timely fashion.”  Brookdale subsequently withdrew the demand, \n11  but the bills remain confusing, and every time there is an increase in Ms. STINER’s monthly \n12  rates, the rate on Ms. STINER’s bills does not correspond to the information given to her or her \n13  mother by Mr. Cull about the increase. \n14  109.  Although Ms. STINER is a wheelchair user, BROOKDALE has not provided her \n15  with a room that has any physical access features.  It does not have sufficient turning space in \n16  the bathroom area, making it difficult for Ms. STINER to enter the bathroom in her wheelchair \n17  and impossible for Ms. STINER to turn around in the bathroom.  The bathroom does not have a \n18  roll-in shower, and the grab bars do not comply with applicable access standards, preventing her \n19  from bathing independently and creating a serious safety hazard.  Ms. STINER cannot reach \n20  most of the hanging or the storage space in her closet and therefore cannot access her clothing or \n21  other personal items without assistance from others.  Ms. STINER’s room has a balcony, but a \n22  two-inch lip leading out to the balcony and insufficient turning space once outside makes it \n23  inaccessible to Ms. STINER.  She once tried to enter and exit the balcony by herself, but has not \n24  attempted to do so since because the experience scared her.  The complete lack of accessible \n25  features in Ms. STINER’s room prevents her from being as independent as possible and causes \n26  her to rely on personal assistance from BROOKDALE staff.  In fact, Ms. STINER is charged \n27  more than $400 per month for toilet assistance because “resident is unable to use the bathroom \n28  on their own.”  BROOKDALE charges Ms. STINER an elevated rate of over $600 for two \n    39   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 41 of 100\n \n1  showers per week because, according to BROOKDALE management, she requires more than \n2  the allotted 20 minutes per shower.  Compounding this problem is BROOKDALE’s \n3  understaffing in care services, which means that Ms. STINER must wait to accomplish most of \n4  her activities of daily living, if at all.  This puts Ms. STINER in humiliating, frustrating and \n5  hazardous situations on a daily basis. \n6  110.  Despite STACIA STINER’s paying approximately $600 per month for \n7  BROOKDALE to “order and coordinate medications between family, health care providers and \n8  pharmacy,” Rita Stiner must pick up medication for her daughter at least once per week, \n9  frequently with only one-day notice from BROOKDALE.  Rita Stiner also does the majority of \n10  her daughter’s laundry because BROOKDALE frequently loses her clothing or returns the \n11  wrong clothing to her. \n12  111.  Understaffing in the dining services department means that Ms. STINER has had \n13  to wait up to 45 minutes just to order breakfast.   \n14  112.  On some days, there is only one caregiver available in the mornings, causing \n15  Ms. STINER to wait anywhere from 10 minutes to one hour for assistance getting dressed.  At \n16  night, Ms. STINER requires assistance if she needs to use the toilet.  She waits anywhere from \n17  10 minutes to an hour for staff to respond and will occasionally have to urinate in her bed when \n18  assistance takes too long to arrive.  She frequently resorts to using her mobile phone to call the \n19  outside line when staff do not respond to her call pendant.  Due to short-staffing, caregivers \n20  often attempt to leave Ms. STINER in the middle of assisting her with bathing or toileting \n21  because they must respond to call pendants from other residents or because they left another \n22  resident on the commode to respond to Ms. STINER.  Ms. STINER objects and insists that the \n23  caregivers finish assisting her before they leave, but she knows that other residents are too afraid \n24  to speak up for themselves and are often stranded by caregivers. \n25  113.  Ms. STINER enjoys getting out of the facility and participating in off-site \n26  activities.  However, BROOKDALE requires that, because she is a wheelchair user, she be \n27  accompanied by a family member or a private personal caregiver.  Although she has been able to \n28  participate in scenic drives or lunches by herself, Ms. STINER had to pay approximately $180 \n    40   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

Ms. STINER enjoys outings to the casino, but BROOKDALE still requires that \n3  she take her mother or a private caregiver on those trips.    Outings are also limited to two \n4  wheelchair users per outing on a first come, first served basis.  If Ms. STINER does not sign up \n5  immediately, she will lose her ability to participate on a particular outing.  This is true of other \n6  wheelchair users in the facility. \n7  114.  In case of fire and other emergencies, BROOKDALE staff has told Ms. STINER \n8  to remain in her room until they come and get her.  However, staff members have not come to \n9  get Ms. STINER when fire alarms go off at the facility, nor have they given her any additional \n10  instructions about how they would assist her in exiting the facility. \n11  Helen Carlson \n12  115.  HELEN CARLSON has been a resident at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove since \n13  October 2011.  When Ms. CARLSON moved into the facility, it was owned and operated by \n14  Emeritus and was known as Emeritus at Santa Rosa.  Prior to move-in, CARLSON’s daughter-\n15  in-law JOAN CARLSON, acting as Ms. CARLSON’s legal representative and power of \n16  attorney, read, reviewed, and signed a standardized residency agreement with Emeritus.  In this \n17  agreement, Emeritus promised to provide a list of “core services” that are substantially similar to \n18  the basic services enumerated in Defendants’ standardized residency agreement.  Emeritus also \n19  agreed to “perform a comprehensive Resident Evaluation prior to your admission in the \n20  Community, regularly thereafter, and as your condition warrants, in order to determine the level \n21  of Personal Care Services that you need.  We will develop your Service Plan, based on your \n22  Resident Evaluation, that describes how we will provide these services.  You will receive \n23  services appropriate to your individual needs, as described in your Service Plan.”  The \n24  agreement reserved Emeritus’s right to assign the agreement to any successor-in-interest selected \n25  by Emeritus. \n26  116.  Ms. CARLSON, through her legal representative and power of attorney JOAN \n27  CARLSON, read and reasonably understood Emeritus’s representations in the residency \n28  agreement as statements that Emeritus used its resident assessment system and results generated \n    41   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 43 of 100\n \n1  by it to determine and provide staffing levels necessary to meet residents’ needs.  \n2  Ms. CARLSON also reasonably understood and expected that Emeritus would staff Emeritus at \n3  Santa Rosa in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services that Emeritus \n4  promised and Ms. CARLSON would be paying for.  Ms. CARLSON, through JOAN \n5  CARLSON, read and relied on the representations in the residency agreement in making the \n6  decision to enter Emeritus at Santa Rosa.  As Ms. CARLSON’s legal representative and power \n7  of attorney, JOAN CARLSON read and signed the agreement acknowledging that she \n8  understood and agreed to all of the terms contained in the agreement.  In or about February \n9  2014, JOAN CARLSON received and read a letter from Emeritus informing residents about the \n10  merger between BROOKDALE and Emeritus.  The letter promised that residents would not be \n11  impacted by the change but would “receive the same excellent care and service you expect at \n12  your community” and would “continue to enjoy all the amenities of your community.”  It further \n13  stated the merger would create a “senior living company offering the most comprehensive set of \n14  senior care solutions” with a commitment to “consumer-focused cultures and a commitment to \n15  continuous improvement and innovation.” \n16  117.  JOAN CARLSON, as her mother-in-law’s power of attorney and legal \n17  representative, read the letter and reasonably understood that the care her mother-in-law received \n18  would be no worse than the care she had received under Emeritus, and possibly improve.  \n19  BROOKDALE did not inform JOAN or HELEN CARLSON nor did they have any reason to \n20  believe that BROOKDALE would not staff the facility with sufficient staff in numbers and \n21  training to provide the services for which Ms. CARLSON and the other residents were paying.   \n22  118.  In 2015, BROOKDALE merged with Emeritus, and Emeritus at Santa Rosa \n23  became BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis \n24  allege, that Emeritus assigned its residency agreements with existing residents to \n25  BROOKDALE, and that BROOKDALE assumed any liability arising from those agreements. \n26  119.  On November 17, 2015, JOAN CARLSON read, reviewed, and signed an \n27  agreement with BROOKDALE as Ms. CARLSON’s legal representative and power of attorney.  \n28  This agreement, entitled “AMENDMENT TO CONTINUING CARE RESIDENCE AND \n    42   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 44 of 100\n \n1  SERVICES AGREEMENT,” amended the residency agreement that Ms. CARLSON signed \n2  with Emeritus and that was assigned to BROOKDALE after the merger with Emeritus.  Pursuant \n3  to this amendment, references to “core services” and “personal care services” were replaced with \n4  the terms “basic services” and “personal services,” and Emeritus’s price schedules for various \n5  services were replaced with BROOKDALE’s standardized personal services price schedule and \n6  lists of select and therapeutic services.  The parties agreed that except as otherwise amended, the \n7  terms of the prior residency agreement would remain in full force and effect. \n8  120.  BROOKDALE has also prepared and periodically updated a Personal Service \n9  Plan for Ms. CARLSON.  Ms. CARLSON’s Personal Service Plan lists the type of staff \n10  assistance that Ms. CARLSON requires and has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee \n11  for each type of staff assistance.  In addition, Ms. CARLSON has received and reviewed as \n12  enclosures to BROOKDALE’s rate increase letters a personal service price schedule and list of \n13  select and therapeutic services.  These documents describe a variety of available services, list the \n14  monthly or per-occurrence fee for each service, and detail how BROOKDALE’s caregivers or \n15  other staff will provide the service.  Every month, BROOKDALE sends Ms. CARLSON, \n16  through JOAN CARLSON, an invoice for services that the company impliedly represents it will \n17  provide in the following month.  These invoices list the monthly rate for the basic services set \n18  forth in BROOKDALE’s standardized residency agreements, the Personal Service Rate that is \n19  based on Ms. CARLSON’s Personal Service Plan, and any rate adjustments. \n20  121.  Ms. CARLSON, through her legal representative and power of attorney JOAN \n21  CARLSON, read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations—as well as \n22  Emeritus’s representations in the agreement that was assigned to BROOKDALE and expressly \n23  incorporated into BROOKDALE’s November 17, 2015 agreement with Ms. CARLSON—as \n24  statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and \n25  staff BROOKDALE Fountaingrove in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the \n26  services that BROOKDALE promised and that Ms. CARLSON was paying for.  \n27  Ms. CARLSON, through JOAN CARLSON, read and relied on these representations in making \n28  the decision to stay at the facility despite the change in ownership. \n    43   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 45 of 100\n \n1  122.  In December 2017, BROOKDALE told JOAN CARLSON that Ms. CARLSON \n2  would need to move into the memory care section of BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  When Ms. \n3  CARLSON moved, BROOKDALE presented JOAN CARLSON with a new RESIDENCY \n4  AGREEMENT.  On or about December 18, 2017, JOAN CARLSON read, reviewed, and signed \n5  an agreement with BROOKDALE as Ms. CARLSON’s legal representative and power of \n6  attorney.  As part of this RESIDENCY AGREEMENT, BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to \n7  provide you with care, supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in \n8  order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, which are \n9  included in the Basic Service Rate,” which included, among other things, the room, three daily \n10  meals and snacks on demand, weekly room cleaning, weekly laundry and linen service, planned \n11  activities, transportation, observation, and the availability of staff “24 hours a day, seven days a \n12  week.”  This standard residency agreement also stated that: \n13  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use a \n14  personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  The \n15  personal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.  \n16  The results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your personal care needs, \n17  and the cost of providing the additional personal services (the “Personal Service \n18  Rate”) will be shared with you. \n19  The Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff assistance that Ms. CARLSON requires and has \n20  agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of staff assistance.  In addition, \n21  JOAN CARLSON has received and reviewed, as enclosures to BROOKDALE’s rate increase \n22  letters, a personal service schedule and list of select and therapeutic services.  These documents \n23  describe a variety of available services, list the monthly or per-occurrence fee for each service, \n24  and detail how BROOKDALE’s caregivers or other staff will provide the service.   \n25  123.  Ms. CARLSON, through her legal representative and power of attorney, JOAN \n26  CARLSON, read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations as statements that \n27  BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and staff \n28  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the \n    44   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 46 of 100\n \n1  services and supervision that BROOKDALE promised she would receive in their memory care \n2  unit and for which Ms. CARLSON was paying.  Ms. CARLSON, through JOAN CARLSON, \n3  relied on these representations in making the decision to move into the memory care unit of \n4  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  BROOKDALE has never disclosed to Ms. CARLSON or JOAN \n5  CARLSON that its corporate policy and procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its \n6  facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing the supervision, care and services residents \n7  have been promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the \n8  care and services they have paid for on any given day.   \n9  124.  BROOKDALE currently charges Ms. CARLSON a Basic Service Rate of $5,290 \n10  per month, plus a Personal Service Rate of $4,173 per month and a Select and Therapeutic \n11  Services rate of $105 per month, minus a loyalty credit of $529 per month.  Ms. CARLSON’s \n12  Personal Service Rate includes, among other things, a $580 monthly fee for staff assistance with \n13  ordering, storing, and taking medications; a $811 monthly fee for staff assistance with dressing \n14  and grooming; a $637 monthly fee for assistance with her oxygen and respiratory equipment; a \n15  $1,507 monthly fee for help setting up, cleaning and assistance with nebulizer treatments; a $116 \n16  monthly fee for staff assistance with showering; a $927 monthly fee for staff assistance with \n17  using the bathroom; a $522 monthly fee for staff assistance with accomplishing and/or \n18  participating in daily routines due to memory loss or cognitive impairment; a $290 monthly fee \n19  for help going to and from the dining room and/or community activities; and a $290 monthly fee \n20  for “additional staff involvement because of demonstrating anxious, disruptive or obsessive \n21  behavior requiring additional attention.”  Ms. CARLSON also pays $100 per month for \n22  incontinence supplies, which BROOKDALE represents its staff will order and stock. \n23  125.  Beginning in early 2016, JOAN CARLSON and her husband Ralph Carlson \n24  began to observe a decline in the quality of care provided to Ms. CARLSON.  On one occasion, \n25  JOAN discovered that despite promising to fax certain paperwork to Ms. CARLSON’s primary \n26  care physician in advance of a scheduled appointment, BROOKDALE’s staff never did so.  In \n27  addition, JOAN and Ralph CARLSON stopped receiving phone calls to notify them of \n28  Ms. CARLSON’s injuries and other noteworthy incidents. \n    45   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 47 of 100\n \n1  126.  In June 2016, Ms. CARLSON was admitted to the hospital after falling while \n2  attempting to get out of bed.  BROOKDALE’s staff failed to call JOAN or Ralph CARLSON, \n3  even though they are listed as Ms. CARLSON’s emergency contacts.  As a result, \n4  Ms. CARLSON spent several hours in the emergency room without a family member present, \n5  and she was charged for ambulance transport back to BROOKDALE Fountaingrove because no \n6  family member was present to give her a ride. \n7  127.  In December 2016, Ms. CARLSON’s doctor took her off the blood thinner \n8  Coumadin.  Nonetheless, in January and February 2017, staff at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove \n9  continued to order and stock Coumadin for Ms. CARLSON.  BROOKDALE charged \n10  Ms. CARLSON a monthly fee for staff assistance with ordering and storing medications, even \n11  though BROOKDALE’s staff failed to adequately perform that service. \n12  128.  JOAN and Ralph CARLSON have also observed numerous failures by staff to \n13  assist Ms. CARLSON with using the bathroom, even though Ms. CARLSON pays a monthly fee \n14  for that service.  In addition, even though Ms. CARLSON pays a monthly fee for staff to order \n15  and stock incontinence products, she has often run out of such products because \n16  BROOKDALE’s staff do not check whether supplies are running low or if orders need to be \n17  adjusted. \n18  129.  Ms. CARLSON was unable to use the bathroom sink and kitchenette sink in her \n19  previous suite because they are installed at a height that makes them inaccessible for wheelchair \n20  users.  Ms. CARLSON requires glasses to see and dentures to eat, but BROOKDALE staff \n21  frequently misplace or lose these assistive devices. \n22  130.  JOAN and Ralph CARLSON have complained to managers at BROOKDALE \n23  Fountaingrove about these problems on numerous occasions.  Although BROOKDALE \n24  management repeatedly reassured JOAN and Ralph CARLSON that BROOKDALE would \n25  address their concerns, they did not see any improvement when Ms. CARLSON resided in \n26  assisted living.  Since Ms. CARLSON has resided at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, \n27  BROOKDALE has never disclosed that its staffing policies and procedures preclude it from \n28  providing its residents all of the care and services they have been promised and places all \n    46   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to JOAN \n3  CARLSON early in Ms. CARLSON’s residency, she would have looked for another facility for \n4  Ms. CARLSON and would have told BROOKDALE that Ms. CARLSON would not agree to \n5  pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE.   \n6  131.  In December 2017, BROOKDALE told JOAN and Ralph CARLSON that \n7  HELEN CARLSON needed to move to memory care, and that she would receive additional \n8  supervision and care if she moved to the memory care unit and paid additional \n9  fees.  BROOKDALE told them that if they did not move Ms. CARLSON into memory care at \n10  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, Ms. CARLSON would have to move out of Fountaingrove \n11  entirely, and gave JOAN CARLSON only a little over a week to decide.  Because of the short \n12  time frame, JOAN CARLSON was unable to investigate whether there were comparable \n13  facilities in the area that might have accepted Ms. CARLSON.  JOAN CARLSON ultimately \n14  felt she had no choice but to move Ms. CARLSON into the memory care unit at BROOKDALE \n15  Fountaingrove.  Her decision was based on BROOKDALE’s representations about additional \n16  supervision and care, her fear that Ms. CARLSON would suffer severe trauma if she were to be \n17  transferred to an entirely new facility, and the lack of time to investigate other options.  In the \n18  memory care unit, just as in assisted living, Ms. CARLSON is housed in a room with multiple \n19  inaccessible features, including a sink, toilet, and closet that are not wheelchair-accessible. \n20      Lawrence Quinlan \n21  132.  LAWRENCE QUINLAN stayed at the facility at BROOKDALE Hemet for \n22  short-term respite on several occasions between 2013 and 2015.  On approximately July 14, \n23  2015, he was admitted to BROOKDALE Hemet for a “respite stay” following a hospitalization \n24  and rehabilitation for a broken leg.  On July 10, 2015, BROOKDALE gave his granddaughter, \n25  LORESIA VALLETTE, a Residency Agreement for LAWRENCE QUINLAN.  Ms. \n26  VALLETTE read, reviewed, and signed the agreement with BROOKDALE on behalf of \n27  LAWRENCE QUINLAN.  BROOKDALE did not ask LAWRENCE QUINLAN whether he \n28  could sign the document or whether LORESIA VALLETTE held Power of Attorney for him.  \n    47   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 49 of 100\n \n1  BROOKDALE did not ask Ms. VALLETTE for documentation showing that she had the legal \n2  authority to sign the Residency Agreement on behalf of LAWRENCE QUINLAN.   \n3  133.  LAWRENCE QUINLAN left BROOKDALE Hemet for his home on or about \n4  September 5, 2015.  On September 13, 2015, he was re-admitted to BROOKDALE Hemet as a \n5  long-term resident.  Prior to LAWRENCE QUINLAN’s move-in, on or about September 13, \n6  2015, BROOKDALE gave his son, Phillip Quinlan, a Residency Agreement for LAWRENCE \n7  QUINLAN.  Phillip Quinlan read, reviewed, and signed the agreement with BROOKDALE on \n8  behalf of LAWRENCE QUINLAN.  BROOKDALE did not ask LAWRENCE QUINLAN \n9  whether he could sign the document or whether Phillip Quinlan held Power of Attorney for him.  \n10  BROOKDALE did not ask Phillip Quinlan for documentation showing that he had the legal \n11  authority to sign the Residency Agreement on behalf of LAWRENCE QUINLAN.  In fact, on \n12  page 15 of the Residency Agreement, under his signature, Phillip Quinlan filled in the name and \n13  contact information of his niece and LAWRENCE QUINLAN’s granddaughter, LORESIA \n14  VALLETTE, under the section titled “LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE/RESPONSIBLE PARTY \n15  ADDRESS.”  In its Resident Information/Emergency Contact Sheet, BROOKDALE listed \n16  LORESIA VALLETTE as Mr. QUINLAN’s “Legally Responsible Party” for both “Financial” \n17  and “Health Care.” \n18  134.  As part of the “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT” provided first to Ms. VALLETTE \n19  and then to Phillip Quinlan, BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to provide you with care, \n20  supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet your \n21  needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, which are included in the Basic \n22  Service Rate.”  These included, among other things, the room, three daily meals and snacks on \n23  demand, weekly room cleaning, weekly laundry and linen service, planned activities, \n24  transportation, observation, and the availability of staff “24 hours a day, seven days a week.”  \n25  This standard residency agreement also stated that: \n26  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use a \n27  personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  The \n28  personal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.  \n    48   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

Mr. QUINLAN’s son, Phillip Quinlan, and his granddaughter, LORESIA \n7  VALLETTE, read the agreement on LAWRENCE QUINLAN’s behalf and reasonably \n8  understood BROOKDALE’s representations as statements that BROOKDALE would perform \n9  assessments to determine needed services and staff BROOKDALE Hemet in a manner that \n10  would allow it to consistently provide the services that BROOKDALE promised and for which \n11  Mr. QUINLAN was paying.  Ms. VALLETTE and Phillip Quinlan relied on these \n12  representations in making the decision to place Mr. QUINLAN at BROOKDALE Hemet and to \n13  pay BROOKDALE the monthly fees from Mr. QUINLAN’s accounts.  BROOKDALE did not \n14  disclose to LAWRENCE QUINLAN, Phillip Quinlan, or LORESIA VALLETTE at any time \n15  prior to his admission nor has it disclosed since that time that its corporate policy and procedure \n16  of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing the \n17  care and services residents have been promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that \n18  they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day.  If \n19  BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to LAWRENCE QUINLAN, Phillip Quinlan, or \n20  LORESIA VALLETTE, they would have looked for another facility for Mr. QUINLAN and \n21  would not have agreed to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE from LAWRENCE \n22  QUINLAN’s accounts.  \n23  136.  Mr. QUINLAN is a wheelchair-user.  He has right hemiparesis and aphasia due \n24  to past strokes.  He has mild dementia.  During the time Mr. QUINLAN was a resident at \n25  BROOKDALE Hemet, he required assistance with the following activities of daily living:  \n26  bathing, personal hygiene, dressing, laundry, housecleaning, taking medication, preparing meals, \n27  toileting, and transfers to and from his wheelchair.  During Mr. QUINLAN’s long-term stay at \n28  BROOKDALE Hemet, he paid for but was not consistently provided that assistance. \n    49   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 51 of 100\n \n1  137.  Although he was paying for assistance with laundry, dressing and showering, Mr. \n2  QUINLAN’s granddaughter and son noticed that he smelled horrible and wore dirty clothing.  \n3  When Ms. VALLETTE asked BROOKDALE staff why Mr. QUINLAN smelled so bad, they \n4  blamed him for refusing to take a shower.  BROOKDALE then raised Mr. QUINLAN’s monthly \n5  personal care rate by $700, even though they were not giving him the promised showers, \n6  because he was “resistant.”  Ms. VALLETTE requested that BROOKDALE’s staff call her if \n7  Mr. QUINLAN refused to shower or change his clothing so that she could speak with her \n8  grandfather and try to convince him to cooperate.  BROOKDALE staff rarely called Ms. \n9  VALLETTE, but the facility continued to charge Mr. QUINLAN a premium for showers and \n10  dressing assistance they were not providing. \n11  138.  Over time, BROOKDALE continued to increase Mr. QUINLAN’s monthly care \n12  rates, blaming his resistance to care.  Ms. VALLETTE accepted the care rate increases with the \n13  expectation that Mr. QUINLAN would actually receive the services for which BROOKDALE \n14  was charging him.  Despite the increased fees, BROOKDALE staff rarely provided the promised \n15  assistance with showering, dressing or toileting to Mr. QUINLAN.  Toward the end of Mr. \n16  QUINLAN’s stay at BROOKDALE Hemet, the Executive Director told Ms. VALLETTE that \n17  they would need to move Mr. QUINLAN to the memory care unit and take away his motorized \n18  scooter in order to care for him.  This would result in another increase in his monthly rate. In \n19  April 2017, frustrated by BROOKDALE’s failure to provide the assistance her grandfather \n20  needed and for which he was paying increasingly higher fees, Ms. VALLETTE told \n21  BROOKDALE that Mr. QUINLAN would be moving out.  Prior to the move-out date, Ms. \n22  VALLETTE and Phillip Quinlan took Mr. QUINLAN to a physician’s office to get a \n23  tuberculosis test.  When he transferred out of his wheelchair, they saw that the seating pad was \n24  soaked with urine and that the plastic was breaking down as a result.  It was clear that neither the \n25  seating pad nor Mr. QUINLAN had been washed for a very long time.  Although Mr. \n26  QUINLAN’s move-out date was scheduled for early May 2017, Ms. VALLETTE moved him \n27  out on April 30, 2017.  Mr. QUINLAN is a currently a resident of an unrelated assisted living \n28  facility in Riverside, California. \n    50   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 52 of 100\n \n1    Edward Boris \n2  139.  EDWARD BORIS was a resident at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove’s assisted \n3  living facility from approximately September 10, 2015 to approximately July 21, 2016.  On or \n4  about September 10, 2015, EDWARD BORIS’s daughter MICHELE LYTLE, read, reviewed, \n5  and signed a “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT” with BROOKDALE as EDWARD BORIS’s legal \n6  representative and power of attorney.  As part of this “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT,” \n7  BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to provide you with care, supervision and assistance with \n8  instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the \n9  following Basic Services, which are included in the Basic Service Rate.”  These included, \n10  among other things, the room, three daily meals, planned activities, transportation, and the \n11  availability of staff “24 hours a day, seven days a week.”  This standard residency agreement \n12  also stated that: \n13  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use a personal \n14  service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  The personal service \n15  assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.  The results of the \n16  assessment, our method for evaluating your personal care needs, and the cost of providing \n17  the additional personal service (the “Personal Service Rate”) will be shared with you. \n18  140.  Among the personal services Mr. BORIS required and agreed to pay for were \n19  catheter care, changing, and emptying; toileting assistance; assistance going to and from the \n20  dining room and other activities; medication administration; pharmacy services, including \n21  medication pick-up; assistance bathing; and application of topical anti-fungal medication.  On \n22  top of a $4,545 monthly Basic Service Rate, BROOKDALE charged Mr. BORIS a $2,697 \n23  monthly personal service fee.  In addition to the residency agreement’s promises of adequate \n24  care and service provision, Ms. LYTLE received and reviewed a variety of rate increase letters \n25  and invoices that listed the fees for services BROOKDALE agreed its caregivers and other staff \n26  would provide to Mr. BORIS.  Mr. BORIS, through his legal representative and power of \n27  attorney, MICHELE LYTLE, read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations \n28  as statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and \n    51   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 53 of 100\n \n1  staff BROOKDALE Fountaingrove in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the \n2  services that BROOKDALE promised and for which Mr. BORIS was paying.   Mr. BORIS, \n3  through MICHELE LYTLE, relied on these representations in making the decision to enter \n4  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove and to pay BROOKDALE the monthly fees it charged him.   \n5  141.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to Mr. BORIS or his legal representative at any \n6  time prior to his admission nor has it disclosed since that time that its corporate policy and \n7  procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from \n8  providing the care and services residents have been promised and places all residents at a \n9  substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given \n10  day.  If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to Mr. BORIS or his legal representative \n11  prior to or early in his residency, they would have looked for another facility for Mr. BORIS and \n12  would not have agreed to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE.   \n13  142.  BROOKDALE staff failed to regularly monitor Mr. BORIS’s catheter, even \n14  though Mr. BORIS required and paid for that service.  On one occasion in May 2016, Mr. \n15  BORIS’s catheter overflowed, disconnected, and spilled urine all over his room.  On July 20, \n16  2016, Mr. BORIS’s catheter developed a blockage, but BROOKDALE’s staff failed to identify \n17  or address the problem for about 24 hours.  Mr. BORIS’s girlfriend, who visited Mr. BORIS at \n18  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove on the evening of July 20, noticed blood in the catheter bag and \n19  reported it to BROOKDALE’s staff.  Staff came to Mr. BORIS’s room, but they were rushed, \n20  failed to identify the blockage, and did nothing to assist Mr. BORIS.  Instead, they told Mr. \n21  BORIS’s girlfriend not to worry.  The next day, Mr. BORIS was in extreme pain; there was still \n22  a blockage and very little urine appeared in the catheter bag.  Mr. BORIS’s condition continued \n23  to deteriorate and eventually his girlfriend took him to a local hospital, where doctors diagnosed \n24  the blocked catheter.  As a result of the blockage, Mr. BORIS suffered a urinary tract infection \n25  and kidney failure, and had to stay in intensive care for several days.  After his discharge from \n26  the hospital, Mr. BORIS’s condition was so bad that he had to be transferred out of assisted \n27  living and into skilled nursing.   \n28  143.  Aware that BROOKDALE’s failure to adequately provide the care and services it \n    52   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 54 of 100\n \n1  had promised contributed to Mr. BORIS’s declining health, Ms. LYTLE sought to move him out \n2  of BROOKDALE’s custody.  Ms. LYTLE conducted significant research and held onsite \n3  interviews with at least three other skilled nursing facilities.  However, because Mr. BORIS’s \n4  condition had deteriorated so significantly, she was unable to find any facility willing to accept \n5  Mr. BORIS as a resident.  Thus, the same inadequate care that contributed to Mr. BORIS’s \n6  illness prevented Ms. LYTLE from moving Mr. BORIS into a different facility. \n7  144.  From February 2016 through the end of his time in BROOKDALE’s assisted \n8  living facility, Mr. BORIS had a recurring fungal infection on his legs and in his groin area.  His \n9  doctor ordered him to keep the area clean and apply a topical medication twice a day.  Even \n10  though Mr. BORIS paid thousands of dollars per month for necessary personal services, \n11  including help with bathing and administering medications, BROOKDALE staff failed to bathe \n12  Mr. BORIS or apply his topical medication regularly.  As a result, the infection persisted for \n13  months.  At times, the infected area was bloody and emitted a foul odor that pervaded Mr. \n14  BORIS’s room. \n15  145.  Mr. BORIS takes a blood thinning medication as well as several other \n16  medications.  When he was in assisted living at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, he paid $726 per \n17  month for staff assistance with ordering, storing, and administering his medications, but \n18  BROOKDALE staff regularly failed to perform these tasks.  At one point in May 2016, \n19  BROOKDALE staff failed to give Mr. BORIS his blood thinning medication for three days \n20  straight.  The problem was discovered only after Mr. BORIS’s girlfriend noticed the lapse.  On \n21  several other occasions, staff failed to refill Mr. BORIS’s prescriptions, so his girlfriend had to \n22  pick them up herself.  One time, Mr. BORIS’s medication for his fungal infection ran out and \n23  staff failed to replace it for several days. \n24  146.  One of the main reasons MICHELE LYTLE sought out an assisted living facility \n25  for her father was that Mr. BORIS needed regular staff assistance to prevent and respond to falls.  \n26  However, on numerous occasions during his stay in the BROOKDALE Fountaingrove assisted \n27  living facility, Mr. BORIS fell in his room and was left on the ground for extended periods of \n28  time because the facility was so understaffed employees could not regularly check on him.  \n    53   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 55 of 100\n \n1  When Ms. LYTLE reported this problem to staff at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, they \n2  dismissed the falls as minor even though Mr. BORIS had bruises on his body.  Other times, even \n3  though BROOKDALE had agreed to provide Mr. BORIS with toileting assistance multiple \n4  times per day and charged him a substantial monthly fee for that service, he was left sitting in \n5  his own feces because BROOKDALE staff failed to check on him or help him use the bathroom.  \n6  When he resided in assisted living, Mr. BORIS had difficulty getting around on his own, even \n7  with the assistance of a walker or wheelchair.  He is also very introverted.  As a result, he \n8  seldom left his room for meals unless prompted by staff.  Although BROOKDALE charged Mr. \n9  BORIS a monthly fee for help going to and from the dining room, staff frequently failed to \n10  prompt Mr. BORIS at mealtimes or bring him food from the dining room, so he often missed \n11  meals.  BROOKDALE charged Mr. BORIS $5 per meal when meals were supposedly brought \n12  to his room.  However, when Ms. LYTLE asked BROOKDALE staff how often her father had \n13  been eating, they were unable to answer.  Because BROOKDALE often failed to prompt Mr. \n14  BORIS to attend meals or to supply them in his room, Mr. BORIS relied on his girlfriend to take \n15  prepared food to him. \n16  147.  Even though BROOKDALE promises weekly laundry service in its residency \n17  agreement, staff frequently failed to wash Mr. BORIS’s clothes and laundry on a weekly basis.  \n18  In addition, staff often dumped Mr. BORIS’s clean laundry in a pile in his room, even though he \n19  was not capable of putting it away himself.  MICHELE LYTLE brought these problems to the \n20  attention of managers at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  BROOKDALE management assured \n21  Ms. LYTLE that they were working to address her concerns, but she never saw significant \n22  improvement during the time that Mr. Boris resided in assisted living.  Mr. BORIS ultimately \n23  had to move out of assisted living precisely because of a serious infection he developed due to \n24  BROOKDALE staff’s failure to monitor his catheter.  BROOKDALE has never disclosed to Mr. \n25  BORIS or Ms. LYTLE that its staffing policies and procedures preclude it from consistently \n26  providing its residents the care and services they have been promised and places all residents in \n27  an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for \n28  on any given day.  However, several low-level, non-managerial BROOKDALE employees \n    54   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

RALPH SCHMIDT is 53 years old, is blind, and has significant cognitive \n6  impairments, including short-term memory loss.  Both his blindness and cognitive impairments \n7  are the result of a traumatic brain injury suffered more than 20 years ago.  Mr. SCHMIDT has a \n8  court-appointed conservator who manages his financial, medical, and legal affairs.  He needs \n9  assistance with the following activities of daily living: housekeeping, laundry, navigating when \n10  outside of his dwelling, preparing nutritious meals, and transportation.   \n11  149.  RALPH SCHMIDT was a resident at the assisted living facility currently known \n12  as BROOKDALE Tracy from approximately September 2011 to October 30, 2017.  The \n13  BROOKDALE Tracy facility was operated by Emeritus when Mr. SCHMIDT moved in.  \n14  However, BROOKDALE took over operation of the facility following its merger with Emeritus. \n15  150.  In or about April 2014, Emeritus announced that it would merge with \n16  BROOKDALE.  At the time of the merger, Mr. SCHMIDT’s then-conservator and legal \n17  representative, Ms. Gallagher, had no reason to believe that the care Mr. SCHMIDT would \n18  receive from BROOKDALE would be any worse than the care he had received under Emeritus.  \n19  BROOKDALE did not inform Mr. SCHMIDT or his conservator nor did they have any reason \n20  to believe that BROOKDALE would not staff the facility with sufficient staff in numbers and \n21  training to provide the services for which Mr. SCHMIDT and the other residents were paying.   \n22  151.  After taking over operations at the Tracy assisted living facility, BROOKDALE, \n23  on or about July 5, 2016, required Ms. Gallagher, Ms. FISHER’s predecessor as RALPH \n24  SCHMIDT’s conservator, to execute an updated Residency Agreement with BROOKDALE on \n25  Mr. SCHMIDT’s behalf.  As part of this “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT,” BROOKDALE stated \n26  that “[i]n order to provide you with care, supervision and assistance with instrumental activities \n27  of daily living in order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the following Basic \n28  Services, which are included in the Basic Service Rate.”  These included, among other things, \n    55   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

The personal service \n6  assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.  The results of the \n7  assessment, our method for evaluating your personal care needs, and the cost of providing \n8  the additional personal service (the “Personal Service Rate”) will be shared with you. \n9  Among the personal services Mr. SCHMIDT required were assistance navigating from his \n10  second-floor room to the dining room at meal times and to other community spaces, prompts to \n11  engage in community and social activities, and medication management.  In exchange for these \n12  necessary services, as of July 2016, Mr. SCHMIDT payed a monthly fee of over $1,000 in \n13  addition to his basic service rate. \n14  152.  Mr. SCHMIDT, through his conservator, read and reasonably understood \n15  BROOKDALE’s representations as statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments \n16  to determine needed services and staff BROOKDALE Tracy in a manner that would allow it to \n17  consistently provide the services that BROOKDALE promised and for which Mr. SCHMIDT \n18  was paying.  Mr. SCHMIDT, through his conservator, relied on these representations in making \n19  the decision to remain at BROOKDALE Tracy and to pay BROOKDALE the monthly fees it \n20  charged him.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to Mr. SCHMIDT or his legal representative at \n21  any time that its corporate policy and procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its \n22  facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing the care and services residents have been \n23  promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and \n24  services they have paid for on any given day.  If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact \n25  to Mr. SCHMIDT or his legal representative, they would have looked much sooner for another \n26  facility for Mr. SCHMIDT and would not have agreed to pay the rates charged by \n27  BROOKDALE from Mr. SCHMIDT’s estate’s funds.   \n28  153.  During his time with BROOKDALE, Mr. SCHMIDT lived in a second-floor \n    56   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 58 of 100\n \n1  room.  Because of his blindness, short-term memory loss, and other cognitive impairments, \n2  Mr. SCHMIDT was unable to navigate to the dining room or other public areas from the second \n3  floor, which would have required him to use stairs or operate an elevator.  Placement on the \n4  second floor caused Mr. SCHMIDT to require the assistance of BROOKDALE staff for escort \n5  services he would not have needed had he been on the first floor, and BROOKDALE mandated \n6  that Mr. SCHMIDT pay for the escort services he received.  Thus the second-floor placement \n7  both unnecessarily reduced Mr. SCHMIDT’s autonomy and increased the fees he paid to \n8  BROOKDALE.  A first-floor room would have provided Mr. SCHMIDT greater autonomy and \n9  would have reduced BROOKDALE’s charges for escort services.  However, when Ms. \n10  Gallagher asked if Mr. SCHMIDT could be moved to an apartment that would accommodate his \n11  needs, BROOKDALE responded that a first-floor room would be more expensive and would \n12  thus negate any savings from the elimination of escort fees.   \n13  154.  Because Mr. SCHMIDT required staff assistance to navigate from his second-\n14  floor room to the dining room and other common areas, he frequently waited for staff to come \n15  and assist him.  Mr. SCHMIDT used a call button to summon an escort for each meal and \n16  typically waited twenty to thirty minutes before a BROOKDALE staff member would arrive.  \n17  Mr. SCHMIDT faced similarly lengthy waits when he wanted to return to his room.  These waits \n18  greatly frustrated Mr. SCHMIDT. \n19  155.  BROOKDALE responded to Mr. SCHMIDT’s frustration and need for \n20  appropriate accommodations in shockingly inappropriate ways.  Professing to be concerned that \n21  Mr. SCHMIDT might harm someone with his tapping cane, BROOKDALE staff once took it \n22  away from him for several weeks.  This rendered Mr. SCHMIDT unable to safely navigate \n23  around even the first floor of the BROOKDALE Tracy facility.  BROOKDALE staff did not \n24  return Mr. SCHMIDT’s tapping cane until his conservator personally intervened.  On other \n25  occasions, BROOKDALE staff failed to provide Mr. SCHMIDT with a tapping cane or notify \n26  his conservator of his need for one when his previous cane was broken and unusable.  \n27  BROOKDALE’s response to Mr. SCHMIDT’s frustration with slow staff responses to calls for \n28  assistance simply rendered Mr. SCHMIDT more dependent on BROOKDALE staff. \n    57   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 59 of 100\n \n1  156.  Several times during Mr. SCHMIDT’s years at BROOKDALE, he formed \n2  relationships with other residents who would assist him in navigating from his apartment to the \n3  dining room at meals times.  During these periods in which Mr. SCHMIDT had the assistance of \n4  other residents, he did not rely on BROOKDALE staff as frequently for escort services.  \n5  Nevertheless, BROOKDALE continued to charge Mr. SCHMIDT the same escort fee. \n6  157.  Because of his short-term memory loss and other cognitive impairments, Mr. \n7  SCHMIDT occasionally lost the key to the door of his apartment during his time at \n8  BROOKDALE Tracy.  On one occasion, rather than replace his key, BROOKDALE staff gave \n9  Mr. SCHMIDT a blank, uncut key, and told him that it was the key to his apartment.  Mr. \n10  SCHMIDT believed what BROOKDALE staff told him and could not understand why the key \n11  would not unlock his door.  This caused Mr. SCHMIDT great distress and made him \n12  unnecessarily reliant on BROOKDALE staff to open his apartment door when he wanted to \n13  enter his room. \n14  158.  On several occasions the toilet in Mr. SCHMIDT’s apartment overflowed.  \n15  BROOKDALE responded by locking Mr. SCHMIDT out of the bathroom in his apartment \n16  altogether.  Rather than fix the problems with the toilet, BROOKDALE gave Mr. SCHMIDT, \n17  via his conservator, HEATHER FISHER, the option of a portable toilet in Mr. SCHMIDT’s \n18  room or paying for a full-time personal caretaker at the additional cost of $250 per day.  Mr. \n19  SCHMIDT’s estate was unable to bear the expense of a full-time personal caretaker, so Ms. \n20  FISHER reluctantly accepted the option of a portable toilet.  However, BROOKDALE failed to \n21  regularly empty the toilet, which caused Mr. SCHMIDT’s room to have an unpleasant odor.  Mr. \n22  SCHMIDT responded by routinely emptying the portable toilet himself, directly onto the roof \n23  outside of his window.  Aware of the problem and Mr. SCHMIDT’s response, BROOKDALE \n24  failed to remove fecal matter sitting just outside of Mr. SCHMIDT’s window.  \n25  159.  Mr. SCHMIDT also disliked using the portable toilet as he found it too small for \n26  him to comfortably sit on.  He would have preferred to use a toilet outside of his room, but staff \n27  responded so slowly to his call button that calling for an escort to a bathroom was not a realistic \n28  option.  On one occasion, he pressed his call button to use the bathroom around 11:00 p.m., and \n    58   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

Denial of access to his bathroom also meant that Mr. SCHMIDT could not \n3  shower without the assistance of BROOKDALE staff.  Having locked him out of his bathroom, \n4  BROOKDALE staff allowed Mr. SCHMIDT to shower only twice per week, usually at night.  \n5  This too distressed Mr. SCHMIDT, as he preferred to shower more frequently and to do so in \n6  the morning.  Moreover, if Mr. SCHMIDT was engaged in an activity and declined to shower at \n7  the moment the opportunity was offered, he could shower only once per week. \n8  161.  Although BROOKDALE promised to provide housekeeping among its basic \n9  services, Mr. SCHMIDT’s apartment was not well cared for and was rarely clean.  His carpets \n10  were covered with stains and frequently dirty.  The windows to his room had no blinds, and the \n11  screens had been almost completely torn off.  Before BROOKDALE locked Mr. SCHMIDT out \n12  of the bathroom in his apartment, BROOKDALE also failed to keep it clean.  The bathroom was \n13  frequently dirty and unhygienic. \n14    Art Lindstrom \n15  162.  ART LINDSTROM was a resident of BROOKDALE Scotts Valley from \n16  approximately November 2015 until his death on February 23, 2018.  His wife, PAT \n17  LINDSTROM, has also been a resident of BROOKDALE Scotts Valley from approximately \n18  November 2015 and remains a resident of the facility.  On or about October 31, 2015, ART \n19  LINDSTROM and his wife PAT LINDSTROM read, reviewed, and signed a “RESIDENCY \n20  AGREEMENT” with BROOKDALE.  As part of this “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT,” \n21  BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to provide you with care, supervision and assistance with \n22  instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the \n23  following Basic Services, which are included in the Basic Service Rate.”  These included, \n24  among other things, the room, three daily meals, planned activities, transportation, ongoing \n25  observation and consultation regarding social and health care needs, and the availability of staff \n26  “24 hours a day, seven days a week.” \n27  163.  BROOKDALE also provided a standard form further elaborating on the \n28  “Services and Care Covered by [the] Basic Service Rate.”  These services and care described \n    59   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 61 of 100\n \n1  included “housekeeping,” “routine wellness monitoring,” “consultation with [a] Brookdale \n2  clinical team,” and “signature dining programs with nutritious meals and snacks planned by a \n3  registered dietician.”  \n4  164.  Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s \n5  representations in the RESIDENCY AGREEMENT and other standard documents as statements \n6  that BROOKDALE would staff the Scotts Valley facility in a manner that would allow it to \n7  consistently provide them with the care, supervision and assistance they needed and for which \n8  they were paying BROOKDALE, which included the services and care covered by the Basic \n9  Service Rate.   Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM relied on these representations in making the decision \n10  to enter BROOKDALE Scotts Valley.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to Mr. and Ms. \n11  LINDSTROM at any time prior to their admission nor has it disclosed since that time that its \n12  corporate policy and procedure of providing predetermined staffing at its facilities precludes \n13  BROOKDALE from providing the care and services residents have been promised and places all \n14  residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for \n15  on any given day.  If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to Mr. and Ms. \n16  LINDSTROM prior to or early in their residency, they would have looked for another facility \n17  and would not have agreed to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE. \n18  165.  When Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM moved in to BROOKDALE, their “basic \n19  service rate” was approximately $5,900 per month plus an additional $400 monthly second-\n20  resident fee.  In addition to these recurring charges, Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM were made to \n21  pay move-in fees totaling more than $8,000.  When Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM moved from \n22  their initial two-bedroom suite into a studio apartment, their rate decreased to $4,295 per month \n23  plus the $400 monthly second-resident fee. \n24  166.  During his residency at BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, Mr. LINDSTROM was \n25  diabetic; used a cane to walk; suffered from kidney failure, heart disease, and sleep apnea; had a \n26  dementia-related cognitive impairment; and had difficulty controlling his weight. He required \n27  assistance with the following activities of daily living:  bathing, shaving, administration of \n28  medication, dressing, laundry, and preparing nutritious meals.  Because Mr. and Ms. \n    60   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 62 of 100\n \n1  LINDSTROM could not afford the additional care fees related to many of these activities, Ms. \n2  LINDSTROM assisted Mr. LINDSTROM with most of these tasks.   However, Mr. and Ms. \n3  LINDSTROM sought and BROOKDALE promised to provide assistance with preparing \n4  nutritious meals and snacks planned by a registered dietician and to personally assess and \n5  provide necessary health and social services.  These promises were among the principal reasons \n6  Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM decided to live at BROOKDALE Scotts Valley.  Although \n7  BROOKDALE promised to prepare meals appropriate for Mr. LINDSTROM’s personal \n8  condition as part of its basic services, it failed to do so. \n9  167.  After they moved in to BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM \n10  discovered that there was no registered dietician on staff to make sure Mr. LINDSTROM \n11  received meals appropriate for his condition.  Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM also discovered that \n12  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing prevented kitchen staff from preparing and \n13  serving Mr. LINDSTROM meals appropriate for someone with diabetes.  Because there were \n14  too few staff to pay attention to individual residents’ dietary needs, those who were unfamiliar \n15  with Mr. LINDSTROM’s condition and personal health requirements often served him \n16  oversized portions of foods unsuitable for a diabetic when they noticed he was a large man. \n17  Mr. LINDSTROM’s cognitive impairment made it especially difficult for him to resist tempting \n18  but unhealthy food once it was on his plate.  \n19  168.  The lack of adequate staffing left Mr. LINDSTROM without the individualized \n20  nutritional attention and assistance he required.  As a result, after moving into BROOKDALE, \n21  Mr. LINDSTROM gained 20 pounds, which exacerbated his difficulty walking and put him at \n22  increased risk of complications from diabetes.  Because his dementia was also exacerbated by \n23  his diabetes, Mr. LINDSTROM’s cognitive decline may have accelerated. \n24  169.  When the Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM moved in to BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, \n25  there was an onsite physical therapist available to advise and assist residents with recovery from \n26  injuries.  The availability of a physical therapist was attractive to Mr. and Mrs. LINDSTROM, \n27  and they relied on BROOKDALE’s representation that the onsite physical therapist would be \n28  available to them.  They also understood that BROOKDALE’s promise to provide continuous \n    61   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 63 of 100\n \n1  monitoring and consultation on health would include keeping an onsite physical therapist on \n2  staff. \n3  170.  Approximately six months after Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM arrived at \n4  BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, however, the physical therapist left, and BROOKDALE has failed \n5  to hire a replacement.  After entering BROOKDALE, Mr. LINDSTROM suffered a knee injury \n6  and would have used the onsite physical therapist’s services during his recovery had that been an \n7  option.  Instead, Mr. LINDSTROM had to seek less convenient physical therapy services outside \n8  of the BROOKDALE facility. \n9    Bernie Jestrabek-Hart \n10  171.  BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART has been a resident of BROOKDALE Scotts \n11  Valley since approximately October 17, 2015.  On or about September 30, 2015, BERNIE \n12  JESTRABEK-HART read, reviewed, and signed a “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT” with \n13  BROOKDALE.  As part of this “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT,” BROOKDALE stated that \n14  “[i]n order to provide you with care, supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of \n15  daily living in order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, \n16  which are included in the Basic Service Rate.”  These included, among other things, the room, \n17  three daily meals, planned activities, transportation, and the availability of staff “24 hours a day, \n18  seven days a week.”  This standard residency agreement also stated that: \n19  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use a personal \n20  service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  The personal service \n21  assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.  The results of the \n22  assessment, our method for evaluating your personal care needs, and the cost of \n23  providing the additional personal service (the “Personal Service Rate”) will be shared \n24  with you. \n25  The Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff assistance that Ms. JESTRABEK-HART \n26  requires and has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of staff assistance.  \n27  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART has also received and reviewed a variety of rate increase letters and \n28  invoices that list the fees for services BROOKDALE agreed its caregivers and other staff would \n    62   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 64 of 100\n \n1  provide to her. \n2  172.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s \n3  representations in the RESIDENCY AGREEMENT, invoices and rate increase letters as \n4  statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and \n5  staff BROOKDALE Scotts Valley in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the \n6  services that BROOKDALE promised and for which Ms. JESTRABEK-HART was paying.  \n7  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART relied on these representations in making the decision to enter \n8  BROOKDALE Scotts Valley.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to Ms. JESTRABEK-HART at \n9  any time prior to her admission nor has it disclosed since that time that its corporate policy and \n10  procedure of providing predetermined staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from \n11  providing the care and services residents have been promised and places all residents at a \n12  substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given \n13  day. If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to Ms. JESTRABEK-HART prior to or \n14  early in her residency, she would have looked for another facility and would not have agreed to \n15  pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE. \n16  173.  When Ms. JESTRABEK-HART moved in to BROOKDALE, her “basic service \n17  rate” was approximately $3,700 per month.  In addition, Ms. JESTRABEK-HART would pay a \n18  monthly fee of $750 for assistance showering at least four times per week and daily dressing and \n19  undressing.  These personal care services were among the principal reasons Ms. JESTRABEK-\n20  HART sought to live in an assisted-living setting.   Over and above these monthly payments, \n21  BROOKDALE required Ms. JESTRABEK-HART to pay approximately $1,350 in move-in \n22  fees. \n23  174.  Despite these hefty monthly rates and move-in fees, BROOKDALE began to \n24  increase Ms. JESTRABEK-HART’s basic service rate just months after her arrival and at least \n25  annually thereafter.  By January 2018, BROOKDALE had increased Ms. JESTRABEK-HART’s \n26  basic service rate to $4,477, a 21% increase above her initial rate of $3,700 in just over two \n27  years.  In January 2018, BROOKDALE increased Ms. JESTRABEK-HART’s fee for assistance \n28  with dressing and showering from $750 to $834 per month, an 11.2% increase. \n    63   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 65 of 100\n \n1  175.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART uses an electric wheelchair and cane for mobility, and \n2  many common areas at BROOKDALE Scotts Valley are difficult or dangerous for her and \n3  others with mobility disabilities to access.  A number of doors that connect common indoor \n4  space to outdoor courtyards are heavy and difficult to open.  Several doors to laundry rooms and \n5  bathrooms in common spaces are also heavy and difficult to open.  Attempting to open these \n6  doors is dangerous for Ms. JESTRABEK-HART, as the weight of the door could injure her \n7  directly or cause her to fall. \n8  176.  Lack of safety precautions in laundry rooms at BROOKDALE Scotts Valley \n9  present unreasonable risk to residents with mobility disabilities.  On one occasion, Ms. \n10  JESTRABEK-HART tripped getting up from her wheelchair and fell onto the floor of the \n11  laundry room.  This laundry room is in a secluded corner of the facility enclosed by a heavy door \n12  and lacks emergency pull cords for residents to use in case of a fall.  Accordingly, Ms. \n13  JESTRABEK-HART had no way to summon help.  Fortunately, another individual whom Ms. \n14  JESTRABEK-HART believes to have been a resident was nearby and found Ms. JESTRABEK-\n15  HART on the floor.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART informed BROOKDALE of the need for \n16  emergency pull cords in the laundry after her fall, but BROOKDALE has taken no action.  \n17  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART continues to do her own laundry.  BROOKDALE’s failure to remedy \n18  the dangerous conditions in the laundry rooms at BROOKDALE Scotts Valley puts Ms. \n19  JESTRABEK-HART at continuing risk of serious injury. \n20  177.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART enjoys getting out of the BROOKDALE Scotts Valley \n21  facility and participating in off-site activities.  She had been able to take her electric wheelchair \n22  on a bus provided by her previous assisted-living residence.  Prior to moving into \n23  BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, Ms. JESTRABECK-HART looked at BROOKDALE’s website \n24  and saw that BROOKDALE offered free bus transportation to doctor’s visits, social outings and \n25  other offsite activities.  That service was among the major selling points for Ms. JESTRABEK-\n26  HART, and she relied on BROOKDALE’s representations that she would be able to participate \n27  in outings on the bus.  After moving in, she was surprised to learn that the transportation \n28  schedule was very limited and that BROOKDALE would not allow her to take her electric \n    64   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 66 of 100\n \n1  wheelchair on the bus.  Her electric wheelchair is Ms. JESTRABEK-HART’s primary means of \n2  personal transportation and is necessary for her to participate on shopping trips and other outings \n3  that require mobility upon arrival.  BROOKDALE has proposed that Ms. JESTRABEK-HART \n4  use a non-motorized wheelchair on these outings, but that would leave Ms. JESTRABEK-HART \n5  stranded upon arrival because she needs an electric wheelchair for mobility.   \n6  178.  BROOKDALE’s understaffing and failure to plan for emergencies has also \n7  negatively affected Ms. JESTRABEK-HART.  On one occasion, a power outage caused the \n8  elevators to cease to function, stranding Ms. JESTRABEK-HART, whose room is on the \n9  facility’s second floor, on a lower level.  BROOKDALE staff helped some residents get up to \n10  their rooms, but were unable to help Ms. JESTRABEK-HART and other residents who are \n11  wheelchair users.  She and other residents with mobility disabilities waited for three to four \n12  hours before firefighters arrived to assist those who could not walk up the stairs.  Because of \n13  BROOKDALE’s inadequate staffing and emergency planning, many residents were stranded \n14  away from their rooms late into the night.  \n15  179.  While the power was out, Ms. JESTRABEK-HART was unable to use her \n16  continuous positive airway pressure (“CPAP”) machine, which she requires to sleep due to sleep \n17  apnea.  BROOKDALE Scotts Valley had only one electrical outlet that was generator-powered, \n18  which was located on the first floor near the nurse’s office.  As a result, the outlet was not \n19  accessible to Ms. JESTRABEK-HART.  BROOKDALE staff did not attempt to connect \n20  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART’s CPAP machine to a generator-powered outlet. \n21  180.  While Ms. JESTRABEK-HART does not require assistance to get to and from \n22  meals, she has witnessed those who do need assistance wait for long periods before a staff \n23  member is available to help.  On one occasion, Ms. JESTRABEK-HART and others waited with \n24  a resident who was left in the lunchroom for over an hour and a half following the end of the \n25  meal before she received the assistance she needed to return to her room. \n26  181.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART requires assistance with dressing and bathing and \n27  currently pays BROOKDALE $834 per month for these services.  When deciding whether to \n28  move in to BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, among the items most important to Ms. JESTRABEK-\n    65   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 67 of 100\n \n1  HART was that she receive assistance showering at least four times per week, and she relied on \n2  BROOKDALE’s representation that it would be able to meet this need.  Ms. JESTRABEK-\n3  HART usually informs BROOKDALE staff after dinner that she is ready to shower.  She \n4  frequently waits for two to three hours before a staff member can assist her.  On multiple \n5  occasions, Ms. JESTRABEK-HART has waited so long that she has gone to sleep only to be \n6  awakened by a staff member who has finally come to provide the necessary assistance.  Other \n7  times, BROOKDALE has canceled a previously scheduled shower altogether. \n8  182.  With respect to assistance dressing, Ms. JESTREBEK-HART has asked for \n9  BROOKDALE staff to come to help her around the time she wakes at 7:00 a.m.  Often, \n10  however, she will wait until 8:30 a.m. or 9:00 a.m. before staff arrive to assist her.  Similarly, \n11  she often waits for long periods for assistance undressing in the evenings.  On several occasions \n12  when help has not come, Ms. JESTREBEK-HART has slept in her clothes and shoes, which can \n13  cause pain in her feet and make it otherwise difficult to get comfortable.  BROOKDALE staff \n14  has told her, often in the evening around 8:30 p.m. and sometimes in the morning around 7:00 \n15  a.m., that these delays occur because only one staff member is on duty to meet the needs of 150 \n16  residents.   \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n17 \n18  183.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all persons \n19  similarly situated and seek class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n20  23(b)(2) and/or (b)(3) as set forth below. \n21  184.  Class Definitions. \n22  Plaintiffs STACIA STINER, HELEN CARLSON, LAWRENCE QUINLAN; EDWARD \n23  BORIS; RALPH SCHMIDT; PATRICIA LINDSTROM as successor-in-interest to the Estate of \n24  ARTHUR LINDSTROM; and BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART seek to represent the following \n25  three classes: \n26  RESIDENTS WITH MOBILITY OR VISUAL DISABILITIES CLASS:  All persons with \n27  disabilities who use wheelchairs, scooters, canes or other mobility aids or who have visual \n28  disabilities and who reside or have resided at a residential care facility for the elderly \n    66   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

The CLASS PERIOD is defined as commencing three years prior to the filing of \n14  this action for the RESIDENTS WITH MOBILITY OR VISUAL DISABILITIES CLASS and \n15  commencing on May 16, 2015 for the RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES CLASS and the \n16  FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS CLASS. \n17  186.  Excluded from the above-referenced class are the officers, directors, and \n18  employees of BROOKDALE, and any of Defendants’ shareholders or other persons who hold a \n19  financial interest in BROOKDALE.  Also excluded is any judge assigned to hear this case (or \n20  any spouse or family member of any assigned judge), or any juror selected to hear this case. \n21  187.  This action is brought as a class action and may properly be so maintained \n22  pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and applicable case law.  In addition to \n23  declaratory and injunctive relief, this action seeks class-wide damages pursuant to California \n24  Civil Code § 52(a) in the amount of $4,000 per class member based on Defendants’ wrongful \n25  policy and practice of failing to provide residents with disabilities with full and equal access to \n26  and enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities, privileges, and/or advantages of \n27  BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities as alleged herein.  It also seeks class-wide statutory \n28  and punitive damages based on Defendants’ misrepresentations, misleading statements, and \n    67   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 69 of 100\n \n1  material omissions, including $5,000 per class member pursuant to California Civil Code \n2  § 1780(b). This action also seeks treble damages pursuant to both California Civil Code § 52(a) \n3  and California Civil Code § 3345(b)(2) and (3).  This action does not seek recovery for personal \n4  injuries or emotional distress that may have been caused by Defendants’ conduct alleged herein. \n5  188.  Ascertainability.  Members of the proposed Class are identifiable and \n6  ascertainable.  BROOKDALE retains admission contracts, resident service plans, and billing \n7  statements for all persons who currently reside or resided at BROOKDALE facilities during the \n8  CLASS PERIOD. \n9  189.  Impracticability of Joinder (Numerosity of the Class).  The members of the \n10  proposed class are so numerous that joinder of all such persons is impracticable and the \n11  disposition of their claims in a class action is a benefit both to the parties and to this Court.  On \n12  information and belief, the number of persons in this case exceeds 5,000 persons.  The number \n13  of persons in the class and their identities and addresses may be ascertained from Defendants’ \n14  records. \n15  190.  Questions of Fact and Law Common to the Class.  All members of the class \n16  have been and continue to be denied their civil rights to full and equal access to, and use and \n17  enjoyment of, the services and facilities operated by the BROOKDALE because of the \n18  violations of disability nondiscrimination laws, the CLRA, and Elder Abuse laws alleged herein.  \n19  There are numerous questions of law and fact common to the class, including, but not limited to, \n20  the following: \n21  a.  Whether BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities are public \n22  accommodations within the meaning of Title III of the ADA; \n23  b.  Whether BROOKDALE and its assisted living facilities are business \n24  establishments within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act; \n25  c.  Whether BROOKDALE constructed or altered any of its assisted living \n26  facilities after January 26, 1993; \n27  d.  Whether BROOKDALE’s facilities that were newly constructed or altered \n28  between January 26, 1993 and March 15, 2012 comply with the \n    68   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

Whether BROOKDALE has removed physical access barriers where doing \n9  so was readily achievable as required by Title III of the ADA; \n10  h.  Whether Plaintiffs are being denied full and equal access to and enjoyment \n11  of BROOKDALE’s goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or \n12  accommodations; \n13  i.  Whether Plaintiffs requested that BROOKDALE make reasonable \n14  modifications in policies, practices and/or procedures by providing its \n15  facilities with a sufficient number of adequately trained staff to ensure that \n16  residents with disabilities receive full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n17  the services specified in BROOKDALE’s own resident assessments; \n18  j.  Whether Plaintiffs’ requested modification in policies, practices or \n19  procedures is reasonable; \n20  k.  Whether Plaintiffs’ requested modification in policies, practices or \n21  procedures is necessary to ensure that residents with disabilities have full \n22  and equal access to and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s goods, services, \n23  facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations as required by Title \n24  III of the ADA; \n25  l.  Whether BROOKDALE has provided Plaintiffs with full and equal access \n26  to and enjoyment of its transportation services and activities as required by \n27  Title III of the ADA; \n28  m.

Whether BROOKDALE, by its actions and omissions alleged herein, has \n4  engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against Plaintiffs and \n5  other residents with disabilities in violation of the ADA and the Unruh Civil \n6  Rights Act; \n7  o.  Whether BROOKDALE has violated and continues to violate the Consumer \n8  Legal Remedies Act, California Civil Code §§ 1750 et seq., by promising \n9  residents that it will provide care and services including those identified by \n10  resident assessments, when BROOKDALE knows that its corporate policy \n11  and procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes \n12  BROOKDALE from providing the care and services residents have been \n13  promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not \n14  receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day; \n15  p.  Whether BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements and \n16  omissions regarding the staffing of its facilities as alleged herein were and \n17  are material to the reasonable consumer; \n18  q.  Whether by making the misrepresentations, misleading statements and \n19  material omissions alleged in this Complaint, BROOKDALE violated and \n20  continues to violate California Business & Professions Code §§ 17200, et. \n21  seq. (“UCL”); \n22  r.  Whether BROOKDALE had exclusive knowledge of material facts not \n23  known or reasonably accessible to the Plaintiffs and the class; \n24  s.  Whether the Plaintiffs, the class, and the consuming public were likely to be \n25  deceived by the foregoing concealment and omission; \n26  t.  Whether the Plaintiffs, the class, and the consuming public have a \n27  reasonable expectation that BROOKDALE will provide staffing at its \n28  facilities to meet the aggregate care needs of the residents at its facilities; \n    70   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL.

Whether BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, its misleading statements, its \n2  failures to disclose and its concealment of its true policies, procedures, and \n3  practices regarding how it staffs its facilities violated the CLRA and the \n4  UCL; \n5  v.  Whether BROOKDALE has engaged and continues to engage in a pattern \n6  and practice of unfair and deceptive conduct in connection with the \n7  management, administration, and operation of its California assisted living \n8  facilities; \n9  w.  Whether BROOKDALE has violated and continues to violate the UCL by \n10  violating the CLRA, ADA, Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Welfare and \n11  Institutions Code § 15610.30, and Cal. Health & Safety Code §§ 1569.157 \n12  and 1569.158 during the CLASS PERIOD; \n13  x.  Whether BROOKDALE has committed financial elder abuse under \n14  California Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.30 by taking, secreting, \n15  appropriating, obtaining, and/or retaining money from elders and dependent \n16  adults for a wrongful use and/or with the intent to defraud them; \n17  y.

The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the \n23  proposed classes.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed classes in the \n24  following ways: 1) Plaintiffs are members of the proposed classes; 2) Plaintiffs’ claims arise \n25  from the same uniform corporate policies, procedures, practices and course of conduct on the \n26  part of BROOKDALE; 3) Plaintiffs’ claims are based on the same legal and remedial theories as \n27  those of the proposed classes and involve similar factual circumstances; 4) the injuries suffered \n28  by the named Plaintiffs are similar to the injuries suffered by the proposed class members; and \n    71   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL.

Adequacy.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the \n3  interests of the classes.  They have no interests adverse to the interests of other members of the \n4  class and have retained counsel who are competent and experienced in litigating complex class \n5  actions, including large-scale disability rights and senior care class action cases. \n6  193.  Predominance.  With respect to Plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA, the Unruh \n7  Civil Rights Act, the CLRA, the UCL, and the Elder Abuse Act, class certification is appropriate \n8  under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) because questions of law or fact common to the \n9  class members predominate over any questions affecting individual members of the putative \n10  classes. \n11  194.  Superiority.  A class action is superior to other methods for the fair and efficient \n12  adjudication of this controversy because, inter alia: 1) individual claims by the class members \n13  would be impracticable because the costs of pursuit of such claims would far exceed what any \n14  individual class member has at stake; 2) relatively little individual litigation has been \n15  commenced over the controversies alleged in this Complaint and individual class members are \n16  unlikely to have an interest in separately prosecuting and controlling individual actions; 3) the \n17  concentration of litigation of these claims in one forum will achieve efficiency and promote \n18  judicial economy; 4) the proposed classes are manageable, and no difficulties are likely to be \n19  encountered in the management of this class action that would preclude its maintenance as a \n20  class action; 5) the proposed class members are readily identifiable from Defendants’ own \n21  records; and 6) prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the proposed class \n22  would create the risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members \n23  of the proposed classes that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for \n24  BROOKDALE. \n25  195.  The Class Meets the Requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26  23(b)(2).  BROOKDALE has acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \n27  class, making the declaratory and injunctive relief sought on behalf of the class as a whole \n28  appropriate. \n    72   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 74 of 100\n \n \n1  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n2  (Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.) \n(On behalf of Plaintiffs, the RESIDENTS WITH MOBILITY OR VISION \n3  DISABILITIES CLASS and the RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES CLASS) \n4  196.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n5  paragraphs of this Complaint. \n6  197.  Congress enacted the ADA upon finding, among other things, that “society has \n7  tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities” and that such forms of \n8  discrimination continue to be a “serious and pervasive social problem.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a) \n9  (2). \n10  198.  Congress explicitly stated that the purpose of the ADA is to provide “a clear and \n11  comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with \n12  disabilities” and “clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination \n13  against individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1)-(2). \n14  199.  Title III of the ADA provides in pertinent part: “[N]o individual shall be \n15  discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, \n16  services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public \n17  accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or leases to, or operates a place of public \n18  accommodation.”  42 U.S.C. § 12182. \n19  200.  At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiffs STACIA STINER, HELEN \n20  CARLSON, LAWRENCE QUINLAN; EDWARD BORIS; RALPH SCHMIDT; ARTHUR \n21  LINDSTROM; and BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART were and remain qualified individuals with \n22  disabilities within the meaning of the ADA. \n23  201.  Defendants are each a “private entity,” as defined under 42 U.S.C. § 12181(6).  \n24  They own, operate and/or manage approximately 89 assisted living facilities in California.  \n25  202.  Brookdale’s assisted living facilities provide services to its residents, including \n26  but not limited to, assistance with managing and taking medication, housekeeping, laundry, \n27  dressing, bathing, toileting, hygiene, food preparation, and transportation.  BROOKDALE staff \n28  include caregivers, certified nursing assistants (CNAs), and a licensed nurse working in the \n    73   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 75 of 100\n \n1  facility or on-call 24 hours per day, seven days per week, to allow ongoing monitoring of \n2  residents’ health status.  These facilities are “public accommodations” pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n3  § 12181(7).  BROOKDALE is subject to Title III of the ADA and its corresponding regulations. \n4  203.  As alleged above in greater detail, BROOKDALE has violated Title III of the \n5  ADA in the following ways. \n6  Failure to Provide Reasonable Modifications in Staffing Policies, Practices and Procedures \n7  204.  BROOKDALE has a policy and practice of staffing its assisted living facilities \n8  based on pre-set corporate labor budgets and profit margins without regard for residents’ needs.  \n9  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing its assisted living facilities in order to \n10  minimize its labor expenses and maximize its corporate profits has resulted in facilities that are \n11  chronically understaffed, and in which skeletal levels of staffing make it commonplace for \n12  residents with disabilities to go without the services, goods, facilities, privileges, advantages or \n13  accommodations for which they have paid.  For example, staff are often unavailable or unable to \n14  assist residents with disabilities with activities of daily living including, inter alia, bathing, \n15  showering, toileting, transferring, taking medications, dressing, dining, and housekeeping.  In \n16  addition, residents with disabilities are often denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n17  social and recreational activities, as well as transportation to off-site locations for appointments \n18  and other activities, because of the lack of a sufficient number of trained staff to assist residents \n19  with disabilities to participate in these activities. \n20  205.  Plaintiffs have requested that BROOKDALE make reasonable modifications in \n21  policies, practices, or procedures as required by Title III of the ADA.  Plaintiffs have requested \n22  that BROOKDALE provides its facilities with a sufficient number of adequately trained staff to \n23  ensure that residents with disabilities are provided with full and equal access to and enjoyment \n24  of the services specified in BROOKDALE’s own resident assessments.  Among other things, \n25  and without limitation, BROOKDALE should increase its level of trained staff in its assisted \n26  living facilities such that residents with disabilities are not required to wait for more than five \n27  minutes for a substantive response to their call pendants.  A substantive response means actual \n28  action taken to address the resident’s need, rather than a staff member passing by the resident’s \n    74   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 76 of 100\n \n1  room to say that they will return later. \n2  206.  Such reasonable modifications in BROOKDALE’s policies, practices and \n3  procedures are necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs and the members of the putative Residents with \n4  Disabilities Class receive full and equal access to and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s services, \n5  including assistance with, inter alia, bathing, showering, toileting, transferring, taking \n6  medications, dressing, dining, and housekeeping.  In addition, such modifications are necessary \n7  to ensure that Plaintiffs and the members of the putative Residents with Disabilities Class have \n8  full and equal access to and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s social and recreational activities, and \n9  transportation to off-site locations for appointments and other activities.  Unless and until \n10  BROOKDALE makes this requested reasonable modification in policies, practices, and \n11  procedures, Plaintiffs and the members of the putative Residents with Disabilities Class will \n12  continue to be denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities, \n13  privileges, advantages and accommodations that BROOKDALE claims to provide to all of its \n14  residents, whether disabled or nondisabled. \n15  207.  Plaintiffs’ requested modification in policies, practices or procedures is eminently \n16  reasonable in that BROOKDALE already charges residents with disabilities for, and residents \n17  with disabilities pay to receive, the services specified in BROOKDALE’s own resident \n18  agreements and resident assessments, including inter alia, assistance with activities of daily \n19  living such as mobility, bathing, showering, toileting, transferring, taking medications, dressing, \n20  dining, and housekeeping, as well as participating in BROOKDALE’s social and recreational \n21  activities whether on-site or off-site. \n22  208.  The requested modification in policies, practices or procedures will not make any \n23  alteration (much less a fundamental alteration) in the nature of BROOKDALE’s goods and \n24  services.  Rather, Plaintiffs merely seek to ensure that BROOKDALE provides a sufficient \n25  number of adequately trained staff to provide its residents with disabilities with full and equal \n26  access to and enjoyment of the types of services and goods that BROOKDALE already promises \n27  to provide to its residents in its normal course of business.  Thus, the requested reasonable \n28  modification in policy, practice or procedure would not change the nature or type of services and \n    75   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 77 of 100\n \n1  goods that BROOKDALE sells to the public. \n2  209.  The requested reasonable modification would impose only a minimal burden on \n3  BROOKDALE.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that the staff who provide \n4  BROOKDALE’s services are hourly employees who are paid an average of $10 to $14 per hour.  \n5  Increasing BROOKDALE’s skeletal night staffing and its minimal level of daytime staffing will \n6  only result in a moderate increase in BROOKDALE’s labor budget.  BROOKDALE will \n7  continue to be able to realize substantial gross profits each year in the multibillion dollar range. \n8  210.  Plaintiffs have repeatedly requested that BROOKDALE make reasonable \n9  modifications in policies, practices, or procedures by increasing the number of trained staff that \n10  it provides in its facilities.  Notwithstanding the reasonableness and necessity of such \n11  modifications, and notwithstanding the fact that BROOKDALE could significantly increase its \n12  staffing without changing the nature of its services, goods, facilities, privileges, advantages or \n13  accommodations, and could make such modifications without undue financial or administrative \n14  burdens, BROOKDALE has failed and refused to make any such modifications. \n15  211.  Plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA and the Unruh Act based on BROOKDALE’s \n16  failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures in staffing policies \n17  and practices are limited to circumstances and facts occurring on or after May 16, 2015. \n18  Physical Access Barriers \n19  212.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that many of Defendants’ facilities \n20  were designed and constructed after January 26, 1993, thus triggering access requirements under \n21  Title III of the ADA.  The ADA prohibits designing and constructing facilities for first \n22  occupancy after January 26, 1993 that are not readily accessible to and usable by individuals \n23  with disabilities when it was structurally practicable to do so.  42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1).  \n24  BROOKDALE has violated the ADA by designing and constructing their facilities in a manner \n25  that does not comply with federal disability access design standards including the Americans \n26  with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (“ADAAG”) and the 2010 ADA Standards for \n27  Accessible Design (“2010 ADA Standards”) even though it was structurally practicable to do so. \n28  213.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that Defendants’ facilities were altered \n    76   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 78 of 100\n \n1  after January 26, 1993, thus triggering access requirements under Title III of the ADA.  The \n2  ADA prohibits altering facilities after January 26, 1993 in a manner that is not readily accessible \n3  to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities when it was structurally practicable to do so.  42 \n4  U.S.C. § 12183(a)(2).  Here, Defendants violated the ADA by altering its assisted living \n5  facilities after January 26, 1993 in a manner that did not comply with the ADAAG or the 2010 \n6  ADA Standards even though it was structurally practicable to do so.  Specifically, Defendants \n7  have failed to ensure that the areas of alteration complied with the ADAAG or the 2010 ADA \n8  Standards, and that the path of travel to the areas of alteration complied with the ADAAG or the \n9  2010 ADA Standards. \n10  214.  Additionally, Defendants have failed to remove physical access barriers in their \n11  facilities which existed prior to January 26, 1993 when removal of those barriers was “readily \n12  achievable,” in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). \n13  215.  The removal of each of the barriers complained of by Plaintiffs herein was at all \n14  times “readily achievable” under the standards of §§ 12181 and 12182 of the ADA.  \n15  BROOKDALE could have removed each of the barriers alleged herein without much difficulty \n16  or expense within the meaning of Title III.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, BROOKDALE has \n17  failed and refused to do so. \n18  Transportation and Activities \n19  216.  BROOKDALE has violated Title III of the ADA by failing and refusing to \n20  provide Plaintiffs with full and equal access to and enjoyment of its transportation services to \n21  off-site activities and appointments.  BROOKDALE has a policy and practice of limiting the \n22  number of wheelchair users who may use transportation to off-site activities.  This limitation is \n23  not imposed on residents who do not use wheelchairs.  In addition, BROOKDALE has required \n24  residents with mobility disabilities to transfer from their wheelchairs into the seats in its shuttles, \n25  and has not permitted residents to remain in their wheelchairs.  BROOKDALE has done so \n26  despite the fact that many residents with mobility disabilities have great difficulty in transferring \n27  from their wheelchairs into the passenger seats in shuttles, and doing so is time consuming, \n28  physically exhausting and sometimes dangerous.  Further, on numerous occasions residents with \n    77   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 79 of 100\n \n1  mobility disabilities have been completely denied access to medical appointments, and other off-\n2  site appointments and activities, because BROOKDALE has failed to provide any accessible \n3  transportation to those appointments and activities. \n4  Evacuation Procedures \n5  217.  BROOKDALE has failed to provide or communicate to its residents with \n6  disabilities any specific or definitive emergency evacuation plan in the event of earthquake, fire \n7  or other emergency.  Defendants’ failure to do so constitutes a denial of full and equal access to \n8  and enjoyment of the services and facilities provided by BROOKDALE in violation of Title III \n9  of the ADA.  Many of BROOKDALE’s residents with disabilities are unable to exit the building \n10  without assistance from staff.  While some residents have been advised to remain in their rooms \n11  in the event of an emergency, in those instances in which an alarm has sounded, no one has \n12  come to their rooms to assist them or to inform them as to whether there is an emergency or just \n13  a drill. \n14  218.  The acts and omissions alleged herein constitute violations of Title III of the \n15  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181 et seq., and the regulations \n16  promulgated thereunder.  Defendants’ discriminatory conduct alleged herein includes, inter alia: \n17  a.  Failing to provide residents with disabilities the opportunity to participate in \n18  or benefit from BROOKDALE’s goods, services, facilities, privileges, \n19  advantages, and/or accommodations at its assisted living facilities in \n20  California, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(i); \n21  b.  Failing to provide residents with disabilities the opportunity to participate in \n22  or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and/or \n23  accommodations that are equal to that afforded to individuals without \n24  disabilities, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii); \n25  c.  Failing to provide the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, \n26  and/or accommodations at its assisted living facilities in California to \n27  residents with disabilities in the most integrated setting possible, in \n28  violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(B); \n    78   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 80 of 100\n \n1  d.  Utilizing standards, criteria and methods of administration that have the \n2  effect of discriminating against residents on the basis of their disabilities, in \n3  violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(D); \n4  e.  Imposing eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out residents \n5  with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying BROOKDALE’s assisted \n6  living facilities’ goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or \n7  accommodations, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i); \n8  f.  Failing to make reasonable modifications in its policies, practices, and \n9  procedures which are necessary for its residents with disabilities to enjoy \n10  and access BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities’ goods, services, \n11  facilities, privileges, advantages and/or accommodations, in violation of 42 \n12  U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); \n13  g.  Failing to remove architectural barriers in those facilities constructed prior \n14  to January 26, 1993 and not altered after that date where such removal is \n15  readily achievable, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv); \n16  h.  Failing to design and construct facilities first occupied after January 26, \n17  1993 such that they are readily accessible to and usable by persons with \n18  disabilities, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1); \n19  i.  Performing alterations after January 26, 1993 that affect the usability of its \n20  facilities or a part of its facilities, while failing to ensure that the altered \n21  portions and the path of travel to those altered portions are readily \n22  accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, in violation of 42 \n23  U.S.C. § 12183(a)(2); and \n24  j.  Failing to operate BROOKDALE’s transportation services such that they \n25  ensure a level of service to persons with disabilities that is equivalent to that \n26  provided to persons without disabilities, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \n27  § 12182)(b)(2)(C)(i). \n28  219.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiffs have \n    79   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 81 of 100\n \n1  suffered, and continue to suffer irreparable harm including humiliation, hardship and anxiety due \n2  to Defendants’ failure to provide full and equal access to and enjoyment of Defendants’ \n3  facilities, services, goods, privileges, advantages and/or accommodations. \n4  220.  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n5  declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses \n6  incurred in bringing this action. \n \n7  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n8  (Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq.) \n(On behalf of Plaintiffs, the RESIDENTS WITH MOBILITY OR VISION DISABILITIES \n9  CLASS and the RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES CLASS) \n10  221.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n11  paragraphs of this Complaint. \n12  222.  California Civil Code § 51(b) provides in pertinent part that “All persons within \n13  the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their…disability or medical \n14  condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or \n15  services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.” \n16  223.  Pursuant to California Civil Code § 51(f), a violation of the ADA also constitutes \n17  a violation of California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq. \n18  224.  Defendants own, operate and/or manage business establishments within the \n19  meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.  Defendants are each a public accommodation whose \n20  services and facilities are open to the general public. \n21  225.  Defendants provide services, privileges, advantages and accommodations to the \n22  general public.  Defendants have failed and refused to provide Plaintiffs with full and equal \n23  access to and enjoyment of the benefits of their goods, services, facilities, benefits, advantages, \n24  and accommodations, and have done so by reason of Plaintiffs’ disabilities. \n25  226.  Defendants have discriminated against persons with disabilities in violation of \n26  California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq. by failing to operate their facilities and services in full \n27  compliance with the requirements of the ADA as set forth above. \n28  227.  Defendants, by their actions and inactions alleged in this Complaint, have directly \n    80   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

Plaintiffs’ claims under the Unruh Act based on BROOKDALE’s failure to make \n3  reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures in staffing policies and practices \n4  are limited to circumstances and facts occurring on or after May 16, 2015. \n5  229.  The actions of Defendants were and are in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights \n6  Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51 et seq., and therefore Plaintiffs are also entitled to statutory damages, \n7  injunctive relief and reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. \n \n8  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n9  (Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750 et seq.) \n(On behalf of Plaintiffs and the FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENT CLASS) \n10 \n230.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n11 \nparagraphs of this Complaint. \n12 \n231.  Plaintiffs and the members of the putative False or Misleading Statements Class \n13 \nare “consumer[s]” within the meaning of California Civil Code § 1761(d).  They are also “senior \n14 \ncitizen[s]” and/or “[d]isabled person[s]” within the meaning of California Civil Code § 1761(f) \n15 \nand (g). \n16 \n232.  Defendants are each a “person” as defined under California Civil Code § 1761(c).  \n17 \nThe assisted living services that Defendants have promised to provide Plaintiffs are “[s]ervices” \n18 \nwithin the meaning of the California Civil Code § 1761(b).  The agreement by Defendants to \n19 \nprovide assisted living services in return for payment of monthly fees by each of the Plaintiffs \n20 \nconstitutes a “transaction” under California Civil Code § 1761(e). \n21 \n233.  In Defendants’ uniform resident contracts presented to prospective residents and \n22 \ntheir family members, Defendants represented and continue to represent that BROOKDALE will \n23 \nassess each resident and provide the basic services, personal services, and select and therapeutic \n24 \nservices it has determined are needed.  That same representation is made in BROOKDALE’s re-\n25 \nevaluation of residents, rate increase letters, letters regarding the merger, letters regarding the \n26 \nconversion to a new personal assessment system, corporate website statements, invoices, and \n27 \nother standardized corporate promotional materials.  These uniform corporate representations are \n28 \n    81   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

As alleged herein, \n2  Plaintiffs and the putative class members reasonably expected based on these representations \n3  that BROOKDALE would provide sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained staff at \n4  its facilities to ensure that all residents receive the services they have been promised and for \n5  which they are paying. \n6  234.  Contrary to its representations regarding the provision of basic services, personal \n7  services, and select and therapeutic services, BROOKDALE knows that the policies and \n8  practices it uses to staff its facilities—most notably, its policy and practice of using \n9  predetermined labor budgets designed to meet corporate profit targets, goals, and margins \n10  without regard to residents’ needs—preclude it from providing its residents all of the care and \n11  services they have been promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not \n12  receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day.  BROOKDALE did not intend \n13  to provide and has no intention of providing sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained \n14  staff at its facilities to ensure that all residents receive these services.  BROOKDALE does not \n15  disclose and conceals this material fact from the residents, their family members, and the general \n16  public. \n17  235.  The named Plaintiffs, their family members and powers of attorney, the putative \n18  class members, and reasonable consumers considered material BROOKDALE’s \n19  misrepresentations and misleading statements that it will provide residents the basic services, \n20  personal services, and select and therapeutic services they need and for which they are paying.  \n21  If the named Plaintiffs had known the true facts about BROOKDALE’s staffing policies and \n22  procedures, they would not have agreed to enter or stay in a BROOKDALE facility or to place \n23  their relatives in a BROOKDALE facility, or would have paid less money.  If the putative class \n24  members had known the true facts, they would in all reasonable probability not have agreed to \n25  enter or remain in a BROOKDALE facility or to place their relatives in a BROOKDALE \n26  facility, or would have paid less money to BROOKDALE. \n27  236.  The facts that BROOKDALE misrepresents, fails to disclose and actively \n28  conceals are material and are likely to deceive the reasonable consumer.  Reasonable consumers, \n    82   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

Residents and their family members would consider material BROOKDALE’s \n6  uniform corporate policy and procedure of basing its staffing on fixed budgets and profit \n7  margins resulting in staffing that is inadequate to meet residents’ needs, as identified by \n8  BROOKDALE itself through periodic personal service assessments.  Residents and their family \n9  members could not reasonably have been expected to learn or discover these non-disclosed facts, \n10  and in fact, BROOKDALE has affirmatively concealed them. \n11  238.  Since May 16, 2015, BROOKDALE has violated and continues to violate the \n12  CLRA, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750 et seq., in at least the following respects: \n13  a.  In violation of § 1770(a)(5), BROOKDALE has misrepresented, failed to \n14  disclose and concealed the true characteristics and/or quantities of services \n15  provided at its facilities in California; \n16  b.  In violation of § 1770(a)(7), BROOKDALE has misrepresented, failed to \n17  disclose and concealed the true standard, quality and/or grade of services \n18  provided at its facilities in California; \n19  c.  In violation of § 1770(a)(9), in BROOKDALE’s standard resident \n20  admission contracts and elsewhere, BROOKDALE has falsely advertised \n21  that it will provide basic services and the assistance specified by each \n22  resident’s personal service assessment and which corresponds to that \n23  resident’s Personal Service Plan, knowing that BROOKDALE does not \n24  intend to provide the services as advertised; and \n25  d.  In violation of § 1770(a)(14), BROOKDALE has represented that the \n26  agreement signed by residents and/or their responsible parties, and under \n27  which they pay their monthly rate, confers on residents the right to reside in \n28  a facility that provides the basic services, personal services, and select and \n    83   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 85 of 100\n \n1  therapeutic services that residents have been promised and are paying for, \n2  when in fact, BROOKDALE knows that the policies and practices it uses to \n3  staff its facilities preclude it from providing its residents all of the care and \n4  services they have been promised and places all residents in an inherent and \n5  substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have \n6  paid for on any given day. \n7  239.  These misrepresentations, misleading statements, acts, practices, and omissions \n8  by BROOKDALE are and were intended to induce and lure elderly and dependent adult \n9  residents and their family members into agreeing to be admitted to BROOKDALE’s facilities \n10  and to pay community and monthly fees. \n11  240.  BROOKDALE made the misrepresentations and misleading statements alleged \n12  herein through various uniform means of communication, including without limitation, the \n13  admission agreement; subsequent agreements based on updated Personal Service Plans; letters to \n14  residents regarding the merger between BROOKDALE and Emeritus, the implementation of \n15  BROOKDALE’s new personal service system, and rate increases; standardized corporate \n16  marketing and promotional materials; Defendants’ website; invoices; and other written corporate \n17  materials disseminated to the public in connection with Defendants’ services.  These \n18  representations and misleading statements were made directly to the named Plaintiffs, putative \n19  class members and their family members and/or responsible parties by BROOKDALE in the \n20  uniform means of communication listed above. \n21  241.  BROOKDALE failed to disclose and concealed from Plaintiffs, the putative class \n22  members, and their family members, that BROOKDALE staffs its facility using predetermined \n23  labor budgets designed to meet corporate profit targets, goals, and margins without regard to \n24  residents’ needs; that these policies and practices preclude it from providing its residents all of \n25  the care and services they have been promised and places all residents at an inherent and \n26  substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given \n27  day; and that BROOKDALE did not intend to provide and has no intention of providing \n28  sufficient qualified and adequately trained staff at its facilities to ensure that all residents receive \n    84   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 86 of 100\n \n1  these services. \n2  242.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge of materials facts not \n3  known to the named Plaintiffs, class members or the general public at the time of the subject \n4  transactions and actively concealed those material facts. \n5  243.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge that its corporate policy \n6  and procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities preclude BROOKDALE from \n7  providing the care and services for which it charges its residents and places all residents at a \n8  substantial risk that on any given day they will not receive the care and services for which they \n9  have paid.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge that its policies and \n10  procedures for staffing its facilities pose a heightened health and safety risk to the named \n11  Plaintiffs and class members.  Defendants intentionally concealed, suppressed and/or failed to \n12  disclose the true facts with the intent to defraud the named Plaintiffs and putative class members.  \n13  The named Plaintiffs and putative class members did not know these material undisclosed facts \n14  and could not reasonably have been expected to discover them. \n15  244.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs, the class \n16  members, and members of the general public (including without limitation persons admitted to \n17  and/or residing in the facilities, and their family members and/or responsible parties) have been \n18  harmed and continue to be harmed.  Among other things, they paid money to Defendants to \n19  enter the facilities and/or for services that were not provided or that were substandard to those \n20  promised by Defendants. \n21  245.  Plaintiffs sent BROOKDALE a notice to cure under California Civil Code \n22  § 1782(a), which was received by BROOKDALE on June 6, 2017.  More than 30 days have \n23  passed since BROOKDALE’s receipt, and BROOKDALE has not corrected or remedied the \n24  violations alleged in the notice and herein.   \n25  246.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs and the False or Misleading Statements Class members \n26  are entitled to no less than $1,000 in statutory damages pursuant to California Civil Code \n27  § 1780(a).  Moreover, as senior citizens and/or disabled persons, Plaintiffs and the False or \n28  Misleading Statements Class members are also entitled to statutory damages of $5,000 per class \n    85   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 87 of 100\n \n1  member pursuant to California Civil Code § 1780(b), as well as actual damages and restitution \n2  in an amount to be proven at trial.   \n3  247.  Plaintiffs and each of the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members \n4  are seniors and/or disabled persons as defined by California Civil Code § 1761(f) and (g).  \n5  Plaintiffs and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members have each suffered \n6  substantial economic harm.  Defendants knew that their conduct negatively impacted seniors and \n7  disabled persons.  Defendants’ conduct caused the named Plaintiffs and the putative False or \n8  Misleading Statements Class members to lose property set aside for personal care and \n9  maintenance and assets essential to their health and welfare.  Further, Plaintiffs and the putative \n10  False or Misleading Statements Class members are substantially more vulnerable than other \n11  members of the public to Defendants’ conduct because of their age, poor health, impaired \n12  understanding, restricted mobility and/or disabilities. \n13  248.  Plaintiffs additionally seek treble damages under California Civil Code § 3345, \n14  punitive damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, and all other relief the Court deems just \n15  and proper.  Excluded from Plaintiffs’ request are damages related to any personal injuries, \n16  emotional distress or wrongful death suffered by any member of the class. \n17  249.  Defendants’ conduct presents a continuing threat of substantial harm to the public \n18  in that, among other things, Defendants continue to make misleading statements about and \n19  conceal material facts about whether and how they provide basic, personal care, and select and \n20  therapeutic services at BROOKDALE facilities in California, as well as the fact that their \n21  staffing policies and procedures preclude them from providing residents the services they have \n22  been promised.  Despite these misrepresentations, BROOKDALE continues to induce elderly \n23  and vulnerable citizens to enter and remain in its facilities, which conduct irreparably harms \n24  Plaintiffs and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek an \n25  injunction that requires that BROOKDALE immediately cease the CLRA violations alleged \n26  herein regarding BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements, and material \n27  omissions, and to enjoin it from continuing to engage in any such acts or practices in the future.  \n28  Specifically, Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring BROOKDALE to disclose to Plaintiffs, the \n    86   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL.

Plaintiffs claims for violations of the CLRA are limited to misrepresentations, \n10  misleading statements, and failures to disclose that occurred on or after May 16, 2015. \n11  251.  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n12  declaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses \n13  incurred in bringing this action. \n14   \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15   \n(Elder Financial Abuse, Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30) \n16  (On behalf of PLAINTIFFS and the FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS CLASS) \n17  252.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n18  paragraphs of this Complaint. \n19  253.  Plaintiffs and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members are and \n20  at all times were “elders” as defined under California Welfare & Institutions Code § 15610.27 or \n21  “dependent adults” as defined under California Welfare & Institutions Code § 15610.23. \n22  254.  BROOKDALE represented to the named Plaintiffs, and/or their responsible \n23  parties, and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members, and/or their responsible \n24  parties, in standard agreements, service updates, monthly invoices, standardized corporate letters \n25  to residents and/or their responsible parties, and/or annual notification of rate increases, that \n26  BROOKDALE would provide care and assistance with activities of daily living, including but \n27  not limited to staffing 24 hours a day, dining services, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, \n28  and other basic services in exchange for community fees and monthly payments that it received \n    87   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

As \n4  a result, residents do not consistently receive all of the basic services BROOKDALE has \n5  promised them and for which they are paying BROOKDALE. \n6  255.  BROOKDALE further represented through these same corporate materials that \n7  BROOKDALE would provide personal services, including but not limited to assistance with \n8  bathing, toileting, grooming, dressing, transferring, and mobility, for additional monthly fees.  \n9  BROOKDALE represented that it would perform an assessment of each resident to identify \n10  needed personal services and an individualized service plan to deliver those services.  Yet \n11  BROOKDALE did not intend to and does not provide adequate staffing for personal services at \n12  its facilities.  Rather, it has a policy and practice of providing pre-determined facility staffing \n13  that does not change with increases in residents’ personal service needs.  This policy and \n14  practice precludes BROOKDALE from providing facility residents with all of the personal \n15  services BROOKDALE has promised them and for which they are paying BROOKDALE. \n16  256.  BROOKDALE further represented through these same corporate materials that \n17  BROOKDALE would provide select and therapeutic services to residents, including but not \n18  limited to emergency call pendants and associated services.  However, BROOKDALE did not \n19  and has no intention of providing sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained staff at its \n20  facilities to ensure that all residents receive these services.  As a result, facility residents do not \n21  consistently receive all of the select and therapeutic services BROOKDALE has promised them \n22  and for which they are paying BROOKDALE. \n23  257.  BROOKDALE knew or should have known that such conduct would likely be \n24  harmful to Plaintiffs and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members. \n25  258.  BROOKDALE knew or should have known that Plaintiffs and the putative False \n26  or Misleading Statements Class members had a right to the funds used to pay new resident \n27  community fees and monthly fees to BROOKDALE. \n28  259.  As such, BROOKDALE took, secreted, appropriated, obtained and/or retained \n    88   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

BROOKDALE’s conduct was despicable, fraudulent, reckless, and carried out \n4  with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights and safety of Plaintiffs and the members of \n5  the putative False or Misleading Statements Class. \n6  261.  Plaintiffs and putative False or Misleading Statements Class members also seek \n7  compensatory damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses, punitive damages, treble \n8  damages pursuant to California Civil Code § 3345, and all other remedies permitted by law.  \n9  Plaintiffs do not seek certification of any claims for damages related to any personal injuries, \n10  emotional distress, or wrongful death suffered by any member of the class. \n11  262.  Plaintiffs’ claims under Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30 are limited to \n12  circumstances and facts occurring on or after May 16, 2015. \n13  263.  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n14  declaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses \n15  incurred in bringing this action. \n \n16  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n17  (Unlawful, Unfair and Fraudulent Business Practices, \nCal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq.) \n18  (On behalf of Plaintiffs and all Proposed Classes) \n19  264.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n20  paragraphs of this Complaint. \n21  265.  BROOKDALE has engaged in unlawful business acts and practices.  Such acts \n22  and practices constitute unfair business practices in violation of California Business and \n23  Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq. \n24  266.  In particular, Defendants have engaged in unlawful business acts and practices by \n25  violating numerous laws, statutes and regulations including but not limited to: \n26  a.  Systematically and uniformly representing to the residents of its assisted \n27  living facilities in California, family members, and the public that \n28  Defendants will assess residents to determine their needs, and will provide \n    89   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL.

Failing to provide residents with disabilities full and equal enjoyment of \n9  BROOKDALE’s goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or \n10  accommodations at its assisted living facilities in California; failing to \n11  remove architectural barriers in those facilities constructed prior to January \n12  26, 1993 and not altered after that date where such removal is readily \n13  achievable; failing to design and construct facilities first occupied after \n14  January 26, 1993 such that they are readily accessible to and usable by \n15  persons with disabilities; and performing alterations after January 26, 1993 \n16  that affect the usability of its facilities or a part of its facilities, while failing \n17  to ensure that the altered portions and the path of travel to those altered \n18  portions are readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, all \n19  in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182 and Cal. Civ. Code § 51 et seq.; \n20  c.  Taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, and retaining the funds of elders \n21  and dependent adults for a wrongful use and/or with the intent to defraud in \n22  violation of California Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.30;  \n23  d.  Willfully interfering with the maintenance and promotion of a family \n24  council in violation of Cal. H&S Code § 1569.158; and \n25  e.  Willfully interfering with the maintenance and promotion of a resident \n26  council in violation of Cal. H&S Code § 1569.157. \n27  267.  By virtue of the conduct alleged herein, Defendants have also engaged in \n28  fraudulent business practices.  Members of the general public (including without limitation \n    90   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 92 of 100\n \n1  persons admitted to and/or residing in BROOKDALE’s California assisted living facilities \n2  during the CLASS PERIOD, and their family members and/or responsible parties) have been \n3  and are likely to be deceived by Defendants’ misrepresentations and failures to disclose as \n4  alleged herein. \n5  268.  The acts and practices of Defendants also constitute unfair business acts and \n6  practices within the meaning of California Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq., in that \n7  the conduct alleged herein is immoral, unscrupulous, and contrary to public policy, and the \n8  detriment and gravity of that conduct outweighs any benefits attributable to such conduct. \n9  269.  Defendants’ misrepresentations, misleading statements, acts, practices, and \n10  omissions were intended to induce and lure elderly and dependent adult residents and their \n11  family members into agreeing to be admitted to and remain at Defendants’ facilities and to pay a \n12  community fee and monthly rates to live in an assisted living facility that features sufficient \n13  levels of qualified and adequately trained staff to ensure that all residents receive the basic \n14  services, personal services, and select and therapeutic services for which they are paying. \n15  270.  Defendants made these misrepresentations and misleading statements through \n16  various uniform means of written corporate communications, including without limitation, the \n17  standardized Residency Agreement; subsequent agreements based on re-assessments of the \n18  resident; letters to residents regarding the merger between BROOKDALE and Emeritus, \n19  Defendants’ conversion to a new personal service system, and rate increases; invoices, \n20  marketing and promotional materials, Defendants’ corporate website and other materials \n21  disseminated to the public from its corporate headquarters in connection with Defendants’ \n22  services.  These representations were made directly to the named Plaintiffs, class members, and \n23  their family members and/or responsible parties by Defendants in the uniform means of \n24  communication listed above. \n25  271.  BROOKDALE concealed from Plaintiffs, the putative class members, and their \n26  family members that BROOKDALE’s staffing policies and procedures preclude it from \n27  providing its residents all of the care and services they have been promised and places all \n28  residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they \n    91   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL.

BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge of material facts not \n3  known to named Plaintiffs, putative class members or the general public at the time of the \n4  subject transactions and actively concealed these material facts. \n5  273.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge of its corporate policy and \n6  procedure.  Further, Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that Defendants’ officers, \n7  directors, and managers knew that Defendants’ failure to provide adequate staffing posed a \n8  substantial health and safety risk to the named Plaintiffs and class members.  BROOKDALE \n9  intentionally concealed, suppressed and/or failed to disclose the true facts with the intent to \n10  defraud the named Plaintiffs and putative class members.  The named Plaintiffs and the putative \n11  class members did not know these material undisclosed facts and could not reasonably have \n12  been expected to discover them. \n13  274.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs, the class \n14  members, and members of the general public (including without limitation persons admitted to \n15  and/or residing in the facilities, and their family members and/or responsible parties) have been \n16  harmed and continue to be harmed.  Among other things, they paid money to Defendants to \n17  enter the facilities and for services that were not provided or that were substandard to those \n18  promised by Defendants. \n19  275.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction that requires that Defendants immediately cease acts \n20  of unlawful, unfair and fraudulent business acts or practices as alleged herein, and to enjoin \n21  Defendants from continuing to engage in any such acts or practices in the future. \n22  276.  Plaintiffs’ claims under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 are limited to \n23  circumstances and facts occurring on or after May 16, 2015 to the extent they are based on \n24  Defendants’ failure to provide staff with adequate training and in sufficient numbers to provide \n25  their assisted living facility residents all of the care and services they have been promised. \n26  277.  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n27  declaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses \n28  incurred in bringing this action. \n    92   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n3  paragraphs of this Complaint. \n4  279.  Plaintiffs STACIA STINER, HELEN CARLSON, and BERNIE JESTRABEK-\n5  HART continue to live at a BROOKDALE assisted living facility.  Unless and until \n6  BROOKDALE brings its facilities into compliance with the requirements of the ADA and \n7  applicable federal disability access design standards, the above-named Plaintiffs will continue to \n8  be denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s facilities as a result of \n9  physical access barriers in violation of the ADA.  Moreover, unless and until Defendant \n10  BROOKDALE makes the requested reasonable modification in policies, practices and \n11  procedures set forth above with respect to the staffing of its facilities, Plaintiffs will continue to \n12  be denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities, privileges, \n13  advantages and accommodations provided to its residents by BROOKDALE.  In this regard, \n14  unless and until Defendants provide a sufficient number of adequately trained staff at their \n15  facilities, residents with disabilities will continue to suffer the denial and deprivation of basic \n16  services that are necessary to daily living, including assistance with bathing, showering, \n17  toileting, taking medications, transferring, dressing, dining, cleaning and laundry services.  \n18  Further, residents with disabilities will continue to be denied full and equal access to on-site and \n19  off-site social and recreational activities, and will be segregated and isolated in violation of the \n20  ADA’s integration mandate. \n21  280.  In addition, unless and until Defendants comply with the ADA, Plaintiffs \n22  STACIA STINER, HELEN CARLSON, and BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART will continue to \n23  suffer falls, and to be at risk of falls and/or serious physical injuries, as a result of Defendants’ \n24  failure and refusal to provide full and equal access to its facilities and services.  In this regard, \n25  Defendants must be enjoined to provide facilities that comply with applicable federal disability \n26  access standards, a sufficient number of staff who are adequately trained to assist residents with \n27  disabilities to prevent falls and to assist them if a fall takes place, and a functioning and effective \n28  pendant system so that residents can obtain prompt and effective assistance when they have \n    93   \n  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECL. AND INJ. RELIEF AND DAMAGES - Case No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 52   Filed 03/29/18   Page 95 of 100\n \n1  fallen and/or are at risk of other physical injuries.  Further, unless and until Defendants provide \n2  adequate emergency planning and evacuation procedures for residents with disabilities, \n3  Defendants will continue to place them at significant risk of serious injury and death. \n4  281.  Further, unless and until Defendants provide residents with disabilities with full \n5  and equal access to enjoyment of its transportation services, residents with disabilities will \n6  continue to be excluded from and denied access to off-site appointments and activities in \n7  violation of the ADA. \n8  282.  Additionally, unless and until BROOKDALE ceases its false and/or misleading \n9  statements regarding its services and discloses that its corporate staffing policies and practices \n10  preclude it from providing its residents the care and services they have been promised and places \n11  all residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services \n12  they have paid for on any given day, residents, their family members, their responsible parties \n13  and the general public will continue to be misled and will continue to expend very substantial \n14  sums of money for services, goods and facilities that are not as represented, and Defendants will \n15  continue to receive the benefits of their ill-gotten gains. \n16  283.  Finally, unless and until BROOKDALE is ordered to refrain from interfering \n17  with the maintenance and promotion of resident and family councils at its facilities, Plaintiffs \n18  will continue to suffer from retaliation against resident and family councils and their members \n19  and be subjected to BROOKDALE’s obstruction of the promotion and operation of said councils \n20  at its facilities. \n21  284.  A present and actual controversy exists regarding the respective rights and \n22  obligations of Plaintiffs and Defendants.  Plaintiffs desire a judicial determination of their rights \n23  and Defendants’ obligations in a declaration as to whether, and to what extent, the Defendants’ \n24  conduct violates applicable law. \n25  285.  Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that Plaintiffs \n26  may ascertain their rights.  Such a declaration is also necessary and appropriate to prevent \n27  further harm or infringement of Plaintiffs’ rights. \n28  286.

Nos. 94, 99 \n11 \nDefendants.   \na  12     \ntr in\nuoro 13  Defendants Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. and Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (collectively, “Brookdale”) filed a motion to stay proceedings pending its appeal of the Court’s \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  order denying Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration.  Dkt. No. 94.  Brookdale also filed a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  motion requesting the Court to certify for interlocutory appeal the question of whether Brookdale \nS d nr\nee 17  facilities are public accommodations under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (“ADA”).  Dkt. No. 99.  The Court finds that this matter is appropriate for disposition without oral \n19  argument and the matter is deemed submitted.  See Civil L.R. 7-1(b).  For the reasons discussed \n20  below, the Court DENIES the motion to stay proceedings and motion to certify for interlocutory \n21  appeal.    \n22  I.  BACKGROUND \n23  Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint against Brookdale for violations of the \n24  ADA, the Unruh Civil Rights Act (“Unruh Act”), the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California \n25  Business and Professions Code §§ 7200 et seq., and California Welfare and Institutions Code \n26  § 15610, based on the conditions of Brookdale’s assisted living facilities.1  Dkt. No. 52 (“SAC”).  \n27 \n                                                 \n1 As of the date of this Order, there are eight Plaintiffs: Stacia Stiner, Helen Carlson, Lawrence \n28 \nQuinlan, Edward Boris, Bernie Jestrabek-Hart, Arthur and Patricia Lindstrom, and Ralph Schmidt. \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 130   Filed 06/05/19   Page 2 of 11\n \n1  In November 2018, Brookdale filed three motions: (1) motion to compel Plaintiffs Helen Carlson \n2  and Lawrence Quinlan to arbitrate, Dkt. No. 59; (2) motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ SAC, Dkt. No. \n3  60; and (3) motion to strike the class allegations of Plaintiffs’ SAC, Dkt. No. 61.  The Court \n4  denied Brookdale’s motion to compel arbitration and motion to strike, and granted in part and \n5  denied in part Brookdale’s motion to dismiss.  Dkt. No. 85 (“January 25 Order”).  Brookdale \n6  appealed the Court’s order denying the motion to compel arbitration, Dkt. No. 93, and filed the \n7  present motion to stay proceedings related to Plaintiffs Carlson and Quinlan pending appeal, Dkt. \n8  No. 94.  Brookdale also filed a motion to certify for interlocutory appeal the Court’s finding that \n9  Brookdale facilities are public accommodations under the ADA.  Dkt. No. 99.   \n10  II.  MOTION TO STAY \n11  A.  Court’s Order Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration  \n12  Brookdale moved to compel Plaintiff Helen Carlson to arbitrate based on a 2011 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Agreement, which Plaintiffs argued was later superseded by a December 2017 Agreement.  Dkt. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  No. 59.  In 2011, Ms. Carlson entered into a standardized residency agreement and arbitration \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  addendum before moving into a Brookdale facility.  SAC ¶ 115.  Ms. Carlson entered into a new \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  residency agreement in December 2017, under which she opted out of the arbitration provision.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Dkt. No. 38-1, Ex. D at 9–12.  The Court found that the December 2017 Agreement controlled and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the arbitration opt-out applied to all claims arising from her stay at the Brookdale facility.  January \n19  25 Order at 6–7.  Further, based on the plain language of the arbitration provision, the Court held \n20  that the opt-out retroactively applied to the claims asserted in this lawsuit, notwithstanding that the \n21  lawsuit was filed before the December 2017 Agreement.  Id. (“The 2017 arbitration provision \n22  applies to ‘claims … whether existing or arising in the future.’”) (quoting Dkt. No. 38-1, Ex. D at \n23  10).  Therefore, by the plain language of the December 2017 Agreement, Ms. Carlson was not \n24  compelled to arbitrate her claims.   \n25  As to Plaintiff Lawrence Quinlan, the Court found that there was no agency relationship \n26  between him and his son, Phillip Quinlan, at the time Phillip Quinlan signed a 2015 residency \n27  agreement containing an arbitration opt-out clause.  January 25 Order at 7–9.  Mr. Quinlan did not \n28  grant his son power of attorney until January 2016.  Dkt. No. 31-4, Ex. A.  Brookdale offered no \n2 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 130   Filed 06/05/19   Page 3 of 11\n \n1  evidence that Mr. Quinlan, either by his conduct or inaction, caused Brookdale to believe that \n2  Phillip Quinlan was acting as his agent when Phillip Quinlan executed the residency agreement.  \n3  January 25 Order at 8.  The Court also rejected Brookdale’s equitable estoppel argument, as none \n4  of Plaintiffs’ claims relies on the residency agreements as valid and enforceable contracts.  Id. at 9.   \n5  Based on these findings, the Court denied Brookdale’s motion to compel Plaintiffs Carlson \n6  and Quinlan to arbitrate.  Id. at 2–9.   \n7  B.  Legal Standard \n8  The Ninth Circuit has held that a district court’s order denying a motion to compel \n9  arbitration does not automatically result in a mandatory stay of proceedings pending appeal of that \n10  order.  Britton v. Co-op Banking Group, 916 F.2d 1405, 1412 (9th Cir. 1990).  Instead, the district \n11  court has discretion to decide whether to stay proceedings pending appeal.  Id.  The party \n12  requesting the stay bears the burden of showing that the circumstances justify exercise of that \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  discretion.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433–34 (2009).  To determine whether the moving \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  party has met its burden, the Supreme Court articulated the following four-factor test: “(1) whether \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the [movant] has made a strong showing that [the movant] is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  whether the [movant] will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay \nS d nr\nee 17  will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  interest lies.”  Id. at 418.  Courts in the Ninth Circuit weigh these factors with a “general \n19  balancing” or “sliding scale” approach, under which “a stronger showing of one element may \n20  offset a weaker showing of another.”  Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 964 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n21  As to the first factor, if a movant is unable to show a ”strong likelihood of success,” then the \n22  movant must at least demonstrate that the appeal presents a “substantial case on the merits,” or \n23  that there are “serious legal questions” raised.2  Id. at 965–68.  However, under this lower \n24 \n                                                 \n2 Although the parties present two alternative frameworks for analyzing whether a stay in this \n25 \naction is appropriate (i.e. one applied specifically to stays pending appeal in the arbitration context \nand one applied generally to stays pending appeal), courts in this district have consistently \n26 \nanalyzed the “substantial question” inquiry, first articulated in Britton, under the first factor in \nNken as part of the sliding scale approach set forth in Leiva-Perez.  See, e.g., Blair v. Rent-A-Ctr., \n27 \nInc., No. C 17-02335 WHA, 2018 WL 2234049 (N.D. Cal. May 16, 2018); Jimenez v. Menzies \nAviation Inc., No. 15-CV-02392-WHO, 2015 WL 5591722 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 23, 2015); Ward v. \n28 \nEstate of Goossen, No. 14-CV-03510-TEH, 2014 WL 7273911 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 22, 2014); \n3 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 130   Filed 06/05/19   Page 4 of 11\n \n1  threshold, the movant must then demonstrate that the balance of hardships under the second and \n2  third factor tips sharply in the movant’s favor.  Id. at 970. \n3  C.  Discussion \n4  i.  Likelihood of Success or Substantial Question \n5  Brookdale argues that on appeal it raises “substantial issues in contending that its \n6  arbitration agreements with Plaintiffs Carlson and Quinlan are fully enforceable under the FAA.”  \n7  Dkt. No. 94 at 5.  For Ms. Carlson, Brookdale proffers that there is a substantial issue as to \n8  whether the opt-out provision in the December 2017 “subject-matter-specific agreement” can \n9  supersede an earlier, “broader agreement to arbitrate.”  Id.  The substantial issue as to Mr. \n10  Quinlan, according to Brookdale, is whether an “implied agent may bind a principal as to \n11  arbitration” in light of “Congress’s preference for arbitration.”  Id. at 7.   \n12  The Ninth Circuit has not clearly defined the phrase “substantial case on the merits,” but \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  courts in this district have interpreted the phrase to mean a case that: (1) “raises genuine matters of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  first impression within the Ninth Circuit”; (2) may “implicate a constitutional question”; or (3) \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  “otherwise address[es] a pressing legal issue which urges that the Ninth Circuit hear the case.”  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Morse, 2013 WL 123610, at *3 (citing cases in this district granting stays because there was a \nS d nr\nee 17  substantial question as to whether state precedent is preempted by the FAA); Blair, 2018 WL \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  2234049, at *2 (finding substantial question as to whether a California Supreme Court case is \n19  preempted by the FAA); Ward, 2014 WL 7273911, at *3 (finding substantial question in case \n20  where contracts were poorly-constructed and contained ambiguous and inconsistent provisions); \n21  Zaborowski, 2013 WL 1832638, at *2 (finding substantial question as to the applicability of a \n22  Supreme Court case to California law governing arbitration agreements).  The Court will follow \n23  the same approach, as it is consistent with public policy recognizing that while a stay is an \n24  “intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review,” there may be \n25  instances when enforcement of a determination should be stayed to allow the reviewing court \n26 \n                                                                                                                                                                \n27 \nZaborowski v. MHN Gov’t Servs., Inc., No. C 12-05109 SI, 2013 WL 1832638 (N.D. Cal. May 1, \n2013); Morse v. Servicemaster Glob. Holdings, Inc., No. C 08-03894, 2013 WL 123610 (N.D. \n28 \nCal. Jan. 8, 2013). \n4 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 130   Filed 06/05/19   Page 5 of 11\n \n1  ample time to consider the merits and prevent “irreparable injury to the parties or to the public.”  \n2  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 427; Scripps-Howard Radio v. F.C.C., 316 U.S. 4, 9 (1942).  Any other \n3  approach would allow a party to indefinitely stall trial “simply by bringing a frivolous motion to \n4  compel arbitration.”  Britton, 916 F.2d at 1412.   \n5  The Court does not find that Brookdale’s arguments constitute substantial questions that \n6  raise genuine matters of first impression with the Ninth Circuit, implicate a constitutional \n7  question, or otherwise address a pressing legal issue.  See Morse, 2013 WL 123610, at *3.  Rather, \n8  the Court resolved Brookdale’s arguments through application of well-settled contract and agency \n9  principles.  With respect to Ms. Carlson, Brookdale asserts that the Court was incorrect as a matter \n10  of contract interpretation when it read the opt-out in the December 2017 Agreement to apply to \n11  “[a]ny and all claims arising out of, or in any way relating to, this Agreement or your stay at the \n12  Community.”  Dkt. No. 94 at 6 (quoting January 25 Order at 6).  But that is exactly what the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  arbitration provision said, in unambiguous, plain language: \nCfi\n tla  \nciC 14  AGREEMENT  TO  ARBITRATE.  [  ]  Any  and  all  claims  or \nrts fo controversies  arising  out  of,  or  in  any  way  relating  to,  this \niD tc 15  Agreement or your stay at the Community, excluding any action for \n sir\net eviction,  and  including  disputes  regarding  interpretation  of  this \ntatsiD 16  Agreement, whether arising out of State or Federal law, whether \nS d nr existing or arising in the future, whether for statutory, compensatory \nee 17  or punitive damages and whether sounding in breach of contract, tort \nth\nintr or breach of statutory duties, irrespective of the basis for the duty or \nUo\nN 18  the  legal  theories  upon  which  the  claim  is  asserted,  shall  be \nsubmitted to binding arbitration, as provided below, and shall not be \n19  filed in a court of law. \n20  Dkt. No. 38-1, Ex. D at 10.  The appeal thus poses no serious legal issues of contract \n21  interpretation, and Brookdale’s position is contrary to the plain language of the provision itself.  \n22  See Morse, 2013 WL 123610, at *3 (“Notwithstanding the FAA’s strong preference for arbitration \n23  where contracts raise doubts, the Court held that ‘here there is no doubt.’  The Court relied only on \n24  the four corners of the contract, and did not rest on or implicate any constitutional issue”).3    \n25    Brookdale’s second purportedly substantial question is whether an implied agent may bind \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n3 Brookdale cites several cases for the proposition that this Court’s holding is inconsistent with \nother courts’ rulings.  Dkt. No. 94 at 6.  The Court sees no inconsistency, as those cases (a) are not \n28 \ncontrolling and (b) involved distinguishable facts.   \n5 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 130   Filed 06/05/19   Page 6 of 11\n \n1  a principal to arbitration.  Dkt. No. 94 at 6.  But Brookdale’s reading of the January 25 Order is \n2  misplaced.  The Court did not address whether an implied agent may bind a principal to \n3  arbitration, because it held that Phillip Quinlan, Mr. Quinlan’s son, was not an agent under \n4  principles of “apparent authority.”  January 25 Order at 8.  As Brookdale correctly notes, it “is \n5  black letter law that agency may generally be implied,” but the Court held that Brookdale offered \n6  no evidence that Mr. Quinlan, either by conduct or inaction, “caused Brookdale to believe Phillip \n7  Quinlan was acting as his agent when he executed the 2015 residency agreement.”  Id. at 8.  \n8  Brookdale seems to suggest that Congress’s “preference for arbitration” compels the Court to \n9  disregard well-established agency principles and presume an implied agency relationship within \n10  the arbitration context, even when there simply is no evidence of such a relationship.  Dkt. No. 94 \n11  at 7.  But the Court is doubtful that the law requires that result, and Brookdale’s cases do not stand \n12  for such a position.  See id. at 7 (citing Kindred Nursing Ctrs. Ltd. P’ship v. Clark, 137 S. Ct. 1421 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  (2017)).  In Kindred, the Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s decision declining to give effect \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  two arbitration agreements executed by individuals holding powers of attorney.  Kindred Nursing, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  137 S. Ct. at 1425.  The lower court’s decision was based on a state rule that the Supreme Court \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  held violated the FAA.  Id. at 1426–27 (“The Kentucky Supreme Court’s clear-statement rule … \nS d nr\nee 17  fails to put arbitration agreements on an equal plane with other contracts.”).  Notably here, Phillip \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Quinlan did not hold his father’s power of attorney at the time he signed the residency agreement.  \n19  Dkt. No. 31-4, Ex. A.   \n20     The first factor therefore does not weigh in favor of a stay.   \n21  ii.  Irreparable Harm to Defendants \n22  Next, Brookdale contends that “[t]here can be no question that Brookdale will be \n23  irreparably harmed if a stay is denied,” because it would have to incur the cost of litigation \n24  pending appeal, thereby defeating the cost-limiting purpose of arbitration.  Dkt. No. 94 at 9–10.  \n25  However, litigation will move forward regardless of the outcome of Brookdale’s appeal, as the \n26  appeal only concerns two Plaintiffs.  Because Plaintiffs will continue with discovery and class \n27  certification briefing, the cost of litigating this case is not likely to be meaningfully reduced if only \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 130   Filed 06/05/19   Page 7 of 11\n \n1  two Plaintiffs are compelled to arbitrate.4  Other courts in this district have held that litigation \n2  expense, when the moving party must continue litigating regardless of the outcome of the appeal, \n3  is not sufficient to establish irreparable harm.  See, e.g., Blair, 2018 WL 2234049, at *2 (“[The] \n4  appeal concerns only a portion of the claims at issue in this case.  Regardless of the outcome of the \n5  appeal, [defendant] will incur the costs of litigating [the] non-arbitrable claims”); Ambrosio v. \n6  Cogent Commc’ns, Inc., No. 14-CV-02182-RS, 2016 WL 7888024, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 21, \n7  2016) (“Yet, this litigation will move forward regardless of the outcome of [defendant’s] appeal \n8  … [a]s such, the cost of litigating this case is not likely to be less”); Jimenez, 2015 WL 5591722, \n9  at *4 (“Regardless of the outcome of its appeal, [defendant] must continue to litigate the remaining \n10  claims; therefore, if I grant this partial stay [defendant] will still incur the potential costs or delays \n11  associated with litigation”).  Brookdale does not convincingly explain why the same is not true \n12  here. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Because Brookdale fails to satisfy the first two crucial factors, the Court need not reach the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  remaining factors in its analysis.  See Mount Graham Coal. v. Thomas, 89 F.3d 554, 558 (9th Cir. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  1996) (declining to address the remaining factors where first factor was not satisfied); see also \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Ambrosio, 2016 WL 7888024, at *3; Morse, 2013 WL 123610, at *4.   \nS d nr\nee 17  *                         *                         * \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  For the foregoing reasons, Brookdale’s motion to stay pending appeal of the Court’s order \n19  denying the motion to compel arbitration is DENIED. \n20  III.  MOTION TO CERTIFY FOR INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL \n21  A.  Court’s Order Finding Brookdale Facilities Are Public Accommodations  \n22  In the Court’s January 25 Order, the Court denied Brookdale’s motion to dismiss \n23  Plaintiffs’ Title III ADA and Unruh Act claims.5  January 25 Order at 12–14.  In so doing, it held \n24 \n                                                 \n4 Brookdale cites to a Seventh Circuit case, Bradford-Scott Data Corp. v. Physician Comput. \n25 \nNetwork, Inc., 128 F.3d 504 (7th Cir. 1997), to support its assertion that the time and expense of \nlitigation constitutes irreparable harm in the arbitration context.  Dkt. No. 94 at 10.  Beyond the \n26 \nfact that litigation expense does not constitute irreparable harm in this particular case, the Court \nalso notes that Bradford-Scott rejects, and is in direct conflict with, the Ninth Circuit’s holding in \n27 \nBritton.  See Bradford-Scott, 128 F.3d at 506.   \n5 The analysis underlying the ADA claims also applies to the Unruh Act claims.  Molski v. M.J. \n28 \nCable, Inc., 481 F.3d 724, 731 (9th Cir. 2007) (“Any violation of the ADA necessarily constitutes \n7 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 130   Filed 06/05/19   Page 8 of 11\n \n1  that Brookdale facilities are public accommodations subject to the ADA.  Id. at 12.  According to \n2  the SAC, Brookdale facilities are assisted living facilities, also called “Residential Care Facilities \n3  for the Elderly (“RCFEs”), and offer “room, board and daily assistance for seniors and persons \n4  with disabilities.”  SAC ¶ 28.  The assistance offered includes “preparing meals, shopping, \n5  transportation, preparing and taking medication, housekeeping, laundry, bathing, toileting, \n6  grooming, dressing, and others.”  Id.  Brookdale’s own SEC filings represented that all “of our \n7  communities are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA.”  Dkt. No \n8  26-1, Ex. A at 32.   \n9  The Court found unpersuasive Brookdale’s argument that despite its facilities providing \n10  skilled nursing “and other, higher levels of medical care,” the facilities are more similar to private \n11  apartment complexes than assisted living and nursing facilities.  January 25 Order at 12.  \n12  Brookdale cited no case in which similar facilities were exempted from ADA compliance.  Id.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Instead, the Court found convincing Plaintiffs’ argument that the facilities are similar to assisted \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  living and skilled nursing facilities, such as those at issue in Hubbard v. Twin Oaks Health & \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Rehab Ctr., 408 F. Supp. 2d 923 (E.D. Cal 2004) and Herriot v. Channing House, No. C 06-\n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  6323JF, 2009 WL 225418 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2009), and are therefore public accommodations.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Id.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Brookdale now asks the Court to certify for interlocutory appeal the question of whether \n19  the facilities are public accommodations under the ADA.  Dkt. No. 99.  Should the Court grant the \n20  motion to certify for interlocutory appeal, Brookdale also seeks a partial stay pending the appeal.  \n21  Id.    \n22  B.  Legal Standard \n23  Under the “final judgment rule,” codified in 28 U.S.C. § 1291, the courts of appeal have \n24  jurisdiction over “appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.”  28 \n25  U.S.C. § 1291.  Appellate review before a final judgment is only appropriate in “exceptional cases \n26  where decision of an interlocutory appeal might avoid protracted and expensive litigation.”  U.S. \n27 \n                                                                                                                                                                \n28 \na violation of the Unruh Act.”).   \n8 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 130   Filed 06/05/19   Page 9 of 11\n \n1  Rubber Co. v. Wright, 359 F.2d 784, 785 (9th Cir. 1966).  A district court may only certify an \n2  order for interlocutory appeal if the moving party demonstrates that: (1) the issue to be certified \n3  “involves a controlling question of law”; (2) there is a “substantial ground for difference of \n4  opinion”; and (3) “an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate \n5  termination of the litigation.”  28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  The requirements of § 1292(b) are \n6  jurisdictional, meaning if the appeal does not present circumstances satisfying the statutory \n7  prerequisites, the reviewing court cannot allow the appeal.  Couch v. Telescope Inc., 611 F.3d 629, \n8  633 (9th Cir. 2009).   \n9  Because § 1292(b) is a departure from the final judgment rule, this exception “must be \n10  construed narrowly.”  James v. Price Stern Sloan, Inc., 283 F.3d 1064, 1068 n.6 (9th Cir. 2002).  \n11  The decision to certify an issue for interlocutory appeal is discretionary, Swint v. Chambers Cty. \n12  Comm’n, 514 U.S. 35, 36 (1995), and the district court should apply the requirements “strictly” \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  and certify for interlocutory appeal only when “exceptional circumstances” justify a departure \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  from the well-established policy of postponing appellate review until after a final judgment.  See \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 475 (1978).  The party seeking certification bears \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the burden of demonstrating that the requirements are satisfied and that such a departure is \nS d nr\nee 17  warranted.  Id.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  C.  Discussion \n19  i.  Controlling Question of Law  \n20  The issue to be certified must be a “controlling question of law.”  28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  \n21  The moving party must show that “resolution of the issue on appeal could materially affect the \n22  outcome of litigation in the district court.”  In re Cement Antitrust Litig., 673 F.2d 1020, 1026 (9th \n23  Cir. 1981).  Brookdale contends, and Plaintiffs concede, that this issue is controlling because only \n24  if the facilities are public accommodations subject to Title III of the ADA may “any ADA or \n25  Unruh Act claims … proceed at all.”  Dkt. No. 99; see Dkt. No. 120 at 1 n.1.  The Court agrees \n26  and finds that Brookdale has satisfied the first factor.  However, Brookdale has not satisfied the \n27  remaining two factors and the Court therefore declines to exercise its discretion to certify the issue \n28  for interlocutory appeal.      \n9 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 130   Filed 06/05/19   Page 10 of 11\n \n1  ii.  Substantial Ground for Difference of Opinion \n2  The second requirement under § 1292(b) is that there is a “substantial ground for \n3  difference of opinion” on the issue the moving party seeks to certify for interlocutory appeal.  “A \n4  party’s strong disagreement with the Court’s ruling” is not enough.  Couch, 611 F.3d at 633.  \n5  “That settled law might be applied differently does not establish a substantial ground for \n6  difference of opinion.”  Id.  Rather, “courts must examine to what extent the controlling law is \n7  unclear.”  Id.  A substantial ground for difference of opinion exists where “the circuits are in \n8  dispute on the question and the court of appeals of the circuit has not spoken on the point, if \n9  complicated questions arise under foreign law, or if novel and difficult questions of first \n10  impression are presented.”  Id. (quotations and citation omitted).  However, “just because a court \n11  is the first to rule on a particular question or just because counsel contends that one precedent \n12  rather than another is controlling does not mean there is such a substantial difference of opinion as \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  will support an interlocutory appeal.”  Id.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Brookdale argues that there is a “substantial ground for difference of opinion” because the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Ninth Circuit has not addressed the specific issue concerning Brookdale’s facilities and the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “legislative history and statutory text indicat[e] that residential communities such as Brookdale’s \nS d nr\nee 17  are not ‘public accommodations’ under the ADA.”  Dkt. No. 99 at 5–9.  The Court disagrees.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Brookdale repeats the arguments the Court rejected in denying the motion to dismiss, but that \n19  simply reflects its “strong disagreement” with the Court’s holding.  See Couch, 611 F.3d at 633.  \n20  The Court has already found that the facilities are more similar to the assisted living and skilled \n21  nursing facilities at issue in Hubbard and Herriot than to private residences.  January 25 Order at \n22  13–14.  Brookdale disagrees and characterizes the facilities differently than they are described in \n23  the SAC (and in its own SEC filings).  But this is just an argument that the Court misapplied the \n24  existing law to the facts alleged, which is clearly insufficient to show a “substantial ground for \n25  difference of opinion.”  See Couch, 611 F.3d at 633; see also United States v. Wen-Bing Soong, \n26  No. C-13-4088 EMC, 2014 WL 988632, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 10, 2014) (citing cases).  \n27  iii.  Materially Advance Litigation \n28  Under the third factor, the Court must determine whether an interlocutory appeal on this \n10 \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 130   Filed 06/05/19   Page 11 of 11\n \n1  issue would “materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.”  28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  \n2  “The ultimate question is whether permitting an interlocutory appeal would minimize the total \n3  burdens of litigation on parties and the judicial system by accelerating or at least simplifying trial \n4  court proceedings.” Allen v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., No. 3:13-CV-01279-WHO, 2019 WL 1466889, \n5  at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 6, 2019) (quotations and citation omitted).  \n6  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Brookdale’s appeal would not materially advance the \n7  ultimate termination of the litigation.  See Dkt. No. 120 at 12.  As Plaintiffs observe, even if the \n8  ADA and Unruh Act claims were terminated at this juncture, Plaintiffs’ other claims are still \n9  pending and litigation would go forward regardless.  Id.  An interlocutory appeal therefore would \n10  not accelerate the pace of this litigation and would not minimize either party’s burden.  The Court \n11  also cannot say that permitting appeal of the ADA claim would materially narrow the scope and \n12  duration of discovery, as Plaintiffs appear likely to conduct the same or very similar discovery for \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  their other pending claims.  See Dkt. No. 120 at 13.  If anything, certifying the issue for \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  interlocutory appeal could delay the ultimate termination of this case.  See Shurance v. Planning \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Control Int’l, Inc., 839 F.2d 1347, 1348 (9th Cir. 1988)  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  *                         *                         * \nS d nr\nee 17  Accordingly, the Court DENIES Brookdale’s motion to certify for interlocutory appeal. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  IV.  CONCLUSION \n19  The Court DENIES Brookdale’s motion to stay, Dkt. No. 94, and DENIES Brookdale’s \n20  motion to certify for interlocutory appeal, Dkt. No. 99.  The Court SETS a case management \n21  conference for July 16, 2019 at 2:00 p.m.  The Court DIRECTS the parties to file on or before \n22  July 9, 2019, a joint case management statement with a proposed class certification briefing \n23  schedule.   \n24  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n25  Dated:  6/5/2019\n26  ______________________________________ \nHAYWOOD S.

Plaintiffs and the proposed Classes bring this action for declaratory and injunctive \n3 relief and damages to stop the unlawful and fraudulent practices of Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. \n4 and Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc. (“BROOKDALE” or “Defendants”). \n5 2.  Plaintiffs are elderly or dependent individuals living in California who have \n6 significant care needs and disabilities.  Plaintiffs and their families were overwhelmed by and \n7 required assistance with their activities of daily living including, but not limited to, assistance with \n8 managing and taking medication; housekeeping; laundry; dressing; bathing; toileting; hygiene; \n9 food preparation; and transportation.  Plaintiffs and their families and the classes they seek to \n10 represent either chose a BROOKDALE facility or chose to stay in a facility purchased by \n11 BROOKDALE because they believed BROOKDALE’s repeated promises to provide the care and \n12 assistance that would allow them to age with dignity.  Instead, Plaintiffs, their family members, \n13 and the proposed class members have all encountered in BROOKDALE a system of understaffed \n14 assisted living facilities that fails to consistently provide even the most basic level of promised \n15 care. \n16 3.  Defendant BROOKDALE has engaged in a policy and practice of violating Title \n17 III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., \n18 accompanying regulations, and the Unruh Civil Rights Act (“Unruh Act”), California Civil Code \n19 §§ 51 et seq.  Among other things, Defendant has violated the ADA by failing to make its assisted \n20 living facilities readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.  Defendants’ assisted \n21 living facilities are characterized by multiple, pervasive physical access barriers that limit or deny \n22 full and equal access to persons with disabilities. \n23 4.  Moreover, Defendant has failed to make reasonable modifications to its policies, \n24 practices and procedures that are necessary for persons with disabilities to have full and equal \n25 access to and enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities, privileges, advantages and \n26 accommodations provided by BROOKDALE’s facilities.  Defendants’ goods, services, facilities, \n27 privileges, advantages, or accommodations include providing assistance with activities of daily \n28   1\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 3 of 91\n \n1 living (assistance with eating, housekeeping and laundry, bathing, grooming, dressing, toileting, \n2 personal hygiene, provision of nutritious meals), medication management (ordering and storage of \n3 medications, assistance taking medications), social and recreational activities (group exercise, \n4 games, movies, scenic drives, happy hours and social mixers, and assistance with arrangements for \n5 utilization of local resources), and transportation to and coordination of off-site services.  Plaintiffs \n6 have specifically requested that Defendant BROOKDALE make reasonable modifications to its \n7 staffing policies, practices and procedures for its assisted living facilities in order to ensure that \n8 there is staffing in sufficient numbers and with adequate training to provide timely and effective \n9 assistance and care to residents with disabilities.  Despite the fact that such modifications are \n10 necessary to ensure that residents with disabilities receive full and equal access to and enjoyment \n11 of Defendants’ goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations, and despite \n12 the fact that such modifications will not result in any fundamental alteration to BROOKDALE’s \n13 public accommodations, Defendant has refused to do so. \n14 5.  In addition, Defendant has violated the ADA by failing and refusing to provide \n15 residents with mobility disabilities with full and equal access to and enjoyment of its \n16 transportation services.  Further, Defendant has discriminated against residents with disabilities by \n17 failing to provide them with an emergency evacuation plan that is designed for and reasonably \n18 calculated to ensure the prompt and effective evacuation of persons with disabilities in the event of \n19 emergency. \n20 6.  Defendant BROOKDALE has also engaged in a policy and practice of violating the \n21 Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”), Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750 et seq., committing Elder \n22 Financial Abuse, Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30, and Unlawful, Unfair and Fraudulent \n23 Business Practices (“UCL”), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq.  Defendants promise to \n24 provide the elderly and disabled the “quality of life they’ve earned,” but Defendants instead \n25 engage in a scheme to defraud seniors, persons with disabilities, and their family members.  In \n26 order to induce the elderly and disabled to move into and stay at its California assisted living \n27 facilities, BROOKDALE makes misrepresentations and misleading statements and conceals \n28   2\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 4 of 91\n \n1 material facts about the quality and availability of care available at BROOKDALE.  Reasonable \n2 consumers are misled to believe, and reasonably expect, that BROOKDALE determines each \n3 resident’s needs and staffs each facility accordingly to deliver personalized care to meet those \n4 needs.  Instead, BROOKDALE systemically understaffs its facilities, cuts caregiver hours, and \n5 fails to train workers, all to boost its profitability, while the residents in BROOKDALE’s care are \n6 forced to endure increasingly expensive monthly charges and worsening care.  The results of \n7 BROOKDALE’s callous and profit-driven approach are devastating: as multiple reports by state \n8 regulators confirm, residents are left without assistance for hours after falling, they are given the \n9 wrong medications, they are denied clean clothing, showers, and nutritious food, and they are left \n10 in their own waste for long periods of time. \n11 7.  On any given day, residents of BROOKDALE’s many California facilities live \n12 with a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for and that \n13 they need.  Scores of family and resident council meetings and hundreds of communications to \n14 BROOKDALE management have failed to rectify these problems, leaving Plaintiffs and the class \n15 no choice but to seek redress in this Court. \n16 8.  This lawsuit seeks to end this systemic discrimination against persons with \n17 disabilities by requiring Defendant to provide them with full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n18 BROOKDALE’s facilities, services, goods, privileges, advantages and accommodations.  This \n19 action seeks to require that Defendants staff their facilities with a sufficient number of adequately \n20 trained staff to ensure that residents with disabilities are provided with full and equal access to and \n21 enjoyment of the services specified in BROOKDALE’s own resident assessments.  In addition, \n22 this action seeks to require that Defendants provide assistive living facilities that are readily \n23 accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities as required by the ADA.  Further, Plaintiffs \n24 seek injunctive relief requiring Defendants to provide full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n25 Defendants’ transportation services and activities.  Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief requiring \n26 Defendants to provide adequate emergency planning and evacuation procedures for residents with \n27 disabilities.  With respect to the CLRA, the UCL and the Elder Financial Abuse statute, this action \n28   3\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 5 of 91\n \n1 seeks to require Defendant to disclose to prospective and current residents, their family members \n2 or responsible parties, and the class that BROOKDALE’s existing staffing policies and procedures \n3 preclude it from providing its residents with all the care and services they have been promised and \n4 are paying for.  Further, this action seeks to enjoin BROOKDALE from charging residents or their \n5 responsible parties monthly fees based on their Personal Service Plans until BROOKDALE \n6 implements staffing policies and procedures that enable it to deliver those services on a consistent \n7 basis. \n8 9.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and, unless BROOKDALE is \n9 preliminarily and permanently enjoined, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm as a \n10 result of being denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s goods, services, \n11 facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and \n12 injunctive relief and statutory and actual damages as set forth below against BROOKDALE for its \n13 policy and practice of denying Plaintiffs full and equal access to and enjoyment of its services and \n14 facilities and violating the ADA and its accompanying regulations, the Unruh Act, the CLRA, \n15 committing Elder Financial Abuse, and engaging in Unlawful, Unfair and Fraudulent Business \n16 Practices.  Plaintiffs also seek recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and litigation expenses \n17 under federal and state law. \n18 EXHAUSTION OF PRE-LAWSUIT PROCEDURES FOR STATE LAW CLAIMS \n19 10.  By letter dated June 2, 2017, Plaintiffs notified Defendants of Plaintiffs’ intent to \n20 file suit against it based on violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, as required by \n21 California Civil Code § 1782.  BROOKDALE received the letter on June 6, 2017.  More than 30 \n22 days have passed since BROOKDALE’s receipt, and BROOKDALE has not corrected or \n23 remedied the violations alleged in the notice and herein. \n24 11.  Though they were not required to do so, Plaintiffs also notified BROOKDALE of \n25 its multiple violations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1201 et \n26 seq., the Unruh Civil Rights Act, California’s elder financial abuse law, and California’s Unfair \n27 Competition Law. \n28   4\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 6 of 91\n \nJURISDICTION \n1\n2 12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to  \n3 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3)-(4).  The Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et \n4 seq., presents federal questions and confers jurisdiction on this Court over Plaintiffs’ claims \n5 regardless of the amount in controversy.  This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction of this \n6 action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2)(A) because this is a class action in which the proposed \n7 class includes at least 100 members, the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000, exclusive of \n8 interests and costs, and at least one putative class member is a citizen of a state different from one \n9 of the defendants.  Plaintiffs seek damages in the amount of a minimum $9,000 per class member \n10 and believe that the class consists of over 5,000 persons, making the amount in controversy well in \n11 excess of $5,000,000.  BROOKDALE is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of \n12 business in Tennessee, making it a citizen of both Delaware and Tennessee, and each of the named \n13 Plaintiffs are citizens of the State of California.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, this Court has \n14 supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ pendent claims under California law. \n15 13.  Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in this Court because Defendants \n16 have sufficient minimum contacts in California, or otherwise intentionally avail themselves of the \n17 California market through ownership and/or management of assisted living facilities located in \n18 California, derivation of substantial revenues from California, and other activities, so as to render \n19 the exercise of jurisdiction over Defendants by the California courts consistent with the traditional \n20 notions of fair play and substantial justice. \n21 VENUE \n22 14.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n23 § 1391(b), because the acts upon which this action is based occurred in part in this District within \n24 the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Lake, Monterey, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and \n25 Sonoma. \n26\n27\n28   5\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 7 of 91\n \n1 15.  A substantial part of the events or omissions which gave rise to Plaintiffs’ claims \n2 arose in the County of Sonoma and thus, pursuant to Civil Local Rules 3-2(c) and (d), assignment \n3 to the San Francisco Division of the District Court for the Northern District of California is proper. \n4 THE PARTIES \n5 16.

Defendant BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING, INC. is a corporation organized \n20 under the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal place of business in Brentwood, \n21 Tennessee. \n22 23.  Defendant BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES, INC. is a \n23 corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal place of business \n24 in Brentwood, Tennessee. \n25 24.  BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING, INC. and BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING \n26 COMMUNITIES, INC. will be referred to collectively as “BROOKDALE” or “Defendants.” \n27 BROOKDALE owns, manages, and/or operates approximately eighty-nine (89) assisted living \n28   8\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 10 of 91\n \n1 facilities throughout California.  It is the largest chain of senior living facilities in California and in \n2 the United States. \n3 25.  Defendants DOES 1-100 are sued herein under fictitious names because Plaintiffs \n4 do not presently know their true names and capacities.  Plaintiffs will seek leave to amend this \n5 Complaint to allege their true names and capacities when such are discovered.  Plaintiffs allege \n6 that each of these Defendants was responsible in some capacity for the events alleged herein, or is \n7 a necessary party for obtaining appropriate relief.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon \n8 allege that in carrying out each of the acts and violations alleged in this Complaint, each \n9 Defendant acted as an agent, principal, and/or representative for each other Defendant. \n10 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n11 26.  BROOKDALE is the largest provider of assisted living for senior citizens and \n12 persons with disabilities in the nation and has the largest number of assisted living facility \n13 residents within the state of California.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that there are \n14 more than 5,000 residents in Defendants’ eighty-nine facilities in California. \n15 27.  Assisted living facilities, also called Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly \n16 (“RCFEs”), offer room, board and daily assistance for seniors and persons with disabilities in \n17 certain activities of daily living (“ADLs”), such as preparing meals, shopping, transportation, \n18 preparing and taking medication, housekeeping, laundry, bathing, toileting, grooming, dressing, \n19 and others. \n20 28.  Assisted living facilities are intended to provide a level of care appropriate for \n21 those who are unable to live by themselves, but who do not have medical conditions requiring \n22 more extensive nursing care. \n23 29.  In recent years, BROOKDALE has increasingly been accepting and retaining more \n24 residents with conditions and care needs that were once handled almost exclusively in skilled \n25 nursing facilities.  This has allowed it to increase not only the potential resident pool but also the \n26 amounts of money charged to residents and/or their family members. \n27  \n28   9\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 11 of 91\n \n1 30.  At BROOKDALE facilities, residents are charged a base rate, which includes \n2 room, board, and basic maintenance, housekeeping, laundry, dining services, planned social and \n3 recreational programs, scheduled transportation services, staffing 24 hours a day, observation and \n4 consultation, and assistance with access to outside services.  BROOKDALE uses its resident \n5 assessment system to assess each resident before admission and then again periodically throughout \n6 residency and/or whenever there is a change of the resident’s condition.  By performing these \n7 assessments, BROOKDALE determines what additional services a resident needs, such as \n8 assistance with ADLs, and develops a Personal Service Plan for the resident.  Each additional \n9 need, or service, is assigned a monthly Personal Service Rate, which is added onto the resident’s \n10 base rate.  The more personal services determined by BROOKDALE to be needed by a resident, \n11 the more money BROOKDALE charges that resident. \n12 31.  Every month, BROOKDALE sends each resident or his or her legal representative \n13 an invoice for services that BROOKDALE represents it will provide in the following month.  \n14 These invoices reflect the monthly rate for the Basic Services set forth in BROOKDALE’s \n15 standard residency agreements, the Personal Service Rate that is based on each resident’s Personal \n16 Service Plan, and any adjustments.  On information and belief, these monthly invoices range from \n17 approximately $4,000 to $10,000 per person per month. \n18 32.  On information and belief, as of January 1, 2016, BROOKDALE increased the \n19 Basic Service Rate and Personal Service Rate for residents in its California facilities by roughly \n20 6%, and as of January 1, 2017, it raised these rates again by approximately 7%.  In standard form \n21 letters sent to residents attempting to explain these steep rate increases, BROOKDALE attributed \n22 them to increases in “the operating costs of your community,” including costs for “utility usage, \n23 insurance, supplies, and food.”  But in fact the Consumer Price Index for the Bay Area rose only \n24 3.4% between approximately January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. \n25 \\\\\\ \n26 \\\\\\ \n27 \\\\\\ \n28   10\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 12 of 91\n \nBROOKDALE FAILS TO PROVIDE FULL AND EQUAL ACCESS TO AND \n1 ENJOYMENT OF ITS FACILITIES AND SERVICES TO PERSONS WITH \nDISABILITIES IN VIOLATION OF THE ADA \n2  AND THE UNRUH CIVIL RIGHTS ACT \nPhysical Access Violations \n3\n4 33.  BROOKDALE has violated Title III of the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act \n5 by failing to provide full and equal access to its facilities and services.  Rooms occupied by \n6 persons with mobility disabilities at the BROOKDALE San Ramon, Windsor, and likely other \n7 facilities, do not meet federal or state accessibility standards.  Under Title III, fifty percent of the \n8 residential rooms in long-term care facilities must meet the requirements of the 1991 ADAAG or \n9 the 2010 ADA Standards.  BROOKDALE’s facilities do not meet these standards. \n10 34.  There is a pattern of physical access barriers in BROOKDALE facilities, as \n11 described below: \n12 a.  Wheelchair users are placed in rooms that do not have sufficient turning \n13 space in the bathrooms or the bedroom area.  This means that they often \n14 cannot even use their bathroom unless they are able to transfer out of their \n15 wheelchair and enter without it.  Those who can enter in their wheelchair \n16 usually do not have enough space to transfer safely onto the toilet or into \n17 the shower or to use the sink or vanity space.  Some residents have given up \n18 on using their inaccessible toilet and must rely on adult briefs and \n19 caregiving staff to clean them. \n20 b.  There is no clearance for wheelchairs under the sinks and/or the sinks are \n21 too high for a wheelchair user to reach them, preventing residents from \n22 using them. \n23 c.  The grab bars that do exist in the bathrooms are not compliant with \n24 applicable access standards, and there are no roll-in showers.  Both of these \n25 barriers are safety hazards, increasing the likelihood of falls.  They also \n26 prevent most persons with mobility disabilities from bathing as \n27 independently as possible.  Some wheelchair users have stopped using their \n28   11\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 13 of 91\n \n1 showers altogether and instead take sponge baths, hardly an adequate \n2 substitute. \n3 d.  There are barriers to using the outdoor space for the residents’ rooms, \n4 including hard-to-open sliding doors, a lip at the threshold of the door, and \n5 insufficient space to accommodate a wheelchair.  This prevents persons \n6 with mobility disabilities from using their outdoor space as persons without \n7 disabilities can. \n8 e.  The closets do not have accessible hanging and storage space, in that they \n9 are placed out of the reach of a wheelchair user.  This prevents persons with \n10 mobility disabilities from accessing their clothing and other personal items, \n11 forcing them to rely on others for assistance. \n12 f.  Kitchen countertops and sinks are too high for a wheelchair user to access, \n13 preventing those residents from fully using their kitchens. \n14 35.  These physical access barriers, which residents live with on a daily basis, prevent \n15 them from having full and equal access to their rooms as required by law. \n16 Understaffing \n17 36.  BROOKDALE does not schedule or provide sufficient numbers of trained staff to \n18 provide promised services and meet the needs of its residents.  Plaintiffs allege on information and \n19 belief that BROOKDALE staffs its facilities based on predetermined labor budgets and desired \n20 profit margins.  Pursuant to Defendants’ corporate policies and procedures, the executive directors \n21 who manage individual BROOKDALE facilities must request permission from Defendants’ \n22 corporate headquarters to deviate from these pre-determined budgets.  Executive directors have a \n23 disincentive to request increased labor budgets for their facilities because they are not eligible for \n24 bonuses unless they meet earnings targets set by Defendants’ corporate headquarters. \n25 37.  Reports issued by California Department of Social Services’ Community Care \n26 Licensing Division (“Community Care Licensing”), the state agency that regulates assisted living \n27 facilities, indicate that inadequate staffing pervades Defendants’ California facilities.  For instance, \n28   12\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 14 of 91\n \n1 Community Care Licensing recently issued a citation to BROOKDALE Corona after a licensing \n2 inspector found “that there are not enough staff present” and observed five residents sitting \n3 unsupervised in the dining room and 19 residents in the activity room with only one staff member \n4 present.  In March 2017, Community Care Licensing cited a BROOKDALE facility in Santa Cruz \n5 County after a licensing inspector found that the facility did not have an adequate amount of staff \n6 to meet residents’ needs.  In June 2016, BROOKDALE Oceanside received a citation because it \n7 had only two caregivers on duty during daytime hours in the assisted living part of its facility. \n8 38.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that BROOKDALE uses pre-determined \n9 staffing schedules at its facilities and does not change these schedules or the number of staff hours \n10 worked when the facility has more residents or residents with greater needs.  Community Care \n11 Licensing records demonstrate the inadequacy of Defendants’ staffing to meet even the most basic \n12 needs of residents.  For instance, a personnel report that BROOKDALE filed with Community \n13 Care Licensing in February 2017 indicates that BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, a facility in \n14 Sonoma County, is understaffed for the night shift from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.  That schedule \n15 lists only four resident caregivers assigned to the night shift, three of whom work only three days a \n16 week, with the result that in many instances there are as few as one resident caregiver on duty \n17 during the night shift to care for approximately 100 residents on three floors.  Moreover, the \n18 official numbers of caregivers on duty is often quite deceptive, as BROOKDALE frequently pulls \n19 caregivers from their responsibilities in order to perform other tasks, such as serving meals in the \n20 dining room. \n21 39.  As a direct result of Defendants’ discriminatory staffing practices, residents with \n22 disabilities have not received or run a substantial risk of not receiving the personal services, \n23 emergency and evacuation response, dining services, housekeeping and laundry services, \n24 transportation, and activities for which they are paying and that are necessary for full and equal \n25 enjoyment of Defendants’ goods, services, facilities, benefits, advantages and accommodations. \nImpact of Understaffing on Personal Services \n26\n27 40.  The lack of sufficient numbers of trained staff at BROOKDALE means that \n28   13\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 15 of 91\n \n1 residents with disabilities who need and pay for assistance with bathing, dressing, brushing their \n2 teeth, toileting, incontinence care, and other hygiene assistance do not receive it on a routine basis.  \n3 Scheduled showers are routinely skipped by staff who do not have time to bathe residents.  Staff \n4 often leave residents unattended on the toilet because another resident has activated their call \n5 pendant, and there is no one else available to respond.  Residents have been left on their bed \n6 undressed by staff called away to attend to other residents in need. \n7 41.  Residents who need assistance getting to the bathroom often wait for long periods \n8 of time for staff to respond to their call pendants.  Because they must wait so long for assistance, \n9 some residents have given up using the toilet altogether, instead relying on adult briefs and a \n10 caregiver to clean and change them when they have time.  Incontinent residents often wait for \n11 thirty minutes or more for a staff member to help them change out of soiled briefs, raising the risk \n12 of urinary tract infections and decubitus ulcers.  For example, an inspector from Community Care \n13 Licensing found in May 2016 that BROOKDALE San Pablo had insufficient staff to meet the \n14 residents’ needs, noting that “[i]ndividuals requiring incontinence care are not always changed in a \n15 timely manner.”  In November 2016, a licensing inspector found that even though a resident at \n16 BROOKDALE Cherry Hills was paying for regular incontinence checks, she was left lying on the \n17 floor for an extended amount of time after a fall because staff failed to check on her.  In March of \n18 2017, a licensing inspector cited BROOKDALE Palm Springs for not providing a resident with \n19 those basic and personal care services—assistance with showering, dressing, transportation and \n20 medication—that the resident needed and for which the facility was being paid. \n21 42.  Insufficient staffing has also caused and continues to cause errors in medication \n22 administration, including providing the wrong dosage or the wrong medication, untimely or \n23 missed doses, and/or a failure to implement physicians’ orders.  Community Care Licensing has \n24 documented several recent examples from BROOKDALE’s Sonoma County facilities that \n25 illustrate the broader problem.  Community Care Licensing records show that the agency cited \n26 BROOKDALE Chanate five times on consecutive visits between October 28, 2015 and October \n27 13, 2016 for failing to give residents their prescribed medications.  At BROOKDALE Windsor, a \n28   14\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 16 of 91\n \n1 resident recently received a double dose of medication because the nurse who administered the \n2 first dose failed to document that it had been given.  On a different occasion, staff gave a resident \n3 at BROOKDALE Windsor a medication that had been prescribed for a different resident.  \n4 Meanwhile, at BROOKDALE Rohnert Park, licensing inspectors found that staff were not \n5 properly trained on storing and administering residents’ medication, leading to a narcotic pill that \n6 went missing in August 2016 and staff’s failure to administer medications in October 2016.  \n7 Numerous other reports issued by Community Care Licensing confirm that problems with \n8 medication administration pervade Defendants’ facilities throughout California.  For example, \n9 Community Care Licensing cited BROOKDALE Palm Springs when 20 residents missed their \n10 medication doses on December 24, 2016 because there was no med tech on duty. \n11 43.  BROOKDALE’s understaffing creates many dangerous situations for residents.  \n12 Among those are an increase in elopements from facilities by persons with cognitive impairments, \n13 because the facilities do not hire staff in sufficient numbers or with the training necessary to \n14 monitor residents and prevent escapes.  For example, BROOKDALE Oceanside was cited in April \n15 and September of 2016 for relying on delayed egress systems to compensate for insufficient \n16 staffing, resulting in resident elopements.  An informal conference was held by Community Care \n17 Licensing with BROOKDALE Oceanside management in December 2016 as a result of the \n18 elopements and other compliance failures.  Subsequently, on April 26, 2017, BROOKDALE staff \n19 failed to monitor residents on an outing, and one wandered away for approximately an hour. \n  Impact of Understaffing on Pendant Call Systems and Medical Emergencies \n20\n21 44.  BROOKDALE’S failure to staff sufficiently results in caregivers’ inability to \n22 respond promptly to call pendants, if at all.  BROOKDALE has represented that residents who \n23 wear a call pendant, and pay a monthly fee for this service, may push a button to alert staff if they \n24 have an emergency, and staff will immediately respond to provide assistance.  Residents with \n25 disabilities rely heavily on these call pendants for assistance with basic tasks and activities of daily \n26 living, as well as for emergencies.  However, the call pendants do not notify staff of the resident’s \n27 location should they not be in their room.  A BROOKDALE San Ramon resident fell and hit his \n28   15\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 17 of 91\n \n1 head on the pavement in the facility parking lot and pressed his pendant.  No one responded.  \n2 Bleeding profusely from his head, he used his mobile phone to call the front desk.  The son of \n3 another resident, a fire chief with emergency response training, found the resident in the parking \n4 lot just as BROOKDALE’s bookkeeper and maintenance director responded to the resident’s \n5 telephone call.  Because those employees have no caregiver or emergency response training, they \n6 would not even touch the resident.  The fire chief had to call 911 and administer first aid while \n7 waiting. \n8 45.  Moreover, contrary to Defendants’ representations, staff do not immediately \n9 respond when residents use their call pendants.  For instance, a resident in the BROOKDALE \n10 Paso Robles facility pushed her emergency pendant after falling in her room and waited 22 hours \n11 on the floor with broken bones until staff finally found her.  A resident at BROOKDALE \n12 Fountaingrove fell, injured her head, pressed her call pendant, and waited thirty minutes bleeding \n13 profusely from her head before staff arrived.  She died 10 days later.  In January 2017, a former \n14 resident of BROOKDALE Fountaingrove waited three hours for staff to respond to a call.  \n15 BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of not maintaining its call pendant system properly and of \n16 not providing sufficient staff to respond to call pendants deprives residents with disabilities of full \n17 and equal enjoyment of its goods, services, facilities, and benefits. \n18 46.  Community Care Licensing records indicate lengthy emergency response times at \n19 Defendants’ facilities throughout California.  For example, in February 2017 a licensing inspector \n20 found that staff at BROOKDALE Riverside routinely took over 10 minutes to respond to \n21 emergency pendant calls, and on one occasion took 36 minutes to respond.  At BROOKDALE \n22 Orangevale, a licensing inspector tested an emergency call pendant during a January 2017 visit \n23 and found that it took over 45 minutes for facility staff to respond.  At BROOKDALE North \n24 Tarzana, a review of the facility’s records revealed numerous response times of over 30 minutes, \n25 including multiple response times of over an hour.  A licensing inspector who tested emergency \n26 pull cords at BROOKDALE Chatsworth found that it took staff 24 minutes to respond during a \n27 June 2016 inspection; during another visit, the inspector found that it took staff 30 minutes to \n28   16\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 18 of 91\n \n1 respond, and that they did so only after the inspector alerted the facility administrators.  At \n2 BROOKDALE Oceanside, an inspector found that as of April and May 2016, there were times \n3 when staff did not answer residents’ calls for 15 to 45 minutes.  The inspector’s report noted that \n4 there were only two direct caregivers on duty during the day and evening shifts at the facility, \n5 which has a capacity of 186 residents, and that those caregivers were responsible for numerous \n6 tasks in addition to answering emergency calls on two floors.  Community Care Licensing cited \n7 BROOKDALE Fountaingrove at the end of March 2017 after a review of the pendant system \n8 report revealed many instances of extremely lengthy response times, noting in particular a pendant \n9 pressed at 5:23 p.m. which was not answered for over 39 minutes and a pendant set off at 5:45 \n10 p.m. to which staff did not respond for one hour and 27 minutes. \n11 47.  Even when Defendants’ staff do respond within a reasonable amount of time to a \n12 request for assistance, the response is often inadequate.  In one case, staff at BROOKDALE \n13 Fountaingrove failed to notify a resident’s family after the resident had a fall and was sent to the \n14 emergency room.  Staff also failed to send identifying information or documents with the resident, \n15 as required by Defendants’ policies and procedures.  As a result, the resident was listed as a Jane \n16 Doe until the next morning.  A doctor at the hospital told the resident’s daughter that he would \n17 have operated on the resident shortly after she was admitted, but had to wait until the next \n18 morning because he had no family contact numbers to call.  The Community Care Licensing \n19 inspector who investigated this incident noted that she observed insufficient staffing at \n20 BROOKDALE Fountaingrove to ensure that the facility’s own policies and procedures were being \n21 followed.  On another occasion, a BROOKDALE Fountaingrove resident pressed the call button \n22 on her pendant because she could tell she was going to have terrible diarrhea.  While she waited \n23 for a response, the resident headed for the toilet, but by the time she got there, she had already \n24 soiled herself and her nightgown.  Although a caregiver responded to the pendant call, when the \n25 caregiver looked in the bathroom and saw the resident sitting on the toilet, she left without \n26 providing assistance and never returned.  The resident screamed for help and pressed the \n27 emergency button next to the toilet, but no one responded until roughly an hour later, when a new \n28   17\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 19 of 91\n \n1 set of caregivers started their shifts. \n2 48.  Residents must resort to calling 911 for assistance when staff fail to promptly \n3 respond to their call pendants.  For example, public records kept by the Rincon Valley & Windsor \n4 Fire Protection Districts revealed that in a one-year period from June 2016 through May 2017, the \n5 agency responded to 83 emergency calls from 907 Adele Drive, the address of BROOKDALE \n6 Windsor.  Community Care Licensing records indicate that this facility has a capacity of 80, but \n7 often has fewer than 70 residents, suggesting that BROOKDALE Windsor residents averaged well \n8 over one 911 call per person over the past year.  Many of these calls were classified as “medical \n9 assists,” meaning the Rincon Valley & Windsor Fire Protection Districts provided assistance to \n10 another group or agency that had primary responsibility for medical care, such as assisting with \n11 moving a heavy patient.  Several of these 911 calls were classified as instances where a member of \n12 the public called the fire protection districts for routine help, such as assisting a person in returning \n13 to a bed or chair, with no transport or medical treatment given. \n14 49.  In other cases, Defendants’ staff failed to monitor residents’ health status as \n15 promised, placing residents in danger and distress in situations where the resident was not able to \n16 call for help.  At BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, one resident was left in her wheelchair all night \n17 because she requires staff assistance to get in and out of her wheelchair, but staff failed to help her \n18 into bed and never checked on her during the night.  In another case, a resident at BROOKDALE \n19 Scotts Valley fell in his apartment and went without food or water for 24 to 30 hours because staff \n20 failed to check on him.  The resident was taken to a hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with \n21 dehydration and rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which damaged skeletal muscle tissue breaks \n22 down and the damaged muscle cells are released into the bloodstream, causing further injury.  At \n23 BROOKDALE Riverside, a resident fell while outside and suffered severe sunburns because staff \n24 failed to regularly check on him.  In November 2016, Community Care Licensing issued a citation \n25 to BROOKDALE Hemet based on an incident in which staff left a resident with a known risk of \n26 falling unattended in a dining room chair.  The resident fell and hit his head, requiring ten stitches.  \n27 Just three days later, Defendants’ staff again left the resident unattended, and he fell and re-injured \n28   18\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 20 of 91\n \n1 his head.  The licensing inspector noted that this resident had additional staff supervision as part of \n2 his care plan, but that BROOKDALE Hemet lacked sufficient staff to meet the resident’s needs. \n3 50.  Because Defendants’ staff are stretched so thin responding to emergency calls and \n4 attending to their other duties, they have attempted to dissuade residents from calling for \n5 assistance.  Residents have been told by overworked caregivers to use their call buttons “only in \n6 an emergency,” despite the fact that, short of screaming for help, this is the only way to alert \n7 caregivers that they need the assistance for which they are paying BROOKDALE.  In many \n8 instances, residents feel bad for overworked caregivers and attempt to perform tasks on their own, \n9 despite paying BROOKDALE for these services.  This has led to residents’ falling or otherwise \n10 injuring themselves. \n  Impact of Understaffing on Dining Services \n11\n12 51.  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing has resulted in its cutting \n13 staffing hours and eliminating positions in dining services.  As a result, residents wait for long \n14 periods of time to be served.  Some residents give up in frustration.  Food is often served cold, and \n15 residents do not dare to make a special request, for fear that the wait will be extreme.  Moreover, \n16 the quality of the food has so deteriorated that it is in many cases nearly inedible.  Fresh \n17 ingredients are rare, meat of poor quality is hidden under sauces, and both residents and licensing \n18 inspectors have encountered food beyond its expiration date.  The understaffing also prevents staff \n19 from maintaining a clean and hygienic dining area. \n20 52.  At BROOKDALE San Ramon, the hours of serving staff were cut, and servers \n21 have left as a result, leaving the dining department severely understaffed.  At breakfast, there is \n22 often one server for 80 people.  On at least one day during June 2017, there were no servers in the \n23 dining room for breakfast, and the activities director was cleaning the tables while the chef both \n24 cooked and served meals.  At BROOKDALE Windsor, licensing inspectors found a single staff \n25 member working morning shifts in the dining room, with dirty dishes and food droppings strewn \n26 about because no other staff members were available to clean up.  BROOKDALE Riverside \n27 received a Community Care Licensing citation after investigators found that food was served cold \n28   19\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 21 of 91\n \n1 and residents had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for food to be served.  The investigator \n2 attributed this problem to understaffing, noting in her report that “[i]t was revealed there is not \n3 enough servers for the number of residents in the dining room at one time.”  On a recent visit to \n4 BROOKDALE Corona, the licensing inspector found five residents sitting in the dining room \n5 without supervision, and noted that caregivers were expected to serve lunch, clean the dining room \n6 after meals, and sweep the floors in the dining room in addition to their other duties.  The same \n7 inspector found uncovered and dried-out ham and cheese sandwiches in the refrigerator and \n8 unrefrigerated cartons of strawberry milk in a cupboard. \n9 53.  The long waits and substandard meals in the dining room mean that some residents \n10 either purchase their own food or often forgo meals altogether, despite the fact that residents are \n11 paying BROOKDALE for three meals per day and snacks.  Residents’ nutrition needs are not \n12 being met, and to the extent that they look forward to meals as a pleasant social experience, they \n13 are being deprived of that benefit as well.  Residents have made numerous complaints to \n14 Defendants about the dining service, individually and through the family and resident councils.  \n15 For example, the Resident Council at BROOKDALE San Ramon has been complaining about the \n16 problems in dining services for at least two years.  Yet residents have seen no durable \n17 improvements. There may be temporary improvements from time to time, but the overall trend is \n18 actually downward. \n  Impact of Understaffing on Housekeeping and Laundry \n19\n20 54.  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing extends to housekeeping and \n21 laundry services.  For example, on information and belief, BROOKDALE San Ramon currently \n22 only one housekeeper to clean approximately 80 rooms.  As a result, the maintenance director \n23 must also clean rooms and consequently has less time to perform maintenance duties.  Residents’ \n24 rooms have been left in deplorable and often unsanitary conditions, including toilet seats and \n25 showers covered in feces and rooms which smell strongly of urine. \n26 55.  BROOKDALE routinely fails to wash residents’ personal belongings and bed \n27 linens.  Even when BROOKDALE’s staff take these items for laundering, residents’ clothes and \n28   20\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 22 of 91\n \n1 linens are often lost, or they are given back other residents’ clothing or linen instead of their own.  \n2 Residents are left in dirty and malodorous clothing.  For example, Loresia Vallette, the \n3 granddaughter of former BROOKDALE Hemet resident LAWRENCE QUINLAN observed that \n4 her grandfather’s clothes were never washed, and that staff continued to dress him in the same pair \n5 of urine-stained pants.  Some residents or their family members have despaired of waiting and \n6 begun to perform these services on their own, despite BROOKDALE’s promise to provide them \n7 as part of their base rate. \nDiscrimination in Transportation/Activities \n8\n9 56.  Due to chronic understaffing at Defendants’ facilities, promised transportation \n10 services and activities are often sporadic or nonexistent.  Many residents rely on BROOKDALE \n11 for transportation to medical and lab appointments, church, grocery shopping, banking and other \n12 activities.  Additionally, they expected and would enjoy both on- and off-site activities.  Yet they \n13 do not receive these services on a regular basis, if at all.  Scheduled activities—such as poker, \n14 bingo and movies—are frequently cancelled, and BROOKDALE regularly fails to provide the \n15 promised transportation services to its residents.  Residents are often told about cancellations at \n16 the last minute for shuttles to planned events, such as church services.  The lack of staffing at \n17 BROOKDALE San Ramon means that its activities director must fulfill multiple duties.  In \n18 addition to her expected duties, she often works in the dining room serving food or cleaning and at \n19 the front desk as a receptionist.  She is also the only driver for facility-provided transportation.  On \n20 several occasions, residents of BROOKDALE San Ramon have been left waiting outside a \n21 medical office or a church because BROOKDALE staff forgot to pick them up and had to rely on \n22 others to take them back to the facility. \n23 57.  Additionally, BROOKDALE has implemented policies and practices regarding its \n24 provision of transportation services that discriminate against persons with mobility disabilities.  \n25 Residents at BROOKDALE San Ramon who use wheelchairs must be able to transfer from their \n26 chairs to a seat in the bus, despite the existence of a wheelchair lift and a system for securing \n27 wheelchairs in at least one of BROOKDALE San Ramon’s buses.  Making this transfer is \n28   21\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 23 of 91\n \n1 impossible and/or unsafe for many wheelchair users.  The facility also requires wheelchair users to \n2 arrange for a family member or an outside care attendant to accompany them on any off-site \n3 activity, which deters many wheelchair users from participating and imposes a surcharge on those \n4 who do.  The facility also limits the number of wheelchair users for each off-site trip to two.  At \n5 BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, wheelchair users are limited to two off-site trips per month.  At \n6 least one wheelchair user at BROOKDALE San Ramon was told that she could not participate in \n7 regular Saturday trips to the grocery store and shopping, because the driver “couldn’t handle her.” \n8   Emergency Evacuation Procedures \n9 58.  BROOKDALE has emergency and evacuation policies and procedures in place for \n10 at least some of its facilities, but these policies and procedures do not take into account the needs \n11 of persons with disabilities, or if they do, Defendants have not informed the residents.  Residents \n12 with disabilities have been told to wait in their rooms for someone to come, and although the \n13 facilities have emergency drills, staff have not demonstrated for residents what will happen in the \n14 event of an actual emergency. \n15 59.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that these practices \n16 have been and are an official policy and practice by which Defendants operate their businesses \n17 and/or services. \n18 60.  Defendants’ failure and refusal to provide equal services to persons with disabilities \n19 is humiliating and degrading to and creates a serious safety risk for the members of the proposed \n20 class of persons with disabilities. \n21 61.  Defendants are responsible for their illegal operations and discriminatory policies \n22 and practices as described herein.  BROOKDALE residents, their family members, and staff \n23 members have raised these issues repeatedly with members of BROOKDALE management to no \n24 avail.   \n25 62.  Defendants have been notified of the civil rights violations described herein, but \n26 have refused to provide necessary reasonable modifications to its staffing policies, practices and \n27 procedures to provide residents with disabilities full and equal enjoyment of its goods, services, \n28   22\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 24 of 91\n \n1 facilities, activities, benefits and accommodations and to comply with the requirements of the \n2 ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act as alleged herein.  \n3  \nBROOKDALE MISREPRESENTS, MAKES MISLEADING STATEMENTS, AND \n4 CONCEALS MATERIAL FACTS ABOUT THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF \nCARE IT PROVIDES TO ALL RESIDENTS \n5\n6 63.  As a result of Defendants’ corporate policies and practices, BROOKDALE subjects \n7 all residents, regardless of disability, to a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and \n8 services they require and have paid for on any given day, as described in Paragraphs 34-58.  \n9 BROOKDALE lures residents to move into or stay at its facilities by misrepresenting in various \n10 corporate written materials that it will provide the basic, personal, and therapeutic services each \n11 resident needs based on individualized assessments performed by BROOKDALE staff, and by \n12 failing to disclose and concealing that it cannot provide the promised services to all residents \n13 because its facilities are chronically understaffed. \n \n14 Standardized Residency Agreements \n15 64.  In order to move in to one of BROOKDALE’s California facilities, residents must \n16 sign one of Defendants’ standardized Residency Agreements.  In its standardized Residency \n17 Agreement, BROOKDALE represents to residents prior to move-in and throughout their residency \n18 that it will provide them with a standard set of basic services, additional personal services \n19 identified in the Personal Service Plan, and any select and therapeutic services for which the \n20 resident chooses to pay.  At the time of signing the Residency Agreement, residents or their \n21 responsible parties are required to confirm that they have reviewed and understood the document. \n22 65.  In Section I.A of its standardized Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE \n23 affirmatively represents to prospective residents that “[i]n order to provide you with care, \n24 supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet your needs, \n25 we will provide you with the following Basic Services”: accommodations, including a residential \n26 suite and use of common areas; three meals a day plus snacks 24 hours a day; basic utilities; “light \n27 housekeeping once a week”; weekly laundry service of the resident’s “personal belongings and \n28   23\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 25 of 91\n \n1 bed linens”; “planned social and recreational programs”; transportation services; and staffing by \n2 “Community associates … available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.”  Section I.A further \n3 represents that BROOKDALE will observe the resident’s “health status to identify social and \n4 health care needs” and “will consult with you regarding social and health-related issues.”  In \n5 addition, BROOKDALE represents in Section I.A of its standardized Residency Agreement that \n6 “[w]e will provide personal services that are included as part of the personal service assessment.” \n7 66.  In Section I.B of its standardized Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE represents \n8 that “[p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use a personal \n9 service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  The personal service \n10 assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.”   \n11 67.  Defendants’ standardized price schedule for personal care services is attached to \n12 the standardized Residency Agreement.  This price schedule includes a variety of personal \n13 services, such as staff assistance with ordering, storing, and taking medication; staff assistance \n14 with eating, dressing, bathing, using the toilet, and other activities of daily living; escort and \n15 mobility assistance to get around Defendants’ facilities; and help taking care of residents’ pets.  \n16 This price schedule lists the monthly costs of each service and details how Defendants’ caregivers \n17 and other staff will provide the services.  For instance, a resident may require and agree to pay for \n18 “[s]taff attention while you administer your insulin injections”; “additional staff involvement” for \n19 residents who are reluctant to accept care; and bathroom assistance such as “reminders to get to \n20 the bathroom,” “pulling up and down pants, handling toilet paper, wiping, changing protective \n21 undergarments and getting onto and off of toilet,” as well as “weight-bearing or balance assistance \n22 from one associate” for residents “unable to stand independently while using the bathroom.” \n23 68.  BROOKDALE repeats these representations in the Personal Service Plan that it \n24 prepares for each resident before the resident moves in and updates periodically throughout his or \n25 her residency.  The Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff assistance that the resident \n26 requires and has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each.  For example, the Personal \n27 Service Plan for one former resident states that Defendants’ staff will “[p]rovide physical \n28   24\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 26 of 91\n \n1 assistance to and from the dining room and/or community activities as needed” for a monthly fee \n2 of $273.  Standardized language in the Personal Service Plan states that “[t]he Personal Service \n3 Assessment and the Physician Plan of Care are used to determine the personal services that you \n4 require at move-in and periodically throughout your residency.  The Personal Service Assessment \n5 will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.” \n6 69.  Pursuant to Sections I.B and III.F of its standardized Residency Agreement, “[t]he \n7 results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your personal care needs, and the cost of \n8 providing the additional personal services (the ‘Personal Service Rate’) will be shared with you,” \n9 and a change in the Personal Service Plan be offered or required “when we determine additional \n10 services are requested or required” and after 60 days’ written notice has been provided. \n11 70.  In Section I.C of its standardized Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE represents \n12 that it will make “Select Services and Therapeutic Services … available to you at your request,” \n13 but that the fees for these services are not included in the rates residents pay for basic services and \n14 personal services.  Defendants’ standardized Residency Agreement incorporates by reference a \n15 standardized price list which features prices for the select and therapeutic services that Defendants \n16 make available, many of which consist of staff assistance with the resident’s activities of daily \n17 living.  For example, residents may elect to pay for tray service in their rooms for up to three \n18 meals a day or for additional laundry and housekeeping services beyond what is provided in the \n19 basic service rate. \n20 71.  Every month, BROOKDALE sends each resident or his or her legal representative \n21 an invoice for services that the company represents it will provide the following month.  These \n22 invoices list the monthly rate for basic services, the Personal Service Rate that is based on each \n23 resident’s Personal Service Plan, and any rate adjustments. \n24 \\\\\\ \n25 72.  BROOKDALE repeats these representations in the letters it periodically sends all \n26 residents informing them of increases in the rates they owe for basic services, personal services, \n27 and select and therapeutic services.  Using standardized language, Defendants’ rate increase letters \n28   25\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 27 of 91\n \n1 notify the resident of changes to his or her monthly rates for these services, which BROOKDALE \n2 attributes to increases in the cost of “providing the services you desire and depend upon.” \n3  \nDefendants’ Communications Regarding the Merger and New Assessment System \n4\n5 73.  In early 2014, Emeritus Senior Living (“Emeritus”), at the time a major chain of \n6 senior living facilities, sent residents a standardized letter informing them of the merger between \n7 BROOKDALE and Emeritus.  The letter promised that residents would not be impacted by the \n8 change but would “receive the same excellent care and service you expect at your community” \n9 and would “continue to enjoy all the amenities of your community.”  It further stated the merger \n10 would create a “senior living company offering the most comprehensive set of senior care \n11 solutions” with a commitment to “customer-focused cultures and a commitment to continuous \n12 improvement and innovation.”  Rather than inform residents that the merger would result in even \n13 lower staffing levels and poorly trained staff, the letter promised a continuum of care with likely \n14 improvements. \n15 74.  In or about October 2015, BROOKDALE sent residents a standardized letter \n16 informing them of an upgrade to its community assessment and care planning system effective \n17 December 1, 2015.  The upgrade would involve a conversion to a “new personal service system” \n18 which would “enhance our ability to match your needs and preferences with the right services at \n19 the right time.”  The letter promised “benefits from enhancements,” which included, inter alia, \n20 “[p]ersonalized service planning and care systems.” \n21 75.  Based on these representations, Plaintiffs, and the putative class members \n22 reasonably expected that the merger would result in improvements in care, or at the very least, \n23 would not result in a decline in services.  Additionally, they reasonably expected that the \n24 conversion to the new assessment and care planning system would result in improved delivery of \n25 basic services, personal services, and select and therapeutic services for which they were paying. \n26 \\\\\\ \n27 \\\\\\ \n28   26\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 28 of 91\n \nDefendants’ Marketing Materials \n1\n2 76.  Defendants’ public website, www.brookdaleliving.com, prominently features \n3 online marketing materials directed at prospective residents.  In a section of its website entitled \n4 “What is Assisted Living?”, BROOKDALE claims that its “assisted living communities have staff \n5 and programs in place that support and assist residents with daily living and basic care in a \n6 homelike or apartment setting.  Residents receive three meals a day, recreational and social \n7 activities, housekeeping, linen service, apartment maintenance and transportation.  That means \n8 your loved one gets all the benefits of retired life, without the hassle of daily chores.” \n9 77.  Defendants’ online marketing materials also tout the personalized services that its \n10 assisted living facilities provide.  The company’s website explains that “[o]ur trained caregivers \n11 provide attention and assistance with medication support, bathing, dressing, cooking and other \n12 tasks throughout the day.  Our staff will also coordinate services with outside healthcare providers \n13 and monitor residents to ensure they are healthy so your loved one gets the care they need while \n14 enjoying the quality of life they’ve earned.” \n15 78.  Defendants’ online marketing materials promise a “Culinary Arts” program that \n16 uses “only the freshest meat, seafood, produce, herbs, and spices.” \n17 79.  Defendants’ online marketing materials further represent that “[a]t Brookdale, we \n18 believe in delivering senior care that’s tailored to you and your loved one based on those unique \n19 needs and desires.  That’s why we provide a variety of options.  This personalized approach \n20 ensures that you and your family get exactly what you need without paying for what you don’t.” \n21 \\\\\\ \n22 80.  BROOKDALE represents to prospective and current residents that it tailors its \n23 services to residents’ personal needs.  According to Defendants’ representations, the process \n24 begins with an individualized assessment, which BROOKDALE uses to produce a Personal \n25 Service Plan for each resident.  The Personal Service Plan includes a list of services for which the \n26 resident pays a monthly fee.  Defendants’ affirmative representations give rise to a reasonable \n27 expectation on the part of the reasonable consumer that BROOKDALE will determine and then \n28   27\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 29 of 91\n \n1 provide the amount of caregiver and other staff time that is necessary to provide the personal \n2 services for which residents are paying. \n3 81.  BROOKDALE makes similar representations in the standardized marketing folder \n4 it distributes to prospective and incoming residents.  In this marketing folder, BROOKDALE \n5 represents that at its facilities, “Carefully selected and trained associates do more than assist with \n6 activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing and dispending of medications; they implement \n7 custom care plans designed to meet the individual needs of each resident … It all begins with a \n8 Personal Service Assessment.  We take the time to listen to our residents so that we understand \n9 how to establish clinical, dining and program support that works for them in a meaningful way.  \n10 We recognize their individual needs and preferences and respond to them accordingly.  So, \n11 whether it’s a scented lotion, a unique snack, a favorite recipe or a lifelong interest, we integrate \n12 everything we learn to create a truly individualized living experience.”  Elsewhere in this \n13 marketing folder, BROOKDALE represents that it “provide[s] customized care solutions to meet \n14 residents’ unique needs and complement their vision for all the places they would still like their \n15 lives to go.  From our trained staff to our wide variety of amenities and activities, we strive to \n16 offer personalized care and exceptional service at competitive and affordable rates.  Fees for care \n17 and services are based on each resident’s needs and preferences, as determined by the Living \n18 Accommodation selected and their Personal Service Plan … This provides customer value because \n19 our residents only pay for what they need and want.” (Emphasis in original).  BROKDALE’s \n20 marketing folder also promises an industry-leading dining services program that “continue[s] to \n21 satisfy the preferences and nutritional needs of residents with dining choices that offer mealtime \n22 fulfillment while meeting dietary requirements.” \n23 82.  Based on all of Defendants’ representations, Plaintiffs, the putative class members, \n24 and the general consuming public reasonably expect that BROOKDALE will ensure adequate \n25 staffing to perform the services promised to residents, including by providing sufficient levels of \n26 qualified and adequately trained staff to perform the services identified in each resident’s Personal \n27 Service Plan. \n28   28\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 30 of 91\n \n \n1\nDefendants’ Failures to Disclose \n2\n3 83.  Contrary to Defendants’ representations regarding its provision of services, \n4 BROOKDALE has a corporate policy and practice of staffing its facilities according to a system \n5 that ensures all BROOKDALE residents run the continuing risk of not receiving the services for \n6 which they are paying, of not having their care needs met, and of suffering injury from the lack of \n7 care. \n8 84.  In addition to the Community Care Licensing records described in Paragraphs 35-\n9 36, 39-41, 44-47, and 50, current and former residents of BROOKDALE facilities confirm that \n10 Defendants’ staffing levels do not change when updates to personal service assessments show that \n11 residents require additional personal services.  BROOKDALE has in many cases modified \n12 residents’ Personal Service Plans—and raised monthly personal service fees accordingly—even \n13 though BROOKDALE failed to conduct an updated personal service assessment, failed to provide \n14 residents or their legal representatives with the results and method of the assessment, and/or failed \n15 to provide 60 days’ written notice.  Despite paying higher fees as a result of these changes to their \n16 Personal Service Plans, residents and their families have observed that neither the services \n17 provided nor staffing levels increased and, in many cases, decreased. \n18 85.  Caregivers have informed residents that although they would like to work a 40-\n19 hour week, but BROOKDALE allows certain caregivers to work only 24 hours in a week.  \n20 Residents and their family members have also observed that BROOKDALE fails to ensure that all \n21 staff members receive necessary training.  At BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, the facility’s interim \n22 executive director admitted to residents’ families that BROOKDALE has insufficient staff to meet \n23 residents’ needs. \n24  \nBROOKDALE’S MISREPRESENTATIONS AND  \n25 CONCEALED FACTS WERE MATERIAL \n \n26\n27 86.  BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations and the facts it conceals are material to the \n28   29\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 31 of 91\n \n1 reasonable consumer.  An important and significant factor in choosing to move oneself or one’s \n2 relative to a BROOKDALE facility, to stay there after the facility was purchased by \n3 BROOKDALE, and/or to continue to agree to pay the amounts charged by BROOKDALE is the \n4 provision of staffing that is necessary to provide the services its residents need and for which the \n5 residents are paying. \n6 87.  BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements and omissions \n7 regarding its provision of staffing are material to prospective residents and their family members.  \n8 Assurances that a facility will provide the amount of staffing necessary to provide basic services \n9 and meet the personal service needs of residents based on BROOKDALE’s own assessments is a \n10 substantial factor (and indeed often the most important factor) in deciding to enter a certain \n11 facility.  The named Plaintiffs would not have, and the members of the putative class would in all \n12 reasonable probability not have, entered BROOKDALE’s facilities, or stayed at these facilities \n13 after BROOKDALE purchased them from other companies, or they would have insisted on paying \n14 a lower price, if they had known that, although BROOKDALE would charge them based on the \n15 staffing associated with their Personal Service Plans, BROOKDALE did not and does not provide \n16 adequate staffing to carry out the services identified in residents’ Personal Service Plans, nor does \n17 it provide adequate staffing to perform basic services and select and therapeutic services. \n18 88.  This is true even for residents who currently are nearly independent.  These \n19 residents chose an assisted living facility as opposed to an independent living community or \n20 remaining at home because they wish to “age in place.”  They may not currently need significant \n21 assistance with the activities of daily living initially, but they will become more dependent as they \n22 age and do not want to move again when that happens.  Moreover, even the most independent \n23 residents depend on the basic services that BROOKDALE promised them, such as food, laundry, \n24 and housekeeping.  A key factor for these residents in selecting BROOKDALE is that the facility \n25 will provide the staffing that BROOKDALE itself has determined is necessary to meet their \n26 assessed needs, both now and as those needs increase. \n27 89.  BROOKDALE has a duty to disclose that its staffing policies and procedures \n28   30\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 32 of 91\n \n1 preclude it from consistently providing basic services, personal services, and select and therapeutic \n2 services, because of, among other things, the substantial safety risk to current and future residents \n3 from BROOKDALE’s conduct. \n4 90.  The non-disclosure is material because, among other things, BROOKDALE knows \n5 that its conduct risks the safety of its residents.  In addition to individual complaints made by \n6 residents and family members, family and resident councils send regular correspondence to \n7 Executive Directors of BROOKDALE facilities, as well as regional and national mangers \n8 regarding the problems outlined above.  In the case of BROOKDALE San Ramon and \n9 BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, local and regional management employees have attended \n10 numerous meetings of the Family and Resident Councils and have made unfulfilled promises to \n11 address the concerns outlined above.  Moreover, Community Care Licensing has conducted \n12 numerous licensing inspections which are delivered to BROOKDALE executives and managers of \n13 California facilities describing the failure of various facilities to meet state laws and regulations. \n14 91.  BROOKDALE is fully aware of the facts alleged above.  Yet, BROOKDALE has \n15 failed to disclose and actively concealed from residents, prospective residents and their family \n16 members the true facts about how staffing provided at BROOKDALE’s California facilities. \n17 Barriers to Moving Out \n18 92.  BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements, and material \n19 omissions affect not only the decision of residents to enter the facility but also the decision to stay \n20 at a BROOKDALE facility. \n21 \\\\\\ \n22 93.  In choosing assisted living in general and a BROOKDALE facility in particular, the \n23 resident forgoes other options such as their former home, an independent living community, or \n24 other facilities.  Once in a facility, there are significant physical, emotional and other burdens for \n25 the residents that are triggered if they terminate residency, including impacts such as “transfer \n26 trauma.”  BROOKDALE knows and relies on this fact.  As BROOKDALE notes on its website \n27 “[a]s a resident’s health needs increase, they may transition from one level to the next—all within \n28   31\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 33 of 91\n \n1 the same community.  This provides a permanent link to friends and families for them by assuring \n2 they remain in a single location.” \n3 94.  BROOKDALE puts great effort into increasing and maintaining building \n4 occupancy to the detriment of their current and future residents.  When residents or their family \n5 members complain about staffing and/or conditions at a BROOKDALE facility, on information \n6 and belief, employees are instructed to reassure them that things will improve and that the incident \n7 or incidents are temporary snags.  For example, the Family Council of BROOKDALE \n8 Fountaingrove has been meeting every month for many months to address the inadequate staffing, \n9 slow response times to call buttons, and other health and safety issues faced by the Fountaingrove \n10 residents.  At most meetings, BROOKDALE representatives, including Vice President of \n11 Regional Operations Sharyl Ronan and Interim Executive Director Dan Devine, appear, listen to \n12 the numerous complaints, and assure those present that they are looking into the problems and all \n13 will be well.  Notwithstanding these claims, members of the Family Council report little to no \n14 changes or action items undertaken by BROOKDALE staff after these meetings. \n15 95.  Similarly, residents and family members at BROOKDALE San Ramon hold \n16 monthly Family Council and Resident Council meetings and have informed facility management, \n17 as well as Rick Flynn, District Director of Operations, Executive Director Steve Millard, \n18 Associate Executive Director Shawn Cull, and former Acting Director Bill Grady of the problems \n19 described above.  In January 2017, Mr. Flynn, Mr. Grady and Mr. Cull attended a Family Council \n20 meeting at which family members and residents demanded answers to their questions about \n21 understaffing, poorly trained staff, undelivered services, food and dining deficiencies, cancelled \n22 activities, and problems with call pendants.  They were reassured at the meeting and subsequently \n23 told by email correspondence that BROOKDALE was working “diligently” on solutions and had \n24 reached out to the District Vice President of Operations Sheila Garner, who would be helping to \n25 resolve the problems.  BROOKDALE also represented that management had “made progress in \n26 our hiring process for clinical and dining,” and was monitoring the call pendant system and \n27 providing additional training to staff.  Since that time, BROOKDALE announced the hiring of \n28   32\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 34 of 91\n \n1 additional employees but concealed from residents that it was simultaneously cutting the hours of \n2 its current employees, cuts which have led to significant staff turnover.  Residents and family \n3 members report that the problems described above have in fact worsened. \n4 96.  Such reassurances from BROOKDALE are common when residents and family \n5 members raise concerns about the quality of care and services they are receiving.  On information \n6 and belief, Regional Vice Presidents and Executive Directors are instructed to minimize potential \n7 move-outs.  Executive Directors are regularly told by upper management to do everything they \n8 can to “save” the move-out. \n9 97.  BROOKDALE thereby unjustly continues to profit from the original fraud by \n10 perpetuating the misrepresentations, misleading statements, and failures to disclose. \n11  \nNAMED PLAINTIFFS’ EXPERIENCES IN BROOKDALE FACILITIES \n12\nPatricia Eidler \n13\n14 98.  PATRICIA EIDLER has been a resident at BROOKDALE San Ramon since \n15 approximately April 27, 2013.  When Ms. EIDLER moved into the facility, it was owned and \n16 operated by Merrill Gardens LLC (“Merrill Gardens”) and was known as Merrill Gardens at San \n17 Ramon.  Prior to move-in, Ms. EIDLER, through her son and power-of-attorney, CHRIS EIDLER, \n18 read, reviewed, and signed a standardized residency agreement with Merrill Gardens.  In this \n19 agreement, Merrill Gardens promised to provide Ms. EIDLER with “standard services” that are \n20 substantially similar to the basic services enumerated in Defendants’ standardized residency \n21 agreement.  Merrill Gardens also agreed to provide Ms. EIDLER with assisted living services for \n22 her needs as determined by a pre-admission interview and assessment.  The agreement stated that \n23 Merrill Gardens would “continue to monitor your needs and periodically reassess the services \n24 being provided. …  Assessments may result in changes in the level of care you receive, as well as \n25 the associated assisted living fee.”  The agreement also provided that any change in the amount or \n26 frequency of assisted living services would result in an immediate increase in the assisted living \n27 charges. \n28   33\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 35 of 91\n \n1 99.  PATRICIA EIDLER, through her son and power-of-attorney, CHRIS EIDLER, \n2 read and reasonably understood Merrill Gardens’ representations in the residency agreement as \n3 statements that it used resident assessments to determine its residents’ needs and provide staffing \n4 levels necessary to meet those needs.  Ms. EIDLER also reasonably understood and expected that \n5 Merrill Gardens would staff the facility in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the \n6 services that Merrill Gardens had promised and that Ms. EIDLER would be paying for.  \n7 Ms. EIDLER also reasonably understood and expected that Merrill Gardens would regularly \n8 assess Ms. EIDLER to ascertain any changes in her care needs and provide that care immediately \n9 in exchange for an immediate increase in her assisted living charges, which she understood to be \n10 necessary because of the increased staffing cost associated with providing those services to her.  \n11 Ms. EIDLER, through her son and power-of-attorney, CHRIS EIDLER, read and signed the \n12 agreement acknowledging that she had reviewed and understood all of the terms contained in the \n13 agreement.  Ms. EIDLER, through her son and power-of-attorney, CHRIS EIDLER, read and \n14 relied on the representations in the residency agreement in making the decision to enter Merrill \n15 Gardens at San Ramon; she did so with the reasonable expectation that she would age in place and \n16 that as her needs increased, the facility would be able to provide increased services and \n17 corresponding caregiver time to meet those needs. \n18 100.  While the facility was operated by Merrill Gardens, Ms. EIDLER received better \n19 care.  However, it was subsequently purchased by Emeritus, and shortly thereafter became \n20 BROOKDALE San Ramon, following the Emeritus-BROOKDALE merger.  In or about April \n21 2014, CHRIS EIDLER received and read a letter from Emeritus informing residents about the \n22 merger between BROOKDALE and Emeritus.  The letter promised that residents would not be \n23 impacted by the change but would “receive the same excellent care and service you expect at your \n24 community” and would “continue to enjoy all the amenities of your community.”  It further stated \n25 the merger would create a “senior living company offering the most comprehensive set of senior \n26 care solutions” with a commitment to “consumer-focused cultures and a commitment to \n27 continuous improvement and innovation.” \n28   34\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 36 of 91\n \n1 101.  CHRIS EIDLER, as his mother’s power of attorney and legal representative, read \n2 the letter and reasonably understood and expected that the care Ms. EIDLER received would be no \n3 worse than the care she had received under Merrill Gardens, and possibly improve.  \n4 BROOKDALE did not inform the EIDLERS nor did they have any reason to believe that \n5 BROOKDALE would not staff the facility with sufficient staff in numbers and training to provide \n6 the services for which Ms. EIDLER and the other residents were paying. \n7 102.  In or about November 2015, Mr. EIDLER, as power of attorney for his mother, \n8 received new contract paperwork from BROOKDALE, entitled “AMENDMENT TO \n9 CONTINUING CARE RESIDENCE AND SERVICES AGREEMENT,” purporting to amend the \n10 residency agreement that Ms. EIDLER had signed with Merrill Gardens.  The “Schedule of \n11 Services and Rates” replaced references to “standard services” and “assisted living services” with \n12 the terms “basic service rate” and “personal service rate.” \n13 103.  Ms. EIDLER, through her legal representative and power of attorney CHRIS \n14 EIDLER, read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations—as well as Merrill \n15 Gardens’ representations in the agreement that was assigned to BROOKDALE—as statements \n16 that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and staff \n17 BROOKDALE San Ramon in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services \n18 that BROOKDALE promised and that Ms. EIDLER was paying for.  Ms. EIDLER, through \n19 CHRIS EIDLER, read and relied on these representations in making the decision to stay at the \n20 facility despite the change in ownership.  At no time has BROOKDALE informed Ms. EIDLER or \n21 her son CHRIS EIDLER that its corporate policy and procedure of providing pre-determined \n22 staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing the care and services residents \n23 have been promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the care \n24 and services they have paid for on any given day. \n25 104.  Had BROOKDALE disclosed this material fact, Mr. EIDLER would have begun \n26 looking for a new place for his mother and/or not agreed to pay the amounts BROOKDALE \n27 charged. \n28   35\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 37 of 91\n \n1 105.  Ms. EIDLER uses a walker and/or wheelchair for mobility.  In addition to her basic \n2 services, Ms. EIDLER pays to receive assistance with her medication and with bathing.  Due to \n3 understaffing at BROOKDALE San Ramon, Ms. EIDLER often waits 30 minutes or more for a \n4 response to her call pendant.  When staff do arrive, they are clearly rushed, and Ms. EIDLER feels \n5 guilty about seeking their assistance when they are overworked.  Consequently, instead of using \n6 her call pendant, she performs some of the basic and personal care services for which she pays \n7 BROOKDALE on her own or with the help of other residents, posing a safety risk.   \n8 106.  Ms. EIDLER and her family members have witnessed carelessness with \n9 medications caused by overworked staff.  On at least two occasions, Ms. EIDLER has found \n10 medication that did not belong to her in her room.  Just this month, BROOKDALE staff was \n11 unable to locate a bottle of eye medication prescribed to another resident for two days, because it \n12 had left the medication in Ms. EIDLER’s room.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that \n13 the other resident did not receive her eye medication during that time.   \n14 107.  On or about July 10, 2017, Ms. EIDLER was informed that her pain medication \n15 had been stolen from the facility.   Despite numerous requests that BROOKDALE contact Ms. \n16 EIDLER’s family regarding issues relating to her medication, the facility did not contact the \n17 family, who learned of the burglary from Ms. EIDLER. When her daughter-in-law, Sharon Eidler, \n18 asked the facility’s acting Executive Director, Shawn Cull, about the incident, he explained that \n19 the staff believed that Ms. EIDLER’s medication and that of other residents was stolen during the \n20 overnight shift (“NOC Shift”) from July 9 to 10, 2017.  When Sharon Eidler asked Mr. Cull which \n21 employees were on duty during that shift, he told her that there were only two employees on duty \n22 to respond to all residents at the facility.  The facility has an occupancy of between approximately \n23 70 to 80 residents.  Because no one was immediately available at the facility to pick up refills, Ms. \n24 EIDLER did not receive her pain medication until later that evening and was extremely anxious \n25 until that time.  Another resident’s family was not informed of the theft until almost 6 p.m., after \n26 the resident’s physician’s offices had closed and the family could not obtain a refill.  That resident \n27 was given an inadequate substitute pain medication in the evening, which was distressing to the \n28   36\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 38 of 91\n \n1 resident and her family members, who had to reassure and calm her.  The following day, although \n2 BROOKDALE was notified that the refill was ready for pick-up at 10 a.m., the resident told her \n3 family that she did not receive her prescribed pain medication until 4 p.m. \n4 108.  BROOKDALE’s staff, policies, and practices have deterred Ms. EIDLER from \n5 attending Defendants’ off-site activities with her walker.  Ms. EIDLER would like to participate in \n6 the “Monday lunches” where residents are taken off-site for lunch at nice restaurants.  However, \n7 Ms. EIDLER has a hard time climbing the steps of the bus with her walker.  When she has \n8 attended in the past, BROOKDALE staff were very impatient with Ms. EIDLER and made her \n9 feel as if her walker was a nuisance and that she should not bring it with her. \n10 109.  BROOKDALE’s discriminatory policies and practices have also deterred \n11 Ms. Eidler from attending off-site activities with her wheelchair.  BROOKDALE posted a sign in \n12 BROOKDALE San Ramon stating its official policy that wheelchair users must be accompanied \n13 by a family member or private caregiver and must be able to transfer from their wheelchair to a \n14 bus seat.  Moreover, BROOKDALE San Ramon buses are fully equipped to handle only two \n15 wheelchairs, and the staff tasked with assisting residents on these outings are unable or unwilling \n16 to operate the wheelchair harnesses.  Ms. EIDLER requires assistance transferring from her \n17 wheelchair and operating the harnesses, and does not wish to burden her family members or pay \n18 for a private caregiver, on top of the fees she already pays BROOKDALE, to attend off-site \n19 activities with her.  As a result of BROOKDALE’S discriminatory policies and practices, \n20 Ms. EIDLER has stopped participating in Defendants’ off-site activities and will continue to be so \n21 deterred unless and until BROOKDALE changes its discriminatory policies and practices. \n22 110.  Ms. EIDLER has been instructed to keep her legs elevated as much as possible to \n23 reduce the effects of edema.  Understaffing in the dining services department means that she often \n24 remain in the dining room for approximately two hours for each meal, something she cannot \n25 afford to do given her condition.  In addition to long wait times to place her orders and receive her \n26 food, Ms. EIDLER frequently receives food she did not order and/or cold food.  Ms. EIDLER \n27 used to enjoy eating lunch and dinner in the dining room.  However, the chronic understaffing and \n28   37\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 39 of 91\n \n1 poor quality of food has deterred her from doing so.  She has instead increased her budget for food \n2 purchased outside the facility.  When she does eat at the facility, she chooses the simplest \n3 offerings, such as eggs for lunch or a grilled cheese sandwich for dinner, because the food quality \n4 is so poor. \n5  \nStacia Stiner \n6\n7 111.  STACIA STINER has been a resident at BROOKDALE San Ramon since \n8 approximately February 13, 2016.  On or about February 12, 2016, STACIA STINER’s mother, \n9 Rita Stiner, read, reviewed, and signed an agreement with BROOKDALE as STACIA STINER’s \n10 legal representative and power of attorney.  As part of this “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT”, \n11 BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to provide you with care, supervision and assistance with \n12 instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the \n13 following Basic Services, which are included in the Basic Service Rate,” which included, among \n14 other things, the room, three daily meals and snacks on demand, weekly room cleaning, weekly \n15 laundry and linen service, planned activities, transportation, observation, and the availability of \n16 staff “24 hours a day, seven days a week.”  This standard residency agreement also stated that: \n17  \n[p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use a \n18 personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  The \npersonal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.  \n19 The results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your personal care needs, \nand the cost of providing the additional personal services (the “Personal Service \n20 Rate”) will be shared with you. \n \n21\n22 The Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff assistance that Ms. STINER requires and has \n23 agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of staff assistance.  In addition, \n24 Ms. STINER’s mother Rita Stiner has received and reviewed, as enclosures to BROOKDALE’s \n25 rate increase letters, a personal service schedule and list of select and therapeutic services.  These \n26 documents describe a variety of available services, list the monthly or per-occurrence fee for each \n27 service, and detail how BROOKDALE’s caregivers or other staff will provide the service.  Every \n28   38\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 40 of 91\n \n1 month, BROOKDALE sends Ms. STINER, through Rita Stiner, an invoice for services that the \n2 company impliedly represents it will provide in the following month.  These invoices list the \n3 monthly rate for the basic services set forth in BROOKDALE’s standardized residency \n4 agreements, the Personal Service Rate that is based on Ms. STINER’s Personal Service Plan, and \n5 any rate adjustments. \n6 112.  Ms. STINER, through her legal representative and power of attorney, Rita Stiner, \n7 read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations as statements that \n8 BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and staff BROOKDALE \n9 San Ramon in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services that \n10 BROOKDALE promised and Ms. STINER was paying for.  Ms. STINER, through Rita Stiner, \n11 relied on these representations in making the decision to enter BROOKDALE San Ramon.  \n12 BROOKDALE did not disclose to STACIA or Rita STINER at any time prior to her admission \n13 nor has it disclosed since that time that its corporate policy and procedure of providing pre-\n14 determined staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing the care and services \n15 residents have been promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive \n16 the care and services they have paid for on any given day.  If BROOKDALE had disclosed this \n17 material fact to STACIA and/or Rita STINER, STACIA STINER would have looked for another \n18 facility for STACIA and would not have agreed to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE.   \n19 113.  Beginning in October 2016, BROOKDALE initiated increases in Ms. STINER’s \n20 basic service and personal service rates.  Ms. STINER and her mother Rita Stiner have been \n21 unable to decipher the changes in Ms. STINER’s bills.  On or about October of 24, 2016, Rita \n22 Stiner received a letter from BROOKDALE’s Executive Director informer her that Ms. STINER’s \n23 basic service rate would increase from $3,205 to $3,429 per month and that her personal service \n24 rate would increase by approximately 6%.  During an in-person meeting in January of 2017, \n25 BROOKDALE staff told Rita Stiner that Ms. STINER’s personal service rates would rise as \n26 follows: the monthly medication management fee would rise from $567 to $631; the monthly fee \n27 for staff assistance with dressing and grooming tasks would rise from $454 to 505; the monthly \n28   39\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 41 of 91\n \n1 fee for assistance with two showers per week would rise from $113 to $631 per week (a \n2 significant increase because STACIA STINER was purportedly requiring more than the allotted \n3 20 minutes of caregiver time per shower); and the monthly fee for assistance with toileting would \n4 increase from $397 to $442.  Rita Stiner has had conversations with Shawn Cull, the acting \n5 Executive Director, during which he told her that BROOKDALE would not charge the full \n6 amount of the increases listed above.  Despite numerous communications with Mr. Cull and the \n7 billing department, the monthly bills remain confusing and BROOKDALE has sent Rita Stiner \n8 notices of late payment and even a “30-DAY FINAL DEMAND TO PAY” in December 2016, \n9 stating that “[i]n order to provide the care our residents expect and deserve and at the same time \n10 support the professional staff we employ, it’s imperative that we receive our monthly rent and any \n11 additional charges in a timely fashion.” \n12 114.  Although Ms. STINER is a wheelchair user, BROOKDALE has not provided her \n13 with a room that has any physical access features.  It does not have sufficient turning space in the \n14 bathroom area, making it difficult for Ms. STINER to enter the bathroom and impossible for \n15 Ms. STINER to turn around in the bathroom.  The bathroom does not have a roll-in shower, and \n16 the grab bars do not comply with applicable access standards, preventing her from bathing \n17 independently and creating a serious safety hazard.  Ms. STINER cannot reach most of the \n18 hanging or the storage space in her closet and therefore cannot access her clothing or other \n19 personal items without assistance from others.  Ms. STINER’s room has a balcony, but a two-inch \n20 lip leading out to the balcony and insufficient turning space once outside makes it inaccessible to \n21 Ms. STINER.  She once tried to enter and exit the balcony by herself, but has not attempted to do \n22 so since because the experience scared her.  The complete lack of accessible features in \n23 Ms. STINER’s room prevents her from being as independent as possible and causes her to rely on \n24 personal assistance from BROOKDALE staff.  In fact, Ms. STINER is charged more than $400 \n25 per month for toilet assistance because “resident is unable to use the bathroom on their own.”  \n26 BROOKDALE charges Ms. STINER an elevated rate of $631 for two showers per week because, \n27 according to BROOKDALE management, she requires more than the allotted 20 minutes per \n28   40\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 42 of 91\n \n1 shower.  Compounding this problem is BROOKDALE’s understaffing in care services, which \n2 means that Ms. STINER must wait to accomplish most of her activities of daily living, if at all.  \n3 This puts Ms. STINER in humiliating, frustrating and hazardous situations on a daily basis. \n4 115.  Despite paying approximately $600 per month for BROOKDALE to “order and \n5 coordinate medications between family, health care providers and pharmacy,” Rita Stiner must \n6 pick up medication for her daughter at least once per week, frequently with only one-day notice \n7 from BROOKDALE.  Rita Stiner also does the majority of her daughter’s laundry because \n8 BROOKDALE frequently loses her clothing or returns the wrong clothing to her. \n9 116.  Understaffing in the dining services department means that Ms. STINER has had to \n10 wait up to 45 minutes just to order breakfast.   \n11 117.  On some days, there is only one caregiver available in the mornings, causing \n12 Ms. STINER to wait anywhere from 10 minutes to one hour for assistance getting dressed.  At \n13 night, Ms. STINER requires assistance if she needs to use the toilet.  She waits anywhere from 10 \n14 minutes to an hour for staff to respond and will occasionally have to urinate in her bed when \n15 assistance takes too long to arrive.  She frequently resorts to using her mobile phone to call the \n16 outside line when staff do not respond to her call pendant.  Due to short-staffing, caregivers often \n17 attempt to leave Ms. STINER in the middle of assisting her with bathing or toileting because they \n18 must respond to call pendants from other residents or because they left another resident on the \n19 commode to respond to Ms. STINER. \n20 118.  Ms. STINER enjoys getting out of the facility and participating in off-site \n21 activities.  However, BROOKDALE requires that, because she is a wheelchair user, she be \n22 accompanied by a family member or a private personal caregiver.  Although she has been able to \n23 participate in scenic drives or lunches by herself, Ms. STINER had to pay approximately $180 for \n24 a personal assistant to participate in a trip to a casino in Cache Creek in approximately August \n25 2016.  She would like to return to Cache Creek on a future BROOKDALE outing, but is deterred \n26 by BROOKDALE’s discriminatory policy.  Outings are also frequently limited to two wheelchair \n27 users per outing on a first come, first served basis. \n28   41\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 43 of 91\n \n1 119.  In case of fire and other emergencies, BROOKDALE staff has told Ms. STINER to \n2 remain in her room until they come and get her.  However, staff members have not come to get \n3 Ms. STINER when fire alarms go off at the facility, nor have they given her any additional \n4 instructions about how they would assist her in exiting the facility. \n5  \nMary-Catherine Jones \n6\n7 120.  MARY-CATHERINE JONES has been a resident at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove \n8 in Santa Rosa since approximately January 2013.  When Ms. JONES moved into the facility, it \n9 was owned and operated by Emeritus and was known as Emeritus at Santa Rosa.  Prior to move-\n10 in, KELLY CLAPPER, acting as Ms. JONES’s legal representative and power of attorney, signed \n11 a standardized residency agreement with Emeritus.  In this agreement, Emeritus promised to \n12 provide a list of “core services” that are substantially similar to the basic services enumerated in \n13 Defendants’ standardized residency agreement.  Emeritus also agreed to “perform a \n14 comprehensive Resident Evaluation prior to your admission in the Community, regularly \n15 thereafter, and as your condition warrants, in order to determine the level of Personal Care \n16 Services that you need.  We will develop your Service Plan, based on your Resident Evaluation, \n17 that describes how we will provide these services.  You will receive services appropriate to your \n18 individual needs, as described in your Service Plan.”  The agreement reserved Emeritus’s right to \n19 assign the agreement to any successor-in-interest selected by Emeritus. \n20 121.  In 2014, BROOKDALE merged with Emeritus, and Emeritus at Santa Rosa \n21 became BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis \n22 allege, that Emeritus assigned its residency agreements with existing residents to BROOKDALE, \n23 and that BROOKDALE assumed any liability arising from those agreements.  In or about \n24 February 2014, KELLY CLAPPER received and read a letter from Emeritus informing residents \n25 about the merger between BROOKDALE and Emeritus.  The letter promised that residents would \n26 not be impacted by the change but would “receive the same excellent care and service you expect \n27 at your community” and would “continue to enjoy all the amenities of your community.”  It \n28   42\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 44 of 91\n \n1 further stated the merger would create a “senior living company offering the most comprehensive \n2 set of senior care solutions” with a commitment to “consumer-focused cultures and a commitment \n3 to continuous improvement and innovation.” \n4 122.  KELLY CLAPPER, as her mother’s power of attorney and legal representative, \n5 read the letter and reasonably understood that the care Ms. JONES received would be no worse \n6 than the care she had received under Emeritus, and possibly improve.  BROOKDALE did not \n7 inform Ms. JONES or Ms. CLAPPER nor did they have any reason to believe that BROOKDALE \n8 would not staff the facility with sufficient staff in numbers and training to provide the services for \n9 which Ms. JONES and the other residents were paying.   \n10 123.  On November 18, 2015, KELLY CLAPPER read, reviewed, and signed an \n11 agreement with BROOKDALE as Ms. JONES’s legal representative and power of attorney.  This \n12 agreement, entitled “AMENDMENT TO CONTINUING CARE RESIDENCE AND SERVICES \n13 AGREEMENT,” amended the residency agreement that Ms. JONES signed with Emeritus and \n14 that was assigned to BROOKDALE after the merger with Emeritus.  Pursuant to this amendment, \n15 references to “core services” and “personal care services” were replaced with the terms “basic \n16 services” and “personal services,” and Emeritus’s price schedules for various services were \n17 replaced with BROOKDALE’s standardized personal services price schedule and lists of select \n18 and therapeutic services.  The parties agreed that except as otherwise amended, the terms of the \n19 prior residency agreement would remain in full force and effect. \n20 124.  BROOKDALE has also prepared and periodically updated a Personal Service Plan \n21 for Ms. JONES.  Ms. JONES’s Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff assistance that \n22 Ms. JONES requires and has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of staff \n23 assistance.  In addition, Ms. JONES has received and reviewed, as enclosures to BROOKDALE’s \n24 rate increase letters, a personal service schedule and list of select and therapeutic services.  These \n25 documents describe a variety of available services, list the monthly or per-occurrence fee for each \n26 service, and detail how BROOKDALE’s caregivers or other staff will provide the service.  Every \n27 month, BROOKDALE sends Ms. JONES, through KELLY CLAPPER, an invoice for services \n28   43\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 45 of 91\n \n1 that the company impliedly represents it will provide in the following month.  These invoices list \n2 the monthly rate for the basic services set forth in BROOKDALE’s standardized residency \n3 agreements, the Personal Service Rate that is based on Ms. Jones’s Personal Service Plan, and any \n4 rate adjustments. \n5 125.  Ms. JONES, through her legal representative and power of attorney KELLY \n6 CLAPPER, read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations—as well as \n7 Emeritus’s representations in the agreement that was assigned to BROOKDALE and expressly \n8 incorporated into BROOKDALE’s November 18, 2015 agreement with Ms. JONES—as \n9 statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and staff \n10 BROOKDALE Fountaingrove in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services \n11 that BROOKDALE promised and Ms. JONES was paying for.  Ms. JONES, through KELLY \n12 CLAPPER, read and relied on these representations in making the decision to remain at the \n13 facility despite the change in ownership. \n14 126.  BROOKDALE currently charges Ms. JONES a basic service rate of $3,790 per \n15 month, plus a personal service rate of $2,436 per month, minus a loyalty credit.  Ms. JONES’s \n16 personal service rate includes, among other things, a $580 monthly fee for BROOKDALE’s \n17 providing “attention and/or assistance with taking medications[] … [and] [a]ssist[ing] with \n18 medication storage,” a $116 monthly fee for staff assistance with the “setup, selection, or laying \n19 out of clothes or grooming toiletries,” a $116 monthly fee for staff assistance with showering, a \n20 $348 monthly fee for staff assistance to “accomplish and/or participate in daily routines due to \n21 memory loss or cognitive impairment,” a $460 monthly fee due to Ms. JONES’s “demonstrated \n22 reluctance to accept care related to showering or bathing assistance,” a $290 monthly fee for \n23 “demonstrating anxious, disruptive or obsessive behavior,” a $58 monthly fee because the \n24 “resident smokes,” and a $464 monthly fee for “pet care assistance.”   \n25 127.  Although Ms. JONES’s Personal Service Plan includes a monthly fee for staff \n26 assistance with medications, BROOKDALE’s staff have regularly failed to provide that service as \n27 promised.  In May 2016, Ms. JONES’s doctor changed her blood pressure medication.  The doctor \n28   44\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 46 of 91\n \n1 sent BROOKDALE Fountaingrove the instructions for administering the new medication, and \n2 Ms. JONES’s daughter, Drue Rostel, personally dropped off the medication at BROOKDALE \n3 Fountaingrove, alerting staff to be on the lookout for the new doctor’s orders.  However, staff at \n4 BROOKDALE Fountaingrove failed to give Ms. JONES the new medication.  When Ms. Rostel \n5 visited BROOKDALE Fountaingrove several days after dropping off the new medication, staff \n6 told her they had no idea that there had been a change, and they could not locate the new \n7 medication.  Staff also failed to log Ms. JONES’s blood pressure as requested by her doctor.  As a \n8 result of these errors, Ms. JONES’s doctor had to cancel an appointment that had been scheduled \n9 to review Ms. JONES’s health status and the effectiveness of the new medication.  Ms. Rostel and \n10 Ms. CLAPPER filed a complaint with Community Care Licensing, which investigated the \n11 incident, found that the complaint was substantiated, and issued a citation to BROOKDALE.  Just \n12 two months later, BROOKDALE’s staff again failed to follow medication instructions sent by \n13 Ms. JONES’s doctor. \n14 128.  Notwithstanding the high fees paid for medication monitoring, Plaintiff MARY-\n15 CATHERINE JONES’ daughter recently discovered that Ms. JONES was taking an entire pill of \n16 the anti-anxiety medication prescribed by her physicians—not a half-pill as the physician ordered.  \n17 This discovery was made two months after Ms. JONES began sleeping through lunch daily and \n18 losing five pounds per month.  Ms. JONES’s daughters were not informed of the medication error \n19 or the excessive sleepiness for weeks. \n20 129.  Although Ms. JONES pays a monthly fee for staff assistance with showers and \n21 dressing and grooming, Ms. Rostel and Ms. CLAPPER have observed that staff at BROOKDALE \n22 Fountaingrove regularly fail to bathe or dress Ms. JONES.  In addition, Ms. Rostel and \n23 Ms. CLAPPER have observed that Ms. JONES’s laundry is almost never done, and that in one \n24 period, staff went several weeks without laundering Ms. JONES’s clothes, even though weekly \n25 laundry service is part of Ms. JONES’ monthly Basic Service Rate. \n26 130.  In October 2016, Ms. JONES’s Personal Service Plan was amended to add a \n27 monthly fee for staff assistance with Ms. JONES’s pet dog, which included daily feeding, taking \n28   45\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 47 of 91\n \n1 the dog on daily walks, and letting the dog outside to relieve himself multiple times per day.  \n2 However, over the course of several months, staff at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove failed to feed \n3 the dog or take the dog outside to relieve himself.  As a result, on several occasions Ms. Rostel \n4 and/or Ms. CLAPPER found the dog unfed and Ms. JONES’ floor smeared with dog feces. \n5 131.  Ms. Rostel and Ms. CLAPPER complained about these problems numerous times \n6 to managers at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  Although BROOKDALE management has \n7 repeatedly reassured Ms. Rostel and Ms. CLAPPER that BROOKDALE will address their \n8 concerns, they have not seen any improvement.  Since Ms. JONES has resided at BROOKDALE \n9 Fountaingrove, BROOKDALE has never disclosed that its staffing policies and procedures \n10 preclude it from providing its residents all of the care and services they have been promised and \n11 places all residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the care and \n12 services they have paid for on any given day.  Ms. JONES has not received the care \n13 BROOKDALE promised her, and for which she pays significant fees each month. \n \n14\nHelen Carlson \n15\n16 132.  HELEN CARLSON has been a resident at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove since \n17 October 2011.  When Ms. CARLSON moved into the facility, it was owned and operated by \n18 Emeritus and was known as Emeritus at Santa Rosa.  Prior to move-in, CARLSON’s daughter-in-\n19 law JOAN CARLSON, acting as Ms. CARLSON’s legal representative and power of attorney, \n20 read, reviewed, and signed a standardized residency agreement with Emeritus.  In this agreement, \n21 Emeritus promised to provide a list of “core services” that are substantially similar to the basic \n22 services enumerated in Defendants’ standardized residency agreement.  Emeritus also agreed to \n23 “perform a comprehensive Resident Evaluation prior to your admission in the Community, \n24 regularly thereafter, and as your condition warrants, in order to determine the level of Personal \n25 Care Services that you need.  We will develop your Service Plan, based on your Resident \n26 Evaluation, that describes how we will provide these services.  You will receive services \n27 appropriate to your individual needs, as described in your Service Plan.”  The agreement reserved \n28   46\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 48 of 91\n \n1 Emeritus’s right to assign the agreement to any successor-in-interest selected by Emeritus. \n2 133.  Ms. CARLSON, through her legal representative and power of attorney JOAN \n3 CARLSON, read and reasonably understood Emeritus’s representations in the residency \n4 agreement as statements that Emeritus used its resident assessment system and results generated \n5 by it to determine and provide staffing levels necessary to meet residents’ needs.  Ms. CARLSON \n6 also reasonably understood and expected that Emeritus would staff Emeritus at Santa Rosa in a \n7 manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services that Emeritus promised and \n8 Ms. CARLSON would be paying for.  Ms. CARLSON, through JOAN CARLSON, read and \n9 relied on the representations in the residency agreement in making the decision to enter Emeritus \n10 at Santa Rosa.  As Ms. CARLSON’s legal representative and power of attorney, JOAN \n11 CARLSON read and signed the agreement acknowledging that she understood and agreed to all of \n12 the terms contained in the agreement.  In or about February 2014, JOAN CARLSON received and \n13 read a letter from Emeritus informing residents about the merger between BROOKDALE and \n14 Emeritus.  The letter promised that residents would not be impacted by the change but would \n15 “receive the same excellent care and service you expect at your community” and would “continue \n16 to enjoy all the amenities of your community.”  It further stated the merger would create a “senior \n17 living company offering the most comprehensive set of senior care solutions” with a commitment \n18 to “consumer-focused cultures and a commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.” \n19 134.  JOAN CARLSON, as her mother-in-law’s power of attorney and legal \n20 representative, read the letter and reasonably understood that the care her mother-in-law received \n21 would be no worse than the care she had received under Emeritus, and possibly improve.  \n22 BROOKDALE did not inform JOAN or HELEN CARLSON nor did they have any reason to \n23 believe that BROOKDALE would not staff the facility with sufficient staff in numbers and \n24 training to provide the services for which Ms. CARLSON and the other residents were paying.   \n25 135.  In 2015, BROOKDALE merged with Emeritus, and Emeritus at Santa Rosa \n26 became BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis \n27 allege, that Emeritus assigned its residency agreements with existing residents to BROOKDALE, \n28   47\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 49 of 91\n \n1 and that BROOKDALE assumed any liability arising from those agreements. \n2 136.  On November 17, 2015, JOAN CARLSON read, reviewed, and signed an \n3 agreement with BROOKDALE as Ms. CARLSON’s legal representative and power of attorney.  \n4 This agreement, entitled “AMENDMENT TO CONTINUING CARE RESIDENCE AND \n5 SERVICES AGREEMENT,” amended the residency agreement that Ms. CARLSON signed with \n6 Emeritus and that was assigned to BROOKDALE after the merger with Emeritus.  Pursuant to this \n7 amendment, references to “core services” and “personal care services” were replaced with the \n8 terms “basic services” and “personal services,” and Emeritus’s price schedules for various services \n9 were replaced with BROOKDALE’s standardized personal services price schedule and lists of \n10 select and therapeutic services.  The parties agreed that except as otherwise amended, the terms of \n11 the prior residency agreement would remain in full force and effect. \n12 137.  BROOKDALE has also prepared and periodically updated a Personal Service Plan \n13 for Ms. CARLSON.  Ms. CARLSON’s Personal Service Plan lists the type of staff assistance that \n14 Ms. CARLSON requires and has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of \n15 staff assistance.  In addition, Ms. CARLSON has received and reviewed as enclosures to \n16 BROOKDALE’s rate increase letters a personal service price schedule and list of select and \n17 therapeutic services.  These documents describe a variety of available services, list the monthly or \n18 per-occurrence fee for each service, and detail how BROOKDALE’s caregivers or other staff will \n19 provide the service.  Every month, BROOKDALE sends Ms. CARLSON, through JOAN \n20 CARLSON, an invoice for services that the company impliedly represents it will provide in the \n21 following month.  These invoices list the monthly rate for the basic services set forth in \n22 BROOKDALE’s standardized residency agreements, the Personal Service Rate that is based on \n23 Ms. CARLSON’s Personal Service Plan, and any rate adjustments. \n24 138.  Ms. CARLSON, through her legal representative and power of attorney JOAN \n25 CARLSON, read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations—as well as \n26 Emeritus’s representations in the agreement that was assigned to BROOKDALE and expressly \n27 incorporated into BROOKDALE’s November 17, 2015 agreement with Ms. CARLSON—as \n28   48\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 50 of 91\n \n1 statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and staff \n2 BROOKDALE Fountaingrove in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services \n3 that BROOKDALE promised and that Ms. CARLSON was paying for.  Ms. CARLSON, through \n4 JOAN CARLSON, read and relied on these representations in making the decision to stay at the \n5 facility despite the change in ownership. \n6 139.  BROOKDALE currently charges Ms. CARLSON a Basic Service Rate of $4,227 \n7 per month, plus a Personal Service Rate of $3,710 per month, minus a loyalty credit.  \n8 Ms. CARLSON’s Personal Service Rate includes, among other things, a $580 monthly fee for \n9 staff assistance with ordering, storing, and taking medications; a $811 monthly fee for staff \n10 assistance with dressing and grooming; a $927 monthly fee for staff assistance with using the \n11 bathroom; a $522 monthly fee for staff assistance with accomplishing and/or participating in daily \n12 routines due to memory loss or cognitive impairment; a $290 monthly fee for help going to and \n13 from the dining room and/or community activities; and a $290 monthly fee for “additional staff \n14 involvement because of demonstrating anxious, disruptive or obsessive behavior requiring \n15 additional attention.”  Ms. CARLSON also pays $100 per month for incontinence supplies, which \n16 BROOKDALE represents its staff will order and stock. \n17 140.  Beginning in early 2016, JOAN CARLSON and her husband Ralph Carlson began \n18 to observe a decline in the quality of care provided to Ms. CARLSON.  On one occasion, JOAN \n19 discovered that despite promising to fax certain paperwork to Ms. CARLSON’s primary care \n20 physician in advance of a scheduled appointment, BROOKDALE’s staff never did so.  In addition, \n21 JOAN and Ralph CARLSON stopped receiving phone calls to notify them of Ms. CARLSON’s \n22 injuries and other noteworthy incidents. \n23 141.  In June 2016, Ms. CARLSON was admitted to the hospital after falling while \n24 attempting to get out of bed.  BROOKDALE’s staff failed to call JOAN or Ralph CARLSON, \n25 even though they are listed as Ms. CARLSON’s emergency contacts.  As a result, Ms. CARLSON \n26 spent several hours in the emergency room without a family member present, and she was charged \n27 for ambulance transport back to BROOKDALE Fountaingrove because no family member was \n28   49\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 51 of 91\n \n1 present to give her a ride. \n2 142.  In December 2016, Ms. CARLSON’s doctor took her off the blood thinner \n3 Coumadin.  Nonetheless, in January and February 2017, staff at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove \n4 continued to order and stock Coumadin for Ms. CARLSON.  BROOKDALE charged \n5 Ms. CARLSON a monthly fee for staff assistance with ordering and storing medications, even \n6 though BROOKDALE’s staff failed to adequately perform that service. \n7 143.  JOAN and Ralph CARLSON have also observed numerous failures by staff to \n8 assist Ms. CARLSON with using the bathroom, even though Ms. CARLSON pays a monthly fee \n9 for that service.  In addition, even though Ms. CARLSON pays a monthly fee for staff to order and \n10 stock incontinence products, she has often run out of such products because BROOKDALE’s staff \n11 do not check whether supplies are running low or if orders need to be adjusted. \n12 144.  Ms. CARLSON is unable to use the bathroom sink and kitchenette sink in her suite \n13 because they are installed at a height that makes them inaccessible for wheelchair users.  \n14 Ms. CARLSON requires glasses to see and dentures to eat, but BROOKDALE staff frequently \n15 misplace or lose these assistive devices. \n16 145.  JOAN and Ralph CARLSON have complained to managers at BROOKDALE \n17 Fountaingrove about these problems on numerous occasions.  Although BROOKDALE \n18 management has repeatedly reassured JOAN and Ralph CARLSON that BROOKDALE will \n19 address their concerns, they have not seen any improvement.  Since Ms. CARLSON has resided at \n20 BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, BROOKDALE has never disclosed that its staffing policies and \n21 procedures preclude it from providing its residents all of the care and services they have been \n22 promised and places all residents in an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the \n23 care and services they have paid for on any given day.  Ms. CARLSON has not received the care \n24 BROOKDALE promised her, and for which she pays significant fees each month. \n25   Bonita Hager \n26 146.  BONITA HAGER has lived at BROOKDALE San Ramon since approximately \n27 May 2013, when it was owned and operated by Merrill Gardens.  Ms. HAGER had experienced \n28   50\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 52 of 91\n \n1 several strokes and needed assistance with many of her activities of daily living.  She visited the \n2 facility with her daughter shortly before moving in.  Due to her previous strokes, Ms. HAGER had \n3 difficulty communicating at that time and relied on her ex-husband and power-of-attorney, Robert \n4 Hager, to review and sign the residency agreement with Merrill Gardens.  Prior to Ms. HAGER’s \n5 move-in, Mr. Hager, read, reviewed, and signed a standardized Residency and Services \n6 Agreement with Merrill Gardens on behalf of Ms. HAGER on April 16, 2013.  In the agreement, \n7 Merrill Gardens promised to provide Ms. HAGER with “standard services” that are substantially \n8 similar to the basic services enumerated in Defendants’ standardized residency agreement.  Merrill \n9 Gardens also agreed to provide Ms. HAGER with assisted living services for her needs as \n10 determined by a pre-admission interview and assessment.  The agreement stated that Merrill \n11 Gardens would “continue to monitor your needs and periodically reassess the services being \n12 provided. …  Assessments may result in changes in the level of care you receive, as well as the \n13 associated assisted living fee.”  The agreement also provided that any change in the amount or \n14 frequency of assisted living services would result in an immediate increase in the assisted living \n15 charges. \n16 147.  BONITA HAGER, through her power-of-attorney, Robert Hager, read and \n17 reasonably understood Merrill Gardens’ representations in the residency agreement as statements \n18 that it used resident assessments to determine its residents’ needs and provide staffing levels \n19 necessary to meet those needs.  Ms. HAGER also reasonably understood and expected that Merrill \n20 Gardens would staff the facility in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the \n21 services that Merrill Gardens had promised and that Ms. HAGER would be paying for.  \n22 Ms. HAGER also reasonably understood and expected that Merrill Gardens would regularly assess \n23 Ms. HAGER to ascertain any changes in her care needs and provide that care immediately in \n24 exchange for an immediate increase in her assisted living charges, which she understood to be \n25 necessary because of the increased staffing cost associated with providing those services to her.  \n26 Ms. HAGER, through her power-of-attorney, Robert Hager, read and signed the agreement \n27 acknowledging that she had reviewed and understood all of the terms contained in the agreement.  \n28   51\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 53 of 91\n \n1 Ms. HAGER, through her power-of-attorney, Robert Hager, read and relied on the representations \n2 in the residency agreement in making the decision to enter Merrill Gardens at San Ramon; she did \n3 so with the reasonable expectation that she would age in place and that as her needs increased, the \n4 facility would be able to provide increased services and corresponding caregiver time to meet \n5 those needs.   \n6 148.  Shortly after Ms. HAGER moved into the facility, she was presented with an \n7 amended Exhibit I, Assisted Living Fees to the Residency and Services Agreement.  The \n8 document contained amended amounts to her Rent and Assisted Living (Level of Care 4) fees.  It \n9 stated that “if after appropriate consultation and evaluation, it is determined that the Resident’s \n10 needs exceed the services provided under their designated level of care, or that the Resident \n11 requires additional services, the Resident’s level of care may increase, or other services may be \n12 added, and the charges for such increases in level of care or services will apply immediately.” Ms. \n13 HAGER read the document and reasonably understood and expected that Merrill Gardens would \n14 staff the facility in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services that Merrill \n15 Gardens had promised and for which Ms. HAGER would be paying.  Ms. HAGER also \n16 reasonably understood and expected that Merrill Gardens would regularly assess Ms. HAGER to \n17 ascertain any changes in her care needs and provide that care immediately in exchange for an \n18 immediate increase in her assisted living charges, which she understood to be necessary because \n19 of the increased staffing cost associated with providing those services to her.   \n20 149.  Merrill Gardens San Ramon was subsequently purchased by Emeritus, which then \n21 merged with BROOKDALE.  In or about April 2014, Ms. HAGER received and read a letter from \n22 Emeritus informing residents about the merger between BROOKDALE and Emeritus.  The letter \n23 promised that residents would not be impacted by the change but would “receive the same \n24 excellent care and service you expect at your community” and would “continue to enjoy all the \n25 amenities of your community.”  It further stated the merger would create a “senior living company \n26 offering the most comprehensive set of senior care solutions” with a commitment to “consumer-\n27 focused cultures and a commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.”  Ms. HAGER \n28   52\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 54 of 91\n \n1 read the letter and reasonably understood and expected that the care she received would be no \n2 worse than the care she had received under Merrill Gardens, and possibly improve.  \n3 BROOKDALE did not inform her nor did she have any reason to believe that BROOKDALE \n4 would not staff the facility with sufficient staff in numbers and training to provide the services for \n5 which she and the other residents were paying. \n6 150.  In October 2015, Defendant presented Ms. HAGER with her bi-annual resident re-\n7 assessment.  Ms. HAGER was assessed at Care Level 8 for a care charge of $2,800 per month.  \n8 The plan listed all of Ms. HAGER’s care needs and specified how Defendant would provide \n9 assistance, through staff, to meet those needs.  Ms. HAGER’s care point score from the \n10 assessment was 79.5, which she understood to be correlated to the amount of time and type of staff \n11 necessary to perform the services she required and for which she would pay BROOKDALE.  The \n12 agreement stated that the “Service Plan reflects the agreement between the community (‘we’) and \n13 Bonita Hager (‘you,’ or ‘Resident’) . . . regarding:  your identified needs and the services we will \n14 provide or arrange to meet those needs.  By signing below, the parties acknowledge that the \n15 services set forth in this document are appropriate to meet your needs.  We will periodically \n16 review your Service Plan and modify it as needed to address your changing needs.” The document \n17 was signed by Ms. HAGER and by a community representative on October 9, 2015.  Ms. HAGER \n18 read the document and reasonably understood and expected that BROOKDALE would staff the \n19 facility in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services that BROOKDALE \n20 had promised and for which Ms. HAGER would be paying.   \n21 151.  Ms. HAGER read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations—as \n22 well as Merrill Gardens’ representations in the agreement that was assigned to BROOKDALE—as \n23 statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and staff \n24 BROOKDALE San Ramon in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services \n25 that BROOKDALE promised and for which Ms. HAGER was paying.  Ms. HAGER read and \n26 relied on these representations in making the decision to stay at the facility despite the change in \n27 ownership and in agreeing to pay BROOKDALE’s monthly rates.  At no time has BROOKDALE \n28   53\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 55 of 91\n \n1 informed Ms. HAGER that its corporate policy and procedure of providing pre-determined \n2 staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing the care and services residents \n3 have been promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the care \n4 and services they have paid for on any given day.  Had BROOKDALE disclosed this material fact \n5 to Ms. HAGER, she would have begun looking for a new place to live and/or not agreed to pay the \n6 amounts charged by BROOKDALE. \n7 152.  Prior to BROOKDALE’s takeover of the facility, Ms. HAGER received better care. \n8 Ms. HAGER uses a wheelchair for mobility.  When she first entered assisted living, she was able \n9 to build strength by using with her walker in the mornings with the standby assistance of Merrill \n10 Gardens staff.  At BROOKDALE, there is not enough staff to provide that standby assistance, so \n11 Ms. HAGER cannot practice with her walker.  As a result, her mobility and strength have \n12 declined. \n13 153.  Although Ms. HAGER is a wheelchair user, BROOKDALE has not provided her \n14 with a room that has any physical access features.  The bathroom area is too small, with a general \n15 lack of clear floor space, and the toilet is too low, making it difficult for Ms. HAGER to position \n16 her wheelchair for toilet transfers.  The bathroom does not have a roll-in shower, making it \n17 inaccessible to her.  The lavatory in the bathroom does not have knee clearance underneath the \n18 sink, which prevents Ms. HAGER from rolling under it.  Ms. HAGER would be able to use her \n19 bathroom more independently if it were accessible.  Ms. HAGER’s bedroom lacks an accessible \n20 path of travel to both sides of her bed.  Ms. HAGER cannot reach most of the hanging or the \n21 storage space in her closet and therefore cannot access her clothing or other personal items without \n22 assistance from others because the clothing rod has been hung too high.  The kitchen and range are \n23 both inaccessible.  On the outside of the building, the blue parking spaces are not level and do not \n24 comply with applicable access laws.  The ramp leading to the lower part of the facility is too steep.  \n25 The complete lack of accessible features in Ms. HAGER’s room and in other parts of the facility \n26 prevents her from being as independent as possible and causes her to rely on personal assistance \n27 from BROOKDALE staff.  Compounding this problem is BROOKDALE’s understaffing, which \n28   54\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 56 of 91\n \n1 means that Ms. HAGER must wait to accomplish most of her activities of daily living, if at all.  \n2 This puts Ms. HAGER in humiliating, frustrating and hazardous situations on a daily basis. \n3 154.  Ms. HAGER currently pays an additional approximately $2,700 per month for \n4 assistance with transferring, changing her dentures, pushing her wheelchair to and from the dining \n5 room, showering, and incontinent care.  Due to very low staffing levels, Ms. HAGER often has to \n6 wait long periods of time for assistance with using the bathroom or transferring in and out of bed \n7 after she pushes her call pendant button.  There are currently approximately 80 residents at \n8 BROOKDALE San Ramon.  At night, there is typically only one caregiver on duty and one staff \n9 member to provide medications.  During the day, there are usually only two caregivers on duty for \n10 all 80 residents.  The range of wait times that Ms. HAGER experiences after pushing her call \n11 pendant button is anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour and a half.  Staff members have told \n12 Ms. HAGER that the call pendant is only to be used in emergencies, but there is no other way for \n13 her to reach a caregiver if she needs the assistance for which she pays BROOKDALE. \n14 155.  Despite paying extra for assistance with certain activities of daily living, some \n15 caregivers refuse to change Ms. HAGER’s diapers when they are only wet.  She has sometimes \n16 gone an entire day without caregivers’ changing her briefs.  As a result, Ms. HAGER has gotten \n17 urinary tract infections.  When Ms. HAGER complained to the BROOKDALE Health Services \n18 Director about being left in wet briefs after using her call pendant to alert a caregiver, the Health \n19 Director told Ms. HAGER that the call pendant should only be used for emergencies.  In the \n20 morning, Ms. HAGER needs extra time to get out of bed, but the caregivers become impatient and \n21 sometimes leave to help other residents if she is taking too long.  When caregivers take \n22 Ms. HAGER to the bathroom, they rush and frequently leave her on the toilet so they can assist \n23 other residents.  Ms. HAGER is often left waiting for 45 minutes for a caregiver to return to help \n24 her out of the bathroom.  A single caregiver is usually not strong enough to assist Ms. HAGER in \n25 getting out of her wheelchair, but one caregiver alone always responds to her call pendant, \n26 meaning she must wait even longer for a second caregiver to arrive. \n27 156.  Ms. HAGER has fallen in her bathroom, out of her bed, and in her living room.  \n28   55\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 57 of 91\n \n1 Recently, Ms. HAGER fell forward while she was with a caregiver who was trying to help her \n2 transfer from the toilet to her wheelchair.  Ms. HAGER had to wait on the ground for a second \n3 caregiver to come and help her up.  When Ms. HAGER fell out of her bed at night and used her \n4 call pendant to call for help, the caregiver who arrived refused to help her up.  Instead, the \n5 caregiver called 911 and waited for an EMT to arrive to help Ms. HAGER up off the floor.  Ms. \n6 HAGER needs assistance to steady her in the shower or in transferring out of her chair.  She has \n7 asked to hold onto a caregiver for support when getting out of the shower or her chair and has \n8 been told by caregivers that they cannot help her. \n9 157.  On Saturdays, the BROOKDALE shuttle takes residents for local shopping at \n10 Trader Joe’s, Costco or CVS, to the bank and other such locations.  Although Ms. HAGER would \n11 like to participate in such trips, BROOKDALE’s driver said that she cannot go because they \n12 cannot handle her.  Though there are currently between ten and twenty wheelchair users living at \n13 BROOKDALE San Ramon, BROOKDALE will only transport two wheelchair users at a time, on \n14 a first come, first served basis.  BROOKDALE instituted a policy, displayed in writing on a card \n15 in the lobby of BROOKDALE San Ramon, whereby staff will no longer assist wheelchair users to \n16 transfer from their wheelchair to a seat in the shuttle.  Ms. HAGER has vertigo, which makes it \n17 difficult for her to stand or to transfer without assistance.  As a result of this new policy, she has \n18 been unable to participate in off-site activities for some months now.  In addition, Ms. HAGER \n19 needs someone to push her wheelchair when she goes on these sorts of off-site trips.  \n20 BROOKDALE has refused to assist her or other wheelchair users in that regard. \n21 158.  In case of fire and other emergencies, BROOKDALE staff has told Ms. HAGER to \n22 remain in her room until they come and get her.  Recently there was a fire alarm that went off in \n23 the middle of the night.  No staff member came to Ms. HAGER’s room.  Ms. HAGER has not \n24 been given any additional instructions. \n25 159.  The food quality and selection at BROOKDALE has steadily decreased.  When the \n26 facility was run by Merrill Gardens, residents regularly received fresh fruit, vegetables and meat.  \n27 Now the food is processed or frozen, and the meat is often too tough to eat.  Ms. HAGER often \n28   56\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 58 of 91\n \n1 waits for long periods of time to be served. \n2   Lawrence Quinlan \n3 160.  LAWRENCE QUINLAN stayed at the facility at BROOKDALE Hemet for short-\n4 term respite on several occasions between 2013 and 2015.  On approximately September 13, 2015, \n5 he was admitted to BROOKDALE Hemet as a long-term resident.  Prior to his move-in, on or \n6 about September 13, 2015, LAWRENCE QUINLAN’s son, Phillip Quinlan, read, reviewed, and \n7 signed an agreement with BROOKDALE as LAWRENCE QUINLAN’s legal representative and \n8 power of attorney.  As part of this “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT,” BROOKDALE stated that \n9 “[i]n order to provide you with care, supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of \n10 daily living in order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, \n11 which are included in the Basic Service Rate.”  These included, among other things, the room, \n12 three daily meals and snacks on demand, weekly room cleaning, weekly laundry and linen service, \n13 planned activities, transportation, observation, and the availability of staff “24 hours a day, seven \n14 days a week.”  This standard residency agreement also stated that: \n15  \n[p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use a \n16 personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  The \npersonal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.  \n17 The results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your personal care needs, \nand the cost of providing the additional personal services (the “Personal Service \n18 Rate”) will be shared with you. \n19  \n20 The Personal Service Plan listed the types of staff assistance that Mr. QUINLAN required and had \n21 agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of staff assistance.   \n22 161.  Mr. QUINLAN, through his legal representatives and power of attorneys, \n23 LORESIA VALLETTE and Phillip Quinlan, read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s \n24 representations as statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed \n25 services and staff BROOKDALE Hemet in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide \n26 the services that BROOKDALE promised and for which Mr. QUINLAN was paying.  Mr. \n27 QUINLAN, through LORESIA VALLETTE and Phillip Quinlan, relied on these representations \n28   57\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 59 of 91\n \n1 in making the decision to enter BROOKDALE Hemet and to pay BROOKDALE the monthly fees \n2 it charged him.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to Mr. QUINLAN or his legal representatives at \n3 any time prior to his admission nor has it disclosed since that time that its corporate policy and \n4 procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from \n5 providing the care and services residents have been promised and places all residents at a \n6 substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given \n7 day.  If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to Mr. QUINLAN or his legal \n8 representatives, they would have looked for another facility for Mr. QUINLAN and would not \n9 have agreed to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE.  \n10 162.  Mr. QUINLAN is a wheelchair-user.  He has right hemiparesis and aphasia due to \n11 past strokes.  He has mild dementia.  During the time Mr. QUINLAN was a resident at \n12 BROOKDALE Hemet, he required assistance with the following activities of daily living:  \n13 bathing, personal hygiene, dressing, laundry, housecleaning, taking medication, preparing meals, \n14 toileting, and transfers to and from his wheelchair.  During Mr. QUINLAN’s long-term stay at \n15 BROOKDALE Hemet, he paid for but was not consistently provided that assistance. \n16 163.  Although he was paying for assistance with laundry, dressing and showering, Mr. \n17 QUINLAN’s granddaughter and son noticed that he smelled horrible and wore dirty clothing.  \n18 When Ms. VALLETTE asked BROOKDALE staff why Mr. QUINLAN smelled so bad, they \n19 blamed him for refusing to take a shower.  BROOKDALE then raised Mr. QUINLAN’s monthly \n20 personal care rate by $700, even though they were not giving him the promised showers, because \n21 he was “resistant.”  Ms. VALLETTE requested that BROOKDALE’s staff call her if Mr. \n22 QUINLAN refused to shower or change his clothing so that she could speak with her grandfather \n23 and try to convince him to cooperate with showering and changing his clothes.  BROOKDALE \n24 staff rarely called Ms. VALLETTE, but the facility continued to charge Mr. QUINLAN a \n25 premium for showers and dressing assistance they were not providing. \n26 164.  Over time, BROOKDALE continued to increase Mr. QUINLAN’s monthly care \n27 rates, blaming his resistance to care.  Ms. VALLETTE accepted the care rate increases with the \n28   58\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 60 of 91\n \n1 expectation that Mr. QUINLAN would actually receive the services for which BROOKDALE was \n2 charging him.  Despite the increased fees, BROOKDALE staff rarely provided the promised \n3 assistance with showering, dressing or toileting to Mr. QUINLAN.  Toward the end of Mr. \n4 QUINLAN’s stay at BROOKDALE Hemet, the Executive Director told Ms. VALLETTE that \n5 they would need to move Mr. QUINLAN to the memory care unit and take away his motorized \n6 scooter in order to care for him.  This would result in another increase in his monthly rate. \n7 In April 2017, frustrated by BROOKDALE’s failure to provide the assistance her grandfather \n8 needed and for which he was paying increasingly higher fees, Ms. VALLETTE told \n9 BROOKDALE that Mr. QUINLAN would be moving out.  Prior to the move-out date, Ms. \n10 VALLETTE and Phillip Quinlan took Mr. QUINLAN to a physician’s office to get a tuberculosis \n11 test.  When he transferred out of his wheelchair, they saw that the seating pad was soaked with \n12 urine and that the plastic was breaking down as a result.  It was clear that neither the seating pad \n13 nor Mr. QUINLAN had been washed for a very long time.  Although Mr. QUINLAN’s move-out \n14 date was scheduled for early May 2017, Ms. VALLETTE moved him out on April 30, 2017.  Mr. \n15 QUINLAN is a currently a resident of an unrelated assisted living facility in Riverside, California.  \n16  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n17\n18 165.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all persons \n19 similarly situated and seek class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \n20 and/or (b)(3) as set forth below. \n21 166.  Class Definitions. \n22 Plaintiffs PATRICIA EIDLER, STACIA STINER, MARY-CATHERINE JONES, \n23 HELEN CARLSON, BONITA HAGER, and LAWRENCE QUINLAN seek to represent the \n24 following two classes: \n25  \na.  RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES CLASS:  All persons with disabilities \n26 who use wheelchairs, scooters, canes or other mobility aids or who require \nassistance with mobility or activities of daily living and who reside or have \n27 resided at a residential care facility for the elderly located in California and \nowned, operated and/or managed by BROOKDALE during the CLASS \n28   59\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 61 of 91\n \nPERIOD. \n1\nb.  FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS CLASS: All persons who \n2 resided or reside at one of the California assisted living facilities owned, \noperated, and/or purchased by BROOKDALE during the CLASS PERIOD \n3 and who contracted with BROOKDALE or another assisted living facility \nfor services for which BROOKDALE was paid money. \n4  \n5\n167.  The CLASS PERIOD is defined as commencing three years prior to the filing of \n6\nthis action for the RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES CLASS and four years prior to the filing \n7\nof this suit for the FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS CLASS. \n8\n168.  Excluded from the above-referenced class are the officers, directors, and employees \n9\nof BROOKDALE, and any of Defendants’ shareholders or other persons who hold a financial \n10\ninterest in BROOKDALE.  Also excluded is any judge assigned to hear this case (or any spouse or \n11\nfamily member of any assigned judge), or any juror selected to hear this case. \n12\n169.  This action is brought as a class action and may properly be so maintained pursuant \n13\nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and applicable case law.  In addition to declaratory and \n14\ninjunctive relief, this action seeks class-wide damages pursuant to California Civil Code § 52(a) in \n15\nthe amount of $4,000 per class member based on Defendants’ wrongful policy and practice of \n16\nfailing to provide residents with disabilities with full and equal access to and enjoyment of its \n17\nservices, goods, facilities, privileges, or advantages of BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities as \n18\nalleged herein.  It also seeks class-wide statutory and punitive damages based on Defendants’ \n19\nmisrepresentations, misleading statements, and material omissions, including $5,000 per class \n20\nmember pursuant to California Civil Code § 1780(b). This action also seeks treble damages \n21\npursuant to both California Civil Code § 52(a) and California Civil Code § 3345(b)(2) and (3).  \n22\nThis action does not seek recovery for personal injuries or emotional distress that may have been \n23\ncaused by Defendants’ conduct alleged herein. \n24\n170.  Ascertainability.  Members of the proposed Class are identifiable and \n25\nascertainable.  BROOKDALE retains admission contracts, resident service plans, and billing \n26\nstatements for all persons who currently reside or resided at BROOKDALE facilities during the \n27\nCLASS PERIOD. \n28   60\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 62 of 91\n \n1 171.  Impracticability of Joinder (Numerosity of the Class).  The members of the \n2 proposed class are so numerous that joinder of all such persons is impracticable and the \n3 disposition of their claims in a class action is a benefit both to the parties and to this Court.  On \n4 information and belief, the number of persons in this case exceeds 5,000 persons.  The number of \n5 persons in the class and their identities and addresses may be ascertained from Defendants’ \n6 records. \n7 172.  Questions of Fact and Law Common to the Class.  All members of the class \n8 have been and continue to be denied their civil rights to full and equal access to, and use and \n9 enjoyment of, the services and facilities operated by the BROOKDALE because of the violations \n10 of disability nondiscrimination laws, the CLRA, and Elder Abuse laws alleged herein.  There are \n11 numerous questions of law and fact common to the class, including, but not limited to, the \n12 following: \n13 a.  Whether BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities are public \n14 accommodations within the meaning of Title III of the ADA; \n15 b.  Whether BROOKDALE and its assisted living facilities are business \n16 establishments within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act; \n17 c.  Whether BROOKDALE constructed or altered any of its assisted living \n18 facilities after January 26, 1993; \n19 d.  Whether BROOKDALE’s facilities that were newly constructed or altered \n20 between January 26, 1993 and March 15, 2012 comply with the \n21 requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility \n22 Guidelines; \n23 e.  Whether BROOKDALE constructed or altered any of its facilities after \n24 March 15, 2012; \n25 f.  Whether BROOKDALE’s facilities that were constructed or altered after \n26 March 15, 2012 comply with the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible \n27 Design; \n28   61\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 63 of 91\n \n1 g.  Whether BROOKDALE has removed physical access barriers where doing \n2 so was readily achievable as required by Title III of the ADA; \n3 h.  Whether Plaintiffs are being denied full and equal access to and enjoyment \n4 of BROOKDALE’s goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or \n5 accommodations; \n6 i.  Whether Plaintiffs requested that BROOKDALE make reasonable \n7 modifications in policies, practices and/or procedures by providing its \n8 facilities with a sufficient number of adequately trained staff to ensure that \n9 residents with disabilities receive full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n10 the services specified in BROOKDALE’s own resident assessments; \n11 j.  Whether Plaintiffs’ requested modification in policies, practices or \n12 procedures is reasonable; \n13 \\\\\\ \n14 \\\\\\ \n15 k.  Whether Plaintiffs’ requested modification in policies, practices or \n16 procedures is necessary to ensure that residents with disabilities have full \n17 and equal access to and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s goods, services, \n18 facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations as required by Title \n19 III of the ADA; \n20 l.  Whether BROOKDALE has provided Plaintiffs with full and equal access \n21 to and enjoyment of its transportation services and activities as required by \n22 Title III of the ADA; \n23 m.  Whether BROOKDALE has provided Plaintiffs with full and equal access \n24 to and enjoyment of its services and facilities with respect to emergency \n25 planning and emergency evacuation; \n26 n.  Whether BROOKDALE, by its actions and omissions alleged herein, has \n27 engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against Plaintiffs and \n28   62\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 64 of 91\n \n1 other residents with disabilities in violation of the ADA and the Unruh Civil \n2 Rights Act; \n3 o.  Whether BROOKDALE has violated and continues to violate the Consumer \n4 Legal Remedies Act, California Civil Code §§ 1750 et seq. by promising \n5 residents that it will provide care and services including as identified by \n6 resident assessments, when BROOKDALE knows that its corporate policy \n7 and procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes \n8 BROOKDALE from providing the care and services residents have been \n9 promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not \n10 receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day; \n11 p.  Whether BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements and \n12 omissions regarding the staffing of its facilities as alleged herein were and \n13 are material to the reasonable consumer; \n14 \\\\\\ \n15 q.  Whether by making the misrepresentations, misleading statements and \n16 material omissions alleged in this Complaint, BROOKDALE violated and \n17 continues to violate California Business & Professions Code §§ 17200, et. \n18 seq. (“UCL”); \n19 r.  Whether BROOKDALE had exclusive knowledge of material facts not \n20 known or reasonably accessible to the Plaintiffs and the class; \n21 s.  Whether the Plaintiffs, the class, and the consuming public were likely to be \n22 deceived by the foregoing concealment and omission; \n23 t.  Whether the Plaintiffs, the class, and the consuming public have a \n24 reasonable expectation that BROOKDALE will provide staffing at its \n25 facilities to meet the aggregate care needs of the residents at its facilities; \n26 u.  Whether BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, its misleading statements, its \n27 failures to disclose and its concealment of its true policies, procedures, and \n28   63\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 65 of 91\n \n1 practices regarding how it staffs its facilities violated the CLRA and the \n2 UCL; \n3 v.  Whether BROOKDALE has engaged and continues to engage in a pattern \n4 and practice of unfair and deceptive conduct in connection with the \n5 management, administration, and operation of its California assisted living \n6 facilities; \n7 w.  Whether BROOKDALE has violated and continues to violate the UCL by \n8 violating the CLRA, ADA, Unruh Civil Rights Act, and California Welfare \n9 and Institutions Code § 15610.30 during the CLASS PERIOD; \n10 x.  Whether BROOKDALE has committed financial elder abuse under \n11 California Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.30 by taking, secreting, \n12 appropriating, obtaining, and/or retaining money from elders and dependent \n13 adults for a wrongful use and/or with the intent to defraud them; \n14 \\\\\\ \n15 y.  Whether the Plaintiffs and the putative class members have been injured; \n16 z.  Whether the Plaintiffs and the members of the putative class are entitled to \n17 damages, and the nature of such damages; and, \n18 aa.  Whether the Plaintiffs and the members of the putative class are entitled to \n19 declaratory and/or injunctive relief, and the nature of such relief. \n20 173.  Typicality.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the proposed \n21 classes.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed classes in the following ways: \n22 1) Plaintiffs are members of the proposed classes; 2) Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same \n23 uniform corporate policies, procedures, practices and course of conduct on the part of \n24 BROOKDALE; 3) Plaintiffs’ claims are based on the same legal and remedial theories as those of \n25 the proposed classes and involve similar factual circumstances; 4) the injuries suffered by the \n26 named Plaintiffs are similar to the injuries suffered by the proposed class members; and 5) the \n27 relief sought herein will benefit the named Plaintiffs and all class members alike. \n28   64\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 66 of 91\n \n1 174.  Adequacy.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests \n2 of the classes.  They have no interests adverse to the interests of other members of the class and \n3 have retained counsel who are competent and experienced in litigating complex class actions, \n4 including large-scale disability rights and senior care class action cases. \n5 175.  Predominance.  With respect to Plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA, the Unruh Civil \n6 Rights Act, the CLRA, the UCL, and the Elder Abuse Act, class certification is appropriate under \n7 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) because questions of law or fact common to the class \n8 members predominate over any questions affecting individual members of the putative classes. \n9 176.  Superiority.  A class action is superior to other methods for the fair and efficient \n10 adjudication of this controversy because, inter alia: 1) individual claims by the class members \n11 would be impracticable because the costs of pursuit of such claims would far exceed what any \n12 individual class member has at stake; 2) relatively little individual litigation has been commenced \n13 over the controversies alleged in this Complaint and individual class members are unlikely to have \n14 an interest in separately prosecuting and controlling individual actions; 3) the concentration of \n15 litigation of these claims in one forum will achieve efficiency and promote judicial economy; 4) \n16 the proposed classes are manageable, and no difficulties are likely to be encountered in the \n17 management of this class action that would preclude its maintenance as a class action; 5) the \n18 proposed class members are readily identifiable from Defendants’ own records; and 6) prosecution \n19 of separate actions by individual members of the proposed class would create the risk of \n20 inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the proposed classes \n21 that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for BROOKDALE. \n22 177.  The Class Meets the Requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23 23(b)(2).  BROOKDALE has acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, \n24 making the declaratory and injunctive relief sought on behalf of the class as a whole appropriate. \n25 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n26 (Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.) \n27 178.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n28   65\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 67 of 91\n \n1 paragraphs of this Complaint. \n2 179.  Congress enacted the ADA upon finding, among other things, that “society has \n3 tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities” and that such forms of discrimination \n4 continue to be a “serious and pervasive social problem.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a) (2). \n5 180.  Congress explicitly stated that the purpose of the ADA is to provide “a clear and \n6 comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with \n7 disabilities” and “clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against \n8 individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b) (1)-(2). \n9 181.  Title III of the ADA provides in pertinent part: “[N]o individual shall be \n10 discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, \n11 services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public \n12 accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or leases to, or operates a place of public \n13 accommodation.”  42 U.S.C. § 12182. \n14  \n15 182.  At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiffs PATRICIA EIDLER, STACIA \n16 STINER, MARY-CATHERINE JONES, HELEN CARLSON, BONITA HAGER, and \n17 LAWRENCE QUINLAN were and remain qualified individuals with disabilities within the \n18 meaning of the ADA. \n19 183.  Defendants are each a “private entity,” as defined under 42 U.S.C. § 12181(6).  \n20 They own, operate and/or manage approximately 89 assisted living facilities in California.  These \n21 facilities are “public accommodations” pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7).  BROOKDALE is \n22 subject to Title III of the ADA and its corresponding regulations. \n23 184.  As alleged above in greater detail, BROOKDALE has violated Title III of the ADA \n24 in the following ways. \n25  \nFailure to Provide Reasonable Modifications in Staffing Policies, Practices and Procedures \n26\n27 185.  BROOKDALE has a policy and practice of staffing its assisted living facilities \n28   66\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 68 of 91\n \n1 based on pre-set corporate labor budgets and profit margins without regard for residents’ needs.  \n2 BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing its assisted living facilities in order to \n3 minimize its labor expenses and maximize its corporate profits has resulted in facilities that are \n4 chronically understaffed, and in which skeletal levels of staffing make it commonplace for \n5 residents with disabilities to go without the services, goods, facilities, privileges, advantages or \n6 accommodations for which they have paid.  For example, staff are often unavailable or unable to \n7 assist residents with disabilities with activities of daily living including, inter alia, bathing, \n8 showering, toileting, transferring, taking medications, dressing, dining, and housekeeping.  In \n9 addition, residents with disabilities are often denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n10 social and recreational activities, as well as transportation to off-site locations for appointments \n11 and other activities, because of the lack of a sufficient number of trained staff to assist residents \n12 with disabilities to participate in these activities. \n13 186.  Plaintiffs have requested that BROOKDALE make reasonable modifications in \n14 policies, practices, or procedures as required by Title III of the ADA.  Plaintiffs have requested \n15 that BROOKDALE provides its facilities with a sufficient number of adequately trained staff to \n16 ensure that residents with disabilities are provided with full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n17 the services specified in BROOKDALE’s own resident assessments.  Among other things, and \n18 without limitation, BROOKDALE should increase its level of trained staff in its assisted living \n19 facilities such that residents with disabilities are not required to wait for more than five minutes \n20 for a substantive response to their call pendants.  A substantive response means actual action taken \n21 to address the resident’s need, rather than a staff member passing by the resident’s room to say \n22 that they will return later. \n23 187.  Such reasonable modifications in BROOKDALE’s policies, practices and \n24 procedures are necessary to ensure that residents with disabilities receive full and equal access to \n25 and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s services, including assistance with, inter alia, bathing, \n26 showering, toileting, transferring, taking medications, dressing, dining, and housekeeping.  In \n27 addition, such modifications are necessary to ensure that residents with disabilities have full and \n28   67\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 69 of 91\n \n1 equal access to and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s social and recreational activities, and \n2 transportation to off-site locations for appointments and other activities.  Unless and until \n3 BROOKDALE makes this requested reasonable modification in policies, practices, or procedures, \n4 residents with disabilities will continue to be denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of the \n5 services, goods, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations that BROOKDALE claims \n6 to provide to all of its residents, whether disabled or nondisabled. \n7 188.  Plaintiffs’ requested modification in policies, practices or procedures is eminently \n8 reasonable in that BROOKDALE already charges residents with disabilities for, and residents with \n9 disabilities pay to receive, the services specified in BROOKDALE’s own resident agreements and \n10 resident assessments, including inter alia, assistance with activities of daily living such as \n11 mobility, bathing, showering, toileting, transferring, taking medications, dressing, dining, and \n12 housekeeping, as well as participating in BROOKDALE’s social and recreational activities \n13 whether on-site or off-site. \n14 189.  The requested modification in policies, practices or procedures will not make any \n15 alteration (much less a fundamental alteration) in the nature of BROOKDALE’s goods and \n16 services.  Rather, Plaintiffs merely seek to ensure that BROOKDALE provides a sufficient \n17 number of adequately trained staff to provide its residents with mobility disabilities with full and \n18 equal access to and enjoyment of the types of services and goods that BROOKDALE already \n19 promises to provide to its residents in its normal course of business.  Thus, the requested \n20 reasonable modification in policy, practice or procedure would not change the nature or type of \n21 services and goods that BROOKDALE sells to the public. \n22 190.  The requested reasonable modification would impose only a minimal burden on \n23 BROOKDALE.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that the staff who provide \n24 BROOKDALE’s services are hourly employees who are paid an average of $10 to $14 per hour.  \n25 Increasing BROOKDALE’s skeletal night staffing and its minimal level of daytime staffing will \n26 only result in a moderate increase in BROOKDALE’s labor budget.  BROOKDALE will continue \n27 to be able to realize substantial gross profits each year in the multibillion dollar range. \n28   68\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 70 of 91\n \n1 191.  Plaintiffs have repeatedly requested that BROOKDALE make reasonable \n2 modifications in policies, practices, or procedures by increasing the number of trained staff that it \n3 provides in its facilities.  Notwithstanding the reasonableness and necessity of such modifications, \n4 and notwithstanding the fact that BROOKDALE could significantly increase its staffing without \n5 changing the nature of its services, goods, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations, \n6 and could make such modifications without undue financial or administrative burdens, \n7 BROOKDALE has failed and refused to make any such modifications. \n8 Physical Access Barriers \n9 192.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that many of Defendants’ facilities were \n10 designed and constructed after January 26, 1993, thus triggering access requirements under Title \n11 III of the ADA.  The ADA prohibits designing and constructing facilities for first occupancy after \n12 January 26, 1993 that are not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities when \n13 it was structurally practicable to do so.  42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1).  BROOKDALE has violated the \n14 ADA by designing and constructing their facilities in a manner that does not comply with federal \n15 disability access design standards including the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility \n16 Guidelines (“ADAAG”) even though it was structurally practicable to do so. \n17 193.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that Defendants’ facilities were altered \n18 after January 26, 1993, thus triggering access requirements under Title III of the ADA.  The ADA \n19 prohibits altering facilities after January 26, 1993 in a manner that is not readily accessible to, and \n20 usable by, individuals with disabilities when it was structurally practicable to do so.  42 U.S.C. \n21 § 12183(a)(2).  Here, Defendants violated the ADA by altering its assisted living facilities after \n22 January 26, 1993 in a manner that did not comply with the ADAAG even though it was \n23 structurally practicable to do so.  Specifically, Defendants have failed to ensure that the areas of \n24 alteration complied with the ADAAG, and that the path of travel to the areas of alteration \n25 complied with the ADAAG. \n26 194.  The removal of each of the barriers complained of by Plaintiffs herein was at all \n27 times “readily achievable” under the standards of §§ 12181 and 12182 of the ADA.  \n28   69\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 71 of 91\n \n1 BROOKDALE could have removed each of the barriers alleged herein without much difficulty or \n2 expense within the meaning of Title III.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, BROOKDALE failed and \n3 refused to do so. \n4 Transportation and Activities \n5 195.  BROOKDALE has violated Title III of the ADA by failing and refusing to provide \n6 Plaintiffs with full and equal access to and enjoyment of its transportation services to off-site \n7 activities and appointments.  BROOKDALE has a policy and practice of limiting the number of \n8 wheelchair users who may use transportation to off-site activities.  This limitation is not imposed \n9 on residents who do not use wheelchairs.  In addition, BROOKDALE has required residents with \n10 mobility disabilities to transfer from their wheelchairs into the seats in its shuttles, and has not \n11 permitted residents to remain in their wheelchairs.  BROOKDALE has done so despite the fact \n12 that many residents with mobility disabilities have great difficulty in transferring from their \n13 wheelchairs into the passenger seats in shuttles, and doing so is time consuming, physically \n14 exhausting and sometimes dangerous.  Further, on numerous occasions residents with mobility \n15 disabilities have been completely denied access to medical appointments, and other off-site \n16 appointments and activities, because BROOKDALE has failed to provide any accessible \n17 transportation to those appointments and activities \n18 Evacuation Procedures \n19 196.  BROOKDALE has failed to provide or communicate to its residents with \n20 disabilities any specific or definitive emergency evacuation plan in the event of earthquake, fire or \n21 other emergency.  Defendants’ failure to do so constitutes a denial of full and equal access to and \n22 enjoyment of the services and facilities provided by BROOKDALE in violation of Title III of the \n23 ADA.  Many of BROOKDALE’s residents with disabilities are unable to exit the building without \n24 assistance from staff.  While some residents have been advised to remain in their rooms in the \n25 event of an emergency, in those instances in which an alarm has sounded, no one has come to their \n26 rooms to assist them or to inform them as to whether there is an emergency or just a drill. \n27 197.  The acts and omissions alleged herein constitute violations of Title III of the \n28   70\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 72 of 91\n \n1 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181 et seq., and the regulations \n2 promulgated thereunder.  Defendants’ discriminatory conduct alleged herein includes, inter alia: \n3 a.  Failing to provide residents with disabilities the opportunity to participate in \n4 or benefit from BROOKDALE’s goods, services, facilities, privileges, \n5 advantages, and/or accommodations at its assisted living facilities in \n6 California, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(i); \n7 b.  Failing to provide residents with disabilities the opportunity to participate in \n8 or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and \n9 accommodations that are equal to that afforded to individuals without \n10 disabilities, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii); \n11 c.  Failing to provide the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \n12 accommodations at its assisted living facilities in California to residents \n13 with disabilities in the most integrated setting possible, in violation of 42 \n14 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(B); \n15 d.  Utilizing standards, criteria and methods of administration that have the \n16 effect of discriminating against residents on the basis of their disabilities, in \n17 violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(D); \n18 e.  Imposing eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out residents \n19 with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying BROOKDALE’s assisted \n20 living facilities’ goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or \n21 accommodations, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i); \n22 f.  Failing to make reasonable modifications in its policies, practices, and \n23 procedures which are necessary for its residents with disabilities to enjoy \n24 and access BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities’ goods, services, \n25 facilities, privileges, advantages and/or accommodations, in violation of in \n26 violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); \n27 \\\\\\ \n28   71\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 73 of 91\n \n1 g.  Failing to remove architectural barriers in those facilities constructed prior \n2 to January 26, 1993 and not altered after that date where such removal is \n3 readily achievable, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv); \n4 h.  Failing to design and construct facilities first occupied after January 26, \n5 1993 such that they are readily accessible and usable by persons with \n6 disabilities, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1); \n7 i.  Performing alterations after January 26, 1993 that affect the usability of its \n8 facilities or a part of its facilities, while failing to ensure that the altered \n9 portions and the path of travel to those altered portions are readily \n10 accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, in violation of 42 \n11 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(2); and \n12 j.

As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiffs have \n17 suffered, and continue to suffer irreparable harm including humiliation, hardship and anxiety due \n18 to Defendants’ failure to provide full and equal access to and enjoyment of Defendants’ facilities, \n19 services, goods, privileges, advantages and accommodations. \n20 199.  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n21 declaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred \n22 in bringing this action. \n23 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n24 (Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq.) \n25 200.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n26 paragraphs of this Complaint. \n27 201.  California Civil Code § 51(b) provides in pertinent part that “All persons within the \n28   72\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 74 of 91\n \n1 jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their…disability or medical \n2 condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or \n3 services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.” \n4 202.  Pursuant to California Civil Code § 51(f), a violation of the ADA also constitutes a \n5 violation of California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq. \n6 203.  Defendants own, operate and/or manage business establishments within the \n7 meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.  Defendants are each a public accommodation whose \n8 services and facilities are open to the general public. \n9 \\\\\\ \n10 \\\\\\ \n11 \\\\\\ \n12 204.  Defendants provide services, privileges, advantages and accommodations to the \n13 general public.  Defendants have failed and refused to provide Plaintiffs with full and equal access \n14 to and enjoyment of the benefits of their goods, services, facilities, benefits, advantages, and \n15 accommodations, and have done so by reason of Plaintiffs’ disabilities. \n16 205.  Defendants have discriminated against persons with disabilities in violation of \n17 California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq. by failing to operate their facilities and services in full \n18 compliance with the requirements of the ADA as set forth above. \n19 206.  Defendants, by their actions and inactions alleged in this Complaint, have directly \n20 discriminated against persons with disabilities. \n21 207.  The actions of Defendants were and are in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, \n22 Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51 et seq. and therefore Plaintiffs are also entitled to injunctive relief and \n23 reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. \n24 THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n25 (Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750 et seq.) \n26 208.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n27 paragraphs of this Complaint. \n28   73\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 75 of 91\n \n1 209.  Plaintiffs and the members of the putative class are “consumer[s]” within the \n2 meaning of California Civil Code § 1761(d).  They are also “senior citizen[s]” and/or “[d]isabled \n3 person[s]” within the meaning of California Civil Code § 1761(f) and (g). \n4 210.  Defendants are each a “person” as defined under California Civil Code § 1761(c).  \n5 The assisted living services that Defendants have promised to provide Plaintiffs are “[s]ervices” \n6 within the meaning of the California Civil Code § 1761(b).  The agreement by Defendants to \n7 provide assisted living services in return for payment of monthly fees by each of the Plaintiffs \n8 constitutes a “transaction” under California Civil Code § 1761(e). \n9 211.  In Defendants’ uniform resident contracts presented to prospective residents and \n10 their family members, Defendants represented and continue to represent that BROOKDALE will \n11 assess each resident and provide the basic services, personal services, and select and therapeutic \n12 services it has determined are needed.  That same representation is made in BROOKDALE’s re-\n13 evaluation of residents, rate increase letters, letters regarding the merger, letters regarding the \n14 conversion to a new personal assessment system, corporate website statements, invoices, and other \n15 standardized corporate promotional materials.  These uniform corporate representations are false \n16 and misleading, and likely to deceive the reasonable consumer.  As alleged herein, Plaintiffs and \n17 the putative class members reasonably expected based on these representations that \n18 BROOKDALE would provide sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained staff at its \n19 facilities to ensure that all residents receive the services they have been promised and for which \n20 they are paying. \n21 212.  Contrary to its representations regarding the provision of basic services, personal \n22 services, and select and therapeutic services, BROOKDALE knows that the policies and practices \n23 it uses to staff its facilities—most notably, its policy and practice of using predetermined labor \n24 budgets designed to meet corporate profit targets, goals, and margins without regard to residents’ \n25 needs—preclude it from providing its residents all of the care and services they have been \n26 promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and \n27 services they have paid for on any given day.  BROOKDALE did not intend to provide and has no \n28   74\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 76 of 91\n \n1 intention of providing sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained staff at its facilities to \n2 ensure that all residents receive these services.  BROOKDALE does not disclose and conceals this \n3 material fact from the residents, their family members, and the general public. \n4 213.  The named Plaintiffs, their family members and powers of attorney, the putative \n5 class members, and reasonable consumers considered material BROOKDALE’s \n6 misrepresentations and misleading statements that it will provide residents the basic services, \n7 personal services, and select and therapeutic services they need and for which they are paying.  If \n8 the named Plaintiffs had known the true facts about BROOKDALE’s staffing policies and \n9 procedures, they would not have agreed to enter or stay in a BROOKDALE facility or to place \n10 their relatives in a BROOKDALE facility, or would have paid less money.  If the putative class \n11 members had known the true facts, they would in all reasonable probability not have agreed to \n12 enter or remain in a BROOKDALE facility or to place their relatives in a BROOKDALE facility, \n13 or would have paid less money to BROOKDALE. \n14 214.  The facts that BROOKDALE misrepresents, fails to disclose and actively conceals \n15 are material and are likely to deceive the reasonable consumer.  Reasonable consumers, including \n16 the residents and their family members herein, consider of great importance the staffing levels \n17 provided by the assisted living facility they select, and such consumers also attach great \n18 importance to BROOKDALE’s claims regarding its provision of basic services, personal services, \n19 and select and therapeutic services. \n20 215.  Residents and their family members would consider material BROOKDALE’s \n21 uniform corporate policy and procedure of basing its staffing on fixed budgets and profit margins \n22 pursuant to staffing policies and procedures that are inadequate to meet residents’ needs, as \n23 identified by BROOKDALE itself through periodic personal service assessments.  Residents and \n24 their family members could not reasonably have been expected to learn or discover these non-\n25 disclosed facts, and in fact, BROOKDALE has affirmatively concealed them. \n26 216.  BROOKDALE has violated and continues to violate the Consumer Legal Remedies \n27 Act, California Civil Code §§ 1750 et seq. (“CLRA”) in at least the following respects: \n28   75\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 77 of 91\n \n1 a.  In violation of § 1770(a)(5), BROOKDALE has misrepresented, failed to \n2 disclose and concealed the true characteristics and/or quantities of services \n3 provided at its facilities in California; \n4 b.  In violation of § 1770(a)(7), BROOKDALE has misrepresented, failed to \n5 disclose and concealed the true standard, quality and/or grade of services \n6 provided at its facilities in California; \n7 c.  In violation of § 1770(a)(9), in BROOKDALE’s standard resident \n8 admission contracts and elsewhere, BROOKDALE has falsely advertised \n9 that it will provide the assistance specified by each resident’s personal \n10 service assessment and which corresponds to that resident’s Personal \n11 Service Plan, knowing that BROOKDALE does not intend to provide the \n12 services as advertised; and \n13 d.  In violation of § 1770(a)(14), BROOKDALE has represented that the \n14 agreement signed by residents and/or their representatives, and under which \n15 they pay their monthly rate, confers on residents the right to reside in a \n16 facility that provides the basic services, personal services, and select and \n17 therapeutic services that residents have been promised and are paying for, \n18 when in fact, BROOKDALE knows that the policies and practices it uses to \n19 staff its facilities preclude it from providing its residents all of the care and \n20 services they have been promised and places all residents in an inherent and \n21 substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have \n22 paid for on any given day. \n23 217.  These misrepresentations, misleading statements, acts, practices, and omissions by \n24 BROOKDALE are and were intended to induce and lure elderly and dependent adult residents and \n25 their family members into agreeing to be admitted to BROOKDALE’s facilities and to pay \n26 community and monthly fees. \n27 218.  BROOKDALE made the misrepresentations and misleading statements alleged \n28   76\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 78 of 91\n \n1 herein through various uniform means of communication, including without limitation, the \n2 admission agreement; subsequent agreements based on updated Personal Service Plans; letters to \n3 residents regarding the merger between BROOKDALE and Emeritus, the implementation of \n4 BROOKDALE’s new personal service system, and rate increases; standardized corporate \n5 marketing and promotional materials; Defendants’ website; scripted sales presentations; invoices; \n6 and other written corporate materials disseminated to the public in connection with Defendants’ \n7 services.  These representations and misleading statements were made directly to the named \n8 Plaintiffs, putative class members and their family members and/or representatives by \n9 BROOKDALE in the uniform means of communication listed above. \n10 219.  BROOKDALE failed to disclose and concealed from Plaintiffs, the putative class \n11 members, and their family members, that BROOKDALE uses predetermined labor budgets \n12 designed to meet corporate profit targets, goals, and margins without regard to residents’ needs, \n13 and; that these policies and practices preclude it from providing its residents all of the care and \n14 services they have been promised and places all residents in an inherent and substantial risk that \n15 they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day; and that \n16 BROOKDALE did not intend to provide and has no intention of providing sufficient qualified and \n17 adequately trained staff at its facilities to ensure that all residents receive these services. \n18 220.  BROOKDALE has exclusive and superior knowledge of materials facts not known \n19 to the named Plaintiffs, class members or the general public at the time of the subject transactions \n20 and actively concealed those material facts. \n21 221.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge that its corporate policy and \n22 procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities preclude BROOKDALE from \n23 providing the care and services for which it charges its residents and places all residents at a \n24 substantial risk that on any given day they will not receive the care and services for which they \n25 have paid.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge that its policies and procedures \n26 for staffing its facilities pose a heightened health and safety risk to the named Plaintiffs and class \n27 members.  Defendants intentionally concealed, suppressed and/or failed to disclose the true facts \n28   77\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 79 of 91\n \n1 with the intent to defraud the named Plaintiffs and putative class members.  The named Plaintiffs \n2 and putative class members did not know these material undisclosed facts and could not \n3 reasonably have been expected to discover them. \n4 222.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs, the class \n5 members, and members of the general public (including without limitation persons admitted to \n6 and/or residing in the facilities, and their family members and/or representatives) have been \n7 harmed and continue to be harmed.  Among other things, they paid money to Defendants to enter \n8 the facilities and/or for services that were not provided or that were substandard to those promised \n9 by Defendants. \n10 223.  Plaintiffs sent BROOKDALE a notice to cure under California Civil Code \n11 § 1782(a), which was received by BROOKDALE on June 6, 2017.  More than 30 days have \n12 passed since BROOKDALE’s receipt, and BROOKDALE has not corrected or remedied the \n13 violations alleged in the notice and herein.   \n14 224.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs and the class members are entitled to no less than $1,000 in \n15 statutory damages pursuant to California Civil Code § 1780(a).  Moreover, as senior citizens \n16 and/or disabled persons, Plaintiffs and the class members are also entitled to statutory damages of \n17 $5,000 per class member pursuant to California Civil Code § 1780(b), as well as actual damages \n18 and restitution in an amount to be proven at trial.   \n19 225.  Plaintiffs and each of the putative class members are seniors and/or disabled \n20 persons as defined by California Civil Code § 1761(f) and (g).  Plaintiffs and the putative class \n21 members have each suffered substantial economic harm.  Defendants knew that their conduct \n22 negatively impacted seniors and disabled persons.  Defendants’ conduct caused the named \n23 Plaintiffs and the putative class members to lose property set aside for personal care and \n24 maintenance and assets essential to their health and welfare.  Further, Plaintiffs and the putative \n25 class members are substantially more vulnerable than other members of the public to Defendants’ \n26 conduct because of their age, poor health, impaired understanding, restricted mobility and/or \n27 disabilities. \n28   78\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 80 of 91\n \n1 226.  Plaintiffs additionally seek treble damages under California Civil Code § 3345, \n2 punitive damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, and all other relief the Court deems just \n3 and proper.  Excluded from Plaintiffs’ request are damages related to any personal injuries, \n4 emotional distress or wrongful death suffered by any member of the class. \n5 227.  Defendants’ conduct presents a continuing threat of substantial harm to the public \n6 in that, among other things, Defendants continue to make misleading statements about and conceal \n7 material facts about whether and how they provide basic, personal care, select and therapeutic \n8 services at BROOKDALE facilities in California, as well as the fact that their staffing policies and \n9 procedures preclude them from providing residents the services they have been promised.  Despite \n10 these misrepresentations, BROOKDALE continues to induce elderly and vulnerable citizens to \n11 enter and remain in its facilities, which conduct irreparably harms Plaintiffs and the putative class.  \n12 Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek an injunction that requires that BROOKDALE immediately cease the \n13 CLRA violations alleged herein regarding BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading \n14 statements, and material omissions, and to enjoin it from continuing to engage in any such acts or \n15 practices in the future.  Specifically, Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring BROOKDALE to \n16 disclose to Plaintiffs, the putative class members and the consuming public that BROOKDALE’s \n17 staffing policies and procedures preclude it from providing its residents the care and services they \n18 have been promised and places all residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they will not \n19 receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day.  Plaintiffs also seek an \n20 injunction prohibiting BROOKDALE from charging residents or their responsible parties monthly \n21 fees based on their Personal Service Plans until BROOKDALE implements staffing policies and \n22 procedures that enable it to deliver those services on a consistent basis. \n23 228.  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n24 declaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred \n25 in bringing this action. \n26 \\\\\\ \n27 \\\\\\ \n28   79\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 81 of 91\n \n1 FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2 (Elder Financial Abuse, Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30) \n3 229.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n4 paragraphs of this Complaint. \n5 230.  Plaintiffs and the putative class members are and at all times were “elders” as \n6 defined under California Welfare & Institutions Code § 15610.27 and/or “dependent adults” as \n7 defined under California Welfare & Institutions Code § 15610.23. \n8 \\\\\\ \n9 231.  BROOKDALE represented to the named Plaintiffs, and/or their personal \n10 representatives, and the putative class members, and/or their personal representatives, in standard \n11 agreements, service updates, monthly invoices, and/or annual notification of rate increases that \n12 BROOKDALE would provide care and assistance with activities of daily living, including but not \n13 limited to staffing 24 hours a day, dining services, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, and \n14 other basic services in exchange for community fees and monthly payments that it received from \n15 the named Plaintiffs and the putative class members.  However, BROOKDALE did not and has no \n16 intention of providing sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained staff at its facilities to \n17 ensure that all residents receive these services.  As a result, residents do not consistently receive all \n18 of the basic services BROOKDALE has promised them and for which they are paying \n19 BROOKDALE. \n20 232.  BROOKDALE further represented through these same corporate materials that \n21 BROOKDALE would provide personal services, including but not limited to assistance with \n22 bathing, toileting, grooming, dressing, transferring, and mobility, for additional monthly fees.  \n23 BROOKDALE represented that it will perform an assessment of each resident to identify needed \n24 personal services and an individualized service plan to deliver those services.  Yet BROOKDALE \n25 did not intend to and does not provide adequate staffing for personal services at its facilities.  \n26 Rather, it has a policy and practice of providing pre-determined facility staffing that does not \n27 change with increases in resident personal service needs.  This policy and practice precludes \n28   80\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 82 of 91\n \n1 BROOKDALE from providing facility residents with all of the personal service BROOKDALE \n2 has promised them and for which they are paying BROOKDALE. \n3 233.  BROOKDALE further represented through these same corporate materials that \n4 BROOKDALE would provide select and therapeutic services to residents, including but not \n5 limited to emergency call pendants and associated service.  However, BROOKDALE did not and \n6 has no intention of providing sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained staff at its \n7 facilities to ensure that all residents receive these services.  As a result, facility residents do not \n8 consistently receive all of the select and therapeutic services BROOKDALE has promised them \n9 and for which they are paying BROOKDALE. \n10 234.  BROOKDALE knew or should have known that such conduct would likely be \n11 harmful to Plaintiffs and the putative class members. \n12 235.  BROOKDALE knew or should have known that Plaintiffs and the putative class \n13 members had a right to the funds used to pay new resident community fees and monthly fees to \n14 BROOKDALE. \n15 236.  As such, BROOKDALE took, secreted, appropriated, obtained and/or retained \n16 money belonging to Plaintiffs and putative class members for a wrongful use and/or with the \n17 intent to defraud. \n18 237.  BROOKDALE’s conduct was despicable, fraudulent, reckless, and carried out with \n19 a willful and conscious disregard for the rights and safety of Plaintiffs and the members of the \n20 putative class. \n21 238.  Plaintiffs and putative class members also seek compensatory damages, reasonable \n22 attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses, punitive damages, treble damages pursuant to California Civil \n23 Code § 3345, and all other remedies permitted by law.  Plaintiffs do not seek certification of any \n24 claims for damages related to any personal injuries, emotional distress, or wrongful death suffered \n25 by any member of the class. \n26 239.  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n27 declaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred \n28   81\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 83 of 91\n \n1 in bringing this action. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  \n(Unlawful, Unfair and Fraudulent Business Practices, \n3 Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq.) \n \n4\n5 240.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n6 paragraphs of this Complaint. \n7 241.  BROOKDALE has engaged in unlawful business acts and practices.  Such acts and \n8 practices constitute unfair business practices in violation of California Business and Professions \n9 Code §§ 17200 et seq. \n10 242.  In particular, Defendants have engaged in unlawful business acts and practices by \n11 violating numerous laws, statutes and regulations including but not limited to: \n12 a.  Systematically and uniformly representing to the residents of its assisted \n13 living facilities in California, family members, and the public that \n14 Defendants will assess residents to determine their needs, and will provide \n15 residents specified basic services, personal services, and select and \n16 therapeutic services based on those needs, when in fact, Defendants use \n17 staffing policies and procedures that preclude them from providing their \n18 residents all of the care and services they have been promised and that \n19 places all residents in an inherent and substantial risk that they will not \n20 receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day, in \n21 violation of California Business & Professions Code §§ 17500 et seq. and \n22 California Civil Code §§ 1750 et seq.; and \n23 b.  Taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, and retaining the funds of elders \n24 and dependent adults for a wrongful use and/or with the intent to defraud in \n25 violation of California Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.30. \n26 243.  By virtue of the conduct alleged herein, Defendants have also engaged in \n27 fraudulent business practices.  Members of the general public (including without limitation \n28   82\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 84 of 91\n \n1 persons admitted to and/or residing in BROOKDALE’s California assisted living facilities during \n2 the CLASS PERIOD, and their family members and/or representatives) have been and are likely \n3 to be deceived by Defendants’ misrepresentations and failures to disclose as alleged herein. \n4 244.  The acts and practices of Defendants also constitute unfair business acts and \n5 practices within the meaning of California Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq., in that \n6 the conduct alleged herein is immoral, unscrupulous, and contrary to public policy, and the \n7 detriment and gravity of that conduct outweighs any benefits attributable to such conduct. \n8 245.  Defendants’ misrepresentations, misleading statements, acts, practices, and \n9 omissions were intended to induce and lure elderly and dependent adult residents and their family \n10 members into agreeing to be admitted to and remain at Defendants’ facilities and to pay a \n11 community fee and monthly rates to live in an assisted living facility that features sufficient levels \n12 of qualified and adequately trained staff to ensure that all residents receive the basic services, \n13 personal services, and select and therapeutic services for which they are paying. \n14 246.  Defendants made these misrepresentations and misleading statements through \n15 various uniform means of written corporate communications, including without limitation, the \n16 standardized Residency Agreement; subsequent agreements based on re-assessments of the \n17 resident; letters to residents regarding the merger between BROOKDALE and Emeritus, \n18 Defendants’ conversion to a new personal service system, and rate increases; invoices, marketing \n19 and promotional materials, Defendants’ corporate website and other materials disseminated to the \n20 public from its corporate headquarters in connection with Defendants’ services.  These \n21 representations were made directly to the named Plaintiffs, class members, and their family \n22 members and/or representatives by Defendants in the uniform means of communication listed \n23 above. \n24 247.  BROOKDALE concealed from Plaintiffs, the putative class members, and their \n25 family members that BROOKDALE’s staffing policies and procedures preclude it from providing \n26 its residents all of the care and services they have been promised and places all residents at an \n27 inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on \n28   83\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 85 of 91\n \n1 any given day. \n2 248.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge of material facts not known \n3 to named Plaintiffs, putative class members or the general public at the time of the subject \n4 transactions and actively concealed these material facts. \n5 249.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge of its corporate policy and \n6 procedure.  Further, Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that Defendants’ officers, directors, \n7 and managers knew that Defendants’ failure to provide adequate staffing posed a substantial \n8 health and safety risk to the named Plaintiffs and class members.  BROOKDALE intentionally \n9 concealed, suppressed and/or failed to disclose the true facts with the intent to defraud the named \n10 Plaintiffs and putative class members.  The named Plaintiffs and the putative class members did \n11 not know these material undisclosed facts and could not reasonably have been expected to \n12 discover them. \n13 250.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs, the class \n14 members, and members of the general public (including without limitation persons admitted to \n15 and/or residing in the facilities, and their family members and/or representatives) have been \n16 harmed and continue to be harmed.  Among other things, they paid money to Defendants to enter \n17 the facilities and for services that were not provided or that were substandard to those promised by \n18 Defendants. \n19 251.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction that requires that Defendants immediately cease acts of \n20 unlawful, unfair and fraudulent business acts or practices as alleged herein, and to enjoin \n21 Defendants from continuing to engage in any such acts or practices in the future. \n22 252.  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n23 declaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred \n24 in bringing this action. \n25 ALLEGATIONS SUPPORTING DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n26 253.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the preceding \n27 paragraphs of this Complaint. \n28   84\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 86 of 91\n \n1 254.  Plaintiffs PATRICIA EIDLER, STACIA STINER, MARY-CATHERINE JONES, \n2 HELEN CARLSON, and BONITA HAGER continue to live at a BROOKDALE assisted living \n3 facility.  Unless and until BROOKDALE brings its facilities into compliance with the \n4 requirements of the ADA and applicable federal disability access design standards, the above-\n5 named Plaintiffs will continue to be denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n6 BROOKDALE’s facilities as a result of physical access barriers in violation of the ADA.  \n7 Moreover, unless and until Defendant BROOKDALE makes the requested reasonable \n8 modification in policies, practices and procedures set forth above with respect to the staffing of its \n9 facilities, Plaintiffs will continue to be denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of the \n10 services, goods, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations provided to its residents by \n11 BROOKDALE.  In this regard, unless and until Defendants provide a sufficient number of \n12 adequately trained staff at its facilities, residents will continue to suffer the denial and deprivation \n13 of basic services that are necessary to daily living, including assistance with bathing, showering, \n14 toileting, taking medications, transferring, dressing, dining, as well as cleaning and laundry \n15 services.  Further, residents with disabilities will continue to be denied full and equal access to on-\n16 site and off-site social and recreational activities, and will be segregated and isolated in violation \n17 of the ADA’s integration mandate. \n18 255.  In addition, unless and until Defendants comply with the ADA, Plaintiffs \n19 PATRICIA EIDLER, STACIA STINER, MARY-CATHERINE JONES, HELEN CARLSON, \n20 and BONITA HAGER will continue to suffer falls, and to be at risk of falls and/or serious \n21 physical injuries, as a result of Defendants’ failure and refusal to provide full and equal access to \n22 its facilities and services.  In this regard, Defendants must be enjoined to provide facilities that \n23 comply with applicable federal disability access standards, a sufficient number of staff who are \n24 adequately trained to assist residents with disabilities to prevent falls and to assist them if a fall \n25 takes place, and a functioning and effective pendant system so that residents can obtain prompt \n26 and effective assistance when they have fallen and/or are at risk of other physical injuries.  \n27 Further, unless and until Defendants provide adequate emergency planning and evacuation \n28   85\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 87 of 91\n \n1 procedures for residents with disabilities, Defendants will continue to place them at significant \n2 risk of serious injury and death. \n3 256.  Further, unless and until Defendants provide residents with full and equal access to \n4 enjoyment of its transportation services, residents with disabilities will continue to be excluded \n5 from and denied access to off-site appointments and activities in violation of the ADA. \n6 257.  Finally, unless and until BROOKDALE ceases its false and/or misleading \n7 statements regarding its services and discloses that its corporate staffing policies and practices \n8 preclude it from providing its residents the care and services they have been promised and places \n9 all residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they \n10 have paid for on any given day, residents, their family members, their representatives and the \n11 general public will continue to be misled and will continue to expend very substantial sums of \n12 money for services, goods and facilities that are not as represented, and Defendants will continue \n13 to receive the benefits of their ill-gotten gains. \n14 258.  A present and actual controversy exists regarding the respective rights and \n15 obligations of Plaintiffs and Defendants.  Plaintiffs desire a judicial determination of their rights \n16 and Defendants’ obligations in a declaration as to whether, and to what extent, the Defendants’ \n17 conduct violates applicable law. \n18 259.  Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that Plaintiffs \n19 may ascertain their rights.  Such a declaration is also necessary and appropriate to prevent further \n20 harm or infringement of Plaintiffs’ rights. \n21 260.  Plaintiffs PATRICIA EIDLER, STACIA STINER, MARY-CATHERINE JONES, \n22 HELEN CARLSON, and BONITA HAGER have no adequate remedy at law for the harm to them \n23 arising from the conduct alleged herein.  Unless and until Defendants are preliminarily and \n24 permanently enjoined from engaging in such conduct, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable \n25 harm as a result of Defendants’ violations of the ADA and the Unruh Act as alleged herein. \n26 261.  Plaintiffs PATRICIA EIDLER, STACIA STINER, MARY-CATHERINE JONES, \n27 HELEN CARLSON, and BONITA HAGER are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief \n28   86\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 88 of 91\n \n1 pursuant to each of the laws under which this action is brought. \n2 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n3 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court: \n4 1.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ failure to provide full and equal \n5 access to and enjoyment of Defendants’ goods, services, facilities, benefits, advantages and \n6 accommodations with nondisabled persons violates Plaintiffs’ rights the ADA, § 42 U.S.C. 12101 \n7 et seq., and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and also violates their civil rights under \n8 California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq.; \n9 2.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctions requiring Defendants to come into full \n10 compliance with the requirements of the ADA and its implementing regulations; \n11 3.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctions enjoining Defendants from violating \n12 the Unruh Civil Rights Act in the operation of Defendants’ business establishments and/or public \n13 accommodations with respect to its goods, services, facilities, advantages, benefits and \n14 accommodations at its assisted living facilities in California; \n15 4.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctions requiring that Defendants immediately \n16 cease acts that constitute false advertising and violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act and \n17 the Elder Financial Abuse statute as alleged herein with respect to Defendants’ misrepresentations, \n18 misleading statements, and material omissions, and to enjoin Defendants from continuing to \n19 engage in any such acts or practices in the future; \n20 5.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctions requiring that BROOKDALE disclose \n21 to Plaintiffs, the putative class members and the consuming public that its corporate staffing \n22 policies and procedures preclude it from providing its residents the care and services they have \n23 been promised and places all residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive \n24 the care and services they have paid for on any given day, and prohibiting BROOKDALE from \n25 charging fees based on the residents’ Personal Service Plans when BROOKDALE does not, in \n26 fact, provide adequate staffing levels to perform the personal services identified in those plans; \n27 6.  For statutory damages pursuant to California Civil Code § 52(a); \n28   87\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \nCase No. 17-cv-03962-JD \n   \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03962-JD   Document 20   Filed 08/25/17   Page 89 of 91\n \n1 7.  For statutory damages pursuant to California Civil Code § 1780(a) and (b); \n2 8.  For actual damages according to proof, excepting any damages for personal injury, \n3 emotional distress and/or wrongful death suffered by the named Plaintiffs or any class member; \n4 9.

Plaintiffs and the proposed Classes bring this action for declaratory and \n3  injunctive relief and damages to stop the unlawful and fraudulent practices of Brookdale \n4  Senior Living, Inc. and Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc. (“BROOKDALE” or \n5  “Defendants”). \n6  2.  Plaintiffs are elderly or dependent individuals living in California who have \n7  significant care needs and disabilities.  Plaintiffs and their families were overwhelmed by \n8  and required assistance with their activities of daily living including, but not limited to, \n9  assistance with managing and taking medication, housekeeping, laundry, dressing, bathing, \n10  toileting, hygiene, food preparation, and transportation.  Plaintiffs and their families and \n11  the classes they seek to represent either chose a BROOKDALE facility or chose to stay in \n12  a facility purchased by BROOKDALE because they believed BROOKDALE’s repeated \n13  promises to provide the care and assistance that would allow them to age with dignity.  \n14  Instead, Plaintiffs, their family members, and the proposed class members have all \n15  encountered in BROOKDALE a system of understaffed assisted living facilities that fails \n16  to consistently provide even the most basic level of promised care. \n17  3.  Defendant BROOKDALE has engaged in a policy and practice of violating \n18  Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et \n19  seq., accompanying regulations, and the Unruh Civil Rights Act (“Unruh Act”), California \n20  Civil Code §§ 51 et seq.  Among other things, Defendant has violated the ADA by failing \n21  to make its assisted living facilities readily accessible to and usable by persons with \n22  disabilities even though both the ADA and the Unruh Act impose affirmative duties upon \n23  Defendants to make their assisted living facilities accessible.  As set forth below, \n24  Defendants have a policy and practice of leaving physical access barriers in place in their \n25  newly constructed, altered and/or existing facilities in violation of the ADA and the Unruh \n26  Act.  Defendants have failed to perform new construction and alterations in compliance \n27  with applicable federal and state disability access standards, including but not limited to \n28  the 1991 Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (“ADAAG”) and the \n  1  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 3 of 110\n \n1  2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, and have failed to evaluate their newly \n2  constructed and/or altered assisted living facilities to identify and remediate non-compliant \n3  and inaccessible construction and alterations therein.  Defendants have also failed and \n4  refused to identify and remove physical access barriers from their existing assisted living \n5  facilities where such barrier removal was readily achievable within the meaning of the \n6  ADA.  As a result of Defendants’ corporate policies and practices regarding disability \n7  access, Defendants’ assisted living facilities are characterized by multiple, pervasive \n8  physical access barriers that limit or deny full and equal access to persons with disabilities. \n9  4.  Moreover, Defendants have failed to make reasonable modifications to its \n10  policies, practices and procedures that are necessary for persons with disabilities to have \n11  full and equal access to and enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities, privileges, \n12  advantages and accommodations provided by BROOKDALE’s facilities.  Defendants’ \n13  goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations include \n14  providing assistance with activities of daily living (assistance with eating, housekeeping \n15  and laundry, bathing, grooming, dressing, toileting, personal hygiene, provision of \n16  nutritious meals), medication management (ordering and storage of medications, assistance \n17  taking medications), social and recreational activities (group exercise, games, movies, \n18  scenic drives, happy hours and social mixers, and assistance with arrangements for \n19  utilization of local resources), and transportation to and coordination of off-site services.  \n20  Plaintiffs have specifically requested that Defendant BROOKDALE make reasonable \n21  modifications to its staffing policies, practices and procedures for its assisted living \n22  facilities in order to ensure that there is staffing in sufficient numbers and with adequate \n23  training to provide timely and effective assistance and care to residents with disabilities.  \n24  Despite the fact that such modifications are necessary to ensure that residents with \n25  disabilities receive full and equal access to and enjoyment of Defendants’ goods, services, \n26  facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations, and despite the fact that such \n27  modifications will not result in any fundamental alteration to BROOKDALE’s public \n28  accommodations, Defendants have refused to do so. \n  2  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 4 of 110\n \n1  5.  In addition, Defendants have violated the ADA by failing and refusing to \n2  provide residents with mobility disabilities with full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n3  its transportation services.  Further, Defendants have discriminated against residents with \n4  disabilities by failing to provide them with an emergency evacuation plan that is designed \n5  for and reasonably calculated to ensure the prompt and effective evacuation of persons \n6  with disabilities in the event of emergency. \n7  6.  Defendant BROOKDALE has also engaged in a policy and practice of \n8  violating the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”), Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750 et seq., \n9  committing Elder Financial Abuse, Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30, and Unlawful, \n10  Unfair and Fraudulent Business Practices (“UCL”), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et \n11  seq.  Defendants promise to provide the elderly and disabled the “quality of life they’ve \n12  earned,” but Defendants instead engage in a scheme to defraud seniors, persons with \n13  disabilities, and their family members.  In order to induce the elderly and disabled to move \n14  into and stay at its California assisted living facilities, BROOKDALE makes \n15  misrepresentations and misleading statements and conceals material facts about the quality \n16  and availability of care available at BROOKDALE.  Reasonable consumers are misled to \n17  believe, and reasonably expect, that BROOKDALE determines each resident’s needs and \n18  staffs each facility accordingly to deliver personalized care to meet those needs.  Instead, \n19  BROOKDALE systemically understaffs its facilities, cuts caregiver hours, and fails to \n20  train workers, all to boost its profitability, while the residents in BROOKDALE’s care are \n21  forced to endure increasingly expensive monthly charges and worsening care.  The results \n22  of BROOKDALE’s callous and profit-driven approach are devastating: as multiple reports \n23  by state regulators confirm, residents are left without assistance for hours after falling, they \n24  are given the wrong medications, they are denied clean clothing, showers, and nutritious \n25  food, and they are left in their own waste for long periods of time. \n26  7.  On any given day, residents of BROOKDALE’s many California facilities \n27  live with a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid \n28  for and that they need.  Scores of family and resident council meetings and hundreds of \n  3  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 5 of 110\n \n1  communications to BROOKDALE management have failed to rectify these problems, \n2  leaving Plaintiffs and the class no choice but to seek redress in this Court. \n3  8.  This lawsuit seeks to end this systemic discrimination against persons with \n4  disabilities by requiring Defendants to provide them with full and equal access to and \n5  enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s facilities, services, goods, privileges, advantages and \n6  accommodations.  This action seeks to require that Defendants staff their facilities with a \n7  sufficient number of adequately trained staff to ensure that residents with disabilities are \n8  provided with full and equal access to and enjoyment of the services specified in \n9  BROOKDALE’s own resident assessments.  In addition, this action seeks to require that \n10  Defendants provide assistive living facilities that are readily accessible to and usable by \n11  persons with disabilities as required by the ADA.  Further, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief \n12  requiring Defendants to provide full and equal access to and enjoyment of Defendants’ \n13  transportation services and activities.  Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief requiring \n14  Defendants to provide adequate emergency planning and evacuation procedures for \n15  residents with disabilities.  With respect to the CLRA, the UCL and the Elder Financial \n16  Abuse statute, this action seeks to require Defendants to disclose to prospective and current \n17  residents, their family members or responsible parties, and the class that BROOKDALE’s \n18  existing staffing policies and procedures preclude it from providing its residents with all \n19  the care and services they have been promised and are paying for.  Further, this action \n20  seeks to enjoin BROOKDALE from charging residents or their responsible parties \n21  monthly fees based on their Personal Service Plans until BROOKDALE implements \n22  staffing policies and procedures that enable it to deliver those services on a consistent \n23  basis. \n24  9.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law and, unless BROOKDALE is \n25  preliminarily and permanently enjoined, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm \n26  as a result of being denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s \n27  goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations.  Plaintiffs seek \n28  declaratory and injunctive relief and statutory and actual damages as set forth below \n  4  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 6 of 110\n \n1  against BROOKDALE for its policy and practice of denying Plaintiffs full and equal \n2  access to and enjoyment of its services and facilities and violating the ADA and its \n3  accompanying regulations, the Unruh Act, and the CLRA, for committing Elder Financial \n4  Abuse, and for engaging in Unlawful, Unfair and Fraudulent Business Practices.  Plaintiffs \n5  also seek recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and litigation expenses under \n6  federal and state law. \n7  EXHAUSTION OF PRE-LAWSUIT PROCEDURES FOR STATE LAW CLAIMS \n8  10.  By letter dated June 2, 2017, Plaintiffs notified Defendants of Plaintiffs’ \n9  intent to file suit against it based on violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, as \n10  required by California Civil Code § 1782.  BROOKDALE received the letter on June 6, \n11  2017.  More than 30 days have passed since BROOKDALE’s receipt, and BROOKDALE \n12  has not corrected or remedied the violations alleged in the notice and herein. \n13  11.  Though they were not required to do so, Plaintiffs also notified \n14  BROOKDALE of its multiple violations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities \n15  Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1201 et seq., the Unruh Civil Rights Act, California’s elder financial \n16  abuse law, and California’s Unfair Competition Law. \n17  JURISDICTION \n18  12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to  \n19  28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3)-(4).  The Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \n20  §§ 12101 et seq., presents federal questions and confers jurisdiction on this Court over \n21  Plaintiffs’ claims regardless of the amount in controversy.  This Court also has subject \n22  matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2)(A) because this is a \n23  class action in which the proposed class includes at least 100 members, the amount in \n24  controversy exceeds $5,000,000, exclusive of interests and costs, and at least one putative \n25  class member is a citizen of a state different from one of the defendants.  Plaintiffs seek \n26  damages in the amount of a minimum $9,000 per class member and believe that the class \n27  consists of over 5,000 persons, making the amount in controversy well in excess of \n28  $5,000,000.  BROOKDALE is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business \n  5  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 7 of 110\n \n1  in Tennessee, making it a citizen of both Delaware and Tennessee, and each of the named \n2  Plaintiffs are citizens of the State of California.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, this Court \n3  has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ pendent claims under California law. \n4  13.  Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in this Court because \n5  Defendants have sufficient minimum contacts in California, or otherwise intentionally \n6  avail themselves of the California market through ownership and/or management of \n7  assisted living facilities located in California, derivation of substantial revenues from \n8  California, and other activities, so as to render the exercise of jurisdiction over Defendants \n9  by the California courts consistent with the traditional notions of fair play and substantial \n10  justice. \n11  VENUE \n12  14.  Venue is proper in the Northern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n13  § 1391(b), because the acts upon which this action is based occurred in part in this District \n14  within the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Lake, Monterey, Napa, San Mateo, Santa \n15  Clara, Santa Cruz, and Sonoma. \n16  15.  A substantial part of the events or omissions which gave rise to Plaintiffs’ \n17  claims arose in the County of Sonoma and thus, pursuant to Civil Local Rules 3-2(c) and \n18  (d), assignment to the Oakland Division of the District Court for the Northern District of \n19  California is proper. \n20  THE PARTIES \n21  16.

Plaintiff PATRICIA “PAT” LINDSTROM is the wife of ARTHUR “ART” \n17  LINDSTROM.  ART LINDSTROM died on February 23, 2018, and PAT LINDSTROM \n18  is his successor-in-interest.  A successor-in-interest declaration was filed concurrently with \n19  the Second Amended Complaint.  See ECF No. 52-1.  At all times relevant to this \n20  complaint, Mr. LINDSTROM was a qualified person with disabilities within the meaning \n21  of the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act.

Defendant BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING, INC. is a corporation \n17  organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal place of business in \n18  Brentwood, Tennessee.  Defendant BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES, \n19  INC. is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with its principal \n20  place of business in Brentwood, Tennessee.  BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING, INC. and \n21  BROOKDALE SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES, INC. will be referred to collectively \n22  as “BROOKDALE” or “Defendants.” BROOKDALE owns, manages, and/or operates \n23  approximately eighty-nine (89) assisted living facilities throughout California.  It is the \n24  largest chain of senior living facilities in California and the United States.  \n25  BROOKDALE’s operations are centralized, hierarchical and standardized, and all of \n26  BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities in California use the same uniform corporate \n27  policies, practices and procedures.  These corporate policies, practices and procedures \n28  control all aspects of the operations, staffing and staff training in its assisted living \n  10  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 12 of 110\n \n1  facilities.  All of BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities in California are required to \n2  follow the uniform policies, practices and procedures established by BROOKDALE’s \n3  corporate headquarters.    \n4  25.  BROOKDALE’s unlawful conduct as alleged herein has been widespread, \n5  repeated, and consistent at each of its locations.  The operations of BROOKDALE’s \n6  assisted living facilities in California are standardized, if not identical.  BROOKDALE’s \n7  conduct, as alleged herein, was and is part of a statewide plan, practice, course of conduct \n8  and scheme, and affects all of the residents of BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities. \n9  26.  Defendants DOES 1-100 are sued herein under fictitious names because \n10  Plaintiffs do not presently know their true names and capacities.  Plaintiffs will seek leave \n11  to amend this Complaint to allege their true names and capacities when such are \n12  discovered.  Plaintiffs allege that each of these Defendants was responsible in some \n13  capacity for the events alleged herein, or is a necessary party for obtaining appropriate \n14  relief.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that in carrying out each of \n15  the acts and violations alleged in this Complaint, each Defendant acted as an agent, \n16  principal, and/or representative for each other Defendant. \n17  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n18  27.  BROOKDALE is the largest provider of assisted living for senior citizens \n19  and persons with disabilities in the nation and has the largest number of assisted living \n20  facility residents within the state of California.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege \n21  that there are more than 5,000 residents in Defendants’ eighty-nine facilities in California. \n22  28.  Assisted living facilities, also called Residential Care Facilities for the \n23  Elderly (“RCFEs”), offer room, board and daily assistance for seniors and persons with \n24  disabilities in certain activities of daily living (“ADLs”), such as preparing meals, \n25  shopping, transportation, preparing and taking medication, housekeeping, laundry, bathing, \n26  toileting, grooming, dressing, and others. \n27  29.  Assisted living facilities are intended to provide a level of care appropriate \n28  for those who are unable to live by themselves, but who do not have medical conditions \n  11  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 13 of 110\n \n1  requiring more extensive nursing care. \n2  30.  In recent years, BROOKDALE has increasingly been accepting and retaining \n3  more residents with conditions and care needs that were once handled almost exclusively \n4  in skilled nursing facilities.  This has allowed it to increase not only the potential resident \n5  pool but also the amounts of money charged to residents and/or their family members. \n6  31.  At BROOKDALE facilities, residents are charged a base rate, which \n7  includes room, board, basic maintenance, housekeeping, laundry, dining services, planned \n8  social and recreational programs, scheduled transportation services, staffing 24 hours a \n9  day, observation and consultation, and assistance with access to outside services.  \n10  BROOKDALE uses its resident assessment system to assess each resident before \n11  admission and then again periodically throughout residency and/or whenever there is a \n12  change of the resident’s condition.  By performing these assessments, BROOKDALE \n13  determines what additional services a resident needs, such as assistance with ADLs, and \n14  develops a Personal Service Plan for the resident.  Each additional need, or service, is \n15  assigned a monthly Personal Service Rate, which is added onto the resident’s base rate.  \n16  The more personal services determined by BROOKDALE to be needed by a resident, the \n17  more money BROOKDALE charges that resident. \n18  32.  Every month, BROOKDALE sends each resident or his or her responsible \n19  party an invoice for services that BROOKDALE represents it will provide in the following \n20  month.  These invoices reflect the monthly rate for the Basic Services set forth in \n21  BROOKDALE’s standard residency agreements, the Personal Service Rate that is based \n22  on each resident’s Personal Service Plan, and any adjustments.  On information and belief, \n23  these monthly invoices range from approximately $4,000 to $10,000 per person per month. \n24  33.  On information and belief, as of January 1, 2016, BROOKDALE increased \n25  the Basic Service Rate and Personal Service Rate for residents in its California facilities by \n26  roughly 6%, and as of January 1, 2017, it raised these rates again by approximately 7%.  In \n27  standard form letters sent to residents attempting to explain these steep rate increases, \n28  BROOKDALE attributed them to increases in “the operating costs of your community,” \n  12  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 14 of 110\n \n1  including costs for “utility usage, insurance, supplies, and food.”  But in fact the Consumer \n2  Price Index for the Bay Area rose only 3.4% between approximately January 1, 2016 and \n3  December 31, 2016. \n4  Brookdale Fails to Provide Full and Equal Access To and Enjoyment of Its Facilities \nand Services to Persons With Disabilities In Violation of the ADA and the Unruh \n5  Civil Rights Act \n6  Physical Access Violations \n7  34.  BROOKDALE has violated Title III of the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights \n8  Act by failing to provide full and equal access to its facilities and services.  Rooms \n9  occupied by persons with mobility disabilities and common areas at the BROOKDALE \n10  San Ramon, Windsor, Fountaingrove, Scotts Valley, and likely other facilities, do not meet \n11  federal or state accessibility standards.  Under Title III, fifty percent of the residential \n12  rooms in long-term care facilities must meet the requirements of the 1991 ADAAG or the \n13  2010 ADA Standards.  BROOKDALE’s facilities do not meet these standards. \n14  35.  There is a pattern of physical access barriers in BROOKDALE facilities, as \n15  described below: \n16  a.  Wheelchair users are placed in rooms that do not have sufficient \n17  turning space in the bathrooms or the bedroom area.  This means that \n18  they often cannot even use their bathroom unless they are able to \n19  transfer out of their wheelchair and enter without it.  Those who can \n20  enter in their wheelchair usually do not have enough space to transfer \n21  safely onto the toilet or into the shower or to use the sink or vanity \n22  space.  Some residents have given up on using their inaccessible toilet \n23  and must rely on adult briefs and caregiving staff to clean them. \n24  b.  There is no clearance for wheelchairs under the sinks and/or the sinks \n25  are too high for a wheelchair user to reach them, preventing residents \n26  from using them. \n27  c.  The grab bars that do exist in the bathrooms are not compliant with \n28  applicable access standards, and there are no roll-in showers.  Both of \n  13  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 15 of 110\n \n1  these barriers are safety hazards, increasing the likelihood of falls.  \n2  They also prevent most persons with mobility disabilities from \n3  bathing as independently as possible.  Some wheelchair users have \n4  stopped using their showers altogether and instead take sponge baths, \n5  hardly an adequate substitute. \n6  d.  There are barriers to using the outdoor space for the residents’ rooms, \n7  including hard-to-open sliding doors, a lip at the threshold of the door, \n8  and insufficient space to accommodate a wheelchair.  This prevents \n9  persons with mobility disabilities from using their outdoor space as \n10  persons without disabilities can. \n11  e.  The closets do not have accessible hanging and storage space, in that \n12  they are placed out of the reach of a wheelchair user.  This prevents \n13  persons with mobility disabilities from accessing their clothing and \n14  other personal items, forcing them to rely on others for assistance. \n15  f.  Kitchen countertops and sinks are too high for a wheelchair user to \n16  access, preventing those residents from fully using their kitchens. \n17  g.  Heavy doors in common areas cannot be used independently by and \n18  pose a safety risk to many persons with disabilities. \n19  36.  These physical access barriers, which residents live with on a daily basis, \n20  prevent them from having full and equal access to their rooms as required by law. \n21  Understaffing \n22  37.  BROOKDALE does not schedule or provide sufficient numbers of trained \n23  staff to deliver promised services and meet the needs of its residents.  Plaintiffs allege on \n24  information and belief that BROOKDALE staffs its facilities based on predetermined labor \n25  budgets and desired profit margins.  Pursuant to Defendants’ corporate policies and \n26  procedures, the executive directors who manage individual BROOKDALE facilities must \n27  request permission from Defendants’ corporate headquarters to deviate from these pre-\n28  determined budgets.  Executive directors have a disincentive to request increased labor \n  14  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 16 of 110\n \n1  budgets for their facilities because they are not eligible for bonuses unless they meet \n2  earnings targets set by Defendants’ corporate headquarters.  As a result of Defendants’ \n3  corporate policies, practices and procedures BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities are \n4  inadequately staffed. \n5  38.  Reports issued by California Department of Social Services’ Community \n6  Care Licensing Division (“Community Care Licensing”), the state agency that regulates \n7  assisted living facilities, indicate that inadequate staffing pervades Defendants’ California \n8  facilities.  For instance, Community Care Licensing issued a citation to BROOKDALE \n9  Corona after a licensing inspector found “that there are not enough staff present” and \n10  observed five residents sitting unsupervised in the dining room and 19 residents in the \n11  activity room with only one staff member present.  In March 2017, Community Care \n12  Licensing cited a BROOKDALE facility in Santa Cruz County after a licensing inspector \n13  found that the facility did not have an adequate amount of staff to meet residents’ needs.  \n14  In June 2016, BROOKDALE Oceanside received a citation because it had only two \n15  caregivers on duty during daytime hours in the assisted living part of its facility. \n16  39.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that BROOKDALE uses pre-\n17  determined staffing schedules at its facilities and does not change these schedules or the \n18  number of staff hours worked when the facility has more residents or residents with greater \n19  needs.  Community Care Licensing records demonstrate the inadequacy of Defendants’ \n20  staffing to meet even the most basic needs of residents.  For instance, a personnel report \n21  that BROOKDALE filed with Community Care Licensing in February 2017 indicates that \n22  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, a facility in Sonoma County, is understaffed for the night \n23  shift from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.  That schedule lists only four resident caregivers \n24  assigned to the night shift, three of whom work only three days a week, with the result that \n25  in many instances there are as few as one resident caregiver on duty during the night shift \n26  to care for approximately 100 residents on three floors.  Moreover, the official numbers of \n27  caregivers on duty is often quite deceptive, as BROOKDALE frequently pulls caregivers \n28  from their responsibilities in order to perform other tasks, such as serving meals in the \n  15  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 17 of 110\n \n1  dining room. \n2  40.  As a direct result of Defendants’ discriminatory staffing practices, residents \n3  with disabilities have not received or run a substantial risk of not receiving the personal \n4  services, emergency and evacuation response, dining services, housekeeping and laundry \n5  services, transportation, and activities for which they are paying and that are necessary for \n6  full and equal enjoyment of Defendants’ goods, services, facilities, benefits, advantages \n7  and accommodations. \n8  Impact of Understaffing on Personal Services \n9  41.  The lack of sufficient numbers of trained staff at BROOKDALE means that \n10  residents with disabilities who need and pay for assistance with bathing, dressing, brushing \n11  their teeth, toileting, incontinence care, and other hygiene assistance do not receive it on a \n12  routine basis.  Scheduled showers are routinely skipped by staff who do not have time to \n13  bathe residents.  Staff often leave residents unattended on the toilet because another \n14  resident has activated their call pendant, and there is no one else available to respond.  \n15  Residents have been left on their bed undressed by staff called away to attend to other \n16  residents in need. \n17  42.  Residents who need assistance getting to the bathroom often wait for long \n18  periods of time for staff to respond to their call pendants.  Because they must wait so long \n19  for assistance, some residents have given up using the toilet altogether, instead relying on \n20  adult briefs and a caregiver to clean and change them when they have time.  Incontinent \n21  residents often wait for thirty minutes or more for a staff member to help them change out \n22  of soiled briefs, raising the risk of urinary tract infections and decubitus ulcers.  For \n23  example, an inspector from Community Care Licensing found in May 2016 that \n24  BROOKDALE San Pablo had insufficient staff to meet the residents’ needs, noting that \n25  “[i]ndividuals requiring incontinence care are not always changed in a timely manner.”  In \n26  November 2016, a licensing inspector found that even though a resident at BROOKDALE \n27  Cherry Hills was paying for regular incontinence checks, she was left lying on the floor for \n28  an extended amount of time after a fall because staff failed to check on her.  In March of \n  16  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 18 of 110\n \n1  2017, a licensing inspector cited BROOKDALE Palm Springs for not providing a resident \n2  with those basic and personal care services—assistance with showering, dressing, \n3  transportation and medication—that the resident needed and for which the facility was \n4  being paid. \n5  43.  Insufficient staffing has also caused and continues to cause errors in \n6  medication administration, including providing the wrong dosage or the wrong medication, \n7  untimely or missed doses, and/or a failure to implement physicians’ orders.  Community \n8  Care Licensing has documented several examples from BROOKDALE’s Sonoma County \n9  facilities that illustrate the broader problem.  Community Care Licensing records show that \n10  the agency cited BROOKDALE Chanate five times on consecutive visits between October \n11  28, 2015 and October 13, 2016 for failing to give residents their prescribed medications.  \n12  At BROOKDALE Windsor, a resident received a double dose of medication because the \n13  nurse who administered the first dose failed to document that it had been given.  On a \n14  different occasion, staff gave a resident at BROOKDALE Windsor a medication that had \n15  been prescribed for a different resident.  Meanwhile, at BROOKDALE Rohnert Park, \n16  licensing inspectors found that staff were not properly trained on storing and administering \n17  residents’ medication, leading to a narcotic pill that went missing in August 2016 and \n18  staff’s failure to administer medications in October 2016.  Numerous other reports issued \n19  by Community Care Licensing confirm that problems with medication administration \n20  pervade Defendants’ facilities throughout California.  For example, Community Care \n21  Licensing cited BROOKDALE Palm Springs when 20 residents missed their medication \n22  doses on December 24, 2016 because there was no med tech on duty.  At BROOKDALE \n23  San Ramon, someone stole a number of residents’ medication from the facility during the \n24  overnight shift (“NOC SHIFT”) between July 9 and 10, 2017.  The facility did not inform \n25  all of the residents’ family members of the theft.  When one resident’s daughter-in-law, \n26  who learned about the theft from the resident, asked the facility’s acting Executive \n27  Director, Shawn Cull, which employees were on duty during the NOC shift, he told her \n28  that there were only two employees on duty to respond to all residents at the facility.  The \n  17  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 19 of 110\n \n1  facility has an occupancy of between approximately 70 to 80 residents.  Because no one \n2  was immediately available at the facility to pick up refills, at least one resident did not \n3  receive her pain medication until later that evening and was extremely anxious until that \n4  time.  Another resident’s family was not informed of the theft until almost 6 p.m., after the \n5  resident’s physician’s offices had closed and the family could not obtain a refill.  That \n6  resident was given an inadequate substitute pain medication in the evening, which was \n7  distressing to the resident and her family members, who had to reassure and calm her.  The \n8  following day, although BROOKDALE was notified that the refill was ready for pick-up at \n9  10 a.m., the resident told her family that she did not receive her prescribed pain medication \n10  until 4 p.m. \n11  44.  BROOKDALE’s understaffing creates many dangerous situations for \n12  residents.  Among those are an increase in elopements from facilities by persons with \n13  cognitive impairments, because the facilities do not hire staff in sufficient numbers or with \n14  the training necessary to monitor residents and prevent escapes.  For example, \n15  BROOKDALE Oceanside was cited in April and September of 2016 for relying on \n16  delayed egress systems to compensate for insufficient staffing, resulting in resident \n17  elopements.  An informal conference was held by Community Care Licensing with \n18  BROOKDALE Oceanside management in December 2016 as a result of the elopements \n19  and other compliance failures.  Subsequently, on April 26, 2017, BROOKDALE staff \n20  failed to monitor residents on an outing, and one wandered away for approximately an \n21  hour. \n22  Impact of Understaffing on Pendant Call Systems and Medical Emergencies \n23  45.  BROOKDALE’S failure to staff sufficiently results in caregivers’ inability to \n24  respond promptly to call pendants, if at all.  BROOKDALE has represented that residents \n25  who wear a call pendant, and pay a monthly fee for this service, may push a button to alert \n26  staff if they have an emergency, and staff will immediately respond to provide assistance.  \n27  Residents with disabilities rely heavily on these call pendants for assistance with basic \n28  tasks and activities of daily living, as well as for emergencies.  However, the call pendants \n  18  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 20 of 110\n \n1  do not notify staff of the resident’s location should they not be in their room.  In or about \n2  late 2016, a BROOKDALE San Ramon resident fell and hit his head on the pavement in \n3  the facility parking lot and pressed his pendant.  No one responded.  Bleeding profusely \n4  from his head, he used his mobile phone to call the front desk.  The son of another \n5  resident, a fire chief with emergency response training, found the resident in the parking \n6  lot just as BROOKDALE’s bookkeeper and maintenance director responded to the \n7  resident’s telephone call.  Because those employees have no caregiver or emergency \n8  response training, they would not even touch the resident.  The fire chief had to call 911 \n9  and administer first aid while waiting. \n10  46.  Moreover, contrary to Defendants’ representations, staff do not immediately \n11  respond when residents use their call pendants.  For instance, in November 2016, a \n12  resident in the BROOKDALE Paso Robles facility pushed her emergency pendant after \n13  falling in her room and waited 22 hours on the floor with broken bones until staff finally \n14  found her.  That same month, a resident at the BROOKDALE Fountaingrove fell, injured \n15  her head, pressed her call pendant, and waited thirty minutes bleeding profusely from her \n16  head before staff arrived.  She died 10 days later.  In January 2017, a former resident of \n17  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove waited three hours for staff to respond to a call.  \n18  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of not maintaining its call pendant system properly \n19  and of not providing sufficient staff to respond to call pendants deprives residents with \n20  disabilities of full and equal enjoyment of its goods, services, facilities, and benefits. \n21  47.  Community Care Licensing records indicate lengthy emergency response \n22  times at Defendants’ facilities throughout California.  For example, in February 2017 a \n23  licensing inspector found that staff at BROOKDALE Riverside routinely took over 10 \n24  minutes to respond to emergency pendant calls, and on one occasion took 36 minutes to \n25  respond.  At BROOKDALE Orangevale, a licensing inspector tested an emergency call \n26  pendant during a January 2017 visit and found that it took over 45 minutes for facility staff \n27  to respond.  At BROOKDALE North Tarzana, a review of the facility’s records revealed \n28  numerous response times of over 30 minutes, including multiple response times of over an \n  19  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 21 of 110\n \n1  hour.  A licensing inspector who tested emergency pull cords at BROOKDALE \n2  Chatsworth found that it took staff 24 minutes to respond during a June 2016 inspection; \n3  during another visit, the inspector found that it took staff 30 minutes to respond, and that \n4  they did so only after the inspector alerted the facility administrators.  At BROOKDALE \n5  Oceanside, an inspector found that as of April and May 2016, there were times when staff \n6  did not answer residents’ calls for 15 to 45 minutes.  The inspector’s report noted that there \n7  were only two direct caregivers on duty during the day and evening shifts at the facility, \n8  which has a capacity of 186 residents, and that those caregivers were responsible for \n9  numerous tasks in addition to answering emergency calls on two floors.  Community Care \n10  Licensing cited BROOKDALE Fountaingrove at the end of March 2017 after a review of \n11  the pendant system report revealed many instances of extremely lengthy response times, \n12  noting in particular a pendant pressed at 5:23 p.m. which was not answered for over 39 \n13  minutes and a pendant set off at 5:45 p.m. to which staff did not respond for one hour and \n14  27 minutes. \n15  48.  Even when Defendants’ staff do respond within a reasonable amount of time \n16  to a request for assistance, the response is often inadequate.  In one case, staff at \n17  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove failed to notify a resident’s family after the resident had a \n18  fall and was sent to the emergency room.  Staff also failed to send identifying information \n19  or documents with the resident, as required by Defendants’ policies and procedures.  As a \n20  result, the resident was listed as a Jane Doe until the next morning.  A doctor at the \n21  hospital told the resident’s daughter that he would have operated on the resident shortly \n22  after she was admitted, but had to wait until the next morning because he had no family \n23  contact numbers to call.  The Community Care Licensing inspector who investigated this \n24  incident noted that she observed insufficient staffing at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove to \n25  ensure that the facility’s own policies and procedures were being followed.  On another \n26  occasion, a BROOKDALE Fountaingrove resident pressed the call button on her pendant \n27  because she could tell she was going to have terrible diarrhea.  While she waited for a \n28  response, the resident headed for the toilet, but by the time she got there, she had already \n  20  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 22 of 110\n \n1  soiled herself and her nightgown.  Although a caregiver responded to the pendant call, \n2  when the caregiver looked in the bathroom and saw the resident sitting on the toilet, she \n3  left without providing assistance and never returned.  The resident screamed for help and \n4  pressed the emergency button next to the toilet, but no one responded until roughly an hour \n5  later, when a new set of caregivers started their shifts. \n6  49.  Residents must resort to calling 911 for assistance when staff fail to promptly \n7  respond to their call pendants.  For example, public records kept by the Rincon Valley & \n8  Windsor Fire Protection Districts revealed that in a one-year period from June 2016 \n9  through May 2017, the agency responded to 83 emergency calls from 907 Adele Drive, the \n10  address of BROOKDALE Windsor.  Community Care Licensing records indicate that this \n11  facility has a capacity of 80, but often has fewer than 70 residents, suggesting that \n12  BROOKDALE Windsor residents averaged well over one 911 call per person over the past \n13  year.  Many of these calls were classified as “medical assists,” meaning the Rincon \n14  Valley & Windsor Fire Protection Districts provided assistance to another group or agency \n15  that had primary responsibility for medical care, such as assisting with moving a heavy \n16  patient.  Several of these 911 calls were classified as instances where a member of the \n17  public called the fire protection districts for routine help, such as assisting a person in \n18  returning to a bed or chair, with no transport or medical treatment given. \n19  50.  In other cases, Defendants’ staff failed to monitor residents’ health status as \n20  promised, placing residents in danger and distress in situations where the resident was not \n21  able to call for help.  At BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, one resident was left in her \n22  wheelchair all night because she requires staff assistance to get in and out of her \n23  wheelchair, but staff failed to help her into bed and never checked on her during the night.  \n24  In another case, a resident at BROOKDALE Scotts Valley fell in his apartment and went \n25  without food or water for 24 to 30 hours because staff failed to check on him.  The resident \n26  was taken to a hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with dehydration and \n27  rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which damaged skeletal muscle tissue breaks down and the \n28  damaged muscle cells are released into the bloodstream, causing further injury.  At \n  21  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 23 of 110\n \n1  BROOKDALE Riverside, a resident fell while outside and suffered severe sunburns \n2  because staff failed to regularly check on him.  In November 2016, Community Care \n3  Licensing issued a citation to BROOKDALE Hemet based on an incident in which staff \n4  left a resident with a known risk of falling unattended in a dining room chair.  The resident \n5  fell and hit his head, requiring ten stitches.  Just three days later, Defendants’ staff again \n6  left the resident unattended, and he fell and re-injured his head.  The licensing inspector \n7  noted that this resident had additional staff supervision as part of his care plan, but that \n8  BROOKDALE Hemet lacked sufficient staff to meet the resident’s needs. \n9  51.  Because Defendants’ staff are stretched so thin responding to emergency \n10  calls and attending to their other duties, they have attempted to dissuade residents from \n11  calling for assistance.  Residents have been told by overworked caregivers to use their call \n12  buttons “only in an emergency,” despite the fact that, short of screaming for help, this is \n13  the only way to alert caregivers that they need the assistance for which they are paying \n14  BROOKDALE.  In many instances, residents feel bad for overworked caregivers and \n15  attempt to perform tasks on their own, despite paying BROOKDALE for these services.  \n16  This has led to residents’ falling or otherwise injuring themselves. \n17  Impact of Understaffing on Dining Services \n18  52.  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing has resulted in its \n19  cutting staffing hours and eliminating positions in dining services.  As a result, residents \n20  wait for long periods of time to be served.  Some residents give up in frustration.  Food is \n21  often served cold, and residents do not dare to make a special request, for fear that the wait \n22  will be extreme.  Moreover, the quality of the food has so deteriorated that it is in many \n23  cases nearly inedible.  Fresh ingredients are rare, meat of poor quality is hidden under \n24  sauces, and both residents and licensing inspectors have encountered food beyond its \n25  expiration date.  The understaffing also prevents staff from maintaining a clean and \n26  hygienic dining area. \n27  53.  At BROOKDALE San Ramon, the hours of serving staff were cut, and \n28  servers have left as a result, leaving the dining department severely understaffed.  At \n  22  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 24 of 110\n \n1  breakfast, there is often one server for 80 people.  On at least one day during June 2017, \n2  there were no servers in the dining room for breakfast, and the activities director was \n3  cleaning the tables while the chef both cooked and served meals.  At BROOKDALE \n4  Windsor, licensing inspectors found a single staff member working morning shifts in the \n5  dining room, with dirty dishes and food droppings strewn about because no other staff \n6  members were available to clean up.  BROOKDALE Riverside received a Community \n7  Care Licensing citation after investigators found that food was served cold and residents \n8  had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for food to be served.  The investigator \n9  attributed this problem to understaffing, noting in her report that “[i]t was revealed there is \n10  not enough servers for the number of residents in the dining room at one time.”  On a visit \n11  to BROOKDALE Corona, the licensing inspector found five residents sitting in the dining \n12  room without supervision, and noted that caregivers were expected to serve lunch, clean \n13  the dining room after meals, and sweep the floors in the dining room in addition to their \n14  other duties.  The same inspector found uncovered and dried-out ham and cheese \n15  sandwiches in the refrigerator and unrefrigerated cartons of strawberry milk in a cupboard. \n16  54.  The long waits and substandard meals in the dining room mean that some \n17  residents either purchase their own food or often forgo meals altogether, despite the fact \n18  that residents are paying BROOKDALE for three meals per day and snacks.  Residents’ \n19  nutrition needs are not being met, and to the extent that they look forward to meals as a \n20  pleasant social experience, they are being deprived of that benefit as well.  Residents have \n21  made numerous complaints to Defendants about the dining service, individually and \n22  through the family and resident councils.  For example, the Resident Council at \n23  BROOKDALE San Ramon has been complaining about the problems in dining services \n24  for over two years.  Yet residents have seen no durable improvements. There may be \n25  temporary improvements from time to time, but the overall trend is actually downward. \n26  Impact of Understaffing on Housekeeping and Laundry \n27  55.  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing extends to \n28  housekeeping and laundry services.  For example, on information and belief, \n  23  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 25 of 110\n \n1  BROOKDALE San Ramon went for many months with only one housekeeper to clean \n2  approximately 80 rooms.  As a result, the maintenance director and the executive director \n3  also had to clean rooms and consequently had less time to perform maintenance and \n4  administrative duties.  Residents’ rooms have been left in deplorable and often unsanitary \n5  conditions, including toilet seats and showers covered in feces and rooms which smell \n6  strongly of urine. \n7  56.  BROOKDALE routinely fails to wash residents’ personal belongings and \n8  bed linens.  Even when BROOKDALE’s staff take these items for laundering, residents’ \n9  clothes and linens are often lost, or they are given back other residents’ clothing or linen \n10  instead of their own.  Residents are left in dirty and malodorous clothing.  For example, \n11  Loresia Vallette, the granddaughter of former BROOKDALE Hemet resident \n12  LAWRENCE QUINLAN observed that her grandfather’s clothes were never washed, and \n13  that staff continued to dress him in the same pair of urine-stained pants.  Some residents or \n14  their family members have despaired of waiting and begun to perform these services on \n15  their own, despite BROOKDALE’s promise to provide them as part of their base rate. \n16  Discrimination in Transportation/Activities \n17  57.  Due to chronic understaffing at Defendants’ facilities, promised \n18  transportation services and activities are often sporadic or nonexistent.  Many residents \n19  rely on BROOKDALE for transportation to medical and lab appointments, church, grocery \n20  shopping, banking and other activities.  Additionally, they expected and would enjoy both \n21  on- and off-site activities.  Yet they do not receive these services on a regular basis, if at \n22  all.  Scheduled activities—such as poker, bingo and movies—are frequently cancelled, and \n23  BROOKDALE regularly fails to provide the promised transportation services to its \n24  residents.  Residents are often told about cancellations at the last minute for shuttles to \n25  planned events, such as church services.  The lack of staffing at BROOKDALE San \n26  Ramon means that its activities director must fulfill multiple duties.  In addition to her \n27  expected duties, she often works in the dining room serving food or cleaning and at the \n28  front desk as a receptionist.  She is frequently the only driver for facility-provided \n  24  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 26 of 110\n \n1  transportation.  On several occasions, residents of BROOKDALE San Ramon have been \n2  left waiting outside a medical office or a church because BROOKDALE staff forgot to \n3  pick them up and had to rely on others to take them back to the facility. \n4  58.  Additionally, BROOKDALE has implemented policies and practices \n5  regarding its provision of transportation services that discriminate against persons with \n6  mobility disabilities.  Residents at BROOKDALE San Ramon who use wheelchairs must \n7  be able to transfer from their chairs to a seat in the bus, despite the existence of a \n8  wheelchair lift and a system for securing wheelchairs in at least one of BROOKDALE San \n9  Ramon’s buses.  Making this transfer is impossible and/or unsafe for many wheelchair \n10  users.  The facility also requires wheelchair users to arrange for a family member or an \n11  outside care attendant to accompany them on any off-site activity, which deters many \n12  wheelchair users from participating and imposes a surcharge on those who do.  The facility \n13  also limits the number of wheelchair users for each off-site trip to two.  At BROOKDALE \n14  Fountaingrove, wheelchair users are limited to two off-site trips per month.  At least one \n15  wheelchair user at BROOKDALE San Ramon was told that she could not participate in \n16  regular Saturday trips to the grocery store and shopping, because the driver “couldn’t \n17  handle her.” \n18  Emergency Evacuation Procedures \n19  59.  BROOKDALE has emergency and evacuation policies and procedures in \n20  place for at least some of its facilities, but these policies and procedures do not take into \n21  account the needs of persons with disabilities, or if they do, Defendants have not informed \n22  the residents.  Residents with disabilities have been told to wait in their rooms for someone \n23  to come, and although the facilities have emergency drills, staff have not demonstrated for \n24  residents what will happen in the event of an actual emergency. \n25  60.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that these \n26  practices have been and are an official policy and practice by which Defendants operate \n27  their businesses and/or services. \n28  61.  Defendants’ failure and refusal to provide equal services to persons with \n  25  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 27 of 110\n \n1  disabilities is humiliating and degrading to and creates a serious safety risk for the \n2  members of the proposed class of persons with disabilities. \n3  62.  Defendants are responsible for their illegal operations and discriminatory \n4  policies and practices as described herein.  BROOKDALE residents, their family \n5  members, and staff members have raised these issues repeatedly with members of \n6  BROOKDALE management to no avail.   \n7  63.  Defendants have been notified of the civil rights violations described herein, \n8  but have refused to provide necessary reasonable modifications to its staffing policies, \n9  practices and procedures to provide residents with disabilities full and equal enjoyment of \n10  their goods, services, facilities, activities, benefits and accommodations and to comply \n11  with the requirements of the ADA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act .  \n12  Retaliation Against Resident Councils and Their Members \n13  64.  Pursuant to Cal. Health & Safety Code § 1569.157(a), residential care \n14  facilities must assist the residents in establishing and maintaining a resident council.  \n15  Moreover, a facility must respond in writing to any written concerns or recommendations \n16  submitted by the resident council within 14 days. Cal. H&S Code § 1569.157(c). \n17  65.  California law also prohibits assisted living facilities from willfully \n18  interfering with the “formation, maintenance, or promotion of a resident council.”  Cal. \n19  H&S Code § 1569.157(g).  The law defines “willful interference” as including \n20  “discrimination or retaliation in any way against an individual as a result of his or her \n21  participation in a resident council, refusal to publicize resident council meetings or provide \n22  appropriate space for either meetings or a bulletin board, or failure to respond to written \n23  requests by the resident council in a timely manner.”  Cal. H&S Code § 1569.157(g).   \n24  66.  BROOKDALE has not responded in writing to at least four letters sent to its \n25  corporate offices by Ms. JESTRABEK-HART in her capacity as chair of the \n26  BROOKDALE Scotts Valley residents’ council.  The letters addressed the lack of \n27  adequate staffing, facility maintenance concerns, the lack of emergency signals in the \n28  laundry rooms, common room doors that are difficult to open, and the high price of meals \n  26  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 28 of 110\n \n1  for visitors.  The executive director at the Scotts Valley facility responded to one of the \n2  letters orally, but BROOKDALE has not responded in writing to any of the above-\n3  mentioned letters, in violation of Cal. H&S Code§ 1569.157(c) and (g) . \n4  Brookdale Misrepresents, Makes Misleading Statements, and Conceals Material \nFacts About the Quality and Availability of Care It Provides to All Residents \n5   \n6  67.  As a result of Defendants’ corporate policies and practices, BROOKDALE \n7  subjects all residents, regardless of disability, to a substantial risk that they will not receive \n8  the care and services they require and have paid for on any given day, as described in \n9  Paragraphs 36-60.  BROOKDALE lures residents to move into or stay at its facilities by \n10  misrepresenting in various corporate written materials that it will provide the basic, \n11  personal, and therapeutic services each resident needs based on individualized assessments \n12  performed by BROOKDALE staff, and by failing to disclose and concealing that it cannot \n13  provide the promised services to all residents because its facilities are chronically \n14  understaffed. \n15  Standardized Residency Agreements \n16  68.  In order to move in to one of BROOKDALE’s California facilities, residents \n17  must sign one of Defendants’ standardized Residency Agreements.  In its standardized \n18  Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE represents to residents prior to move-in and \n19  throughout their residency that it will provide them with a standard set of basic services, \n20  additional personal services identified in the Personal Service Plan, and any select and \n21  therapeutic services for which the resident chooses to pay.  At the time of signing the \n22  Residency Agreement, residents or their responsible parties are required to confirm that \n23  they have reviewed and understand the document. \n24  69.  In Section I.A of its standardized Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE \n25  affirmatively represents to prospective residents that “[i]n order to provide you with care, \n26  supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet your \n27  needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services”: accommodations, \n28  including a residential suite and use of common areas; three meals a day plus snacks 24 \n  27  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 29 of 110\n \n1  hours a day; basic utilities; “light housekeeping once a week”; weekly laundry service of \n2  the resident’s “personal belongings and bed linens”; “planned social and recreational \n3  programs”; transportation services; and staffing by “Community associates … available 24 \n4  hours a day, seven days a week.”  Section I.A further represents that BROOKDALE will \n5  observe the resident’s “health status to identify social and health care needs” and “will \n6  consult with you regarding social and health-related issues.”  In addition, BROOKDALE \n7  represents in Section I.A of its standardized Residency Agreement that “[w]e will provide \n8  personal services that are included as part of the personal service assessment.” \n9  70.  In Section I.B of its standardized Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE \n10  represents that “[p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will \n11  use a personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  The \n12  personal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal Service Plan.”   \n13  71.  Defendants’ standardized price schedule for personal care services is \n14  attached to the standardized Residency Agreement.  This price schedule includes a variety \n15  of personal services, such as staff assistance with ordering, storing, and taking medication; \n16  staff assistance with eating, dressing, bathing, using the toilet, and other activities of daily \n17  living; escort and mobility assistance to get around Defendants’ facilities; and help taking \n18  care of residents’ pets.  This price schedule lists the monthly costs of each service and \n19  details how Defendants’ caregivers and other staff will provide the services.  For instance, \n20  a resident may require and agree to pay for “[s]taff attention while you administer your \n21  insulin injections”; “additional staff involvement” for residents who are reluctant to accept \n22  care; and bathroom assistance such as “reminders to get to the bathroom,” “pulling up and \n23  down pants, handling toilet paper, wiping, changing protective undergarments and getting \n24  onto and off of toilet,” as well as “weight-bearing or balance assistance from one \n25  associate” for residents “unable to stand independently while using the bathroom.” \n26  72.  BROOKDALE repeats these representations in the Personal Service Plan \n27  that it prepares for each resident before the resident moves in and updates periodically \n28  throughout his or her residency.  The Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff \n  28  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 30 of 110\n \n1  assistance that the resident requires and has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee \n2  for each.  For example, the Personal Service Plan for one former resident states that \n3  Defendants’ staff will “[p]rovide physical assistance to and from the dining room and/or \n4  community activities as needed” for a monthly fee of $273.  Standardized language in the \n5  Personal Service Plan states that “[t]he Personal Service Assessment and the Physician \n6  Plan of Care are used to determine the personal services that you require at move-in and \n7  periodically throughout your residency.  The Personal Service Assessment will be used to \n8  develop your Personal Service Plan.” \n9  73.  Pursuant to Sections I.B and III.F of its standardized Residency Agreement, \n10  “[t]he results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your personal care needs, and \n11  the cost of providing the additional personal services (the ‘Personal Service Rate’) will be \n12  shared with you,” and a change in the Personal Service Plan be offered or required “when \n13  we determine additional services are requested or required” and after 60 days’ written \n14  notice has been provided. \n15  74.  In Section I.C of its standardized Residency Agreement, BROOKDALE \n16  represents that it will make “Select Services and Therapeutic Services … available to you \n17  at your request,” but that the fees for these services are not included in the rates residents \n18  pay for basic services and personal services.  Defendants’ standardized Residency \n19  Agreement incorporates by reference a standardized price list which features prices for the \n20  select and therapeutic services that Defendants make available, many of which consist of \n21  staff assistance with the resident’s activities of daily living.  For example, residents may \n22  elect to pay for tray service in their rooms for up to three meals a day or for additional \n23  laundry and housekeeping services beyond what is provided in the basic service rate. \n24  75.  Every month, BROOKDALE sends each resident or his or her responsible \n25  party an invoice for services that the company represents it will provide the following \n26  month.  These invoices list the monthly rate for basic services, the Personal Service Rate \n27  that is based on each resident’s Personal Service Plan, and any rate adjustments. \n28  76.  BROOKDALE repeats these representations in the letters it periodically \n  29  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 31 of 110\n \n1  sends all residents informing them of increases in the rates they owe for basic services, \n2  personal services, and select and therapeutic services.  Using standardized language, \n3  Defendants’ rate increase letters notify the resident of changes to his or her monthly rates \n4  for these services, which BROOKDALE attributes to increases in the cost of “providing \n5  the services you desire and depend upon.” \n6  Defendants’ Communications Regarding the Merger and New Assessment System \n7  77.  In early 2014, Emeritus Senior Living (“Emeritus”), at the time a major \n8  chain of senior living facilities, sent residents a standardized letter informing them of the \n9  merger between BROOKDALE and Emeritus.  The letter promised that residents would \n10  not be impacted by the change but would “receive the same excellent care and service you \n11  expect at your community” and would “continue to enjoy all the amenities of your \n12  community.”  It further stated the merger would create a “senior living company offering \n13  the most comprehensive set of senior care solutions” with a commitment to “customer-\n14  focused cultures and a commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.”  Rather \n15  than inform residents that the merger would result in even lower staffing levels and poorly \n16  trained staff, the letter promised a continuum of care with likely improvements. \n17  78.  In or about October 2015, BROOKDALE sent residents a standardized letter \n18  informing them of an upgrade to its community assessment and care planning system \n19  effective December 1, 2015.  The upgrade would involve a conversion to a “new personal \n20  service system” which would “enhance our ability to match your needs and preferences \n21  with the right services at the right time.”  The letter promised “benefits from \n22  enhancements,” which included, inter alia, “[p]ersonalized service planning and care \n23  systems.” \n24  79.  Based on these representations, Plaintiffs, and the putative class members \n25  reasonably expected that the merger would result in improvements in care, or at the very \n26  least, would not result in a decline in services.  Additionally, they reasonably expected that \n27  the conversion to the new assessment and care planning system would result in improved \n28  delivery of basic services, personal services, and select and therapeutic services for which \n  30  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 32 of 110\n \n1  they were paying. \n2  Defendants’ Marketing Materials \n3  80.  Defendants’ public website, www.brookdale.com, prominently features \n4  online marketing materials directed at prospective residents.  In a section of its website \n5  entitled “What is Assisted Living?”, BROOKDALE claims that its “assisted living \n6  communities have staff and programs in place that support and assist residents with daily \n7  living and basic care in a homelike or apartment setting.  Residents receive three meals a \n8  day, recreational and social activities, housekeeping, linen service, apartment maintenance \n9  and transportation.  That means your loved one gets all the benefits of retired life, without \n10  the hassle of daily chores.” \n11  81.  Defendants’ online marketing materials also tout the personalized services \n12  that its assisted living facilities provide.  The company’s website explains that “[o]ur \n13  trained caregivers provide attention and assistance with medication support, bathing, \n14  dressing, cooking and other tasks throughout the day.  Our staff will also coordinate \n15  services with outside healthcare providers and monitor residents to ensure they are healthy.  \n16  So your loved one gets the care they need while enjoying the quality of life they’ve \n17  earned.” \n18  82.  Defendants’ online marketing materials promise a “Culinary Arts” program \n19  that uses “only the freshest meat, seafood, produce, herbs and spices.” \n20  83.  Defendants’ online marketing materials further represent that “[a]t \n21  Brookdale, we believe in delivering senior care that’s tailored to you and your loved one \n22  based on those unique needs and desires.  That’s why we provide a variety of options.  \n23  This personalized approach ensures that you and your family get exactly what you need \n24  without paying for what you don’t.” \n25  84.  BROOKDALE represents to prospective and current residents that it tailors \n26  its services to residents’ personal needs.  According to Defendants’ representations, the \n27  process begins with an individualized assessment, which BROOKDALE uses to produce a \n28  Personal Service Plan for each resident.  The Personal Service Plan includes a list of \n  31  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 33 of 110\n \n1  services for which the resident pays a monthly fee.  Defendants’ affirmative \n2  representations give rise to a reasonable expectation on the part of the reasonable \n3  consumer that BROOKDALE will determine and then provide the amount of caregiver and \n4  other staff time that is necessary to provide the personal services for which residents are \n5  paying. \n6  85.  BROOKDALE makes similar representations in the standardized marketing \n7  folder it distributes to prospective and incoming residents.  In this marketing folder, \n8  BROOKDALE represents that at its facilities, “Carefully selected and trained associates do \n9  more than assist with activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing and dispensing of \n10  medications; they implement custom care plans designed to meet the individual needs of \n11  each resident … It all begins with a Personal Service Assessment.  We take the time to \n12  listen to our residents so that we understand how to establish clinical, dining and program \n13  support that works for them in a meaningful way.  We recognize their individual needs and \n14  preferences and respond to them accordingly.  So, whether it’s a scented lotion, a unique \n15  snack, a favorite recipe or a lifelong interest, we integrate everything we learn to create a \n16  truly individualized living experience.”  Elsewhere in this marketing folder, \n17  BROOKDALE represents that it “provide[s] customized care solutions to meet residents’ \n18  unique needs and complement their vision for all the places they would still like their lives \n19  to go.  From our trained staff to our wide variety of amenities and activities, we strive to \n20  offer personalized care and exceptional service at competitive and affordable rates.  Fees \n21  for care and services are based on each resident’s needs and preferences, as determined by \n22  the Living Accommodation selected and their Personal Service Plan … This provides \n23  customer value because our residents only pay for what they need and want.” \n24  (Emphasis in original).  BROOKDALE’s marketing folder also promises an industry-\n25  leading dining services program that “continue[s] to satisfy the preferences and nutritional \n26  needs of residents with dining choices that offer mealtime fulfillment while meeting \n27  dietary requirements.” \n28  86.  Based on all of Defendants’ representations, Plaintiffs, the putative class \n  32  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 34 of 110\n \n1  members, and the general consuming public reasonably expect that BROOKDALE will \n2  ensure adequate staffing to perform the services promised to residents, including by \n3  providing sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained staff to perform the services \n4  identified in each resident’s Personal Service Plan. \n5  Defendants’ Failures to Disclose \n6  87.  Contrary to Defendants’ representations regarding its provision of services, \n7  BROOKDALE has a corporate policy and practice of staffing its facilities according to a \n8  system that ensures all BROOKDALE residents run the continuing risk of not receiving \n9  the services for which they are paying, of not having their care needs met, and of suffering \n10  injury from the lack of care. \n11  88.  In addition to the Community Care Licensing records described in \n12  Paragraphs 38-39, 42-44, 47-50 and 53, current and former residents of BROOKDALE \n13  facilities confirm that Defendants’ staffing levels do not change when updates to personal \n14  service assessments show that residents require additional personal services.  \n15  BROOKDALE has in many cases modified residents’ Personal Service Plans—and raised \n16  monthly personal service fees accordingly—even though BROOKDALE failed to conduct \n17  an updated personal service assessment, failed to provide residents or their responsible \n18  parties with the results and method of the assessment, and/or failed to provide 60 days’ \n19  written notice.  Despite paying higher fees as a result of these changes to their Personal \n20  Service Plans, residents and their families have observed that neither the services provided \n21  nor staffing levels increased and, in many cases, decreased. \n22  89.  Caregivers have informed residents that they would like to work a 40-hour \n23  week, but BROOKDALE allows certain caregivers to work only 24 hours in a week.  \n24  Residents and their family members have also observed that BROOKDALE fails to ensure \n25  that all staff members receive necessary training.  At BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, the \n26  facility’s interim executive director admitted to residents’ families that BROOKDALE has \n27  insufficient staff to meet residents’ needs. \n28 \n  33  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 35 of 110\n \n1  Brookdale’s Misrepresentations and Concealed Facts Were Material \n2  90.  BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations and the facts it conceals are material to \n3  the reasonable consumer.  An important and significant factor in choosing to move oneself \n4  or one’s relative to a BROOKDALE facility, to stay there after the facility was purchased \n5  by BROOKDALE, and/or to continue to agree to pay the amounts charged by \n6  BROOKDALE is the provision of staffing that is necessary to provide the services its \n7  residents need and for which the residents are paying. \n8  91.  BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements and omissions \n9  regarding its provision of staffing are material to prospective residents and their family \n10  members.  Assurances that a facility will provide the amount of staffing necessary to \n11  provide basic services and meet the personal service needs of residents based on \n12  BROOKDALE’s own assessments is a substantial factor (and indeed often the most \n13  important factor) in deciding to enter a certain facility.  The named Plaintiffs would not \n14  have, and the members of the putative class would in all reasonable probability not have, \n15  entered BROOKDALE’s facilities or stayed at these facilities after BROOKDALE \n16  purchased them from other companies, or they would have insisted on paying a lower \n17  price, if they had known that, although BROOKDALE would charge them based on the \n18  staffing associated with their Personal Service Plans, BROOKDALE did not and does not \n19  provide adequate staffing to carry out the services identified in residents’ Personal Service \n20  Plans, nor does it provide adequate staffing to perform basic services and select and \n21  therapeutic services. \n22  92.  This is true even for residents who currently are nearly independent.  These \n23  residents chose an assisted living facility as opposed to an independent living community \n24  or remaining at home because they wish to “age in place.”  They may not need significant \n25  assistance with the activities of daily living initially, but they will become more dependent \n26  as they age and do not want to move again when that happens.  Moreover, even the most \n27  independent residents depend on the basic services that BROOKDALE promised them, \n28  such as food, laundry, and housekeeping.  A key factor for these residents in selecting \n  34  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 36 of 110\n \n1  BROOKDALE is that the facility will provide the staffing that BROOKDALE itself has \n2  determined is necessary to meet their assessed needs, both now and as those needs \n3  increase. \n4  93.  BROOKDALE has a duty to disclose that its staffing policies and procedures \n5  preclude it from consistently providing basic services, personal services, and select and \n6  therapeutic services, because of, among other things, the substantial safety risk to current \n7  and future residents from BROOKDALE’s conduct. \n8  94.  The non-disclosure is material because, among other things, BROOKDALE \n9  knows that its conduct risks the safety of its residents.  In addition to individual complaints \n10  made by residents and family members, family and resident councils send regular \n11  correspondence to Executive Directors of BROOKDALE facilities, as well as regional and \n12  national mangers regarding the problems outlined above.  In the case of BROOKDALE \n13  San Ramon and BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, local and regional management employees \n14  have attended numerous meetings of the Family and Resident Councils and have made \n15  unfulfilled promises to address the concerns outlined above.  Moreover, Community Care \n16  Licensing has conducted numerous licensing inspections which are delivered to \n17  BROOKDALE executives and managers of California facilities, describing the failure of \n18  various facilities to meet state laws and regulations. \n19  95.  BROOKDALE is fully aware of the facts alleged above.  Yet, \n20  BROOKDALE has failed to disclose and actively concealed from residents, prospective \n21  residents and their family members the true facts about how staffing is provided at \n22  BROOKDALE’s California facilities. \n23  Barriers to Moving Out \n24  96.  BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements, and material \n25  omissions affect not only the decision of residents to enter the facility but also the decision \n26  to stay at a BROOKDALE facility. \n27  97.  In choosing assisted living in general and a BROOKDALE facility in \n28  particular, the resident forgoes other options such as their former home, an independent \n  35  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 37 of 110\n \n1  living community, or other facilities.  Once in a facility, there are significant physical, \n2  emotional and other burdens for the residents that are triggered if they terminate residency, \n3  including impacts such as “transfer trauma.”  BROOKDALE knows and relies on this fact.  \n4  As BROOKDALE notes on its website “[a]s a resident’s health needs increase, they may \n5  transition from one level to the next—all within the same community.  This provides a \n6  permanent link to friends and families for them by assuring they remain in a single \n7  location.” \n8  98.  BROOKDALE puts great effort into increasing and maintaining building \n9  occupancy to the detriment of their current and future residents.  Plaintiffs allege on \n10  information and belief that when residents or their family members complain about \n11  staffing and/or conditions at a BROOKDALE facility, employees are instructed to reassure \n12  them that things will improve and that the incident or incidents are temporary snags.  For \n13  example, the Family Council of BROOKDALE Fountaingrove was meeting every month \n14  for many months to address the inadequate staffing, slow response times to call buttons, \n15  and other health and safety issues faced by the Fountaingrove residents.  BROOKDALE \n16  representatives, including Vice President of Regional Operations Sharyl Ronan and \n17  Interim Executive Director Dan Devine, appeared at many meetings, listened to the \n18  numerous complaints, and assured those present that they are looking into the problems \n19  and all will be well.  Notwithstanding these claims, members of the Family Council report \n20  little to no changes or action items undertaken by BROOKDALE staff after these \n21  meetings. \n22  99.  Similarly, residents and family members at BROOKDALE San Ramon hold \n23  monthly Family Council and Resident Council meetings and have informed facility \n24  management, as well as Rick Flynn, District Director of Operations, former Executive \n25  Director Steve Millard, Executive Director Shawn Cull, and former Acting Director Bill \n26  Grady of the problems described above.  In January 2017, Mr. Flynn, Mr. Grady and \n27  Mr. Cull attended a Family Council meeting at which family members and residents \n28  demanded answers to their questions about understaffing, poorly trained staff, undelivered \n  36  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 38 of 110\n \n1  services, food and dining deficiencies, cancelled activities, and problems with call \n2  pendants.  They were reassured at the meeting and subsequently told by email \n3  correspondence that BROOKDALE was working “diligently” on solutions and had \n4  reached out to the District Vice President of Operations Sheila Garner, who would be \n5  helping to resolve the problems.  BROOKDALE also represented that management had \n6  “made progress in our hiring process for clinical and dining,” and was monitoring the call \n7  pendant system and providing additional training to staff.  Since that time, BROOKDALE \n8  announced the hiring of additional employees but concealed from residents that it was \n9  simultaneously cutting the hours of its current employees, cuts which have led to \n10  significant staff turnover.  Residents and family members report that the problems \n11  described above have in fact worsened. \n12  100.  Such reassurances from BROOKDALE are common when residents and \n13  family members raise concerns about the quality of care and services they are receiving.  \n14  On information and belief, Regional Vice Presidents and Executive Directors are \n15  instructed to minimize potential move-outs.  Executive Directors are regularly told by \n16  upper management to do everything they can to “save” the move-out. \n17  101.  BROOKDALE thereby unjustly continues to profit from the original fraud \n18  by perpetuating the misrepresentations, misleading statements, and failures to disclose. \n19  Named Plaintiffs’ Experiences in Brookdale Facilities \n20  Stacia Stiner \n21  102.  STACIA STINER has been a resident at BROOKDALE San Ramon since \n22  approximately February 13, 2016.  On or about February 12, 2016, STACIA STINER’s \n23  mother, Rita Stiner, read, reviewed, and signed an agreement with BROOKDALE as \n24  STACIA STINER’s legal representative and power of attorney.  As part of this \n25  “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT”, BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to provide you with \n26  care, supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet \n27  your needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, which are included in \n28  the Basic Service Rate,” which included, among other things, the room, three daily meals \n  37  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 39 of 110\n \n1  and snacks on demand, weekly room cleaning, weekly laundry and linen service, planned \n2  activities, transportation, observation, and the availability of staff “24 hours a day, seven \n3  days a week.”  This standard residency agreement also stated that: \n4  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use \na personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  \n5  The personal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal \nService Plan.  The results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your \n6  personal care needs, and the cost of providing the additional personal \nservices (the “Personal Service Rate”) will be shared with you. \n7   \n8  The Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff assistance that Ms. STINER requires and \n9  has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of staff assistance.  In \n10  addition, Ms. STINER’s mother Rita Stiner has received and reviewed, as enclosures to \n11  BROOKDALE’s rate increase letters, a personal service schedule and list of select and \n12  therapeutic services.  These documents describe a variety of available services, list the \n13  monthly or per-occurrence fee for each service, and detail how BROOKDALE’s \n14  caregivers or other staff will provide the service.  Every month, BROOKDALE sends \n15  Ms. STINER, through Rita Stiner, an invoice for services that the company impliedly \n16  represents it will provide in the following month.  These invoices list the monthly rate for \n17  the basic services set forth in BROOKDALE’s standardized residency agreements, the \n18  Personal Service Rate that is based on Ms. STINER’s Personal Service Plan, and any rate \n19  adjustments. \n20  103.  Ms. STINER, through her legal representative and power of attorney, Rita \n21  Stiner, read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations as statements that \n22  BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services and staff \n23  BROOKDALE San Ramon in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the \n24  services that BROOKDALE promised and Ms. STINER was paying for.  Ms. STINER, \n25  through Rita Stiner, relied on these representations in making the decision to enter \n26  BROOKDALE San Ramon.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to STACIA or Rita STINER \n27  at any time prior to her admission nor has it disclosed since that time that its corporate \n28  policy and procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes \n  38  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 40 of 110\n \n1  BROOKDALE from providing the care and services residents have been promised and \n2  places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they \n3  have paid for on any given day.  If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to \n4  STACIA and/or Rita STINER prior to or early in Ms. STINER’s residency, RITA \n5  STINER would have looked for another facility for STACIA or would have told \n6  BROOKDALE that her daughter would not agree to pay the rates charged by \n7  BROOKDALE.   \n8  104.  Beginning in October 2016, BROOKDALE initiated increases in \n9  Ms. STINER’s basic service and personal service rates.  Ms. STINER and her mother Rita \n10  Stiner have been unable to decipher the changes in Ms. STINER’s bills.  On or about \n11  October of 24, 2016, Rita Stiner received a letter from BROOKDALE’s Executive \n12  Director informing her that Ms. STINER’s basic service rate would increase from $3,205 \n13  to $3,429 per month and that her personal service rate would increase by approximately \n14  6%.  During an in-person meeting in January of 2017, BROOKDALE staff told Rita Stiner \n15  that Ms. STINER’s personal service rates would rise as follows: the monthly medication \n16  management fee would rise from $567 to $631; the monthly fee for staff assistance with \n17  dressing and grooming tasks would rise from $454 to $505; the monthly fee for assistance \n18  with two showers per week would rise from $113 to $631 per week (a significant increase \n19  because STACIA STINER was purportedly requiring more than the allotted 20 minutes of \n20  caregiver time per shower); and the monthly fee for assistance with toileting would \n21  increase from $397 to $442.  Rita Stiner had conversations with Shawn Cull, the acting \n22  Executive Director, during which he told her that BROOKDALE would not charge the full \n23  amount of the increases listed above.  Despite numerous communications with Mr. Cull \n24  and the billing department, the monthly bills remain confusing and BROOKDALE has \n25  sent Rita Stiner notices of late payment and even a “30-DAY FINAL DEMAND TO PAY” \n26  in December 2016, stating that “[i]n order to provide the care our residents expect and \n27  deserve and at the same time support the professional staff we employ, it’s imperative that \n28  we receive our monthly rent and any additional charges in a timely fashion.”  Brookdale \n  39  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 41 of 110\n \n1  subsequently withdrew the demand, but the bills remain confusing, and every time there is \n2  an increase in Ms. STINER’s monthly rates, the rate on Ms. STINER’s bills does not \n3  correspond to the information given to her or her mother by Mr. Cull about the increase. \n4  105.  Although Ms. STINER is a wheelchair user, BROOKDALE has not \n5  provided her with a room that has any physical access features.  It does not have sufficient \n6  turning space in the bathroom area, making it difficult for Ms. STINER to enter the \n7  bathroom in her wheelchair and impossible for Ms. STINER to turn around in the \n8  bathroom.  The bathroom does not have a roll-in shower, and the grab bars do not comply \n9  with applicable access standards, preventing her from bathing independently and creating a \n10  serious safety hazard.  Ms. STINER cannot reach most of the hanging or the storage space \n11  in her closet and therefore cannot access her clothing or other personal items without \n12  assistance from others.  Ms. STINER’s room has a balcony, but a two-inch lip leading out \n13  to the balcony and insufficient turning space once outside makes it inaccessible to \n14  Ms. STINER.  She once tried to enter and exit the balcony by herself, but has not \n15  attempted to do so since because the experience scared her.  The complete lack of \n16  accessible features in Ms. STINER’s room prevents her from being as independent as \n17  possible and causes her to rely on personal assistance from BROOKDALE staff.  In fact, \n18  Ms. STINER is charged more than $400 per month for toilet assistance because “resident \n19  is unable to use the bathroom on their own.”  BROOKDALE charges Ms. STINER an \n20  elevated rate of over $600 for two showers per week because, according to BROOKDALE \n21  management, she requires more than the allotted 20 minutes per shower.  Compounding \n22  this problem is BROOKDALE’s understaffing in care services, which means that \n23  Ms. STINER must wait to accomplish most of her activities of daily living, if at all.  This \n24  puts Ms. STINER in humiliating, frustrating and hazardous situations on a daily basis. \n25  106.  Despite STACIA STINER’s paying approximately $600 per month for \n26  BROOKDALE to “order and coordinate medications between family, health care \n27  providers and pharmacy,” Rita Stiner must pick up medication for her daughter at least \n28  once per week, frequently with only one-day notice from BROOKDALE.  Rita Stiner also \n  40  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 42 of 110\n \n1  does the majority of her daughter’s laundry because BROOKDALE frequently loses her \n2  clothing or returns the wrong clothing to her. \n3  107.  Understaffing in the dining services department means that Ms. STINER has \n4  had to wait up to 45 minutes just to order breakfast.   \n5  108.  On some days, there is only one caregiver available in the mornings, causing \n6  Ms. STINER to wait anywhere from 10 minutes to one hour for assistance getting dressed.  \n7  At night, Ms. STINER requires assistance if she needs to use the toilet.  She waits \n8  anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour for staff to respond and will occasionally have to \n9  urinate in her bed when assistance takes too long to arrive.  She frequently resorts to using \n10  her mobile phone to call the outside line when staff do not respond to her call pendant.  \n11  Due to short-staffing, caregivers often attempt to leave Ms. STINER in the middle of \n12  assisting her with bathing or toileting because they must respond to call pendants from \n13  other residents or because they left another resident on the commode to respond to Ms. \n14  STINER.  Ms. STINER objects and insists that the caregivers finish assisting her before \n15  they leave, but she knows that other residents are too afraid to speak up for themselves and \n16  are often stranded by caregivers. \n17  109.  Ms. STINER enjoys getting out of the facility and participating in off-site \n18  activities.  However, BROOKDALE requires that, because she is a wheelchair user, she be \n19  accompanied by a family member or a private personal caregiver.  Although she has been \n20  able to participate in scenic drives or lunches by herself, Ms. STINER had to pay \n21  approximately $180 for a personal assistant to participate in a trip to a casino in Cache \n22  Creek in approximately August 2016.  Ms. STINER enjoys outings to the casino, but \n23  BROOKDALE still requires that she take her mother or a private caregiver on those trips.    \n24  Outings are also limited to two wheelchair users per outing on a first come, first served \n25  basis.  If Ms. STINER does not sign up immediately, she will lose her ability to participate \n26  on a particular outing.  This is true of other wheelchair users in the facility. \n27  110.  In case of fire and other emergencies, BROOKDALE staff has told \n28  Ms. STINER to remain in her room until they come and get her.  However, staff members \n  41  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 43 of 110\n \n1  have not come to get Ms. STINER when fire alarms go off at the facility, nor have they \n2  given her any additional instructions about how they would assist her in exiting the \n3  facility. \n4  Helen Carlson \n5  111.  HELEN CARLSON was a resident at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove from \n6  October 2011 until her death on January 19, 2019.  When Ms. CARLSON moved into the \n7  facility, it was owned and operated by Emeritus and was known as Emeritus at Santa Rosa.  \n8  Prior to move-in, CARLSON’s daughter-in-law JOAN CARLSON, acting as \n9  Ms. CARLSON’s legal representative and power of attorney, read, reviewed, and signed a \n10  standardized residency agreement with Emeritus.  In this agreement, Emeritus promised to \n11  provide a list of “core services” that are substantially similar to the basic services \n12  enumerated in Defendants’ standardized residency agreement.  Emeritus also agreed to \n13  “perform a comprehensive Resident Evaluation prior to your admission in the Community, \n14  regularly thereafter, and as your condition warrants, in order to determine the level of \n15  Personal Care Services that you need.  We will develop your Service Plan, based on your \n16  Resident Evaluation, that describes how we will provide these services.  You will receive \n17  services appropriate to your individual needs, as described in your Service Plan.”  The \n18  agreement reserved Emeritus’s right to assign the agreement to any successor-in-interest \n19  selected by Emeritus. \n20  112.  Ms. CARLSON, through her legal representative and power of attorney \n21  JOAN CARLSON, read and reasonably understood Emeritus’s representations in the \n22  residency agreement as statements that Emeritus used its resident assessment system and \n23  results generated by it to determine and provide staffing levels necessary to meet residents’ \n24  needs.  Ms. CARLSON also reasonably understood and expected that Emeritus would staff \n25  Emeritus at Santa Rosa in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services \n26  that Emeritus promised and Ms. CARLSON would be paying for.  Ms. CARLSON, \n27  through JOAN CARLSON, read and relied on the representations in the residency \n28  agreement in making the decision to enter Emeritus at Santa Rosa.  As Ms. CARLSON’s \n  42  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 44 of 110\n \n1  legal representative and power of attorney, JOAN CARLSON read and signed the \n2  agreement acknowledging that she understood and agreed to all of the terms contained in \n3  the agreement.  In or about February 2014, JOAN CARLSON received and read a letter \n4  from Emeritus informing residents about the merger between BROOKDALE and \n5  Emeritus.  The letter promised that residents would not be impacted by the change but \n6  would “receive the same excellent care and service you expect at your community” and \n7  would “continue to enjoy all the amenities of your community.”  It further stated the \n8  merger would create a “senior living company offering the most comprehensive set of \n9  senior care solutions” with a commitment to “consumer-focused cultures and a \n10  commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.” \n11  113.  JOAN CARLSON, as her mother-in-law’s power of attorney and legal \n12  representative, read the letter and reasonably understood that the care her mother-in-law \n13  received would be no worse than the care she had received under Emeritus, and possibly \n14  improve.  BROOKDALE did not inform JOAN or HELEN CARLSON nor did they have \n15  any reason to believe that BROOKDALE would not staff the facility with sufficient staff \n16  in numbers and training to provide the services for which Ms. CARLSON and the other \n17  residents were paying.   \n18  114.  In 2015, BROOKDALE merged with Emeritus, and Emeritus at Santa Rosa \n19  became BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that \n20  basis allege, that Emeritus assigned its residency agreements with existing residents to \n21  BROOKDALE, and that BROOKDALE assumed any liability arising from those \n22  agreements. \n23  115.  On November 17, 2015, JOAN CARLSON read, reviewed, and signed an \n24  agreement with BROOKDALE as Ms. CARLSON’s legal representative and power of \n25  attorney.  This agreement, entitled “AMENDMENT TO CONTINUING CARE \n26  RESIDENCE AND SERVICES AGREEMENT,” amended the residency agreement that \n27  Ms. CARLSON signed with Emeritus and that was assigned to BROOKDALE after the \n28  merger with Emeritus.  Pursuant to this amendment, references to “core services” and \n  43  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 45 of 110\n \n1  “personal care services” were replaced with the terms “basic services” and “personal \n2  services,” and Emeritus’s price schedules for various services were replaced with \n3  BROOKDALE’s standardized personal services price schedule and lists of select and \n4  therapeutic services.  The parties agreed that except as otherwise amended, the terms of the \n5  prior residency agreement would remain in full force and effect. \n6  116.  BROOKDALE has also prepared and periodically updated a Personal \n7  Service Plan for Ms. CARLSON.  Ms. CARLSON’s Personal Service Plan lists the type of \n8  staff assistance that Ms. CARLSON requires and has agreed to pay for, along with the \n9  monthly fee for each type of staff assistance.  In addition, Ms. CARLSON has received \n10  and reviewed as enclosures to BROOKDALE’s rate increase letters a personal service \n11  price schedule and list of select and therapeutic services.  These documents describe a \n12  variety of available services, list the monthly or per-occurrence fee for each service, and \n13  detail how BROOKDALE’s caregivers or other staff will provide the service.  Every \n14  month, BROOKDALE sends Ms. CARLSON, through JOAN CARLSON, an invoice for \n15  services that the company impliedly represents it will provide in the following month.  \n16  These invoices list the monthly rate for the basic services set forth in BROOKDALE’s \n17  standardized residency agreements, the Personal Service Rate that is based on \n18  Ms. CARLSON’s Personal Service Plan, and any rate adjustments. \n19  117.  Ms. CARLSON, through her legal representative and power of attorney \n20  JOAN CARLSON, read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations—as \n21  well as Emeritus’s representations in the agreement that was assigned to BROOKDALE \n22  and expressly incorporated into BROOKDALE’s November 17, 2015 agreement with \n23  Ms. CARLSON—as statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to \n24  determine needed services and staff BROOKDALE Fountaingrove in a manner that would \n25  allow it to consistently provide the services that BROOKDALE promised and that \n26  Ms. CARLSON was paying for.  Ms. CARLSON, through JOAN CARLSON, read and \n27  relied on these representations in making the decision to stay at the facility despite the \n28  change in ownership. \n  44  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 46 of 110\n \n1  118.  In December 2017, BROOKDALE told JOAN CARLSON that Ms. \n2  CARLSON would need to move into the memory care section of BROOKDALE \n3  Fountaingrove.  When Ms. CARLSON moved, BROOKDALE presented JOAN \n4  CARLSON with a new RESIDENCY AGREEMENT.  On or about December 18, 2017, \n5  JOAN CARLSON read, reviewed, and signed an agreement with BROOKDALE as Ms. \n6  CARLSON’s legal representative and power of attorney.  As part of this RESIDENCY \n7  AGREEMENT, BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to provide you with care, \n8  supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet your \n9  needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, which are included in the \n10  Basic Service Rate,” which included, among other things, the room, three daily meals and \n11  snacks on demand, weekly room cleaning, weekly laundry and linen service, planned \n12  activities, transportation, observation, and the availability of staff “24 hours a day, seven \n13  days a week.”  This standard residency agreement also stated that: \n14  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use \na personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  \n15  The personal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal \nService Plan.  The results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your \n16  personal care needs, and the cost of providing the additional personal \nservices (the “Personal Service Rate”) will be shared with you. \n17   \n18  The Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff assistance that Ms. CARLSON requires \n19  and has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of staff assistance.  In \n20  addition, JOAN CARLSON has received and reviewed, as enclosures to BROOKDALE’s \n21  rate increase letters, a personal service schedule and list of select and therapeutic services.  \n22  These documents describe a variety of available services, list the monthly or per-\n23  occurrence fee for each service, and detail how BROOKDALE’s caregivers or other staff \n24  will provide the service.   \n25  119.  Ms. CARLSON, through her legal representative and power of attorney, \n26  JOAN CARLSON, read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s representations as \n27  statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services \n28  and staff BROOKDALE Fountaingrove in a manner that would allow it to consistently \n  45  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 47 of 110\n \n1  provide the services and supervision that BROOKDALE promised she would receive in \n2  their memory care unit and for which Ms. CARLSON was paying.  Ms. CARLSON, \n3  through JOAN CARLSON, relied on these representations in making the decision to move \n4  into the memory care unit of BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  BROOKDALE has never \n5  disclosed to Ms. CARLSON or JOAN CARLSON that its corporate policy and procedure \n6  of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from \n7  providing the supervision, care and services residents have been promised and places all \n8  residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid \n9  for on any given day.   \n10  120.  Until her death in January 2019, BROOKDALE charged Ms. CARLSON a \n11  Basic Service Rate of $5,290 per month, plus a Personal Service Rate of $4,173 per month \n12  and a Select and Therapeutic Services rate of $105 per month, minus a loyalty credit of \n13  $529 per month.  Ms. CARLSON’s Personal Service Rate included, among other things, a \n14  $580 monthly fee for staff assistance with ordering, storing, and taking medications; a \n15  $811 monthly fee for staff assistance with dressing and grooming; a $637 monthly fee for \n16  assistance with her oxygen and respiratory equipment; a $1,507 monthly fee for help \n17  setting up, cleaning and assistance with nebulizer treatments; a $116 monthly fee for staff \n18  assistance with showering; a $927 monthly fee for staff assistance with using the \n19  bathroom; a $522 monthly fee for staff assistance with accomplishing and/or participating \n20  in daily routines due to memory loss or cognitive impairment; a $290 monthly fee for help \n21  going to and from the dining room and/or community activities; and a $290 monthly fee \n22  for “additional staff involvement because of demonstrating anxious, disruptive or \n23  obsessive behavior requiring additional attention.”  Ms. CARLSON also paid $100 per \n24  month for incontinence supplies, which BROOKDALE represents its staff will order and \n25  stock. \n26  121.  Beginning in early 2016, JOAN CARLSON and her husband Ralph Carlson \n27  began to observe a decline in the quality of care provided to Ms. CARLSON.  On one \n28  occasion, JOAN discovered that despite promising to fax certain paperwork to \n  46  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 48 of 110\n \n1  Ms. CARLSON’s primary care physician in advance of a scheduled appointment, \n2  BROOKDALE’s staff never did so.  In addition, JOAN and Ralph CARLSON stopped \n3  receiving phone calls to notify them of Ms. CARLSON’s injuries and other noteworthy \n4  incidents. \n5  122.  In June 2016, Ms. CARLSON was admitted to the hospital after falling while \n6  attempting to get out of bed.  BROOKDALE’s staff failed to call JOAN or Ralph \n7  CARLSON, even though they are listed as Ms. CARLSON’s emergency contacts.  As a \n8  result, Ms. CARLSON spent several hours in the emergency room without a family \n9  member present, and she was charged for ambulance transport back to BROOKDALE \n10  Fountaingrove because no family member was present to give her a ride. \n11  123.  In December 2016, Ms. CARLSON’s doctor took her off the blood thinner \n12  Coumadin.  Nonetheless, in January and February 2017, staff at BROOKDALE \n13  Fountaingrove continued to order and stock Coumadin for Ms. CARLSON.  \n14  BROOKDALE charged Ms. CARLSON a monthly fee for staff assistance with ordering \n15  and storing medications, even though BROOKDALE’s staff failed to adequately perform \n16  that service. \n17  124.  JOAN and Ralph CARLSON have also observed numerous failures by staff \n18  to assist Ms. CARLSON with using the bathroom, even though Ms. CARLSON paid a \n19  monthly fee for that service.  In addition, even though Ms. CARLSON paid a monthly fee \n20  for staff to order and stock incontinence products, she often ran out of such products \n21  because BROOKDALE’s staff do not check whether supplies are running low or if orders \n22  need to be adjusted. \n23  125.  Ms. CARLSON was unable to use the bathroom sink and kitchenette sink in \n24  her previous suite because they are installed at a height that makes them inaccessible for \n25  wheelchair users.  Ms. CARLSON required glasses to see and dentures to eat, but \n26  BROOKDALE staff frequently misplaced or lost these assistive devices. \n27  126.  JOAN and Ralph CARLSON complained to managers at BROOKDALE \n28  Fountaingrove about these problems on numerous occasions.  Although BROOKDALE \n  47  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 49 of 110\n \n1  management repeatedly reassured JOAN and Ralph CARLSON that BROOKDALE would \n2  address their concerns, they did not see any improvement when Ms. CARLSON resided in \n3  assisted living.  Since Ms. CARLSON has resided at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, \n4  BROOKDALE has never disclosed that its staffing policies and procedures preclude it \n5  from providing its residents all of the care and services they have been promised and \n6  places all residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the care and \n7  services they have paid for on any given day.  If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material \n8  fact to JOAN CARLSON early in Ms. CARLSON’s residency, she would have looked for \n9  another facility for Ms. CARLSON and would have told BROOKDALE that Ms. \n10  CARLSON would not agree to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE.   \n11  127.  In December 2017, BROOKDALE told JOAN and Ralph CARLSON that \n12  HELEN CARLSON needed to move to memory care, and that she would receive \n13  additional supervision and care if she moved to the memory care unit and paid additional \n14  fees.  BROOKDALE told them that if they did not move Ms. CARLSON into memory \n15  care at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, Ms. CARLSON would have to move out of \n16  Fountaingrove entirely, and gave JOAN CARLSON only a little over a week to \n17  decide.  Because of the short time frame, JOAN CARLSON was unable to investigate \n18  whether there were comparable facilities in the area that might have accepted Ms. \n19  CARLSON.  JOAN CARLSON ultimately felt she had no choice but to move Ms. \n20  CARLSON into the memory care unit at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  Her decision was \n21  based on BROOKDALE’s representations about additional supervision and care, her fear \n22  that Ms. CARLSON would suffer severe trauma if she were to be transferred to an entirely \n23  new facility, and the lack of time to investigate other options.  In the memory care unit, \n24  just as in assisted living, Ms. CARLSON was housed in a room with multiple inaccessible \n25  features, including a sink, toilet, and closet that are not wheelchair-accessible. \n26  Lawrence Quinlan \n27  128.  LAWRENCE QUINLAN stayed at the facility at BROOKDALE Hemet for \n28  short-term respite on several occasions between 2013 and 2015.  On approximately July \n  48  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 50 of 110\n \n1  14, 2015, he was admitted to BROOKDALE Hemet for a “respite stay” following a \n2  hospitalization and rehabilitation for a broken leg.  On July 10, 2015, BROOKDALE gave \n3  his granddaughter, LORESIA VALLETTE, a Residency Agreement for LAWRENCE \n4  QUINLAN.  Ms. VALLETTE read, reviewed, and signed the agreement with \n5  BROOKDALE on behalf of LAWRENCE QUINLAN.  BROOKDALE did not ask \n6  LAWRENCE QUINLAN whether he could sign the document or whether LORESIA \n7  VALLETTE held Power of Attorney for him.  BROOKDALE did not ask Ms. \n8  VALLETTE for documentation showing that she had the legal authority to sign the \n9  Residency Agreement on behalf of LAWRENCE QUINLAN.   \n10  129.  LAWRENCE QUINLAN left BROOKDALE Hemet for his home on or \n11  about September 5, 2015.  On September 13, 2015, he was re-admitted to BROOKDALE \n12  Hemet as a long-term resident.  Prior to LAWRENCE QUINLAN’s move-in, on or about \n13  September 13, 2015, BROOKDALE gave his son, Phillip Quinlan, a Residency \n14  Agreement for LAWRENCE QUINLAN.  Phillip Quinlan read, reviewed, and signed the \n15  agreement with BROOKDALE on behalf of LAWRENCE QUINLAN.  BROOKDALE \n16  did not ask LAWRENCE QUINLAN whether he could sign the document or whether \n17  Phillip Quinlan held Power of Attorney for him.  BROOKDALE did not ask Phillip \n18  Quinlan for documentation showing that he had the legal authority to sign the Residency \n19  Agreement on behalf of LAWRENCE QUINLAN.  In fact, on page 15 of the Residency \n20  Agreement, under his signature, Phillip Quinlan filled in the name and contact information \n21  of his niece and LAWRENCE QUINLAN’s granddaughter, LORESIA VALLETTE, under \n22  the section titled “LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE/RESPONSIBLE PARTY ADDRESS.”  \n23  In its Resident Information/Emergency Contact Sheet, BROOKDALE listed LORESIA \n24  VALLETTE as Mr. QUINLAN’s “Legally Responsible Party” for both “Financial” and \n25  “Health Care.” \n26  130.  As part of the “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT” provided first to Ms. \n27  VALLETTE and then to Phillip Quinlan, BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to provide \n28  you with care, supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in \n  49  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 51 of 110\n \n1  order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, which \n2  are included in the Basic Service Rate.”  These included, among other things, the room, \n3  three daily meals and snacks on demand, weekly room cleaning, weekly laundry and linen \n4  service, planned activities, transportation, observation, and the availability of staff “24 \n5  hours a day, seven days a week.”  This standard residency agreement also stated that: \n6  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use \na personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  \n7  The personal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal \nService Plan.  The results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your \n8  personal care needs, and the cost of providing the additional personal \nservices (the “Personal Service Rate”) will be shared with you. \n9   \n10  The Personal Service Plan listed the types of staff assistance that Mr. QUINLAN required \n11  and had agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of staff assistance.   \n12  131.  Mr. QUINLAN’s son, Phillip Quinlan, and his granddaughter, LORESIA \n13  VALLETTE, read the agreement on LAWRENCE QUINLAN’s behalf and reasonably \n14  understood BROOKDALE’s representations as statements that BROOKDALE would \n15  perform assessments to determine needed services and staff BROOKDALE Hemet in a \n16  manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services that BROOKDALE \n17  promised and for which Mr. QUINLAN was paying.  Ms. VALLETTE and Phillip Quinlan \n18  relied on these representations in making the decision to place Mr. QUINLAN at \n19  BROOKDALE Hemet and to pay BROOKDALE the monthly fees from Mr. QUINLAN’s \n20  accounts.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to LAWRENCE QUINLAN, Phillip Quinlan, or \n21  LORESIA VALLETTE at any time prior to his admission nor has it disclosed since that \n22  time that its corporate policy and procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its \n23  facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing the care and services residents have \n24  been promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the \n25  care and services they have paid for on any given day.  If BROOKDALE had disclosed \n26  this material fact to LAWRENCE QUINLAN, Phillip Quinlan, or LORESIA VALLETTE, \n27  they would have looked for another facility for Mr. QUINLAN and would not have agreed \n28  to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE from LAWRENCE QUINLAN’s accounts.  \n  50  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 52 of 110\n \n1  132.  Mr. QUINLAN is a wheelchair-user.  He has right hemiparesis and aphasia \n2  due to past strokes.  He has mild dementia.  During the time Mr. QUINLAN was a resident \n3  at BROOKDALE Hemet, he required assistance with the following activities of daily \n4  living:  bathing, personal hygiene, dressing, laundry, housecleaning, taking medication, \n5  preparing meals, toileting, and transfers to and from his wheelchair.  During Mr. \n6  QUINLAN’s long-term stay at BROOKDALE Hemet, he paid for but was not consistently \n7  provided that assistance. \n8  133.  Although he was paying for assistance with laundry, dressing and showering, \n9  Mr. QUINLAN’s granddaughter and son noticed that he smelled horrible and wore dirty \n10  clothing.  When Ms. VALLETTE asked BROOKDALE staff why Mr. QUINLAN smelled \n11  so bad, they blamed him for refusing to take a shower.  BROOKDALE then raised Mr. \n12  QUINLAN’s monthly personal care rate by $700, even though they were not giving him \n13  the promised showers, because he was “resistant.”  Ms. VALLETTE requested that \n14  BROOKDALE’s staff call her if Mr. QUINLAN refused to shower or change his clothing \n15  so that she could speak with her grandfather and try to convince him to cooperate.  \n16  BROOKDALE staff rarely called Ms. VALLETTE, but the facility continued to charge \n17  Mr. QUINLAN a premium for showers and dressing assistance they were not providing. \n18  134.  Over time, BROOKDALE continued to increase Mr. QUINLAN’s monthly \n19  care rates, blaming his resistance to care.  Ms. VALLETTE accepted the care rate \n20  increases with the expectation that Mr. QUINLAN would actually receive the services for \n21  which BROOKDALE was charging him.  Despite the increased fees, BROOKDALE staff \n22  rarely provided the promised assistance with showering, dressing or toileting to Mr. \n23  QUINLAN.  Toward the end of Mr. QUINLAN’s stay at BROOKDALE Hemet, the \n24  Executive Director told Ms. VALLETTE that they would need to move Mr. QUINLAN to \n25  the memory care unit and take away his motorized scooter in order to care for him.  This \n26  would result in another increase in his monthly rate. In April 2017, frustrated by \n27  BROOKDALE’s failure to provide the assistance her grandfather needed and for which he \n28  was paying increasingly higher fees, Ms. VALLETTE told BROOKDALE that Mr. \n  51  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 53 of 110\n \n1  QUINLAN would be moving out.  Prior to the move-out date, Ms. VALLETTE and \n2  Phillip Quinlan took Mr. QUINLAN to a physician’s office to get a tuberculosis test.  \n3  When he transferred out of his wheelchair, they saw that the seating pad was soaked with \n4  urine and that the plastic was breaking down as a result.  It was clear that neither the \n5  seating pad nor Mr. QUINLAN had been washed for a very long time.  Although Mr. \n6  QUINLAN’s move-out date was scheduled for early May 2017, Ms. VALLETTE moved \n7  him out on April 30, 2017.  Mr. QUINLAN is a currently a resident of an unrelated \n8  assisted living facility in Riverside, California. \n9  Edward Boris \n10  135.  EDWARD BORIS was a resident at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove’s \n11  assisted living facility from approximately September 10, 2015 to approximately July 21, \n12  2016.  On or about September 10, 2015, EDWARD BORIS’s daughter MICHELE \n13  LYTLE, read, reviewed, and signed a “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT” with \n14  BROOKDALE as EDWARD BORIS’s legal representative and power of attorney.  As \n15  part of this “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT,” BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to \n16  provide you with care, supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily \n17  living in order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, \n18  which are included in the Basic Service Rate.”  These included, among other things, the \n19  room, three daily meals, planned activities, transportation, and the availability of staff “24 \n20  hours a day, seven days a week.”  This standard residency agreement also stated that: \n21  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use \na personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  \n22  The personal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal \nService Plan.  The results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your \n23  personal care needs, and the cost of providing the additional personal service \n(the “Personal Service Rate”) will be shared with you. \n24   \n25  136.  Among the personal services Mr. BORIS required and agreed to pay for \n26  were catheter care, changing, and emptying; toileting assistance; assistance going to and \n27  from the dining room and other activities; medication administration; pharmacy services, \n28  including medication pick-up; assistance bathing; and application of topical anti-fungal \n  52  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 54 of 110\n \n1  medication.  On top of a $4,545 monthly Basic Service Rate, BROOKDALE charged Mr. \n2  BORIS a $2,697 monthly personal service fee.  In addition to the residency agreement’s \n3  promises of adequate care and service provision, Ms. LYTLE received and reviewed a \n4  variety of rate increase letters and invoices that listed the fees for services BROOKDALE \n5  agreed its caregivers and other staff would provide to Mr. BORIS.  Mr. BORIS, through \n6  his legal representative and power of attorney, MICHELE LYTLE, read and reasonably \n7  understood BROOKDALE’s representations as statements that BROOKDALE would \n8  perform assessments to determine needed services and staff BROOKDALE Fountaingrove \n9  in a manner that would allow it to consistently provide the services that BROOKDALE \n10  promised and for which Mr. BORIS was paying.   Mr. BORIS, through MICHELE \n11  LYTLE, relied on these representations in making the decision to enter BROOKDALE \n12  Fountaingrove and to pay BROOKDALE the monthly fees it charged him.   \n13  137.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to Mr. BORIS or his legal representative at \n14  any time prior to his admission nor has it disclosed since that time that its corporate policy \n15  and procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes \n16  BROOKDALE from providing the care and services residents have been promised and \n17  places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they \n18  have paid for on any given day.  If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to Mr. \n19  BORIS or his legal representative prior to or early in his residency, they would have \n20  looked for another facility for Mr. BORIS and would not have agreed to pay the rates \n21  charged by BROOKDALE.   \n22  138.  BROOKDALE staff failed to regularly monitor Mr. BORIS’s catheter, even \n23  though Mr. BORIS required and paid for that service.  On one occasion in May 2016, Mr. \n24  BORIS’s catheter overflowed, disconnected, and spilled urine all over his room.  On July \n25  20, 2016, Mr. BORIS’s catheter developed a blockage, but BROOKDALE’s staff failed to \n26  identify or address the problem for about 24 hours.  Mr. BORIS’s girlfriend, who visited \n27  Mr. BORIS at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove on the evening of July 20, noticed blood in \n28  the catheter bag and reported it to BROOKDALE’s staff.  Staff came to Mr. BORIS’s \n  53  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 55 of 110\n \n1  room, but they were rushed, failed to identify the blockage, and did nothing to assist Mr. \n2  BORIS.  Instead, they told Mr. BORIS’s girlfriend not to worry.  The next day, Mr. \n3  BORIS was in extreme pain; there was still a blockage and very little urine appeared in the \n4  catheter bag.  Mr. BORIS’s condition continued to deteriorate and eventually his girlfriend \n5  took him to a local hospital, where doctors diagnosed the blocked catheter.  As a result of \n6  the blockage, Mr. BORIS suffered a urinary tract infection and kidney failure, and had to \n7  stay in intensive care for several days.  After his discharge from the hospital, Mr. BORIS’s \n8  condition was so bad that he had to be transferred out of assisted living and into skilled \n9  nursing.   \n10  139.  Aware that BROOKDALE’s failure to adequately provide the care and \n11  services it had promised contributed to Mr. BORIS’s declining health, Ms. LYTLE sought \n12  to move him out of BROOKDALE’s custody.  Ms. LYTLE conducted significant research \n13  and held onsite interviews with at least three other skilled nursing facilities.  However, \n14  because Mr. BORIS’s condition had deteriorated so significantly, she was unable to find \n15  any facility willing to accept Mr. BORIS as a resident.  Thus, the same inadequate care \n16  that contributed to Mr. BORIS’s illness prevented Ms. LYTLE from moving Mr. BORIS \n17  into a different facility. \n18  140.  From February 2016 through the end of his time in BROOKDALE’s assisted \n19  living facility, Mr. BORIS had a recurring fungal infection on his legs and in his groin \n20  area.  His doctor ordered him to keep the area clean and apply a topical medication twice a \n21  day.  Even though Mr. BORIS paid thousands of dollars per month for necessary personal \n22  services, including help with bathing and administering medications, BROOKDALE staff \n23  failed to bathe Mr. BORIS or apply his topical medication regularly.  As a result, the \n24  infection persisted for months.  At times, the infected area was bloody and emitted a foul \n25  odor that pervaded Mr. BORIS’s room. \n26  141.  Mr. BORIS took a blood thinning medication as well as several other \n27  medications.  When he was in assisted living at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, he paid \n28  $726 per month for staff assistance with ordering, storing, and administering his \n  54  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 56 of 110\n \n1  medications, but BROOKDALE staff regularly failed to perform these tasks.  At one point \n2  in May 2016, BROOKDALE staff failed to give Mr. BORIS his blood thinning medication \n3  for three days straight.  The problem was discovered only after Mr. BORIS’s girlfriend \n4  noticed the lapse.  On several other occasions, staff failed to refill Mr. BORIS’s \n5  prescriptions, so his girlfriend had to pick them up herself.  One time, Mr. BORIS’s \n6  medication for his fungal infection ran out and staff failed to replace it for several days. \n7  142.  One of the main reasons MICHELE LYTLE sought out an assisted living \n8  facility for her father was that Mr. BORIS needed regular staff assistance to prevent and \n9  respond to falls.  However, on numerous occasions during his stay in the BROOKDALE \n10  Fountaingrove assisted living facility, Mr. BORIS fell in his room and was left on the \n11  ground for extended periods of time because the facility was so understaffed employees \n12  could not regularly check on him.  When Ms. LYTLE reported this problem to staff at \n13  BROOKDALE Fountaingrove, they dismissed the falls as minor even though Mr. BORIS \n14  had bruises on his body.  Other times, even though BROOKDALE had agreed to provide \n15  Mr. BORIS with toileting assistance multiple times per day and charged him a substantial \n16  monthly fee for that service, he was left sitting in his own feces because BROOKDALE \n17  staff failed to check on him or help him use the bathroom.  When he resided in assisted \n18  living, Mr. BORIS had difficulty getting around on his own, even with the assistance of a \n19  walker or wheelchair.  He is also very introverted.  As a result, he seldom left his room for \n20  meals unless prompted by staff.  Although BROOKDALE charged Mr. BORIS a monthly \n21  fee for help going to and from the dining room, staff frequently failed to prompt Mr. \n22  BORIS at mealtimes or bring him food from the dining room, so he often missed meals.  \n23  BROOKDALE charged Mr. BORIS $5 per meal when meals were supposedly brought to \n24  his room.  However, when Ms. LYTLE asked BROOKDALE staff how often her father \n25  had been eating, they were unable to answer.  Because BROOKDALE often failed to \n26  prompt Mr. BORIS to attend meals or to supply them in his room, Mr. BORIS relied on his \n27  girlfriend to take prepared food to him. \n28  143.  Even though BROOKDALE promises weekly laundry service in its \n  55  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 57 of 110\n \n1  residency agreement, staff frequently failed to wash Mr. BORIS’s clothes and laundry on a \n2  weekly basis.  In addition, staff often dumped Mr. BORIS’s clean laundry in a pile in his \n3  room, even though he was not capable of putting it away himself.  MICHELE LYTLE \n4  brought these problems to the attention of managers at BROOKDALE Fountaingrove.  \n5  BROOKDALE management assured Ms. LYTLE that they were working to address her \n6  concerns, but she never saw significant improvement during the time that Mr. Boris \n7  resided in assisted living.  Mr. BORIS ultimately had to move out of assisted living \n8  precisely because of a serious infection he developed due to BROOKDALE staff’s failure \n9  to monitor his catheter.  BROOKDALE has never disclosed to Mr. BORIS or Ms. LYTLE \n10  that its staffing policies and procedures preclude it from consistently providing its residents \n11  the care and services they have been promised and places all residents in an inherent and \n12  substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any \n13  given day.  However, several low-level, non-managerial BROOKDALE employees \n14  admitted to Ms. LYTLE that the BROOKDALE Fountaingrove assisted living facility was \n15  understaffed, that caregivers’ hours were being cut, and that they did not have enough time \n16  or resources to adequately attend to Mr. BORIS and the other residents. \n17  Ralph Schmidt \n18  144.  RALPH SCHMIDT is 54 years old, is blind, and has significant cognitive \n19  impairments, including short-term memory loss.  Both his blindness and cognitive \n20  impairments are the result of a traumatic brain injury suffered more than 20 years ago.  Mr. \n21  SCHMIDT has a court-appointed conservator who manages his financial, medical, and \n22  legal affairs.  He needs assistance with the following activities of daily living: \n23  housekeeping, laundry, navigating when outside of his dwelling, preparing nutritious \n24  meals, and transportation.   \n25  145.  RALPH SCHMIDT was a resident at the assisted living facility currently \n26  known as BROOKDALE Tracy from approximately September 2011 to October 30, 2017.  \n27  The BROOKDALE Tracy facility was operated by Emeritus when Mr. SCHMIDT moved \n28  in.  However, BROOKDALE took over operation of the facility following its merger with \n  56  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 58 of 110\n \n1  Emeritus. \n2  146.  In or about April 2014, Emeritus announced that it would merge with \n3  BROOKDALE.  At the time of the merger, Mr. SCHMIDT’s then-conservator and legal \n4  representative, Ms. Gallagher, had no reason to believe that the care Mr. SCHMIDT would \n5  receive from BROOKDALE would be any worse than the care he had received under \n6  Emeritus.  BROOKDALE did not inform Mr. SCHMIDT or his conservator nor did they \n7  have any reason to believe that BROOKDALE would not staff the facility with sufficient \n8  staff in numbers and training to provide the services for which Mr. SCHMIDT and the \n9  other residents were paying.   \n10  147.  After taking over operations at the Tracy assisted living facility, \n11  BROOKDALE, on or about July 5, 2016, required Ms. Gallagher, Ms. FISHER’s \n12  predecessor as RALPH SCHMIDT’s conservator, to execute an updated Residency \n13  Agreement with BROOKDALE on Mr. SCHMIDT’s behalf.  As part of this \n14  “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT,” BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to provide you with \n15  care, supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet \n16  your needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, which are included in \n17  the Basic Service Rate.”  These included, among other things, the room, three daily meals, \n18  housekeeping, laundry and linen service, planned social activities, transportation, and the \n19  availability of staff “24 hours a day, seven days a week.”  This standard residency \n20  agreement also stated that: \n21  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use \na personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  \n22  The personal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal \nService Plan.  The results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your \n23  personal care needs, and the cost of providing the additional personal service \n(the “Personal Service Rate”) will be shared with you. \n24   \n25  Among the personal services Mr. SCHMIDT required were assistance navigating from his \n26  second-floor room to the dining room at meal times and to other community spaces, \n27  prompts to engage in community and social activities, and medication management.  In \n28  exchange for these necessary services, as of July 2016, Mr. SCHMIDT payed a monthly \n  57  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 59 of 110\n \n1  fee of over $1,000 in addition to his basic service rate. \n2  148.  Mr. SCHMIDT, through his conservator, read and reasonably understood \n3  BROOKDALE’s representations as statements that BROOKDALE would perform \n4  assessments to determine needed services and staff BROOKDALE Tracy in a manner that \n5  would allow it to consistently provide the services that BROOKDALE promised and for \n6  which Mr. SCHMIDT was paying.  Mr. SCHMIDT, through his conservator, relied on \n7  these representations in making the decision to remain at BROOKDALE Tracy and to pay \n8  BROOKDALE the monthly fees it charged him.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to Mr. \n9  SCHMIDT or his legal representative at any time that its corporate policy and procedure of \n10  providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing \n11  the care and services residents have been promised and places all residents at a substantial \n12  risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day.  If \n13  BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to Mr. SCHMIDT or his legal \n14  representative, they would have looked much sooner for another facility for Mr. \n15  SCHMIDT and would not have agreed to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE from \n16  Mr. SCHMIDT’s estate’s funds.   \n17  149.  During his time with BROOKDALE, Mr. SCHMIDT lived in a second-floor \n18  room.  Because of his blindness, short-term memory loss, and other cognitive impairments, \n19  Mr. SCHMIDT was unable to navigate to the dining room or other public areas from the \n20  second floor, which would have required him to use stairs or operate an elevator.  \n21  Placement on the second floor caused Mr. SCHMIDT to require the assistance of \n22  BROOKDALE staff for escort services he would not have needed had he been on the first \n23  floor, and BROOKDALE mandated that Mr. SCHMIDT pay for the escort services he \n24  received.  Thus the second-floor placement both unnecessarily reduced Mr. SCHMIDT’s \n25  autonomy and increased the fees he paid to BROOKDALE.  A first-floor room would have \n26  provided Mr. SCHMIDT greater autonomy and would have reduced BROOKDALE’s \n27  charges for escort services.  However, when Ms. Gallagher asked if Mr. SCHMIDT could \n28  be moved to an apartment that would accommodate his needs, BROOKDALE responded \n  58  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 60 of 110\n \n1  that a first-floor room would be more expensive and would thus negate any savings from \n2  the elimination of escort fees.   \n3  150.  Because Mr. SCHMIDT required staff assistance to navigate from his \n4  second-floor room to the dining room and other common areas, he frequently waited for \n5  staff to come and assist him.  Mr. SCHMIDT used a call button to summon an escort for \n6  each meal and typically waited twenty to thirty minutes before a BROOKDALE staff \n7  member would arrive.  Mr. SCHMIDT faced similarly lengthy waits when he wanted to \n8  return to his room.  These waits greatly frustrated Mr. SCHMIDT. \n9  151.  BROOKDALE responded to Mr. SCHMIDT’s frustration and need for \n10  appropriate accommodations in shockingly inappropriate ways.  Professing to be \n11  concerned that Mr. SCHMIDT might harm someone with his tapping cane, BROOKDALE \n12  staff once took it away from him for several weeks.  This rendered Mr. SCHMIDT unable \n13  to safely navigate around even the first floor of the BROOKDALE Tracy facility.  \n14  BROOKDALE staff did not return Mr. SCHMIDT’s tapping cane until his conservator \n15  personally intervened.  On other occasions, BROOKDALE staff failed to provide Mr. \n16  SCHMIDT with a tapping cane or notify his conservator of his need for one when his \n17  previous cane was broken and unusable.  BROOKDALE’s response to Mr. SCHMIDT’s \n18  frustration with slow staff responses to calls for assistance simply rendered Mr. SCHMIDT \n19  more dependent on BROOKDALE staff. \n20  152.  Several times during Mr. SCHMIDT’s years at BROOKDALE, he formed \n21  relationships with other residents who would assist him in navigating from his apartment \n22  to the dining room at meals times.  During these periods in which Mr. SCHMIDT had the \n23  assistance of other residents, he did not rely on BROOKDALE staff as frequently for \n24  escort services.  Nevertheless, BROOKDALE continued to charge Mr. SCHMIDT the \n25  same escort fee. \n26  153.  Because of his short-term memory loss and other cognitive impairments, Mr. \n27  SCHMIDT occasionally lost the key to the door of his apartment during his time at \n28  BROOKDALE Tracy.  On one occasion, rather than replace his key, BROOKDALE staff \n  59  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 61 of 110\n \n1  gave Mr. SCHMIDT a blank, uncut key, and told him that it was the key to his apartment.  \n2  Mr. SCHMIDT believed what BROOKDALE staff told him and could not understand why \n3  the key would not unlock his door.  This caused Mr. SCHMIDT great distress and made \n4  him unnecessarily reliant on BROOKDALE staff to open his apartment door when he \n5  wanted to enter his room. \n6  154.  On several occasions the toilet in Mr. SCHMIDT’s apartment overflowed.  \n7  BROOKDALE responded by locking Mr. SCHMIDT out of the bathroom in his apartment \n8  altogether.  Rather than fix the problems with the toilet, BROOKDALE gave Mr. \n9  SCHMIDT, via his conservator, HEATHER FISHER, the option of a portable toilet in Mr. \n10  SCHMIDT’s room or paying for a full-time personal caretaker at the additional cost of \n11  $250 per day.  Mr. SCHMIDT’s estate was unable to bear the expense of a full-time \n12  personal caretaker, so Ms. FISHER reluctantly accepted the option of a portable toilet.  \n13  However, BROOKDALE failed to regularly empty the toilet, which caused Mr. \n14  SCHMIDT’s room to have an unpleasant odor.  Mr. SCHMIDT responded by routinely \n15  emptying the portable toilet himself, directly onto the roof outside of his window.  Aware \n16  of the problem and Mr. SCHMIDT’s response, BROOKDALE failed to remove fecal \n17  matter sitting just outside of Mr. SCHMIDT’s window.  \n18  155.  Mr. SCHMIDT also disliked using the portable toilet as he found it too small \n19  for him to comfortably sit on.  He would have preferred to use a toilet outside of his room, \n20  but staff responded so slowly to his call button that calling for an escort to a bathroom was \n21  not a realistic option.  On one occasion, he pressed his call button to use the bathroom \n22  around 11:00 p.m., and no staff member ever responded. \n23  156.  Denial of access to his bathroom also meant that Mr. SCHMIDT could not \n24  shower without the assistance of BROOKDALE staff.  Having locked him out of his \n25  bathroom, BROOKDALE staff allowed Mr. SCHMIDT to shower only twice per week, \n26  usually at night.  This too distressed Mr. SCHMIDT, as he preferred to shower more \n27  frequently and to do so in the morning.  Moreover, if Mr. SCHMIDT was engaged in an \n28  activity and declined to shower at the moment the opportunity was offered, he could \n  60  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 62 of 110\n \n1  shower only once per week. \n2  157.  Although BROOKDALE promised to provide housekeeping among its basic \n3  services, Mr. SCHMIDT’s apartment was not well cared for and was rarely clean.  His \n4  carpets were covered with stains and frequently dirty.  The windows to his room had no \n5  blinds, and the screens had been almost completely torn off.  Before BROOKDALE \n6  locked Mr. SCHMIDT out of the bathroom in his apartment, BROOKDALE also failed to \n7  keep it clean.  The bathroom was frequently dirty and unhygienic. \n8  Art Lindstrom \n9  158.  ART LINDSTROM was a resident of BROOKDALE Scotts Valley from \n10  approximately November 2015 until his death on February 23, 2018.  His wife, PAT \n11  LINDSTROM, has also been a resident of BROOKDALE Scotts Valley from \n12  approximately November 2015 and remains a resident of the facility.  On or about October \n13  31, 2015, ART LINDSTROM and his wife PAT LINDSTROM read, reviewed, and signed \n14  a “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT” with BROOKDALE.  As part of this “RESIDENCY \n15  AGREEMENT,” BROOKDALE stated that “[i]n order to provide you with care, \n16  supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily living in order to meet your \n17  needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, which are included in the \n18  Basic Service Rate.”  These included, among other things, the room, three daily meals, \n19  planned activities, transportation, ongoing observation and consultation regarding social \n20  and health care needs, and the availability of staff “24 hours a day, seven days a week.” \n21  159.  BROOKDALE also provided a standard form further elaborating on the \n22  “Services and Care Covered by [the] Basic Service Rate.”  These services and care \n23  described included “housekeeping,” “routine wellness monitoring,” “consultation with [a] \n24  Brookdale clinical team,” and “signature dining programs with nutritious meals and snacks \n25  planned by a registered dietician.”  \n26  160.  Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM read and reasonably understood \n27  BROOKDALE’s representations in the RESIDENCY AGREEMENT and other standard \n28  documents as statements that BROOKDALE would staff the Scotts Valley facility in a \n  61  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 63 of 110\n \n1  manner that would allow it to consistently provide them with the care, supervision and \n2  assistance they needed and for which they were paying BROOKDALE, which included the \n3  services and care covered by the Basic Service Rate.   Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM relied \n4  on these representations in making the decision to enter BROOKDALE Scotts Valley.  \n5  BROOKDALE did not disclose to Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM at any time prior to their \n6  admission nor has it disclosed since that time that its corporate policy and procedure of \n7  providing predetermined staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing \n8  the care and services residents have been promised and places all residents at a substantial \n9  risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day.  If \n10  BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM prior to or \n11  early in their residency, they would have looked for another facility and would not have \n12  agreed to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE. \n13  161.  When Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM moved in to BROOKDALE, their “basic \n14  service rate” was approximately $5,900 per month plus an additional $400 monthly \n15  second-resident fee.  In addition to these recurring charges, Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM \n16  were made to pay move-in fees totaling more than $8,000.  When Mr. and Ms. \n17  LINDSTROM moved from their initial two-bedroom suite into a studio apartment, their \n18  rate decreased to $4,295 per month plus the $400 monthly second-resident fee. \n19  162.  During his residency at BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, Mr. LINDSTROM \n20  was diabetic; used a cane to walk; suffered from kidney failure, heart disease, and sleep \n21  apnea; had a dementia-related cognitive impairment; and had difficulty controlling his \n22  weight. He required assistance with the following activities of daily living:  bathing, \n23  shaving, administration of medication, dressing, laundry, and preparing nutritious meals.  \n24  Because Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM could not afford the additional care fees related to \n25  many of these activities, Ms. LINDSTROM assisted Mr. LINDSTROM with most of these \n26  tasks.   However, Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM sought and BROOKDALE promised to \n27  provide assistance with preparing nutritious meals and snacks planned by a registered \n28  dietician and to personally assess and provide necessary health and social services.  These \n  62  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 64 of 110\n \n1  promises were among the principal reasons Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM decided to live at \n2  BROOKDALE Scotts Valley.  Although BROOKDALE promised to prepare meals \n3  appropriate for Mr. LINDSTROM’s personal condition as part of its basic services, it \n4  failed to do so. \n5  163.  After they moved in to BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, Mr. and Ms. \n6  LINDSTROM discovered that there was no registered dietician on staff to make sure Mr. \n7  LINDSTROM received meals appropriate for his condition.  Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM \n8  also discovered that BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing prevented \n9  kitchen staff from preparing and serving Mr. LINDSTROM meals appropriate for someone \n10  with diabetes.  Because there were too few staff to pay attention to individual residents’ \n11  dietary needs, those who were unfamiliar with Mr. LINDSTROM’s condition and personal \n12  health requirements often served him oversized portions of foods unsuitable for a diabetic \n13  when they noticed he was a large man. Mr. LINDSTROM’s cognitive impairment made it \n14  especially difficult for him to resist tempting but unhealthy food once it was on his plate.  \n15  164.  The lack of adequate staffing left Mr. LINDSTROM without the \n16  individualized nutritional attention and assistance he required.  As a result, after moving \n17  into BROOKDALE, Mr. LINDSTROM gained 20 pounds, which exacerbated his \n18  difficulty walking and put him at increased risk of complications from diabetes.  Because \n19  his dementia was also exacerbated by his diabetes, Mr. LINDSTROM’s cognitive decline \n20  may have accelerated. \n21  165.  When the Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM moved in to BROOKDALE Scotts \n22  Valley, there was an onsite physical therapist available to advise and assist residents with \n23  recovery from injuries.  The availability of a physical therapist was attractive to Mr. and \n24  Mrs. LINDSTROM, and they relied on BROOKDALE’s representation that the onsite \n25  physical therapist would be available to them.  They also understood that BROOKDALE’s \n26  promise to provide continuous monitoring and consultation on health would include \n27  keeping an onsite physical therapist on staff. \n28  166.  Approximately six months after Mr. and Ms. LINDSTROM arrived at \n  63  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 65 of 110\n \n1  BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, however, the physical therapist left, and BROOKDALE \n2  failed to hire a replacement.  After entering BROOKDALE, Mr. LINDSTROM suffered a \n3  knee injury and would have used the onsite physical therapist’s services during his \n4  recovery had that been an option.  Instead, Mr. LINDSTROM had to seek less convenient \n5  physical therapy services outside of the BROOKDALE facility. \n6  Bernie Jestrabek-Hart \n7  167.  BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART has been a resident of BROOKDALE Scotts \n8  Valley since approximately October 17, 2015.  On or about September 30, 2015, BERNIE \n9  JESTRABEK-HART read, reviewed, and signed a “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT” with \n10  BROOKDALE.  As part of this “RESIDENCY AGREEMENT,” BROOKDALE stated \n11  that “[i]n order to provide you with care, supervision and assistance with instrumental \n12  activities of daily living in order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the \n13  following Basic Services, which are included in the Basic Service Rate.”  These included, \n14  among other things, the room, three daily meals, planned activities, transportation, and the \n15  availability of staff “24 hours a day, seven days a week.”  This standard residency \n16  agreement also stated that: \n17  [p]rior to moving in and periodically throughout your residency, we will use \na personal service assessment to determine the personal services you require.  \n18  The personal service assessment will be used to develop your Personal \nService Plan.  The results of the assessment, our method for evaluating your \n19  personal care needs, and the cost of providing the additional personal service \n(the “Personal Service Rate”) will be shared with you. \n20   \n21  The Personal Service Plan lists the types of staff assistance that Ms. JESTRABEK-HART \n22  requires and has agreed to pay for, along with the monthly fee for each type of staff \n23  assistance.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART has also received and reviewed a variety of rate \n24  increase letters and invoices that list the fees for services BROOKDALE agreed its \n25  caregivers and other staff would provide to her. \n26  168.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART read and reasonably understood BROOKDALE’s \n27  representations in the RESIDENCY AGREEMENT, invoices and rate increase letters as \n28  statements that BROOKDALE would perform assessments to determine needed services \n  64  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 66 of 110\n \n1  and staff BROOKDALE Scotts Valley in a manner that would allow it to consistently \n2  provide the services that BROOKDALE promised and for which Ms. JESTRABEK-\n3  HART was paying.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART relied on these representations in making \n4  the decision to enter BROOKDALE Scotts Valley.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to Ms. \n5  JESTRABEK-HART at any time prior to her admission nor has it disclosed since that time \n6  that its corporate policy and procedure of providing predetermined staffing at its facilities \n7  precludes BROOKDALE from providing the care and services residents have been \n8  promised and places all residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and \n9  services they have paid for on any given day. If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material \n10  fact to Ms. JESTRABEK-HART prior to or early in her residency, she would have looked \n11  for another facility and would not have agreed to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE. \n12  169.  When Ms. JESTRABEK-HART moved in to BROOKDALE, her “basic \n13  service rate” was approximately $3,700 per month.  In addition, Ms. JESTRABEK-HART \n14  would pay a monthly fee of $750 for assistance showering at least four times per week and \n15  daily dressing and undressing.  These personal care services were among the principal \n16  reasons Ms. JESTRABEK-HART sought to live in an assisted-living setting.   Over and \n17  above these monthly payments, BROOKDALE required Ms. JESTRABEK-HART to pay \n18  approximately $1,350 in move-in fees. \n19  170.  Despite these hefty monthly rates and move-in fees, BROOKDALE began to \n20  increase Ms. JESTRABEK-HART’s basic service rate just months after her arrival and at \n21  least annually thereafter.  By January 2018, BROOKDALE had increased Ms. \n22  JESTRABEK-HART’s basic service rate to $4,477, a 21% increase above her initial rate \n23  of $3,700 in just over two years.  In January 2018, BROOKDALE increased Ms. \n24  JESTRABEK-HART’s fee for assistance with dressing and showering from $750 to $834 \n25  per month, an 11.2% increase. \n26  171.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART uses an electric wheelchair and cane for mobility, \n27  and many common areas at BROOKDALE Scotts Valley are difficult or dangerous for her \n28  and others with mobility disabilities to access.  A number of doors that connect common \n  65  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 67 of 110\n \n1  indoor space to outdoor courtyards are heavy and difficult to open.  Several doors to \n2  laundry rooms and bathrooms in common spaces are also heavy and difficult to open.  \n3  Attempting to open these doors is dangerous for Ms. JESTRABEK-HART, as the weight \n4  of the door could injure her directly or cause her to fall. \n5  172.  Lack of safety precautions in laundry rooms at BROOKDALE Scotts Valley \n6  present unreasonable risk to residents with mobility disabilities.  On one occasion, Ms. \n7  JESTRABEK-HART tripped getting up from her wheelchair and fell onto the floor of the \n8  laundry room.  This laundry room is in a secluded corner of the facility enclosed by a \n9  heavy door and lacks emergency pull cords for residents to use in case of a fall.  \n10  Accordingly, Ms. JESTRABEK-HART had no way to summon help.  Fortunately, another \n11  individual whom Ms. JESTRABEK-HART believes to have been a resident was nearby \n12  and found Ms. JESTRABEK-HART on the floor.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART informed \n13  BROOKDALE of the need for emergency pull cords in the laundry after her fall, but \n14  BROOKDALE has taken no action.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART continues to do her own \n15  laundry.  BROOKDALE’s failure to remedy the dangerous conditions in the laundry \n16  rooms at BROOKDALE Scotts Valley puts Ms. JESTRABEK-HART at continuing risk of \n17  serious injury. \n18  173.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART enjoys getting out of the BROOKDALE Scotts \n19  Valley facility and participating in off-site activities.  She had been able to take her electric \n20  wheelchair on a bus provided by her previous assisted-living residence.  Prior to moving \n21  into BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, Ms. JESTRABECK-HART looked at BROOKDALE’s \n22  website and saw that BROOKDALE offered free bus transportation to doctor’s visits, \n23  social outings and other offsite activities.  That service was among the major selling points \n24  for Ms. JESTRABEK-HART, and she relied on BROOKDALE’s representations that she \n25  would be able to participate in outings on the bus.  After moving in, she was surprised to \n26  learn that the transportation schedule was very limited and that BROOKDALE would not \n27  allow her to take her electric wheelchair on the bus.  Her electric wheelchair is Ms. \n28  JESTRABEK-HART’s primary means of personal transportation and is necessary for her \n  66  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 68 of 110\n \n1  to participate on shopping trips and other outings that require mobility upon arrival.  \n2  BROOKDALE has proposed that Ms. JESTRABEK-HART use a non-motorized \n3  wheelchair on these outings, but that would leave Ms. JESTRABEK-HART stranded upon \n4  arrival because she needs an electric wheelchair for mobility.   \n5  174.  BROOKDALE’s understaffing and failure to plan for emergencies has also \n6  negatively affected Ms. JESTRABEK-HART.  On one occasion, a power outage caused \n7  the elevators to cease to function, stranding Ms. JESTRABEK-HART, whose room is on \n8  the facility’s second floor, on a lower level.  BROOKDALE staff helped some residents \n9  get up to their rooms, but were unable to help Ms. JESTRABEK-HART and other \n10  residents who are wheelchair users.  She and other residents with mobility disabilities \n11  waited for three to four hours before firefighters arrived to assist those who could not walk \n12  up the stairs.  Because of BROOKDALE’s inadequate staffing and emergency planning, \n13  many residents were stranded away from their rooms late into the night.  \n14  175.  While the power was out, Ms. JESTRABEK-HART was unable to use her \n15  continuous positive airway pressure (“CPAP”) machine, which she requires to sleep due to \n16  sleep apnea.  BROOKDALE Scotts Valley had only one electrical outlet that was \n17  generator-powered, which was located on the first floor near the nurse’s office.  As a \n18  result, the outlet was not accessible to Ms. JESTRABEK-HART.  BROOKDALE staff did \n19  not attempt to connect Ms. JESTRABEK-HART’s CPAP machine to a generator-powered \n20  outlet. \n21  176.  While Ms. JESTRABEK-HART does not require assistance to get to and \n22  from meals, she has witnessed those who do need assistance wait for long periods before a \n23  staff member is available to help.  On one occasion, Ms. JESTRABEK-HART and others \n24  waited with a resident who was left in the lunchroom for over an hour and a half following \n25  the end of the meal before she received the assistance she needed to return to her room. \n26  177.  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART requires assistance with dressing and bathing and \n27  pays BROOKDALE $834 per month for these services.  When deciding whether to move \n28  in to BROOKDALE Scotts Valley, among the items most important to Ms. JESTRABEK-\n  67  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 69 of 110\n \n1  HART was that she receive assistance showering at least four times per week, and she \n2  relied on BROOKDALE’s representation that it would be able to meet this need.  \n3  Ms. JESTRABEK-HART usually informs BROOKDALE staff after dinner that she is \n4  ready to shower.  She frequently waits for two to three hours before a staff member can \n5  assist her.  On multiple occasions, Ms. JESTRABEK-HART has waited so long that she \n6  has gone to sleep only to be awakened by a staff member who has finally come to provide \n7  the necessary assistance.  Other times, BROOKDALE has canceled a previously scheduled \n8  shower altogether. \n9  178.  With respect to assistance dressing, Ms. JESTREBEK-HART has asked for \n10  BROOKDALE staff to come to help her around the time she wakes at 7:00 a.m.  Often, \n11  however, she will wait until 8:30 a.m. or 9:00 a.m. before staff arrive to assist her.  \n12  Similarly, she often waits for long periods for assistance undressing in the evenings.  On \n13  several occasions when help has not come, Ms. JESTREBEK-HART has slept in her \n14  clothes and shoes, which can cause pain in her feet and make it otherwise difficult to get \n15  comfortable.  BROOKDALE staff has told her, often in the evening around 8:30 p.m. and \n16  sometimes in the morning around 7:00 a.m., that these delays occur because only one staff \n17  member is on duty to meet the needs of 150 residents. \n18  Jeanette Algarme \n19  179.  JEANETTE ALGARME has been a resident at BROOKDALE Brookhurst \n20  since approximately April 2018.  Prior to moving in, Ms. ALGARME read, reviewed, and \n21  signed a Residency Agreement.  The Residency Agreement stated that “[i]n order to \n22  provide you with care, supervision and assistance with instrumental activities of daily \n23  living in order to meet your needs, we will provide you with the following Basic Services, \n24  which are included in the Basic Service Rate.”  These included, among other things, \n25  Ms. ALGARME’s room, three meals daily, housekeeping, laundry and linen service, \n26  activities, transportation, “staffing 24 hours a day,” and personal services as determined \n27  appropriate based on a “personal service assessment” used to “develop your Personal \n28  Service Plan.”  The Residency Agreement noted that “[t]he results of the assessment, our \n  68  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 70 of 110\n \n1  method for evaluating your personal care needs, and the cost of providing the additional \n2  personal services (the ‘Personal Service Rate’) will be shared with you.”   \n3  180.  Upon moving into the BROOKDALE Brookhurst facility, Ms. ALGARME \n4  required and agreed to pay for the following personal services: “hands on” assistance with \n5  dressing and grooming, and “hands on” assistance with showering.  The Personal Service \n6  Plan listed the types of assistance Ms. ALGARME required, along with the monthly fee \n7  for each type of assistance.  Ms. ALGARME read and reasonably understood \n8  BROOKDALE’s representations as statements that BROOKDALE would perform \n9  assessments to determine needed services and would staff the facility in a manner that \n10  would allow it to consistently provide the services that BROOKDALE promised and for \n11  which Ms. ALGARME was paying.  Ms. ALGARME relied on these representations in \n12  making the decision to move into BROOKDALE Brookhurst and to pay BROOKDALE \n13  the monthly fees.  BROOKDALE did not disclose to Ms. ALGARME at any time prior to \n14  her move-in nor has it disclosed since that time that its corporate policy and procedure of \n15  providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing \n16  the care and services residents have been promised, and places all residents at a substantial \n17  risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day.  If \n18  BROOKDALE had disclosed this material fact to Ms. ALGARME, she would have looked \n19  for another facility and would not have agreed to pay the rates charged by BROOKDALE. \n20  181.  BROOKDALE currently charges Ms. ALGARME a Basic Service Rate of \n21  $3,964.00 per month, plus $79.00 per month for basic TV service, plus a Personal Service \n22  Rate of $874.00, which is supposed to cover physical assistance with transfers into the \n23  bathroom and shower, assistance with dressing, and  assistance with showering. \n24  182.  Ms. ALGARME is an electric wheelchair user.  She has Brown-Séquard \n25  Syndrome, a rare neurological condition characterized by a lesion in the spinal cord which \n26  results in weakness or paralysis (hemiparaplegia) on one side of the body and a loss of \n27  sensation (hemianesthesia) on the opposite side.  She also has lumbar spinal stenosis.  Due \n28  to these conditions, Ms. ALGARME requires “hands-on assistance” with dressing and \n  69  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 71 of 110\n \n1  grooming.  Ms. ALGARME has paid for those personal services throughout her time \n2  living at BROOKDALE Brookhurst, but has not been consistently provided that \n3  assistance. \n4  183.  Ms. Algarme has paid for hands-on assistance with showering twice per \n5  week since she moved into BROOKDALE Brookhurst.  In the beginning of her time there, \n6  staff would assist her by wheeling her into the restroom and assisting her with transferring \n7  into the shower, before assisting her in the shower.  Several months into her stay at \n8  BROOKDALE Brookhurst, a BROOKDALE staff member informed Ms. ALGARME that \n9  BROOKDALE would no longer be able to assist her with transferring into the bathroom \n10  and into her shower, because she did not pay a special rate for “transport” services.  The \n11  staff member also informed Ms. ALGARME that BROOKDALE instructed staff to time \n12  Ms. ALGARME’s showers because they thought her showers took too long, and \n13  BROOKDALE wanted to charge her more money.  Ms. ALGARME was then forced to \n14  use an aluminum walker to get herself into the restroom, and then step over the threshold \n15  of her shower to get in, before receiving assistance with showering.  Given her disability, \n16  this was difficult for her, and she was unstable, making her concerned that she would fall.  \n17  184.  Ms. ALGARME has also not consistently received the “hands on” assistance \n18  with dressing and grooming that she pays BROOKDALE to provide.  Due to \n19  BROOKDALE’s severe understaffing, Ms. ALGARME frequently has to wait a very long \n20  time before she is able to receive assistance from a staff member to get dressed in the \n21  morning.  On several occasions, Ms. ALGARME has had to wait as long as one and one-\n22  half hours after initially pressing her call button before receiving assistance getting \n23  dressed.  Sometimes by the time staff do respond to help her get dressed, \n24  Ms. ALGARME’s table in the dining room is full and she is not able to eat breakfast with \n25  her social group.  Ms. ALGARME has requested a printout of her pendant calls from \n26  BROOKDALE to verify the wait times, but BROOKDALE staff have ignored her \n27  requests. There are often no staff persons assigned to assist residents on Ms. ALGARME’s \n28  floor, even though Ms. ALGARME was originally informed that there would be one aide \n  70  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 72 of 110\n \n1  assigned per floor.  Usually, a staff person assigned to another floor comes to assist \n2  Ms. ALGARME.  One staff member informed Ms. ALGARME that she could not assist \n3  her with dressing because she was on light duty, and there was no one else available that \n4  day to help Ms. ALGARME get dressed.  She eventually did begrudgingly assist Ms. \n5  ALGARME to dress into her pajamas, given that no other staff were available.  \n6  Frequently, the staff member who assists Ms. ALGARME with dressing in the evenings \n7  does not wait to ensure she is safely settled in her sleeping chair prior to leaving her room, \n8  because she has so many other people to assist.  This causes Ms. ALGARME to fear that \n9  she will fall. Recently, BROOKDALE Brookhurst had to terminate several non-caregiving \n10  staff, so caregivers had to assume non-caregiving tasks such as laundry and housekeeping, \n11  making them less available to help residents.   \n12  185.  Ms. ALGARME has fallen on more than one occasion since she moved into \n13  BROOKDALE Brookhurst.  In approximately May or June 2018, Ms. ALGARME’s legs \n14  gave out and she was not able to stand up, so she fell to the floor while she was in the \n15  restroom.  She was in severe pain because her knee, which had previously been operated \n16  upon, was pressing against the wall.  She repeatedly pushed her BROOKDALE call button \n17  pendant, but no BROOKDALE staff came for at least fifteen minutes.  Eventually she used \n18  her private emergency medical alert pendant, from GreatCall.  The GreatCall staff called \n19  BROOKDALE Brookhurst on her behalf, and a BROOKDALE staff person finally arrived \n20  to her room to assist her.  After the fall, no BROOKDALE staff followed up with \n21  Ms. ALGARME to find out how she was doing.  Ms. ALGARME does not wish to pay for \n22  the additional expense of the GreatCall medical alert system, given that BROOKDALE is \n23  supposed to provide prompt staff assistance when she presses her BROOKDALE call \n24  pendant, but she has decided to continue paying for GreatCall due to fears that \n25  BROOKDALE staff will not be responsive in an emergency.   \n26  186.  Ms. ALGARME has spoken to the Executive Director of BROOKDALE \n27  Brookhurst regarding the non-responsiveness of staff when she presses her BROOKDALE \n28  pendant, but the Executive Director has told Ms. ALGARME that she is pressing the \n  71  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 73 of 110\n \n1  pendant too much, and that it is “only for emergencies.”  When Ms. ALGARME was \n2  signing the paperwork prior to moving into BROOKDALE Brookhurst, she was never \n3  informed in writing or orally that there was a limit on use of the call pendant, and in fact \n4  during the sales pitch, BROOKDALE informed her that she could “use it whenever you \n5  want.” \n6  187.  Ms. ALGARME also fell on three occasions in early December, 2018.   On \n7  the first occasion, a caregiver was not present in the room with her while she was standing \n8  at her bathroom sink, and the brakes were not set on her wheelchair, so she fell as she \n9  attempted to sit down.  The caregiver inaccurately stated to the Medical Technician that \n10  she was present in the room with Ms. ALGARME.  On the second occasion, Ms. \n11  ALGARME fell on the way back from the bathroom early in the morning.  BROOKDALE \n12  staff came to assist her in getting into her transport wheelchair, but then left her in the \n13  transport for half an hour, because no staff was available to transfer her back into her sleep \n14  chair until the change of shift.  BROOKDALE offered to bring Ms. ALGARME her \n15  breakfast in her room that day, but said she would be charged $13.00.  On the third \n16  occasion, Ms. ALGARME fell while transferring to her electric wheelchair with a \n17  caregiver. \n18  188.  After this series of falls, Ms. ALGARME was very concerned that she would \n19  continue to fall while attempting to transfer herself in and out of the bathroom and in and \n20  out of the shower, so she  agreed to pay an additional fee for “transport services” that was \n21  not included in her original Personal Service Rate.  These services added an additional \n22  $291 per month to the fees she pays BROOKDALE, and only include “transports” two \n23  times per day into her bathroom.  They do not include any assistance getting to the dining \n24  room or other areas of the facility. \n25  189.  Several parts of  Ms. ALGARME’s room at BROOKDALE Brookhurst are \n26  inaccessible to her as a wheelchair user.  The shower in her room is not  accessible, as it \n27  has a  threshold or lip.  As a result, Ms. ALGARME requires assistance to get into the \n28  shower.  In early December 2018, BROOKDALE did agree to modify Ms. ALGARME’s \n  72  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 74 of 110\n \n1  shower, but there is still a small threshold and it is not possible to wheel into the shower \n2  without tipping Ms. ALGARME’s chair over the threshold. Ms. ALGARME’s family had \n3  to purchase a shower chair, because while there was a shower bench in her shower, it was \n4  not installed evenly, and it was unsafe for her to use since she continually felt as though \n5  she would slip off of it.  The sinks in Ms. ALGARME’s bathroom and kitchen have \n6  cabinets underneath, so Ms. ALGARME cannot roll up to them in her chair.  \n7  Ms. ALGARME pays BROOKDALE for a room that includes an outside balcony, but she \n8  is not able to use her balcony because there is a threshold or lip blocking access to the \n9  balcony with a wheelchair, and the balcony is too narrow to safely fit her electric \n10  wheelchair. \n11  190.  Shortly after she moved into BROOKDALE Brookhurst, Ms. Algarme \n12  attended a meeting with residents and the facility’s Executive Director.  The Executive \n13  Director instructed residents that if they use walkers, they must leave them in the hallway \n14  during meals, and residents who use wheelchairs must transfer to chairs at the dining \n15  tables.  The Executive Director stated that this was BROOKDALE policy and that it \n16  “doesn’t look good” to have many walkers and wheelchairs in the dining room.  \n17  Ms. ALGARME informed the Executive Director that it would be very difficult for her to \n18  transfer to a chair from her wheelchair for meals.  The Executive Director informed her \n19  that “maybe you do not belong in this facility.”  This was extremely distressing to \n20  Ms. ALGARME since she had just uprooted her life to move into BROOKDALE \n21  Brookhurst. \n22  191.  BROOKDALE Brookhurst’s Executive Director also informed residents at a \n23  residents’ meeting that electric wheelchair users cannot use the mechanical lift on the \n24  BROOKDALE van that is used to transport residents, because BROOKDALE’s policy is \n25  that “scooters” are not allowed on the lift.  Ms. ALGARME had to print out paperwork to \n26  prove to BROOKDALE staff that her electric wheelchair was not a scooter.   \n27  192.  BROOKDALE staff has asked Ms. ALGARME for records of her physical \n28  therapy services, which she receives in her room through a private physical therapy \n  73  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 75 of 110\n \n1  provider, and pays for with her Medicare coverage.  Ms. ALGARME did not feel \n2  comfortable providing these records to BROOKDALE, as they were not necessary for \n3  BROOKDALE to provide the services Ms. ALGARME purportedly receives from \n4  BROOKDALE.  Staff made the request for the records when Ms. ALGARME was eating \n5  in the dining hall, in front of other residents, which made Ms. ALGARME feel very \n6  uncomfortable.  BROOKDALE management told Ms. ALGARME and her family \n7  members that BROOKDALE provides physical therapy services, which Ms. ALGARME \n8  perceives as BROOKDALE attempting to upsell her on additional services. \n9  193.  Ms. ALGARME has complained to management at BROOKDALE \n10  Brookhurst about these issues on several occasions, but generally, Ms. ALGARME has not \n11  seen significant improvement.  In fact, after Ms. ALGARME protested to the Executive \n12  Director that she would not be able to safely transfer out of her wheelchair for meals, the \n13  Executive Director informed her that she had “heard” Ms. ALGARME was over-using her \n14  call pendant, and that she should only use it for emergencies.  Because BROOKDALE had \n15  never informed her of any limits on the allowed use of the call pendant, Ms. ALGARME \n16  felt that this comment was in retaliation for Ms. ALGARME’s complaints regarding \n17  transfers out of her wheelchair at mealtime.   \n18  194.  Ms. ALGARME has noticed a decline in the quality of food since she moved \n19  into BROOKDALE Brookhurst.  The fruits are often canned instead of fresh, and the \n20  vegetables are so over-cooked that it is impossible to tell whether they were fresh or \n21  canned.  Meats are often highly processed, and many hot meals are covered in sauces to \n22  hide the low quality of the meat and produce. \n23  195.  Since Ms. ALGARME has resided at BROOKDALE Brookhurst, \n24  BROOKDALE has never disclosed that its staffing policies and procedures preclude it \n25  from providing its residents all of the care and services they have been promised and \n26  places all residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the care and \n27  services they have paid for on any given day.  If BROOKDALE had disclosed this material \n28  fact to Ms. ALGARME, she would have looked for another assisted living facility. \n  74  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 76 of 110\n \n1  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n2  196.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all \n3  persons similarly situated and seek class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \n4  Procedure 23(b)(2) and/or (b)(3) as set forth below. \n5  197.  Class Definitions. \n6  Plaintiffs STACIA STINER, HELEN CARLSON, LAWRENCE QUINLAN; \n7  EDWARD BORIS; RALPH SCHMIDT; PATRICIA LINDSTROM as successor-in-\n8  interest to the Estate of ARTHUR LINDSTROM; BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART; and \n9  JEANETTE ALGARME seek to represent the following three classes: \n10  RESIDENTS WITH MOBILITY OR VISUAL DISABILITIES CLASS:  All \n11  persons with disabilities who use wheelchairs, scooters, canes or other mobility aids \n12  or who have visual disabilities and who reside or have resided at a residential care \n13  facility for the elderly located in California and owned, operated and/or managed by \n14  BROOKDALE during the CLASS PERIOD, including their successors-in-interest \n15  if deceased. \n16  RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES CLASS: All persons with disabilities who \n17  require assistance with activities of daily living and who reside or have resided at a \n18  residential care facility for the elderly located in California and owned, operated \n19  and/or managed by BROOKDALE during the CLASS PERIOD, including their \n20  successors-in-interest if deceased. \n21  FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS CLASS: All persons who resided or \n22  reside at one of the residential care facilities for the elderly located in California and \n23  owned, operated, and/or managed by BROOKDALE during the CLASS PERIOD \n24  and who contracted with BROOKDALE or another assisted living facility for \n25  services for which BROOKDALE was paid money, including their successors-in-\n26  interest if deceased. \n27  198.  The CLASS PERIOD is defined as commencing three years prior to the \n28  filing of this action for the RESIDENTS WITH MOBILITY OR VISUAL DISABILITIES \n  75  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 77 of 110\n \n1  CLASS and commencing on May 16, 2015 for the RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES \n2  CLASS and the FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS CLASS. \n3  199.  Excluded from the above-referenced class are the officers, directors, and \n4  employees of BROOKDALE, and any of Defendants’ shareholders or other persons who \n5  hold a financial interest in BROOKDALE.  Also excluded is any judge assigned to hear \n6  this case (or any spouse or family member of any assigned judge), or any juror selected to \n7  hear this case. \n8  200.  This action is brought as a class action and may properly be so maintained \n9  pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and applicable case law.  In addition to \n10  declaratory and injunctive relief, this action seeks class-wide damages pursuant to \n11  California Civil Code § 52(a) in the amount of $4,000 per class member based on \n12  Defendants’ wrongful policy and practice of failing to provide residents with disabilities \n13  with full and equal access to and enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities, privileges, \n14  and/or advantages of BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities as alleged herein.  It also \n15  seeks class-wide statutory and punitive damages based on Defendants’ misrepresentations, \n16  misleading statements, and material omissions, including $5,000 per class member \n17  pursuant to California Civil Code § 1780(b). This action also seeks treble damages \n18  pursuant to both California Civil Code § 52(a) and California Civil Code § 3345(b)(2) and \n19  (3).  This action does not seek recovery for personal injuries or emotional distress that may \n20  have been caused by Defendants’ conduct alleged herein. \n21  201.  Ascertainability.  Members of the proposed Class are identifiable and \n22  ascertainable.  BROOKDALE retains admission contracts, resident service plans, and \n23  billing statements for all persons who currently reside or resided at BROOKDALE \n24  facilities during the CLASS PERIOD. \n25  202.  Impracticability of Joinder (Numerosity of the Class).  The members of \n26  the proposed class are so numerous that joinder of all such persons is impracticable and the \n27  disposition of their claims in a class action is a benefit both to the parties and to this Court.  \n28  On information and belief, the number of persons in this case exceeds 5,000 persons.  The \n  76  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 78 of 110\n \n1  number of persons in the class and their identities and addresses may be ascertained from \n2  Defendants’ records. \n3  203.  Questions of Fact and Law Common to the Class.  All members of the \n4  class have been and continue to be denied their civil rights to full and equal access to, and \n5  use and enjoyment of, the services and facilities operated by the BROOKDALE because of \n6  the violations of disability nondiscrimination laws, the CLRA, and Elder Abuse laws \n7  alleged herein.  There are numerous questions of law and fact common to the class, \n8  including, but not limited to, the following: \n9  a.  Whether BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities are public \n10  accommodations within the meaning of Title III of the ADA; \n11  b.  Whether BROOKDALE and its assisted living facilities are business \n12  establishments within the meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act; \n13  c.  Whether BROOKDALE constructed or altered any of its assisted \n14  living facilities after January 26, 1993; \n15  d.  Whether BROOKDALE’s facilities that were newly constructed or \n16  altered between January 26, 1993 and March 15, 2012 comply with \n17  the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility \n18  Guidelines; \n19  e.

Whether BROOKDALE’s facilities that were constructed or altered \n22  after March 15, 2012 comply with the 2010 ADA Standards for \n23  Accessible Design; \n24  g.  Whether BROOKDALE has removed physical access barriers where \n25  doing so was readily achievable as required by Title III of the ADA; \n26  h.  Whether Plaintiffs are being denied full and equal access to and \n27  enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s goods, services, facilities, privileges, \n28  advantages or accommodations; \n  77  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 79 of 110\n \n1  i.  Whether Plaintiffs requested that BROOKDALE make reasonable \n2  modifications in policies, practices and/or procedures by providing its \n3  facilities with a sufficient number of adequately trained staff to ensure \n4  that residents with disabilities receive full and equal access to and \n5  enjoyment of the services specified in BROOKDALE’s own resident \n6  assessments; \n7  j.  Whether Plaintiffs’ requested modification in policies, practices or \n8  procedures is reasonable; \n9  k.  Whether Plaintiffs’ requested modification in policies, practices or \n10  procedures is necessary to ensure that residents with disabilities have \n11  full and equal access to and enjoyment of BROOKDALE’s goods, \n12  services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations as \n13  required by Title III of the ADA; \n14  l.  Whether BROOKDALE has provided Plaintiffs with full and equal \n15  access to and enjoyment of its transportation services and activities as \n16  required by Title III of the ADA; \n17  m.  Whether BROOKDALE has provided Plaintiffs with full and equal \n18  access to and enjoyment of its services and facilities with respect to \n19  emergency planning and evacuation; \n20  n.

Whether BROOKDALE has violated and continues to violate the \n25  Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Civil Code §§ 1750 et seq., \n26  by promising residents that it will provide care and services including \n27  those identified by resident assessments, when BROOKDALE knows \n28  that its corporate policy and procedure of providing pre-determined \n  78  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 80 of 110\n \n1  staffing at its facilities precludes BROOKDALE from providing the \n2  care and services residents have been promised and places all \n3  residents at a substantial risk that they will not receive the care and \n4  services they have paid for on any given day; \n5  p.  Whether BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements \n6  and omissions regarding the staffing of its facilities as alleged herein \n7  were and are material to the reasonable consumer; \n8  q.

(“UCL”); \n12  r.  Whether BROOKDALE had exclusive knowledge of material facts \n13  not known or reasonably accessible to the Plaintiffs and the class; \n14  s.  Whether the Plaintiffs, the class, and the consuming public were \n15  likely to be deceived by the foregoing concealment and omission; \n16  t.  Whether the Plaintiffs, the class, and the consuming public have a \n17  reasonable expectation that BROOKDALE will provide staffing at its \n18  facilities to meet the aggregate care needs of the residents at its \n19  facilities; \n20  u.  Whether BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, its misleading \n21  statements, its failures to disclose and its concealment of its true \n22  policies, procedures, and practices regarding how it staffs its facilities \n23  violated the CLRA and the UCL; \n24  v.  Whether BROOKDALE has engaged and continues to engage in a \n25  pattern and practice of unfair and deceptive conduct in connection \n26  with the management, administration, and operation of its California \n27  assisted living facilities; \n28  w.  Whether BROOKDALE has violated and continues to violate the \n  79  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 81 of 110\n \n1  UCL by violating the CLRA, ADA, Unruh Civil Rights Act, \n2  California Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.30, and Cal. Health \n3  & Safety Code §§ 1569.157 and 1569.158 during the CLASS \n4  PERIOD; \n5  x.  Whether BROOKDALE has committed financial elder abuse under \n6  California Welfare and Institutions Code § 15610.30 by taking, \n7  secreting, appropriating, obtaining, and/or retaining money from \n8  elders and dependent adults for a wrongful use and/or with the intent \n9  to defraud them; \n10  y.  Whether the Plaintiffs and the putative class members have been \n11  injured; \n12  z.  Whether the Plaintiffs and the members of the putative class are \n13  entitled to damages, and the nature of such damages; and, \n14  aa.  Whether the Plaintiffs and the members of the putative class are \n15  entitled to declaratory and/or injunctive relief, and the nature of such \n16  relief. \n17  204.  Typicality.  The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the \n18  proposed classes.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed classes in the \n19  following ways: 1) Plaintiffs are members of the proposed classes; 2) Plaintiffs’ claims \n20  arise from the same uniform corporate policies, procedures, practices and course of \n21  conduct on the part of BROOKDALE; 3) Plaintiffs’ claims are based on the same legal \n22  and remedial theories as those of the proposed classes and involve similar factual \n23  circumstances; 4) the injuries suffered by the named Plaintiffs are similar to the injuries \n24  suffered by the proposed class members; and 5) the relief sought herein will benefit the \n25  named Plaintiffs and all class members alike. \n26  205.  Adequacy.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the \n27  interests of the classes.  They have no interests adverse to the interests of other members of \n28  the class and have retained counsel who are competent and experienced in litigating \n  80  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 82 of 110\n \n1  complex class actions, including large-scale disability rights and senior care class action \n2  cases. \n3  206.  Predominance.  With respect to Plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA, the \n4  Unruh Civil Rights Act, the CLRA, the UCL, and the Elder Abuse Act, class certification \n5  is appropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) because questions of law or \n6  fact common to the class members predominate over any questions affecting individual \n7  members of the putative classes. \n8  207.  Superiority.  A class action is superior to other methods for the fair and \n9  efficient adjudication of this controversy because, inter alia: 1) individual claims by the \n10  class members would be impracticable because the costs of pursuit of such claims would \n11  far exceed what any individual class member has at stake; 2) relatively little individual \n12  litigation has been commenced over the controversies alleged in this Complaint and \n13  individual class members are unlikely to have an interest in separately prosecuting and \n14  controlling individual actions; 3) the concentration of litigation of these claims in one \n15  forum will achieve efficiency and promote judicial economy; 4) the proposed classes are \n16  manageable, and no difficulties are likely to be encountered in the management of this \n17  class action that would preclude its maintenance as a class action; 5) the proposed class \n18  members are readily identifiable from Defendants’ own records; and 6) prosecution of \n19  separate actions by individual members of the proposed class would create the risk of \n20  inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the proposed \n21  classes that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for BROOKDALE. \n22  208.  The Class Meets the Requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23  23(b)(2).  BROOKDALE has acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to \n24  the class, making the declaratory and injunctive relief sought on behalf of the class as a \n25  whole appropriate. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  81  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 83 of 110\n \n1  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.) \n2  (On behalf of Plaintiffs, the RESIDENTS WITH MOBILITY OR VISION \nDISABILITIES CLASS and the RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES CLASS) \n3   \n4  209.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the \n5  preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n6  210.  Congress enacted the ADA upon finding, among other things, that “society \n7  has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities” and that such forms of \n8  discrimination continue to be a “serious and pervasive social problem.” 42 U.S.C. \n9  § 12101(a) (2). \n10  211.  Congress explicitly stated that the purpose of the ADA is to provide “a clear \n11  and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against \n12  individuals with disabilities” and “clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards \n13  addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1)-\n14  (2). \n15  212.  Title III of the ADA provides in pertinent part: “[N]o individual shall be \n16  discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the \n17  goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of \n18  public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or leases to, or operates a place of \n19  public accommodation.”  42 U.S.C. § 12182. \n20  213.  At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiffs STACIA STINER, HELEN \n21  CARLSON, LAWRENCE QUINLAN; EDWARD BORIS; RALPH SCHMIDT; \n22  ARTHUR LINDSTROM; BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART; and JEANETTE ALGARME \n23  were and remain qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA. \n24  214.  Defendants are each a “private entity,” as defined under 42 U.S.C. \n25  § 12181(6).  They own, operate and/or manage approximately 89 assisted living facilities \n26  in California.  \n27  215.  Brookdale’s assisted living facilities provide services to its residents, \n28  including but not limited to, assistance with managing and taking medication, \n  82  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 84 of 110\n \n1  housekeeping, laundry, dressing, bathing, toileting, hygiene, food preparation, and \n2  transportation.  BROOKDALE staff include caregivers, certified nursing assistants \n3  (CNAs), and a licensed nurse working in the facility or on-call 24 hours per day, seven \n4  days per week, to allow ongoing monitoring of residents’ health status.  These facilities are \n5  “public accommodations” pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7).  BROOKDALE is subject to \n6  Title III of the ADA and its corresponding regulations. \n7  216.  As alleged above in greater detail, BROOKDALE has violated Title III of \n8  the ADA in the following ways. \n9  Failure to Provide Reasonable Modifications in \nStaffing Policies, Practices and Procedures \n10   \n11  217.  BROOKDALE has a policy and practice of staffing its assisted living \n12  facilities based on pre-set corporate labor budgets and profit margins without regard for \n13  residents’ needs.  BROOKDALE’s policy and practice of understaffing its assisted living \n14  facilities in order to minimize its labor expenses and maximize its corporate profits has \n15  resulted in facilities that are chronically understaffed, and in which skeletal levels of \n16  staffing make it commonplace for residents with disabilities to go without the services, \n17  goods, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations for which they have paid.  For \n18  example, staff are often unavailable or unable to assist residents with disabilities with \n19  activities of daily living including, inter alia, bathing, showering, toileting, transferring, \n20  taking medications, dressing, dining, and housekeeping.  In addition, residents with \n21  disabilities are often denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of social and \n22  recreational activities, as well as transportation to off-site locations for appointments and \n23  other activities, because of the lack of a sufficient number of trained staff to assist residents \n24  with disabilities to participate in these activities. \n25  218.  Plaintiffs have requested that BROOKDALE make reasonable modifications \n26  in policies, practices, or procedures as required by Title III of the ADA.  Plaintiffs have \n27  requested that BROOKDALE provides its facilities with a sufficient number of adequately \n28  trained staff to ensure that residents with disabilities are provided with full and equal \n  83  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 85 of 110\n \n1  access to and enjoyment of the services specified in BROOKDALE’s own resident \n2  assessments.  Among other things, and without limitation, BROOKDALE should increase \n3  its level of trained staff in its assisted living facilities such that residents with disabilities \n4  are not required to wait for more than five minutes for a substantive response to their call \n5  pendants.  A substantive response means actual action taken to address the resident’s need, \n6  rather than a staff member passing by the resident’s room to say that they will return later. \n7  219.  Such reasonable modifications in BROOKDALE’s policies, practices and \n8  procedures are necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs and the members of the putative \n9  Residents with Disabilities Class receive full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n10  BROOKDALE’s services, including assistance with, inter alia, bathing, showering, \n11  toileting, transferring, taking medications, dressing, dining, and housekeeping.  In addition, \n12  such modifications are necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs and the members of the putative \n13  Residents with Disabilities Class have full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n14  BROOKDALE’s social and recreational activities, and transportation to off-site locations \n15  for appointments and other activities.  Unless and until BROOKDALE makes this \n16  requested reasonable modification in policies, practices, and procedures, Plaintiffs and the \n17  members of the putative Residents with Disabilities Class will continue to be denied full \n18  and equal access to and enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities, privileges, advantages \n19  and accommodations that BROOKDALE claims to provide to all of its residents, whether \n20  disabled or nondisabled. \n21  220.  Plaintiffs’ requested modification in policies, practices or procedures is \n22  eminently reasonable in that BROOKDALE already charges residents with disabilities for, \n23  and residents with disabilities pay to receive, the services specified in BROOKDALE’s \n24  own resident agreements and resident assessments, including inter alia, assistance with \n25  activities of daily living such as mobility, bathing, showering, toileting, transferring, taking \n26  medications, dressing, dining, and housekeeping, as well as participating in \n27  BROOKDALE’s social and recreational activities whether on-site or off-site. \n28  221.  The requested modification in policies, practices or procedures will not make \n  84  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 86 of 110\n \n1  any alteration (much less a fundamental alteration) in the nature of BROOKDALE’s goods \n2  and services.  Rather, Plaintiffs merely seek to ensure that BROOKDALE provides a \n3  sufficient number of adequately trained staff to provide its residents with disabilities with \n4  full and equal access to and enjoyment of the types of services and goods that \n5  BROOKDALE already promises to provide to its residents in its normal course of \n6  business.  Thus, the requested reasonable modification in policy, practice or procedure \n7  would not change the nature or type of services and goods that BROOKDALE sells to the \n8  public. \n9  222.  The requested reasonable modification would impose only a minimal burden \n10  on BROOKDALE.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that the staff who provide \n11  BROOKDALE’s services are hourly employees who are paid just over California’s \n12  minimum wage rate.  Increasing BROOKDALE’s skeletal night staffing and its minimal \n13  level of daytime staffing will only result in a moderate increase in BROOKDALE’s labor \n14  budget.  BROOKDALE will continue to be able to realize substantial gross profits each \n15  year in the multibillion dollar range. \n16  223.  Plaintiffs have repeatedly requested that BROOKDALE make reasonable \n17  modifications in policies, practices, or procedures by increasing the number of trained staff \n18  that it provides in its facilities.  Notwithstanding the reasonableness and necessity of such \n19  modifications, and notwithstanding the fact that BROOKDALE could significantly \n20  increase its staffing without changing the nature of its services, goods, facilities, privileges, \n21  advantages or accommodations, and could make such modifications without undue \n22  financial or administrative burdens, BROOKDALE has failed and refused to make any \n23  such modifications. \n24  224.  Plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA and the Unruh Act based on \n25  BROOKDALE’s failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or \n26  procedures in staffing policies and practices are limited to circumstances and facts \n27  occurring on or after May 16, 2015. \n28 \n  85  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 87 of 110\n \n1  Physical Access Barriers \n2  225.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that many of Defendants’ facilities \n3  were designed and constructed after January 26, 1993, thus triggering access requirements \n4  under Title III of the ADA.  The ADA prohibits designing and constructing facilities for \n5  first occupancy after January 26, 1993 that are not readily accessible to and usable by \n6  individuals with disabilities when it was structurally practicable to do so.  42 U.S.C. \n7  § 12183(a)(1).  BROOKDALE has violated the ADA by designing and constructing their \n8  facilities in a manner that does not comply with federal disability access design standards \n9  including the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (“ADAAG”) and \n10  the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (“2010 ADA Standards”) even though it \n11  was structurally practicable to do so. \n12  226.  Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that Defendants’ facilities were \n13  altered after January 26, 1993, thus triggering access requirements under Title III of the \n14  ADA.  The ADA prohibits altering facilities after January 26, 1993 in a manner that is not \n15  readily accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities when it was structurally \n16  practicable to do so.  42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(2).  Here, Defendants violated the ADA by \n17  altering its assisted living facilities after January 26, 1993 in a manner that did not comply \n18  with the ADAAG or the 2010 ADA Standards even though it was structurally practicable \n19  to do so.  Specifically, Defendants have failed to ensure that the areas of alteration \n20  complied with the ADAAG or the 2010 ADA Standards, and that the path of travel to the \n21  areas of alteration complied with the ADAAG or the 2010 ADA Standards. \n22  227.  Additionally, Defendants have failed to remove physical access barriers in \n23  their facilities which existed prior to January 26, 1993 when removal of those barriers was \n24  “readily achievable,” in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv). \n25  228.  The removal of each of the barriers complained of by Plaintiffs herein was at \n26  all times “readily achievable” under the standards of §§ 12181 and 12182 of the ADA.  \n27  BROOKDALE could have removed each of the barriers alleged herein without much \n28  difficulty or expense within the meaning of Title III.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, \n  86  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 88 of 110\n \n1  BROOKDALE has failed and refused to do so. \n2  Transportation and Activities \n3  229.  BROOKDALE has violated Title III of the ADA by failing and refusing to \n4  provide Plaintiffs with full and equal access to and enjoyment of its transportation services \n5  to off-site activities and appointments.  BROOKDALE has a policy and practice of \n6  limiting the number of wheelchair users who may use transportation to off-site activities.  \n7  This limitation is not imposed on residents who do not use wheelchairs.  In addition, \n8  BROOKDALE has required residents with mobility disabilities to transfer from their \n9  wheelchairs into the seats in its shuttles, and has not permitted residents to remain in their \n10  wheelchairs.  BROOKDALE has done so despite the fact that many residents with \n11  mobility disabilities have great difficulty in transferring from their wheelchairs into the \n12  passenger seats in shuttles, and doing so is time consuming, physically exhausting and \n13  sometimes dangerous.  Further, on numerous occasions residents with mobility disabilities \n14  have been completely denied access to medical appointments, and other off-site \n15  appointments and activities, because BROOKDALE has failed to provide any accessible \n16  transportation to those appointments and activities. \n17  Evacuation Procedures \n18  230.  BROOKDALE has failed to provide or communicate to its residents with \n19  disabilities any specific or definitive emergency evacuation plan in the event of \n20  earthquake, fire or other emergency.  Defendants’ failure to do so constitutes a denial of \n21  full and equal access to and enjoyment of the services and facilities provided by \n22  BROOKDALE in violation of Title III of the ADA.  Many of BROOKDALE’s residents \n23  with disabilities are unable to exit the building without assistance from staff.  While some \n24  residents have been advised to remain in their rooms in the event of an emergency, in those \n25  instances in which an alarm has sounded, no one has come to their rooms to assist them or \n26  to inform them as to whether there is an emergency or just a drill. \n27  231.  The acts and omissions alleged herein constitute violations of Title III of the \n28  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181 et seq., and the regulations \n  87  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 89 of 110\n \n1  promulgated thereunder.  Defendants’ discriminatory conduct alleged herein includes, \n2  inter alia: \n3  a.  Failing to provide residents with disabilities the opportunity to \n4  participate in or benefit from BROOKDALE’s goods, services, \n5  facilities, privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations at its \n6  assisted living facilities in California, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \n7  § 12182(b)(1)(A)(i); \n8  b.  Failing to provide residents with disabilities the opportunity to \n9  participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, \n10  advantages and/or accommodations that are equal to that afforded to \n11  individuals without disabilities, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \n12  § 12182(b)(1)(A)(ii); \n13  c.  Failing to provide the goods, services, facilities, privileges, \n14  advantages, and/or accommodations at its assisted living facilities in \n15  California to residents with disabilities in the most integrated setting \n16  possible, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(B); \n17  d.  Utilizing standards, criteria and methods of administration that have \n18  the effect of discriminating against residents on the basis of their \n19  disabilities, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(D); \n20  e.  Imposing eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out \n21  residents with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying \n22  BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities’ goods, services, facilities, \n23  privileges, advantages, and/or accommodations, in violation of 42 \n24  U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(i); \n25  f.  Failing to make reasonable modifications in its policies, practices, and \n26  procedures which are necessary for its residents with disabilities to \n27  enjoy and access BROOKDALE’s assisted living facilities’ goods, \n28  services, facilities, privileges, advantages and/or accommodations, in \n  88  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 90 of 110\n \n1  violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); \n2  g.  Failing to remove architectural barriers in those facilities constructed \n3  prior to January 26, 1993 and not altered after that date where such \n4  removal is readily achievable, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \n5  § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv); \n6  h.  Failing to design and construct facilities first occupied after January \n7  26, 1993 such that they are readily accessible to and usable by persons \n8  with disabilities, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1); \n9  i.  Performing alterations after January 26, 1993 that affect the usability \n10  of its facilities or a part of its facilities, while failing to ensure that the \n11  altered portions and the path of travel to those altered portions are \n12  readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, in \n13  violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(2); and \n14  j.  Failing to operate BROOKDALE’s transportation services such that \n15  they ensure a level of service to persons with disabilities that is \n16  equivalent to that provided to persons without disabilities, in violation \n17  of 42 U.S.C. § 12182)(b)(2)(C)(i). \n18  232.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiffs have \n19  suffered, and continue to suffer irreparable harm including humiliation, hardship and \n20  anxiety due to Defendants’ failure to provide full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n21  Defendants’ facilities, services, goods, privileges, advantages and/or accommodations. \n22  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n23  declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses \n24  incurred in bringing this action. \n25  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq.) \n26  (On behalf of Plaintiffs, the RESIDENTS WITH MOBILITY OR VISION \nDISABILITIES CLASS and the RESIDENTS WITH DISABILITIES CLASS) \n27   \n28  233.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the \n  89  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 91 of 110\n \n1  preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n2  234.  California Civil Code § 51(b) provides in pertinent part that “All persons \n3  within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their…disability \n4  or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, \n5  facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.” \n6  235.  Pursuant to California Civil Code § 51(f), a violation of the ADA also \n7  constitutes a violation of California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq. \n8  236.  Defendants own, operate and/or manage business establishments within the \n9  meaning of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.  Defendants are each a public accommodation \n10  whose services and facilities are open to the general public. \n11  237.  Defendants provide services, privileges, advantages and accommodations to \n12  the general public.  Defendants have failed and refused to provide Plaintiffs with full and \n13  equal access to and enjoyment of the benefits of their goods, services, facilities, benefits, \n14  advantages, and accommodations, and have done so by reason of Plaintiffs’ disabilities. \n15  238.  Defendants have discriminated against persons with disabilities in violation \n16  of California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq. by failing to operate their facilities and services in \n17  full compliance with the requirements of the ADA as set forth above. \n18  239.  Defendants, by their actions and inactions alleged in this Complaint, have \n19  directly discriminated against persons with disabilities. \n20  240.  Plaintiffs’ claims under the Unruh Act based on BROOKDALE’s failure to \n21  make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures in staffing policies and \n22  practices are limited to circumstances and facts occurring on or after May 16, 2015. \n23  241.  The actions of Defendants were and are in violation of the Unruh Civil \n24  Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 51 et seq., and therefore Plaintiffs are also entitled to \n25  statutory damages, injunctive relief and reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. \n26  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n27  declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses \n28  incurred in bringing this action. \n  90  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 92 of 110\n \n1  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750 et seq.) \n2  (On behalf of Plaintiffs and the FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENT CLASS) \n3  242.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the \n4  preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n5  243.  Plaintiffs and the members of the putative False or Misleading Statements \n6  Class are “consumer[s]” within the meaning of California Civil Code § 1761(d).  They are \n7  also “senior citizen[s]” and/or “[d]isabled person[s]” within the meaning of California \n8  Civil Code § 1761(f) and (g). \n9  244.  Defendants are each a “person” as defined under California Civil Code \n10  § 1761(c).  The assisted living services that Defendants have promised to provide Plaintiffs \n11  are “[s]ervices” within the meaning of the California Civil Code § 1761(b).  The \n12  agreement by Defendants to provide assisted living services in return for payment of \n13  monthly fees by each of the Plaintiffs constitutes a “transaction” under California Civil \n14  Code § 1761(e). \n15  245.  In Defendants’ uniform resident contracts presented to prospective residents \n16  and their family members, Defendants represented and continue to represent that \n17  BROOKDALE will assess each resident and provide the basic services, personal services, \n18  and select and therapeutic services it has determined are needed.  That same representation \n19  is made in BROOKDALE’s re-evaluation of residents, rate increase letters, letters \n20  regarding the merger, letters regarding the conversion to a new personal assessment \n21  system, corporate website statements, invoices, and other standardized corporate \n22  promotional materials.  These uniform corporate representations are false and misleading, \n23  and likely to deceive the reasonable consumer.  As alleged herein, Plaintiffs and the \n24  putative class members reasonably expected based on these representations that \n25  BROOKDALE would provide sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained staff at \n26  its facilities to ensure that all residents receive the services they have been promised and \n27  for which they are paying. \n28  246.  Contrary to its representations regarding the provision of basic services, \n  91  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 93 of 110\n \n1  personal services, and select and therapeutic services, BROOKDALE knows that the \n2  policies and practices it uses to staff its facilities—most notably, its policy and practice of \n3  using predetermined labor budgets designed to meet corporate profit targets, goals, and \n4  margins without regard to residents’ needs—preclude it from providing its residents all of \n5  the care and services they have been promised and places all residents at a substantial risk \n6  that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day.  \n7  BROOKDALE did not intend to provide and has no intention of providing sufficient levels \n8  of qualified and adequately trained staff at its facilities to ensure that all residents receive \n9  these services.  BROOKDALE does not disclose and conceals this material fact from the \n10  residents, their family members, and the general public. \n11  247.  The named Plaintiffs, their family members and powers of attorney, the \n12  putative class members, and reasonable consumers considered material BROOKDALE’s \n13  misrepresentations and misleading statements that it will provide residents the basic \n14  services, personal services, and select and therapeutic services they need and for which \n15  they are paying.  If the named Plaintiffs had known the true facts about BROOKDALE’s \n16  staffing policies and procedures, they would not have agreed to enter or stay in a \n17  BROOKDALE facility or to place their relatives in a BROOKDALE facility, or would \n18  have paid less money.  If the putative class members had known the true facts, they would \n19  in all reasonable probability not have agreed to enter or remain in a BROOKDALE facility \n20  or to place their relatives in a BROOKDALE facility, or would have paid less money to \n21  BROOKDALE. \n22  248.  The facts that BROOKDALE misrepresents, fails to disclose and actively \n23  conceals are material and are likely to deceive the reasonable consumer.  Reasonable \n24  consumers, including the residents and their family members herein, consider of great \n25  importance the staffing levels provided by the assisted living facility they select, and such \n26  consumers also attach great importance to BROOKDALE’s claims regarding its provision \n27  of basic services, personal services, and select and therapeutic services. \n28  249.  Residents and their family members would consider material \n  92  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 94 of 110\n \n1  BROOKDALE’s uniform corporate policy and procedure of basing its staffing on fixed \n2  budgets and profit margins resulting in staffing that is inadequate to meet residents’ needs, \n3  as identified by BROOKDALE itself through periodic personal service assessments.  \n4  Residents and their family members could not reasonably have been expected to learn or \n5  discover these non-disclosed facts, and in fact, BROOKDALE has affirmatively concealed \n6  them. \n7  250.  Since May 16, 2015, BROOKDALE has violated and continues to violate \n8  the CLRA, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750 et seq., in at least the following respects: \n9  a.  In violation of § 1770(a)(5), BROOKDALE has misrepresented, \n10  failed to disclose and concealed the true characteristics and/or \n11  quantities of services provided at its facilities in California; \n12  b.  In violation of § 1770(a)(7), BROOKDALE has misrepresented, \n13  failed to disclose and concealed the true standard, quality and/or grade \n14  of services provided at its facilities in California; \n15  c.  In violation of § 1770(a)(9), in BROOKDALE’s standard resident \n16  admission contracts and elsewhere, BROOKDALE has falsely \n17  advertised that it will provide basic services and the assistance \n18  specified by each resident’s personal service assessment and which \n19  corresponds to that resident’s Personal Service Plan, knowing that \n20  BROOKDALE does not intend to provide the services as advertised; \n21  and \n22  d.  In violation of § 1770(a)(14), BROOKDALE has represented that the \n23  agreement signed by residents and/or their responsible parties, and \n24  under which they pay their monthly rate, confers on residents the right \n25  to reside in a facility that provides the basic services, personal \n26  services, and select and therapeutic services that residents have been \n27  promised and are paying for, when in fact, BROOKDALE knows that \n28  the policies and practices it uses to staff its facilities preclude it from \n  93  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 95 of 110\n \n1  providing its residents all of the care and services they have been \n2  promised and places all residents in an inherent and substantial risk \n3  that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on \n4  any given day. \n5  251.  These misrepresentations, misleading statements, acts, practices, and \n6  omissions by BROOKDALE are and were intended to induce and lure elderly and \n7  dependent adult residents and their family members into agreeing to be admitted to \n8  BROOKDALE’s facilities and to pay community and monthly fees. \n9  252.  BROOKDALE made the misrepresentations and misleading statements \n10  alleged herein through various uniform means of communication, including without \n11  limitation, the admission agreement; subsequent agreements based on updated Personal \n12  Service Plans; letters to residents regarding the merger between BROOKDALE and \n13  Emeritus, the implementation of BROOKDALE’s new personal service system, and rate \n14  increases; standardized corporate marketing and promotional materials; Defendants’ \n15  website; invoices; and other written corporate materials disseminated to the public in \n16  connection with Defendants’ services.  These representations and misleading statements \n17  were made directly to the named Plaintiffs, putative class members and their family \n18  members and/or responsible parties by BROOKDALE in the uniform means of \n19  communication listed above. \n20  253.  BROOKDALE failed to disclose and concealed from Plaintiffs, the putative \n21  class members, and their family members, that BROOKDALE staffs its facility using \n22  predetermined labor budgets designed to meet corporate profit targets, goals, and margins \n23  without regard to residents’ needs; that these policies and practices preclude it from \n24  providing its residents all of the care and services they have been promised and places all \n25  residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services \n26  they have paid for on any given day; and that BROOKDALE did not intend to provide and \n27  has no intention of providing sufficient qualified and adequately trained staff at its \n28  facilities to ensure that all residents receive these services. \n  94  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 96 of 110\n \n1  254.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge of materials facts not \n2  known to the named Plaintiffs, class members or the general public at the time of the \n3  subject transactions and actively concealed those material facts. \n4  255.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge that its corporate \n5  policy and procedure of providing pre-determined staffing at its facilities preclude \n6  BROOKDALE from providing the care and services for which it charges its residents and \n7  places all residents at a substantial risk that on any given day they will not receive the care \n8  and services for which they have paid.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior \n9  knowledge that its policies and procedures for staffing its facilities pose a heightened \n10  health and safety risk to the named Plaintiffs and class members.  Defendants intentionally \n11  concealed, suppressed and/or failed to disclose the true facts with the intent to defraud the \n12  named Plaintiffs and putative class members.  The named Plaintiffs and putative class \n13  members did not know these material undisclosed facts and could not reasonably have \n14  been expected to discover them. \n15  256.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs, the class \n16  members, and members of the general public (including without limitation persons \n17  admitted to and/or residing in the facilities, and their family members and/or responsible \n18  parties) have been harmed and continue to be harmed.  Among other things, they paid \n19  money to Defendants to enter the facilities and/or for services that were not provided or \n20  that were substandard to those promised by Defendants. \n21  257.  Plaintiffs sent BROOKDALE a notice to cure under California Civil Code \n22  § 1782(a), which was received by BROOKDALE on June 6, 2017.  More than 30 days \n23  have passed since BROOKDALE’s receipt, and BROOKDALE has not corrected or \n24  remedied the violations alleged in the notice and herein.   \n25  258.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs and the False or Misleading Statements Class \n26  members are entitled to no less than $1,000 in statutory damages pursuant to California \n27  Civil Code § 1780(a).  Moreover, as senior citizens and/or disabled persons, Plaintiffs and \n28  the False or Misleading Statements Class members are also entitled to statutory damages \n  95  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 97 of 110\n \n1  of $5,000 per class member pursuant to California Civil Code § 1780(b), as well as actual \n2  damages and restitution in an amount to be proven at trial.   \n3  259.  Plaintiffs and each of the putative False or Misleading Statements Class \n4  members are seniors and/or disabled persons as defined by California Civil Code § 1761(f) \n5  and (g).  Plaintiffs and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members have \n6  each suffered substantial economic harm.  Defendants knew that their conduct negatively \n7  impacted seniors and disabled persons.  Defendants’ conduct caused the named Plaintiffs \n8  and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members to lose property set aside \n9  for personal care and maintenance and assets essential to their health and welfare.  Further, \n10  Plaintiffs and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members are substantially \n11  more vulnerable than other members of the public to Defendants’ conduct because of their \n12  age, poor health, impaired understanding, restricted mobility and/or disabilities. \n13  260.  Plaintiffs additionally seek treble damages under California Civil Code \n14  § 3345, punitive damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, and all other relief the \n15  Court deems just and proper.  Excluded from Plaintiffs’ request are damages related to any \n16  personal injuries, emotional distress or wrongful death suffered by any member of the \n17  class. \n18  261.  Defendants’ conduct presents a continuing threat of substantial harm to the \n19  public in that, among other things, Defendants continue to make misleading statements \n20  about and conceal material facts about whether and how they provide basic, personal care, \n21  and select and therapeutic services at BROOKDALE facilities in California, as well as the \n22  fact that their staffing policies and procedures preclude them from providing residents the \n23  services they have been promised.  Despite these misrepresentations, BROOKDALE \n24  continues to induce elderly and vulnerable citizens to enter and remain in its facilities, \n25  which conduct irreparably harms Plaintiffs and the putative False or Misleading \n26  Statements Class.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek an injunction that requires that \n27  BROOKDALE immediately cease the CLRA violations alleged herein regarding \n28  BROOKDALE’s misrepresentations, misleading statements, and material omissions, and \n  96  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 98 of 110\n \n1  to enjoin it from continuing to engage in any such acts or practices in the future.  \n2  Specifically, Plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring BROOKDALE to disclose to Plaintiffs, \n3  the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members and the consuming public that \n4  BROOKDALE’s staffing policies and procedures preclude it from providing its residents \n5  the care and services they have been promised and places all residents at an inherent and \n6  substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any \n7  given day.  Plaintiffs also seek an injunction prohibiting BROOKDALE from charging \n8  residents or their responsible parties monthly fees based on their Personal Service Plans \n9  until BROOKDALE implements staffing policies and procedures that enable it to deliver \n10  those services on a consistent basis. \n11  262.  Plaintiffs claims for violations of the CLRA are limited to \n12  misrepresentations, misleading statements, and failures to disclose that occurred on or after \n13  May 16, 2015. \n14  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n15  declaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses \n16  incurred in bringing this action. \n17  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Elder Financial Abuse, Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30) \n18  (On behalf of PLAINTIFFS and the \nFALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS CLASS) \n19   \n20  263.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the \n21  preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n22  264.  Plaintiffs and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members are \n23  and at all times were “elders” as defined under California Welfare & Institutions Code \n24  § 15610.27 or “dependent adults” as defined under California Welfare & Institutions Code \n25  § 15610.23. \n26  265.  BROOKDALE represented to the named Plaintiffs, and/or their responsible \n27  parties, and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members, and/or their \n28  responsible parties, in standard agreements, service updates, monthly invoices, \n  97  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 99 of 110\n \n1  standardized corporate letters to residents and/or their responsible parties, and/or annual \n2  notification of rate increases, that BROOKDALE would provide care and assistance with \n3  activities of daily living, including but not limited to staffing 24 hours a day, dining \n4  services, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, and other basic services in exchange for \n5  community fees and monthly payments that it received from the named Plaintiffs and the \n6  putative False or Misleading Statements Class members.  However, BROOKDALE did not \n7  and has no intention of providing sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained staff \n8  at its facilities to ensure that all residents receive these services.  As a result, residents do \n9  not consistently receive all of the basic services BROOKDALE has promised them and for \n10  which they are paying BROOKDALE. \n11  266.  BROOKDALE further represented through these same corporate materials \n12  that BROOKDALE would provide personal services, including but not limited to \n13  assistance with bathing, toileting, grooming, dressing, transferring, and mobility, for \n14  additional monthly fees.  BROOKDALE represented that it would perform an assessment \n15  of each resident to identify needed personal services and an individualized service plan to \n16  deliver those services.  Yet BROOKDALE did not intend to and does not provide adequate \n17  staffing for personal services at its facilities.  Rather, it has a policy and practice of \n18  providing pre-determined facility staffing that does not change with increases in residents’ \n19  personal service needs.  This policy and practice precludes BROOKDALE from providing \n20  facility residents with all of the personal services BROOKDALE has promised them and \n21  for which they are paying BROOKDALE. \n22  267.  BROOKDALE further represented through these same corporate materials \n23  that BROOKDALE would provide select and therapeutic services to residents, including \n24  but not limited to emergency call pendants and associated services.  However, \n25  BROOKDALE did not and has no intention of providing sufficient levels of qualified and \n26  adequately trained staff at its facilities to ensure that all residents receive these services.  \n27  As a result, facility residents do not consistently receive all of the select and therapeutic \n28  services BROOKDALE has promised them and for which they are paying BROOKDALE. \n  98  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 100 of 110\n \n1  268.  BROOKDALE knew or should have known that such conduct would likely \n2  be harmful to Plaintiffs and the putative False or Misleading Statements Class members. \n3  269.  BROOKDALE knew or should have known that Plaintiffs and the putative \n4  False or Misleading Statements Class members had a right to the funds used to pay new \n5  resident community fees and monthly fees to BROOKDALE. \n6  270.  As such, BROOKDALE took, secreted, appropriated, obtained and/or \n7  retained money belonging to Plaintiffs and putative class members for a wrongful use \n8  and/or with the intent to defraud. \n9  271.  BROOKDALE’s conduct was despicable, fraudulent, reckless, and carried \n10  out with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights and safety of Plaintiffs and the \n11  members of the putative False or Misleading Statements Class. \n12  272.  Plaintiffs and putative False or Misleading Statements Class members also \n13  seek compensatory damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses, punitive \n14  damages, treble damages pursuant to California Civil Code § 3345, and all other remedies \n15  permitted by law.  Plaintiffs do not seek certification of any claims for damages related to \n16  any personal injuries, emotional distress, or wrongful death suffered by any member of the \n17  class. \n18  273.  Plaintiffs’ claims under Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30 are limited to \n19  circumstances and facts occurring on or after May 16, 2015. \n20  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n21  declaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses \n22  incurred in bringing this action. \n23  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Unlawful, Unfair and Fraudulent Business Practices, \n24  Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq.) \n(On behalf of Plaintiffs and all Proposed Classes) \n25   \n26  274.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the \n27  preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n28  275.  BROOKDALE has engaged in unlawful business acts and practices.  Such \n  99  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 101 of 110\n \n1  acts and practices constitute unfair business practices in violation of California Business \n2  and Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq. \n3  276.  In particular, Defendants have engaged in unlawful business acts and \n4  practices by violating numerous laws, statutes and regulations including but not limited to: \n5  a.  Systematically and uniformly representing to the residents of its \n6  assisted living facilities in California, family members, and the public \n7  that Defendants will assess residents to determine their needs, and will \n8  provide residents specified basic services, personal services, and \n9  select and therapeutic services based on those needs, when in fact, \n10  Defendants use staffing policies and procedures that preclude them \n11  from providing their residents all of the care and services they have \n12  been promised and that place all residents in an inherent and \n13  substantial risk that they will not receive the care and services they \n14  have paid for on any given day, in violation of California Civil Code \n15  §§ 1750 et seq.;  \n16  b.  Failing to provide residents with disabilities full and equal enjoyment \n17  of BROOKDALE’s goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, \n18  and/or accommodations at its assisted living facilities in California; \n19  failing to remove architectural barriers in those facilities constructed \n20  prior to January 26, 1993 and not altered after that date where such \n21  removal is readily achievable; failing to design and construct facilities \n22  first occupied after January 26, 1993 such that they are readily \n23  accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities; and performing \n24  alterations after January 26, 1993 that affect the usability of its \n25  facilities or a part of its facilities, while failing to ensure that the \n26  altered portions and the path of travel to those altered portions are \n27  readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, all in \n28  violation of 42 U.S.C. § 12182 and Cal. Civ. Code § 51 et seq.; \n  100  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 102 of 110\n \n1  c.  Taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, and retaining the funds of \n2  elders and dependent adults for a wrongful use and/or with the intent \n3  to defraud in violation of California Welfare and Institutions Code \n4  § 15610.30; and \n5  d.  Willfully interfering with the maintenance and promotion of a resident \n6  council in violation of Cal. H&S Code § 1569.157. \n7  277.  By virtue of the conduct alleged herein, Defendants have also engaged in \n8  fraudulent business practices.  Members of the general public (including without limitation \n9  persons admitted to and/or residing in BROOKDALE’s California assisted living facilities \n10  during the CLASS PERIOD, and their family members and/or responsible parties) have \n11  been and are likely to be deceived by Defendants’ misrepresentations and failures to \n12  disclose as alleged herein. \n13  278.  The acts and practices of Defendants also constitute unfair business acts and \n14  practices within the meaning of California Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq., \n15  in that the conduct alleged herein is immoral, unscrupulous, and contrary to public policy, \n16  and the detriment and gravity of that conduct outweighs any benefits attributable to such \n17  conduct. \n18  279.  Defendants’ misrepresentations, misleading statements, acts, practices, and \n19  omissions were intended to induce and lure elderly and dependent adult residents and their \n20  family members into agreeing to be admitted to and remain at Defendants’ facilities and to \n21  pay a community fee and monthly rates to live in an assisted living facility that features \n22  sufficient levels of qualified and adequately trained staff to ensure that all residents receive \n23  the basic services, personal services, and select and therapeutic services for which they are \n24  paying. \n25  280.  Defendants made these misrepresentations and misleading statements \n26  through various uniform means of written corporate communications, including without \n27  limitation, the standardized Residency Agreement; subsequent agreements based on re-\n28  assessments of the resident; letters to residents regarding the merger between \n  101  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 103 of 110\n \n1  BROOKDALE and Emeritus, Defendants’ conversion to a new personal service system, \n2  and rate increases; invoices, marketing and promotional materials, Defendants’ corporate \n3  website and other materials disseminated to the public from its corporate headquarters in \n4  connection with Defendants’ services.  These representations were made directly to the \n5  named Plaintiffs, class members, and their family members and/or responsible parties by \n6  Defendants in the uniform means of communication listed above. \n7  281.  BROOKDALE concealed from Plaintiffs, the putative class members, and \n8  their family members that BROOKDALE’s staffing policies and procedures preclude it \n9  from providing its residents all of the care and services they have been promised and \n10  places all residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they will not receive the care and \n11  services they have paid for on any given day. \n12  282.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge of material facts not \n13  known to named Plaintiffs, putative class members or the general public at the time of the \n14  subject transactions and actively concealed these material facts. \n15  283.  BROOKDALE had exclusive and superior knowledge of its corporate policy \n16  and procedure.  Further, Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that Defendants’ \n17  officers, directors, and managers knew that Defendants’ failure to provide adequate \n18  staffing posed a substantial health and safety risk to the named Plaintiffs and class \n19  members.  BROOKDALE intentionally concealed, suppressed and/or failed to disclose the \n20  true facts with the intent to defraud the named Plaintiffs and putative class members.  The \n21  named Plaintiffs and the putative class members did not know these material undisclosed \n22  facts and could not reasonably have been expected to discover them. \n23  284.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiffs, the class \n24  members, and members of the general public (including without limitation persons \n25  admitted to and/or residing in the facilities, and their family members and/or responsible \n26  parties) have been harmed and continue to be harmed.  Among other things, they paid \n27  money to Defendants to enter the facilities and for services that were not provided or that \n28  were substandard to those promised by Defendants. \n  102  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 104 of 110\n \n1  285.  Plaintiffs seek an injunction that requires that Defendants immediately cease \n2  acts of unlawful, unfair and fraudulent business acts or practices as alleged herein, and to \n3  enjoin Defendants from continuing to engage in any such acts or practices in the future. \n4  286.  Plaintiffs’ claims under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 are limited to \n5  circumstances and facts occurring on or after May 16, 2015 to the extent they are based on \n6  Defendants’ failure to provide staff with adequate training and in sufficient numbers to \n7  provide their assisted living facility residents all of the care and services they have been \n8  promised. \n9  287.  WHEREFORE Plaintiffs pray for judgment as set forth below, including \n10  declaratory and injunctive relief as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses \n11  incurred in bringing this action. \n12  ALLEGATIONS SUPPORTING DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n13  288.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference as though fully set forth herein the \n14  preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n15  289.  Plaintiffs STACIA STINER, BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART, and \n16  JEANETTE ALGARME continue to live at a BROOKDALE assisted living facility.  \n17  Unless and until BROOKDALE brings its facilities into compliance with the requirements \n18  of the ADA and applicable federal disability access design standards, the above-named \n19  Plaintiffs will continue to be denied full and equal access to and enjoyment of \n20  BROOKDALE’s facilities as a result of physical access barriers in violation of the ADA.  \n21  Moreover, unless and until Defendant BROOKDALE makes the requested reasonable \n22  modification in policies, practices and procedures set forth above with respect to the \n23  staffing of its facilities, Plaintiffs will continue to be denied full and equal access to and \n24  enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations \n25  provided to its residents by BROOKDALE.  In this regard, unless and until Defendants \n26  provide a sufficient number of adequately trained staff at their facilities, residents with \n27  disabilities will continue to suffer the denial and deprivation of basic services that are \n28  necessary to daily living, including assistance with bathing, showering, toileting, taking \n  103  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 105 of 110\n \n1  medications, transferring, dressing, dining, cleaning and laundry services.  Further, \n2  residents with disabilities will continue to be denied full and equal access to on-site and \n3  off-site social and recreational activities, and will be segregated and isolated in violation of \n4  the ADA’s integration mandate. \n5  290.  In addition, unless and until Defendants comply with the ADA, Plaintiffs \n6  STACIA STINER, BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART, and JEANETTE ALGARME will \n7  continue to suffer falls, and to be at risk of falls and/or serious physical injuries, as a result \n8  of Defendants’ failure and refusal to provide full and equal access to its facilities and \n9  services.  In this regard, Defendants must be enjoined to provide facilities that comply with \n10  applicable federal disability access standards, a sufficient number of staff who are \n11  adequately trained to assist residents with disabilities to prevent falls and to assist them if a \n12  fall takes place, and a functioning and effective pendant system so that residents can obtain \n13  prompt and effective assistance when they have fallen and/or are at risk of other physical \n14  injuries.  Further, unless and until Defendants provide adequate emergency planning and \n15  evacuation procedures for residents with disabilities, Defendants will continue to place \n16  them at significant risk of serious injury and death. \n17  291.  Further, unless and until Defendants provide residents with disabilities with \n18  full and equal access to enjoyment of its transportation services, residents with disabilities \n19  will continue to be excluded from and denied access to off-site appointments and activities \n20  in violation of the ADA. \n21  292.  Additionally, unless and until BROOKDALE ceases its false and/or \n22  misleading statements regarding its services and discloses that its corporate staffing \n23  policies and practices preclude it from providing its residents the care and services they \n24  have been promised and places all residents at an inherent and substantial risk that they \n25  will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day, residents, their \n26  family members, their responsible parties and the general public will continue to be misled \n27  and will continue to expend very substantial sums of money for services, goods and \n28  facilities that are not as represented, and Defendants will continue to receive the benefits of \n  104  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 106 of 110\n \n1  their ill-gotten gains. \n2  293.  Finally, unless and until BROOKDALE is ordered to refrain from interfering \n3  with the maintenance and promotion of resident and family councils at its facilities, \n4  Plaintiffs will continue to suffer from retaliation against resident and family councils and \n5  their members and be subjected to BROOKDALE’s obstruction of the promotion and \n6  operation of said councils at its facilities. \n7  294.  A present and actual controversy exists regarding the respective rights and \n8  obligations of Plaintiffs and Defendants.  Plaintiffs desire a judicial determination of their \n9  rights and Defendants’ obligations in a declaration as to whether, and to what extent, the \n10  Defendants’ conduct violates applicable law. \n11  295.  Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that \n12  Plaintiffs may ascertain their rights.  Such a declaration is also necessary and appropriate \n13  to prevent further harm or infringement of Plaintiffs’ rights. \n14  296.  Plaintiffs STACIA STINER, BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART, and \n15  JEANETTE ALGARME have no adequate remedy at law for the harm to them arising \n16  from the conduct alleged herein.  Unless and until Defendants are preliminarily and \n17  permanently enjoined from engaging in such conduct, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer \n18  irreparable harm as a result of Defendants’ violations of the ADA, the Unruh Act, the \n19  CLRA, the UCL, Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30, and Cal. H&S Code §§ 1569.157 \n20  and 1569.158 as alleged herein. \n21  297.  Plaintiffs STACIA STINER, BERNIE JESTRABEK-HART, and \n22  JEANETTE ALGARME are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to each \n23  of the laws under which this action is brought. \n24  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n25  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court: \n26  1.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ failure to provide full and \n27  equal access to and enjoyment of Defendants’ goods, services, facilities, benefits, \n28  advantages and accommodations with nondisabled persons violates Plaintiffs’ rights the \n  105  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 107 of 110\n \n1  ADA, § 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and also \n2  violates their civil rights under California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq.; \n3  2.

Issue preliminary and permanent injunctions requiring that Defendants \n14  immediately cease acts that constitute false advertising and violations of the Consumer \n15  Legal Remedies Act and the Elder Financial Abuse statute as alleged herein with respect to \n16  Defendants’ misrepresentations, misleading statements, and material omissions, and to \n17  enjoin Defendants from continuing to engage in any such acts or practices in the future; \n18  5.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctions requiring that BROOKDALE \n19  disclose to Plaintiffs, the putative class members and the consuming public that its \n20  corporate staffing policies and procedures preclude it from providing its residents the care \n21  and services they have been promised and places all residents at an inherent and substantial \n22  risk that they will not receive the care and services they have paid for on any given day, \n23  and prohibiting BROOKDALE from charging fees based on the residents’ Personal \n24  Service Plans when BROOKDALE does not, in fact, provide adequate staffing levels to \n25  perform the personal services identified in those plans; \n26  6.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctions ordering BROOKDALE to \n27  refrain from interference with the formation, maintenance and promotion of family or \n28  resident councils at its facilities. \n  106  Case No. 4:17-cv-03962-HSG \n \n  \n[3351751.3] THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n  \n\nCase 4:17-cv-03962-HSG   Document 90   Filed 02/15/19   Page 108 of 110\n \n1  7.

(collectively,  Brookdale)  appeal  the  district  court’s  denial  of  Brookdale’s \nmotion to compel Helen Carlson and Lawrence Quinlan to arbitrate.  We have \n \n    *    This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent \nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. \n  \n    **    The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision \nwithout oral argument.  See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2). \n        \n\nCCaassee :4 1:197-1-c5v3-3043,9 0642/-2H4S/2G0 2  0D, oIDcu: m11e6n7t 0168555  ,  FDilketdE n0t4ry/2: 44/22-01 ,   PPaaggee  22  ooff  66\njurisdiction under 9 U.S.C. § 16.  Reviewing de novo, Murphy v. DirecTV, Inc., \n724 F.3d 1218, 1224 (9th Cir. 2013), we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \n  Carlson and Quinlan were residents at Brookdale.  They, among others, sued \nBrookdale as part of a putative class action, alleging claims under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Unruh Act), the \nConsumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), section 17200, et seq., of the California \nBusiness and Professions Code (UCL), and section 15610.30 of the California \nWelfare and Institutions Code.  Brookdale moved to compel Carlson and Quinlan to \narbitrate based on their residency agreements.   \n  The district court denied the motion to compel arbitration as to Carlson \nbecause Carlson’s earlier agreement to arbitrate was superseded by her most recent \nagreement’s opt-out.  We agree and affirm as to Carlson.   \nIn 2017, Carlson’s legal representative and power of attorney signed her most \nrecent agreement, which “constitute[d] the entire agreement between the parties and \nsupersede[d]  all  prior  and  contemporaneous  discussions,  representations, \ncorrespondence,  and  agreements  whether  oral  or  written.”    In  that  agreement, \nCarlson opted out of arbitration.  According to the terms of the agreement, it applied \nto “[a]ny and all claims or controversies arising out of, or in any way relating to, this \nAgreement or [Carlson’s] stay at [Brookdale] . . . whether existing or arising in the \nfuture.”     \n2 \n      \n\nCCaassee :4 1:197-1-c5v3-3043,9 0642/-2H4S/2G0 2  0D, oIDcu: m11e6n7t 0168555  ,  FDilketdE n0t4ry/2: 44/22-01 ,   PPaaggee  33  ooff  66\nIn California, a court’s interpretation of a contract begins and ends with the \nlanguage if the language is “clear and explicit.”  Cal. Civ. Code § 1638; see also \nBank of the W. v. Superior Court, 833 P.2d 545, 552 (Cal. 1992).  Here, Carlson’s \n2017 residency agreement clearly covered any claims she may have had against \nBrookdale, including those existing at the time Carlson’s representative signed the \nagreement.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s denial of Brookdale’s motion \nto compel arbitration as to Carlson.  \nWe next consider Brookdale’s appeal as to Quinlan.  The district court denied \nBrookdale’s motion to compel Quinlan to arbitrate for two reasons: 1) because \nQuinlan’s son, who signed Quinlan’s residency agreement, did not have apparent \nauthority to bind Quinlan; and 2) because Quinlan’s claims were extricable from the \nresidency agreement, so equitable estoppel did not apply.   \nWe agree on the first point but disagree on the second.  Quinlan’s claims under \nthe CLRA, the UCL, and section 15610.30 of the California Welfare and Institutions \nCode are founded on the residency agreement, but his claims under the ADA and \nthe Unruh Act are not.  Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part as to \nQuinlan.  \nWe hold that Quinlan’s son did not have apparent authority to bind Quinlan \nto the residency agreement.  Apparent authority arises when a principal’s actions \nwould cause a reasonable person to believe that an agent had the authority to act for \n3 \n      \n\nCCaassee :4 1:197-1-c5v3-3043,9 0642/-2H4S/2G0 2  0D, oIDcu: m11e6n7t 0168555  ,  FDilketdE n0t4ry/2: 44/22-01 ,   PPaaggee  44  ooff  66\nthe principal.  Cal. Civ. Code § 2300; Mavrix Photographs, LLC v. LiveJournal, Inc., \n873  F.3d  1045,  1055  (9th  Cir.  2017).    Here,  Quinlan’s  son  signed  Quinlan’s \nresidency  agreement,  including  on  lines  marked  “Legal  Representative,”  and \nQuinlan took no action to disclaim his son’s agency.  Quinlan’s silence, however, \n“communicated nothing” because there was no “historical relationship or course of \nconduct” that would allow Brookdale to infer such silence established apparent \nagency.  Valentine v. Plum Healthcare Grp., LLC, 249 Cal. Rptr. 3d 905, 914–15 \n(Cal. Ct. App. 2019). \nWe next hold that Quinlan is estopped from disclaiming the arbitration clause \nfor his claims under the CLRA, UCL, and section 15610.30 of the California Welfare \nand Institutions Code (elder financial abuse).  Under California law, a litigant may \nnot assert claims based on a contract while simultaneously arguing that an arbitration \nclause in that contract is ineffective.  See Kramer v. Toyota Motor Corp., 705 F.3d \n1122, 1128 (9th Cir. 2013).  The question is whether “the claims are ‘intimately \nfounded in and intertwined with’ the underlying contract.”  Id. (quoting Goldman v. \nKPMG LLP, 92 Cal. Rptr. 3d 534, 543 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009)); see also Boucher v. \nAll. Title Co., 25 Cal. Rptr. 3d 440, 447 (Cal. Ct. App. 2005) (applying equitable \nestoppel to a claim under the UCL). \nHere, Quinlan’s CLRA, UCL, and elder financial abuse claims are predicated \non  the  allegation  that  Brookdale  did  not  perform  as  the  residency  agreement \n4 \n      \n\nCCaassee :4 1:197-1-c5v3-3043,9 0642/-2H4S/2G0 2  0D, oIDcu: m11e6n7t 0168555  ,  FDilketdE n0t4ry/2: 44/22-01 ,   PPaaggee  55  ooff  66\nrequired.  Quinlan alleges that his son and granddaughter “read the agreement . . . \nand reasonably understood . . . that BROOKDALE would . . . provide the services \nthat BROOKDALE promised and for which Mr. QUINLAN was paying.”  Quinlan \nthen  pleads  these  claims  on  the  ground  that  the  agreement,  and  other \ncommunications  predominantly  derivative  of  the  transaction  such  as  resident \nevaluations and invoices, were “false and misleading.”  But the communications’ \nfalsity is dependent on the allegation, reasserted in each of the three claims, that \nBrookdale’s policies failed “to ensure that all residents receive the services they have \nbeen promised and for which they are paying.”  We hold that Quinlan is estopped \nfrom disclaiming the arbitration clause in asserting his UCL, CLRA, and elder \nfinancial abuse claims because those claims are founded on the residency agreement. \nQuinlan’s claims under the ADA and the Unruh Act are different.  These \nclaims as pleaded do not rest upon the residency agreement.  For example, the claim \nthat Brookdale’s facilities must meet the access requirements under Title III of the \nADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12183(a)(1), is not “intertwined with” the agreement and thus \nQuinlan is not required to arbitrate this claim under principles of equitable estoppel.  \nSee Goldman, 92 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 543.  We therefore hold that Quinlan is not bound \nto arbitrate his ADA and Unruh Act claims. \nWe  affirm  the  district  court’s  denial  of  Brookdale’s  motion  to  compel \narbitration as to Helen Carlson’s claims and to Lawrence Quinlan’s ADA and Unruh \n5 \n      \n\nCCaassee :4 1:197-1-c5v3-3043,9 0642/-2H4S/2G0 2  0D, oIDcu: m11e6n7t 0168555  ,  FDilketdE n0t4ry/2: 44/22-01 ,   PPaaggee  66  ooff  66\nAct claims.  We reverse the district court’s denial of Brookdale’s motion to compel \narbitration as to Quinlan’s CLRA, UCL, and elder financial abuse claims. \nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.1   \n \n \n \n \n1 Each party shall bear its own costs. \n6 \n      ",
