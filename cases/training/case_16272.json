The plaintiffs sued Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA) and Oklahoma State Department of Human Services (DHS) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and  the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Oklahoma Disability Law Center, sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming violations of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs alleged that OHCA and DHS were planning to cut funding to the waivers that the plaintiffs depended on for home based health care services and put them in danger of forced institutionalization in a nursing home. More specifically, in October 2017, the plaintiffs received notices that their Medicaid ADvantage and In-Home Supports waivers would not be funded after December 1, 2017. This case was assigned to Judge Joe Heaton. On December 6, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. </p><p>On February 12, 2018, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ amended complaint. They alleged that the plaintiffs’ claims had become moot because DHS found a way to fully fund the waiver programs. Further, the defendants argued that, because there were no longer any violation of federal law, the plaintiffs were not entitled to injunctive or declaratory relief. Therefore, the amended complaint should be dismissed. </p><p>The court agreed and dismissed the plaintiffs’ amended complaint for mootness on March 26, 2018. This case is now closed.</p><p></p>",

This is an action brought by seniors and adults with disabilities, all residents of the \nState of Oklahoma, who are current recipients of the Medicaid ADvantage Waiver \nor the Medicaid In-Home Supports Waiver for Adults, who have received notice \nfrom Defendant Lake’s agency, the Department of Human Services (DHS), that \ntheir waiver services would be terminated effective December 1, 2017, and who \nare at serious risk of institutionalization as a result of the arbitrary decision to \nterminate waiver services solely for economic reasons.1  \n2. Subsequently, Governor Fallin signed a stopgap budget measure (HB 1019X) to \nfund critical DHS services, including waiver services, through February 2018.  \n3. As a result of the stopgap budget measure, Defendant Lake’s agency, DHS, sent \nletters to recipients of the Medicaid ADvantage Waiver and the Medicaid In-Home \n1 Letter from Karen Poteet, Interim Director, Aging Services, Oklahoma Department of \n​\nHuman Services, to ADvantage Member, (Oct. 31, 2017) (attached as Exhibit 1) and \nLetter  from  Marie  Moore,  Interim  Director,  Developmental  Disabilities  Services, \nOklahoma  Department  of  Human  Services, to  In-Home  Supports  Waiver  for  Adults \nRecipients, (Oct. 31, 2017) (attached as Exhibit 2).  \n2 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 3 of 37\nSupports for Adults Waiver indicating their waiver services would continue to be \nfunded beyond December 1, 2017.2  \n4. Defendant Lake’s agency, however, has indicated its current budget only funds \nservices  through  February 2018, and  DHS will again send 30-day termination \nnotices to waiver recipients on February 2018, effective March 1, 2018.3 \n5. ADvantage and In-Home Supports for Adults Waiver recipients remain at risk of \ntermination  of their waiver services effective March 1, 2018, and a significant \nnumber of waiver recipients remain at risk of institutionalization as a result of \nDefendant DHS’s actions.  \n6. Defendant Lake’s arbitrary termination of waiver services without assessing for \nand  providing  alternative  services  places  Plaintiffs  at  serious  risk  of \ninstitutionalization.  \n7. Plaintiffs who receive the ADvantage waiver are either “frail elderly persons” or \nare adults over the age of 21 who have a physical disability. Plaintiffs receiving \nthe ADvantage waiver are individuals requiring a nursing home level of care, as \ndetermined by nursing staff of the aging services division of DHS4, who receive \n2   Letter from Karen Poteet, Interim Director, Aging Services, Oklahoma Department of \n​ ​\nHuman Services, to ADvantage Member, (Nov. 21, 2017) (attached as Exhibit 3) and \nLetter from Marie Moore, Interim Director, Developmental Disabilities Services, \nOklahoma Department of Human Services, to In-Home Supports Waiver for Adults \nRecipients, (Nov. 22, 2017) (attached as Exhibit 4).  \n3http://www.tahlequahdailypress.com/news/dhs-programs-now-funded-for-about-months/\narticle_82b63889-1575-5aaf-a6f5-4ed433c0fb41.html \n4 http://www.okhca.org/individuals.aspx?id=8143 \n​\n3 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 4 of 37\nservices,  such  as  skilled  nursing,  personal  care,  home-delivered  meals,  and \ntherapeutic  services,  through  the  ADvantage  waiver  to  remain  in  a \ncommunity-based living setting, either in their own home, or in the home of a \nfamily member, instead of in an institution such as a nursing home.5  \n8. Plaintiffs who receive the In-Home Supports waiver for adults are individuals over \nage 18 who have developmental disabilities and receive waiver services, such as \nnutrition  services,  nursing  care,  therapeutic  services,  and  physical  home \nmodifications  (such  as  a  ramp  or  roll-in  shower)  in  order  to  remain  in  a \ncommunity-based living setting, either in their own home, or the home of a family \nmember, instead of in an institution.6 \n9. As a result of Defendant Lake’s actions, Plaintiffs and thousands of putative class \nmembers are at serious risk for institutionalization.7 DHS itself has estimated that \nat least 10,000 individuals who will lose waiver services could be forced to live in \ninstitutions, including nursing homes.8 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief for violation of Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and Section \n5 http://www.okhca.org/individuals.aspx?id=8143 \n6 http://www.okhca.org/individuals.aspx?id=8149 \n7http://newsok.com/without-a-deal-10000-people-could-be-forced-into-nursing-homes/art\nicle/5569386 \n8http://www.okdhs.org/OKDHS%20PDF%20Library/Office%20of%20Communications/\nDHSBudgetWorkProgramfor$69MLossofFunding_ocom_10252017.pdf \n4 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 5 of 37\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), (29 U.S.C. § 794).  \n11.Jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1342 for a violation of Title II of \nthe ADA, and Section 504.

He wants \nto remain living at his home where he can maintain an active community life.  \nPlaintiff Trevor Hay (through his Legal Guardian Lonnette Hay) \n26.Plaintiff  Trevor  Hay  is  a  21  year  old  person  with  developmental  disabilities, \nincluding autism,  attention  deficit  hyperactivity disorder, and connective tissue \nsyndrome.

Plaintiff Davis lives with his parents, Lance and \nSherry Davis, who are his legal guardians.  \n53.Plaintiff Davis has diagnoses of Cerebral Palsy, Intellectual Disability, Epilepsy \nwith Grand Mal seizures, Schizophrenia, and Acute Asthma. He functions at about \nthe  level of  a 7-year-old,  according  to  testing.  His  disabilities  require that he \nreceive total care. He cannot walk, stand, or sit unassisted. He uses an electric \nwheelchair; however, Tomas can only operate his wheelchair unassisted for very \nshort distances.  \n54.Plaintiff Davis is unable to bathe or dress himself. Tomas requires assistance for \nall transfers to and from his wheelchair, including in and out of bed. Precautions \nsuch as frequent repositioning must be taken to avoid pressure sores. His food \nmust be cooked for him, cut into small pieces, and his eating monitored as he \nchokes easily. \n11 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 12 of 37\n55.Plaintiff  Davis  is  unable to administer his own medications or take himself to \ndoctor appointments. He requires assistance for all aspects of toileting.  \n56.Tomas has issues with memory recall and has difficulty retaining information; he \noften cannot remember people that he doesn’t see on a daily basis even though he \nhas known the person for years.  \n57.Tomas  currently takes  nine different prescription medications daily along with \nseveral over-the-counter  medications also recommended by his doctor, such as \nstool softeners and allergy medications. \n58.DHS administers the Oklahoma In Home Supports Waiver (IHS Waiver). To be \neligible for IHS Waiver, DHS determined that Tomas requires the level of care \nthat is provided in an Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual \nDisabilities (ICF/IID). Instead of going to an ICF, he lives at home and receives 16 \nhours per week of Habilitation Training Specialist Services (HTS) and 40 hours \nper week of Vocational Services through Oklahoma’s IHS Waiver program. In \naddition, Tomas receives 29 hours per week of personal care assistance and one \nadditional hour of personal care each weekend for laundry.  \n59.The IHS Waiver also allows Tomas’ nine prescription medications to be paid for \nby Medicaid. Without  the  IHS  waiver, Oklahoma Medicaid limits prescription \ncoverage  for  adults  to  six  prescriptions  per  month.  Without  the  additional \ncoverage, Plaintiff’s parents cannot afford Tomas’s nine medications. \n12 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 13 of 37\n60.Plaintiff  Davis’s  parents  were  notified  by  DHS  that  Tomas’s  IHS  Waiver \nVocational Services will be terminated on December 1, 2017. In addition, Plaintiff \nDavis’s  parents  were  notified  that  Tomas’s  Personal  Care  Services  will  be \nterminated. This means that all Tomas’s DHS services will be terminated. \n61.Plaintiff Davis’s parents were informed of the elimination of the IHS Waiver in \nNovember  2017, when they received a letter from OKDHS. The letter did not \nprovide alternative sources of care for Tomas. He was not offered the Community \nWaiver as potential alternative care.  \n62.Without  the  IHS  Waiver  for  Tomas, Tomas’s  parents  will be  forced  to  place \nTomas in an ICF. \n63.When assessed for the IHS Waiver, OKDHS determined the 16 hours a week of \nHTS services, 29 hours  per week of personal care services and 40 Vocational \nEmployment hours  are the services Tomas needs in order to have his medical \nneeds met at home, rather than in an institution. \n64.Tomas’s HTS works two hours each morning, seven days per week getting Tomas \nout of bed, assisting him with toileting, personal hygiene, meal preparation and \nbreakfast, dressing and getting ready for his vocational center. His HTS also works \ntwo  hours  each  evening,  seven  days  per  week  assisting  him with  meal  time, \npersonal hygiene, bathing, and getting Tomas ready for and into bed. The IHS \nWaiver also provides Tomas 40 hours per week vocational employment services \n13 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 14 of 37\nthrough Oklahoma’s IHS Waiver. These are small group vocational services where \nhe receives a high level of support with a 1 to 5 staff ratio. \n65.Plaintiff  Davis’s parents both work full-time jobs outside of the home and are \nunable to provide Tomas the care he requires due to their work demands. Plaintiff \nDavis’s parents must continue working as without both their incomes they would \nno longer be able to afford their house payment and they would lose their home, \nwhich means Tomas losing his home as well. \n66.Plaintiff Davis’s parents have both sustained physical injury from years of lifting \nTomas and can no longer provide the level of care he needs without the assistance \nof paid staff, an expense they cannot afford to pay themselves. \n67.Notice of the termination of the IHS has interfered already with Plaintiff Davis’s \ncare. It has led to several of Tomas’s personal care staff quitting in anticipation of \nneeding to find other employment.  \n68.Plaintiff’s parents believe this change in routine and uncertainty has contributed \nto, if not caused, an increase in Tomas’ seizures, including a Grand Mal seizure on \nNovember 14, 2017. \n69.Plaintiff’s parents subsequently learned his IHS waiver services would continue \nbeyond December 1, 2017.  \n14 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 15 of 37\n70.Plaintiff’s parents, however, are aware that Defendant DHS has stated it will begin \nsending  30-day  termination  notices to  waiver  recipients  on  February 1,  2018, \neffective March 1, 2018.   \n71.Without the 85 hours of care per week, Plaintiff Davis’s parents will be forced to \nbe place Tomas in a nursing home or other institution. Plaintiff Davis’s parents \nwant him to remain in their home and receive services there. Tomas also wishes to \nremain in his home, with his family and people who are familiar to him. \nPlaintiff Rhonda Cassell (through Legal Guardian Janis Harris) \n72.Plaintiff Rhonda Cassell is a 43 year old individual who lives with her mother and \nlegal guardian, Janis Harris, in Durant, Oklahoma.  \n73.Plaintiff Cassell has been diagnosed with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Seizure \nDisorder and double vision.   \n74.Plaintiff  Cassell’s TBI  occurred at  age  7 when she was hit by a car and was \ncomatose for three months and was not expected to survive. She is paralyzed on \nthe left side. Rhonda is highly susceptible to falls due to her paralysis and double \nvision. She uses a wheelchair most of the time as she can only walk very short \ndistances with assistance. If there is no handrail, she requires physical support with \nwalking. She requires assistance getting in and out of vehicles. \n75.Plaintiff Cassell requires assistance and supervision anytime she goes out in the \ncommunity.  She  cannot  be  by  herself  as  she  is  susceptible  to  being  taken \n15 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 16 of 37\nadvantage of by others, is impulsive, frequently falls, and is unaware of danger. \nShe will give her money away to family members.  \n76.Plaintiff Cassell requires assistance with bathing and dressing. She is incontinent \nand wears briefs. She has frequent “accidents” and soils her clothes. When she has \naccidents, her caregivers must change and wash her clothing and clean her body. \nShe cannot cook and her food must be cut up to prevent choking.   \n77.Plaintiff  Cassell receives medical care through Oklahoma’s Medicaid In Home \nSupports Waiver.  Her In Home Supports Waiver will end December 1, 2017. \n78.DHS administers the Oklahoma In Home Supports Waiver (IHS Waiver). To be \neligible for the IHS Waiver, DHS determined that Rhonda requires the level of \ncare  that  is  provided  in  an  Intermediate  Care  Facility  for  Individuals  with \nIntellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID).   \n79.Instead of going to an ICF, Cassell lives at home and receives 28 hours per week \nof  Habilitation  Training  Specialist  Services  (HTS)  through  Oklahoma’s  IHS \nWaiver program. She has been authorized to receive this amount of services for \nthe past 20 years. Without these hours of care, she will be forced to be placed in a \nnursing home or other institution.   \n80.Plaintiff Cassell has an HTS who works 28 hours per week and takes care of all \nher needs. This HTS provides all of Rhonda’s care during the 28 hours she works. \nThe HTS bathes Rhonda, dresses her, and feeds her. The HTS also toilets and \n16 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 17 of 37\nchanges Rhonda’s briefs throughout the day. The HTS assists her when she has \ntoileting “accidents” by changing and washing her clothing and cleaning her body. \nThe HTS monitors  Rhonda  to prevent and limit her frequent falls. She assists \nRhonda anytime she goes into the community. \n81.Plaintiff Cassell’s mother provides care for Rhonda beyond the 28 hours her HTS \nprovides. Because Rhonda requires 24-hour care, Cassell’s mother must meet all \nof her needs beyond those of her HTS. The HTS services allows her mother to \nmeet these additional care needs. \n82.Cassell’s mother has been diagnosed with Lupus, Osteoarthritis, and Congestive \nHeart Failure. Her health conditions makes it impossible to provide the additional \ncare Rhonda needs on a daily basis if she loses her IHS Waiver services. Plaintiff’s \nmother is unable to provide 24-hour care she requires and will place her in an \ninstitution if her IHS Waiver is eliminated.   \n83.Plaintiff’s mother learned of the elimination of the IHS Waiver in November 2017 \nwhen she received a letter from OKDHS. The letter did not provide alternative \nsources of care for Rhonda. She was not offered Medicaid Home Health Care, or \nthe Community Waiver as potential alternative care. Due to her high level of need, \nRhonda will be forced to be institutionalized in an ICF, nursing home or other \nfacility.   \n17 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 18 of 37\n84.Plaintiff’s mother subsequently learned her IHS waiver services would continue \nbeyond December 1, 2017.  \n85.Plaintiff’s mother, however, is aware that Defendant DHS has stated it will begin \nsending  30-day  termination  notices to  waiver  recipients  on  February 1,  2018, \neffective March 1, 2018.   \n86.Rhonda does not want to be forced to move to an institution. She has her own \nbedroom that she decorated. She enjoys living with her mother, visiting friends, \nand shopping. Plaintiff Cassell wants to stay in her home that she has lived in for \nmany years. \nPlaintiff Lori Taylor \n87.Plaintiff Lori Taylor is a 52 year old person with physical disabilities residing in \nNorman,  Oklahoma.  Plaintiff  Taylor  enjoys  creative  projects,  including \nphotography, and has won photography competitions.  \n88.Plaintiff Taylor is an active community member, donating her time to serve on the \nSteering Committee for the City of Norman’s ADA Transition Plan. She is also \none of the founding members of Oklahoma ADAPT.  \n89.Plaintiff  Taylor  has  cerebral  palsy,  and  is  unable  to  walk.  Plaintiff  uses  the \nassistance of a wheelchair. \n18 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 19 of 37\n90.Plaintiff  Taylor  is  able  to  brush  her  teeth,  bathe,  and  use  the  restroom \nindependently, but she is unable to groom herself or transport herself from her bed \nwithout    assistance. \n91.Plaintiff  Taylor  receives  services  through  the  Medicaid  ADvantage  Waiver \nprogram. Such services include the assistance of a hospital bed, home health aide, \nspecialized adaptive equipment, and a Life Alert. \n92.Plaintiff  Taylor  has  lived  independently  since  she  was  17  years  old.  Prior  to \nreceiving the ADvantage waiver services, Taylor’s ex-husband was her caretaker.  \n93.Plaintiff Taylor now lives alone and does not have a caretaker. Plaintiff’s closest \nfamily member, her mother, lives two hours away and does not have the physical \nability to assist Plaintiff Taylor with her essential daily needs.  \n94.Plaintiff  Taylor  receives  17.75  hours  of  services  from  a  home  health  aide, \nprovided by the ADvantage program. The home health aide comes to Taylor’s \nhome daily to assist with her personal needs, such as bathing, physically getting \nout of bed, housework and cooking.  \n95.Without the help of the home health aide provided by the program, Taylor would \nnot be able to physically get into or out of her bed. If Plaintiff is not in bed, and \nher aide does not come to assist her, she will be forced to sleep in her motorized \nwheelchair. Plaintiff then would be susceptible to infection in the form of swollen \nlimbs and pressure sores.  \n19 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 20 of 37\n96.Without  her  home  health aide, Plaintiff Taylor also will not be able to groom \nherself or  perform daily self-care activities. \n97.Plaintiff Taylor learned of the elimination of her ADvantage Waiver in November \n2017 when she received a letter from DHS which provided no alternative sources \nof care.  \n98.Plaintiff  Taylor  subsequently  learned  her  ADvantage  Waiver  services  would \ncontinue beyond December 1, 2017.  \n99.Plaintiff Taylor, however, is aware that Defendant DHS has stated it will begin \nsending  30-day  termination  notices to  waiver  recipients  on  February 1,  2018, \neffective March 1, 2018.   \n100. Because the services provided through the ADvantage Waiver are essential to \nher care, Plaintiff Taylor will be forced into a nursing home or other institutional \nfacility if her services are terminated.  \n101. Plaintiff Taylor does not want to live in a nursing home. Plaintiff Taylor wants \nto  continue  living in  and  serving  her  community through art and activism for \npeople with disabilities.  \nDefendants \n \n102. Defendant Becky Pasternik-Ikard is the Chief Executive Officer of Oklahoma \nHealth  Care  Authority  (OHCA).  The  OHCA  is  the  single  state  agency  for \nMedicaid administration. See 63 O.S. §§5000.24-5029.  \n​ ​\n20 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 21 of 37\n103. Defendant  Ed  Lake  is  the  Director of  the  Oklahoma State  Department  of \nHuman Services (DHS). Acting under color of state law, Defendant Lake holds \nexecutive  authority  over  the  administration  of  the  ADvantage  Waiver  and \nIn-Home  Supports  Waiver  programs  since  DHS  is  the  entity  responsible  for \nadministering the waiver programs once established by OHCA.  See 56 O.S. § \n​ ​\n1017.4.   \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n104. Title  XIX of  the  Social  Security  Act establishes the federal-state Medicaid \nprogram. See 42 U.S.C. §§1396–1396w-5. The purpose of Medicaid is to furnish, \nas far as practicable, “medical assistance on behalf of . . . aged, blind or disabled \nindividuals, whose  income  and resources  are  insufficient  to  meet  the  costs of \nnecessary medical services” and “to help such families and individuals to attain or \nretain capability for independence or self-care.” 42 U.S.C. §1396-1.  \n105. Participation in the Medicaid program by states is voluntary. If a state elects to \nparticipate  in  the  Medicaid  program,  it  must  “comply with  detailed  federally \nmandated standards.” Antrican v. Odom, 290 F.3d 178, 183 n.2 (4th Cir. 2002). \n​ ​\nParticipating states are reimbursed by the federal government for a majority of the \ncosts of Medicaid benefits. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396b.  \n​ ​\n106. Participating states must designate a “single state agency” to administer the \nMedicaid program. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5). Oklahoma has elected to participate \n21 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 22 of 37\nin Medicaid, and the state has designated the Oklahoma Health Care Authority \n(OHCA)  as  its  single  state  agency  for  administration.  See  63  O.S. \n​ ​\n§§5000.24-5029. \n107. While  OHCA  is  the  single  state  agency  for  administration  of  the  State \nMedicaid  program, DHS  is  the entity responsible for administering the waiver \nprograms, including the ADvantage Waiver and the In-Home Supports Waiver for \nAdults once established by OHCA.  See 56 O.S. § 1017.4.   \n​ ​\n108. Participation in Medicaid requires Oklahoma, and other participating states, to \ncover  certain  mandatory  services.  42  U.S.C.  §§  1396a(a)(10),  1396d(a).  In \naddition,  a state  may choose to provide certain optional services. Once a state \nchooses to  provide  an optional  service, it  must fully  adhere  to  the applicable \nrequirements of federal law and regulations. See Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d \n​ ​\n496, 504 (8th Cir. 2006).  \n109. Oklahoma has chosen to provide ADvantage Waiver and In-Home Supports \nWaivers  for  Adults  programs  for  vulnerable  Oklahomans.  More  than  20,000 \nindividuals  are  served  by  these  waivers  and  are  now  at  serious  risk  of \ninstitutionalization  as a  result of Defendant Lake’s arbitrary termination of the \nwaivers.9 \n9http://www.okdhs.org/OKDHS%20PDF%20Library/Office%20of%20Communications/\nDHSBudgetWorkProgramfor$69MLossofFunding_ocom_10252017.pdf \n22 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 23 of 37\n110. The ADvantage Waiver is a program for “frail elderly” persons and adults over \nthe  age  of  21  who  have  a  physical  disability. Individuals are  required  to be \nevaluated  and  determined  “nursing-home  eligible”  by  nursing  staff of DHS’s \nAging Services Division in order to participate in the program. Instead of living in \na nursing home, however, recipients of the ADvantage waiver are able to live in \ntheir own home or the home of a family member. The benefits of this program are \nmanifold and include fiscal benefits to the state and quality of life benefits to the \nindividual.  \n111. The In-Home  Supports Waiver for Adults is a Medicaid program, operated \nwithin  the  larger  “Home  and  Community  Based  Services  Waivers”  program \noffered  by  the State  of  Oklahoma for individuals  over  the  age of 18 with an \nintellectual disability. See OAC 317:40-1-1. Recipients must meet the Institutional \n​ ​ ​ ​\nCare Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID) Level of Care \nrequirements per OAC 317:30-5-122.  \n​\n112. Without  the  In-Home Supports Waiver for Adults, recipients would require \nplacement  in  an  institutional  setting.10  Instead  of  being  forced  to  live  in  an \ninstitution,  however,  individual recipients of the In-Home Supports Waiver for \nAdults live in their own home, foster home, group home, or the home of a family \nmember.  The  waiver provides  necessary  services, such as adaptive equipment, \n10 http://www.okhca.org/individuals.aspx?id=8149 \n23 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 24 of 37\nspeech,  physical,  and  occupational therapies, medical supplies, family training, \nand nursing services.   \n113. Defendant Lake’s agency, DHS, indicated its intent, through written notice to \nparticipants and providers, to arbitrarily terminate both the ADvantage Waiver and \nIn-Home Supports Waiver for Adults programs effective December 1, 2017. \n114. DHS’s written 30-day notices of arbitrary termination provided no opportunity \nfor participants to have a hearing or to appeal Defendant Lake’s summary decision \nto terminate the programs in their entirety. \n115. Subsequently, DHS sent notices to waiver recipients indicating their waiver \nservices would continue beyond December 1, 2017.  \n116. Defendant  DHS,  however,  has  indicated  it  will  again  send  30-day  waiver \ntermination notices on February 1, 2018, effective March 1, 2018.  \n117. Because  DHS still intends  to  terminate  waiver services  effective March 1, \n2018, the threat of arbitrary institutionalization continues for a significant number \nof waiver recipients. \n118. Defendant Pasternik-Ikard’s agency, OHCA, is required to provide institutional \ncare  for  Medicaid  recipients,  including  all  waiver  recipients  at  risk  of \ninstitutionalization  resulting  from  DHS’s  arbitrary  termination  of  the  waiver \nprograms. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS  \n24 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 25 of 37\n119. This complaint is brought as a statewide class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a)  and (b)(2) on behalf of all current Oklahoma ADvantage Waiver and \nIn-Home Supports Waiver recipients whose services are set to be eliminated by \nDefendants,  effective  March  1,  2017,  and  who  are  at  significant  risk  of \ninstitutionalization as a result of Defendants’ actions.  \n120. The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. DHS \nrecently reported that 21,147 individuals are served by ADvantage waivers and \n1,482 individuals served by In-Home Supports for Adults waivers.11  The State has \nestimated that half these individuals (and thus in excess of 10,000) are at serious \nrisk of institutionalization as a result of the arbitrary termination of these critical \nservices.12 \n121. All  members  of  this  class  are  subject  to  the  same  termination  of  waiver \nservices, at the same time, and based on the same common decision. \n122. Each member of the class likewise received substantially the same notice of \nthis  common termination  decision,  as  well  as  the  class member’s lack of any \noption or means to appeal or pursue alternative non-institutional services. \n11http://www.okdhs.org/OKDHS%20PDF%20Library/Office%20of%20Communications\n/DHSBudgetWorkProgramfor$69MLossofFunding_ocom_10252017.pdf \n12http://newsok.com/without-a-deal-10000-people-could-be-forced-into-nursing-homes/ar\nticle/5569386 \n25 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 26 of 37\n123. There are questions of law and fact as to the permissibility of the Defendants’ \narbitrary policy of terminating waiver programs for Medicaid beneficiaries that are \ncommon to all members of the class. \n124. Common  questions  of  law  and  fact  predominate  over  questions  affecting \nindividual Class Members. These questions of law and fact common to members \nof the class include, but are not limited to:  \na. the fact that all Plaintiffs and Class Members receive Oklahoma Medicaid \nfunded waiver services that will be terminated on December 1, 2017, due to \nthe common action of DHS that applies to all of the Class Members, \nb. the  fact  that  this  termination  places  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  at \nsignificant risk of institutionalization, \nc. the fact that neither DHS nor OHCA has developed or offered alternative \noptions or services to prevent all Plaintiffs and Class Members from being \nforced into institutionalization, and \nd. the determination of whether Defendants’ actions violate federal law.  \n125. Due  to these  and other common issues of law and fact, the prosecution of \nseparate  actions  by  individual  members  of  the  class  would  create  a  risk  of \ninconsistent or varying adjudications, establishing incompatible rules of law for \nthe provision of services to people with disabilities served by the waiver programs. \n26 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 27 of 37\n126. Prosecution of separate actions by individual class members would create a \nrisk  of  inconsistent  or  varying  adjudications  with  respect  to  individual  class \nmembers which also would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the \nDefendants and could as a practical matter be dispositive of the interests of the \nother  members  or  substantially  impair  or  impede  their  ability  to protect their \ninterests.  \n127. Defendant Lake’s common termination of all Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ \nwaiver  services  without  provision  for  any  non-institutional  alternatives  has \naffected  and  will  affect  the  class  generally,  thereby  making  appropriate  final \ninjunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole.  \n128. Named  Plaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately  represent  the  interests  of  all \nmembers of the class. Specifically, they are current recipients of the ADvantage or \nIn-Home  Supports  Waivers,  were  informed  their  waiver  services  would  be \nterminated December 1, 2017, will again receive notice on March 1, 2017, and are \nat risk of institutionalization without waiver services. \n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nCOUNT  I:  VIOLATION  OF  TITLE  II  OF  THE  AMERICANS  WITH \nDISABILITIES ACT  \n \n129. Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  herein  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation and paragraph set forth previously.   \n27 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 28 of 37\n130. Defendant Lake is Director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services \n(DHS), which is a public entity under the ADA. \n131. Each Plaintiff is a “qualified individual with a disability” within the meaning \nof the ADA in that they (1) have a physical impairment that substantially limits \none or more major life activities; (2) are capable of safely living in their homes \nwith necessary services; and (2) meet the essential requirements for the Oklahoma \nMedicaid program. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n132. Defendant Lake’s termination of the waiver services that Plaintiffs require in \norder  to  avoid  institutional  placements,  and  to  remain  in  the  integrated  home \nsettings appropriate to their needs, constitutes unlawful discrimination in violation \nof Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n133. Defendant  Lake’s  agency  (DHS)  has  arbitrarily  implemented  a  policy  to \nterminate Plaintiffs’ critical waiver services without reassessment of need or the \nprovision of replacement services, thereby placing Plaintiffs and Class Members at \nimminent  risk  of  institutionalization  in  violation  of  the  ADA’s  integration \nmandate. \n134. Defendants have utilized criteria and methods of administration that subject \nPlaintiffs and Class Members to discrimination on the basis of disability, including \nrisk  of  unnecessary  institutionalization,  by  including  but  not  limited  to,  the \nfollowing: \n28 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 29 of 37\na. failing to properly assess for replacement services and supports that would \nenable Plaintiffs and Class Members to remain in the community;  \nb. failing  to  provide  alternative  waiver or  replacement services  needed to \nenable Plaintiffs and Class Members to remain in the community;  \nc. basing its decision to terminate the waiver programs solely on economic \nconsiderations  not  taking  into  account  the  assessed  needs  of  the \nparticipants; and \nd. allocating  resources  for  institutional  versus  community  long-term  care \ncontrary to the desires and needs of people with disabilities. \n135. In  enacting  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  Congress  found  that \n“[i]ndividuals  with  disabilities  continually  encounter  various  forms  of \ndiscrimination, including...segregation....” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(5).  \n136. Title  II  of  the Americans  with  Disabilities Act  provides  that “no qualified \nindividual  with  a  disability  shall,  by  reason  of  disability,  be  excluded  from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity or be subjected to discrimination by such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n137. Regulations  implementing  Title  II  of  the  ADA  make  clear  that  the  ADA \nrequires that: “A public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with \ndisabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n29 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 30 of 37\n138. The U.S. Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 \n​ ​\n(1999),  held  that  the  unnecessary  institutionalization  of  individuals  with \ndisabilities is a form of discrimination under Title II of the ADA. In doing so, the \nCourt interpreted the ADA’s “integration mandate” to require that persons with \ndisabilities be served in the community when: (1) community-based treatment is \nappropriate;  (2)  the  individual  does not oppose community placement; and (3) \ncommunity placement can be reasonably accommodated. Id. at 607. \n139. Defendants will arbitrarily terminate the waiver programs, subjecting Plaintiffs \nto  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability,  by  terminating  Plaintiffs’  waiver \nservices  and  failing  to  assess  the  needs  and  provide  alternative  services  to \nPlaintiffs to prevent their unnecessary institutionalization. \n140. The  Olmstead  decision  and  ADA  regulations  mandate  “when  treatment \n​ ​\nprofessionals  have  determined  that  community  placement  is  appropriate  for \ndisabled  individuals,  those  individuals  do  not  oppose  the  placement, and  the \nprovision of services would not constitute a “fundamental alteration,” states are \nrequired to place those individuals in community settings rather than institutions.” \nFisher v. Oklahoma Health Care Authority, 335 F.3d 1175, 1181-82 (10th Cir. \n​\n2003), citing Olmstead v. L.C. 527 U.S. at 601-03, 119 S.Ct. 2176. \n​ ​\n141. Defendants’ actions thus violate Title II of the ADA.13 \n13 According to U.S. Department of Justice Guidance, “budget cuts can violate the ADA \n​ ​\nand Olmstead when significant funding cuts to community services create a risk of \n​ ​\n30 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 31 of 37\nCOUNT II: VIOLATION OF SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT \nOF 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 794) \n​\n142. Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  herein  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation and paragraph set forth previously.   \n143. Each Plaintiff is a “qualified person with a disability” within the meaning of \nSection  504,  because  they  (1)  have  physical  and/or  mental  impairments  that \nsubstantially limit one or more major life activities; and (2) meet the essential \neligibility  requirements  for  community-based  services  under  Oklahoma’s \nMedicaid programs.  \n144. Both  Defendants  conduct,  operate,  and/or  administer  programs  of  the \nOklahoma state Medicaid program, are recipients of federal funds, and therefore \nare subject to the requirements of Section 504. \n145. Defendants’  actions  have  placed  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  at  risk  of \nunnecessary  confinement  in  institutions,  i.e., nursing facilities,  rather than  the \n​\ncommunity,  in  order  to obtain  long-term care services, in violation of Section \n504’s integration mandate. \ninstitutionalization or segregation.  The most obvious example of such a risk is where \nbudget cuts require the elimination or  reduction of community services specifically \ndesigned for individuals who would be institutionalized without such services.  In making \nsuch budget cuts, public entities have a duty to take all reasonable steps to avoid placing \nindividuals at risk of institutionalization,” see, \nhttps://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&a_olmstead.htm.  \n​\n31 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 32 of 37\n146. Defendants have utilized criteria and methods of administration that subject \nPlaintiffs and Class Members to discrimination on the basis of disability, including \nrisk of unnecessary institutionalization, by \na. failing to properly assess for replacement services and supports that would \nenable Plaintiffs and Class Members to live in the community,  \nb. failing  to  base  service  decisions  on  individualized  needs  assessments \ninstead of purely economic concerns; and \nc. allocating resources for institutional versus long-term care contrary to the \ndesires and needs of people with disabilities. \n147. The denial of waiver services or any suitable alternatives that Plaintiffs require \nin  order  to  avoid  segregation  in  institutional  placements  and  to  remain  in \nintegrated home settings that are appropriate to their needs constitutes unlawful \ndiscrimination in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n148. Defendants have implemented a policy of administration that subjects Plaintiffs \nto  discrimination on the  basis  of  disability,  including unnecessary institutional \nsegregation, by failing to ensure that Plaintiffs and Class Members have access to \nMedicaid-covered  or  state-funded  waiver  services  that  meet  their needs in the \ncommunity and/or requiring Plaintiffs to live in institutional settings in order to \nobtain the services they need. \n32 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 33 of 37\n149. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, on which the ADA is modeled, \nsets forth similar protections against discrimination by recipients of federal funds, \nsuch  as  the  Defendants’  agencies.  29  U.S.C.  §§  794-794a.  These  protections \ninclude the prohibition against unnecessary segregation of people with disabilities. \nRegulations implementing Section 504 require that a public entity administer its \nservices, programs and activities in “the most integrated setting appropriate” to the \nneeds of qualified individuals with disabilities. 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d). \n150. Section  504’s  regulations  prohibit recipients of  federal  financial assistance \nfrom utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration...(i) [t]hat have the effect of \nsubjecting  qualified  handicapped  persons  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \nhandicap  [or] (ii) that have  the  purpose  or effect of defeating or substantially \nimpairing  accomplishment  of  the  objectives  of  the  recipient’s  program  with \nrespect to handicapped persons. 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(I); 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  and  Putative  Class  Members  respectfully  request that this \nCourt do the following: \n1. Certify this action as a class action; \n2. Designate  Plaintiffs  as  class representatives  pursuant to  Federal Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 23, and designating Counsel for Plaintiffs as Counsel for the Class; \n33 \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 6   Filed 12/06/17   Page 34 of 37\n3.

To  be \neligible  for  IHS  Waiver,  DHS  determined  that  Tomas  requires  the  level  of  care \nthat  is  provided  in  an  Intermediate  Care  Facility  for  Individuals  with  Intellectual \nDisabilities  (ICF/IID).  Instead  of going  to  an  ICF,  he  lives  at  home  and  receives  16 \n10\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  11  of  34 \nhours  per  week  of  Habilitation  Training  Specialist  Services  (HTS)  and  40  hours \nper  week  of  Vocational  Services  through  Oklahoma’s  IHS  Waiver  program.  In \naddition,  Tomas  receives  29  hours  per  week  of  personal  care  assistance  and  one \nadditional  hour  of personal  care  each  weekend  for  laundry. \n49.The  IHS  Waiver  also  allows  Tomas’  nine  prescription  medications  to  be  paid  for \nby  Medicaid.  Without  the  IHS  waiver,  Oklahoma  Medicaid  limits  prescription \ncoverage  for  adults  to  six  prescriptions  per  month.  Without  the  additional \ncoverage,  Plaintiff's  parents  cannot  afford  Tomas’s  nine  medications. \n50. Plaintiff  Davis’s  parents  were  notified  by  DHS  that  Tomas’s  IHS  Waiver \nVocational  Services  will  be  terminated  on  December  1,  2017.  In  addition,  Plaintiff \nDavis’s  parents  were  notified  that  Tomas’s  Personal  Care  Services  will  be \nterminated.  This  means  that  all  Tomas’s  DHS  services  will  be  terminated. \n51. Plaintiff  Davis’s  parents  were  informed  of  the  elimination  of  the  IHS  Waiver  in \nNovember  2017,  when  they  received  a  letter  from  OKDHS.  The  letter  did  not \nprovide  alternative  sources  of  care  for  Tomas.  He  was  not  offered  the  Community \nWaiver  as  potential  alternative  care. \n52.  Without  the  IHS  Waiver  for  Tomas,  Tomas’s  parents  will  be  forced  to  place \nTomas  in  an  ICF. \n53.  When  assessed  for  the  IHS  Waiver,  OKDHS  determined  the  16  hours  a  week  of \nHTS  services,  29  hours  per  week  of  personal  care  services  and  40  Vocational \n17\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  12  of  34 \nEmployment  hours  are  the  services  Tomas  needs  in  order  to  have  his  medical \nneeds  met  at  home,  rather  than  in  an  institution. \n54.  Tomas’s  HTS  works  two  hours  each  morning,  seven  days  per  week  getting  Tomas \nout  of  bed,  assisting  him  with  toileting,  personal  hygiene,  meal  preparation  and \nbreakfast,  dressing  and  getting  ready  for  his  vocational  center.  His  HTS  also  works \ntwo  hours  each  evening,  seven  days  per  week  assisting  him  with  meal  time, \npersonal  hygiene,  bathing,  and  getting  Tomas  ready  for  and  into  bed.  The  IHS \nWaiver  also  provides  Tomas  40  hours  per  week  vocational  employment  services \nthrough  Oklahoma’s  IHS  Waiver.  These  are  small  group  vocational  services  where \nhe  receives  a  high  level  of support  with  a  1  to  5  staff ratio. \n55.  Without  the  85  hours  of  care  per  week,  Plaintiff Davis’s  parents  will  be  forced  to \nbe  place  Tomas  in  a  nursing  home  or  other  institution.  Plaintiff  Davis’s  parents \nwant  him  to  remain  in  their  home  and  receive  services  there.  Tomas  also  wishes  to \nremain  in  his  home,  with  his  family  and  people  who  are  familiar  to  him. \n56. Plaintiff  Davis’s  parents  both  work  full-time  jobs  outside  of  the  home  and  are \nunable  to  provide  Tomas  the  care  he  requires  due  to  their  work  demands.  Plaintiff \nDavis’s  parents  must  continue  working  as  without  both  their  incomes  they  would \nno  longer  be  able  to  afford  their  house  payment  and  they  would  lose  their  home, \nwhich  means  Tomas  losing  his  home  as  well. \n12\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  13  of  34 \n57. Plaintiff  Davis’s  parents  have  both  sustained  physical  injury  from  years  of  lifting \nTomas  and  can  no  longer  provide  the  level  of care  he  needs  without  the  assistance \nof paid  staff,  an  expense  they  cannot  afford  to  pay  themselves. \n58.  Notice  of  the  termination  of the  IHS  has  interfered  already  with  Plaintiff Davis’s \ncare.  It  has  led  to  several  of  Tomas’s  personal  care  staff quitting  in  anticipation  of \nneeding  to  find  other  employment. \n59. Plaintiff's  parents  believe  this  change  in  routine  and  uncertainty  has  contributed \nto,  if not  caused,  an  increase  in  Tomas’  seizures,  including  a  Grand  Mal  seizure  on \nNovember  14,  2017. \nPlaintiff Rhonda  Cassell  (through  Legal  Guardian  Janis  Harris) \n60. Plaintiff Rhonda  Cassell  is  a  43  year  old  individual  who  lives  with  her  mother  and \nlegal  guardian,  Janis  Harris,  in  Durant,  Oklahoma. \n61. Plaintiff  Cassell  has  been  diagnosed  with  Traumatic  Brain  Injury  (TBI),  Seizure \nDisorder  and  double  vision. \n62. Plaintiff  Cassell’s  TBI  occurred  at  age  7  when  she  was  hit  by  a  car  and  was \ncomatose  for  three  months  and  was  not  expected  to  survive.  She  is  paralyzed  on \nthe  left  side.  Rhonda  is  highly  susceptible  to  falls  due  to  her  paralysis  and  double \nvision.  She  uses  a  wheelchair  most  of  the  time  as  she  can  only  walk  very  short \ndistances  with  assistance.  If there  is  no  handrail,  she  requires  physical  support  with \nwalking.  She  requires  assistance  getting  in  and  out  of vehicles. \n13\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  14  of  34 \n63. Plaintiff  Cassell  requires  assistance  and  supervision  anytime  she  goes  out  in  the \ncommunity.  She  cannot  be  by  herself  as  she  is  susceptible  to  being  taken \nadvantage  of  by  others,  is  impulsive,  frequently  falls,  and  is  unaware  of  danger. \nShe  will  give  her  money  away  to  family  members. \n64. Plaintiff  Cassell  requires  assistance  with  bathing  and  dressing.  She  is  incontinent \nand  wears  briefs.  She  has  frequent  “accidents”  and  soils  her  clothes.  When  she  has \naccidents,  her  caregivers  must  change  and  wash  her  clothing  and  clean  her  body. \nShe  cannot  cook  and  her  food  must  be  cut  up  to  prevent  choking. \n65. Plaintiff  Cassell  receives  medical  care  through  Oklahoma’s  Medicaid  In  Home \nSupports  Waiver.  Her  In  Home  Supports  Waiver  will  end  December  1,  2017. \n66.DHS  administers  the  Oklahoma  In  Home  Supports  Waiver  (IHS  Waiver).  To  be \neligible  for  the  IHS  Waiver,  DHS  determined  that  Rhonda  requires  the  level  of \ncare  that  is  provided  in  an  Intermediate  Care  Facility  for  Individuals  with \nIntellectual  Disabilities  (ICF/IID). \n67. Instead  of going  to  an  ICF,  Cassell  lives  at  home  and  receives  28  hours  per  week \nof  Habilitation  Training  Specialist  Services  (HTS)  through  Oklahoma’s  IHS \nWaiver  program.  She  has  been  authorized  to  receive  this  amount  of  services  for \nthe  past  20  years.  Without  these  hours  of  care,  she  will  be  forced  to  be  placed  ina \nnursing  home  or  other  institution. \n14\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  15  of  34 \n68. Plaintiff  Cassell  has  an  HTS  who  works  28  hours  per  week  and  takes  care  of  all \nher  needs.  This  HTS  provides  all  of Rhonda’s  care  during  the  28  hours  she  works. \nThe  HTS  bathes  Rhonda,  dresses  her,  and  feeds  her.  The  HTS  also  toilets  and \nchanges  Rhonda’s  briefs  throughout  the  day.  The  HTS  assists  her  when  she  has \ntoileting  “accidents”  by  changing  and  washing  her  clothing  and  cleaning  her  body. \nThe  HTS  monitors  Rhonda  to  prevent  and  limit  her  frequent  falls.  She  assists \nRhonda  anytime  she  goes  into  the  community. \n69. Plaintiff  Cassell’s  mother  provides  care  for  Rhonda  beyond  the  28  hours  her  HTS \nprovides.  Because  Rhonda  requires  24-hour  care,  Cassell’s  mother  must  meet  all \nof  her  needs  beyond  those  of  her  HTS.  The  HTS  services  allows  her  mother  to \nmeet  these  additional  care  needs. \n70.  Cassell’s  mother  has  been  diagnosed  with  Lupus,  Osteoarthritis,  and  Congestive \nHeart  Failure.  Her  health  conditions  makes  it  impossible  to  provide  the  additional \ncare  Rhonda  needs  on  a  daily  basis  if she  loses  her  IHS  Waiver  services.  Plaintiffs \nmother  is  unable  to  provide  24-hour  care  she  requires  and  will  place  her  in  an \ninstitution  if her  IHS  Waiver  is  eliminated. \n71. Plaintiff's  mother  learned  of the  elimination  of the  IHS  Waiver  in  November  2017 \nwhen  she  received  a  letter  from  OKDHS.  The  letter  did  not  provide  alternative \nsources  of  care  for  Rhonda.  She  was  not  offered  Medicaid  Home  Health  Care,  or \nthe  Community  Waiver  as  potential  alternative  care.  Due  to  her  high  level  of need, \n15\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  16  of  34 \nRhonda  will  be  forced  to  be  institutionalized  in  an  ICF,  nursing  home  or  other \nfacility. \n72.Rhonda  does  not  want  to  be  forced  to  move  to  an  institution.  She  has  her  own \nbedroom  that  she  decorated.  She  enjoys  living  with  her  mother,  visiting  friends, \nand  shopping.  Plaintiff  Cassell  wants  to  stay  in  her  home  that  she  has  lived  in  for \nmany  years. \nPlaintiff Lori  Taylor \n73. Plaintiff  Lori  Taylor  is  a  52  year  old  person  with  physical  disabilities  residing  in \nNorman,  Oklahoma.  Plaintiff  Taylor  enjoys  creative  projects,  including \nphotography,  and  has  won  photography  competitions. \n74. Plaintiff  Taylor  is  an  active  community  member,  donating  her  time  to  serve  on  the \nSteering  Committee  for  the  City  of  Norman’s  ADA  Transition  Plan.  She  is  also \none  of the  founding  members  of Oklahoma  ADAPT. \n75. Plaintiff  Taylor  has  cerebral  palsy,  and  is  unable  to  walk.  Plaintiff  uses  the \nassistance  of a  wheelchair. \n76. Plaintiff  Taylor  is  able  to  brush  her  teeth,  bathe,  and  use  the  restroom \nindependently,  but  she  is  unable  to  groom  herself or  transport  herself from  her  bed \nwithout  assistance. \n16\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  17  of  34 \n77.Plaintiff  Taylor  receives  services  through  the  Medicaid  ADvantage  Waiver \nprogram.  Such  services  include  the  assistance  of  a  hospital  bed,  home  health  aide, \nspecialized  adaptive  equipment,  and  a  Life  Alert. \n78. Plaintiff  Taylor  has  lived  independently  since  she  was  17  years  old.  Prior  to \nreceiving  the  ADvantage  waiver  services,  Taylor’s  ex-husband  was  her  caretaker. \n79. Plaintiff  Taylor  now  lives  alone  and  does  not  have  a  caretaker.  Plaintiffs  closest \nfamily  member,  her  mother,  lives  two  hours  away  and  does  not  have  the  physical \nability  to  assist  Plaintiff Taylor  with  her  essential  daily  needs. \n80. Plaintiff  Taylor  receives  17.75  hours  of  services  from  a  home  health  aide, \nprovided  by  the  ADvantage  program.  The  home  health  aide  comes  to  Taylor’s \nhome  daily  to  assist  with  her  personal  needs,  such  as  bathing,  physically  getting \nout  of bed,  housework  and  cooking. \n81.  Without  the  help  of the  home  health  aide  provided  by  the  program,  Taylor  would \nnot  be  able  to  physically  get  into  or  out  of her  bed.  If Plaintiff  is  not  in  bed,  and \nher  aide  does  not  come  to  assist  her,  she  will  be  forced  to  sleep  in  her  motorized \nwheelchair.  Plaintiff then  would  be  susceptible  to  infection  in  the  form  of swollen \nlimbs  and  pressure  sores. \n82.  Without  her  home  health  aide,  Plaintiff  Taylor  also  will  not  be  able  to  groom \nherself or  perform  daily  self-care  activities. \n17\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  18  of  34 \n83. Plaintiff  Taylor  learned  of the  elimination  of her  ADvantage  Waiver  in  November \n2017  when  she  received  a  letter  from  DHS  which  provided  no  alternative  sources \nof care. \n84. Because  the  services  provided  through  the  ADvantage  Waiver  are  essential  to  her \ncare,  Plaintiff  Taylor  will  be  forced  into  a  nursing  home  or  other  institutional \nfacility  if her  services  are  terminated. \n85. Plaintiff  Taylor  does  not  want  to  live  in  a  nursing  home.  Plaintiff  Taylor  wants  to \ncontinue  living  in  and  serving  her  community  through  art  and  activism  for  people \nwith  disabilities. \nDefendants \n86.  Defendant  Becky  Pasternik-Ikard  is  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Oklahoma \nHealth  Care  Authority  (OHCA).  The  OHCA  is  the  single  state  agency  for \nMedicaid  administration.  See  63  O.S.  §§5000.24-5029. \n87. Defendant  Ed  Lake  is  the  Director  of the  Oklahoma  State  Department  of Human \nServices  (DHS).  Acting  under  color  of  state  law,  Defendant  Lake  holds  executive \nauthority  over  the  administration  of the  ADvantage  Waiver  and  In-Home  Supports \nWaiver  programs  since  DHS  is  the  entity  responsible  for  administering  the  waiver \nprograms  once  established  by  OHCA.  See  56  O.S.  §  1017.4. \n18\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  19  of  34 \nSTATEMENT  OF  FACTS \n88.  Title  XIX  of  the  Social  Security  Act  establishes  the  federal-state  Medicaid \nprogram.  See  42  U.S.C.  §81396—-1396w-5.  The  purpose  of Medicaid  is  to  furnish, \nas  far  as  practicable,  “medical  assistance  on  behalf of  .  .  .  aged,  blind  or  disabled \nindividuals,  whose  income  and  resources  are  insufficient  to  meet  the  costs  of \nnecessary  medical  services”  and  “to  help  such  families  and  individuals  to  attain  or \nretain  capability  for  independence  or  self-care.”  42  U.S.C.  §1396-1. \n89. Participation  in  the  Medicaid  program  by  states  is  voluntary.  If  a  state  elects  to \nparticipate  in  the  Medicaid  program,  it  must  “comply  with  detailed  federally \nmandated  standards.”  Antrican  v.  Odom,  290  F.3d  178,  183  n.2  (4th  Cir.  2002). \nParticipating  states  are  reimbursed  by  the  federal  government  for  a  majority  of the \ncosts  of Medicaid  benefits.  See  42  U.S.C.  §  1396b. \n90. Participating  states  must  designate  a  “single  state  agency”  to  administer  the \nMedicaid  program.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396a(a)(5).  Oklahoma  has  elected  to  participate \nin  Medicaid,  and  the  state  has  designated  the  Oklahoma  Health  Care  Authority \n(OHCA)  as  its  single  state  agency  for  administration.  See  63  OSS. \n§§5000.24-5029. \n91.  While  OHCA  is  the  single  state  agency  for  administration  of the  State  Medicaid \nprogram,  DHS  is  the  entity  responsible  for  administering  the  waiver  programs, \n19\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  20  of  34 \nincluding  the  ADvantage  Waiver  and  the  In-Home  Supports  Waiver  for  Adults \nonce  established  by  OHCA.  See  56  OS.  §  1017.4. \n92. Participation  in  Medicaid  requires  Oklahoma,  and  other  participating  states,  to \ncover  certain  mandatory  services.  42  U.S.C.  §8§  1396a(a)(10),  1396d(a).  In \naddition,  a  state  may  choose  to  provide  certain  optional  services.  Once  a  state \nchooses  to  provide  an  optional  service,  it  must  fully  adhere  to  the  applicable \nrequirements  of  federal  law  and  regulations.  See  Lankford  v.  Sherman,  451  F.3d \n496,  504  (8th  Cir.  2006). \n93.Oklahoma  has  chosen  to  provide  ADvantage  Waiver  and  In-Home  Supports \nWaivers  for  Adults  programs  for  vulnerable  Oklahomans.  More  than  20,000 \nindividuals  are  served  by  these  waivers  and  are  now  at  serious  risk  of \ninstitutionalization  as  a  result  of  Defendant  Lake’s  arbitrary  termination  of  the \nwaivers.’ \n94.  The  ADvantage  Waiver  is  a  program  for  “frail  elderly”  persons  and  adults  over  the \nage  of  21  who  have  a  physical  disability.  Individuals  are  required  to  be  evaluated \nand  determined  “nursing-home  eligible”  by  nursing  staff of DHS’s  Aging  Services \nDivision  in  order  to  participate  in  the  program.  Instead  of living  in  a  nursing  home, \nhowever,  recipients  of the  ADvantage  waiver  are  able  to  live  in  their  own  home  or \n  \nThttp://www.okdhs.org/OKDHS%20PDF%20Library/Office%200f%20Communications/ \nDHSBudgetWorkProgramfor$69MLossofFunding ocom_10252017.pdf \n20\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  21  of  34 \nthe  home  of  a  family  member.  The  benefits  of  this  program  are  manifold  and \ninclude  fiscal  benefits  to  the  state  and  quality  of life  benefits  to  the  individual. \n95.The  In-Home  Supports  Waiver  for  Adults  is  a  Medicaid  program,  operated  within \nthe  larger  “Home  and  Community  Based  Services  Waivers”  program  offered  by \nthe  State  of  Oklahoma  for  individuals  over  the  age  of  18  with  an  intellectual \ndisability.  See  OAC  317:40-1-1.  Recipients  must  meet  the  Institutional  Care \nFacility  for  Individuals  with  Intellectual  Disabilities  (ICF/IID)  Level  of  Care \nrequirements  per  OAC  317:30-5-122. \n96.  Without  the  In-Home  Supports  Waiver  for  Adults,  recipients  would  require \nplacement  in  an  institutional  setting.’  Instead  of  being  forced  to  live  in  an \ninstitution,  however,  individual  recipients  of  the  In-Home  Supports  Waiver  for \nAdults  live  in  their  own  home,  foster  home,  group  home,  or  the  home  of a  family \nmember.  The  waiver  provides  necessary  services,  such  as  adaptive  equipment, \nspeech,  physical,  and  occupational  therapies,  medical  supplies,  family  training, \nand  nursing  services. \n97. Defendant  Lake’s  agency,  DHS,  has  indicated  its  intent,  through  written  notice  to \nparticipants  and  providers,  to  arbitrarily  terminate  both  the  ADvantage  Waiver  and \nIn-Home  Supports  Waiver  for  Adults  programs  effective  December  1,  2017. \n  \n8  http://www.okhca.org/individuals.aspx?id=8 149 \n21\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  22  of  34 \n98.DHS’s  written  30-day  notices  of  arbitrary  termination  provided  no  opportunity  for \nparticipants  to  have  a  hearing  or  to  appeal  Defendant  Lake’s  summary  decision  to \nterminate  the  programs  in  their  entirety. \n99.OHCA  is  required  to  provide  institutional  care  for  Medicaid  recipients,  including \nall  waiver  recipients  at  risk  of  institutionalization  resulting  from  DHS’s  arbitrary \ntermination  of the  waiver  programs. \nCLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n100.  This  complaint  is  brought  as  a  statewide  class  action  pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ. \nP.  23(a)  and  (b)(2)  on  behalf  of  all  current  Oklahoma  ADvantage  Waiver  and \nIn-Home  Supports  Waiver  recipients  whose  services  are  set  to  be  eliminated  by \nDefendants,  effective  December  1,  2017,  and  who  are  at  significant  risk  of \ninstitutionalization  as  a  result  of Defendants’  actions. \n101.  The  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is  impracticable.  DHS \nrecently  reported  that  21,147  individuals  are  served  by  ADvantage  waivers  and \n1,482  individuals  served  by  In-Home  Supports  for  Adults  waivers.?  The  State  has \nestimated  that  half  these  individuals  (and  thus  in  excess  of  10,000)  are  at  serious \nrisk  of  institutionalization  as  a  result  of  the  arbitrary  termination  of these  critical \nservices. !° \n  \n*http://www.okdhs.org/OKDHS%20PDF%20Library/Office%200f%20Communications/ \nDHSBudgetWorkProgramfor$69MLossofFunding ocom_10252017.pdf \n'Ohttp://newsok.com/without-a-deal-10000-people-could-be-forced-into-nursing-homes/ar \nticle/5569386 \n22\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  23  of  34 \n102.  All  members  of  this  class  are  subject  to  the  same  termination  of  waiver \nservices,  at  the  same  time,  and  based  on  the  same  common  decision. \n103.  Each  member  of  the  class  likewise  received  substantially  the  same  notice  of \nthis  common  termination  decision,  as  well  as  the  class  member’s  lack  of  any \noption  or  means  to  appeal  or  pursue  alternative  non-institutional  services. \n104.  There  are  questions  of  law  and  fact  as  to  the  permissibility  of the  Defendants’ \narbitrary  policy  of terminating  waiver  programs  for  Medicaid  beneficiaries  that  are \ncommon  to  all  members  of the  class. \n105.  Common  questions  of  law  and  fact  predominate  over  questions  affecting \nindividual  Class  Members.  These  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  members \nof the  class  include,  but  are  not  limited  to: \na.  the  fact  that  all  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  receive  Oklahoma  Medicaid \nfunded  waiver  services  that  will  be  terminated  on  December  1,  2017,  due  to \nthe  common  action  of DHS  that  applies  to  all  of the  Class  Members, \nb.  the  fact  that  this  termination  places  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  at \nsignificant  risk  of institutionalization, \nc.  the  fact  that  neither  DHS  nor  OHCA  has  developed  or  offered  alternative \noptions  or  services  to  prevent  all  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  from  being \nforced  into  institutionalization,  and \nd.  the  determination  of whether  Defendants’  actions  violate  federal  law. \n23\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  24  of  34 \n106.  Due  to  these  and  other  common  issues  of  law  and  fact,  the  prosecution  of \nseparate  actions  by  individual  members  of  the  class  would  create  a  risk  of \ninconsistent  or  varying  adjudications,  establishing  incompatible  rules  of  law  for \nthe  provision  of services  to  people  with  disabilities  served  by  the  waiver  programs. \n107.  Prosecution  of  separate  actions  by  individual  class  members  would  create  a \nrisk  of  inconsistent  or  varying  adjudications  with  respect  to  individual  class \nmembers  which  also  would  establish  incompatible  standards  of  conduct  for  the \nDefendants  and  could  as  a  practical  matter  be  dispositive  of  the  interests  of  the \nother  members  or  substantially  impair  or  impede  their  ability  to  protect  their \ninterests. \n108.  Defendant  Lake’s  common  termination  of  all  Plaintiffs’  and  Class  Members’ \nwaiver  services  without  provision  for  any  non-institutional  alternatives  has \naffected  and  will  affect  the  class  generally,  thereby  making  appropriate  final \ninjunctive  relief with  respect  to  the  class  as  a  whole. \n109.  Named  Plaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately  represent  the  interests  of  all \nmembers  of the  class.  Specifically,  they  are  current  recipients  of the  ADvantage  or \nIn-Home  Supports  Waivers,  were  informed  their  waiver  services  would  be \nterminated  December  1,  2017,  and  are  at  risk  of institutionalization  without  waiver \nservices. \n24\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  25  of  34 \nCAUSES  OF  ACTION \nCOUNT  I:  VIOLATION  OF  TITLE  UW  OF  THE  AMERICANS  WITH \nDISABILITIES  ACT \n110.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  herein  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation  and  paragraph  set  forth  previously. \n111.  Defendant  Lake  is  Director  of  the  Oklahoma  Department  of Human  Services \n(DHS),  which  is  a  public  entity  under  the  ADA. \n112.  Each  Plaintiff  is  a  “qualified  individual  with  a  disability”  within  the  meaning \nof  the  ADA  in  that  they  (1)  have  a  physical  impairment  that  substantially  limits \none  or  more  major  life  activities;  (2)  are  capable  of  safely  living  in  their  homes \nwith  necessary  services;  and  (2)  meet  the  essential  requirements  for  the  Oklahoma \nMedicaid  program.  42  U.S.C.  §  12131(2). \n113.  Defendant  Lake’s  termination  of  the  waiver  services  that  Plaintiffs  require  in \norder  to  avoid  institutional  placements,  and  to  remain  in  the  integrated  home \nsettings  appropriate  to  their  needs,  constitutes  unlawful  discrimination  in  violation \nof Title  II  of the  ADA,  42  U.S.C.  §  12132. \n114.  Defendant  Lake’s  agency  (DHS)  has  arbitrarily  implemented  a  policy  to \nterminate  Plaintiffs’  critical  waiver  services  without  reassessment  of  need  or  the \nprovision  of replacement  services,  thereby  placing  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  at \nimminent  risk  of  institutionalization  in  violation  of  the  ADA’s  integration \nmandate. \n25\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  26  of  34 \n115.  Defendants  have  utilized  criteria  and  methods  of  administration  that  subject \nPlaintiffs  and  Class  Members  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of disability,  including \nrisk  of  unnecessary  institutionalization,  by  including  but  not  limited  to,  the \nfollowing: \na.  failing  to  properly  assess  for  replacement  services  and  supports  that  would \nenable  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  to  remain  in  the  community; \nb.  failing  to  provide  alternative  waiver  or  replacement  services  needed  to \nenable  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  to  remain  in  the  community; \nc.  basing  its  decision  to  terminate  the  waiver  programs  solely  on  economic \nconsiderations  not  taking  into  account  the  assessed  needs  of  the \nparticipants;  and \nd.  allocating  resources  for  institutional  versus  community  long-term  care \ncontrary  to  the  desires  and  needs  of people  with  disabilities. \n116.  In  enacting  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  Congress  found  that \n“lijndividuals  with  disabilities  continually  encounter  various  forms  of \ndiscrimination,  including...segregation....”  42  U.S.C.  §  12101(a)(5). \n117.  Title  If  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  provides  that  “no  qualified \nindividual  with  a  disability  shall,  by  reason  of  disability,  be  excluded  from \nparticipation  in  or  be  denied  the  benefits  of  services,  programs,  or  activities  of  a \npublic  entity  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  by  such  entity.”  42  U.S.C.  §  12132. \n26\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  27  of  34 \n118.  Regulations  implementing  Title  II  of  the  ADA  make  clear  that  the  ADA \nrequires  that:  “A  public  entity  shall  administer  services,  programs,  and  activities  in \nthe  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with \ndisabilities.”  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(d). \n119.  The  U.S.  Supreme  Court  in  Olmstead  v.  L.C.  ex  rel.  Zimring,  527  U.S.  581 \n(1999),  held  that  the  unnecessary  institutionalization  of  individuals  with \ndisabilities  is  a  form  of  discrimination  under  Title  II  of the  ADA.  In  doing  so,  the \nCourt  interpreted  the  ADA’s  “integration  mandate”  to  require  that  persons  with \ndisabilities  be  served  in  the  community  when:  (1)  community-based  treatment  is \nappropriate;  (2)  the  individual  does  not  oppose  community  placement;  and  (3) \ncommunity  placement  can  be  reasonably  accommodated.  Id.  at  607. \n120.  Defendants  have  arbitrarily  terminated  the  waiver  programs,  subjecting \nPlaintiffs  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability,  by  terminating  Plaintiffs’ \nwaiver  services  and  failing  to  assess  the  needs  and  provide  alternative  services  to \nPlaintiffs  to  prevent  their  unnecessary  institutionalization. \n121.  The  Olmstead  decision  and  ADA  regulations  mandate  “when  treatment \nprofessionals  have  determined  that  community  placement  is  appropriate  for \ndisabled  individuals,  those  individuals  do  not  oppose  the  placement,  and  the \nprovision  of  services  would  not  constitute  a  “fundamental  alteration,”  states  are \nrequired  to  place  those  individuals  in  community  settings  rather  than  institutions.” \n27\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  28  of  34 \nFisher  vy.  Oklahoma  Health  Care  Authority,  335  F.3d  1175,  1181-82  (10th  Cir. \n2003),  citing  Olmstead v.  L.C.  527  U.S.  at  601-03,  119  S.Ct.  2176. \n122.  Defendants’  actions  thus  violate  Title  II  of the  ADA.\" \nCOUNT  II:  VIOLATION  OF  SECTION  504  OF  THE  REHABILITATION  ACT \nOF  1973  (29  U.S.C.  §  794) \n123.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  incorporate  herein  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation  and  paragraph  set  forth  previously. \n124.  Each  Plaintiff  is  a  “qualified  person  with  a  disability”  within  the  meaning  of \nSection  504,  because  they  (1)  have  physical  and/or  mental  impairments  that \nsubstantially  limit  one  or  more  major  life  activities;  and  (2)  meet  the  essential \neligibility  requirements  for  community-based  services  under  Oklahoma’s \nMedicaid  programs. \n125.  Both  Defendants  conduct,  operate,  and/or  administer  programs  of  the \nOklahoma  state  Medicaid  program,  are  recipients  of  federal  funds,  and  therefore \nare  subject  to  the  requirements  of Section  504. \n  \n11  According  to  U.S.  Department  of Justice  Guidance,  “budget  cuts  can  violate  the  ADA \nand  Olmstead when  significant  funding  cuts  to  community  services  create  a  risk  of \ninstitutionalization  or  segregation.  The  most  obvious  example  of such  a  risk  is  where \nbudget  cuts  require  the  elimination  or  reduction  of community  services  specifically \ndesigned  for  individuals  who  would  be  institutionalized  without  such  services.  In  making \nsuch  budget  cuts,  public  entities  have  a  duty  to  take  all  reasonable  steps  to  avoid  placing \nindividuals  at  risk  of institutionalization,”  see, \nhttps://www.ada.gov/olmstead/g&a_olmsteahdtm..  \n28\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  29  of  34 \n126.  Defendants’  actions  have  placed  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  at  risk  of \nunnecessary  confinement  in  institutions,  7.e.,  nursing  facilities,  rather  than  the \ncommunity,  in  order  to  obtain  long-term  care  services,  in  violation  of  Section \n504’s  integration  mandate. \n127.  Defendants  have  utilized  criteria  and  methods  of  administration  that  subject \nPlaintiffs  and  Class  Members  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of disability,  including \nrisk  of unnecessary  institutionalization,  by \na.  failing  to  properly  assess  for  replacement  services  and  supports  that  would \nenable  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  to  live  in  the  community, \nb.  failing  to  base  service  decisions  on  individualized  needs  assessments \ninstead  of purely  economic  concerns;  and \nc.  allocating  resources  for  institutional  versus  long-term  care  contrary  to  the \ndesires  and  needs  of people  with  disabilities. \n128.  The  denial  of waiver  services  or  any  suitable  alternatives  that  Plaintiffs  require \nin  order  to  avoid  segregation  in  institutional  placements  and  to  remain  in \nintegrated  home  settings  that  are  appropriate  to  their  needs  constitutes  unlawful \ndiscrimination  in  violation  of Section  504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act. \n129.  Defendants  have  implemented  a  policy  of administration  that  subjects  Plaintiffs \nto  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability,  including  unnecessary  institutional \nsegregation,  by  failing  to  ensure  that  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  have  access  to \n29\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  30  of  34 \nMedicaid-covered  or  state-funded  waiver  services  that  meet  their  needs  in  the \ncommunity  and/or  requiring  Plaintiffs  to  live  in  institutional  settings  in  order  to \nobtain  the  services  they  need. \n130.  Section  504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973,  on  which  the  ADA  is  modeled, \nsets  forth  similar  protections  against  discrimination  by  recipients  of federal  funds, \nsuch  as  the  Defendants’  agencies.  29  U.S.C.  §§  794-794a.  These  protections \ninclude  the  prohibition  against  unnecessary  segregation  of people  with  disabilities. \nRegulations  implementing  Section  504  require  that  a  public  entity  administer  its \nservices,  programs  and  activities  in  “the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate”  to  the \nneeds  of qualified  individuals  with  disabilities.  28  C.F.R.  §  41.51(d). \n131.  Section  504’s  regulations  prohibit  recipients  of  federal  financial  assistance \nfrom  utiliz[ing]  criteria  or  methods  of  administration...(i)  [t]hat  have  the  effect  of \nsubjecting  qualified  handicapped  persons  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \nhandicap  [or]  (1i)  that  have  the  purpose  or  effect  of  defeating  or  substantially \nimpairing  accomplishment  of  the  objectives  of  the  recipient’s  program  with \nrespect  to  handicapped  persons.  28  C.F.R.  §  41.51(b)(3)();  45  C.F.R.  §  84.4(b)(4). \nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  and  Putative  Class  Members  respectfully  request  that  this \nCourt  do  the  following: \n1.  Certify  this  action  as  a  class  action; \n30\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  31  of  34 \n2.

Declare  that  Defendants’  policies  as  set  forth  above  violate  Plaintiffs’  and  Class \nMembers’  rights  under  the  American  with  Disabilities  Act  and  Section  504  of the \nRehabilitation  Act  by,  inter  alia: \na.  Denying  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  their  entitlement  to  services  in  the \nleast  restrictive  environment;  and \nb.  Discriminating  against  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  on  the  basis  of \ndisability  by  utilizing  methods  of  administration,  adopting  and  applying \npolicies,  and  engaging  in  practices  that  result  in  unnecessary  segregation \nand  institutionalization. \n4.  Declare  that  Defendants’  elimination  of  Plaintiffs’  Medicaid  skilled  nursing  and \nrehabilitation  services  provided  through  the  waiver  programs,  without  the \nprovision  of continuation  services  in  community-based  settings  which  are  the  most \nintegrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members, \ntogether  with  conditioning  the  receipt  of medically  necessary  Medicaid  services  on \nsegregation  in  an  institutional  or  non-community  setting,  violates  laws  which \nprohibit  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability,  prohibit  unjustified \ninstitutionalization  and  segregation,  and  which  require  Defendants  to  administer \n37\nCase  5:17-cv-01236-HE  Document1  Filed  11/17/17  Page  32  of  34 \ntheir  services  and  programs  in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs \nof the  individual  with  disabilities,  including: \na.

In \nOctober,  DHS  was  required  to  submit  a  revised  budget  to  the  Oklahoma  Office  of \nManagement  and  Enterprise  Services  to  fulfill  our  constitutional  requirements  for  a \nbalanced  budget.  Unfortunately,  the  revised  budget  resulted  in  additional  reductions  to \nDHS  services, \nWe  regret  to  inform  you  DHS  must  eliminate  the ADvantage  Waiver  effective  December  1, \n2017.

CIV-17-1236-HE \n  ) \nED LAKE, et al.,  ) \n  ) \nDefendants.  ) \n \n  ORDER \n  Plaintiffs  filed  this  putative  class  action  asserting  claims  against  the  State  of \nOklahoma based on alleged violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  The claims are based on notices sent \nin October 2017, to recipients of the Medicaid ADvantage Waiver and the Medicaid In-\nHome Supports Waiver for Adults programs indicating that, due to budget failures, their \nwaivers allowing for community-based services would be terminated as of December 1, \n2017.  This case was filed on December 6, 2017. \n  Oklahoma subsequently took steps to avoid the termination of waiver services.  \nPlaintiff’s amended complaint alleges Governor Fallin signed a stopgap budget measure \nproviding additional funding for the programs through February 2018.  The parties’ \nsubmissions indicate additional funding measures have since been enacted which provide \nsupplemental funding sufficient to maintain the programs through the end of the FY 2018 \nfiscal year.  In light of those developments as to funding, defendants have moved to dismiss \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 17   Filed 03/26/18   Page 2 of 4\npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), arguing that plaintiffs’ claims are now moot and that no \nlive controversy remains for resolution by the court. \n  Plaintiffs’  claims  stem  from  the  ADA  and  Rehabilitation  Act’s  integration \nrequirement, which requires that a public entity must “administer services, programs, and \nactivities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals \nwith  disabilities.”    28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(d).    Thus,  subject  to  various  conditions  and \nlimitations, “States are required to provide community-based treatment for persons with     \n. . . disabilities when the State’s treatment professionals determine that such placement is \nappropriate, the affected persons do not oppose such treatment, and the placement can be \nreasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the \nneeds of others with . . . disabilities.”  Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 607 \n(1999).   \n  In  response  to  the  motion,  plaintiffs  argue  that  a  continuing  violation  of  the \nintegration requirement exists because defendants acted to terminate the waiver programs \nwithout  providing  for  alternative  services,  because  the  threat  of  waiver  termination \ncontinues, and because plaintiffs are at risk of future institutional placement if waiver \nservices are terminated and alternative services are not provided. \n  “The Constitution’s case-or-controversy limitation on federal judicial authority, Art. \nIII, § 2, underpins both . . . standing and . . . mootness jurisprudence.”  Friends of the Earth, \nInc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180 (2000).  The \nstandard “for determining whether a case has been mooted by the defendant’s voluntary \nconduct is stringent.”  Id. at 189.  Ordinarily, it must be “‘absolutely clear that the allegedly \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 17   Filed 03/26/18   Page 3 of 4\nwrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur” and the party asserting \nmootness bears a “‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the court that the challenged conduct \ncannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  start  up  again.”    Id.  (quoting  United  States  v. \nConcentrated Phosphate Export Assn., 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968)).  “In practice, however, \nLaidlaw’s  heavy  burden  frequently  has  not  prevented  governmental  officials  from \ndiscontinuing challenged practices and mooting a case.”  Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. \nBureau of Reclamation, 601 F.3d 1096, 1116 (10th Cir. 2010).  “Likewise, the withdrawal \nor alteration of administrative policies can moot an attack on those policies. . . .  A case \nceases to be a live controversy if the possibility of recurrence of the challenged conduct is \nonly a speculative contingency.”  Id. at 1117 (quotations and citations omitted).   \n  The court concludes that the provision of funding for maintenance of the programs \nfor the remainder of the fiscal year renders plaintiffs’ claims moot.  The harm which \nplaintiffs sought to avoid — the termination of waiver services — has now been avoided \nfor that period, and it would be pure speculation to presume to know what funding decisions \nmay be made by Oklahoma in future years.  The result is there is no current case or \ncontroversy subject to judicial resolution. \n  Plaintiffs’ complaint of the lack of an alternative plan should funding fail in the \nfuture does not change the calculus.  The presence or absence of an alternative plan does \nnot impact the plaintiffs unless the speculative event — non-funding — occurs. \n  Plaintiffs also argue a controversy remains because “Defendants have not provided \nany assurance that their actions in maintaining the waiver programs, or in the provision of \nalternative community-based services, are permanent.”  Doc. #15, p. 8.  For this reason, \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:17-cv-01236-HE   Document 17   Filed 03/26/18   Page 4 of 4\nplaintiffs argue the state’s conduct is capable of repetition yet evading review, necessitating \nthe declaratory and injunctive relief they seek.  The problem with that argument is that, \nwhere  the  claimed  discrimination  is  inextricably  tied  to  the  level  of  future  state \nappropriations,  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  “permanent”  fix.    It  is  doubtful  that  the \nLegislature could assure some future funding level for these programs even if it wanted \nto.1  Further, acceptance of such a justification for continuing jurisdiction in this court \nwould put it in the position of being some sort of ongoing supervisor of the state budget \nprocess, a result that is inconsistent with the federalism and other constitutional principles \nwhich guide and limit the resolution of challenges like those asserted here by plaintiffs.2  \n  Should the State of Oklahoma fail to provide funding for community-based services \nin future fiscal years, or fail to provide for appropriate alternatives if those services are cut, \na live case or controversy may then exist.  At present, one does not.  Defendants’ Motion \nto Dismiss [Doc. #14] is therefore GRANTED.  This case is DISMISSED without \nprejudice.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated this 26th day of March, 2018. \n \n \n                                              \n1 See Application of Okla. Capitol Improvement Auth., 958 P.2d 759, 771 (Okla. 1998) \n(noting that legislative attempts to bind future legislatures are unconstitutional).   \n2 See Olmstead, 527 U.S. 581, at 612-3 (Kennedy concurrence).  \n4 \n ",
