Pursuant to the letter from Petitioner's counsel dated September 13, 2017 29 , the Motion to Expedite Hearing on Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus 2 should be designated as withdrawn. Petitioner's counsel has also designated that letter as a motion seeking expedited discovery. The letter does not comply with Local Rule of Civil Procedure 7 and should not be designated as a motion. The Clerk of Court is directed to redesignate the letter as simply providing a status update. If any party seeks affirmative relief from the Court, compliance with this Court's Local Rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is required, including filing a notice of motion setting forth the relief requested, a memorandum of law, and any affidavit in support of the motion. In addition, if a party seeks to have a motion determined on an expedited basis, a separate motion for an expedited hearing is required. At this time, the Court does not intend to conduct a telephone conference to discuss scheduling because scheduling orders have been issued for any pending motions. In addition, the parties are reminded that, while the Court encourages cooperation between the parties and efforts to come to an agreement on a mutually acceptable schedule with respect to any pending motion in this case, it is the Court that sets the schedule - not the parties - and therefore, scheduling deadlines issued by the Court cannot be changed by agreement between the parties without the Court's approval.

Currently pending before the Court is a 32 Motion to Expedite Consideration of Motion for Expedited Discovery, wherein Petitioners seek to expedite the briefing and this Courts consideration of their 31 Motion for Discovery. Petitioners represent that the documents they seek in discovery will be used to support an anticipated Motion for Preliminary Injunction that will be filed no later than September 25, 2017. Also pending before the Court is Respondents 27 Motion to Dismiss wherein, among other arguments, Respondents contend that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. As a result, a threshold issue that this Court will have to determine before considering the granting of any relief to Petitioners - whether it be in the form of discovery or preliminary injunctive relief - is whether the Court has jurisdiction to consider the claims. Having considered the respective arguments by the parties, and the procedural posture of this case, the Court grants the 32 Motion to Expedite, in part, to the extent that the Court will set a briefing schedule for Petitioners 31 Motion for Discovery and consider the issues set forth therein on a more expedited basis than it might otherwise, but the motion is otherwise denied, including to the extent that Petitioners seek a determination on the 31 Motion for Discovery prior to the Court resolving the 27 Motion to Dismiss. Accordingly, papers in response to the 31 Motion for Discovery are hereby due on or before October 2, 2017. Upon receipt of all papers, court will determine if oral argument is necessary, and if so, inform parties of the date and time. SO ORDERED. Signed Hon. Elizabeth Wolford on 9/19/17.

The Court clarifies that the November 17, 2017, Decision requires that once an IJ has determined that a detainee shall be released on bond, he or she must consider the financial circumstances of each subclass member and alternative conditions of release in setting the amount of bond. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that for all subclass members provided a bond hearing pursuant to the Court's November 17, 2017, Decision, the IJ, when setting the terms of any subclass member's release at a bond hearing, must consider alternative conditions of release and the individual's ability to pay; and it is further ORDERED that for those subclass members who have already received a bond hearing pursuant to the November 17, 2017, Decision who remained detained notwithstanding an IJ's determination that release on bond would be appropriate, bond hearings must be recalendared and the record reopened for the IJ to consider alternative conditions of release and the individual's ability to pay; and it is further ORDERED that counsel for Respondents shall notify Class Counsel of the date and location of each bond hearing set pursuant to this Decision and Order at leave five days in advance of the hearing.

Petitioners have filed a motion requesting that the Court hold a status conference to determine an appropriate process by which to address the issues now before it upon remand by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. (Dkt. 92; see Dkt. 90). While the Court agrees that formulating an orderly process is appropriate, due to the Court's criminal docket, it does not presently have time to schedule a status conference. However, in lieu of a status conference, the Court hereby orders that counsel confer and submit a joint proposal to address a briefing schedule and a proposed oral argument date for the pending 91 motion to vacate and any other related applications for relief by Wednesday November 7, 2018. If counsel are unable to agree upon a joint proposal, each side must submit its own competing proposal by November 7, 2018. Upon review of the parties' filings, the Court will issue an appropriate briefing schedule and will set a date for oral argument. Briefing on Respondents' 91 motion to vacate is held in abeyance until further order of the Court. SO ORDERED. Signed by Hon. Elizabeth A. Wolford on 11/02/2018. (PFC) (Entered: 11/02/2018)"

          "description": "TEXT ORDER. The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions 94 95 in response to the Court's Text Order 93 . After considering the issues and the parties' respective positions, the Court is not inclined to hold briefing in abeyance with respect to any properly- filed motion. This does not mean that the Court will deny Petitioners' anticipated motion for limited discovery, nor does it mean that Petitioners cannot oppose the pending Motion to Vacate on the ground that discovery is needed to adequately address the motion. If the Court ultimately determines that limited discovery is warranted, it may very well defer rendering a decision on any pending substantive motion and permit the parties to supplement their filings. But at this stage, the Court is not in a position to determine whether, indeed, it will permit limited discovery — particularly where no such motion has been filed. While Respondents advance setting a briefing schedule in accordance with this Court's Local Rules, the briefing deadlines set forth in the Court's Local Rules apply only in the absence of a Court Order, and as a matter of practice this Court sets its own briefing schedules. Accordingly, the Court hereby sets the following briefing schedule for the Motion to Vacate 91 . Petitioners' papers in opposition are due on or before December 7, 2018, and any reply papers are due on or before December 21, 2018. The Court intends to schedule oral argument to address this motion, and a date and time for oral argument will be subsequently scheduled. Upon the filing of any further motion as referenced in the parties' submissions, including any motion for discovery or motion to decertify the class, the Court will set a briefing schedule with respect to that motion.

Petitioners request that the Court adjourn the motion hearing currently set for May 29, 2019, because Petitioners' attorneys who had been preparing for oral argument will be unavailable. Petitioners request for oral argument to be adjourned until after July 8, 2019. Respondents argue that Petitioners have not established good cause for their requested adjournment, and that Respondents would be prejudiced if the Court entertained any further adjournment of the oral argument date. However, the primary reasons for the delay up to this point have been the partial government shutdown and the Court's criminal calendar. Petitioners have not engaged in dilatory tactics to stall the Court's consideration of the pending motions, and it is likely that oral argument would have already taken place had the Court not had to reschedule briefing deadlines and the initial oral argument date in light of the government shutdown. The Court considers Petitioners' general request for an adjournment to be reasonable, and thus, the Court grants Petitioners' 134 motion to adjourn oral argument. Nonetheless, adjourning oral argument to a date after July 8, 2019, is not warranted under the circumstances. Petitioners and Respondents have suggested alternative dates for oral argument that would be amenable to both sides. In balancing Petitioners' need for additional time to prepare and Respondents' concern for delaying the resolution of the pending motions, the Court hereby adjourns oral argument to June 10, 2019, at 12:30 PM in US Courthouse, 2 Niagara Square, Buffalo, NY 14202-3350 before the undersigned. The motion hearing will be held at the federal courthouse in Buffalo because the undersigned will be there on trial in a criminal case.

          "description": "TEXT ORDER. The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions 94 95 in response to the Court's Text Order 93 . After considering the issues and the parties' respective positions, the Court is not inclined to hold briefing in abeyance with respect to any properly-filed motion. This does not mean that the Court will deny Petitioners' anticipated motion for limited discovery, nor does it mean that Petitioners cannot oppose the pending Motion to Vacate on the ground that discovery is needed to adequately address the motion. If the Court ultimately determines that limited discovery is warranted, it may very well defer rendering a decision on any pending substantive motion and permit the parties to supplement their filings. But at this stage, the Court is not in a position to determine whether, indeed, it will permit limited discovery—particularly where no such motion has been filed. While Respondents advance setting a briefing schedule in accordance with this Court's Local Rules, the briefing deadlines set forth in the Court's Local Rules apply only in the absence of a Court Order, and as a matter of practice this Court sets its own briefing schedules. Accordingly, the Court hereby sets the following briefing schedule for the Motion to Vacate 91 . Petitioners' papers in opposition are due on or before December 7, 2018, and any reply papers are due on or before December 21, 2018. The Court intends to schedule oral argument to address this motion, and a date and time for oral argument will be subsequently scheduled.Upon the filing of any further motion as referenced in the parties' submissions, including any motion for discovery or motion to decertify the class, the Court will set a briefing schedule with respect to that motion.

On January 4, 2019, the Court granted Respondents' motion to stay all deadlines pending in this action in light of the lapse in the Department of Justice's appropriations due to the partial government shutdown. (Dkt. 109). The Court also required Respondents to notify the Court as soon as Congress had appropriated funds for the Department of Justice. The Court indicated that it would issue a scheduling order setting deadlines for the pending motions in this matter after receiving input from the parties. Respondents have filed a 111 notice alerting the Court that Congress has appropriated funds for the Department of Justice as of January 25, 2019, and its attorneys have resumed their usual civil litigation functions as of January 28, 2019. Accordingly, the Clerk of Court is directed to lift the stay in this action, and the Court hereby orders counsel to confer and submit a joint proposal—or, if counsel are unable to agree, individual proposals—by Monday, February 4, 2019, to address a further briefing schedule in this case. Counsel must also indicate their availability for oral argument after April 1, 2019.

          "description": "TEXT ORDER granting in part 134 Motion to Adjourn Oral Argument. Petitioners request that the Court adjourn the motion hearing currently set for May 29, 2019, because Petitioners' attorneys who had been preparing for oral argument will be unavailable. Petitioners request for oral argument to be adjourned until after July 8, 2019. Respondents argue that Petitioners have not established good cause for their requested adjournment, and that Respondents would be prejudiced if the Court entertained any further adjournment of the oral argument date. However, the primary reasons for the delay up to this point have been the partial government shutdown and the Court's criminal calendar. Petitioners have not engaged in dilatory tactics to stall the Court's consideration of the pending motions, and it is likely that oral argument would have already taken place had the Court not had to reschedule briefing deadlines and the initial oral argument date in light of the government shutdown. The Court considers Petitioners' general request for an adjournment to be reasonable, and thus, the Court grants Petitioners' 134 motion to adjourn oral argument. Nonetheless, adjourning oral argument to a date after July 8, 2019, is not warranted under the circumstances. Petitioners and Respondents have suggested alternative dates for oral argument that would be amenable to both sides. In balancing Petitioners' need for additional time to prepare and Respondents' concern for delaying the resolution of the pending motions, the Court hereby adjourns oral argument to June 10, 2019, at 12:30 PM in US Courthouse, 2 Niagara Square, Buffalo, NY 14202-3350 before the undersigned. The motion hearing will be held at the federal courthouse in Buffalo because the undersigned will be there on trial in a criminal case. If for some reason that changes, the parties will be so advised. SO ORDERED. Signed by Hon. Elizabeth A. Wolford on 5/17/19. (PFC) (Entered: 05/17/2019)"

The Court clarifies that the November 17, 2017, Decision requires that once an IJ has determined that a detainee shall be released on bond, he or she must consider the financial circumstances of each subclass member and alternative conditions of release in setting the amount of bond. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that for all subclass members provided a bond hearing pursuant to the Court's November 17, 2017, Decision, the IJ, when setting the terms of any subclass member's release at a bond hearing, must consider alternative conditions of release and the individual's ability to pay; and it is further ORDERED that for those subclass members who have already received a bond hearing pursuant to the November 17, 2017, Decision who remained detained notwithstanding an IJ's determination that release on bond would be appropriate, bond hearings must be recalendared and the record reopened for the IJ to consider alternative conditions of release and the individual's ability to pay; and it is further ORDERED that counsel for Respondents shall notify Class Counsel of the date and location of each bond hearing set pursuant to this Decision and Order at leave five days in advance of the hearing.

Currently pending before the Court is a 32 Motion to Expedite Consideration of Motion for Expedited Discovery, wherein Petitioners seek to expedite the briefing and this Courts consideration of their 31 Motion for Discovery. Petitioners represent that the documents they seek in discovery will be used to support an anticipated Motion for Preliminary Injunction that will be filed no later than September 25, 2017. Also pending before the Court is Respondents 27 Motion to Dismiss wherein, among other arguments, Respondents contend that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. As a result, a threshold issue that this Court will have to determine before considering the granting of any relief to Petitioners - whether it be in the form of discovery or preliminary injunctive relief - is whether the Court has jurisdiction to consider the claims. Having considered the respective arguments by the parties, and the procedural posture of this case, the Court grants the 32 Motion to Expedite, in part, to the extent that the Court will set a briefing schedule for Petitioners 31 Motion for Discovery and consider the issues set forth therein on a more expedited basis than it might otherwise, but the motion is otherwise denied, including to the extent that Petitioners seek a determination on the 31 Motion for Discovery prior to the Court resolving the 27 Motion to Dismiss. Accordingly, papers in response to the 31 Motion for Discovery are hereby due on or before October 2, 2017. Upon receipt of all papers, the court will determine if oral argument is necessary, and if so, inform the parties of the date and time. SO ORDERED. Signed Hon. Elizabeth A. Wolford on 9/19/17.

Pursuant to the letter from Petitioner's counsel dated September 13, 2017 29, the Motion to Expedite Hearing on Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus 2 should be designated as withdrawn. Petitioner's counsel has also designated that letter as a motion seeking expedited discovery. The letter does not comply with Local Rule of Civil Procedure 7 and should not be designated as a motion. The Clerk of Court is directed to redesignate the letter as simply providing a status update. If any party seeks affirmative relief from the Court, compliance with this Court's Local Rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is required, including filing a notice of motion setting forth the relief requested, a memorandum of law, and any affidavit in support of the motion. In addition, if a party seeks to have a motion determined on an expedited basis, a separate motion for an expedited hearing is required. At this time, the Court does not intend to conduct a telephone conference to discuss scheduling because scheduling orders have been issued for any pending motions. In addition, the parties are reminded that, while the Court encourages cooperation between the parties and efforts to come to an agreement on a mutually acceptable schedule with respect to any pending motion in this case, it is the Court that sets the schedule - not the parties - and therefore, scheduling deadlines issued by the Court cannot be changed by agreement between the parties without the Court's approval.

    "summary": "<p>On July 28, 2017, an asylum-seeker who had been held in federal detention for nine months sought habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York.  Three weeks later, represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the International Refugee Assistance Project, he and a fellow asylum-seeker filed an amended petition and class action complaint against the Department of Homeland Security.  They challenged the federal government’s authority to indefinitely detain arriving asylum-seekers who had been determined likely to win the right to remain in the United States.  They asserted that such detention, without parole or bond hearing, was a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Immigration and Naturalization Act, and 8 C.F.R. §212.5.  The case was assigned to Judge Elizabeth A. Wolford.</p><p>The complaint sought to certify a class of “all arriving asylum-seekers who have passed a credible fear interview and who are or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility and who have not been granted parole,” as well as a sub-class who “have been or will be detained for more than six months without a bond hearing before an immigration judge.”</p><p>An overbroad plaintiffs’ discovery motion was denied in November 2017.  292 F.Supp.3d 592.  </p><p>On November 17, 2017, the court denied the government’s motion to dismiss the suit, simultaneously granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  280 F.Supp.3d 373.  The injunction required the government to give detainees access to parole procedures as described in Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Directive 11002.1.  Additionally, relying on the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning in <a href=“http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12492\"><i>Jennings v. Rodriguez</i></a>, reasoning which was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court, the court found that 8 U.S.C. 1225(b) implicitly prohibits indefinite detention, and ordered the government to offer bond hearings to asylum-seekers within six months of their detention.  For continued detention, the government must prove at the bond hearing that the asylum-seeker is a flight risk or a danger to the community.  In February 2018, the court clarified the injunction, requiring that once “an [Immigration Judge] has determined that a detainee should be released on bond, he or she must consider the financial circumstances of each [detainee] and alternative conditions of release in setting the amount of bond.”  287 F.Supp.3d 327 at 345.</p><p>Class certification was granted on December 19, 2017, and the preliminary injunction of November 17 was applied to the newly-certified class.  323 F.R.D. 131.  </p><p>In January 2018, the government appealed the November 17 orders (Second Circuit Docket No. 18-00094, Jan 12, 2018).  In late February, the Supreme Court ruled in <i>Jennings v. Rodriguez</i>, effectively overturning the district court’s November order regarding the subclass (detainees held more than six months without a bond hearing).  By consent of the parties, the Second Circuit remanded this issue to the district court on September 5, 2019.  </p><p>On September 24, 2019 the district court granted the government’s motion to decertify the subclass.  405 F.Supp.3d 467.  There was no activity in the case for nearly a year, until on July 10, 2020, the court directed the parties to submit a joint status report indicating whether the case should be closed.  The parties responded that they were in the process of meeting and conferring regarding a settlement that would resolve the case entirely. But then, on September 24, 2020, the parties informed the court that they were no longer intending to reach a settlement. The parties negotiated a discovery schedule and the court set a schedule for summary judgment motions. The petitioners' motion for summary judgment is due January 28, 2021, and the respondents' opposition and cross-motion for summary judgment is due February 25, 2021. As of December 23, 2020, this case is ongoing.</p>",

The Court granted a preliminary injunction on Nov. 17, 2017, and certified a class and a subclass in December 2017.  In February 2018, the Supreme Court's ruling in a similar case effectively overturned the district court's certification of the subclass. The district court officially decertified the subclass on September 24, 2019, but the preliminary injunction pertaining to the broader class remained in effect.

The federal government has determined that they are \nlikely to win the right to remain in the United States due to a credible fear of returning to \ntheir homelands because of a  significant possibility  of persecution  or torture  in  those \ncountries.  Upon their arrival at the U.S. border, they were taken into custody, transported \nto the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, New York, and held without parole \nor  a  bond  hearing  for  more  than  nine  months.  Petitioners  seek  relief on  behalf of \nthemselves individually and on behalf of the putative class members of similarly situated \nasylum-seekers being held in Batavia. \n- 1 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 2 of 68\nRespondents moved to dismiss this  lawsuit pursuant to  Federal Rules  of Civil \nProcedure 12(b )( 1) and 12(b )( 6), contending that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction \nover the claims and that Petitioners have failed to state a viable claim for relief.  (Dkt. 27). \nPetitioners oppose dismissal and seek a preliminary injunction on behalf of themselves and \nthe members of the putative class.  (Dkt. 38). While acknowledging that the ultimate parole \ndecision is a discretionary determination not subject to judicial review, Petitioners seek \npreliminary injunctive relief requiring procedural safeguards when adjudicating parole. \nPetitioners also seek preliminary injunctive relief requiring individualized bond hearings \nfor any detention that lasts longer than six months. \nBecause this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the claims and Petitioners \nhave. stated valid claims, the Court denies Respondents' motion to dismiss.  (Dkt. 27).  In \naddition, because irreparable harm has been established, and there is a likelihood of success \nwith respect to the claims in this litigation, the Court grants the preliminary injunctive relief \nsought by Petitioners.  (Dkt. 3 8).  Respondents must comply with their internal directive \nconcerning parole hearings-an internal  directive that Respondents  recently embraced \nbefore the Supreme Court, telling the Justices that it remained in full  force and effect. \nMoreover, after six months of detention, Respondents must provide individualized bond \nhearings and establish by clear and convincing evidence that an asylum-seeker is a flight \nrisk or a danger to the community to justify continued detention. \nAlthough  the  grant  of preliminary  injunctive  relief will  alter the  status  of the \nparties-it means that asylum-seekers being detained in Batavia will be afforded certain \nprocedural protections-the relief is nonetheless warranted because to act otherwise would \n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 3 of 68\nmean that these individuals would be detained without any appropriate process.  Although \nthe Court recognizes that the law in this area is evolving, and the legal landscape could \nchange in the future, the continued detention of these asylum-seekers who have passed \ncredible fear interviews, without being afforded minimal procedural protections, would \nresult in extreme or very serious irreparable damage.  As a result, for the reasons discussed \nfurther below, Petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 38) is granted. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nPetitioner Hanad Abdi (\"Abdi\") is a 26-year-old native of Somalia.  (Dkt. 38-5 at \n~~ 1-2).  He and his family are members of a minority tribe in Somalia.  (!d. at~ 5).  After \nrival tribal members killed his father, they captured Abdi and beat him.  (!d. at~~ 7-10). \nAbdi managed to escape and fled his home country in June 2016.  (!d. at~~ 10, 15).  After \nan arduous journey through more than ten countries, Abdi arrived at the southern U.S. \nborder on October 12, 2016, seeking asylum.  (!d.  at~~ 15-17).  After two weeks at a \ndetention center in Texas, he was transferred to the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in \nBatavia,  New York,  on  or about October 26,  2016.  (!d.  at ~ 18).  The  officer who \ninterviewed Abdi in connection with his request for asylum determined that \"[t]here is a \nsignificant possibility that the assertions underlying the applicant's claim [for asylum] \ncould be found credible in a ... hearing,\" and asylum proceedings have been scheduled \nbefore an immigration judge.  (!d. at ~~ 19-22, Ex. A &  B).  However, his requests for \nparole were repeatedly denied until August 16, 2017, when Abdi was released on parole \nafter commencement of this litigation.  (Dkt. 38-3 at~~ 16-17; Dkt. 38-5 at~~ 23-35). Abdi \n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 4 of 68\nhas subsequently been informed that his parole was revoked, but he remains out of custody. \n(!d. at~ 17). \nJohan Barrios Ramos (\"Barrios Ramos\") is a 40-year-old native and citizen of Cuba \nwho was involved with political opposition and human rights work in his native country. \n(Dkt. 38-4 at  1, 2,  4).  For 11  months, he was imprisoned in Cuba for his political \n~~ \nactivities.  (Jd. at~ 5).  He fled Cuba in December 2016, and arrived in Mexico by raft.  (Jd. \n9,  10).  He traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border, arriving on January 14, 2017, and \nat~~ \nsought asylum in the United States.  (!d. at~~ 10-11 ).  He passed his credible fear interview \n(i.e., the process through which a preliminary determination is made that an asylum-seeker \nhas a viable claim for asylum), and asylum proceedings have been scheduled.  (!d. at~~ 11, \n17).  However, his requests for parole were repeatedly denied with no explanation (id. at \n11-15)-that is, until after commencement of this litigation, when Barrios Ramos was \n~~ \nparoled on September 14,2017 (Dkt. 38-3  18). \nat~ \nIn addition to Abdi and Barrios Ramos, Petitioners have submitted declarations \nfrom 23  similarly situated individuals who have all sought asylum in this country, have \npassed their credible fear interviews, and who were detained for many months (and in some \ncases over a year) at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility without parole or a bond \nhearing.  (See  Dkt.  38-6  (Abdirashid Musa,  detained  since  January  2017);  Dkt.  38-7 \n(Muktar Mohamed, detained in January 2017, but released in September 2017 (Dkt. 51-1 \nat 6-7)); Dkt. 38-8 (Koffi Sewoul, detained since May 2017); Dkt. 38-9 (Joseph Baptiste, \ndetained in November 2016, but released in September 2017 (Dkt. 51-1 at 7)); Dkt. 38-10 \n(Dieusauveur Flezinord,  detained  since December 2016);  Dkt.  38-11  (Saikou Touray, \n-4 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 5 of 68\ndetained in January 2017, but released in October 2017 (Dkt. 51-1 at 96-97) ); Dkt. 3 8-12 \n(Salad Suraw Abdi, detained since January 20 17); Dkt. 3 8-13 (Muhamed Ahmed Hirsi, \ndetained since September 2016); Dkt. 38-14 (Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed, detained since \nJanuary 2017); Dkt. 38-15 (Abdirahman Elmi Nor, detained since January 2017); Dkt. 38-\n16 (Dayron Hernandez Gutierrez, detained in February 2017, but released in September \n2017 (Dkt. 51-1 at 6)); Dkt. 51-1 at 11 (Kazeem Akinpelu Azeez, detained since January \n2017); id. at 19 (Mamadou Barry, detained since November 2016); id. at 29 (Abdimalik \nMohamed, detained since December 2016); id. at 35 (Niang Abdou Lahad, detained since \nOctober 2016); id. at 46 (Mamadou Diallo, detained since January 2017); id. at 51 (Jacob \nAkwotark Baye, detained since October 2016); id. at 59 (Ismail Noor Mohamed, detained \nsince  September 2016);  id.  at  70  (Yacob Abraham Weldegiorgis,  detained since June \n20 17); id.  at 86 (Denel Thomas, detained since December 20 16);  id.  at  117 (Abraham \nHagos  Gashne,  detained since June  2017);  id.  at  124  (Abraham Zerom Weldemikael, \ndetained since June 20 17); id. at 131  (Bereket Araya Ghidewon, detained since October \n2016)). \nThese asylum-seekers are detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(B)(ii).  An \nindividual detained under§ 1225(b) can be paroled \"into the United States temporarily\" by \nthe Attorney General \"in his discretion.\"  8 U.S.C.  § 1182(d)(5)(A).  A 2009 directive \nissued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") (\"the ICE Directive\" or \"the \nDirective\") sets  forth  certain procedures that must be  utilized when  evaluating parole \nrequests.  (Dkt. 38-3 at 8-17); ICE Directive No. 11002.1: Parole ofA  rriving Aliens Found \n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 6 of 68\nto Have a Credible Fear ofP  ersecution or Torture (Dec. 8, 2009).1  While the Directive \nmakes it clear that parole determinations are inherently discretionary decisions, certain \nminimum  procedural  safeguards  are  required  when  making  these  discretionary \ndeterminations.  For instance, the asylum-seeker must be provided written notice of the \nparole process in a language that he or she understands, ICE Directive No. 11002.1, ,-r,-r 6.1, \n8.1, and parole interviews must normally be conducted within seven days of a credible fear \nfinding,  id.  at ,-r  8.2.  Moreover, parole decisions must be uniformly documented, id.  at \n,-r 6.2, written notification of the parole decision must be provided, id. at ,-r 6.5, and a \"brief \nexplanation  of the  reasons  for  any  decision  to  deny  parole\"  must  be  provided,  id. \nAdditionally, the asylum-seeker must be advised of the right to request a redetermination \nof the decision \"based upon changed circumstances or additional evidence.\" !d. \nEarlier this year, Respondents represented to the United States Supreme Court that \nthe ICE Directive \"remains in full force and effect.\"  See Supplemental Reply Brief for \nPetitioners,  at  6 n.2, Jennings  v.  Rodriguez, No.  15-1204 (brief filed  Feb.  21,  2017). \nNonetheless, according to Petitioners, the ICE Directive is being consistently disregarded \nand ignored at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia.  Moreover, although the \nSecond Circuit and other courts have recognized the right to a bond hearing after detention \nin certain immigration contexts that last longer than six months (including in the case of \nThe text of the ICE Directive can be found in various submissions by the parties, \nincluding at Docket 3 8-3, pages 8-17.  Throughout the remainder of this Decision, the \nCourt will cite directly to the Directive:  ICE Directive No. 11002.1. \n- 6 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 7 of 68\naliens with criminal records detained under 8 U.S.C.  § 1226), in this case none of the \nasylum-seekers have been granted a bond hearing. \nOn July 28, 2017, Petitioners filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  (Dkt. 1) . \nPetitioners filed  an amended petition on August 21, 20 17,  as well as  a complaint for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  (Dkt. 17).  In the amended petition, Petitioners raise class \naction allegations and assert that Respondents have violated and continue to violate the \nstatutory and constitutional rights of Petitioners and the members of the putative class.  (!d. \nat 23-24).  Petitioners allege that Respondents maintain a practice of denying parole to \nasylum-seekers detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility who have passed a \ncredible fear interview.  (!d.  at 1-2).  Petitioners also allege that a subclass of similarly \nsituated asylum-seekers have been or will be detained for more than six months without a \nbond hearing before an immigration judge.  (!d. at 3). \nOn August  25,  2017,  Petitioners  moved to  certify  the  class.  (Dkt.  19).  On \nSeptember 12, 2017, Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to \nstate  a  claim.  (Dkt.  27).  On  September 25,  2017,  Petitioners  filed  a  motion  for  a \npreliminary injunction.  (Dkt. 38).  After briefing on the motion to dismiss (Dkt. 48; Dkt. \n49), and the preliminary injunction motion (Dkt. 50; Dkt. 51), oral argument was held \nbefore the undersigned on October 27, 2017, at which time the Court reserved decision. \nDISCUSSION \nPetitioners  contend  that  the  parole  practices  at  the  Buffalo  Federal  Detention \nFacility have changed significantly since President Trump came into office.  Petitioners \noffer various statistics supporting their contentions (Dkt. 3 8-17), as well as testimony from \n- 7 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 8 of 68\ndetained asylum-seekers that they have been told by immigration officials that the Trump \nadministration has eliminated parole (see, e.g., Dkt. 38-5 at~ 36; Dkt. 38-6 at~ 3; Dkt. 38-\n13  at  5; Dkt. 38-14 at  2).  While acknowledging \"changes in general enforcement \n~  ~ \nobjectives under the Trump Administration\" (Dkt. 50-1  4), Respondents contest that \nat~ \nthe change in administration has caused any alteration of policy (Dkt. 50-2  2). \nat~ \nThis  Court  cannot  determine  based  on  the  written  record  the  reasons  for  any \nalteration in the parole practices in Batavia.  However, the motivations behind the failure \nto follow the ICE Directive at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility or to provide bond \nhearings after six months of detention-while perhaps politically meaningful-are not \nlegally significant.  What is important to this Court's analysis is the fact that the Directive \nis being violated and that asylum-seekers are being held for longer than six months without \nindividualized bond hearings.  Respondents do not, and cannot, ultimately contend that \nthey are adhering to the dictates of the ICE Directive or providing bond hearings after six \nmonths of detention.  Instead, they take the position that the ICE Directive is not legally \nenforceable and that bond hearings are not required.  Because the Court disagrees on both \ncounts, the motions before the Court can be resolved on the papers.  Respondent's motion \nto dismiss is denied, and Petitioners' preliminary injunction motion is granted. \nI.  Respondents' Motion to Dismiss \nRespondents seek dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b )( 1) , arguing \nthat this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider Petitioners' parole claims, and \nunder Rule 12(b )( 6), contending that Petitioners have failed to state a valid claim for habeas \n- 8-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 9 of 68\ncorpus relief.  In addition, Respondents contend that the release from custody of both Abdi \nand Barrios Ramos renders moot any claims asserted in this litigation. \nBecause Petitioners do not challenge the ultimate decision to deny parole, but rather \nchallenge the procedures employed when evaluating a parole request, this Court has subject \nmatter jurisdiction to consider the parole claims.  Moreover, Petitioners have stated valid \nclaims challenging both the failure to follow the ICE Directive in connection with parole \ndecisions, and the failure to grant a bond hearing to those individuals detained longer than \nsix months pursuant to Lora v.  Shanahan, 804 F .3d 601  (2d Cir. 20 15), petition for cert. \nfiled,  84  U.S.L.W.  3562  (U.S.  Mar.  25,  2016) (No.  15-1205),  cross-petition for cert. \ndenied,  136 S.  Ct. 2494 (2016).  Finally, the release of Abdi and Barrios Ramos from \ncustody does not render their claims moot because, at any time, those decisions could be \nreversed at Respondents' discretion. \nA.  Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(l) \nRespondents argue that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider Petitioners' claims \nregarding the denial of temporary parole.  (Dkt. 27-1 at 14).  Federal courts are courts of \nlimited jurisdiction and possess only that power authorized by Article III of the United \nStates  Constitution  and  statutes  enacted  by  Congress  pursuant  thereto.  Bender  v. \nWilliamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986).  The party asserting jurisdiction \nbears the burden of establishing that a court has jurisdiction over a particular claim.  !d. \nWhen  a movant challenges  subject matter jurisdiction,  a district  court may  \"consider \naffidavits and other materials beyond the pleadings\" and \"weigh the evidence and satisfy \nitself as to the existence of its power to hear the case.\"  Iqbal v.  Sec 'y,  US.  Dep 't of \n- 9 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 10 of 68\nHomeland Sec.,  190  F.  Supp.  3d  322,  326-27  (W.D.N.Y.  2016)  (citations  omitted). \nHowever, the court \"must take all  facts  alleged in the complaint as true and draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\"  Hadees v. Johnson, 5:15-CV-1087, 2016 \nWL 5349789, at* 1 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2016) (citations omitted). \nPetitioners were detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b). That statute provides that \nif a non-citizen \"who is arriving in the United States\" indicates an intention to apply for \nasylum or expresses a  fear  of persecution or torture,  the  individual is  referred for  an \ninterview to determine whether he or she has a credible fear of persecution.2  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(l)(A)(ii).  If the individual is determined to have a credible fear of persecution, \nhe  \"shall  be  detained  for  further  consideration  of the  application  for  asylum.\"  !d. \n§ 1225(b)(l)(B)(ii). \nAn individual detained under § 1225(b) can be paroled \"into the United States \ntemporarily\" by the Attorney General \"in his discretion.\"  !d. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  Agency \nregulations provide that the Secretary of Homeland Security \"may invoke\" the authority to \nparole an individual who is \"neither a security risk nor a risk of absconding\" and meets one \nor more of a series of conditions, one of which is that \"continued detention is not in the \npublic interest.\"  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(a), (b)(5).  The ICE Directive explains how the term \n\"public interest\" is  to be interpreted.  See  ICE Directive No.  11002.1.  The Directive \n2  A credible fear of persecution is defined under the statute as follows:  \"there is a \nsignificant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the \nalien in support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that \nthe  alien  could  establish  eligibility  for  asylum  under  [8  U.S.C.  §  1158].\"  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(l)(B)(v). \n- 10-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 11 of 68\nprovides that \"[ e ]ach alien's eligibility for parole should be considered and analyzed on its \nown merits and based on the facts of the individual alien's case.\"  !d. at~ 6.2.  When an \narriving alien found to have a credible fear establishes to the satisfaction of ICE his or her \nidentity and that he or she presents neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, \n\"[ICE] should, absent additional factors ... parole the alien on the basis that his or her \ncontinued detention is not in the public interest.\" !d. \nPursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), \"no court shall have jurisdiction to review \n. . . any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of \nthe  Attorney  General  or the  Secretary of Homeland  Security,\" with the  exception of \ndeterminations regarding eligibility to apply for asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a).  The \nSecond Circuit has construed the phrase \"this subchapter\" in § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to mean \n\"subchapter II of Chapter 12 ofTitle 8 ofthe United States Code, which includes§§ 1151-\n1381.\" Sanusi v. Gonzales, 445 F .3d 193, 198 (2d Cir. 2006). The temporary parole sought \nby Petitioners is governed by § 1182( d)( 5)(A), and therefore is subject to the jurisdictional \nrestrictions of§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  In other words, parole decisions are at the discretion of \nthe Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security; thus, discretionary decisions \nregarding  parole  under  § 1182(d)(5)(A)  are  not  reviewable  by  a  court,  pursuant  to \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  See,  e.g.,  Viknesrajah  v.  Koson, No.  09-CV-6442 CJS, 2011  WL \n147901, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2011). \nPetitioners acknowledge that the Attorney General's discretionary decisions to deny \nparole are not subject to judicial review.  (Dkt. 48 at 15).  However, Petitioners contend \n- 11 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 12 of 68\nthat their challenge rests on the procedures employed by Respondents in administering the \nparole process-not on the ultimate decision to grant or deny parole.  (!d.).  Respondents \ncounter that Petitioners' attempt to repackage the true nature of their claims is a distinction \nwithout a difference.  (Dkt.  49  at 7).  Respondents contend that under Giammarco v. \nKerlikowske, 665  F. App'x 24 (2d Cir. 2016), Petitioners' challenge is not reviewable. \nRespondents assert that Giammarco stands for the proposition that the process by which \nICE reaches its decisions is itself discretionary and therefore unreviewable. \nIn Giammarco, the petitioner, who had been removed from the United States as an \naggravated felon,  filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum seeking \nreentry to comply with a legislative subpoena.  !d. at 25.  The Second Circuit concluded \nthat it  lacked subject matter jurisdiction under § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) because the habeas \npetition was an indirect challenge to discretionary decisions by the respondents denying \nparole, a visa waiver, and a visitor visa.  !d.  The court explained that it lacked jurisdiction \nbecause \"a decision in [the petitioner's] favor would render the prior discretionary denials \ninvalid.\" !d. at 26. \nGiammarco is distinguishable from the facts of this case because Petitioners are not \nchallenging the discretionary decision itself.  A decision in favor of Petitioners would not \ncompel a particular result with respect to parole, but rather would impact only the execution \nof the policies and procedures surrounding the ultimate parole decision.  Petitioners are not \nasking this Court to interfere with the ultimate decision regarding parole-that issue would \nplainly fall  outside this Court's jurisdiction pursuant to  § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  However, \nPetitioners are asking that this Court ensure that Respondents comply with certain policies \n- 12-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 13 of 68\nand procedures in making that parole decision-issues that are beyond the jurisdictional \nbar of§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). \nIndeed, courts have held that the jurisdictional bar in § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is narrow. \nIn Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), the habeas petitioner challenged the Attorney \nGeneral's authority, under the post-removal-period statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6), to detain \na  removable  alien  indefinitely  beyond  the  removal  period.  !d.  at  682.  The  Court \nrecognized that § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars review of discretionary decisions under the post-\nremoval-period statute-including the decision to detain an alien ordered removed beyond \nthe removal period-but held that the petitioners were not seeking review of the Attorney \nGeneral's exercise of discretion;  \"rather, they  challenge[ d)  the  extent of the Attorney \nGeneral's authority under the post-removal-period detention statute.\"  !d.  at 688.  The \nCourt concluded that \"the extent of that authority is not a matter of discretion.\" !d. \nThe Second Circuit considered the limits of the jurisdictional bar in Sharkey v. \nQuarantillo, 541 F.3d 75 (2d Cir. 2008).  In that case, the plaintiff argued that Immigration \nand Naturalization  Service  (\"INS\")3  had  attempted to  rescind her  status  as  a Lawful \nPermanent Resident (\"LPR\") \"without following the mandatory statutory and regulatory \nprocedures governing the rescission of' that status.  !d. at 81.  INS moved to dismiss the \ncomplaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the district court granted the motion \non the basis that  § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precluded review.  !d.  at  82.  The Second Circuit \nreversed, holding that this provision did not bar the plaintiff's unlawful rescission claim \n3  The agency formerly called INS is no longer in existence, and some of its functions \nare now performed by ICE.  See Brito v. Mukasey, 521 F.3d 160, 162 n.2 (2d Cir. 2008). \n- 13 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 14 of 68\nbecause  \"the  alleged rescission was  not performed in  accordance with the  mandatory \nrescission procedures .... Thus, the alleged rescission was not 'specified ... to be in the \ndiscretion of the Attorney General.\"'  !d. at 86 (quoting First/and Int'l, Inc.  v.  INS, 377 \nF.3d 127, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2004)). \nHere, as in Zadvydas and Sharkey, Petitioners do not challenge the ultimate parole \ndecision under§ 1182(d)(5)(A).  Rather, Petitioners allege that Respondents have violated \nand continue to violate the ICE Directive that they claim to be following.  (Dkt. 17 at 2). \nPetitioners contend that the parole rate has dramatically dropped since January 2017 (id.); \nthat deportation officers told them that parole was no longer available (id.  at  15); and \nPetitioners received denial notices that did not comply with the ICE Directive (id. at 6-7, \n12-15).  Petitioners do not ask the Court to consider whether any decision to deny parole \nwas improper.  Instead, Petitioners seek a ruling that Respondents' failure to follow their \nown policy directive is unlawful.  In other words, Petitioners simply seek compliance with \ncertain minimum procedural safeguards when parole decisions are made-they do not seek \nto have this Court interfere with the ultimate parole decision.  Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) \ndoes not bar that claim. \nRespondents  attempt  to  distinguish  Zadvydas  and  Sharkey,  argumg  that  the \nchallenges in those cases were grounded in the statutory framework,  as  opposed to an \ninternal memo.  (Dkt. 49 at 8).  Petitioners challenge the failure to follow procedures that \nflow from an internal directive, and Respondents contend that internal directives are not \nbinding.  (Dkt. 27-1  at  16-17).  According to Respondents, because the procedures that \nPetitioners seek to enforce are not codified in  a statute or regulation, and because the \n- 14-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 15 of 68\ndecision to grant or deny parole is discretionary, the procedures in the ICE Directive are \nalso discretionary.  Respondents  argue that this  fact  divests this  Court of jurisdiction \nbecause the case is brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, the habeas corpus statute, which limits \nthe Court's habeas jurisdiction to reviewing for \"statutory or constitutional errors.\"  (!d. at \n17-18); Sol v. INS, 274 F.3d 648, 651 (2d Cir. 2001). \nRespondents are correct that courts in this Circuit have held that federal jurisdiction \nover  §  2241  petitions  does  not  extend  to  \"review  of  factual  or  discretionary \ndeterminations.\"  Sol, 274 F .3d at 651.  However, Respondents improperly characterize \nPetitioners' claims.  Although Petitioners have alleged facts in support of their claim that \nthe Buffalo Federal Detention Facility is failing to abide by the ICE Directive, Petitioners \nultimately contend that this failure violated their rights under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A), 8 \nC.P.R. § 212.5, and the \"Accardi doctrine\" (as discussed below). \nFor the reasons explained below in the analysis of Respondents' motion to dismiss \npursuant to Rule 12(b )( 6), the Court concludes that Petitioners have asserted questions of \nlaw,  and that Petitioners'  claims therefore fall  within this  Court's habeas jurisdiction. \nAccordingly,  Respondents'  motion  to  dismiss  Petitioners'  parole  claims  under  Rule \n12(b )( 1) is denied. \n- 15-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 16 of 68\nB.  Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \n1.  Parole Claims \nIn  addition  to  their  jurisdictional  challenge,  Respondents  assert  that  even  if \nPetitioners'  parole  claims  are  not  precluded  by  § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii),  those  claims  are \nmeritless.  A court should consider a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a \nclaim  \"accepting  all  factual  allegations  in  the  complaint  and  drawing  all  reasonable \ninferences in the plaintiffs favor.\"  Ruotolo v.  City of New York, 514 F.3d 184, 188 (2d \nCir. 2008) (citation omitted).  The Court \"may only consider facts stated in the complaint \nor documents attached to the complaint.\" Spikes Bell v. Cont'l Sch. OfB  eauty, 11 F. Supp. \n3d 403, 406 (W.D.N.Y. 2014).  To withstand dismissal, a plaintiff must set forth \"enough \nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"  Bell At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007).  \"A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual \ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.\"  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); see also Nielsen \nv.  Rabin,  746  F.3d 58,  62  (2d Cir.  2014) (\"The plausibility standard is  not akin to a \nprobability requirement. . . .  [A] well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a \nsavvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is improbable, and that a recovery is very \nremote and unlikely.\" (citations, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted)). \n\"While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need \ndetailed  factual  allegations,  a  plaintiffs  obligation  to  provide  the  'grounds'  of his \n'entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation \nof the elements of a cause of action will not do.\"  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (alteration and \n- 16-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 17 of 68\ncitations omitted).  Thus, \"at a bare minimum, the operative standard requires the 'plaintiff \nto provide the grounds upon which his claim rests through factual allegations sufficient to \nraise a right to relief above the speculative level.\"'  Goldstein v.  Pataki, 516 F .3d 50, 56 \n(2d Cir. 2008) (alteration and citations omitted). \nRespondents argue that Petitioners fail to state a claim for relief because the ICE \nDirective is not binding, and any failure to follow its terms is not subject to legal challenge. \n(Dkt. 49 at 8-9).  Respondents contend that the ICE Directive does not create any rights, \nprivileges, or benefits enforceable against the United States.  (!d.  at 8).  According to \nRespondents, Petitioners received the process that they are due and cannot assert otherwise \non the basis of a failure to comply with the terms of an internal directive. \nPetitioners respond that the \"Accardi doctrine\" dictates that Respondents are bound \nby the ICE Directive and the procedural steps and substantive criteria that it sets out.  (Dkt. \n48 at 20-21).  In United States ex rel. Accardi v.  Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954), the \nSupreme Court held that \"regulations with the force and effect of law supplement the bare \nbones\" of federal statutes.  !d. at 265.  In that case, the Court vacated a deportation order \non the ground that the procedure that preceded the order did not conform to the relevant \nregulations.  !d. at 267-68; see also Morton v.  Ruiz, 415 U.S.  199, 235 (1974) (striking \ndown a Bureau of Indian Affairs determination that did not comply with procedures set \nforth in the agency's manual).  The Second Circuit later held, in Smith v. Resor, 406 F.2d \n141 (2d Cir. 1969), that the Accardi rationale applies even when a court is reviewing \"the \nmerits  of decisions  made  within  the  area  of discretion  delegated  to  administrative \nagencies.\"  !d.  at  145.  The court explained that courts \"have insisted that where the \n- 17-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 18 of 68\nagencies  have  laid  down their own procedures  and  regulations,  those procedures  and \nregulations  cannot  be  ignored  by  the  agencies  themselves  even  where  discretionary \ndecisions are involved.\"  Id. \nIn Monti/la v. I.NS., 926 F.2d 162 (2d Cir. 1991), the Second Circuit interpreted the \nAccardi doctrine in the immigration context and concluded that \"[i]ts ambit is not limited \nto rules attaining the status of formal regulations.\"  !d. at 167.  The court explained that \n\"' [w   ]here the rights of individuals are affected, it is incumbent upon agencies to follow \ntheir own procedures.  This is so even where the internal procedures are possibly more \nrigorous than otherwise would be required,' and even though the procedural requirement \nhas not yet been published in the federal register.\"  !d. (quoting Morton, 415 U.S. at 235). \nFollowing Monti/la, a district court in the Southern District ofNew York held that \nINS was required to adhere to internal directives in its Parole Project Memorandum, which \nlisted criteria for INS district directors to apply to parole applications and established a \nprocess for evaluating detainees'  claims.  Zhang v.  Slattery,  840 F.  Supp. 292, 293-96 \n(S.D.N.Y.  1994).  The court rejected the respondents'  argument that the memorandum \nconferred no substantive rights on detainees and lacked the force of law, explaining that \nthe important consideration was that the memorandum affected detainees' rights and was \nintended to benefit detainees seeking asylum.  !d. at 294-95.  The court relied on the \nEleventh Circuit's decision in Pasquini v. Morris, 700 F.2d 658 (11th Cir. 1983), in which \nthat court held that an INS internal operating instruction, while not providing the force and \neffect of substantive law, did confer \"the procedural right to be considered for\" deferred \n* \naction status.  !d. at 663 n.  (internal quotation marks omitted). \n- 18-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 19 of 68\nRespondents cite a number of different cases that they assert are controlling.  (Dkt. \n27-1  at  17).  The Court disagrees  and concludes that these  cases are distinguishable. \nRespondents argue that in Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 U.S. 785 (1981), the Supreme Court \nretreated from the broadest reading of Morton when it held, in a per curiam opinion, that \nan internal manual had no legal force and did not bind the Social Security Administration. \nId. at 789.  Schweiker addressed the circumstances under which the federal government \nwould be estopped from insisting upon compliance with valid regulations governing the \ndistribution of welfare benefits, and held that a government employee's \"minor breach\" of \na claims manual's internal guidelines did not justify invocation of the estoppel doctrine. \n!d. at 789-90; see also Edwards v.  US. Dep 't ofA gr., 584 F. Supp. 2d 595, 598 (W.D.N.Y. \n2008) (citing Schweiker and holding, without further explanation, that the plaintiff could \nnot rely on agency's internal manuals in arguing that it had failed to comply with internal \nrules in handling his case). Neither Accardi nor Morton are cited in the Schweiker decision, \nand the Second Circuit has continued to follow the Accardi doctrine after Schweiker.  See, \ne.g., Monti/la, 926 F.2d at 167 (recognizing that \"the cases are not uniform in requiring \nthat every time an agency ignores its own regulation its acts must subsequently be set \naside,\"  but  holding  that  \"[t]he  doctrine  has  continued  vitality,  particularly  where  a \npetitioner's rights are 'affected\"'). \nRespondents also rely on Binder & Binder P.C. v. Barnhart, 481 F.3d 141 (2d Cir. \n2007), where the Second Circuit held that the Social Security Administration could not rely \non its own internal document to vacate an award of attorney's fees.  !d. at 151.  However, \nthat case was not governed by Accardi because the \"rights of individuals\" were not affected \n- 19-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 20 of 68\nby the document at issue-the agency sought to rely on the document for its own benefit. \n!d. at 786.  See also James v.  US. Parole Comm 'n, 159 F.3d 1200 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding \nthat the petitioner could not rely on an interpretive guideline intended to guide the Parole \nCommission in its calculation of release dates consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines). \nAnd in Cruz-Miguel v. Holder, 650 F.3d 189 (2d Cir. 2011), relied on by Respondents, the \ncourt held only that, in interpreting the phrase \"paroled into the United States\" in 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1255(a)-the statute that identifies aliens who may seek \"adjustment of status\"-there \nwas  no  statutory  ambiguity.  !d.  at  200.  The  petitioners  relied  on  internal  agency \nmemoranda in arguing that Congress intended the phrase \"paroled into the United States\" \nin § 1255(a) to include aliens released on \"conditional parole\" under § 1226(a)(2)(B).  !d. \nThe  court  concluded  that  the  statute  was  unambiguous  on  that  issue,  rejecting  the \npetitioners' attempt to rely on the internal documents to contradict the plain language of \nthe statute.  !d.  Unlike in Cruz-Miguel, there is no statutory provision that unambiguously \ngoverns in this case.  This is not a situation where a statute (or regulation) sets forth the \nprocedures to be utilized in evaluating whether an asylum-seeker's \"continued detention is \nnot in the public interest,\" 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b)(5); rather, the ICE Directive sets forth those \nprocedures. \nNor do the cases that Respondents relied on most heavily at oral argument on this \nmotion resolve the issue.  Respondents argued that the court in Thevarajah v.  McElroy, \nNo. 01-cv-3009, 2002 WL 923914 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2002), declined to hold that INS \nwas bound by certain standards in a 1992 internal memorandum.  !d. at *4-5.  In reality, \nthe court in Thevarajah did not decide whether the agency was bound to apply the standards \n-20-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 21 of 68\nin the memorandum; instead, the court was \"satisfied that [the agency] took [the standards] \ninto appropriate consideration.\" !d. at *5. The court \"reject[ed] [the] petitioner's argument \nthat the District Director failed to apply the proper legal standard in denying ... parole.\" \n!d.  Similarly, in Naul v.  Gonzales, No. 05-4627 (JAG), 2007 WL  1217987 (D.N.J. Apr. \n23, 2007), another case cited by Respondents, the court found that the respondents had \ncomported with the guidelines of an internal parole memorandum.  !d. at *3 n.8.  In that \ncase, the petitioner argued that the internal memorandum \"mandate[ d] his parole,\" but the \ncourt  concluded  that  it  \"provide[ d]  guidance  to  asylum  pre-screening  interviewers \nconcerning the decision to recommend parole or not.\" !d. at *3.  Thus, neither Thevarajah \nnor Naul holds that agencies cannot be bound by internal directives.  See also Ferreras v. \nAshcroft,  160 F.  Supp. 2d 617, 624 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (stating, without explanation, that \n\"[w   ]hether the INS  followed through on its directive ... is not a constitutional matter \ngenerally,  nor  is  it  determinative  of the  statutory  provision  governing  Petitioner's \ndetention\"). \nRespondents also argue that the ICE Directive cannot create any enforceable rights \nbecause the document itself provides that it \"is not intended to, shall not be construed to, \nmay  not  be  relied  upon  to,  and  does  not  create,  any  rights,  privileges,  or  benefits, \nsubstantive  or procedural,  enforceable  by  any  party  against the  United  States.\"  ICE \nDirective No. 11002.1, tj[  10.  Respondents cite In re Grand Jury Subpoena, Judith Miller, \n438 F.3d 1141 (D.C. Cir. 2006), a case that also concerned a regulation with a provision \ndisclaiming the creation of any legally enforceable rights-in that case, Department of \nJustice (\"DOJ\") guidelines for issuing subpoenas to news media.  The news media sought \n- 21 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 22 of 68\nto set aside the finding of civil contempt on the ground that the subpoenas did not comply \nwith the DOJ regulations.  Distinguishing Morton, the court explained that the regulation \nin  that  case  was  intended to  benefit potential  beneficiaries  of government assistance, \nwhereas the DOJ guidelines in Judith Miller provided no enforceable rights to individuals \nand were merely intended to guide the discretion of prosecutors.  !d. at 1152.4  Here, in \ncontrast, the ICE Directive-like the procedure at issue in Morton-affects the rights of \nindividuals.  The  ICE  Directive  does  not  simply guide  the  discretion  of immigration \nofficials in making parole determinations.  Rather, it sets forth specific procedural rights \nfor asylum-seekers in connection with the parole process, such as being informed in writing \nas to the reason parole was denied. \nIn  short,  Respondents  cite no  case  law  that would  compel  the  conclusion that \nagencies can avoid application of Accardi by simply disclaiming any binding effect in the \ndirective itself.  To find otherwise would render the teachings of Accardi and its progeny \nmeaningless.  It is not the internal policy itself that creates (or eliminates) the rights of \nenforcement.  Rather, the relevancy of the internal policy is to ascertain whether it pertains \nto individual rights.  If so, under binding Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent, \nthat internal policy must be followed.  In the words of the Supreme Court, \"[w   ]here the \n4  Respondents' citation to United States v. Loften, 518 F. Supp. 839 (S.D.N.Y. 1981), \nis also not persuasive.  There, the court briefly addressed the defendant's claim that the \ngovernment  had  not  complied  with  the  U.S.  Attorney's  Manual  in  initiating  the \nprosecution,  and  the  court  not  only  determined  that  the  prosecution  was  properly \nauthorized, but also concluded that internal government policies could not thwart a criminal \nprosecution.  !d. at 857. \n-22-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 23 of 68\nrights  of individuals  are  affected,  it  is  incumbent upon  agencies  to  follow  their  own \nprocedures.  This is so even where the internal procedures are possibly more rigorous than \notherwise would be required ....\"   Morton, 415 U.S. at 235.5 \nHere, Respondents represented to the Supreme Court in February 2017 that the ICE \nDirective \"remains in full force and effect.\"  Supplemental Reply Brief for Petitioners, at \n6 n.2, Jennings v.  Rodriguez, No.  15-1204 (brief filed Feb. 21, 2017).  In their briefing \nsubmitted in Jennings, Respondents touted the ICE Directive as a reason for their position \nthat bond hearings are not required for asylum-seekers detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b). \n!d. at 5-6.  Respondents told the Supreme Court that \"the existing framework provides \nmore than sufficient process\" and stated that the ICE Directive \"provides for notice to the \nalien,  an  interview,  the  opportunity  to  respond  and  present  evidence,  a  custody \ndetermination ... supervisory review, and further parole consideration based upon changed \ncircumstances or new evidence.\" !d. at 6-7.  Respondents cannot now contend in this Court \nthat the ICE Directive does not affect the rights of individuals.  Plainly, the ICE Directive \naffects the rights of individuals.  As a result, Petitioners' contention that Respondents have \n5  Petitioners also rely on Bertrandv. Strava, 684 F.2d204 (2d Cir. 1982), to support \ntheir argument that Respondents' parole determinations may be challenged for failing to \ncomply  with  the  ICE  Directive  because  non-compliance  indicates  that  the  parole \ndetermination is not facially legitimate and bona fide.  (Dkt. 38-1  at 22).  Respondents \ncontend that the \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" standard no longer applies, in light of \nthe jurisdictional bar in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  (Dkt. 50 at 11-12).  See Viknesrajah \nv.  Koson,  No.  09-CV-6442  CJS,  2011  WL  147901,  at  *2  (W.D.N.Y.  Jan.  18,  2011) \n(enactment of§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) limited the applicability of Bertrand by barring review \nof \"discretionary decisions concerning parole\").  The Court need not resolve Bertrand's \ncontinued applicability at this stage of the litigation, since it has determined that Petitioners \nmay challenge the failure to comply with the procedures set forth in the ICE Directive \nunder the Accardi doctrine. \n-23-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 24 of 68\nfailed  to  comply  with  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the  ICE  Directive  when  making \ndiscretionary decisions concerning parole states a valid claim for habeas corpus relief. \n2.  Bond Hearing Claims \nRespondents also seek dismissal of Petitioners' claims that their detention without \na bond hearing violates 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b) and the Due Process Clause.  (Dkt. 27-1 at 21). \nAccording to Respondents, Petitioners are arriving aliens and are treated, for constitutional \npurposes, as if stopped at the border.  (!d.); see, e.g., Correa v. Thornburgh, 901 F.2d 1166, \n1171  n.5  (2d Cir.  1990) (\"Other than protection against gross physical abuse, the alien \nseeking initial entry appears to have little or no constitutional due process protection.\"). \nTherefore, Respondents contend, Petitioners are ineligible for the constitutional protections \nguaranteed to persons inside the United States.  (Dkt. 27-1 at 21). \nPetitioners  are  detained pursuant to  §  1225(b).  Nothing  in that statute  or the \nassociated regulations limits the length of detention.  See Saleem v.  Shananhan, No. 16-\nCV-808 (RA), 2016 WL 4435246, at* 2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2016), appealfiled, No. 16-\n3587 (2d Cir. Oct. 21, 2016).  Furthermore, neither the Supreme Court nor the Second \nCircuit  has  addressed  whether  indefinite  detention  under  §  1225(b) violates the Due \nProcess Clause, but the issue is currently pending before both courts.6 \nIn Lora, the Second Circuit considered the question of indefinite detention in the \ncontext  of §  1226(c ),  which  mandates  detention  during  the  pendency  of removal \n6  The issue is before the Supreme Court in Jennings v. Rodriguez, No. 15-1204 (U.S. \nargued Nov. 30, 2016), and before the Second Circuit in Arias v. Aviles, No. 16-3186 (2d \nCir. filed Sept. 12, 2016) (proceedings stayed pending the outcome of Jennings). \n-24-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 25 of 68\nproceedings of non-citizens who have committed certain criminal offenses.  804 F .3d at \n613-16.  The Second Circuit joined the Third, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits in concluding that, \nto avoid \"serious constitutional concerns,\" § 1226( c) must be read to include a temporal \nlimitation on detention.  I d.  at 613.  The Second Circuit, following the reasoning of the \nNinth Circuit in Rodriguez v.  Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2013) (\"Rodriguez \nIF'), held that \"an immigrant detained pursuant to section 1226( c) must be afforded a bail \nhearing before an immigration judge within six months of his or her detention.\" Lora, 804 \nF.3d  at  616.  The  Court held that the  detainee  \"must be  admitted to  bail  unless the \ngovernment establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the immigrant poses a risk \nof flight or a risk of danger to the community.\" I d.  at 616 (quoting Rodriguez II, 715 F .3d \nat1131). \nA number of courts in the Southern District of New York have considered cases \ninvolving detention pursuant to§ 1225(b), the statute under which Petitioners in this case \nare detained.  Those courts are split on whether Lora extends to § 1225(b ).  In Cardona v. \nNalls-Castillo, 177 F. Supp. 3d 815 (S.D.N.Y. 2016), the court held that an LPR detained \nunder§ 1225(b) was not entitled to a bond hearing, regardless of the length of detention. \nId. at 816.  By way of analysis, the court stated only that Lora had addressed the issue in \nthe context of§ 1226(c) and was therefore inapplicable to an individual detained under \n§ 1225(b),  and  that  § 1225(b)  and  accompanying  regulations  do  not  provide  for  an \nindividualized bond hearing.  I d.  The court reached the same conclusion in Perez v. Aviles, \n188 F. Supp. 3d 328 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).  There, the court explained that there had been no \n-25-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 26 of 68\n\"unreasonable delay\" in pursuing or completing the petitioner's removal, and, thus, no \nviolation of the petitioner's due process rights.  !d. at 332.7 \nBy contrast, in Arias v. Aviles, No. 15-CV-9249 (RA), 2016 WL 3906738 (S.D.N.Y. \nJuly  14,  2016), appeal filed,  No.  16-3186 (2d  Cir.  Sept.  12,  2016), the  district court \nextended the reasoning in Lora to an LPR detained under§ 1225(b ).  !d. at * 10.  The court \nexplained that because the petitioner in that case was an LPR who had traveled abroad only \nbriefly, he possessed \"a right to due process just as would a continuously present alien.\" \n!d. at *8 (quoting Landon v.  Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982)).  Therefore, the court \nconcluded that the petitioner was entitled to the same rights afforded the petitioner in Lora. \n!d.; Galo-Espinal v.  Decker, No.  17 Civ. 3492, slip op at 4-5 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2017) \n(same,  noting the \"emerging consensus among courts in this  district that due process \nrequires  that  individuals  detained  pursuant  to  Section  1225(b)  be  provided  an \nindividualized bond hearing within six months of detention\"); Morris v.

Saleem, 2016 WL 4435246 at* 4; see \nalso  Rodriguez  v.  Robbins,  804  F.3d  1060,  1070  (9th  Cir.  2015)  (\"Rodriguez  !IF') \n(rearticulating holding in Rodriguez II), cert. granted sub nom. Jennings v. Rodriguez, 136 \nS. Ct. 2489 (20 16). In Rodriguez II, the Ninth Circuit cited to the Supreme Court's decision \nin Clark v.  Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381  (2005), and applied the canon of constitutional \navoidance to hold that individuals detained under § 1225(b) are entitled to a bond hearing \nafter six months of detention.  715 F.3d at 1141-42; see also Rodriguez III, 804 F.3d at \n1082.  The  court  explained  that  \"where  one  possible  application  of a  statute  raises \nconstitutional concerns, the statute as a whole should be construed through the prism of \nconstitutional avoidance.\" Rodriguez II, 715 F .3d at 1141; see also Rodriguez III, 804 F .3d \nat 1082.  Because§ 1225(b) applies to several categories ofLPRs who are entitled to due \nprocess protections, the court explained, prolonged detentions under that statute would \nraise constitutional concerns.  Rodriguez II,  715 F.3d at 1141.  Consequently, the court \nconstrued the statutory scheme to require a bond hearing after six months for all individuals \ndetained under § 1225(b).  !d. at 1144.  The Saleem court reached the same conclusion, \nstating that \"[n]ow that this Court has construed§ 1225(b) to avoid constitutional concerns \nfor  certain  LPRs  ... it  must  apply  that  construction  consistently  to  [the  petitioner] \n-27-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 28 of 68\nirrespective  of 'whether or not those  constitutional problems pertain to  the particular \nlitigant before the Court.\"'  2016 WL 4435246, at * 4 (quoting Clark, 543 U.S. at 381 \n(2005)); see Osias v.

June 15, 2017). \nRespondents argue that this court should not follow the lead of the overwhelming \nmajority of courts in this Circuit because those decisions were based on Rodriguez II and \nIII, which, Respondents contend, hinged on facts not relevant to this case.  (Dkt. 49 at 14 ). \n8  The decision in Osias was vacated on the grounds that the case was mooted by the \npetitioner's release on parole conditioned on payment of a bond.  2017 WL 3432685 at* 1. \n-28-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 29 of 68\nIn Rodriguez II and III, the petitioners alleged that some members of the class were LPRs, \nnot arriving aliens.  715  F.3d at  1142; 804 F.3d at  1083.  According to Respondents, \nbecause this case involves an entire proposed subclass of non-LPRs and only consists of \narriving aliens, Rodriguez II and III are inapplicable.  (Dkt. 49 at 15).9 \nRespondents misinterpret Rodriguez II and III as well as Clark, the case on which \nthe  Ninth  Circuit relied.  The  Ninth  Circuit  noted  that  the  class  included  LPRs  but \nultimately held that the constitutional avoidance doctrine applies \"where one possible \napplication of a statute raises constitutional concerns.\"  Rodriguez III, 804 F .3d at 1082 \n9  Respondents also cite 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(h)(2)(i)(B) in support of their argument \nthat bond hearings should not be applied in this context.  (Dkt. 27-1 at 24;  Dkt. 50 at 29). \nAlthough they do not elaborate on the argument in their motion to dismiss or opposition to \nthe  preliminary  injunction  motion,  in  opposition  to  the  class  certification  motion \nRespondents specifically contend that this regulation prohibits an immigration judge from \nreleasing an  arriving alien detained under  § 1225(b) on bond.  (Dkt.  55  at  14).  The \nregulation provides that \"an immigration judge may not redetermine conditions of custody \nimposed by the  Service with respect to  . . . [a ]rriving aliens  in removal proceedings, \nincluding aliens paroled after arrival pursuant to section 212( d)( 5) of the Act.\"  8 C.F .R. \n§ 1003.19(h)(2)(i)(B).  It  is  unclear  whether  the  text  of that  regulation  means,  as \nRespondents  argue,  that  an  immigration judge  cannot  provide  a  bond  hearing  for  a \n§ 1225(b) detainee who has been detained for more than six months.  As is the case here, \nindividuals subject to prolonged detention are unlikely to have been \"paroled after arrival.\" \nFurthermore, Respondents cite no case law to support their argument, and none of the many \ncourts in this Circuit that have required bond hearings under these circumstances have \naddressed that regulation. \nAdditionally,  none  of  the  courts  outside  this  Circuit  that  have  cited \n§ 1003.19(h)(2)(i)(B) for the proposition for which Respondents cite the regulation have \nengaged in a textual analysis of its meaning.  Moreover, those courts have concluded that \ndue process requires  a bond hearing once  detention becomes \"prolonged.\"  See,  e.g., \nRodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1143-44 (9th Cir. 2013); Salazar v. Rodriguez, 2017 \nWL 3718380 (D.N.J. Aug. 29, 2017) (holding that, despite the statutory limitation on bond \nhearings, an alien detained under§ 1225(b) is constitutionally entitled to a bond hearing \nonce the length of detention becomes \"unreasonable\"). \nAccordingly,  §  1003.19(h)(2)(i)(B) does  not  change the  Court's analysis  about \nPetitioners' right to a bond hearing once detained for six months. \n-29-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 30 of 68\n(emphasis added).  Thus, for the constitutional avoidance doctrine to apply, this Court need \nnot find that this particular class includes LPRs, but only that the statute applies to LPRs. \nThe majority of the courts in this Circuit that have considered the issue agree, and \nthis Court finds  their reasoning,  and the reasoning articulated in Rodriguez II and III, \npersuasive.  Section  1225(b)  does  not  permit  the  indefinite  detention  of individuals \ndetained under that statute. The courts in this Circuit that have reached the same conclusion \nhave required a bond hearing within six months,  and the Court agrees that this  is  an \n* \nappropriate length of time.  See,  e.g., Saleem,  2016  WL 4435246, at  5 (interpreting \n§ 1225(b) to include a reasonable temporal limitation of six months). \nThe  Court  acknowledges  that  the  issue  is  presently  before  the  United  States \nSupreme Court, and a ruling in Jennings v. Rodriguez, No. 15-1204 (U.S. argued Nov. 30, \n2016), could impact the appropriateness of this Court's ruling in this case.  However, the \nCourt cannot base its decision on predicting future rulings from higher courts; rather, it \nmust decide this case based on the current state of the law.  The Court concludes that, in \nthe Second Circuit, an individual detained pursuant to § 1225(b) is entitled to a Lora bond \nhearing once detained for more than six months.  Accordingly, Petitioners have stated a \nvalid habeas corpus claim. \nB.  Justiciability Issues: Mootness \nRespondents argue that Petitioners' individual and class claims have been rendered \nmoot by the release of Abdi and Barrios Ramos to parole supervision (on August 16, 20 17, \nand September 7, 2017, respectively), because that was the only relief sought by Petitioners \nin their habeas petition .. (Dkt. 27-l at 27-29; Dkt. 49 at 16).  Petitioners respond that \n-30-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 31 of 68\nvarious exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply, and neither their individual nor their \nclass claims are  moot.  (Dkt.  48  at  12-15).  The  Court concludes that the \"voluntary \ncessation\" exception to the mootness doctrine applies to Petitioners' individual claims, and \nas such, the putative class claims remain live controversies as well.  Moreover, even if the \nindividual  claims  were  mooted,  the  putative  class  claims  would  survive  under  the \ninherently transitory exception to the mootness doctrine. \n\"The mootness doctrine is rooted in the 'case or controversy' requirement of Article \nIII of the Constitution, which describes 'the principle that, at all times, the dispute before \nthe court must be real and live, not feigned, academic, or conjectural.\"'  Pats kin v.

City of Waukesha, 531 U.S. 278, 284 n.l (2001)). \nHere,  Respondents  argue that Petitioners'  individual  claims have  been mooted \nbecause both Abdi and Barrios Ramos have been released from detention, which was the \nsole remedy requested by Petitioners' habeas petition.  (Dkt. 27-1 at 27-29).  In response, \nPetitioners  contend that the  \"voluntary cessation\"  exception to  the  mootness  doctrine \napplies to this action because Respondents could revoke Abdi's and Barrios Ramos' parole \nand indefinitely detain Petitioners once again.  (See Dkt. 48 at 13 ).  Petitioners cite to the \nfollowing regulation: \n- 33-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 34 of 68\n[U]pon accomplishment of the purpose for which parole was authorized or \nwhen in the opinion of one of the officials listed in paragraph (a) of this \nsection,  neither  humanitarian  reasons  nor  public  benefit  warrants  the \ncontinued  presence  of the  alien  in  the  United  States,  parole  shall  be \nterminated upon written notice to the alien and he or she shall be restored to \nthe status that he or she had at the time of parole. \n8 C.F.R. § 212.5(e)(2)(i); see 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) (\"The Attorney General may ... \nin his discretion parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he may \nprescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public \nbenefit any alien applying for admission to the United States, ... and when the purposes \nof such parole shall, in the opinion of the Attorney General, have been served the alien \nshall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled.  . . .\"  \n(emphasis  added)).  Courts  have  interpreted  the  language  set  forth  in this  regulatory \nframework as providing the Attorney General with significant discretion to revoke parole. \nSee,  e.g.,  Samirah v.  O'Connell,  335  F.3d 545,  548  (7th Cir.  2003);  Centeno-Ortiz v. \nCulley, No. 11-CV-1970-IEG POR, 2012 WL 170123, at *3-4 (S.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2012); \nSillah v. Davis, 252 F. Supp. 2d 589, 597 (W.D. Tenn. 2003). \nHere, Petitioners were paroled after they filed this action.  Respondents have since \nrevoked Abdi's parole, but no explanation for this revocation appears in the record and he \nremains out of custody.  Indeed, the declaration of Thomas Brophy, Acting Director of the \nICE  Buffalo  Field  Office,  does  not  elaborate  upon  the  circumstances  underlying the \nrevocation.  (Dkt. 27-2 at~ 2 (\"[Abdi's] parole was revoked by the St. Paul, MN ERO Field \nOffice on August 23, 20 17 .  ICE, at this time, has no intention of taking Abdi back into \ncustody.\")). \n- 34-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 35 of 68\nRespondents state that they do not intend to re-detain Abdi \"at this time.\"  (!d.). \nNotably,  the  \"voluntary  cessation\"  exception  will  not  apply  if  Respondents  can \ndemonstrate that \"subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful \nbehavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\"  Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 189 (emphasis \nadded); see Picrin-Peron v. Rison, 930 F.2d 773, 776 (9th Cir. 1991) (finding the doctrine \nof voluntary cessation to be inapplicable where \"the government filed a declaration of the \ndirector of the Los Angeles District Office of the INS who reiterated under oath\" that the \npetitioner \"will be paroled for another year\" absent the occurrence of certain circumstances \noutside  the  government's  control);  Farez-Espinoza,  2009  WL  1118098,  at  *4 \n(\"[D]efendants have been found to satisfy their burden by, for example, submitting a sworn \naffidavit disavowing any intent to ever repeat the challenged conduct.\").  Although Acting \nDirector Brophy's declaration avers that Respondents do not intend tore-detain Abdi \"at \nthis time\" (Dkt. 27-2 at  2), this language leaves open the possibility that Respondents \n~ \ncould,  on a whim,  change course and decide to  re-detain Abdi.  Thus, the submitted \ndeclaration fails to carry Respondents' heavy burden of demonstrating that the challenged \nconduct will not reoccur.  See Farez-Espinoza, 2009 WL  1118098, at *4  (\"A general \ndisclaimer of intent to revive the allegedly unlawful conduct is  insufficient in itself to \novercome the defendant's heavy burden.\"); see also Mhany Mgmt., Inc., 819 F.3d at 604 \n(\"We  are  unpersuaded  that  the  County  has  committed  to  this  course permanently.\" \n(emphasis added)); Centeno-Ortiz, 2012 WL 170123, at *4-5 (distinguishingPircin-Peron \nbecause the government declaration reserved the ability to re-detain the petitioner at its \ndiscretion). \n- 35-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 36 of 68\nMoreover, Petitioners correctly assert that Respondents have substantial discretion \nto  revoke  their  parole.  At  oral  argument,  counsel  for  Respondents  confirmed  that \nRespondents believe they can re-detain Abdi or Barrios Ramos at a moment's notice for \nessentially any reason.  In Farez-Espinoza, the Southern District ofNew York concluded \nthat the voluntary cessation exception applied to the petitioner's habeas petition because \n\"under the Government's view, it has full statutory authority to revoke the bond andre \ndetain her.\"  2009 WL  1118098, at *7.  Indeed, \"the Government maintained that it was \n'unquestionably permitted to detain [Farez-Espinoza] in any instance.\"' !d.; see Rodriguez \nv. Hayes (\"Rodriguez!\"), 591 F.3d 1105, 1117-18 (9th Cir. 2010) (applying the voluntary \ncessation doctrine in holding that the petitioner's release to parole did not moot his habeas \npetition). \nTherefore,  because  Respondents  assume  the  position  that  they  may  revoke \nPetitioners' parole at any time, for any reason-as Petitioners suggest happened to Abdi \nPetitioners' individual claims must receive the benefit of the \"voluntary cessation\" doctrine \nbecause  the  re-detention  of Petitioners  falls  within  Respondents'  broad  discretionary \ncontrol. See Centeno-Ortiz, 2012 WL 170123, at *4-5; Farez-Espinoza, 2009 WL 1118098 \nat *7; cf Picrin-Peron, 930 F.2d at 776.  A contrary holding would permit Respondents to \n\"return to  [their]  old ways\" by subjecting Petitioners to a second round of prolonged \ndetention.  Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 189. \n2.  Inherently Transitory Exception to the Mootness Doctrine \nHere, because Petitioners' individual claims are not moot, Petitioners need not rely \non the  inherently transitory doctrine to save the viability of the putative class claims. \n- 36-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 37 of 68\nNonetheless,  for  purposes  of completeness  and  because  it  is  relevant  to  the  Court's \nconsideration of the preliminary injunction on a class-wide basis, the Court addresses the \napplicability of this doctrine and finds that, in the alternative, the claims are not moot under \nthe inherently transitory doctrine. \nThe  \"inherently transitory\" exception to  the mootness  doctrine  applies to  class \nactions  where  it  is  uncertain  whether the  court will  be  able  to  timely  rule  upon  the \ncertification of the class \"before the proposed representative's individual interest expires.\" \nComer v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 775, 799 (2d Cir. 1994) (quotation marks and citation omitted); \nReynolds v.  Lifewatch,  Inc.,  136 F.  Supp. 3d 503, 513  (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (same).  Thus, \nwhere the named class representative no longer can maintain a personal interest in the \nlitigation, the inherently transitory doctrine may still save the class action. \nThe Supreme Court has long recognized a \"narrow class of cases  in which the \ntermination of a class representative's claim does not moot the claims of the unnamed \nmembers of the class.\"  Gerstein v.  Pugh, 420 U.S.  103, 111  n.11  (1975).  This type of \nclaim  has  been  described  as  \"inherently  transitory.\"  See  County  of Riverside  v. \nMcLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 52 (1991) (\"We recognized in Gerstein that '[s]ome claims are \nso inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a \nmotion  for  class  certification  before  the  proposed  representative's  individual  interest \nexpires.\"' (quoting United States Parole Comm 'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388,399 (1980))). \nIt is well-established that \"[a] prisoner's length of stay at a particular prison or \nwithin a prison system is 'inherently transitory and cannot be determined from the outset.\"' \nClarkson, 783 F. Supp. at 799 (quoting Jane B. v. N.Y. C. Dep 't ofS oc. Servs., 117 F .R.D. \n- 37-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 38 of 68\n64,  68  (S.D.N.Y.  1987)).  Claims arising out of pretrial detentions,  or detentions  for \n\"sentences of one year or less\" are also \"inherently transitory,\" Butler v.  Suffolk County, \n289 F.R.D. 80, 91  (E.D.N.Y. 2013); see Gerstein, 420 U.S.  at  111  n.ll, as are claims \nasserted by persons waiting on federal housing lists, some for years at a time, Comer, 37 \nF.3d at 799. \nWhile  the  temporal  nature  of a  claim  may  suggest  whether  it  is  \"inherently \ntransitory\" or not, the application of this exception is by no means restricted to \"time \nlimited\" assertions.  Marisol A. v.  Giuliani, No. 95-CV-10533 (RJW), 1998 WL 265123, \nat *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 1998).  In fact, the Second Circuit, in applying the exception to \n\"housing discrimination suits,\" has stated that such actions \"are acutely susceptible to \nmootness because ofthefluid composition ofthe public housing population.\"  Comer, 37 \nF.3d at 797 (emphasis added); see Marisol A., 1998 WL 265123, at *6 (finding that \"the \npopulation ofNew York City's child welfare system is equally fluid, ... [as c]hildren enter \nand leave the system all the time\"); see also Zurakv.

[b ]ecause of \nthe relatively short periods of incarceration involved and the possibility of conditional \nrelease\").  Several out-of-circuit district courts have also held that claims arising out of \nimmigration detentions are \"inherently transitory.\" See, e.g., Rivera v. Holder, 307 F.R.D. \n539, 548 (W.D. Wash. 2015); R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 183 (D.D.C. 2015); \nLyon  v.  US.  Immigration  &  Customs  Enf't,  300  F.R.D.  628,  639  (N.D.

Napolitano, No. 11-CV-5452, 2012 \nWL 5995820, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 30, 2012). \nThe principles underlying these cases carry equal force in the instant matter.  The \nprovisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1225 mandate the detention of an arriving alien who successfully \ndemonstrates  a  credible  fear  of  persecution  in  his  or  her  homeland.  See  id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii). \"The mandatory nature of this detention is tempered by statute as a \nmatter of executive grace through the Attorney General's wholly  discretionary parole \nauthority under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) to release an alien temporarily on parole ....\"  \nAhad v.  Lowe, 235 F. Supp. 3d 676, 686 (M.D. Pa. 2017).  As such, the duration of the \nputative  class  members'  detention  is  not clear from  the outset,  and there  is  a strong \npossibility that they could be released prior to class certification.  See Gerstein, 420 U.S. \nat Ill n.ll (\"The length of pretrial custody cannot be ascertained at the outset, and it may \nbe ended at any time by release on recognizance ....\" ); Zurak, 550 F.2d at 92 (noting the \n\"possibility of conditional release\" in applying the inherently transitory claims exception); \nLyon, 300 F.R.D. at 639 (\"As in Gerstein, the length of detention cannot be ascertained at \nthe outset and may be ended before class certification by various circumstances.\"); see also \nOlson v.  Brown, 594 F.3d 577, 583 (7th Cir. 2010) (applying the exception where \"[t]he \nduration  of [the  plaintiffs]  claim was  at the  discretion  of the Indiana Department of \nCorrection\" since \"[a]n individual incarcerated in  a county jail may be released for  a \nnumber of reasons that he cannot anticipate\"); Moreno, 2012 WL 5995820, at *7 (\"[T]he \nduration of the 1-247 detainers could not be determined at the outset; they were subject to \nthe discretion ofiCE officials and beyond [the p]laintiffs' control. ...

(See Dkt. 17 \nat 6-8, 12-15; Dkt. 27-1 at 27 -28). Respondents' actions \"illustrate the inherently transitory \nnature of [Petitioners']  claims.\"  Moreno,  2012  WL  5995820, at *7  n.4;  see  White  v. \nMathews,  559 F.2d 852, 857 (2d Cir.  1977) (\"Refusing to [apply the exception] would \nmean  that  the  [Social  Security  Administration]  could  avoid  judicial  scrutiny  of its \nprocedures by the simple expedient of granting hearings to plaintiffs who seek, but have \nnot yet obtained, class certification. We do not suggest that this occurred here, but we must \ntake notice of the 'reality' of that possibility in the future.\"); see also Goetz v.  Crosson, \n728  F.  Supp.  995,  1004 (S.D.N.Y.  1990) (\"[T]he possibility that the defendants could \nintentionally moot the named plaintiffs' claims sufficiently justifies class certification.\"). \nIn addition, as members of the putative class are released to parole, more asylum \nseekers will undoubtedly arrive at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility and successfully \ndemonstrate  the  existence  of a  credible  fear  of persecution.  Indeed,  the  monthly \nfluctuations in detainee population and the influx of new asylum-seekers provides good \nreason for the Court to \"safely assume\" that the composition of the putative class and \nsubclass will remain fluid.  (See Dkt. 19-3 at 2, 8; Dkt. 19-5); see, e.g., Gerstein, 420 U.S. \nat 111 n.ll; Comer, 37 F.3d at 797. \n-40-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 41 of 68\nAs a result, even if the individual claims were moot (which, as noted above, they \nare not under the voluntary cessation doctrine), Petitioners' putative class action claims \nwould continue to present a justiciable controversy pursuant to the inherently transitory \ndoctrine. \nII.  Petitioners' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \nPetitioners seek a preliminary injunction ordering Respondents \"to adjudicate or, \nwhere  appropriate,  readjudicate  parole  applications  for  all  putative  class  members  in \nconformance with their legal obligations, including by adhering to all the requirements of \nthe ICE Directive.\"  (Dkt. 38 at 1).  Additionally, Petitioners seek preliminary injunctive \nrelief requiring all \"putative class members at Batavia who have been detained for six \nmonths  or more\" to be provided individualized bond hearings at which \"immigration \njudges  shall  order  release  on  bond  unless  'the  government  establishes  by  clear  and \nconvincing evidence that the immigrant poses a risk of flight or a risk of danger to the \ncommunity.\"'  (!d.

See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Where the moving party is unable to demonstrate a likelihood \nof success on the merits, a court may still issue a preliminary injunction if the moving party \ndemonstrates '\"sufficiently serious questions  going to the merits  to  make them a  fair \nground  for  litigation  and  a  balance  of hardships  tipping  decidedly  toward  the  party \n- 41 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 42 of 68\nrequesting  the  preliminary  relief.\"'  Citigroup  Glob.

Saban Entm 't,  Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 34 (2d Cir. \n1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nHere, Petitioners have satisfied the standard for preliminary injunctive relief on \nbehalf of themselves and the putative class members.  Petitioners have plainly established \non  behalf of themselves  and  the  putative  class  irreparable  harm  absent  preliminary \ninjunctive relief,  and they have also established a likelihood of success on the merits. \n-42-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 43 of 68\nthe grant of preliminary injunctive relief will alter the status of the parties in that \nAlthough~ \nPetitioners will be afforded certain procedural protections that they  are not otherwise \nreceiving, the relief is nonetheless warranted because, to act otherwise would mean that \nthese individuals would be detained without any appropriate process, resulting in extreme \nor very serious irreparable damage.  As a result, for the reasons discussed further below, \nPetitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 38) is granted. \nA.  Granting Relief to Putative Class Prior to Class Certification \nA threshold issue that the Court must address is whether it is appropriate to grant \npreliminary injunctive relief to the putative class members prior to class certification.  On \nAugust 25, 2017, before applying for a preliminary injunction, Petitioners moved to certify \nthe class, seeking certification of the following class and subclass: \nClass:  All arriving asylum-seekers who have passed a credible fear interview \nand who are or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility and \nwho have not been granted parole. \nSubclass:  All  arriving  asylum-seekers  who  are  detained  at  the  Buffalo \nFederal Detention Facility, have passed a credible fear interview, and have \nbeen or will be detained for more than six months without a bond hearing \nbefore an immigration judge. \n(Dkt.  19 at  1) .  The Court issued a briefing schedule concerning the class certification \nmotion (Dkt. 20), but instead of filing responding papers by the deadline set by the Court, \nRespondents filed a motion to stay the class certification motion pending resolution of \nRespondents' subsequently-filed motion to dismiss (Dkt. 33).  The Court issued a briefing \nschedule concerning the motion to stay, and held the schedule for briefing on the class \ncertification motion in abeyance until further order of the Court.  (Dkt. 35).  In response, \n-43-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 44 of 68\nPetitioners opposed the motion to stay, but alternatively did not oppose a stay to the extent \nthat the Court did not consider it necessary to wait for class certification before entering \nclass-wide relief.  (Dkt. 42).  Petitioners argued that the absence of a final ruling on the \nclass certification motion would not preclude class-wide relief at the preliminary injunction \nstage.  (!d. at 3-4).  After the oral argument on October 27, 2017, this Court issued a Text \nOrder denying the  motion to  stay the class  certification motion and setting a briefing \nschedule for the class certification motion.  (Dkt. 52).  As of the writing of this Decision \nand Order, Respondents have submitted their papers in opposition to the class certification \nmotion (Dkt. 55), but the motion has not been decided. \nUnder appropriate circumstances, a court may grant preliminary injunctive relief in \nfavor of putative class members before class certification, and correspondingly, assess the \nharm to putative class members when considering the preliminary injunction motion.  See \nLigon v. City ofN  ew York, 925 F. Supp. 2d 478, 539 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (issuing preliminary \ninjunctive reliefbefore class certification without any prior finding of liability); Strouchler \nv. Shah, 891 F. Supp. 2d 504, 518-19 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (finding that class certification was \nlikely  and  considering  facts  relating  to  putative  class  members  when  adjudicating \npreliminary injunction motion); Dodge v.

Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions§ 4:30 (5th ed. 2017) (\"[A] court may \nissue a preliminary injunction in class suits prior to a ruling on the merits.\"). \nIn LaForest v.  Former Clean Air Holding Co., 376 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2004), the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of preliminary injunctive relief in favor \n-44-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 45 of 68\nof the putative class, which the district court granted in reliance on affidavits from unnamed \nplaintiffs.  !d. at 57.  Respondents argue that LaForest is not applicable here because, in \nthat case, the district court issued a preliminary injunction only after it had found for the \nplaintiffs on the issue of liability.  (Dkt. 50 at 32).  Although the Second Circuit considered \nthe procedural posture in LaForest \"relevant,\" it did not hold that the prior finding of \nliability was determinative with respect to whether the district court properly permitted the \nplaintiffs \"to adduce evidence of harm representatively.\" 376 F.3d at 57-58.  The Second \nCircuit stated that plaintiffs \"should\" be permitted to do so as \"long as they lay a foundation \nthat the representative plaintiffs are similarly situated with regard to the issue of irreparable \nharm.\"  !d.  at 58.  Respondents do not cite any authority that confines LaForest to the \nnarrow application posited in their memorandum of law,  and Respondents'  attempt to \ndistinguish LaForest is unpersuasive. \nLaForest recognized a divergence of opinion among courts that have considered \nwhether an appropriate foundation was laid for reliance on alleged irreparable harm to \nputative class members.  !d. (citing Adams v. Freedom Forge Corp., 204 F.3d 475 (3d Cir. \n2000), and United Steelworkers v.  Textron, Inc., 836 F.2d 6 (1st Cir. 1987)).  The Second \nCircuit  left  open  the  issue  concerning  the  governing  approach,  but  indicated  that \n\"[d  ]etermining whether plaintiffs have laid such a foundation is a case-sensitive inquiry \nsubject to review for abuse of discretion.\"  !d.; cf Gardner v.  CAN Fin.  Corp., 3:13 CV \n1918  (JBA),  2016  WL  96141,  at  *8  (D.  Conn.  Jan.  8,  2016)  (discussing  different \napproaches  among  courts  in  determining  evidentiary  proof required  to  demonstrate \nirreparable harm among putative class members, and concluding \"this is not an appropriate \n-45-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 46 of 68\nsituation in which to issue a broad preliminary injunction prior to the class being certified \nbecause plaintiffs have failed to provide adequate evidence that the putative class members \nare suffering from the irreparable harm that plaintiffs are alleging\"). \nIn this case, after considering the motion for class certification and Respondents' \nopposition, and while recognizing that the motion remains undecided, the Court finds that \nclass certification is likely based upon a consideration of factors set forth in Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 23.  Furthermore, the Court concludes that the irreparable harm alleged \nby the putative class members should be considered when assessing Petitioners' request \nfor a preliminary injunction because the motion papers establish that the asylum-seekers \nwho have been held in Batavia are similarly situated. \nSpecifically, this Court finds that Petitioners are likely to satisfy the Rule 23(a) \nprerequisites for class certification:  \"numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nof representation.\"  Sykes v.  Mel S.  Harris &  Assocs., 780 F .3d 70, 80 (2d Cir. 20 15). \nPetitioners proposed class is sufficiently numerous, and Respondents have not disputed \nthat point.  (Dkt.  55  at  15  n.2).  While Respondents  challenge the  commonality and \ntypicality requirements, they largely base their opposition on their merits-based challenges \nto the underlying claims (id. at 18-24), which have been rejected by this Court, as discussed \nabove.  Respondents also contend that Petitioners' claims require individualized factual \ndeterminations and Petitioners cannot establish that common facts apply to each purported \nclass member.  (!d. at 21-22).  That argument misconstrues the relief sought by Petitioners, \nwhich is not an individualized determination as to whether to grant parole or bond, but \nrather  a request that  certain procedural  protections  be  applied  across-the-board when \n-46-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 47 of 68\nmaking those individualized determinations.  See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 U.S. \n338, 349-50 (2011) (commonality is satisfied where even a single issue of law or fact is \ncommon  to  the  class,  and  where  a  classwide  proceeding  is  capable  of \"generat[ing] \ncommon  answers  apt  to  drive  the  resolution  of the  litigation.\");  Johnson  v.  Nextel \nCommc'ns Inc.,  780 F.3d 128,  137 (2d Cir.  2015) (\"The claims for relief need not be \nidentical for them to be common; rather, Rule 23(a)(2) simply requires that there be issues \nwhose resolution will affect all or a significant number of the putative class members.\"); \nRobidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931,936-37 (2d Cir. 1993) (\"When it is alleged that the same \nunlawful conduct was directed at or affected both the named plaintiff and the class sought \nto be represented, the typicality requirement is usually met irrespective of minor variations \nin the  fact  patterns underlying  individual claims.\");  V. W  by and through  Williams  v. \nConway,  236  F.  Supp.  3d 554,  576  (N.D.N.Y.  2017) (typicality requirement satisfied \nbecause the claims of the class representatives and the members of the class and subclass \nwere \"based on the common application of certain challenged policies.\" (citing Sykes, 285 \nF.R.D. at 287)). \nWith respect to the adequacy of the class representative, Petitioners propose only \nBarrios Ramos as class representative.  (Dkt. 19-1 at 17 n. 7).  \"Adequacy is twofold: the \nproposed class representative must have an interest in vigorously pursuing the claims of \nthe class, and must have no interests antagonistic to the interests of other class members.\" \nDenney v. Deutsche BankAG, 443 F.3d 253,268 (2d Cir. 2006).  Respondents argue that \nBarrios Ramos is not an adequate representative because he has been released to parole \nand his asylum proceeding has been transferred to another district.  (See Dkt. 55 at 16-18). \n-47-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 48 of 68\nAccording to Respondents, Barrios Ramos will be unable to vigorously pursue the class \nclaims because his claims have been mooted and he is no longer a part of the class he seeks \nto represent.  (!d. at 18).  As discussed above, Barrios Ramos' individual claims fall within \nthe voluntary cessation exception to the mootness doctrine. However, even if his individual \nclaims were moot, this would not adversely affect the class action claims or Barrios Ramos' \ncapacity to continue litigating the class claims on behalf of the putative class and subclass \nbecause the inherently transitory doctrine applies, as also discussed above. \nThe individual and class claims are readily susceptible to exceptions to the mootness \ndoctrine, which only further buttresses the justification for class certification.  See Wagafe \nv. Trump, No. 17-CV-0094 (RAJ), 2017 WL 2671254, at* 15 (W.D. Wash. June 21, 2017) \n(\"[The d]efendants'  argument that the mooting of named [p]laintiffs'  claims requires a \nfinding that they are inadequate representatives, thus defeating class certification, does not \nhave the desired effect.  In fact, it counsels in favor of granting class certification.\"); Goetz, \n728 F. Supp. at 1004. \nFurthermore, the principles underlying the inherently transitory exception suggest \nthat substitution of a new class representative is not required, even when the individual \nclaims are moot.  See  White,  559 F.2d at 857-58 (permitting the class representative to \ncontinue litigating the class claims even after his individual claims were rendered moot); \nIn re  Thornburgh, 869 F.2d 1503,  1509 n.7 (D.C. Cir.  1989) (recognizing that \"[s]ome \ncourts ... have permitted the original named plaintiffs to represent the class even after their \nown claims were mooted prior to certification,\" but suggesting \"that such treatment is \nproper only in special circumstances, such as where the alleged law violation is capable of \n-48-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 49 of 68\nrepetition, yet evading review\").  The core rationale of the inherently transitory exception \nis that the viability of the class action should not be tied to the viability of individual claims \nthat may be rendered moot prior to class certification due to their inherent fluidity.  Indeed, \nif Petitioners are required to name new representatives every time an individually-named \nparty is released from custody, there is nothing stopping Respondents from attempting to \nmoot this case by targeting each class representative for parole.  See White, 559 F .2d at \n857; Goetz, 728 F. Supp. at 1004. \nTherefore, even if Barrios Ramos' individual claims are extinguished, he' may still \nbe eligible to carry the mantle of class representative for the time being.  See Monaco v. \nStone, 187 F.R.D. 50, 60 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (applying the \"inherently transitory\" exception \nand stating that \"plaintiff Gregory Monaco may still act as the named representative for the \nproposed plaintiff class despite the  loss  of his  individual claims[,  because a]  named \nplaintiff may still litigate a class action despite the loss of their personal stake if the claims \nare 'capable of repetition, yet evading review.\"' (quoting Geraghty, 445 U.S. at 398)); cf \nSwan v.  Stoneman, 635 F.2d 97, 102 n.6 (2d Cir. 1980) (rejecting the argument that \"the \nabsence of any intervenor or substitute named plaintiff' would not moot the class claim \nbecause, among other things, Geraghty did not apply).  Respondents rely on two cases \nwhere the courts found inadequate representation once the named representative was no \nlonger part of the class he sought to represent.  Norman v.  Conn. State Bd. ofP  arole, 458 \nF.2d 497, 499 (2d Cir. 1972); Kenavan v. Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield, No. 91-CV-\n2393 (KMW), 1996 WL 14446, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 1996), aff'd sub nom.

However, these cases are \ninapposite as they do not apply either of the exceptions to mootness discussed here. \nOf course, when the Court issues a decision on the motion to certify it \"must assure \nitself that the named representative will adequately protect the interests of the class.\" Sosna \nv. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393,403 (1975); Basel v. Knebel, 551 F.2d 395, 397 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1977) \n(\"Whether  or  not  the  challenged  regulations  raise  a  live  controversy  with  regard  to \nappellant's individual claim, it is clear that a live controversy exists with regard to class \nmembers who are currently being denied prior hearings as a result of the regulations.  Of \ncourse, in order for appellant to serve as the class representative, the district court must \nassure  itself that  [she]  will  adequately  represent the  interests  of the  class.\"  (internal \nquotation  marks  omitted)).  Accordingly,  Petitioners  may  be  required to  substitute  a \nmember of the putative class as the class representative if the Court determines that Barrios \nRamos' representation \"will [not] fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \nHowever,  at  this  stage  of the  proceedings,  the  Court  concludes  that  class \ncertification is likely and, as a result, Petitioners should be permitted to adduce evidence \nof harm representatively.10  For the  reasons  set forth  below,  the  Court finds  that the \n10  In addition to likely meeting the requirements of Rule 23(a), the Court concludes \nthat Petitioners will also likely be able to demonstrate that Respondents have \"acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\"  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b)(2).  \"The key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature ofthe injunctive or \ndeclaratory remedy warranted-the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined \nor declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.\"  Wal-Mart \nStores,  Inc.  v.

Tray-Wrap, Inc., 917 F.2d 75, 79 (2d Cir. \n1990)). \n1.  Sworn Declarations Submitted by Petitioners \nBased on the record before the Court, Petitioners have established irreparable harm \nthrough the negative physical and mental health effects of prolonged detention and the fact \nthat their  continued  detention  has  prevented putative  class  members  from  adequately \npreparing for  their asylum hearings before an immigration judge.  In support of their \nmotion,  Petitioners  have  attached  numerous  declarations  detailing  the  ways  that \nRespondents  have  violated  the  ICE  Directive  and  the  harm  caused  by  the  ongoing \nviolations.  Many of these putative class members affirm that they have been detained at \nthe Buffalo Federal Detention Facility for months at a time.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 38-4 at 3 (since \nFebruary 2017); Dkt. 38-5 at 4 (since October 2016); Dkt. 38-6 at 2 (since January 2017); \nDkt. 38-7 at 2 (since February 2017); Dkt. 38-8 at 2 (since May 2017); Dkt. 38-9 at 3 (since \nDecember 2016, and did not receive a credible fear interview until two months later); Dkt. \n38-10 at 2 (since December 2016); Dkt. 38-11 at 2 (since January 2017); Dkt. 38-12 at 2 \n(since January 2017); Dkt. 38-13 at 2 (since October 2016); Dkt. 38-14 at 2 (since January \n2017); Dkt. 38-15 at 2 (since January 2017); Dkt. 38-16 (from February 2017 to September \n2017 when he was released)).  The \"average length of detention\" for the detainees who \nallegedly form the putative subclass is 387 days, with the longest-recorded detention being \n1,057 days.  (Dkt. 51-1 at 2; see id. at 11 (since January 20 17), 19 (since November 20 16), \n29 (since December 2016), 35 (since October 2016), 46 (since January 2017), 51  (since \nOctober 2016), 59 (since September 2016), 86 (since December 2016)).  Having already \n-52-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 53 of 68\ndetermined that § 1225(b) contains an implicit time restriction requiring Respondents to \nhold a bond hearing for detained asylum-seekers after six months of confinement, the Court \nfurther concludes that the continued detention of these individuals for such prolonged \ndurations directly contravenes this implied statutory right and constitutes irreparable harm. \nThe putative class members allege that they have been denied multiple requests for \nparole via perfunctory form denials, despite the fact that several declarants allege that they \nprovided ICE with sufficient documentation.  (Dkt. 38-4 at 3-4; Dkt. 38-5 at 5-6; Dkt. 38-\n6 at 3; Dkt. 38-7 at 3; Dkt. 38-8 at 3; Dkt. 38-9 at 3-4; Dkt. 38-10 at 3; Dkt 38-11 at 3; Dkt. \n38-13 at 3; Dkt. 38-15 at 3; Dkt. 38-16 at 3; see also Dkt. 51-1 at 11-17,20,24,27,29-30, \n33, 35-36, 51-52, 70-71).  Furthermore, many declarants also aver that those form denials \ndid  not adequately explain the deficiencies  in their applications or what documentary \nmaterials would be sufficient.  (See Dkt. 51-1 at 12, 20, 30, 52, 60, 71).  The ICE Directive \nrequires Respondents to provide \"a brief explanation of the reasons for any decision to \ndeny parole.\"  ICE Directive No. 11002.1, ~ 6.5.  The Directive also requires that the letter \nnotification inform the  individual that \"he or she may request redetermination of this \ndecision based upon changed circumstances or additional evidence relevant to the alien's \nidentity, security risk, or risk of absconding.\"  !d.  \"[A]bsent reasonable justification for \ndelay,\" written decisions are to be provided to the alien within seven days of the parole \ninterview or the requested redetermination decision.  ICE Directive No. 11002.1, ~ 6.6. \nThe  Court  has  reviewed  numerous  two-sentence  form  denials  issued  by \nRespondents that were submitted as part ofPetitioners' papers. These letters do not provide \na meaningful \"explanation\" setting forth \"the reasons for denying parole.\"  ICE Directive \n-53-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 54 of 68\nNo. 11002.1, ,-r 6.5.  Since each individual's application is analyzed \"on its own merits and \nbased on the facts  of the individual alien's case,\" id. ,-r  6.2, blanket denials that forgo \nexplaining the specific deficiencies in an individual's application is a derogation of the \nrequirements of the ICE Directive. \nIndeed, many of Petitioners' declarants allege that they were never provided with \nany paperwork explaining how to seek parole, and a number of those who were provided \npaperwork were not English speakers and did not receive the documents in their native \nlanguages.  (Dkt. 38-6 at 3; Dkt. 38-7 at 2-3; Dkt. 38-8 at 2; Dkt. 38-9 at 3-4; Dkt. 39-10 \nat 2; Dkt. 38-12 at 2; Dkt. 38-15 at 3; see also Dkt. 51-1 at 11, 19, 46, 59).  Pursuant to the \nICE Directive, ICE \"shall provide\" an arriving alien with a \"Parole Advisal and Scheduling \nNotification\" \"[a]s soon as  practicable following  a credible  fear  determination.\"  ICE \nDirective No. 11002.1, ,-r 6.1.  That form is intended to inform the alien that he or she \"will \nbe interviewed for potential parole ... and notifies the alien of the date of the scheduled \ninterview and the deadline for submitting any documentary material supporting his or her \neligibility for parole.\" !d.  Furthermore, the notification \"shall be explained to such aliens \nin a language they understand.\" !d. \nIn  addition,  several  declarants  further  aver  that  their  prolonged  detention \nsubstantially burdened their ability to adequately prepare for an asylum hearing before an \nimmigration judge.  (See Dkt. 38-6 at 3; Dkt. 38-7 at 3; Dkt. 38-10 at 3; Dkt. 38-12 at 3; \nDkt.  51-1  at  12,  30, 60).  Detention under § 1225(b) is  intended only as  a temporary \nmeasure pending further review of the detainee's asylum application by an immigration \njudge.  See  8 U.S.C.  §  1225(b )(i)(B)(ii)  (\"[T]he  alien  shall  be  detained  for  further \n-54-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 55 of 68\nconsideration of the application for asylum.\").  The prolonged nature of these detentions \nhas limited the detainees' capacity to contact friends and family in their native countries. \nThe restrictions have hampered the detainees' preparation for upcoming asylum hearings, \nwhich undermines the very purpose of providing asylum-seekers a hearing.  See Celestin, \n17 Civ. 2419, slip. op. at 5-6 (bench decision finding that administrative exhaustion was \nnot required where the alien detainee was likely to suffer irreparable harm because \"he \n[was]  deprived of his  liberty and specifically s[ought]  relief from  detention so that he \nc[ ould]  gather evidence  for  his  asylum  hearing,\"  and  noting that  the  communication \nchallenges he faced while detained made it difficult to prepare for the hearing). \nMany  putative  class  members  also  allege  various  physical  and  psychological \nimpairments that have resulted from or worsened due to their prolonged confinement.  (See \nDkt. 38-4 at 4 (\"I have been diagnosed with PTSD.\"); Dkt. 38-5 at 6 (noting \"anxiety and \ndepression\" and \"trouble breathing\"); Dkt. 38-11 at 2-3 (noting several hospitalizations for \nsignificant ear pain, and \"no hearing in [his] right ear and a lot of pain in [hi]s left ear, \nbecause the eardrum is perforated and infected\"); Dkt.  38-12 at 3 (noting asthma and \n\"breathing problems and so much pain in [his] knees that [he] cannot stand,\" as well as \n\"very bad headaches that make [him] dizzy and give [him] nose bleeds\"); Dkt. 38-15 at 3 \n(noting a \"hernia\" and that he has \"collapsed from  abdominal pain\"); Dkt.  51-1  at  12 \n(noting a \"fractured bone in [his] hand\" and that he is suffering from a \"serious\" condition \nof \"thrombosis\")).  The allegations by Petitioners and members of the putative class of \ndiminished physical and mental health conditions constitute significant burdens upon the \ndetainees'  well-being.  See Hernandez v.  Sessions,  872  F.3d 976,  995  (9th Cir. 2017) \n-55 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 56 of 68\n(recognizing that immigration detention provides only \"subpar medical and psychiatric \ncare\" and yields \"economic burdens [that are] imposed on detainees and their families[, \nand] ... collateral harms to children of detainees whose parents are detained\"); see also \nJolly v.  Coughlin,  76  F.3d 468, 482 (2d Cir.  1996) (finding that the plaintiff's \"sworn \nstatement that he suffers from headaches, hair loss, rashes, and an inability to walk without \ndifficulty\" indicated that he \"has suffered physical effects of his confinement\" and this \n\"serve[ d] as an independent basis\" to establish the likelihood of irreparable harm). \nLastly, it is worth noting that Petitioners do not seek monetary judgments; rather, \nthey ask to receive the full and fair process afforded to them under the law-procedural \nrights unduly denied them as detainees of the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility. See Jarpa \nv. Mumford, 211 F. Supp. 3d 706, 711 (D. Md. 20 16) (\"[B]ecause the harm is loss ofliberty, \nit is quintessentially the kind of harm that cannot be undone or totally remedied through \nmonetary relief.\"); R.I.L-R v.  Johnson, 80 F.  Supp. 3d 164, 191  (D.D.C. 2015) (finding \nirreparable harm because the \"injuries at stake ... are 'beyond remediation,\"' and noting \nthat \"[ u] nlike economic harm, the harm from detention pursuant to an unlawful policy \ncannot be remediated after the fact\"). \n2.  Respondents' Declarations Do Not Create Meaningful Issues of \nFact \nRespondents have submitted several declarations from ICE officials that contradict \nvarious  allegations  in  Petitioners'  declarations.  Deportation  Officers  Ensminger, \nMcCartan, and Muehlig deny discouraging any detainee from seeking parole or stating that \nparole was no longer available.  (Dkt. 50-3 at 2-7; Dkt 50-4 at 2; Dkt. 50-5 at 2).  Officer \n-56-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 57 of 68\nEnsminger  also  contradicts  the  declaration  of Attorney  Desiree  Lurf.  Attorney  Lurf \nalleges, in her declaration, that Officer Ensminger informed her that the parole adjudication \npractices  at  the  Buffalo  Federal  Detention  Facility  had  changed  under  the  new \nadministration.  (Dkt. 38-19).  Officer Ensminger states that he never informed Attorney \nLurfthat parole practices had changed.  (Dkt. 50-3 at 7).  Similarly, Officer Ball states that \nhe does \"not believe that [he] told [immigration attorney Siana McClean] the parole policy \nhad changed.\"  (Dkt. 50-1 at 1-2; see Dkt. 38-18 at 3 (stating that Officer Ball \"informed \n[her] that parole adjudication practices have changed under the new administration\")). \nThe officers also state that they provided Petitioners' declarants with information \nabout how to apply for parole (Dkt. 50-3 at 2; Dkt. 50-4 at 2; Dkt. 50-5 at 1) and forwarded \nparole requests on behalf of those individuals (Dkt 50-3 at 2; Dkt. 50-5 at 2).  They contend \nthat  the  Buffalo  Federal  Detention  Facility  has  simply  begun  to  scrutinize  parole \ndocumentation more closely. (Dkt. 50-1 at 1 (indicating that he informed Attorney McLean \n\"that we are now more closely scrutinizing the validity of ... documents that are provided \nfor consideration in the parole decision ... based on a general consensus ... about the \nparole  process,  our  interpretation  of Thomas  Brophy's  remarks  regarding  identity \ndocuments, as well as the changes in the general enforcement objectives under the Trump \nAdministration\"); Dkt. 50-3 at 7 (indicating that he informed Attorney Desiree Lurf \"that \nthe requirements  for parole are being scrutinized more thoroughly than in the past, as \ndirected by the new acting Field Office Director\"); Dkt. 50-5 at 2-3 (indicating that he \ninformed a detainee that \"it was possible with the new administration that the requirements \nfor release on parole have tightened up\")). \n-57-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 58 of 68\nAlthough  Respondents'  declarations  specifically  contradict some  of the  factual \nallegations in the declarations submitted by Petitioners, Respondents never represent that \nthey are adhering to the requirements of the ICE Directive.  Indeed, Respondents' position \nis that the ICE Directive is not legally binding.  Nor do Respondents' declarants contradict \nPetitioners'  allegations  regarding  the  diminishing  mental  and  physical  health  of the \nputative class members, or the negative impact that detention has on the ability to prepare \nfor asylum proceedings. \nActing Field Office Director Thomas Brophy asserts that parole practices did not \nchange once President Trump came into office.  (Dkt. 50-2 at 1) .  However, he does not \nstate that the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility was following the ICE Directive before \nJanuary 2017, or that it is following the Directive today.  Director  also affirms that \nBrop~y \nhe uses \"standard language in letters to attorneys when denying parole\" and a \"Notification \nDeclining to Grant Parole\" to notify detainees.  (!d.  at 1-2).  Even so, Petitioners have \nprovided photocopies of parole denial letters given to Petitioners and the members of the \nputative class, and many of those letters indisputably fail to conform to the requirements \nof paragraph 6.5 of the ICE Directive.  That paragraph provides that officers \"shall provide \nevery  alien  subject  to  this  directive  with  written  notification  of the  parole  decision, \nincluding a brief explanation of the reasons for any decision to deny parole.\"  Many of \nPetitioners' declarants received letters notifying them that their parole request had been \ndenied without explanation.  (See, e.g., Dkt. 38-6 at 6; Dkt. 38-7 at 7; Dkt. 38-9 at 7; Dkt. \n38-10 at 6; Dkt. 38-11 at 7; Dkt. 38-13 at 7; Dkt. 38-15 at 7; Dkt. 38-20 at 11). \n-58-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 59 of 68\nDirector Brophy's declaration also states that the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility \nhas eliminated its practice of accepting photocopies of government-issued identification, \ncontending that the heightened scrutiny falls within the \"spirit\" of the ICE Directive.  (!d. \nat 2-3).  However, the ICE Directive plainly allows for alternatives to government-issued \nidentification for  individuals who \"cannot reasonably provide valid government-issued \nevidence  of identity\"  and  contains  no  language  requiring  original  documents.  ICE \nDirective No. 11002.1, ~ 8.3(1). \nAccordingly, Respondents' declarations do not create issues of fact concerning the \nfailure  to  adhere  to  the  requirements  of the  ICE  Directive,  the  impairment  that  the \nprolonged detention of the putative class members has had on their ability to prepare for \ntheir asylum proceedings, and the impact of detention on the putative class members' \nphysical and mental health. Moreover, there is no dispute that individualized bond hearings \nare not afforded to asylum-seekers after six months of detention, as Respondents contend \nthey are not required for§ 1225(b) detentions. \n3.  Petitioners Have Established Irreparable Harm \nThe  uncontested  factual  allegations  demonstrate  that,  absent  a  preliminary \ninjunction, Petitioners and the putative class members \"will suffer an injury that is neither \nremote nor speculative, but actual and imminent, and one that cannot be remedied if a court \nwaits until the end of trial to resolve the harm.\"  Grand River Enter. Six Nations, Ltd., 481 \nF.3d at 66.  Those submitting declarations in support ofthe preliminary injunction motion \nface harms that are representative of prospective class members generally.  Those harms \ninclude the negative physical and mental health effects of prolonged detention and the fact \n-59-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 60 of 68\nthat their continued  detention  has  prevented putative  class  members  from  adequately \npreparing for their asylum hearings before an immigration judge. \nOf  course,  mandatory  detention  provisions  in  the  immigration  context  are \nconstitutionally permissible, see Demore v.  Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 531  (2003), but that fact \ndoes nothing to diminish the crux of Petitioners' claims of an unlawfully \"prolonged\" and \nallegedly indefinite detention.  See Lora, 804 F.3d at 616 (holding that§ 1226(c) contains \nan implicit time restriction to avoid \"serious constitutional concerns\" attendant to an alien's \nindefinite detention); Nadarajah v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 1069, 1076 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding \nthat§ 1225(b)(l)(B)(ii) and (b)(2)(A) do not permit indefinite detention); see also Demore, \n538 U.S. at 532-33 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\"Were there to be an unreasonable delay by \nthe INS in pursuing and completing deportation proceedings, it could become necessary \nthen to inquire whether the detention is not to facilitate deportation, or to protect against \nrisk of flight or dangerousness, but to incarcerate for other reasons.\"). \nIndeed,  Petitioners  do  not  argue  that  they  cannot  be  detained  at  all;  rather, \nPetitioners take issue with the manner in which they have been detained-indefinitely and \nwithout  fair  process.  Petitioners'  request,  ultimately,  asks  this  Court  to  require \nRespondents to  adhere to their policies and procedures.  That remedy would cure the \nalleged violations. See, e.g., Hernandez, 2017 WL 4341748, at* 13; Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d \nat 1145; Jarpa, 211 F. Supp. 3d at 711; R.I.L-R, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 191.  Accordingly, the \nscope of the requested preliminary injunctive relief is appropriate. \n- 60-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 61 of 68\nC.  Likelihood of Success on Bond Hearing Claims \nRespondents also argue that Petitioners are not substantially likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their bond hearing claims because neither Lora nor Rodriguez II applies in this \ncase.  (Dkt. 50 at 26-31 ).  As already discussed, the Court disagrees with Respondents' \nposition for the reasons stated above in the section addressing Respondents' Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion to dismiss.  Here, Petitioners have provided numerous declarations averring that \nmembers of the putative class have been detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility \nfor six months or more without a bond hearing.  Respondents have not disputed this fact. \nAt  oral  argument,  Petitioners  and  Respondents  described  the  bond  claims  as \npresenting a legal issue, and the Court agrees with that characterization.  Therefore, since \nPetitioners have provided the declarations of many detainees who are entitled to the six-\nmonth limitation in§ 1225(b), and Respondents have failed to set forth any facts weighing \nagainst the application of that implicit time restriction, the Court determines that Petitioners \nare likely to prevail on their bond hearing claims.  Again, the Court acknowledges that the \nSupreme Court is poised to address this issue in Jennings v. Rodriguez, No. 15-1204 (U.S. \nargued Nov. 30, 2016), and the outcome of that case could change the legal landscape in \nthis area.  However, at this time, based on the law in this Circuit, the Court concludes that \nPetitioners have established a likelihood of success on their claims to a bond hearing. \nRespondents  also briefly argue that 8 U.S.C.  § 1252(f)(l) precludes class-wide \ninjunctive relief for Petitioners' bond claims.  Section 1252(t)(l) provides: \nRegardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party \nor parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall \nhave jurisdiction  or  authority  to  enjoin  or  restrain  the  operation  of the \n- 61 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 62 of 68\nprovisions  of part  IV  of this  subchapter,  as  amended  by  the  Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, other than \nwith respect to the  application of such provisions to  an  individual  alien \nagainst whom proceedings under such part have been initiated. \n!d.  As Respondents note, the Supreme Court has stated that \"[b ]y its plain terms, and even \nby its title, that provision is  nothing more or less than a limit on injunctive relief.  It \nprohibits federal courts from granting classwide injunctive relief against the operation of \n§§  1221-1231.\"  Reno v.  Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm.,  525  U.S.  471, 481-82 \n(1999). \nHowever,  contrary  to  Respondents'  assertions,  §  1252(f)(l)  is  inapplicable  to \nPetitioners' request for relief.  Where, as here, the moving party \"does not seek to enjoin \nthe operation of§§ 1221-1231,\" and instead, seeks to enjoin violations of the statutory and \nregulatory  framework,  the  class-wide  prohibition  on  injunctive  relief is  inapplicable. \nGrimaldo v. Reno, 187 F.R.D. 643,648 (D. Colo. 1999); see Rodriguez L 591 F.3d at 1120 \n(\"Section 1252(f) prohibits only injunction of 'the operation or the detention statutes, not \ninjunction of a violation ofthe statutes.\"); R.I.L-R, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 184 (determining that \n§ 1252(f)(l) \"poses no bar to relief' where the class-wide injunction would \"merely enjoin \nconduct that allegedly violates [§  1226(a)]\"); Tefel v.  Reno, 972 F. Supp. 608, 618 (S.D. \nFla. 1997) (\"Plaintiffs do not seek to enjoin the statute.  They seek to enjoin constitutional \nviolations and policies and practices of the Defendants that result in pretermission and \ndeportation.\"); see also Gordon v.  Johnson, 300 F.R.D. 31, 40 (D. Mass. 2014) (\"[T]he \ncourt need not prohibit the operation of any part of the law to correct the government's \nincorrect application of it.\"). \n- 62-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 63 of 68\nIn  order  to  avoid  \"serious  constitutional  concerns,\"  the  Court  has  construed \n§  1225(b)  to  contain  a  six-month  time  restriction  for  detentions  permitted  under  its \nprovisions without a bond hearing.  Petitioners seek to enjoin Respondents'  failure to \nadhere to this implied statutory term, and request that the Court remedy this violation by \nrequiring Respondents to afford individualized bond hearings to those asylum-seekers who \nhave been detained for six months or more.  Because Petitioners do not seek to enjoin the \noperation of the statute, but rather Respondents' violation of this implicit term,§ 1252(f)(l) \ndoes not bar the requested class-wide injunctive relief. \nD.  Likelihood of Success on Parole Claims \nFor the reasons set forth above in the discussion of Respondents' motion to dismiss, \nthe Court concludes that Respondents are required to comply with the ICE Directive when \nconsidering applications for parole.  Moreover, as discussed above in connection with the \nissue of irreparable harm, Petitioners have alleged sufficient uncontested facts to establish \nongoing violations  of the  ICE Directive.  While the  extent of the violations  and the \nunderlying reasons for the violations may be disputed, Respondents have not offered facts \ncontradicting  the  allegations  that  the  ICE  Directive  has  not  been  followed-indeed, \nRespondents' position (at least before this Court) is that the ICE Directive is not binding. \nAs discussed in the context of the motion to dismiss, the ICE Directive plainly sets \nforth individual rights in the context of parole determinations, and the Accardi doctrine \nrequires that those internal directives be followed.  Respondents told the Supreme Court \nthat the ICE Directive was being followed, and their attempts before this Court to disclaim \nany obligation to follow that Directive are, to say the least, unpersuasive. \n- 63-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 64 of 68\nE.  Public Interest and the Balance of Equities \nPetitioners ask the Court to follow the Ninth Circuit and hold that the public interest \n\"benefits from a preliminary injunction that ensures that federal statutes are construed and \nimplemented in a manner that avoids serious constitutional questions.\"  Rodriguez II, 715 \nF.3d at 1146.  Petitioners also contend that the \"balance ofthe equities\" tips in their favor. \nSchneiderman,  787 F.3d at 649.  In Rodriguez II,  the court held that the government \n\"cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice or reads a \nstatute to avoid constitutional concerns.\"  715 F.3d at 1145. \nHere, as in Rodriguez II, the only potential harm suggested by Respondents is that \nthe order would enjoin \"presumptively lawful government activity\" and would be \"contrary \nto the plain meaning of the statutes.\" !d.  Respondents argue that a preliminary injunction \non Petitioners' parole claims is not in the public interest because the public's interest in \nenforcement ofU.S. immigration laws is paramount. See United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, \n422 U.S. 873, 878-79 (1975).  According to Respondents, to disregard a statutory mandate \nthat makes parole decisions discretionary cannot be in the public interest. \nAgain,  Respondents'  position  misconstrues  the  relief  sought  by  Petitioners. \nGranting preliminary injunctive relief will simply require Respondents to comply with their \nlegal  obligations  and  afford  Petitioners  procedural  protections  in  connection  with \nRespondents'  exercise  of discretion.  Under  Lora,  Respondents  must  provide  bond \nhearings to individuals detained under§ 1225(b) for more than six months.  Furthermore, \ncontrary  to  Respondents'  assertions,  ordering  compliance  with  the  terms  of the  ICE \nDirective is consistent with Second Circuit case law and will not obviate the discretionary \n- 64-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 65 of 68\naspect of parole decisions.  Respondents have affirmatively represented to the Supreme \nCourt that they are following the ICE Directive and that it remains in full force and effect. \nUnder the circumstances, this Court is hard-pressed to see how requiring compliance with \nan internal directive that Respondents so readily embraced before the Supreme Court could \nbe  against  the  public  interest.  Granting  the  preliminary  injunction  will  not  compel \nRespondents to release any detainees on parole or bond.  Rather, it simply means that \ncertain procedural safeguards must be followed when considering the detention of these \nindividuals.  As a result, the Court concludes that the balance of equities tips in favor of \nPetitioners and the public interest is served by an injunction. \nF.  Preliminary Injunction \nRespondents are hereby ordered to immediately adjudicate, or, in cases where there \nis  a prior denial  of parole,  readjudicate the parole applications of all members of the \nputative class, 11  in conformance with their legal obligations, including their obligations \nunder the ICE Directive, including by providing each arriving asylum-seeker an advisal \nsetting forth the requirements to obtain parole; a translation of that information into a \nlanguage understood by the asylum-seeker; a parole interview with an immigration officer; \nan individualized explanation of any denials; and notification of the opportunity to seek \nreconsideration, consistent with the requirements of the ICE Directive. \n11  The \"putative class\" is as follows:  All arriving asylum-seekers who have passed a \ncredible fear interview and who are or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention \nFacility in Batavia, New York, and who have not been granted parole. \n- 65-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 66 of 68\nIn addition, Respondents are also ordered to provide members of the putative class \nwho have been detained for six months or more with individualized bond hearings, in \nconformance with the Second Circuit's decision in Lora.  At oral argument, Respondents \ncontended that they should not be burdened with the heightened \"clear and convincing\" \nevidentiary standard with respect to denial of bond; that is, Respondents assert that they \nshould not have to prove by clear and convincing evidence that an individual is a flight risk \nor a danger to the community to justify the denial of bond.  Respondents argue that the \nSupreme Court has never imposed such an exacting burden in this context.  However, as \nPetitioners noted, that standard has been imposed by the Ninth Circuit since at least 2013, \nsee Rodriguez II, 715 F.3d at 1131, and the Second Circuit has since followed Rodriguez \nII in applying that standard to bond hearing claims arising out of§ 1226(c), Lora, 804 F.3d \nat 616.  In fact,  the district courts in this Circuit that have applied Lora to individuals \ndetained under§ 1225(b) have also extended the clear and convincing evidentiary standard \nin this context.  See, e.g., Morris, 2017 WL 1968314, at *2; Saleem, 2016 WL 4435246, at \n*5; Arias, 2016 WL 3906738, at* 10. \nRodriguez II adopted the clear and convincing evidence standard based on its prior \ndecision in Singh v.  Holder, 638 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir. 2011), which held that \"[g]iven the \nsubstantial  liberty  interest  at  stake[,]  .  .  . the  government  must  prove  by  clear  and \nconvincing evidence that an alien is a flight risk or a danger to the community to justify \ndenial of bond.\"  !d. at 1203.  The Court recognizes that the asylum-seekers at issue here \nenjoy few, if any, constitutional rights under the present state of the law.  See Landon, 459 \nU.S. at 32 (\"This Court has long held that an alien seeking initial admission to the United \n- 66-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 67 of 68\nStates requests a privilege and has no constitutional rights regarding his application, for the \npower to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative.\").  Of course, it would also be \nincorrect to say that these individuals have no rights at all.  See Correa, 901 F .2d at 1171 \nn.5 (noting that \"[r]ights in such circumstances appear to be largely statutorily derived\"). \nIn any event, as  discussed above, LPRs are subject to the mandatory detention \nprovisions of§ 1225(b ).  When an LPR is involved, the rationale in Rodriguez II and Singh \nis particularly compelling given the significant due process liberty interest at stake.  As \nClark noted, the canon of constitutional avoidance applies to avoid an interpretation of a \nstatute  that  would  otherwise  raise  \"serious  constitutional  doubts.\"  543  U.S.  at  381. \nRegardless of whether a particular litigant is entitled to invoke due process in his own right, \nthe  litigant  may  invoke the  canon  of constitutional  avoidance  \"to vindicate  his  own \nstatutory rights.\"  !d. at 382.  Thus, under Singh, Respondents would be required to prove \nby clear and convincing evidence that continued detention is necessary when the bond \napplicant is an LPR; therefore, because non-LPRs also have an implicit right to a bond \nhearing under § 1225(b), the canon of constitutional avoidance requires Respondents to \nmake the same showing when the particular detainee is a non-LPR. \nIt is worth mentioning that a clear and convincing evidence standard should not be \nas insurmountable as Respondents portend.  Indeed, if Respondents execute their parole \nauthority in accordance with the ICE Directive, there should be little cause for concern. \nPursuant to the ICE Directive's provisions, \"absent additional factors,\" arriving aliens who \nhave demonstrated a credible fear of persecution \"should' be released to parole.  ICE \nDirective No. 11002.1, ,-r 6.2 (emphasis added).  By its terms, the ICE Directive encourages \n- 67-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 56   Filed 11/17/17   Page 68 of 68\nrelease to parole supervision. To be sure, there will no doubt be occasions where continued \ndetention  is  strongly  desired,  and,  of course,  this  decision  does  nothing to  erode the \nAttorney  General's  discretionary  authority  to  grant  or  deny  parole.  See  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1182(d)(5)(A).  However, if Respondents follow the ICE Directive, individuals who are \nnot likely to be a flight risk or a danger to the community will have been released on parole \nbefore  six  months  have  passed.  Where  an  individual  is  detained  for  six  months, \nRespondents  should,  under the  ICE  Directive,  have  a  good  reason  for  the  continued \ndetention and should therefore be able to readily meet the clear and convincing evidence \nstandard of proof with respect to the denial ofbond. Conversely, ifRespondents are unable \nto meet their burden at the bond hearing, that failure should indicate that parole would have \nbeen appropriate at an earlier time. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Respondents' motion to dismiss (Dkt. 27) is denied, and \nPetitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 38) is granted. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: November 17, 2017 \nRochester, New York \n- 68-",

I:I7-CV-0072I EAW\nKEVIN MCALEENAN,' in his official capacity as\nActing Secretary of U.S. Department of Homeland\nSecurity; THOMAS BROPHY, in his official\ncapacity as Acting Director of Buffalo Field Office\nof Immigration and Customs Enforcement;\nJEFFREY SEARES, in his official Capacity as\nActing Administrator of the Buffalo Federal\nDetention Facility; and WILLIAM BARR,^ in his\nofficial capacity as Attorney General of the United\nStates,\nRespondents.\nBACKGROUND\nPetitioners Hanad Abdi and Johan Barrios Ramos brought this action seeking relief\non behalf of themselves individually and on behalf of a proposed class of similarly situated\nasylum-seekers held at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, New York (the\n\"Batavia facility\"). (Dkt. 17). On November 17, 2017, the Court issued a Decision and\nOrder denying Respondents' motion to dismiss and granting Petitioners' motion for a\n' K evin McAleenan is the current Acting United States Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity. Accordingly, he is substituted as a respondent in this action. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n25(d).\n2  William Barr is the current United States Attorney General. Accordingly, he is\nsubstituted as a respondent in this action. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d).\n- I -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 129   Filed 04/30/19   Page 2 of 9\npreliminary injunction.  (Dkt. 56).  The Court ordered Respondents to immediately\nadjudicate or readjudicate the parole applications of all members of the putative class of\nasylum-seekers detained at the Buffalo facility in conformance with their legal obligations,\nincluding their obligations under ICE Directive No. 11002.1: Parole of Arriving Aliens\nFound to Have a Credible Fear ofPersecution or Torture (Dec. 8, 2009). {Id. at 65). The\nCourt also ordered Respondents to provide individualized bond hearings to members oft he\nputative subclass who have been detained for six months or more, as required by 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1225(b). {Id. at 66).\nOn December 7, 2017, the Court held oral argument to address Petitioners' then-\npending motion for class action certification. (Dkt. 62; see Dkt. 19). At the conclusion of\nthe motion hearing, the Court required Respondents to give notice to proposed class\ncounsel as soon as a bond hearing was scheduled and to provide the same counsel with a\nlist of all putative class members. {See Dkt. 75 at 31-34). The Court subsequently granted\nPetitioners' motion for class certification on December 19, 2017 (Dkt. 66), certifying a\nclass of \"[a]ll arriving asylum-seekers who have passed a credible fear interview and who\nare or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility and who have not been\ngranted parole,\" as well as a subclass of\" [a]1 1 arriving asylum-seekers who are or will be\ndetained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility, have passed a credible fear interview,\nand have been detained for more than six months without a bond hearing before an\nimmigration judge,\" {id. at 23).\nOn February 9, 2018, the Court issued another Decision and Order, clarifying \"that\nonce an [immigration judge (TJ')] has determined that a detainee should be released on\n-2-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 129   Filed 04/30/19   Page 3 of 9\nbond, he or she must consider the financial circumstances of each subclass member and\nalternative conditions of release in setting the amount of bond\". (Dkt. 83 at 29). As a\nresult, the Court ordered that \"bond hearings must be recalendared and the record\nreopened\" for any subclass member \"who remain[ed] detained notwithstanding an IJ's\ndetermination that release on bond would be appropriate,\" so that \"alternative conditions\nofr elease and the individual's ability to pay\" are considered. {Id.). The Court also required\nRespondents to notify Class Counsel \"of the date and location of each bond hearing ... at\nleast five days in advance of the hearing.\" {Id.).\nOn February 27, 2018, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Jennings v.\nRodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830( 2018), which held, among other things, that 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)\ndoes not contain an implicit six-month time limit on the detention of an alien seeking entry\ninto the United States. See id. at 842-846. On October 31, 2018, Respondents filed a\nmotion to  vacate that part of the Court's preliminary  injunction  requiring that\nindividualized bond hearings be held for all members of the subclass.  (Dkt. 91).\nRespondents seek this relief based upon their interpretation of Jennings. (Dkt. 91-1 at\n8-11). On December 13,2018, Respondents filed a motion to decertify the subclass. (Dkt.\n102). Although Respondents address several issues in their motion papers, the Jennings\ndecision appears to be the impetus for this motion as well. {See Dkt. 102-1 at 8-12, 15-16).\nPetitioners oppose both motions. (Dkt. 99; Dkt. 121).\nRespondents' pending motions are scheduled to be argued on May 15, 2019. (Dkt.\n123). While those pending motions were being briefed—on March 18, 2019—^Petitioners\nfiled a motion to enforce the preliminary injunction and class reporting order. (Dkt. 122).\n-3-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 129   Filed 04/30/19   Page 4 of 9\nPetitioners contend that Respondents are not taking appropriate measures to comply with\nthe Court's prior orders. (Dkt. 122-1). Petitioners request that the Court grant limited\ndiscovery relating to Respondents' current procedures used in complying with the\npreliminary injunction, mandate additional reporting and disclosure conditions, require\nRespondents to hold bond hearings for all applicable class members no later than 195 days\nafter their initial immigration detention and provide notice to all parties no later than two\nweeks before the scheduled hearing date, and direct Respondents to issue a directive\ninforming immigration authorities of their responsibilities under the Court's prior orders.\n(See Dkt. 122-7). Respondents oppose Petitioners'motion. (Dkt. 127).\nHaving reviewed the parties' submissions, the Court finds that Respondents' refusal\nto engage in a discussion with Petitioners concerning the admitted violations oft his Court's\nOrders is unreasonable.( See Dkt. 122-2 at 6( Petitioners' counsel requesting to \"speak with\nthe person(s) collecting information for the monthly class report\" and for Respondents to\nidentify \"what steps [they] plan to take to verify and correct the ongoing [preliminary\ninjunction] violations\"), 8 (Respondents' counsel indicating that they \"don't believe it's\nnecessary for you to communicate directly with agency client representatives\" and that\nthey \"think communication with us is best done over email\"), 16 (Petitioners' counsel\nrequesting  to  speak  over the telephone  and noting that these \"meet-and-confer\nconversations over email, stretched out for days and weeks,\" have not been productive)).\nThe unreasonableness of Respondents' position is only amplified by the fact that there is\nno dispute that Respondents have failed to comply with the requirements imposed by this\nCourt. (See Dkt. 127 at 5 (conceding that there have been occasions when subclass\n-4-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 129   Filed 04/30/19   Page 5 of 9\nmembers were not included on the monthly class lists)). As a result, the Court concludes\nthat it is unnecessary to await the scheduled oral argument date before granting the\nrequested relief of a deposition.\nAccordingly, for the following reasons. Petitioners' motion (Dkt. 122) is granted to\nthe extent that Respondents are hereby ordered to produce a witness or witnesses for\ndeposition within thirty (30) days of this Court's Decision and Order who has personal\nknowledge of the methodology being used by Respondents to identify and report class\nmembers and who can testify concerning any changes made or that will be made by\nRespondents to address the recurring errors in the identification of class members. The\nCourt otherwise reserves decision on the remaining aspects of the motion and all parties\nshall plan on addressing those remaining aspects of the motion at the upcoming oral\nargument scheduled for May 15, 2019.\nDISCUSSION\n\"Federal courts have broad discretion to fashion remedies as equity requires, to\nensure compliance with their orders.\" Cordius Tr. v.

Aug. 21,\n2014) (authorizing several discovery requests, including depositions, \"in light of the\nserious questions raised regarding [the defendant]'s possible violations of the preliminary\ninjunction\"); see also Palmer v. Rice, 231 F.R.D. 21, 25 (D.D.C. 2005)( permitting \"post-\njudgment discovery\" where the \"plaintiffs will not be able to determine whether the\ngovernment has complied with the court's injunctions\"); see generally Campaign for S.\nEqual. V. Bryant, 197 F. Supp. 3d 905, 914 (S.D. Miss. 2016)( stating that \"plaintiffs are\nentitled to reasonable discovery to enforce an injunction against the parties bound by that\ninjunction\").\nIn filing  their  motion. Petitioners  address  various  instances  of purported\nnoncompliance with this Court's preliminary injunction and class reporting orders. The\nremedies Petitioners seek are ultimately intended to ensure that Respondents timely hold\nindividualized bond hearings for all identifiable subclass members and that all participants\nto those proceedings are provided sufficient notice and an adequate time to prepare without\nnecessitating further delay.  Respondents state that they maintain a goal of providing\nindividualized bond hearings within 195 days of a subclass member's initial immigration\ndetention. (Dkt. 127 at 4, 7; Dkt. 127-2 at ^ 7). However, Respondents are under court\norder to provide timely bond hearings. While the Court's preliminary injunction did not\nspecify an exact date at which time the hearing must be held after the six-month\n-6-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 129   Filed 04/30/19   Page 7 of 9\ndemarcation, it should be self-evident that once an asylum-seeker, who is otherwise\nqualified as a member of the subclass, has been detained for over six months, he or she is\nimmediately entitled to a bond hearing pursuant to the Court's preliminary injunction.\nMoreover, the six-month time period runs from the date a class member is taken into\ncustody, regardless of whether the detainee is being held at the Batavia facility. The Court\nis deeply troubled that as recently as last month, government counsel continued to express\nconfusion over this basic proposition. {See Dkt. 128-2 at Tf 5).\nAbsent evidence of extenuating circumstances—^which has not been presented\nhere—^the act of scheduling bond hearings several weeks or, in some cases, months beyond\nthat six-month time limitation does not comport with this Court's injunction.  It goes\nwithout saying that Respondents' opinion of the vitality of the Court's preliminary\ninjunction ^osX-Jennings does not justify ignoring a duly-issued court-ordered injunction.\nIn other words. Respondents are certainly entitled to challenge the Court's preliminary\ninjunction by appealing that decision or moving to vacate the injunction—^but they are not\nentitled to simply disregard the Court's Orders. Accordingly,t he following reliefi s granted\npursuant to the Court's inherent authority to monitor and enforce its prior orders.\nSpecifically, Petitioners request the Court to order Respondents to produce a witness\nfor deposition to determine what process is in place to identify subclass members and how\nthose procedures can be improved, if at all, to remedy the shortfalls identified in their\nmotion papers. While Respondents contend that a deposition is unnecessary in light oft he\ndeclarations submitted in opposition to Petitioners' motion (Dkt. 127 at 5 n.3), these\ndeclarations provide only cursory insight into Respondents' current procedures and do not\n-7-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 129   Filed 04/30/19   Page 8 of 9\nrespond to Petitioners' concerns that some subclass members are being missed. In other\nwords, the several-paragraph descriptions of Respondents' process fail to address\nPetitioners' well-supported belief that these procedures are deficient. See also Nat'I Law\nCtr. on Homelessness & Poverty, 842 F. Supp. 2d at 131 (\"Equity would not be achieved\nif a court decided simply to rubber-stamp an enjoined party's unsupported self-assessment\nof its compliance with a court order.\").  Respondents' inadequate explanation is only\ncompounded by their failure to engage in a meaningful discussion with Petitioners in an\nattempt to rectify these failures. (See Dkt. 122-2 at 5-18).\nPetitioners' ability to identify subclass members is critical to the operation of the\nCourt's preliminary injunction, and thus. Respondents' inability to accurately provide a\nmonthly list to class counsel is troubling regardless of whether Respondents' failure to do\nso is deliberate or unintentional. Accordingly, the Court grants Petitioners' request for\nlimited discovery based on its inherent authority to enforce the preliminary injunction and\nclass reporting orders, and requires Respondents to produce a witness or witnesses for\ndeposition within thirty (30) days of this Court's Decision and Order who has personal\nknowledge of the methodology being used by Respondents to identify and report class\nmembers and who can testify concerning any changes made or that will be made by\nRespondents to address the recurring errors in the identification of class members.

Each\nhas been taken into custody and detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in\nBatavia, New York, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(B)(ii). Each has been imprisoned\nin a maximum-security facility for more than six months without a bond hearing while\nactively seeking admission into the United States.\nThis Court previously certified the subclass and granted a preliminary injunction\nrequiring that bond hearings be provided to the subclass. See Abdi v. Duke, 280 F. Supp.\n- 1 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 2 of 28\n3d 373 (W.D.N.Y. 2017); Abdi v. Duke, 323 F.R.D. 131 (W.D.N.Y. 2017). At the time,\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the majority of district courts in the Second Circuit\nhad imposed a temporal limitation on § 1225(b) through the canon of constitutional\navoidance.  See Abdi, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 390-93.  However, the Supreme Court\nsubsequently held that § 1225(b) cannot reasonably be interpreted to require a bond\nhearing after six months of detention. See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 842-46\n(2018). The Supreme Court's decision in Jennings did not address the constitutional\narguments raised in that case, and the Supreme Court remanded those issues for the Ninth\nCircuit to consider in the first instance. See id. at 851.\nPending before the Court are Respondents' motion to vacate this Court's\npreliminary injunction order (Dkt. 91) and motion to decertify the subclass (Dkt. 102),\nand Petitioners' motion to enforce the preliminary injunction order (Dkt. 122). These\nmotions directly confront several questions left open in Jennings, including whether\nasylum-seekers detained pursuant to § 1225(b)(l)(B)(ii) are entitled to due process\nprotections and, if so, whether the class action device is the appropriate mechanism to\nresolve Petitioners' due process challenges. Respondents also contend that this Court is\nwithout jurisdiction to issue class-wide injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to\n8U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1).\nAssuming arguendo that the subclass enjoys constitutional protections, the Court\nconcludes that the subclass no longer satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. As a result, the subclass must be decertified and the\npreliminary injunction vacated. The Court need not, and does not, decide whether these\n-2-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 3 of 28\nasylum-seekers have Fifth Amendment due process rights.  See Lyng v. Nw. Indian\nCemetery Protective Ass' n, 485 U.S. 439, 445 (1988)( \"A fundamental and longstanding\nprinciple ofj udicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions\nin advance of the necessity of deciding them.\"). Furthermore, in light of this Court's\ndecision to decertify the subclass. Respondents' position that the Court does not have\njurisdiction to issue class-wide injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to § 1252(f)(1) is\na moot point and is not addressed.\nFor the following reasons. Respondents' motion to decertify the subclass (Dkt.\n102) is granted. Accordingly, the Court's preliminary injunction order granting class-\nwide relief in favor of the now decertified subclass is vacated, and Respondents' motion\nto vacate the preliminary injunction (Dkt. 91) and Petitioners' motion to enforce the\npreliminary injunction (Dkt. 122) are both denied as moot.\nBACKGROUND & PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThe Court has issued several decisions relating to the subject matter of this case,\nfamiliarity with which is assumed for purposes of this Decision and Order. The Court has\nsummarized the key details below.\nI.  The Court's Preliminary Injunction\nPetitioners Hanad Abdi and Johan Barrios Ramos( \"Petitioners\") brought this action\nseeking relief on behalf of themselves individually and on behalf of a proposed class of\nsimilarly situated asylum-seekers held at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia,\nNew York. (Dkt. 17). On November 17, 2017, the Court issued a Decision and Order\ndenying Respondents' motion to dismiss and granting Petitioners' motion for a preliminary\n-3 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 4 of 28\ninjunction. SeeAbdi,2 80 F. Supp. 3d 373. The Court ordered Respondents to immediately\nadjudicate or readjudicate the parole applications of all members of the putative class of\nasylum-seekers detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in conformance with\ntheir legal obligations, including their obligations under ICE Directive No. 11002.1: Parole\nofA rriving Aliens Found to Have a Credible Fear ofP ersecution or Torture( Dec. 8,2009)\n(the \"ICE Directive\"). The Court also ordered Respondents to provide individualized bond\nhearings to members of the putative subclass who were detained for six months or more,\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).'  In granting the preliminary injunction, the Court\nconcluded \"that Petitioners are likely to satisfy the Rule 23(a) prerequisites for class\ncertification: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy ofr epresentation.\" Abdi,\n280 F. Supp. 3d at 401 (quotation omitted).\nII.  The Court's Subsequent Class Certification and Clarification Orders and the\nSupreme Courfs  Decision in Jennings v. Rodri2uez\nConsistent with its findings in granting the preliminary injunction, on December 19,\n2017, the Court issued a Decision and Order granting Petitioners' motion for class\ncertification.  See Abdi, 323 F.R.D. 131.  Specifically, the Court defined the certified\nsubclass as follows:\nAll arriving asylum-seekers who are or will be detained at the Buffalo\nFederal Detention Facility, have passed a credible fear interview, and have\nbeen detained for more than six months without a bond hearing before an\nimmigration judge.\n' T he pending motions concern only the continued viability  of this  Court's\npreliminary injunction and class certification orders as they pertain to the subclass.\n-4-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 5 of 28\nId. at 145. On January 11, 2018, Respondents filed an interlocutory appeal of the Court's\nDecision and Order granting the preliminary injunction. (Dkt. 74).\nOn February 9, 2018, the Court issued another Decision and Order, which clarified\nthe preliminary injunction to require \"that once an [immigration judge ('IJ')] has\ndetermined that a detainee should be released on bond, he or she must consider the financial\ncircumstances of each subclass member and alternative conditions of release in setting the\namount of bond.\" Abdi v. Nielsen, 287 F. Supp. 3d 327,345( W.D.N.Y. 2018). As a result,\nthe Court ordered that \"bond hearings must be recalendared and the record reopened\" for\nany subclass member \"who remain[ed] detained notwithstanding an IJ's determination that\nrelease on bond would be appropriate,\" so that \"alternative conditions of release and the\nindividual's ability to pay\" were given consideration.  Id.  The Court also required\nRespondents to notify Class Counsel \"of the date and location of each bond hearing ... at\nleast five days in advance of the hearing.\" Id. On February 15, 2018, Respondents filed\nan amended notice of interlocutory appeal. (Dkt. 84).\nOn February 27, 2018, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Jennings, which\nrejected the Ninth Circuit's interpretation oft he Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1101 et seq. (the \"INA\"), and held that § 1225(b) of the INA could not plausibly be\nconstrued to contain an implicit six-month time constraint at which point a bond hearing\nwas statutorily required. 138 S. Ct. at 842-46. In doing so, the Court determined that the\ncanon of constitutional avoidance was not applicable because § 1225(b) mandated\n\"detention of applicants for admission until certain proceedings have concluded,\" and\n\"nothing in the statutory text impose[d] any limit on the length of detention.\" Id. at 842.\n-5-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 6 of 28\nIn other words, because the plain text of § 1225(b) was not amendable to any other\nplausible construction, the constitutional avoidance canon of statutory interpretation did\nnot apply. See id. at 844. However, the Jennings majority did not address whether the\nConstitution mandated periodic bond hearings and remanded the case for consideration of\nthese constitutional arguments in the first instance.^ See id. at 851.\nHI.  Respondents* Motions to Vacate the Preliminary Injunction and to Decertify\nthe Subclass\nOn September 5, 2018, the Second Circuit remanded Respondents' appeal for\n\"further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision\" in Jennings. (Dkt. 90).\nOn October 31, 2018, Respondents filed a motion to vacate that part of the Court's\npreliminary injunction that required individualized bond hearings for each subclass\nmember held in immigration detention for six months or longer. (Dkt. 91). Respondents'\napplication is based upon their interpretation of Jennings. (Dkt. 91-1 at 8-11).  First,\nRespondents contend that Jennings suggests that this Court is without jurisdiction to issue\nclass-wide injunctive relief pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). (Dkt. 91-1 at 8-9). Because\n§ 1 252(f)(1) prohibits courts \"other than the Supreme Court\" from \"enjoin[ing]\" or\n\"restrain[ing]\" the operation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1221-1232, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1),\nRespondents contend that the preliminary injunction violates this provision by enjoining\nthe operation of § 1225(b)( Dkt. 91-1 at 8-9). Second, Respondents contend that even if\n^ T he Ninth Circuit, in turn, has remanded those issues to the district court for it to\nconsider in the first instance. See Rodriguez v. Marin, 909 F.3d 252, 257 (9th Cir. 2018).\nThe district court has not yet issued a subsequent decision addressing the parties'\nconstitutional arguments.\n-6-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 7 of 28\nthe Court has jurisdiction to issue class-wide injunctive relief after Jennings, the basis for\nthe instant injunction has been eliminated. {Id. at 9-11). Specifically, Respondents take\nthe position that because 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b) cannot plausibly be interpreted as containing\nan implicit six-month time limit under the canon of constitutional avoidance, this Court's\nrationale for requiring a bond hearing after six months in immigration detention is no\nlonger viable. {Id.).\nOn December 13,2018, Respondents filed a motion to decertify the subclass. (Dkt.\n102). Although Respondents address several issues in their motion papers, the Jennings\ndecision serves as the impetus for this motion as well. {See Dkt. 102-1 at 8-12, 15-16).\nRespondents assert the same § 1252(f)(1)j urisdictional arguments raised in their motion\nto vacate. {Id. at 8-10). In addition. Respondents contend that § 1252(f)(1) also bars any\nclass-wide declaratory relief because it would \"essentially afford[] injunctive relief, serve[]\nas a basis for later injunctive relief, or [would be] identical to the injunctive relief sought.\"\n{Id. at 12; see id. at 10-12). Furthermore, Respondents argue that even if this Court has\njurisdiction to grant Petitioners class-wide relief in any form. Petitioners' due process\nclaims are not capable of a uniform or common resolution as required by Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23. {Id. at 12-15). Finally, Respondents contend that because the subclass\nwas originally certified based upon an incorrect construction of 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), it\nshould be decertified on that ground as well. {Id. at 15-16).\nAlthough Petitioners oppose both motions (Dkt. 99; Dkt. 121), they do not dispute\nthat the Supreme Court has eliminated the statutory basis for this Court's injunction and\nclass certification orders as they relate to the subclass.  Petitioners claim that their\n-7-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 8 of 28\nentitlement to the type of individualized bond hearings required by this Court's prior orders\nis rooted in the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. As such, they contend that the\nsubclass members have a constitutional due process right to receive a bond hearing after\nsix months or more of immigration detention. (Dkt. 99 at 14-30). Petitioners also argue\nthat there are several reasons why this Court has jurisdiction to issue class-wide injunctive\nor, alternatively, declaratory relief.  (See id. at 30-31; Dkt. 121 at 10-21).  Finally,\nPetitioners contend that the subclass still satisfies the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23 and the Supreme Court's decision in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564\nU.S. 338 (2011). (Dkt. 121 at 22-27).\nIV.  Petitioners' Motion to Enforce the Preliminary Iniunction\nOn March 18,2019, Petitioners filed a motion to enforce the preliminary injunction\nand class reporting order. (Dkt. 122). Petitioners contend that Respondents are not taking\nappropriate measures to comply with this Court's prior orders. (iSeeDkt. 122-1). On April\n30,2019, the Court issued a Decision and Order granting Petitioners' motion to enforce in\npart, ordering limited discovery on the methodology used by Respondents to identify and\nreport class members and any changes made or that will be made by Respondents to address\nthe recurring errors in their identification of class members. (Dkt. 129).  The Court\nreserved decision on the remaining aspects of Petitioners' motion to enforce. (Id.).\nOn June 10,2019, the Court held oral argument on the pending motions. (Dkt. 141).\nThe Court instructed the parties to meet and confer to address any remaining issues on\nPetitioners' motion to enforce and set a briefing schedule for the parties to identify any\ndisputes relating to that motion that were left unresolved. The Court reserved decision on\n-8-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 9 of 28\nthe remaining issues. The parties subsequently filed additional submissions pertaining to\nPetitioners' motion to enforce that outlined what issues had been resolved and what issues\nremained outstanding. (Dkt. 142; Dkt. 143; Dkt. 144). Petitioners have also filed two letter\nsubmissions identifying additional case authorities in support of their opposition to\nRespondents' motions. (Dkt. 145; Dkt. 149).  Respondents have responded to these\nsupplemental filings and argue against the applicability of the case law identified by\nPetitioners. (Dkt. 146; Dkt. 150).\nDISCUSSION\nI.  Jenninss Represents an Intervening Change in Controlling Law that Warrants\nReexamination of this Court's Class Certification Order\nA.  Statutory Background for an \"Arriving Alien\"\n\"Section 1225(b) of Title 8, United States Code, sets forth procedures for the\ninspection and detention of individuals who are 'applicants for admission' to the United\nStates.\" Perez v. Decker, No. 18-CV-5279 (VEC), 2018 WL 3991497, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nAug. 20, 2018)( quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a)(1), (b)). These individuals are often labeled\nas \"arriving aliens,\" a phrase that has been defined to include, inter alia, \"an applicant for\nadmission  coming  or  attempting  to  come  into  the  United  States  at  a\nport-of-entry.\"  8 C.F.R. § 1001.l(q).  Section 1225(b)(1) \"applies to aliens initially\ndetermined to  be inadmissible due to fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of valid\ndocumentation\" and \"certain other aliens designated by the Attorney General in his\ndiscretion,\" while § 1225(b)(2) generally \"serves as a catchall provision that applies to all\napplicants for admission not covered by § 1225(b)(1).\" Jennings, 138 S.

(quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(A)(i)), \"unless the\nalien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 ... or a fear of\npersecution,\" 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(A)(i). If an arriving alien indicates an intent to apply\nfor asylum or a fear of persecution, the immigration officer \"shall refer the alien for an\ninterview by an asylum officer.\"  Id. § 1225(b)(l)(A)(ii).  \"If the [asylum] officer\ndetermines  at  the time of the  interview  that  an alien  has a credible  fear  of\npersecution .. ., the alien shall be detained for further consideration of the application for\nasylum.\" Id. § 1225(b)(l)(B)(ii).\nThe asylum-seekers who compose the subclass are detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1225(b)(l)(B)(ii).  Because § 1225(b) does not require Respondents to afford bond\nhearings after six months of immigration detention, see Jennings, 138 S.

The Bond Hearing Requirement Before Jennings\nAt the time this Court granted the preliminary injunction, the Ninth Circuit required\nbond hearings to be held for aliens detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) and 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1225(b), as a matter ofs tatutory interpretation. See Rodriguez v. Rabbins,!\\ 5 F.3d 1127,\n1133 (9th Cir. 2013).  Moreover, the Second Circuit had adopted the Ninth Circuit's\napproach—at least as it pertained to aliens detained pursuant to § 1226(c)—and imposed a\nbright-line rule that those alien detainees be afforded a bond hearing after six months of\nimmigration detention. See Lara v. Shanahan, 804 F.3d 601, 616 (2d Cir. 2015)( \"[I]n\norder to avoid the constitutional concerns raised by indefinite detention, an immigrant\ndetained pursuant to section 1226(c) must be afforded a bail hearing before an immigration\njudge within six months of his or her detention.\"), cert, granted,j udgment vacated, 138 S.\nCt. 1260 (2018). Furthermore, as the Court recognized when it granted the preliminary\ninjunction in this case, a majority of district courts in this Circuit applied Lara and\nRodriguez to impose a six-month bond hearing requirement in favor of arriving aliens\ndetained pursuant to § 1225(b). Abdi, 280 F. Supp. 3d at 392-93.\nIn granting Petitioners' request for injunctive relief, this Court discerned persuasive\nreasons to apply the rationale endorsed by these courts to the subclass at issue. In addition,\nthe Court concluded that class certification was likely, id. at 401, and ultimately the Court\ncertified the subclass, Abdi, 323 F.R.D. 131. Accordingly, the Court ordered Respondents\nto afford a bond hearing in all instances where an asylum-seeker had demonstrated a\ncredible fear of persecution or torture, was detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention\nFacility, and had been held in immigration detention for six months or more. Abdi, 280 F.\n- 12-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 13 of 28\nSupp. 3d at 411. This temporal bright-line rule was the linchpin to the Court's conclusion\nthat individualized bond hearings could be applied \"across-the-board to each putative class\nmember,\" id. at 403 n.lO, separating those entitled to a bond hearing from those who were\nnot.\nD.  The Bond Hearing Requirement After Jennings\nJennings held that § 1225(b) does not contain an implicit six-month time limit at\nwhich point a bond hearing must be held, thus eliminating the statutory six-month bright-\nline rule formulated in Rodriguez and adopted by Lara. 138 S. Ct. at 844. As a result, the\nSupreme Court subsequently granted certiorari in Lara, vacated the judgment, and\nremanded the case for \"further consideration\" in light of its decision m Jennings. Shanahan\nV. Lara, 138 S. Ct. 1260( 2018). On remand,t he Second Circuit dismissed the case as moot\nbecause the petitioner in that matter had been granted a cancellation of removal. See Lara\nV. Shanahan, 719 F. App'x 79, 80( 2d Cir. 2018).\nThe Second Circuit has not addressed, ^o?X-Jennings and post-Lora, the standard to\nbe utilized by courts in addressing procedural due process claims for aliens detained in the\nimmigrant habeas context. However, the overwhelming majority of district courts within\nthe Circuit to have addressed the issue in the context of 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c)—^pertaining to\nthe detention of criminal aliens—have adopted a case-by-case approach where \"courts\nexamine each individual's detention circumstances to determine whether it has become\n'unreasonable or unjustified.'\"  Cabral v. Decker, 331 F. Supp. 3d 255, 261 (S.D.N.Y.\n2018)( quoting Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 532 (2003)). The case-by-case approach is\nan \"as-applied, fact-based analysis . . . derived from the Supreme Court's decisions in\n- 13-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 14 of 28\n\\Zadvydas v.

May 1, 2019).\nThe factors set forth by district courts in this Circuit for a court to consider in\ndetermining whether an alien's length of detention has become unreasonable or unjustified\nin the § 1226(c) context can be summed up as follows:\n(1) the length of time the petitioner has been detained; (2) the party\nresponsible for the delay;( 3) whether the petitioner has asserted defenses to\nremoval;( 4) whether the detention will exceed the time the petitioner spent\nin prison for the crime that made him removable;( 5) whether the detention\nfacility is meaningfully different from a penal institution for criminal\ndetention;( 6) the nature of the crimes committed by the petitioner; and (7)\nwhether the petitioner's detention is near conclusion.\n- 14-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 15 of 28\nCabral, 331 F.

However, some district courts have concluded that due\nprocess does not require a bond hearing for aliens detained pursuant to § 1225(b) and the\nprocedure for discretionary parole pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) is sufficient to\nsatisfy any due process concerns. See Alexandre v. Decker, No. 17 Civ. 5706 (GBD)\n(KHP), 2019 WL 1407353, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2019)( parole process pursuant to 8\nU.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) satisfied due process for alien detained pursuant to § 1225(b));\nPoonjani v. Shanahan, 319 F.

At least one court in\nthis district has concluded that while due process does not require an individualized bond\nhearing for an alien detained pursuant to § 1225(b), the petitioner was entitled to \"a rigorous\ncustody review\" that mandated more than parole review in the discretion of the Attorney\nGeneral.

The Six-Month Bright-Line Rule Is No Longer Viable\nPrior to Jennings, most courts in this Circuit concluded that after six months an\nindividualized bond hearing was statutorily required for aliens detained pursuant to\n§ 1226(c) or § 1225(b). However, at least in the context of aliens detained pursuant to\n§ 1226(c), that six-month hard-and-fast statutory rule has been replaced by a malleable and\nflexible due process analysis. See Lanlrford v. Idaho, 500 U.S. 110, 121 (1991)( \"Due\nprocess is not a mechanical instrument. It is not a yardstick. It is a process. It is a delicate\nprocess of adjustment inescapably involving the exercise ofj udgment by those whom the\nConstitution entrusted with the unfolding of the process.\" (quoting Joint Anti-Fascist\nRefugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 163( 1951)( Frankfurter, J., concurring))). The\nlaw is unsettled as to whether due process may require individualized bond hearings for\nthose detained pursuant to § 1225(b). But assuming arguendo for purposes oft his Decision\nand Order that it does, the six-month bright-line rule that this Court relied upon in granting\nits preliminary injunction and certification of the subclass is no longer viable.\nThe Court is not unsympathetic to the circumstances confronting the subclass\nmembers and does not quarrel with Petitioners' contention that \"[s]ix months is a\nsignificant amount of time to spend incarcerated.\" (Dkt. 99 at 27); see Muniz v. Hoffman,\n422 U.S. 454, 477( 1975)( \"It is not difficult to grasp the proposition that six months in jail\nis a serious matter for any individual. . . .\"); see also Chavez-Alvarez v. Warden York Cty.\nPrison, 783 F.3d 469, 477 (3d Cir. 2015)( nine months in civil immigration detention\n\"strain[s] any common-sense definition of a limited or brief civil detention\"), abrogated in\npart and on other grounds by Jennings, 138 S. Ct. 830; see generally Guerrero-Sanchez v.\n- 17-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 18 of 28\nWarden York Cty. Prison, 905 F.3d 208, 220 n.9 (3d Cir. 2018)( \"[T]he reality is that\nmerely calling a confinement 'civil detention' does not, of itself, meaningfully differentiate\nit from penal measures.\" (quotation and original alteration omitted)).  According to\nPetitioners' undisputed factual submissions, \"the mental health of [asylum-seeker]\ndetainees deteriorates over time and substantially worsens after detention of greater than\nsix months.\" (Dkt. 100 at 15).  Petitioners have also submitted unrefuted evidence\nsuggesting that even when asylum claims are diligently pursued, they may \"easily take\nmore than six months\" before reaching a conclusion. {See Dkt. 99-2 at T| 20).\nIt may very well be the case that an individualized due process analysis would\nrequire a bond hearing for the majority of asylum-seekers who form the subclass after six\nmonths of immigration detention.  Nonetheless, other than identifying \"bright-line\nconstitutional rules\" in different—and inapposite—\"custodial and detention contexts,\"\nPetitioners have failed to explain why the flexible notions of due process categorically\nrequire a bond hearing after the passage of six months' time. While certain principles\narising out of criminal jurisprudence may be somewhat analogous to civil immigration\ndetention, the cases relied upon by Petitioners do not compel the conclusion that a six-\nmonth bright-line rule is mandated by the Constitution. Cf. Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U.S.\n98,111-12( 2010)( holding that where a defendant \"has been out of custody for two weeks\nbefore the contested interrogation, the court is spared the fact-intensive inquiry into\nwhether he ever, anywhere, asserted his Miranda right to counsel\"); County ofR iverside v.\nMcLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56 (1991)( holding that \"judicial determinations of probable\ncause within 48 hours of arrest will, as a general matter,\" be sufficiently prompt for Fourth\n- 18-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 19 of 28\nAmendment purposes); Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 70-74( 1970)( holding that the\nSixth Amendment requires a jury trial for any crimes punishable by imprisonment for more\nthan six months). Indeed, the six-month rule in Baldwin was \"based on 'the existing laws\nand practices in the Nation' with regard to jury trials,\" Reid v. Donelan, 390 F. Supp. 3d\n201, 218 (D. Mass. 2019)( quoting Baldwin, 399 U.S. at 70), appealsf iled, No. 19-1787\n(1st Cir. Aug. 13, 2019), No. 19-1900 (1st Cir. Sept. 23, 2019);  Baldwin, 399 U.S. at\n71-72 (stating that with \"few exceptions, crimes triable without a jury in the American\nStates since the late 18th century were also generally punishable by no more than a six-\nmonth prison term,\" and that \"[i]n the entire Nation, New York City alone denies an\naccused the right to interpose between himself and a possible prison term of over six\nmonths, the commonsense judgment of a jury of his peers\"), and Petitioners \"provide no\nreason why this historically based six-month cutoff should apply to the materially different\ncontext of immigration detention, especially given Congress's unique authority to legislate\nwith regard to aliens,\" Reid, 390 F. Supp. 3d at 218 (citing Demore, 538 U.S. at 521). In\nother words, the holdings in the cases relied upon by Petitioners have little bearing on how\nlong civil immigration detention may continue absent an opportunity for bail without\noffending due process principles.\nUnderstandably,  \"bright-line  rules  provide  clear  guidance  and  ease  of\nadministration to government officials.\"  Lara, 804 F.3d at 615.  Petitioners are not\nincorrect in identifying this advantage to a six-month bond hearing requirement. See, e.g.,\nShatzer, 559 U.S. at 110 (\"[L]aw enforcement officers need to know, with certainty and\nbeforehand, when renewed interrogation is lawful.\"); McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 55-56 (\"[l]t\n- 19-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 20 of 28\nis not enough to say that probable cause determinations must be 'prompt.' This vague\nstandard simply has not provided sufficient guidance.\"). However, a bright-line rule would\nconstrict the flexibility inherent to a due process inquiry and is inconsistent with the\nSupreme Court's teachings in Jennings. See Cabral, 331 F. Supp. 3d at 260 (\"While the\nSupreme Court left open the issue of what requirements are imposed by the Due Process\nClause oft he Fifth Amendment, it would be inconsistent with the discussion of due process\nin Jennings to find a due process requirement ofa n automatic bond hearing after a detention\nof six months. Rather, the Supreme Court stressed the flexible nature of the Due Process\nClause.\" (citation omitted)); see also United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 748 (1987)\n(rejecting the \"categorical\" conclusion that \"the Due Process Clause prohibits pretrial\ndetention on the ground of danger to the community as a regulatory measure, without\nregard to the duration of the detention\" in favor of a balancing analysis between \"the\nGovernment's regulatory interest in community safety\" and \"an individual's liberty\ninterest\"( quotation omitted)).\nTherefore, because the  Supreme Court has eliminated the  legal  basis to\ncategorically impose a six-month bond hearing requirement in the case of every alien\ndetained pursuant to § 1225(b)(l)(B)(ii), Jennings represents an intervening change in\ncontrolling law warranting the reexamination oft his Court's Decision and Order certifying\nthe subclass pursuant to Rule 23.\n20-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 21 of 28\nII.  The Subclass No Longer Satisfies the Requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) and\nMust Be Decertified\nRespondents' substantive decertification arguments are primarily based upon Rule\n23(a)'s commonality requirement and the Supreme Court's decision in Dukes, 564 U.S.\n338. Specifically, Respondents argue that because due process is a flexible concept, each\nsubclass member's particular circumstances make uniform disposition of their claims\nimpossible under the class-action device. {See Dkt. 102-1 at 12-15). Petitioners oppose\nRespondents' motion and argue that Respondents' assertions \"ignore[] that whether due\nprocess requires bond hearings across the subclass, or only on an individual basis, is a\ncommon question in itself.\" (Dkt. 121 at 23).\nIn remanding the action, the Jennings Court advised the Ninth Circuit to \"consider\nwhether a Rule 23(b)(2) class action continues to be the appropriate vehicle for\nrespondents' claims in light of the Supreme Court's holding in Dukes. 138 S. Ct. at 851.\nIn Dukes, the Court held that \"Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or\ndeclaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.  It does not\nauthorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a\ndifferent injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant.\"  564 U.S. at 360.\nJennings cautioned that because\nsome members of the certified class may not be entitled to bond hearings as\na constitutional matter[,]... it may no longer be true that the complained-of\n\"conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all\nthe class members or as to none of them.\"\n138 S. Ct. at 852 (citation omitted)( quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360).\n21 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 22 of 28\nRespondents raise similar arguments in their motion papers. They argue that \"an\nindividualized fact-specific inquiry\" pursuant to the Due Process Clause is not susceptible\nto the class action device and thus, a single injunctive or declaratory judgment would not\nprovide relief for each member of the subclass. (Dkt. 102-1 at 13). Respondents illustrate\nthis point by arguing that \"one particular subclass member may be denied parole and\ndetained beyond six months for reasons that are completely inapplicable to another\nsubclass member.\" {Id. at 14).\n\"A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if. . . the party\nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,\nso that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting\nthe class as a whole....\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \"The key to the (b)(2) class is the\nindivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—^the notion that the\nconduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class\nmembers or as to none of them.\" Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (quotation omitted).\nPetitioners strenuously contend that the subclass is still  viable because any\nindividual factual differences between the asylum-seekers are immaterial in this context as\neach subclass member is categorically entitled to the same process. {See Dkt. 121 at 24-25).\nCertainly, whether or not each subclass member is entitled to a bond hearing does not\ndepend upon their individual likelihood of being granted bond, or even, ultimately, being\ngranted asylum. See generally Sajous, 2018 WL 2357266, at *11 (in applying the multi-\nfactor test, \"[t]he Court need not inquire into the strength of relevant defenses to removal,\n\"it is sufficient to note their existence and the resulting possibility that the [pjetitioner will\n-22-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 23 of 28\nultimately not be removed, which diminishes the ultimate purpose of detaining the\n[pjetitioner pending a final determination as to whether he is removable\"). However, to\nconclude that an individual detained pursuant to § 1225(b) is entitled to a bond hearing\nunder  due  process  principles  is  necessarily  a  fact-specific  and  individualized\ndetermination.\nIn granting certification of the subclass, the Court rejected Respondents' position\nthat an analysis of each asylum-seeker's individual circumstances was necessary to afford\nthe subclass the relief it sought.  Abdi, 323 F.R.D. at 144.  The Court reached this\nconclusion, in part, because the entitlement to a bond hearing was inextricably tied to each\nsubclass member's time in immigration detention. Id. at 145 (\"[The proposed subclass\nmembers have no responsibility to justify the availability of the bond hearing itself; once\nthe six-month time limit has expired, it becomes Respondents' statutory obligation to hold\na hearing. ..  .\")). The six-month temporal rule endorsed by Lora and Rodriguez was the\nadhesive that held the subclass together.  While it may be possible for Petitioners to\ndemonstrate that some subclass members have been detained for a constitutionally infirm\nperiod. Petitioners have not demonstrated that such is the case for all current and future\nsubclass members. Any such determination is no longer automatically triggered by time\nin custody.\nPetitioners contend that Jennings was principally concerned with how Rule 23(b)(2)\nand Dukes applied to the class at issue in that case, which included \"both arriving asylum-\nseekers and lawful permanent residents returning from overseas travel,\" and not to a class\nsimilar to the subclass here, which \"includes only [similarly situated] arriving asylum-\n-23 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 24 of 28\nseekers.\" (Dkt. 121 at 27).  This is an overly narrow view of the Supreme Court's\nadmonishment. The Jennings Court believed that Dukes \"may be relevant on remand\nbecause ... some members of the certified class may not be entitled to bond hearings as a\nconstitutional matter.\" Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 852. This concern reflects the precise issue\nraised here: due to the variability and flexibility intrinsic to an individualized due process\ninquiry, the fact-specific circumstances of each alien will dictate whether each is or is not\nentitled to a bond hearing—assuming that each subclass member enjoys constitutional due\nprocess protections.  Therefore, because Petitioners have failed to demonstrate that all\ncurrent and future subclass members are entitled to a bond hearing after a certain period of\ntime, even if some or even a significant majority of subclass members may be entitled to\nsuch relief, a single injunction may not issue in favor oft his subclass. See Dukes, 564 U.S.\nat 360 (stating that \"Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction ... would provide\nrelief to each member oft he class\"( emphases added)).\nIn the alternative. Petitioners request that the Court issue a declaratory judgment,\ndeclaring that continued mandatory immigration detention for six months or more is\nunconstitutional as applied to each subclass member. However, the viability of any such\ndeclaratory judgment also hinges upon the existence of a six-month bright-line rule. In\nother words, for this declaratory relief to apply across-the-board to each subclass member,\nit is necessary to conclude that the Due Process Clause categorically requires that a bond\nhearing be held after six months' time in the custody of immigration authorities. Because,\nfor the reasons stated above, the Constitution requires no such bright-line rule. Petitioners\nare unable to maintain a Rule 23(b)(2) class based upon their requested declaratory relief\n-24-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 25 of 28\nfor the same reasons that they are unable to do so based upon their requested injunctive\nrelief. See id. (the indivisibility requirement of Rule 23(b)(2) requires that the conduct can\nbe \"declared unlawful only as to all oft he class members or as to none oft hem\"( emphasis\nadded)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) (providing that \"final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief must be \"appropriate respecting the class as a whole\").\nPetitioners urge the Court to follow Reid v. Donelan, No. CV 13-30125-PBS, 2018\nWL 5269992 (D. Mass. Oct. 23, 2018) and deny Respondents' motion to decertify the\nsubclass. The Reid case upheld the certification of a class of criminal aliens detained\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c).  In explaining why the class continued to satisfy the\ncommonality requirement for class certification, the court stated:\nThe Government may ultimately prevail on its merits argument that the\nConstitution requires an individualized determination of whether an alien's\ndetention has become unreasonable. However, the class still presents the\ncommon threshold question of whether their detention after six months\nwithout a bail hearing or reasonableness review violates the Constitution.\nEven ift he answer to that question is no,t he class still meets the commonality\nrequirement.\nId. at *5. However, Petitioners' reliance on Reid is misplaced because this Court has\nalready determined that a six-month bright-line limitation does not survive Jennings.^\nIt can no longer be said that Respondents are acting in a manner generally applicable\nto all members of the subclass because while each subclass member has been detained for\nsix months or longer, the individual circumstances of each asylum-seeker may preclude a\n^ I n fact, the Reid court subsequently rejected the plaintiffs' arguments in favor of a\nbright-line six-month bond hearing requirement for criminal aliens detained pursuant to\n§ 1226(c). See Reid v. Donelan, 390 F. Supp. 3d 201, 219( D. Mass. 2019).\n-25-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 26 of 28\nfinding that Respondents have unconstitutionally prolonged their detention.  In other\nwords, even if each subclass members' detention has become \"constitutionally suspect\"\nthat does not necessarily mean that it has become unconstitutionally prolonged in the\nabsence of an opportunity to post bond. Without the benefit of the six-month temporal\nlimitation, each subclass member's individual detention may be deemed constitutionally\ninfirm at different points in time. Because this result would require multiple court orders\nor decrees. Rule 23(b)(2) is an inappropriate device to maintain class certification of the\nsubclass as it is presently defined. See Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (stating that Rule 23(b)(2)\n\"does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be\nentitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant\").\nDue process is not intended to be applied in a mechanical or rigid fashion.\nDetermining what process is due requires a case-by-case approach. An individualized\ninquiry, such as the multi-factor test described above, permits courts to consider the totality\nof each detainee's circumstances. The inherent flexibility of this approach is consistent\nwith decades of Supreme Court precedent and the Court's cautionary words in Jennings.\nAs one Second Circuit decision has held:\nBecause of the possible variance in factual situations, it may well be that [the\nstatute] is unconstitutional as applied to certain members of the purported\nclass and yet may be constitutional as applied to others. Where such a line\ncould be drawn is not readily apparent, and it would be much more\nappropriate to handle difficult constitutional questions arising from the\napplication of the statute to varying fact-patterns on a case-by-case basis\nrather than in a class action.\nDale V. Hahn, 440 F.2d 633,6 40( 2d Cir. 1971)( footnote omitted). This rationale applies\nwith equal force to the facts presented here.\n-26-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 27 of 28\nThe Court does not mean to suggest that Petitioners are without any remaining\nrecourse. The Court merely holds that the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause does\nnot categorically require that bond hearings take place after six months of immigration\ndetention, and that without this prQ-Jennings temporal limitation, the subclass must be\ndecertified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) and Dukes. Indeed, other courts confronting similar\nclass-related issues permitted the plaintiffs in those actions to amend their pleadings and\nclass definitions in light of the Jennings decision. See Reid, 2018 WL 5269992; Rodriguez\nV. Rabbins, Case No. 2:07-cv-03239-TJH-RNB, Dkt. 514 (C.D. Cal. July 10, 2019). In\nfact, the Reid court issued declaratory class relief explaining the constitutional rights of the\n§ 1226(c)c lass and granting a permanent injunction outlining the procedures to be afforded\nat any bond hearing held pursuant to that court's decree. See Reid, 390 F. Supp. 3d at\n227-28.\nHere, Petitioners have sought no such relief. While Petitioners have continuously\nrequested injunctive and declaratory relief under both statutory and constitutional\nprinciples (Dkt. 17 at  14-15), the relief requested remains tailored for the period when\na six-month bright-line rule remained good law in this Circuit. For the reasons outlined\nabove. Petitioners' allegations are a relic of a now bygone era.\nBecause the subclass, as currently defined, is no longer certifiable under Rule\n23(b)(2) in the absence of a categorical six-month bond hearing requirement, the Court\ngrants Respondents'( Dkt. 102) motion to decertify the subclass and, consequently, vacates\nthat part of the Court's preliminary injunction order which issued in favor of the now\ndecertified subclass.  Accordingly, Respondents' motion to vacate the preliminary\n-27-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 151   Filed 09/24/19   Page 28 of 28\ninjunction (Dkt. 91) and Petitioners' motion to enforee the preliminary injunction (Dkt.\n122) are both denied as moot.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons. Respondents' motion to decertify the subclass( Dkt. 102)\nis granted, and the Court vacates that part of its preliminary injunetion order which issued\nin favor of the now decertified subelass. Respondents' motion to vacate the preliminary\ninjunction (Dkt. 91) and Petitioners' motion to enforce the preliminary injunction (Dkt.\n122) are both denied as moot.\nSO ORDERED.\neliz^etiua: wo\nUpitdd States District Judge\nDated:  September 24, 2019\nRochester, New York\n-28 -",

(Dkt. 66).  Specifically, the Court defined the \ncertified class as follows: \"All arriving asylum-seekers who have passed a credible fear \ninterview and who are or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility and \nwho have not been granted parole.\"  (!d.  at 23).  The Court also defined the certified \nsubclass as follows: \"All arriving asylum-seekers who are or will be detained at the Buffalo \nFederal Detention Facility, have passed a credible fear interview, and have been detained \nfor more than six months without a bond hearing before an immigration judge.\"  (!d.). \nOn January 8, 2018, Petitioners filed a motion to clarify the preliminary injunction \n(Dkt. 67), and a motion to expedite consideration of their motion to clarify (Dkt. 68).  The \nCourt granted,  in part,  Petitioners'  motion to expedite,  setting a briefing schedule for \nresponse and reply papers as well as a motion hearing date of January 26, 2018.  (Dkt. 73). \nOn  January  11,  2018,  Respondents  filed  an  interlocutory  appeal  from  this  Court's \nNovember 17, 2017, Decision.  (Dkt. 74).  Respondents have since submitted response \n- 2 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 3 of 30\npapers  in  opposition  to  Petitioners'  motion  to  clarify  (Dkt.  76),  and Petitioners have \nsubmitted reply papers (Dkt. 78).  On January 26, 2018, the Court held argument on the \nmotion to clarify and reserved decision. \nDuring oral argument, Respondents contended that the Court should not decide the \nmotion without reviewing transcripts of the bond proceedings held before the Immigration \nJudges (\"IJ\"), which Respondents had neither submitted nor prepared in connection with \nthis  motion.  The  Court  granted  Respondents  an  opportunity  to  file  a  supplemental \nsubmission containing these transcripts.  The Court has since received and reviewed the \ntranscripts of the bond hearings of five subclass members. \nBefore  turning  to  the  substantive  issues  raised  by  Petitioners'  motion  for \nclarification, the Court emphasizes the narrow scope ofPetitioners' motion.  Petitioners do \nnot argue that any particular subclass member is entitled to alternative conditions of release \nor a reduction in the amount of bond.  The sole question put to this Court is whether the \nNovember  17,  2017, Decision requires an IJ conducting a Lora-style bond hearing to \nconsider alternative conditions of release and a detainee's ability to pay in setting bond \nafter determining that release of the subclass member is appropriate.  The Court answers \nthat question in the affirmative, and, for the following reasons, the motion to clarify the \npreliminary injunction (Dkt. 67) is granted. \n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 4 of 30\nDISCUSSION \nI.

The Court finds that an \nIJ's consideration of the subclass members'  financial circumstances and alternatives to \ndetention is imperative to the effective enforcement of the injunctive relief set forth in its \nNovember  17,  2017,  Decision.  Indeed,  permitting  the  calculation  of bond  without \nrequiring consideration of the detainee's ability to pay effectively erodes any legitimate \ngovernmental interests justifying continued detention that are set forth  in Zadvydas v. \nDavis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), and Lora v. Shanahan, 804 F.3d 601 (2d Cir. 2015).  In light \nof Petitioners' submissions demonstrating that IJs have not taken these factors into account \n-6 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 7 of 30\nin several of the Lora-style bond hearings conducted after this Court's November 17, 2017, \nDecision (see Dkt. 67-3), this Court is obligated to clarify what it had assumed went part \nand parcel with its original order. \nTherefore,  the  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  Petitioners'  motion  to  clarify \nnotwithstanding Respondents' interlocutory appeal of the November 17, 2017, Decision, \npursuant to its inherent authority to supervise compliance with the injunctive relief granted \ntherein. \nII.  The Issues Raised in Petitioners' Motion are Related to the Claims Asserted in \nthe  Amended  Petition  and  the Motion  for  Preliminary Injunction  and  are \nMeritorious \nPetitioners contend that, although it is not explicitly stated in the Court's November \n17, 2017, Decision, the preliminary injunction requires Us, in setting bond, to consider \nalternative conditions of release as well as the detainee's ability to pay once the IJ has \ndetermined that release is appropriate.  Petitioners ask the Court to clarify as much.  (Dkt. \n67-1  at  12).  Respondents argue that Petitioners are not asking for clarification of the \npreliminary  injunction,  but rather  are  seeking  entirely  new  relief based  on  facts  that \noccurred only after this Court issued the preliminary injunction.  (Dkt. 76 at 9).  According \nto Respondents, Petitioners have raised new claims and facts that are beyond the scope of \nthe amended petition, are outside the requirements of the preliminary injunction, and are \nunrelated to the requirements that the Second Circuit imposed in Lora, the case on which \nthis Court largely based the bond portion of its preliminary injunction decision.  (!d. at 10 ). \nRespondents  further  argue that the  requested relief would not have been available to \nPetitioners even if raised in their motion for a preliminary injunction, because there is no \n-7 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 8 of 30\nrelationship between the injury claimed here and the conduct that gave rise to the petition. \n(!d. at 10-11 ). \nRespondents also argue, in the alternative, that Petitioners' motion for clarification \nfails on the merits because there is no requirement that an IJ consider an asylum-seeker's \nability to pay or alternatives to detention in setting bail.  (!d. at 15-17).  Respondents take \nthe  position that  an  IJ  may consider an  alien's  ability  to  pay,  as  well  as  alternative \nconditions of release, but that there is no  Supreme Court, Second Circuit, or Board of \nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") precedent that requires the IJ to do so.  (!d. at 15).  Because \nthe Court's resolution of that argument is inextricably linked with Respondents' argument \nthat  the  relief requested  in  the  motion  for  clarification  is  outside  the  scope  of the \npreliminary injunction and the amended petition, the Court will address those arguments \ntogether. \nIn  its November  17,  2017, Decision, the Court ordered Respondents to provide \nmembers of the class who have been detained for six months or more with individualized \nbond hearings, in conformance with Lora.  (Dkt. 56 at 66).  The Court found persuasive \nthe  reasoning  of the  majority  of the  courts  in  this  Circuit,  as  well  as  the  reasoning \narticulated by the Ninth Circuit in Rodriguez v.  Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127 (9th Cir. 2013) \n(\"Rodriguez IF'), and Rodriguez v.  Robbins, 804 F.3d 1060 (9th Cir. 2015) (\"Rodriguez \nIIF').  (!d. at 30).  That case law recognizes that prolonged detention is permissible only \nwhen  it  serves  legitimate  governmental  interests.  The  failure  to  consider alternative \nconditions of release  and  ability to  pay undermines the  connection between the bond \namount  and  the  legitimate  governmental  interests  that  might  weigh  against  release. \n- 8 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 9 of 30\nAccordingly,  for  the  following  reasons,  the  Court now  concludes  that  implicit  in  its \nNovember 17, 2017, Decision is a requirement that once an IJ has determined that release \nis appropriate and bond should be set, the IJ must consider the detainee's ability to pay, as \nwell as alternative conditions of release, in setting the amount of bond.  Thus, Petitioners' \nmotion to clarify does not raise new claims and facts beyond the scope of the amended \npetition. \nIn Lora, the  Second Circuit held that, \"in order to avoid serious constitutional \nconcerns raised  by  indefinite  detention,  an  immigrant detained pursuant to  [8  U.S.C. \n§ 1226(c)] must be afforded a bail hearing before an immigration judge within six months \nof his or her detention.\"  804 F.3d at 616.  The court quoted Justice Kennedy's concurrence \nin Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 532-33 (2003), which observed that, \"[w]ere there to be \nan  unreasonable  delay  by  the  [government]  in  pursuing  and  completing  deportation \nproceedings, it could become necessary then to inquire whether the detention is not to \nfacilitate deportation, or to protect against risk of flight or dangerousness, but to incarcerate \nfor other reasons.\"  Lora, 804 F.3d at 613 (alteration in original).  After Lora, the majority \nof district courts in this Circuit, including this Court, determined that prolonged detention \nof an asylum-seeker held under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b) raises similar concerns and therefore \ninterpreted Lora to extend to cases pertaining to the detention of asylum-seekers held under \nthat statute.  (See Dkt. 56 at 27-28 (gathering cases)). \nThe court in Lora did not address the question of whether an IJ, in setting bond, \nmust consider a detainee's ability to pay, arid neither did most of the district courts that \nsubsequently relied on Lora.  However, a district judge in the Southern District of New \n- 9 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 10 of 30\nYork answered that question in a ruling from the bench, interpreting Lora to require that \n\"an immigration judge ... consider a detainee's financial circumstances in setting bail.\" \nTranscript of Oral Argument at 8, Celestin v.  Decker,  17 Civ. 2419 (S.D.N.Y. June 14, \n20 17).  The Celestin court reasoned that \"setting bond in an amount a person cannot pay \nwould essentially be a denial of bond,\" and \"[d]enial of bond not due to evidence that the \nimmigrant poses a risk of flight or a risk of danger to the community contravenes the \nmandates and the logic of Lora . ...\"   !d.; see also Leslie v.

Supp.  2d 242, 251  (N.D.N.Y.  2008) (bail not excessive where \namount was set at $400 and the plaintiff was able to secure release on bail on day of arrest). \nIn reaching its conclusion, the court in Celestin cited the Ninth Circuit's decision in \nRodriguez III.  Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, Celestin, 17 Civ. 2419.  In that case, the \nNinth Circuit considered whether the district court had erroneously held-in its order \nentering a permanent injunction-that immigration judges must consider alternatives to \ndetention in setting the amount of bond.  Rodriguez III,  804 F .2d at  1087.  The court \naffirmed the permanent injunction and stated that the immigration judge \"must decide \nwhether any  restrictions short of detention would further the  government's interest in \ncontinued detention.\" !d. at 1088. \nMore recently, in Hernandez v.  Sessions, 872 F.3d 976 (9th Cir. 2017), decided in \nOctober  2017,  the  government  appealed  the  district  court's  grant  of a  preliminary \ninjunction against the government's policy of failing to consider a detainee's financial \ncircumstances in setting the amount of a bond or non-monetary alternative conditions of \nrelease.  !d.  at 982.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, explaining that the detainees had been \ndetermined to be \"neither dangerous nor so great a flight risk as to require detention without \nbond,\" and held that, under those circumstances, \"consideration of the detainees' financial \n- 11 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 12 of 30\ncircumstances, as well as of possible alternative release conditions,\" is \"necessary to ensure \nthat the conditions of their release will be reasonably related to the governmental interest \nin ensuring their appearance at future hearings.\"  !d. at 990-91.  The court acknowledged \nthe  government's  \"legitimate  interests  in  protecting  the  public  and  in  ensuring  that \nnoncitizens in removal proceedings appear for hearings\" but cautioned that \"any detention \nincidental to removal must 'bear[] [a] reasonable relation to [its] purpose.\"'  !d. at 990 \n(quoting Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690).  The court then made the following observation: \nSince the government's purpose in conditioning release on the posting of a \nbond  in  a certain  amount  is  \"to provide  enough  incentive\"  for  released \ndetainees to appear in the future, we cannot understand why it would ever \nrefuse  to  consider  financial  circumstances:  the  amount  of bond  that  is \nreasonably likely to secure the appearance of an indigent person obviously \ndiffers from the amount that is reasonably likely to secure a wealthy person's \nappearance. \n!d. at 991. \nRespondents argue that Hernandez is distinguishable because that case involved a \nclass of aliens detained under§ 1226(a).2  (See Dkt. 76 at 16-17 n.6).  In Lora, the Second \nCircuit interpreted a different statute-§ 1226(c)-to contain an implicit time restriction \nof six months, after which an alien detained under that provision is entitled to a bond \n2  Section 1226 \"regulates the detention of aliens who are facing removal due to past \ncriminal convictions. Generally, immigration detention is authorized by § 1226(a), which \nprovides for individualized review of detention decisions.  Aliens  detained pursuant to \n§ 1226(a) may be released on bond or conditional parole while their immigration case is \n* \nresolved.\"  Figueroa v.  Aviles, No.  14  Civ.  9360(AT)(HBP), 2015  WL 464168, at  1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2015); see Guerra v.  Shanahan, 831  F.3d 59, 62 (2d Cir. 2016) (\"8 \nU.S.C. § 1226(a) authorizes the detention of an alien 'pending a decision on whether the \nalien is to be removed from the United States'; under this section, ICE may detain an alien \nor release him subject to parole or a bond. If ICE elects to detain the alien, the alien may \nrequest a bond hearing before an IJ.\" (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1236.1(d)(l))). \n- 12-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 13 of 30\nhearing,  \"in order to  avoid the constitutional concerns raised by indefinite detention.\" \nLora, 804 F.3d at 616.  Unlike Lora, the holding in Hernandez is based directly on the \ndictates of due process rather than the constitutional avoidance doctrine.  See Hernandez, \n872  F.3d  at  982  n.4  (\"The  §  1226(a)  claim  is  presented  exclusively  in  terms  of \nconstitutional avoidance, a doctrine which is inapplicable here.\"). \nAs this Court noted in its November 17, 2017, Decision, the constitutional rights of \nthe asylum-seekers at issue in the instant matter are limited.  (Dkt. 56 at 66); see Landon v. \nPlasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982); Correa v.  Thornburgh, 901  F.2d 1166, 1171 n.5 (2d \nCir.  1990).  However, the Court also determined that because both non-resident arriving \naliens  and lawful permanent residents (\"LPRs\") can be detained under §  1225(b), the \nconstitutional avoidance doctrine requires Lora-style bond hearings for aliens detained \nunder §  1225(b) in  order to  avoid \"serious constitutional concerns.\"  (Dkt.  56  at 63 ). \nAccordingly,  Respondents'  argument  that  Hernandez  is  distinguishable  because  it \naddressed a class of aliens detained under §  1226(a) is  inconsistent with this  Court's \ndetermination  in  its  November  17,  20 17 ,  Decision.  The  same  due  process  concerns \nimplicated by a detainee's prolonged detention under§ 1226(a) are also raised by an LPR's \nprolonged  detention under  §  1225(b).  See  Nguti v.  Sessions,  259  F.  Supp.  3d 6,  14 \n(W.D.N.Y.  2017)  (applying Lora to  §  1226(a) and relying on  decisions  applying the \nconstitutional avoidance doctrine to extend Lora to detention pursuant to  § 1225(b) to \n\"confirm th[e c]ourt's conclusions\"), appeal withdrawn, No. 17-2086, 2018 WL 286590 \n(2d Cir. Jan. 3, 2018); see also Brevi/ v. Jones, No. 17 Civ. 1529 (LTS) (GWG), 2018 WL \n514670, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.

By \nextension, in clarifying its original preliminary injunction order, the Court finds that the \nconstitutional avoidance doctrine mandates that the Court construe§ 1225(b) in a similar \nmanner here.  In other words, the Court clarifies the November 17, 2017, Decision to \n\"avoid\" the due process concerns discussed in Hernandez, which are equally applicable to \ndetentions pursuant to§ 1225(b). \nNext, Respondents contend that this Court should not require Us to consider ability \nto pay and alternative conditions of release because Us have significant discretion in setting \nbond.  They primarily cite to BIA cases to support their position.  In Matter of Guerra, 24 \nI. & N. Dec. 37, 40 (BIA 2006)-the leading BIA case on this issue-the BIA explained \nthat \"[a]n Immigration Judge has broad discretion in deciding the factors that he or she may \nconsider in custody redeterminations.\" See also 8 C.P.R.§ 1003.19(d) (\"The determination \nof the Immigration Judge as to custody status or bond may be based upon any information \nthat is available to the Immigration Judge or that is presented to him or her by the alien or \n[ICE].\").  Those factors \"may include any or all ofthe following\": \n(1) whether the alien has a fixed address in the United States; (2) the alien's \nlength of residence in the United States; (3) the alien's family ties in the \nUnited States, and whether they may entitle the alien to reside permanently \nin the United States in the future; ( 4) the alien's employment history; ( 5) the \nalien's  record  of appearance  in  court;  (6)  the  alien's  criminal  record, \nincluding the extensiveness of criminal activity, the recency of such activity, \nand the seriousness of the offenses; (7) the alien's history of immigration \nviolations; (8) any attempts by the alien to flee prosecution or otherwise \n- 14-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 15 of 30\nescape from authorities; and (9) the alien's manner of entry to the United \nStates. \nGuerra, 24 I. & N.

In Guerra, the BIA concluded that it was reasonable for the \nIJ to deny bond on the basis that evidence of the individual's serious criminal activity, \nalthough it had not resulted in a conviction, outweighed other factors.  Id. \nHowever, read in their entirety, the BIA cases cited by Respondents support the \nnotion that IJ s should consider ability to pay and alternative conditions of release in setting \nbond.  Although the BIA certainly has not required IJs to consider ability to pay (see \nadministrative exhaustion section, below), based on its discussion of the factors that IJs \nshould consider, coupled with the Second Circuit's decision in Lora, the Court concludes \nthat it is reasonable to hold that IJ s must consider the detainee's financial situation in setting \nbond. \nIn Guerra, the BIA explained that \"Immigration Judges may look to a number of \nfactors in determining whether an alien merits release from bond, as well as the amount of \nbond that is appropriate.\" ld. (emphasis added).  In Matter of Urena, 25 I. & N. Dec. 140 \n(BIA 2009), the BIA explained that the \"setting of bond is designed to ensure an alien's \npresence at proceedings.\" Id. at 141.  Once the detainee has established that he \"would not \npose a danger to property or persons,\" the IJ \"decide[ s] the amount of bond necessary to \nensure the [individual's] presence at proceedings\" in the future.  Jd. at 141-42. Those cases \nsuggest  that  IJ s  have  significant  discretion  to  determine  whether release  on  bond  is \nappropriate.  Once such a determination is made, the IJ's next task is to set bond in an \n- 15 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 16 of 30\namount that is \"appropriate\" and \"necessary\" to effectuate the government's interest in \ndeterring flight while protecting the detainee's liberty interests. \nAlthough most of the factors that IJs consider in making bond determinations are \ndiscretionary, the Court concludes that once an IJ determines that release of the detainee is \nappropriate, an  IJ must consider ability to pay and alternative conditions of release in \nsetting bond for an individual detained under § 1225(b ).  Constitutional concerns compel \nthat conclusion.  As the Ninth Circuit explained in Hernandez, \"[w]hile the temporary \ndetention of non-citizens may sometimes be justified by concerns about public safety or \nflight risk, the government's discretion to incarcerate non-citizens is always constrained by \nthe requirements of due process: no person may be imprisoned merely on account of his \npoverty.\"  872 F.3d at 981.  As  explained above, the constitutional avoidance doctrine \nrequires the Court to reach the same conclusion in the context of the detention of a non \ncitizen asylum-seeker pursuant to § 1225(b ). \nThe cases cited by both Petitioners and Respondents make clear that the purpose of \nbond  is  to  effectuate  the  government's  legitimate  purpose  of ensuring the  detainee's \npresence at future hearings, and that there must be a connection between the bond amount \nand that purpose.  When a judge fails to consider ability to pay and alternative conditions \nof release and sets a bond amount plainly outside the reach of an individual's financial \nresources, such a decision amounts, for all practical purposes, to a denial of bond.  The \nCourt  rejects  Respondents'  argument  that  Petitioners  are  requesting  relief  beyond \nclarification of the preliminary injunction. Petitioners have brought to the Court's attention \nconduct on the part of Respondents that amounts to a denial of bond for reasons estranged \n- 16-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 17 of 30\nfrom the government's interest in mitigating the risk of flight or danger to the community. \nAs the court recognized in Celestin, denial of bond under such circumstances \"contravenes \nthe mandates and the logic of Lora.\"  Transcript of Oral Argument at 8, Celestin, 17 Civ. \n2419.  For the reasons explained above,  an IJ' s failure to consider ability to pay and \nalternative conditions of release in setting bond also raises serious due process concerns. \nThe  Court  concludes  that  a  requirement  that  IJs  consider  ability  to  pay  and \nalternative conditions of release in setting the bond amount is implicit in the November 17, \n2017, Decision.  Because Lora and the Due Process Clause require such considerations, \nPetitioners' motion for clarification does not raise new claims and facts beyond the scope \nof the amended petition and the preliminary injunction. \nII.  Petitioners' Motion is not Barred by 8 U.S.C. § 1226(e), and Petitioners are not \nRequired to Satisfy Administrative Exhaustion Requirements \nA.  Section 1226(e) Does Not Preclude Petitioners' Motion \nRespondents argue that Petitioners' request for clarification is barred by 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1226(e) because \"an immigration judge's bond determination is not subject to judicial \nreview.\"  (Dkt. 76 at 11).  Section 1226(e) provides that \"[n]o court may set aside any \naction or decision by the Attorney General under this section regarding the detention or \nrelease of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole.\"  \"Although 8 \nU.S.C. § 1226(e) bars judicial review of certain 'discretionary judgment[s],' that section \ndoes not deprive the Court of jurisdiction over [a detainee's] constitutional and statutory \nchallenges to his detention.\"  Gordon v. Shanahan, No. 15 CV. 261,2015 WL 1176706, at \n*2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2015); see Bogle v.  DuBois, 236 F. Supp. 3d 820, 822 (S.D.N.Y. \n- 17-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 18 of 30\n2017) (\"If he were merely disputing the IJ's judgment, judicial review would be barred \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1226(e), which provides that the Attorney General's detention decisions \nare not subject to judicial review and may not be set aside by a court.\"). \nRespondents  mischaracterize Petitioners'  request  for  relief.  Petitioners  are  not \nseeking judicial review of the IJs' decisions; rather, Petitioners ask this Court to clarify \nwhether,  per  the  Court's  November  17,  2017,  Decision,  an  IJ,  once  he  or  she  has \ndetermined that release on bond is appropriate, must consider the financial circumstances \nof each subclass member and alternatives to detention in setting the amount of bond.  (See \nDkt.  67-1 ).  In  other words,  the question is  not whether the IJ  could or should have \nconsidered those factors in setting the amount of bond, but whether the IJ must have done \nso  to properly carry  out the Lora-style hearings  required by this  Court's preliminary \ninjunction.  This request does not challenge a \"discretionary judgment\" encompassed by \n§ 1226(e).  Demore,  538  U.S.  at  516.  Rather,  Petitioners  are  either entitled to these \nconsiderations pursuant to this  Court's interpretation of the bond hearing requirement \nimplicit in 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), or they are not.  Since the Court premised its November 17, \n2017, Decision upon the constitutional avoidance doctrine, Petitioners' current motion to \nclarify seeks to vindicate these statutorily-derived process rights, and thus falls outside the \nscope of§ 1226(e). \nAt oral argument, Respondents' counsel represented that the transcripts of the IJ \nbond hearings demonstrated that Petitioners had raised the issues of alternative release \nconditions and ability to pay at the Lora bond hearings, and thus, to the extent the issue \nwas raised, the Court is without jurisdiction to review this application.  Petitioners' counsel \n- 18-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 19 of 30\nresponded that the IJ s presiding over the Lora bond hearings did not inquire into these \nissues, and rejected counsel's attempts to request reconsideration of the bond amount on \nthis ground once the bond amount was set.  (See Dkt. 67-4). \nAs  noted  above,  Respondents  have  filed  transcripts  from  the  Lora-style  bond \nhearings of five  subclass members.  The Court has reviewed those transcripts and has \ndetermined that Petitioners raised the issue of whether the respective subclass members \ncould afford the  bond amount at several of these hearings.  However, the question of \nwhether that issue was \"raised\" is wholly different from the question of whether the IJ gave \nit meaningful consideration.  In setting the bond amount in each case, the IJ made no \nmention of the detainee's ability to pay the bond.  Accordingly, the Court does not find that \nthe  submitted  transcripts  rebut  Petitioners'  contention  that  the  IJs  did  not  consider \nalternative  conditions  of release  or the  subclass  members'  financial  circumstances  in \nsetting the bond amount. \nTherefore, the Court concludes that § 1226(e) does not bar the relief sought by \nPetitioners' motion to clarify. \nB.  Petitioners Were Not Required to Exhaust Administrative Remedies \nRespondents contend that even if§ 1226(e) does not operate as a bar to Petitioners' \nrequest for relief, Petitioners are foreclosed from making this motion because they have \nfailed to exhaust their administrative remedies.  (Dkt. 76 at 12-15).  In reply, Petitioners \nargue that the doctrine of administrative exhaustion is not applicable to their motion for \nclarification, and, even if it were, any failure to exhaust administrative remedies should be \n- 19-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 20 of 30\nexcused because exhaustion would have been futile.  (Dkt. 78 at 10 -12).  The Court agrees \nwith Petitioners in both respects. \n1.  Petitioners' Request for Clarification is Appropriately Before \nthis Court in the First Instance \nPetitioners' reply papers rely upon the recent decision in Enoh v. Sessions, No. 16-\nCV-85(LJV), 2017 WL 2080278 (W.D.N.Y. May 15, 2017), appeal withdrawn, No. 17-\n1236, 2017 WL 6947858 (2d Cir. Dec. 7, 2017), in which the district court had previously \nissued  a  \"conditional  order\"  upon  the  petitioner's  habeas  petition  requiring  \"the \ngovernment to comply with certain conditions, including providing the petitioner with a \nLora bond hearing ....\"   !d. at *2.  After a bond hearing was held-and the petitioner was \ndenied bond-he returned to federal court, claiming that the IJ had applied the wrong legal \nstandard of proof during the hearing.  !d. at * 1.  Ultimately, the district court reached the \nmerits  of the  petitioner's claim,  concluding that \"the IJ failed  to  apply the  clear and \nconvincing standard.\" !d. at * 10.  The district court also concluded that the petitioner was \nnot required to exhaust his administrative remedies.  Although the petitioner had appealed \nhis  denial  of release  on  bond  to  the  BIA,  the  court  recognized  that the  petitioner's \napplication challenged the government's compliance with the prior conditional writ order, \nwhich did not raise any new claim in federal court.  !d. at *3.  As the district court aptly \nstated, \"if exhaustion or a new petition were required simply to challenge compliance with \nan order requiring a Lora bond hearing, it would result in the very harm that Lora should \nprevent:  'prolonged'  detention  without  due  process  during  lengthy  and  backlogged \nremoval proceedings.\"  !d.; see Argueta Anariba v.  Shanahan, No.  16-CV-1928 (KBF), \n-20-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 21 of 30\n2017  WL  3172765,  at  *4  n.3  (S.D.N.Y.  July  26,  2017)  (stating  that  exhaustion  of \nadministrative remedies was not required where the petitioner challenged the adequacy of \nthe Lora bond hearing that had been previously ordered by the court). \nThe Court finds the Enoh court's rationale equally applicable to the instant matter. \nHere, as already noted above, Petitioners' motion does not raise any new claim for relief. \nPetitioners have merely challenged Respondents' compliance with this Court's November \n17, 20 17 , Decision by requesting explicit clarification of its scope and effect.  Without \nquestion, this Court has jurisdiction to clarify its own orders.  See Meinhold, 34 F .3d at \n1480 n.l4; Wash. Metro. Area Transit Comm 'n, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 29; see also Sys. Fed'n \nNo.  91,  Ry.  Emp.  Dep't, AFL-C/0, 364 U.S. at 647; Cullman  Ventures,  Inc.,  1989 WL \n94902, at *3.  Requiring Petitioners to appeal a bond determination to the BIA in order to \nargue that the IJ misinterpreted the scope and effect of this Court's own November 17, \n20 17 , Decision would not serve any of the purposes of administrative exhaustion.  See \nBeharry v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 51, 62 (2d Cir. 2003), as amended (July 24, 2003) (noting \nthat the purposes of the \"judicial exhaustion doctrine ... include protecting the authority \nof administrative agencies, limiting interference in agency affairs, developing the factual \nrecord to make judicial review more efficient, and resolving issues to render judicial review \nunnecessary\").  Indeed, it would be fair to conclude that such a requirement would only \nserve to undermine the principles of due process outlined in Lora, see Enoh, 2017 WL \n2080278, at *3-the very same conceptual underpinnings that form the foundation of this \nCourt's November 17, 2017, Decision. \n- 21 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 22 of 30\nTherefore,  because  Petitioners  do  not  ratse  any  new  claims  in  this  action, \nadministrative  exhaustion  is  not  required  before  this  Court  can  entertain  a  motion \nrequesting that it clarify its own prior grant of injunctive relief. \n2.  In the Alternative, Administrative Exhaustion is Excused Due to \nFutility \n\"There is no statutory requirement of administrative exhaustion before immigration \ndetention may be challenged in federal court by a writ of habeas corpus; however, such \nexhaustion is generally required as a prudential matter.\"  Paz Nativi v. Shanahan, No. 16-\nCV-8496 (JPO), 2017 WL 281751, at* 1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2017) (citing Araujo-Cortes \nv. Shanahan, 35 F. Supp. 3d 533, 538 (S.D.N.Y. 2014)); see 8 C.F.R. § 1236.1(d)(3) (\"An \nappeal  relating  to  bond  and  custody  determinations  may  be  filed  to  the  Board  of \nImmigration Appeals ....\" ).  Where,  as  here, \"an exhaustion requirement is judicially \nimposed instead of statutorily imposed, a number of exceptions apply that allow courts to \nexcuse a party?s failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\"  Beharry, 329 F.3d at 62. \nExemption from  prudential administrative exhaustion requirements  is  permitted where \n\"'(1) available remedies provide no genuine opportunity for adequate relief; (2) irreparable \ninjury may occur without immediate judicial relief; (3) administrative appeal would be \nfutile;  and  (4 )  in  certain  instances  a  plaintiff has  raised  a  substantial  constitutional \nquestion.\"' !d. (quoting Able v.  United States, 88 F.3d 1280, 1288 (2d Cir. 1996)). \nIndeed,  \"courts  may  waive  a judicially  created  exhaustion  requirement  where \npursuing administrative remedies would be futile or where the agency has predetermined \nthe issue before it.\"  Araujo-Cortes, 35 F. Supp. 3d at 538; see Cave v. E. Meadow Union \n-22-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 23 of 30\nFree Sch. Dist., 514 F .3d 240, 249 (2d Cir. 2008) (\"The exhaustion requirement is excused \nwhen exhaustion would be futile because the administrative procedures do not provide an \nadequate remedy.\").  Where the pursuit of \"available administrative remedies would be \nfutile, the purposes behind the requirement of exhaustion are no longer served, and thus a \ncourt will release the [petitioner] from the requirement.\"  Kennedy v.  Empire Blue Cross \n& Blue Shield, 989 F.2d 588, 594 (2d Cir. 1993). \nThe Court finds that even if Petitioners were required to exhaust their administrative \nremedies, their failure to do so is excused because exhaustion would be futile.  The Ninth \nCircuit was recently faced with the same question in Hernandez.  In that case, the court \ndetermined that the BIA had previously held that a detainee's ability to pay the bond \namount was not relevant to the bond calculation.  Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 989.  Based on \na review of several BIA decisions, this Court agrees that the BIA has predetermined that a \ndetainee's financial circumstances is not a required consideration when setting the bond \namount.  See In Re: Manuel Balbuena Rivera A.K.A. Manuel Rivera-Balbuena, A091 878 \n213,2010 WL 691275, at *1 (BIA Feb. 16, 2010) (\"[T]he test for determining the proper \nbond amount is not whether the respondent is  financially capable of posting bond, but \nwhether the amount of bond is reasonably calculated to assure his appearance for future \nproceedings or, if necessary, for removal.\"); In re Castillo-Cajura, A089 853 733, 2009 \nWL 3063742, at *1 (BIA Sept. 10, 2009) (\"[A]n alien's ability to pay the bond amount is \nnot a relevant bond determination factor.\"); In Re: Mario Sandoval-Gomez, A092 563 965, \n2008 WL 5477710, at *1 (BIA Dec. 15, 2008) (same).  Moreover, Hernandez also notes \nthat another recent unpublished BIA decision indicates that '\"an Immigration Judge is not \n- 23-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 24 of 30\nrequired to consider an alien's ability to pay when setting a bond.\"'  Hernandez, 872 F.3d \nat 1003 n.15; see Araujo-Cortes, 35 F. Supp. 3d at 538 (finding that an appeal to the BIA \nwould have been futile where the BIA had rejected the petitioner's arguments in prior \ncases); Sulayao v. Shanahan, No. 09 Civ.7347(PKC), 2009 WL 3003188, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. \nSept.  15, 2009) (\"Appealing this decision to the BIA would be futile because the BIA \nrecently  reaffirmed  the  interpretation  of section  1226( c)  which  subjects  aliens  like \npetitioner to mandatory detention.\"); see also Rivera v. Holder, 307 F .R.D. 539, 552 (W.D. \nWash. 2015) (finding that \"[o]ther courts have found unpublished BIA holdings highly \nprobative of whether the Board has come to a decision on an issue\"). \nThe Court recognizes that the district court in Paz Nativi v. Shanahan, No. 16-CV-\n8496 (JPO), 2017 WL 281751 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2017), reached the opposite conclusion. \nIn that case, the petitioner also argued that the exhaustion of administrative remedies would \nbe  futile,  citing  \"several  BIA  decisions  rejecting  the  relevance  of  ability-to-pay \nconsiderations  in  bond  determinations.\"  !d.  at  *2.  However,  the  district  court  was \npersuaded by the respondents' citation to \"multiple cases in which the BIA has reduced \nbond amounts on appeal,\" and the fact that the factors used in calculating bond amounts \nare \"nonexclusive\"; thus, the \"ability to pay\" could be reviewed by the BIA in determining \nwhether  bond  is  excessive.  !d.  However,  Paz  Nativi  is  distinguishable  from  the \ncircumstances of the present action. \nUnlike  Paz Nativi,  where the  court ruled  directly  upon the petitioner's habeas \npetition and request for  injunctive relief, the unique procedural posture of Petitioners' \nmotion undermines the necessity of prudential administrative exhaustion. Here, Petitioners \n-24-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 25 of 30\nseek clarification of an existing preliminary injunction order issued by this Court.  (Dkt. \n67).  It would be counterintuitive to require Petitioners to appeal a bond determination to \nthe BIA in order to argue, in the first instance, that the IJ misinterpreted the scope and \neffect  of this  Court's  own November  17,  2017,  Decision.  As  stated  above,  such  a \nrequirement would not serve any of the purposes of prudential exhaustion. \nIn addition, the Paz Nativi decision indicates that \"the immigration judge relied on \nthe bond determination factors outlined in [Guerra];  she did not take into account [the \npetitioner]'s ability to pay.\" Paz Nativi, 2017 WL 281751, at* 1.  Nowhere in that decision \ndoes the court mention the mandates set forth in Lora.  As noted above, Guerra appears to \nbe the leading BIA decision relating to bond calculations.  However, while the Guerra \nfactors  may  be  sufficiently  broad  to  permit  the  IJ's  consideration  of alternatives  to \ndetention and a detainee's ability to pay, the case law certainly does not require the IJ to \nconsider those factors.  See Guerra, 24 I. & N. Dec. at 40.  Instead, the Guerra standard \nsimply sets forth nine factors that, in the IJ's \"broad discretion,\" may or may not receive \nconsideration in any given instance.  See id.; see also Hernandez v. Lynch, No. EDCV 16-\n00620-JGB (KKx), 2016 WL 7116611, at *29 n.16 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 10, 2016) (\"[E]ven if \nthe  ability  to  pay  is  a  discretionary  factor  Immigration  Judges  may  consider  when \ndetermining bond[,] ... this is irrelevant to [the p]laintiffs' contention that both the ability \nto pay and alternatives to detention must be considered in bond determinations.\"), aff'd sub \nnom.  Hernandez v.  Sessions, 872 F.3d 976 (9th Cir. 2017) (emphasis in original).  The \nissue presented by Petitioners' motion is whether Respondents were obligated to take such \nconsiderations into account in setting bond during a Lora-style hearing. \n- 25-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 26 of 30\nFurthermore, to the extent that the Paz Nativi court reasoned that the BIA \"could \nconsider the ability-to-pay issue more broadly\" or \"could consider ability to pay as a factor \nin  bond  determinations\"  under  the  Guerra  standard,  the  BIA  decisions  cited  above \ndemonstrate that Guerra has not yet been construed so expansively.  See Hernandez, 872 \nF.3d at 1003 n.15 (rejecting \"the government's contention that the cases cited above do not \nreflect current policy as well as its speculation that the BIA 'may decide to further clarify \nthe Guerra standard\"'). In addition, the cases cited by Respondents for the proposition that \nthe BIA may reduce the amount set for bond do not suggest that the BIA considers a \ndetainee's financial circumstances as a relevant factor; rather, they merely reiterate that the \n\"amount of bond should be reasonably calculated to insure an alien's presence at future \nproceedings.\"  In  Re:  Jesus  Gomez A.K.A.  Carlos Alvarez, A095  811  474, 2010  WL \n1607087, at * 1 (BIA Mar. 23, 201 0) (noting also that bond calculations \"should not be used \nas a punitive measure\"); In Re: Garaycochea, Javier Santiago, A79-616-114, 2006 WL \n901383, at* 1 (BIA Feb. 22, 2006) (\"[A] bond is set by an immigration judge according to \nthe assessment of the amount needed to motivate the respondent to appear in light of \nrelevant considerations.\"); In Re: Mahmoud Mohamed Harkous, A 77 070 695, 2004 WL \n2943563, at* 1 (BIA Nov. 2, 2004) (reducing the bond as generally excessive \"[g]iven the \nrespondent's lack of danger to the community and the lack of flight risk\").3 \n3  Respondents  do  not  specifically  contend  that  Petitioners'  argument  for  the \nmandatory consideration of alternative conditions of release should also have been made, \nin the first instance, in an appeal before the BIA.  However, Respondents take the position \nthat IJs \"are not required to consider ... alternatives to detention when setting bail\" as well \nas a detainee's \"ability to pay.\"  (Dkt. 76 at 17 (citing In Re: Luis Navarro-Solajo A.K.A. \nLuis Solajo-Navarro A.K.A.

Barrios Ramos is Not Precluded From Seeking Clarification of the Court's \nOriginal Order Under Standing Principles \nRespondents argue that Barrios Ramos does not have standing to assert the \"new \nclaims\" set forth in Petitioners' motion because he \"has not had a bond hearing\" and thus, \n\"he cannot claim to have suffered the injury that supports Petitioners' new question for \nrelief.\"  (Dkt. 76 at 18).  Respondents also argue that Barrios Ramos never had a \"personal \ninterest\" in these \"new claims,\" and thus, the \"voluntary cessation exception and inherently \ntransitory exceptions to the mootness doctrine\" are inapplicable.  (!d.  at 18 n. 7). \nTo establish standing under Article III of the United States Constitution, \"a plaintiff \nmust, generally speaking, demonstrate that he has suffered 'injury in fact,' that the injury \nis  'fairly traceable'  to  the actions  of the defendant,  and that the  injury will  likely be \nredressed by a favorable decision.\"  Bennett v.  Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997) (quoting \nLujan v.  Deft. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)).  \"The Second Circuit has stated \nthat to determine whether a party has standing, the court  'must look to the  facts  and \ncircumstances as they existed at the time [the] suit was initiated.\"'  Digizip.com, Inc.  v. \n* 1  n.2  (BIA  Apr.  13,  2011))).  Therefore,  it  appears  that  an  administrative  appeal \ncontending that alternative conditions of release must have been considered in setting bond \nwould  have  been  futile  as  well.  See  Hernandez,  2016  WL  7116611,  at  *29  n.16. \nFurthermore, for the same reasons stated above regarding the subclass members' ability to \npay, requiring Petitioners' request for clarification of this Court's own November 17,2017, \nDecision to be heard before the BIA in the first instance fails to serve any ofthe principles \nunderlying the application of prudential exhaustion.  See Be harry, 329 F .3d at 62. \n-27-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 28 of 30\nVerizon Servs. Corp., 139 F. Supp. 3d 670, 675 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Etuk v. Slattery, \n936 F.2d 1433, 1440-41 (2d Cir. 1991)); see Friends ofthe Earth, Inc.  v.  Laidlaw Envtl. \nServs.  (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (standing \"must exist at the commencement \nof the litigation\").  The principles of mootness and standing both arise from the \"case or \ncontroversy\" requirement of Article III.  Etuk, 936 F.2d at 1441.  \"While standing focuses \non the status of the parties when an action is commenced, the mootness doctrine requires \nthat the plaintiffs' claims remain alive throughout the course of the proceedings.\" !d. \nRespondents' standing argument rests upon an erroneous premise: that Petitioners' \nmotion raises \"new claims\" separate and apart from those asserted in the amended petition \nor the motion for preliminary injunction.  (Dkt. 76 at 18).  As already noted, Petitioners do \nnot make any new or unrelated requests for relief.  At the time this action was commenced, \nBarrios Ramos had passed a credible fear interview and had been detained for over six \nmonths.  (Dkt.  17-1  at 2).  As such, the fact that Barrios Ramos has since been released \nfrom custody \"has no impact on his standing to seek injunctive relief.\"  See Hernandez, \n2016 WL 7116611, at* 12; Clarkson v. Coughlin, 783 F. Supp. 789, 794 & n.5 (S.D.N.Y. \n1992) (noting \"no dispute\" as to whether standing was established at the commencement \nof the action where the plaintiff was incarcerated at the time she filed her class action \ncomplaint, and was then paroled); see also Maphorisa v. Dist. Dir., ICE, No. CIV. 3:CV-\n09-0298, 2010 WL 598451, at *2 (M.D. Pa. Feb. 17, 2010) (\"When a habeas petitioner has \nbeen released from custody after filing a petition, the relevant inquiry becomes whether the \ncase  still  presents  a  case  or  controversy  under Article  III,  § 2  of the  United  States \nConstitution.\" (citing Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 7 (1998))). \n-28-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 29 of 30\nTherefore, the Court concludes that Article III standing principles do not preclude \nBarrios Ramos from asserting the relief sought by Petitioners' motion to clarify. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Petitioners' motion for clarification (Dkt. 67) is granted. \nThe Court clarifies that the November 17, 2017, Decision requires that once an IJ has \ndetermined that a detainee should be released on bond, he or she must consider the financial \ncircumstances of each subclass member and alternative conditions of release in setting the \namount of bond.  Accordingly, \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that for all subclass members provided a bond hearing \npursuant to this Court's November 17, 2017, Decision, the IJ, when setting the terms of \nany subclass member's release at a bond hearing, must consider alternative conditions of \nrelease and the individual's ability to pay; and it is further \nORDERED, that for those subclass members who have already received a bond \nhearing  pursuant  to  the  November  17,  2017,  Decision,  and  who  remain  detained \nnotwithstanding an IJ' s determination that release on bond would be appropriate, bond \nhearings must be recalendared and the record reopened for the IJ to consider alternative \nconditions of release and the individual's ability to pay; and it is further \nORDERED, that counsel for Respondents shall notify Class Counsel of the date and \nlocation of each bond hearing set pursuant to this Decision and Order at least five days in \nadvance of the hearing. \n-29-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 83   Filed 02/09/18   Page 30 of 30\nSO ORDERED. \nDated: February 9, 2018 \nRochester, New York \n- 30-",

FIRST AMENDED PETITION \n  FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS \nELAINE DUKE, in her official capacity as  CORPUS AND COMPLAINT \nActing Secretary of U.S. Department of  FOR DECLARATORY AND \nHomeland Security; THOMAS BROPHY, in his  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nofficial capacity as Acting Director of Buffalo   \nField Office of Immigration and Customs   \nEnforcement; JEFFREY SEARLS, in his official  CLASS ACTION \ncapacity as Acting Administrator of the Buffalo \nFederal Detention Facility, and JEFFERSON \nSESSIONS, in his official capacity as Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, \n \n                                     Respondents. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This class action challenges the power of the federal government to deny parole \nsummarily to arriving asylum-seekers and incarcerate them for prolonged periods even \nthough the Government itself has determined they are likely to win the right to remain in \nthe United States. In a case pending before the United States Supreme Court, the \nGovernment has represented—in arguing that immigrant detainees need not be given \nbond hearings to test the validity of their detention—that asylum-seekers have ready \naccess to release on parole. But that representation cannot be squared with the experience \nof the petitioners and the proposed class members in this case—asylum-seekers who \ndeclared themselves at our nation’s borders, whose claims of persecution or torture were \nfound credible, but who have nevertheless been detained without parole at the Buffalo \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 2 of 25\n \nFederal Detention Facility in Batavia as the Government processes their asylum claims \nover many months and, in some cases, years.      \n2.  Petitioners Barrios Ramos and Abdi were detained for many months from the \nmoment they arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border and sought asylum in the United States. \nMr. Barrios Ramos, a political prisoner who fled Cuba to avoid further detention, and Mr. \nAbdi, who fled persecution and torture in Somalia on account of his membership in a \nminority tribe, each passed an initial screening known as a “credible fear interview,” \nwhere the Government found that each man had established a significant possibility of \nbeing granted asylum. Despite passing that interview, each was then subject to prolonged \ndetention as his immigration case slowly ground on, during which time his repeated \nrequests for parole were denied without explanation. Mr. Abdi spent over ten months in \nICE custody; Mr. Barrios Ramos, who has been incarcerated for over seven months, has \nno realistic possibility of release in the near future, as his next immigration court date is \nonly scheduled for the end of November.  \n3.  This prolonged and arbitrary detention of the named petitioners reflects a broader \npractice at Batavia, where ICE has abandoned its long-standing policy favoring the \nrelease of asylum-seekers. Although the Government is still touting that policy to the \nSupreme Court, the detention of asylum-seekers without the possibility of release on \nparole is the new norm at Batavia. So whereas approximately 88% of parole requests \nmade by people who passed a credible fear interview were granted during the first nine \nmonths of 2015 (the most recent period for which data are available), only 8% of such \nrequests appear to have been granted from the beginning of 2017 until the filing of this \nlawsuit on July 28, 2017.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 3 of 25\n \n4.  The respondents’ actions violate federal statutes, regulations, directives, and the \nUnited States Constitution and are severely harming those being held at Batavia. Mr. \nBarrios Ramos and the proposed class of arriving asylum-seekers detained at Batavia \nwho have not been granted parole seek adjudication or readjudication of their parole \nrequests in accordance with the procedures and criteria contained in the ICE parole \ndirective that the Government has repeatedly claimed to be following. In addition, Mr. \nBarrios Ramos and a sub-class of asylum-seekers whose detention exceeds, or will \nexceed, six months seek a bond hearing before an immigration judge—a form of relief to \nwhich they are entitled under a recent ruling from the Second Circuit. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n5.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion); 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (All Writs Act); 28 U.S.C. § 2201-02 (declaratory \njudgment); and 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas corpus).  \n6.  Venue is proper in the Western District of New York under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \nbecause a substantial part of the events giving rise to these claims occurred in this district. \nVenue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 2241(d) because all potential class members are \nincarcerated within this District.   \nPARTIES \n7.  Petitioner Johan Barrios Ramos is a forty-year-old Cuban national seeking asylum \nin the United States. He has now spent more than seven months in ICE custody and is \ncurrently incarcerated at Batavia. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 4 of 25\n \n8.  Petitioner Hanad Abdi is a twenty-six-year-old Somali national seeking asylum in \nthe United States. He spent more than ten months in ICE custody before he was \nconditionally released on August 16, 2017, three weeks after this lawsuit was filed.   \n9.  Respondent Elaine Duke is sued in her official capacity as Acting Secretary of the \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security, the agency directly responsible for the \npetitioners’ detention. \n10.   Respondent Thomas Brophy is sued in his official capacity as Acting Field \nOffice Director for the Buffalo District of ICE. Mr. Brophy has the authority to \nadjudicate parole for detainees held at Batavia.   \n11.  Respondent Jeffrey Searls is sued in his official capacity as Acting Administrator \nat Batavia. \n12.  Respondent Jefferson B. Sessions is sued in his official capacity as the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. As the head of the Department of Justice, he oversees the \noperation the Executive Office of Immigration Review, which encompasses the \nimmigration courts and Board of Immigration Appeals. Mr. Sessions shares responsibility \nfor the implementation and enforcement of immigration laws along with Acting Secretary \nDuke.    \nFACTS PERTAINING TO INDIVIDUAL PETITIONERS \nA.  Johan Barrios Ramos \n13.  Mr. Barrios Ramos, a native and citizen of Cuba, was born in 1977 in Havana. \nDeclaration of Johan Barrios Ramos (“Barrios Ramos Decl.”) at ¶¶ 1-2. \n14.  Mr. Barrios Ramos became involved with the political opposition in Cuba around \n2010. Id. ¶ 4. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 5 of 25\n \n15.  A few years later, he visited an independent journalist and member of the political \nopposition who was incarcerated by the Cuban authorities. Id. ¶ 5. \n16.  As a result of visiting this political dissident, Mr. Barrios Ramos became known \nto the Cuban government who arrested, interrogated, and incarcerated him on suspicion \nof engaging in “anti-Cuban” activities for approximately eleven months. Id.  \n17.  During his detention, he was held in solitary confinement for several weeks and \nwas sometimes deprived of food. He was also beaten and abused by the prison guards. Id. \n¶ 5. \n18.  After his release from prison, Mr. Barrios Ramos continued his involvement in \npolitical opposition to the Cuban government. Id. ¶ 6. \n19.  As a result the government continued to monitor him and to send its agents to \nharass him. Id. ¶ 7.  \n20.  Afraid for his safety, Mr. Barrios Ramos attempted to leave Cuba on two \noccasions. In both instances, government authorities prevented him from leaving the \ncountry. Id.  \n21.  In late 2016, shortly after Fidel Castro died, the police once again came to Mr. \nBarrios Ramos’s mother’s house looking for him and accusing him of anti-government \nactivities. He was not home at the time. After this incident, his mother told him that he \nshould not come home. Id. ¶ 8.  \n22.   In December 2016, Mr. Barrios Ramos finally succeeded in fleeing Cuba. He left \nbecause he was afraid he would be redetained and tortured. Id. ¶ 8-9.  \n23.  Mr. Barrios Ramos left Cuba on a raft that reached the coast of Mexico. From \nthere, he traveled overland, arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in Roma, Texas, on \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 6 of 25\n \nJanuary 14, 2017. He declared himself at the border post there and requested asylum. Id. \n¶¶ 10, 11.  \n24.  He was transferred to Batavia and given a credible fear interview on February 1, \n2017. The officer who conducted that interview determined there was a significant \npossibility that Mr. Barrios Ramos’s claims would be found credible in a full asylum \nhearing before an immigration judge. The officer also found that there appeared to be no \npotential bars to asylum. Finally, the officer noted that Mr. Barrios Ramos’s identity had \nbeen determined with a reasonable degree of certainty. See Credible Fear Interview of \nJohan Barrios Ramos (dated February 1, 2017) at 3-5, Declaration of Desiree Lurf (“Lurf \nDecl.”), Ex. A. \n25.  On the same day that he passed his credible fear interview, Mr. Barrios Ramos \nwas told by a deportation officer that there is no parole at Batavia. He does not recall \nreceiving any written notification or advisal about parole, nor does he believe anyone at \nBatavia conducted a parole interview for him. Barrios Ramos Decl. ¶¶ 11-12.   \n26.  Mr. Barrios Ramos retained immigration counsel, Desiree Lurf, who has assisted \nhim in preparing for his asylum hearing in immigration court. Id. ¶ 13. \n27.  On February 28, 2017, Ms. Lurf submitted a parole request on his behalf. In \nsupport of this request, she submitted a copy of his birth certificate, declarations from Mr. \nBarrios Ramos’s sister (a lawful permanent resident) and a childhood friend (a U.S. \ncitizen) with whom he would live if released supporting the parole request. Ms. Lurf also \nsubmitted five other letters of support from friends attesting to Mr. Barrios Ramos’s \nidentity and good character. Photo identifications were included for affiants. First Parole \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 7 of 25\n \nRequest for Johan Barrios Ramos with supporting exhibits (dated February 28, 2017), \nLurf Decl. Ex. B. \n28.  On March 6, 2017, Ms. Lurf supplemented the parole request by submitting a \ncopy of Mr. Barrios Ramos’s passport. Updated Parole Request for Johan Barrios Ramos \nwith supporting exhibits (email dated March 6, 2017), Lurf Decl. Ex. C.  \n29.  On March 7, 2017, Ms. Lurf received a two-sentence letter from Acting Field \nOffice Director Brophy denying parole. In its entirety the body of the letter states: “This \nletter is in response to your recent correspondence requesting Parole. After a careful \nreview of the evidence you submitted and the immigration file, your request for Parole is \ndenied.” Ltr. from T. Brophy to D. Lurf (dated March 7, 2017), Lurf Decl. Ex. D. \n30.  On April 24, 2017, Ms. Lurf submitted a second parole request for Mr. Barrios \nRamos. She provided evidence that Mr. Barrios Ramos’s health was deteriorating in \nBatavia. For instance, Mr. Barrios Ramos’s anxiety disorder has been exacerbated \nbecause his detention at Batavia constantly reminds him of the physical and \npsychological torture he suffered while detained in Cuba. Second Parole Request for \nJohan Barrios Ramos with supporting exhibits (dated April 24, 2017), Lurf Decl. Ex. E. \n31.  On May 4, 2017, Ms. Lurf received a two-sentence letter from Acting Field \nOffice Director Brophy denying parole. In its entirety the body of the letter states: “This \nletter is in response to your recent correspondence requesting Parole. After a careful \nreview of the evidence you submitted and the immigration file, your request for Parole is \ndenied.”  Ltr. from T. Brophy to D. Lurf (dated May 4, 2017), Lurf Decl. Ex. F. \n32.  On at least two occasions, Mr. Barrios Ramos asked his deportation officer, \nDeportation Officer (“DO”) Ensminger, why his parole requests were denied. DO \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 8 of 25\n \nEnsminger indicated that parole was no longer available, saying that it was a matter of \nluck and that there was a one-in-a-million chance of anyone at Batavia being granted \nparole. Barrios Ramos Decl. ¶ 15. \n33.  Mr. Barrios Ramos is suffering in detention. His anxiety disorder, which he \ndeveloped while incarcerated in Cuba, is exacerbated during his detention in the United \nStates. Id. ¶ 16. \n34.  Mr. Barrios Ramos was eagerly awaiting his day in immigration court, which was \nscheduled for August 15, 2017. Id. ¶ 17. On that date, the hearing began and Mr. Barrios \nRamos began to testify through a Spanish-language interpreter provided by the court. \nLurf Decl. ¶ 10-11.  \n35.  However, the interpreter, who spoke Mexican Spanish, was unable to fully \nunderstand Mr. Barrios Ramos’s Cuban accent and could not adequately interpret his \ntestimony. Ms. Lurf was forced to ask the court to adjourn the hearing and resume on \nanother date with a different interpreter. Lurf Decl. ¶ 11.    \n36.  She was subsequently informed that the immigration court was rescheduling Mr. \nBarrios Ramos’s asylum hearing for November 29, 2017. Lurf Decl. ¶ 12.  At that point, \nhe will have been detained for eleven months.   \nB.  Hanad Abdi \n37.  Mr. Abdi is a native and citizen of Somalia. He was born in 1991, in Buulo \nMareer, a town about 75 miles south of Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital city. See \nDeclaration of Petitioner Hanad Abdi (“Abdi Decl.”) ¶¶ 1-3.  He and his family belong to \na small minority tribe known as the Tunni. Id. ¶ 5. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 9 of 25\n \n38.  Mr. Abdi lived in Buulo Mareer with his father, mother, and four younger siblings. \nHis mother died during childbirth in 2008. Id. ¶¶ 3-4. \n39.  As the oldest child, Mr. Abdi has had to fill in the void left by his mother’s death \nto take care of his younger siblings. Id. ¶ 4. \n40.  For most of Mr. Abdi’s life, Somalia has been a failed state, mired in civil unrest \nand war. In the absence of a functioning government, tribal conflict, usually motivated by \ncontrol for land and resources, has raged on. \n41.  As members of the Tunni, Mr. Abdi’s family has been targeted and harassed for \ndecades by members of a larger, more powerful tribe, the Habar-gidir. Mr. Abdi was \ntaunted and bullied in school because of his tribal affiliation, and he remembers hearing \nHabar-gidir men harass his mother when he was a child. Id. ¶ 5. \n42.  More recently, members of the Habar-gidir wanted the plot of land that Mr. \nAbdi’s family has owned and farmed for generations. In 2008, Mr. Abdi’s father lost \nabout half of this land to a man from the Habar-gidir tribe, who targeted the family \nbecause they are Tunni. Id. ¶ 6. \n43.  The man who seized the Abdis’ land died in April 2016. The man’s brother, who \nwas the Chief of Police in the section of Buulo Mareer where Mr. Abdi’s family lived \nbelieved that Mr. Abdi’s father had conducted witchcraft that caused his brother’s death. \nId. ¶ 7. \n44.  As an act of vengeance, this Chief of Police shot and killed Mr. Abdi’s father in \nMay 2016. Id. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 10 of 25\n \n45.  Mr. Abdi was attending English classes at the time his father was killed. He came \nhome to see his aunt weeping, and they went to the family farm to collect his father’s \nbody. As the oldest child, Mr. Abdi was responsible for burying his father.  Id. ¶ 8. \n46.  A week later, Mr. Abdi was confronted at his family farm by plain-clothes \npolicemen employed by the man who murdered his father. Id. ¶ 9. \n47.  The men captured Mr. Abdi, tied him up, and severely beat him. He believes they \nwould have killed him had he not been able to escape later that day as his captors got into \na gunfight with a rival group. Amidst the chaos, Mr. Abdi managed to untie himself and \nrun away. He fled into the bushes in the countryside and hid in a ditch in the ground for \nseveral hours. He heard the voices of his captors as they came to the area looking for him. \nHe was terrified. Id. ¶ 10. \n48.  Around midnight, when he was sure his captors were gone, Mr. Abdi walked back \nto his house. There, he met his aunt who told him that his captors had just come to the \nhouse looking for Mr. Abdi and beaten her as they demanded she turn him over. Id. ¶ 11. \n49.  Mr. Abdi was suffering his own physical injuries from earlier in the day. But \nsince the men were still looking for him, he believed he had to leave the area immediately. \nAided by a family friend, he was hidden in the back of a vehicle and taken to Mogadishu. \nId. ¶ 12. \n50.  Some days later, he began to receive threatening phone calls from the men who \nhad captured him telling him they knew where he was and that they planned to kill him. \nId. ¶ 13. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 11 of 25\n \n51.  Mr. Abdi left Somalia on June 10, 2016, shortly after receiving those calls. The \nsame family friend who secured his safe passage to Mogadishu paid smugglers to help \nhim travel overland to Ethiopia and then onwards to Brazil by plane. Id. ¶ 15. \n52.  From Brazil, Mr. Abdi was passed from smuggler to smuggler and crossed \noverland through Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, \nGuatemala, and Mexico, finally arriving at the southern border of the United States. Id. ¶ \n16. \n53.  Mr. Abdi made the perilous journey to the United States because he believed that \nhe could find safety and refuge in this country. Id. ¶ 17. \n54.  Mr. Abdi arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in Brownsville, Texas on October 12, \n2016. He declared himself at the border post there, and requested asylum in this country. \nId. ¶¶ 16-17. \n55.  Mr. Abdi then spent approximately two weeks at a detention center in Texas and \nwas transferred to Batavia on or around October 26, 2016. Id. ¶ 18. \n56.  Mr. Abdi was given a credible fear interview on November 21, 2016. The officer \nwho conducted the interview determined there was a significant possibility that Mr. \nAbdi’s claims would be found credible in a full asylum hearing before an immigration \njudge. The officer also found that there appeared to be no potential bars to asylum. \nFinally, the officer noted that Mr. Abdi’s identity had been determined with a reasonable \ndegree of certainty. See Credible Fear Interview of Hanad Abdi (dated Nov. 23, 2016) at \n3-4, Abdi Decl. Ex. A.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 12 of 25\n \n57.  On December 8, 2016, Mr. Abdi was provided notice that he would have the \nopportunity to present his claim for asylum before an immigration judge. See Notice to \nAppear (dated Nov. 23, 2016, served Dec. 8, 2016), Abdi Decl. Ex. B. \n58.  On December 8, 2016, he also received a form entitled “Parole Advisal and \nScheduling Notification.” The advisal informed him that since he had passed his CFI, \nICE would consider releasing him from custody on parole pending the resolution of his \nimmigration case. The form went on to explain that ICE may grant parole if he \nestablished (1) his identity, (2) that he would appear for future court dates and \nenforcement appointments, and (3) that he was neither a security risk nor danger to the \ncommunity. See Parole Advisal and Scheduling Notification (dated Dec. 8, 2016) at 1-2, \nAbdi Decl. Ex. C. \n59.  Mr. Abdi had a parole interview before his ICE deportation officer, Mitchell \nMuehlig, on December 15, 2016. Abdi Decl. ¶ 25.  \n60.  In support of his application for parole, Mr. Abdi provided a copy of his birth \ncertificate and he collected affidavits and supporting documentation from relatives and a \nfamily friend residing in the U.S. who verified they knew him personally. Id. ¶ 26. \n61.  In a letter dated December 19, 2016, Mr. Abdi received notice that his parole had \nbeen denied because he had failed to establish his identity to ICE’s satisfaction. The form \nhe received, titled “Notification Declining to Grant Parole,” included checkboxes for \nvarious grounds under which ICE may deny parole. In Mr. Abdi’s case, only the “identity” \ncheckboxes were marked. ICE did not check the boxes indicating he was ineligible for \nparole on the grounds that he was a flight risk or danger to the community, nor did it \nmark the boxes for “additional exceptional, overriding factors” related to law \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 13 of 25\n \nenforcement or national security concerns that would warrant a denial of parole. See \nNotification Declining to Grant Parole (dated Dec. 19, 2016) at 1-2, Abdi Decl. Ex. D \n(“Dec. 19 Parole Denial”).   \n62.  Mr. Abdi requested that ICE reconsider its decision. Abdi Decl. ¶ 29. In a letter \ndated January 10, he received another “Notification Declining to Grant Parole” form, also \nindicating that the reason ICE was denying his parole was because he had not established \nhis identity to ICE’s satisfaction. On this form too, ICE did not find Mr. Abdi to be a \nflight risk or danger to the community, or to present “additional exceptional, overriding \nfactors” against granting parole. See Notification Declining to Grant Parole (dated Jan. 10, \n2017) at 1-2, Abdi Decl. Ex. E (“Jan. 10 Parole Denial”).  \n63.  Both parole denial forms that Mr. Abdi received, dated December 19 and January \n10 respectively, indicated that he could request redetermination if he provided additional \ndocuments like “government-issued documents such as passports, birth certificates, or \nidentity cards” to establish his identity. The form also informed Mr. Abdi that his identity \nmay be established “through written statements prepared by individuals whom [he] \nknow[s] in the United States and whose identity ICE can verify to its satisfaction.” See \nDec. 19 Parole Denial at 2; Jan. 10 Parole Denial at 2.  \n64.  Mr. Abdi asked his deportation officer, DO Muehlig, why his parole requests \nwere denied. Officer Muehlig told him it was because he had not submitted photo \nidentification—even though ICE’s own parole guidance and parole denial form makes \nclear there is no requirement that an asylum-seeker provide photo identification. Abdi \nDecl. ¶ 31. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 14 of 25\n \n65.  Mr. Abdi retained Siana McLean as his immigration lawyer on February 28, 2017. \nAbdi Decl. ¶ 32. Ms. McLean has assisted Mr. Abdi in preparing for his asylum hearing \nin immigration court.  \n66.  Ms. McLean renewed Mr. Abdi’s request for release on parole on April 20. \nDeclaration of Siana McLean (“McLean Decl.”) at ¶ 4. Ms. McLean submitted a cover \nletter along with the request and provided documentation directly responsive to ICE’s \nprevious determinations that Mr. Abdi had failed to establish his identity. She submitted a \nSomali government-issued photo identification card for Mr. Abdi along with a certified \nEnglish translation. She also resubmitted an affidavit from Mr. Abdi’s uncle, a lawful \npermanent resident, who welcomed Mr. Abdi to live with him, and affidavits from Mr. \nAbdi’s aunt and family friend. All three affiants provided copies of their U.S.- or state- \nissued government photo-identification, and all three individuals stated they knew Mr. \nAbdi and his family and could confirm his identity. See Immediate Parole Requested for \nHanad Abdi with supporting exhibits (dated April 20, 2017), McLean Decl. Ex. A.  \n67.  In further support of the parole request, Ms. McLean submitted medical records \nfor Mr. Abdi demonstrating the physical and psychological toll that continued detention \nwas taking on him. Id.  \n68.  On May 4, 2017, Ms. McLean received a two-sentence letter from Acting Field \nOffice Director Brophy denying parole. The body of the letter states, in its entirety: “This \nletter is in response to your recent correspondence requesting that your client be released \non parole. After a careful review of the evidence you submitted and the Immigration file, \nyour request for your client’s release is denied.” No reasoning was offered, and no \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 15 of 25\n \nnotification form with checkboxes was provided. Ltr. from T. Brophy to S. McLean \n(dated May 4, 2017), McLean Decl. Ex. B.  \n69.  After Mr. Abdi received his third parole denial on May 4, 2017, he asked his \ndeportation officer why his request was rejected again. DO Muehlig said that there was \nnothing he could do, and the decision to deny parole had been made by his superiors. He \ntold Mr. Abdi that “everything changed” in January and parole has “all stopped” under \nthe new administration. Abdi Decl. ¶ 35-36. \n70.  While he was detained Mr. Abdi was unable to effectively assist Ms. McLean in \npreparing for his asylum hearing. To support his asylum claim he must track down \ndocuments and witnesses from Somalia including his father’s death certificate, the police \nreport he filed in Mogadishu, and affidavits from his aunt and younger siblings \ncorroborating the family’s persecution. However, he is unaware of his family’s present \nwhereabouts in Somalia, and while detained, he could not reach out from detention to \nfriends outside the United States to determine where they are. Abdi Decl. ¶¶ 40-41; \nMcLean Decl. ¶ 11.  \n71.  In  Ms.  McLean’s  experience,  non-detained  clients  can  actively  assist  in  the \npreparation of their cases by reaching out to family and friends in their home countries \nvia social media, WhatsApp, and e-mail, achieving far greater results than a lawyer or \nother outside advocate ever could. They can connect with their networks, explain the \nneed for documents to support their asylum applications, and enlist their friends’ and \nfamilies’ help in collecting these documents. Detained clients are simply unable to carry \nout such basic tasks. McLean Decl. ¶ 12. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 16 of 25\n \n72.  Mr. Abdi is also suffering from debilitating anxiety and depression resulting from \nthe events that led to his fleeing Somalia, and these conditions are exacerbated by his \nlengthy detention in the United States. While at Batavia, he had nightmares when he slept \nand woke up screaming from them. Abdi Decl. ¶ 37.  \n73.  In detention, Mr. Abdi did not have the opportunity to receive adequate \ncounseling or therapy for the trauma he has suffered and his psychological situation \ndeteriorated to the point where he had trouble sleeping and breathing. Abdi Decl. ¶ 38. \n74.  Mr. Abdi’s anxiety and depression in detention were compounded by the fact that \nhe has been unable to ascertain the whereabouts of his four younger siblings. When Mr. \nAbdi fled Buulo Mareer, he was forced to leave them behind. He hopes they ran away \nbefore the Habar-gidir came back to his house looking for him. He wants to call \nneighbors and friends to inquire about them, but he was unable to do so from detention. \nHe is terrified that the reason he has not heard from his siblings is because they were \ncaptured like him or killed like his father. Id. ¶ 39. \n75.  After this lawsuit was filed, and as a direct result of the lawsuit, ICE paroled Mr. \nAbdi on August 16, 2017. His release is conditioned on a forensic analysis of his identity \ndocuments, which is not yet complete. The standards used in the analysis and the \naccuracy of any results are unknown to Mr. Abdi and his counsel. He also remains \nsubject to restraints on his liberty, including around-the-clock GPS monitoring.  Mr. Abdi \nhas not yet received a full list of any other conditions that might be imposed upon his \ncontinued release. Declaration of Robert Hodgson (“Hodgson Decl.”) ¶ 3. \n \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 17 of 25\n \nBACKGROUND REGARDING PAROLE AND DETENTION PRACTICES \nA.  Asylum and Parole Practices  \n76.  To enter the United States, non-citizens must present themselves for inspection at \na port of entry and establish their admissibility. Persons who cannot demonstrate they are \nadmissible are generally put into a streamlined removal process known as expedited \nremoval, where they do not have the opportunity to present their case before an \nimmigration judge (“IJ”).  \n77.  However, there are two groups of applicants for admission who, despite appearing \nto be inadmissible, are eligible for full removal proceedings in immigration court. They \nare (a) asylum-seekers who have been found to have a credible fear of persecution and \n(b) persons, including lawful permanent residents (“LPRs”), with valid documents who \nare nevertheless not “clearly and beyond a doubt” entitled to be admitted.  \n78.  To pass a credible fear interview (“CFI”), a person must demonstrate to the \nsatisfaction of an immigration officer that he or she has a “significant possibility” of \nbeing granted asylum.  \n79.  All persons deemed inadmissible are subject to mandatory detention. However, \nthe government may release on parole any individual seeking admission to the U.S., \nincluding asylum-seekers in removal proceedings.  \n80.  In 2009, ICE issued a directive aimed at ensuring transparency and consistency \nacross the country in the issuance of parole for arriving asylum-seekers who have passed \na CFI. See ICE Policy No. 11002.1: Parole of Arriving Aliens Found to Have a Credible \nFear of Persecution or Torture (Dec. 8, 2009) (“Parole Directive”), Declaration of \nAadhithi Padmanabhan (“Padmanabhan Decl.”), Ex A.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 18 of 25\n \n81.  The Parole Directive provides that “when an arriving alien found to have a \ncredible fear establishes to the satisfaction of [ICE] his or her identity and that he or she \npresents neither a flight risk nor danger to the community, [ICE] should, absent \nadditional factors…parole the alien on the basis that his or her continued detention is not \nin the public interest.”  \nB.  Government’s Representations that Parole Directive Remains in Effect \n82.  On February 20, 2017, DHS Secretary Kelly issued a memorandum that \naddressed, among other things, parole procedures. See Memorandum from Secretary John \nKelly, Implementing the President’s Border Security and Immigration Enforcement \nImprovement Policies, Padmanabhan Decl. Ex. B. That memorandum stated that the \nParole Directive “shall remain in full force and effect” pending the Secretary’s “further \nreview and evaluation….” Id. at 9-10.  \n83.  The Government has also represented to the Supreme Court of the United States \nthat the Parole Directive remains in full force and effect. In Jennings v. Rodriguez, a case \nin which the plaintiffs challenge the government’s policy of denying arriving asylum-\nseekers a bond hearing before an immigration judge—an alternative mechanism for \ndetainees to seek release—the Government has assured the Supreme Court that ICE \ncontinues to apply the Parole Directive in an attempt to argue that asylum-seekers have a \nrobust and navigable means of securing release from detention. Gov. Suppl. Reply Br., at \n6 n. 2, Jennings v. Rodriguez, No. 15-1204 (brief filed Feb. 21, 2017 (quoting Secretary \nKelly’s Feb. 20 memo)), Padmanabhan Decl., Ex. C. \n84.  The Government explicitly describes its parole policy as one that “automatically \nconsider[s] parole for arriving aliens found to have a credible fear, and to release the alien \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 19 of 25\n \nif he establishes his identity, demonstrates that he is not a flight risk or danger, and there \nare no countervailing considerations.” Id. at 6 (emphasis added). The brief goes on to say \nthat the parole “policy calls for far more than ‘checking a box on a form, with no hearing, \nno record and no appeal’…It provides notice to the alien, an interview, the opportunity to \nrespond and present evidence, a custody determination by an officer who did not conduct \nthe credible-fear screening, supervisory review, and further parole consideration based \nupon changed circumstances or new evidence.” Id. at 6-7.  \n85.  Indeed, the Government has consistently relied on the fact that arriving asylum-\nseekers already enjoy “extensive safeguards” that protect them from “arbitrary \ndeprivations of liberty”—in particular, the presumption of release on parole—to argue \nthat any liberty interests this group may have are adequately protected and there is no \nneed for additional process in the form of a bond hearing before an immigration judge. \nGov. Suppl. Br., Jennings v. Rodriguez, No. 15-1204 (brief filed Jan. 31, 2017), at 7, \nPadmanabhan Decl., Ex. D; see also id. at 10-11; Gov. Supp. Reply Br. at 6. At oral \nargument in Jennings, then-Acting Solicitor General Ian Gershengorn told the Justices \nthat “the government does use parole for a lot of these individuals” to demonstrate they \n“actually get process.” Excerpt of Transcript of Oral Argument at 68-69, Jennings v. \nRodriguez, No. 15-1204. Padmanabhan Decl., Ex. E. \n86.  The Supreme Court did not decide the Jennings case in the 2016-17 term. Instead \nthe case has been restored to the calendar for reargument in the next Supreme Court term. \n87.  Since the representations made by Secretary Kelly and the government in \nJennings, there has been no formal modification or rescission of the Parole Directive.  \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 20 of 25\n \nC.  Apparent Change in Parole Adjudication Practices at Batavia \n88.  Data obtained via a Freedom of Information request from the American Civil \nLiberties Union shows that between January and September 2015, 15 out of 17 requests \nfor parole at Batavia by asylum seekers who had passed a CFI were granted—an 88% \nparole grant rate. See Padmanabhan Decl. ¶¶ 7-8. \n89.  There are only a small number of lawyers who regularly represent BFDF \ndetainees. Since FOIA data for 2017 is not available, the petitioners’ undersigned counsel \nhas asked several of these practitioners about their experience with parole in 2017. See Id. \n¶¶ 2-6.  \n90.  Based on these conversations, the petitioners’ counsel has confirmed only two \nparole grants for asylum-seekers who passed a CFI at Batavia in 2017 as of the original \nfiling of this case on July 28, 2017. By contrast, 24 parole requests were denied in that \ntime period—an approximately 8% parole grant rate. Id. ¶ 5. \n91.  In addition to this drastic reversal in parole adjudication outcomes, other \nindicators point to an abrupt change of parole practices at Batavia despite the \nadministration’s assurances that the Parole Directive remains in effect. \n92.  Siana McLean, Mr. Abdi’s immigration lawyer, wrote to the Acting Field Office \nDirector, Thomas Brophy, on April 26, 2017, to inquire whether the Field Office was still \nfollowing the Parole Directive. McLean Decl. ¶ 6. \n93.  In response to her letter, she received a phone call from Deportation Officer Ball, \nwho informed her that parole adjudication practices have changed under the new \nadministration. McLean Decl. ¶ 7. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 21 of 25\n \n94.  Desiree Lurf, Mr. Barrios Ramos’s lawyer, spoke with a deportation officer, DO \nEnsminger, in early March about the parole policy. DO Ensminger also informed Ms. \nLurf that the parole adjudication practices at Batavia have changed under the new \nadministration. Lurf Decl. ¶ 9. \n95.  Both Mr. Abdi and Mr. Barrios Ramos were told by their respective deportation \nofficers that parole is no longer available at Batavia.  \n96.  The refusal to follow the Parole Directive at Batavia contradicts the public \nstatements made by the Trump administration that the Parole Directive remains “in full \nforce and effect,” and it cannot be reconciled with the requirements of the Constitution, \nrelevant statutes, and regulations. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n97.  The case is brought as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n23(a) and 23(b)(2), or in the alternative, as a representative habeas action pursuant to \nprocedures analogous to Rule 23 on behalf of all arriving asylum-seekers who have \npassed a credible fear interview and who are or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal \nDetention Facility and who have not been granted parole. All class members are detained \npursuant to the mandatory detention provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).   \n98.  The case also is brought on behalf of a sub-class consisting of those arriving \nasylum-seekers who are detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility, have passed a \ncredible fear interview, and have been or will be detained for more than six months \nwithout a bond hearing before an immigration judge (the “prolonged detention sub-\nclass”).  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 22 of 25\n \n99.  The proposed class and prolonged detention sub-class are sufficiently numerous \nso as to make joinder impracticable. Upon information and belief, the class consists of \nmore than 40 members. Given the court calendar at the Batavia Immigration Court, the \nmajority of arriving asylum-seekers remain incarcerated for six months or more as they \nawait adjudication of their asylum claims. Therefore, upon information and belief, the \nsub-class also consists of more than forty members. Joinder is also impracticable because \nmany in the proposed class and sub-class are pro se, indigent, have limited English \nproficiency, and/or have a limited understanding of the U.S. judicial system. \n100.  There are common questions of law and fact affecting class members, including \n(a) whether the Government has a policy or practice of detaining arriving asylum-seekers \nwho have passed a credible fear interview without parole at Batavia; (b) whether the \nGovernment has a policy or practice of not following the procedures and criteria of the \n2009 Parole Directive at Batavia; (c) whether the Due Process Clause or the Immigration \nand Nationality Act and its implementing regulations authorize such detention without \nparole.  \n101.  There are common questions of law and fact affecting prolonged detention sub-\nclass members, including (a) whether the Government has a policy or practice of \ndetaining arriving asylum-seekers who have passed a credible fear interview for longer \nthan six months without providing a hearing to determine whether detention is justified; \n(b) whether the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes this detention policy or \npractice; and (c) whether this detention policy or practice violates the Due Process Clause.  \n102.  Mr. Barrios Ramos’s claims are typical of those of the class and prolonged \ndetention sub-class with respect to the legality of the Government’s policies and practices \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 23 of 25\n \nat issue. The prosecution of individual actions against the respondents would create a risk \nof inconsistent and varying adjudications, which would result in variable standards of \nconduct for the respondents.  \n103.  Mr. Barrios Ramos will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class and \nsub-class. He is unaware of any conflicts that would preclude fair and adequate \nrepresentation.  \n104.  Proposed class counsel has extensive experience litigating similar matters.  \n105.  The respondents’ policy or practice of detaining class members without parole or \na bond hearing applies to the class and sub-class respectively, making class-wide \ninjunctive and declaratory relief appropriate.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CLAIM \n \n106.    The parole denials of the petitioners and the proposed class violate 8 U.S.C. § \n1182(d)(5)(A) and 8 C.F.R. § 212.5.   \nSECOND CLAIM \n \n107.    The parole denials of the petitioners and the proposed class violate the Due \nProcess Clause of Fifth Amendment. \nTHIRD CLAIM \n \n108.    The prolonged detention of the petitioners and the proposed prolonged detention \nsub-class without a bond hearing violates 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act. \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 24 of 25\n \nFOURTH CLAIM \n \n109.   The prolonged detention of the petitioners and the proposed prolonged detention \nsub-class without a bond hearing violates the Due Process Clause of the United States \nConstitution.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE the petitioners respectfully request that the Court: \n110.   Assume jurisdiction over this matter; \n111.   Order the respondents to release Mr. Abdi and Mr. Barrios Ramos on parole \nunder only those conditions authorized by the parole statute and regulation; \n112.   Order the respondents to adjudicate or readjudicate parole requests of all class \nmembers in conformance with the 2009 Parole Directive; \n113.   Declare that the respondents may not detain class members in violation of the \n2009 Parole Directive; \n114.   Order the respondents to provide the prolonged detention sub-class members a \nbond hearing before an immigration judge where the Government bears the burden of \njustifying further detention by clear and convincing evidence;  \n115.   Declare that the respondents may not detain the prolonged detention sub-class \nmembers for six months or more without providing them a bond hearing before an \nimmigration judge where the Government bears the burden of justifying further detention \nby clear and convincing evidence; \n116.   Award the named petitioners and other members of the proposed class reasonable \nattorneys’ fees and costs for this action; \n117.   Grant any other relief the Court deems just and proper.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 38-2   Filed 09/25/17   Page 25 of 25\n \n \nDated: August 21, 2017        Respectfully Submitted, \n        New York, NY           \n/s/ Aadhithi Padmanabhan \nAADHITHI PADMANABHAN \nROBERT HODGSON \nCHRISTOPHER DUNN \nPAIGE AUSTIN* \nNew York Civil Liberties \n    Foundation \n125 Broad Street, 19th Floor,  \nNew York, NY 10004 \nTel: (212) 607-3300 \napadmanabhan@nyclu.org \nrhodgson@nyclu.org \ncdunn@nyclu.org \npaustin@nyclu.org \n \nCounsel for Petitioners  \n \nMARIKO HIROSE \nInternational Refugee Assistance \n    Project \n40 Rector Street, 9th Floor, \nNew York, NY 10006 \nTel: (646) 459-3044 \nmhirose@refugeerights.org \n \n              Of Counsel \n \n* Application for admission to \nW.D.N.Y. pending \n25 \n ",

Pursuant to the letter from Petitioner's counsel dated \nSeptember 13, 2017 29 , the Motion to Expedite Hearing on Petition for \nWrit of Habeas Corpus 2 should be designated as withdrawn. \nPetitioner's counsel has also designated that letter as a motion seeking \nexpedited discovery. The letter does not comply with Local Rule of \nCivil Procedure 7 and should not be designated as a motion. The Clerk \nof Court is directed to redesignate the letter as simply providing a status \nupdate. If any party seeks affirmative relief from the Court, compliance \nwith this Court's Local Rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nis required, including filing a notice of motion setting forth the relief \nrequested, a memorandum of law, and any affidavit in support of the \nmotion. In addition, if a party seeks to have a motion determined on an \nexpedited basis, a separate motion for an expedited hearing is required. \nAt this time, the Court does not intend to conduct a telephone \nconference to discuss scheduling because scheduling orders have been \n\nissued for any pending motions. In addition, the parties are reminded \nthat, while the Court encourages cooperation between the parties and \nefforts to come to an agreement on a mutually acceptable schedule with \nrespect to any pending motion in this case, it is the Court that sets the \nschedule - not the parties - and therefore, scheduling deadlines issued \nby the Court cannot be changed by agreement between the parties \nwithout the Court's approval.

Currently pending before the Court is a 32 Motion to \nExpedite Consideration of Motion for Expedited Discovery, wherein \nPetitioners seek to expedite the briefing and this Courts consideration \nof their 31 Motion for Discovery. Petitioners represent that the \ndocuments they seek in discovery will be used to support an anticipated \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction that will be filed no later than \nSeptember 25, 2017. Also pending before the Court is \nRespondents 27 Motion to Dismiss wherein, among other arguments, \nRespondents contend that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. \nAs a result, a threshold issue that this Court will have to determine \nbefore considering the granting of any relief to Petitioners - whether it \nbe in the form of discovery or preliminary injunctive relief - is whether \nthe Court has jurisdiction to consider the claims. \nHaving considered the respective arguments by the parties, and the \nprocedural posture of this case, the Court grants the 32 Motion to \nExpedite, in part, to the extent that the Court will set a briefing schedule \nfor Petitioners 31 Motion for Discovery and consider the issues set \nforth therein on a more expedited basis than it might otherwise, but the \nmotion is otherwise denied, including to the extent that Petitioners seek \na determination on the 31 Motion for Discovery prior to the Court \nresolving the 27 Motion to Dismiss. \nAccordingly, papers in response to the 31 Motion for Discovery are \nhereby due on or before October 2, 2017.

Petitioners have filed a motion requesting that the Court \nhold a status conference to determine an appropriate process by which \nto address the issues now before it upon remand by the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit. (Dkt. 92; see Dkt. 90). While \nthe Court agrees that formulating an orderly process is appropriate, due \nto the Court's criminal docket, it does not presently have time to \nschedule a status conference. However, in lieu of a status conference, \nthe Court hereby orders that counsel confer and submit a joint proposal \nto address a briefing schedule and a proposed oral argument date for the \npending 91 motion to vacate and any other related applications for \nrelief by Wednesday November 7, 2018. If counsel are unable to agree \nupon a joint proposal, each side must submit its own competing \nproposal by November 7, 2018.

(Peoples, Tashiba) (Entered: 11/07/2018) \n11/08/2018  96   TEXT ORDER. The Court has reviewed the parties' \nsubmissions 94 95 in response to the Court's Text Order 93 . After \nconsidering the issues and the parties' respective positions, the Court is \nnot inclined to hold briefing in abeyance with respect to any properly-\nfiled motion. This does not mean that the Court will deny Petitioners' \nanticipated motion for limited discovery, nor does it mean that \nPetitioners cannot oppose the pending Motion to Vacate on the ground \nthat discovery is needed to adequately address the motion. If the Court \nultimately determines that limited discovery is warranted, it may very \nwell defer rendering a decision on any pending substantive motion and \npermit the parties to supplement their filings. But at this stage, the \nCourt is not in a position to determine whether, indeed, it will permit \nlimited discovery—particularly where no such motion has been filed. \nWhile Respondents advance setting a briefing schedule in accordance \nwith this Court's Local Rules, the briefing deadlines set forth in the \nCourt's Local Rules apply only in the absence of a Court Order, and as \na matter of practice this Court sets its own briefing schedules. \nAccordingly, the Court hereby sets the following briefing schedule for \nthe Motion to Vacate 91 . Petitioners' papers in opposition are due on or \nbefore December 7, 2018, and any reply papers are due on or before \nDecember 21, 2018. The Court intends to schedule oral argument to \naddress this motion, and a date and time for oral argument will be \nsubsequently scheduled. \nUpon the filing of any further motion as referenced in the parties' \nsubmissions, including any motion for discovery or motion to decertify \nthe class, the Court will set a briefing schedule with respect to that \nmotion.

(Peoples, Tashiba) (Entered: 05/17/2019) \n05/17/2019  137   TEXT ORDER granting in part 134 Motion to Adjourn Oral Argument. \nPetitioners request that the Court adjourn the motion hearing currently \nset for May 29, 2019, because Petitioners' attorneys who had been \npreparing for oral argument will be unavailable. Petitioners request for \noral argument to be adjourned until after July 8, 2019. Respondents \nargue that Petitioners have not established good cause for their \nrequested adjournment, and that Respondents would be prejudiced if \n\nthe Court entertained any further adjournment of the oral argument \ndate. However, the primary reasons for the delay up to this point have \nbeen the partial government shutdown and the Court's criminal \ncalendar. Petitioners have not engaged in dilatory tactics to stall the \nCourt's consideration of the pending motions, and it is likely that oral \nargument would have already taken place had the Court not had to \nreschedule briefing deadlines and the initial oral argument date in light \nof the government shutdown. The Court considers Petitioners' general \nrequest for an adjournment to be reasonable, and thus, the Court grants \nPetitioners' 134 motion to adjourn oral argument. \nNonetheless, adjourning oral argument to a date after July 8, 2019, is \nnot warranted under the circumstances. Petitioners and Respondents \nhave suggested alternative dates for oral argument that would be \namenable to both sides. In balancing Petitioners' need for additional \ntime to prepare and Respondents' concern for delaying the resolution of \nthe pending motions, the Court hereby adjourns oral argument to June \n10, 2019, at 12:30 PM in US Courthouse, 2 Niagara Square, Buffalo, \nNY 14202-3350 before the undersigned. The motion hearing will be \nheld at the federal courthouse in Buffalo because the undersigned will \nbe there on trial in a criminal case.

(Dkt. 17). On August 25, 2017, Petitioners moved to certify \na proposed class of all arriving asylum-seekers who have passed a credible fear interview \nand who are or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility and who have not \nbeen granted parole, as well as a proposed subclass of all arriving asylum-seekers who are \ndetained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility, have passed a credible fear interview, \n- 1 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 2 of 24\nand have been or will be detained for more than six months without a bond hearing before \nan immigration judge.  (Dkt. 19 at 1) . \nOn September 12, 2017, Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim.  (Dkt. 27).  Respondents then moved to stay the motion to certify \nthe class, pending resolution of the motion to dismiss (Dkt. 33).  On September 18, 2017, \nthe Court issued a Text Order holding the briefing on the motion to certify in abeyance \nuntil further order of the Court.  (Dkt. 35).  On September 25, 2017, Petitioners moved for \na preliminary injunction.  (Dkt. 38).  The Court heard argument on the motion to dismiss \nand the motion for a preliminary injunction on October 27,2017.  On October 30,2017, \nthe Court issued a Text Order denying the motion to stay the motion to certify and ordering \nthat the briefing on the motion to certify was no  longer held in abeyance.  (Dkt.  52). \nRespondents filed their response in opposition to the motion to certify on November 13, \n2017 (Dkt. 55), and Petitioners filed their reply on November 17, 2017 (Dkt. 57). \nOn November 17, 2017, the Court issued a Decision and Order (Dkt. 56) denying \nRespondents'  motion  to  dismiss  (Dkt.  27)  and  granting  Petitioners'  motion  for  a \npreliminary injunction (Dkt. 38) (the \"November 17, 2017, Decision and Order\").  The \nCourt  ordered  Respondents  to  immediately  adjudicate  or  readjudicate  the  parole \napplications  of all  members  of the  putative  class,  in  conformance  with  their  legal \nobligations,  including  their  obligations  under  ICE  Directive  No.  11002.1:  Parole  of \nArriving Aliens Found to Have a Credible Fear of Persecution or Torture (Dec. 8, 2009) \n(the \"ICE Directive\").  (Dkt. 56 at 65).  The Court also ordered Respondents to provide \nindividualized bond hearings to members of the putative subclass who have been detained \n-2-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 3 of 24\nfor six months or more, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).  (!d. at 66).  Familiarity with \nthe November 17, 20 17 , Decision and Order is presumed for purposes of this Decision and \nOrder. \nOn December 7, 2017, the Court held argument on the motion to certify the class. \nAt the argument, the Court asked Respondents to submit supplemental briefing addressing \nwhere  individuals  taken  into  ICE  custody  are  housed.  On  December  14,  2017, \nRespondents submitted a filing addressing that issue.  (Dkt. 63).  On December 15, 2017, \nPetitioners submitted a responsive filing.  (Dkt. 64 ).  Respondents submitted a reply on \nDecember 18, 2017.  (Dkt. 65). \nFor the following reasons, the motion to certify the class (Dkt. 19) is granted. \nDISCUSSION \nAlthough the Second Circuit has held that \"the class action device should not be \nimported into collateral actions, at least in its full vigor as contemplated by [Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 23],\" US. ex rei. Sero v. Preiser, 506 F.2d 1115, 1125 (2d Cir. 1974), \ncourts have held that \"[h]abeas class actions are an appropriate procedural vehicle in certain \nlimited situations,\" Wang v.  Reno, 862 F. Supp. 801, 811  (E.D.N.Y. 1994).  In Sero, the \ncourt concluded that a habeas class action was appropriately certified due to the fact that \nmany of the class members were illiterate or poorly educated; most would not otherwise \nhave had the benefit of counsel; and it was therefore not improbable that more than a few \nwould not otherwise have received the relief sought.  506 F.2d at 1126.  The court also \nconsidered judicial economy as a compelling reason for proceeding with a class action. !d. \n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 4 of 24\nThose reasons for class certification are also present in this case, and the Court concludes \nthat certification is appropriate. \nCourts that have proceeded with class claims in habeas cases have applied the Rule \n23 requirements in determining whether to certify the multiparty action.  See id. at 1126-\n27 (setting out and applying requirements of Rule 23(a)); Bertrand v. Sava, 684 F .2d 204, \n219 (2d Cir. 1982) (finding no error in lower court's decision, based upon requirements of \nRule 23, \"to certify a class of all Haitian aliens ... who have requested political asylum \nand parole, but have remained in [the] respondent's custody\" (internal quotation marks \nomitted));  US.  ex rei.  Walker v.  Mancusi,  338 F.  Supp. 311, 315-16 (W.D.N.Y.  1971) \n(employing Rule 23 to certify class of38 inmates seeking habeas relief), aff'd, 467 F.2d 51 \n(2d Cir. 1972). \nHere,  the  parties  agree  that,  \"[i]n  determining  whether  class  certification  is \nappropriate, a district court must first ascertain whether the claims meet the preconditions \nof Rule 23(a) ....\"   Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v.  Bombardier Inc., \n546 F.3d 196, 201-02 (2d Cir. 2008).  Specifically, the court must conclude that the claims \nmeet the following requirements: \n( 1)  the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2)  there are questions oflaw or fact common to the class; \n(3)  the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and \n( 4)  the  representative  parties  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the \ninterests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  Then, the court may consider granting class certification where one \nof the scenarios set forth under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(l)-(3) is satisfied.  \"The party seeking \n-4 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 5 of 24\nclass certification bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that \neach of Rule 23's requirements has been met.\"  Myers v.  Hertz Corp., 624 F.3d 537, 547 \n(2d Cir. 2010). \nI.  Rule 23(a) Class Criteria \nA.  Implied Requirement of Ascertainability \nThe  Court begins with Respondents'  argument that Petitioners'  proposed class \ndefinitions do not satisfy the implied requirement of ascertainability.  See, e.g., Dunnigan \nv. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 214 F.R.D. 125, 135 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); People United for Children, \nInc. v.  City of New York, 214 F.R.D. 252, 256 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).  \"[T]he requirement that \nthere be a class will not be deemed satisfied unless the description of it is  sufficiently \ndefinite so that it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular \nindividual is a member.\"  Mike v. Safeco Ins.  Co. ofA  m., 223 F.R.D. 50, 52-53 (D. Conn. \n2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).  Furthermore, a class \nshould be narrowly tailored to include only aggrieved parties.  See Colozzi v. St. Joseph's \nHosp. Health Ctr., 275 F.R.D. 75, 86 (N.D.N.Y. 2011). \nFirst, Respondents argue that Petitioners' class definitions are overbroad, imprecise, \nand unascertainable insofar as they contemplate future class members.  (Dkt. 55 at 25-26). \nPetitioners have defined the proposed class and subclass as follows: \nProposed class:  All arriving asylum-seekers who have passed a credible fear \ninterview and who are or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention \nFacility and who have not been granted parole. \nProposed  subclass:  All  arriving  asylum-seekers  who  are  detained  at  the \nBuffalo Federal Detention Facility, have passed a credible fear interview, and \n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 6 of 24\nhave been or will be detained for  more than six months without a bond \nhearing before an immigration judge. \n(Dkt. 19-1 at 11-12).  According to Respondents, the inclusion of individuals who \"will be \ndetained,\" in both the proposed class and the proposed subclass, is problematic because it \nincludes  \"countless  persons  who  will  be  detained  at  [the  Buffalo  Federal  Detention \nFacility] at some unidentified point in the future,\" as well as \"any asylum-seeker detained \n[at the facility] who passed a credible fear interview-on the basis that he or she might be \ndetained for more than six months.\"  (Dkt. 55 at 26). \nIn general, the fact that future members are included in a proposed class does not \npose an obstacle to certification.  See, e.g., Duprey v.  Conn. Dept. of Motor Vehicles, 191 \nF.R.D. 329, 338 (D. Conn. 2000) (\"It is not at all uncommon for a class to include future \nmembers,  who  may  generally  avail  themselves  of the  same  relief available  to  class \nmembers who have already sustained damages.\"); Ashe v. Bd. OfE  lections in City ofN  .Y., \n124 F.R.D. 45, 47 (E.D.N.Y. 1989) (\"Nor does the fact that future members are included \npose an obstacle [to certification].\").  Even so, courts routinely limit class definitions.  In \nIn re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litig., 229 F.R.D. 57, 63 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), the \ncourt declined to include in the certified class one ofthree proposed categories of putative \nclass members, because \"there was no cognizable injury when this action commenced.\" \nThe third category included \"cardholders whose first foreign exchange transaction on their \ncredit card occurred after the arbitration clause was added to their cardholder agreement \nduring this litigation.\"  !d.  The court explained that, \"[w]hile a class may contain future \nmembers, ... an individual cannot be a putative class member if he suffers no injury or is \n-6 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 7 of 24\nnot under imminent threat of injury.\"  !d.  The individuals in the third category could not \nhave suffered an injury because \"before these cardholders' rights in this action could have \nmaterialized, they agreed to forego those rights\" when an arbitration clause was added to \nthe cardholder agreement.  !d.  That case is distinguishable because, here, there has been \nno  intervening  change  in  immigration  law  or policy that  would  prevent  future  class \nmembers from suffering a cognizable injury. \nAt oral argument, Respondents cited Strouchler v. Shah, 286 F.R.D. 244 (S.D.N.Y. \n20 12) in support of their argument that the phrase \"will be\" should not be included in the \nclass definitions.  In Strouchler, an action for improper termination of Medicaid home care \nservices, the petitioners sought to certify a class  of individuals \"whose care has been \nreduced or discontinued ... because the City Defendant has determined or will determine \nthat they do not meet the medical criteria for these services.\"  !d. at 245-46 (emphasis \nadded).  The court agreed with the defendant that that language was overbroad and instead \ncertified a class of individuals \"whose care has been unlawfully reduced or discontinued \nbecause the City Defendant has determined that they do not meet the medical criteria for \nthese services.\" !d. at 24 7 (emphasis added).  In that case, the reason for the change in the \nclass definition was that the class, as proposed, could have included individuals whose \nservices were lawfully reduced or terminated.  !d.  That reasoning does not apply here and \ndoes not pertain to Respondents' argument regarding future class members. 1  The Court \nRespondents also cite Rappaportv. Katz, 62 F.R.D. 512 (S.D.N.Y. 1974), in support \nof their argument that future members should not be included in the certified class.  In that \ncase,  the  court held that the proposed class was  \"too amorphous  and  imprecise\" and \ntherefore \"neither distinguishable nor definable.\"  !d. at 513-14 (internal quotation marks \n- 7 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 8 of 24\nconcludes that the inclusion of future class members is appropriate in this case because \nthey are under threat of imminent injury.  See Arey v. Providence Hospital, 55 F.R.D. 62, \n64 (D.D.C. 1972) (certifying class brought on behalf of \"all black and female employees \nwho have sought, might have sought, seek or might seek, employment and promotion by \nthe defendant and who have been, might have been, continue to be or might be adversely \naffected because of their race and/or sex by defendant's employment practices\").  In other \nwords,  if allowed to continue, Respondents'  practice, at the Buffalo Federal Detention \nFacility,  of failing to follow the ICE Directive when adjudicating parole requests and \ndetaining  asylum-seekers  for  longer than  six  months  without a  bond hearing,  would \nnecessarily impact not only those asylum-seekers presently housed at the Buffalo Federal \nDetention Facility, but also any future detainees. \nRespondents made an additional, related argument before the Court.  Respondents \ncontend that class certification is inappropriate because members of the proposed class-\nboth present and future detainees-are no longer under imminent threat of injury, in light \nof the preliminary injunction.  The November 17, 2017, Decision and Order extended \npreliminary  injunctive  relief to  \"all members  of the putative class.\"  (Dkt.  56  at 65). \nHowever, after a decision on class certification, \"the class is no longer putative: having \nbeen subjected to a legal decision, the class is either extant or not, and once a class is \nrendered nonexistent, then no members of that nonexistent class may reasonably rely on \nomitted).  There, the proposed class consisted of\"all married and divorced men in the State \nof Illinois.\"  !d. at 514. That proposed class is far broader and more imprecise than the \nproposed class in this case. \n- 8 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 9 of 24\nthe filed action to protect their rights.\"  Giovanniello v. ALM Media, LLC, No. 3:09cv1409 \n(JBA), 2010 WL 3528649, at *5 (D. Conn. Sept. 3, 2010), aff'd, 660 F.3d 587 (2d Cir. \n2011), vacated and remanded,  568 U.S.  801  (2012),  and aff'd, 726 F.3d  106 (2d Cir. \n2013 ). 2  Similarly, once this Court issues its decision on the motion to certify the class, the \nputative class will no longer exist and the members of the once-putative class will not be \nable  to  rely  on  the  November  17,  2017,  Decision and  Order to  protect their rights.3 \nTherefore, the fact that reliefhas flowed from this Court's Decision and Order is not a basis \nfor denying class certification or limiting certification to individuals presently detained. \nHowever, the Court will exercise its inherent power to modify the definition of the \nproposed  subclass.  See  Ruzhinskaya  v.  Healthport  Techs.,  LLC,  311  F .R.D.  87,  108 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2015); Fed. R.  Civ. P. 23(c)(4).  At oral argument, Petitioners agreed to the \nCourt's proposed alteration of the class definitions that partially addresses Respondents' \nconcerns.  The proposed subclass will be modified as follows: \nProposed  subclass:  All  arriving  asylum-seekers  who  are  detained  at  the \nBuffalo Federal Detention Facility, have passed a credible fear interview, and \n2  Although the Supreme Court vacated the judgment in Giovanniello in light of a \nmore recent Supreme Court decision, on remand to the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit, that court affirmed the District of Connecticut's decision and noted its \nagreement with the district court's reasoning with respect to what becomes of a putative \nclass, post-decision on a motion to certify.  Giovanniello v.  ALM Media,  LLC, 726 F.3d \n106, 117 (2d Cir. 2013). \n3  The Court will exercise its inherent authority to modify the preliminary injunction \nso that  it  applies,  after certification, to  the  certified class  and subclass.  See  Museum \nBoutique Intercontinental, Ltd. v. Picasso, 880 F. Supp. 153, 161 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (\"In this \nCircuit, when modifying or vacating a preliminary injunction, a court is charged with the \nexercise of the same discretion it exercised in granting or denying injunctive relief in the \nfirst place ....

That limitation is appropriate because, as explained in \nthe  November  17,  2017,  Decision  and  Order,  only those  individuals  who  have  been \ndetained, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), for more than six months are entitled to a bond \nhearing.  (Dkt. 56 at 30). \nB.  Numerosity \n\"For a court to certify a class, Rule 23(a) requires a finding that the numerosity of \ninjured persons makes joinder of all class members 'impracticable.\"'  Pecere v.

'\"There is no magic minimum number that will breathe life into a \nclass, but generally, courts will find a class sufficiently numerous when it comprises forty \nor more members.\"'  Assifv. Titleserv, Inc., 288 F.R.D. 18, 23 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting \nRusso v.  CVS Pharmacy, Inc., 201 F.R.D. 291, 294 (D.

Pub. Sch. Emps. 'Ret. Sys. v. Morgan Stanley & Co., 772 F.3d 111, 120 (2d Cir.), as \namended (Nov. 12, 2014). \nRespondents  have  put  forth  no  argument  in  their  papers  with  respect  to  the \nnumerosity requirement, and they made no such assertions at oral argument.  Respondents \nassert in their motion papers, and reiterated before the Court, that they reserve their right \nto put forth a numerosity argument in the future.  (Dkt. 55 at 15 n.2). \nThe Court concludes that Petitioners have demonstrated sufficient numerosity.  In \ntheir motion to certify, Petitioners identify at least 20 asylum-seekers who received form \ndenials following their parole requests, and who have been detained for six months or more. \n(See Dkt.  19-6 (5 detainees); Dkt.  19-7 (2 detainees); Dkt.  19-8 (3  detainees); Dkt.  19-9 \n(10 detainees); but see Dkt. 19-1 at 8 (noting that at least 25 putative class members were \nidentified)).  In their reply papers in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction, \nPetitioners  identify \"28  current members  of the putative class,\" 22  of whom are  also \nmembers  of the proposed subclass.  (Dkt.  51-1  at 2).  Although Petitioners have not \nestablished an exact number of 40 or more class or subclass members, numerosity does not \nrise and fall merely by the laws of addition. See Robidoux, 987 F .2d at 936 (\"Determination \nof practicability  depends  on  all  the  circumstances  surrounding  a  case,  not  on  mere \nnumbers.\"). \n- 11 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 12 of 24\nBetween May 2016 and April 2017, the number of detainees held at the Buffalo \nFederal  Detention  Facility  fluctuated  between  519  and  620.  (Dkt.  19-3  at  2,  8). \nFurthermore, in July 20 17, about 65 detainees arrived, many of whom are believed to be \nasylum-seekers.  (Dkt. 19-5).  \"The fluid composition of a prison population is particularly \nwell-suited for class status, because, although the identity of the individuals involved may \nchange, the nature of the wrong and the basic parameters of the group affected remain \nconstant.\"  Dean v.  Coughlin,  107 F.R.D. 331, 332-33 (S.D.N.Y.  1985).  \"Class actions \ntherefore generally tend to be the norm in actions such as this.\"  Clarkson v. Coughlin, 783 \nF. Supp. 789, 797 (S.D.N.Y. 1992).  Although the proposed class members in this case are \nnot prisoners, their situation is analogous to that of prison detainees. \nFurthermore, \"the Second Circuit has relaxed the numerosity requirement where the \nputative class seeks injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).\" Nicholson \nv.  Williams, 205 F.R.D. 92, 98 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (citing Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 935-36); see \nBruce v.  Christian,  113 F.R.D. 554, 557 (S.D.N.Y.  1986) (determining that numerosity \nwas satisfied in an action involving \"present and future tenants of the New York City \nHousing Authority,\" even though only 16 class members were identified because of \"the \nfluid composition of the public housing population\").  As the Fifth Circuit has succinctly \nstated, \"[ s ]mailer classes are less objectionable where ... the plaintiff is seeking injunctive \nrelief on behalf of future class members as well as past and present members.\"  Jones v. \nDiamond, 519 F.2d 1090, 1100 (5th Cir. 1975); see Penn. Pub. Sch. Emps. 'Ret. Sys., 772 \nF.3d at  120 (noting this factor as  a proper consideration when reviewing numerosity). \nMoreover, as here, \"the ability of any one individual member of the class or the subclass \n- 12-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 13 of 24\nto maintain an individual suit will necessarily be limited by the simple reality that they are \nbeing detained\" as part of the immigration process.  V W  by and through  Williams  v. \nConway, 236 F. Supp. 3d 554, 574 (N.D.N.Y. 2017). \nTherefore,  the  Court  is  satisfied  that  Petitioners  have  demonstrated  the \nimpracticality of joinder as it relates to the proposed class and subclass. \nC.  Commonality \nRule 23(a)(2) requires a showing of\"questions of law or fact common to the class.\" \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  That requirement is satisfied where even a single issue oflaw or \nfact is common to the class, and where a classwide proceeding is capable of \"generat[ing] \ncommon answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\"  Wal-Mart Stores,  Inc.  v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349-50 (2011).  \"The claims for relief need not be identical for them \nto be common; rather, Rule 23(a)(2) simply requires that there be issues whose resolution \nwill affect all or a significant number of the putative class members.\"  Johnson v. Nextel \nCommc 'ns Inc., 780 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir. 2015). \nAccording to Petitioners, resolution of the legal implications of the ICE Directive \nwould  resolve  the  central  issue  of the  proposed  class,  and  a  decision  regarding  the \ninterpretation of 8 U.S.C.  § 1225(b) and the legality of the prolonged detentions would \nresolve the claims of all members ofthe proposed subclass. (Dkt. 19-1 at 16).  Respondents \ndisagree and contend that Petitioners cannot establish common questions of law because \nno alien has a right to parole (Dkt. 55 at 20), and because bond hearings are not required \nfor arriving aliens detained under§ 1225(b)(2)(A) (id. at 21).  Respondents misunderstand \nthe request for relief.  The relief requested by Petitioners in this litigation is not the ultimate \n- 13-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 14 of 24\nrelease on parole or bond; rather, as the Court explained in its November 17, 2017, Decision \nand  Order,  Petitioners  seek  compliance  with  certain  procedural  safeguards  when \nadjudicating parole and bond determinations.  (Dkt. 56 at 46-47). Those same procedural \nsafeguards are sought on behalf of all asylum-seekers. \nRespondents also contend that there is no commonality with respect to Petitioners' \nparole claims because the members of the proposed class have no statutory or regulatory \nbasis for the relief they seek.  (Dkt. 55 at 20).  This Court has also rejected that argument \npursuant  to  the  Accardi doctrine.  (Dkt.  56  at  63);  United States  ex  rei.  Accardi v. \nShaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954). \nNext, Respondents contend that Petitioners' request to certify the class fails because \nthe claims require individualized factual determinations and Petitioners cannot establish \nthat common facts apply to each purported class member.  (Dkt. 55 at 21-22). Respondents \nare incorrect in asserting that Petitioners do not demonstrate that common questions will \n\"generate common answers apt to drive resolution of the litigation.\"  Wal-Mart Stores, \nInc., 564 U.S. at 350.  In fact, this Court's conclusion that the Buffalo Federal Detention \nFacility is violating the ICE Directive would resolve the parole claims of all members of \nthe proposed class regardless of the fact that proposed class members allege violations of \nvarious provisions of the Directive.  The same is true for the bond claims of the prolonged \ndetention subclass.  The conclusion that the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility is failing to \nprovide  required  bond  hearings  would  resolve  the  claims  of  those  individuals. \nAccordingly, this Court concludes that Petitioners satisfy the commonality requirement of \nRule 23(a)(2). \n- 14-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 15 of 24\nD.  Typicality \nRule 23(a) also requires a showing that \"the claims or defenses of the representative \nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\"  Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  That \nrequirement is satisfied where \"it is alleged that the same unlawful conduct was directed at \nor affected both the named plaintiff and the class sought to be represented[.]\"  Robidoux, \n987 F.2d at 936-37; see also Rossini v.  Ogilvy & Mather, Inc., 798 F.2d 590, 597 (2d Cir. \n1986)  (typicality  requirement  satisfied  where  evidence  indicated  that  employer \ndiscriminated  \"in  the  same  general fashion\"  against  class  representatives  and  other \nmembers of class).  \"[M]inor variations in the fact patterns underlying individual claims\" \ndo not vitiate typicality.  Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 937.  In  V. W.,  the court found that the \ntypicality requirement was satisfied because the claims of the class representatives and the \nmembers of the class and subclass were \"based on the common application of certain \nchallenged policies.\" 236 F. Supp. 3d at 576 (citing Sykes v. Mel Harris and Assocs., LLC, \n285 F.R.D. 279, 287 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)). \nPetitioners argue that Barrios Ramos shares claims with the class and subclass that \nare  based on  Respondents'  failure  to  follow  the ICE Directive and failure to provide \nmembers  of the proposed subclass with bond hearings after more than six months of \ndetention.  (Dkt.  19-1  at 17).  Respondents contend that the typicality requirement is not \nmet because Petitioners cannot demonstrate that \"each class member's claim arises from \nthe same course of events, and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove \n[]liability.\"  Easterling v. Conn. Dept. ofCorr., 265 F.R.D. 45, 52 (D. Conn. 2010); (Dkt. \n55  at 23).  As they argue with respect to  commonality, Respondents contend that the \n- 15-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 16 of 24\ntypicality requirement is  not satisfied because there are  factual variations between the \nindividual cases.  However, as previously noted, \"minor variations in the fact patterns \nunderlying individual claims\" are not enough to negate typicality.  Robidoux, 987 F.2d at \n93 7.  Furthermore, as discussed above, Respondents mischaracterize Petitioners' request \nfor relief as seeking release on parole or bond. \nPetitioners are correct that the claims of Barrios Ramos and the members of the \nproposed class and subclass arise out of Respondents' failure to follow the dictates of the \nICE Directive and the implicit bond hearing requirement in 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b).  The Court \nfinds that Petitioners' claims satisfy the typicality requirement. \nE.  Adequacy of Representation \n\"Adequacy is twofold: the proposed class representative must have an interest in \nvigorously pursuing the claims of the class, and must have no interests antagonistic to the \ninterests of other class members.\"  Denney v.  Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253, 268 (2d \nCir. 2006).  Respondents argue that Barrios Ramos is not an adequate named representative \nbecause he has already been released on parole and his immigration proceeding has been \ntransferred to another district.  (See Dkt. 55 at 16-18). \nAccording to Respondents, Barrios Ramos will be unable to vigorously pursue the \nclass claims because his claims have been mooted and he is no longer part of the class he \nseeks to represent.  (!d.  at 18).  As discussed in the November 17, 2017, Decision and \nOrder,  Barrios  Ramos's  claims  are  not  moot  because  they  fall  within  the  voluntary \ncessation exception to the mootness doctrine, and, even if his individual claims were moot, \nthat would not adversely affect the class action claims or Barrios Ramos's capacity to \n- 16-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 17 of 24\ncontinue litigating the class claims on behalf of the proposed class and subclass.  (Dkt. 56 \nat  30-41);  see  Monaco  v.  Stone,  187  F.R.D.  50,  60  (E.D.N.Y.  1999)  (applying  the \n\"inherently transitory\" exception and stating that \"plaintiff ... may still act as the named \nrepresentative for the proposed plaintiff class despite the loss of his individual claims[, \nbecause a] named plaintiff may still litigate a class action despite the loss of [his or her] \npersonal stake if the claims are 'capable of repetition, yet evading review.\"' (quoting US. \nParole Comm 'n v.  Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 398 (1980))). \nAt oral argument on this motion, Respondents argued that Barrios Ramos is not an \nadequate representative because he voluntarily removed himself from the proposed class \nand subclass by relocating to Miami, Florida, after his release on parole.  According to \nRespondents, the likelihood that Barrios Ramos would be redetained and returned to the \njurisdiction of the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility is exceedingly small, making him an \ninappropriate  class  representative.  Petitioners  responded  that,  when  individuals  are \nreleased to parole, the parole decision is based, in part, on the fact that an individual has a \nsupport system to both ensure that the asylum-seeker will attend future proceedings and \nsatisfy ICE that the individual is not a flight risk.  Indeed, Barrios Ramos asserts in his \nmost recent declaration that he is currently living in Miami with family members.  (Dkt. \n61 at 2). \nAt the oral argument, the Court asked Respondents to submit supplemental briefing \naddressing  where  individuals  taken  into  ICE custody  are  housed.  Respondents  have \nsubmitted a status report that includes ICE Policy 11022.1, Detainee Transfers (Jan. 4, \n2012) (the \"Transfer Policy\").  (Dkt. 63-1  at 3-16).  Respondents contend that there is \n- 17-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 18 of 24\nnothing in the Transfer Policy that would counsel ICE to transfer Barrios Ramos, if the \nneed for transfer arose, to the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility, and that it is therefore \n\"highly unlikely that ... ICE would transfer him back\" to that facility.  (Dkt. 63 at 2). \nAlthough it might be unlikely that Barrios Ramos will be transferred to the Buffalo \nFederal Detention Facility in the future, the Transfer Policy gives ICE significant discretion \nin that regard.  It provides that \"a transfer may be deemed necessary\" \"[t]o transfer to a \nmore appropriate detention facility based on the detainee's individual circumstances and \nrisk factors.\"  ICE Policy 11022.1, ~ 5.2(3)(e).  Furthermore, were the Court to conclude \nthat  Barrios  Ramos  is  not  an  appropriate  class  representative,  it  could  prove  nearly \nimpossible to find a satisfactory class representative.  Detainees at the Buffalo Federal \nDetention Facility who fall within the proposed class and subclass definitions are unlikely \nto have family or a support system in the Western District ofNew York.  In light of the \nfact that Respondents can elect to release a detainee to parole at any given time, it would \nbe impracticable to require the class representative to remain in the Western District of \nNew York, or somewhere nearby, after release, and would give Respondents significant \nopportunity to impede litigation of this matter. \nRespondents also argue that Barrios Ramos, now that he has been released on parole \nand is living in Miami, does not have a vigorous interest in this litigation because he would \nnot benefit from  a resolution of this case in  favor of the proposed class and subclass. \nHowever, in his most recent declaration, Barrios Ramos affirms his interest in pursuing \nthis litigation.  (Dkt. 61).  He states that he \"derive[s] a strong sense of purpose from being \na class representative in this case\" and \"want[ s] to help everyone in [his] situation who is \n- 18-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 19 of 24\nsuffering because they do not have a fair opportunity for release on parole or bond.\"  (!d. \nat  4 ).  Barrios Ramos was imprisoned in Cuba as a result of his human rights activism, \n~ \nand he asserts that this litigation \"is a continuation of [his] struggle for human rights.\" (!d.). \nThe Court is  satisfied that Barrios Ramos \"will adequately protect the interests of the \nclass.\"  Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 403 (1975). \nThe  Court  also  concludes  that  counsel  in  this  case  are  capable  of adequately \nrepresenting the class.4  Respondents have not offered any reason why Petitioners' counsel \nare not adequate to represent the class, nor does it appear that they could.  Petitioners' \ncounsel are experienced and competent.  Indeed, Petitioners' counsel are familiar with and \nexperienced in litigating federal civil rights cases in general, as well as the immigration \nissues specific to this case.  (See Dkt. 19-2 at 1-2).  Petitioners' counsel have also clearly \nbeen in  frequent  communication with  the  detainees  at the  Buffalo Federal  Detention \nFacility (see Dkt. 19-6; Dkt. 19-7; Dkt. 19-8; Dkt. 19-9; see also Dkt. 38; Dkt. 51-1), which \ndemonstrates substantial investigative work in developing this  case.  Furthermore, the \nCourt has had the benefit of reviewing counsel's written and oral arguments thus far, and \nfinds that counsel have, without question, demonstrated qualified and experienced legal \nrepresentation in this matter. \n4  In the past, this analysis occurred under Rule 23(a)(4).  However, as a result of the \n2003 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the issue of the adequacy of \nclass counsel is now guided by Rule 23(g).  Regardless, the analysis remains the same. \nKulig v.  Midland Funding,  LLC,  No.  13-CV-4175  (PKC),  2014  WL  5017817,  at  *2 \n(S.D.N.Y.

Rule 23(b)(2) Class Certification Rules \n\"A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if ... the party \nopposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, \nso that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting \nthe class as a whole.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b )(2).  \"The key to the (b )(2) class is the indivisible \nnature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted-the notion that the conduct is \nsuch that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as \nto none of them.\"  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 360 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).  \"Civil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class-based \ndiscrimination are prime examples\" of the types of actions authorized by Rule 23(b )(2). \nAmchem Prod., Inc. v.  Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997). \nPetitioners allege that Respondents have systematically violated the ICE Directive \nby failing to provide the required process, and have subjected all members of the proposed \nsubclass to an unlawfully prolonged detention of more than six months without a bond \nhearing.  Respondents argue that parole adjudications are \"fact-specific inquiries,\" and that \nthe  denial  of parole  could  rest  on  a number  of different  grounds.  (Dkt.  55  at  28). \nRespondents also contend that the Court would be forced to \"weed out\" subclass members \nwho have  extended their detention  during the  pendency of this  action  as  a  litigation \nstrategy, which would entail various individual adjudications.

Although an evaluation of each \nproposed  class  member's  unique  situation  is  necessary  when  adjudicating  detention \ndecisions, that is not the relief sought in this proceeding.  Petitioners have demonstrated \ndeficiencies in the procedures employed by Respondents' parole system that \"stem from \ncentral and systemic failures\" and apply across-the-board to each proposed class member. \nSee Marisol A.  v.

May 13, 2013) (\"Courts have long recognized that in cases, like \nthe  present one,  'alleging  systemic  failure  of governmental  bodies  to  properly  fulfill \nstatutory requirements, have been held to be appropriate for class certification under Rule \n23(b)(2).\"' (quoting Brooklyn Center for Indep. oft he Disabledv. Bloomberg, 287 F.R.D. \n240, 250 (S.D.N.Y. 2012))). \nAccordingly, injunctive relief requiring Respondents to conform to the strictures of \nthe ICE Directive will be applicable to all proposed class members.  Again, the Court is \nnot ordering the release of any particular detainee, which would certainly require a fact \nspecific inquiry.  By contrast, the procedures set forth within the ICE Directive apply \n- 21 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 22 of 24\nequally to all proposed class members and injunctive relief ordering compliance with those \nprocedures  would  bring all  proposed class  members  relief from  the  systemic process \nviolations inflicted by Respondents. \nSimilarly,  ordering  individualized  bond  hearings  for  detainees  who  have  been \nconfined for longer than six months would also apply across-the-board to all proposed \nsubclass members.  See Rodriguez v.  Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1126 (9th Cir. 2010) (\"The \nparticular statutes controlling class members' detention may impact the viability of their \nindividual claims for relief, but do not alter the fact that relief from a single practice is \nrequested by all class members.\").  Respondents have cited to Doherty v. Thornburgh, 943 \nF .2d 204, 211 (2d Cir. 1991) and Viknesrajah v. Koson, No. 09-CV -6442 (CJS), 2011 WL \n147901, at *6 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2011) in arguing that multiple individual adjudications \nwould be necessary to determine whether each individual subclass member intentionally \nprolonged his or her detention as a litigation strategy.  (Dkt. 55 at 28).  Those cases are \ninapposite; they arise out of claims sounding in substantive due process.  As the Court held \nin its November 17, 2017, Decision and Order (Dkt. 56), the availability of an implicit \nbond hearing requirement is based upon the constitutional avoidance doctrine, which is a \ncanon of statutory construction that enables a litigant to vindicate his or her statutory rights; \nit does not create constitutional rights.  See Clark v.  Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 382 (2005). \nIn any event, the  implicit bond hearing requirement is  a time-restricted process right, \narising only after the passage of six months' time, and requires no particular substantive \noutcome  at  the  hearing  before  the  immigration judge.  In  other words,  the  proposed \nsubclass members have no responsibility to justify the availability of the bond hearing \n-22-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 66   Filed 12/19/17   Page 23 of 24\nitself;  once  the  six-month time  limit  has  expired,  it  becomes  Respondents'  statutory \nobligation  to  hold  a  hearing  and  carry  the  burden  of demonstrating-by  clear  and \nconvincing evidence-why continued detention is warranted. \nTherefore, the Court finds that the class claims satisfy the requirements of Rule \n23(b)(2). \nCONCLUSION \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Petitioners' motion to certify the class (Dkt. 19) is \ngranted, and the class and subclass are defined as follows: \nClass: All arriving asylum-seekers who have passed a credible fear interview \nand who are or will be detained at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility and \nwho have not been granted parole. \nSubclass:  All arriving asylum-seekers who are or will be detained at the \nBuffalo Federal Detention Facility, have passed a credible fear interview, and \nhave been detained for more than six months without a bond hearing before \nan immigration judge. \nFURTHER, that,  pursuant to  Fed.

In their motion \nfor discovery, Petitioners request discovery of any and all communications concerning \npractices,  policies,  guidance,  or  instructions  relating  to  parole  at  the  United  States \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") Office located in Batavia, New York \n(\"Batavia Detention Facility\").  (Dkt. 31 ).  Respondents oppose the discovery motion on \nseveral grounds, and argue that the requested discovery is not relevant and is overly broad. \n(Dkt. 46).  For the following reasons, Petitioners' motion is denied. \n- 1 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 54   Filed 11/13/17   Page 2 of 5\nDISCUSSION \nI.  Legal Standard \n\"'A habeas petitioner, unlike the usual civil litigant in federal court, is not entitled to \ndiscovery as a matter of ordinary course.\"  Bracy v.  Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 904 (1997). \n\"A petitioner bears  a heavy burden in establishing a right to discovery.\"  Edwards v. \nSuperintendent, Southport C.F., 991 F. Supp. 2d 348, 364 (E.D.N.Y. 2013).  \"Rule 6(a) of \nthe Rules Governing § 2254 Cases provides that a habeas petitioner is entitled to discovery \n'if, and to the extent that, the judge in the exercise of his discretion and for good cause \nshown grants leave to do so, but not otherwise.'\"  Renis v.  Thomas, No.  02-CV-9256 \n(DAB) (RLE), 2003  WL 22358799, at * 1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct.  16, 2003).  \"Rule 6 does not \nlicense a petitioner to engage in a 'fishing expedition' by seeking documents merely to \ndetermine whether the requested items contain any grounds that might support his petition, \nand not because the documents actually advance his claims of error.\"  Pizzuti v.  United \nStates, 809 F. Supp. 2d 164,  176 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quotations omitted).  \"Generalized \nstatements regarding the possibility of the existence of discoverable material cannot yield \n'good cause.'  The court may,  in  its  discretion,  deny  discovery where the petitioner \nprovides no specific evidence that the requested discovery would support his or her habeas \ncorpus petition.'' Renis, 2003 WL 22358799, at *1 (citation omitted). \nII.  Petitioners' Motion for Discovery is Denied \nHere, Petitioners seek the following expedited discovery: \nAll communications since January 1, 2017, concerning policies, practices, \nguidance,  or instructions,  both formal  and informal, about the parole of \nasylum-seekers at ICE's Buffalo Field Office, including but not limited to \n-2-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 54   Filed 11/13/17   Page 3 of 5\ncommunications concerning Executive Order No. 13767, \"Border Security \nand  Immigration  Enforcement  Improvements\"  (Jan.  25,  2017),  and  the \nMemorandum from  Secretary  of Homeland  Security,  \"Implementing the \nPresident's  Border Security  and  Immigration Enforcement Improvement \nPolicies\" (Feb. 20, 20 17). \n(Dkt.  31-2 at 4 ).  Petitioners describe their requested discovery as  \"a single document \nrequest within a brief date range.\"  (!d.).  Petitioners argue that the communications sought \nfrom Respondents \"would be important supplements\" to the \"substantial factual record'' \nthey intend to submit in support of their motion for preliminary injunction.  (!d.  at 8). 1 \nPetitioners also make general assertions that such discovery would be relevant to their \nclaims.  (!d.). \nHowever,  Petitioners  do  not  indicate  how  the  requested  communications  will \n\"actually advance [their] claims of error.\"  Pizzuti,  809 F.  Supp.  2d at  176 (emphasis \nadded).  It is not enough to simply surmise that the communications exist and that they \nmay be relevant, it is Petitioners' heavy burden to \"produce[] specific evidence that the \nrequested material will support [their] habeas corpus petition ....\"   Charles v. Artuz, 21 F. \nSupp.  2d  168,  170  (E.D.N.Y.  1998)  (emphases  added).  Accordingly,  Petitioners' \ngeneralized  claims  regarding  the possible  relevancy  of these  communications  do  not \nestablish the requisite \"good cause\" to warrant court-sanctioned discovery.  See Renis, \n* \n2003  WL 22358799, at  1 (\"Though there may exist discoverable materials in the sole \npossession of the Parole Board, which might yield good cause to justify discovery, the \nIndeed, Petitioners have since submitted a \"substantial factual record\" in support of \ntheir motion for preliminary injunction.  (See Dkt. 3 8; Dkt. 51). \n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 54   Filed 11/13/17   Page 4 of 5\ngeneralized nature of[the petitioner's] requests renders them merely speculative, and likely \nunworkable from a practical perspective.\"). \nFurthermore,  despite  Petitioners'  characterization of this  discovery  motion as  a \n·'single document request,\" the fact that \"all communications\" are sought signals that this \nrequest could become voluminous.  See Mills v. Lempke, No.  11-CV-0440 (MAT), 2012 \nWL  1574749, at *5-6 (W.D.N.Y.  May  3,  2012) (determining that discovery requests, \nincluding \"'all communications between every Genesee County Public official involved in \nany  aspect of his  various  criminal  proceedings,\"  were  overbroad  and  amounted to a \n\"'fishing expedition\"); see also Renis, 2003 WL 22358799, at* 1 (denying discovery where \nthe  petitioner requested,  inter alia,  \"[a]ll press releases,  transcripts  or memoranda of \nstatements, or the statements themselves, made by Governor Pataki to the media at any \ntime during his governorship; and [a]ll documents (including electronic ones) received by \nthe Division [of Parole] from, or sent by the Division [of Parole] to, the New York State \nLegislature  or  any  member  of the  Legislature''  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted)). \nPetitioners' putative class action contends, among other things, that Respondents have \nfailed to follow a particular internal agency policy relating to the parole of aliens who \nremain detained subsequent to the successful completion of a credible fear interview.  (See \nDkt. 17 at~ 96; see also id. at~ 81; Dkt. 17-7 at 5-14). Petitioners' motion does not indicate \nwhy it would be necessary, at this point in the proceedings, for the Court to permit broad \ndiscovery  of any and all communications relating to  any  and all  \"policies, practices, \nguidance, or instructions, both formal and informal,\" about paroling asylum-seekers at the \nBatavia Detention Facility.  Such a request could theoretically involve communications \n-4-\n\nCase 1:17-cv-00721-EAW   Document 54   Filed 11/13/17   Page 5 of 5\nwith other agencies  in the federal  government that have no relationship to the claims \nbrought by this action. \nTherefore, the Court determines that Petitioners have not established \"good cause\" \nwarranting discovery at this point in time. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Petitioners' motion for discovery (Dkt. 31) is denied, \nwithout prejudice. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated:  November 13, 2017 \nRochester, New York \n- 5 -",
