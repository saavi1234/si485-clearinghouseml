    "summary": "<p>This case is about private companies challenging the Federal Communications Commission&rsquo;s (FCC) proposed rate caps for prison calling services. On September 13, 2016, Securus Technologies, Inc. petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of a FCC reconsideration order setting new rate caps for local (intrastate) and long-distance (interstate) inmate calling. The Campaign for Prison Phone Justice Intervened in the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 2012, the FCC initiated the notice and comment process to consider changes to the rules governing rates for inmate calling services, and issued an order the next year. (&ldquo;First Order&rdquo;). Following the First Order, the FCC received several proposals from calling service providers urging reform. The FCC initiated a second notice and comment rulemaking process and published the &ldquo;Second Order&rdquo; in October 2015.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Inmate calling service providers also challenged the Second Order, alleging that the FCC&rsquo;s proposed rate caps violated the Administrative Procedure Act&rsquo;s prohibition against arbitrary and capricious regulations and regulations exceeding statutory authority. More information on these administrative proceedings can be found <a href=\"../../../../case/14199/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. In a parallel proceeding, the State of Oklahoma filed a <a href=\"../../../../case/16323/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuit</a> against the FCC challenging the rate caps. In March 2016, the D.C. Circuit granted a partial stay of the Second Order with respect to intrastate calling rate caps. In response to this litigation, the FCC issued an Order on Reconsideration in August 2016. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Securus Technologies, Inc. petitioned the D.C. Circuit for review of the Order on Reconsideration on September 13, 2016. This case was consolidated with several other cases challenging the order:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Global Tel*Link v. FCC, et al, Docket No. 16-01322</li>\r\n<li>Telmate, LLC v. FCC, et al, Docket No. 16-01323</li>\r\n<li>State of Oklahoma, et al v. FCC, et al, Docket No. 16-01339</li>\r\n<li>Pay Tel Communications, Inc. v. FCC, et al, Docket No. 16-01392</li>\r\n<li>Centurylink Public Comm v. FCC, et al, Docket No. 16-01393.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>On Nov. 2, 2016, the court stayed the FCC's Order on Reconsideration as to the rate caps imposed by that order on inmate calling services, set to go in effect December 12, 2016 in prisons and March 13, 2017 in jails. The court also held in abeyance further proceedings in this matter until the matter regarding the Second Order was resolved. &nbsp;2016 WL 6591778.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 13, 2017, the D.C. Circuit enjoined the Second Order's provisions regarding intrastate rate caps. Global TelLink v. FCC, 866 F.3d 397 (D.C. Cir. 2017). The parties jointly moved to vacate the Order on Reconsideration in light of this decision. They also moved to have the court dismiss as moot prior litigation challenging the FCC&rsquo;s First Order on inmate calling services.</p>\r\n<p>On December 17, 2021, the court summarily vacated the Order on Reconsideration with regard to the setting of rate caps on inmate calling service. The court noted in the per curiam order that the parties agreed the amended rate caps were premised on the legal framework and mathematical methodology that the D.C. Circuit rejected in Global TelLink v. FCC.</p>\r\n<p>The matter was remanded to the Federal Communications Commission for the consideration of the remaining provisions of the Order on Reconsideration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was closed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, on January 5, 2023, President Joe Biden signed the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act of 2022. The Act clarified the FCC&rsquo;s authority to regulate intrastate phone calls and video calls placed from correctional facilities. The Act would allow the FCC to cap the amount telecommunications companies may charge for intrastate phone calls and video calls.</p>\r\n<p>On July 18, 2024, the FCC adopted new regulations related to prison and jail calls. The new regulations reduced existing price caps by more than half and prohibited companies from charging additional fees for &ldquo;ancillary services.&rdquo; The regulations also limited companies' abilities to pay \"site commissions\" to the states and counties that contracted with them. They also allowed companies to offer &ldquo;alternative pricing plans&rdquo; for phone and video calling, on the condition that companies demonstrate these plans &ldquo;generate cost savings for consumers as a group and individually.&rdquo; The regulations also required telecom providers to make &ldquo;advanced communications services&rdquo; accessible to incarcerated people with disabilities. Finally, the regulations included rules to protect consumers, including requiring companies to try to return unused funds that are left in people's accounts when they leave jail or prison.</p>\r\n<p>Several states subsequently sued to challenge the FCC regulations; for developments in that lawsuit, see <a href=\"../../../../case/45785/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>",

In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n(“1996 Act”), Congress amended the 1934 Act to change the \nCommission’s  limited  regulatory  authority  over  intrastate \n \n\n5 \ntelecommunication  so  as  to  promote  competition  in  the \npayphone industry.  \n \nBefore  the  passage  of  the  1996  Act,  Bell  Operating \nCompanies (“BOCs”) had dominated the payphone industry to \nthe detriment of other providers. Congress sought to remedy \nthis  situation  by  authorizing  the  Commission  to  adopt \nregulations ensuring that all payphone providers are “fairly \ncompensated for each and every” interstate and intrastate call. \n47  U.S.C.  §  276(b)(1)(A).  “[P]ayphone  service”  expressly \nincludes  “the  provision  of  inmate  telephone  service  in \ncorrectional  institutions,  and  any  ancillary  services.”  Id. \n§ 276(d).  The  issues  in  this  case  focus  on  inmate  calling \nservices (“ICS”) and the rates and fees charged for these calls. \n \nFollowing the passage of the 1996 Act, the Commission \navoided intrusive regulatory measures for ICS. And prior to the \nOrder under review in this case, the Commission had never \nsought to impose rate caps on intrastate calls. Rather, the FCC \nconsistently construed its authority over intrastate payphone \nrates  as  limited  to  addressing  the  problem  of  under-\ncompensation for ICS providers. \n \nDue to a variety of market failures in the prison and jail \npayphone industry, however, inmates in correctional facilities, \nor those to whom they placed calls, incurred prohibitive per-\nminute charges and ancillary fees for payphone calls. In the \nface of this problem, the Commission decided to change its \napproach to the regulation of ICS providers. In 2015, in the \nOrder under review, the Commission set permanent rate caps \nand ancillary fee caps for interstate ICS calls and, for the first \ntime, imposed those caps on intrastate ICS calls. Rates for \nInterstate Inmate Calling Services (“Order”), 30 FCC Rcd. \n12763, 12775–76, 12838–62 (Nov. 5, 2015), 80 Fed. Reg. \n79136-01 (Dec. 18, 2015). The Commission also proposed to \n \n\n6 \nexpand the reach of its ICS regulations by banning or limiting \nfees for billing and collection services – so-called “ancillary \nfees” – and by regulating video services and other advanced \nservices in addition to traditional calling services.  \n \nFive inmate payphone providers, joined by state and local \nauthorities, now challenge the Order’s design to expand the \nFCC’s  regulatory  authority.  In  particular,  the  Petitioners \nchallenge the Order’s proposed caps on intrastate rates, the \nexclusion  of  “site  commissions”  as  costs  in  the  agency’s \nratemaking methodology, the use of industry-averaged cost \ndata in the FCC’s calculation of rate caps, the imposition of \nancillary fee caps, and reporting requirements. And one ICS \nprovider separately challenges the Commission’s failure to \npreempt  inconsistent  state  rates  and  raises  a  due  process \nchallenge.  \n \nFollowing the presidential inauguration in January 2017, \ncounsel for the FCC advised the court that, due to a change in \nthe composition of the Commission, “a majority of the current \nCommission does not believe that the agency has the authority \nto cap intrastate rates under section 276 of the Act.” Counsel \nthus informed the court that the agency was “abandoning . . . \nthe contention . . . that the Commission has the authority to cap \nintrastate rates” for ICS providers. Counsel also informed the \ncourt that the FCC was abandoning its contention “that the \nCommission lawfully considered industry-wide averages in \nsetting  the  rate  caps.”  However,  the  Commission  has  not \nrevoked, withdrawn, or suspended the Order. And one of the \nIntervenors  on  behalf  of  the  Commission,  the  “Wright \nPetitioners,”  continues  to  press  the  points  that  have  been \nabandoned by the Commission.  \n \nFor the reasons set forth below, we grant in part and deny \nin  part  the  petitions  for  review,  and  remand  for  further \n \n\n7 \nproceedings with respect to certain matters. We also dismiss \ntwo claims as moot. \n \n  We hold that the Order’s proposed caps on intrastate rates \nexceed the FCC’s statutory authority under the 1996 Act. \nWe therefore vacate this provision. \n \n  We further hold that the use of industry-averaged cost data \nas proposed in the Order is arbitrary and capricious because \nit lacks justification in the record and is not supported by \nreasoned  decisionmaking.  We  therefore  vacate  this \nprovision. \n \n  We additionally hold that the Order’s imposition of video \nvisitation reporting requirements is beyond the statutory \nauthority  of  the  Commission.  We  therefore  vacate this \nprovision.  \n \n  We find that the Order’s proposed wholesale exclusion of \nsite commission payments from the FCC’s cost calculus is \ndevoid of reasoned decisionmaking and thus arbitrary and \ncapricious.  This  provision  cannot  stand  as  presently \nproposed in the Order under review; we therefore vacate \nthis provision and remand for further proceedings on the \nmatter.  \n \n  We  deny  the  petitions  for  review  of  the  Order’s  site \ncommission reporting requirements.  \n \n  We remand the challenge to the Order’s imposition of \nancillary fee caps to allow the Commission to determine \nwhether it can segregate proposed caps on interstate calls \n(which are permissible) and the proposed caps on intrastate \ncalls (which are impermissible).  \n \n \n\n8 \n  Finally, we dismiss the preemption and due process claims \nas moot. \n \nI.  BACKGROUND \n \nA.  Statutory Background \n \nThe 1934 Act, 47 U.S.C. § 151, et seq., established a system \nof regulatory authority that divides power between individual \nstates  and  the  FCC  over  inter-  and  intrastate  telephone \ncommunication  services.  New  England  Pub.  Commc’ns \nCouncil, Inc. v. FCC, 334 F.3d 69, 75 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Under \nthis  statutory  scheme,  the  Commission  regulates  interstate \ntelephone  communication.  See  id.;  47  U.S.C.  §  151.  This \nregulatory  authority  includes  ensuring  that  all  charges  “in \nconnection with” interstate calls are “just and reasonable.” 47 \nU.S.C. § 201(b). “The Commission may prescribe such rules \nand regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to \ncarry out” these provisions. Id.  \n \nThe FCC, however, “is generally forbidden from entering \nthe field of intrastate communication service, which remains \nthe province of the states.” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 75 \n(citing 47 U.S.C. § 152(b)). Section 152(b) of the 1934 Act \nerects a presumption against the Commission’s assertion of \nregulatory authority over intrastate communications. This is \n“not only a substantive jurisdictional limitation on the FCC’s \npower, but also a rule of statutory construction” in interpreting \nthe Act’s provisions. La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. \n355, 373 (1986).  \n \nThe  1996  Act  “fundamentally  restructured  the  local \ntelephone industry,” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71, by \nchanging the FCC’s authority with respect to some intrastate \nactivities and “remov[ing] a significant area from the States’ \n \n\n9 \nexclusive control,” AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utils. Bd., 525 U.S. \n366, 382 n.8 (1999). Nevertheless, the states still primarily \n“reign supreme over intrastate rates.” New England Pub., 334 \nF.3d at 75 (quoting City of Brookings Mun. Tel. Co. v. FCC, \n822 F.2d 1153, 1155 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). “Insofar as Congress \nhas remained silent... § 152(b) continues to function. The \n     \nCommission could not, for example, regulate any aspect of \nintrastate communication not governed by the 1996 Act on the \ntheory that it had an ancillary effect on matters within the \nCommission’s primary jurisdiction.” AT&T Corp., 525 U.S. at \n382 n.8.  \n \n  Although  the  strictures  of  § 152  remain  in  force,  the \nchanges imposed by the 1996 Act were significant. Evidence \nof this is seen in the “Special Provisions Concerning Bell \nOperating Companies.” 47 U.S.C. §§ 271–76. Section 276 was \n“specifically aimed at promoting competition in the payphone \nservice industry.” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71. While \nlocal  phone  services  were  once  thought  to  be  natural \nmonopolies, “[t]echnological advances . . . made competition \namong multiple providers of local service seem possible, and \nCongress [in the 1996 Act] ended the longstanding regime of \nstate-sanctioned monopolies.” AT&T Corp., 525 U.S. at 371; \nsee  also  Glob.  Crossing  Telecomms.,  Inc.  v.  Metrophones \nTelecomms., Inc., 550 U.S. 45, 50 (2007).  \nThe  market  history  is  illuminating.  After  AT&T  had \ndivested its local exchange carriers into individual BOCs in \n1982,  BOCs  continued  to  discriminate  against  non-BOC \npayphone providers and effectively foreclosed competition. \nThe BOCs accomplished this by generally making sure that \nother providers were not compensated for calls using BOC-\nowned payphone lines. See New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71. \nThus, because technology constraints forced many non-BOC \nproviders to use BOC-owned payphone lines, those providers \n \n\n10 \nwere often left uncompensated for payphone calls. The 1996 \nAct changed these market practices. \nIn § 276, Congress clearly aimed to “promote competition \namong  payphone  service  providers  and  promote  the \nwidespread deployment of payphone services to the benefit of \nthe general public.” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1). Covered payphone \nservices  include  “inmate  telephone  service  in  correctional \ninstitutions, and any ancillary services.” Id. § 276(d). Section \n276 of the 1996 Act authorizes the Commission “to prescribe \nregulations consistent with the goal of promoting competition, \nrequiring that the Commission take five specific steps toward \nthat goal.” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71. One such step is \nto “establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all \npayphone service providers are fairly compensated for each \nand every completed intrastate and interstate call using their \npayphone,”  and  to  prescribe  regulations  to  establish  this \ncompensation plan by November 1996. 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1), \n(b)(1)(A). The remaining four steps further encourage or force \ncompetition  between  BOC  and  non-BOC  providers.  Id. \n§ 276(b)(1)(B)–(E).  Any  state  requirements  that  are \ninconsistent with FCC’s regulations adopted pursuant to § 276 \nare preempted. Id. § 276(c). \nB.  Factual and Procedural Background \n \nOver the years, payphone providers have sought to provide \ninmate  calling  services  to  inmates  in  prisons  and  jails \nnationwide. ICS providers now compete with one another to \nwin  bids  for  long-term  ICS  contracts  with  correctional \nfacilities.  In  awarding  contracts  to  providers,  correctional \nfacilities usually give considerable weight to which provider \noffers the highest site commission, which is typically a portion \nof the provider’s revenue or profits. See Implementation of Pay \nTel. Reclassification & Comp. Provisions of Telecomms. Act of \n \n\n11 \n1996, 17 FCC Rcd. 3248, 3252–53 (2002). Site commissions  \napparently range between 20% and 63% of the providers’ \nprofits, but can exceed that amount. Id. at 3253 n.34. And ICS \nproviders pay over $460 million in site commissions annually. \nOrder, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12821. \nOnce a long-term, exclusive contract bid is awarded to an \nICS  provider,  competition  ceases  for  the  duration  of  the \ncontract  and  subsequent  contract  renewals.  Winning  ICS \nproviders thus operate locational monopolies with a captive \nconsumer  base  of  inmates  and  the  need  to  pay  high  site \ncommissions. See 17 FCC Rcd. at 3253. After a decade of \nindustry consolidation, three specialized ICS firms now control \n85% of the market. Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12801. And ICS \nper-minute rates and ancillary fees together are extraordinarily \nhigh, with some rates as high as $56.00 for a four-minute call. \nId. at 12765 n.4. \nIn reviewing this market situation, the FCC found that \ninmate  calling  services  are  “a  prime  example  of  market \nfailure.” Id. at 12765. In its brief to this court, FCC counsel \naptly explains the seriousness of the situation: \nInmates  and  their  families  cannot  choose  for \nthemselves  the  inmate  calling  provider  on  whose \nservices  they  rely  to  communicate.  Instead, \ncorrectional facilities each have a single provider of \ninmate calling services. And very often, correctional \nauthorities  award  that  monopoly  franchise  based \nprincipally on what portion of inmate calling revenues \na provider will share with the facility—i.e., on the \npayment of “site commissions.” Accordingly, inmate \ncalling  providers  compete  to  offer  the  highest  site \ncommission  payments,  which  they  recover  through \ncorrespondingly higher end-user rates. See [Order, 30 \n \n\n12 \nFCC Rcd. at 12818–21]. If inmates and their families \nwish to speak by telephone, they have no choice but to \npay the resulting rates. \nBr. for FCC at 4. \n \nIn  February  2000,  Intervenor  Martha  Wright  filed  a \nputative class action against ICS providers on behalf of her \ngrandson, other inmates, and their loved ones to challenge ICS \nrates and fees. Complaint, Wright, et al. v. Corr. Corp. of Am., \nNo.  1:00-CV-00293  (D.D.C.  Feb.  16,  2000).  In  2001,  the \nDistrict Court stayed the case to afford the FCC the opportunity \nto consider the reasonableness of ICS rates in the first instance \nthrough rulemaking. Thereafter, in 2003 and in 2007, Martha \nWright and others petitioned the Commission for rulemaking \nto regulate ICS rates and fees. Petition for Rulemaking, FCC \nNo.  96-128  (Nov.  3,  2003);  Petitioners’  Alternative \nRulemaking Proposal, FCC No. 96-128 (Mar. 1, 2007).  \n \nThe record compiled by the Commission fairly clearly \nsupports  its  determination  that  ICS  charges  raise  serious \nconcerns. As noted in the FCC’s brief to the court: \n \nExcessive  rates  for  inmate  calling  deter \ncommunication between inmates and their families, \nwith substantial and damaging social consequences. \nInmates’ families may be forced to choose between \nputting food on the table or paying hundreds of dollars \neach month to keep in touch. See [Order, 30 FCC Rcd. \nat 12766–67]. When incarcerated parents lack regular \ncontact with their children, those children—2.7 million \nof  them  nationwide—have  higher  rates  of  truancy, \ndepression, and poor school performance. See [id. at \n12766–67 & 12767 n.18]. Barriers to communication \nfrom high inmate calling rates interfere with inmates’ \n \n\n13 \nability to consult their attorneys, see [id. at 12765], \nimpede family contact that can “make[] prisons and \njails  safer  spaces,”  [id.  at  12767],  and  foster \nrecidivism, see [id. at 12766–67]. \n \nBr. for FCC at 4–5. Petitioners do not seriously contest these \nfacts. See Joint Br. for Pet’rs at 7 (acknowledging that “calling \nrates often exceed, sometimes substantially, rates for ordinary \ntoll calls”). \n \nIn 2013, the Commission issued an interim order imposing \na per-minute rate cap for interstate ICS calls, citing its plenary \nauthority over interstate calls under § 201(b) and its mandate \nto ensure that providers are “fairly compensated” under § 276. \nRates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services (“Interim Order”), \n28  FCC  Rcd.  14107,  14114–15  (2013).  ICS  providers \npetitioned for this court’s review of the Interim Order. The \ncourt  stayed  application  of  certain  portions  of  the  Interim \nOrder but allowed its interstate rate caps to remain in effect. \nOrder, Securus Techs. v. FCC, No. 13-1280 (“Securus I”) (D.C. \nCir. Jan. 13, 2014), ECF No. 1474764 (staying only 47 C.F.R. \n§§ 64.6010, 64.6020, and 64.6060). In December 2014, the \ncourt held the petitions in abeyance while the Commission \nproceeded to set permanent rates. Order, Securus I (D.C. Cir. \nDec. 16, 2014), ECF No. 1527663.  \n \nIn  2015,  the  Commission  set  permanent  rate  caps  and \nancillary fee caps for interstate ICS calls, and for the first time \nthe agency imposed caps on intrastate ICS calls. Order, 30 FCC \nRcd. at 12775–76, 12838–62. The rate caps were set for four \ncategories – “all prisons” and three tiers of jails based on size \n– and the rate caps varied by category. Id. at 12770. The rate \ncaps, which were made effective immediately, ranged from \n$.14 to $.49 per minute, but were to decrease as of July 1, 2018, \nto $.11 to $.22 per minute. Id. In setting the rate caps, the \n \n\n14 \nCommission  used  a  ratemaking  methodology  based  on \nindustry-average cost data that excluded site commissions as a \ncost.  Id.  at  12790,  12818–38.  The  Order  also  imposed \nreporting requirements on ICS providers, including for video \nvisitation services and site commissions. Id. at 12890–93.  \n \nICS  providers  Global  Tel*Link;  Securus  Technologies, \nInc.;  CenturyLink  Public  Communications,  Inc.;  Telmate, \nLLC; and Pay Tel Communications (“Pay Tel”) (collectively \n“Petitioners”) separately petitioned for review. Various state \nand  local  correctional  authorities,  governments,  and \ncorrectional facility organizations petitioned and/or intervened \non behalf of Petitioners. Martha Wright’s putative class and \nvarious  inmate-related  legal  organizations  (“Intervenors”) \nintervened on behalf of the Commission.  \n \nIn  early  2016,  the  court  consolidated  the  petitions  for \nreview. On March 7, 2016, the court stayed the application of \nthe Order’s rate caps and ancillary fee caps as to single-call \nservices while this case was pending. Order, Global Tel*Link, \net al. v. FCC, No. 15-1461 (“Global Tel*Link”) (D.C. Cir. Mar. \n7, 2016), ECF No. 1602581. Subsequently, on March 23, 2016, \nthe  court  stayed  the  application  of  the  Interim  Order  to \nintrastate rates. Order, Global Tel*Link (D.C. Cir. Mar. 23, \n2016), ECF No. 1605455.  \n \nIn August 2016, on reconsideration of the FCC’s Order, the \nCommission raised the rate caps to account for a small portion \nof  site  commissions.  Rates  for  Interstate  Inmate  Calling \nServices  (“Reconsideration  Order”),  31  FCC  Rcd.  9300 \n(2016).  ICS  providers  petitioned  for  review  of  the \nReconsideration Order, but the court held those petitions in \nabeyance and stayed the Reconsideration Order pending the \noutcome of this case. See Order, Securus Techs. v. FCC, No. \n \n\n15 \n16-1321 (“Securus II”) (D.C. Cir. Nov. 2, 2016), ECF No. \n1644302. \n \nOn January 31, 2017, counsel for the FCC filed a letter \nadvising  this  court  that  the  Commission  had  experienced \n“significant changes in [its] composition.” Letter at 1, Global \nTel*Link (D.C. Cir. Jan. 31, 2017), ECF No. 1658521. Of the \nfive Commissioners who had voted on the Order, two of the \nthree Commissioners in the majority had left the FCC. Id. \nBecause the dissent’s position now commanded a majority, \ncounsel for the FCC informed the court that “a majority of the \ncurrent Commission does not believe that the agency has the \nauthority to cap intrastate rates under section 276 of the Act.” \nId.  Counsel  thus  advised  the  court  that  the  FCC  was \n“abandoning . . . the contention . . . that the Commission has \nthe  authority  to  cap  intrastate  rates”  for  ICS.  Id.  Counsel \nadditionally informed the court that the FCC was abandoning \nits  contention  “that  the  Commission  lawfully  considered \nindustry-wide averages in setting the rate caps.” Id. at 2. At oral \nargument, counsel for the Commission confirmed the agency’s \nabandonment  of  these  aspects  of  the  Order.  Tr.  of  Oral \nArgument at 43–45, Global Tel*Link (D.C. Cir. Feb. 6, 2017), \nECF No. 1666379.  \n \nII.  ANALYSIS \n \nA.  The Posture of this Case \n \nThe current posture of this case is unusual because counsel \nfor the FCC has advised the court that the agency will not \noppose two of the principal challenges raised by Petitioners \nregarding: (1) the authority of the FCC to set permanent rate \ncaps and ancillary fee caps for intrastate ICS calls; and (2) the \nlegality of the Commission’s consideration of industry-wide \naverages in setting rate caps. In light of the FCC’s change of \n \n\n16 \nposition, a question arises as to whether these challenges are \nmoot.  \n \nIt is well established that “voluntary cessation of allegedly \nillegal conduct does not deprive [a judicial] tribunal of power \nto hear and determine the case, i.e., does not make the case \nmoot.” United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632 \n(1953). As the Court explained: \n \nA  controversy  may  remain  to  be  settled  in  such \ncircumstances, e.g., a dispute over the legality of the \nchallenged practices. The defendant is free to return to \nhis old ways. This, together with a public interest in \nhaving the legality of the practices settled, militates \nagainst a mootness conclusion. For to say that the case \nhas become moot means that the defendant is entitled \nto a dismissal as a matter of right. The courts have \nrightly refused to grant defendants such a powerful \nweapon against public law enforcement. \n \nId. at 632 (citations omitted).  \n \n“Voluntary cessation” justifies the dismissal of a case on \ngrounds  of  mootness  only  when  “the  defendant  can \ndemonstrate that there is no reasonable expectation that the \nwrong will be repeated. The burden is a heavy one.” Id. at 633 \n(citation  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted);  see  also \nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., \n528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (“[T]he standard we have announced \nfor  determining  whether  a  case  has  been  mooted  by  the \ndefendant’s  voluntary  conduct  is  stringent:  ‘A  case  might \nbecome moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that \nthe  allegedly  wrongful  behavior  could  not  reasonably  be \nexpected to recur.’ The ‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the \ncourt  that  the  challenged  conduct  cannot  reasonably  be \n \n\n17 \nexpected  to  start  up  again  lies  with  the  party  asserting \nmootness.” (quoting United States v. Concentrated Phosphate \nExport Ass’n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968))); Payne Enters., Inc. \nv.  United  States,  837  F.2d  486,  491–92  (D.C.  Cir.  1988) \n(same). \n \nThere is absolutely no basis for dismissing as moot the \nclaims relating to the issues that the FCC has “abandoned.” \nIndeed, neither the FCC, the Petitioners, nor the Intervenors \nhave urged this. The reason is fairly simple: the Order that gave \nrise to the petitions for review is still in force. Although counsel \nfor the FCC has made it clear that the agency will not defend \nportions of the Order, the Commission has never acted to \nrevoke, withdraw, or suspend the Order. Given this posture of \nthe case, it is plain that there has been no “voluntary cessation” \nby  the  FCC  that  would  warrant  dismissal  of  Petitioners’ \nchallenges to the Order. \n \nB.  Standard of Review \n \nAlthough Petitioners’ challenges to the provisions of the \nOrder purporting to cap intrastate rates and to apply industry-\nwide averages in setting rate caps are not moot, a question \nremains  as  to  what  standard  governs  our  review  of  these \nprovisions. Normally, we would follow the familiar two-step \nChevron framework as the appropriate standard of review. See \nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. \n837 (1984). Under the Chevron framework, \n \nan agency’s power to regulate “is limited to the scope \nof the authority Congress has delegated to it.” Am. \nLibrary Ass’n v. FCC, 406 F.3d 689, 698 (D.C. Cir. \n2005). Pursuant to Chevron Step One, if the intent of \nCongress is clear, the reviewing court must give effect \nto that unambiguously expressed intent. If Congress \n \n\n18 \nhas not directly addressed the precise question at issue, \nthe reviewing court proceeds to Chevron Step Two. \nUnder Step Two, “[i]f Congress has explicitly left a \ngap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation \nof  authority  to  the  agency  to  elucidate  a  specific \nprovision of the statute by regulation. Such legislative \nregulations are given controlling weight unless they are  \n. . . manifestly contrary to the statute.” Chevron, 467 \nU.S. at 843–44. Where a “legislative delegation to an \nagency on a particular question is implicit rather than \nexplicit,”  the  reviewing  court  must  uphold  any \n“reasonable interpretation made by the administrator \nof  [that]  agency.”  Id.  at  844.  But  deference  to  an \nagency’s interpretation of its enabling statute “is due \nonly  when  the  agency  acts  pursuant  to  delegated \nauthority.” Am. Library Ass’n, 406 F.3d at 699. \n \nEDWARDS,  ELLIOTT,  AND  LEVY,  FEDERAL  STANDARDS  OF \nREVIEW 166–67 (2d ed. 2013).  \n \nThe disputed Order in this case was promulgated by the \nFCC “carrying the force of law.” United States v. Mead Corp., \n533 U.S. 218, 226–27 (2001). Therefore, it was presumptively \nsubject to review pursuant to Chevron. Id. The oddity here, \nhowever, is that the agency no longer seeks deference for the \nparts of the Order purporting to cap intrastate rates for ICS \nproviders and to apply industry-wide averages in setting the \nrate caps. In these circumstances, it would make no sense for \nthis court to determine whether the disputed agency positions \nadvanced in the Order warrant Chevron deference when the \nagency has abandoned those positions. \n \nAlthough the Chevron framework is of no significance with \nrespect to the cap on intrastate rates and the application of \nindustry-wide averages issues, this does not affect the court’s \n \n\n19 \njurisdiction to address these issues. See, e.g., New Process \nSteel, L.P. v. NLRB, 560 U.S. 674, 679–83 (2010) (deciding the \nstatutory issue without reference to the Chevron framework). \nTherefore, “[w]ith Chevron inapplicable, . . . ‘we must decide \nfor ourselves the best reading’” of the statutory provisions at \nissue in this case. Miller v. Clinton, 687 F.3d 1332, 1342 (D.C. \nCir. 2012) (quoting Landmark Legal Found. v. IRS, 267 F.3d \n1132, 1136 (D.C. Cir. 2001)).  \nIt  is  well  recognized  that  when  a  disputed  agency \ninterpretation does not carry the force of law, it still may be \n“entitled to respect,” at least to the extent that the interpretation \nhas the “power to persuade.” Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. \n134,  140  (1944);  see  also  Mead,  533  U.S.  at  227–31; \nChristensen  v.  Harris  Cty.,  529  U.S.  576,  587  (2000). \nHowever,  in  this  case,  because  the  FCC  now  offers  no \ninterpretations  in  support  the  provisions  of  the  Order \npurporting to cap intrastate rates for ICS providers and apply \nindustry-wide averages in setting the rate caps, the court must \nresolve  these  issues  applying  the  usual  rules  of  statutory \nconstruction. See, e.g., MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Am. Tel. & \nTel.  Co.,  512  U.S.  218  (1994);  see  generally  ROBERT  A. \nKATZMANN,  JUDGING  STATUTES  (2014);  WILLIAM  N. \nESKRIDGE,  JR.,  ABBE  R.  GLUCK  &  VICTORIA  F.  NOURSE, \nSTATUTES,  REGULATION,  AND  INTERPRETATION  409–29 \n(2014). \n  With respect to the remaining issues before the court, we \nwill apply the Chevron framework, as applicable. As to all \nother issues, we will apply § 706(2)(A) of the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), which provides that a reviewing court \nshall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions found to be. . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  Under this standard of review, we search for \n \n\n20 \n“reasoned decisionmaking.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., \nInc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (“State Farm”), 463 U.S. \n29, 52 (1983). This means that we must determine whether the \nFCC  “examine[d]  the  relevant  data  and  articulate[d]  a \nsatisfactory  explanation  for  its  action  including  a  rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.” Id. \nat 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n \nC.  The Authority of the FCC to Set Permanent Rate Caps \nand Ancillary Fee Caps for Intrastate ICS Calls \n \nIn the disputed Order, the Commission asserted authority \nto impose rate caps on intrastate ICS calls for the first time. It \ndid so under the guise of § 276 of the 1996 Act, which requires \nthe Commission to “establish a per call compensation plan to \nensure  that  all  payphone  service  providers  are  fairly \ncompensated  for  each  and  every  completed  intrastate  and \ninterstate  call  using  their  payphone,”  and  to  prescribe \nregulations  to  establish  this  compensation  plan.  47  U.S.C. \n§ 276(b)(1), (b)(1)(A). Petitioners assert that the provision in  \n§ 276, requiring the Commission to ensure that ICS providers \nare “fairly compensated,” does not override the command of  \n§ 152(b), which forbids the FCC from asserting jurisdiction \nover “charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or \nregulations for or in connection with intrastate communication \nservice.” 47 U.S.C. § 152(b) (emphasis added). Petitioners also \ncontend that § 276 does not give the Commission ratemaking \nauthority comparable to the authority that it has under § 201 to \nregulate and cap interstate rates. Finally, Petitioners point out \nthat the intrastate rate caps prescribed in the Order make little \nsense in light of the undisputed record evidence showing that \nmany ICS providers have costs that are higher than the disputed \nrate caps. We agree with Petitioners that, on the record in this \ncase,  §  276  did  not  authorize  the  Commission  to  impose \n \n\n21 \nintrastate  rate  caps  as  prescribed  in  the  Order.  Several \nconsiderations have influenced our judgment on this matter. \n  \nFirst, as noted above, § 152(b) of the 1934 Act erects a \npresumption against the Commission’s assertion of regulatory \nauthority  over  intrastate  communications.  La.  Pub.  Serv. \nComm’n, 476 U.S. at 373 (making it clear that this is “not only \na substantive jurisdictional limitation on the FCC’s power, but \nalso a rule of statutory construction” in interpreting the Act’s \nprovisions). As we explain below, the Order in this case does \nnot come close to overcoming this presumption in proposing to \ncap intrastate rates. \n \nSecond, the Order erroneously treats the Commission’s \nauthority under § 201 and § 276 as coterminous. Section 201 \nimbues the Commission with traditional ratemaking powers \nover interstate calls, including the imposition of rate caps. The \nstatute explicitly directs the FCC to ensure that interstate rates \nare “just and reasonable,” and to “prescribe such rules and \nregulations as may be necessary in the public interest” to carry \nout these provisions. 47 U.S.C. § 201(b). Section 276, however, \ndoes not give the Commission authority to determine “just and \nreasonable” rates. Rather, § 276 merely directs the Commission \nto “ensure that all [ICS] providers are fairly compensated” for \ntheir inter- and intrastate calls. 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A).  \n \nThe language and purpose of § 201 in the 1934 Act are \nfundamentally  different  from  the  language  and  purpose  of \n§ 276 in the 1996 Act. The Order glosses over these differences \nin declaring that the Commission has authority to ensure that \nrates are “just, reasonable and fair.” See, e.g., Order, 30 FCC \nRcd. at 12766, 12817. This is not what § 201(b) and § 276 say. \nAnd once the Order misquotes the language of § 201(b) and \n§ 276, it goes on to conclude that these provisions in their \ncombined effect authorize the FCC to set rate caps to ensure \n \n\n22 \nthat both inter- and intrastate rates are “‘just and reasonable’ \nand do not take unfair advantage of inmates, their families, or \nproviders consistent with the ‘fair compensation’ mandate of \nsection 276.” Id. at 12817. In other words, in ignoring the terms \nof § 276, the Order conflates two distinct statutory grants of \nauthority into a synthetic “just, reasonable and fair” standard. \nThis is impermissible.  \n \nThird,  the  Order  asserts  that  the  Commission  “has \npreviously found that the term ‘fairly compensated’ [in § 276] \npermits a range of compensation rates . . ., but that the interests \nof both the payphone service providers and the parties paying \nthe  compensation  must  be  taken  into  account,”  implying \nconsiderations of fairness to the consumer. Id. at 12814 n.335. \nThis assertion is unfounded. The truth is that the Commission’s \nprior orders align with a narrow reading of the statute that does \nnot purport to treat the Commission’s authority under § 201 \nand § 276 as coterminous. The FCC’s prior orders to which the \nOrder here refers construed the “fairly compensated” mandate \nof § 276 as irrelevant to ICS rates reached through contractual \nbargaining. This was because the FCC had determined that \n“whenever a [payphone provider] is able to negotiate for itself \nthe terms of compensation for the calls its payphones originate, \nthen [the Commission’s] statutory obligation to provide fair \ncompensation is satisfied.” Implementation of the Pay Tel. \nReclassification & Comp. Provisions of the Telecomms. Act of \n1996,  11  FCC  Rcd.  21233,  21269  (1996).  This  is  hardly \nevidence of “just, reasonable and fair” ratemaking under § 276. \n \nFurthermore, it is noteworthy that the Commission’s prior \norders  repeatedly  acknowledge  that  §  276  focuses  on  the \nproblem of uncompensated calls in situations in which BOC \nproviders  engaged  in  anti-competitive  behavior.  In  other \nwords, the FCC recognized that a principal reason for the \nenactment of § 276 was to address “the limitation on the ability \n \n\n23 \nof [payphone providers] and carriers to negotiate a mutually \nagreeable amount” because of technological and regulatory \nconstraints. Implementation of the Pay Tel. Reclassification & \nComp. Provisions of the Telecomms. Act of 1996, 14 FCC Rcd. \n2545, 2551, 2569 (1999). Therefore, the prior orders to which \nthe Order at issue here refers focused on payphone providers \nand carriers to determine whether the providers were fairly \ncompensated. See, e.g., id. at 2570; Implementation of Pay Tel. \nReclassification & Comp. Provisions of Telecomms. Act of \n1996, 17 FCC Rcd. 21274, 21302 (2002) (referring to providers \nand the carriers compensating the providers in stating that \n§ 276 “implies fairness to both sides”). The prior orders did not \nreflect  anything  approaching  “just,  reasonable  and  fair” \nratemaking  for  intrastate  rates  as  authorized  by  § 201  for \ninterstate rates. \n \nIn the agency brief that was filed with the court before the \nFCC abandoned its support of the intrastate rate caps, counsel \nargued that fairness to the consumer is implied in § 276 because \nthe reference to “fair” (in “fairly compensated”) is “capacious.” \nBr. for FCC at 31. This argument finds no support in the Order. \nAs noted above, the Order simply asserts that intrastate rate \ncaps are consistent with the Commission’s past orders. And, as \nnoted above, the Commission’s past orders do not support a \n“capacious” interpretation of “fairly compensated” in § 276 to \nsuggest that it is comparable to “just, reasonable and fair” \nratemaking in § 201. The prior orders merely relied on the \n“fairly compensated” language to set a default rate from which \nthe  payphone  providers  and  carriers  could  negotiate  a \ndeparture, not to reduce bargained-for compensation. See, e.g., \n11 FCC Rcd. at 21267–69; 14 FCC Rcd. at 2569–71. The \nCommission made it clear that it meant to “g[i]ve primary \nimportance to Congress’s objective of establishing a market-\nbased, deregulatory mechanism for payphone compensation, as \n \n\n24 \nrequired both in section 276 and the generally pro-competitive \ngoals of the 1996 Act.” 14 FCC Rcd. at 2548.  \n \nFinally, the Order cites two decisions of this court to justify \nan interpretation of the “fair compensation” mandate in § 276 \nthat includes “just and reasonable” ratemaking in § 201. Order, \n30 FCC Rcd. at 12815–16 (citing Ill. Pub. Telecomms. Ass’n v. \nFCC, 117 F.3d 555, 562 (D.C. Cir. 1997); New England Pub., \n334 F.3d at 75). The Order’s construction of these decisions is \nmisguided because neither decision compels the conclusion \nthat § 276 authorizes the Commission to cap intrastate rates \npursuant to “just, reasonable and fair” ratemaking.  \n \nThe Order first extracts language from the decision in \nIllinois  saying  that  §  276  provides  the  Commission  with \n“authority to set local coin call rates.” 117 F.3d at 562. But in \nthe order under review in Illinois, the FCC did not “set” local \ncoin call rates by imposing caps on intrastate rates. Rather, the \nagency merely interpreted the mandate of § 276(b)(1)(A) to \n“require[] the Commission to act only with respect to those \ntypes of calls for which a [payphone provider] does not already \nreceive fair compensation.” Id. at 559 (emphasis added). And \neven for those calls, the FCC ultimately determined a default \nfloor based on the deregulated market rate and allowed the \npayphone providers to negotiate a departure from that rate. Id. \nat 560.  \n \nIn reviewing the FCC’s order that was contested in Illinois, \nwe  held  that  §  276  unambiguously  overrode  §  152(b)’s \npresumption against intrastate jurisdiction insofar as it granted \nthe Commission authority to “set” reimbursement rates for \nlocal coin calls in order to ensure that payphone operators who \nwere previously uncompensated were “fairly compensated.” \nId. at 561–63. The court did not say that § 276 overrode the \npresumption  against  intrastate  jurisdiction  to  allow  the \n \n\n25 \nCommission to reduce already compensatory rates, which is \nwhat the Order at issue in this case suggests. Rather, the Illinois \ncourt said: \n \nIf locational monopolies turn out to be a problem, \nhowever, the Commission suggested some ways in \nwhich  it  might  deal  with  them:  a  State  might  be \npermitted to require competitive bidding for locational \ncontracts,  or  to  mandate  that  additional  [payphone \nproviders] be allowed to provide payphones at the \nlocation; and if these remedies fail, the Commission \nmay consider the matter further. \n \nId. at 562–63. None of these options contemplated caps on \nintrastate rates.  \n \nIt is true that the decision in Illinois does not explicitly \npreclude the Commission from imposing intrastate rate caps. \nThat was not the question before the court. But the Order at \nissue in this case is wrong in suggesting that the decision in \nIllinois reflects “significant judicial precedent [that] supports \nthe Commission’s authority” to reduce already compensatory \nrates. Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12815. Indeed, in Illinois the court \nreversed  the  Commission’s  decision  to  exclude  certain \nuncompensated calls from its mandatory compensation plan \nbecause the failure to provide compensation for this type of \npayphone  call  was  “patently  inconsistent  with  §  276’s \ncommand that fair compensation be provided for ‘each and \nevery completed . . . call.’” 117 F.3d at 566. \n \nThe Order at issue in this case also purports to rely on a \nstatement  in  the  New  England  decision  that  §  276 \n“unambiguously  and  straightforwardly  authorizes  the \nCommission to regulate . . . intrastate payphone line rates.” \nOrder at 12815 (quoting New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 75). \n \n\n26 \nBut here again the cited decision merely confirmed that the \n1996 Act expanded the Commission’s intrastate regulatory \nauthority within the limited parameters of § 276. The New \nEngland  court  held  that  Congress  had  authorized  the \nCommission  to  carry  out  the  anti-subsidy  and  anti-\ndiscrimination mandates of § 276(b)(1)(D)–(E) as to both inter- \nand intrastate payphone providers because Congress intended \n§ 276 as a whole to “authorize the Commission to eliminate \nbarriers to competition.” 334 F.3d at 77. But when pressed to \nextend § 276’s anti-subsidy and anti-discrimination mandates \nto non-BOC carriers, the court said, “the fact remains that \nsections  276(a)  and  276(b)(1)(C),  the  sources  of  the \nCommission’s authority to regulate intrastate payphone rates, \nexpressly apply only to the BOCs.” Id. at 78. The court was \nalso clear in saying that outside the specific directives of § 276, \ngeneral provisions “cannot . . . trump section 152(b)’s specific \ncommand that no Commission regulations shall preempt state \nregulations unless  Congress  expressly  so  indicates.  Absent \nauthorization to apply its section 276 regulations to non-BOC \n[carriers], the Commission may not regulate their intrastate \npayphone line rates.” Id. (citation omitted). \n \nThus,  neither  Illinois  nor  New  England  stands  for  the \nproposition that the Commission has broad plenary authority to \nregulate and cap intrastate rates. Rather these decisions confirm \nthe limited scope of § 276 which must be applied within the \nexpress bounds of its specific directives.  \n \nThe Order’s misconstruction of our case law stems from its \nfundamental misreading of § 276. The Order acknowledges \nthat the Commission’s authority over intrastate calls is, “except \nas  otherwise  provided  by  Congress,  generally  limited  by \nsection [152(b)] of the Act.” Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12814. The \nCommission thus recognized that to assert jurisdiction over \nintrastate rates, the 1996 Act must “unambiguously appl[y] to \n \n\n27 \nintrastate services.” Id. The Order errs, however, in concluding \nthat § 276 required it “to broadly craft regulations to ‘promote \nthe  widespread  development  of  payphone  services  for  the \nbenefit of the general public,’” and that this constituted a \n“general  grant  of  jurisdiction.”  Id.  (quoting  47  U.S.C.  § \n276(b)(1)). This misreads the language of § 276. The statute \nmerely commands the Commission, “[i]n order to promote \ncompetition among payphone service providers and promote \nthe widespread deployment of payphone services to the benefit \nof the general public,” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1), to prescribe \nregulations  to  accomplish  “five  specific  steps  toward  that \ngoal,” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71. This is not a “general \ngrant of jurisdiction” over intrastate ratemaking.  \n \nThe Order at issue in this case is legally infirm because it \npurports to cap intrastate rates based on a “just, reasonable and \nfair” test that is not enunciated in the statute, conflates distinct \ngrants of authority under § 201 and § 276, and misreads our \njudicial precedent and the FCC’s own prior orders to support \ncapping already compensatory rates under the guise of ensuring \nproviders  are  “fairly  compensated.”  The  point  here  is \nstraightforward: \n \nThe FCC’s belief that lower ICS calling rates reflect \ndesirable social policy cannot justify regulations that \nexceed  its  statutory  mandate.  Section  276  of  the \nCommunications Act authorizes the FCC to ensure that \nICS providers are not deprived of fair compensation \nfor the use of their payphones; § 201 authorizes it to \nensure that rates for and in connection with interstate \ntelecommunications services are just and reasonable. \nThe  FCC  may  not  ignore  these  statutory  limits  to \nadvance its preferred correctional policy. \n \nJoint Br. for Pet’rs at 4. \n \n\n28 \nWe therefore reverse and vacate the provision in the Order \nthat purports to cap intrastate rates as beyond the statutory \nauthority of the Commission. We need not decide the precise \nparameters of the Commission’s authority under § 276. We \nsimply  hold  here  that  the  agency’s  attempted  exercise  of \nauthority in the disputed Order cannot stand. \n \nD.  The Categorical Exclusion of Site Commission Costs  \n \nThe Petitioners contend that: \n \nThe FCC’s exclusion of site commission payments \nfrom the costs used to set ICS rate caps was unlawful. \nICS  providers  are  required  by  state  and  local \ngovernments and correctional institutions to pay site \ncommissions;  those  commissions  are  accordingly  a \ncost of providing service like other state taxes and fees \nthat the FCC recognizes as recoverable costs. The FCC \nacknowledged  that,  taking  site  commissions  into \nconsideration,  the  rate  caps  were  below  providers’ \ncosts. This violates the FCC’s obligation to “ensure \nthat  all  payphone  service  providers  are  fairly \ncompensated,” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A), § 201’s “just \nand reasonable” requirement, and the Constitution’s \nTakings Clause. \n \nJoint Br. for Pet’rs at 16. The concerns raised by Petitioners \nare compelling.  \n \nThe  Commission’s  categorical  exclusion  of  site \ncommissions from the calculus used to set ICS rate caps defies \nreasoned decisionmaking because site commissions obviously \nare costs of doing business incurred by ICS providers. Yet, the \nOrder categorically excluded site commissions and then “set \nthe rate caps below cost.” Id. at 20. This is hard to fathom. “An \n \n\n29 \nagency acts arbitrarily or capriciously if it has . . . offered an \nexplanation either contrary to the evidence before the agency \nor so implausible as not to reflect either a difference in view or \nagency  expertise.”  Defs.  of  Wildlife  &  Ctr.  for  Biological \nDiversity v. Jewell, 815 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citing State \nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43). Ignoring costs that the Commission \nacknowledges to be legitimate is implausible. \n \nThe FCC’s suggestion that site commissions “have nothing \nto do with the provision of ICS,” Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12822 \n(internal quotation marks omitted), makes no sense in light of \nthe  undisputed  record  in  this  case.  In  some  instances, \ncommissions are mandated by state statute, Rates for Interstate \nInmate Calling Services, 27 FCC Rcd. 16629, 16643 (2012), \nand  in  other  instances  commissions  are  required  by  state \ncorrectional institutions as a condition of doing business with \nICS providers, 17 FCC Rcd. at 3252–53. “If agreeing to pay \nsite commissions is a condition precedent to ICS providers \noffering their services, those commissions are ‘related to the \nprovision of ICS.’” Joint Br. for Pet’rs at 21. And it does not \nmatter that the states may use the commissions for purposes \nunrelated to the activities of correctional facilities. The ICS \nproviders who are required to pay the site commissions as a \ncondition of doing business have no control over the funds once \nthey  are  paid.  None  of  the  other  reasons  offered  by  the \nCommission  to  justify  the  categorical  exclusion  of  site \ncommissions passes muster.  \n \nOn the record before us, we simply cannot comprehend the \nagency’s reasoning. Where, as here, an agency’s “explanation \nfor its determination . . . lacks any coherence,” we owe “no \ndeference  to  [the  agency’s]  purported  expertise.”  Tripoli \nRocketry Ass’n v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and \nExplosives, 437 F.3d 75, 77 (D.C. Cir. 2006); see also Coburn \nv. McHugh, 679 F.3d 924 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Not only does the \n \n\n30 \nFCC’s  reasoning  defy  comprehension,  the  categorical \nexclusion of site commissions cannot be easily squared with \nthe requirements of § 276 and § 201. We therefore vacate this \nportion of the Order. \n \nIn its 2016 Reconsideration Order, the Commission raised \nthe  rate  caps  specifically  to  account  for  a  portion  of  site \ncommissions,  effectively  acknowledging  that  a  categorical \nexclusion of site commissions from the ratemaking calculus is \nimplausible. The Commission said:  \n \n[W]e have decided, out of an abundance of caution, to \ntake  a  more  conservative  approach  and  expressly \naccount  for  facilities’  ICS-related  costs  when \ncalculating our rate caps. Accordingly, we grant the \nHamden Petition in part . . . and increase our interstate \nand  intrastate  rate  caps  to  expressly  account  for \nreasonable facility costs related to ICS.  \n \nReconsideration Order, 31 FCC Rcd. at 9302. Although the \nFCC purported to change its position in the Reconsideration \nOrder, that order does not moot Petitioner’s challenge here. \nSee, e.g., N.E. Fla. Contractors v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 663, \n662 (1993) (replacing the challenged law “with one that differs \nonly  in  some  insignificant  respect”  and  “disadvantages \n[petitioners] in the same fundamental way” does not moot the \nunderlying challenge).  \n \nThe Reconsideration Order is not before us, so we cannot \nsay whether it provides a satisfactory response to Petitioners’ \nchallenge.  We  will  leave  this  for  the  Commission’s \nconsideration on remand. We also leave it to the Commission \nto assess on remand which portions of site commissions might \nbe  directly  related  to  the  provision  of  ICS  and  therefore \nlegitimate,  and  which  are  not.  In  addition,  although  we \n \n\n31 \nconclude that the Order at issue here is arbitrary and capricious \ninsofar as it categorically excludes site commissions from the \nratemaking calculus, we do not reach Petitioners’ remaining \narguments that the exclusion of site commissions denies ICS \nproviders  fair  compensation  under  §  276  and  violates  the \nTakings Clause of the Constitution because it forces providers \nto  provide  services  below  cost.  These  matters  should  be \naddressed by the Commission on remand once it revisits the \nexclusion of site commissions from the ratemaking calculus.  \n \nE.  The  Legality  of  the  FCC’s  Use  of  Industry-Wide \nAverages in Setting Rate Caps \n \nPetitioners contend that: \n \nEven if site commissions are disregarded, the rate \ncaps were set too low to ensure compensation “for each \nand  every  completed  .  .  .  call.”  [47  U.S.C.  § \n276(b)(1)(A)].  The  FCC’s  caps  are  below  average \ncosts  documented  by  numerous  ICS  providers  and \nwould deny cost recovery for a substantial percentage \nof  all  inmate  calls.  The  FCC’s  assertion  that  ICS \nproviders  with  costs  above  the  caps  operate \ninefficiently is contrary to the record. The FCC relied \non two outlier ICS providers that — combined — \nrepresent 0.1 percent of the ICS market. And it ignored \nevidence showing that the cost to provide ICS varies \nwidely on the basis of regional differences, such as the \nage and condition of a given facility or the specific \nsecurity features that correctional authorities demand. \n \n* * * * \n \nThe  record  includes  two  economic  analyses,  both \nconcluding that the Order’s rate caps are below cost \n \n\n32 \nfor  a  substantial  number  of  ICS  calls  even  after \nexcluding site commissions. . . . \n \nThe Order does not challenge these studies or their \nconclusions. On the contrary, it acknowledges that \nseven of 14 ICS providers that submitted cost data \nreported per-minute costs of “$0.25 or higher,” above \nthe highest prepaid rate cap of $0.22 per minute.  \n \nJoint Br. for Pet’rs at 16–17, 30–31 (quoting Order, 30 FCC \nRcd. at 12669–70, 12795). Petitioners’ claims are well taken \nand largely undisputed. And, as noted above, the FCC has \nabandoned its contention that the agency lawfully considered \nindustry-wide averages in setting the rate caps, and for good \nreasons.  \n \nFirst, to the extent that the Order purports to set caps for \nintrastate rates, it is infirm for the reasons stated above. Second, \nthe  averaging  calculus  is  patently  unreasonable.  The  FCC \ncalculated its rate caps “using a weighted average per minute \ncost,” Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12790, allowing providers to \n“recover average costs at each and every tier,” id. n.170. This \nmakes calls with above-average costs in each tier unprofitable, \nhowever, and thus does not fulfill the mandate of § 276 that \n“each  and  every”  inter-  and  intrastate  call  be  fairly \ncompensated. See Am. Pub. Commc’ns Council v. FCC, 215 \nF.3d 51, 54, 57–58 (D.C. Cir. 2000). \n \nMoreover, the Order advances an efficiency argument –\nthat the larger providers can become profitable under the rate \ncaps if they operate more efficiently – based on data from the \ntwo smallest firms. See Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12790–95. Not \nonly do those firms represent less than one percent of the \nindustry,  but  the  record  shows  that  regional  variation,  not \nefficiency, accounts for cost discrepancies among providers. \n \n\n33 \nSee id. at 12965 n.61 (dissenting statement of Commissioner \nPai). The Order does not account for these conflicting record \ndata.  \n \nIn sum, the Order’s analysis of the record data in setting \nrate caps was not the product of reasoned decisionmaking. We \nwill therefore vacate that portion of the Order and remand for \nfurther proceedings. \n \nF.  The Imposition of Ancillary Fee Caps  \n \nContrary  to  Petitioners’  contentions,  the  Order’s \nimposition of ancillary fee caps in connection with interstate \ncalls is justified. The Commission has plenary authority to \nregulate interstate rates under § 201(b), including “practices  \n. . . for and in connection with” interstate calls. The Order \nexplains that ICS providers use ancillary fees as a loophole in \navoiding per-minute rate caps. Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12842.  \nFurthermore, ancillary fees for interstate calls satisfy the test \nof the Commission’s authority under § 201(b) as they are “in \nconnection  with”  interstate  calls.  However,  these \nconsiderations do not fully answer the question whether the \ndisputed imposition of ancillary fee caps is permissible.  \n \nAs noted above, we have found that, on the record in this \ncase, the Order’s imposition of intrastate rate caps fails review \nunder § 276. Therefore, we likewise hold that the FCC had no \nauthority to impose ancillary fee caps with respect to intrastate \ncalls. However, we cannot discern from the record whether \nancillary  fees  can  be  segregated  between  interstate  and \nintrastate calls. We are therefore obliged to remand the matter \nto the FCC for further consideration.  \n \n \n\n34 \nG.  The Imposition of Reporting Requirements  \n \nThe  Commission  initially  contended  that  the  Order’s \nrequirements with respect to reporting requirements for video \nvisitation services and site commissions were unripe for review \nbecause they were pending budgetary approval by the Office \nof Management and Budget (“OMB”). After briefing, however, \nOMB approval was published. See 82 Fed. Reg. 12182-01 \n(Mar. 1, 2017). Accordingly, the Commission withdrew its \nripeness challenge. Letter, Global Tel*Link (D.C. Cir. Mar. 1, \n2017), ECF No. 1663705. Therefore, the parties agree that we \nmay  review  the  Commission’s  imposition  of  the  disputed \nreporting requirements. \n \nWe  hold  that  the  video  visitation  services  reporting \nrequirement, 47 C.F.R. § 64.6060(a)(4), is too attenuated to the \nCommission’s statutory authority to justify this requirement. \nThe Commission asserts that whether or not video visitation \nservices are a form of ICS, they are still subject to the agency’s \njurisdiction. See, e.g., Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12891–92; Br. for \nFCC at 56–57. We disagree. Before it may assert its jurisdiction \nto impose such a reporting requirement, the Commission must \nfirst  explain  how  its  statutory  authority  extends  to  video \nvisitation services as a “communication[] by wire or radio” \nunder § 201(b) for interstate calls or as an “inmate telephone \nservice” under § 276(d) for interstate or intrastate calls. The \nOrder under review offers no such explanations. We therefore \nvacate the reporting requirement for video visitation services. \n \nIn contrast, we find no merit in Petitioners’ challenge to \nthe site commission payment reporting requirement under 47 \nC.F.R. § 64.6060(a)(3). The quibble between the parties is \nlargely  over  semantics.  The  Commission  agrees  that  the \ndefinition of site commission payment should be read largely \nas Petitioners argue: namely, site commissions are “incentive \n \n\n35 \npayments  designed  to  influence  a  correctional  authority’s \nselection  of  its  monopoly  service  provider,  not  a  form  of \nordinary tax.” Br. for FCC at 59 (citing Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at \n12818–22). So defined, the reporting requirement is lawful on \nits face and Petitioners do not disagree. We therefore deny the \npetition for review.  \n \nH.  The Preemption and Due Process Claims \n \nPetitioner Pay Tel separately challenges the Commission’s \nrefusal to preempt certain state ICS rate caps that are lower than \nthose  the  Commission  set  in  the  Order.  Because  we  are \nvacating the portion of the Order imposing intrastate rate caps \nunder § 276(b), the preemption provision under § 276(c) is no \nlonger at issue. There are no relevant regulations under § 276 \nremaining in the Order with respect to which the lower state \nrate caps might be preempted. This issue is therefore moot.  \n \n  Pay Tel’s claim that its due process rights were infringed \nwhen it was not given timely access to key cost data that the \nFCC relied on in setting the rate caps is also moot. We are \nvacating the portion of the Order setting rate caps for intrastate \nrates;    the  Commission  has  acknowledged  that  its  use  of \nindustry-average  data  to  set  rates  was  error;  and  Pay  Tel \nobtained access to the disputed data prior to the Commission’s \nissuance of the  Reconsideration Order setting rate caps that \nsupersede those in the Order at issue. The concerns raised by \nPay Tel are thus moot.  \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \n \nIn accordance with the foregoing opinion, we grant in part \nand  deny  in  part  the  petitions  for  review,  vacate  certain \nprovisions  in  the  disputed  Order,  and  remand  for  further \n \n\n36 \nproceedings with respect to certain matters. We also dismiss \ntwo claims as moot. \n  \n                    So ordered.  \n \n \n\nSILBERMAN, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring: I concur\nwith Judge Edwards’ opinion in all respects.  I especially agree\nthat Chevron deference would be inappropriate in these unusual\ncircumstances.  I write separately to point out, as to the FCC’s\nclaimed jurisdiction to set intrastate rate caps, that I think our\nresult would be the same if the Chevron framework was in play,\ni.e., if the FCC had elected to defend this part of its regulation. \nThere is no question that the relevant statutory language,\n“fairly compensated,” is ambiguous.  47 U.S.C. 276(b)(1)(A). \nEven the FCC agrees.  But Judge Edwards’ careful explanation\nof the statute’s structure and context demonstrates that the\nagency’s interpretation would fail at Chevron’s second step; it\nis an unreasonable (impermissible) interpretation of section 276. \nMuch  of  the  recent  expressed  concern  about  Chevron\nignores  that  Chevron’s  second  step  can  and  should  be  a\nmeaningful limitation on the ability of administrative agencies\nto exploit statutory ambiguities, assert farfetched interpretations,\nand usurp undelegated policymaking discretion.1  This case\npresents just one example of those kinds of agency tactics. \nThere are others.  Accord Michigan v. EPA, — U.S. —, 135 S.\nCt. 2699, 2713 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) (“Although we\nhold  today  that  [the  agency]  exceeded  even  the  extremely\npermissive limits on agency power set by our precedents, we\n1  See, e.g., City of Arlington v. FCC, — U.S. —, 133 S. Ct. 1863\n(2013) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).  Of course, some also question “step\ntwo” itself.  For example, an essay in the Virginia Law Review\ncontended  that  “Chevron  Has  Only  One  Step.”    Matthew  C.\nStephenson & Adrian Vermeule, 95 Va. L. Rev. 597 (2009).  But that\nposition ignores the practical effect on future agency discretion of a\ncourt opinion either affirming or reversing an agency interpretation at\nstep one versus step two.  Cf. Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v.\nBrand  X  Internet  Servs.,  545  U.S.  967  (2005). \n\n2\nshould be alarmed that it felt sufficiently emboldened by those\nprecedents to make the bid for deference that it did here.”)\nTo be sure, some have lamented that as a practical matter,\nunder Chevron, either the case is decided at the first step or the\nagency prevails once it receives deference under step two.  But\nthat is not what the Chevron case called for.  \nChevron itself involved a phrase “stationary source” that\nwas not at all defined and clearly could equally refer to (a) a\nfactory complex, or (b) a specific emitter of pollution.  467 U.S.\n837, 860-64 (1984).  But it would have been unreasonable to\nrefer to (c) a whole city.  Yet too many times agencies have\ntaken advantage of an ambiguity to pursue a (c), (d), or (f)\ninterpretation that accorded with policy objectives.  See, e.g.,\nVerizon v. FCC, 740 F.3d 623, 660 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (Silberman,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n    \nUnfortunately, the  Supreme Court  for some time  after\nChevron contributed to the step one winner-take-all narrative by\nneglecting to rely on step two even when it was really called for. \nTake for example MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. AT&T Co.,\n512 U.S. 218 (1994), in which Justice Scalia—perhaps the\nforemost expositor of Chevron—used statutory structure and\ncontext,  much  like  Judge  Edwards  does  in  our  case,  to\ndemonstrate that the FCC’s reliance on the word “modify” was\nunacceptable, see, e.g., id. at 228-29.  But he never conceded\nthat the word “modify” was ambiguous, which it was.  Id. at 228\n(“We have not the slightest doubt that [single definition] is the\nmeaning the statute intended.”).  \nSubsequently, however, in AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities\nBoard, 525 U.S. 366 (1999), Justice Scalia implicitly relied on\nstep two.  He concluded that because the agency failed to\ninterpret the terms of the statute “in a reasonable fashion,” the\n\n3\nrule must be vacated.  Id. at 392.  Then, in City of Arlington v.\nFCC,  — U.S. —, 133 S. Ct. 1863 (2013), he admonished that\n“where Congress has established an ambiguous line, the agency\ncan go no further than the ambiguity will fairly allow,” id. at\n1874.  And most recently in Michigan v. EPA,  — U.S. —, 135\nS. Ct. 2699 (2015), when invalidating agency action under step\ntwo, he was more explicit still: “Chevron allows agencies to\nchoose among competing reasonable interpretations of a statute;\nit does not license interpretive gerrymanders under which an\nagency keeps parts of statutory context it likes while throwing\naway parts it does not,” id. at 2708. \nWe have at times been careful to apply step two review\nvigorously.  See, e.g., Goldstein v. SEC, 451 F.3d 873 (D.C. Cir.\n2006).  This is just such a case where the agency’s original\nclaim  for  Chevron  deference—before  the  agency’s  control\nswitched—would have been rejected at Chevron step two; a\nmuscular  use  of  that  analysis  is  a  barrier  to  inappropriate\nadministrative adventure.  \n\n \nPILLARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting as to Sections II.B \nthrough II.F and concurring in part:   \nThe administrative record is full of compelling evidence \nof dysfunction in the inmate-calling marketplace, with harsh \nconsequences for inmates and their families.  The rule under \nreview began with a 2000 lawsuit filed by inmates, family \nmembers,  loved  ones,  and  counsel  (referred  to  in  these \nproceedings as the Wright Petitioners).  Finally acting on the \nWright  Petitioners’  concerns,  the  FCC  in  2015  modestly \ncurtailed  exorbitant  per-minute  calling  rates  and  limited \nproviders’ ability to extract confusing and unrelated ancillary \nfees—amounting to as much as 38 percent of total inmate-\ncalling revenue—for such things as setting up an account, \nfunding an account, issuing a refund, and closing an account.  \nSee 30 FCC Rcd. 12763, 12838-42 (2015).  The record shows \nthat  these  high  prices  impair  the  ability  of  inmates,  by \ndefinition isolated physically from the outside world, to sustain \nfragile filaments of connection to families and communities \nthat they might hope to rejoin.  The majority’s decision scuttles \na  long-term  effort  to  rein  in  calling  costs  that  are  not \nmeaningfully  subject  to  competition  and  that  profit  off  of \ninmates’ desperation for connection. \nThe majority’s path to that result is flawed.  I cannot agree \nthat  a  company  is  “fairly  compensated”  under  47  U.S.C. \n§ 276(b)(1)(A) when it charges inmates exorbitant prices to use \npayphones inside prisons and jails, shielded from competition \nby a contract granting it a facility-wide payphone monopoly.  \nThe  majority  does  not  question  that  Congress  enacted  the \nTelecommunications  Act  of  1996  to  combat  phone \nmonopolies, facilitate competition, and thereby ensure better \nservice at lower prices to consumers.  Consistent with the 1996 \nAct’s  general  approach  of  “replac[ing]  a  state-regulated \nmonopoly  system  with  a  federally  facilitated,  competitive \nmarket,” section 276 of the Act specifically addressed defects \nin the intrastate and interstate payphone market (now largely \nobsolete  except  in  cellphone-free  environments  such  as \n \n\n2 \nprisons).  New England Pub. Commc’ns Council, Inc. v. FCC, \n334 F.3d 69, 77 (D.C. Cir. 2003). \nThe  majority  holds  it  beyond  debate  that  “fairly \ncompensated” is not about fairness to the consumer.  It sees no \nstatutory support for the FCC’s effort to require fairer intrastate \nrates  for  inmates  because  it  reads  section  276’s  fair-\ncompensation  mandate  as  unambiguously  one-sided,  only \nempowering the FCC to enhance unfairly low, not to reduce \nunfairly  high,  compensation  for  calls.    It  accepts  Global \nTel*Link’s characterization of section 276 as nothing but a “no \nfree calls” provision, Oral Arg. Tr. 40:55, confined to the \nenacting Congress’s acknowledged concern about independent \npayphone providers going uncompensated for certain calls.  \nBut that reading is truncated.  As it typically does, Congress \nresponded to a particular problem by enacting a law that speaks \nin more general terms:  here, by requiring that payphone calls \nin prisons and elsewhere be “fairly compensated.”  It did so for \nthe  stated  purpose—fully  relevant  here—of  promoting \ncompetition  among  payphone  providers  to  expand  the \navailability of payphone services to consumers.  47 U.S.C. § \n276(b)(1). \nThe majority offers one plausible reading of section 276, \nbut it is assuredly not the only one.  Congress has not “directly \nspoken to the precise question at issue” in this case, so the \nquestion for us is whether the FCC’s view when it promulgated \nthe challenged rule—that section 276 grants authority not only \nto  raise  inadequate  rates  but  also  to  reduce  excessive, \nmonopoly-driven rates—was a “permissible construction of \nthe statute.”  Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).  I think it was.  If the FCC \nunder new management wishes by notice and comment to \nchange its rule, the statute gives it latitude to do so.  We should \nuphold the rule that is on the books and leave to the agency to \ndecide whether and how to change it. \n \n\n3 \nI. \nThe FCC reasonably interpreted section 276 to “authorize \nthe Commission to impose intrastate rate caps as prescribed in \nthe Order.”  Op. at 20-21.  Congress instructed the FCC to \n“establish  a  per  call  compensation  plan  to  ensure  that  all \npayphone service providers are fairly compensated for each \nand every completed intrastate and interstate call using their \npayphone[s].”  47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A).  To begin with, \nnobody  contests  that  authority  to  establish  “a  per  call \ncompensation plan” includes some authority over end-user \ncalling rates.  Indeed, this court already so held.  See Illinois \nPublic Telecommunications Ass’n v. FCC, 117 F.3d 555, 562 \n(D.C. Cir. 1997) (“Because … there is no indication that the \nCongress intended to exclude local coin rates from the term \n‘compensation’  in  §  276,  we  hold  that  the  statute \nunambiguously grants the Commission authority to regulate \nthe rates for local coin calls.”).  And the plain text of the statute \ngrants  that  authority  over  both  intrastate  and  interstate \npayphone  services,  including  “inmate  telephone  service  in \ncorrectional institutions.”  47 U.S.C. § 276(d).  Thus, the only \ndispute is whether the word “fairly” implies an ability to reduce \nexcesses, as well as bolster deficiencies, in the compensation \nthat payphone providers would otherwise receive. \nImportantly,  Congress  chose  “fairly”  rather  than,  say, \n“adequately,” “sufficiently,” or “amply.”  Those words have \ndifferent meanings.  Had it used any of the latter three terms, I \nwould  agree  that  Congress  only  authorized  regulation  to \nprevent under-compensation, but its choice of the word “fairly” \ndenotes  no  such  limitation.    Compare  WEBSTER’S  NEW \nCOLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 407 (1980) (defining “fair” as, inter \nalia, “marked by impartiality and honesty: free from self-\ninterest, prejudice, or favoritism”), with id. at 14 (defining \n“adequate”  as,  inter  alia,  “sufficient  for  a  specific \nrequirement”), and id. at 1156 (defining “sufficient” as, inter \n \n\n4 \nalia, “enough to meet the needs of a situation or a proposed \nend”).  Those words are also used differently in everyday \nlanguage.  See Schindler Elevator Corp. v. U.S. ex rel. Kirk, \n563 U.S. 401, 407 (2011) (court looks to “ordinary meaning” \nin absence of statutory definition).  If a grocer demanded $20 \nfor a banana, we might call that price adequate, sufficient, or \nample—but nobody would call it fair.   \nThe statutory context shows that Congress’ choice of the \nword  “fairly”  reasonably  connotes  its  concern  for  unfairly \nexcessive as well as deficient compensation.  Elsewhere in the \nCommunications  Act,  Congress  used  the  term  “fair”  in \nconjunction with “just” and “reasonable”—familiar terms of \nart used in connection with rate-setting authority.  See 47 \nU.S.C. § 204(b) (providing for partial authorization of new \ncharges,  which  would  otherwise  be  stayed,  if  the  FCC \ndetermines “that such partial authorization is just, fair, and \nreasonable”); id. § 205(a) (authorizing the FCC to prescribe \n“what classification, regulation, or practice is or will be just, \nfair, and reasonable”).  And the fact that section 276 is one of \nseveral  “Special  Provisions  Concerning  Bell  Operating \nCompanies,” see Op. at 9, does not suggest that Congress \nexclusively  intended  to  regulate  the  relationship  between \nBOCs and non-BOCs to boost the latter’s compensation and \nwas wholly unconcerned about the risk that callers would be \ncharged excessive rates. \nThe purpose and history behind the congressional action \nhere comport with this reading of the statutory text and context.  \nIn passing the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Congress aimed \nto “promot[e] competition in the payphone service industry.”  \nNew England, 334 F.3d at 71; see also 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1) \n(stating congressional purpose “to promote competition among \npayphone  service  providers  and  promote  the  widespread \ndeployment of payphone services to the benefit of the general \npublic”).    To  be  sure,  the  immediate  anti-competitive \n \n\n5 \nmalfunction confronting Congress at the time was that certain \npayphone providers were, under certain circumstances, under-\ncompensated.  See Illinois Pub. Telecomms. Ass’n v. FCC, 752 \nF.3d 1018, 1026 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  But the central aim was to \nadvance competition to the benefit of the end users of payphone \nservices.  Senator Kerry, for instance, explained that his goal in \nintroducing section 276 was “to establish a level playing field \nfor independent payphone providers,” and thereby to enable \ncompetition “on the basis of price, quality and service, rather \nthan on marketshare and subsidies.”  3 Reams & Manz, Federal \nTelecommunications  Law:  A  Legislative  History  of  the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 \nStat. 56 (1996), at S710.   \nConsistent with that pro-competitive agenda, the FCC and \nthis court have long assumed that section 276 provides tools for \naddressing  monopoly  power  and  market  failure  in  the \npayphone market.  For instance, in Illinois, the state petitioners \nargued that the FCC had unlawfully ignored the problem of \n“locational  monopolies,”  that  is,  situations  in  which  a \npayphone  provider  “obtains  an  exclusive  contract  for  the \nprovision of all payphones at an isolated location, such as an \nairport, stadium, or mall, and is thereby able to charge an \ninflated rate for local calls made from that location.”  117 F.3d \nat 562.  We recognized that the FCC had not ignored the \nproblem of locational monopolies; it had simply “concluded \nthat it would deal with them if and when specific [providers] \nare shown to have substantial market power.”  Id.  Now, twenty \nyears  later,  the  FCC  has  identified  a  discrete  area  where \npayphone providers do have substantial market power: prisons \nand jails.  The inmate-calling market is, the FCC found, “a \nprime  example  of  market  failure”  because,  instead  of \ncompeting to reduce rates and improve services for callers, \nproviders compete to offer ever-higher site commissions to \ncorrectional  facilities  so  as  to  gain  monopoly  access  to  a \nliterally captive consumer base.  30 FCC Rcd. at 12765 & n.9.   \n \n\n6 \nNevertheless, the majority cites four considerations that \ninfluenced its rejection of the FCC’s claimed authority over \nintrastate inmate calling services.  Op. at 21-24.  None is \ncompelling.   \nFirst,  the  majority  notes  that  section  152(b)  “erects  a \npresumption against the Commission’s assertion of regulatory \nauthority over intrastate communications.”  Op. at 21 (citing \nLouisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 373 \n(1986)).  That is true, but section 276, by its plain terms, \n“overcom[es]  this  presumption.”    Op.  at  21.    Congress \ninstructed  the  FCC  to  ensure  fair  compensation  for  all \npayphone  calls—interstate  and  intrastate.    47  U.S.C.  § \n276(b)(1)(A).  To that end, Congress expressly provided for \npreemption of inconsistent state regulation.  Id. § 276(c).  This \ncase is thus unlike Louisiana, which held that federal power \nover depreciation charges pursuant to section 220 was limited \nto the interstate ratemaking context; it is simply not “possible” \nhere  that  section  276  “do[es]  no  more  than  spell  out  the \nauthority of the FCC . . . in the context of interstate regulation.”  \nLouisiana, 476 U.S. at 377.  Whatever section 276 means, it \napplies in both the interstate and intrastate contexts.  Cf. N.Y. \n& Pub. Serv. Comm’n of N.Y. v. FCC, 267 F.3d 91, 102-03 (2d \nCir. 2001) (concluding that section 251(e) clearly “grants the \nFCC authority to act with respect to those areas of intrastate \nservice  encompassed  by  the  terms  ‘North  American \nNumbering  Plan’  and  ‘numbering  administration,’”  and \napplying  Chevron  deference  to  agency’s  interpretation  of \n“what either term encompasses”). \nSecond, the majority says that “the Order erroneously \ntreats the Commission’s authority under § 201 and § 276 as \ncoterminous.”  Op. at 21.  My colleagues appear to draw that \nconclusion from the FCC’s repeated use of the phrase “just, \nreasonable, and fair”—an amalgam of the two provisions’ key \nterms.  As I read the Order, the bundling of those three words \n \n\n7 \nsimply reflects that the FCC’s authority over inmate calling \nderives from the sum of those authorizations.  The majority’s \ninference that the Order fails to respect the difference between \nsections 201 and 276, and in particular, fails to appreciate that \nsection 201 applies only to interstate rates, has no support in \nthe record. \nThird, the majority concludes that the FCC erred in finding \nsupport for its approach in prior agency orders.  Op. at 22-23.  \nThe  majority  says  that  “the  prior  orders  . . .  focused  on \npayphone  providers  and  carriers  to  determine  whether  the \nproviders were fairly compensated.”  Op. at 23.  But this court \nhas held that “compensation” includes end-user rates; it is not \nlimited to payments between payphone providers and carriers.  \nIllinois,  117  F.3d  at  562  (“[W]e  hold  that  the  statute \nunambiguously grants the Commission authority to regulate \nthe rates for local coin calls.”). \nFourth, the majority says the FCC mistakenly relied on this \ncourt’s decisions in Illinois and New England.  Op. at 24-26.  \nThe  majority  acknowledges  that  Illinois  “held  that  §  276 \nunambiguously  overrode  §  152(b)’s  presumption  against \nintrastate jurisdiction insofar as it granted the Commission \nauthority to ‘set’ reimbursement rates for local coin calls in \norder to ensure that payphone operators who were previously \nuncompensated  were  ‘fairly  compensated.’”    Op.  at  24.  \nAccording to the majority, however, setting rates to increase \nproviders’ compensation is different from reducing “already \ncompensatory rates.”  Op. at 25.  Yet Illinois ratified the FCC’s \nassertion of authority to regulate “locational monopolies.”  117 \nF.3d at 562.  The majority responds that the FCC never said it \nwould consider intrastate rate caps as the means of breaking up \nsuch monopolies.  See Op. at 25.  But the FCC, as we noted in \nIllinois,  “specifically  reserved  the  right  to  modify  its \nderegulation scheme, for example, by limiting the number of \ncompensable calls from each payphone.”  117 F.3d at 563.  \n \n\n8 \nLimiting the number of compensable calls per phone is, of \ncourse, economically similar to limiting the rate per call; either \nincentivizes broader deployment of payphones to maintain the \nsame revenue levels.  Thus, the FCC contemplated, and the \nCourt approved, just the sort of pro-consumer regulation the \nFCC eventually undertook in the Order under review.   \nPetitioners argue that in the rule at issue in Illinois, the \nFCC had merely claimed the authority “to adjust the per-call \ncompensation scheme that the FCC itself put in place to ensure \nfair  compensation,”  not  the  “authority  to  regulate  existing \nmarket  rates.”    ICS  Pet’rs  Br.  46  n.31.    That  is  a  false \ndichotomy.  Cf. Illinois, 117 F.3d at 563 (“A market-based \napproach is as much a compensation scheme as a rate-setting \napproach.”).  The bottom line is that the FCC anticipated the \nproblem of monopoly power in the provision of payphone \nservices,  and  this  Court  ratified  the  agency’s  authority  to \ncombat that problem by reducing providers’ compensation, \nincluding by adjusting end-user rates.  There is thus no basis \nfor  the  majority’s  contention  that  “the  FCC  consistently \nconstrued its authority over intrastate payphone rates as limited \nto  addressing  the  problem  of  under-compensation  for  ICS \nproviders.”  Op. at 5. \nThe majority also takes issue with the Order’s invocation \nof New England, but the FCC correctly relied on that precedent \nfor the limited point that “section 276 unambiguously and \nstraightforwardly authorizes the Commission to regulate [the \nBell Operating Companies’] intrastate payphone line rates.”  30 \nFCC Rcd. at 12815 (quoting 334 F.3d at 75).  The fact that the \nFCC and this court previously articulated section 276 authority \nin terms of generic rate regulation is relevant here.  And, \ncontrary to the majority, New England’s holding that section \n276(b)(1)(C) does not apply to non-Bell Operating Companies \nhas no resonance in this case.  The provision at issue here, \nsection 276(b)(1)(A), is indisputably applicable to non-BOCs:  \n \n\n9 \nit requires that “all payphone service providers [be] fairly \ncompensated.”  47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added). \nNone of this is to suggest that the FCC has the same “broad \nplenary authority to regulate and cap intrastate rates” that it has \nover interstate rates.  Op. at 26.  Notably, whereas section 201 \nbroadly requires that “[a]ll charges, practices, classifications, \nand  regulations  for  and  in  connection  with  [interstate] \ncommunication service[] shall be just and reasonable,” section \n276 is more narrowly focused on “compensation.”  The FCC \nsimply did not need “broad plenary authority” to conclude that \ninmate calling service providers charging as much as $56.00 \nfor a four-minute call, see Op. at 11, were not being “fairly \ncompensated.”   \nII.  \nThe majority also holds that the FCC’s complete exclusion \nof  site  commissions  from  its  cost  calculus  and  its  use  of \nindustry-wide averages were arbitrary and capricious.  See Op. \nat 28-33.  It is unclear why the majority finds it necessary to \naddress how the caps were calculated, given its rejection of the \nFCC’s power to cap at all.  In any event, the majority’s analysis \nis misguided.   \nRegarding  site  commissions,  the  majority  says  that \n“[i]gnoring costs that the Commission acknowledges to be \nlegitimate is implausible.”  Op. at 29.  But the FCC did not \nacknowledge site commissions as legitimate costs.  Quite to the \ncontrary, the FCC agreed with a commenter who described site \ncommissions as “legal bribes to induce correctional agencies to \nprovide ICS providers with lucrative monopoly contracts.”  30 \nFCC Rcd. at 12821.  In other words, the FCC viewed site \ncommissions not as real costs of doing business, but as “an \napportionment of profit” between providers and correctional \nfacilities.  Id. at 12822.  The majority suggests that if site \ncommissions are “directly related to the provision” of inmate \n \n\n10 \ncalling  services  in  that  they  are  conditions  of  receiving \ncontracts  to  provide  such  services,  they  are  “therefore \nlegitimate.”  Op. at 30.  That equation makes no sense; the fact \nthat a cost was charged under a prior regulatory regime cannot \nmean  the  agency  is  required  to  recognize  that  cost  as \n“legitimate” and is disempowered from regulating it.  \nSimply put, the fact that a state may demand them does not \nmake site commissions a legitimate cost of providing calling \nservices.    The  majority  asserts  that  “[i]n  some  instances, \ncommissions are mandated by state statute,” Op. at 29, but the \nrecord reflects that there is only one such statute, Tex. Gov’t \nCode  Ann.  §  495.027(a)(2).    That  statute  categorically \ndemands  site  commissions  of  at  least  40  per  cent  of  the \nprovider’s gross revenue, which only illustrates the problem \nthat site commissions are a form of monopoly rent not tied to \nactual costs.   \nIndeed, considering site commissions as a compensable \ncost would effectively negate the FCC’s authority to mitigate \nlocational monopolies.  Imagine that a payphone provider (in \nthe pre-cell phone era) contracted with a large stadium to \nprovide just three payphones, anticipating that its monopoly \nwould enable it to charge several dollars per minute while \nkicking back some percentage to the stadium.  Plainly, the \nstatutory goals of “competition” and “widespread deployment \nof payphone services” could be well served by a rule imposing \nreasonable, market-sensitive price caps to spur providers to \noffer more phones to maintain the same levels of revenue.  47 \nU.S.C. § 276(b)(1).  But any such price cap would be worthless \nif it had to be calculated to ensure that the provider could \ncontinue  its  kickbacks  to  the  stadium.    The  kickback \narrangement might, in some sense, be “related” to the provision \nof payphone services at the stadium, but it is not “reasonably” \nrelated  because  acceding  to  such  preexisting  contractual \nrelationships is inconsistent with the statutory scheme. \n \n\n11 \nOn  the  averaging  issue,  the  majority  concludes  that \nbecause the Order “makes calls with above-average costs . . . \nunprofitable,” it “does not fulfill the mandate of § 276 that \n‘each  and  every’  inter-  and  intrastate  call  be  fairly \ncompensated.”  Op. at 32.  This holding seems to follow from \nthe majority’s pinched interpretation of section 276 as a one-\nway ratchet whereby providers are always entitled to recoup \n“actual” costs incurred under monopoly conditions, no matter \nhow extravagant.  As I have explained, I believe that section \n276 conveys some authority to lower rates, which means the \nFCC need not take as given “calls with above-average costs.”  \nAdditionally, the majority fails to reckon with the FCC’s \nindependent authority to cap rates for interstate calls under \nsection 201, despite acknowledging that this power is “broad” \nand “plenary.”  Op. at 26.  In my view, the FCC has wide \ndiscretion under its section 201 “just and reasonable” interstate \nratemaking authority to decide which costs to take into account \nand  to  use  industry-wide  averages  that  do  not  necessarily \ncompensate “each and every” call, as section 276 requires.  See \nNat’l Ass’n of Regulatory Util. Comm’rs v. FERC, 475 F.3d \n1277,  1280  (D.C.  Cir.  2007)  (agency  is  not  “weaponless \nagainst conduct that might encourage or cloak the running up \nof  unreasonable  costs”).    As  the  state  petitioners  aptly \nsummarized,  section  201  “gave  the  Commission  broad \nregulatory  authority  over  interstate  communication  in  a \n‘traditional form,’ mirroring regulation of railroads and public \nutilities, enabling it to set rates to allow a monopolistic utility \nto recover a reasonable profit but also protect the consumer \nfrom unjustly high prices.”  State Pet’rs Br. at 28-29.  The \nmajority  never  explains  why  the  FCC’s  rate-setting \nmethodology would be impermissible as to the interstate caps. \nIII.  \nFinally, I note that the majority offers no persuasive reason \nfor abandoning the Chevron framework (which it admittedly \n \n\n12 \ndoes only in dicta, as Chevron deference plays no role in an \nopinion holding section 276 unambiguous).  It acknowledges \nthat the Order is “presumptively subject” to deferential review, \nbut then concludes that “it would make no sense for this court \nto determine whether the disputed agency positions advanced \nin the Order warrant Chevron deference when the agency has \nabandoned those positions.”  Op. at 18.  Absent any briefing on \nthe subject or any citation to precedent, I cannot agree. \nThe FCC, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, took \ncertain positions—most notably that section 276 authorizes \nregulation of the fairness of intrastate inmate-calling rates—\nand defended them vigorously in briefing before this court.  \nLess than a month before argument, the court on its own motion \ndirected the parties to explain whether this case should be held \nin abeyance in light of recent personnel changes at the FCC.  \nThe FCC responded that the court should “move forward on \nthe current schedule.”  Doc. No. 1656116 (Jan. 17, 2017).  Two \nweeks  later,  and  just  a  week  before  argument,  the  FCC \ninformed us that it would no longer defend certain points that \nit had briefed, but that the Wright Petitioners would “defend all \naspects of the Order.”  Doc. No. 1658521 (Jan. 31, 2017).  The \nFCC has not committed to formally reviewing the Order, as \nother similarly situated agencies have recently done.  See, e.g., \nMurray Energy Corp. v. EPA, No. 15-1385, Doc. No. 1670218 \n(April 7, 2017) (requesting postponement of oral argument so \nthat  agency  could  “fully  review”  the  relevant  rule).    By \nsuggesting  that  agencies  can  relinquish  judicial  deference \nthrough such limited and belated maneuvers as refusing to \ndefend  portions  of  their  briefs  during  oral  argument,  the \nmajority risks enabling agencies to end-run the principle that \nthey must “use the same procedures when they amend or repeal \na rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance.”  Perez \nv. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1206 (2015).  \n* * *  \n \n\n13 \nThe majority appears to leave an opening for the FCC—\non some other record and by some other reasoning—to rein in \nexcessive inmate-calling rates, both interstate and intrastate.  \nSee Op. at 20, 29, 32 (limiting its analysis to the record in this \ncase).  And the majority invites the FCC to determine whether \nsome “portions of site commissions” are illegitimate and non-\ncompensable.    Op.  at  30.    Still,  because  the  majority \nshortchanges  the  FCC’s  authority  to  reduce  excessive, \nmonopoly-driven  rates,  finds  “implausible”  the  agency’s \nreasoned  approach  to  a  grave  problem,  and  unnecessarily \nsuggests  limitations  on  Chevron  deference,  I  respectfully \ndissent from Sections II.B through II.F of the majority opinion.   \n ",
