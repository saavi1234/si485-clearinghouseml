    "summary": "<p>On December 4, 2017, two inmates of Pierce County Jail (PCJ) with mental health issues brought this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The plaintiffs sued Pierce County and the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department under 42 U.S.C. §1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Washington, sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Ronald B. Leighton, and referred to Magistrate Judge David W. Christel.</p><p>The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The complaint alleged that the defendants did not adequately screen for mental illness during the booking process or during incarceration, ignored clear signs of mental illness and requests for care and, and, as a result, routinely failed to document serious mental health symptoms, psychiatric medications, and treatment history. As such, the plaintiffs’ mental illnesses were allowed to progress unchecked, leading to hallucinations, delusions, and an increased risk of self-harm. The complaint also alleged that the defendants \"routinely warehouse these individuals in solitary confinement for 21 to 24 hours a day,\" and that they have a formal written policy of placing people with “poor behavioral control due to a mental disorder” in “crisis cells” for 23 hours a day. </p><p>On December 21, 2017, after filing and withdrawing two motions to certify class, the plaintiffs filed a third motion to certify class, defining the class as: “All qualified individuals who have mental illnesses that are disabilities as defined in 42 U.S.C. §12102 and 29 U.S.C. §705(9)(B), and who are now, or will be in the future, incarcerated at the Pierce County Jail.” </p><p>On February 2, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, among other claims, the plaintiffs' §1983 claim of inadequate mental health treatment. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their administration of psychiatric medication upon release claim because they fail to show the existence of an imminent injury. </p><p>On March 28, 2018, Judge Leighton granted in part the defendant’s motion to dismiss, dismissing the claims against the named agents of the county but retaining the claims against Pierce County and Pierce County Sheriff’s Department. On May 7, 2018, adopting a report and recommendation by Magistrate Judge Christel, Judge Leighton dismissed the complaint without prejudice for lack of standing.</p><p>On May 11, 2018, however, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration and relief from judgment, arguing that the court mistakenly dismissed the entirety of the complaint instead of the limited dismissal (one claim for lack of standing) sought by the defendants. On May 15, 2018, Judge Leighton granted the motion for reconsideration, saying that the dismissal was an inadvertent administrative error. The defendants filed their answer to the complaint with the court on May 12, 2018, and discovery continued.</p><p>On June 7, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to strike plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The motion alleged that plaintiffs' failed to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(A) and Local Civil Rule 23(i)(3) in their unilateral decision to re-note the motion to certify, resulting in a delay tactic that was prejudicial to the defendants. In an order issued on August 3, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion and additionally ruled against the plaintiffs on a pending discovery motion. The order specified that although the motion to certify was stricken, the class allegations would remain in the complaint and permitted the plaintiffs to file a motion requesting enlargement of time to file a renewed motion to certify. As such, the plaintiffs amended and renewed their motion for class certification on August 29, 2018. </p><p>After a period of discovery, Magistrate Judge David W. Christel issued his report and recommendations on the motion for class certification on October 15, 2018. He recommended that the certification be denied because plaintiffs had failed to meet the numerosity and commonality requirements. Additionally, he found that the plaintiffs failed to meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), which requires that the defendant acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole. Here, there were too many disparate and individualized issues regarding mental health such that the class lacked cohesiveness.</p><p>On October 25, 2018, the parties jointly stipulated for dismissal with prejudice, with all parties bearing their own costs. The case officially closed on October 29, 2018. </p>",

INTRODUCTION \n20\nCOME NOW Plaintiffs Donald Bango (“Bango”) and Scott Bailey (“Bailey”) \n21\n22 (collectively “Plaintiffs”), by and through their below attorneys of records, and request the \n23\nCourt clarify the Order on Magistrate Judge David W. Christel’s Report and Recommendation \n24\n[Dkt. #43].  Magistrate Judge Christel recommended granting Defendants Pierce County and \n25\nPierce County Sheriff’s Department’s (collectively “Defendants”) Motion for 12(b)(1) \n26\nDismissal Regarding Administration of Psychiatric Medication to Outgoing Inmates (“Motion \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \nCLARIFICATION/RECONSIDERATION  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nAND RELIEF – PAGE 1 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\nNO. 3:17-CV-06002-RBL-DWC \n(206)624-2184\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 45   Filed 05/11/18   Page 2 of 4\n \n1 to Dismiss”) [Dkt. #41].  In its May 7, 2018 Order, the Court states, “[t]he Report and \n2\nRecommendation regarding dismissal is ADOPTED, and plaintiffs’ complaint is \n3\nDISMISSED without prejudice.” See Dkt. #43 at ¶1 (emphasis added).  The May 7, 2018 \n4\nOrder triggered the issuance of a judgment on May 10, 2018.  Dkt. #44.  However, the scope \n5\nof Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss was limited to one issue: whether Plaintiffs have Article III \n6\nstanding to bring their administration of psychiatric medication upon release claim. See Dkt. \n7\n8 #27; see also Magistrate Judge Christel’s Recommendation and Report at Dkt. #41. Because \n9\nDefendants sought no other relief and the Recommendation and Report is limited to one (1) of \n10\nseven (7) claims raised in the Complaint, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court clarify \n11\nand/or reconsider the Order of May 7, 2018, and provide relief from judgment.  Further, \n12\nPlaintiffs request that the Court clarify that Pierce County Sheriff’s Department remains a \n13\nDefendant in this action, see Dkt. #39, although the only Defendant listed in the heading of \n14\n15 the Court’s May 7, 2018 Order is Pierce County. See Dkt. #43.   \n16  \nII.  ARGUMENT \n17\n  “The court may correct a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission \n18\nwhenever one is found in a judgment, order, or other part of the record. The court may do so \n19\n20 on motion or on its own, with or without notice.”  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(a).  Further, the court \n21\nmay relieve a party from judgment based on mistake or inadvertence.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n22\n60(b).  Here, Plaintiffs believe the Court intended to only dismiss the claim that was the \n23\nsubject of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, and not the entire Complaint. To that extent, \n24\nPlaintiffs seek clarification and correction of the May 7, 2018 Order to reflect that only the \n25\nadministration of psychiatric medication upon release claim has been dismissed, and that the \n26\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \nCLARIFICATION/RECONSIDERATION  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nAND RELIEF – PAGE 2 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\nNO. 3:17-CV-06002-RBL-DWC \n(206)624-2184\n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 45   Filed 05/11/18   Page 3 of 4\n \n1 other claims remain before the Court.

INTRODUCTION \n22 1.  Plaintiffs, who are people with mental illness incarcerated in the Pierce County \n23 Jail (“the Jail”), bring this class action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of \nComplaint - 1  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 2 of 38\n \n1 themselves and all others similarly situated to seek judicial relief from the suffering and \n2 psychological harm they are experiencing at the hands of Defendants.   \n3 2.  Defendants have long known about the applicable legal standards that govern the \n4 treatment of individuals incarcerated with mental illness—in part because they were sued more \n5 than 20 years ago by a similar class of plaintiffs with similar claims.  Defendants nevertheless \n6 continue to violate constitutional and statutory law, correctional facility guidelines, and basic \n7 standards of human decency.   \n8 3.  Defendants do not adequately screen for mental illness during the booking \n9 process or during incarceration, ignore clear signs of mental illness and requests for care and, as \n10 a result, routinely fail to document serious mental health symptoms, psychiatric medications, and \n11 treatment history.   \n12 4.  Having failed to appropriately identify those who are mentally ill, Defendants \n13 then refuse to provide necessary treatment to Plaintiffs and others similarly situated for their \n14 mental illnesses.  Plaintiffs often go months without seeing a mental health provider, experience \n15 significant delays in receiving prescription psychiatric medications, and are denied basic mental \n16 health care, despite repeated requests for treatment. \n17 5.  As a direct result of Defendants’ practice of inappropriately delaying and refusing \n18 to provide basic mental health treatment, Plaintiffs’ mental illnesses are allowed to progress \n19 unchecked, leading to hallucinations, delusions, and an increased risk of self-harm.  \n20 6.  Instead of promptly providing necessary treatment, Defendants punish Plaintiffs \n21 and other similarly situated for non-violent behaviors directly related to their mental illnesses.  \n22 Defendants use eyebolt restraints to chain people’s arms and legs to the floor, deploy pepper \n23 spray, and leave people in the throes of mental health crises in restraint chairs for hours on end.    \nComplaint - 2  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 3 of 38\n \n1 7.  Despite the clinically proven negative impacts of isolation on people with mental \n2 illness, Defendants routinely warehouse these individuals in solitary confinement for 21 to 24 \n3 hours a day, where they predictably deteriorate.   \n4 8.  Defendants then compound these problems by refusing to provide people released \n5 from their custody with a supply of their psychiatric medications, as required by law.  \n6 Defendants release people with florid mental illness directly into the community, where they \n7 may present a safety risk to themselves or to others.  Due to their untreated illnesses, many will \n8 end up back at the Jail at taxpayer expense.   \n9 9.  Defendants’ failure to exercise appropriate supervisory authority over the Jail and \n10 to prevent the psychological deterioration of the most vulnerable in their care is plainly unlawful.  \n11 The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and the Fourteenth \n12 Amendment’s guarantee of due process together protect individuals’ right to be free from a \n13 substantial risk of serious harm while incarcerated.  These protections include the right to \n14 constitutionally adequate mental health treatment and the right to be free from the unnecessary \n15 and wanton infliction of pain.   \n16 10.  Moreover, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 \n17 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibit the use of solitary confinement up to warehouse people \n18 because of their mental illness, and requires that such individuals be provided with equal access \n19 to the programs, services, and activities offered in the Pierce County Jail.   \n20 11.  These federal laws prohibit the discriminatory use of force and restraints on \n21 people in response to non-violent behavior directly related to their mental illnesses, and require \n22 that Defendants make reasonable modifications to their policies, practices, and procedures to \n23 avoid discrimination on the basis of disability.   \nComplaint - 3  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 4 of 38\n \n1 12.  Defendants’ long-standing pattern and practice of neglect has directly caused \n2 serious ongoing irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals and contributes \n3 to a revolving door of incarceration that is both costly and detrimental to public safety.    \n4 13.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  \n5 II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6 14.  This Court has jurisdiction over the claims brought under federal law pursuant to \n7 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1343.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ \n8 1343, 2201, and 2202, 29 U.S.C. § 794a, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 12117(a).   \n9 15.  Venue is properly in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because \n10 Plaintiffs’ claims for relief arose in this District and one or all of the Defendants reside in this \n11 District.   \n12 III.  PARTIES \n13 A.  Named Plaintiffs  \n \n14 16.  Named Plaintiff Donald Bango is a 40-year old veteran who is incarcerated at the \n15 Pierce County Jail. Mr. Bango served in the United States military for fifteen years, including \n16 tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He achieved the rank of a Staff Sergeant, and received multiple \n17 awards for his service—including a Bronze Star, a Meritorious Service Medal, an Army \n18 Commendation for Valor, and an Army Achievement Medal.  Mr. Bango was medically retired \n19 from the military in 2010 due to mental health issues stemming from the violence he witnessed \n20 during his service in Iraq.   \n21 17.  Mr. Bango has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder \n22 (PTSD), major depressive disorder, and panic disorder, and is a qualified individual with a \n23 disability as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. §12102 and 29 U.S.C. §705(9)(B).  He experiences \nComplaint - 4  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 5 of 38\n \n1 visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing voices, as well as delusions and flashbacks.  \n2 He also experiences frightening nightmares that cause him to scream in his sleep, extreme mood \n3 swings, and panic attacks.   \n4 18.  Defendants have denied Mr. Bango medically necessary psychiatric medications \n5 and access to other basic mental health treatment during his incarceration.  They improperly \n6 placed him in solitary confinement and left him naked and alone in a cell with his arms \n7 handcuffed behind his back after pepper spraying his face.  The inappropriate use of isolation \n8 and force as well as the denial of care has caused Mr. Bango to mentally decompensate.  \n9 19.  Named Plaintiff Scott Bailey is a 45-year old man who is incarcerated in the \n10 Pierce County Jail.  Mr. Bailey has been diagnosed with major depression and experiences \n11 anxiety, and is a qualified individual with a disability as that that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. \n12 §12102 and 29 U.S.C. §705(9)(B).  Mr. Bailey regularly experiences suicidal ideation and has \n13 attempted to commit suicide many times.  \n14 20.  Mr. Bailey has been incarcerated at the Pierce County Jail approximately eight \n15 times since 1999.  Because Defendants placed Mr. Bailey on suicide watch during his \n16 incarceration in December 2014, including placing him in isolation with no clothing except a \n17 “suicide smock,” they have knowledge and are on notice of Mr. Bailey’s mental health issues \n18 and suicidal tendencies.   \n19 21.  Defendants have routinely failed to adequately screen Mr. Bailey’s mental health \n20 conditions, mental health history, and use of psychiatric medications.  Defendants have failed to \n21 provide Mr. Bailey with timely access to psychiatric medications or basic mental health \n22 treatment, despite his repeated requests.  Defendants have placed Mr. Bailey at an unreasonable \n23 risk of self-harm and psychological decompensation.    \nComplaint - 5  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 6 of 38\n \n1 B.  Defendants   \n \n2 22.  Defendant Pierce County (the “County” or “Pierce County”) is a municipality \n3 chartered under the laws of Washington, and is a public entity as that term is defined in 42 \n4 U.S.C. §12131(1). The County operates and manages the Pierce County Jail and by law retains \n5 ultimate authority over and responsibility for ensuring the health, safety, and welfare of Plaintiffs \n6 and the class they seek to represent in a manner that comports with all legal obligations.   \n7 23.  Defendant Bruce Dammeier is the Pierce County Executive.  As Pierce County’s \n8 chief executive officer, he is responsible for the supervision, management, review, and \n9 evaluation of all of Pierce County’s administrative offices and executive departments, including \n10 the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n11 24.  Defendant Pierce County Sheriff’s Department (the “Sheriff’s Department”) is a \n12 department of the Pierce County executive branch and is a public entity as that term is defined in \n13 42 U.S.C. §12131(1).  The Sheriff’s Department is responsible for the day-to-day operations of \n14 the Pierce County Jail, including promulgating and enforcing Jail policies, procedures, and \n15 customs, as well as ensuring that Sheriff’s Department deputies at the Jail comply with all legal \n16 obligations. \n17 25.  Defendant Paul A. Pastor is the Sheriff of Pierce County.  He is responsible for \n18 the supervision of the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department deputies in Pierce County, including \n19 the deputies that staff the Pierce County Jail.  He is also responsible for the proper execution of \n20 Sheriff’s Department policies and the training of Sheriff’s Department deputies.  Sheriff Pastor is \n21 sued in his official capacity.   \n22 26.  Defendant Patti Jackson-Kidder is the Pierce County Chief of Corrections.  She is \n23 responsible for the supervision of Pierce County Jail employees, the proper execution of Jail \nComplaint - 6  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 7 of 38\n \n1 policies, and the lawful treatment of individuals confined at the Jail.  Chief Jackson-Kidder is \n2 sued in her official capacity.   \n3 27.  Defendant Janet Rhoton is the Mental Health Manager at the Pierce County Jail.  \n4 She is responsible for the leadership, oversight, and clinical direction of the Mental Health \n5 Program staff to ensure their compliance with governing laws and regulations.  She is also \n6 responsible for ensuring that the Mental Health Program provides people incarcerated at the Jail \n7 a community standard of care and that ethical and professional standards of practice are \n8 maintained. Ms. Rhoton is sued in her official capacity.   \n9 IV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n10 Class Definition \n11 28.  All Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and, pursuant to Rule 23(a) and \n12 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of a class of all qualified individuals \n13 who have mental illnesses that are disabilities as defined in 42 U.S.C. §12102 and 29 U.S.C. \n14 §705(9)(B), and who are now, or will be in the future, incarcerated at the Pierce County Jail.   \n15 Numerosity: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n16 29.  The proposed class is sufficiently numerous that joinder of all members of the \n17 class is impracticable.  The exact size of the class is unknown, however it is estimated to number \n18 in the hundreds.  As of Friday, November 30, 2017, there were approximately 1,102 individuals \n19 incarcerated in the Pierce County Jail.  See Legal Information Network Exchange (LINX), Jail \n20 population for November 2017, available at \n21 https://linxonline.co.pierce.wa.us/linxweb/Reports/GetStaticReport.cfm?report_file=FormalCoun\n22 tList/201711.htm (last accessed Dec. 4, 2017).  According to the Federal Bureau of Justice \n23 Statistics, approximately 64 percent of individuals incarcerated in jail have a mental health issue, \nComplaint - 7  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 8 of 38\n \n1 see U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Special Report: Mental Health Problems of \n2 Prison and Jail Inmates, (revised Dec. 14, 2006), \n3 https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf, and one in four jailed individuals meet the \n4 criteria for “serious psychological distress.”  See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Bureau of Justice \n5 Statistics, Indicators of Mental Health Problems Reported by Prisoners and Jail Inmates, 2011–\n6 12 (June 2017), \n7 https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/imhprpji1112.pdf?utm_source=newsfrombjs&utm_medium\n8 =email&utm_content=imhprpji1112_report_pdf&utm_campaign=imhprpji1112&ed2f26df2d9c4\n9 16fbddddd2330a778c6=xbawkckbsa-xearbiza.  Further, approximately a quarter of individuals at \n10 the Pierce County Jail are on psychiatric medications.  See League of Women Voters of Tacoma-\n11 Pierce County, Study of Mental Health in Pierce County 35 (Feb. 2016), \n12 http://www.piercecountywa.org/DocumentCenter/View/42628.    \n13 Commonality: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n14 30.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class.  All class members are \n15 subject to Pierce County’s policies and practices that expose each one of them to a substantial \n16 risk of harm with the resulting common question of law being the violation of the U.S \n17 Constitution, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794).   \n18 Typicality: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n19 31.  The claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the members of the \n20 proposed class.  Plaintiffs and all other members of the class have sustained similar injuries \n21 arising out of and caused by Defendants’ policies, practices, procedures, and customs in violation \n22 of the law as alleged.   \n23  \nComplaint - 8  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 9 of 38\n \n1 Adequacy: Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n2 32.  Plaintiffs are members of the class and will fairly and adequately represent and \n3 protect the interests of the putative class members.  Plaintiffs’ counsel are experienced in class \n4 action and prisoners’ rights litigation, and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n5 class.  \n6 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)  \n7 33.  Because Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds that apply generally \n8 to the class, final injunctive relief and corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting \n9 the class as a whole.  \n10 V.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \n11 A.  Defendants Fail to Provide Adequate Mental Health Screening \n12 34.  Defendants routinely fail to identify and assess the mental health issues of people \n13 incarcerated at the Pierce County Jail.   \n14 35.  During the booking process, medical providers are required to perform a receiving \n15 mental health screening using a “Suicide Risk Assessment” form as well as a “General Mental \n16 Health Assessment” form.  These forms include various questions about current mental health \n17 and mental health history, including suicidal ideation and psychiatric medications.  Most \n18 questions have a check box next to it to designate a positive finding.  By design, these forms do \n19 not allow for negative findings.   \n20 36.  Medical providers often do not ask all of the questions on the mental health \n21 screening forms.  As a result, people are not screened for serious psychiatric conditions that \n22 require medically necessary treatment.   \n23\nComplaint - 9  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 10 of 38\n \n1 37.  After the initial receiving screening, Defendants do not provide any additional \n2 mental health screening to the general jail population. \n3 38.  Defendants’ failure to adequately screen for mental health conditions violates \n4 well-established national standards, including those published by the National Commission on \n5 Correctional Health Care (“NCCHC”), one of the foremost authorities on health care in jails.   \n6 39.  NCCHC’s 2014 “Standards for Health Services in Jails” require jails to inquire \n7 during the receiving screening into “[p]ast or current mental illness, including hospitalizations,” \n8 as well as any “[h]istory of or current suicidal ideation.”  See NCCHC Standard J-E-02 \n9 (Receiving Screening).  These inquiries are designed “to ensure that patients with known \n10 illnesses and those on medications are identified for further assessment and continued \n11 treatment.”  See id.   \n12 40.  Additionally, NCCHC standards require jails to provide a more comprehensive \n13 mental health screening for all inmates within 14 days of admission, including inquiries into \n14 psychiatric hospitalization, suicidal behavior and ideation, and psychotropic medications, with \n15 further referral for evaluation and treatment for individuals with positive mental illness screens.  \n16 See NCCHC Standard J-E-05 (Mental Health Screening and Evaluation).  This process includes \n17 compiling and reviewing medical records from community mental health providers to create a \n18 complete mental health history, and is designed to identify people with mental illness “soon after \n19 admission to prevent deterioration of their level of functioning and to [ensure that they] receive \n20 necessary treatment in a timely fashion.”  See NCCHC Standard J-E-04 (Initial Health \n21 Assessment), J-E-05. \n22 41.  In contrast to national standards, Defendants often fail to ask for and document \n23 information during the intake process that would identify people with mental illness for further \nComplaint - 10  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 11 of 38\n \n1 assessment and treatment. Defendants do not have a general practice of providing comprehensive \n2 mental health screenings for people booked into the Jail.   \n3 42.  Defendants also fail to screen for mental illness despite clear signs of mental \n4 decompensation and individuals’ repeated requests to be seen and evaluated.   \n5 43.  Defendants’ policies, practices, and procedures put Plaintiffs at an unreasonable \n6 risk of harm and psychological decompensation.   \n7 B.  Defendants Fail to Provide Adequate Mental Health Treatment \n8 44.  The Pierce County Jail has a “Mental Health Program” that claims to deliver \n9 “high quality, cost effective mental health services . . . for the at-risk mentally ill inmate.”  Pierce \n10 County, Mental Health Services, http://www.co.pierce.wa.us/2110/Mental-Health-Services (last \n11 accessed Dec. 4, 2017).   \n12 45.  This Program is managed by Defendant Janet Rhoton, and is budgeted for seven \n13 “Mental Health Evaluators” (“MHE,” also referred to as Mental Health Providers, or  \n14 “MHP”).  The qualifications to work as an MHE include a Master’s Degree in psychology, social \n15 work, or a related field, as well as state licensing.  No medical degree is required.  MHE’s are \n16 responsible for evaluating psychological conditions, developing treatment plans, screening \n17 referrals for psychiatric medications, and determining housing needs.  MHE’s cannot prescribe \n18 psychiatric medications and do not provide ongoing counseling.   \n19 46.  Pierce County Jail only has one doctor on staff, Dr. Miguel Balderrama, who also \n20 serves as the Medical Director.  He, along with one psychiatric nurse practitioner, prescribe the \n21 majority of psychiatric medications to people incarcerated in the Jail.   \n22 47.  No one on staff at the Jail is dedicated to providing mental health counseling. \n23\nComplaint - 11  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 12 of 38\n \n1 48.  Referrals to the Mental Health Program are made through requests for evaluation \n2 and triage made by deputies, the medical clinic, courts, friends, and family.  An inmate can also \n3 request a referral by filing a “kite” (a written request) at an electronic kiosk in their unit.   \n4 49.  According to policy, the Mental Health Program must triage referrals “on severity \n5 of need and acuity.”  If someone is “at imminent risk,” they must be seen immediately; “high” \n6 priority referrals must be seen within 48 to 72 hours.  There is no required time frame for \n7 responses to those judged to be “moderate” or “low” priority.   \n8 50.  People with severe mental illness, including hallucinations and suicidal ideations, \n9 often file multiple kites over a period of weeks or months without ever seeing a Mental Health \n10 Evaluator in person.   \n11 51.  Mental Health Evaluators correspond with people suffering from mental illness \n12 primarily through written “kites.” Evaluators rarely assess mental acuity in person.     \n13 52.  Instead, “kite” responses from Mental Health Evaluators often include “self-help” \n14 worksheets on breathing and stress-reduction techniques.  \n15 53.  When a Mental Health Evaluator does provides an in-person evaluation, these \n16 interactions are typically brief and do not provide basic mental health services.  \n17 54.  These practices and policies are counter to NCCHC standards, which require \n18 mental health services “available for all inmates who require them.”  According to NCCHC, \n19 basic mental health services include identification and referral of individuals with mental health \n20 needs, crisis intervention services, psychiatric medication management, individual counseling, \n21 group counseling, and other mental health programming, and treatment documentation and \n22 follow-up.  See NCCHC Standard J-G-04 (Basic Mental Health Services).   \n23\nComplaint - 12  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 13 of 38\n \n1 55.  These basic mental health services are necessary to “alleviate symptoms of \n2 serious mental disorders and prevent relapses to sustain patients’ ability to function safely in \n3 their environment.”  See id.   \n4 56.  According to the Jail’s website, medical staff is responsible for verifying “with a \n5 doctor’s office or pharmacy any prescriptions brought in by an incoming arrestee.”  See Pierce \n6 County, General Health Services, https://www.co.pierce.wa.us/2109/General-Health-Services \n7 (last visited Dec. 4, 2017). \n8 57.  In practice, people incarcerated in the Jail with current prescriptions experience \n9 delays of weeks or months in receiving their psychiatric medications, even though those \n10 prescriptions are easily verifiable.    \n11 58.  People incarcerated in the Jail without a current prescription are routinely denied \n12 necessary psychiatric medications for the entire length of their stay at the Jail.  They are often not \n13 evaluated for or prescribed psychiatric medications, regardless of need or medical history.   \n14 59.  The denial of necessary psychiatric medication significantly increases the risk of \n15 psychological decompensation and self-harm.  \n16 60.  Defendants’ denial of necessary psychiatric medications violates NCCHC \n17 standards that require jails to provide “prescribed medication in a timely, continuous, and \n18 clinically appropriate manner.”  See NCCHC Standard J-D-02 (Medication Services).  \n19 61.  People “entering the facility on prescription medication [must] continue to receive \n20 the medication in a timely fashion as prescribed, or acceptable alternate medications are provided \n21 as clinically indicated.”  Id.  \n22 62.  Failure to provide medications in a timely manner may have “grave consequences \n23 to patient health.  Therefore, inmates being admitted who report taking medications currently or \nComplaint - 13  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 14 of 38\n \n1 who bring the medications with them are to continue their medication unless there is a clinical \n2 reason to alter or discontinue the medication.”  Id.   \n3 63.  According to Pierce County Jail policy, individuals with prescription psychiatric \n4 medication must receive a three-day supply upon release into the community, but only if their \n5 medication is “indicated to prevent decompensation.”   \n6 64.  However, in practice, Defendants refuse to provide individuals with mental illness \n7 their medications upon release.  Given the long wait times to see a provider in the community, \n8 this delay significantly increases the risk of psychological decompensation and self-harm.   \n9 65.  Defendants’ refusal to provide people released into the community with a \n10 sufficient supply of psychiatric medication is also unlawful, places these individuals at risk of re-\n11 arrest, and is a threat to the public safety \n12 66.  Defendants’ practices are counter to NCCHC standards, which require that health \n13 staff “[a]rrange for a reasonably supply of current medications” for planned discharges.  See \n14 NCCHC Standards J-E-13 (Discharge Planning).  Providing access to medication upon release is \n15 essential to “ensure patients’ health needs are met during transition to a community health care \n16 professional” and “may also help reduce recidivism.” Id.  \n17 67.  Defendants’ failure to provide psychiatric medication is compounded by their \n18 refusal to provide counseling or other mental health programming of any kind.     \n19 68.  The failure to provide mental health treatment via counseling and \n20 psychosocial/psychoeducational programs also violates NCCHC standards.  These standards \n21 recognize that “[m]ental health treatment is more than prescribing psychotropic medications.  \n22 Treatment goals include the development of self-understanding, self-improvement, and \n23\nComplaint - 14  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 15 of 38\n \n1 development of skills to cope with and overcome disabilities associated with various mental \n2 disorders.” NCCHC Standard J-G-04 (Basic Mental Health Services).    \n3 C.  Defendants Punish Plaintiffs for Their Mental Illnesses  \n4 69.  Without basic mental health treatment, people with mental illness incarcerated in \n5 the Jail experience mental decompensation, delusions, hallucinations, and severe mood swings.  \n6 They have difficulty understanding and conforming their behavior to social norms and the rules \n7 of the Jail as well as communicating appropriately with Jail staff and other inmates.   \n8 70.  Instead of providing these individuals with treatment, Defendants warehouse them \n9 in solitary confinement and punish them with force and restraints, further exacerbating mental \n10 illness. \n11 a.  Use of Isolation \n12 71.  Defendants have a formal written policy of placing people with “poor behavioral \n13 control due to a mental disorder” in “crisis cells” for 23 hours a day.  These cells are “one of the \n14 most restrictive housing options” available at the Jail and constitute solitary confinement.  The \n15 Mental Health Program staff is responsible for recommending placement in the crisis cells “for \n16 safety concerns.”  \n17 72.   Defendants also isolate people with mental illness for 20 to 21 hours a day, albeit \n18 not in “crisis cell” units.  The Jail also operates a “Mental Health Unit,” which is a unit for \n19 individuals with mental illness who are considered “more vulnerable if placed in the general \n20 population.”   \n21 73.  Individuals who inform staff of their suicidal ideations are placed on “suicide \n22 watch,” which results in them being stripped of their clothing and draped in a “safety smock” \n23\nComplaint - 15  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 16 of 38\n \n1 (also known as a “suicide smock”) in solitary confinement.  Suicide watch is profoundly \n2 dehumanizing and humiliating, and can further destabilize the people in mental health crisis.   \n3 74.  Even where there is no suicide danger, Defendants have a policy and practice of \n4 using solitary confinement to warehouse people with mental illness and punish them for minor \n5 behavioral issues, despite the known detrimental impact of isolation on this population.    \n6 75.  For example, people have been placed in isolation for talking erratically during \n7 the booking process, having a history of mental health issues, being loud, and failing to follow \n8 directions.   \n9 76.  A 2014 audit of the Jail found “a tendency to increase the custody level of any \n10 offender who shows indications of mental health issues.”  Bill Vetter, Evaluation of Pierce \n11 County Corrections Bureau Jail Operations (Sept. 4, 2014), \n12 https://www.co.pierce.wa.us/DocumentCenter/View/32482.  \n13 77.  People with severe mental illness can remain in solitary at the Jail for weeks or \n14 months at a time, which significantly increases the risk of psychological decompensation and \n15 self-harm.   \n16 78.  While there, they are also largely unable to access services, programs, and \n17 activities provided in the Jail.  These include telephone services, in-person visitation, hygiene \n18 activities, outdoor exercise, administrative, disciplinary, and classification proceedings, the \n19 “kite” and grievance systems, library services, access to reading materials, commissary services, \n20 and educational, vocational, religious, recreational, and other programming.   \n21 79.  Defendants’ isolation of the seriously mentally ill violates NCCHC policy, which \n22 prohibits the use of solitary confinement “of any duration” for people with mental illness because \n23 it is “harmful to an individual’s health.”  National Commission on Correctional Health Care \nComplaint - 16  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 17 of 38\n \n1 (“NCCHC”), Solitary Confinement (Isolation) Position Statement, adopted Apr. 10, 2016: \n2 http://www.ncchc.org/solitary-confinement (last visited Dec. 4, 2017). \n3 80.  Defendants’ policies permitting mental health staff to recommend placement of a \n4 person with a serious mental illness in solitary also violates ethical standards for the medical \n5 profession.  According to NCCHC, “Health staff must not be involved in determining whether \n6 adults or juveniles are physically or psychologically able to be placed in isolation.”  Id.  Instead, \n7 the proper role of health professionals is to review an individuals’ health record to determine \n8 whether their “mental health needs contraindicate the placement or require accommodation.”  \n9 NCCHC Standard J-E-09 (Segregated Inmates).   \n10 b.  Use of Force and Restraints  \n11 81.  In 2016, Pierce County Jail deputies logged nearly 1100 “use of force” reports.  \n12 This included the use of “OC” (oleoresin capsicum spray, also known as “pepper spray,” \n13 pepperball launchers, and expulsion grenades), restraint chairs (a wheelchair with restraint straps \n14 for the arms, torso, and legs), “Lateral Vascular Neck Restraints” (a potentially lethal “blood \n15 choke” that restricts blood flow to the brain), and “eyebolts,” which are metal bolts used to chain \n16 a person’s hands and feet to the concrete floor. \n17 82.  Jail policy dictates that “[p]roper restraints will only be used as a precaution \n18 against escape, to prevent self-injury, injury to others or property damage,” and that “[i]n no \n19 event is physical force justifiable as a punishment.”   \n20 83.  According to Jail policy, restraint chairs are “not a medical restraint.” They are \n21 intended only to restrain “violent out-of-control” people and are not meant to be used as \n22 punishment.  The decision to place an individual in a restraint chair is solely at the discretion of \n23 corrections deputies, not medical or mental health staff.   \nComplaint - 17  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 18 of 38\n \n1 84.  Jail policy also states that the eyebolts may be used “when deemed necessary,” \n2 but are intended for use on “violent out-of-control inmates.”  According to policy, any use of the \n3 eyebolts must be videotaped, and mental health staff may provide input as to whether people can \n4 endure the restraints for longer than four hours, and for up to a maximum of eight hours.  A \n5 person can be restrained for longer than 8 hours if ordered by Jail administration.  \n6 85.   In violation of the Jail’s written policy, deputies’ own use of force reports reveal \n7 that force and restraints are deployed for minor behavioral issues directly attributable to mental \n8 illness.  Deputies often use force and restraints to punish non-violent behavior such as lack of \n9 cooperation, kicking and punching cell doors, covering cell windows, and profanity.   \n10 86.  For example, on January 3, 2017, a woman with mental illness was screaming in \n11 her cell and punching her cell door.  Deputies sprayed her with pepper spray, handcuffed her, \n12 and placed her face down on a mattress before shackling her hands and feet to eyebolts, where \n13 she was left restrained for three hours.   \n14 87.  On February 9, 2017, a man with mental illness was kicking his cell door and \n15 yelling.  He was placed face down on a mattress and his legs and arms were shackled to the \n16 eyebolts “to prevent him from causing further disturbances.”  While the man was chained to the \n17 floor, a deputy “delivered a short hammer strike to the right side of [his] jaw” because the deputy \n18 believed the man was trying to bite him.  The man remained restrained in the cell for \n19 approximately eight hours.   \n20 88.  On February 23, 2017, a man on suicide watch was placed in a restraint chair for \n21 putting a mattress and toilet paper against his window and “yelling unintelligibly” after urinating \n22 on himself.  Deputies decided the restraint chair was necessary to help the man “cool off,” \n23 despite the fact that the man complied with requests to remove the toilet paper from his window, \nComplaint - 18  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 19 of 38\n \n1 complied with the restraint process, and “sat down in the chair on his own.”  While restrained the \n2 man informed deputies that he was not receiving his proper medication.      \n3 89.  On March 14, 2017, a man with mental illness was placed in a restraint chair for \n4 covering up his cell door with blankets and ripped pieces of his mattress.  The man remained in \n5 the restraint chair for several hours.     \n6 90.  The use of force and restraints to punish behavior that is attributable to \n7 individuals’ mental illness causes unnecessary physical and psychological harm.   \n8 D.  Plaintiffs Suffer Ongoing Irreparable Injury as a Result of Defendant’s Actions   \n9 91.  Defendants fail to provide basic mental health services to people incarcerated in \n10 the Pierce County Jail, and subject people suffering from mental illness to isolation and uses of \n11 force and restraints when they predictably decompensate.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, \n12 Plaintiffs and other similarly situated suffer irreversible psychological harm.    \n13 a.  Plaintiff Donald Bango \n14 92.  Plaintiff Donald Bango is a 40-year old decorated veteran who served in the \n15 United States military for fifteen years, including tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.   \n16 93.  On October 6, 2015, approximately two months prior to Mr. Bango’s arrest, he \n17 met with a doctor at Veteran’s Affairs for an annual physical.  The provider noted his diagnoses \n18 for bipolar disorder, PTSD, major depressive disorder, and panic disorder, and reviewed Mr. \n19 Bango’s current medication list, including Venlafaxine (brand name Effexor), an anti-depressant, \n20 and Prazosin, a drug used to treat PTSD and anxiety.    \n21 94.  Mr. Bango was arrested on December 13, 2015.  Mr. Bango informed the \n22 Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) who evaluated him during the booking process that he \n23 had been diagnosed with serious mental illnesses and received counseling and medication from \nComplaint - 19  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 20 of 38\n \n1 Veteran’s Affairs.  He also informed the EMT that he had considered committing suicide the \n2 previous year by shooting himself.   \n3 95.  Jail staff did not attempt to confirm Mr. Bango’s diagnoses or medications by \n4 requesting his medical records from Veteran’s Affairs.   \n5 96.  Mr. Bango was placed on “suicide watch” shortly after booking.  He was stripped \n6 of his clothing, placed in a “suicide smock,” and put in solitary confinement in the 3 South wing \n7 of the Jail, also known as the “hole.”   \n8 97.  While on suicide watch, Defendants did not provide Mr. Bango with basic mental \n9 health care beyond assessing his suicidal ideations.   \n10 98.  As a result, Mr. Bango began to mentally decompensate and “just wanted to die.”  \n11 He began to have delusions and hallucinations, and started to believe that the sprinkler light in \n12 his cell was sending him signals, telling him to kill himself.   \n13 99.  After several days in isolation, Mr. Bango decided he could not handle the signals \n14 from the sprinkler light any longer, and wrapped his suicide smock around the sprinkler to \n15 dislodge it.  This caused the sprinkler to break and flood Mr. Bango’s cell with black, putrid \n16 water.    \n17 100.  In response, Jail deputies rushed into Mr. Bango’s cell and tackled him to the \n18 ground.  Deputies then handcuffed Mr. Bango behind his back.  Deputies then sprayed Mr. \n19 Bango in the face with pepper spray.  Deputies put Mr. Bango in an adjacent cell, where they left \n20 him for several hours without any clothing.  \n21 101.  Mr. Bango sat naked on the cell floor with pepper spray on his face and his arms \n22 handcuffed behind his back for several hours.  Because he was restrained, Mr. Bango was not \n23 able to clean the pepper spray from his face and it burned his eyes and nose.  A deputy noted in \nComplaint - 20  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 21 of 38\n \n1 his report that Mr. Bango “bang[ed] his head a few times to get our attention,” but refused to \n2 uncuff him because Mr. Bango was “display[ing] uncooperative actions” and would not “sit \n3 quietly.”  When a nurse came to take Mr. Bango’s blood pressure, the deputies refused to uncuff \n4 him.   \n5 102.  During those hours that he was restrained in the cell, Mr. Bango felt he was in the \n6 worst place he had ever been in his life and wanted to die.   \n7 103.  After several days on suicide watch and in other isolation cells, Mr. Bango was \n8 moved to another area of the Jail, where he was placed in the general population.  Mr. Bango \n9 continued to have periodic hallucinations and delusions, including hearing voices, which he \n10 attributed to his cellmates.     \n11 104.  On December 20, 2015, seven days after he was booked, Mr. Bango sent a kite \n12 requesting his psychiatric medications and noting that he was concerned about “falling into \n13 further mental health crisis or psychosis.”  A mental health provider responded, “[c]ase reviewed \n14 no MH [mental health] appointment at this time.”   \n15 105.  On December 28, 2015, Mr. Bango kited again to request his medications. He \n16 also noted that he “was given my meds through the VA hospital.”  A mental health provider \n17 responded, “It appears that your medication was not current when booked into PCJ [Pierce \n18 County Jail].  Case reviewed no MH appointment at this time.”   \n19 106.  Mr. Bango’s Veteran’s Affairs records indicate that he had active prescriptions for \n20 the psychiatric medications Effexor and Prazosin when he was arrested and booked into the Jail.   \n21 107.  On January 11, 2016, a mental health provider interviewed Mr. Bango.  He \n22 informed the provider that his cellmate “won’t stop talking.”  The provider noted that Mr. Bango \n23 had made similar statements about his previous cellmate talking too much.  Instead of \nComplaint - 21  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 22 of 38\n \n1 investigating further, the provider decided that Mr. Bango was “unable to get along with his \n2 roommate.”  Mr. Bango was in fact experiencing auditory hallucinations.   \n3 108.  Mr. Bango kited again on January 15, 2016, stating that he had not “seen anyone \n4 about my mental health meds.”  A mental health provider responded “MH interviewed you on \n5 01/11/16 they cleared you per class.”   \n6 109.  On January 21, 2016, two representatives from Veteran’s Affairs, a chaplain and a \n7 social service provider, came to the Jail and spoke to one of the mental health providers.  They \n8 asked whether Mr. Bango was receiving his psychiatric medications.  The provider reviewed Mr. \n9 Bango’s chart and determined that he had not followed up with treatment for four months prior \n10 to his arrest.  In fact, Mr. Bango had met with a provider at least two months prior to his arrest \n11 and had current prescriptions when he was arrested.   \n12 110.  Mr. Bango kited yet again on February 2, 2016, stating that he needed “to see a \n13 mental health pro ASAP . . . I need my meds and to see a MHP [mental health provider].  I[’]m \n14 trying to use the appropriate channels.”  A mental health provider responded that “[t]his request \n15 has been answered numerous times.  Do not kite regarding this matter again.”   \n16 111.  Mr. Bango kited the following day, on February 3, 2016, stating “I need to see a \n17 mental health person…I am a veteran that served in the military…I suffer from several mental \n18 disabilities from this and I am in dire need for my medication…Thank you for your time and \n19 patience.”  He was informed that his “medications have not started because you did not follow \n20 up with the community mental health care provider for a while prior to booking.”   \n21 112.  Mr. Bango’s Veteran’s Affairs records indicate that he had met with a provider on \n22 October 6, 2015, approximately two months before his arrest.   \n23\nComplaint - 22  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 23 of 38\n \n1 113.  After receiving the response to his February 3 kite, Mr. Bango decided to stop \n2 asking for mental health treatment because he feared he would be punished by being demoted a \n3 classification “level,” which would restrict his access to visitation, the telephone, commissary \n4 services, and possibly result in him being placed in the “hole” again.   \n5 114.  For the next year, Mr. Bango spent most of his time in his cell, avoiding social \n6 interaction as his mental illness worsened.  His hallucinations intensified and he had trouble \n7 sleeping.  When he did come out of his cell, he had auditory hallucinations, imagining that others \n8 in his unit were verbally threatening him.  When sharing a cell with another person, Mr. Bango \n9 would hallucinate that his cellmate was talking to him.   \n10 115.  On March 8, 2017, approximately 15 months after Mr. Bango’s arrest, Pierce \n11 County Jail requested his medical records from Veteran’s Affairs.   \n12 116.  On March 10, 2017, Mr. Bango kited mental health staff again after his wife \n13 urged him to seek treatment.  Mr. Bango stated, “I need to see a MHP ASAP.  I[’]m a veteran \n14 who has been diagnosed with PTSD.  I’m not getting any mental health care…I’m starting to \n15 have a hard time thinking clear because I have not slept.  I don[’]t know if [my cellmate] is \n16 talking to me at night or if I[’]m hearing voices.”  A mental health provider responded, “We \n17 understand you are having a hard time, but we do not have control over housing in that unit.”   \n18 117.  On March 11, 2017, Mr. Bango responded, “Ok.  I understand that you may not \n19 have control of housing but I would like to see and talk to MHP.  Are you telling me to just suck \n20 it up and continue to have a hard time or can I be evaluated to see if we can come to a solution.”  \n21 A mental health provider responded, “You do not meet requirements to be seen [b]y MHP.  You \n22 must focus on other coping skills to help you through this difficult time.”   \n23\nComplaint - 23  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 24 of 38\n \n1 118.  On July 28, 2017, Mr. Bango sent a kite stating, “I need to see mental health \n2 ASAP for PTSD bipolar and related depression problems.  I need to know why I can[’]t get my \n3 meds.  I requested my records.  They are here at PCJ, I got the copies and I[’]m still not being \n4 treated for mental health.”  A mental health provider responded, “You have been at PCJ for a \n5 year and a half now, [h]ow have you been coping without medications up to this point?”  Mr. \n6 Bango responded, “I[’]m not a professional and that isn[’]t a question I can answer other than to \n7 say I have not been doing good without medication or treatment for my PTSD traumatic brain \n8 injury bipolar disorder and panic disorder.  I have made several attempts and requests from Dec \n9 2015 until now and have continuously been refused mental health treatment.  I am having \n10 increased episodes of vivid nightmares flashbacks and anxiety.  Why am I being denied basic \n11 mental health services…I[’]m begging once again for someone to please address my issues.”  A \n12 mental health provider responded, “We understand you are having a hard time but we do not \n13 start mental health medications that were not current in community and do not provide ongoing \n14 counseling.  We will send you some mental health worksheets to help teach you new coping \n15 skills and a list of providers that you can follow up with when you get out of jail.”   \n16 119.  On August 4, 2017, Mr. Bango filed a grievance concerning the lack of mental \n17 health care.  He noted that he had been requesting care since December 2015.  A mental health \n18 provider responded, “[Y]our requests for medications have been reviewed in the past.  I have \n19 now referred you to see the nurse practitioner to determine if medications will be prescribed for \n20 you here at PCJ [Pierce County Jail].”   \n21 120.  A psychiatric nurse practitioner and mental health provider came to see Mr. \n22 Bango on August 16, 2017, but only spent a few minutes discussing his symptoms before \n23\nComplaint - 24  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 25 of 38\n \n1 prescribing Setraline (brand name Zoloft), an anti-depressant, and Prazosin, a drug used to treat \n2 PTSD.   \n3 121.  On August 24, 2017, the psychiatric nurse practitioner visited Mr. Bango again, \n4 but this interaction was equally brief and the only treatment provided as an increase in dosage of \n5 his Zoloft prescription and the addition of a new medication, Trazadone, “for racing thought[s] at \n6 bedtime.”   \n7 122.  On August 25, 2017, Mr. Bango filed an appeal of his grievance because he had \n8 not received comprehensive mental health treatment, including ongoing mental health screening \n9 and evaluation, crisis intervention, medication management, individual and group counseling, \n10 and mental health programming.  Mr. Bango requested mental health treatment consistent with \n11 national standards.   \n12 123.  On September 7, 2017, Mr. Bango sent a kite indicating that he was hearing \n13 voices despite putting earplugs in his ears.  Staff responded by asking him if he wanted \n14 “handouts on coping.”   \n15 124.  On September 9, 2017, Mr. Bango sent a kite stating that he had not slept in five \n16 days.   \n17 125.  Mr. Bango again saw the psychiatric nurse practitioner on September 12, 2017, \n18 who noted that he was hearing voices.  However, the only care provided was an increase in his \n19 prescription medications.   \n20 126.  On September 13, 2017, Mr. Bango requested information on the side effects for \n21 his medications.  On September 15, 2017, he made the same request, noting that mental health \n22 staff had “fail[ed] to provide informations [sic] sheets about medications when requested and \n23 never sit and counsel patients or provide the opportunity or access to the provider to do so.”   \nComplaint - 25  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 26 of 38\n \n1 127.  On September 17, 2017, Mr. Bango sent a kite stating that he was “seeing thi[n]gs \n2 that talk to me” and was afraid that people “can hear me through the radios and satalites [sic].”  \n3 A mental health provider responded, “[h]ave you ever been treated for mental health issues?  \n4 Have you taken meds before?”  Mr. Bango responded, “I have been on meds for 10 years . . . \n5 Don[’]t you people look at our file or meds or talk to each other, do you even care that I[’]m \n6 under attack right now?”   \n7 128.  On October 2, 2017, Mr. Bango sent a kite stating “I[’]m trying to get away from \n8 them but they are using the satalites [sic] to track me and control my brains, I[’]m supposed to \n9 have the surgery to take out the Army implant.  The voices are com[]ing through the radios and \n10 intercom.  When I look for them I only see their shadows but they are there . . . . Are they here \n11 intercepting my thinking, I just need to know the truth and what they are using them for.?”  A \n12 mental health provider responded, “You may speak with your attorney about this.  You will have \n13 to follow up with ARNP [nurse practitioner].”   \n14 129.  On October 4, 2017, a nurse practitioner saw Mr. Bango and noted that he was \n15 worried about being tracked by satellites.  The nurse practitioner increased his Zoloft \n16 prescription.   \n17 130.  On October 12, 2017, Mr. Bango sent a kite stating, “Someone is trying to give \n18 me poison in my medication and my trays.  Why are the[y] saying it through the radio and \n19 intercom, please send the codes to me and I will translate.”  A mental health provider responded, \n20 “Did you report these symptoms to the prescriber when you saw her last week?”   \n21 131.  On October 18, 2017, a psychologist met with Mr. Bango and documented \n22 reported hallucinations and delusions, including being injected with a monitoring device in his \n23 arm and seeing soldiers in the Jail.   \nComplaint - 26  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 27 of 38\n \n1 132.  Mr. Bango continues to have hallucinations, extreme nightmares, and severe \n2 mood swings.   \n3 133.  Mr. Bango believes that he may be taking the wrong combination of psychiatric \n4 medications.  He was prescribed Zoloft, an anti-depressant medication that is not typically used \n5 to treat bipolar disorder, and can cause manic episodes if not paired with a mood stabilizing drug.  \n6 Symptoms of mania can include psychosis.   \n7 134.  Mr. Bango’s mental health has decompensated significantly since his booking \n8 into the Jail due to Defendants’ failure to provide timely adequate mental health care.   \n9 135.  Defendants have denied Mr. Bango medically necessary psychiatric medications \n10 and access to mental health providers during his incarceration.  They have also improperly \n11 placed him in solitary confinement and left him alone in a cell with his arms handcuffed behind \n12 his back after pepper spraying him in the face.  The inappropriate use of isolation and force as \n13 well as the denial of care has caused Mr. Bango to decompensate.  \n14 b.  Plaintiff Scott Bailey  \n15 136.  Plaintiff Scott Bailey is a 45-year old man who is currently incarcerated in the \n16 Pierce County Jail and who has been diagnosed with major depression and experiences anxiety.  \n17 Mr. Bailey regularly experiences suicidal ideation and has attempted to commit suicide many \n18 times. Mr. Bailey has been incarcerated at the Pierce County Jail approximately eight times, \n19 dating back to 1999.  Defendants placed Mr. Bailey on suicide watch during his incarceration in \n20 December 2014, including placing him in isolation with no clothing except a “suicide smock,” \n21 and thus are aware of Mr. Bailey’s mental health issues and suicidal tendencies.   \n22 137.  When Mr. Bailey was booked into the Jail on April 21, 2016, a nurse noted that \n23 he was “[n]ot happy” about his arrest, but left all other mental health categories blank, including \nComplaint - 27  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 28 of 38\n \n1 Mr. Bailey’s treatment history, previous suicide attempts, and depression levels, despite noting \n2 that Mr. Bailey was “cooperative” with the assessment.   \n3 138.  Similarly, when Mr. Bailey was booked into the Jail on July 31, 2016, the nurse \n4 noted that S.B. was “[n]ot happy about” his arrest but cooperative, and left all other mental \n5 health categories blank.   \n6 139.  When Mr. Bailey was booked into the Jail on January 30, 2017, the receiving \n7 nurse noted that he was currently feeling depressed, had a current feeling of depression of a “4-\n8 6” on a scale of 10, and had tried to commit suicide in 2012 by cutting his wrist.  The nurse \n9 noted that Mr. Bailey “[a]ppears to be coping well” and left all other mental health categories \n10 blank.   \n11 140.  When Mr. Bailey was booked into the Jail on April 2, 2017, the nurse noted that \n12 he was “not real pleased” about his arrest and cooperative with the intake assessment, but left all \n13 other mental health categories blank.  These included the categories for “currently feel[ing] \n14 depressed,” “currently have thoughts of self harm or suicide,” “[c]urrent or [p]ast [t]reatment for \n15 mental health issues,” “[p]ast suicide attempts, strong plans, or treatment for attempts,” and \n16 “[h]ad any treatment for mental health issues or suicide risk during any previous incarceration[.]”   \n17 141.  Mr. Bailey recalls that he informed the nurse on April 2, 2017, about medications \n18 he had previously taken for his mental health.  According to Mr. Bailey’s medical records, he \n19 had previously taken Hydroxyzine, an anti-anxiety medication, Remeron, an anti-depressant, \n20 Prazosin, a drug typically used to treat PTSD, and Clonidine, an anti-anxiety medication as \n21 prescribed by a provider in September 2014.  However, there are no notes on Mr. Bailey’s \n22 booking form indicating previous treatment for mental illness.  \n23\nComplaint - 28  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 29 of 38\n \n1 142.  On April 20, 2017, approximately three weeks after his arrest, Mr. Bailey sent a \n2 kite requesting to see a mental health provider, noting that he was “extremely depressed.”  A \n3 mental health provider responded, “We understand you are having a hard time but we do not \n4 start mental health medications that were not current in the community and do not provide on \n5 going counseling.  We will send you some mental health worksheets to help teach you new \n6 coping skills and a list of providers that you can follow up with when you get out of jail.”  The \n7 worksheets Mr. Bailey received included instructions on getting enough sleep and exercising.  \n8 143.  On May 20th, 2017, Mr. Bailey requested a grievance form to grieve the lack of \n9 mental health treatment.  A mental health provider asked him, “[h]ave you req[ue]sted to be seen \n10 by [a mental health provider]?  What do you want to be seen for?...”  Mr. Bailey responded that \n11 he had previously asked to be seen, had a history of mental health issues, including depression \n12 and anxiety, and “would appreciate being seen by someone ASAP if possible . . . . I was taking \n13 meds in the past and need to get restarted with that as well.  Thanks.”  A mental health provider \n14 responded, “[mental health] is not set up to do treatment.  Would you like handouts on coping \n15 skills?”   Mr. Bailey declined the handouts, noting that he had received them already.  \n16 144.  On May 26, 2017, a mental health provider noted that Mr. Bailey had filed a \n17 grievance seeking counseling and medications, and “did not appear to tell the [booking] nurse of \n18 any meds or services.”  \n19 145.  The same day that Mr. Bailey filed his grievance, he was seen by two mental \n20 health providers.  One provider documented that Mr. Bailey was “depressed and crying” during \n21 the interview.  The provider also documented that Mr. Bailey had previously been hospitalized \n22 for his mental illness and had tried to commit suicide in the past by “biting his wrist, trying to \n23\nComplaint - 29  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 30 of 38\n \n1 smother himself and OD on cocaine.” The provider noted that Mr. Bailey experienced ongoing \n2 suicidal ideation and should be referred to the psychiatric nurse practitioner for treatment.   \n3 146.  When Mr. Bailey asked the providers if he was only being seen because he had \n4 filed a grievance, one of the providers made a statement that implied that the mental health \n5 providers would delay evaluating people until they had filed a grievance.  The providers’ notes \n6 reflect that Mr. Bailey was seen “due to Grievance.”   \n7 147.  On June 10, 2017, Mr. Bailey sent a kite asking when he would be seeing \n8 “someone to get medications started,” i.e., the psychiatric nurse practitioner.  A mental health \n9 provider responded, “Our list is very long. It may be a little while longer before you can be \n10 seen.”   \n11 148.  The psychiatric nurse practitioner did not evaluate Mr. Bailey for treatment until \n12 June 16, 2017, almost three weeks after Mr. Bailey’s depression and suicidal tendencies were \n13 noted in the Jail’s medical record.  The nurse practitioner assessed Mr. Bailey with major \n14 depression, nearly two and a half months after he had been admitted to the Jail, and prescribed \n15 medications, including Hydroxyzine, an anti-anxiety medication, and Setraline (brand name \n16 Zoloft), an anti-depressant.   \n17 149.  On July 11, 2017, Mr. Bailey filed a grievance appeal, stating that the Jail was not \n18 providing treatment or counseling on a regular basis and that “I should not have to file a \n19 grievance to receive help from M.H.P . . . . A schedule of regular treatment needs to be made \n20 available to all who need it.  Not to those select few who complaint the loudest.”   \n21 150.  Mr. Bailey has not had any follow-up appointments with a mental health provider \n22 since June 16, 2017.   \n23\nComplaint - 30  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 31 of 38\n \n1 151.  Defendants have routinely failed to adequately screen Mr. Bailey’s mental health \n2 conditions, mental health history, or use of psychiatric medications.  Further, Defendants have \n3 refused to provide Mr. Bailey with timely access to psychiatric medications or other basic mental \n4 health services, despite his repeated requests for treatment.  This has placed Mr. Bailey at an \n5 unreasonable risk of self-harm and psychological decompensation.   \n6 E.  Defendants Are Deliberately Indifferent to Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Rights  \n \n7 152.  Pierce County has long been the target of protracted litigation regarding its \n8 substandard mental health care. Additionally, it has a history of contracting with private for-\n9 profit health care providers that are known to provide constitutionally inadequate services to \n10 correctional facilities.  These facts, in addition to Defendants’ acknowledgement of the receipt of \n11 Plaintiffs’ counsel’s recent letter demanding changes to policies and practices in the Jail, \n12 demonstrate that Defendants are on actual notice––and thus intentionally and/or deliberately \n13 indifferent––to their violations of Plaintiffs’ and similarly situated individuals’ constitutional \n14 rights.   \n15 153.  In 1995, the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington (ACLU-WA), in \n16 cooperation with Evergreen Legal Services and the Puget Sound Assistance Foundation, sued \n17 Pierce County in federal court regarding unconstitutional conditions in the Pierce County Jail.  \n18 The resulting class action, Herrera v. Pierce County, including causes of action challenging \n19 Pierce County Jail’s inadequate mental health care.  See Dkt. #12, First Amended Complaint for \n20 Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, No. C95-5025-FDB at 27–28 (W. Wa. Mar. 17, 1995).   \n21 154.  The Herrera litigation was resolved through a series of stipulated orders in 1995 \n22 and 1996.  See Dkt. #89, Stipulated Order and Final Judgment, No. C95-50525-FDB (W. Wa. \n23 Mar. 28, 1996).  Pursuant to these orders, Pierce County was required to create a mental health \nComplaint - 31  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 32 of 38\n \n1 unit, increase health care staffing, implement mental health training, and adopt constitutional \n2 medical care standards, policies, and procedures using the National Commission on Correctional \n3 Health Care (NCCHC) and the American Public Health Association (APHA) as guidelines.  See \n4 id. at 5–6; see also Dkt. #41, Stipulated Order, No. C95-5025-FDB (W. Wa. Oct. 31, 1995).   \n5 Pierce County was also specifically required to create and annually update policies and \n6 procedures “regarding the use of and conditions in crisis cells and other cells (including booking \n7 cells) used to isolate prisoners with suicide risks or mental health related behavioral problems.” \n8 Dkt. # 89 at 7.  The case was dismissed pursuant to settlement in 2011. See Dkt. # 372 \n9 Stipulation and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice, No. C95-5025-RBJ-JKA (W. Wa. Feb. 25, \n10 2011).     \n11 155.  Since the dissolution of the Herrera settlement agreement, Pierce County Jail has \n12 made several concerning and questionable changes to its mental health care services, including \n13 contracting with private corporations for the provision of medical and mental health services in \n14 the Jail.  Several of these private corporations have been the subject of repeated lawsuits \n15 regarding substandard medical and mental health care.   \n16 156.  Regardless of the existence of any contracts with private entities to provide \n17 mental health care at the Pierce County Jail, Defendants are ultimately responsible for the mental \n18 health care, treatment, and safekeeping of individuals incarcerated at the Pierce County Jail and \n19 cannot contract away their constitutional and statutory obligations to provide minimally adequate \n20 mental health care.   \n21 157.  On August 28, 2017, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent a letter to Defendants.  This letter \n22 detailed Defendants’ unlawful policies, practices, procedures, and customs towards individuals \n23 with mental illness confined at the Pierce County Jail.   \nComplaint - 32  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 33 of 38\n \n1 158.  On September 11, 2017, Pierce County Sheriff’s Department spokesman, Ed \n2 Troyer, referenced the letter from Plaintiffs’ counsel at an “Adults Civics Happy Hour” event at \n3 the Pacific Brewing & Malting Company in Tacoma, Washington.  He stated: “Actually we have \n4 the ACLU coming after us now for – we do have too many people with mental health in the jail \n5 and not enough services.  And we were laughing [in response to the letter] and saying, ‘We’ve \n6 been ringing that bell and beating that drum for ten years, where have you been?  Come help \n7 us.’”1 \n8 159.  Because the Defendants were on actual notice of their violations, their acts and \n9 omissions reflect that they were intentionally and/or deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ and to \n10 similarly situated individuals’ constitutional rights.   \n11 VI.  CAUSES OF ACTION \n12 COUNT ONE \n(Violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution (42 U.S.C. § \n13 1983)) \nBy Plaintiffs DONALD BANGO, SCOTT BAILEY and the Proposed Class Against \n14 Defendants, Pierce County, Bruce Dammeier, Pierce County Sheriff’s Department, Paul A. \nPastor, Patti Jackson-Kidder, and Janet Rhoton \n15  \n160.

Defendants have been and are aware of all of the violations listed above, and have \n18\nbeen deliberately indifferent to these violations.   \n19\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent request relief as outlined \n20\nbelow.   \n21\nCOUNT THREE \n22 (Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12132 et seq.)) \nBy Plaintiffs DONALD BANGO, SCOTT BAILEY and the Proposed Class Against \n23 Defendants Pierce County and Pierce County Sheriff’s Department  \n \nComplaint - 34  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 35 of 38\n \n1  \n164.  Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, “no qualified individual with a \n2\ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the \n3\nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to \n4\ndiscrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \n5\n165.  Defendants Pierce County and Pierce County Sheriff’s Department are public \n6\nentities as defined in 42 U.S.C. §12131(1)(A).  \n7\n166.  Plaintiffs are qualified individuals with a disability, as that term is defined in 42 \n8\nU.S.C. §12102(2).  They all suffer from a mental impairment that substantially limits one or \n9\nmore “major life activities,” including, inter alia, caring for oneself, eating, sleeping, speaking, \n10\nlearning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.  See 42 U.S.C. \n11\n§12102(2)(A).   \n12\n167.  The programs, services, and activities that Defendants Pierce County and the \n13\nSheriff’s Department provide to individuals incarcerated at the Pierce County Jail include, inter \n14\nalia, mail and telephone services, in-person visitation, hygiene activities, outdoor exercise, \n15\nadministrative, disciplinary, and classification proceedings, the “kite” and grievance systems, \n16\nlibrary services, access to reading materials, commissary services, and educational, vocational, \n17\nreligious, recreational, and other programming.   \n18\n168.  Defendants Pierce County and the Sheriff’s Department discriminate against, \n19\nunjustly segregate, and fail to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and \n20\nprocedures for Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent.  As a result, Plaintiffs and the \n21\nproposed class are excluded from participation in and denied the benefits of the Pierce County \n22\nJail’s services, programs, and activities.   \n23\nComplaint - 35  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 36 of 38\n \n1 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent request relief as outlined \n2 below.   \n3 COUNT FOUR \n(Violation of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794)) \n4 By Plaintiffs DONALD BANGO, SCOTT BAILEY, and the Proposed Class Against \nDefendants Pierce County and Pierce County Sheriff’s Department \n5  \n \n6 169.  Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, “[n]o otherwise qualified individual \n7 with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \n8 excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination  \n9 under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).   \n10 170.  At all relevant times, Defendants Pierce County and the Pierce County Sheriff’s \n11 Department received Federal financial assistance as that term is used in 29 U.S.C. § 794,  \n12 including receiving funding under the U.S. Department of Justice’s State Criminal Alien \n13 Assistance Program (SCRAAP).   \n14 171.  All of the operations of Defendants Pierce County and the Pierce County Sheriff’s \n15 Department qualify as “programs or activities,” as those terms are defined in 29 U.S.C. § 794(b).  \n16 This includes all operations of the Pierce County Jail.   \n17 172.  Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent are qualified individuals with \n18 disabilities as that term is defined in 29 U.S.C. § 705(20) and 42 U.S.C. § 12102. \n19 173.  By their polices, practices, and procedures, Defendants Pierce County and Pierce \n20 County Sheriff’s Department violate the rights of Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent \n21 under the Rehabilitation Act by discriminating against them and excluding them from, and \n22 denying them the benefits of, the operations of the Pierce County Jail.   \n23\nComplaint - 36  AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF \n  WASHINGTON FOUNDATION\n901 FIFTH AVENUE #630 \nSEATTLE, WA 98164\n(206) 624-2184 \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 1   Filed 12/04/17   Page 37 of 38\n \n1 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent request relief as outlined \n2 below.   \n3 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n4 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs prays that the Court:  \n5 1.  Issue an order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n6 23(a) and 23(b)(2); \n7 2.  Declare that Defendants’ acts, omissions, policies, practices, procedures, and \n8 customs as described in this Complaint violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \n9 Constitution, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the \n10 Rehabilitation Act. \n11 3.  The issuance of injunctive relief restraining Defendants from violating the Eighth \n12 and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Title II of the Americans with \n13 Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act;   \n14 4.

Christel. Presently pending before the Court is Plaintiffs \n17 \nDonald Bango and Scott Bailey’s Amended Motion for Class Certification (“Motion”). Dkt. 78. \n18 \n  The Court concludes Plaintiffs have failed to meet the numerosity and commonality \n19 \nrequirements for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a). Plaintiffs have \n20 \nalso failed to meet the requirements of Rule 23(b). Accordingly, the Court recommends \n21 \nPlaintiffs’ Motion (Dkt. 78) be denied.  \n22 \n \n23 \n \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 1 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 2 of 29\n \n \n \n1  I.  Background \n2  Plaintiffs, individuals incarcerated at the Pierce County Jail (“Jail”) at the time the \n3  Complaint was filed, allege Defendants Pierce County, Washington and Pierce County Sheriff’s \n4  Department are failing to provide adequate mental health treatment in violation of the Eighth and \n5  Fourteenth Amendments, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), and the \n6  Rehabilitation Act (“RA”). Dkt. 1. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege Defendants are: (1) failing to \n7  provide adequate mental health screenings; (2) ignoring clear signs of mental illness and requests \n8  for treatment; (3) refusing to provide necessary treatment for mental illnesses; (4) delaying and \n9  denying basic mental health care, including medications; (5) punishing Plaintiffs for non-violent \n10  behaviors caused by their mental illnesses; (6) and housing Plaintiffs in solitary confinement \n11  despite clinically proven negative impacts of isolation on individuals with mental illness. Id.; see \n12  also Dkt. 31.1  \n13  On August 29, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the Motion. Dkt. 78. Defendants filed a Response on \n14  September 17, 2018, and Plaintiffs filed a Reply on September 21, 2018. Dkt. 90, 102. The Court \n15  heard oral argument on September 27, 2018. 2 \n16  II.  Discussion \n17  A class action is “an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on \n18  behalf of the individual named parties only.” Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 348 \n19  (2011) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700–01 (1979)). In order to justify a \n20  departure from that rule, “a class representative must be part of the class and ‘possess the same \n21 \n                                                 \n22 \n1 Plaintiffs also alleged Defendants refused to provide needed psychiatric medications upon release from \nthe Jail. This claim was dismissed on May 7, 2018. Dkt. 43; see also Dkt. 41. \n23  2 During the hearing, the Court heard argument from Attorney Sal Mungia, on behalf of Plaintiffs, and \nAttorney Michelle Luna-Green, on behalf of Defendants. \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 2 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 3 of 29\n \n \n \n1  interest and suffer the same injury’ as the class members.” Id. (citing E. Tex. Motor Freight Sys., \n2  Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403 (1977)). “Class certification is proper only if the trial court \n3  has concluded, after a ‘rigorous analysis,’ that Rule 23(a) has been satisfied.” Wang v. Chinese \n4  Daily News, Inc., 737 F.3d 538, 542–43 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350). As \n5  part of this analysis, the court “must consider the merits [of the substantive claims] if they \n6  overlap with [the class certification] requirements.” Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d \n7  970, 981 (9th Cir. 2011) (emphasis in original). \n8  A plaintiff seeking class certification must show he meets the requirements of Federal \n9  Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), which states: \n10  One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on \nbehalf of all members only if:  \n11 \n(1)  the  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is  impracticable \n12  [(“numerosity”)]; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class [(“commonality”)]; \n13  (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class [(“typicality”)]; and \n14  (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass [(“adequacy of representation”)]. \n15   \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n16 \nThe proposed class or subclass must also satisfy the requirements of one of the sub-\n17 \nsections of Rule 23(b), “which defines three different types of classes.” Leyva v. Medline \n18 \nIndustries, Inc., 716 F.3d 510, 512 (9th Cir. 2013). In this case, Plaintiffs contend that their \n19 \nproposed class meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), which requires that “the party opposing \n20 \nthe class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \n21 \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \n22 \nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P 23 (b)(2); see also Dkt. 78.  \n23 \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 3 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 4 of 29\n \n \n \n1  “As a threshold matter, and apart from the explicit requirements of Rule 23(a), the party \n2  seeking class certification must demonstrate that an identifiable and ascertainable class exists.” \n3  Mazur v. eBay, Inc., 257 F.R.D. 563, 567 (N.D.Cal. 2009). “Certification is improper if there is \n4  no definable class.” Guzman v. Bridgepoint Educ., Inc., 305 F.R.D. 594, 610 (S.D. Cal. 2015) \n5  (internal quotation omitted). “‘A class definition should be precise, objective, and presently \n6  ascertainable,’ though ‘the class need not be so ascertainable that every potential member can be \n7  identified at the commencement of the action.’” Mazur v. eBay Inc., 257 F.R.D. 563, 567 (N.D. \n8  Cal. 2009) (quoting O'Connor v. Boeing N. Am., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D.Cal. 1998)). “A \n9  class definition is inadequate if a court must make a determination of the merits of the individual \n10  claims to determine whether a person is a member of the class.” Hanni v. Am. Airlines, Inc., \n11  2010 WL 289297, at *9 (N.D.Cal. Jan. 15, 2010).  \n12  However, “many courts have determined that [ascertainability] is of less importance or \n13  not applicable at all when considering certification under Rule 23(b)(2). Dunakin v. Quigley, 99 \n14  F.Supp.3d 1297, 1325 (W.D. Wash. 2015). “Although the Ninth Circuit has not ruled on this \n15  issue, several other circuit courts have held that, due to the unique characteristics of a Rule \n16  23(b)(2) class, it is improper to require ascertainability for a Rule 23(b)(2) class.” Id. at 1326; see \n17  also Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 559–63 (“[A]scertainability is not a requirement for \n18  certification of a (b)(2) class seeking only injunctive and declaratory relief ....”); Shook v. El \n19  Paso, 386 F.3d 963, 972 (10th Cir. 2004) (“[M]any courts have found Rule 23(b)(2) well suited \n20  for cases where the composition of the class is not readily ascertainable.”).  \n21  Defendants assert the class is too broad and ambiguous. See Dkt. 90. Essentially, \n22  Defendants are asserting the defined class does not meet the ascertainability doctrine. However, \n23  Plaintiffs are moving for class certification under Rule 23(b)(2). See Dkt. 78. Therefore, the \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 4 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 5 of 29\n \n \n \n1  Court finds any failure to prove the ascertainability of the proposed class does not make class \n2  certification improper in this case. See In re Yahoo Mail Litigation, 308 F.R.D. 577, 597 (N.D. \n3  Cal. 2015) (“ascertainability requirement does not apply to Rule 23(b)(2) actions”).  \n4  As the Court has found failure to prove ascertainability does not make class certification \n5  improper, the Court must now determine if Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown: (1) numerosity; \n6  (2) commonality; (3) typicality; (4) adequate class representation; and (5) the Rule 23(b)(2) \n7  requirements are met.  \n8  A.  Numerosity \n9  Plaintiffs satisfy the numerosity requirement if “the class is so large that joinder of all \n10  members is impracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1); see also Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d \n11  1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998). The numerosity requirement demands “examination of the specific \n12  facts of each case and imposes no absolute limitations. General Tel. Co. of the Northwest, Inc. v. \n13  EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980). Nevertheless, “Plaintiffs must show some evidence of or \n14  reasonably estimate the number of class members. Mere speculation as to satisfaction of this \n15  numerosity requirement does not satisfy Rule 23(a)(1).” Schwartz v. Upper Deck Co., 183 F.R.D. \n16  672, 681 (S.D.Cal. 1999).  \n17  Plaintiffs have defined the proposed class is “all qualified individuals who have mental \n18  illnesses that are disabilities as defined in 42 U.S.C. §12102 [(ADA)] and 29 U.S.C. §705(9)(B) \n19  [(RA)], and who are now, or will be in the future, incarcerated at [the Jail].” Dkt. 1, ¶ 28; see \n20  also Dkt. 78, p. 2. Under the ADA,  \n21  (1) Disability \nThe term “disability” means, with respect to an individual--(A) a physical \n22  or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life \nactivities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) \n23  being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph \n(3)).  \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 5 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 6 of 29\n \n \n \n1  (2)Major life activities \n(A) In general For purposes of paragraph (1), major life activities include, \n2  but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, \nhearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, \n3  breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and \nworking. (B) Major bodily functions For purposes of paragraph (1), a \n4  major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, \nincluding but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell \n5  growth,  digestive,  bowel,  bladder,  neurological,  brain,  respiratory, \ncirculatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions. \n6  (3) Regarded as having such an impairment  \nFor  purposes  of  paragraph  (1)(C):  (A)  An  individual  meets  the \n7  requirement of “being regarded as having such an impairment” if the \nindividual  establishes  that  he  or  she  has  been  subjected  to  an  action \n8  prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or \nmental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to \n9  limit  a  major  life  activity.  (B)  Paragraph  (1)(C)  shall  not  apply  to \nimpairments that are transitory and minor. A transitory impairment is an \n10  impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months or less. \n \n11  42 U.S.C. § 12102 (emphasis in original). 29 U.S.C. § 705(9)(B). The RA references the \n12  definition of disability as found in the ADA.   \n13  To establish numerosity, Plaintiffs submitted evidence showing, in 2017, there was an \n14  average of 85 mental health beds in use per day at the Jail. Dkt. 81-18, p. 2. Plaintiffs also cite, \n15  but do not submit as evidence, a study completed by the League of Women Voters of Tacoma-\n16  Pierce County that states, in 2015, 26% of the 1,100 inmates at the Jail were on psychiatric \n17  medications. See Dkt. 78, pp. 14-15; League of Women Voters of Tacoma-Pierce County, Study \n18  of Mental Health in Pierce County, 35 (Feb. 2016), \n19  http://www.piercecountywa.org/DocumentCenter/View/42628. Plaintiffs extrapolate that this \n20  study shows a quarter of inmates at the Jail, or 266 individuals, are on psychiatric medications \n21  “at any given time.” Dkt. 78, p. 14.  \n22  Plaintiffs, however, do not cite to any evidence regarding the number of individuals \n23  incarcerated or who will be incarcerated who have diagnosed mental illnesses that meet the \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 6 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 7 of 29\n \n \n \n1  definition of disability under the ADA or the RA. There is also no evidence showing individuals \n2  who are housed in a mental health bed or who are prescribed psychiatric medications necessarily \n3  have a mental illness resulting in a disability as defined by the ADA and the RA. Rather, \n4  Plaintiffs only speculate as to the number of individuals who would be members of the proposed \n5  class based on the average number of mental health beds being used at the Jail. Nat’l Fed’n of \n6  Blind v. Target Corp., 582 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1199 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (“[M]ere speculation as to \n7  the number of parties involved is not sufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement.”); Marcial \n8  v. Coronet Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 954, 957 (7th Cir. 1989) (plaintiffs need not specify exact number \n9  in the class, but cannot rely on conclusory allegations and speculation as to the size of the class); \n10  Celano v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 242 F.R.D. 544, 549 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (finding the plaintiffs’ \n11  census data and statistics were too ambiguous and speculative to establish numerosity where the \n12  plaintiffs submitted only 21 declarations of potential class members). \n13  As Plaintiffs have not provided evidence showing a reasonable estimate regarding the \n14  number of individuals with mental illnesses that are disabilities under the ADA and the RA who \n15  are incarcerated or will be incarcerated at the Jail, Plaintiffs have not shown they meet the \n16  numerosity requirement.  \n17  B.  Commonality \n18  Rule 23(a)(2) requires “questions of law or fact common to the class.” In Dukes, the \n19  Supreme Court held this provision requires plaintiffs to “demonstrate that the class members \n20  ‘have suffered the same injury,’” not merely violations of “the same provision of law.” 564 U.S. \n21  at 350 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982)). Plaintiffs’ claims \n22  “must depend upon a common contention” such that “determination of [their] truth or falsity will \n23  resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Id. “What \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 7 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 8 of 29\n \n \n \n1  matters to class certification ... is not the raising of common ‘questions’—even in droves—but, \n2  rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the \n3  resolution of the litigation.” Id. (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of \n4  Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 97, 132 (2009)).  \n5  Plaintiffs, however, are not required to show “every question in the case, or even a \n6  preponderance of questions, is capable of class wide resolution. So long as there is even a single \n7  common question, a would-be class can satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).” \n8  Wang v. Chinese Daily News, Inc., 737 F.3d 538, 544 (9th Cir. 2013) (quotation marks and \n9  citation omitted); see also Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 589 (9th Cir. \n10  2012) (finding “commonality only requires a single significant question of law or fact”). “Where \n11  the circumstances of each particular class member vary but retain a common core of factual or \n12  legal issues with the rest of the class, commonality exists.” Evon v. Law Offices of Sidney \n13  Mickell, 688 F.3d 1015, 1029 (9th Cir. 2012) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \n14  In civil rights cases, commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a system-wide \n15  policy or practice that affects all of the putative class members. Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d \n16  849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 \n17  (2005). “Where such a policy exists, ‘individual factual differences among the individual \n18  litigants or groups of litigants will not preclude a finding of commonality.’” Hernandez v. \n19  County of Monterrey, 305 F.R.D. 132, 153 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (quoting Armstrong, 275 F.3d at \n20  686). However, to determine commonality, the Court must have a precise understanding of the \n21  nature of the underlying claims. Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 676 (9th Cir. 2014); see also \n22  Ellis, 657 F.3d at 981 (the court must consider the merits of the underlying claims if the clams \n23  overlap with the class certification requirements).  \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 8 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 9 of 29\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs allege the Jail’s systemic policies and practices3 are violating the Eighth and \n2  Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, Title II of the ADA, and the RA. Dkt. 1, 78.  \n3  Specifically, Plaintiffs contend the Jail policies and practices that expose the proposed class \n4  members to a substantial risk of serious harm are as follows:  \n5  1.  Screenings: “Failing to adequately screen for mental illnesses during the \nbooking process or during incarceration.” Dkt. 78, p. 17.  \n6   \n2.  Mental Health Treatment: “Refusing to provide necessary mental health \n7  treatment, including ignoring requests for care, delaying or denying access to \npsychiatric medications, and refusing to provide counseling, mental health \n8  programming, and other basic mental health care.” Id.  \n \n9  3.  Classification in Solitary Confinement: “Locking people with mental illness in \nsolitary confinement, despite the clinically proven negative impacts of \n10  isolation on people with mental illness.” Id. \n \n11  4.  Use of Force: Punishing class members with mental illness for non-violent \nbehaviors directly related to their mental illness through uses of force and \n12  restraints, including restraint chairs and “eyebolts.”  Id. \n \n13  To establish a constitutional violation, a plaintiff must prove he suffered a sufficiently \n14  serious deprivation, such as his conditions of confinement pose a substantial risk of harm or he \n15  has a serious medical need. See Mendiola–Martinez v. Arpaio, 836 F.3d 1239, 1248–49 (9th Cir. \n16  2016). “The plaintiff then must prove that the defendant was deliberately indifferent to [his] \n17  health and safety or serious medical needs.” Id. \n18  1.  Screenings \n19  Plaintiffs first contend the Jail’s policies and practices of failing to adequately screen for \n20  mental illnesses during the booking process or during incarceration violate constitutional rights. \n21  See Dkt. 1, 78. \n                                                 \n22 \n3 The parties use the terms “policies,” “practices,” “procedures,” and “customs” to refer to the allegations \n23 \nand conduct at the Jail. See e.g. Dkt. 1, 78, 90. Throughout this Report and Recommendation, the Court will refer to \nall policies, practices, procedures, and customs as “policies and practices.”  \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 9 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 10 of 29\n \n \n \n1  The evidence shows when Plaintiff Bailey was booked into the Jail on April 2, 2017, the \n2  incarceration period relevant to the Complaint, the booking nurse noted Plaintiff Bailey was “not \n3  real pleased” about his arrest, but was cooperative with the intake assessment. Dkt. 80, Bailey \n4  Dec., ¶ 6. The intake assessment form was blank on all mental health categories. Id.; see also \n5  Dkt. 80-4. Plaintiff Bailey states he informed the nurse he had previously taken medications for \n6  his mental health. Dkt. 80, Bailey Dec., ¶ 7. However, Plaintiff Bailey’s booking form does not \n7  indicate previous treatment for mental illness. Id. \n8  Plaintiff Bango was arrested on December 13, 2015 and, at the time of his arrest, he \n9  informed the emergency medical technician (“EMT”) that he had been diagnosed with serious \n10  mental illnesses and received counseling and medications from the Department of Veterans \n11  Affairs (“VA”). Dkt. 79, Bango Dec., ¶ 4. Plaintiff Bango also told the EMT he had considered \n12  attempting suicide in the past year. Id. Plaintiff Bango was placed on “suicide watch” shortly \n13  after booking. Id. at ¶ 5. \n14  Plaintiffs also submitted the National Commission on Correctional Health Care’s \n15  (“NCCHC”) 2014 “Standards for Health Services in Jails.” Dkt. 81-5. Under NCCHC’s \n16  Standards, inmates should receive screening on arrival at the intake facility to ensure emergent \n17  and urgent health needs are met; this includes a screening form indicating past or current mental \n18  illness and history or current suicidal ideations. Id. at p. 7. NCCHC Standards also state inmates \n19  with positive mental health screenings should receive a screening with a mental health \n20  professional within fourteen days of admission to the correctional system. Id. at p. 15. The Jail, \n21  however, is not an NCCHC facility and does not follow NCCHC standards. Dkt. 81-1, Rhoton \n22  Depo., p. 5.  \n23 \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 10 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 11 of 29\n \n \n \n1  Evidence also shows that when an individual is arrested and booked into the Jail, “a \n2  booking nurse will perform an initial health receiving screen[ing] of each inmate patient.” Dkt. \n3  99, Slothower Dec., ¶ 7. Screenings are conducted with guidance through an electronic form and \n4  several of the questions contain only a single checkbox. Id. at ¶¶ 8-9. The booking nurse is \n5  “instructed that by leaving the checkbox unselected he or she is documenting a conclusion that \n6  all parameters of the question are false.” Id. at ¶ 9. If the checkbox is selected, a positive \n7  response is indicated and further documentation is provided in a text box. Id. The screening \n8  forms are completed electronically, “which ensures a follow-up mental health assessment is \n9  scheduled where appropriate.” Id. at ¶ 11. Inmates are asked to execute a release form at \n10  booking, as needed, to obtain medical records prior to being incarcerated. Id. at ¶ 12. “If during \n11  screening a person identifies that they have prescribed medications, healthcare staff attempt to \n12  obtain and evaluate the prescription information to ensure medications continue when necessary \n13  while the person is incarcerated.” Dkt. 92, Harrel Dec., ¶7. “For those inmate patients that do not \n14  have an active verifiable prescription, medications are ordered for inmate patients by a \n15  prescribing treatment provider when clinically appropriate under the circumstances.” Dkt. 99, \n16  Slothower Dec., ¶ 13.  \n17  During an inmate’s incarceration, the mental health providers receive mental health \n18  referrals from several sources, including correction deputies, nursing staff, and self-referrals \n19  through the “kite” communication system.4 Dkt. 96, Rhoton Dec., ¶ 5. It is the policy for the \n20  mental health providers to screen all referrals and respond according to the level of service \n21  indicated. Id. at ¶ 6. Kites are usually responded to on the same day the kite is sent and the \n22  longest it has taken to respond to a kite is “[m]aybe a couple of days.” Dkt. 81-3, Perez Depo., p. \n                                                 \n23 \n4 A “kite” is a request slip used by an inmate to write a request for mental health services. Dkt. 96-1, p. 16. \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 11 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 12 of 29\n \n \n \n1  12. Assessments, which occur at the time of booking and upon referral, are used to determine if \n2  there is a mental health issue. Dkt. 96, Rhoton Dec., ¶ 7. \n3  Here, Plaintiff Bango reported he was suicidal to an EMT and was placed on suicide \n4  watch at the Jail shortly after booking. Plaintiffs fail to show how the screening process Plaintiff \n5  Bango received was inadequate. While Plaintiff Bailey’s reported mental health issues and \n6  previous use of mental health medications were not included on his screening form, the evidence \n7  fails to show Plaintiff Bailey required medications or treatment upon entering the Jail. Plaintiffs \n8  also cite to the NCCHC Standards; yet, do not provide specific allegations or evidence showing \n9  how the Jail’s policies and practices fail to meet these standards. Further, Plaintiffs fail to show \n10  the decision to follow different standards indicates the proposed class members’ are being \n11  exposed to a substantial risk of serious harm.  \n12  Evidence of the Jail’s policies and practices show inmates are screened when they enter \n13  the Jail and are provided additional treatment as necessary. Further, after booking, assessments \n14  are used to determine if an inmate has a mental health issue. Based on the allegations and \n15  evidence, Plaintiffs have not shown a systemic application of policies and practices during the \n16  screening process expose the proposed class members to a substantial risk of serious harm. \n17  Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs have not shown commonality as to their claim regarding \n18  the screening processes at the Jail. \n19  2.  Mental Health Treatment \n20  Plaintiffs next assert the Jail’s policies and practices of denying or delaying mental health \n21  treatment are exposing the proposed class to a substantial risk of serious harm. Dkt. 1, 78.  \n22  Plaintiffs’ evidence shows Plaintiff Bailey experiences suicidal ideations and has \n23  attempted to commit suicide. Dkt. 80, Bailey Dec., ¶ 1. After the booking process, Plaintiff \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 12 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 13 of 29\n \n \n \n1  Bailey was placed in general population. See Dkt. 80-4. Plaintiff Bailey requested mental health \n2  treatment and jail providers responded to his requests. See Dkt. 80, Bailey Dec., ¶¶ 8-10. About a \n3  month and a half after he was incarcerated, on May 19, 2017, Plaintiff Bailey was seen by two \n4  mental health providers. Id. at ¶ 12. Plaintiff Bailey sent a kite on June 10, 2017, asking when \n5  medications would be started. Id. at ¶ 14. A mental health provider responded that the list to be \n6  seen is very long and it may be a little while longer before Plaintiff Bailey would be seen. Id. On \n7  June 16, 2017, Plaintiff Bailey was evaluated by the psychiatric nurse practitioner; the nurse \n8  practitioner “assessed [Plaintiff Bailey] with major depression” and prescribed Plaintiff Bailey \n9  medications. Id. at ¶ 15.  \n10  At the time of his arrest on December 13, 2015, Plaintiff Bango informed the EMT that \n11  he had been diagnosed with serious mental illnesses and received counseling and medications \n12  from the VA. Id. at ¶ 4. Plaintiff Bango also told the EMT he had considered attempting suicide \n13  in the past year. Id. Plaintiff Bango was placed on “suicide watch” shortly after booking. Id. at ¶ \n14  5. After several days on suicide watch and in isolation cells, Plaintiff Bango was placed in \n15  general population. Id. at ¶ 12. \n16  Plaintiff Bango sent kites regarding his mental health needs, which were responded to by \n17  mental health providers. Dkt. 79, Bango Dec., ¶¶ 13, 15-16, 18, 20-21, 26-28. Plaintiff Bango \n18  states his VA records indicated he had active prescriptions when he was arrested and booked into \n19  the Jail and the VA faxed a list of Plaintiff Bango’s medications to the Jail. Id. at ¶¶ 15-16. \n20  In January of 2016, a VA representative met with Plaintiff Bango and spoke with mental \n21  health providers at the Jail. See Dkt. 79-10. The VA representative was notified that Plaintiff \n22  Bango was being assessed by mental health providers, had presented with few symptoms, and a \n23  decision was made that he would not receive psychotropic medications. Id.; see also Dkt. 79, \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 13 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 14 of 29\n \n \n \n1  Bango Dec., ¶ 19. On August 4, 2017, Plaintiff Bango filed a grievance concerning his lack of \n2  mental health treatment. Dkt. 79, Bango Dec., ¶ 29. A mental health provider referred Plaintiff \n3  Bango to the nurse practitioner to determine if medications would be prescribed. Id. On August \n4  16, 2017, Plaintiff Bango was seen by a psychiatric nurse practitioner and mental health \n5  provider. Id. at ¶ 30. At that time, the psychiatric nurse practitioner prescribed an anti-depressant \n6  medication and post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) medication for Plaintiff Bango. Id. After \n7  Plaintiff Bango filed additional kites regarding his mental health needs, the dosages for his anti-\n8  depressant and PTSD medications were increased and he was prescribed an additional \n9  medication for “racing thoughts at bedtime.” Id. at ¶¶ 31-32, 35, 37-41.  \n10  Defendants provided evidence showing Plaintiff Bango denied being a danger to himself \n11  or others, was not exhibiting any signs of psychosis, and stated he was doing well in general \n12  population. See Dkt. 92, Harrel Dec., ¶¶ 13-14. In August of 2017, Plaintiff Bango denied \n13  psychotic symptoms, but reported a depressed mood with breakthrough PTSD related nightmares \n14  and intrusive memories. Id. at ¶ 16. Medications were started. Id. After twenty months in the Jail \n15  with no indication of psychosis, Plaintiff Bango kited that he was hearing voices and satellites \n16  were trying to control him. Id. at ¶¶ 17-19. The Jail staff did not observe psychotic symptoms. \n17  See id. at ¶¶ 19-21. \n18  Janet Rhoton, the mental health manager at the Jail, stated, under the Jail’s policies and \n19  practices, the goal of the Jail “Mental Health Program is to identify inmates with mental health \n20  concerns, provide assessments, and intervene in a timely and in the least restrictive manner \n21  consistent with the security needs of the [Jail] and the inmate.” Dkt. 96, Rhoton Dec., ¶ 4. The \n22  mental health providers receive mental health referrals from several sources, including correction \n23  deputies, nursing staff, and kites. Id. at ¶ 5. It is the policy for the mental health providers to \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 14 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 15 of 29\n \n \n \n1  screen all referrals and respond according to the level of service indicated. Id. at ¶ 6. \n2  Assessments are used to determine if there is a mental health issue. Id. at ¶ 7. Ms. Rhoton stated \n3  it is not uncommon “that an inmate may attempt to malinger or feign mental illness in order to \n4  avoid or in some way impact their criminal matter.” Id. Under the Jail’s policies and practices, \n5  “[t]he focus of the Mental Health Program is to serve those inmates who are at risk, as a result of \n6  a mental disorder, of presenting a danger to themselves or others, or becoming gravely disabled.” \n7  Id. at ¶ 10. It is also Jail policy to provide continuity of mental health care during incarceration. \n8  Id. at ¶ 11. \n9  As stated above, the Jail has a referral system and inmates can send “kites” regarding \n10  medical needs. A kite is usually responded to on the same day it is sent and the longest it has \n11  taken to respond to a kite is “[m]aybe a couple of days.” Dkt. 81-3, Perez Depo., p. 12. Follow-\n12  up evaluations are conducted depending on the inmate’s needs. See id. at p. 13. The Jail does not \n13  provide on-going counseling. Id. The Jail, however, does provide counseling to inmates, \n14  depending on symptoms, that can consist of one session or last the duration of the inmate’s \n15  incarceration and the Jail provides on-going medications. Dkt. 81-2, Anderson Depo., pp. 3-5. \n16  Defendants also submitted evidence from Ian Harrel, a licensed independent clinical \n17  social worker, stating the Jail’s “policies and procedures meet or exceed standards for healthcare, \n18  including mental health care, and behavioral health screenings in the correctional setting.” Dkt. \n19  92, Harrel Dec., ¶ 5. Mr. Harrel stated the Jail’s “goal is to provide basic medical attention for \n20  patients to be safe during the incarceration period.” Id. If an inmate identifies prescribed \n21  medications during the booking screening process, healthcare staff attempt to obtain and evaluate \n22  prescription information to ensure medications continue when necessary during incarceration. Id. \n23  at ¶ 7. “Each medical condition and situation is different, but the [J]ail’s policy is to verify active \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 15 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 16 of 29\n \n \n \n1  prescriptions and if necessary continue the prescription through the health services provided in \n2  the [J]ail.” Id.  \n3  Because individuals spend, on average, 23 days in the Jail, “it is not therapeutically \n4  appropriate to engage in deep level counseling and trauma counseling.” Dkt. 92, Harrel Dec., ¶ 8; \n5  Dkt. 95, Jackson-Kidder Dec, ¶ 2 (average stay is 23 days). “One-on-one counseling may be \n6  possible in limited circumstances, but outside of treatment for acute symptoms, little therapeutic \n7  progress is likely due to the uncertain circumstances, expectations and disposition that the inmate \n8  may face.” Dkt. 91, Muscatel Dec., ¶ 22. “The standard mental health modality to use in jail \n9  settings is crisis stabilization.” Dkt. 92, Harrel Dec., ¶ 8. \n10  In this case, Plaintiffs have provided allegations and evidence showing Jail employees \n11  responded to two inmates’ – Plaintiffs Bango and Bailey – requests for treatment. Plaintiffs do \n12  believe the Jail provided them with an adequate level of treatment. However, Plaintiffs have not \n13  submitted any expert evidence to rebut the expert opinions from Mr. Harrel and Dr. Kenneth M. \n14  Muscatel, Ph.D. Plaintiffs’ evidence merely shows a disagreement between the medical \n15  treatment requested by Plaintiffs and the Jail staff’s opinion regarding necessary medical \n16  treatment, which does not show the Jail’s policies and practices are being applied in a systemic \n17  way that exposes the proposed class to a substantial risk of serious harm. See Toguchi v. Chung, \n18  391 F.3d 1051, 1058 (9th Cir. 2004) (mere differences of opinion between a prisoner and prison \n19  medical staff regarding the proper course of treatment does not give rise to a § 1983 claim).  \n20  Mr. Harrel declared that the Jail’s policies and practices meet or exceed standards for \n21  mental health care. In contrast, Plaintiffs have not submitted any expert testimony and have, at \n22  most, provided conclusory allegations that the Jail’s policies and practices violate constitutional \n23  rights and two isolated allegations of constitutional violations related to mental health treatment \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 16 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 17 of 29\n \n \n \n1  at the Jail. Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs have failed to show commonality as to their \n2  claim regarding the denial and delay in providing mental health treatment. \n3  3.  Classification in Solitary Confinement \n4  Plaintiffs contend the Jail’s policy and practice of locking inmates with mental illness in \n5  solitary confinement, despite the clinically proven negative impacts of isolation on people with \n6  mental illness, violates the proposed class members’ constitutional rights. See Dkt. 1, 78. To \n7  support their position, Plaintiffs cite to Chapter 13 of the Mental Health Policy and Procedures \n8  Manual (“MHPPM”) and Chapter 3.01 of the Policy and Procedures Manual (“PPM”). See Dkt. \n9  78, p. 8. Plaintiffs, however, do not provide any explanation showing how these policies and \n10  practices have a systemic application that exposes the proposed class members to a substantial \n11  risk of serious harm. \n12  The evidence shows classification and housing is dictated by policy. Dkt. 95, Jackson-\n13  Kidder Dec., ¶ 7. Under Chapter 13 of the MHPPM, inmates with mental health symptoms can \n14  be placed in general population, a mental health unit, or a crisis cell. See Dkt. 81-10, p. 3. \n15  Chapter 3.01 of the PPM states the Jail staff will implement and maintain a classification plan \n16  that ensures “inmates are classified in a fair and consistent manner according to their individual \n17  custodial management and program needs.” Dkt. 81-11, p. 2. \n18  Plaintiffs’ allegations and evidence show that, at the time of his booking, Plaintiff Bango \n19  was placed on suicide watch. Dkt. 79, Bango Dec., ¶ 5. Plaintiff Bango was stripped of his \n20  clothing, placed in a “suicide smock,” and put into solitary confinement. Id. Plaintiff Bango \n21  states that, as a result of not receiving basic mental health care, he began to mentally \n22  decompensate, have delusions and hallucinations, and wanted to die. Id. at ¶ 7. Additional \n23  evidence shows Plaintiff Bango’s own statements regarding a suicide attempt were the basis for \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 17 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 18 of 29\n \n \n \n1  placing him on suicide watch at the time of his booking on December 13, 2015. Dkt. 92, Harrel \n2  Dec., ¶ 11. He was monitored every fifteen minutes and then every thirty minutes, and, on \n3  December 16, 2015, suicide precautions were discontinued. Id. Plaintiff Bango was then placed \n4  in general population. Dkt. 79, Bango Dec., ¶ 12. There is no evidence Plaintiff Bango was \n5  placed on suicide watch or in isolation any other time or that Plaintiff Bailey was placed in \n6  solitary confinement. \n7  Plaintiffs also submitted eight classification reports showing inmates with mental health \n8  concerns were classified at the “maximum” level classification. See Dkt. 81-12. However, \n9  several of the reports noted the inmate had prior assaultive felony convictions and/or known \n10  institutional behavior problems. Id. Plaintiffs also cited to, but did not provide as evidence, a \n11  2014 “Evaluation of Pierce County Detention Operations” (“Evaluation”), which stated “there \n12  appears to be a tendency to increase the custody level of any offender who shows indications of \n13  mental health issues.” See Dkt. 78, p. 9. The Evaluation recommended consolidating the mental \n14  health population in an appropriate housing unit. Bill Vetter, Evaluation of Pierce County \n15  Detention Operations, p. 56 (August 25, 2014), \n16  https://www.co.pierce.wa.us/DocumentCenter/View/32482. \n17  Defendants’ evidence shows it is Jail policy to ensure inmates are safe from self-harm, \n18  which includes suicide precautions. Dkt. 95, Jackson-Kidder Dec., ¶ 12. “Suicide precautions \n19  may include placing the inmate on suicide watch.” Id. at ¶ 14.  Mental health providers may \n20  recommend a level of observation an inmate may need, i.e. suicide observation; however, the \n21  final determination regarding classification and housing rests with the Classification Supervisory \n22  Team. Id. at ¶ 7. “The least restrictive housing is the goal/default.” Id. If an inmate is placed in \n23  restrictive housing, the inmate may still receive visits by the chaplain, visits from professional \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 18 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 19 of 29\n \n \n \n1  staff, and, if no sanction prevents, an inmate may still have visitation, limited access to \n2  commissary, and access to the library and educational materials. Id. If an inmate is placed on \n3  suicide watch, he is able to access in-person visitation and legal visits, but is not able access \n4  outdoor exercise, the library, the commissary, or attend church. Dkt. 81-3, Perez Depo., p. 16. \n5  The policies and practices at the Jail show inmates may be placed in restrictive housing. \n6  However, the least restrictive hosing is the goal/default and staff will implement and maintain a \n7  classification plan that ensures inmates are classified in a fair and consistent manner according to \n8  their individual custodial management and program needs. The evidence shows Plaintiff Bailey, \n9  despite his complaints of serious mental health issues, was never subjected to restrictive housing. \n10  After reporting suicidal thoughts, Plaintiff Bango was subjected to restrictive housing when he \n11  initially entered the Jail. However, he was in restrictive housing and on suicide watch only for \n12  the first three days of his incarceration. Once he was taken off suicide watch, he was placed in \n13  general population. Despite complaints of serious mental health issues, Plaintiff Bango does not \n14  assert he was placed in restrictive housing after he was initially placed on “suicide watch.” \n15  Further, the Evaluation (which again is not evidence before the court) fails to show a policy or \n16  practice of “locking” proposed class members in solitary confinement. The Evaluation shows, in \n17  2014, inmates with mental illnesses tended to have increased classification levels, not that the \n18  proposed class members are being “locked” in “solitary confinement” because of their mental \n19  illnesses. As such, Plaintiffs have failed to show there is a systemic policy or practice of “locking \n20  people with mental illness in solitary confinement” to which all members of the proposed class \n21  are exposed. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not shown commonality regarding the claim that \n22  individuals with mental illnesses are being locked in solitary confinement. \n23   \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 19 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 20 of 29\n \n \n \n1  4.  Use of Force \n2  Plaintiffs also allege Defendants’ policies and practices are violating the proposed class \n3  members’ constitutional rights because force and restraints are used to punish class members \n4  with mental illnesses for non-violent behaviors related to their mental illnesses. Dkt. 1, 78. In \n5  their Motion, Plaintiffs cite PPM Chapters 6.11 and 6.12 and MHPPM Chapter 9 to support this \n6  claim. See Dkt. 78. Plaintiffs, however, have not made an adequate showing of how these \n7  specific policies and practices are systemically applied in a way that exposes the proposed class \n8  members to a substantial risk of serious harm. \n9  Under PPM Chapter 6.11, corrections deputies may use the amount of force necessary to \n10  affect the lawful purpose intended, provided no reasonably effective alternative appears to exist. \n11  Dkt. 81-14. Further, “[p]roper restraints will be used only as a precaution against escape, to \n12  prevent self-injury, injury to others or property damage.” Id. at p. 2. Physical force is not \n13  justifiable as punishment. Id. PPM Chapter 6.12 addresses the use of eyebolt restraints, which is \n14  “a metal bolt that is affixed to the cell floor that restraints can be fastened to.” Id. at pp. 2, 5. \n15  “The purpose of cell eyebolts is to provide staff with an alternative, safe and humane means of \n16  restraining violent out-of-control inmates.” Id. at p. 5. \n17  Plaintiffs’ allegations and evidence shows, while on suicide watch, Plaintiff Bango \n18  started to believe the sprinkler light in his cell was sending him signals, telling him to kill \n19  himself. Dkt. 79, Bango Dec., ¶ 7. After several days, Plaintiff Bango wrapped his suicide smock \n20  around the sprinkler, breaking the sprinkler and flooding his cell. Id. at ¶ 8. “Jail deputies rushed \n21  into [his] cell and tackled [him] to the ground.” Id. at ¶ 9. Plaintiff Bango was handcuffed behind \n22  his back and sprayed in the face with pepper spray. Id. Plaintiff Bango states he sat naked and \n23  handcuffed on a cell floor for several hours, and, because he was restrained he could not clean \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 20 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 21 of 29\n \n \n \n1  the pepper spray from his face. Id. at ¶ 10.5 Plaintiffs also submitted four use of force incident \n2  reports. Dkt. 81-17. These four use of force incident reports reference mental health concerns \n3  regarding the inmate on whom force was used. See id. The reports, however, note isolated \n4  instances when force was used against an inmate after, or while, the inmate was engaged in \n5  disruptive and potentially harmful behaviors. Id. (inmate attempting to bite correctional officer, \n6  inmate screaming and yelling, inmates covering cell windows with mattress and toilet paper). \n7  Evidence also shows the Jail has a use of force policy that is in place to ensure \n8  individuals do not hurt themselves or others. Dkt. 95, Jackson-Kidder Dec., ¶ 4. The Jail does not \n9  use force to punish or discipline mental health inmates, nor is that Jail policy. Id. The Jail uses \n10  only force necessary to gain compliance to ensure individuals do not hurt themselves or others, \n11  or to prevent escape. Id. If force or restraints are used, a “use of force” report must be generated. \n12  Id. The policy at the Jail for the use of restraint chairs does not permit restraints to be used as a \n13  form of punishment or for the protection of property. Id. at ¶ 6. A restraint chair may only be \n14  used for the safety of an inmate and others. Id.  \n15  The eyebolt policy was updated in a memo dated September 19, 2017. Dkt. 81-16. The \n16  memo reiterated “that under no circumstances may force or restraints be used as a form of \n17  punishment[.]” Id. at p. 2. The use of eyebolt restraints is limited to cases where there is a threat \n18  of self-harm or harm to others and only after de-escalation techniques are considered. Id. Further, \n19  the least restrictive means will be used to prevent harm. Id. The restraints “shall only remain in \n20  place as long as [the] inmate is actively attempting, or making threats to, harm self.” Id. After the \n21  September 19, 2017 memo, the Jail began the process of physically removing eyebolts. Dkt. 95, \n22 \n                                                 \n23  5 Defendants submitted evidence that pepper spray was not used against Plaintiff Bango; however, at this \nstage, the Court relies on Plaintiff Bango’s version of the event.  \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 21 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 22 of 29\n \n \n \n1  Jackson-Kidder Dec., ¶ 5. Patti Jackson-Kidder, the Bureau Chief of the Jail, stated, as of \n2  September 17, 2018, removal of all eyebolts would be finalized shortly. Id.  \n3     Plaintiffs have provided evidence that force has been used on inmates who may have \n4  mental health issues. However, the evidence shows there is no policy or practice resulting in a \n5  systemic application of unlawful force against the proposed class members. Rather, Plaintiffs \n6  have provided isolated instances of force used against inmates who may have mental health \n7  issues and were creating Jail disturbances. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not shown commonality \n8  as to their claim that force and restraints are being used to punish the proposed class members. \n9  5.  ADA and RA \n10  Plaintiffs also assert the Jail’s systemic policies and practices violate the ADA and the \n11  RA. Dkt. 1, 78, pp. 16, 18-19. “To state a claim of disability discrimination under Title II of the \n12  ADA, the plaintiff must allege four elements: (1) the plaintiff is an individual with a disability, \n13  (2) the plaintiff is otherwise qualified to participate in or receive the benefit of some public \n14  entity’s services, programs, or activities, (3) the plaintiff was either excluded from participation \n15  in or denied the benefits of the public entity’s services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise \n16  discriminated against by the public entity, and (4) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or \n17  discrimination was by reason of the plaintiff’s disability.” Thompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 895 \n18  (9th Cir.2002); Duvall v. Cnty. of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1135 (9th Cir. 2001), as amended on \n19  denial of reh'g (Oct. 11, 2001); 42 U.S.C. § 12132.6 \n20 \n21                                                   \n6 To make a claim under RA, a plaintiff must show that: (1) they are an individual with a disability; (2) they \n22 \nare otherwise qualified to receive the benefit; (3) they were denied the benefits of the program solely by reason of \ntheir disability; and (4) the program receives federal financial assistance. Id. The tests for both the RA and the ADA \n23 \nare so similar, and differ in no material aspect here, they should be analyzed together. T.B. ex rel. Brenneise v. San \nDiego Unified Sch. Dist., 795 F.3d 1067, 1083 (9th Cir. 2015). \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 22 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 23 of 29\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs allege they are being denied access to services, programs, and activities because \n2  of their disabilities. Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 71-80, 167-68, 173; see also Dkt. 78, p. 19. Plaintiffs also allege \n3  the use of force and restraint policies are discriminatory and Defendants have failed to make \n4  reasonable modifications to these policies and practices. Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 81-90, 167-68, 173; see also \n5  Dkt. 78, p. 19. During oral argument, Defendants asserted Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims are \n6  conclusory and, therefore, insufficient to show commonality.  \n7  There is evidence showing “[t]he least restrictive housing is the goal/default” in the Jail. \n8  Dkt. 95, Jackson-Kidder Dec., ¶ 5. If an inmate is placed in restrictive housing, the inmate may \n9  still receive visits by the chaplain, visits from professional staff, and, if no sanction prevents, an \n10  inmate may still have visitation, limited access to commissary, and access to the library and \n11  educational materials. Id. at ¶ 7. If an inmate is placed on suicide watch, he is able to access in-\n12  person visitation and legal visits, but is not able access outdoor exercise, the library, the \n13  commissary, or attend church. Dkt. 81-3, Perez Depo., p. 16.  \n14  There is no evidence showing the Jail’s policies and practices are systemically applied in \n15  a manner that exposes all proposed class members to ADA and RA violations. The conclusory \n16  allegations and evidence show, at times, an inmate may be subjected to housing classifications \n17  that result in restrictions. See Section II.C.3, supra. However, evidence shows the Jail’s policy is \n18  to use the least restrictive housing classification, which is consistent with the ADA. See 28 \n19  C.F.R. § 35.152(b)(2) (under the ADA, “[jails] shall ensure that inmates or detainees with \n20  disabilities are housed in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual”). \n21  Further, while there is some evidence and allegations that Jail staff has used force against \n22  inmates with mental illnesses, there is no evidence showing force was used because of the \n23  inmate’s mental illness or force has been used in more than isolated instances. See Section II.C.4, \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 23 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 24 of 29\n \n \n \n1  supra. As such, Plaintiffs have not shown housing restrictions or uses of force are a result of \n2  discriminatory policies or practices. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to show commonality \n3  regarding the ADA and the RA claims. \n4  6.  Conclusion \n5  For the above stated reasons, the Court finds there is a lack of allegations and evidence \n6  showing the Jail’s policies and practices are systemically applied in a way that exposes all \n7  members of the proposed class to a substantial risk of serious harm. Rather, Plaintiffs have \n8  alleged, at most, isolated instances of constitutional violations. See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 678 \n9  (stating individual claims for injunctive relief related to medical treatment are discrete claims for \n10  systemic reform); Parsons v. Ryan, 289 F.R.D. 513, 521 (D. Ariz. 2013) (“the crucial question is \n11  whether there is sufficient evidence of systemic issues in the provision of health care or whether \n12  Plaintiffs’ allegations are simply many examples of isolated instances of deliberate \n13  indifference”); Gray v. Cty. of Riverside, 2014 WL 5304915, at *14 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2014) \n14  (“Plaintiffs must provide more than conclusory or “threadbare” allegations that systemic policies \n15  and practices exist.”). Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to show the alleged claims meet the \n16  commonality requirements of Rule 23(a)(2).  \n17  C.  Typicality and Adequacy of Representation \n18  As the Court concludes Plaintiffs have failed to show numerosity and commonality, the \n19  Court declines to consider whether the typicality and adequacy of representation requirements of \n20  Rule 23(a) have been met. See Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349 n. 5 (“In light of our disposition of the \n21  commonality question, however, it is unnecessary to resolve whether respondents have satisfied \n22  the typicality and adequate-representation requirements of Rule 23(a).”); Waine-Golston v. Time \n23  Warner Entm’t-Advance/New House P’ship, 2012 WL 6591610, at *8 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 18, 2012) \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 24 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 25 of 29\n \n \n \n1  (finding “it is not necessary to determine whether Plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality and \n2  adequa[cy] requirements of Rule 23(a)” after finding the plaintiffs did not satisfy the \n3  commonality requirement).  \n4  D.  Rule 23(b)(2) Requirement \n5  To satisfy the requirements of class certification under Rule 23, Plaintiffs must also meet \n6  Rule 23(b). See Zinser v. Accufix Research Institute, Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (stating the \n7  plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating she has met each of the four requirements under Rule \n8  23(a) and at least one requirement of Rule 23(b)). Plaintiffs assert class certification is \n9  appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2). See Dkt. 78. After considering the record, the Court finds \n10  Plaintiffs have not shown they meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).  \n11  Rule 23(b)(2) permits class actions for declaratory or injunctive relief if “the party \n12  opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \n13  final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \n14  whole[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). “Based on this language, courts have held that class claims \n15  under Rule 23(b)(2) must be ‘cohesive.’” Fosmire v. Progressive Max Ins. Co., 277 F.R.D. 625, \n16  635 (W.D. Wash. 2011) (collecting cases). “The key to [a Rule 23(b)(2) ] class is ... the notion \n17  that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class \n18  members or as to none of them.” Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (internal quotations omitted). To certify \n19  a class under Rule 23(b)(2), it is generally sufficient “that class members complain of a pattern \n20  or practice that is generally applicable to the class as a whole.” Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d \n21  1105, 1125 (9th Cir. 2010). However, Rule 23(b)(2) does not authorize class certification “when \n22  each individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment \n23  against the defendant.” Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (emphasis in original). \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 25 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 26 of 29\n \n \n \n1     Defendants contend Plaintiffs have failed to meet the cohesion requirement under Rule \n2  23(b)(2) because there are “so many disparate questions regarding mental illness, treatment, and \n3  incarceration.” Dkt. 90, p. 28. Defendants argue the relief for each proposed class member is \n4  dependent on that person’s mental health concerns and not on any alleged systemic failure to \n5  provide a certain level of mental health treatment. Id. at p. 29. \n6  Evidence in the record illustrates that there is a wide range of mental health care issues at \n7  the Jail. See Dkt. 91, Muscatel Dec. Dr. Kenneth M. Muscatel, Ph.D., stated “[t]he definition of \n8  mental illness is so broad, non-specific, and based on multiple criteria[.]” Id. at ¶ 5. The \n9  “diagnostic spectrum of symptoms, behaviors, emotions, neurological functioning, \n10  developmental features, physical symptoms and issues, and an individual’s life experiences are \n11  virtually as wide ranging as humanity itself.” Id. at ¶ 6. Further, mental health assessments in the \n12  correctional setting include malingering, nonadherence to medical treatment, obesity, borderline \n13  intellectual functioning, wandering behaviors, and anti-social behavior. Id. at ¶ 7. Dr. Muscatel \n14  opined that treatment options are affected by whether a person has an acute, chronic, situational, \n15  or inactive mental health condition. Id. at ¶ 8.  \n16  Here, Plaintiffs challenge the general policies and practices at the Jail. See Dkt. 1, 78. \n17  Plaintiffs request equitable relief restraining Defendants from violating the proposed class \n18  members’ constitutional rights. The general request for injunctive relief fails to indicate how \n19  final injunctive relief may be crafted in a sufficiently objective and detailed way so that both \n20  Defendants and the Court can determine if Defendants are complying with the injunction. See \n21  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d) (every order granting an injunction must state its terms specifically and \n22  describe in reasonable detail the act(s) restrained or required). For example, the amount of \n23  medical treatment for one class member may meet constitutional standards, whereas the same \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 26 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 27 of 29\n \n \n \n1  treatment may be constitutional deficient for a second. The same premise applies to the use of \n2  force, use of restraints, and classification levels.  \n3  Further, more specific relief would require the Court to distinguish, based on \n4  circumstances and individual characteristics, how Jail officials may treat class members, rather \n5  than prescribing a standard conduct applicable to all proposed class members. For example, if the \n6  Court were to issue an injunction prohibiting the use of force against the proposed class members \n7  because of their mental illnesses, the Court would be required to craft an injunction taking into \n8  account specific circumstances of each inmate’s situation. The Court would be required to \n9  consider such factors as what specific mental illnesses place an inmate at risk of the use of force, \n10  the type of force to which the inmate may be exposed, the circumstances that exacerbate the risk \n11  of use of force, and in what instances the use of force or restraints is acceptable. The \n12  circumstances that pose a substantial risk of harm to each inmate presumably depends on the \n13  nature and severity of the proposed class member’s mental illness. As such, class-wide relief \n14  would be difficult to provide because a Jail officer’s conduct may only be enjoined by references \n15  to circumstances that vary among class members.  \n16  Additionally, necessary and appropriate medical treatment would depend on the nature \n17  and severity of each individual proposed class member’s mental illness, not simply because the \n18  proposed class member has a mental health illness that qualifies as a disability under the ADA \n19  and the RA. Some mentally ill individuals may require medication or may be suicidal; however, \n20  not all individuals who are mentally ill would require the same level of care. Further, some \n21  mental health matters may need immediate attention, while other requests for treatment may not \n22  require the emergent attention. The variety of appropriate treatments for different types and \n23 \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 27 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 28 of 29\n \n \n \n1  severities of mental illnesses and the numerous types of mental health issues in the Jail illustrate \n2  the Court’s inability to form a remedy for the entire proposed class. \n3  In short, Plaintiffs have not shown the relief sought is more specific than a general \n4  injunction seeking to enjoin Defendants from violating the constitution. Further, Plaintiffs have \n5  not shown the class members are being harmed in a similar way and that one injunction would \n6  correctly address the myriad of potential lawful or unlawful actions committed against the \n7  proposed class members. As such, the individualized issues related to each proposed class \n8  member’s needs and injuries overwhelm class cohesiveness. Therefore, Plaintiffs have not met \n9  the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). See Shook v. Bd. of Cty. Commissioners of Cty. of El Paso, \n10  543 F.3d 597, 604 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotations omitted) (“if redressing the class \n11  members’ injuries requires time-consuming inquiry into individual circumstances or \n12  characteristics of class members or groups of class members, the suit could become \n13  unmanageable and little value would be gained in proceeding as a class action”); Barraza v. C.R. \n14  Bard Inc., 322 F.R.D. 369, 390 (D. Ariz. 2017) (finding the plaintiffs did not meet Rule 23(b)(2) \n15  where “[t]rial of the class representative’s claims will not fairly adjudicate the claims of all class \n16  members because most of the class members had different” issues and were subject to different \n17  affirmative defenses); Thomas M. Byrne, Class Actions, 58 Mercer L.Rev. 1171, 1173 (2007) \n18  (noting that where “differences in proof or individualized issues exist pertaining to each class \n19  member, courts have rejected certification ... [for] failure to meet Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirement \n20  that relief apply to the class as a whole.”). \n21  III.  Conclusion \n22  The Court finds Plaintiffs have failed to meet the numerosity and commonality \n23  requirements under Rule 23(a). The Court declines to consider whether Plaintiffs have shown \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 28 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 105   Filed 10/15/18   Page 29 of 29\n \n \n \n1  typicality and adequacy of class representation. The Court further finds Plaintiffs failed to meet \n2  the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). Therefore, the Court concludes Plaintiffs have failed to show \n3  class certification is appropriate in this case. Accordingly, the Court recommends Plaintiffs’ \n4  Amended Motion for Class Certification (Dkt. 78) be denied.  \n5  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), the parties \n6  shall have fourteen (14) days from service of this Report to file written objections. See also FED. \n7  R. CIV. P. 6. Failure to file objections will result in a waiver of those objections for purposes of \n8  de novo review by the district judge. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C). Accommodating the time \n9  limit imposed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), the clerk is directed to set the matter for \n10  consideration on November 2, 2018, as noted in the caption. \n11  Dated this 15th day of October, 2018. \n12 \nA    \n13 \nDavid W.

Christel. Currently pending before the Court are Defendants’ Motion \n18 \nto Strike Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification and Strike Class Allegations (“Motion to \n19 \nStrike”) and Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Discovery and for Order of Protection (“Motion to \n20 \nCompel”). Dkt. 52, 54. After review of the Motions and the relevant record, the Motion to Strike \n21 \n(Dkt. 52) is granted-in-part and the Motion to Compel (Dkt. 54) is denied. \n22 \n \n23 \n \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 1 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 2 of 14\n \n \n \n1  I.  Motion to Strike (Dkt. 52) \n2  Defendants filed the Motion to Strike on June 7, 2018, requesting the Court strike \n3  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (“Motion to Certify”) and strike Plaintiff’s class \n4  allegations because Plaintiffs have failed to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n5  23(c)(1)(A) and Local Civil Rule (“LCR”) 23(i)(3). Dkt. 52. Defendants assert Plaintiffs’ failure \n6  to comply with the intent of the Federal and Local Rules and the unilateral decision to re-note the \n7  Motion to Certify resulted in a delay tactic that is prejudicial to Defendants. See id. Defendants \n8  are essentially requesting the Court sanction Plaintiffs by striking both the Motion to Certify and \n9  the class allegations. See id.; Dkt. 60. Plaintiffs filed a Response stating they complied with both \n10  the Federal and Local Rules and Defendants are not prejudiced. Dkt. 58. \n11  A.  Compliance with Federal and Local Rules \n12  Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit on December 4, 2017. Dkt. 1. On December 21, 2017, \n13  Plaintiffs filed the Motion to Certify. Dkt. 19. The Motion to Certify was noted for the Court’s \n14  consideration on January 26, 2018. See id. After two stipulations by the parties, the Motion to \n15  Certify was re-noted for the Court’s consideration on June 8, 2018. See Dkt. 26, 30. On May 30, \n16  2018, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Motion Renoted, re-noting the Motion to Certify to August 17, \n17  2018. Dkt. 49. In the Notice, Plaintiffs state they intend to move to amend the Complaint “in the \n18  near future,” and re-noted the Motion to Certify pursuant to LCR 7(l) so as to not prejudice \n19  Defendants. Id. The Notice was not stipulated to or signed by defense counsel and the Court did \n20  not grant leave to re-note the Motion to Certify.  \n21  LCR 23(i)(3) states: \n22  Within one hundred eighty days after the filing of a complaint in a class action, \nunless otherwise ordered by the court or provided by statute, the plaintiff shall \n23  move for a determination under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1), as to whether the case is \nto be maintained as a class action. This period may be extended on motion for \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 2 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 3 of 14\n \n \n \n1  good cause. The court may certify the class, may disallow and strike the class \nallegations, or may order postponement of the determination pending discovery or \n2  such other preliminary procedures as appear appropriate and necessary in the \ncircumstances. Whenever possible, where the determination is postponed, a date \n3  will be fixed by the court for renewal of the motion. \n \n4  Here, Plaintiffs filed the Motion to Certify on December 21, 2017, seventeen days after \n5  filing the Complaint. See Dkt. 1, 19. The parties agreed to extend the noting date twice and, on \n6  May 30, 2018, Plaintiffs unilaterally re-noted the Motion to Certify to August 17, 2018. The \n7  Motion to Certify has remained pending since December 21, 2017. Therefore, because Plaintiffs \n8  moved for a determination of whether this case should be maintained as a class action within 180 \n9  days of filing the Complaint, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify is in technical compliance with LCR \n10  23(i)(3). \n11  However, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ conduct is inconsistent with the spirit and intent of \n12  the Local Rules. Plaintiffs unilaterally re-noted the Motion to Certify two business days before \n13  Defendants’ response to the Motion to Certify was due. See Dkt. 49. At that time, Defendants \n14  had already spent a considerable amount of time and expense preparing their response to the \n15  Motion to Certify. See Dkt. 53, Cornelius Dec. In light of Plaintiffs’ disclosure of their intent to \n16  amend the Complaint so close to the date when Defendants’ response to the Motion to Certify \n17  was due, Plaintiffs should have moved for the Court to postpone consideration of the Motion to \n18  Certify. Thus, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ conduct warrants a determination of whether sanctions \n19  should be imposed.  \n20  B.  Imposition of Sanctions \n21  “Before imposing a case dispositive sanction a trial judge must consider five factors: (1) \n22  the public’s interest in expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court’s need to manage its \n23  dockets; (3) the risk of prejudice to the party seeking sanctions; (4) the public policy favoring \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 3 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 4 of 14\n \n \n \n1  disposition of cases on their merits; and (5) the availability of less drastic sanctions.” Johnson v. \n2  Goldsmith, 542 F. App’x 607 (9th Cir. 2013) (internal quotations omitted); Ghazali v. Moran, 46 \n3  F.3d 52, 53 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding failure to follow a district court’s local rules is a proper \n4  ground for dismissal and applying the five factors); Hester v. Vision Airlines, Inc., 687 F.3d \n5  1162, 1169 (9th Cir. 2012) (“A court must consider the . . . five factors before striking a \n6  pleading”).  \n7  In this case, the first and second factors, the public’s interest in expeditious resolution of \n8  litigation and the court’s need to manage its dockets, weigh in favor of granting the Motion to \n9  Strike. While Plaintiffs assert the case has been “moving,” this case has been pending for over \n10  seven months without a determination on class certification, which should be determined as soon \n11  practicable after the case is filed. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Because of the delay in considering the \n12  Motion to Certify, a scheduling order has not been entered and a trial date has not been set. \n13  Additionally, Plaintiffs have stated they intend to file an amended complaint, which would likely \n14  moot the current class allegations and the Motion to Certify, causing further delay of this case. \n15  Both the public’s interest in expeditious resolution of litigation and the Court’s need to manage \n16  its dockets weigh in favor of granting the Motion to Strike.  \n17  The third factor, the risk of prejudice to the party seeking sanctions, also weighs in favor \n18  of granting the Motion to Strike. The record shows Defendants will suffer prejudice if the \n19  Motion to Strike is denied. Evidence provided by Defendants, and undisputed by Plaintiffs, \n20  shows Plaintiffs intend to move to amend the Complaint. See Dkt. 49, 52, 53. If Plaintiffs are \n21  allowed to amend the Complaint, the Motion to Certify and the class allegations, which rely on \n22  the current Complaint, would likely be moot. See Loux v. Rhay, 375 F.2d 55, 57 (9th Cir. 1967) \n23  overruled on other grounds by Lacey v. Maricopa County, 693 F.3d 896 (9th Cir. 2012) (when \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 4 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 5 of 14\n \n \n \n1  an amended complaint is filed, the original complaint is “treated thereafter as non-existent”). At \n2  this time, more than two months after informing the Court they intend to move to amend the \n3  Compliant, Plaintiffs have not moved to amend the Complaint. As a result of Plaintiffs’ litigation \n4  approach, Defendants are now required to respond to the Motion to Certify prior to the Court \n5  ruling on any motion to amend filed by Plaintiffs and, if a motion to amend is filed and granted \n6  by the Court, the Motion to Certify and Defendants’ response will likely be mooted. \n7  Based on Plaintiffs’ representations and the evidence, it’s reasonable that Defendants will \n8  have to expend resources to respond to the Motion to Certify, a motion to amend, and a renewed \n9  motion to certify. The Court finds Plaintiffs’ failure to move to amend the Complaint in a timely \n10  manner, after notifying defense counsel and the Court they intended to do so, without \n11  withdrawing or seeking postponement of the Motion to Certify prejudices Defendants. \n12  Therefore, the Court finds the third factor weighs in favor of granting the Motion to Strike. See \n13  Anderson v. Air West, Inc., 542 F.2d 522, 524 (9th Cir. 1976) (“The law presumes injury from \n14  unreasonable delay”); Scarborough v. Eubanks, 747 F.2d 871, 876 (3d Cir. 1984) (prejudice \n15  includes “irremediable burdens or costs imposed on the opposing party”).  \n16  The fourth factor, the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits, weighs \n17  in favor of denying the Motion to Strike. Defendants request the Court strike the Motion to \n18  Certify and Plaintiffs’ class allegations. If the Court were to strike Plaintiffs’ class allegations, \n19  the Court would not decide a dispositive issue of this case on the merits. Therefore, the Court \n20  finds the fourth factor weighs in favor of denying the Motion to Strike.  \n21  The fifth factor, whether less drastic sanctions are available, is the determinative factor in \n22  this case. More than two months ago, Plaintiffs indicated to defense counsel and the Court they \n23  are going to move to amend the Complaint. However, as this time, no motion to amend has been \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 5 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 6 of 14\n \n \n \n1  filed. Thus, Plaintiffs’ actions have caused delay and created uncertainty as to status of this case. \n2  As a motion to amend has not been filed two months after Plaintiffs indicated they would be \n3  filing a motion to amend, the Court finds striking the Motion to Certify is an appropriate \n4  sanction. The Court, however, declines to strike the class allegations in the Complaint and \n5  Plaintiffs may file a motion requesting enlargement of time to file a renewed motion to certify \n6  after determining if they will indeed move to proceed on an amended complaint. This resolution \n7  avoids prejudice to Defendants and allows the Court to effectively manage its dockets, yet \n8  preserves the interest of deciding a dispositive issue on the merits.  \n9  For the above stated reasons, the Motion to Strike (Dkt. 52) is granted-in-part as follows:  \n10  •  The Motion to Certify (Dkt. 19) is stricken.  \n11  •  Plaintiffs’ class allegations remain in the Complaint.  \n12  •  After determining if they will move to proceed on an amended complaint, \n13  Plaintiffs may file a motion requesting enlargement of time to file a renewed \n14  motion to certify, which the Court will consider under LCR 23(i)(3) (the period \n15  for moving for a determination Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1) may be extended on \n16  motion for good cause).  \n17 \nII.  Motion to Compel (Dkt. 54) \n18  On June 14, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the Motion to Compel, requesting the Court compel \n19  Defendants to respond to discovery requests, enter a protective order, and assess fees and costs. \n20  Dkt. 54. \n21  A.  Compel Discovery Responses \n22  A party may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged information that is relevant to \n23  any claim or defense in his or her case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Once the party seeking discovery \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 6 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 7 of 14\n \n \n \n1  has established the request meets this relevancy requirement, “the party opposing discovery has the \n2  burden of showing that the discovery should be prohibited, and the burden of clarifying, explaining \n3  or supporting its objections.” Bryant v. Ochoa, 2009 WL 1390794, at *1 (S.D. Cal. May 14, 2009). \n4  When a party believes the responses to his discovery requests are incomplete, or contain \n5  unfounded objections, he may move the court for an order compelling disclosure. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n6  37. The movant must show he conferred, or made a good faith effort to confer, with the party \n7  opposing disclosure before seeking court intervention. Id. \n8  At this time, the parties have only met and conferred and failed to come to a resolution \n9  regarding the scope of early discovery. See Dkt. 55, Mungia Dec., ¶ 15; Dkt. 56, Wolfe Dec., ¶¶ \n10  12, 14. The Motion to Compel appears to raise additional sub-issues related to discovery. See \n11  Dkt. 54. It is not clear from the evidence whether the parties have met and conferred by \n12  telephone or in-person and reached an impasse regarding the sub-issues. See Dkt. 54-56, 61-62. \n13  The parties provided email exchanges regarding discovery, but emails are not telephonic or in-\n14  person attempts to resolve discovery disputes, as required by LCR 37.   \n15  For example, Plaintiffs assert their discovery requests are related to class certification. \n16  See Dkt. 66-1. As early as April 25, 2018, Defendants requested clarification regarding what \n17  discovery requests Plaintiffs believe relate to class certification and have been waiting for a \n18  response from Plaintiffs’ counsel regarding the clarifications. See Dkt. 62, Cornelius Dec., ¶¶ 4, \n19  6-9, 11-12, 19-20. Evidence shows Plaintiffs’ counsel has failed to respond, over a period of \n20  several months, to Defendants’ counsels’ requests for clarification and have denied telephone \n21  calls regarding requests for clarification have even occurred. See id. at ¶¶ 11-12; see also Dkt. \n22  63, Luna-Green Dec., ¶¶ 8, 11 (present during April 25, 2018 call, was informed Defendants \n23  would receive a follow-up from Plaintiffs’ counsel and no follow-up has occurred); Dkt. 62, pp. \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 7 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 8 of 14\n \n \n \n1  9-10, 17 (emails exchanged between counsel regarding setting and denial of April 25, 2018 \n2  telephone conference). Thus, there is evidence showing Defendants have attempted to resolve \n3  discovery disputes regarding whether Plaintiffs’ discovery requests are related to class \n4  certification, but Plaintiffs have failed to respond to requests for clarification. The Court, \n5  therefore, finds Plaintiffs have not shown they met and conferred, in good faith, regarding their \n6  assertion that the discovery requests relate to class certification.  \n7  Plaintiffs also argue Defendants have not timely responded to the discovery requests, \n8  which would have been due on June 23, 2018, if the requests were deemed served at the Rule \n9  26(f) conference. See Dkt. 66-1, p. 5. Plaintiffs, however, assert the last meet and confer \n10  conference occurred on June 5, 2018. See id. at p. 4. Therefore, the parties have not met and \n11  conferred regarding the alleged lack of response to the discovery requests if the discovery \n12  requests were deemed served at the Rule 26(f) conference.  \n13  As evidence shows the parties are still engaged in discussions regarding discovery \n14  requests, the parties have not reached an impasse regarding whether the requested discovery \n15  relates to class certification or whether Defendants timely responded to discovery. Therefore, the \n16  Court finds any sub-issues raised in the Motion to Compel or Reply are not ripe for the Court’s \n17  consideration because the good faith meet and confer requirement has not been satisfied. The \n18  parties have only shown they conferred and are at an impasse regarding the scope of early \n19  discovery; therefore, this is the only issue ripe for the Court’s consideration in the Motion to \n20  Compel. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37; LCR 37; Beasley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2014 WL \n21  1268709, at *3 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 25, 2014) (denying motion to compel when there is no \n22  suggestion that the parties reached impasse before the plaintiff filed his motion). \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 8 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 9 of 14\n \n \n \n1  The relevant evidence shows Plaintiffs filed the Motion to Certify on December 21, 2017. \n2  See Dkt. 19. “On January 10, 2018, after discussion with Plaintiffs’ attorney Sal Mungia, \n3  Plaintiffs agreed that Defendants could obtain early discovery for the purpose of response to \n4  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.” Dkt. 63, Luna-Green Dec., ¶ 2. It was the \n5  understanding of Defendants’ counsel, Michelle Luna-Green, that discovery was limited to class \n6  certification issues only, “and that no other agreement was made regarding discovery beyond \n7  class certification.” Id. at ¶ 3. Mr. Mungia stated Plaintiffs agreed, in December of 2017, “that \n8  discovery would start and that the lay-down provision would apply even though no case schedule \n9  had been entered as of that time.” Dkt. 55, Mungia Dec., ¶ 7. On February 20, 2018, Ms. Luna-\n10  Green contacted Mr. Mungia by email stating the parties did not have a meeting of the minds \n11  regarding the scope of discovery. Id. at ¶ 11. On April 23, 2018, Ms. Luna-Green and Mr. \n12  Mungia had a conversation about the scope of discovery. Id. at ¶ 15. “Ms. Luna-Green explained \n13  that it was Defendants’ position that the Plaintiffs are limited to discovery as it pertains to their \n14  individual claims. [Mr. Mungia] explained it was the Plaintiffs’ position that discovery was not \n15  limited.” Id. During a May 24, 2018 telephone call, Defendants’ counsel, Frank Cornelius, \n16  “indicated that it was Defendants’ position that discovery was limited to class certification only, \n17  and Plaintiffs’ counsel indicated it was their position the scope of discovery had not been \n18  limited.” Dkt. 56, Wolfe Dec., ¶ 11. The disputed discovery requests were served on Defendants \n19  prior to the parties’ Rule 26(f) conference. See Dkt. 56, Wolfe Dec., ¶¶ 7-11; Dkt. 62, Cornelius \n20  Dec., ¶ 15. \n21  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(d)(1), \n22  A party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred \nas required by Rule 26(f), except in a proceeding exempted from initial disclosure \n23  under Rule 26(a)(1)(B), or when authorized by these rules, by stipulation, or by \ncourt order. \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 9 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 10 of 14\n \n \n \n1   \n“Discovery is generally not permitted without a court order before the parties have conferred \n2 \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f), unless a party obtains a stipulation or court \n3 \norder to conduct the discovery.” Rose v. Seamless Fin. Corp., 2012 WL 6052006, at *2 (S.D. \n4 \nCal. Dec. 4, 2012). \n5 \n  Here, the parties did not obtain a Court order to begin discovery prior to the Rule 26(f) \n6 \nconference. See Docket. Further, there is no evidence either party obtained a signed stipulation \n7 \nfrom the other party on discovery prior to conferring pursuant to Rule 26(f). Rather, the evidence \n8 \nshows the parties entered an informal agreement regarding discovery. The parties, however, did \n9 \nnot come to a meeting of the minds regarding the scope of the discovery. Defendants understood \n10 \ndiscovery was opened for the limited purpose of both parties conducting discovery related only \n11 \nto class certification. Plaintiffs understood there were no limits to discovery. The Court declines \n12 \nto compel Defendants to produce discovery requested prior to the Rule 26(f) conference when \n13 \nthere was no signed stipulation regarding the scope of discovery or a Court order regarding early \n14 \ndiscovery.  \n15 \nPlaintiffs contend discovery can only be limited by the Court. Dkt. 54. Plaintiffs have not \n16 \ncited to any legal authority stating the parties cannot agree to limit discovery prior to the Rule \n17 \n26(f) conference. The Court finds that, just as parties can enter a stipulation to conduct early \n18 \ndiscovery without a Court order, parties can stipulate to limit the scope of early discovery. \n19 \nTherefore, the Court is not persuaded by Plaintiffs argument. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 29(b) \n20 \n(permitting parties to modify “procedures governing or limiting discovery” by stipulation, unless \n21 \nthe stipulation would “interfere with the time set for completing discovery, for hearing a motion, \n22 \nor for trial,” or “[u]nless the court orders otherwise.”); see also LCR 26 (“Counsel are expected \n23 \nto cooperate with each other to reasonably limit discovery requests”). \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 10 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 11 of 14\n \n \n \n1  For the above reasons, Plaintiffs’ request for an order compelling Defendants to provide \n2  responses to the early discovery is denied.1  \n3  B.  Protective Order \n4  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c): \n5  A party or any person from whom discovery is sought may move for a protective \norder in the court where the action is pending . . . The motion must include a \n6  certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer \nwith other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute without court action. \n7   \nThis Court’s Local Rules also require any motion for a protective order to “include a \n8 \ncertification, in the motion or in a declaration or affidavit, that the movant has engaged in a good \n9 \nfaith meet and confer conference with the other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute \n10 \nwithout court action.” LCR 26(c). Rule 26 states “[t]he certification must list the date, manner, \n11 \nand participants to the conference.” If a certification is not included, the Court many deny the \n12 \nmotion without addressing the merits. LCR 26(c). \n13 \n  The evidence shows the parties began discussing a protective order in March of 2018. See \n14 \nDkt. 57-1; Dkt. 62, Cornelius Dec., ¶ 22. Plaintiffs’ counsel sent a proposed protective order to \n15 \nDefendants’ counsel through email on March 20, 2018. See Dkt. 57-1. On the same date, \n16 \nDefendants’ counsel proposed the Court’s model protective order in response. Dkt. 57-2; Dkt. \n17 \n57-3; Dkt. 61; Dkt. 62, Cornelius Dec., ¶ 21. Following a telephone conversation on March 23, \n18 \n2018 regarding Defendants’ proposed protective order, Plaintiffs took no additional action to \n19 \ncomplete a proposed protective order until May 21, 2018 (2 months later) when one of Plaintiffs’ \n20 \nattorneys sent defense counsel an email. Dkt. 62, Cornelius Dec., ¶ 23. The parties discussed a \n21 \n                                                 \n22 \n1 In challenging Defendants’ objection to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests because the requests call for private \ninmate information, Plaintiffs assert the Court should enter an order pursuant to RCW 70.48.100 if the Court finds \n23 \nredaction of discovery responses that call for private inmate information insufficient. Dkt. 54, pp. 11-12. As the \nCourt declines to compel Defendants to produce the requested discovery, Plaintiffs’ request for an order pursuant to \n24  RCW 70.48.100 is moot. \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 11 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 12 of 14\n \n \n \n1  proposed protective order at the Rule 26(f) conference held on May 24, 2018 and through email \n2  on May 31, 2018. See Dkt. 57-5; Dkt. 62, Cornelius Dec., ¶¶ 24-26. “At the time Plaintiffs filed \n3  their Motion to Compel, [Defendants] were seeking further clarification from Plaintiffs” \n4  regarding topics in the proposed protective order. Dkt. 62, Cornelius Dec., ¶ 27; see Dkt. 62, p. \n5  66 (email dated June 11, 2018 from Defendants’ attorney to Plaintiffs’ attorney seeking \n6  clarification in the proposed protective order).  \n7  While Plaintiffs assert they met and conferred with Defendants regarding the disputed \n8  discovery (see Dkt. 54, p. 7), the evidence before the Court shows the parties have only engaged \n9  in discussions regarding a proposed protective order. The parties have not met and conferred and \n10  failed to come to a resolution prior to involving the Court. Defendants’ counsel was seeking \n11  further clarification of Plaintiffs’ proposed protective order three days prior to Plaintiffs’ filing \n12  the Motion to Compel. There is no evidence Plaintiffs responded to Defendants’ request for \n13  clarification prior to filing the Motion to Compel. As the evidence shows the parties are still \n14  attempting to resolve any disagreement regarding a proposed protective order and have not \n15  reached an impasse, the Court finds the parties have not completed the meet and confer \n16  requirement.  \n17  Therefore, the request for a protective order is denied. The parties are directed to continue \n18  engaging in discussions regarding a proposed protective order. The parties should only seek \n19  Court intervention if the parties reach an impasse on a substantive issue. See Beasley, 2014 WL \n20  1268709 at *3; Branch Banking & Tr. Co. v. Pebble Creek Plaza, LLC, 2013 WL 12176465, at \n21  *1 (D. Nev. July 26, 2013) (judicial intervention is appropriate only when “informal negotiations \n22  have reached an impasse on the substantive issue in dispute”). \n23  C.  Request for Fees and Costs \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 12 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 13 of 14\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs request the Court assess fees and costs for bringing the Motion to Compel. Dkt. \n2  54. The Court finds Plaintiffs have not shown an order compelling discovery responses and a \n3  protective order is appropriate at this time. As the Court is denying the Motion to Compel, the \n4  Court declines to assess fees and costs.  \n5  D.  Stay of Discovery \n6  In light of the conduct described in this Order, particularly Plaintiff’s delay in filing a \n7  motion to amend after notifying defense counsel and the Court of an intent to file a motion to \n8  amend, the Court finds a stay of discovery is appropriate while Plaintiffs determine how their \n9  case will proceed (i.e. on the Complaint or moving to file an amended complaint). Plaintiffs have \n10  indicated they intend to file a motion to amend, but have not informed the Court or defense \n11  counsel what amendments may be made. See Dkt. 49; Dkt. 62, Cornelius Dec. ¶ 17. As an \n12  amended complaint will completely replace the original Complaint, staying discovery promotes \n13  efficiency for the Court and litigants, will not impact any proposed amended complaint, and will \n14  not require the parties to respond to potentially irrelevant or overly burdensome discovery. See \n15  Lope v. Cate, 2014 WL 3587852, at *1 (E.D. Cal. July 21, 2014) (citing Little v. City of Seattle, \n16  863 F.2d 681, 685 (9th Cir. 1988) (“a stay of discovery pending resolution of potentially \n17  dispositive issues furthers the goal of efficiency for the courts and the litigants”); Tradebay, LLC \n18  v. eBay, Inc., 278 F.R.D. 597, 602 (D. Nev. 2011) (in staying discovery, the court considered \n19  “the goal of Rule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which directs that the Rules shall ‘be \n20  construed and administered to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every \n21  action’”).  \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 13 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL-DWC   Document 68   Filed 08/03/18   Page 14 of 14\n \n \n \n1  The stay of discovery will be lifted upon the entry of a scheduling order, which the Court \n2  anticipates will occur after a determination on class certification, or upon an order from this \n3  Court, if the parties move to lift the stay of discovery prior to the scheduling order being entered.  \n4  E.  Conclusion \n5  The Court has reviewed the Motion to Compel and the relevant evidence. For the above \n6  stated reasons, the Court declines to: (1) compel Defendants to respond to Plaintiffs’ early \n7  discovery requests; (2) enter a protective order; and (3) assess fees and costs. Therefore, the \n8  Motion to Compel (Dkt. 54) is denied.2  \n9  III.  Conclusion \n10  In conclusion, the Motion to Strike (Dkt. 52) is granted-in-part: the Motion to Certify \n11  (Dkt. 19) is stricken. The Motion to Compel (Dkt. 54) is denied. Discovery in this matter is \n12  stayed.  \n13  The Clerk is directed to strike the Motion to Certify (Dkt. 19). \n14  Dated this 3rd day of August, 2018. \n15 \nA    \n16 \nDavid W. Christel \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n2 In their Response, Defendants state they are seeking to bifurcate discovery in this case. See Dkt. 61. \nBecause the Court has stayed discovery and there is currently no motion before the Court regarding bifurcation of \n24  discovery, the Court declines to decide whether discovery should be bifurcated at this time. \n \nORDER ON MOTION TO STRIKE AND MOTION \nTO COMPEL - 14 \n ",

Christel. Presently pending before the Court is “Pierce County \n16 \nDefendants’ Motion for 12(b)(1) Dismissal Regarding Administration of Psychiatric Medication \n17 \nto Outgoing Inmates” (“Motion to Dismiss”). Dkt. 27.1 \n18 \n  The Court concludes Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate they have standing to seek \n19 \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief related to the claim that Defendants are refusing to provide \n20 \n21                                                   \n1 The Motion to Dismiss was filed on behalf of all Defendants: Pierce County, Washington, Bruce \n22 \nDammeier, Pierce County Sheriff’s Department, Paul A.

Pastor, Patti Jackson-Kidder, and Janet Rohton. Dkt. 38. On March 28, 2018, the Honorable Ronald B. \nLeighton entered an Order granting the stipulation to dismiss. Dkt. 39. The only remaining Defendants are Pierce \n24  County, Washington and Pierce County Sheriff’s Department. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 1 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 41   Filed 04/17/18   Page 2 of 10\n \n \n \n1  needed psychiatric medications upon release from the Pierce County Jail. Therefore, the Court \n2  recommends Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 27) be granted and this claim be dismissed.  \n3  I.  Background \n4  Plaintiffs Donald Bango and Scott Bailey, individuals incarcerated at the Pierce County \n5  Jail (“Jail”) at the time the Complaint was filed, allege Defendants are failing to provide \n6  adequate mental health treatment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, the \n7  Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), and the Rehabilitation Act. Dkt. 1. Specifically, \n8  Plaintiffs allege Defendants are: (1) failing to provide adequate mental health screenings (“Claim \n9  1”); (2) ignoring clear signs of mental illness and requests for treatment (“Claim 2”); (3) refusing \n10  to provide necessary treatment for mental illnesses (“Claim 3”); (4) delaying and denying basic \n11  mental health care, including medications (“Claim 4”); (5) punishing Plaintiffs for non-violent \n12  behaviors caused by their mental illnesses (“Claim 5”); (6) housing Plaintiffs in solitary \n13  confinement despite clinically proven negative impacts of isolation on individuals with mental \n14  illness (“Claim 6”); and (7) refusing to provide needed psychiatric medications upon release \n15  from the Jail (“Claim 7”). Id.; see also Dkt. 31.  \n16  The only claim at issue in the Motion to Dismiss is Claim 7. See Dkt. 27. On February 2, \n17  2018, Defendants filed the Motion to Dismiss asserting Plaintiffs do not have standing to bring \n18  Claim 7. Id. Plaintiffs filed a Response on February 26, 2018, and Defendants filed a Reply on \n19  March 2, 2018. Dkt. 31, 34. The Court heard oral argument on March 29, 2018. 2 \n20  II.  Motion to Strike \n21  In support of the Motion to Dismiss, Defendants filed copies of portions of Plaintiffs’ \n22  state court criminal records. See Dkt. 28. In their Response, Plaintiffs included a single sentence \n                                                 \n23 \n2 During the hearing, the Court heard argument from Attorney Frank Cornelius, on behalf of Defendants, \n24  and Attorney Sal Mungia, on behalf of Plaintiffs. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 2 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 41   Filed 04/17/18   Page 3 of 10\n \n \n \n1  requesting the Court strike the state court criminal records, stating, “[T]he court records do not \n2  establish Defendants’ contention, which itself is inadmissible to the extent it is based on \n3  speculation and conjecture, and thus should be stricken.” Dkt. 31, p. 9. Here, Plaintiffs provide \n4  no argument explaining why the state court records submitted by Defendants or Defendants’ \n5  arguments are based on speculation and conjecture. See id. Further, Plaintiffs provide no legal \n6  authority supporting their request to strike the records. The Court also notes that, during oral \n7  argument, Plaintiffs cited to the state court records submitted by Defendants. As such, the Court \n8  finds Plaintiffs have not shown it is appropriate to strike the state court records provided by \n9  Defendants. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to strike is denied.  \n10  III.  Standard of Review  \n11  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) authorizes the dismissal of a case for lack of \n12  subject matter jurisdiction. See FED. R. CIV. P. 12. A complaint must be dismissed under Rule \n13  12(b)(1) if, considering the factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the \n14  action: (1) does not arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, or does not \n15  fall within one of the other enumerated categories of Article III Section 2 of the Constitution; (2) \n16  is not a case or controversy within the meaning of the Constitution; or (3) is not one described by \n17  any jurisdictional statute. Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 198 (1962); see 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \n18  question jurisdiction). When determining subject matter jurisdiction, the Court it is not restricted \n19  to the face of the pleadings and may review any evidence to resolve factual disputes concerning \n20  the existence of jurisdiction. McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558, 560 (9th Cir. 1988).  \n21  Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and are presumed to lack subject matter \n22  jurisdiction until the plaintiff establishes otherwise. Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n23  511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994); see also Miguel v. Country Funding Corp., 309 F.3d 1161, 1164 (9th \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 3 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 41   Filed 04/17/18   Page 4 of 10\n \n \n \n1  Cir. 2002). Once subject matter jurisdiction has been challenged, the plaintiff bears the burden of \n2  establishing it. Id. Furthermore, in a class action, a named plaintiff must show that he himself is \n3  subject to a likelihood of future injury. See Matera v. Google Inc., 2016 WL 5339806, at *15 \n4  (N.D. Cal. Sept. 23, 2016). \n5  IV.  Discussion \n6  Defendants assert Plaintiffs lack standing to bring Claim 7. Dkt. 27. The Court agrees. \n7  A.  Facial Attack \n8  Defendants have raised a facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction. See Dkt. 27. \n9  Defendants assert the Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to show Plaintiffs have standing to \n10  bring Claim 7. Id. As Defendants are challenging the sufficiency of the Complaint, this is \n11  considered a facial attack and the Court presumes the factual allegations made in the Complaint \n12  are true. See Wolfe v. Strankman, 392 F.3d 358, 362 (9th Cir. 2004); Safe Air for Everyone v. \n13  Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004) (“In a facial attack, the challenger asserts that the \n14  allegations contained in a complaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction. \n15  By contrast, in a factual attack, the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that, by \n16  themselves, would otherwise invoke federal jurisdiction.”). The Motion to Dismiss should, \n17  therefore, be granted only if Plaintiffs fail to set forth the elements necessary for subject matter \n18  jurisdiction in the Complaint.   \n19  B.  Legal Standard \n20  Under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, this Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction is \n21  limited to deciding “cases” or “controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1; see, e.g., Allen v. \n22  Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984), overruled on other grounds by Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static \n23  Control Components, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377, 1388 (2014). “A suit brought by a plaintiff without \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 4 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 41   Filed 04/17/18   Page 5 of 10\n \n \n \n1  Article III standing is not a ‘case or controversy,’ and an Article III federal court therefore lacks \n2  subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.” Cetacean Cmty. v. Bush, 386 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. \n3  2004). The “irreducible constitutional minimum” of Article III standing contains three elements: \n4  (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact;” (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the \n5  challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is “likely,” as opposed to merely “speculative,” that \n6  the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n7  555, 560–61 (1992). \n8  A plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought. Friends \n9  of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000). In \n10  the Complaint, Plaintiffs seek only injunctive and declaratory relief. See Dkt. 1. “The standing \n11  formulation for a plaintiff seeking prospective injunctive relief is simply one implementation of \n12  Lujan’s requirements. The plaintiff must demonstrate that he has suffered or is threatened with a \n13  ‘concrete and particularized’ legal harm, coupled with ‘a sufficient likelihood that he will again \n14  be wronged in a similar way.’” Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 985 (9th Cir. \n15  2007) (internal citations omitted).  \n16  The issue in this case is whether Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate \n17  they have suffered or are threatened with a concrete and particularized legal harm as to Claim 7. \n18  See Dkt. 27, 31, 34; Oral Argument. A harm is “concrete” if it is “‘real,’ and not ‘abstract.’” \n19  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548 (2016). “For an injury to be ‘particularized,’ it \n20  ‘must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.’” Id. (quoting Lujan, 540 U.S. at 560, \n21  n. 1). The threat of repeated future injury may not be “conjectural or hypothetical.” O’Shea v. \n22  Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974) (internal quotations omitted).  \n23   \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 5 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 41   Filed 04/17/18   Page 6 of 10\n \n \n \n1  C.  Analysis \n2  At oral argument,3 Plaintiffs argued that, to establish standing as to Claim 7, the \n3  Complaint must only allege: (1) the Jail’s policy and practice allows correctional officers to \n4  discharge inmates from the Jail without medication; (2) Plaintiff Bailey4 will be released from \n5  the Jail without medications; and (3) Plaintiff Bailey faces a risk of decompensation5 because he \n6  will be released from the Jail without medications. \n7  In the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege Plaintiff Bailey has been incarcerated at the Jail \n8  approximately eight times since 1999. Dkt. 1, pp. 5, 27. The Complaint contains factual \n9  allegations stemming from Plaintiff Bailey’s lack of mental health treatment during his most \n10  recent incarceration at the Jail. There are no allegations showing his release from Jail is \n11  imminent or that Plaintiff Bailey faces the possibility of being released from the Jail at all. See \n12  Dkt. 1. Plaintiffs have also failed to allege facts showing Plaintiff Bailey faces a risk of \n13  decompensation if he is released from the Jail without medication. Therefore, the Court finds \n14  Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to show any injury related to Claim 7.6  \n15 \n16 \n                                                 \n17 \n3 The Court notes that, in the Complaint and the Response to the Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs allege the \nClaim 7 injury is that inmates are being released without medications, decompensating, and being reincarcerated at \n18 \nthe Jail. See Dkt. 1; Dkt. 31, p. 16. The injury as pled in the Complaint and argued in the Response is even more \nspeculative than the injury argued at oral argument. Furthermore, the alleged injury requires Plaintiffs to violate the \n19  law. Courts have consistently held “[a]n injury based on the threat of future arrests, prosecutions, or convictions is \ntoo conjectural to constitute actual injury because ‘a plaintiff can avoid injury by avoiding illegal conduct.’” Updike \nv. Clackamas Cty., 2015 WL 7722410, at *7 (D. Or. Nov. 30, 2015) (quoting Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, \n20 \n998 (9th Cir. 2012)). \n4 At oral argument, Plaintiffs stated they would only be discussing standing as established by Plaintiff \n21 \nBailey. The Court finds Plaintiffs have conceded the factual allegations related to Plaintiff Bango do not establish \nstanding. Therefore, the Court will not discuss allegations related to Plaintiff Bango. \n22  5 Decompensation is “[t]he appearance or exacerbation of a mental disorder due to failure of defense \nmechanisms.” Stedmans Medical Dictionary (2014). \n6 The Court acknowledges Plaintiffs have alleged there is a practice at the Jail which denies inmates access \n23 \nto mental health medications upon their release to the community. See Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 63-64. Plaintiffs, however, fail to \nallege facts sufficient to show the named Plaintiffs have been injured as a result of an officially sanctioned practice \n24  or face a concrete and particularized injury as a result of the alleged practice. \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 6 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 41   Filed 04/17/18   Page 7 of 10\n \n \n \n1  Furthermore, even if Plaintiffs had alleged facts sufficient to show the three elements \n2  asserted by Plaintiffs, the alleged injury is not real, imminent, or concrete. To reach Plaintiffs’ \n3  conclusion, Plaintiffs’ injury requires, at a minimum, that the Jail release Plaintiff Bailey to the \n4  community. At the time of release, Plaintiff Bailey must be compensated (able to function \n5  despite stressors). The Jail declines to provide Plaintiff Bailey with mental health medications on \n6  release. Plaintiff Bailey attempts, but is unable, to be seen by a primary care physician. Plaintiff \n7  Bailey attempts, but is unable, to obtain medications. And, Plaintiff Bailey faces the risk of \n8  decompensating without his medication. In fact, Plaintiffs allege Defendants have failed to \n9  provide Plaintiff Bailey with effective mediations while housed at the Jail. Thus, as Plaintiff \n10  Bailey is not alleged to be compensated, he cannot show he would decompensate as a result of \n11  the loss of medications upon release. Therefore, the Court finds the contingency of events \n12  required by Plaintiffs is too speculative to find standing. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 106, n. 7 (finding \n13  the plaintiff needed to “credibly allege that he faced a realistic threat from the future application \n14  of the City’s policy”); Nelsen v. King Cty., 895 F.2d 1248, 1252 (9th Cir. 1990) (“Both the \n15  Supreme Court and our circuit have repeatedly found a lack of standing where the litigant’s \n16  claim relies upon a chain of speculative contingencies[.]”); Grundstein v. Washington State, \n17  2012 WL 2514915 (W.D. Wash. June 28, 2012) (“Plaintiff must show a ‘significant likelihood’ \n18  that the rule will be applied to him again in the future.”). \n19  During oral argument, Plaintiffs’ counsel stressed that at the time the Complaint was filed \n20  Plaintiff Bailey had been convicted of a crime and was awaiting sentencing. Therefore, at the \n21  time the Complaint was filed, Plaintiff Bailey could have faced imminent release from the Jail. \n22  These allegations were not pled in the Complaint. See Dkt. 1. Furthermore, while the Court can \n23  review evidence when ruling on a 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, the evidence submitted to the \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 7 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 41   Filed 04/17/18   Page 8 of 10\n \n \n \n1  Court shows only that Plaintiff Bailey was booked into the Jail on April 2, 2017, convicted on \n2  November 6, 2017 of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, and sentenced on January 5, \n3  2018 to fifteen months in prison, 12 of which could be served in community custody, and \n4  committed to the Washington State  Department of Corrections. Dkt. 38, 32-1. There is no \n5  evidence showing Plaintiff Bailey faced imminent release at the time the Complaint was filed, on \n6  December 4, 2017. Rather, the evidence shows he had been convicted of a crime and was \n7  awaiting sentencing when the Complaint was filed. There are no allegations or evidence showing \n8  Plaintiff was going to receive a short sentence, such as time-served. Therefore, Plaintiffs \n9  argument that, at the time the Complaint was filed, Plaintiff Bailey faced imminent release from \n10  the Jail without medications is not supported by the allegations in the Complaint or the evidence \n11  before the Court.  \n12  Plaintiffs contend this case is analogous to Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25 (1993). In \n13  Helling, a prisoner plaintiff brought a claim against prison officials alleging his involuntary \n14  exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) posed an unreasonable risk to his future \n15  health. 509 U.S. at 28-29. The Supreme Court found, “[i]t would be odd to deny an injunction to \n16  inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their prison on the ground \n17  that nothing yet had happened to them.” Id. at 33. The Supreme Court found the plaintiff stated a \n18  cause of action under the Eighth Amendment by alleging the prison officials exposed him to \n19  levels of ETS that posed an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health. Id. at 35. \n20  Initially, the Court notes Helling is not a case about standing. Rather, Helling focuses on \n21  whether a plaintiff can state an Eighth Amendment claim alleging that exposure to a current \n22  situation presents an unreasonable risk of serious injury to the plaintiff’s future heath. In this \n23  case, Defendants are not asserting Plaintiffs cannot state a claim for injunctive relief because a \n24 \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 8 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 41   Filed 04/17/18   Page 9 of 10\n \n \n \n1  lack of medications upon release presents an unreasonable risk of serious damage to Plaintiffs’ \n2  future health. Rather, Defendants assert Plaintiffs do not have standing to bring Claim 7 because \n3  the threat of injury is conjectural and hypothetical. See Dkt. 27. Furthermore, as discussed above, \n4  Plaintiffs have not pled facts sufficient to show Plaintiff Bailey faces a real and immediate threat \n5  of being released from the Jail to the community without medication and faces a risk of \n6  decompensation. Thus, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ assertion that the issue of standing in this case \n7  is analogous to Helling is unfounded.  \n8  Plaintiffs also argue that if Plaintiff Bailey does not have standing to bring this claim, no \n9  one will ever have standing to bring this claim. See Dkt. 31, p. 16. The Supreme Court has held, \n10  “[t]he assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not \n11  a reason to find standing.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 420–21 (2013) (internal \n12  quotations omitted). Therefore, the Court is not persuaded by this argument.  \n13  For the above stated reasons, the Court finds, taking the allegations in the Complaint as \n14  true, Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to show a concrete and particularized injury \n15  as to Claim 7. Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs have failed to establish standing as to \n16  Claim 7.7 \n17  V.  Conclusion  \n18  In conclusion, the Court finds Plaintiffs lack standing to seek declaratory and injunctive \n19  relief related to Claim 7 -- Defendants are allegedly refusing to provide needed psychiatric \n20  medications to Plaintiffs upon release from the Jail. Therefore, the Court finds Claim 7 should be \n21 \n                                                 \n22 \n7 At oral argument, Plaintiffs’ counsel stated Plaintiff Bailey was released from the Jail into the Department \nof Corrections’ custody on January 11, 2018. He was not discharged from the Jail into the community without \n23 \nmedications and does not face a risk of decompensation from that hypothetical discharge. However, as standing is \nestablished at the time the Complaint is filed and as Defendants do not argue mootness, this information is irrelevant \n24  to the standing analysis.  \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION - 9 \n \n\n \nCase 3:17-cv-06002-RBL   Document 41   Filed 04/17/18   Page 10 of 10\n \n \n \n1  dismissed because the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, Court recommends \n2  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 27) be granted and Claim 7 be dismissed from this action.  \n3  Plaintiffs request permission to file an amended complaint if the Motion to Dismiss is \n4  granted. See Dkt. 31, pp. 16-17. The Court recommends Plaintiffs’ request be denied because \n5  Plaintiffs have not shown leave to amend is warranted at this time. However, this \n6  recommendation does not preclude Plaintiffs from filing a motion to amend consistent with local \n7  and federal rules. \n8  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), the parties \n9  shall have fourteen (14) days from service of this Report to file written objections. See also FED. \n10  R. CIV. P. 6. Failure to file objections will result in a waiver of those objections for purposes of \n11  de novo review by the district judge. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C). Accommodating the time \n12  limit imposed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), the clerk is directed to set the matter for \n13  consideration on May 4, 2018, as noted in the caption. \n14  Dated this 17th day of April, 2018. \n15 \nA   \n16 \nDavid W.
