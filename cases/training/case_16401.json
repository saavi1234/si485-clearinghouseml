There is no testimony in the record, no\naffidavits filed, nor any stipulations of fact in this case.\nThus there is little factual record on appeal. To the extent\nthat it is relevant, for the purposes of this appeal, the\nfederal defendant-appellee agrees with the Board's statement\nof facts. It should be noted that the references therein to\nthe transcripts are to representations of counsel.\nAppellants' Appendix contains ten pages of documents\nwhich have not been admitted in evidence in this case (although\npages 2-10 are an exhibit to plaintiffs' complaint). The\nfollowing facts are based primarily on items in that appendix.\nOn May 25, 1977, the Chicago Board of Education adopted\na plan to desegregate the faculties of the Chicago public\nschools (Appendix page 10). Plaintiffs-appellants are\nteachers in the public schools of Chicago who seek to have\nthe implementation of the plan enjoined.\nThe plan was styled \"Plan For the Implementation of the\nProvisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Relative\nto: Integration of Faculties\" (Appendix page 2). This plan was\nadopted by the Chicago Board of Education to settle the difference\nthen existing between the Board and the United States Department\n- 2\n\nof Health, Education and Welfare concerning the Board's\nresponsibility to desegregate its faculties (Appendix page 10).\nThe plan represented the culmination of many months' effort\nand was considered in the best interest of the school system\n(Appendix pages 3 and 10). It was adopted after formal find-\nings by a Department of Health, Education and Welfare Admini-\nstrative Law Judge that the Board had violated Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 by assigning teachers to certain\nschools on the basis of race (Appendix page 10).\nThe plan provided for the transfer of a maximum of\neight percent of the approximately 27,000 teachers employed\nby the Board (Appendix page 3). The goal of the plan was to\nreassign some teachers in the system so that no school would\nhave a faculty over 65 percent white or over 60 percent minority\n(Appendix page 9).\nPlaintiffs, who were assigned to schools for the 1977-78\nschool year, which were different than those to which they had\nbeen assigned to for the 1976-77 school year, filed suit seek-\ning injunctive relief against the Board, certain of its officials,\nand the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to halt the\nimplementation of the plan. Their request for a preliminary\ninjunction was denied on August 30, 1977. This appeal followed.\nLs On September 2, 1977, a panel of this circuit denied a \"motion\n:nce:\nto hear emergency appeal and to reverse order denying injunctive\nit\nrelief.\"\n3\n\nOn September 28, 1977, defendant-appellee Califano filed\nan answer to the complaint raising several defenses while the\nother defendants-appellees filed a motion to dismiss on\nSeptember 30, 1977. This motion is currently under submission\nin the District Court.\nWe note that plaintiffs-appellants abandoned their request\nfor an injunction against the federal defendant-appellee (Pre-\nliminary Injunction Transcript, pages 5-7, 27-28) and thus are not\nseeking an injunction against the federal defendant from this\nCourt.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe standard of appellate review of a denial of a pre-\nliminary injunction is abuse of discretion. The district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in this case. Plaintiffs were\nrequired to demonstrate the existence of the four prerequisites\nto the issuance of a preliminary injunction: (1) likelihood\nof success on the merits, (2) irreparable injury and the lack\nof an adequate remedy at law if the injunction does not issue,\n(3) relative hardship, and (4) service of the public interest.\nPlaintiffs have established none of the four. Thus they have\nno claim that the court below abused its discretion in finding\nthat they were not entitled to a preliminary injunction, the\nissuance of which would have impeded the long-delayed desegrega-\ntion of the Chicago public school teaching staffs.\n- 4 -\n\nARGUMENT \nI. The Standard of Review \nThe burden that appellants carry is difficult. They\nappeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction. Thus they\nmust convince this court to substitute its judgment for that\nof the court below by demonstrating that the district court\nabused its discretion in denying plaintiffs' request for a\npreliminary injunction. Helene Curtis Industries v. Church &\nDwight Co., 560 F. 2d 1325, 1330 (7th Cir. 1977); Washington v.\nWalker, 529 F. 2d 1062, 1065 (7th Cir. 1976); Banks v. Trainor,\n525 F. 2d 837, 841 (7th Cir. 1975), certiorari denied 424 U.S.\n978. Abuse of discretion is the universally accepted standard\nfor the appellate test of a lower court's decision on the\nissuance of a preliminary injunction. Fox Valley Harvestore v.\nA. 0. Smith Harvestore Prod., 545 F. 2d 1096, 1097 (7th Cir.\n1976) citing Morgan v. Fletcher, 518 F. 2d 236, 239 (5th Cir.\n1975). Because abuse of-discretion is the standard, appellate\nreview of the decision on a preliminary injunction application\nis extremely limited. American Medical Association v. Weinberger,\n522 F. 2d 921, 924 (7th Cir. 1975). This court has articulated\nthe standards for determining whether a trial judge has abused\nhis discretion in ruling on an application for a preliminary\ninjunction. \"'Generally, an appellate court may set aside a\ntrial court's exercise of discretion only if the exercise of\nsuch discretion could be said to be arbitrary. [D]iscretion\n- 5\n\nis abused only where no reasonable man would take the view\nadopted by the trial court. If reasonable men could differ\nas to the propriety of the action taken by the trial court, then\nit cannot be said that the trial court abused its discretion.'\"\n(Citations omitted) Particle Data Laboratories, Inc. v.\nCoulter Electronics, Inc., 420 F. 2d 1174, 1178 (7th Cir. 1969)\nquoted in American Medical Association v. Weinberger, 522 F. 2d\n921, 924 (7th Cir. 1975).\nII. The Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction \n\"By now it is axiomatic that a preliminary injunction\nwill not issue unless the movant establishes: (1) reasonable\nprobability of success at trial; (2) irreparable injury; (3)\nlack of serious adverse effects on others; and (4) sufficient\npublic interest.\" Illinois Migrant Council v. Pilliod, 540\nF. 2d 1062, 1069 (7th Cir. 1976) modified on other grounds\nen banc 548 F. 2d 715. Although the precise phrasing of the\nstandard varies, the substance of its requirements does not.\nCompare Fox Valley Harvestore v. A. 0. Smith Harvestore Prod.,\n545 F. 2d 1096, 1097 (7th Cir. 1976); Banks v. Trainor, 525\nF. 2d 837, 841 (7th Cir. 1975), and American Medical Association v\nWeinberger, 522 F. 2d 921, 925 (7th Cir. 1975).\nThis circuit requires that \"plaintiffs carry their burden\nof persuasion as to all of the prerequisites.\" Fox Valley \nHarvestore v. A. 0. Smith Harvestore Prod., supra, 545 F. 2d at\n1097 citing Canal Authority v. Callaway, 489 F. 2d 567, 576 (5th\nCir. 1974).\n6\n\n\"The grant of a preliminary injunction is the exercise\nof an extremely far reaching power not to be indulged in except\nin a case clearly warranting it.\" Fox Valley Harvestore v.\nA. 0. Smith Harvestore Prod., supra, 545 F. 2d at 1097. In\nthe instant case the facts clearly warrant the district court's\nrefusal to grant the preliminary injunction as no element in\nthe calculus of requirements was established.\nHA. The Merits \nOne of the difficulties in reviewing decisions on pre-\nliminary injunctions and determining the relative probability\nof success on the merits is the often amorphous character of\nthe record before the court. See Burns v. Paddock, 503 F. 2d\n18, 28 (7th Cir. 1974).\nPlaintiffs-appellants are teachers in the Chicago public\nschool system. Last summer they and several thousand colleagues\nwere reassigned to different schools than the ones they had\ntaught at the previous year. This action was taken to effectuate\na plan to desegregate the school faculties in the Chicago Public\nSchools. This plan was voluntarily adopted by the Chicago\nv Board of Education to resolve longstanding differences with\nthe United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare\nn regarding compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.). The plaintiffs claim that the\ntransfers violated their constitutional rights and should have\n:h been preliminarily enjoined by the district court.\n- 7\n\nDespite difficulties with the record, there is little\ndisagreement between plaintiffs and the federal defendant on\nthe basic fact that \"Plaintiffs . . . were transferred to new\nteaching positions to achieve the integration of Chicago school\nfaculties.\" (Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants at 27). Similarly,\nall parties agree that the Chicago Board of Education may, under\nIllinois state law, transfer teachers for any reason or for no\nreason at all. (Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants at 27). Also,\nit is collation ground that the Board's transfer authority cannot\nbe exercised in violation of a right secured by the United\nStates Constitution. The difference between the parties lies\nin whether the transfers violated any of plaintiffs-appellants'\nconstitutional rights.\nPlaintiffs' argument that their constitutional rights\nwere violated is threefold: (1) they were denied equal protec-\ntion because they were transferred and others, similarly situated,\nwere not; (2) they were denied procedural due process because\nthey were not accorded a hearing prior to their transfers; and\n(3) they were discriminated against on the basis of race in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment because the transfers\nwere done on the basis of race.\nPlaintiffs' argument that they were denied equal protec-\ntion, because they were transferred and others were not, mis-\napprehends the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause.\nThey concede that it is of no moment to them that they may\n- 8\n1\n(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)\nhave been treated identically with all others, while the Board\nbegan to implement its plans (Plaintiffs-Appellants' Brief at\n10), but they assert that the Constitution requires that the\n\"Board's integration plan . . . not impose a greater burden\nupon those teachers being transferred as opposed to the other\n. . teachers .(cid:9) . not required to bear any of the burden at\nall.\" (Plaintiffs-Appellants Brief at 7). That is, no one\ncan be compelled to transfer. Yet they concede that the Board\nmay transfer teachers for any reason or for no reason at all\n(Plaintiffs-Appellants Brief at 27).\nPlaintiffs argue that their substantive and procedural\ndue process rights were violated because they were entitled\nto a hearing prior to their transfers and the hearings they\nreceived were inadequate. We do not see how they can sustain\nthis premise while conceding that the Board may transfer\nted,(cid:9) teachers for any reason or for no reason. In any event, this\ncontention and its factual underpinnings would need relevant\nevidence in the record before such an argument could be a basis\nfor decision.\nPlaintiffs also contend that the transfers should be\nvoided because race was a factor in the selection of the trans-\nom, \nferees. (Plaintiffs-Appellants' Brief at 24). Plaintiffs\nconcede that race may be taken into account to remedy past\ndiscrimination. They could not do otherwise. Considerations\nof racial factors in undoing unconstitutional segregation are\n- 9 -\n\npermissible. United States v. School District 151 of Cook \nCounty, Illinois, 404 F. 2d 1125, 1135 (7th Cir. 1968). That\nis what occurred here. There was a finding by an administra-\ntive law judge that the Board had assigned teachers and pro-\nfessional staff to certain schools on the basis of race.\n(Plaintiffs-Appellants Statement of the Case #5). The Board\nand HEW agreed on a plan calculated to rectify a situation\nwhich constituted unlawful discrimination. To do so required\nconsiderations of racial factors.\nArguments in opposition to faculty desegregation because\nreassignments would take cognizance of each teacher's race\nhave been rejected by the Supreme Court. In Swann v. Board of \nEducation, 402 U.S. 1, 19 (1971) the Court recited:\n. . . the Mobile school board has argued\nthat the Constitution requires that\nteachers be assigned on a \"color blind\"\nbasis. It also argues that the Constitu-\ntion prohibits district courts from using\ntheir equity power to order assignment of\nteachers to achieve a particular degree\nof faculty desegregation. We reject that\ncontention.\nIn United States v. Montgomery County \nBoard of Education, 395 U.S. 225 (1969),\nthe District Court set as a goal a plan\nof faculty assignment in each school with\na ratio of white to Negro faculty members\nsubstantially the same throughout the system.\nAccord, Davis v. School Commissioners of Mobile County, 402 U.S.\n33, 35 (1971). The foregoing discloses the Supreme Court's\napproval of both race-consciousness in assignment and the\n- 10 -\n\nemployment of numerical ratios of minority to majority teachers\nin remedying proscribed faculty segregation. This remedial\nprocedure has been adopted by those circuits which have\naddressed the problem. See for example, Singleton v. Jackson \nMunicipal Separate School District, 419 F. 2d 1211, 1217-18\n(5th Cir. 1969) (en banc), rev'd in part on timing sub nom.\nCarter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, 396 U.S. 290\n(1970); Nesbit v. Statesvilie.City Board of Education, 418\nF. 2d 1040, 1042 (4th Cir. 1969) (en banc); United States v.\nSchool District of Omaha, 521 F. 2d 530, 546 (8th Cir. 1975);\nKeyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 521 F. 2d 465,\n484 (10th Cir. 1975).\nAs plaintiffs were unable to demonstrate probability of\nsuccess on the merits, the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying the request for a preliminary injunction.\nIIB. Irreparable Injury and the Adequacy of Any Remedy at Law \n\"The basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts has\nalways been irreparable harm and inadequacy of legal remedies.\"\nFox Valley Harvestore v. A. 0. Smith Harvestore Prod., 545 F. 2d\n1096, 1098 (7th Cir. 1976) citing Beacon Theatres v. Westover,\n359 U.S. 500, 506-7 (1959).\nPlaintiffs allege that the violation of their constitutional\nrights constitutes irreparable injury. Assuming arguendo, that\nit is true that a constitutional right of plaintiffs has been\nviolated, they still have not met the burden of demonstrating\ninadequacy of legal remedies.\n\nPlaintiffs could still proceed under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act. 42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq. Washington v.\nWalker, 529 F. 2d 1062, 1065 (7th Cir. 1976). As they have\nfailed to indicate inadequacy of their remedy at law they were\nproperly denied a preliminary injunction below.\nIIC. The Public Interest and Balance of Hardship \nWe do not argue that the plan of faculty desegregation\nadopted here was necessarily the best conceivable. Our position\nis that the adoption of the faculty desegregation plan was, at\nleast, clearly within the broad discretionary powers of the School\n1, \nBoard. Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S.  16 (1971);\nMcDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U.S. 39 (1971). Collaterally, adoption\nand implementation of a faculty desegregation plan was necessary\nto bring the Chicago Board of Education into compliance with\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d\net seq.) is a device whereby the United States conditions receipt\nof federal financial assistance on nondiscrimination on account\nof race, color or national origin by the recipient.\n\"Congress, concerned with the lack of progress in school\ndesegregation, included provisions in the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 to deal with the problem through various agencies of the\nFederal government . . . 42 U.S.C. 2000c et seq.; 2000d et seq.;\nand 2000h-2.\" Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 433\nfn. 2 (1968). The legislation recognizes that the federal\n- 12 -\n\ngovernment may not support, directly or indirectly, proscribed\nracial discrimination. The Congressional declaration in Title\nVI is that racial discrimination in federally assisted programs\nis impermissible. Title VI has been called a restatement of\nthe national policy against government support for segregated\neducation. Green v. Connally, 330 F. Supp. 1150, 1163 (D. D.C.\n1971) (3-judge court), affirmed, sub nom. Coit v. Green, 404 U.S.\n997 (1971).\nThe provisions of Title VI are few and its scheme is\n)L\nrelatively simple. Section 601, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, prohibits\nprograms and activities receiving federal funds from discri-\nminating.\nSection 602, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1 authorizes and directs\neach federal department and agency which extends financial\nassistance to issue rules, regulations and orders of general\napplicability. The requirements of the Act may be enforced by\nt\ntermination of funds. However, no action, including the initia-\ntion of an administrative hearing if one is requested, may be\ntaken until the agency concerned has \"determined that compliance \ncannot be secured by voluntary means.\" Implicit in requiring\nan agency to attempt to secure voluntary compliance, is the\nsimple logic that a school district that has been determined to\n*/\nbe in non-compliance with the Act may voluntarily comply.\n`1 HEW is charged with the responsibility of seeing that school\ndistricts that receive federal financial assistance comply with\nthe Act. In turn, HEW, in order to insure that each recipient\n(footnote continued next page)\n- 13 -\n\nSee Adams v. Richardson, 356 F. Supp. 92 (D. D.C. 1973) aff'd \n480 F. 2d 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1973); Hardy v. Leonard, 377 F. Supp.\n831, 837-8 (N.D. Cal. 1974).\nSection 604, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-3, prohibits discrimination\nin employment practices when the primary objective of the federal\nfinancial assistance is to provide employment, or when the\nemployment practice discriminates against the beneficiaries of\nthe program receiving assistance. United States v. Frazer, 297\nF. Supp. 319, 322 (M.D. Ala. 1968); United States v. Frazer,\n317 F. Supp. 1079, 1083 (M.D. Ala. 1970); United States v.\nJefferson County Board of Education, 372 F. 2d 836, 883 (5th Cir.\n1966) affirmed en banc 380 F. 2d 385 (5th Cir. 1967); 45 C.F.R.\n80.3(c) prohibits discrimination in employment practices, even if\nthe primary purpose of funding is not employment,where the\nemployment practices subject the beneficiaries of programs to\ndiscrimination.\nThe remaining sections of the Act provide that HEW apply\nthe guidelines and criteria for compliance uniformly throughout\nthe United States; and that compliance with a final federal court\norder for desegregation shall be deemed compliance with Title VI.\n42 U.S.C. 2000d-5, 2000d-6.\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nassist it in enforcing the Congressional mandate, requires each\nrecipient to sign an assurance in consideration of and for the\npurpose of obtaining funds. The assurance requires the recipient\n(here, the school district) to immediately take any measures\nnecessary to effectuate the requirements of Title VI. The regula-\ntions promulgated pursuant to Title VI require recipients to take\naffirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.\n45 C.F.R. §80.3(b)(6)(i). See, Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974)\n- 14 -\n\nPending resolution of this action in the court below,\nthe faculty desegregation plan, which is a product of defendants'\ncoordinate responsibilities under Title VI, should not be enjoined.\nThe appropriate rule is desegregation pending litigation.

There is no testimony in the record, no\naffidavits filed, nor any stipulations of fact in this case.\nThus there is little factual record on appeal. To the extent\nthat it is relevant, for the purposes of this appeal, the\nfederal defendant-appellee agrees with the Board's statement\nof facts. It should be noted that the references therein to\nthe transcripts are to representations of counsel.\nAppellants' Appendix contains ten pages of documents\nwhich have not been admitted in evidence in this case (although\npages 2-10 are an exhibit to plaintiffs' complaint). The\nfollowing facts are based primarily on items in that appendix.\nOn May 25, 1977, the Chicago Board of Education adopted\na plan to desegregate the faculties of the Chicago public\nschools (Appendix page 10). Plaintiffs-appellants are\nteachers in the public schools of Chicago who seek to have\nthe implementation of the plan enjoined.\nThe plan was styled \"Plan For the Implementation of the\nProvisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Relative\nto: Integration of Faculties\" (Appendix page 2). This plan was\nadopted by the Chicago Board of Education to settle the difference\nthen existing between the Board and the United States Department\n- 2\n\nof Health, Education and Welfare concerning the Board's\nresponsibility to desegregate its faculties (Appendix page 10).\nThe plan represented the culmination of many months' effort\nand was considered in the best interest of the school system\n(Appendix pages 3 and 10). It was adopted after formal find-\nings by a Department of Health, Education and Welfare Admini-\nstrative Law Judge that the Board had violated Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 by assigning teachers to certain\nschools on the basis of race (Appendix page 10).\nThe plan provided for the transfer of a maximum of\neight percent of the approximately 27,000 teachers employed\nby the Board (Appendix page 3). The goal of the plan was to\nreassign some teachers in the system so that no school would\nhave a faculty over 65 percent white or over 60 percent minority\n(Appendix page 9).\nPlaintiffs, who were assigned to schools for the 1977-78\nschool year, which were different than those to which they had\nbeen assigned to for the 1976-77 school year, filed suit seek-\ning injunctive relief against the Board, certain of its officials,\nand the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to halt the\nimplementation of the plan. Their request for a preliminary\ninjunction was denied on August 30, 1977. This appeal followed.\nLs On September 2, 1977, a panel of this circuit denied a \"motion\n:nce:\nto hear emergency appeal and to reverse order denying injunctive\nit\nrelief.\"\n3\n\nOn September 28, 1977, defendant-appellee Califano filed\nan answer to the complaint raising several defenses while the\nother defendants-appellees filed a motion to dismiss on\nSeptember 30, 1977. This motion is currently under submission\nin the District Court.\nWe note that plaintiffs-appellants abandoned their request\nfor an injunction against the federal defendant-appellee (Pre-\nliminary Injunction Transcript, pages 5-7, 27-28) and thus are not\nseeking an injunction against the federal defendant from this\nCourt.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe standard of appellate review of a denial of a pre-\nliminary injunction is abuse of discretion. The district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in this case. Plaintiffs were\nrequired to demonstrate the existence of the four prerequisites\nto the issuance of a preliminary injunction: (1) likelihood\nof success on the merits, (2) irreparable injury and the lack\nof an adequate remedy at law if the injunction does not issue,\n(3) relative hardship, and (4) service of the public interest.\nPlaintiffs have established none of the four. Thus they have\nno claim that the court below abused its discretion in finding\nthat they were not entitled to a preliminary injunction, the\nissuance of which would have impeded the long-delayed desegrega-\ntion of the Chicago public school teaching staffs.\n- 4 -\n\nARGUMENT \nI. The Standard of Review \nThe burden that appellants carry is difficult. They\nappeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction. Thus they\nmust convince this court to substitute its judgment for that\nof the court below by demonstrating that the district court\nabused its discretion in denying plaintiffs' request for a\npreliminary injunction. Helene Curtis Industries v. Church &\nDwight Co., 560 F. 2d 1325, 1330 (7th Cir. 1977); Washington v.\nWalker, 529 F. 2d 1062, 1065 (7th Cir. 1976); Banks v. Trainor,\n525 F. 2d 837, 841 (7th Cir. 1975), certiorari denied 424 U.S.\n978. Abuse of discretion is the universally accepted standard\nfor the appellate test of a lower court's decision on the\nissuance of a preliminary injunction. Fox Valley Harvestore v.\nA. 0. Smith Harvestore Prod., 545 F. 2d 1096, 1097 (7th Cir.\n1976) citing Morgan v. Fletcher, 518 F. 2d 236, 239 (5th Cir.\n1975). Because abuse of-discretion is the standard, appellate\nreview of the decision on a preliminary injunction application\nis extremely limited. American Medical Association v. Weinberger,\n522 F. 2d 921, 924 (7th Cir. 1975). This court has articulated\nthe standards for determining whether a trial judge has abused\nhis discretion in ruling on an application for a preliminary\ninjunction. \"'Generally, an appellate court may set aside a\ntrial court's exercise of discretion only if the exercise of\nsuch discretion could be said to be arbitrary. [D]iscretion\n- 5\n\nis abused only where no reasonable man would take the view\nadopted by the trial court. If reasonable men could differ\nas to the propriety of the action taken by the trial court, then\nit cannot be said that the trial court abused its discretion.'\"\n(Citations omitted) Particle Data Laboratories, Inc. v.\nCoulter Electronics, Inc., 420 F. 2d 1174, 1178 (7th Cir. 1969)\nquoted in American Medical Association v. Weinberger, 522 F. 2d\n921, 924 (7th Cir. 1975).\nII. The Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction \n\"By now it is axiomatic that a preliminary injunction\nwill not issue unless the movant establishes: (1) reasonable\nprobability of success at trial; (2) irreparable injury; (3)\nlack of serious adverse effects on others; and (4) sufficient\npublic interest.\" Illinois Migrant Council v. Pilliod, 540\nF. 2d 1062, 1069 (7th Cir. 1976) modified on other grounds\nen banc 548 F. 2d 715. Although the precise phrasing of the\nstandard varies, the substance of its requirements does not.\nCompare Fox Valley Harvestore v. A. 0. Smith Harvestore Prod.,\n545 F. 2d 1096, 1097 (7th Cir. 1976); Banks v. Trainor, 525\nF. 2d 837, 841 (7th Cir. 1975), and American Medical Association v\nWeinberger, 522 F. 2d 921, 925 (7th Cir. 1975).\nThis circuit requires that \"plaintiffs carry their burden\nof persuasion as to all of the prerequisites.\" Fox Valley \nHarvestore v. A. 0. Smith Harvestore Prod., supra, 545 F. 2d at\n1097 citing Canal Authority v. Callaway, 489 F. 2d 567, 576 (5th\nCir. 1974).\n6\n\n\"The grant of a preliminary injunction is the exercise\nof an extremely far reaching power not to be indulged in except\nin a case clearly warranting it.\" Fox Valley Harvestore v.\nA. 0. Smith Harvestore Prod., supra, 545 F. 2d at 1097. In\nthe instant case the facts clearly warrant the district court's\nrefusal to grant the preliminary injunction as no element in\nthe calculus of requirements was established.\nHA. The Merits \nOne of the difficulties in reviewing decisions on pre-\nliminary injunctions and determining the relative probability\nof success on the merits is the often amorphous character of\nthe record before the court. See Burns v. Paddock, 503 F. 2d\n18, 28 (7th Cir. 1974).\nPlaintiffs-appellants are teachers in the Chicago public\nschool system. Last summer they and several thousand colleagues\nwere reassigned to different schools than the ones they had\ntaught at the previous year. This action was taken to effectuate\na plan to desegregate the school faculties in the Chicago Public\nSchools. This plan was voluntarily adopted by the Chicago\nv Board of Education to resolve longstanding differences with\nthe United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare\nn regarding compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.). The plaintiffs claim that the\ntransfers violated their constitutional rights and should have\n:h been preliminarily enjoined by the district court.\n- 7\n\nDespite difficulties with the record, there is little\ndisagreement between plaintiffs and the federal defendant on\nthe basic fact that \"Plaintiffs . . . were transferred to new\nteaching positions to achieve the integration of Chicago school\nfaculties.\" (Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants at 27). Similarly,\nall parties agree that the Chicago Board of Education may, under\nIllinois state law, transfer teachers for any reason or for no\nreason at all. (Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants at 27). Also,\nit is collation ground that the Board's transfer authority cannot\nbe exercised in violation of a right secured by the United\nStates Constitution. The difference between the parties lies\nin whether the transfers violated any of plaintiffs-appellants'\nconstitutional rights.\nPlaintiffs' argument that their constitutional rights\nwere violated is threefold: (1) they were denied equal protec-\ntion because they were transferred and others, similarly situated,\nwere not; (2) they were denied procedural due process because\nthey were not accorded a hearing prior to their transfers; and\n(3) they were discriminated against on the basis of race in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment because the transfers\nwere done on the basis of race.\nPlaintiffs' argument that they were denied equal protec-\ntion, because they were transferred and others were not, mis-\napprehends the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause.\nThey concede that it is of no moment to them that they may\n- 8\n1\n(cid:9)\n\n(cid:9)\nhave been treated identically with all others, while the Board\nbegan to implement its plans (Plaintiffs-Appellants' Brief at\n10), but they assert that the Constitution requires that the\n\"Board's integration plan . . . not impose a greater burden\nupon those teachers being transferred as opposed to the other\n. . teachers .(cid:9) . not required to bear any of the burden at\nall.\" (Plaintiffs-Appellants Brief at 7). That is, no one\ncan be compelled to transfer. Yet they concede that the Board\nmay transfer teachers for any reason or for no reason at all\n(Plaintiffs-Appellants Brief at 27).\nPlaintiffs argue that their substantive and procedural\ndue process rights were violated because they were entitled\nto a hearing prior to their transfers and the hearings they\nreceived were inadequate. We do not see how they can sustain\nthis premise while conceding that the Board may transfer\nted,(cid:9) teachers for any reason or for no reason. In any event, this\ncontention and its factual underpinnings would need relevant\nevidence in the record before such an argument could be a basis\nfor decision.\nPlaintiffs also contend that the transfers should be\nvoided because race was a factor in the selection of the trans-\nom, \nferees. (Plaintiffs-Appellants' Brief at 24). Plaintiffs\nconcede that race may be taken into account to remedy past\ndiscrimination. They could not do otherwise. Considerations\nof racial factors in undoing unconstitutional segregation are\n- 9 -\n\npermissible. United States v. School District 151 of Cook \nCounty, Illinois, 404 F. 2d 1125, 1135 (7th Cir. 1968). That\nis what occurred here. There was a finding by an administra-\ntive law judge that the Board had assigned teachers and pro-\nfessional staff to certain schools on the basis of race.\n(Plaintiffs-Appellants Statement of the Case #5). The Board\nand HEW agreed on a plan calculated to rectify a situation\nwhich constituted unlawful discrimination. To do so required\nconsiderations of racial factors.\nArguments in opposition to faculty desegregation because\nreassignments would take cognizance of each teacher's race\nhave been rejected by the Supreme Court. In Swann v. Board of \nEducation, 402 U.S. 1, 19 (1971) the Court recited:\n. . . the Mobile school board has argued\nthat the Constitution requires that\nteachers be assigned on a \"color blind\"\nbasis. It also argues that the Constitu-\ntion prohibits district courts from using\ntheir equity power to order assignment of\nteachers to achieve a particular degree\nof faculty desegregation. We reject that\ncontention.\nIn United States v. Montgomery County \nBoard of Education, 395 U.S. 225 (1969),\nthe District Court set as a goal a plan\nof faculty assignment in each school with\na ratio of white to Negro faculty members\nsubstantially the same throughout the system.\nAccord, Davis v. School Commissioners of Mobile County, 402 U.S.\n33, 35 (1971). The foregoing discloses the Supreme Court's\napproval of both race-consciousness in assignment and the\n- 10 -\n\nemployment of numerical ratios of minority to majority teachers\nin remedying proscribed faculty segregation. This remedial\nprocedure has been adopted by those circuits which have\naddressed the problem. See for example, Singleton v. Jackson \nMunicipal Separate School District, 419 F. 2d 1211, 1217-18\n(5th Cir. 1969) (en banc), rev'd in part on timing sub nom.\nCarter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, 396 U.S. 290\n(1970); Nesbit v. Statesvilie.City Board of Education, 418\nF. 2d 1040, 1042 (4th Cir. 1969) (en banc); United States v.\nSchool District of Omaha, 521 F. 2d 530, 546 (8th Cir. 1975);\nKeyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 521 F. 2d 465,\n484 (10th Cir. 1975).\nAs plaintiffs were unable to demonstrate probability of\nsuccess on the merits, the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying the request for a preliminary injunction.\nIIB. Irreparable Injury and the Adequacy of Any Remedy at Law \n\"The basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts has\nalways been irreparable harm and inadequacy of legal remedies.\"\nFox Valley Harvestore v. A. 0. Smith Harvestore Prod., 545 F. 2d\n1096, 1098 (7th Cir. 1976) citing Beacon Theatres v. Westover,\n359 U.S. 500, 506-7 (1959).\nPlaintiffs allege that the violation of their constitutional\nrights constitutes irreparable injury. Assuming arguendo, that\nit is true that a constitutional right of plaintiffs has been\nviolated, they still have not met the burden of demonstrating\ninadequacy of legal remedies.\n\nPlaintiffs could still proceed under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act. 42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq. Washington v.\nWalker, 529 F. 2d 1062, 1065 (7th Cir. 1976). As they have\nfailed to indicate inadequacy of their remedy at law they were\nproperly denied a preliminary injunction below.\nIIC. The Public Interest and Balance of Hardship \nWe do not argue that the plan of faculty desegregation\nadopted here was necessarily the best conceivable. Our position\nis that the adoption of the faculty desegregation plan was, at\nleast, clearly within the broad discretionary powers of the School\n1, \nBoard. Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S.  16 (1971);\nMcDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U.S. 39 (1971). Collaterally, adoption\nand implementation of a faculty desegregation plan was necessary\nto bring the Chicago Board of Education into compliance with\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d\net seq.) is a device whereby the United States conditions receipt\nof federal financial assistance on nondiscrimination on account\nof race, color or national origin by the recipient.\n\"Congress, concerned with the lack of progress in school\ndesegregation, included provisions in the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 to deal with the problem through various agencies of the\nFederal government . . . 42 U.S.C. 2000c et seq.; 2000d et seq.;\nand 2000h-2.\" Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 433\nfn. 2 (1968). The legislation recognizes that the federal\n- 12 -\n\ngovernment may not support, directly or indirectly, proscribed\nracial discrimination. The Congressional declaration in Title\nVI is that racial discrimination in federally assisted programs\nis impermissible. Title VI has been called a restatement of\nthe national policy against government support for segregated\neducation. Green v. Connally, 330 F. Supp. 1150, 1163 (D. D.C.\n1971) (3-judge court), affirmed, sub nom. Coit v. Green, 404 U.S.\n997 (1971).\nThe provisions of Title VI are few and its scheme is\n)L\nrelatively simple. Section 601, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, prohibits\nprograms and activities receiving federal funds from discri-\nminating.\nSection 602, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1 authorizes and directs\neach federal department and agency which extends financial\nassistance to issue rules, regulations and orders of general\napplicability. The requirements of the Act may be enforced by\nt\ntermination of funds. However, no action, including the initia-\ntion of an administrative hearing if one is requested, may be\ntaken until the agency concerned has \"determined that compliance \ncannot be secured by voluntary means.\" Implicit in requiring\nan agency to attempt to secure voluntary compliance, is the\nsimple logic that a school district that has been determined to\n*/\nbe in non-compliance with the Act may voluntarily comply.\n`1 HEW is charged with the responsibility of seeing that school\ndistricts that receive federal financial assistance comply with\nthe Act. In turn, HEW, in order to insure that each recipient\n(footnote continued next page)\n- 13 -\n\nSee Adams v. Richardson, 356 F. Supp. 92 (D. D.C. 1973) aff'd \n480 F. 2d 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1973); Hardy v. Leonard, 377 F. Supp.\n831, 837-8 (N.D. Cal. 1974).\nSection 604, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-3, prohibits discrimination\nin employment practices when the primary objective of the federal\nfinancial assistance is to provide employment, or when the\nemployment practice discriminates against the beneficiaries of\nthe program receiving assistance. United States v. Frazer, 297\nF. Supp. 319, 322 (M.D. Ala. 1968); United States v. Frazer,\n317 F. Supp. 1079, 1083 (M.D. Ala. 1970); United States v.\nJefferson County Board of Education, 372 F. 2d 836, 883 (5th Cir.\n1966) affirmed en banc 380 F. 2d 385 (5th Cir. 1967); 45 C.F.R.\n80.3(c) prohibits discrimination in employment practices, even if\nthe primary purpose of funding is not employment,where the\nemployment practices subject the beneficiaries of programs to\ndiscrimination.\nThe remaining sections of the Act provide that HEW apply\nthe guidelines and criteria for compliance uniformly throughout\nthe United States; and that compliance with a final federal court\norder for desegregation shall be deemed compliance with Title VI.\n42 U.S.C. 2000d-5, 2000d-6.\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nassist it in enforcing the Congressional mandate, requires each\nrecipient to sign an assurance in consideration of and for the\npurpose of obtaining funds. The assurance requires the recipient\n(here, the school district) to immediately take any measures\nnecessary to effectuate the requirements of Title VI. The regula-\ntions promulgated pursuant to Title VI require recipients to take\naffirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.\n45 C.F.R. §80.3(b)(6)(i). See, Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974)\n- 14 -\n\nPending resolution of this action in the court below,\nthe faculty desegregation plan, which is a product of defendants'\ncoordinate responsibilities under Title VI, should not be enjoined.\nThe appropriate rule is desegregation pending litigation.
