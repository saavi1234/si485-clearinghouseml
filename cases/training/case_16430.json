Procedural History \nOn December 12, 1977, the United States filed its complaint\nin this case (Clerk's Record on Appeal (\"C.R.\") 1). The complaint\nalleged that El Camino Community College (El Camino) is a recipient\nof federal funds, and had refused to comply with a request of the\nthe United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)\nfor information. The request was made pursuant to an HEW investiga-\ntion of El Camino's compliance with Title VI of the 1964 Civil\nRights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq. (C.R. 4, 91)., That\nrefusal, the complaint alleged, .was a violation of Title VI,\nof regulations (45 C.F.R. 80 et seq.) adopted by HEW pursuant\nto its authority under 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1, and of contractural\nassurances previously given HEW by El Camino (C.R. 5).\nThe United States' complaint sought (a) a declaration\nthat El Camino's actions violated Title VI, the regulations, and\nthe contractural assurances, and (b) an injunction requiring\n1/ This question is different from that presented in the\nbrief of El Camino (Br. 1). As summarized at p.(cid:9) infra,\nand explained in more detail at p. 19 and p. 27, infra,\nwe suggest that El Camino's articulation of the Question\nPresented is erroneous.\n\n4111111•1111,\n- 3 -\nEl Camino to provide information requested by HEW (C.R. 6). On\nDecember 27, 1977, the United States filed a motion for preliminary\ninjunction (C.R. 23) seeking similar injunctive relief.\nOn January 9, 1978, El Camino filed a motion to dismiss\n. the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment (Supp.\nR. 264), arguing that HEW's Title VI authority was limited to\nfederally funded programs of the college.\nOn February 24, 1978, the district court held a hearing\nat which both parties agreed that no facts were at issue (Reporter's\nTranscript (\"R.T.\") at 4, 18). ,At that hearing the court stated\nthat the declaratory and injunctive relief requested , by the United\nStates would be granted (R.T. 18). On July 26, 1978, the court\nentered its findings of fact and conclusions of law (C.R. 236-251).\n2/\nIts injunction was entered July 28, 1978.--\nNotice of Appeal was filed on July 31, 1978 (C.R. 253).\nOn August 23, 1978, this Court stayed the order pending appeal.\n2. Facts \nThe facts in this case are not disputed. Title VI of the\n1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits recipients of federal funds from\ndiscriminating on the basis of race, color or national origin\n2/ The separate judgment is not in the Clerk's Record, but\nTi at pp. 58-59 of the Appendix filed with El ,Camino's motion\nfor stay pending appeal.\n\n- 4 -\nagainst any person in any federally funded program, 42 U.S.C.\n2000d. HEW is statutorily authorized to insure that recipients\n.to which it extends funds comply with Title VI. El Camino is\na recipient of several different forms of federal funds (C.R. 73-\n75).\nIn October, 1973, HEW received a complaint from a private\ninstitution about El Camino's treatment of Spanish surnamed\npersons in both employment and educational services (C.R. 88).\nRepresentatives of HEW and El Camino met in June, 1974, to discuss\ninformation HEW wanted for its investigation of El Camino's\nTitle VI compliance (R. 86). Following unsuccessful negotiations\nfor the information, HEW, on December 10, 1974, sent El Camino a\nletter stating that (C.R. 91):\nthe Office for Civil Rights [of HEW]\nhas the responsibility to ensure that\ninstitutions receiving Federal funds\ncomply with the provisions of Title\nVI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act which\nprohibits Federally assisted institu-\ntions from discriminating on the basis\nof race, color, or national origin in\ntheir provision of educational services\nand in employment where it directly\naffects the provision of services\nand/or benefits to students.\nThe letter requested data showing El Camino's workforce, by\nrace and sex, over the past three years, and specific information\nabout recruitment and hiring procedures affecting .. three Deanships\nand two other positions (C.R. 92). The letter also requested a\nbreakdown, by race and sex, of the student body over the past\nthree years, and information about student recruitment, and\nfinancial and academic assistance (C.R. 93-94). Subsequent\n\n- 5 -\ncorrespondence demonstrated that El Camino refused to provide\nthe information requested by HEW (C.R. 96, 102-105, 112), based\non El Camino's view that HEW could request only information\nabout federally assisted programs (R. 112). HEW, on November 3,\n1977, notified El Camino that HEW would be referring the case\nto the Department of Justice (C.R. 120-121) for the enforcement\neffort which is the subject of this appeal.\n3. Opinion of the District Court \nThe district court held that HEW was entitled to the\n3/\ninformation it sought from El Camino.(cid:9) HEW, the court held, has\nauthority to investigate the compliance by recipients of federal\nassistance with the nondiscrimination prohibitions of Title VI\n(C.R. 242-243). The court held that HEW's regulations give it\nauthority to request any information necessary to enable it to\ndetermine whether there is noncompliance with Title VI (C.R. 244-\n245). The court held that the assurance of compliance executed\nby El Camino states that the college will abide by HEW's regula-\ntory requirements, and that those assurances apply to all aspects\nof El Camino's operations (C.R. 245). The court held that when\nHEW is investigating, El. Camino is therefore bound both by the\nregulations and the contractural assurances of compliance to\nprovide information about all aspects of its operation.\n3/ The court's opinion is reported at 454 F. Supp. 825.\n\n- \n6 -\nThe court rejected defendants' argument that information\ncould be requested by HEW only on a \"pinpoint\" basis -- that is,\nthat HEW can seek only information which refers directly to\nfederally funded activities. The court held that discrimination\nin one aspect of an educational system (C.R. 247), including employ-\nment (C.R. 248-250), whether or not it falls directly within a\nfederally assisted program may in some circumstances affect those\nstudents who are the beneficiaries of the federal programs (C.R. 248).\nTherefore, at the investigation stage, HEW is not limited to infor-\nmation on a \"pinpoint\" basis, but may seek information on a broad\nbasis.\nThe court held that the United States had shown sufficient\nbasis to support the injunctive relief it had requested (C.R. 251),\nand permanently enjoined El Camino from refusing to provide HEW with\ninformation requested pursuant to the investigation of El Camino's\n4/\nTitle VI compliance.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThis case arises from an attempt by an administrative\nagency, HEW, to secure judicial enforcement of its request\nfor information, The request was made to El Camino Community\nCollege, a recipient of federal funds, and was intended to\nsecure for HEW information which HEW deemed necessary to enable\n4/ See n. 2, supra.\nL\n\nit to determine whether there was any discrimination practiced\n'by El Camino which in any way affected the operation of federal\nprograms, or the beneficiaries of these programs, which are under\nunder HEW's jurisdiction.\nThe situation before this Court has previously been the\nsubject of much litigation and one for which concrete standards\nexist. The case presents an instance of judicial enforcement of\nr\nan administrative request for information. Thirty-five years\nago, the Supreme Court held that such administrative requests must\nbe judicially enforced when the administrative request is \"not\nplainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose\" of\nthe agency. Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, 317 U.S. 501,\n509 (1943). Accordingly, the order below must be affirmed\nas long as (a) HEW's attempt to investigate is properly within\nthe authority given it by Congress and (b) the information\nit seeks is in any way relevant to that investigation.\nEl Camino concedes, as it must, that HEW has authority to\ninvestigate to determine whether a recipient of federal funds is\ndiscriminating in any programs which utilize these funds. Accord-\ningly, the only question is whether the information sought by HEW\nis relevant to that investigation.\na.\nThe information HEW sought is of a general nature, including\noverall student enrollments and recruitment policies, and employee\nworkforce, recruitment and hiring practices. Insofar as discriminatory\n\n- 8 -\npractices affecting all students may affect those students who are\nspecific beneficiaries of federal programs, we contend that data\ndescribing general, college-wide practices are \"not irrelevant\"\nto determining whether students in federal programs are subject to\ndiscriminatory practices. Similarly, insofar as discrimination\nagainst minority faculty members and applicants may affect the\neducation received by students, data about a college's employment\npractices are also \"not irrelevant\" to determining whether students\nin federal programs are also subjected to any discriminatory treat-\nment. Accordingly, the district court properly ordered compliance\nwith HEW's request for data.\nAs will be discussed, appellant El Camino contends that\nHEW's regulations, which along with the contractural assurances\nprovide the authority for its requests for information, attempt to\ngive HEW the authority to \"regulate\" educational and employment\npractices which are not directly related to federally funded pro-\ngrams. This argument misconstrues the case here on appeal, and for\nthat reason is premature. HEW has made no attempt yet to \"regulate\"\nany practices of El Camino, and the order below does not purport\nto give HEW any such authority. All that has been made is a request\nfor information, and the district court has merely ordered that\ninformation be disclosed to HEW. While El Camino I2s arguments\nconcerning the proper scope and exercise of HEW's fund termination\nauthority may be relevant when, and if, HEW takes such action,\nthese arguments are inappropriate at this stage, where only inves-\ntigatory requests have been enforced.\n\n- 9 -\nARGUMENT\nI\nHEW HAS REGULATORY AND CONTRACTURAL\nAUTHORITY TO REQUIRE RECIPIENTS\nOF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO DISCLOSE\nINFORMATION PURSUANT TO AN\nADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION\nIn passing Section 601 (Title VI) of the 1964 Civil\nRights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, Congress prohibited any form of\ndiscriminatory or exclusionary practices affecting persons on\naccount of race, color or national origin in any program receiving\nfederal financial assistance.(cid:9) In Section 602, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1,\nCongress specifically gave each agency which extends federal\nassistance the authority to issue \"rules, regulations, or orders\nof general applicability\" to insure that the substantive prohi-\nbitions of Section 601 are followed. Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S.\n563, 567 (1974).\nThe Department of Health, Education and Welfare, as\nan agency which disburses federal assistance under numerous\nfederal programs, has passed regulations through which the\nagency attempts to insure that beneficiaries of federal pro-\ngrams are not subjected to discriminatory actions prohibited\nby Title VI. 45 C.F.R. 80.1. Any administrative attempt to\ninsure compliance with Title VI starts with an investigation,\nand the regulations provide authority for the agency to require\nrecipients of federal assistance to provide information which\nmay be necessary to determine their compliance with Title VI.\n\n- 10 -\nThese regulations specifically state that recipients\nof federal funds are obligated to supply to HEW \"such infor-\nmation as the responsible Department official or his designee\nmay determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain\nwhether the recipient has complied or is complying\" with\nTitle VI. 45 C.F.R. 80.6(b). Accordingly, HEW has regulatory\nauthority, pursuant to Congressional authorization, to seek\nsuch information it deems necessary to determine whether\nthere has been compliance with the nondiscrimination prohibi-\ntions of Title VI.\nIn addition, each recipient of federal funds, such as\nEl Camino, must execute an \"assurance of compliance,\" see\n45 C.F.R. 80.4, whereby it agrees to comply with all statutory\n5/\nand regulatory Title VI requirements.(cid:9) That regulation spe-\ncifically states that for institutions of higher education,\nthe assurances \"extend to admission practices and to all other\npractices relating to the treatment of students\", 45 C.F.R.\n80.4(d)(1), and that the assurances \"shall be applicable to the\nentire institution unless the applicant establishes, to the\nsatisfaction of the responsible Department official, that the\ninstitution's practices in designated parts or programs of the\nin \ninstitution will in no way affect its practices  the program of\n5/ El Camino's signed assurance appears at C.R. 85.\n\n- 11 -\nthe institution for which Federal financial assistance is sought,\nor the beneficiaries of or participants in such program.\"\n45 C.F.R. 80.4(d)(2). The record shows that El Camino never\nattempted to show that certain parts of its operation could\nhave no effect on those persons who are benefitting from\nfederal programs.\nUnder this regulatory language, the assurance of compliance\nrepresents that the institutional recipient recognizes HEW's\n6/\nauthority to seek, and the institution's obligation to provide,\ninformation HEW deems necessary to determine the recipient's\ncompliance with Title VI. The regulations recognize that in\ncertain circumstances an institution of higher education may\nprove that certain of its activities can have no effect on any\nbeneficiaries of federal programs. With that one exception,\nthe regulations and contractural assurances establish HEW's\nauthority to require recipients of federal funds to provide\na broad range of information to HEW when the agency attempts\nto determine whether the beneficiaries of federal programs are\nbeing treated in a nondiscriminatory manner.\n6/ The assurance of compliance signed by El Camino states that\nEl Camino \"HEREBY AGREES THAT it will comply with-Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-352) and all requirements\nimposed by or pursuant to the Regulation of the Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare (45 C.F.R. Part 80) issued pur-\nsuant to that Title * * *\" (C.R. 85).\n\n- 12 -\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY REQUIRED\nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE AGENCY'S REQUEST\nFOR INFORMATION\nA. A District Court Must Enforce An \nAgency Request for Information Which \nIs Relevant To A Proper Investigation \nThe Supreme Court and this Court have both addressed\nthe question of judicial enforcement of administrative investi-\ngatory requests for information, and have developed standards\nto guide district courts faced with such requests. The district\ncourt's action in this case is perfectly consistent with the\nstandards developed in these cases.\nIn Endicott Johnson Corporation v. Perkins, 317 U.S.\n501 (1943), the Secretary of Labor, charged with enforcing\nminimum wage act provisions against federal contractors,\nk\n317 U.S. at 502-503, had issued a ruling stating that all of\na manufacturer's employees connected with completion of a\nfederal contract were covered by the terms of the Act.\n317 U.S. at 503-504. The Secretary of Labor sought from\nEndicott Johnson payroll records for all of its manufacturing\nplants. Endicott Johnson refused to turn over al13. of its\npayroll records, contending that the government contracts\nwere performed only at specific plants, and that the Secretary\n\n- 13 -\nwas not entitled to payroll records from other plants. Endicott\nJohnson \"denied that the payroll and similar records sought as\nto such plants were relevant to the determination of any matter\nconfided to the Secretary's determination\", 317 U.S. at 507, and\nthe district court refused to enforce the Secretary's subpoena.\nThe Supreme Court held that the district court must\nenforce the administrator's request for information. The\nCourt noted that the Secretary's statutory authority extended\nonly to employees \"within the benefits of the Act and contracts.\"\n317 U.S. at 508. However, the Court held that the overall pay-\nroll is relevant to the question of coverage of the contracts,\nand possible underpayments, and it is the Secretary's function,\nin the first instance, to determine which employees are covered\nby the Act and the contracts. \"[The Secretary's] scope would\ninclude determining what employees these contracts and the Act\ncovered.\" 317 U.S. at 508.\nThe Court held, 317 U.S. at 508-509, that the Secretary\nneed not determine what employees are covered, and therefore what\ninformation will be used in proving a violation, before seeking\nevidence of underpayments:\n[Such a] ruling would require the'Sec-\nretary, in order to get evidence\nviolation, either to allege she had\ndecided the issue of coverage. before\nthe hearing or to sever the issues\nfor separate hearing and decision.\n\n- 14 -\nThe former would be of dubious propriety,\nand the latter of doubtful practicality.\nThe Secretary is given no power to\ninvestigate mere coverage, as such,\nor to make findings thereon except\nas incident to trial of the issue of\nviolation. No doubt she would have\ndiscretion to take up the issues of\ncoverage for separate and earlier\ntrial if she saw fit. Or, in a case\nsuch as the one revealed by the\npleadings in this one, she might\nfind it advisable to begin by examin-\ning the payroll, for if there were no\nunderpayments found, the issue of\ncoverage would be academic. On the\nadmitted facts of the case, the Dis-\ntrict Court had no authority to\ncontrol her procedure or to condition\nenforcement of her subpoenas upon her\nfirst reaching and announcing a decision\non some of the issues in her administra-\ntive proceeding.\nThe Court then set out what has become the standard for\njudicial enforcement of administrative requests for information\n(317 U.S. at 509):\nThe evidence sought by the subpeona\nwas not plainly incompetent or irrelevant\nto any lawful purpose of the Secretary\nin the discharge of her duties under the\nAct, and it was the duty of the District\nCourt to order its production for the\nSecretary's consideration.\nEndicott Johnson shows that an agency's authority to\nseek evidence for entities subject to its jurisdiction is\nquite broad. At the investigation stage, the agency is not\nexpected, or required, to limit its request in terms of\n\n- 15 -\nultimate violation. At that stage, the agency must be\nauthorized to accumulate sufficient evidence on which to\ndetermine whether a violation of any kind exists. \"The very\npurpose * * * of the authorized investigation, is to discover\nand procure evidence, not to prove a pending charge or complaint,\nbut upon which to make one if, in the Administrator's judgment,\nthe facts thus discovered should justify doing so\", Oklahoma \nPress Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 201 (1946).\nThe Walling case re-emphasized that administrative requests\nfor documents must be judicially enforced following \"the court's\ndetermination that the investigation is authorized by Congress,\nis for a purpose Congress can order, and the documents sought\nare relevant to the inquiry\" and are reasonably described,\n327 U.S. at 209. See also United States v. Morton Salt Co.,\n338 U.S. 632, 652 (1950): \"[I]t is sufficient if the inquiry\nis within the authority of the agency, the demand is not too\nindefinite, and the information sought is reasonably relevant.\"\nSee also United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, 57-58 (1964);\nL. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action (1965),\nat pp. 117-119; K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, §3.12\n(1958).\n3.\nThe decisions of this and other Courts of Jppeals have, of\ncourse, reflected the standards devised by the Supreme Court. In\nFederal Maritime Commission v. Port of Seattle, 521 F.2d 431\n(9th Cir. 1975), this Court reversed a district court which\n\n- 16 -\nrefused to enforce a subpoena of the Federal Maritime Commission,\nbased on a claim of the Port of Seattle that while one part of the\nPort's operation was clearly subject to FMC jurisdiction, other\nparts about which the FMC sought information were not. This\nCourt (521 F.2d at 434) said:\n[T]he Congress and Supreme Court\nhave effectively narrowed the scope\nof the district court's powers to\nascertaining \"whether the information\nsought is relevant to any lawful\npurpose of the administrative\nauthority\". * * * Or as * * * in\nEndicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins,\n317 U.S. at 509 * * * whether the\nevidence sought by the subpeona\nwas not \"plainly incompetent or\nirrelevant\" to \"any lawful purpose\"\nof the agency. If it is not, the\ndistrict court is obligated to compel\nproduction of the documents * * *.\n* * * [E]ach independent regulatory\nadministrative agency has the power\nto obtain the facts requisite to\ndetermining whether it has jurisdiction\nover the matter sought to be investigated.\nAfter the agency has determined its\njurisdiction, that determination may be\nreviewed by the appropriate court.\nAn agency, at the investigation stage, need not conclu-\nsively show that the information will disclose violations which\nare within its jurisdiction.. \"[I]t is hardly a novel proposition\nthat an administrative agency can utilize its(cid:9) investigatory or\n2\nsubpoena powers and that a federal court can grant relief to\naid it in doing so without a prior conclusive showing of statu-\ntory coverage.\" Marshall v. Able Contractors, Inc., 573 F.2d 1055,\n1057 (9th Cir. 1978).(cid:9) In Securities  & Exchange Comm'n v. Brigadoon\n\n- 17 -\nScotch Dist. Co., 480 F.2d 1047 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. denied,\n415 U.S. 915 (1974), the Second Circuit, relying on Supreme\nCourt standards cited above, similarly rejected an argument\nthat certain activities of a company under administrative\nregulation need not be disclosed because administrative\njurisdiction over that aspect of the business had not yet\nbeen conclusively established. The court held that the\nmaterial must be immediately disclosed, as \"the Commission\nmust be free without undue interference or delay to conduct\nan investigation which will adequately develop a factual\nbasis for a determination as to whether particular activities\ncome within the Commission's regulatory authority.\" 480 F.2d\nat 1053.\nAccordingly, affirmance of the order below requires only\nthat this Court find that the district court correctly determined\nthat the request of HEW sought information relevant to a lawful\ninquiry.\nB. The HEW Request Was For Information \nRelevant To A Proper Legal Investigation \n1. The investigation is lawfully within\nHEW's jurisdiction \nIt is undisputed that HEW has authority to investigate\n2\nactions of recipients of federal funds in order to determine\nwhether the recipient is complying with the nondiscrimination\nprovisions of Title VI. 42 U.S.C. 2000d 71. HEW may initiate\n\n- 18 -\ninvestigatory action following either receipt of a complaint,\ni/11 45 C.F.R. 80.7(b), as in this case R. 239), or based on an\nagency decision to conduct a periodic review of the recipient.\n45 C.F.R. 80.7(a).(cid:9) El Camino makes no claim that HEW's\nattempt to make some investigation of federal programs is\nimproper. El Camino objects only to the scope of the\nmaterial sought. f\".\nOnce the court finds that the investigation has a legal\nbasis, the question whether certain material, or actions, may be\nwithin the scope of the agency's statutory authority and are\n1 \ntherefore suitable for investigatory efforts is one initially\n•\nfor the agency to decide. As this Court said in Federal Maritime \nCommission v. Port of Seattle, supra, challenges to the agency's\nexercise of jurisdiction over the material sought to be investi-\ngated may be reviewed in federal court after the agency acts\nsubstantively. 521 F.2d at 434. See also Marshall v. Able\nContractors, Inc., supra, 573 F.2d at 1057. Particularly where,\nas with Title VI, the agency will ultimately have to litigate its\ni\njurisdiction over specific actions of the contractor before it\nfinally acts, see Board of Public Instruction of Taylor County,\nFla. v. Finch, 414 F.2d 1068 (5th Cir. 1969), theme agency itself,\nnot the court, should be to the entity to make the initial\ndetermination of its jurisdiction. Federal Power Commission v.\nLouisiana Power & Light Co., 406 U.S. 621, 647 (1972).\n\n- 19 -\nIn attempting to raise a jurisdictional deficiency, El\nCamino incorrectly describes the purpose for the HEW request,\nand the regulations which provide the legal authority for that\nrequest. El Camino argues that the HEW regulations \"purport to\nauthorize HEW to regulate all educational programs or activities\nP \nat the College regardless of whether or not such programs or acti-\nvities are Federally assisted,\" Br. 19, see also Br. 22, 30, 31,\nand suggests that HEW's request for information is an exercise\nof such authority. Ibid. This argument is both incorrect and\npremature. There has been no attempt at regulation by HEW of\nany actions of El Camino. The only action to date has been a\nrequest for information; the district court opinion orders only\nproduction of this information, and does not purport to give HEW\nauthority to \"regulate\" practices beyond those affecting federally\nfunded programs. Since El Camino, as a recipient of federal funds,\nis subject to HEW investigation of possible discrimination affecting\nthe use of these funds, the investigation is authorized. Were HEW\nto attempt administratively to withhold federal funds based on\nactions not subject to proper Title VI regulation, that action\ncould be challenged in court. See 45 C.F.R. 80.11. Since we are\nnot now at that stage, El Camino's jurisdictional h arguments are\n7/\n2(cid:9)\npremature. Myers v. Bethlehem Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 51 (1938).\n7/ The district court recognized that this case was limited\nto consideration of HEW's investigatory power, and did not\npresent issues of exercise of HEW's authority to terminate\nfederal assistance. \"The distinction between the authority\nto investigate and the power to terminate should not be lost.\"\nR. 248.\n\n- 20 -\nCourts may, of course, terminate the administrative process\nwhen an agency is exercising authorty which had been \"specifically\no \nwithheld,\" Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 189 (1959), a ground\nwhich is to be very narrowly interpreted. Boire v. Greyhound \nCorp., 376 U.S. 473, 481 (1964).(cid:9) El Camino at no point argues\nthat Congress withheld usual administrative investigatory powers\nfrom agencies given the statutory obligation to insure compliance\n8/\nwith Title VI.(cid:9) As demonstrated by Endicott Johnson, supra, even\nwhen an agency has authority only over government contracts,\nits investigatory authority is broad, enabling it to seek any\nsort of information about a contractor which may be at all\nrelevant to the issues over which the agency has regulatory\nauthority. Accordingly, Endicott Johnson, supra, in which\nthe Secretary of Labor was enforcing a statute with a• similar\njurisdictional base as Title VI -- enforcement of statutory\nprohibition attached to federal funds and applicable only to\nrecipients of those funds -- fully supports the argument that\nthe informational request of HEW is perfectly consistent with\nits Title VI investigatory authority, and El Camino cites no\nlegislative language limiting that investigatory authority.\ne.\n8/ El Camino's brief argues that Congress did not intend\nto permit HEW to withhold funds based on broad al.legations\nof discrimination, but instead required HEW to withhold funds\nonly from programs in which discrimination is practiced.\nBr. 11-]8, 24-30. Since this case only presents questions\nof investigatory authority, and not authority to terminate\nfunds, this discussion is irrelevant to the issue before\n1 this Court.\n\n- 21 -\n2. The material HEW sought was relevant\nto determining whether beneficiaries\nof , federally assisted programs were\nsubjected to any  discrimination \nHEW sought information about El Camino's employment and\nhiring practices, and student enrollment, recruitment, and financial\nand academic assistance programs. As stated above, Endicott \nJohnson and later cases state that a district court must enforce\nadministrative requests for information which may be relevant to\na proper administrative investigation. The district court\ncorrectly found the material sought by HEW was relevant to a\nproper Title VI investigation (C.R. 248).\nDiscrimination in many different areas of the operation\nof a college may effect those students who are the beneficiaries\nof federal programs. Providing HEW with information necessary\nto discover whether there is discrimination which generally\naffects student enrollment or employment-practices is necessary\nif the agency is to be able accurately to determine whether\nbeneficiaries of federal programs are free of any discrimina-\ntory practices. In Board  of Public Instruction of Taylor \nCountry, Florida v. Finch, supra, the Fifth Circuit explained\nthat even though termination of federal funds must be directed\n4\nto specific federal programs, discrimination elsewhere in the\noperation of a recipient may affect beneficiaries 9f federal\nprograms therefore and justify termination of'these federal\nprograms. As the Fifth Circuit said, 414 F.2d at 1078-1079:\nIf the funds provided by the grant\nare administered in a discriminatory\nmanner, or if they support a program\nwhich is infected by a discriminatory\nenvironment, then termination of such\nfunds is proper * * *.\n\n* * * In finding that a-termination\nof funds under Title IV of the Civil\nRights Act must-be made on a program\nby program basis, we do not mean to\nindicate that a program must be considered\nin isolation from its context. To say\nthat a program in a school is free from\ndiscrimination because everyone in the\nschool is at liberty to partake of its\nbenefits may or may not be a tenable\nposition. Clearly the racial composition\nof a school's student body, or the racial\ncomposition of its faculty may have an\neffect upon the particular program in\nquestion. But this may not always be\nthe case. In deference to that possibi-\nlity, the administrative agency seeking\nto cut off federal funds must make findings\nof fact indicating either that a partic-\nular program is itself administered\nin a discriminatory manner, or is so\naffected by discriminatory practices\nelsewhere in the school system that\nit thereby becomes discriminatory.\nAccordingly, determination of discrimination affecting federally\nassisted programs requires HEW to determine if there is discrimi-\nnation in any other activities which may affect the students in\nthose programs. The information sought by HEW in this case may\ndisclose, or lead to the discovery of, patterns of college-wide\ndiscrimination'affecting student admissions, or assistance of a\nfinancial or academic nature. Insofar as discrimination of this\nsort could conceivably affect students who have benefitted from\nfederal programs, this information, based on Taylor County, is\nclearly relevant to a proper Title VI investigation.\nIn many circumstances, discrimination in student admission\nor other institution-wide procedures affects all students in a\ndiscriminatory manner, including those who are the beneficiaries\nof federally assisted programs, and therefore supplies a pre-\ndicate for termination of specific programs of federal funds.\n\nMOOMM(cid:9)I\n- 23 -\nFor example, in Bob Jones Univ. v. Johnson, 396 F. Supp. 597\n(D. S.C. 1974), affirmed, 529 F.2d 514 (4th Cir. 1975), the\ncourt held that due to Title VI's prohibitions, Veterans'\nAdministration benefits could not go to a college which practiced\n/a racially discriminatory admission policy. Since the veterans'\npayments depend on admission to a qualified school, there was no\nlimited \"program\" to examine; the entire admissions policy of the\nschool was relevant to a determination whether the beneficiary of the\nfederal funds -- the student granted the VA funds -- was subjected\nto any discrimination. \"The nondiscriminatory participation of\nthese schools is essential if the benefits of these [VA] statutes\nare to flow to beneficiaries without regard to race.\" 396 F. Supp.\nat 603.\nSimilarly, in Flanagan v. President & Directors of \nGeorgetown Col., 417 F. Supp. 377 (D. D.C. 1976), the court\nheld that a college's acceptance of federal funds for construction\nbrought with it an obligation, under Title VI, to refrain from\ndiscrimination in any practices involving students. And in Lau v.\nNichols, supra, the Supreme Court found a school district's failure\nto provide English training to Chinese pupils, which resulted in\nfewer benefits to those students than to English 'speaking students\nwho could fully participate in school activities, was a violation\nof. Title VI. The Court did not require a programmatic breakdown\nof students to find a violation of Title VI.\n\n- 24 -\nEl Camino's argument that even at the investigation stage\nHEW is limited to receiving information only about specific\nfederal programs would effectively prevent the agency from\nreaching an accurate determination whether the beneficiaries of\nfederal programs are in fact treated on a totally nondiscriminatory\nasis. It does HEW little good to know the racial breakdown of\nstudents given assistance under one federal program, without being\nable to determine whether their enrollment in the college was\nbased on application of discriminatory admissions criteria, or\nwhether, following their enrollment, there are any practices which\naffect them a discriminatory manner. Common sense dictates that\ncollege-wide practices are quite relevant to a determination whether\nspecific students at the college have been treated on a nondiscrimi-\n1\nnatory basis. As this Court stated in Federal Maritime Commission v.\nPort of Seattle, supra, 521 F.2d at 434, also within the context\nof administrative investigation,\n[E]fforts have never ceased to try\nto limit the scope of the agencies'\npowers. No better method can be\ndevised than that of limiting the\ninvestigative power and thus crip-\npling the effectiveness of the agency.\nThe employment material sought by HEW is also relevant\nto an administrative investigation to determine whether there\nare any discriminatory practices which affect the beneficiaries\n\n- 25 -\nof Title VI programs. To the extent that these beneficiaries\nre students (except where a federal program is designed speci-\nfically to provide employment, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-3), discrimination\nin employment of teaching and administrative personnel may affect\nthese beneficiaries, and therefore is a proper area of HEW inves-\ntigation.\nThe possible effect on students of discrimination against\nteachers is not a novel concept. In United States v. Jefferson \nCounty Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836, 883-884 (5th Cir. 1966),\naffirmed, 380 F.2d 385 (1967) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom.\nCaddo Parish School Board v. United States, 389 U.S. 840\n(1967), the Fifth Circuit specifically held that desegregation\nof faculties, and nondiscrimination in hiring, is relevant to\ncompliance with Title VI.\nFaculty integration is essential to\nstudent desegregation. -To the extent\nthat teacher discrimination jeopardizes\nthe success of desegregation, it is\nunlawful wholly aside from its effect\nupon individual teachers * * *.\n* * * The right of Negro students to\nbe free of racial discrimination in the\nform of a segregated faculy is part of\ntheir broader right to equal educational\nopportunities.\nSee also Marable v. Alabama Mental Health Board, Z97 F. Supp.\n291 (M.D. Ala. 1969); United States v. Frazer, 297 F. Supp.\n319 (M.D. Ala. 1968).\n\n- 26 -\nIn fact, the Supreme Court has stated that a segregated\nfaculty is itself an indication of a segregated school system.\nSwann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 18 (1971).(cid:9) Certainly\nHEW is entitled to seek data about employment practices in order\nto determine whether discrimination in this area exists and, if\nso, whether it affects beneficiaries of federally funded programs.\nEl Camino argues (Br. 23-32) that HEW cannot seek any\ninformation about employment practices, based on Section 604 of\nTitle VI, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-3, which states:\nNothing contained in this subchapter\nshall be construed to authorize action\nunder this subchapter by any department\nor agency with respect to any employment\npractice of any employer, employment\nagency, or labor organization except where\na primary objective of the Federal financial\nassistance is to provide employment.\nEl Camino's discussion is to the effect that, except where a\nfederal program is intended to provide employment, Title VI\ndoes not authorize HEW to \"regulate the employment policies of\nlocal educational agencies.\"(cid:9) (Br. 30).\nEl Camino again misconstrues the scope of this appeal.\nThe district court's order does not purport to give HEW authority\nwily \nto \"regulate\" El Camino's employment practices,  to receive\ninformation HEW is clearly entitled to secure. This case deals\n\n- 27 -\nolely with the scope of HEW's investigatory authority. As\nstated in Federal Trade Commission v. Texaco, Inc., 555 F.2d\n862, 874 (D.C. Cir.(cid:9) ]977), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 974 (1977),\nthe relevance of the agency's subpoena\nrequests may be measured only against\nthe general purposes of its investiga-\ntion. The district court is not free\nto speculate about the possible charges\nthat might be included in a future\ncomplaint, and then to determine the\nrelevance of the subpoena requests by\nreference to those hypothetical charges.\nThe court must not lose sight of the\nfact that the agency is merely exercising\nits legitimate right to determine the facts,\nand that a complaint may not, and need not,\never issue.\nThe district court in the case presently before this Court\ncorrectly refused to speculate about possible future charges\nand held that HEW was entitled to the material it sought as part\nof a proper Title VI investigation. It correctly rejected the\nidea that HEW must \"pinpoint\" its investigatory requests to\ncorrespond to specific programs which may ultimately be the\nsubject of termination proceedings, holding that the \"pinpoint\"\np\ntheory does not apply at this stage of the administrative\nprocess. C.R. 247. El Camino's speculation provides no basis\nfor reversal of the decision below.\n2\n\n28 -\n- \n9/\nEl Camino's reliance (Br. 36-37) on recent cases\n#11\nholding that HEW cannot seek to require nondiscrimination on the\nbasis of sex in employment by entities covered under Title IX\nof the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.,\nis similarly inapposite to the issue before this Court. Those\ncases hold that HEW cannot use Title IX as a basis for general\nregulation of employment practices. As explained supra, neither\nthe court here, nor HEW, have made such representation concerning\nHEW's authority under Title VI.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the\ndistrict court should be affirmed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nANDREA SHERIDAN ORDIN, DREW S.

Procedural History \nOn December 12, 1977, the United States filed its complaint\nin this case (Clerk's Record on Appeal (\"C.R.\") 1). The complaint\nalleged that El Camino Community College (El Camino) is a recipient\nof federal funds, and had refused to comply with a request of the\nthe United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)\nfor information. The request was made pursuant to an HEW investiga-\ntion of El Camino's compliance with Title VI of the 1964 Civil\nRights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq. (C.R. 4, 91)., That\nrefusal, the complaint alleged, .was a violation of Title VI,\nof regulations (45 C.F.R. 80 et seq.) adopted by HEW pursuant\nto its authority under 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1, and of contractural\nassurances previously given HEW by El Camino (C.R. 5).\nThe United States' complaint sought (a) a declaration\nthat El Camino's actions violated Title VI, the regulations, and\nthe contractural assurances, and (b) an injunction requiring\n1/ This question is different from that presented in the\nbrief of El Camino (Br. 1). As summarized at p.(cid:9) infra,\nand explained in more detail at p. 19 and p. 27, infra,\nwe suggest that El Camino's articulation of the Question\nPresented is erroneous.\n\n4111111•1111,\n- 3 -\nEl Camino to provide information requested by HEW (C.R. 6). On\nDecember 27, 1977, the United States filed a motion for preliminary\ninjunction (C.R. 23) seeking similar injunctive relief.\nOn January 9, 1978, El Camino filed a motion to dismiss\n. the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment (Supp.\nR. 264), arguing that HEW's Title VI authority was limited to\nfederally funded programs of the college.\nOn February 24, 1978, the district court held a hearing\nat which both parties agreed that no facts were at issue (Reporter's\nTranscript (\"R.T.\") at 4, 18). ,At that hearing the court stated\nthat the declaratory and injunctive relief requested , by the United\nStates would be granted (R.T. 18). On July 26, 1978, the court\nentered its findings of fact and conclusions of law (C.R. 236-251).\n2/\nIts injunction was entered July 28, 1978.--\nNotice of Appeal was filed on July 31, 1978 (C.R. 253).\nOn August 23, 1978, this Court stayed the order pending appeal.\n2. Facts \nThe facts in this case are not disputed. Title VI of the\n1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits recipients of federal funds from\ndiscriminating on the basis of race, color or national origin\n2/ The separate judgment is not in the Clerk's Record, but\nTi at pp. 58-59 of the Appendix filed with El ,Camino's motion\nfor stay pending appeal.\n\n- 4 -\nagainst any person in any federally funded program, 42 U.S.C.\n2000d. HEW is statutorily authorized to insure that recipients\n.to which it extends funds comply with Title VI. El Camino is\na recipient of several different forms of federal funds (C.R. 73-\n75).\nIn October, 1973, HEW received a complaint from a private\ninstitution about El Camino's treatment of Spanish surnamed\npersons in both employment and educational services (C.R. 88).\nRepresentatives of HEW and El Camino met in June, 1974, to discuss\ninformation HEW wanted for its investigation of El Camino's\nTitle VI compliance (R. 86). Following unsuccessful negotiations\nfor the information, HEW, on December 10, 1974, sent El Camino a\nletter stating that (C.R. 91):\nthe Office for Civil Rights [of HEW]\nhas the responsibility to ensure that\ninstitutions receiving Federal funds\ncomply with the provisions of Title\nVI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act which\nprohibits Federally assisted institu-\ntions from discriminating on the basis\nof race, color, or national origin in\ntheir provision of educational services\nand in employment where it directly\naffects the provision of services\nand/or benefits to students.\nThe letter requested data showing El Camino's workforce, by\nrace and sex, over the past three years, and specific information\nabout recruitment and hiring procedures affecting .. three Deanships\nand two other positions (C.R. 92). The letter also requested a\nbreakdown, by race and sex, of the student body over the past\nthree years, and information about student recruitment, and\nfinancial and academic assistance (C.R. 93-94). Subsequent\n\n- 5 -\ncorrespondence demonstrated that El Camino refused to provide\nthe information requested by HEW (C.R. 96, 102-105, 112), based\non El Camino's view that HEW could request only information\nabout federally assisted programs (R. 112). HEW, on November 3,\n1977, notified El Camino that HEW would be referring the case\nto the Department of Justice (C.R. 120-121) for the enforcement\neffort which is the subject of this appeal.\n3. Opinion of the District Court \nThe district court held that HEW was entitled to the\n3/\ninformation it sought from El Camino.(cid:9) HEW, the court held, has\nauthority to investigate the compliance by recipients of federal\nassistance with the nondiscrimination prohibitions of Title VI\n(C.R. 242-243). The court held that HEW's regulations give it\nauthority to request any information necessary to enable it to\ndetermine whether there is noncompliance with Title VI (C.R. 244-\n245). The court held that the assurance of compliance executed\nby El Camino states that the college will abide by HEW's regula-\ntory requirements, and that those assurances apply to all aspects\nof El Camino's operations (C.R. 245). The court held that when\nHEW is investigating, El. Camino is therefore bound both by the\nregulations and the contractural assurances of compliance to\nprovide information about all aspects of its operation.\n3/ The court's opinion is reported at 454 F. Supp. 825.\n\n- \n6 -\nThe court rejected defendants' argument that information\ncould be requested by HEW only on a \"pinpoint\" basis -- that is,\nthat HEW can seek only information which refers directly to\nfederally funded activities. The court held that discrimination\nin one aspect of an educational system (C.R. 247), including employ-\nment (C.R. 248-250), whether or not it falls directly within a\nfederally assisted program may in some circumstances affect those\nstudents who are the beneficiaries of the federal programs (C.R. 248).\nTherefore, at the investigation stage, HEW is not limited to infor-\nmation on a \"pinpoint\" basis, but may seek information on a broad\nbasis.\nThe court held that the United States had shown sufficient\nbasis to support the injunctive relief it had requested (C.R. 251),\nand permanently enjoined El Camino from refusing to provide HEW with\ninformation requested pursuant to the investigation of El Camino's\n4/\nTitle VI compliance.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThis case arises from an attempt by an administrative\nagency, HEW, to secure judicial enforcement of its request\nfor information, The request was made to El Camino Community\nCollege, a recipient of federal funds, and was intended to\nsecure for HEW information which HEW deemed necessary to enable\n4/ See n. 2, supra.\nL\n\nit to determine whether there was any discrimination practiced\n'by El Camino which in any way affected the operation of federal\nprograms, or the beneficiaries of these programs, which are under\nunder HEW's jurisdiction.\nThe situation before this Court has previously been the\nsubject of much litigation and one for which concrete standards\nexist. The case presents an instance of judicial enforcement of\nr\nan administrative request for information. Thirty-five years\nago, the Supreme Court held that such administrative requests must\nbe judicially enforced when the administrative request is \"not\nplainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose\" of\nthe agency. Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins, 317 U.S. 501,\n509 (1943). Accordingly, the order below must be affirmed\nas long as (a) HEW's attempt to investigate is properly within\nthe authority given it by Congress and (b) the information\nit seeks is in any way relevant to that investigation.\nEl Camino concedes, as it must, that HEW has authority to\ninvestigate to determine whether a recipient of federal funds is\ndiscriminating in any programs which utilize these funds. Accord-\ningly, the only question is whether the information sought by HEW\nis relevant to that investigation.\na.\nThe information HEW sought is of a general nature, including\noverall student enrollments and recruitment policies, and employee\nworkforce, recruitment and hiring practices. Insofar as discriminatory\n\n- 8 -\npractices affecting all students may affect those students who are\nspecific beneficiaries of federal programs, we contend that data\ndescribing general, college-wide practices are \"not irrelevant\"\nto determining whether students in federal programs are subject to\ndiscriminatory practices. Similarly, insofar as discrimination\nagainst minority faculty members and applicants may affect the\neducation received by students, data about a college's employment\npractices are also \"not irrelevant\" to determining whether students\nin federal programs are also subjected to any discriminatory treat-\nment. Accordingly, the district court properly ordered compliance\nwith HEW's request for data.\nAs will be discussed, appellant El Camino contends that\nHEW's regulations, which along with the contractural assurances\nprovide the authority for its requests for information, attempt to\ngive HEW the authority to \"regulate\" educational and employment\npractices which are not directly related to federally funded pro-\ngrams. This argument misconstrues the case here on appeal, and for\nthat reason is premature. HEW has made no attempt yet to \"regulate\"\nany practices of El Camino, and the order below does not purport\nto give HEW any such authority. All that has been made is a request\nfor information, and the district court has merely ordered that\ninformation be disclosed to HEW. While El Camino I2s arguments\nconcerning the proper scope and exercise of HEW's fund termination\nauthority may be relevant when, and if, HEW takes such action,\nthese arguments are inappropriate at this stage, where only inves-\ntigatory requests have been enforced.\n\n- 9 -\nARGUMENT\nI\nHEW HAS REGULATORY AND CONTRACTURAL\nAUTHORITY TO REQUIRE RECIPIENTS\nOF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO DISCLOSE\nINFORMATION PURSUANT TO AN\nADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION\nIn passing Section 601 (Title VI) of the 1964 Civil\nRights Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, Congress prohibited any form of\ndiscriminatory or exclusionary practices affecting persons on\naccount of race, color or national origin in any program receiving\nfederal financial assistance.(cid:9) In Section 602, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1,\nCongress specifically gave each agency which extends federal\nassistance the authority to issue \"rules, regulations, or orders\nof general applicability\" to insure that the substantive prohi-\nbitions of Section 601 are followed. Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S.\n563, 567 (1974).\nThe Department of Health, Education and Welfare, as\nan agency which disburses federal assistance under numerous\nfederal programs, has passed regulations through which the\nagency attempts to insure that beneficiaries of federal pro-\ngrams are not subjected to discriminatory actions prohibited\nby Title VI. 45 C.F.R. 80.1. Any administrative attempt to\ninsure compliance with Title VI starts with an investigation,\nand the regulations provide authority for the agency to require\nrecipients of federal assistance to provide information which\nmay be necessary to determine their compliance with Title VI.\n\n- 10 -\nThese regulations specifically state that recipients\nof federal funds are obligated to supply to HEW \"such infor-\nmation as the responsible Department official or his designee\nmay determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain\nwhether the recipient has complied or is complying\" with\nTitle VI. 45 C.F.R. 80.6(b). Accordingly, HEW has regulatory\nauthority, pursuant to Congressional authorization, to seek\nsuch information it deems necessary to determine whether\nthere has been compliance with the nondiscrimination prohibi-\ntions of Title VI.\nIn addition, each recipient of federal funds, such as\nEl Camino, must execute an \"assurance of compliance,\" see\n45 C.F.R. 80.4, whereby it agrees to comply with all statutory\n5/\nand regulatory Title VI requirements.(cid:9) That regulation spe-\ncifically states that for institutions of higher education,\nthe assurances \"extend to admission practices and to all other\npractices relating to the treatment of students\", 45 C.F.R.\n80.4(d)(1), and that the assurances \"shall be applicable to the\nentire institution unless the applicant establishes, to the\nsatisfaction of the responsible Department official, that the\ninstitution's practices in designated parts or programs of the\nin \ninstitution will in no way affect its practices  the program of\n5/ El Camino's signed assurance appears at C.R. 85.\n\n- 11 -\nthe institution for which Federal financial assistance is sought,\nor the beneficiaries of or participants in such program.\"\n45 C.F.R. 80.4(d)(2). The record shows that El Camino never\nattempted to show that certain parts of its operation could\nhave no effect on those persons who are benefitting from\nfederal programs.\nUnder this regulatory language, the assurance of compliance\nrepresents that the institutional recipient recognizes HEW's\n6/\nauthority to seek, and the institution's obligation to provide,\ninformation HEW deems necessary to determine the recipient's\ncompliance with Title VI. The regulations recognize that in\ncertain circumstances an institution of higher education may\nprove that certain of its activities can have no effect on any\nbeneficiaries of federal programs. With that one exception,\nthe regulations and contractural assurances establish HEW's\nauthority to require recipients of federal funds to provide\na broad range of information to HEW when the agency attempts\nto determine whether the beneficiaries of federal programs are\nbeing treated in a nondiscriminatory manner.\n6/ The assurance of compliance signed by El Camino states that\nEl Camino \"HEREBY AGREES THAT it will comply with-Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-352) and all requirements\nimposed by or pursuant to the Regulation of the Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare (45 C.F.R. Part 80) issued pur-\nsuant to that Title * * *\" (C.R. 85).\n\n- 12 -\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY REQUIRED\nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE AGENCY'S REQUEST\nFOR INFORMATION\nA. A District Court Must Enforce An \nAgency Request for Information Which \nIs Relevant To A Proper Investigation \nThe Supreme Court and this Court have both addressed\nthe question of judicial enforcement of administrative investi-\ngatory requests for information, and have developed standards\nto guide district courts faced with such requests. The district\ncourt's action in this case is perfectly consistent with the\nstandards developed in these cases.\nIn Endicott Johnson Corporation v. Perkins, 317 U.S.\n501 (1943), the Secretary of Labor, charged with enforcing\nminimum wage act provisions against federal contractors,\nk\n317 U.S. at 502-503, had issued a ruling stating that all of\na manufacturer's employees connected with completion of a\nfederal contract were covered by the terms of the Act.\n317 U.S. at 503-504. The Secretary of Labor sought from\nEndicott Johnson payroll records for all of its manufacturing\nplants. Endicott Johnson refused to turn over al13. of its\npayroll records, contending that the government contracts\nwere performed only at specific plants, and that the Secretary\n\n- 13 -\nwas not entitled to payroll records from other plants. Endicott\nJohnson \"denied that the payroll and similar records sought as\nto such plants were relevant to the determination of any matter\nconfided to the Secretary's determination\", 317 U.S. at 507, and\nthe district court refused to enforce the Secretary's subpoena.\nThe Supreme Court held that the district court must\nenforce the administrator's request for information. The\nCourt noted that the Secretary's statutory authority extended\nonly to employees \"within the benefits of the Act and contracts.\"\n317 U.S. at 508. However, the Court held that the overall pay-\nroll is relevant to the question of coverage of the contracts,\nand possible underpayments, and it is the Secretary's function,\nin the first instance, to determine which employees are covered\nby the Act and the contracts. \"[The Secretary's] scope would\ninclude determining what employees these contracts and the Act\ncovered.\" 317 U.S. at 508.\nThe Court held, 317 U.S. at 508-509, that the Secretary\nneed not determine what employees are covered, and therefore what\ninformation will be used in proving a violation, before seeking\nevidence of underpayments:\n[Such a] ruling would require the'Sec-\nretary, in order to get evidence\nviolation, either to allege she had\ndecided the issue of coverage. before\nthe hearing or to sever the issues\nfor separate hearing and decision.\n\n- 14 -\nThe former would be of dubious propriety,\nand the latter of doubtful practicality.\nThe Secretary is given no power to\ninvestigate mere coverage, as such,\nor to make findings thereon except\nas incident to trial of the issue of\nviolation. No doubt she would have\ndiscretion to take up the issues of\ncoverage for separate and earlier\ntrial if she saw fit. Or, in a case\nsuch as the one revealed by the\npleadings in this one, she might\nfind it advisable to begin by examin-\ning the payroll, for if there were no\nunderpayments found, the issue of\ncoverage would be academic. On the\nadmitted facts of the case, the Dis-\ntrict Court had no authority to\ncontrol her procedure or to condition\nenforcement of her subpoenas upon her\nfirst reaching and announcing a decision\non some of the issues in her administra-\ntive proceeding.\nThe Court then set out what has become the standard for\njudicial enforcement of administrative requests for information\n(317 U.S. at 509):\nThe evidence sought by the subpeona\nwas not plainly incompetent or irrelevant\nto any lawful purpose of the Secretary\nin the discharge of her duties under the\nAct, and it was the duty of the District\nCourt to order its production for the\nSecretary's consideration.\nEndicott Johnson shows that an agency's authority to\nseek evidence for entities subject to its jurisdiction is\nquite broad. At the investigation stage, the agency is not\nexpected, or required, to limit its request in terms of\n\n- 15 -\nultimate violation. At that stage, the agency must be\nauthorized to accumulate sufficient evidence on which to\ndetermine whether a violation of any kind exists. \"The very\npurpose * * * of the authorized investigation, is to discover\nand procure evidence, not to prove a pending charge or complaint,\nbut upon which to make one if, in the Administrator's judgment,\nthe facts thus discovered should justify doing so\", Oklahoma \nPress Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 201 (1946).\nThe Walling case re-emphasized that administrative requests\nfor documents must be judicially enforced following \"the court's\ndetermination that the investigation is authorized by Congress,\nis for a purpose Congress can order, and the documents sought\nare relevant to the inquiry\" and are reasonably described,\n327 U.S. at 209. See also United States v. Morton Salt Co.,\n338 U.S. 632, 652 (1950): \"[I]t is sufficient if the inquiry\nis within the authority of the agency, the demand is not too\nindefinite, and the information sought is reasonably relevant.\"\nSee also United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, 57-58 (1964);\nL. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action (1965),\nat pp. 117-119; K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, §3.12\n(1958).\n3.\nThe decisions of this and other Courts of Jppeals have, of\ncourse, reflected the standards devised by the Supreme Court. In\nFederal Maritime Commission v. Port of Seattle, 521 F.2d 431\n(9th Cir. 1975), this Court reversed a district court which\n\n- 16 -\nrefused to enforce a subpoena of the Federal Maritime Commission,\nbased on a claim of the Port of Seattle that while one part of the\nPort's operation was clearly subject to FMC jurisdiction, other\nparts about which the FMC sought information were not. This\nCourt (521 F.2d at 434) said:\n[T]he Congress and Supreme Court\nhave effectively narrowed the scope\nof the district court's powers to\nascertaining \"whether the information\nsought is relevant to any lawful\npurpose of the administrative\nauthority\". * * * Or as * * * in\nEndicott Johnson Corp. v. Perkins,\n317 U.S. at 509 * * * whether the\nevidence sought by the subpeona\nwas not \"plainly incompetent or\nirrelevant\" to \"any lawful purpose\"\nof the agency. If it is not, the\ndistrict court is obligated to compel\nproduction of the documents * * *.\n* * * [E]ach independent regulatory\nadministrative agency has the power\nto obtain the facts requisite to\ndetermining whether it has jurisdiction\nover the matter sought to be investigated.\nAfter the agency has determined its\njurisdiction, that determination may be\nreviewed by the appropriate court.\nAn agency, at the investigation stage, need not conclu-\nsively show that the information will disclose violations which\nare within its jurisdiction.. \"[I]t is hardly a novel proposition\nthat an administrative agency can utilize its(cid:9) investigatory or\n2\nsubpoena powers and that a federal court can grant relief to\naid it in doing so without a prior conclusive showing of statu-\ntory coverage.\" Marshall v. Able Contractors, Inc., 573 F.2d 1055,\n1057 (9th Cir. 1978).(cid:9) In Securities  & Exchange Comm'n v. Brigadoon\n\n- 17 -\nScotch Dist. Co., 480 F.2d 1047 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. denied,\n415 U.S. 915 (1974), the Second Circuit, relying on Supreme\nCourt standards cited above, similarly rejected an argument\nthat certain activities of a company under administrative\nregulation need not be disclosed because administrative\njurisdiction over that aspect of the business had not yet\nbeen conclusively established. The court held that the\nmaterial must be immediately disclosed, as \"the Commission\nmust be free without undue interference or delay to conduct\nan investigation which will adequately develop a factual\nbasis for a determination as to whether particular activities\ncome within the Commission's regulatory authority.\" 480 F.2d\nat 1053.\nAccordingly, affirmance of the order below requires only\nthat this Court find that the district court correctly determined\nthat the request of HEW sought information relevant to a lawful\ninquiry.\nB. The HEW Request Was For Information \nRelevant To A Proper Legal Investigation \n1. The investigation is lawfully within\nHEW's jurisdiction \nIt is undisputed that HEW has authority to investigate\n2\nactions of recipients of federal funds in order to determine\nwhether the recipient is complying with the nondiscrimination\nprovisions of Title VI. 42 U.S.C. 2000d 71. HEW may initiate\n\n- 18 -\ninvestigatory action following either receipt of a complaint,\ni/11 45 C.F.R. 80.7(b), as in this case R. 239), or based on an\nagency decision to conduct a periodic review of the recipient.\n45 C.F.R. 80.7(a).(cid:9) El Camino makes no claim that HEW's\nattempt to make some investigation of federal programs is\nimproper. El Camino objects only to the scope of the\nmaterial sought. f\".\nOnce the court finds that the investigation has a legal\nbasis, the question whether certain material, or actions, may be\nwithin the scope of the agency's statutory authority and are\n1 \ntherefore suitable for investigatory efforts is one initially\n•\nfor the agency to decide. As this Court said in Federal Maritime \nCommission v. Port of Seattle, supra, challenges to the agency's\nexercise of jurisdiction over the material sought to be investi-\ngated may be reviewed in federal court after the agency acts\nsubstantively. 521 F.2d at 434. See also Marshall v. Able\nContractors, Inc., supra, 573 F.2d at 1057. Particularly where,\nas with Title VI, the agency will ultimately have to litigate its\ni\njurisdiction over specific actions of the contractor before it\nfinally acts, see Board of Public Instruction of Taylor County,\nFla. v. Finch, 414 F.2d 1068 (5th Cir. 1969), theme agency itself,\nnot the court, should be to the entity to make the initial\ndetermination of its jurisdiction. Federal Power Commission v.\nLouisiana Power & Light Co., 406 U.S. 621, 647 (1972).\n\n- 19 -\nIn attempting to raise a jurisdictional deficiency, El\nCamino incorrectly describes the purpose for the HEW request,\nand the regulations which provide the legal authority for that\nrequest. El Camino argues that the HEW regulations \"purport to\nauthorize HEW to regulate all educational programs or activities\nP \nat the College regardless of whether or not such programs or acti-\nvities are Federally assisted,\" Br. 19, see also Br. 22, 30, 31,\nand suggests that HEW's request for information is an exercise\nof such authority. Ibid. This argument is both incorrect and\npremature. There has been no attempt at regulation by HEW of\nany actions of El Camino. The only action to date has been a\nrequest for information; the district court opinion orders only\nproduction of this information, and does not purport to give HEW\nauthority to \"regulate\" practices beyond those affecting federally\nfunded programs. Since El Camino, as a recipient of federal funds,\nis subject to HEW investigation of possible discrimination affecting\nthe use of these funds, the investigation is authorized. Were HEW\nto attempt administratively to withhold federal funds based on\nactions not subject to proper Title VI regulation, that action\ncould be challenged in court. See 45 C.F.R. 80.11. Since we are\nnot now at that stage, El Camino's jurisdictional h arguments are\n7/\n2(cid:9)\npremature. Myers v. Bethlehem Corp., 303 U.S. 41, 51 (1938).\n7/ The district court recognized that this case was limited\nto consideration of HEW's investigatory power, and did not\npresent issues of exercise of HEW's authority to terminate\nfederal assistance. \"The distinction between the authority\nto investigate and the power to terminate should not be lost.\"\nR. 248.\n\n- 20 -\nCourts may, of course, terminate the administrative process\nwhen an agency is exercising authorty which had been \"specifically\no \nwithheld,\" Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 189 (1959), a ground\nwhich is to be very narrowly interpreted. Boire v. Greyhound \nCorp., 376 U.S. 473, 481 (1964).(cid:9) El Camino at no point argues\nthat Congress withheld usual administrative investigatory powers\nfrom agencies given the statutory obligation to insure compliance\n8/\nwith Title VI.(cid:9) As demonstrated by Endicott Johnson, supra, even\nwhen an agency has authority only over government contracts,\nits investigatory authority is broad, enabling it to seek any\nsort of information about a contractor which may be at all\nrelevant to the issues over which the agency has regulatory\nauthority. Accordingly, Endicott Johnson, supra, in which\nthe Secretary of Labor was enforcing a statute with a• similar\njurisdictional base as Title VI -- enforcement of statutory\nprohibition attached to federal funds and applicable only to\nrecipients of those funds -- fully supports the argument that\nthe informational request of HEW is perfectly consistent with\nits Title VI investigatory authority, and El Camino cites no\nlegislative language limiting that investigatory authority.\ne.\n8/ El Camino's brief argues that Congress did not intend\nto permit HEW to withhold funds based on broad al.legations\nof discrimination, but instead required HEW to withhold funds\nonly from programs in which discrimination is practiced.\nBr. 11-]8, 24-30. Since this case only presents questions\nof investigatory authority, and not authority to terminate\nfunds, this discussion is irrelevant to the issue before\n1 this Court.\n\n- 21 -\n2. The material HEW sought was relevant\nto determining whether beneficiaries\nof , federally assisted programs were\nsubjected to any  discrimination \nHEW sought information about El Camino's employment and\nhiring practices, and student enrollment, recruitment, and financial\nand academic assistance programs. As stated above, Endicott \nJohnson and later cases state that a district court must enforce\nadministrative requests for information which may be relevant to\na proper administrative investigation. The district court\ncorrectly found the material sought by HEW was relevant to a\nproper Title VI investigation (C.R. 248).\nDiscrimination in many different areas of the operation\nof a college may effect those students who are the beneficiaries\nof federal programs. Providing HEW with information necessary\nto discover whether there is discrimination which generally\naffects student enrollment or employment-practices is necessary\nif the agency is to be able accurately to determine whether\nbeneficiaries of federal programs are free of any discrimina-\ntory practices. In Board  of Public Instruction of Taylor \nCountry, Florida v. Finch, supra, the Fifth Circuit explained\nthat even though termination of federal funds must be directed\n4\nto specific federal programs, discrimination elsewhere in the\noperation of a recipient may affect beneficiaries 9f federal\nprograms therefore and justify termination of'these federal\nprograms. As the Fifth Circuit said, 414 F.2d at 1078-1079:\nIf the funds provided by the grant\nare administered in a discriminatory\nmanner, or if they support a program\nwhich is infected by a discriminatory\nenvironment, then termination of such\nfunds is proper * * *.\n\n* * * In finding that a-termination\nof funds under Title IV of the Civil\nRights Act must-be made on a program\nby program basis, we do not mean to\nindicate that a program must be considered\nin isolation from its context. To say\nthat a program in a school is free from\ndiscrimination because everyone in the\nschool is at liberty to partake of its\nbenefits may or may not be a tenable\nposition. Clearly the racial composition\nof a school's student body, or the racial\ncomposition of its faculty may have an\neffect upon the particular program in\nquestion. But this may not always be\nthe case. In deference to that possibi-\nlity, the administrative agency seeking\nto cut off federal funds must make findings\nof fact indicating either that a partic-\nular program is itself administered\nin a discriminatory manner, or is so\naffected by discriminatory practices\nelsewhere in the school system that\nit thereby becomes discriminatory.\nAccordingly, determination of discrimination affecting federally\nassisted programs requires HEW to determine if there is discrimi-\nnation in any other activities which may affect the students in\nthose programs. The information sought by HEW in this case may\ndisclose, or lead to the discovery of, patterns of college-wide\ndiscrimination'affecting student admissions, or assistance of a\nfinancial or academic nature. Insofar as discrimination of this\nsort could conceivably affect students who have benefitted from\nfederal programs, this information, based on Taylor County, is\nclearly relevant to a proper Title VI investigation.\nIn many circumstances, discrimination in student admission\nor other institution-wide procedures affects all students in a\ndiscriminatory manner, including those who are the beneficiaries\nof federally assisted programs, and therefore supplies a pre-\ndicate for termination of specific programs of federal funds.\n\nMOOMM(cid:9)I\n- 23 -\nFor example, in Bob Jones Univ. v. Johnson, 396 F. Supp. 597\n(D. S.C. 1974), affirmed, 529 F.2d 514 (4th Cir. 1975), the\ncourt held that due to Title VI's prohibitions, Veterans'\nAdministration benefits could not go to a college which practiced\n/a racially discriminatory admission policy. Since the veterans'\npayments depend on admission to a qualified school, there was no\nlimited \"program\" to examine; the entire admissions policy of the\nschool was relevant to a determination whether the beneficiary of the\nfederal funds -- the student granted the VA funds -- was subjected\nto any discrimination. \"The nondiscriminatory participation of\nthese schools is essential if the benefits of these [VA] statutes\nare to flow to beneficiaries without regard to race.\" 396 F. Supp.\nat 603.\nSimilarly, in Flanagan v. President & Directors of \nGeorgetown Col., 417 F. Supp. 377 (D. D.C. 1976), the court\nheld that a college's acceptance of federal funds for construction\nbrought with it an obligation, under Title VI, to refrain from\ndiscrimination in any practices involving students. And in Lau v.\nNichols, supra, the Supreme Court found a school district's failure\nto provide English training to Chinese pupils, which resulted in\nfewer benefits to those students than to English 'speaking students\nwho could fully participate in school activities, was a violation\nof. Title VI. The Court did not require a programmatic breakdown\nof students to find a violation of Title VI.\n\n- 24 -\nEl Camino's argument that even at the investigation stage\nHEW is limited to receiving information only about specific\nfederal programs would effectively prevent the agency from\nreaching an accurate determination whether the beneficiaries of\nfederal programs are in fact treated on a totally nondiscriminatory\nasis. It does HEW little good to know the racial breakdown of\nstudents given assistance under one federal program, without being\nable to determine whether their enrollment in the college was\nbased on application of discriminatory admissions criteria, or\nwhether, following their enrollment, there are any practices which\naffect them a discriminatory manner. Common sense dictates that\ncollege-wide practices are quite relevant to a determination whether\nspecific students at the college have been treated on a nondiscrimi-\n1\nnatory basis. As this Court stated in Federal Maritime Commission v.\nPort of Seattle, supra, 521 F.2d at 434, also within the context\nof administrative investigation,\n[E]fforts have never ceased to try\nto limit the scope of the agencies'\npowers. No better method can be\ndevised than that of limiting the\ninvestigative power and thus crip-\npling the effectiveness of the agency.\nThe employment material sought by HEW is also relevant\nto an administrative investigation to determine whether there\nare any discriminatory practices which affect the beneficiaries\n\n- 25 -\nof Title VI programs. To the extent that these beneficiaries\nre students (except where a federal program is designed speci-\nfically to provide employment, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-3), discrimination\nin employment of teaching and administrative personnel may affect\nthese beneficiaries, and therefore is a proper area of HEW inves-\ntigation.\nThe possible effect on students of discrimination against\nteachers is not a novel concept. In United States v. Jefferson \nCounty Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836, 883-884 (5th Cir. 1966),\naffirmed, 380 F.2d 385 (1967) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom.\nCaddo Parish School Board v. United States, 389 U.S. 840\n(1967), the Fifth Circuit specifically held that desegregation\nof faculties, and nondiscrimination in hiring, is relevant to\ncompliance with Title VI.\nFaculty integration is essential to\nstudent desegregation. -To the extent\nthat teacher discrimination jeopardizes\nthe success of desegregation, it is\nunlawful wholly aside from its effect\nupon individual teachers * * *.\n* * * The right of Negro students to\nbe free of racial discrimination in the\nform of a segregated faculy is part of\ntheir broader right to equal educational\nopportunities.\nSee also Marable v. Alabama Mental Health Board, Z97 F. Supp.\n291 (M.D. Ala. 1969); United States v. Frazer, 297 F. Supp.\n319 (M.D. Ala. 1968).\n\n- 26 -\nIn fact, the Supreme Court has stated that a segregated\nfaculty is itself an indication of a segregated school system.\nSwann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 18 (1971).(cid:9) Certainly\nHEW is entitled to seek data about employment practices in order\nto determine whether discrimination in this area exists and, if\nso, whether it affects beneficiaries of federally funded programs.\nEl Camino argues (Br. 23-32) that HEW cannot seek any\ninformation about employment practices, based on Section 604 of\nTitle VI, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-3, which states:\nNothing contained in this subchapter\nshall be construed to authorize action\nunder this subchapter by any department\nor agency with respect to any employment\npractice of any employer, employment\nagency, or labor organization except where\na primary objective of the Federal financial\nassistance is to provide employment.\nEl Camino's discussion is to the effect that, except where a\nfederal program is intended to provide employment, Title VI\ndoes not authorize HEW to \"regulate the employment policies of\nlocal educational agencies.\"(cid:9) (Br. 30).\nEl Camino again misconstrues the scope of this appeal.\nThe district court's order does not purport to give HEW authority\nwily \nto \"regulate\" El Camino's employment practices,  to receive\ninformation HEW is clearly entitled to secure. This case deals\n\n- 27 -\nolely with the scope of HEW's investigatory authority. As\nstated in Federal Trade Commission v. Texaco, Inc., 555 F.2d\n862, 874 (D.C. Cir.(cid:9) ]977), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 974 (1977),\nthe relevance of the agency's subpoena\nrequests may be measured only against\nthe general purposes of its investiga-\ntion. The district court is not free\nto speculate about the possible charges\nthat might be included in a future\ncomplaint, and then to determine the\nrelevance of the subpoena requests by\nreference to those hypothetical charges.\nThe court must not lose sight of the\nfact that the agency is merely exercising\nits legitimate right to determine the facts,\nand that a complaint may not, and need not,\never issue.\nThe district court in the case presently before this Court\ncorrectly refused to speculate about possible future charges\nand held that HEW was entitled to the material it sought as part\nof a proper Title VI investigation. It correctly rejected the\nidea that HEW must \"pinpoint\" its investigatory requests to\ncorrespond to specific programs which may ultimately be the\nsubject of termination proceedings, holding that the \"pinpoint\"\np\ntheory does not apply at this stage of the administrative\nprocess. C.R. 247. El Camino's speculation provides no basis\nfor reversal of the decision below.\n2\n\n28 -\n- \n9/\nEl Camino's reliance (Br. 36-37) on recent cases\n#11\nholding that HEW cannot seek to require nondiscrimination on the\nbasis of sex in employment by entities covered under Title IX\nof the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.,\nis similarly inapposite to the issue before this Court. Those\ncases hold that HEW cannot use Title IX as a basis for general\nregulation of employment practices. As explained supra, neither\nthe court here, nor HEW, have made such representation concerning\nHEW's authority under Title VI.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the\ndistrict court should be affirmed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nANDREA SHERIDAN ORDIN, DREW S.

Marsee, \nDefendants-Appellants. \nNo. 78-2720. \nUnited States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. \nJune 21, 1979. \nRehearing Denied August 9, 1979. \nLeroy W. Blankenship, Deputy County Counsel, Los Angeles, Cal., for defendants-\nappellants. \n1259*1259 Walter W. Barnett, Mark L. Gross, Civil Rights Division, Appellate Section, U. S. \nDept. of Justice, Washington, D. C., for plaintiff-appellee. \nBefore CHAMBERS and HUFSTEDLER, Circuit Judges, and SOLOMON,[*] District Judge. \nHUFSTEDLER, Circuit Judge: \nThe Government brought this suit to compel El Camino Community College District \n(\"College\") and its President and District Superintendent, Marsee, to supply the Office for \nCivil Rights (\"OCR\") of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (\"HEW\") with \ninformation about the composition of the College's workforce and student body, its recruiting \nand hiring procedures for academic and other positions, its student recruiting procedures, \nand its financial and academic assistance programs for students. The College declined the \nrequest unless the request was limited to federally-assisted programs or activities. OCR \nrefused to limit its request, efforts to secure voluntary compliance failed, and the \nDepartment of Justice filed this complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the College's \nrefusal to comply with the request for information violated Title VI. The Government sought \na declaratory judgment and an injunction. Following cross-motions for summary judgment, \nthe district court granted a permanent injunction and declaratory relief. The College and \nMarsee appeal.[1] \nOn appeal the College argues that the administrative regulations promulgated by HEW (45 \nC.F.R. Part 80) were in excess of the statutory authority granted by Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d, et seq.) because the regulations purport to \nauthorize the agency to investigate educational programs, activities, and general \nemployment practices of the College which do not receive federal financial assistance. \nBecause the College did not challenge the validity of the regulations below, it cannot do so \nfor the first time on appeal. Our review is limited to the only question properly raised below: \n\n \n \nDo the statutes and regulations prevent HEW from seeking information about programs or \nactivities receiving no federal assistance? \nThe College operates a public community college located in Torrance, California, which \nreceives federal financial assistance for some of its programs. In October, 1973, OCR \nbegan an investigation of a complaint that the College discriminated against Spanish \nsurnamed persons in employment and educational services. OCR requested information \nabout the racial and sexual composition of the College's workforce and student body, about \nits recruiting and hiring procedures, and its programs for granting financial and academic \nassistance to students. \nTitle VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or \nnational origin under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. (42 \nU.S.C. § 2000d.) Under regulations promulgated by HEW to enforce Title VI, OCR is \ndirected to conduct investigations to ascertain possible failures to comply with Title VI. (45 \nC.F.R. § 80.7(c).) Each recipient of federal funds is required to give access to OCR's \nofficials to its \"books, records, accounts, and any other sources of information, and its \nfacilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance . ..\" (45 C.F.R. § 80.6(c).) \nThe regulation that strikes to the heart of the College's contentions is the requirement that \nevery applicant for federal financial assistance through HEW must execute an assurance of \ncompliance with HEW's regulations imposing virtually an open-file examination of all of the \napplicant's records and programs. The pertinent regulations provide: \n1260*1260 \"(1) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance to an institution \nof higher education (including assistance for construction, for research, for special training \nproject, for student loans or for any other purpose), the assurance required by this section \nshall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of \nstudents. \n\"(2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education . . . insofar as \nthe assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other \ntreatment of individuals as students . . . or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of \nservices or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution \nunless the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the responsible Department official, \nthat the institution's practices in designated parts or programs of the institution will in no way \naffect its practices in the program of the institution for which Federal financial assistance is \nsought, or the beneficiaries of or participants in such programs.\" (45 C.F.R. § 80.4(d).) \nThe College executed the required assurance of compliance on February 3, 1965. By their \nplain language, the regulations require the applicant to furnish information about the entire \ninstitution unless the institution successfully carries its burden of showing that the \ninformation \"will in no way affect its practices in the program of the institution for which \nfederal financial assistance is sought, or the beneficiaries of or participants in such \nprograms.\" The College did not carry the heavy burden placed upon it by the regulations. \n\n \n \nIndeed, the College did not try to show that nonfederally funded activities and practices \ncould not affect its federally funded programs. \nIn exercising its investigatory powers, as distinguished from its regulatory or remedial \npowers, HEW must have substantial latitude in scrutinizing policies and practices of the \ninstitution that may have a discriminatory impact on the intended beneficiaries of \nassistance.[2] For example, if the institution received federal funds under the National Direct \nStudent Loan Program and made those benefits available on an equal basis to all of its \nstudents, but the institution refused to admit Spanish surnamed students, potential \nbeneficiaries of the federally funded program would have been denied benefits on the basis \nof their race. An investigation solely of the administration of the loan program would not \nreveal the violation. \nOn the record before us, we have no occasion to decide what information would be relevant \nto the agency's investigation, what information, if any, would be privileged, or the extent to \nwhich, if at all, the agency regulations go beyond the statutory authority committed to the \nagency. \nWe are not unsympathetic to the frustrations of college officials faced with demands by \nHEW officials for massive amounts of information, much of which may ultimately prove \nuseless, and at least some of which may prove to be none of the agency's business. As \nanyone knows who is familiar with the costs of discovery in civil cases, gathering and \ncollating of information, such as that sought by HEW in this case, is extremely costly and \ntime-consuming. All institutions of higher education operate under severe budgetary \nconstraints and many of them are suffering financial crises caused by very high fixed costs, \nspiraling inflation, and changed demographics. \nOur review of this record suggests to us that an employee of OCR, who initially launched \nthis investigation, was insensitive to the legitimate concerns of the College. His conduct \nmay have produced an atmosphere of such antipathy that voluntary 1261*1261 compliance \nthereafter became practicably impossible. Nevertheless, we cannot excuse the College for \nits failure to comply with the regulations that it accepted in obtaining federal funding, nor can \nwe excuse it from making a record that would support its refusal to do so. All we can do is to \nask both the Government and the College to exercise both restraint and good judgment in \ntrying to achieve the ends upon which all parties agree — the highest quality education at \nthe least costly price entirely free from any discriminatory taint.[3] \nAFFIRMED. \n[*] Honorable Gus J. Solomon, Senior United States District Judge, District of Oregon, sitting by designation. \n[1] Hereafter the College and Dr. Marsee will be referred to collectively as \"College.\" \n[2] Regulations promulgated to effectuate the agency's regulatory and remedial powers have little relevance in \ninterpreting regulations governing the investigatory powers. Thus, contrary to the College's argument, regulations \n\n \n \npromulgated to enforce § 602 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1) provide no guidance in construing regulations designed to \nimplement the agency's investigatory powers. \n[3] We are aware of the decisions in Isleboro School Committee v. Califano (1st Cir. 1979) 593 F.2d 424 and Junior \nCollege District of St. Louis v. Califano (8th Cir. 1979) 597 F.2d 119 [No. 78-1830, Apr. 19, 1979]. Neither case is of \nassistance here. In both Isleboro and Junior College, the school districts challenged HEW's regulations, promulgated \nunder Title IX, prohibiting discriminatory employment practices by educational institutions. Both Circuits affirmed the \nrespective district courts in holding that Title IX does not embrace employment discrimination. We do not reach the \nissues in either case because our College did not attack the validity of HEW's regulations in the district court. \n ",

D. California. \nJuly 26, 1978. \n826*826 Drew S. Days, III, Asst. Atty. Gen., Civ. Rights Div., Washington, D. C., Andrea \nSheridan Ordin, U. S. Atty. by James Stotter, II, Asst. U. S. Atty., Los Angeles, Cal., by \nLouie M. Stewart, Sp. Atty., Dept. of Justice, Washington, D. C., for plaintiff. \nJohn H. Larson, County Counsel by Leroy W. Blankenship, Deputy County Counsel, Los \nAngeles, Cal., for defendants. \nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nTAKASUGI, District Judge. \nThis is an action for injunctive and declaratory relief filed pursuant to Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq., by the United States of America. The case \nis before the court on a motion of the plaintiff for preliminary injunction and on a motion of \nthe defendants to dismiss this action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, and alternatively, for summary judgment. \nThis matter was heard on February 24, 1978. The defendants' motion to dismiss, and \nalternatively, for summary judgment was heard as a motion for summary judgment. In \naddition, the counsels for the parties agreed at the hearing to consolidate the entire matter \nas a motion for summary judgment and as a matter for a permanent injunction and \ndeclaratory relief. Counsels agreed there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and \nthat this matter presented only a question of law, to wit; whether the scope of authority of \nthe Office for Civil Rights to investigate compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964 is limited to investigation of the federally assisted programs or activities of a recipient \nof federal financial assistance. \nThe defendants' primary contention is that Title VI applies only to the federally assisted \nprograms or activities and that the scope of investigative authority under Title VI is limited to \nthe scope of authority to terminate federal financial assistance under Title VI. Defendants \ncontend that the Office for Civil Rights is authorized to investigate the programs or activities \nfor which defendant El Camino Community College District receives federal financial \n\n \n \nassistance through the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, but it is not \nauthorized to investigate beyond the federally assisted programs or activities in order to \ndetermine whether the defendants or El Camino College are in compliance with Title VI. \n827*827 The defendants further contend that the authority of the Office for Civil Rights to \ninvestigate the employment practices at El Camino College is limited to investigation of the \nemployment practices in the federally assisted programs or activities where the primary \nobjective of the federal financial assistance is to provide employment. \nAnother contention of the defendants is that the Office for Civil Rights exceeded the scope \nof its investigative authority under Title VI by not limiting its investigation to the federally \nassisted programs or activities. \nAfter careful consideration of the motions, pleadings, affidavits, exhibits, memoranda of \npoints and authorities and oral argument presented by counsels at the hearing, the court \ndenies the defendants' motion for summary judgment, grants a permanent injunction and \ndeclaratory relief and makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law: \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n1. The Office for Civil Rights (herein \"OCR\") of the United States Department of Health, \nEducation, and Welfare (herein \"HEW\") is responsible for administering the provisions of \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq. \n2. Defendant El Camino Community College District (herein \"District\") is a public community \ncollege district organized and operated pursuant to the laws of the State of California. \n3. The District operates one college, El Camino College (herein \"ECC\"), which is located in \nthe City of Torrance, County of Los Angeles, State of California. \n4. At all times material to this action, the District has been receiving, and continues to \nreceive, federal financial assistance through HEW. \n5. During the fiscal year July 1, 1976 to June 30, 1977, the annual budget of the District was \n$29,437,304 of which $1,838,313 was federal financial assistance received by the District \nfrom HEW. In the current fiscal year, July 1, 1977 to June 30, 1978, the annual budget of \nthe District is $31,539,818 of which $1,121,883 is federal financial assistance received by \nthe District from HEW. \n6. Defendant Stuart E. Marsee (herein \"Marsee\") is the Superintendent of the District, \nPresident of ECC, and the person primarily responsible for implementing the rules, \nregulations, and policies of the District's Board of Trustees within ECC. \n\n \n \n7. On February 3, 1965, Marsee executed on behalf of the District an \"Assurance of \nCompliance with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare Regulation under Title \nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" \n8. According to the Affidavit of Marsee, at the time he executed the Assurance of \nCompliance and subsequent thereto, neither he nor the District intended to authorize OCR \nunlimited access to the employment and educational records of the District or of ECC \nconcerning programs or activities for which no federal financial assistance was received or \nto enlarge the scope of the assurance to include non-federally funded programs or \nactivities. \n9. OCR received a complaint from the Council of Chicano Organizations on October 5, 1973 \nand other information alleging that ECC utilized discriminatory practices and procedures \nagainst Spanish-surnamed students in employment and delivery of educational services. \n10. Beginning on June 18, 1974, a series of meetings and oral and written communications \ncommenced between representatives of OCR and school officials of ECC for the purposes \nof investigating the charges of discrimination and determining whether the defendants are in \ncompliance with Title VI and the HEW Regulation under Title VI, 45 C.F.R. Part 80. \n11. The investigative attempts of OCR have consisted of requests to ECC to provide OCR \naccess to certain data and information regarding ECC's employment practices and its \npractices and procedures in delivery of educational services to students. \n828*828 12. Since June 18, 1974, the defendants have refused to voluntarily comply with \nOCR's request for data and information unless such request is limited to the programs or \nactivities for which the District receives federal financial assistance through HEW. \n13. The defendants' position on the matter of voluntary compliance with OCR's request has \nremained unchanged even though on June 4, 1975, OCR notified Marsee by letter that \nECC's refusal to supply the requested data and information is in noncompliance with Title VI \nand that additional efforts would be made to secure voluntary compliance. Nevertheless, the \ndefendants continued to refuse to voluntarily comply with OCR's request. \n14. On May 27, 1977, OCR again notified Marsee by letter that ECC is in noncompliance \nwith Title VI. The letter stated that OCR had determined under 45 C.F.R. § 80.6(b) that ECC \nis not in compliance with Title VI, that OCR has exhausted the possibilities of securing \ncompliance through informal conferences and other voluntary means, and that the matter \nwould be referred to HEW's regional attorney with a request to initiate formal administrative \nenforcement proceedings against ECC. \n15. On November 3, 1977, the Director of OCR notified Marsee by letter that the matter of \nECC's noncompliance with Title VI would be referred to the United States Department of \nJustice for enforcement proceedings and that defendants would have ten days from the \ndate of the letter to voluntarily comply with OCR's request. \n\n \n \n16. As a result of defendants' continued failure and refusal to provide OCR with the \nrequested information even after OCR's efforts to secure voluntary compliance pursuant to \n45 C.F.R. § 80.8, on December 12, 1977, plaintiff United States of America filed a complaint \nseeking an order from the court declaring that defendants' noncompliance with OCR's \nrequest violates Title VI, the HEW Regulation under Title VI and the Assurance of \nCompliance, and enjoining the defendants from refusing to permit OCR access to the data \nand information which is pertinent and necessary to enable OCR to determine whether the \ndefendants are in compliance with Title VI and the HEW Regulation under Title VI, 45 \nC.F.R. Part 80. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n1. This court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this action pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1345 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq. \n2. Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that when a motion is made \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and matters outside the \npleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as a \nmotion for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. In this action, the defendants made a motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \nthe parties presented matters outside the pleadings which have not been excluded by the \ncourt, there is no genuine issue of material fact, and this matter presents a question of law. \nTherefore, the court treats the motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment. \nIn addition, the counsel for the parties agreed at the hearing to consolidate the entire matter \nas a motion for summary judgment and as a matter for a permanent injunction and \ndeclaratory relief since there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and this matter \npresents only a question of law. \n3. As a recipient of federal financial assistance through HEW, the District is subject to Title \nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq., and the HEW Regulation \nunder Title VI, 45 C.F.R. Part 80. \n4. Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any \nfederally assisted program or activity. Section 601 of Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, provides: \n\"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be \nexcluded from participation in, 829*829 be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" \n5. In order to effectuate the remedial purpose of Title VI, the statute should be liberally \nconstrued. As stated in 3 Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction, § 72.05 at 392 \n(4th Ed.1974), \". . . civil rights acts are remedial and should be liberally construed in order \nthat their beneficent objectives may be realized to the fullest extent possible. To this end, \ncourts favor broad and inclusive application of statutory language by which the coverage of \n\n \n \nlegislation to protect and implement civil rights is defined.\" See Bob Jones University v. \nJohnson, 396 F.Supp. 597, 604 (D.S.C. 1974), aff'd 529 F.2d 514 (4th Cir. 1975). \nFurthermore, the construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is \nentitled to be accorded great weight. N. L. R. B. v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 274-\n275, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974); Norwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, 288 \nU.S. 294, 315, 53 S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933). \n6. Section 602 of Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1, provides HEW with the power to issue \n\"rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent with \nachievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the financial assistance in \nconnection with which the action is taken.\" See Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 567, 94 S.Ct. \n786, 39 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974). This section also provides that compliance with any requirement \nadopted pursuant to this section may be effected by termination of federal financial \nassistance proceedings or \"by any other means authorized by law.\" \nThe regulations promulgated by HEW pursuant to Section 602 of Title VI are contained in \n45 C.F.R. Part 80. The validity of these regulations is not at issue in this action as neither \nparty has raised any constitutional or other challenges to the regulations. \n7. The nature and scope of an OCR investigation of a recipient of federal financial \nassistance to determine whether the recipient is in compliance with Title VI may be \ndetermined by a complaint filed with OCR, but OCR is not limited to an investigation of the \nallegations in the complaint. According to 45 C.F.R. § 80.7(c), OCR has the following \ninvestigative authority: \n\"The responsible Department official or his designee will make a prompt investigation \nwhenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a \npossible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should include, where \nappropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the \ncircumstances under which the possible noncompliance with the part occurred, and other \nfactors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this \npart.\" \nIn addition, 45 C.F.R. § 80.7(a) directs OCR to conduct periodic compliance reviews of the \npractices of recipients to determine whether they are in compliance with 45 C.F.R. Part 80. \n8. According to the pertinent parts of 45 C.F.R. § 80.6, OCR is entitled to obtain the \nfollowing information in order to determine whether a recipient of federal financial \nassistance is in compliance with Title VI: \n\"(b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the \nresponsible Department official or his designee timely, complete and accurate compliance \nreports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the responsible \n\n \n \nDepartment official or his designee may determine to be necessary to enable him to \nascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with his part. . . .\" \n\"(c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit access by the responsible \nDepartment official or his designee during normal business hours to such of its books, \nrecords, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to \nascertain compliance with this part.\" \nTherefore, the HEW regulations provide OCR with the authority to seek and \nobtain 830*830 information which is \"pertinent to ascertain compliance\" and to determine the \namount and type of information that is necessary to enable OCR to ascertain whether a \nrecipient is in compliance with Title VI and the HEW Regulation under Title VI, 45 C.F.R. \nPart 80. \n9. The assurance of compliance, which is required with every application for federal \nfinancial assistance through HEW pursuant to 45 C.F.R. § 80.4 and which was executed on \nFebruary 3, 1965, by Marsee on behalf of the District, is not only applicable to the federally \nassisted programs or activities as the defendants contend but is applicable to the entire \ninstitution unless the contrary is established in accordance with 45 C.F.R. § 80.4(d)(2). \nThe relevant parts of 45 C.F.R. § 80.4(d) provide: \n\"(1) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher \neducation (including assistance for construction, for research, for special training project, for \nstudent loans or for any other purpose), the assurance required by this section shall extend \nto admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students. \n\"(2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education . . . insofar as \nthe assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other \ntreatment of individuals as students . . . or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of \nservices or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution \nunless the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the responsible Department official, \nthat the institution's practices in designated parts or programs of the institution will in no way \naffect its practices in the program of the institution for which Federal financial assistance is \nsought, or the beneficiaries of or participants in such programs.\" (Emphasis added). \nThe assurance of compliance executed by Marsee on behalf of the District provides that the \nDistrict \"AGREES THAT it will comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-\n352) and all requirements imposed by or pursuant to the Regulation of the Department of \nHealth, Education and Welfare (45 CFR Part 80) issued pursuant to that title . . .\" and \n\"GIVES ASSURANCE THAT it will immediately take any measures necessary to effectuate \nthis agreement.\" The assurance also states that the \"Applicant recognizes and agrees that \nsuch Federal financial assistance will be extended in reliance on the representations and \nagreement made in this assurance\" and that the assurance is binding on the Applicant, the \nsuccessors, transferees, and assignees, and the person or persons authorized to sign the \nassurance on behalf of the Applicant. \n\n \n \nSince the terms of the assurance have not been challenged by any of the parties in this \naction and, as indicated by the Supreme Court in Lau v. Nichols, supra, 414 U.S. at 569, 94 \nS.Ct. at 789 \"[t]he Federal Government has the power to fix the terms on which its money \nallotments to the States shall be disbursed,\" the defendants are contractually bound to \npermit OCR to conduct a Title VI investigation and the scope of OCR's investigative \nauthority is not confined to investigation of the federally assisted programs or activities. \nTherefore, a pinpoint approach, which requires federal administrative action to be \nconducted on a program by program basis and which has been applied to limit the power to \nterminate federal funding, is not appropriate in this matter. \n10. Even if the pinpoint approach was applicable, it has not been applied as narrowly as \ndefendants contend. The Fifth Circuit in Board of Public Instruction of Taylor County, Florida \nv. Finch, 414 F.2d 1068 (5th Cir. 1969), recognized that a determination to terminate federal \nfunding due to discriminatory practices in a federally funded program cannot be made \nwithout consideration of its context and that a discriminatory practice in one part of an \neducational system may affect the other parts of the system. According to the court, \n\"[i]n 831*831 finding that a termination of funds under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act must be \nmade on a program by program basis, we do not mean to indicate that a program must be \nconsidered in isolation from its context.\" The court further added that the administrative \nagency seeking to terminate federal funds must make findings of fact indicating either that a \nparticular program \"is itself administered in a discriminatory manner, or is so affected by \ndiscriminatory practices elsewhere in the school system that it thereby becomes \ndiscriminatory.\" 414 F.2d at 1078-1079. \nThe court also indicated that it is important to note that the purpose of limiting the \ntermination power to \"activities which are actually discriminatory or segregated\" was not for \nthe protection of the political entity whose funds might be terminated, but for the protection \nof the innocent beneficiaries of programs or activities not tainted by discriminatory \npractices. Ibid., 414 F.2d at 1075. Thus, since the purpose of a Title VI investigation is to \nenable OCR to determine whether a recipient is in compliance with Title VI, to interpret the \nprovisions of Title VI as limiting the scope of OCR's investigative authority to investigation of \nthe federally assisted programs or activities would essentially preclude OCR from effectively \ndiscovering and determining whether the defendants herein are in compliance with Title VI \nand from protecting the beneficiaries of the federally assisted programs or activities even if \nthere was rampant discrimination elsewhere in the college and such discriminatory \npractices were affecting the federally assisted programs or activities. The distinction \nbetween the authority to investigate and the power to terminate should not be lost. \n11. Furthermore, OCR has the authority to investigate ECC's employment practices to \ndetermine whether there is discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in \nthe employment practices which affect the students at the college. Section 604 of Title VI, \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d-3, provides that administrative action is not authorized with respect to \nemployment practices except where the primary objective of the federal financial assistance \n\n \n \nis to provide employment. However, an exception to the provisions of Section 604 of Title VI \nis contained in 45 C.F.R. § 80.3(c)(3). 45 C.F.R. § 80.3(c)(3) provides: \n\"Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide \nemployment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the \nemployment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulations tends, on \nthe ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to \ndeny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which \nthis regulation applies, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the \nemployment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the \nextent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, \nbeneficiaries.\" \nThe court in United States v. Frazer, 297 F.Supp. 319, 322 (M.D.Ala.1968), stated the \nfollowing regarding Section 604 of Title VI: \n\"It is true that § 604 of Title VI makes it clear that Title VI was not intended to be applicable \nto the employment practices of recipients of Federal assistance `except where a primary \nobjective of the Federal assistance is to provide employment' or where discrimination in \nemployment causes discrimination to the beneficiaries [citation omitted]. However, the \nlanguage of § 604 of Title VI also clearly reflects that that section was not intended to \ndetract from any authority that Federal officials might have under other provisions of the \nlaw.\" \nThe court then concluded that Title VI does not preempt or limit the authority that federal \nofficials have to take affirmative action, including the filing of civil actions, designed to \nreduce or eliminate racial discrimination. \n12. Marsee's assertion that some of the information requested by OCR is confidential is \nunsubstantiated. The issue of confidentiality is addressed in 45 C.F.R. § 80.6(c) as follows: \n832*832 \"Asserted considerations of privacy or confidentiality may not operate to bar the \nDepartment from evaluating or seeking to enforce compliance with this Part. Information of \na confidential nature obtained in connection with compliance evaluation or enforcement \nshall not be disclosed except where necessary in formal enforcement proceedings or where \notherwise required by law.\" \nTherefore, the assertion of confidentiality by Marsee may not operate to bar OCR \nrepresentatives from conducting a Title VI investigation of the defendants. \n13. OCR is authorized to seek judicial enforcement of Title VI pursuant to § 602 of Title VI, \n45 C.F.R. § 80.8, and the Assurance of Compliance executed by Marsee on behalf of the \nDistrict which provides that \"the United States shall have the right to seek judicial \nenforcement of this assurance.\" \n\n \n \n14. Furthermore, the court cannot say that HEW or OCR has clearly exceeded its powers or \nauthority or acted contrary to the statute. \n15. The defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied on the ground that the \ndefendants have not shown that they are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. \n16. The injunctive and declaratory relief sought by plaintiff is granted. With respect to the \nbalancing of hardships to determine whether the court should issue the permanent \ninjunction, defendants have only made general allegations of burden. Such allegations lack \nthe requisite specificity. The court finds that without the issuance of an order in favor of the \nplaintiff, the plaintiff would be irreparably injured because the defendants would continue to \nviolate Title VI, the HEW Regulation under Title VI, and the Assurance of Compliance by \nrefusing to comply with OCR's request for data and information which is pertinent to enable \nOCR to determine whether the defendants are in compliance with Title VI. Without the \nissuance of such an order, OCR would also be prevented from investigating the allegations \nthat ECC utilized discriminatory practices and procedures against Spanish-surnamed \nstudents in employment and the delivery of educational services and hindered in its \nadministration of Title VI. Therefore, the balance is clearly in favor of the plaintiff. The \nissuance of the permanent injunction is promotive of the public good. \n ",
