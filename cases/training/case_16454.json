    "summary": "<p>On May 30, 2007, the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division (DOJ) opened an investigation of the Northwest Habilitation Center (Northwest), a state-run, residential care facility in St. Louis, Missouri that provided services to individuals with developmental disabilities. The facility housed up to 80 individuals while it was operational. The investigation appears to have been in response to two deaths at the facility: in November 2005, one resident—who required constant supervision—died after swallowing a pen; and in March 2006, another resident died from burns he suffered when a staff member placed him in a dangerously hot shower.</p><p>On August 27–29, the DOJ conducted an on-site review of the facility with expert consultants. They reviewed pertinent documents and policies, interviewed administrators and staff, and visited residents.</p><p>On August 12, 2008, the DOJ issued its findings letter and provided notice to the Governor of Missouri, alleging violations of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The DOJ reported that Northwest failed to address serious harm in a timely manner, adequately protect residents with pica, or collect reliable risk management data. While Northwest had sufficient policies in place, the DOJ found that staff failed in practice to implement proper intervention strategies in a timely manner or document incidents of injury or use of restraints. Despite the high ratio of supervising staff to residents, the DOJ found residents were still at risk of inflicting self-harm and assaulting one another. The DOJ also found that residents at the facility were subjected to treatments without adequate informed consent from residents' guardians. The report highlighted a particularly egregious example where Northwest staff had a resident's toe amputated despite objection from the resident's family and court-appointed guardian. The report concluded that the facility provided inadequate staff training, program monitoring, and data. It suggested that the facility develop and implement adequate systems and policies to ensure compliance.</p><p>In 2010, this investigation was listed as part of the DOJ's compliance with President Obama's \"Year of Community Living\" initiative—a program to improve facilities and living arrangements for individuals with developmental disabilities.</p><p>Based on a DOJ spreadsheet acquired in a Freedom of Information Act request, the DOJ did not file a complaint in response to these allegations. In 2012, the state of Missouri closed the Northwest Habilitation Center and moved residents into community-based homes and other private and state-run institutions that year. This was part of the effort to move developmentally disabled individuals into \"community settings.\" According to the DOJ's fiscal year 2012 report, the investigation subsequently closed on May 31, 2012.</p>",

      "text": "u.s. \nDepartment of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nOffice ofthe Assistant Attorney General \t Washington, D.C. 20530 \nAUG  1 2 2008 \nThe  Honorable  Matt  Blunt \nGovernor  of  Missouri \nRoom  216,  State  Capitol  Building \nJefferson  City,  MO  65101 \nRe: \t CRIPA  Investigation of  the  Northwest \n\nHabilitation Center,  St.  Louis,  Missouri \n\nDear \tGovernor  Blunt: \nI  am  writing  to  report  the  findings  of  the  Civil  Rights \nDivision'S  investigation of  conditions  and  practices  at  the \nNorthwest  Habilitation Center  (\"Northwest\"),  in St.  Louis, \nMissouri.  On  May  30,  2007,  we  notified you  of  our  intent  to \nconduct  an  investigation of  Northwest  pursuant  to  the  Civil \nRights  of  Institutionalized Persons  Act  (\"CRIPA\"),  42  U.S.C. \n§  1997.  CRIPA  gives  the  Department  of  Justice  (\"Department\") \nauthority  to  seek  remedies  for  any  pattern and  practice  of \nconduct  that  violates  the  constitutional  or  federal  statutory \nrights  of  persons  with developmental  disabilities  who  are  served \nin public  institutions .. \nOn  August  27-29,  2007,  we  conducted  an  on-site  review of \ncare  and  treatment  at  Northwest  with  expert  consultants  in \nvarious  disciplines.  Before,  during,  and  after our  site visit, \nwe  reviewed  a  wide  variety of  relevant  State  and  facility \ndocuments,  including policies  and  procedures,  as  well  as  medical \nand  other  records  relating  to  the  care  and  treatment  of  Northwest \nresidents.  During  our visit,  we  also  interviewed  Northwest \nadministrators,  professionals,  staff,  and  consultants,  and \nvisited residents  in  their residences,  at  activity areas,  and \nduring meals.  In  keeping  with  our pledge  of  transparency  and  to \nprovide  technical  assistance,  where  appropriate,  we  conveyed  our \npreliminary  findings  to  State  counsel  and  to  certain State  and \nfacility administrators  and  staff during  exit  presentations  at \nthe  close  of  our  on-site visit. \n\n- 2  ­\nAs  a  threshold matter,  we  note  that  Northwest  is  staffed \npredominately by  dedicated  individuals  who  are  genuinely \nconcerned  for  the  well-being  of  the  persons  in  their care.  We \nwould  like  to  express  our  appreciation  to  the  State  for  the \nextensive  cooperation and  assistance  provided  to  us  throughout  by \nofficials  from  the  Department  of  Mental  Health,  by  the  Northwest \nadministrators,  professionals,  and  staff,  and  by  consultants \nworking  for  the  State.  We  hope  to  continue  to work  with  the \nState  and  officials  at Northwest  in the  same  cooperative  manner \ngoing  forward. \nConsistent  with  our  statutory obligations  under  CRIPA,  I  now \nwrite  to  advise  you  formally  of  the  findings  of  our \ninvestigation,  the  facts  supporting  them,  and  the  minimum \nremedial  steps  that  are  necessary  to  remedy  the  deficiencies  set \nforth  below.  42  U.S.C.  §  1997b(a).  Specifically,  we  have \nconcluded  that  certain conditions  and  practices  at  Northwest \nviolate  the  constitutional  and  federal  statutory rights  of  its \nresidents.  In particular,  we  find  that  residents  of  Northwest \nsuffer harm  and  risk of  harm  from  the  facility's  failure  to  keep \nthem  safe  and  provide  them with  adequate  training  and  associated \nbehavioral  and  mental  health  services.  See  Youngberg  v.  Romeo, \n457  U.S.  307  (1982) i  Title XIX  of  the  Social  Security Act, \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396;  42  C.F.R.  §  483,  Subpart  I  (~Medicaid \nProgram\") . \nI  .  BACKGROUND \nNorthwest  is  a  State-owned and  State-operated  residential \nfacility  for  persons  with  developmental  disabilities,  such  as \nmental  retardation,  cerebral  palsy,  and  autism.  At  the  time  of \nour visit  in August  2007,  Northwest  housed  69  residents. \nResidents  of  Northwest  live  in numbered  on  a  small, \n~homes\" \nfenced-in  campus  in the  Overland  suburb  of  St.  Louis.. \nNorthwest  residents  possess  diverse  abilities  and  functional \nlevels.  Many  residents  require  significant  staffing supports  to \nmeet  their  daily needs,  while  others  are  much  more  independent \nand  capable  of  meeting  their own  needs.  Also,  some  of  the \nresidents  have  swallowing  disorders,  seizure  disorders, \nambulation  issues,  or other  health care  needs.  There  are  a \nnumber  of  residents  who  have  developed  challenging behaviors, \nsuch  as  self-injurious behavior  or aggression. \nAt  the  start of  our  tour  of  the  facility,  a  group  of  State \nrepresentatives  gave  a  short  presentation concerning Northwest. \nAt  that  meeting,  the  State outlined  certain remedial  measures \nthat  the  State  had  taken  at  Northwest  following  the  disturbing \n\n- 3  ­\ndeaths  of  two  residents  there  in November  2005  and  March  2006, \nrespectively.  Some  changes  to  services  at  Northwest  were  only \nbeginning  to  be  implemented  at  the  time  of  our August  2007  visit. \nIndeed,  though  a  large  amount  of  time  had  passed  since  the  deaths \nthat  prompted  the  State  to  action,  many  of  the  changes  at \nNorthwest  did  not  occur until  after the  Department  announced  its \ninvestigation of  the  facility  in May  2007.  At  the  time  of  our \nAugust  2007  visit to  Northwest,  certain consultants  and  contract \nemployees  were  present  and  taking  an  active  role  in the  planning \nand  provision of  services  to Northwest  residents.  Accordingly, \nmany  of  the  corrective  actions  at  Northwest  were  only  in their \ninfancy,  in August  2007.  Nevertheless,  we  applaud  the  State  for \nits reported  efforts  to  implement  remedial  measures. \nII.  FINDINGS \nA.  PROTECTION  FROM  HARM \nA  State must  provide  residents  of  its State-operated \ninstitutions  for  persons  with  developmental  disabilities with \nsupports  and  services  in accordance  with  the  State's  federal \nconstitutional  obligations.  See  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  316,  323; \nGreen  Y.  Baron,  879  F.2d  305,  310  (8th  Cir.  1989)  (applying \nconstitutional  standards  in the  context  of  pre-trial  detainee  in \na  mental  health  facility).  The  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that \npersons  with  developmental  disabilities who  reside  in State \ninstitutions  have  a  ~constitutionally protected  liberty interest \nin  safety.\"  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  318.  The  Court  held  that  the \nState  ~has the  unquestioned duty  to  provide  reasonable  safety for \n·all  residents\"  within  the  institution.  Id.  at  324. \nNorthwest  is  certified as  an  intermediate  care  facility  for \npersons  with mental  retardation  (~ICF/MR\")  by  the  Centers  for \nMedicaid  and  Medicare  Services  (~CMS\").  Medicare  and  Medicaid \nregulations  require  facilities  housing  and  serving  residents  with \ndevelopmental  disabilities  to protect  them  from  harm,  to  provide \nadequate  staffing,  and  to protect  them  from  abuse. \nSee,~, \n42  C. F. R.  §  483.420 (a) (5)  (requiring  that  the  facility  ~ensure \nthat  clients  are  not  subjected  to physical,  verbal,  sexual  or. \npsychological  abuse  or punishment\").  Accordingly,  the  regulatory \nprovisions  for  conditions  of  participation as  an  ICF/MR  provide \nboth  a  regulatory  threshold and  a  generally accepted professional \nstandard  for  the  conditions  of  care  that  Northwest  must  be \nmeeting. \nIn  our  judgment,  Northwest  is not  safe.  Northwest  fails  to \naddress  serious  issues  of  harm  in a  timely manner,  fails  to \n\n- 4  ­\nadequately protect  residents  with pica,l  and  fails  to  collect \nreliable  risk management  data.  Moreover,  Northwest  residents  are \nsubjected to  treatments  without  adequate  informed  consent. \n1.  Inadequate  Response  to  Serious  Issues  of  Harm \nNorthwest  fails  to  address  serious  issues  of  harm  in a \ntimely manner.  Northwest's  reviews  of  incidents  and \ninterventions  are  untimely,  ineffective,  and,  in certain cases, \nignored.  Our  expert  consultant  found  that  Northwest's  failure  to \nconduct  these  critical  reviews,  as  is  required by  Northwest's  own \npolicies,  subjects  the  residents  to  prolonged  and  repeated harm, \neither  self-inflicted or at  the  hands  of  peer  residents.  Also, \ninappropriate  delays  in developing  appropriate  intervention \nstrategies  allow  for  the  continued victimization of  residents  at \nNorthwest.  These  deficiencies  have  also  unfortunately led to  an \nover-reliance  on  restrictive  interventions  and  intensive \nsupervision as  a  means  of  protecting  residents  from  harm. \nNorthwest's  failure  to  address  serious  harm  in a  timely manner \nand  establish effective  intervention strategies  to  curb \naggressive  behavior  substantially departs  from  generally accepted \nprofessional  standards  and  continues  to place  residents  at  risk \nof  harm. \nNorthwest's  policy appropriately requires  that  its \ninterdisciplinary teams  conduct  a  causal  analysis  review when  a \nresident,  within  a  one-month period,  suffers  from  a  combination \nof  three  or more  of  any  of  the  following  categories  of  incidents: \ninjuries;  falls;  restraints;2  and/or  peer-to-peer  acts  of \n~ggression  (either as  the  aggressor  or  the  victim).  Generally \naccepted professional  standards  require  facilities,  like \nNorthwest,  to  conduct  such  reviews  and  develop  prompt  and \nappropriate  intervention strategies  to  reduce  future  harm.  In \npractice  at  Northwest,  however,  in many  instances,  the \ninterdisciplinary teams  fail  to  meet  this  requirement.  In  some \ncases,  teams  fail  to  conduct  a  causal  analysis  in  a  timely manner \nor,  in other  cases,  the  teams  do  not  meet  at. all.  For  example: \nPica  is  an  eating disorder,  which  is  characterized by \n1 \nthe  persistent  craving  and  compulsive  eating of  non-food \nsubstances. \n2  Restraint,  in this  context,  means  the  use  of  physical \nor  chemical  restraints  on  residents,  such  as  holding  a  resident's \narms  down,  using  a  mitten  to prevent  a  resident's  use  of  his  or \nher  hand,  or  injecting  a  resident  with  an  emergency  medication  to \ncalm  the  resident  down. \n\n- 5  ­\n• \t It  took  four  months  before  Northwest  conducted  a  causal \nanalysis  for  MM,3  a  resident  who  was  involved  in 21 \nreportable  incidents  of  self  harm,  aggression  toward  staff \nand  other  residents,  and  property destruction  during  those \nfour  months.  When  Northwest  finally  conducted  a  causal \nanalysis  of  his  incidents,  inexplicably the  team  only \nreviewed  three  out  of  the  21  incidents. \n• \t yy  began  self-injurious behavior  and  aggression  in March \n2007.  By  the  time  a  causal  analysis  of  YY  was  conducted  in \nJune  2007,  more  than  three months  later,  YY  had  inflicted \nthree  additional  injuries upon  herself,  suffered a  chemical \nrestraint,  and  required  a  mechanical  restraint. \n• \t In April  2007,  BB  assaulted other  residents  and  staff on  at \nleast  two  separate  occasions  and  had  to  be  restrained  for \nthreatening himself  and  others  with  a  knife  retrieved  from \nthe  kitchen.  In May  2007,  BB  expressed  suicidal  ideation on \nseveral  occasions  as  well as  continued  aggressive  behavior \nagainst  residents  and  staff.  Despite  his  behavior,  there \nwas  no  evidence  in BB's  record,  when  we  reviewed  it in \nAugust  2007,  indicating  that  his  team  conducted  a  causal \nanalysis  review of  any  of  these  incidents . \n• \t In  March  2007,  UU  was  involved  in  three  incidents,  including \nself  harm,  bruising  speculated  to  be  caused by an  improper \ntransfer,  and  an  incident  in which  she  was  struck by  a \nfellow  resident  several  times.  Despite  these  incidents, \nthere  was  no  evidence  in UU's  record,  during  our  review \nthree  months  later,  indicating  that  her  team  conducted  a \ncausal  analysis  review  of  these  incidents . \n• \t DD's  aggression  increased between  March  and  July 2007,  when \nhe  assaulted  fellow  residents  at  least  six times  during  this \nperiod.  However,  it took Northwest  four  months  before  it \nconducted  a  causal  analysis  review  of  this  resident,  during \nwhich  time  DD  continued  to  cause  harm  to  himself  and  other \nresidents  at  Northwest. \nGenerally  accepted professional  standards  also  require \ninterdisciplinary teams  to  conduct  ongoing  evaluations  of  the \n3  To  protect  the  privacy  of  residents  at Northwest,  the \ninitials  referenced  in the  examples  are  fictitious.  We  will \nprovide  a  list of  actual  names  to  the  State  under  a  separate \ncover. \n\n- 6  ­\nappropriateness  and  eff.icacy of  current  interventions  and  modify \nor  revise  strategies  that  do  not  appear  to  be  working.  Our \ncomprehensive  review  of  incident  reports  revealed  that Northwest \ndoes  not  adequately modify  or  review  interventions  that  do  not \nappear  to  be  working.  Below,  we  highlight  examples  where \nNorthwest  failed  to  modify  interventions  to protect  victims  from \ncontinued harm  from  aggression  by other  residents: \n• \t MM  was  assaulted on  nine  separate  occasions  by  three \n\ndifferent  residents  between March  and  July  2007. \n\n• \t A  resident  was  assaulted on  five  separate  occasions  by \nfour  different  residents  between  the  end  of April  and  the \nbeginning  of  June  2007. \n• \t Between  March  and  July  2007,  BD  was  assaulted  on  four \n\nseparate  occasions  by  the  same  resident. \n\nNorthwest's  intervention  strategies  to  reduce  resident \naggression  and violence  are  woefully deficient.  Not  only  has \nNorthwest  failed  to  protect  residents  from  victimization, \nNorthwest's  attempts  to  curb  aggressive  behavior  are  insufficient \nto  protect  peers  from  harm.  For  example,  AZ,  a  resident  on  1:1 \nsupervision,4  assaulted fellow  residents  on  16  separate  occasions \nbetween March  and  July  2007.  Other  than Northwest/s  unsuccessful \nefforts  to  thwart  AZ's  aggression with  constant  supervision, \nNorthwest  provided  no  other  appropriate  interventions. \nIn  the  absence  of  effective  risk management  practices., \nNorthwest  employs  undue  restraints  and  intensive  supervision  in \nan  effort  to  protect  residents  from  harm.  Northwest/s \nover-reliance  on  restrictive  interventions  places  the  residents \nat  continued  risk of  harm  because  Northwest  is  not  addressing  the \nmore  critical  concerns  facing  the  resident  such  as  aggressive \nI \nbehavior  or  self harm. \nNorthwest's  over-dependence  on  mechanical  restraints \nsubstantially departs  from  generally accepted professional \nstandards.  In  sharp  contrast  to generally accepted professional \nstandards,  which  strive  for  restraint  reduction  and  elimination \nin  facilities  such  as  Northwest,  Northwest's  use  of  restraints \n4  One-to-one  supervision  is an  intensive  supervision, \ndetermined  to  be  necessary by  a  qualified behavioral  or medical \nprofessional,  whereby  one  staff member  is assigned  to  an \nindividual  resident  and  is charged  only with  the  responsibility \nof  supervising  that  resident. \n\n- 7  ­\nfrom  June  2006  through  July  2007  rose  more  than  500  percent. \nThese  shockingly high  numbers  do  not  even  include  some  of  the \nmechanical  restraints  employed  at  Northwest,  such  as  the  use  of \ngloves,  mittens,  and  seat  belts  used  in  recliners  or wheelchairs. \nAs  discussed  later herein,  Northwest  also  fails  to  adequately \ndocument  restraint  justification and  use. \nSimilarly,  Northwest  has  an  extraordinarily high  number  of \n\nresidents  on  intensive  supervision,  again used  as  a  means  of \n\nprotecting  residents  from  harm.  Nearly  one-third  of  the  69 \n\nresidents  are  assigned  1:1  supervision.  Despite  this  intensive \n\nsupervision,  where  a  staff person's  only responsibility is  to \n\ncontinually supervise  one  particular resident,  residents  are \n\nstill at  risk of  harm.s  For  example: \n\n• \t YY,  a  resident  on  1:1  supervision,  ingested  spray  from  an \naerosol  can. \n• \t As  discussed  above,  AZ,  a  resident  on  1:1  supervision, \nassaulted  fellow  residents  on  16  separate  occasions. \n• \t As  mentioned  earlier,  MM,  a  resident  on  1: 1  supervision, \nwas  involved  in  21  individual  incidents  of  self harm, \naggression  toward  staff  and  other  r.esidents,  and  property \ndestruction. \n• \t CC,  a  resident  on  1:1  supervision,  was  reportedly choked \nby  a  staff member. \nThese  examples  demonstrate  that  even  when  a  resident  is  on \nintensive  supervision,  Northwest  fails  to protect  them  from  harm. \n. Given  the  high  number  of  residents  on  1:1  supervision,  and  the \napparent  ineffectiveness  of  the  supervision,  Northwest  should \nNorthwest's  over-reliance  on  intensive  supervision \nS \nappears  to  be  causing  staffing  concerns.  While  we  were  on  site, \nseveral  staff members  raised  concerns  regarding  overtime  and  the \nneed  for  additional  sta'ff.  Given  the  repeated  concerns  raised by \nstaff,  we  encourage  Northwest  to  keep  staffing  at  appropriate \nlevels  and  to minimize  the  use  of  overtime.  Staff  who  frequently \nwork  overtime  can grow  tired and  impatient,  which  can  lead to \nlapses  in adequate  supervision.  In  order  to  maintain  a \nreasonably  safe  environment  for  residents,  federal  regulations \nand  generally accepted professional  standards  dictate  that \nfacilities  must  adequately  supervise  their residents.  See \n42  C.F.R.  §  483.430(d) (1)  (requiring  facilities  to  provide \nsufficient  direct  care  staff  to manage  and  supervise  residents) . \n\n- 8  ­\nreevaluate  the  interventions  it provides  to protect  residents \nfrom  harm. \nFinally,  Northwest  indicated  to  us  that  it is  committed  to \nidentifying  environmental  hazards  that  place  residents  at  risk of \nharm  and  correcting  those  conditions.  However,  Northwest's \ndelayed  response  time  to  hazardous  conditions  places  residents  at \nrisk of  harm.  For  example,  there  were  numerous  injuries  suffered \nby  contact  with  a  \"burlap-type\"  wallpaper  that  lined  the  walls  of \nthe  living  area  and  resulted  in abrasions,  skin  tears,  and  other \ninjuries.  Although Northwest  was  aware  of  the  injuries  and  had \nengaged  in extensive  discussions  to  correct  the  problem,  no \naction was  taken  for  more  than  six months.  Even  then,  Northwest \ndid  not  remedy  the  hazard.  Instead,  in  response  to  some  of  the \ninjuries,  Northwest  placed  restrictive mitts  on  some  of  the \nresidents  so  that  they would  not  injure  themselves  while  grasping \nthe  wall  for  support.  In  such  cases,  Northwest  is  improperly \nrelying  on  restrictive  interventions,  rather  than  simply  fixing \nthe  environmental  hazard.  . \n2.  Inadequate  Protection  for  Residents  with  Pica \nAt  the  commencement  of  our  site  investigation,  Northwest \nrepresented  to  us  that  it had  developed  and  implemented  a  policy \nand  program  for  supporting people  who  have  pica.  Despite  the \nreported establishment  of  this  program,  we  found  serious \ndeficiencies  in the  protection of  residents  with pica.  Below  we \nhighlight  a  few  examples  of  neglect  that  demonstrate,  in part, \nthe  facility's  failure  to  protect  its residents  from  harm  from \npica: \n• \t As  mentioned  earlier,  YY,  who  has  a  history of  pica  and \nreceives  1:1  supervision,  reportedly  ingested  spray  from \nan  unattended  aerosol  can. \n• \t In  the  home  of  a  resident  with  a  history of  ingesting \nfeces,  our  expert  observed  stool  floating  in  the  commode \nof  the  vacant  bathroom. \n• \t In  a  home  that  housed  several  residents  at  risk for  pica, \nour  expert  observed  the  doors  of  a  floor-level  cabinet \nleft  open  and  unattended.  The  cabinet  contained various \nitems  posing  pica  and  choking  risks,  including pens, \nplastics,  beads,  and  aerosol  cans.  It was  in  this very \nhome  that  YY  had  earlier  ingested  spray  from  an \nunattended  aerosol  can. \n\n- 9  ­\n3.  Inadequate  and  Unreliable  Data \nIn  every  record  we  reviewed,  our  expert  consultant  found \nsignificant  deviations  from  generally accepted  professional \nstandards.  8uch  deviations  include  outdated  assessments  and \nsupport  plans;  expired  and/or  absent  guardian  consents  for \nrestrictive  and/or  intrusive behavioral  and  medical \ninterventions;  and  inaccurate  clinical  information.  These \nserious  deficiencies  place  residents  at  significant  risks  of  harm \nbecause  staff  run  the  risk of  making  critical  decisions  based  on \nerroneous  data. \nData  integrity and  reliability are  extremely  important  in \nidentifying,  tracking,  and  adequately  addressing  systemic  trends \naffecting  an  individual  resident  or  the  facility as  a  whole.  Our \ndocument  and  record  reviews  indicate  that  Northwest's  data \nreliability is dubious~  at  best,  suggesting  that  executive-level \ndecision makers  do  not  have  a  firm-grasp  on  the  actual  number  of \nincidents,  injuries,  and  use  of  restraints  in  the  facility. \nBelow  we  highlight  a  few  examples  illustrating  the  lack of \nconsistently reliable  data  related to  resident  safety: \n•  As  mentioned  earlier,  CC  reported  being  choked  by  a  staff \nmember  on  June  17,  2007.  This  is  a  reportable  incident. \nHowever,  there  is  no  evidence  that  an  incident  report  was \ncompleted,  nor  that  an  investigation was  even  initiated \ninto  the  alleged abuse. \n•  On  July  9,  2007,  staff noted  a  purplish bruise  to  the \nleft  side  of  88's groin  area  and,  while  it was  documented \nthat  a  nurse  was  notified,  an  incident  report  was  not \ncompleted. \n•  88  tripped over  another  resident's  leg on  July  9,  2007, \nsustaining an  abrasion  to  his  right  palm.  Neither  the \nfall,  nor  the  injury,  was  documented  in an  incident \nreport. \n• \t On  July  11,  2007,  a  bruise  was  found  on  88's  right  arm, \nand  again,  there  is no  evidence  that  an  incident  report \nwas  completed. \n• \t On  July 11,  2007,  one  staff member  documented  that  88 \nfell  on  top  of  another  staff member,  while  another \nemployee  made  an  entry  indicating  that  88  stumbled  over  a \nwheelchair. \n\n- 10  ­\nNorthwest  also  fails  to  adequately  document  the  use  of \nmechanical  restraints,  thus  making  it difficult  for  Northwest  to \neffectively gauge  its use  of  mechanical  restraints.  For  example, \nincident  reports  captured  the  use  of  a  restraint  on  one  resident, \nwho  wore  restraint mitts  for  16  hours  a  day,  but  failed  to \ncapture  the  use  of  a  seatbelt  on  another  resident.  Northwest's \ninconsistency  in  reporting  its use  of  mechanical  restraints  is \nparticularly troubling  given Northwest's  increasing  reliance  on \nrestraints,  as  discussed  earlier. \nNorthwest  also  fails  to  adequately document  the \njustification for  the  use  of  the  restraint.  For  example,  in the \ncase  of AA,  a  wheelchair-bound  resident  with whom  Northwest \nemploys  the  use  of  a  seatbelt,  there  is no  evidence  to  indicate \nthat  less  restrictive  interventions  were  tried and  found \nunsuccessful,  and  no  documentation  indicating  that  the \ninterdisciplinary team  re-evaluates  the  restraint  use. on  a \nmonthly  basis. \n4.  Failure  to  Obtain  Guardian  Consents \nA  disturbing  trend  identified during  our  review  of  resident \nfiles  was  Northwest's  rejection of,  and/or  failure  to  obtain, \nguardian  consent  for  restrictive  and/or  intrusiv~ behavioral  and \nmedical  interventions.  In  several  instances,  the  wishes  of  the \nresident's guardian  have  either been  ignored or not  requested. \nFailing  to  seek  the  informed  consent  of  a  resident's  guardian  is \na  substantial  departure  from  generally  accepted  professional \nstandards.  Below  we  highlight  a  particularly egregious  example \nwhere  Northwest  failed  to  comply  with  the  informed  consent  of  the \nresident's guardian: \n• \t Northwest  staff had AA's  toe  amputated  despite  the \ncontinued objection by AA's  parent  and  court-appointed \nguardian.  AA  had  been  receiving  treatment  for  his  toe \nsince  2001  for  injuries  resulting  from  his  crawling  on \nthe  floor  and  jumping 'from his  wheelchair.  In 2005,  a \npodiatrist  noted  that  AA  had  chronic  toe  dislocation and \nsuggested  to AA's  mother  that  his  toe  be  amputated.  AA's \nmother  refused,  and  his  court-appointed guardian  agreed. \nA  more  conservative  line  of  treatment  was 'followed  to \ncare  for  AA's  toe.  A  year  had  gone  by  without  a \ncomplication;  however,  in May  2007,  AA's  toe  began  to \ncause  problems,  including blistering and  drainage. \nAgain,  toe  amputation was  suggested,  and  Northwest, . \nwithout  the  consent  of  AA's  mother  or guardian,  proceeded \nwith  the  amputation.  AA's  mother  first  learned of  the \ntoe  amputation  when.visiting  her  son,  a  week  after the \n\n- 11  ­\nsurgery was  performed.  There  is no  evidence  in AA's \nrecords  indicating  that  the  guardian  or mother  consented \nto  the  amputation.  Northwest's  conscious  disregard  for \nthe  wishes  of AA's  mother,  despite  previous  knowledge  of \nher  disagreement  with  the  proposed  surgery,  and \nNorthwest's  failure  to  obtain  informed  consent  from  AA's \ncourt-appointed guardian are  gross  deviations  from \ngenerally accepted professional  standards. \nB.  BEHAVIORAL  SUPPORT  PLANNING \nPersons  with  developmental  disabilities  residing  in  state \ninstitutions  have  a  constitutional  right  to  \"minimally  adequate \ntraining.  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  322.  Specifically,  \"the \n116 \nminimally  adequate  training  required by  the  Constitution  is such \ntraining  as  may  be  reasonable  in  light  of  [the  institutionalized \nperson's]  liberty interests  in safety and  freedom  from \nunreasonable  restraints.\"  Id.  at  319.  An  essential  component  of \nhabilitative  training  for  persons  with  developmental  disabilities \nis  the  regular  provision of  activities designed  to .help  them \ndevelop  new  skills  and  practice  skills already  learned.  See \n42  C.F.R.  §  483.420(6)  (requiring  that  facilities  \"ensure  that \nclients  are  provided  active  treatment  to  reduce  dependency  on \ndrugs  and  physical  restraints\") . \nNorthwest  fails  to provide  training programs  that  are \nadequate  and  appropriate  to meet  the  needs  of  Northwest \nresidents.  Northwest  also  fails  to  offer adequate  behavioral \nsupports  to  its residents  who  require  plans  for  behavior \nproblems.  Our  expert  consultant  found  that  Northwest's  treatment \nof  behavioral  disorders  falls  substantially below  generally \naccepted professional  standards.  Specifically,  Northwest's \ninadequate  programming  has  likely led to  the  increased use  of  1:1 \nsupervision and  more  frequent  hospitalizations  for  some \nresidents.  We  set  forth  below  our  findings  in greater detail. \n1.  Inadequate  Behavioral  Supports \nA  majority  of  Northwest's  residents  have  a  history of \nexhibiting  challenging behaviors,  such  as  aggression, \nself-injury,  and  destruction of  property.  To  address  these \nThe  Supreme  Court  in Youngberg  recognized  that  care  and \n6 \nservices  for  persons  with  developmental  disabilities  in state-run \ninstitutions would  be  provided by  professionals  in various \ndisciplines,  including medicine,  nursing,  psychology,  and \nphysical  therapy.  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at '323  n.30. \n\n- 12  ­\nbehaviors,  approximately  49  of  Northwest's  69  residents  receive \ntraining  and  associated psychologioal  and  behavioral  services \nthrough  a  formal  behavior  support  plan.  When  we  toured  in August \n2007,  Northwest  had  developed  new  standards  to  write  these  plans, \nbut  had  not  yet  revised most  of  the  existing plans  using  the  new \nstandards.  Most  of  the  behavioral  support  plans  in place  in \nAugust  2007  had  been written by  Northwest's  previous \npsychologist.  Our  expert  consultant  found,  and  Northwest's \ncurrent  staff acknowledged,  that  these  older plans  were \ninadequate.  The  outmoded  plans  substantially depart  from \ngenerallY'acceptable  professional  standards. \nIn  the  absence  of  adequate  behavioral  support  plans,  a \nnumber  of  problem behaviors  that  lead  to  poor  outcomes  for \nNorthwest  residents  continue,  and  in  some  cases,  increase  over \ntime.  For  example: \n• \t Resident  DD's  aggression,  mentioned  earlier,  increased \nbetween March  and  July  2007,  as  he  assaulted  a  peer  at \nleast  once  in March,  May,  and  June,  and  then  attacked a \npeer  four  times  in July  2007. \n• \t Resident  AZ,  mentioned  earlier,  assaulted  her  peers  on  16 \noccasions  between March  and  July  2007. \n• \t As  mentioned  earlier,  in April  2007,  Resident  BB  twice \nassaulted  staff  and  residents,  and  threatened  himself  and \nothers  with  a  knife.  In May  2007,  BB  again had  multiple \nincidents  of  aggression  toward  staff and  residents. \nWe  recognize  that  many  changes  to  behavioral  services  at \nNorthwest  were  contemplated or had  just begun  at  the  time  of  our \nvisit.  Our  expert  consultant  found  that  the  behavior  support \nplans  that  Northwest  had  revised under  its new  standards  were \ngenerally adequate.  Northwest  provided us  four  such plans  that \nhad  been  comprehensively  re-written.  These  plans  contained most \nof  the  components  of  an  adequate  behavior  ~upport plan. 7 \nNorthwest's  four  newer  plans  included  clear definitions \n7 \nof  the  problem behaviors  written  in observable  terms;  a \nfunctional  analysis  that  provided useful  information; \ninstructions  for  teaching  alternative  replacement  behaviors; \nplans  to  create  an  engaging  and  stimulating  environment; \nconsideration of  medical  and  medication  factors;  definition of \nspecific  responses  to  the  behavior when  it occurs;  a  data \ncollection  system;  and  a  schedule  for  the  regular  review of  the \nplan. \n\n- 13  ­\nHowever,  even  Northwest's  newly-revised plans  did not  meet \ngenerally accepted  professional  standards  with  respect  to  the  use \nof  reinforcers. 8  The  newer  plans  contained  some  use  of  positive \nreinforcement,  but  failed  to  specify how  staff  should provide \nresidents  with  reinforcers  in a  manner  that  is  dependent  on  the \nresidents'  behavior.  Not  surprisingly,  then,  during  our  three \ndays  of  observation  at  Northwest,  our  expert  consultant 'did not \nobserve  any  instances  of  staff using  structured,  positive \nreinforcement,  which  is  required  by  generally accepted \nprofessional  standards.  For  example: \n• \t The  plan  for  VV  appropriately  included  structured, \npositive  reinforcement.  However,  VV's  1:1  staff member \nwas  not  aware  of  any  reinforcement  system  for  him. \n• \t Another  resident  was  observed with  his  1:1  staff member. \nThe  staff member  was  not  aware  of  any  reward  or \nreinforcement  program  for  the  resident.  Our  expert \nconsultant  found  that  a  resident  with  a  behavior  that \nrequired  this  intensive  staffing  level  should  have  a \nreinforcement  plan. \n2. \t Poor  Program  Implementation,  Monitoring,  and \nFollow Up \nBehavior  programs  must  be  consistently and  correctly \nimplemented  for  residents  to make  progress.  Of  course,  as  we \nhave  already discussed,  Northwest's  outmoded  behavior  support \nplans  are  deficient.  Even  with  its revised plans,  however, \nNorthwest  substantially departs  from  generally  accepted \nprofessional  standards  due  to poor  implementation  of  behavioral \nplans.  Implementation  of  plans  is  inadequate  due  to poor  staff \ntraining  and  poor  behavioral  data management.  As  a  result  of \nthese  deficiencies,  Northwest  residents  are  at  continued  risk of \nharm. \n(a) \t Poor  Staff  Training \nFacilities  that  participate  in Medicaid,  like Northwest, \nnmust  provide  each  employee  with  initial  and  continuing  training \nthat  enables  the  employee  to  perform his  or her  duties \neffectively,  efficiently,  and  competently.\"  42  C.F.R. \n§  483.430(e).  Moreover,  the  staff  at  such  facilities  nmust  be \nReinforcers  are  items  used  to  motivate  good  behaviors, \n\n8 \nsuch  as  extra  snacks  for  those  individuals  whose  dietary plans \n\nallow  for  extra  food. \n\n\n- 14  ­\nable  to  demonstrate  the  skills and  techniques  necessary  to \nimplement  the  individual  program plans  for  each  client  for  whom \nthey  are  responsible.\"  42  C.F.R.  §  483.430(e). \nBehavior programs  at  Northwest  involve  mUltiple  distinct \nsteps  or  procedures.  Such  complexity  requires  that  staff \ndemonstrate  competency  in order  to make  implementation  efforts \nmeaningful  and  effective  for  the  residents.  The  State  asserted \nin its  initial presentation to  us  that  it had  instituted a \ncompetency-based  training9  program  for  130  staff members.  Our \non-site  observations  and  interviews  with direct  care  staff  and \nother  staff who  were  responsible  for  implementing  the  written \nbehavior  programs  revealed  insufficient  staff  training.  For \nexample,  staff  assigned  to  a  resident  with  a  feeding  tube \nreported  to  our  expert  consultant  that  he  was  given  conflicting \ninstructions  on  the  use  of  mitts  to  cover  the  resident's  hands. \nSome  nurses,  the  staff member  reported,  told  him  to use  the  mitts \non  the  resident  when  the  resident  was  agitated,  whereas  other \nnurses  told him  to  use  the  mitts  all  the  time.  This \ninconsistency demonstrates  a  need  for  further  training. \n(b)  Poor  Behavioral  Data  Management \nData  collection  sheets  were  appropriately  available  and \non-site,  but  there  was  disparity  in how  some  staff  recorded \nbehavioral  data.  In one  living area,  for  example,  in \ncontravention of  generally accepted  professional  standards,  for \nsome  residents,  behavioral  data  was  not  contemporaneously \nrecorded  when  behaviors  occurred.  Staff  told our  expert, \nconsultant  that  staff  fill  out  the  data  collection  sheets  at  the \nend  of  the  shift.  This  is problematic  because  it affects  the \naccuracy  of  the  data.  Data  recorded  far  after  the  occurrence  of \nthe  events  to  be  tracked will  not  be  as  accurate  as  data  recorded \ncontemporaneously.  In  that  same  living area,  another  resident's \nbehaviors  were  being  appropriately  recorded  at  the  time  they \noccurred.  Accordingly,  Northwest  can  collect  data  in a  more \nreliable,  contemporaneous  fashion,  but  does  not  do  so  for  some \nresidents. \nFurther,  there  were  no  checks  on  the  reliability of  the  data \ncollected;  that  is,  there  were  no  instances  of  a  second person \nsimultaneously and  independently  recording  the  data. \nAccordingly,  Northwest's  management  of  behavioral  data  for  the \nCompetency-based  training  is  teaching  that  requires  the \n9 \ntrainee  to  demonstrate  his  or her  acquisition of  the  skill(s) \ntaught. \n\n- 15  ­\nimplementation  of  behavior  programs  substantially departs  from \ngenerally accepted professional  standards. \n3.  Inadequate  Skills Training \nResidents  of  Northwest  have  a  constitutionally protected \nliberty  interest  that  requires  the  State  to provide  minimally \nadequate  or reasonable  training to  ensure  safety and  freedom  from \nundue  restraint.  See  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  319.  As  an  ICF/MR, \nNorthwest  is obligated to  provide  its residents  with  a  continuous \nprogram  of  active  treatment,  which  includes,  among  other  things, \nthe  aggressive  and  consistent  implementation  of  training  that  is \ndirected  toward  the  acquisition of  behavior  necessary  for  the \nresidents  to  function  with  as  much  self determination  and \nindependence  as  possible.  See  42  C.F.R.  §  483.440(a) (1).  Thus, \nin addition  to  the  required behavior plans  for  those  residents \nwith behavior  challenges,  Northwest  must  provide  adequate  skill \ntraining  for  all  residents  to provide  them  with  their maximum \npossible  level  of  independence.  Teaching  plans  set  the  occasion \nfor  positive  interactions  between  staff and  residents. \nInstruction provides  engaging  opportunities  for  residents.  And, \nnew  skills  can  provide  alternatives  to problem behaviors. \nNorthwest  substantially departs  from  generally accepted \nprofessional  standards  in  the  development,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring  of  skill  training  for  residents.  Our  expert \nconsultant  read many  of  Northwest's  instructional  plans,  observed \nimplementation  of  many  of  the  training objectives,  and  discussed \ntraining objectives  with Northwest's  staff.  The  training \nobjectives  are  inadequate  in both  their design  and \nimplementation. \n(a)  Inadequate  Training  Objectives \nNorthwest's  Habilitation Specialists write  training \nobjectives  based  on  some  of  each  individual's  identified skills \ndeficits.  However,  the  training objectives  are  not  written  in \naccordance  with  generally accepted professional  standards. \nTraining  objectives  should  include  the  specific  instruction,  what \nto  do  if performance  is correct  (reinforcement),  what  to  do  if \nperformance  is  incorrect  (prompt  and  practice),  how  to  collect \ndata,  and  the  criterion to. move  onto  the  next  level  or phase  of \nthe  plan.  These  elements  are  absent  in Northwest's  training \nobjectives. \nAdditionally,  the  training objectives  should  require  that \nNorthwest  teach  a  wider  range  and  larger number  of  skills  for \neach  resident.  For  example,  we  observed  staff working  with  a \n\n- 16  ­\nresident  on  a  training program  focused  on  a  narrow  skill  with \nsuch  infrequent  practice  that  the  plan  failed  to  lead  to \nlearning.  Resident  BA  had  a  training program  to hold  an  item  for \n15  seconds.  BA  turned  his  body  away  indicating he  did  not  want \nto  hold  an  item.  The  written plan  said to  get  him  to  hold  an \nitem and  then  to  give  it back  to  the  staff 'member,  then  give  him \npraise  and  some  back  rubs.  The  plan  required  four  trials per \nmonth.  It was  unclear  how  BA  will  learn anything  with  this plan. \nIt does  not  make  sense  to  teach BA  to hold  an  item and  then give \nit to  staff.  Furthermore,  practicing  this  skill only  four  times \na  month  will  not  likely lead  to  any  learning.  Finally,  'every \nindividual  at  Northwest  has  many  identified skills  deficits. \nFocusing  on  one  particular skill deficit,  such  as  BA's  need  to \nhold  items,  is  far  too  narrow  for  BA  to  acquire  behavior \nnecessary  to  function with  as  much  self determination  and \nindependence  as  possible. \n(b) \t Inadequate  Implementation  of Training \nObjectives \nWe  observed  serious  errors  in  the  implementation  of  training \nobjectives.  Consider  the  following  illustrative examples: \n• \t Resident  BC  had  an  objective  that  read:  Q[BC]  will \nfollow  staff  instruction to participate  in an  appointed \nactivity.\"  The  staff member  gave  BC  a  magazine,  then \nmusic  bells,  and  then  cowbells.  The  plan  said to  give \nthe  instruction and  then prompt,  role  play,  and  praise. \nThe'  staff member  did  not  give  any  instructions  at  all, \nnor  did  the  staff member  prompt,  role  play,  or give \npraise.  The  staff member  did,  however,  score  BC  with  a \nplus  (+)  because  he  turned  the  pages  and  looked  at  the \nmagazine.  BC  did  not  do  anything  with  the  music  bells  or \nthe  cow  bells.  It  is unclear  how  BC  is  learning  anything \nwith  this  plan. \n• \t A  staff member  had  a  resident  write  his  first  and  last \nnames  and  the  year  2007.  He  did  so  and  she  praised him. \nThe  resident's  written plan  called for  having  him  copy \nthree-Ie~ter words.  The  staff member  was  not \nimplementing  the  plan.  She  did  not  write  three  letters \nwords,  and  the  resident  did not  copy  them. \n• \t Resident  VV,  mentioned  earlier,  had  a  training objective \nto  present  him  with  two  tasks  and  he  was  to  choose  and  do \none.  The  staff member  implemented  the  plan as  if  it \ncalled for  VV  to  complete  (rather  than  choose)  two \n(rather  than  one)  tasks.  Further,  when  our expert \n\n- 17  ­\nconsultant  asked  the  staff member  about  VV's  token  system \nand  reinforcement  board  for  this  training  objective,  as \nrequired  by  the  training  program,  the  staff member  said \nhe  had  never  heard  of  them. \n4.  Inadequate  Communications  Services \nAs  mentioned,  Northwest  residents  have  a' constitutionally \nprotected  liberty interest  in minimally  adequate  or  reasonable \ntraining to  ensure  safety and  freedom  from  undue  restraint. \nYoungberg,  supra,  457  U.S.  at  319.  An  essential  component  of \nhabilitative  treatment  for  persons  with  developmental \ndisabilities  is active  treatment,  which  is  the  regular provision \nof  activities  designed  to  help  develop  new  skills  and  practice \nskills already  learned.  42  C.F.R.  §  483.440(a).  Federal \nregulations  for  active  treatment  also  require  that  residents  who \nlack communicative  skills be  trained  in  these  skills.  42  C.F.R. \n§  483.440(c) (6).  Northwest  substantially departs  from  these \nregulatory  requirements  and  from  generally accepted professional \nstandards. \nMany  of  Northwest's  residents  have  severe  language  disorders \nand,  therefore,  communication  training  is essential  to  their \nhabilitative programming.  According  to Northwest's \ncommunications  staff and  records,  44  residents  were  supposed  to \nbe  using  communication  cards;  voice  output  devices  were  available \nfor  six other  residents;  and  augmentative  and  alternative \ncommunication  (\"AAC\")  devices  had  reportedly been  developed  for \nanother  19  residents.  In  addition,  Northwest  had  reportedly \n, developed  language-related  service plans  and  training objectives, \nand/or were  using  picture  communication  systems,  switch programs, \ncommunication  books,  or  sign  language  for  a  number  of  residents. \nGiven  the  breadth  and  number  of  materials  reportedly  developed \nfor  residents  according  to  communications  staff's  reports  and \nrecords,  our  expert  consultant  expected  to  observe  communications \ndevises  and  systems  in prevalent  use  at  Northwest.  To  the \ncontrary,  however,  Northwest's  use  of  communications  systems  and \ndevises  fell  far  below  generally accepted professional  standards. \nHere  are 'some  examples  of  our  observations: \n•  One  resident  was  supposed  to  communicate  using  a  picture \ncommunication  book.  When  we  asked  for  it,  the  staff \nmember  looked  for  it behind  some  chairs,  on  a  shelf,  and \nin a  closet,  but  could not  find  it.  She  said  that  it \nused  to  be  on  the  back  of  the  resident's  wheelchair.  She \nthought  that  maybe  an  occupational  therapist  or  a \nphysical  therapist  had  taken  it a  few  days  ago.  It  is \n\n- 18  ­\nunclear  how  long  this  resident  had  been  without  this \ncritical  communication  device. \n• \t Another  resident  also uses  a  picture  book  to  communicate. \nThe  staff member  explained  the  resident's  book  to  our \nexpert  consultant.  The  book,  however,  was  not  a  book  for \nthe  resident  to  use  to  communicate.  It was  a  book  of \nphotos  about  things  in the  resident's  life  (such  as  rooms \nat  Northwest,  staff,  and  his  sister)  rather  than \nsomething  the  resident  would  use  to  communicate.  While \nthis book  is good  for  other purposes,  it is not  a \ncommunication  device. \n• \t When  our  expert  consultant  asked  staff  about  another \n\nresident's  communication  system,  staff  showed  us  a \n\npicture book  that  was  about  getting to  know  that \n\nresident.  Again,  while  this  type  of  book  is  good  for \n\nother purposes,  it is not  a  communication  system. \n\n• \t When  our  expert  consultant  asked  about  another  resident's \ncommunication  device,  he  was  told that  the  device  was  \"in \nthe  shop.\" \n5;  Inadequate  Human  Rights  Protection \nA  Human  Rights  Committee  (\"HRC\")  performs  an  important \nfunction  at  a  facility  for  persons  with  developmental \ndisabilities.  HRCs  provide  a  general  review  of  the  impact  of \ntreatment  programs  upon  the  rights  of  the  individual  residents. \nThe  HRC  upholds  general  societal  standards  and  ensures  that  the \nfacility  follows  regulatory requirements.  Northwest  had  a  newly \nformed  HRCi  however,  its membership  was  comprised  primarily of \nNorthwest's  own  staff.  Professional  standards  require  that  the \nHRC  should  be  comprised  solely of  members  who  are  not  employees \nof  the  facility.  This  avoids  conflict  of  interest  concerns.  The \nrole  of  Northwest  staff  should be  limited to  the  presentation of \neach  case  to  the  HRC  members  and  the  coordination of  the  HRC \nmeetings. \nIII.  MINIMAL  REMEDIAL  MEASURES \nTo  remedy  the  identified deficiencies  and  protect  the \nconstitutional  and  statutory rights  of  Northwest  residents,  the \nState  of  Missouri  should  implement  promptly,  at  a  minimum,  the \nremedial  measures  set  forth  below: \n\n- 19  ­\nA. \t Protection  from  Harm \n1. \t Ensure  that  residents  are  kept  reasonably  safe  and \nprotected  from  harm  and  risk of  harm.  More \nspecifically,  Northwest  should: \na. \t Develop  and  implement  an  adequate  risk \nmanagement  system,  including  an  adequate \nincident  management  plan  to  substantially \nreduce  the  number  of  overall  incidents \noccurring  at  Northwest,  particularly the \nnumber  of  incidents  due  to  resident \naggression,  self harm,  and  unknown  causes; \nb. \t Develop  and  implement  adequate  policies  and \nprocedures  to  ensure  that  residents  are \nadequately protected  from  neglect.  Impose \nappropriate  discipline  and/or  corrective \nmeasures  with  respect  to  staff  involved  in \nsubstantiated cases  of  neglect  including \nstaff who  fail  to  carry out  their \nresponsibilities  while  providing  enhanced \nsupervision; \nc. \t Ensure  that  incidents  involving  injury and \nunusual  incidents  are  tracked  and  analyzed, \nin  a  timely manner,  to  identify root  causes; \nand \nd. \t Ensure  that  assessments  are  conducted  to \ndetermine  whether  or  not  root  causes  have \nbeen  addressed  and,  if not,  ensure  that \nappropriate  feedback  is provided  to  the \nresponsible  disciplines  and  direct-care \nareas. \n2. \t Develop  and  implement  an  adequate  system  for \nidentifying  residents  at  high  risk  of  being \ninjured or  causing  injuries  to  others,  and  those \nresidents  who  are  aggressive.  Develop  and \nimplement  plans  to  address  the  high  risk \nsituations. \n3. \t Ensure  that  any  device  or procedure  that \nrestricts,  limits,  or  directs  a  person's  freedom \nof  movement  (including,  but  not  limited to, \nmechanical  restraints,  physical/manual  restraints, \n\n- 20 \t ­\nor  intensive  supervision)  is  permissible  only  as  a \nlast  resort.  More  specifically,  Northwest  should: \na. \t Develop  and  implement  a  policy on  restraints \nand  restrictive measures  that  comports  with \ngenerally accepted professional  standards; \nb. \t For  those  residents  subjected  to  chronic  use \nof  restraint  associated with difficult \nbehavior  problems,  obtain outside  expertise, \nif necessary,  to  help  Northwest  address  the \nresidents'  behavior  problems  in an  attempt  to \nreduce  both  the  behaviors  and  the  use  of \nrestraint;  and \nc. \t Ensure  that  highly  restrictive  interventions \nor  restraints  are  never  used  as  punishment, \nin  lieu of  training programs,  or  for  the \nconvenience  of  staff. \n4. \t Develop  and  implement  adequate  active  treatment \nprograms  for  all  residents  engaging  in pica \nbehavior. \n5. \t Implement  quality assurance/fidelity  review \nprocedures  to  ensure  that  residents'  records  are \naccurate,  complete,  and  current.  Where  the  review \nidentifies  record  keeping  deficiencies,  these \nshould be  monitored  to  ensure  that  adequate \ncorrective  action  is  taken  to  limit  their \nrecurrence. \n6. \t Ensure  that  the  informed  consent  of  a  resident's \nguardian  is obtained prior to  the  application of \nrestrictive and/or  intrusive  behavioral  and \nmedical  interventions. \nB.  ·Behavioral  Support  Planning \n1. \t Develop  and  implement  an  adequate  array of \ncomprehensive,  individualized behavior programs \nfor  the  residents  who  need  them. \na. \t For  those  residents  exhibiting  challenging \nbehaviors,  develop  and  implement  current \nbehavior  supp·ort  programs  which  include \npositive  behavioral  support  procedures. \n\n-21­\nb. \t Provide  behavior  support  plans  with \nindividualized reinforcers  and/or  preferences \nas  determined  in accordance  with  the  needs  of \neach  resident. \nc. \t Ensure  that  behavioral  programs  meet \ngenerally accepted practice  and  federal \nregulatory  requirements. \n2. \t Implement  behavior programs  through  adequate  staff \ntraining and  adequate  behavior  data  management: \n'a; \t Ensure  that  behavioral  plans  are  written  at  a \nlevel  that  can  be  understood  and  implemented \nby  direct  care  staff. \nb. \t Through  competency-based  training,  train the \nappropriate  staff how  to  implement  the \nbehavior  programs  and  ensure  that  they are \nimplemented  consistently and  effectively. \nc. \t Develop  standard protocols  for  efficient, \naccurate  collection of  behavioral  data, \nincluding  relevant  contextual  information. \nRecord  appropriate  behavioral  data  and  notes \nwith  regard  to  the  residents'  progress  on  the \nprograms. \nd. \t Monitor  adequately  the  residents'  progress  on \nthe  programs  and  revise  the  programs  when \nnecessary  to  ensure  that  residents' \nbehavioral  needs' are  being  met.  Provide \nongoing  training  for  staff whenever  a \nrevision  is  required. \nc. \t Skills, Training \n1. \t Ensure  that  all  residents  receive  meaningful \nhabilitation daily.  Ensure  that  there  is a \ncomprehensive,  interdisciplinary habilitative plan \nfor  each  resident  for  the  provision  of  such \ntraining,  services  and  supports,  formulated  by  a \nqualified  interdisciplinary team  which  identifies \nindividuals'  needs,  preferences  and  interests. \nEnsure  that  the  plans  address  the  residents' \nneeds,  preferences  and  interests  in  an  integrated \nfashion.  Ensure  that  habilitative plans  include \n\n-22­\nindividualized,  positive  reinforcement  and  teach  a \nsufficient  range  of  skills. \n2. \t Ensure  that  staff  are  trained  in how  to  implement \nthe  written habilitative plans  and  that  the  plans \nare  implemented  properly. \nD.  Communications \n1. \t Ensure  that  all  residents  with  communication \nservices  needs  identified through  individualized \nassessments  receive  appropriate  supports  and \nservices  according  to  generally accepted \nprofessional  standards. \n2. \t Ensure  that  residents'  communications  plans  are \nimplemented  and  that  staff  are  trained on  the  use \nof  such  devices. \n*  *  * \nWe  hope  to  continue  working  with  the  State  in an  amicable \nand  cooperative  fashion  to  resolve  our  outstanding  concerns  with \nregard  to Northwest. \nPlease  note  that  this  findings  letter is a  public  document. \nIt will  be  posted on  the  Civil  Rights  Division's website.  While \nwe  will  provide  a  copy  of  this  letter to  any  individual  or entity \nupon  request,  as  a  matter  of  courtesy,  we  will  not  post  this \nletter on  our  website  until  10  calendar  days  from  the  date  of \nthis  letter. \nProvid~d that  our  cooperative  relationship  continues,  we \nwill  forward  our  expert  consultants'  reports  under  separate \ncover.
