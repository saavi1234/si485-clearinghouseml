See F.T.C. v. Warner Commc'ns Inc., 742 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1984). The documents at issue are primarily drafts of memoranda and internal analyses, and, in general, are documents to which the deliberative process privilege applies.

    "summary": "<p>On February 22, 2018, four Vietnamese refugees filed this habeas petition and class action lawsuit challenging U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for allegedly arbitrarily and unlawfully detaining them.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2008, the United States and Vietnam entered an agreement governing the repatriation of Vietnamese nationals facing final orders of removal to Vietnam. One limit made part of the agreement was Vietnam's decision not to agree to repatriation of any national who had arrived in the United States before July 12, 1995. As a result, from 2008-2016, ICE maintained a policy of releasing Vietnamese nationals facing final orders of removal from ICE custody, given the impracticability of their deportation. However, in 2016, ICE reversed its policy, detaining Vietnamese nationals with final orders of removal indefinitely.</p>\r\n<p>In the original complaint, the petitioners argued that this change in policy violated 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231, which prescribes a 90-day \"removal period\" in which to remove the detainee. Petitioners relied heavily upon the Supreme Court's 2001 opinion in <em>Zadvydas v. Davis</em> (533 U.S. 678), which held that Due Process precludes the United States from indefinitely detaining immigrants for whom it is not \"reasonably foreseeable\" that deportation can occur. In addition, petitioners argued that failing to provide an individualized assessment as to whether or not detention is even necessary, due to danger or flight risk, also violated 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231 and Due Process. Petitioners sought habeas, declaratory, and injunctive relief. Represented by Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the private law firms Reed Smith and Davis Adams, the habeas petition was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (in Santa Ana).</p>\r\n<p>The petition proposed three classes of Vietnamese refugees held after receiving final orders of removal: those detained for more than 90 days (90-day class), those detained for more than 180 days (180-day class), and those detained for longer than 180 days without an individualized hearing to assess whether detention is necessary based on danger or flight risk (prolonged detention class). All class members arrived in the U.S. before 1995 and had lived in the United States as legal permanent residents (LPR) ever since. Class members faced removal proceedings after becoming involved with the criminal justice system and losing their LPR status.</p>\r\n<p>The case was initially assigned to Judge John A. Kronstadt. However, the plaintiffs in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16243\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Chhoeun v. Marin</em></a>, a case challenging ICE's detention of Cambodian refugees stripped of their legal permanent resident status due to criminal convictions, moved to relate this case to that one. On March 14, 2018, the motion was granted, and both cases were assigned to Judge Cormac J. Carney.</p>\r\n<p>On April 25, 2018, the petitioners moved for a preliminary injunction to secure the release of the named defendants. However, soon thereafter, ICE released them from detention, mooting the motion. At this point, the government moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that its claims were now moot. Petitioners responded by filing an amended complaint, acknowledging that the original named petitioners had been released from ICE custody and adding new named petitioners who were in ICE detention at the time of filing.</p>\r\n<p>In light of the amended complaint, Judge Cormac J. Carney dismissed the motion for a preliminary injunction on May 23, 2018, simply noting that the injunction was superseded by the new complaint and that the need for release no longer applied to the named petitioners in the original complaint. 2018 WL 3357577.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Carney denied the government&rsquo;s motion to dismiss on September 6, 2018. 333 F. Supp. 3d 984. The court held that the petitioners' claims were not moot because, although the named petitioners were released from detention, they could still be re-detained at any time and therefore still had a live habeas relief interest. The court also held that the petitioners had successfully pleaded claims upon which relief could be granted as to their assertions that their post-removal order detention was unlawful when removal was not likely in the foreseeable future and that detentions over six months without individualized bond hearings are unlawful.</p>\r\n<p>On October 18, 2018, Judge Carney granted in part and denied in part class certification, granting certification to the 90-day and 180-day classes only as to the declaratory \"issues of whether the Class has overcome the six month presumption of reasonableness and met its burden under <em>Zadvydas</em> [<em>v. Davis</em> (533 U.S. 678)],\" declining to certify on the injunctive issue that would have limited the government's authority to detain immigrants past 180 days. The court furthermore certified the prolonged detention class, seeking injunctive relief to compel bond hearings for the detainees. 2018 WL 11184556.</p>\r\n<p>After a year and a half of discovery, the petitioners moved for summary judgment on March 6, 2020, and the government cross-filed a month later on April 10. On June 11, 2020, the government's motion was granted in substantial part, settling all of the declaratory issues in favor of the government. Judge Carney's opinion repeatedly noted the validity of the petitioners' arguments, writing that \"many class members may be able to show that there is 'good reason to believe' their removal is unlikely\" but concluded that sweeping declarations as such would be inappropriate where individualized, fact-intensive review is the norm, noting that <em>Zadvydas</em> claims are usually made in individual habeas hearings.</p>\r\n<p>Following this ruling, the petitioners moved to reconsider but then withdrew their motion. From there, the case went silent until May 5, 2021 when Judge Carney ordered the parties to show cause as to why the case should not be dismissed and closed. The petitioners have since responded to that order; however the contents of their response have been sealed for reasons unknown. It is unclear how the change from the Trump presidential administration to the Biden administration has affected this case. Under the Biden administration, on March 15, 2021, 33 Vietnamese nationals, including at least one who arrived in the United States before 1995, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/entertainment/story/2021-03-18/o-c-organizers-urge-biden-administration-to-stop-deportation-of-vietnamese-refugees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">were deported to Vietnam</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the summer of 2021, the parties began negotiating a settlement. On July 19, 2021, Judge Cormac closed the case and stated that if a settlement was not reached within 90 days, the case would be reopened.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 5, 2021, the case was dismissed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

Judge Cormac J.

This  class  action  habeas  petition  and  complaint  for  declaratory  and \n2\ninjunctive relief is brought on behalf of Petitioners, who fled war-torn Vietnam, were \n3\naccepted by the United States as refugees before July 12, 1995 and have resided in \n4\nthe United States since they were young children or teenagers. As a result of abrupt \n5\nand unlawful actions by Respondents, Petitioners currently face unwarranted and \n6\nindefinite immigration detention. \n7\n2.  Petitioners  became  lawful  permanent  residents  of  this  country  many \n8\nyears ago but, based on criminal convictions, lost their green cards and were ordered \n9\nremoved from the United States. Although Petitioners have final orders of removal, \n10\nware  11 they cannot be repatriated under the existing repatriation agreement between the \nDela\nLLP  n the State of  1123 UStnaitteesd a Sntda ttehse  aGndo vVerinetmnaemnt.  oSfe teh eA gSroeceimaleisntt  RBeeptuwbeleicn  othf eV Gieotnvaemrn monen tth oe fA thcec eUptnaintecde  \nTH med i\nED SMInership for 14 of  the  Return  of  Vietnamese  Citizens.1  The  agreement  does  not  allow  for  the \nREy part 15 repatriation of Vietnamese immigrants who came to the United States before July 12, \nmited liabilit 16 1995 (“pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants”), a population that is largely comprised of \nA li refugees  who  fled  Vietnam  after  the  war  to  escape  persecution  under  the  new \n17\ncommunist regime.   \n18\n3.  United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) has had a \n19\nlongstanding practice of releasing pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants with final orders \n20\nof removal due to legal constraints on their detention authority. Recognizing that \n21\nremoval of pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants are “not subject to return to Vietnam” \n22\nunder the repatriation agreement, ICE has typically released these immigrants on \n23\norders of supervision within 90 days of their removal orders becoming final. The \n24\n25\n                                               \n26 1 This agreement can be found on the U.S. Department of State’s website.  See \nAttachment A (Agreement Concerning the Acceptance of the Return of Vietnamese \n27 Citizens, U.S.- NAM., Jan. 22, 2008, 08 – 43, https://www.state. \ngov/documents/organization/108921.pdf.) \n28  \nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 1 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 4 of 23   Page ID #:4\n \n1\nrepatriation agreement has thus given thousands of pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants \n2\nthe opportunity to return to their families and communities to rebuild their lives. \n3\n4.  In  2017,  ICE  abruptly  departed  from  past  enforcement  practices \n4\npertaining to pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants with final orders of removal. ICE \n5\nbegan subjecting pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants to much longer periods of post-\n6\nremoval order detention, in some cases as long as eleven months. ICE also began re-\n7\ndetaining  without  notice  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  all  across  the  United \n8\nStates who had been living peaceably in their communities on orders of supervision \n9\nfor years or decades. \n10\n5.  ICE’s  enforcement  tactics  have  sown  fear  in  Vietnamese  refugee \nware  11\nDela communities around the country. Immigrants from other countries that have also \nLLP  n the State of  1123 historically  refused  to  accept  immigrants  for  repatriation,  including  Cambodia, \nTH med i Somalia, and Iraq, are similarly experiencing indiscriminate ICE arrests, which are \nED SMInership for 14 the subjects of pending legal actions as well.    See, e.g., Nak Kim Chhoeun, et al. v.  \nREmited liability part 1156 NDoa.v i8d: 1M7-acrvin-0, 1e8t 9a8l.-,C UJCni t(eGdJ SStxa)t.e s District Court, Central District of California, Case \nA li\n17\n6.  At  the  time  of  this  filing,  Petitioners’  counsel  are  aware  of \n18\napproximately  40  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  with  final  orders  of  removal \n19\nacross the country who are beyond 90 days of post-removal order detention. The \n20\ntotal number of similarly situated individuals is likely much larger.  Furthermore, on \n21\ninformation  and  belief,  ICE  intends  to  continue  to  detain  pre-1995  Vietnamese \n22\nimmigrants  with  final  orders  of  removal.  The  number  of  Vietnamese  with  final \n23\norders of removal who are at risk of future detention is between 8,000 and 10,000. \n24\nBased on ICE estimates from 2008, an overwhelming percentage of these individuals \n25\narrived in the United States before July 12, 1995.       \n26\n7.  ICE has undertaken its detention campaign without any evidence that \n27\nVietnam  will  accept  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  that  have  been  or  will  be \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 2 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 5 of 23   Page ID #:5\n \n1\ndetained. The repatriation agreement has not been rescinded or modified by either \n2\ncountry. Given Vietnam’s longstanding policy of categorically denying repatriation \n3\nto  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants,  memorialized  in  the  existing  and  valid \n4\nrepatriation  agreement,  detention  of  Petitioners  without  an  individualized  and \n5\nspecific showing that Vietnam actually intends to accept them is unlawful. \n6\n8.  Additionally,  ICE  has  kept  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  in \n7\ndetention  past  90  days,  and  often  past  180  days,  without  providing  them  any \n8\nmeaningful custody review to determine whether continued detention is warranted \n9\nbecause they pose a danger or flight risk. ICE cannot lawfully detain Petitioners \n10\nabsent an individualized showing of danger or flight risk before a neutral decision \nware  11\nDela maker, especially as their detention becomes more prolonged.   \nLLP  n the State of  1123 JURISDICTION \nTH med i 9.

All of his children now live with Ngoc and his second \n4\nwife; he is the primary provider for his family, working as a nail salon technician. He \n5\nhas no family remaining in Vietnam. In 1994, Ngoc pleaded guilty to check fraud in \n6\nWashington, and in 2010, he was placed on probation in Georgia for simple assault \n7\nand  simple  battery.

Following a final order of removal, ICE is directed by statute to detain \n26\nan individual for 90 days in order to effectuate removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(2). This \n27\n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 7 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 10 of 23   Page ID #:10\n \n1\n90-day period, also known as “the removal period,” generally commences as soon as \n2\na removal order becomes administratively final. § 1231(a)(1)(A), § 1231(a)(1)(B). \n3\n23.  If ICE fails to remove an individual during the 90-day removal period, \n4\nthe  law  requires  ICE  to  release  the  individual  under  conditions  of  supervision, \n5\nincluding periodic reporting. § 1231(a)(3) (“If the alien . . . is not removed within the \n6\nremoval  period,  the  alien,  pending  removal,  shall  be  subject  to \n7\nsupervision.”). Limited exceptions to this rule exist. Specifically, ICE “may” detain \n8\nan individual beyond 90 days if the individual was ordered removed on criminal \n9\ngrounds or is determined to pose a danger or flight risk. § 1231(a)(6). However, \n10\nICE’s  authority  to  detain  an  individual  beyond  the  removal  period  under  such \nware  11\nDela circumstances  is  not  boundless. Rather,  it  is  constrained  by  the  constitutional \nLLP  n the State of  1123 requirement that detention “bear a reasonable relationship to the purpose for which \nTH med i the  individual  [was]  committed.” Zadvydas  v.  Davis,  533  U.S.  678,  690  (2001) \nED SMInership for 14 (citations omitted). Because the principal purpose of the post-final-order detention \nREmited liability part 1156 sift arteumteo visa lt oc aenffneoctt ubaet ee frfeemctouvataeld, .d Iedte. natti 6o9n7 b. e ars no reasonable relation to its purpose \nA li\n17\n24.  The United States Supreme Court has accordingly construed Section \n18\n1231(a)(6) as authorizing post-final order detention only for a “period reasonably \n19\nnecessary to secure removal,” a period that the Court determined to be presumptively \n20\nsix months. Id. at 699-701. After this six month period, if a detainee provides “good \n21\nreason” to believe that his or her removal is not significantly likely in the reasonably \n22\nforeseeable future, “the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut \n23\nthat showing.” Id. at 701. If the government cannot do so, the individual must be \n24\nreleased.  \n25\n25.  However, detainees are entitled to release even before six months of \n26\ndetention,  as  long  as  removal  is  not  reasonably  foreseeable.  See  8  C.F.R.  § \n27\n241.13(b)(1)  (authorizing  release  after  90  days  where  removal  not  reasonably \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 8 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 11 of 23   Page ID #:11\n \n1\nforeseeable).  Moreover,  as  the  period  of  post-final-order  detention  grows,  what \n2\ncounts as “reasonably foreseeable” must conversely shrink. Zadvydas at 701. \n3\n26.  Even  where  detention  meets  the  Zadvydas  standard  for  reasonable \n4\nforeseeability, detention violates the Due Process Clause unless it is “reasonably \n5\nrelated” to the government’s purpose, which is to prevent danger or flight risk. See \n6\nZadvydas, 533 U.S. at 700 (“[I]f removal is reasonably foreseeable, the habeas court \n7\nshould  consider  the  risk  of  the  alien’s  committing  further  crimes  as  a  factor \n8\npotentially justifying confinement within that reasonable removal period”) (emphasis \n9\nadded);  id.  at  699  (purpose  of  detention  is  “assuring  the  alien’s  presence  at  the \n10\nmoment of removal”); id. at 690-91 (discussing twin justifications of detention as \nware  11\nDela preventing  flight  and  protecting  the  community).

The  regulations,  at  8  C.F.R.  §  241.4,  set  forth  the  custody  review \n23\nprocess that existed even before the Supreme Court’s decision in Zadvydas. This \n24\nmandated process, known as the post-order custody review, requires ICE to conduct \n25\n“90-day custody reviews” prior to expiration of the 90-day removal period and to \n26\nconsider  release  of  individuals  who  pose  no  danger  or  flight  risk,  8  C.F.R.  § \n27\n241.4(e)-(f).

In 2008, after ten years of negotiation, Vietnam and the United States \nREy part 15 executed a repatriation agreement to govern the repatriation of certain Vietnamese \nmited liabilit 16 immigrants with final orders of removal to Vietnam. Before this agreement was \nA li negotiated, Vietnam refused to repatriate the overwhelming majority of Vietnamese \n17\nimmigrants ordered removed from the United States.   \n18\n31.  Vietnam and the United States stipulated that the repatriation agreement \n19\nwould be valid for five years from the date of its execution and then automatically \n20\nextended for successive three-year terms thereafter absent at least six months written \n21\nnotice of an intent to terminate from one government to the other. See Agreement, \n22\nArticle 6, Entry into Force and Duration.   \n23\n32.  Upon information and belief, the repatriation agreement has not been \n24\nterminated or modified by either Vietnam or the United States. \n25\n33.  The  repatriation  agreement  does  not  permit  the  repatriation  of \n26\nVietnamese  immigrants  who  came  to  the  United  States  before  July  12,  1995.  It \n27\nexpressly stipulates that “Vietnamese citizens are not subject to return to Vietnam \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 10 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 13 of 23   Page ID #:13\n \n1\nunder this Agreement if they arrived in the United States before July 12, 1995.” See \n2\nAgreement,  Article  2:    Removable  Persons  and  Conditions  of  Acceptance.    The \n3\ncategorical exemption of pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants from repatriation reflects \n4\nhumanitarian considerations related to the United States’ role in the Vietnam War, \n5\nthe subsequent resettlement of Vietnamese refugees in America, and the continuing \n6\ntension between the Vietnamese government and the Vietnamese refugees who were \n7\nforced to flee their homes to avoid profound hardship and persecution after the war.   \n8\n34.  The end of the Vietnam War caused hundreds of thousands of South \n9\nVietnamese refugees to flee to the United States by boat or by air to escape political \n10\npersecution  and  death.    Other  Vietnamese  immigrants  who  resettled  in  America \nware  11\nDela before July 12, 1995 were accepted to the United States to reunite with their loved \nLLP  n the State of  1123 ones or for other humanitarian reasons.

Abandoned children of American soldiers and Vietnamese women—\n19\nknown  as  “Amerasians”  and  pejoratively  referred  to  as  the  “dust  of  life”  in \n20\nVietnam—were also among the waves of Vietnamese immigrants who resettled in \n21\nthe  United  States  before  July  12,  1995.  In  addition  to  growing  up  fatherless, \n22\nAmerasians were roundly shunned by Vietnamese society for being mixed race and \n23\nborn  out  of  wedlock  and  in  many  cases  rejected  by  their  own  mothers.  These \n24\npunishing circumstances set Amerasians on a trajectory of homelessness and abject \n25\npoverty.  With  physical  features  that  betrayed  them  as  the  children  of  American \n26\nsoldiers, Amerasians became even more vulnerable to mistreatment after communist \n27\ntakeover of Vietnam in 1975, as they carried the faces of those who had fought \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 11 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 14 of 23   Page ID #:14\n \n1\nagainst  the  North  Vietnamese.  After  1975,  many  were  imprisoned  in  labor  or \n2\nreeducation camps. Recognizing the extreme persecution faced by Amerasians and \n3\nacknowledging its responsibility towards these half-American children, the United \n4\nStates in the 1980s enacted laws that gave thousands of Vietnamese Amerasians the \n5\nopportunity to leave behind a country that never accepted them in order start anew in \n6\nthe homeland of their fathers.   \n7\n36.  These early Vietnamese refugees to America lacked resources—formal \n8\neducation, English-language proficiency, a supportive ethnic community, or mental \n9\nhealth services to help cope with war-related trauma—to ease their transition to an \n10\nunfamiliar  country.  In  addition,  ad  hoc  resettlement  practices  dispersed  these \nware  11\nDela refugees,  often  pushing  them  into  economically  deteriorating,  high-crime \nLLP  n the State of  1123 neighborhoods with under-resourced schools. While many Vietnamese refugees beat \nTH med i the  odds  stacked  against  them  to  pursue  higher  education,  start  successful  small \nED SMInership for 14 businesses, and build families in their new homeland, some were convicted of crimes \nREmited liability part 1156 that res3u7l.t ed Vini eotrndaemrs’ so fl orenmgsotvaanld. ing practice of refusing repatriation has for years \nA li\n17\nprotected pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants from being removed to the country they \n18\nfled to escape starvation, violence, and death. The exclusion of pre-1995 Vietnamese \n19\nimmigrants from the repatriation agreement is central to maintaining human rights \n20\nprotections for this population. According to the U.S. Department of State’s 2016 \n21\nHuman Rights Report on Vietnam, the most significant human rights problems in \n22\nVietnam are severe government restrictions of citizens’ political rights.2 Most pre-\n23\n1995 Vietnamese immigrants are ex-citizens of South Vietnam, a country that ceased \n24\nto exist after North Vietnam prevailed in the war in April 1975, leaving hundreds of \n25\nthousands of South Vietnamese stateless.

The repatriation agreement has also profoundly impacted the way pre-\n6\n1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  have  handled  their  removal  proceedings.  Many  of \n7\nthese immigrants, who faced the possibility of years in detention while litigating \n8\ntheir  removal  cases,  at  great  financial  cost  which  most  could  not  afford,  chose \n9\ninstead  to  forego  the  pursuit  of  meritorious  defenses  based  on  the  reasonable \n10\nexpectation that they would not be deported to Vietnam. \nware  11\nDela 39.  Although  the  repatriation  agreement  officially  opened  the  door  for \nLLP  n the State of  1123 repatriation of Vietnamese immigrants who arrived to the United States on or after \nTH med i July 12, 1995, Vietnam continues to accept only a very limited number of persons \nED SMInership for 14 for repatriation each year and still regularly refuses to issue travel documents.

On information and \n18\nbelief, a negligible percentage of the removals to Vietnam have been removals of \n19\npre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants, consistent with the repatriation agreement.   \n20\n40.  Because of the exclusion of pre-1995 immigrants from the repatriation \n21\nagreement and the overall lack of cooperation from the Vietnamese government, the \n22\nUnited States government has been unable to carry out most orders of removal to \n23\nVietnam. Consequently, ICE has for years routinely released pre-1995 Vietnamese \n24\nimmigrants with final orders of removal from immigration custody upon or even \n25\nbefore expiration of the 90-day removal period. Thousands of Vietnamese returned \n26\nto their families, their jobs, and their communities and built productive, peaceful \n27\nlives following completion of their removal proceedings.  \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 13 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 16 of 23   Page ID #:16\n \n1\n41.  Currently, between 8,000 and 10,000 Vietnamese Americans are living \n2\nin the United States with final orders of removal. According to ICE estimates, 6,200 \n3\nof the 7,700 Vietnamese who had final orders of removal in 2008 came to the United \n4\nStates  before  1995,  indicating  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  8,000  to  10,000 \n5\nVietnamese with final orders of removal today are pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants. \n6\nUnlawful Detention in Violation of the Repatriation Agreement  \n7\n42.

Immigrants from these countries filed class \n17\naction lawsuits around the country challenging ICE’s unlawful denial of due process \n18\nto their communities.        \n19\n44.  ICE  likewise  aggressively  stepped  up  enforcement  against  the \n20\nVietnamese  community  in  2017.  It  ended  its  practice  of  releasing  pre-1995 \n21\nVietnamese immigrants from detention promptly following their orders of removal. \n22\nInstead,  deportation  officers  began  holding  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  for \n23\nlonger than 90 days, and often longer than 180 days, citing a directive from ICE \n24\nHeadquarters. \n25\n45.  In  March  2017,  ICE  also  began  re-arresting  pre-1995  Vietnamese \n26\nimmigrants with final orders of removal whom it had previously released.

In  October  2017,  ICE  again  carried  out  mass  arrests  of  Vietnamese \n7\nimmigrants with final orders of removal who had returned to their communities on \n8\norders of supervision—including pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants.

However, the government has not substantiated this claim with \n19\nany official document memorializing Vietnam’s alleged change in policy, and the \n20\nrepatriation  agreement  remains  in  effect.  Further,  the  Vietnamese  government’s \n21\nconduct does not signal any meaningful departure from its categorical refusal to \n22\nrepatriate  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants,  despite  continued  pressure  from  the \n23\nUnited States. \n24\n49.  On information and belief, the Vietnamese government has only issued \n25\ntravel  documents  to  seven  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants.

On information and belief, Vietnam is extremely reluctant to issue travel \n8\ndocuments to individuals like Petitioners who have no family in Vietnam; whose \n9\nfamilies in the United States will suffer hardship as a result of their deportation; \n10\nand/or who do not wish to return to Vietnam. In addition to Petitioners, the pre-1995 \nware  11\nDela Vietnamese immigrants detained by ICE include at least four Amerasians whom \nLLP  n the State of  1123 Vietnam is highly unlikely to repatriate.   \nTH med i 51.

Furthermore, Petitioners and class members are being detained without \n23\nan individualized hearing before a neutral decision maker to assess whether detention \n24\nis warranted due to danger or flight risk. This includes Petitioners Ngoc Hoang and \n25\nLong Nguyen and class members who for years consistently and reliably reported to \n26\nICE as required under their orders of supervision.   \n27\n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 16 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 19 of 23   Page ID #:19\n \n1\n54.  To  the  extent  that  ICE  has  been  conducting  any  90-day  post-order \n2\ncustody reviews for Petitioners and other class members, they have been perfunctory, \n3\nresulting in boilerplate decisions that merely rubberstamp continued detention. Some \n4\nclass members have been told by ICE employees that Vietnamese with final orders \n5\nof removal will continue to be detained until the Vietnamese government issues a \n6\ntravel  document,  though  some  requests  for  travel  documents  have  been  pending \n7\nsince  late  October  or  early  November  2017  and  others  since  March  2017.  On \n8\ninformation and belief, the refusal to release any pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants \n9\nafter 90 days is driven by an ICE Headquarters policy being uniformly implemented \n10\nacross the United States.   \nware  11 CLASS ALLEGATIONS \nDela\nLLP  n the State of  1123 similar5ly5 . situPaetetidti opneerrsso nbsr ipnugr stuhains t atcot iFoend eorna l bReuhlaelsf  ooff  Cthiveiml sPerlovceesd  uarned  2a3l(la )o tahnedr  \nTH med i\nED SMInership for 14 23(b)(2), and as a representative habeas class action for similarly situated persons \nREy part 15 pursuant to a procedure analogous to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2).

Respondent’s conduct and refusal to act apply generally to the 90-day \n2\nClass and 180-day Class, thereby making the final injunctive relief and declaratory \n3\nrelief sought by the Petitioners appropriate with respect to the class as a whole.  \n4\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n5\nCount One: Unlawful Detention Where Removal Is Not Reasonably Foreseeable \n6\n61.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n7\n62.  Post-removal order detention violates Section 1231 where removal is \n8\nnot significantly likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future. Zadvydas v. \n9\nDavis,  533  U.S.  678  (2001).  Detention  under  these  circumstances  also  violates \n10\nconstitutional due process. \nware  11\nDela 63.  Petitioners’ and class members’ removal is not significantly likely to \nLLP  n the State of  1123 occur in the reasonably foreseeable future because they are specifically excluded \nTH med i from repatriation under the repatriation agreement. \nED SMInership for 14 64.

Through the repatriation agreement and Vietnam’s historical practice, \n20\nPetitioners and class members have made their initial showing under Zadvydas of \n21\n“good reason to believe” that their removal is not reasonably foreseeable. Id. at 701. \n22\n66.  Petitioners and class members have shifted the burden to Respondents \n23\nto  produce  individualized  evidence  that  their  removal  is  reasonably \n24\nforeseeable. Respondents lack such evidence, yet continue to detain Petitioners and \n25\nclass members in violation of Section 1231 and constitutional due process. \n26\n67.  Petitioners and class members are entitled under the law to immediate \n27\nrelease on orders of supervision. \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 19 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 22 of 23   Page ID #:22\n \n1 Count Two: Unlawful Detention Without \nDeterminations of Danger and Flight Risk \n2\n68.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n3\n69.  Even  when  removal  is  reasonably  foreseeable,  detention  violates \n4\nSection  1231  and  due  process  under  the  United  States  Constitution  unless  it  is \n5\nreasonably related to the government’s purposes of preventing flight and protecting \n6\nthe community. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690-91. \n7\n70.  Respondents are subjecting Petitioners and class members to months of \n8\ndetention without any individualized determination that they pose a danger or flight \n9\nrisk that would justify their detention.  \n10\n71.  The only procedure the government has provided—administrative post-\nware  11\nDela order  custody  reviews—is  inadequate  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  due \nLLP  n the State of  1123 process.

The U.S. Government will carry out the repatriation of Vietnamese\ncitizens who violated U.S. law in accordance with U.S. and international law\nand the provisions of this Agreement. The repatriation should take into\naccount the humanitarian aspect, family unity and circumstances of each\nperson in each individual case.\n2. The Vietnamese Government may consider the return of its citizens\nwho violated U.S. law based on the consideration of legal procedures and the\t\n'/\n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1-1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 3 of 8   Page ID #:26\nstatus and circumstances of each individual case. The subject individuals and\nthe acceptance procedure will be based on the terms of this Agreement.\n3. Repatriation will be carried out in an orderly and safe way, and with\nrespect for the individual human dignity of the person repatriated. The U.S.\nGovernment will allow Vietnamese citizens who have been ordered removed\na reasonable time to arrange their personal affairs before returning them to\nVietnam.\n4. Persons repatriated under this Agreement have the right to transfer\ntheir legal money and personal property to Vietnam.\n5. The U.S. Government will pay for the cost of returning to Vietnam\npersons repatriated under this Agreement, as provided in Article 5 and Annex\n1. The U.S. Government will also pay for the cost of returning to the United\nStates any person who was mistakenly repatriated, in accordance with Article\n3 of this Agreement.\nArticle 2\nRemovable Persons and Conditions of Acceptance\n1. The Vietnamese Government will accept the return of Vietnamese\ncitizens in accordance with Article 1 and item 2 of Article 2 of this\nAgreement, if upon investigation the individual meets the following\nrequirements:\n(a) The individual is a citizen of Vietnam and is not a citizen of the\nUnited States or of any other country;\n(b) The individual previously resided in Vietnam and has no current\nresidence in a third country;\n(c) The individual has violated U.S. laws and has been ordered by\ncompetent authority removed from the United States; and\n(d) If the individual has been convicted of a criminal offense (including\nimmigration violation), the person will have completed any imprisonment\nbefore removal, and any reduction in sentence will have been ordered by\ncompetent authority.\n2. Vietnamese citizens are not subject to return to Vietnam under this\nAgreement if they arrived in the United States before July 12, 1995, the date\non which diplomatic relations were re-established between the U.S.\nA\t 1111\n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1-1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 4 of 8   Page ID #:27\nGovernment and the Vietnamese Government. The U.S. Government and the\nVietnamese Government maintain their respective legal positions relative to\nVietnamese citizens who departed Vietnam for the United States prior to that\ndate.\n3. In the case of a citizen of Vietnam who immigrated to the United\nStates from a third country where that person had a permanent residence and\nwho has been ordered removed from the United States, the U.S. Government\nwill seek to return that person to the third country or consider allowing that\nperson to stay in the United States, before requesting removal to Vietnam.\n4. In any case where the Vietnamese Government obtains information\nrelevant to the repatriation of an individual that was not previously considered\nby the U.S. Government, the Vietnamese Government may request a\nhumanitarian reconsideration based on the specific circumstances of the\nrepatriated person in accordance with United States law.\nArticle 3\nReturn of Persons Repatriated in Error\nUpon notice by the Vietnamese Government that a person returned to\nVietnam by the U.S. Government does not meet all criteria mentioned in\nArticle 2 of this Agreement, the U.S. Government should promptly receive\nthe return of that person to the United States without any special procedure.\nArticle 4\nAcceptance Procedures\n1. When the U.S. Government believes that a removable person is a\ncitizen of Vietnam and meets all criteria within Article 2 of this Agreement,\nthe U.S. Department of Homeland Security, on behalf of the U.S.\nGovernment, will request appropriate travel documents from the Vietnamese\nGovernment and will forward the appropriate files to that Government. Such\nfiles will include three sets of documents, the original and two copies. The\noriginal and one copy shall be forwarded to the Vietnamese Ministry of\nPublic Security (Immigration Department) by the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam,\nand the other copy will be sent to the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n(Consular Department).\nEach file will contain a diplomatic note which requests that the\nVietnamese Government accept the returnee, the name of the person the U.S.\nGovernment believes should be repatriated to Vietnam, the appropriate forms\ncompleted by such person (an example of which is provided in Annex 2 of\n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316   Document 1-1   Filed 02/22/18   Page 5 of 8   Page ID #:28\nthis Agreement), a copy of the order of removal, and other documents\nregarding the person's biography, citizenship, criminal history, sentence\nimposed, and decision of amnesty or reduction of criminal sentence. The\norder of removal will be translated into Vietnamese on the standard form, and\nthe criminal history will include a National Crime Information Center (NCIC)\nrecord in English accompanied by a code key translated into Vietnamese. All\ndocuments and translations will be certified by the competent U.S. authorities.\n2. Upon request by the Vietnamese Government, the U.S. Government\nwill arrange and facilitate the interview of persons who fall within Article\n2(1) of this Agreement by Vietnamese immigration officials to determine\ninformation regarding the Vietnamese citizenship, biographical data, and last\nplace of residence of such persons. The U.S. Department of Homeland\nSecurity will arrange a venue for those interviews. The U.S. Government also\nwill facilitate interviews by U.S.-based consular officers of the Vietnamese\nGovernment of deportable persons whom the U.S. believes to be Vietnamese\ncitizens.\n3. The Vietnamese Government will provide a prompt response to the\nU.S. Government on cases referred under this Article after the Vietnamese\nverification is made. If it is determined that a person whose name and file has\nbeen provided to the Vietnamese Government in accordance with this Article\nmeets the requirements of Article 2, the Ministry of Public Security of the\nVietnamese Government will issue a travel document authorizing that\nperson's return to Vietnam, and will provide written notification to the U.S.\nEmbassy in Vietnam.\n4. When the Vietnamese Government has issued a travel document\nunder this Agreement, the U.S. Government will provide at least fifteen (15)\ndays notice of the flight and travel arrangements by which the person will be\nreturned to Vietnam. The U.S. Embassy in Vietnam will inform the Ministry\nof Public Security (Immigration Department) and the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs (Consular Department) of the date and number of the flight, the time\nof arrival, the port of entry (Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi or Tan Son Nhat Airport\nin Ho Chi Minh City), and the details regarding any U.S. officers escorting\nthe person to be returned (such as names, dates of birth, passport numbers,\nestimated times of stay in Vietnam, etc), and allow the Vietnamese side to\nconfirm receipt of the returnees.\nWhen a person under medical treatment is returned to Vietnam under\nthis Agreement, the escorting U.S. officers will provide a copy of the person's\nhealth record to the receiving Vietnamese officials at the port of entry.

(Dkt. 27 [First Amended Habeas Corpus \n1\nPetition and Class Action Complaint, hereinafter “FAC”] ¶¶ 1–4.)  Petitioners allege that \n2\nin 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) began subjecting these \n3\n“pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants” to prolonged, post-removal order detention despite \n4\nthe purportedly remote possibility of their removal to Vietnam.  (Id. ¶ 4.)  \n5\n  \n6\nPetitioners bring two causes of action for habeas relief, declaratory relief, and \n7\ninjunctive relief.  (Id. ¶ 76.)  In Count One, Petitioners assert that their post-removal \n8\norder detention violates federal immigration law, 8 U.S.C. § 1231, and constitutional due \n9\nprocess where removal is not likely to occur in the foreseeable future.  (Id. ¶¶ 64–70.)  In \n10\nCount Two, Petitioners assert that even where removal is reasonably foreseeable, their \n11\nprolonged detention violates section 1231 and constitutional due process when it is \n12\n“without any individualized determination that they pose a danger or flight risk.”  (Id. ¶¶ \n13\n72–75.)   \n14\n \n15\nPetitioners bring these causes of action on behalf of themselves and three putative \n16\nclasses: (1) all pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have been or will be detained by \n17\nICE for more than 90 days after receiving removal orders (“90-Day Class”), (2) all pre-\n18\n1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have been or will be detained by ICE for more than \n19\n180 days after receiving removal orders (“180-Day Class”), and (3) all pre-1995 \n20\nVietnamese immigrants who have been or will be detained by ICE for more than 180 \n21\ndays without a bond hearing (“Prolonged Detention Class”).  (Id. ¶ 59.)  \n22\n \n23\n  Before the Court is Defendants’ hybrid motion to dismiss and habeas return. (Dkt. \n24\n56 [hereinafter “Mot.”].)  For the following reasons, the motion is DENIED.1 \n25\n26\n                                                           \n27\n1  Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate \n28 for disposition without a hearing.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15.  Accordingly, the hearing set \nfor September 10, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. is hereby vacated and off calendar. \n-2- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 3 of 18   Page ID #:841\n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n1\n \n2\n  Petitioners are citizens of Vietnam who immigrated to the United States before \n3\nJuly 12, 1995.  (FAC ¶ 1.)  Petitioners became lawful permanent residents years ago but, \n4\nbased on criminal convictions, lost their green cards and were ordered removed.  (Id. ¶ 2.)  \n5\nPetitioners allege that until recently, ICE had a longstanding practice of detaining pre-\n6\n1995 Vietnamese immigrants for no longer than 90 days.  (Id. ¶ 3.)  This practice was \n7\npurportedly implemented because a 2008 diplomatic agreement between the United \n8\nStates and Vietnam provides that Vietnamese citizens who arrived to the United States \n9\nbefore July 12, 1995 are not subject to return to Vietnam.  (Id. ¶¶ 2, 36; Ex. A, Art. 2, ¶ \n10\n2.)  The parties seemingly do not dispute that the 2008 agreement is still in effect.2 \n11\n \n12\n  Petitioners allege that in 2017, ICE departed from this longstanding practice and \n13\nbegan subjecting pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants to prolonged periods of detention.  \n14\n(Id. ¶ 4.)  ICE also purportedly began re-detaining, without notice, pre-1995 Vietnamese \n15\nimmigrants who had previously been released from detention and were living on orders \n16\nof supervision.  (Id.)  On February 22, 2018, four of the named Petitioners filed this \n17\naction challenging their detention.  (Dkt. 1.)  On April 30, 2018, the Government moved \n18\nto dismiss the case, arguing it was moot because the four named Petitioners had since \n19\nbeen released from custody.  (Dkt. 24.)  On May 11, 2018, Petitioners filed the operative \n20\nFirst Amended Habeas Corpus Petition and Class Action Complaint, adding three new \n21\nPetitioners who were, at the time, in immigration detention.  (FAC.)  All seven named \n22\nPetitioners, described below, have now been released from custody. \n23\n \n24\n25                                                            \n2 The agreement can be accessed on the U.S. Department of State’s website at \n26\nhttps://www.state.gov/documents/organization/108921.pdf.  The agreement states it will be valid for five \nyears and extended automatically for successive three-year terms thereafter, unless written notice not to \n27\nextend is given by either country.  (TAC Ex. A, Art. 6.)  Petitioners allege and Defendants do not contest \n28 that the agreement has not been terminated or modified by either country.

Hoang’s wife, two children, parents, and six sisters are all U.S. citizens.  \n4\n(Id.)  In early 2015, Hoang was arrested on a drug charge, for which he served one year \n5\nin prison.  (Id.)  Hoang was later incarcerated for alleged possession of a marijuana plant \n6\nbefore being transferred to ICE custody in June 2017.  (Id.)  He was ordered removed on \n7\nJuly 27, 2017.  (Id.)  He remained in immigration detention until April 16, 2018, when he \n8\nwas released on an order of supervision.  (Id.)  He did not receive a bond hearing.  (Id.)   \n9\n \n10\n  Petitioner Vu Ha is a resident of Orange County, California, who legally entered \n11\nthe United States as a ten-year-old refugee in 1990 and became a lawful permanent \n12\nresident shortly thereafter.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  His parents, sister, and daughter are U.S. citizens.  \n13\n(Id.)  He was arrested three times as a young adult between 2000 and 2005, once being \n14\nfor robbery.  (Id.)  In 2017, he was arrested and detained for failure to pay a citation for \n15\ndriving without a license.  (Id.)  He was transported from county jail to ICE custody in \n16\nMay 2017 and was ordered removed on September 19, 2017.  (Id.)

Although he reliably reported to ICE for years under his order of supervision, he \n1\nwas pulled over on his way to work and detained from October 19, 2017 to March 23, \n2\n2018, when he was again released on an order of supervision.  (Id.)   \n3\n \n4\n  Petitioner Ngoc Hoang is a resident of Gwinnett County, Georgia, who legally \n5\nentered the United States in 1990.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  Hoang was married to a U.S. citizen with \n6\nwhom he has four children, all under the age of eighteen.  (Id.)  Hoang works as a nail \n7\nsalon technician.  (Id.)  In 1994, he pled guilty to check fraud and in 2010, he was placed \n8\non probation for simple assault and simple battery.  (Id.)  He was ordered removed on \n9\nDecember 12, 2012 and released on an order of supervision approximately two months \n10\nlater.  (Id.)  Over the next five years, Hoang complied with the requirements of that order.  \n11\n(Id.)  But on November 6, 2017, he was unexpectedly re-arrested by ICE officers at his \n12\nhome.  (Id.)  He was detained until April 23, 2018, when he was released on an order of \n13\nsupervision.  (Id.)   \n14\n \n15\n  Petitioner Sieu Nguyen is a resident of Sacramento, California, who escaped \n16\nVietnam when he was three years old.  (Id. ¶ 15.)  Sieu and his family were accepted as \n17\nrefugees in September 1989, and he became a lawful permanent resident shortly \n18\nthereafter.  (Id.)  His parents and seven siblings are all U.S. citizens.  (Id.)  Sieu was \n19\nconvicted of robbery in 2007 and burglary and receipt of stolen property in 2010.  (Id.)  \n20\nAfter serving time in prison, he was transferred to a detention facility.  (Id.)

(Id.)  In April 2017, he was released on parole from state prison \n1\nand transferred to ICE custody.  (Id.)  He was ordered removed on October 26, 2017, \n2\n(id.), and has since been released from custody. \n3\n \n4\n  Petitioner Bao Duong is a resident of San Diego, California, who legally entered \n5\nthe United States as a refugee in 1980 and became a lawful permanent resident the same \n6\nyear.  (Id. ¶ 17.)  His parents are lawful permanent residents and his three sisters are U.S. \n7\ncitizens.  (Id.)  In 2013, Duong was convicted of robbery and imprisoned for three years.  \n8\n(Id.)  He was released on parole in June 2016 and arrested for alleged possession of \n9\nmarijuana in September 2017.  (Id.)  He was transferred to ICE custody and ordered \n10\nremoved from the United States on November 14, 2017.  (Id.)  He has since been released \n11\nfrom custody. \n12\n \n13\n  Petitioners allege that ICE’s abrupt change in practices with respect to the named \n14\nPetitioners and similarly situated individuals is unlawful because there is no evidence that \n15\nVietnam will now accept the return of pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants.  (Id. ¶ 54.)  \n16\nDefendants argue that ICE’s change in practices was based on a “new understanding” \n17\nbetween the United States and Vietnam regarding the removal of pre-1995 immigrants.  \n18\n(Mot. at 14.)  Defendants assert that pursuant to that understanding, ICE has removed \n19\neleven pre-1995 individuals to Vietnam since July 2017.  (Dkt. 37-1 [Declaration of \n20\nMichael Bernacke, hereinafter “Bernacke Decl.”] ¶ 6; Dkt. 56-1 [Second Declaration of \n21\nMichael Bernacke, hereinafter “Bernacke Decl. II”] ¶ 6.) \n22\n \n23\n  On July 2, 2018, Defendants filed an ex parte application to sever Petitioners’ \n24\nhabeas and civil rights claims.  (Dkt. 53.)  The Court denied the application because both \n25\nof Petitioners’ claims “seek habeas relief, along with injunctive and declaratory relief.”  \n26\n(Dkt. 54 at 4.)  On July 20, 2018, Defendants filed the instant hybrid motion to dismiss \n27\nand habeas return.  (Dkt. 56.)  On August 28, 2018, Petitioners filed a motion for \n28\n-6- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 7 of 18   Page ID #:845\n \ncertification of its three putative classes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  \n1\n(Dkt. 65.)   \n2\n \n3\nIII.  DISCUSSION \n4\n \n5\n  Defendants move to dismiss Petitioners’ claims as moot under Federal Rule of \n6\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(1) because the seven named Petitioners have been released from \n7\ncustody.  In the alternative, Defendants move to deny habeas relief on the merits and \n8\ndismiss the non-habeas claims for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).   \n9\nDefendants also argue that Petitioners’ claims with respect to the putative 90-Day Class \n10\nmembers are premature.  The Court considers each argument in turn. \n11\n \n12\nA.  Mootness   \n13\n \n14\n  Defendants first move to dismiss both of Petitioners’ claims as moot.  (Mot. at 10.)  \n15\nDefendants argue that this action does not involve a live case or controversy because the \n16\nseven named Petitioners have been released from detention, and no exception to \n17\nmootness applies.  (Id. at 11.)  Petitioners contend that their action continues to present a \n18\nlive case or controversy despite Petitioners’ release.  (Opp. at 7–10.)  Petitioners also \n19\nargue that even if their habeas claims are moot, the “inherently transitory” exception to \n20\nmootness applies.  The inherently transitory exception applies where a class \n21\nrepresentative’s claims will likely expire before the court can certify a class and other \n22\nsimilarly situated individuals will continue to suffer the same injury.  Pitts v. Terrible \n23\nHerbst, Inc., 653 F.3d 1081, 1090 (9th Cir. 2011).  When a claim is inherently transitory, \n24\ncertification of the class “relat[es] back” to the time the complaint was filed to “preserve \n25\nthe merits of the case for judicial resolution.”  County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 \n26\nU.S. 44, 52 (1991).  Because the Court finds that Petitioners’ claims are not moot, it need \n27\nnot address whether the inherently transitory exception to mootness applies.  \n28\n-7- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 8 of 18   Page ID #:846\n \n  Mootness is properly raised in a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.  White v. Lee, \n1\n227 F.3d 1214, 1242 (9th Cir. 2000).  For a court to have Article III standing to hear a \n2\ncase, there must be an actual case or controversy.  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  The \n3\nplaintiff must allege a concrete injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the defendant’s \n4\nunlawful conduct and that is likely redressable by a favorable decision.  Lujan v. \n5\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  If circumstances arise such that issues \n6\nare no longer “live” or the parties no longer hold a “legally cognizable interest” in the \n7\naction, the court must dismiss the action as moot.  Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, \n8\n496 (1969).  However, “a case is not moot if any effective relief may be granted,” and the \n9\nparty asserting mootness “bears a heavy burden.”  Karuk Tribe of Calif. v. U.S. Forest \n10\nServ., 681 F.3d 1006, 1017 (9th Cir. 2012).   \n11\n \n12\n  Petitioners’ claims continue to present a live controversy despite the named \n13\nPetitioners’ release from detention.  A habeas petition continues to present a live \n14\ncontroversy after a petitioner’s release if there is “some remaining collateral consequence \n15\nthat may be redressed by success on that petition.”  Abdala v. Immigration & \n16\nNaturalization Serv., 488 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2007), cert. denied (internal citations \n17\nand quotations omitted).  Because Plaintiffs may be re-detained at any time, they retain a \n18\nlive interest in habeas relief.  See Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1117 (9th Cir. \n19\n2009) (ICE’s release of petitioner did not moot habeas petition where there was “no \n20\nmeaningful substantive limit” on ICE’s ability to re-detain him); Clark v. Martinez, 543 \n21\nU.S. 371, 376 n.3 (2005) (petitioner’s unlawful detention claim continued to involve a \n22\n“live case or controversy” because his release could be revoked in ICE’s discretion).   \n23\n \n24\nDefendants rely on Abdala v. INS for the assertion that “a habeas petition does not \n25\ncontinue to present a live controversy once the petitioner is released from custody.”  \n26\n(Mot. 11.)  However, Defendants overstate Abdala’s holding.  In Abdala, the Ninth \n27\nCircuit held that the habeas petition challenging only the length of detention became \n28\n-8- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 9 of 18   Page ID #:847\n \nmoot when the petitioner was deported, not simply released in ICE’s discretion, because \n1\nthe court could no longer provide any relief.  Id. at 1065.  The Ninth Circuit in Abdala \n2\nstated, however, that even “[d]eportation from the United States after filing a habeas \n3\npetition does not necessarily moot a petitioner’s claim.”  Id. at 1063.  In the other cases \n4\nthat Defendants cite, the petitioners had been deported or had already received the relief \n5\nthey sought.  See Qalinle v. Donahue, 2016 WL 674939, at *2 (D. Ariz. Jan. 29, 2016) \n6\n(characterizing petitioner’s claim as moot because the relief he requested, an order of \n7\nsupervision, could not be granted where petitioner was already released from custody); \n8\nMartinez-Reyes v. Burns, 2011 WL 1375293, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2011) (holding \n9\nthat because petitioner’s removal to Mexico meant he was released from ICE custody, he \n10\n“received the only relief [the] Court might provide him” under his habeas petition).  Here, \n11\nby contrast, Petitioners do not seek release from detention alone.  Petitioners also seek \n12\ndeclaratory relief that their removal to Vietnam is not reasonably foreseeable and that \n13\nthey are entitled to individualized bond hearings.  The Court can still provide Petitioners \n14\nrelief.  Defendants have failed to meet their “heavy burden” of showing Petitioners’ \n15\nclaims are moot.  See Karuk Tribe of Calif., 681 F.3d at 1017.  \n16\n \n17\nB.  Failure to State a Claim  \n18\n \n19\nDefendants next move to dismiss Petitioners’ claims for failure to state a claim \n20\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  (Mot. at 13.)3  A motion to dismiss \n21\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the claims asserted in the complaint.  \n22\nThe issue on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is not whether the claimant \n23\n24\n                                                           \n25 3 Defendants filed a hybrid motion to dismiss and habeas return, seeking dismissal of the non-habeas \nclaims for failure to state a claim and denial of habeas relief on the merits.  (Mot. at 1.)  To the extent \n26\nthat Defendants ask the Court to sever Petitioners’ claims into their habeas and non-habeas components, \nthe Court has already declined to do so.  (See Dkt. 54 [order denying Defendants’ ex parte application].)  \n27\nAnd for the Court to reach the merits of the habeas claims, an evidentiary hearing is required because \n28 there is a factual dispute regarding whether Petitioners face a significant likelihood of removal in the \nforeseeable future.  Owino v. Napolitano, 575 F.3d 952, 956 (9th Cir. 2009). \n-9- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 10 of 18   Page ID #:848\n \nwill ultimately prevail, but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support \n1\nthe claims asserted.  Gilligan v. Jamco Dev. Corp., 108 F.3d 246, 249 (9th Cir. 1997).  \n2\nRule 12(b)(6) is read in conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires only a short and plain \n3\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4\n8(a)(2).  When evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the district court must accept all \n5\nmaterial allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable \n6\nto the non-moving party.  Moyo v. Gomez, 32 F.3d 1382, 1384 (9th Cir. 1994).  The \n7\ndistrict court may also consider additional facts in materials that the district court may \n8\ntake judicial notice, Barron v. Reich, 13 F.3d 1370, 1377 (9th Cir. 1994), as well as \n9\n“documents whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no party \n10\nquestions, but which are not physically attached to the pleading,” Branch v. Tunnell, 14 \n11\nF.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 1994), overruled in part on other grounds by Galbraith v. Cnty. of \n12\nSanta Clara, 307 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2002).   \n13\n14\n \n15 However, “the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained \n16 in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n17 (2009); see also Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (stating that while \n18 a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual \n19 allegations, courts “are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual \n20 allegation” (citations and quotations omitted)).  Dismissal of a complaint for failure to \n21 state a claim is not proper where a plaintiff has alleged “enough facts to state a claim to \n22 relief that is plausible on its face.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.   \n23\n \n24 1.  Count One: Likelihood of Removal  \n25  \n26 In Count One, Petitioners assert that their post-removal order detention violates \n27 federal immigration law and constitutional due process where their removal is not likely \n28 to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future.  (FAC ¶¶ 64–70.)   Petitioners assert Count \n-10- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 11 of 18   Page ID #:849\n \nOne on behalf of all three putative classes.  Defendants argue that Count One does not \n1\nstate a claim because Petitioners have failed to establish that pre-1995 Vietnamese \n2\nimmigrants are not likely to be removed in the foreseeable future.  (Mot. at 13–15.)  \n3\nDefendants also argue that Count One as to the 90-Day Class is unripe.  (Id. at 16–18). \n4\n \n5\n  Petitioners’ post-removal order detention is governed by federal immigration law, \n6\n8 U.S.C. § 1231.  Section 1231 provides that after an alien is ordered removed, the \n7\nGovernment “shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days.”  \n8\nId. § 1231(a)(1)(A).  During the 90-day removal period, the Government “shall detain the \n9\nalien.”  Id. § 1231(a)(2).  Once the 90-day removal period ends, the Government may \n10\ncontinue to detain certain aliens, such as Petitioners, whose criminal convictions render \n11\nthem removable.  Id. § 1231(a)(6).  Section 1231(a)(6), however, does not authorize the \n12\nGovernment to detain an alien indefinitely.  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 688–702 \n13\n(2001).  Rather, the statute, “read in light of the Constitution’s demands, limits an alien’s \n14\npost-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about the alien’s \n15\nremoval.”  Id. at 689.  In Zadvydas, the Supreme Court held that six months is a \n16\n“presumptively” reasonable period of detention.  Id. at 701.  If after six months, the \n17\nnoncitizen provides “good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of \n18\nremoval in the reasonably foreseeable future,” the Government must provide sufficient \n19\nevidence to rebut the noncitizen’s showing of indefinite detention.  Id.  \n20\n \n21\n  Petitioners argue that their removal is unlikely to occur in the reasonably \n22\nforeseeable future because the 2008 United States-Vietnam diplomatic agreement \n23\n“expressly excludes pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants from repatriation.”  (FAC ¶ 67.)   \n24\nThat agreement provides that “Vietnamese citizens are not subject to return to Vietnam \n25\nunder this agreement if they arrived in the United States before July 12, 1995.”  (Id. Ex. \n26\nA, Art. 2, ¶ 2.)  Petitioners assert that ICE has had a longstanding practice of releasing \n27\npre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants under removal orders on the basis of this agreement.  \n28\n-11- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 12 of 18   Page ID #:850\n \n(FAC ¶ 3.)  Because these immigrants are “not subject to return to Vietnam,” Petitioners \n1\ncontend that ICE has typically released them on orders of supervision.  (Id.)  Although \n2\nICE has since departed from that practice and has begun subjecting pre-1995 Vietnamese \n3\nimmigrants to longer post-removal order detention, (id. ¶ 4), Petitioners argue that \n4\nremoval is still not reasonably foreseeable for two reasons.  First, Petitioners argue that \n5\nthe 2008 repatriation agreement is still in effect.  Second, Petitioners argue that \n6\nVietnam’s past practice of refusing these immigrants shows it will continue to refuse \n7\nrepatriation of the “hundreds of pre-1995 Vietnamese [immigrants] whom ICE is \n8\ncurrently detaining or will likely detain under its current detention campaign.”  (Id. ¶¶ 51, \n9\n54.)     \n10\n \n11\n  Petitioners have alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for indefinite detention that \n12\nis “plausible on its face.”  See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.  Under Zadvydas, a noncitizen’s \n13\ndetention under section 1231(a)(6) is limited to a “period reasonably necessary to bring \n14\nabout that alien’s removal.”  533 U.S. at 689.  Here, Petitioners allege that their detention \n15\nis unlawful because there is no likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.  \n16\nIn support of this allegation, Petitioners allege that due to the 2008 repatriation agreement \n17\nstill in effect, Vietnam has not accepted the great majority of pre-1995 immigrants.  (FAC \n18\n¶¶ 51, 54.)  According to ICE’s estimates, 6,200 of the 7,700 Vietnamese immigrants \n19\nsubject to final orders of removal in 2008 immigrated to the United States before 1995.  \n20\n(Id. ¶ 44.)  Although Petitioners acknowledge that a small number of pre-1995 \n21\nVietnamese immigrants have since been removed, that number pales in comparison to the \n22\nestimated 6,200 pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who are either in detention or face the \n23\nrisk of future detention.  (See id. ¶¶ 44, 52.)  Named Petitioners Vu Ha and Hoang Trinh, \n24\nfor instance, were both held in immigration detention for approximately 300 days, far \n25\npast the presumptively reasonable six-month period in Zadvydas.  (See id. ¶¶ 11, 12.)   \n26\n \n27\n// \n28\n-12- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 13 of 18   Page ID #:851\n \n  Defendants nevertheless argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under \n1\nCount One because recent developments in United States-Vietnam relations indicate that \n2\nremoval to Vietnam is no longer unlikely in the foreseeable future.  Defendants assert \n3\nthat the 2008 United States-Vietnam diplomatic agreement provides that citizens are not \n4\nsubject to return to Vietnam under the terms of that agreement only.  (Mot. at 14 [citing \n5\nFAC Ex. A, Art. 2, ¶ 2].)  The United States may however, “under agreements or \n6\nunderstandings other than the 2008 amendment,” still remove pre-1995 Vietnamese \n7\nimmigrants.  (Mot. at 14.)   Defendants assert that the United States and Vietnam reached \n8\none such understanding in mid-2017, pursuant to which ICE has removed eleven pre-\n9\n1995 Vietnamese immigrants since July 2017.  (Mot. at 14 [citing Bernacke Decl. ¶ 6; \n10\nBernacke Decl. II ¶ 6].)  For these assertions, Defendants rely on sworn affidavits by an \n11\nICE official. (See Bernacke Decl. ¶ 1.) \n12\n  \n13\n  On a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule 12(b)(6), however, the Court “may not \n14\nconsider any material beyond the pleadings.”  Friedman v. AARP, Inc., 855 F.4d 1047, \n15\n1051 (9th Cir. 2017).  Defendants argue that the pleadings standards under Rule 12 are \n16\n“inconsistent with the standards and procedures” that the Supreme Court outlined in \n17\nZadvydas.  (Dkt. 62 [Reply] at 5.)  Defendants claim that on a motion to dismiss a \n18\nZadvydas claim, the Court should not accept the petitioner’s allegations as true and must \n19\nconsider the defendant’s declarations and other evidence beyond the pleadings.  (Id. at 6.)  \n20\nThe Court declines to adopt Defendants’ approach here.  The Supreme Court in Zadvydas \n21\nestablished a burden-shifting framework by which Defendants have an opportunity to \n22\nrebut Petitioners’ showing.  Defendants fail to cite any binding authority that interprets \n23\nZadvydas as requiring this Court to eschew well-established pleading standards.  Given \n24\nICE’s allegedly longstanding practice of not removing pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants \n25\nand the 2008 diplomatic agreement, Petitioners have stated a plausible claim for relief \n26\nunder Count One. \n27\n \n28\n-13- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 14 of 18   Page ID #:852\n \n  Defendants alternatively argue that Petitioners’ claim under Count One is \n1\npremature as to the putative 90-Day Class.  (Mot. at 16–18.)  Petitioners’ proposed 90-\n2\nDay Class consists of pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have been detained for more \n3\nthan 90 days after receiving a final order of removal.  Defendants argue that post-removal \n4\norder noncitizens cannot bring a Zadvydas claim challenging their detention until they \n5\nhave been detained for the presumptively reasonable six-month period.  Until then, \n6\nDefendants argue, the 90-Day Class’ claim is unripe.   \n7\n \n8\n  The issue of whether noncitizens can challenge their detention under section \n9\n1231(a)(6) before the six-month period passes appears to be an open question in the \n10\nNinth Circuit.  In Zadvydas, the Supreme Court held that section 1231(a)(6) “implicitly \n11\nlimits an alien’s detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien’s \n12\nremoval.”  Id. at 689.  Recognizing the “difficult judgments” that would be left to the \n13\ndistrict court, the Supreme Court established a “presumptively reasonable period of \n14\ndetention” of six months.  Id. at 701.  Once an individual has been detained for six \n15\nmonths, constitutional concerns presumptively arise, and the Supreme Court’s burden-\n16\nshifting framework serves as a “guide [for] lower court determinations.”  Id. at 700–701.  \n17\nThe Supreme Court in Zadvydas did not explicitly preclude a noncitizen from challenging \n18\nhis detention prior to the end of the presumptively reasonable six-month period.   \n19\n \n20\n  Defendants argue that the Ninth Circuit’s holding in Khotesouvan v. Morones \n21\n“squarely” indicates that a Zadvydas claim is unripe before the six-month period.  (Mot. \n22\nat 16.)  In Khotesouvan, the Ninth Circuit considered Zadvydas claims by Vietnamese \n23\nand Laotian noncitizens who had been in post-removal order detention.  386 F.3d 1298, \n24\n1301 (9th Cir. 2004).  At issue was whether the Government could continue to detain \n25\npost-removal order petitioners who had been in custody for less than 90 days, but whose \n26\nremoval the Government conceded was not reasonably foreseeable.  Id. at 1299.  The \n27\n28\n-14- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 15 of 18   Page ID #:853\n \nNinth Circuit held that the petitioners could not raise a due process claim challenging \n1\ntheir detention under Zadvydas “until at least 90 days of detention have passed.”  Id.  \n2\n \n3\n  Defendants have failed to show how Zadvydas or Khotesouvan close the door on \n4\nPetitioners’ claim as to the putative 90-Day Class.  The six-month Zadvydas presumption \n5\nis “just that—a presumption.”  Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 387 (2005) (O’Connor, \n6\nJ., concurring).  The Supreme Court in Zadvydas outlined a “guide” for approaching \n7\nthese detention challenges, 533 U.S. at 700–701, not a prohibition on claims challenging \n8\ndetention less than six months.  Further, the petitioners in Khotesouvan were being \n9\ndetained pursuant to a notably different provision of section 1231.  In Khotesouvan, the \n10\npetitioners were still within the statutory 90-day removal period under section 1231(a)(2), \n11\nduring which the Government “shall detain the alien.”  See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(2) \n12\n(emphasis added).  The 90-Day Class proposed here consists of individuals detained for \n13\nmore than 90 days pursuant to section 1231(a)(6), under which the Supreme Court found \n14\nthe discretionary “may” language posed a risk of indefinite detention.  Zadvydas, 533 \n15\nU.S. at 697.  In holding that a noncitizen could not challenge their detention “until at least \n16\n90 days of detention have passed,” the Ninth Circuit in Khotesouvan left open the 90-Day \n17\nClass Members’ claim challenging detention greater than 90 days.  Petitioners have stated \n18\na plausible claim for relief as to the 90-Day Class for the reasons already addressed in the \n19\ndiscussion of Count One above.  \n20\n  \n21\n2.  Count Two: Individualized Bond Hearing \n22\n \n23\nIn Count Two, Petitioners claim that even if removal is reasonably foreseeable, \n24\ndetention for more than six months violates section 1231 and constitutional due process \n25\nwhere it is “without any individualized determination that [the noncitizens] pose a danger \n26\nor flight risk.”  (Id. ¶¶ 72–75.)  Petitioners assert this claim on behalf of the members of \n27\nthe Prolonged Detention Class, i.e., all pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have been \n28\n-15- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 16 of 18   Page ID #:854\n \nor will be detained by ICE for more than 180 days without a bond hearing.  Defendants \n1\nmove to dismiss Count Two for failure to state a claim on the grounds that it is not \n2\nsupported by statute and conflicts with Supreme Court authority.  (Mot. at 18–23.)   \n3\n \n4\nPetitioners do not assert that the text of section 1231(a)(6) itself provides for \n5\nindividualized bond hearings.  Rather, Petitioners assert that noncitizens facing prolonged \n6\ndetention under section 1231 are entitled to an individualized bond hearing based on \n7\nNinth Circuit authority in Diouf v. Napolitano.  In that case, the Ninth Circuit held that \n8\nprolonged detention under section 1231(a)(6) raises “serious constitutional concerns” \n9\nwhere it occurs “without adequate procedural protections.”  634 F.3d 1081, 1085–86 (9th \n10\nCir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted).  The court concluded that a noncitizen facing \n11\nprolonged detention under § 1231(a)(6) therefore “is entitled to a bond hearing before an \n12\nimmigration judge.”  Id.  “[U]nless the government establishes that the alien poses a risk \n13\nof flight or a danger to the community,” the noncitizen is entitled to release from \n14\ndetention.  Id.   \n15\n \n16\nDefendants dispute the reach of the Ninth Circuit’s holding in Diouf and argue it \n17\nhas been “effectively overruled by” and is “clearly irreconcilable” with Supreme Court \n18\nauthority in Jennings v. Rodriquez.  (Mot. at 20.)  In Jennings, the Supreme Court held \n19\nthat three pre-removal order detention statutes not at issue in this litigation—8 U.S.C. §§ \n20\n1225(b), 1226(a), 1226(c)—cannot be construed to require bond hearings.  138 S. Ct. \n21\n830, 848–51 (2018).   Defendants argue that in light of Jennings, the Ninth Circuit in \n22\nDiouf “did not plausibly interpret the statutory text” of section 1231(a)(6).  (Mot. at 20.)  \n23\nDefendants claim that because Diouf applied Ninth Circuit precedent that was overturned \n24\nin Jennings, Jennings and Diouf are irreconcilable.  (Id. at 21.)   \n25\n \n26\nThe outcome in Jennings does not foreclose Petitioners’ claim here.  First, the \n27\nSupreme Court in Jennings expressly stated that section 1231(a)(6) “differs materially” \n28\n-16- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 66   Filed 09/06/18   Page 17 of 18   Page ID #:855\n \nfrom the three statutes at issue in that case.  138 S. Ct. at 833.  Unlike the other detention \n1\nstatutes, section 1231(a)(6) could plausibly be read to contain an “implicit time limit” and \n2\nemployed discretionary language that justified application of the constitutional avoidance \n3\ndoctrine.  Id. at 843–44 (citing Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 683).  Further, at least nine district \n4\ncourts in the Ninth Circuit have held that Diouf remains good law post-Jennings.4  This \n5\nCourt can disregard Diouf only if it is “clearly irreconcilable” with Jennings—a “high \n6\nstandard.”  See United States v. Robertson, 875 F.3d 1281, 1291 (9th Cir. 2017).  In light \n7\nof the Supreme Court’s express distinguishing of section 1231(a)(6) and the authority in \n8\nthis Circuit to the contrary, Defendants have failed to meet that high standard here.  \n9\n \n10\nPetitioners also assert that they are entitled to bond hearings under the Due Process \n11\nClause.  (Opp. at 18.)  Detention must be accompanied by “adequate procedural \n12\nprotections” to ensure that the Government’s asserted interest “outweighs the individual’s \n13\nconstitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.”  Zadvydas, 633 U.S. at \n14\n690.  Defendants argue that under Zadvydas, post-removal order detention does not raise \n15\na due process violation until the petitioner shows he is not significantly likely to be \n16\nremoved in the reasonably foreseeable future.  (Opp. at 18.)  Defendants argue that \n17\nbecause Petitioners have not made that showing here, their detention cannot raise a \n18\nconstitutional problem under Zadvydas.  (Id.)  However, as noted, Petitioners have \n19\nalleged sufficient facts to state a claim that their removal is not reasonably foreseeable in \n20\nthe future.  Petitioners have alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for individualized \n21\nbond hearings under Count Two. \n22\n23\n24                                                            \n4 See Ramos v.

Standish regarding in camera documents reviewed by the\nCourt. The narrow issue before the Court is whether certain\nredactions applied by Respondent to twenty-five documents,\nwhich the Court reviewed in camera, are proper. Specifically,\nPetitioners challenge whether, in asserting the deliberative\nprocess privilege as to these documents (in whole or in part),\nRespondents fulfilled their obligation to produce reasonably\nseverable factual material. See F.T.C. v. Warner Commc'ns Inc.,\n742 F.2d 1156, 1161 (9th Cir. 1984).

(Dkt. 22.)  For the following reasons, the motion is \n2\nDENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.1\n3  \n \n4\n  Petitioners are citizens of Vietnam who immigrated to the United States before \n5\n1995.  Petitioners are subject to orders of removal to Vietnam based on criminal \n6\nconvictions, and were recently placed in immigration detention pursuant to those removal \n7\norders.  On February 22, 2018, four named Petitioners, Hoang Trinh, Vu Ha, Long \n8\nNguyen, and Ngoc Hoang, initiated this habeas class action petition.  (Dkt. 1.)  \n9\nPetitioners alleged that their continued detention was unlawful because Vietnamese \n10\nnationals who immigrated before 1995 are protected from removal proceedings under an \n11\nagreement between the United States and Vietnam.  (See generally id.)   \n12\n \n13\n  On April 25, 2018, Petitioners filed their motion for a preliminary injunction and \n14\nfor provisional class certification.  (Dkt. 22.)  On April 30, 2018, Respondents filed a \n15\nmotion to dismiss.  (Dkt. 24.)  Respondents explained that all four Petitioners named in \n16\nthe habeas petition have since been released from immigration detention, so their claims \n17\nwere moot.  (Id.)  In response, Petitioners filed a First Amended Habeas Petition and \n18\nComplaint on May 11, 2018.  (Dkt. 27.)  In their amended pleading, Petitioners allege \n19\nthat the original four named Petitioners have been released from detention.  (Id. ¶¶ 11–\n20\n14.)  But the amended pleading adds three named Petitioners, Sieu Nguyen, Dai Diep, \n21\nand Boa Duong, who are currently in detention.  (Id. ¶¶ 15–17.)   \n22\n \n23\n// \n24\n// \n25\n26\n                                                           \n27\n1  Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate \n28 for disposition without a hearing.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15.  Accordingly, the hearing set \nfor June 11, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. is hereby vacated and off calendar. \n-2- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 40   Filed 05/23/18   Page 3 of 3   Page ID #:484\n \n  On May 14, 2018, Respondents withdrew their motion to dismiss in light of \n1\nPetitioners’ amended petition.  (Dkt. 28.)  Respondents now contend that Petitioners’ \n2\nmotion for a preliminary injunction and provisional class certification should be denied \n3\nbecause it is based on the original habeas petition.  (Dkt. 37 at 10–12.)  The Court agrees \n4\nwith Respondents.  \n5\n \n6\n  In order to warrant a grant of injunctive relief, Petitioners must show a relationship \n7\nbetween “the injury claimed in the motion for injunctive relief and the conduct asserted in \n8\nthe underlying complaint.”  Pac. Radiation Oncology, LLC v. Queen’s Med. Ctr., 810 \n9\nF.3d 631, 636 (9th Cir. 2015).  Petitioners’ motion is based on conduct and claims \n10\nasserted in their original petition with respect to the original four named Petitioners and \n11\ntheir continued detention.  But Petitioners have since amended their petition indicating \n12\nthat the original four Petitioners have been released from custody.  Petitioners’ motion is \n13\ntherefore based on claims that no longer have legal effect.  Doe v. Unocal Corp., 27 F. \n14\nSupp. 2d 1174, 1180 (C.D. Cal. 1998), aff’d and adopted, 248 F.3d 915 (9th Cir. 2001) \n15\n(“It is hornbook law that an amended pleading supersedes the original, the latter being \n16\ntreated thereafter as non-existent.  Once amended, the original no longer performs any \n17\nfunction as a pleading.”) (citations and quotations omitted).  Without a nexus between \n18\noperative claims and the injury claimed in a motion for injunctive relief, the Court may \n19\nnot grant the requested injunctive relief.  Pac. Radiation Oncology, LLC, 810 F.3d at 636. \n20\n \n21\n \n22\n  DATED:  May 23, 2018 \n23\n              __________________________________ \n24\n                CORMAC J.

INTRODUCTION \n25\n \n26   This putative class action challenges the Government’s practice of subjecting \n27 Vietnamese immigrants to post-removal order detention despite the remote possibility of \n28 their removal to Vietnam.  (Dkt. 27 [First Amended Habeas Corpus Petition and Class \n-1- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 2 of 20   Page ID #:940\n \nAction Complaint, hereinafter “FAC”] ¶¶ 1–4.)  The named Petitioners assert that they, \n1\nalong with thousands of other Vietnamese refugees who immigrated to the United States \n2\nbefore July 12, 1995 (“pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants”), have been or will be \n3\nsubjected to this practice.   \n4\n \n5\nPetitioners bring two causes of action for habeas relief, declaratory relief, and \n6\ninjunctive relief.  (Id. ¶ 76.)  In Count One, Petitioners assert that their post-removal \n7\norder detention violates federal immigration law, 8 U.S.C. § 1231, and constitutional due \n8\nprocess where removal is not likely to occur in the foreseeable future.  (Id. ¶¶ 64–70.)  In \n9\nCount Two, Petitioners assert that even where removal is reasonably foreseeable, their \n10\nprolonged detention violates section 1231 and constitutional due process when it is \n11\n“without any individualized determination that they pose a danger or flight risk.”  (Id. ¶¶ \n12\n72–75.)   \n13\n \n14\nPetitioners now seek to certify three putative classes of pre-1995 Vietnamese \n15\nimmigrants who, like them, received removal orders, faced varying periods of \n16\nimmigration detention, and either remain detained or face redetention by the \n17\nGovernment.  (Dkt. 65 [Mot. for Class Cert., hereinafter “Mot.”].)  Petitioners’ three \n18\nputative classes consist of (1) all pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have been or will \n19\nbe detained by ICE for more than 90 days after receiving removal orders (“90-Day \n20\nClass”), (2) all pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have been or will be detained by \n21\nICE for more than 180 days after receiving removal orders (“180-Day Class”), and (3) all \n22\npre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have been or will be detained by ICE for more \n23\nthan 180 days in total without a bond hearing (“Prolonged Detention Class”).  (FAC ¶ \n24\n59.)  For the following reasons, Petitioners’ motion for class certification is GRANTED \n25\nIN PART and DENIED IN PART. \n26\n \n27\n// \n28\n-2- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 3 of 20   Page ID #:941\n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n1\n \n2\n  After the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese government established the current \n3\nSocialist Republic of Vietnam.  (Dkt. 22-12 [Declaration of Tu-Huong Nguyen-Vo, \n4\nhereinafter “Nguyen-Vo Decl.”] ¶ 7.)  Beginning in 1975, waves of Vietnamese refugees \n5\nfled persecution and imprisonment by the new socialist regime.  (Id.)  Under various \n6\nhumanitarian programs, the United States accepted hundreds of thousands of these \n7\nrefugees, including Petitioners.  (Id. ¶ 13.)   \n8\n \n9\n  Petitioners are Vietnamese citizens who immigrated to the United States prior to \n10\nJuly 12, 1995.  (FAC ¶ 1.)  They became lawful permanent residents years ago but, based \n11\non criminal convictions, lost their green cards and were ordered removed.  (Id. ¶ 2.)  \n12\nAfter facing varying periods of post-removal order detention, they have been released \n13\nunder orders of supervision that require them to regularly report to U.S. Immigration and \n14\nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) offices.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 241.5(a).  \n15\nMany have gone on to live productive lives, supporting and caring for dependent family \n16\nmembers who are U.S. citizens.  (See e.g., Dkt. 22-13 [Declaration of Ngoc Hoang, \n17\nhereinafter “N. Hoang Decl.”] ¶¶ 8, 15, 18; Dkt. 22-7 [Declaration of Long Nguyen, \n18\nhereinafter “L. Nguyen Decl.”] ¶ 3; Dkt. 65-3 [Declaration of Dai Diep, hereinafter “Diep \n19\nDecl.”] ¶ 16.)   \n20\n \n21\n  Petitioners allege that until recently, the Government had a longstanding practice \n22\nof detaining pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants subject to removal orders for no longer \n23\nthan 90 days.  (FAC ¶ 3.)  This practice was purportedly implemented pursuant to a 2008 \n24\ndiplomatic agreement (“Agreement”) between the United States and Vietnam that \n25\nprovides that “Vietnamese citizens are not subject to return to Vietnam under this \n26\nAgreement if they arrived in the United States before July 12, 1995.”  (Id. ¶¶ 2, 36; id. \n27\n28\n-3- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 4 of 20   Page ID #:942\n \nEx. A, Art. 2, ¶ 2.)1  Under Supreme Court authority in Zadvydas v. Davis, post-removal \n1\norder detention triggers constitutional due process concerns where the immigrant’s \n2\nremoval is not significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future.  533 U.S. 678, \n3\n701 (2001).  Petitioners allege that because the Agreement rendered pre-1995 Vietnamese \n4\nimmigrants’ removal unlikely, the Government did not detain these individuals long \n5\nenough to implicate the protections in Zadvydas.   \n6\n \n7\n  In 2017, however, the Government departed from this longstanding practice and \n8\nbegan subjecting pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants to periods of detention exceeding 90 \n9\ndays.  (FAC ¶ 4.)  The Government initially contended that this shift in practices was the \n10\nresult of a mid-2017 “understanding” with Vietnamese government officials.  (Dkt. 56 \n11\n[Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss Pets.’ FAC] at 14.)  Under that understanding, Vietnam had \n12\nbegun to consider requests for travel documents for pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants, \n13\ndespite the 2008 Agreement.  (Dkt. 56-1 [Second Declaration of Michael Bernacke, \n14\nhereinafter “Bernacke Decl. II.”] ¶ 2.)  Accordingly, the Government claimed that \n15\nPetitioners could not show that their removal to Vietnam was not significantly likely in \n16\nthe reasonably foreseeable future.   \n17\n \n18\n  Now, months later, the Government reverses its position.  The Government \n19\ncontends that it has reached another new understanding with Vietnamese government \n20\nofficials under which the removal of pre-1995 Vietnamese is not reasonably foreseeable, \n21\nconsistent with Petitioners’ contention from the outset.  (Dkt. 67 [Govt.’s Opp. to Pets.’ \n22\nMot. for Class Cert., hereinafter “Opp.”].)  This second understanding purportedly \n23\noccurred the week of August 6—a month before the Court’s Order denying the \n24\nGovernment’s motion to dismiss.  (Opp. at 1; see Dkt. 66.)  However, the Government \n25\n26\n                                                           \n1 The Agreement states it will be valid for five years and extended automatically for successive three-\n27\nyear terms thereafter, unless written notice not to extend is given by either country.  (FAC Ex. A, Art. \n28 6.)  The Petitioners allege and the Government does not contest that the Agreement has not been \nterminated or modified by either country.  (FAC ¶ 35.) \n-4- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 5 of 20   Page ID #:943\n \ndid not disclose this information until September 17, in its opposition to the instant \n1\nmotion.  Under this second understanding, the Government “no longer believes that \n2\nVietnamese nationals who immigrated to the United States before July 12, 1995 . . . are \n3\nsignificantly likely to be removed to Vietnam in the reasonably foreseeable future.”  (Id.)  \n4\nBecause removal to Vietnam is not reasonably foreseeable, the Government claims that it \n5\nhas begun releasing all pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants on orders of supervision.  (Id.; \n6\nDkt. 67-1 [Fourth Declaration of Michael Bernacke, hereinafter “Bernacke Decl. IV”] ¶ \n7\n2.)   \n8\n \n9\n  Setting aside the dynamic state of United States-Vietnam immigration relations, \n10\nthe Government’s data shows that Vietnam has consistently refused travel document \n11\nrequests for pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants.  From February 22, 2018 to July 28, 2018, \n12\nICE detained at least 105 pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants for more than 90 days post-\n13\nremoval order, 64 for more than 180 days post-removal order, and 116 for more than 180 \n14\n15 days in total.  (Dkt. 65-4 [Declaration of Jingni Zhao, hereinafter “Zhao Decl.”] ¶ 5; id. \nEx. A.)  As of July 28, 2018, at least 55 pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants were still in \n16\ncustody.  30 of those immigrants had been detained for more than 90 days post-removal \n17\norder and 12 had been detained for more than 180 days post-removal order.  (Id. ¶ 4; id. \n18\nEx. A.)  The Government submitted 86 travel document requests to Vietnam for these \n19\nindividuals.  All but one have been denied or remain unanswered.  (Id. ¶ 7; id. Ex. B.)  \n20\nThe one pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrant who received a travel document received the \n21\ndocument approximately three months ago, yet is still in detention.  (Id. Ex. C.)  At the \n22\nhearing on October 15, 2018, the Government disclosed that 28 pre-1995 Vietnamese \n23\nimmigrants are currently in detention, 4 of whom have been detained for more than 90 \n24\ndays post-removal order.  Although many Petitioners have been released from custody, \n25\nthe Government has explicitly reserved the right to redetain them.  (Bernacke Decl. IV ¶ \n26\n3.)  \n27\n \n28\n-5- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 6 of 20   Page ID #:944\n \nIII.  ANALYSIS \n1\n \n2\n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, district courts have broad discretion to \n3\ndetermine whether a class should be certified.  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 871 \n4\nn.28 (9th Cir. 2001).  Rule 23 is not merely a pleading standard—a party seeking class \n5\ncertification must affirmatively demonstrate compliance with the Rule by proving the \n6\nrequirements in fact.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  Rule \n7\n23(a) provides that a case is appropriate for certification as a class action if: “(1) the class \n8\nis so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law \n9\nor fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are \n10\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly \n11\nand adequately protect the interests of the class.”  These four requirements are often \n12\nreferred to as numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy.  See Gen. Tel. Co. of \n13\nSw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982).   \n14\n \n15\n  Rule 23(b) defines different types of classes.  Leyva v. Medline Indus. Inc., 716 \n16\nF.3d 510, 512 (9th Cir. 2012).  In this case, Petitioners seek certification pursuant to Rule \n17\n23(b)(2).  (Mot. at 2.)  Rule 23(b)(2) permits certification if “the party opposing the class \n18\nhas acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \n19\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as \n20\na whole.”  Petitioners bear the burden of satisfying the elements of Rules 23(a) and \n21\n22 23(b)(2) for each of their three proposed classes.  See Zinser v. Accufix Research Inst., \n23 Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001).   \n24  \n25  \n26  \n27  \n28 // \n-6- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 7 of 20   Page ID #:945\n \nA. Rule 23(a) \n1\n2  \n3   Under Rule 23(a), Petitioners must meet the four requirements of commonality, \n4 typicality, numerosity, and adequacy.  The Court considers each requirement in turn. \n5  \n6 1.  Commonality \n \n7\nUnder Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement, there must be “questions of law \n8\nor fact common to the class.”  Petitioners must “demonstrate that the class members \n9\n‘have suffered the same injury,’” not “merely that they have all suffered a violation of the \n10\nsame provision of law.”  Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 350 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co., 457 \n11\nU.S. at 157).  Petitioners’ claim must depend on a “common contention” that is “capable \n12\nof classwide resolution.”  Id.  This means “that determination of its truth or falsity will \n13\nresolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Id.   \n14\n \n15\n  Petitioners move to certify their putative 90-Day and 180-Day Classes as to Count \n16\nOne.  In Count One, Petitioners assert that their post-removal order detention violates \n17\nfederal immigration law, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6), and constitutional due process where \n18\ntheir removal is not significantly likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future.  \n19\n(FAC ¶¶ 64–70.)  Section 1231 provides that after an alien is ordered removed, the \n20\nGovernment “shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days.”  \n21\n8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(A).  During the 90-day removal period, the Government “shall \n22\ndetain the alien.”  Id. § 1231(a)(2).  Once the 90-day removal period ends, the \n23\nGovernment may continue to detain certain noncitizens, such as Petitioners, whose \n24\ncriminal convictions render them removable.  Id. § 1231(a)(6).  Section 1231(a)(6) does \n25\nnot, however, authorize the Government to detain a noncitizen indefinitely.  Zadvydas, \n26\n533 U.S. at 688–702.  Rather, the statute, “read in light of the Constitution’s demands, \n27\nlimits an alien’s post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring \n28\n-7- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 8 of 20   Page ID #:946\n \nabout the alien’s removal.”  Id. at 689.  Recognizing the “difficult judgments” that would \n1\nbe left to a district court, the Supreme Court held that six months is a “presumptively” \n2\nreasonable period of detention.  Id. at 701.  If after six months, the noncitizen provides \n3\n“good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the \n4\nreasonably foreseeable future,” the Government “must respond with evidence sufficient \n5\nto rebut that showing.”  Id.  If the Government fails to do so, it cannot subject the \n6\nnoncitizen to continued detention.  See id. \n7\n \n8\nPetitioners’ 90-Day and 180-Day Class claims present common questions that will \n9\n“resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  \n10\nSee Walmart Stores, 564 U.S. at 350.  The resolution of Petitioners’ claim as to the 90-\n11\nDay Class presents at least one common question: whether the class members may bring \n12\na Zadvydas claim after the 90-day removal period but before the presumptively \n13\nreasonable six-month period.  (Mot. at 16.)  Petitioners seek a uniform declaration that \n14\nthe 90-Day Class has overcome Zadvydas’ “six-month presumption of reasonableness,” \n15\nshifting the burden to the Government to show that the putative members’ removal is \n16\nreasonably foreseeable.  (Id. at 24; Dkt. 71 [Pets.’ Reply, hereinafter “Reply”] at 10.)  As \n17\nthis Court stated in denying the Government’s motion to dismiss, whether a noncitizen \n18\ncan challenge post-removal order detention under Zadvydas prior to the six-month period \n19\nappears to be an open question in the Ninth Circuit.  (Dkt. 66 at 14.)  Answering that \n20\nquestion, among others, will determine whether Petitioners’ claim as to the putative 90-\n21\nDay Class can proceed.   \n22\n \n23\nPetitioners’ claim as to the 180-Day Class likewise presents at least one common \n24\nquestion: whether the 2008 Agreement and “Vietnam’s historical practice” of refusing \n25\nrepatriation of pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants allows Petitioners to satisfy their initial \n26\nburden under Zadvydas.  (Mot. at 14–15.)  If this question is answered in the affirmative, \n27\nthe burden under Zadvydas would shift to the Government to provide evidence that the \n28\n-8- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 9 of 20   Page ID #:947\n \nputative class members’ removal is reasonably foreseeable.  See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at \n1\n701.  The fact that the Government now concedes that Vietnam will not accept pre-1995 \n2\nVietnamese immigrants does not render this question moot.  Many of the pre-1995 \n3\nVietnamese immigrants remain in detention, and those already released can be redetained \n4\nat any time.  Indeed, the Government has explicitly reserved its right to redetain these \n5\nindividuals.  (See Bernacke Decl. IV ¶ 3.)   \n6\n \n7\n  Petitioners move to certify their putative Prolonged Detention Class as to Count \n8\nTwo.  In Count Two, Petitioners claim that even if their removal is reasonably \n9\nforeseeable, detention for more than six months violates section 1231 and constitutional \n10\ndue process where it is “without any individualized determination that [the noncitizens] \n11\npose a danger or flight risk.”  (FAC ¶¶ 72–75.)  Petitioners’ Prolonged Detention Class \n12\nincludes individuals who have been or will be detained for more than 180 days in total, \n13\n“including days in detention both before and after a final removal order.”  (Mot. at 8, 10.)  \n14\nAccordingly, if a pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrant was detained for 180 days under 8 \n15\nU.S.C. § 1226 (pre-removal order detention statute) and only one day under 8 U.S.C. § \n16\n1231 (post-removal order detention statute), the individual would fall into the proposed \n17\nclass.   \n18\n \n19\nPetitioners assert that noncitizens facing prolonged detention under section 1231 \n20\nare entitled to an individualized bond hearing based on Ninth Circuit authority in Diouf v. \n21\nNapolitano.  In that case, the court held that prolonged detention under section 1231(a)(6) \n22\nraises “serious constitutional concerns” where it occurs “without adequate procedural \n23\nprotections.”  634 F.3d 1081, 1085–86 (9th Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted).  The \n24\ncourt concluded that a noncitizen facing prolonged detention under section 1231(a)(6) \n25\ntherefore “is entitled to a bond hearing before an immigration judge.”  Id.  “[U]nless the \n26\ngovernment establishes that the alien poses a risk of flight or a danger to the community,” \n27\nthe noncitizen is entitled to release from detention.  Id.  In its motion to dismiss \n28\n-9- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 10 of 20   Page ID #:948\n \nPetitioners’ FAC, the Government contended that Diouf was “effectively overruled by” \n1\nJennings v. Rodriguez.  (Dkt. 56 at 20.)  In Jennings, the Supreme Court held that three \n2\npre-removal order detention statutes cannot be construed to require bond hearings.  138 \n3\nS. Ct. 830, 848–51 (2018).  In light of Jennings, the Government argued, the Ninth \n4\nCircuit in Diouf did not “plausibly interpret the statutory text” of section 1231.  (Dkt. 56 \n5\nat 20.) \n6\n \n7\nThe Government claims that the differences between pre-removal order and post-\n8\nremoval order detention statutes “preclude” a finding that common answers can drive the \n9\nresolution of the Prolonged Detention Class’s claim.  (Opp. at 14.)  The Court disagrees.  \n10\nThe Government’s argument goes to the merits of Petitioners’ claim under Count Two, \n11\nnot to class certification.  Regardless of which party is correct, whether Petitioners’ \n12\nputative Prolonged Detention Class is entitled to a bond hearing presents a “common \n13\ncontention” that is “capable of classwide resolution.”  Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 350.  \n14\nBecause common answers will drive the resolution of Petitioners’ class claims, \n15\nPetitioners’ three proposed classes satisfy the commonality requirement under Rule \n16\n23(a). \n17\n \n18\n2.  Typicality \n19\n \n20\nUnder Rule 23(a)(3), the named Petitioners’ claims or defenses must be “typical of \n21\nthe claims or defenses of the class.”  “The test of typicality ‘is whether other members \n22\nhave the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not \n23\nunique to the named Petitioners, and whether other class members have been injured by \n24\nthe same course of conduct.’”  Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 984 (9th \n25\nCir. 2011) (quoting Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992)).   \n26\nTypicality aims to ensure that “the interest of the named representative aligns with the \n27\ninterests of the class.”  Hanon, 976 F.2d at 508.  “Under the rule’s permissive standards, \n28\n-10- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 11 of 20   Page ID #:949\n \nrepresentative claims are ‘typical’ if they are reasonably coextensive with those of absent \n1\nclass members; they need not be substantially identical.”  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 \n2\nF.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998). \n3\n \n4\nThe named Petitioners face a similar injury based on the same course of conduct—\n5\nthe Government’s detention policies regarding pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants.  \n6\nPetitioner Hoang Trinh (“Trinh”) seeks to represent the 180-Day Class and Prolonged \n7\nDetention Class.  (Mot. at 17.)  Trinh entered the United States with his family as a four-\n8\nyear-old refugee in 1980.  (FAC ¶ 11; Dkt. 22-9 [Declaration of Hoang Trinh, hereinafter \n9\n“Trinh Decl.”] ¶¶ 2–3.)  He worked in his family’s bakery while growing up and now \n10\nruns a Vietnamese sandwich shop with his wife.  (FAC ¶ 11; see Trinh Decl. ¶ 8; Mot. at \n11\n17.)  Trinh’s wife, two children, parents, and six sisters are all U.S. citizens.  (FAC ¶ 11.)  \n12\nHe was ordered removed following incarceration for alleged possession of a marijuana \n13\nplant.  (Id.)  Trinh was detained for more than 180 days following entry of a removal \n14\norder without a bond hearing.

Ha escaped Vietnam at the age of nine and entered the \n19\nUnited States as a ten-year-old refugee in 1990.  (FAC ¶ 12; Dkt. 22-16 [Declaration of \n20\nVu Ha, hereinafter “Ha Decl.”] ¶ 3.)  His parents, sister, and daughter are U.S. citizens.  \n21\n(FAC ¶ 12; Ha Decl. ¶ 4.)  He was arrested three times as a young adult between 2000 \n22\nand 2005, once being for robbery.  (FAC ¶ 12.)  In 2017, he was arrested and detained for \n23\nfailure to pay a citation for driving without a license.  (Id.)  He was transported from \n24\ncounty jail to ICE custody in May 2017 and was ordered removed on September 19, \n25\n2017.  (Id.)  He was detained for more than 90 days following entry of his removal order \n26\nand for more than 180 days in total without a bond hearing.  (Ha Decl. ¶¶ 12, 18; \n27\nBernacke Decl.

(Mot. at \n1\n18.)  Nguyen entered the United States as an eleven-year-old refugee in 1987.  (FAC ¶ \n2\n13.)  His wife, three step-daughters, and two-year-old daughter are all U.S. citizens.  (L. \n3\nNguyen Decl. ¶ 9.)  He and his wife work at a nail salon that his wife manages.  (FAC ¶ \n4\n13.)  In 2006, he was convicted of a nonviolent felony drug offense.  (Id.)  In 2010 or \n5\n2011, he was detained after traveling abroad and ordered removed on April 18, 2012.  \n6\n(Id.)  He was detained for more than 90 days after entry of his removal order.  (L. \n7\nNguyen Decl. ¶¶ 12, 16; Bernacke Decl. I ¶ 2.)    \n8\n \n9\nPetitioner Ngoc Hoang (“Hoang”) seeks to represent the 90-Day Class.  (Mot. at \n10\n18.)  Hoang entered the United States at age sixteen in 1990, after his father was jailed in \n11\na reeducation camp for having served in the South Vietnamese military.  (FAC ¶ 14; N. \n12\nHoang Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.)  Hoang was married to a U.S. citizen with whom he has four \n13\nchildren, all under the age of eighteen.  (FAC ¶ 14.)  Hoang now works as a nail salon \n14\ntechnician.  (Id.)  In 1994, he pled guilty to check fraud and in 2010, he was placed on \n15\nprobation for simple assault and simple battery.  (Id.)  He was ordered removed on \n16\nDecember 12, 2012 and released on an order of supervision approximately two months \n17\nlater.  (Id.)  Over the next five years, Hoang complied with the requirements of that order.  \n18\n(Id.)  But on November 6, 2017, he was unexpectedly re-arrested by ICE officers at his \n19\nhome.  (Id.)  Hoang was detained for more than 90 days after entry of his final removal \n20\norder.  (N. Hoang Decl. ¶¶ 12, 16; Bernacke Decl.

Sieu entered the United States at age three \n24\nin 1989.  (FAC ¶ 15; Dkt. 65-2 [Declaration of Sieu Nguyen, hereinafter Sieu Decl.] ¶ 2.)  \n25\nHis parents and seven siblings are all U.S. citizens.  (Sieu Decl. ¶ 3.)

(Id. ¶¶ 7, 10; Bernacke Decl. II ¶ 7.) \n2\n \n3\n  Petitioner Dai Dep (“Diep”) seeks to represent the 180-Day Class and Prolonged \n4\nDetention Class.  (Mot. at 19.)  Diep entered the United States as a refugee in 1995.  \n5\n(Diep Decl. ¶ 2.)  His mother, stepfather, and half-siblings are all U.S. citizens, as is his \n6\nbiological father, who worked for the U.S. Department of Defense during the Vietnam \n7\nWar.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  In November 2015, he pled guilty to second-degree robbery, second-\n8\ndegree burglary, and vandalism, for which he was sentenced to two years of \n9\nimprisonment.  (FAC ¶ 17.)  He was ordered removed on October 26, 2017, (id.), and \n10\nwas detained for more than 180 days without a bond hearing, (Diep Decl. ¶¶ 13, 15; \n11\nBernacke Decl. II ¶ 7). \n12\n \n13\nThe Government disputes Petitioners’ ability to satisfy the typicality requirement, \n14\nbut it offers no arguments on the issue.  (See Opp. at 6.)  Here, the named Petitioners \n15\nwere subjected to post-removal order detention for varying periods of time, despite the \n16\nremote possibility of their removal to Vietnam.  They now seek uniform relief from \n17\nfurther detention.  The named Petitioners’ interests thus “align[] with the interests of the \n18\nclass.”  See Hanon, 976 F.2d at 508.  Petitioners have satisfied their burden of showing \n19\ntypicality under 23(a)(3). \n20\n \n21\n3.  Numerosity & Adequacy \n22\n \n23\n24 The Government’s moving papers do not contest that Petitioners’ three putative \n25 classes are sufficiently numerous and that the named Petitioners will serve as \n26 adequate representatives.2  In any event, Petitioners satisfy both requirements here.  \n27\n                                                           \n2 See Opp. at 6 n.2 [“Respondents acknowledge that several thousand pre-1995 aliens live in the \n28\nUnited States.  Respondents thus concede that the proposed classes satisfy the numerosity \n-13- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 14 of 20   Page ID #:952\n \n1 Under Rule 23(a)(1), Petitioners must show that the “class is so numerous that joinder \n2 of all members is impracticable.”  According to the Government, in the five months \n3 after this action was filed, ICE detained at least 105 pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants \n4 for more than 90 days post-removal order, 64 for more than 180 days post-removal \n5 order, and 116 for more than 180 days in total.  (Zhao Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. A.)  While the \n6 size of Petitioners’ putative classes fluctuates, the numbers identified reflect a large \n7 pool of individuals who have been or will be impacted by the Government’s \n8 detention practices.  See Saravia v. Sessions, 280 F. Supp. 3d 1168, 1202–03 (N.D. Cal. \n2017) (finding numerosity satisfied based on 15 identified class members and the \n9\nlikelihood of future members). Further, other factors make joinder of the putative class \n10\nmembers impracticable.  These individuals are geographically dispersed and face \n11\nrestricted access to legal resources and high poverty rates.  Petitioners have met their \n12\nburden of showing that the putative classes are sufficiently numerous under Rule \n13\n23(a)(1).3   \n14\n \n15\nPetitioners have also shown that the named Petitioners “will fairly and adequately \n16\nrepresent the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Adequacy of representation \n17\nrequires that the named Petitioners (1) have no interests antagonistic to the interests of the \n18\nclass and (2) are represented by counsel that is capable of vigorously prosecuting their \n19\ninterests.  In re Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., 308 F.R.D. 606, 618 (N.D. Cal. \n20\n21\n                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n22 requirement.  Respondents also do not contest that, if the Court certified a class, Petitioners’ \nattorneys would fairly and adequately represent the class’s interests.”].    \n23\n3 The Government argued for the first time at the hearing on October 15, 2018 that Petitioners could not \n24 satisfy the numerosity requirement.  According to the Government’s new data, only 28 pre-1995 \nVietnamese immigrants are currently in detention, 4 of whom have been detained beyond the mandatory \n25 90-day removal period.  Because the Government is releasing pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants, it \nargues, Petitioners’ proposed classes are no longer sufficiently numerous.  This argument, however, \n26\nignores the parameters of Petitioners’ proposed classes.  Petitioners seek to certify classes of individuals \nwho have been or will be detained by ICE for more than 90 days where removal is not reasonably \n27\nforeseeable.  Petitioners’ classes, by their nature, are subject to fluctuation and potentially include \n28 individuals not currently in detention.  Although the Government has suddenly decided to release pre-\n1995 Vietnamese immigrants, it continues to explicitly reserve its right to redetain Petitioners.  \n-14- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 15 of 20   Page ID #:953\n \n2015).  Here, Petitioners satisfy both requirements.  There are no conflicts between the \n1\ninterests of the named Petitioners and those of the putative class members.  Named \n2\nPetitioners share with the putative class members an interest in minimizing detention and \n3\nprotecting their due process rights.  The named Petitioners have also retained counsel \n4\nwho are well qualified in immigrant rights and class-action litigation.  (See Dkts. 22-2 \n5\n[Declaration of Raymond Cardozo], 22-10 [Declaration of Phi Nguyen], 22-11 \n6\n[Declaration of Jingni Zhao].)  There is no indication that Petitioners’ counsel will not \n7\ncontinue to vigorously protect Petitioners’ interests.  Petitioners’ three putative classes \n8\nsatisfy the four requirements under Rule 23(a). \n9\n \n10\nB. Rule 23(b)(2) \n11\n \n12\nPetitioners seek certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).  Under Rule 23(b)(2), \n13\nPetitioners must show that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \n14\ngrounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n15\ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Rule 23(b)(2) “applies \n16\nonly when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each \n17\nmember of the class.”  Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 360.  “The rule does not require [the \n18\nCourt] to examine the viability or bases of class members’ claims for declaratory and \n19\ninjunctive relief, but only to look at whether class members seek uniform relief from a \n20\npractice applicable to all of them.”  Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1125 (9th Cir. \n21\n2010).  The Court considers each putative class in turn.   \n22\n \n23\nThe putative 90-Day Class members have faced uniform conduct capable of \n24\nuniform relief.  First, they have been subjected to the same allegedly unlawful conduct: \n25\npost-removal order detention for more than 90 days where removal to Vietnam is not \n26\nsignificantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future.  Further, they seek a uniform \n27\nremedy.  Petitioners seek declaratory relief stating that (1) the Class can challenge its \n28\n-15- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 16 of 20   Page ID #:954\n \ndetention under Zadvydas before the presumptively reasonable six-month period, and (2) \n1\nthat the Class has shown its removal is not significantly likely in the foreseeable future, \n2\nshifting the burden to the Government to demonstrate that removal is reasonably \n3\nforeseeable.  (Mot. at 23–24.)   \n4\n \n5\n The Government does not dispute that Petitioners’ proposed declaratory relief \n6\nwould provide relief to each member of the putative 90-Day Class.  Rather, they contend \n7\nthat if this Court granted that relief, it would contradict the holding in Zadvydas.  \n8\nZadvydas, the Government argues, “requires an alien to make an initial showing, based \n9\non current facts and circumstances, of ‘good reason to believe’ that his removal is not \n10\nreasonably foreseeable.”  (Opp. at 13 [emphasis in original].)  By issuing a classwide \n11\ndeclaration regarding the foreseeability of pre-1995 immigrants’ removal under \n12\nZadvydas, the Government contends that the Court would issue an improper “classwide, \n13\nper se predetermination that pre-1995 [Vietnamese immigrants] cannot be removed.”  \n14\n(Id. at 10.)  \n15\n   \n16\n  The Government mischaracterizes Petitioners’ proposed declaratory relief.  \n17\nPetitioners do not seek a “per se predetermination” that all pre-1995 Vietnamese \n18\nimmigrants cannot be removed.  Petitioners seek an order declaring that the removal of \n19\npre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants is not reasonably foreseeable based on the facts \n20\ncurrently before the Court.  If the Court declares that the current circumstances indicate \n21\n“good reason to believe” that pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants’ removal is not \n22\nsignificantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government would have the \n23\nopportunity to rebut that showing under Zadvydas.  In any event, the Government fails to \n24\nidentify any individualized criteria that would definitively make removal more or less \n25\nforeseeable for a pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrant.  To date, they have addressed the \n26\nputative class members’ likelihood of removal on a groupwide basis.  Initially they \n27\nargued that classwide relief was inappropriate because pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants \n28\n-16- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 17 of 20   Page ID #:955\n \ncould be removed under a new verbal understanding with Vietnam.  Now they claim \n1\nclasswide relief is inappropriate because pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants definitively \n2\ncannot be removed under another new understanding.  Whether or not Petitioners will \n3\nultimately prevail on the merits, the adjudication of their request would provide or deny \n4\n“uniform relief from a practice applicable to all of” the putative 90-Day Class members.  \n5\nSee Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at 1125.  The Court grants certification of the 90-Day Class as to \n6\nthe isolated issues of whether the Class has overcome the six-month presumption of \n7\nreasonableness and met its burden under Zadvydas.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) (“When \n8\nappropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to \n9\nparticular issues.”)   \n10\n \n11\nOn behalf of the 180-Day Class, Petitioners seek injunctive relief, or in the \n12\nalternative, declaratory relief.  Petitioners’ proposed injunctive relief enjoins the \n13\nGovernment from detaining pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants for more than 180 days \n14\n“absent proof that Vietnam has agreed to repatriate” them.  (Mot. at 8, 21; Reply at 4, 7.)  \n15\nIn the alternative, Petitioners ask this Court to declare that the 180-Day Class members, \n16\nlike the 90-Day Class members, have met their initial burden under Zadvydas by showing \n17\nthat their removal is not significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future.  (Mot. at \n18\n23.) \n19\n \n20\n  Petitioners’ proposed injunctive relief contradicts Zadvydas and intrudes on \n21\nlegislative and executive branch authority.  Under Zadvydas, Petitioners can challenge \n22\ntheir detention where they show their removal is not significantly likely in the reasonably \n23\nforeseeable future.  Petitioners’ injunctive relief, however, asks this Court to prevent the \n24\nGovernment from detaining pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants unless the Government \n25\nmakes an evidentiary showing that Vietnam has agreed to repatriate them.  The Supreme \n26\nCourt in Zadvydas did not imbue the courts with such expansive authority to interfere \n27\nwith the Government’s ability to effectuate federal immigration law.  Indeed, the \n28\n-17- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 18 of 20   Page ID #:956\n \nSupreme Court explicitly counseled against such an intrusion.  See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at \n1\n659 (recognizing that the “Judicial Branch must defer to Executive and Legislative \n2\nBranch decisionmaking” in immigration law); id. at 700 (stating that a court’s review in \n3\nthese cases “must take appropriate account of the greater immigration-related expertise of \n4\nthe Executive Branch”).  The Supreme Court was careful to acknowledge that the courts \n5\nhave no authority to “deny the right of Congress to remove aliens, to subject them to \n6\nsupervision with conditions when released from detention, or to incarcerate them where \n7\nappropriate for violations of those conditions.”  Id. at 659.  The Supreme Court simply \n8\naddressed the issue of “whether aliens that the Government finds itself unable to remove \n9\nare to be condemned to an indefinite term of imprisonment within the United States.”  Id.  \n10\nUnder Zadvydas, Petitioners may challenge that “indefinite . . . imprisonment” once it \n11\noccurs.    \n12\n \n13\nIn the alternative, Petitioners seek declaratory relief that mirrors the relief sought \n14\non behalf of the 90-Day Class.  Specifically, they ask this Court to declare that the 180-\n15\nDay Class members have met their burden under Zadvydas to show “good reason to \n16\nbelieve that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable \n17\nfuture.”  533 U.S. at 701.  Unlike Petitioners’ proposed injunctive relief, this declaratory \n18\nrelief can be issued on a classwide basis without categorically preventing the Government \n19\nfrom redetaining pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants.4  At 180 days of post-removal order \n20\ndetention, the Government could continue detaining a pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrant if \n21\nVietnam issued a travel document or otherwise agreed to repatriation.  Petitioners have \n22\nmet their burden of showing that the putative 180-Day Class members have faced \n23\nuniform conduct addressable by uniform declaratory relief under Rule 23(b)(2). \n24\n25                                                            \n4 The Government contends that Supreme Court authority in Jama v. ICE counsels against imposing \n26\n“improper restriction[s] on the Government’s authority to remove post-order aliens.”  (Opp. at 10 [citing \nJama v. ICE, 543 U.S. 335, 344 (2005)].)  However, that case was not about the Government’s detention \n27\nauthority.  The issue was whether ICE was authorized to remove noncitizens to Somalia, which lacked a \n28 functioning government to provide advance consent.  Here, Petitioners’ proposed relief does not \ninterfere with noncitizens’ removal.  It concerns prolonged detention where their removal is unlikely. \n-18- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 19 of 20   Page ID #:957\n \nThe Government contends that declaratory relief, without injunctive relief, is \n1\nmeaningless.  At the hearing, counsel for the Government argued that because any \n2\ndeclaratory relief stating that the class members’ removal is not reasonably foreseeable \n3\nunder Zadvydas would be limited to the facts and circumstances currently before the \n4\nCourt, that relief would not have any weight if the circumstances affecting their removal \n5\nchange.  Although declaratory relief on behalf of the 90-Day and 180-Day Classes would \n6\nbe limited in its reach, it is not without teeth.  Declaratory relief stating that the class \n7\nmembers have met their initial burden under Zadvydas would allow them to challenge \n8\nmore easily on an individual or perhaps collective basis the constitutionality of further \n9\ndetention when Vietnam continues to refuse their repatriation.  The Court recognizes that \n10\nit cannot interfere with the Government’s authority to detain individuals pursuant to \n11\nfederal immigration law, but it can and must intervene where detention deprives \n12\nindividuals of their constitutional rights.  Although the Government now has conceded \n13\nthat class members’ removal to Vietnam is not likely in the reasonably foreseeable future, \n14\nthe Government has not conceded that it violated these individuals’ constitutional rights \n15\nwhen it detained them with the knowledge that they could not and would not be removed \n16\nto Vietnam.  And more importantly, many of the class members still remain in detention, \n17\nand the Government has explicitly reserved its right to redetain all of those it has recently \n18\nreleased.  Contrary to the Government’s assertion, the proposed declaratory relief is not \n19\nmeaningless.    \n20\n \n21\nFinally, Petitioners have also shown that the putative Prolonged Detention Class \n22\nmembers have faced uniform conduct capable of uniform relief.  On behalf of the \n23\nProlonged Detention Class, Petitioners seek individualized bond hearings for pre-1995 \n24\nVietnamese immigrants who have been or will be detained for more than 180 days in \n25\ntotal.  The putative class members have been subjected to a uniform practice: detention \n26\nfor more than 180 days in total without a bond hearing.  The requested relief—bond \n27\nhearings—would “provide relief to each member of the class.”  See Wal-Mart Stores, 564 \n28\n-19- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 75   Filed 10/18/18   Page 20 of 20   Page ID #:958\n \nU.S. at 360.  Courts in this Circuit have routinely employed Rule 23(b)(2) to certify \n1\nclaims involving the Government’s blanket refusal to conduct bond hearings.  See, e.g., \n2\nPreap v. Johnson, 303 F.R.D. 566, 571 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (holding that “the class action \n3\nmechanism easily and efficiently establishes the right of all class members to a bond \n4\nhearing”); Riviera v. Holder, 307 F.R.D. 539, 551 (W.D. Wash. 2015); Hernandez v. \n5\nLynch, 2016 WL 7116611, at *19 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 10, 2016), aff’d sub nom. Hernandez v. \n6\nSessions, 872 F.3d 976 (9th Cir. 2017).  Whether Petitioners’ 180-Day Class is entitled to \n7\nindividualized bond hearings here is a question for the merits.  Petitioners have satisfied \n8\ntheir burden of showing that the putative Prolonged Detention Class is appropriate for \n9\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2). \n10\n \n11\nIV.  CONCLUSION    \n12\n \n13\nFor the foregoing reasons, Petitioners’ motion for class certification is GRANTED \n14\nIN PART and DENIED IN PART.  The Court hereby designates Petitioners’ counsel as \n15\nclass counsel and appoints the named Petitioners as class representatives.   \n16\n \n17\n \n18\n \n19\n  DATED:  October 18, 2018 \n20\n              __________________________________ \n21\n                CORMAC J.

This  class  action  habeas  petition  and  complaint  for  declaratory  and \n3 injunctive relief is brought on behalf of Petitioners, who fled war-torn Vietnam, were \n4 accepted by the United States as refugees before July 12, 1995 and have resided in \n5 the United States since they were young children or teenagers. As a result of abrupt \n6 and unlawful actions by Respondents, Petitioners currently face unwarranted and \n7 indefinite immigration detention. \n8 2.  Petitioners  became  lawful  permanent  residents  of  this  country  many \n9 years ago but, based on criminal convictions, lost their green cards and were ordered \n10 removed from the United States. Although Petitioners have final orders of removal, \nware  11 they cannot be repatriated under the existing repatriation agreement between the \nDela\nLLP  n the State of  1123 UStnaitteesd a Sntda ttehse  aGndo vVerinetmnaemnt.  oSfe teh eA gSroeceimaleisntt  RBeeptuwbeleicn  othf eV Gieotnvaemrn monen tth oe fA thcec eUptnaintecde  \nTH med i\nED SMInership for 14 of  the  Return  of  Vietnamese  Citizens.1  The  agreement  does  not  allow  for  the \nREy part 15 repatriation of Vietnamese immigrants who came to the United States before July 12, \nmited liabilit 16 1995 (“pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants”), a population that is largely comprised of \nA li 17 refugees  who  fled  Vietnam  after  the  war  to  escape  persecution  under  the  new \n18 communist regime.   \n19 3.  United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) has had a \n20 longstanding practice of releasing pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants with final orders \n21 of removal due to legal constraints on their detention authority. Recognizing that pre-\n22 1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  are  “not  subject  to  return  to  Vietnam”  under  the \n23 repatriation agreement, ICE has typically released these immigrants on orders of \n24 supervision within 90 days of their removal orders becoming final. The repatriation \n25\n26                                                \n1 This agreement can be found on the U.S. Department of State’s website.  See \n27 Attachment A (Agreement Concerning the Acceptance of the Return of Vietnamese \nCitizens, U.S.- NAM., Jan. 22, 2008, 08 – 43, https://www.state.gov/documents/ \n28 organization/108921.pdf). \nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 1 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 4 of 26   Page ID #:386\n \n1\nagreement  has  thus  given  thousands  of  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  the \n2\nopportunity to return to their families and communities to rebuild their lives. \n3\n4.  In  2017,  ICE  abruptly  departed  from  past  enforcement  practices \n4\npertaining to pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants with final orders of removal. ICE \n5\nbegan subjecting pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants to much longer periods of post-\n6\nremoval order detention, in some cases as long as eleven months. ICE also began re-\n7\ndetaining  without  notice  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  all  across  the  United \n8\nStates who had been living peaceably in their communities on orders of supervision \n9\nfor years or decades. \n10\n5.  ICE’s  enforcement  tactics  have  sown  fear  in  Vietnamese  refugee \nware  11\nDela communities around the country. Immigrants from other countries that have also \nLLP  n the State of  1123 historically  refused  to  accept  immigrants  for  repatriation,  including  Cambodia, \nTH med i Somalia, and Iraq, are similarly experiencing indiscriminate ICE arrests, which are \nED SMInership for 14 the subjects of pending legal actions as well.    See, e.g., Nak Kim Chhoeun v.  David \nREmited liability part 1156 M01a8r9i8n-, CUJnCit e(Gd JSStxat)e. s District Court, Central District of California, Case No. 8:17-cv-\nA li 17\n6.  When this action was filed on February 22, 2018, Petitioners’ counsel \n18\nwere aware of approximately 40 pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants with final orders \n19\nof  removal  across  the  country  who  were  beyond  90  days  of  post-removal  order \n20\ndetention. The total number of similarly situated individuals was likely much larger. \n21\nSince  then,  Petitioners’  counsel  have  learned  of  additional  pre-1995  Vietnamese \n22\nimmigrants  who  have  reached  90  days  of  post-removal  order  detention.  On \n23\ninformation  and  belief,  ICE  intends  to  continue  to  detain  pre-1995  Vietnamese \n24\nimmigrants  with  final  orders  of  removal.  The  number  of  Vietnamese  with  final \n25\norders of removal who are at risk of future detention is between 8,000 and 10,000. \n26\nBased on ICE estimates from 2008, an overwhelming percentage of these individuals \n27\narrived in the United States before July 12, 1995.    \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 2 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 5 of 26   Page ID #:387\n \n1\n7.  ICE has undertaken its detention campaign without any evidence that \n2\nVietnam  will  accept  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  that  have  been  or  will  be \n3\ndetained. The repatriation agreement has not been rescinded or modified by either \n4\ncountry. Given Vietnam’s longstanding policy of categorically denying repatriation \n5\nto  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants,  memorialized  in  the  existing  and  valid \n6\nrepatriation  agreement,  detention  of  Petitioners  without  an  individualized  and \n7\nspecific showing that Vietnam actually intends to accept them is unlawful. \n8\n8.  Additionally,  ICE  has  kept  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants  in \n9\ndetention past 180 days without providing them any meaningful custody review to \n10\ndetermine whether continued detention is warranted because they pose a danger or \nware  11\nDela flight risk. ICE cannot lawfully hold Petitioners in prolonged detention absent an \nLLP  n the State of  1123 individualized showing of danger or flight risk before a neutral decision maker.   \nTH med i JURISDICTION \nED SMInership for 14 9.

All Respondents are sued in their official capacity.   \nTH med i LEGAL BACKGROUND \nED SMInership for 14 Detention \nREy part 15\nmited liabilit 16 25.  Following a final order of removal, ICE is directed by statute to detain \nA li 17 an individual for 90 days in order to effectuate removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(2). This \n18 90-day period, also known as “the removal period,” generally commences as soon as \n19 a  removal  order  becomes  administratively  final.  Id.  § 1231(a)(1)(A),  § \n20 1231(a)(1)(B). \n21 26.  If ICE fails to remove an individual during the 90-day removal period, \n22 the  law  requires  ICE  to  release  the  individual  under  conditions  of  supervision, \n23 including periodic reporting. Id. § 1231(a)(3) (“If the alien . . . is not removed within \n24 the  removal  period,  the  alien,  pending  removal,  shall  be  subject  to \n25 supervision.”). Limited exceptions to this rule exist. Specifically, ICE “may” detain \n26 an individual beyond 90 days if the individual was ordered removed on criminal \n27 grounds or is determined to pose a danger or flight risk. Id. § 1231(a)(6). However, \n28 ICE’s  authority  to  detain  an  individual  beyond  the  removal  period  under  such \nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 9 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 12 of 26   Page ID #:394\n \n1\ncircumstances  is  not  boundless. Rather,  it  is  constrained  by  the  constitutional \n2\nrequirement that detention “bear a reasonable relationship to the purpose for which \n3\nthe  individual  [was]  committed.” Zadvydas  v.  Davis,  533  U.S.  678,  690  (2001) \n4\n(citations omitted). Because the principal purpose of the post-final-order detention \n5\nstatute is to effectuate removal, detention bears no reasonable relation to its purpose \n6\nif removal cannot be effectuated. Id. at 697.  \n7\n27.  The United States Supreme Court has accordingly construed Section \n8\n1231(a)(6) as authorizing post-final order detention only for a “period reasonably \n9\nnecessary to secure removal,” a period that the Court determined to be presumptively \n10\nsix months. Id. at 699-701. After this six month period, if a detainee provides “good \nware  11\nDela reason” to believe that his or her removal is not significantly likely in the reasonably \nLLP  n the State of  1123 foreseeable future, “the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut \nTH med i that showing.” Id. at 701. If the government cannot do so, the individual must be \nED SMInership for 14 released.  \nREmited liability part 1156 detenti2o8n.,   asH olownegv ear,s  dreetmainoeveasl  aisre  neontt itrleeads oton arbellye asfoe reesveeena bbleef.o  rSee es ix8  mCo.nFt.hRs.  o§f  \nA li 17\n241.13(b)(1)  (authorizing  release  after  90  days  where  removal  not  reasonably \n18\nforeseeable).  Moreover,  as  the  period  of  post-final-order  detention  grows,  what \n19\ncounts as “reasonably foreseeable” must conversely shrink. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at \n20\n701. \n21\n29.  Even  where  detention  meets  the  Zadvydas  standard  for  reasonable \n22\nforeseeability, detention violates the Due Process Clause unless it is “reasonably \n23\nrelated” to the government’s purpose, which is to prevent danger or flight risk. See \n24\nZadvydas, 533 U.S. at 700 (“[I]f removal is reasonably foreseeable, the habeas court \n25\nshould  consider  the  risk  of  the  alien’s  committing  further  crimes  as  a  factor \n26\npotentially justifying confinement within that reasonable removal period”) (emphasis \n27\nadded);  id.  at  699  (purpose  of  detention  is  “assuring  the  alien’s  presence  at  the \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 10 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 13 of 26   Page ID #:395\n \n1\nmoment of removal”); id. at 690-91 (discussing twin justifications of detention as \n2\npreventing  flight  and  protecting  the  community). Thus,  due  process  requires  a \n3\nmeaningful determination that Petitioners pose a danger or flight risk that would \n4\nwarrant  post-final-order  detention,  regardless  of  whether  their  removal  can  be \n5\neffectuated within a reasonable period of time. \n6\n30.  The government’s own regulations contemplate this requirement. They \n7\ndictate that even after ICE determines that removal is reasonably foreseeable—and \n8\nthat detention therefore does not per se exceed statutory authority—the government \n9\nmust still determine whether continued detention is warranted based on flight risk or \n10\ndanger. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.13(g)(2) (providing that where removal is reasonably \nware  11\nDela foreseeable, “detention will continue to be governed under the established standards” \nLLP  n the State of  1123 in 8 C.F.R. § 241.4). \nTH med i 31.

In 2008, after ten years of negotiation, Vietnam and the United States \n7 executed a repatriation agreement to govern the repatriation of certain Vietnamese \n8 immigrants with final orders of removal to Vietnam. Before this agreement was \n9 negotiated, Vietnam refused to repatriate the overwhelming majority of Vietnamese \n10 immigrants ordered removed from the United States.   \nware  11 34.

Upon information and belief, the repatriation agreement has not been \nA li 17 terminated or modified by either Vietnam or the United States. \n18 36.  The  repatriation  agreement  does  not  permit  the  repatriation  of \n19 Vietnamese  immigrants  who  came  to  the  United  States  before  July  12,  1995.  It \n20 expressly stipulates that “Vietnamese citizens are not subject to return to Vietnam \n21 under this Agreement if they arrived in the United States before July 12, 1995.” See \n22 Agreement,  Article  2:    Removable  Persons  and  Conditions  of  Acceptance.    The \n23 categorical exemption of pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants from repatriation reflects \n24 humanitarian considerations related to the United States’ role in the Vietnam War, \n25 the subsequent resettlement of Vietnamese refugees in America, and the continuing \n26 tension between the Vietnamese government and the Vietnamese refugees who were \n27 forced to flee their homes to avoid profound hardship and persecution after the war.   \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 12 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 15 of 26   Page ID #:397\n \n1\n37.  The end of the Vietnam War caused hundreds of thousands of South \n2\nVietnamese refugees to flee to the United States by boat or by air to escape political \n3\npersecution  and  death.    Other  Vietnamese  immigrants  who  resettled  in  America \n4\nbefore July 12, 1995 were accepted to the United States to reunite with their loved \n5\nones or for other humanitarian reasons. The Vietnamese refugees who fled to the \n6\nUnited States in the 20 years following the Vietnam War included those with close \n7\nties to the United States military or South Vietnamese government who feared for \n8\ntheir lives under the new communist government and the hundreds of thousands of \n9\n“Boat People” who poured out of Vietnam in rickety, wooden boats, desperate to \n10\nescape communist re-education camps and other forms of political persecution. \nware  11\nDela 38.  Abandoned children of American soldiers and Vietnamese women—\nLLP  n the State of  1123 known  as  “Amerasians”  and  pejoratively  referred  to  as  the  “dust  of  life”  in \nTH med i Vietnam—were also among the waves of Vietnamese immigrants who resettled in \nED SMInership for 14 the  United  States  before  July  12,  1995.

After  1975,  many  were  imprisoned  in  labor  or \n22\nreeducation camps. Recognizing the extreme persecution faced by Amerasians and \n23\nacknowledging its responsibility towards these half-American children, the United \n24\nStates in the 1980s enacted laws that gave thousands of Vietnamese Amerasians the \n25\nopportunity to leave behind a country that never accepted them in order start anew in \n26\nthe homeland of their fathers.   \n27\n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 13 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 16 of 26   Page ID #:398\n \n1\n39.  These early Vietnamese refugees to America lacked resources—formal \n2\neducation, English-language proficiency, a supportive ethnic community, or mental \n3\nhealth services to help cope with war-related trauma—to ease their transition to an \n4\nunfamiliar  country.  In  addition,  ad  hoc  resettlement  practices  dispersed  these \n5\nrefugees,  often  pushing  them  into  economically  deteriorating,  high-crime \n6\nneighborhoods with under-resourced schools. While many Vietnamese refugees beat \n7\nthe  odds  stacked  against  them  to  pursue  higher  education,  start  successful  small \n8\nbusinesses, and build families in their new homeland, some were convicted of crimes \n9\nthat resulted in orders of removal. \n10\n40.

Although  the  repatriation  agreement  officially  opened  the  door  for \n6\nrepatriation of Vietnamese immigrants who arrived to the United States on or after \n7\nJuly 12, 1995, Vietnam continues to accept only a very limited number of persons \n8\nfor repatriation each year and still regularly refuses to issue travel documents. Based \n9\non  publicly  available  information  from  ICE  and  from  the  Executive  Office  for \n10\nImmigration Review, from 2008 to 2016, Vietnam only accepted an average of 13 \nware  11\nDela percent of individuals ordered removed to Vietnam each year.  On information and \nLLP  n the State of  1123 belief, a negligible percentage of the removals to Vietnam have been removals of \nTH med i pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants, consistent with the repatriation agreement.   \nED SMInership for 14 43.

Currently, between 8,000 and 10,000 Vietnamese Americans are living \n23\nin the United States with final orders of removal. According to ICE estimates, 6,200 \n24\nof the 7,700 Vietnamese who had final orders of removal in 2008 came to the United \n25\nStates  before  1995,  indicating  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  8,000  to  10,000 \n26\nVietnamese with final orders of removal today are pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants. \n27\n \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 15 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 18 of 26   Page ID #:400\n \n1 Unlawful Detention in Violation of the Repatriation Agreement  \n2\n45.

Id. § 12.  \n7\n46.  ICE soon after began conducting widespread arrests of immigrants from \n8\n“recalcitrant” countries, including Iraq, Cambodia, and Somalia, without requisite \n9\nevidence  that  these  countries  would  repatriate  the  individuals  arrested,  often \n10\nfollowed by prolonged detention without due consideration to whether detention was \nware  11\nDela necessary to effectuate their removal. Immigrants from these countries filed class \nLLP  n the State of  1123 action lawsuits around the country challenging ICE’s unlawful denial of due process \nTH med i to their communities.        \nED SMInership for 14 47.

In  March  2017,  ICE  also  began  re-arresting  pre-1995  Vietnamese \n21\nimmigrants with final orders of removal whom it had previously released. Many \n22\nwere transported to Krome Detention Center in Miami, Florida to be interviewed by \n23\nthe Vietnamese Consulate between March 20 and 31, 2017.   \n24\n49.  On  September  21,  2017,  the  United  States  submitted  95  cases  of \n25\nVietnamese immigrants with final orders of removal to the Vietnamese government \n26\nto consider for repatriation.  \n27\n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 16 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 19 of 26   Page ID #:401\n \n1\n50.  In  October  2017,  ICE  again  carried  out  mass  arrests  of  Vietnamese \n2\nimmigrants with final orders of removal who had returned to their communities on \n3\norders of supervision—including pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants. Arrests occurred \n4\nin  several  states  across  the  country,  including  Georgia,  Pennsylvania,  Texas, \n5\nColorado,  and  California.  Many  of  the  individuals  arrested  were  transported  to \n6\nStewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia to be interviewed by the Vietnamese \n7\nConsulate  between  the  end  of  October  and  beginning  of  November,  2017. \n8\nAfterwards,  they  were  transported  to  various  detention  centers  for  continued \n9\ndetention.  \n10\n51.  In  defense  of  ICE’s  abrupt  change  in  policy  and  violation  of  the \nware  11\nDela repatriation agreement, the United States government claims that Vietnam is now \nLLP  n the State of  1123 “willing  to  consider”  repatriation  of  Vietnamese  who  came  to  the  United  States \nTH med i before July 12, 1995.  However, the government has not substantiated this claim with \nED SMInership for 14 any official document memorializing Vietnam’s alleged change in policy, and the \nREmited liability part 1156 rceopnadturicatt iodno esa gnroeet msiegnnta lr eamnayi nms eiann inegfffeuclt .d  eFpuarrtthuerre,  ftrhoem  V iitest ncaamteegsoer icgaolv erernfumsaeln tt’os  \nA li 17\nrepatriate  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants,  despite  continued  pressure  from  the \n18\nUnited States. \n19\n52.  On information and belief, the Vietnamese government has only issued \n20\ntravel  documents  to  seven  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants.  Moreover,  on \n21\ninformation and belief, Vietnam will not accept the deportation of any pre-1995 \n22\nindividuals without an interview. Some Petitioners and class members have never \n23\nbeen  interviewed  by  the  Vietnamese  Consulate  and  are  therefore  not  being \n24\nconsidered for repatriation, yet remain in ICE custody.   \n25\n53.  During  interviews  conducted  by  the  Consulate,  Vietnamese  officials \n26\nquestioned individuals about whether they have any family living in Vietnam who \n27\ncan support them if deported; whether they have any family living in the United \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 17 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 20 of 26   Page ID #:402\n \n1\nStates who will be impacted if deported; and whether they are willing to accept their \n2\ndeportation. On information and belief, Vietnam is extremely reluctant to issue travel \n3\ndocuments to individuals like Petitioners who have no family in Vietnam; whose \n4\nfamilies in the United States will suffer hardship as a result of their deportation; \n5\nand/or who do not wish to return to Vietnam.   \n6\n54.  Despite  the  United  States  government’s  vague  representations,  the \n7\nVietnamese government’s conduct does not indicate that it truly intends to repatriate \n8\nthe hundreds of pre-1995 Vietnamese whom ICE is currently detaining or will likely \n9\ndetain under its current detention campaign.  \n10\n55.  ICE  lacks  any  particularized  evidence  that  Vietnam  will  accept \nware  11\nDela Petitioners’  or  class  members’  repatriation.  Despite  this  lack  of  proof  that \nLLP  n the State of  1123 Petitioners’ and class members’ repatriation is significantly likely in the reasonably \nTH med i foreseeable future, ICE has detained Petitioners and class members more than 90 \nED SMInership for 14 days or 180 days beyond the date of their removal orders. \nREmited liability part 1156 than 18506 . dayFsu wrtihtehromuto raen,  Pinedtiitvioidnuearlsi zaendd  hcelaasrsin mg ebmefboerres  aa rne ebuetirnagl  ddeectaisiinoend  mfoark mero rtoe  \nA li 17\nassess whether detention is warranted due to danger or flight risk.

To  the  extent  that  ICE  has  been  conducting  any  90-day  post-order \n21\ncustody  reviews  for  Petitioners  and  class  members,  they  have  been  perfunctory, \n22\nresulting in boilerplate decisions that merely rubberstamp continued detention. Some \n23\nclass members have been told by ICE employees that Vietnamese with final orders \n24\nof removal will continue to be detained until the Vietnamese government issues a \n25\ntravel  document,  though  some  requests  for  travel  documents  have  been  pending \n26\nsince  late  October  or  early  November  2017  and  others  since  March  2017.

Petitioners seek to represent the following classes: (1) all Vietnamese \nREy part 15 nationals who arrived in the United States before July 12, 1995 and who have been \nmited liabilit 16 or will be detained by ICE for more than 90 days after receiving final orders of \nA li 17 removal  (“90-Day Class”); (2) all Vietnamese nationals who arrived in the United \n18 States before July 12, 1995 and who have been or will be detained by ICE for more \n19 than 180 days after receiving final orders of removal (“180-Day Class”); and (3) all \n20 Vietnamese nationals who arrived in the United States before July 12, 1995, who are \n21 subject to final orders of removal, and who have been or will be detained by ICE for \n22 more than 180 days without a bond hearing to determine whether their prolonged \n23 detention is justified (“Prolonged Detention Class”). \n24 60.  Members  of  each  proposed  class  are  so  numerous  that  joinder  is \n25 impracticable.  Petitioners  identified  at  least  45  pre-1995  Vietnamese  immigrants \n26 with final orders of removal who, at the time this action was filed on February 22, \n27 2018, were in ICE custody in just 20 of ICE’s 111 detention facilities. At least 37 of \n28 the 45 had been detained for more than 90 days after receiving removal orders; 18 of \nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 19 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 22 of 26   Page ID #:404\n \n1\nthose 37 had been detained for more than 180 days after receiving removal orders. \n2\nThe total numbers of 90-Day Class members and 180-Day Class members were \n3\nlikely  much  higher.  Since  the  filing  of  this  action,  Petitioners  have  learned  of \n4\nadditional pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have reached 90 or 180 days of \n5\npost-order detention. The Prolonged Detention Class is at least as numerous as the \n6\n180-Day Class because all individuals who have reached 180 days of post-order \n7\ndetention have also exceeded 180 days of total detention. Further, 8,000 to 10,000 \n8\nVietnamese immigrants in the United States currently have final orders of removal. \n9\nICE’s  aggressive  detention  of  these  individuals  as  part  of  a  Headquarters-driven \n10\ndecision means the classes will continue to grow.  \nware  11\nDela 61.  Petitioners’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed classes. In \nLLP  n the State of  1123 addition, Petitioners will fairly and adequately represent the interests of all members \nTH med i of the proposed classes. Petitioners seek relief that is identical to the relief sought by \nED SMInership for 14 members of each class, and they have no interests that are adverse to other class \nREmited liability part 1156 amnedm cblaesrss .a Pcetitoitnio lniteigrsa thioavne a nredt awinileld a dcoequunasetel lwy hreop hreasveen et xthpee riinetnecrees itns  oimf tmheig cralatisosnes l.a w \nA li 17\n62.  Multiple  questions  of  law  and  fact  are  common  to  members  of  the \n18\nproposed classes, including: \n19\na.  Whether the 90-Day Class members and 180-Day Class members have \n20\nshown good reason to believe that their removal is not reasonably foreseeable; \n21\nb.  Whether  Respondents  have  sufficient  evidence  that  the  90-Day  Class \n22\nmembers’ and 180-Day Class members’ removal is reasonably foreseeable to justify \n23\ncontinued detention given that they are specifically excluded from repatriation under \n24\nthe repatriation agreement; and \n25\nc.  Whether Respondents have afforded Prolonged Detention Class members \n26\nindividualized determinations of the need for detention that satisfy Section 1231 and \n27\ndue process. \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 20 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 23 of 26   Page ID #:405\n \n1\n63.  Respondent’s conduct and refusal to act apply generally to the 90-Day \n2\nClass,  180-Day  Class,  and  Prolonged  Detention  Class,  thereby  making  the  final \n3\ninjunctive relief and declaratory relief sought by the Petitioners appropriate with \n4\nrespect to the classes as a whole.  \n5\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n6\nCount One: Unlawful Detention Where  \n7 Removal Is Not Reasonably Foreseeable \n8 64.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n9 65.  Post-removal order detention violates Section 1231 where removal is \n10 not significantly likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future. Zadvydas, 533 \nware  11 U.S. at 678. Detention under these circumstances also violates constitutional due \nDela\nLLP  n the State of  1123 proces6s.6 .  The removal of Petitioners, 90-Day Class members, and 180-Day Class \nTH med i\nED SMInership for 14 members is not significantly likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future \nREy part 15 because  they  are  specifically  excluded  from  repatriation  under  the  repatriation \nmited liabilit 16 agreement. \nA li 17 67.  The 90-Day Class members’ Zadvydas claim is ripe because the six-\n18 month period set forth in Zadvydas is a rebuttable presumption, not a rule. The \n19 presumption is rebutted by a repatriation agreement that expressly excludes pre-1995 \n20 Vietnamese immigrants from repatriation, along with Vietnam’s historical refusal to \n21 accept them. \n22 68.  Through the repatriation agreement and Vietnam’s historical practice, \n23 Petitioners and class members have made their initial showing under Zadvydas of \n24 “good reason to believe” that their removal is not reasonably foreseeable. Id. at 701. \n25 69.  Petitioners, 90-Day Class members, and 180-Day Class members have \n26 shifted  the  burden  to  Respondents  to  produce  individualized  evidence  that  their \n27 removal is reasonably foreseeable. Respondents lack such evidence, yet continue to \n28\nCase No. 8:18-cv-316  – 21 – \nHABEAS CORPUS CLASS ACTION PETITION AND CLASS \nACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 27   Filed 05/11/18   Page 24 of 26   Page ID #:406\n \n1\ndetain Petitioners, 90-Day Class members, and 180-Day Class members in violation \n2\nof Section 1231 and constitutional due process. \n3\n70.  Petitioners, 90-Day Class Members, and 180-Day Class members are \n4\nentitled under the law to immediate release on orders of supervision. \n5\n \n6 Count Two: Unlawful Detention Without  \nDeterminations of Danger and Flight Risk \n7\n71.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated herein. \n8\n72.  Even  when  removal  is  reasonably  foreseeable,  detention  violates \n9\nSection  1231  and  due  process  under  the  United  States  Constitution  unless  it  is \n10\nreasonably related to the government’s purposes of preventing flight and protecting \nware  11\nDela the community.

Moreover, the government is not meaningfully conducting these post-order \n18\ncustody  reviews  in  compliance  with  its  own  regulations  but  is  merely \n19\nrubberstamping continued detention with respect to the Petitioners and Prolonged \n20\nDetention Class members as a whole. \n21\n75.

(Dkt. \n28 27 [First Amended Habeas Corpus Petition and Class Action Complaint, hereinafter \n-1- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 2 of 26   Page ID #:2553\n \n“FAC”] ¶¶ 1–4.)  The named Petitioners assert that they, along with hundreds of other \n1\nVietnamese citizens who immigrated to the United States before July 12, 1995 (“pre-\n2\n1995 Vietnamese immigrants”), were subjected to this practice.   \n3\n \n4\nNow before the Court are cross motions for summary judgment on one of the two \n5\ncounts asserted in the FAC.  (See Dkt. 119-1 [Petitioners’ Memorandum in Support of \n6\nMotion for Summary Judgment, hereinafter “Mot.”]; Dkt. 124 [Respondents’ Cross-\n7\nMotion and Opposition, hereinafter “Cross Mot.”].)  For the following reasons, \n8\nPetitioners’ motion is DENIED IN SUBSTANTIAL PART, and Respondents’ cross-\n9\nmotion is GRANTED IN SUBSTANTIAL PART.1 \n10\n \n11\nII.  BACKGROUND \n12\n \n13\nA.  Legal Background  \n14\n \n15\n  Federal immigration law provides that after a removal order becomes final, the \n16\ngovernment “shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days.”  8 \n17\nU.S.C § 1231(a)(1)(A).  This ninety-day period is often referred to as the “initial removal \n18\nperiod” and during it, the government “shall detain the alien.”  Id. § 1231(a)(2).  In some \n19\ncircumstances, federal immigration authorities can continue to detain an alien beyond the \n20\ninitial removal period.  Specifically, section 1231(a)(6) allows the government to detain \n21\ncertain enumerated classes of aliens—including those were ordered removal due to \n22\ncriminal convictions—for more than ninety days.  Id. § 1231(a)(6).  In Zadvydas v. \n23\nDavis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), the Court addressed the question of how long the \n24\ngovernment can detain an alien pursuant to section 1231(a)(6).   \n25\n26\n \n27\n1 The Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without a hearing.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local \n28 Rule 7-15.  Accordingly, the hearing set for June 15, 2020, at 1:30 p.m. is hereby vacated and off \ncalendar. \n-2- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 3 of 26   Page ID #:2554\n \n \n1\n  The Zadvydas Court began by rejecting the government’s position that section \n2\n1231(a)(6) permitted indefinite detention following the initial removal period.  See id.  It \n3\nheld that “[a] statute that permitted indefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious \n4\nconstitutional problem,” and instead determined that section 1231(a)(6) “implicitly limits \n5\nan alien’s detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien’s removal.”  \n6\nId. at 679.  Thus, “once removal is no longer foreseeable, continued detention is no \n7\nlonger authorized by [section 1231(a)(6)].”  Id. at 699.   \n8\n \n9\n  The Court went on to institute a framework that would govern future challenges to \n10\nsection 1231(a)(6) detention.  “[F]or the sake of uniform administration in the federal \n11\ncourts,” the Court found that post-removal detention was “presumptively reasonable” for \n12\nthe first six months.  Id. at 700–01.  When that “presumptively reasonable” six-month \n13\nperiod ends, aliens seeking release from custody bear the initial burden of providing \n14\n“good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the \n15\nreasonably foreseeable future.”  Id. at 701; see Banda v. McAleenan, 385 F. Supp. 3d \n16\n1099, 1117 (W.D. Wash. 2019) (explaining that “at six months, the burden is on the \n17\ndetainee—not the government—to establish a basis for release”).  Once that initial \n18\nshowing is made, the burden shifts to the Government to respond with evidence sufficient \n19\nto rebut it.  See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701.   \n20\n \n21\nB.  The History of U.S.-Vietnam Repatriation Relations \n22\n \n23\n  After the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese government established the current \n24\nSocialist Republic of Vietnam (“Vietnam”).  (Dkt. 22-12 [Declaration of Tu-Huong \n25\nNguyen-Vo, hereinafter “Nguyen-Vo Decl.”] ¶ 7.)  Around that time, waves of people \n26\nfrom the former Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) fled the country to escape \n27\n28\n-3- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 4 of 26   Page ID #:2555\n \npolitical persecution.  (Id.)  Under various humanitarian programs, the United States \n1\naccepted hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees, including Petitioners.  (Id. ¶ 13.)   \n2\n \n3\n  Between the end of the Vietnam War and 2008, Vietnam refused to repatriate any \n4\nVietnamese immigrants who had been ordered removed from the United States.  \n5\n(Dkt. 124-2 [Respondents’ Statement of Genuine Disputes, hereinafter “Resp. \n6\nStatement”] ¶ 2.)  Before a Vietnamese immigrant without a passport or other travel \n7\ndocument2 can be repatriated, Vietnam must issue a passport or other travel document in \n8\nresponse to a request from ICE.  (Id. ¶ 1.)  In 2008, the United States and Vietnam \n9\nreached a diplomatic agreement pursuant to which Vietnam agreed to start considering \n10\nrepatriation requests for certain Vietnamese immigrants.  (Id. ¶ 3.)  Specifically, the \n11\nagreement obligated Vietnam to consider repatriation requests for Vietnamese \n12\nimmigrants who had arrived in the United States after July 12, 1995.  (Dkt. 27-1 [2008 \n13\nAgreement] at Art. II, ¶ 1.)  The agreement also provided that “Vietnamese citizens are \n14\nnot subject to return to Vietnam under this agreement if they arrived in the United States \n15\nbefore July 12, 1995.”  (Id. at Art. II, ¶ 2.)  Relying on this provision, Vietnam \n16\nmaintained its policy of non-repatriation for pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants after \n17\nsigning the 2008 agreement.  (Resp. Statement ¶ 5; Dkt. 124-3 [Declaration of Julian \n18\nKurz, hereinafter “Kurz Decl.”] at Ex. B [Deposition of John Schultz, hereinafter \n19\n“Schultz Dep.”] at 62:6-11.)   \n20\n \n21\nC.  Post-Removal Detention Practices for Pre-1995 Vietnamese Immigrants  \n22\n \n23\n  Prior to 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) maintained \n24\nthat the removal of pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants was unlikely given Vietnam’s \n25\n26\n \n27\n2 In this Order, the Court’s analysis only concerns pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who do not already \n28 have a passport or other travel document.  For the sake of clarity, it will not repeat the “without a \npassport or travel document” qualification.   \n-4- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 5 of 26   Page ID #:2556\n \nconsistent refusal to repatriate them.  (FAC ¶ 3.)  Accordingly, ICE adopted a policy of \n1\ndetaining pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants for no longer than ninety days after their \n2\nremoval orders became final.  (Id.)  After ninety days, ICE generally released them into \n3\nthe community on orders of supervision.  (Id.)  \n4\n \n5\n  In 2017, ICE entered into negotiations with Vietnam that were aimed at amending \n6\nthe 2008 Agreement and developing a new policy that would allow for pre-1995 \n7\nVietnamese immigrants to be repatriated.  (Kurz Decl. at Ex. A [Deposition of Marla \n8\nJones, hereinafter “Jones Dep.”] at 28:11-19).  These negotiations were somewhat \n9\nsuccessful.  Although the 2008 agreement was not officially amended, Vietnamese \n10\nofficials verbally committed to begin considering ICE travel document requests for pre-\n11\n1995 Vietnamese immigrants on a case-by-case basis, without explicitly committing to \n12\naccept any of them.  (Resp. Statement ¶ 8.)   \n13\n \n14\n  After receiving this verbal commitment in 2017, ICE departed from its \n15\nlongstanding practice of releasing pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants with final orders of \n16\nremoval after ninety days of detention.  Instead, it began detaining them for more than \n17\nninety days based on the possibility that Vietnam might issue the requisite travel \n18\ndocuments.  (FAC ¶ 4.)  ICE also began re-detaining some pre-1995 Vietnamese \n19\nimmigrants who had previously been released on orders of supervision.  (See, e.g., Dkt. \n20\n65-2 [Declaration of Sieu Nguyen, hereinafter “Nguyen Decl.”] ¶¶ 11–12.)  Petitioners \n21\nresponded by filing this lawsuit challenging ICE’s new detention practices on February \n22\n22, 2018.  (Dkt. 1.)   \n23\n \n24\n  On August 6, 2018, ICE met with Vietnamese officials again to continue \n25\ndiscussions about the status of pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants.  (Dkt. 67-1 [Declaration \n26\nof Michael V. Bernacke, hereinafter “Bernacke Decl.”] ¶ 2.)  After that meeting, ICE \n27\nreversed its position again.  ICE conceded that, despite Vietnam’s verbal commitment to \n28\n-5- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 6 of 26   Page ID #:2557\n \nconsider travel document requests for pre-1995 immigrants, in general, the removal of \n1\nthese individuals was still not significantly likely.  (Resp. Statement ¶ 12.)  In October \n2\n2018, ICE instructed field offices to resume the practice of releasing pre-1995 \n3\nVietnamese immigrants within 90 days of a final order of removal.  (Dkt. 119-2 \n4\n[Declaration of Tuan V. Uong, hereinafter “Uong Decl.”] at Ex. F; Schultz Dep. at 178:9-\n5\n22.)  That policy remains in place today.  (Resp. Statement ¶ 12.)   \n6\n \n7\nD.  The Petitioners  \n8\n \n9\n  Petitioners are Vietnamese immigrants who came to the United States prior to July \n10\n12, 1995.  (FAC ¶ 1.)  They became lawful permanent residents years ago but, based on \n11\ncriminal convictions, lost their green cards and were ordered removed.  (Id. ¶ 2.)  After \n12\nfacing varying periods of post-removal order detention, they have been released under \n13\norders of supervision that require them to regularly report to ICE offices.  See 8 U.S.C. \n14\n§ 1231(a)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 241.5(a).  Many have gone on to live productive lives, \n15\nsupporting and caring for dependent family members.  (See e.g., Dkt. 22-13 [Declaration \n16\nof Ngoc Hoang, hereinafter “N. Hoang Decl.”] ¶¶ 8, 15, 18; Dkt. 65-3 [Declaration of \n17\nDai Diep, hereinafter “Diep Decl.”] ¶ 16.)   \n18\n \n19\nPetitioner Hoang Trinh (“Trinh”) entered the United States with his family as a \n20\nfour-year-old refugee in 1980.  (FAC ¶ 11; Dkt. 22-9 [Declaration of Hoang Trinh, \n21\nhereinafter “Trinh Decl.”] ¶¶ 2–3.)  He worked in his family’s bakery while growing up \n22\nand now runs a Vietnamese sandwich shop with his wife.  (FAC ¶ 11; see Trinh Decl. \n23\n¶ 8.)  Trinh’s wife, two children, parents, and six sisters are all U.S. citizens.  (FAC ¶ 11.)  \n24\nIn 2017, he was arrested by state authorities after being found in possession of a \n25\nmarijuana plant and incarcerated for some period of time.  (Id.)  Trinh was subsequently \n26\ntransferred to federal custody in June 2017 and ordered removed on July 27, 2017.  (Id.)  \n27\nOn October 17, 2017, ICE conducted a 90-day post-order custody review (“POCR”) and \n28\n-6- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 7 of 26   Page ID #:2558\n \ndecided to continue Mr. Trinh’s detention because “Vietnam had not denied him a travel \n1\ndocument.”  (Resp. Statement ¶ 15.)  On March 13, 2018—approximately nine months \n2\nafter his initial detention—ICE conducted a second POCR and decided to continue Mr. \n3\nTrinh’s detention “on the ground that ICE was working with Vietnam to secure a travel \n4\ndocument.”  (Id. ¶ 16.)  On April 16, 2018, Trinh was released on an order of supervision \n5\nafter ICE determined that he was not significantly likely to be removed in the reasonably \n6\nforeseeable future.  (Id. ¶ 17.)  It was later revealed that ICE did not submit a travel \n7\ndocument request for Trinh until May 23, 2018, a month after he was released from \n8\nfederal custody.  (Id. ¶ 18.)   \n9\n \n10\nPetitioner Vu Ha (“Ha”) escaped Vietnam at the age of nine and entered the United \n11\nStates as a ten-year-old refugee in 1990.  (FAC ¶ 12; Dkt. 22-16 [Declaration of Vu Ha, \n12\nhereinafter “Ha Decl.”] ¶ 3.)  His parents, sister, and daughter are U.S. citizens.  (FAC \n13\n¶ 12; Ha Decl. ¶ 4.)  Ha was arrested three times as a young adult between 2000 and 2005 \n14\nand once in 2017 for failure to pay a citation for driving without a license.  (FAC ¶ 12.)  \n15\nFollowing the 2017 arrest, he was transported from county jail to ICE custody and was \n16\nordered removed on September 19, 2017.  (Id.)  He was detained for almost seven months \n17\nbefore being released on an order of supervision.  (Ha Decl. ¶¶ 12, 18.) \n18\n \n19\nPetitioner Long Nguyen (“Nguyen”) entered the United States as an eleven-year-\n20\nold refugee in 1987.  (FAC ¶ 13.)  His wife, three step-daughters, and two-year-old \n21\ndaughter are all U.S. citizens.  (Dkt. 22-17 [Declaration of Long Nguyen, hereinafter “L. \n22\nNguyen Decl.”] ¶ 9.)  He and his wife work at a nail salon that his wife manages.  (FAC \n23\n¶ 13.)  In 2006, he was convicted of a nonviolent felony drug offense.  (Id.)  He was \n24\nordered removed on April 18, 2012 but released on an order of supervision later that year.  \n25\n(Resp. Statement ¶ 19.)  Mr. Nguyen was re-detained by ICE on October 19, 2017 after \n26\nICE submitted a travel document request to Vietnam.  (Id. ¶¶ 19–20.)  Vietnam declined \n27\nto issue a travel document for Mr. Nguyen on December 28, 2017.  (Id. ¶ 22.)  Although \n28\n-7- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 8 of 26   Page ID #:2559\n \nVietnamese officials communicated this decision to ICE in late December 2017, Mr. \n1\nNguyen was not released from custody until March 24, 2018.  (Id. ¶ 24.)   \n2\n \n3\nPetitioner Ngoc Hoang (“Hoang”) Hoang entered the United States at age sixteen \n4\nin 1990, after his father was jailed in a reeducation camp for having served in the South \n5\nVietnamese military.  (FAC ¶ 14; N. Hoang Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.)  Hoang was married to a U.S. \n6\ncitizen with whom he has four children, all under the age of eighteen.  (FAC ¶ 14.)  \n7\nHoang now works as a nail salon technician.  (Id.)  In 1994, he pled guilty to check fraud \n8\nand in 2010, he was placed on probation for simple assault and simple battery.  (Id.)  He \n9\nwas ordered removed on December 12, 2012 and released on an order of supervision \n10\napproximately two months later.  (Id.)  Over the next five years, Hoang complied with the \n11\nrequirements of that order.  (Id.)  But on November 6, 2017, he was unexpectedly re-\n12\narrested by ICE officers at his home and not released from federal custody until April 23, \n13\n2018.  (Id.)   \n14\n \n15\nPetitioner Sieu Nguyen (“Sieu”) entered the United States in 1989 when he was \n16\nthree years old.  (FAC ¶ 15; Dkt. 65-2 [Declaration of Sieu Nguyen, hereinafter “Sieu \n17\nDecl.”] ¶ 2.)  His parents and seven siblings are all U.S. citizens.  (Sieu Decl. ¶ 3.)  Sieu \n18\nwas convicted of robbery in 2007 and burglary and receipt of stolen property in 2010.  \n19\n(Id. ¶ 5.)  He was ordered removed on December 19, 2017, and detained for \n20\napproximately seven months before being released on an order of supervision.  (Id. ¶¶ 7, \n21\n10.) \n22\n \n23\n  Petitioner Dai Dep (“Diep”) entered the United States as a refugee in 1995.  (Diep \n24\nDecl. ¶ 2.)  His mother, stepfather, and half-siblings are all U.S. citizens, as is his \n25\nbiological father, who worked for the U.S. Department of Defense during the Vietnam \n26\nWar.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  In November 2015, he pled guilty to second-degree robbery, second-\n27\ndegree burglary, and vandalism, for which he was sentenced to two years of \n28\n-8- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 9 of 26   Page ID #:2560\n \nimprisonment.  (FAC ¶ 16.)  He was ordered removed on October 26, 2017 and was \n1\ndetained for nearly thirteen months before being released on an order of supervision. \n2\n(Diep Decl. ¶¶ 13, 15.) \n3\n \n4\nE.  Procedural History  \n5\n \n6\nPetitioners brought this action on February 22, 2018.  (Dkt. 1.)  The operative \n7\npleading contains two counts, each asserted on behalf of putative classes.  (See FAC ¶¶ \n8\n58–75.)  In Count One, Petitioners assert that their post-removal order detention violates \n9\nfederal immigration law and their constitutional right to due process where removal is not \n10\nlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.  (Id. ¶¶ 64–70.)  In Count Two, Petitioners assert \n11\nthat even if removal is reasonably foreseeable, their prolonged detention violates section \n12\n1231 and their right to due process when it is not coupled with an individuated bond \n13\nhearing.  (Id. ¶¶ 72–75.)   \n14\n \n15\nEarlier in this litigation, the Court denied Respondents’ motion to dismiss, (Dkt. 66 \n16\n[hereinafter “MTD Order”]), and granted in part and denied in part Petitioners’ motion \n17\nfor class certification, (Dkt. 75 [hereinafter “Class Cert. Order”]).  The Court certified \n18\nthree separate classes comprised of: (1) all pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have \n19\nbeen or will be detained by ICE for more than ninety days after receiving removal orders \n20\n(“90-Day Class”), (2) all pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have been or will be \n21\ndetained by ICE for more than 180 days after receiving removal orders (“180-Day \n22\nClass”), and (3) all pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have been or will be detained \n23\nby ICE for more than 180 days in total without a bond hearing (“Prolonged Detention \n24\nClass”).  (Id.)  The Court also determined that the only remedy available to Petitioners \n25\n26\n27\n28\n-9- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 10 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2561\nunder both counts is declaratory relief.  (Id.)  The parties proceeded to discovery, and the \n1\ninstant cross-motions for summary judgment on Count One followed.3    \n2\n \n3\nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD  \n4\n \n5\nThe Court may grant summary judgment on “each claim or defense—or the part of \n6\neach claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \n7\nSummary judgment is proper where the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials \n8\non file, and any affidavits show that “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact \n9\nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Id.; see also Celotex Corp. v. \n10\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial \n11\nburden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex, 477 \n12\nU.S. at 325.  A factual issue is “genuine” when there is sufficient evidence such that a \n13\nreasonable trier of fact could resolve the issue in the nonmovant’s favor.  Anderson v. \n14\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A fact is “material” when its resolution \n15\nmight affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law, and is determined by \n16\nlooking to the substantive law.  Id.  “Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary \n17\nwill not be counted.”  Id. at 249. \n18\n \n19\n  In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court must examine all the \n20\nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and draw all justifiable \n21\ninferences in its favor.  Id.; United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962); T.W. \n22\nElec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass’n, 809 F.2d 626, 630–31 (9th Cir. 1987).  \n23\nThe court does not make credibility determinations, nor does it weigh conflicting \n24\nevidence.  Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 456 (1992).  \n25\nBut conclusory and speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient \n26\n27\n \n28 3 The Prolonged Detention Class only seeks relief under Count Two, so this class is not implicated in the \ninstant cross-motions.     \n-10- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 11 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2562\nto raise triable issues of fact and defeat summary judgment.  Thornhill Publ’g Co. v. GTE \n1\nCorp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).  The material the parties present must be the \n2\ntype that would be admissible in evidence.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). \n3\n \n4\nIV.  ANALYSIS \n5\n \n6\n  Petitioners request that the Court grant their motion for summary judgment on \n7\nCount One and issue declaratory judgments in their favor.  Specifically, Petitioners ask \n8\nthe Court to issue the following five declarations:  \n9\n \n10\n1.  “There is generally no significant likelihood of removal to Vietnam for pre-1995 \n11\nVietnamese immigrants who do not hold a valid Vietnamese passport or other \n12\ntravel document;” \n13\n2.  “180-Day Class Members have satisfied their initial burden under Zadvydas v. \n14\nDavis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), shifting the burden to the government to justify their \n15\ncontinued detention;” \n16\n3.  “90-Day Class Members have rebutted the six-month “presumptively” reasonable \n17\nperiod of detention and satisfied their initial burden under Zadvydas, shifting the \n18\nburden to the government to justify their continued detention;” \n19\n4.  “Respondents unlawfully detained Petitioner Hoang Trinh and other Class \n20\nMembers where there was no significant likelihood of their removal in the \n21\nreasonably foreseeable future by holding them in post-removal order custody for \n22\nmore than 180 days without submitting a travel document request to Vietnam;” \n23\n5.  “Respondents unlawfully detained Petitioner Long Nguyen where there was no \n24\nsignificant likelihood of his removal in the reasonably foreseeable future by \n25\nholding him in post-removal order custody for several months after Vietnam \n26\ndeclined to issue a travel document for him.” \n27\n \n28\n-11- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 12 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2563\n(Mot. at 24.)  The Court will address each proposed declaration in turn.   \n1\n \n2\nA.  Petitioners’ First Proposed Declaration  \n3\n \n4\n  Petitioners’ first proposed declaration states that “[t]here is generally no significant \n5\nlikelihood of removal to Vietnam for pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who do not hold a \n6\nvalid Vietnamese passport or other travel document.”  (Mot. at 24.)  Although the Court \n7\nagrees with Petitioners that in most cases, pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants are unlikely \n8\nto be removed to Vietnam, it cannot issue the broad, amorphous declaration they request.   \n9\n \n10\ni.  Whether pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants are significantly likely \n11\nto be removed   \n12\n \n13\n  Before pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants can be removed to Vietnam, ICE must \n14\nrequest travel documents from Vietnam, and Vietnam must respond by issuing the \n15\ndocuments.  (Resp. Statement ¶ 1.)  Thus, the likelihood that any pre-1995 Vietnamese \n16\nimmigrant will be removed hinges on Vietnam’s willingness to issue the documents \n17\nrequested by ICE.  (Uong Decl. at Ex. A [Schultz Dep. 93:14-20 ].  Most of the statistics \n18\nconcerning Vietnam’s response rate are undisputed.  (Dkt. 115 [Joint Stipulation of \n19\nFacts].)  In 2017, ICE requested travel documents for 40 pre-1995 Vietnamese \n20\nimmigrants, and in response, Vietnam issued 9 travel documents (22.5 percent).  (Id. ¶ 1.)  \n21\nIn 2018, ICE requested travel documents for 157 pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants, and \n22\nin response, Vietnam issued 4 travel documents (2.5 percent).  (Id. ¶ 2.)  Finally, in 2019, \n23\nICE requested travel documents for 54 pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants and in response, \n24\nVietnam issued 5 travel documents (9.3 percent).  (Id. ¶ 3.)  In total, between 2017 and \n25\n2019, ICE requested travel documents for pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants 251 times.  \n26\nVietnam granted those requests only 18 times, in just over seven percent of cases.   \n27\n \n28\n-12- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 13 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2564\n  During this litigation, Respondents have essentially conceded that removal of pre-\n1\n1995 immigrants is generally unlikely.  In October 2018, the Government admitted that, \n2\nbased on ICE’s August 2018 meeting with Vietnamese officials, “ICE no longer believes \n3\nthat Vietnamese nationals who entered the United States prior to July 12, 1995 [] are \n4\nsignificantly likely to be removed to Vietnam in the reasonably foreseeable future.”  \n5\n(Bernacke Decl. ¶ 2.)  And in response to Petitioners’ request for admission, Respondents \n6\nconfirmed that “pre-1995 Vietnamese aliens, except ones that currently hold a valid \n7\npassport or other travel document, generally are not significantly likely to be removed in \n8\nthe foreseeable future.”  (Uong Decl. at Ex. O [Respondents’ Objections and Responses \n9\nto Petitioners’ First Set of Requests for Admission]; see also Schultz Dep. at 29:20–\n10\n30:12.)  These admissions align with ICE’s current practice of releasing pre-1995 \n11\nVietnamese immigrants within 90 days of them receiving a final removal order.  (Resp. \n12\nStatement ¶ 12.)   \n13\n \n14\n  Respondents do not deny their prior admissions, but instead contend that ICE’s \n15\nrelationship with Vietnam has changed, and based on current circumstances, removal of \n16\npre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants is significantly likely.  In July 2019, ICE stationed a \n17\npermanent Assistant Attaché for Removals to Vietnam (“Assistant Attaché”) at the U.S. \n18\nEmbassy in Hanoi for the first time.  (Dkt. 124-1 [Respondents’ Statement of \n19\nUncontroverted Facts, hereinafter “Respondents’ SOF”] ¶ 2.)  Since October 2019, the \n20\nAssistant Attaché has held weekly meetings with Vietnamese immigration officials to \n21\ndiscuss ICE’s pending travel document requests.  (Id. ¶ 3.)  According to Respondents, \n22\nthe Assistant Attaché’s placement and meetings have caused Vietnam to issue travel \n23\ndocuments more frequently.4  (Jones Dep. at 87:12-16.)   \n24\n25  \n4 The parties vigorously dispute the admissibility of a chart that Respondents submitted to support their \n26\nassertion that Vietnam is now issuing travel documents at a greater frequency.  (See Kurz Decl. Ex. C.)  \nThe Court’s Order does not rely on the chart in question.  Accordingly, Petitioners’ objections to it are \n27\noverruled as moot.  See Doe v. Starbucks, Inc., 2009 WL 5183773, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 18, 2009) (“In \n28 motions for summary judgment with numerous objections, it is often unnecessary and impractical for a \ncourt to methodically scrutinize each objection and give a full analysis of each argument raised”.).   \n-13- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 14 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2565\n  \n1\nii.  Petitioners’ proposed declaration is improper  \n2\n \n3\n  Petitioners’ proposed declaration essentially reiterates the government’s past \n4\nposition and states that in general, pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants are not significantly \n5\nlikely to be removed.  (Mot. at 24.)  Though Petitioners’ statistics on this point are \n6\ncompelling, the Court cannot issue this proposed declaration.   \n7\n \n8\n  Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, “in a case of actual controversy within its \n9\njurisdiction . . . any court of the United States . . . may declare the rights and other legal \n10\nrelations of any interested party seeking such declaration.”  28 U.S.C. § 2201(a).  It is \n11\nwell established that “federal courts retain substantial discretion in deciding whether to \n12\ngrant declaratory relief.”  Ernst & Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d 530, \n13\n534 (1st Cir. 1995); see Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 762 (1987).  Declaratory relief is \n14\nappropriate “(1) when the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling \n15\nthe legal relations in issue, and (2) when it will terminate and afford relief from the \n16\nuncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.”  Bilbrey by \n17\nBilbrey v. Brown, 738 F.2d 1462, 1470 (9th Cir. 1984).  However, “federal courts may \n18\nnot give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions.”  Calderon v. Moore, 518 \n19\nU.S. 149, 150 (1996) (internal quotation omitted). \n20\n \n21\n  “The duty of this court . . . is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which \n22\ncan be carried into effect.”  Mills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651, 653 (1895).  Thus, the Court \n23\ncannot issue a declaration that would be devoid of practical effect.  See Calderon, 518 \n24\nU.S. at 150; In re Iraq and Afghanistan Detainees Litig., 479 F. Supp. 2d 85, 118 (D.D.C. \n25\n2007) (“[A] declaratory judgment should be declined when it would serve only as a \n26\nstatement [] without any practical enforcement effect.”).  Petitioners have not explained \n27\nwhat practical effect, if any, their proposed declaration would have.  Nor could they do so \n28\n-14- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 15 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2566\npersuasively.  If this Court issued the proposed declaration, individual pre-1995 \n1\nVietnamese immigrants would still be required to establish that they specifically are not \n2\nsignificantly likely to be removed in order to secure release from detention.  A statement \n3\nfrom this Court that “in general,” pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants are unlikely to be \n4\nremoved would be of little use to them.  Such an abstract pronouncement would not have \n5\nany bearing on clarifying the rights of the parties, nor would it resolve any legal claim.  \n6\nSee S. Jackson & Son, Inc. v. Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exch. Inc., 24 F.3d 427, 431 (2d \n7\nCir. 1994) (affirming the lower court’s declination to issue declaratory relief because the \n8\nproposed declaration did “not carry any implications for practical enforcement upon the \n9\nparties” and would be “a declaration . . .  and nothing more”).  Rather, the proposed \n10\ndeclaration would function only as an advisory opinion, which no federal court is \n11\nempowered to issue.  See Desert Water Agency v. U.S. Dep’t of the Int., 849 F.3d 1250, \n12\n1258 (9th Cir. 2017) (“The declaratory judgment procedure . . . may not be made the \n13\nmedium for securing an advisory opinion in a controversy which has not arisen.”) \n14\n(internal quotations omitted).  Accordingly, Petitioner’s motion for summary judgment is \n15\nDENIED as to the first proposed declaration.     \n16\n \n17\nB.  Petitioners’ Second Proposed Declaration  \n18\n \n19\n  The second proposed declaration concerns the burden-shifting framework \n20\nestablished by the Supreme Court in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001).  It pertains \n21\nto the 180-Day Class, which is comprised of “all pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who \n22\nhave been or will be detained by ICE for more than 180 days after receiving removal \n23\norders.”  (Class Cert. Order at 2.)  Under Zadvydas, aliens seeking release from custody \n24\nbear the initial burden of providing “good reason to believe that there is no significant \n25\nlikelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.”  See 533 U.S. at 701.  Once \n26\nthat initial showing is made, the burden shifts to the Government to respond with \n27\nevidence sufficient to rebut it.  Id.  Petitioners’ proposed declaration would allow every \n28\n-15- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 16 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2567\n180-Day Class member to bypass the first step of the Zadvydas framework in future cases \n1\nby declaring that, as a class, there is “good reason to believe” that their removal is not \n2\nsignificantly likely.  (Mot. at 24.) \n3\n \n4\n  Respondents contend that this proposed declaration cannot be issued on a class-\n5\nwide basis.  They argue that, inevitably, some class members are, in fact, likely to be \n6\nremoved because Vietnam issues travels documents in a small, but non-negligible portion \n7\nof cases.  In these instances, the class members in question will be unable to meet their \n8\ninitial burden of showing there is “good reason to believe” that they are not significantly \n9\nlikely to be removed.  See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 701.  Essentially, the government argues \n10\nthat because some class members will not be able to show that there is “good reason to \n11\nbelieve” that their removal is not significantly likely, issuing a class-wide declaration \n12\nwould be improper.  The Court agrees.     \n13\n \n14\n  The 180-Day Class was certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  \n15\n(Class Cert. Order.)  Rule 23(b)(2) classes are entitled to injunctive or declaratory relief \n16\nonly if “a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member \n17\nof the class.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360 (2011).  “The key to the \n18\n(b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—\n19\nthe notion that the [defendant’s] conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared \n20\nunlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.”  Id. (internal \n21\nquotations omitted).  Thus, Rule 23(b)(2) classes cannot obtain class-wide relief when \n22\n“each individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory \n23\njudgment against the defendant.”  Id.  In light of these principles, Rule 23(b)(2) remedies \n24\nare “generally inappropriate in actions raising significant individual liability or defense \n25\nissues.”  Ramirez v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 338 F. Supp. 3d 1, 47 \n26\n(D.D.C. 2018) (internal quotation omitted).   \n27\n \n28\n-16- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 17 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2568\n  Petitioners’ proposed declaration clashes with the rule that relief under Rule \n1\n23(b)(2) must be appropriate for “each member of the class.”  Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. \n2\nat 360.  When the Court certified the 180-Day Class in 2018, it did so based on  the \n3\nunderstanding that ICE maintained a policy of detaining pre-1995 Vietnamese \n4\nimmigrants beyond the initial removal period despite Vietnam’s uniform policy of \n5\nrefusing to issue travel documents for them.  (Class Cert. Order at 15; FAC ¶ 66 [alleging \n6\nthat class members were being detained despite being “specifically excluded from \n7\nrepatriation under the repatriation agreement”].)  This presumed uniformity is what made \n8\npotential class-wide declaratory relief under Rule 23(b)(2) appropriate.  It has since \n9\nbecome clear that these uniform policies and practices are no longer in effect.  The parties \n10\nnow agree that Vietnam does not maintain a blanket policy of refusing to repatriate pre-\n11\n1995 immigrants.  (Resp. Statement ¶ 8.)  Instead, Vietnam now considers each request \n12\nfrom ICE on a case-by-case basis.  (Id.)  ICE frequently requests travel documents from \n13\nVietnam for pre-1995 immigrants, and Vietnam issues them in a non-negligible portion \n14\nof cases.  (Resp. Statement ¶¶ 9–12; Dkt. 115)   \n15\n \n16\n  Petitioners do not appear to dispute that once Vietnam issues a travel document, \n17\nremoval becomes significantly likely, rendering class members unable to meet their \n18\ninitial burden under Zadvydas.  See Alfaro-Mejia v. Holder, 2013 WL 599876, at *1 \n19\n(C.D. Cal. Feb. 15, 2013) (holding that petitioner could not demonstrate that there is no \n20\nsignificant likelihood of her removal in the reasonably foreseeable future because “travel \n21\ndocuments for petitioner’s return to El Salvador have been issued recently”); Kumar v. \n22\nGonzales, 555 F. Supp. 2d 1061, 1065 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (same).  Nor do they dispute that \n23\nin some instances, Vietnam has issued travel documents for pre-1995 immigrants.  (Resp. \n24\nStatement ¶¶ 9–12; Mot. at 16.)  Accordingly, a class-wide declaration stating that each \n25\n180-Day Class member has met his or her initial burden under Zadvydas would run \n26\ncounter to the facts in cases where Vietnam responds to ICE requests with travel \n27\ndocuments.  Because not all class members would be entitled to the proposed relief, the \n28\n-17- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 18 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2569\nproposed declaration is improper under Rule 23(b)(2).  See Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at \n1\n360; Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 852 (2018) (suggesting that Rule 23(b)(2) \n2\nwas an improper vehicle when “some members of the certified class may not be entitled \n3\nto [the requested relief]”). \n4\n \n5\n  Furthermore, Rule 23(b)(2) remedies are inappropriate in situations where “highly \n6\nindividualized determinations of liability and remedy are made.”  Jamie S. v. Milwaukee \n7\nPub. Schools, 668 F.3d 481, 499 (7th Cir. 2012).5  Such determinations are required to \n8\nresolve individual Zadvydas claims.  Typically, class members bring Zadvydas claims in \n9\nindividual habeas proceedings in federal courts across the county.  (See Dkt. 73-1 [listing \n10\n71 individual habeas proceedings filed by pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants in 2017 and \n11\n2018].)  Once a challenge is made, the presiding court typically engages in a fact-\n12\ndependent inquiry regarding whether the petitioner has shown there is “good reason to \n13\nbelieve” that he or she is not significantly likely to be removed, and, if that is the case, \n14\nwhether the government has rebutted the showing.  See, e.g., Jaime F. v. Barr, 2020 WL \n15\n2316437, at *5 (D.N.J. May 11, 2020).  These determinations often hinge on specific \n16\nevidence concerning the government’s progress (or lack thereof) in obtaining travel \n17\ndocuments for specific the petitioner.  See, e.g., Azad v. Immigration & Customs \n18\nEnforcement, 2009 WL 2569132, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 2009) (finding that ICE failed \n19\nto rebut a showing by petitioner by analyzing specific contacts that ICE had with the \n20\nlocal Consulate of Bangladesh); Mohamed v. Ashcroft, 2002 WL 32620339, at *1 (W.D. \n21\nWash. Apr. 15, 2002) (granting relief where government failed to offer any “specific \n22\ninformation regarding how or when [it] expect[ed] to obtain the necessary documentation \n23\n24\n \n25 5 Compare Nightingale v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs, 333 F.R.D. 449, 463 (N.D. Cal. \n2019) (finding that class-wide relief under Rule 23(b)(2) was appropriate because the plaintiff did “not \n26\nseek relief with respect to the determinations made on individual A-File FOIA requests” but “rather \nchallenge Defendants’ pattern or practice of refusing to timely make such determinations”) with C.G.B. \n27\nv. Wolf, 2020 WL 2935111, at *19 (D.D.C. June 2, 2020) (denying relief under Rule 23(b)(2) when \n28 individual class-members’ cases “raise[d] thorny, individualized questions” such that the court could not \nissue “an indivisible injunction benefiting all its members at once”).   \n-18- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 19 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2570\nor cooperation from the Ethiopian government”).  Oftentimes, Zadvydas claims require \n1\nevidentiary hearings on the likelihood of removal.  See, e.g., Owino v. Napolitano, 575 \n2\nF.3d 952, 956 (9th Cir. 2009) (ordering the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing \n3\non the issue of whether the petitioner was significantly likely to be removed to Kenya).  \n4\nClearly, each separate Zadvydas challenge requires the presiding court to consider the \n5\nfacts and circumstances of the individual claim.  Issuing Petitioners’ proposed declaration \n6\nwould preempt that individualized analysis and replace it with a one-size-fits-all \n7\napproach ill-suited for the inquiry at hand.   \n8\n \n9\n  When establishing the framework that would govern future claims brought under \n10\nZadvydas, the Supreme Court recognized that individual cases would require the lower \n11\ncourts to make “difficult judgments” about whether a particular alien is significantly \n12\nlikely to be removed.  See 533 U.S. at 700–01.  The Supreme Court has also cautioned \n13\nagainst issuing Rule 23(b)(2) remedies in analogous situations that involve fact-\n14\ndependent determinations.  See Jennings, 138 S. Ct. at 852 (suggesting that Rule 23(b)(2) \n15\nwas improper because the individual due process claims at issue are “flexible . .  and \n16\ncall[] for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands”).  In light of the \n17\nindividualized inquiries involved in each class members’ Zadvydas claim, the Court \n18\ncannot issue a sweeping declaration stating that every 180-Day Class member has \n19\nestablished “good reason to believe” that their removal is not significantly likely.  That \n20\ndetermination must be made in the first instance by the court addressing their individual \n21\nclaim.   \n22\n \n23\n  None of the cases Petitioners cite compel a contrary result.  First, the rulings \n24\nPetitioners cite occurred at the certification stage, not at summary judgment.  See e.g., \n25\nRodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1125 (9th Cir. 2010), Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, \n26\n688 (9th Cir. 2014).  And the relief sought in those cases was markedly different from the \n27\nclass-wide declaration Petitioners seek here.  In each case, plaintiffs sought a declaration \n28\n-19- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 20 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2571\nthat a government policy or practice was unlawful or an injunction requiring the \n1\ngovernment to halt an unlawful policy or practice.  See, e.g., Parson, 754 F.3d at 663.  \n2\nPetitioners seek something altogether different: a class-wide declaration that each \n3\nindividual class-members has satisfied a burden in hypothetical future cases.  Petitioners \n4\nhave pointed to no case in which a court has issued such a declaration.   \n5\n \n6\n  In sum, although many class members may be able to show that there is “good \n7\nreason to believe” their removal is unlikely, others will not.  The Court thus cannot find \n8\nthat Petitioners are entitled to a declaration that each individual class-member has \n9\nsatisfied their initial burden under Zadvydas.  Accordingly, it cannot craft declaratory \n10\nrelief that would effectively “provide relief to each member of the class.”  See Wal-Mart \n11\nStores, 564 U.S. at 360.  Petitioners’ motion for summary judgment is therefore \n12\nDENIED to the extent it seeks this declaration.   \n13\n \n14\nC.  Petitioners’ Third Proposed Declaration  \n15\n \n16\n  Petitioners’ third proposed declaration concerns the 90-Day Class, which is \n17\ncomprised of “all pre-1995 Vietnamese immigrants who have been or will be detained by \n18\nICE for more than 90 days after receiving a removal order.”  (Class Cert. Order at 2.)  \n19\nPetitioners seek a declaration that the 90-Day Class members have rebutted the six-month \n20\n“presumptively” reasonable period of detention and satisfied their initial burden under \n21\nZadvydas.   \n22\n \n23\ni.  The Zadvydas claim is ripe  \n24\n \n25\n  The parties do not dispute that under Zadvydas, detention beyond the initial \n26\nremoval period is only authorized if removal is significantly likely to occur in the \n27\nreasonably foreseeable future.  Rather, they dispute when challenges under Zadvydas can \n28\n-20- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 21 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2572\nbe brought.  Again, in Zadvydas, the Supreme Court, established a “presumptively \n1\nreasonable period of detention” of six months “for the sake of uniform administration in \n2\nthe federal courts.”  533 U.S. at 700–01.  Respondents first argue that the 90-day class’s \n3\nclaim is unripe because Zadvydas claims are barred until detention extends beyond the \n4\npresumptively reasonable six-month period.  The Court disagrees.   \n5\n \n6\n  The central holding of Zadvydas is that section 1231(a)(6) does not permit \n7\ndetention beyond the initial 90-day removal period when removal is not reasonably \n8\nforeseeable.  See 533 U.S. at 699–700.  At no point did the Zadvydas Court preclude a \n9\nnoncitizen from challenging their detention before the end of the presumptively \n10\nreasonable six-month period.  See Cesar v. Achim, 542 F. Supp. 2d 897, 903 (E.D. Wis. \n11\n2008) (noting that “[n]othing about this scheme supports the conclusion . . . that the \n12\npresumptive legality of detention within the first six months is irrebuttable.”); Ali v. Dep’t \n13\nof Homeland Sec., 2020 WL 1666074, at *4 (S.D. Tex. Apr. 2, 2020) (same); but see \n14\nAkinwale v. Ashcroft, 287 F.3d 1050, 1052 (11th Cir. 2002) (holding that “in order to \n15\nstate a claim under Zadvydas” the alien must show “post-removal order detention in \n16\nexcess of six months”).  Instead, it held that detention for less than six months was \n17\npresumptively reasonable but left the lower courts to determine whether detention has \n18\n“exceed[ed] a period reasonably necessary to secure removal” in individual cases.  See \n19\nZadvydas, 533 U.S. at 699.  Respondents have already raised—and this Court has already \n20\nrejected—the argument that Zadvydas claims are barred during the first six months of \n21\ndetention.  (See MTD Order at 14.)  Respondents cite no new binding authority for their \n22\nposition, and the Court remains unpersuaded by it.  Zadvydas established a “guide” for \n23\napproaching detention challenges, not a categorical prohibition on claims challenging \n24\ndetention less than six months.  See 533 U.S. at 700–01.   \n25\n \n26\n// \n27\n// \n28\n-21- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 22 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2573\nii.  The proposed relief is nonetheless improper  \n1\n   \n2\n  Although the Court finds that 90-Day Class members are not precluded from \n3\nchallenging their detentions during the “presumptively reasonable” period, the Court \n4\ncannot issue the class-wide declaration they seek for the same reasons discussed above.  \n5\nPetitioners’ proposed declaration states: “the 90-Day Class Members have rebutted the \n6\nsix-month ‘presumptively’ reasonable period of detention and satisfied their initial \n7\nburden under Zadvydas, shifting the burden to the government to justify their continued \n8\ndetention.”  (Mot. at 24.)  This proposed declaration suffers from the same flaws as the \n9\ndeclaration discussed in the prior section.  In some instances, Vietnam will issue travel \n10\ndocuments for 90-Day Class members, rendering them unable to both rebut the \n11\npresumption and meet their initial burden.  See Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 360.  The \n12\nfact-intensive question of whether individual class members are significantly likely to be \n13\nremoved needs to be answered in the first instance by the court presiding over the \n14\nindividual claim.  Petitioners’ motion for summary judgment is DENIED to the extent it \n15\nseeks a declaration that each member of the 90-Day Class has rebutted the presumption \n16\nand satisfied their initial burden under Zadvydas.  \n17\n \n18\nD.  Petitioners’ Fourth and Fifth Proposed Declarations  \n19\n \n20\n  Finally, Petitioners seek two declarations that Respondents violated the rights \n21\nPetitioners Trinh and Nguyen by detaining them for months despite the fact that they \n22\nwere unlikely to be removed.  Though the Court is extremely troubled by what occurred \n23\nin these two individual cases, it cannot issue the retrospective declaratory relief \n24\nPetitioners seek.   \n25\n \n26\n  The disturbing facts of Trinh and Nguyen’s detentions are largely undisputed.  In \n27\n2016, Trinh—a father of two who runs a small business with his wife—was convicted of \n28\n-22- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 23 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2574\na drug-related offense.  (Trinh Decl. ¶¶ 7–8.)  When Mr. Trinh completed his state \n1\nsentence, he was transferred into ICE custody.  (Id. ¶ 10.)  He was ordered removed on \n2\nJuly 27, 2017.  (Resp. Statement ¶ 13.)  On October 17, 2017, ICE conducted a 90-day \n3\npost-order custody review (“POCR”) and decided to continue Mr. Trinh’s detention \n4\nbecause “Vietnam had not denied him a travel document.”  (Id. ¶ 15.)  On March 13, \n5\n2018—approximately nine months after his initial detention—ICE conducted a second \n6\nPOCR and continued Mr. Trinh’s detention again “on the ground that ICE was working \n7\nwith Vietnam to secure a travel document.”  (Id. ¶ 16.)  On April 16, 2018, Trinh was \n8\nreleased on an order of supervision after ICE determined that he was not significantly \n9\nlikely to be removed.  (Id. ¶ 17.)   \n10\n \n11\n  It later came to light that ICE did not even submit a travel document request for \n12\nMr. Trinh until May 23, 2018—over one month after his release.  (Id. ¶ 18.)  That request \n13\nwas denied about one month later.  (See id.)  Thus, ICE’s explanations for his continued \n14\ndetention in the POCRs—that “Vietnam had not denied him a travel document” and that \n15\n“ICE was working with Vietnam to secure a travel document”—were simply untrue.  To \n16\ndate, ICE has offered no explanation for this injustice.  As a result of ICE’s malfeasance, \n17\nMr. Trinh was unnecessarily detained for several months of his life.   \n18\n \n19\n  Mr. Nguyen’s experience with ICE is similarly troubling.  Nguyen—who was \n20\ninitially ordered removed in 2012 and had been on supervised release ever since—was re-\n21\ndetained by ICE on October 19, 2017, after ICE requested travel documents from \n22\nVietnam.  (Id. ¶ 21.)  On December 28, 2017, Vietnam declined to issue travel documents \n23\nfor Nguyen and requested that he be allowed to remain in the United States on \n24\nhumanitarian grounds.  (Id. ¶ 22.)  After receiving this response from Vietnam, ICE \n25\n26\n27\n28\n-23- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 24 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2575\ninexplicably did not release Nguyen from custody until March 23, 2018, nearly three \n1\nmonths after Vietnam declined to issue travel documents.6  (Id. ¶ 24.)   \n2\n \n3\n  Despite the serious injustices that both Trinh and Nguyen experienced at the hands \n4\nof ICE, the Court cannot grant the particular form of relief they seek in this case.  \n5\nTypically, declaratory relief targets prospective conduct.  Declaratory judgments are used \n6\nto “afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the \n7\nproceeding.”  Bilbrey, 738 F.2d at 1470.  But the declaratory relief Trinh and Nguyen \n8\nseek is purely retrospective.  They seek declarations stating that their rights were violated \n9\nin 2017 and 2018.  In support of their argument that they are entitled to this form of \n10\nrelief, Trinh and Nguyen contend that a retrospective declaration is “the only means of \n11\ndeterring Respondents from engaging in similar violations in the future.”  (Mot. at 21.)  \n12\nThe Court disagrees that this is proper grounds for issuing the proposed declarations. \n13\n \n14\n  What makes a declaratory judgment “a proper judicial resolution of a ‘case or \n15\ncontroversy’ rather than an advisory opinion—is in the settling of some dispute which \n16\naffects the behavior of the defendant towards the plaintiff.”  Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. \n17\n755, 761 (1987).  However, federal courts “are not in the business of pronouncing that \n18\npast actions which have no demonstrable continuing effect were right or wrong.”  \n19\nSpencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 18 (1998).  Thus, “in the context of an action for \n20\ndeclaratory relief, a plaintiff must be seeking more than a retrospective opinion that he \n21\nwas wrongly harmed by the defendant.”  Jordan v. Sosa, 654 F.3d 1012, 1025 (10th Cir. \n22\n2011) (citing Ashcroft v. Mattis, 431 U.S. 171, 172 (1977)).  Put another way, “a \n23\ndeclaratory judgment merely adjudicating past violations of federal law—as opposed to \n24\n25\n26\n \n6 ICE contends that it continued to detain Nguyen because it had asked Vietnam to reconsider its refusal \n27\nto issue travel documents for him.  (Resp. Statement ¶ 23.)  However, there is no evidence that Vietnam \n28 has any history of acquiescing to such requests.  Nor is there any evidence that Vietnam gave ICE any \nindication that it was actively considering the reconsideration request.    \n-24- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 25 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2576\ncontinuing or future violations of federal law—is not an appropriate exercise of federal \n1\njurisdiction.”  See Bayer v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 861 F.3d 853, 868 (9th Cir. 2017). \n2\n \n3\n  Because the declaration Petitioners seek would be nothing more than a \n4\nretrospective opinion that their rights were violated, the Court cannot issue it.  See \n5\nMendia v. Garcia, 165 F. Supp. 3d 861, 894 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (declining to issue a \n6\nretrospective declaratory judgment that defendants violated plaintiffs rights); Green v. \n7\nBranson, 108 F.3d 1296, 1300 (10th Cir. 1997) (declining to issue a retroactive \n8\ndeclaratory judgment that “would amount to nothing more than a declaration that he was \n9\nwronged, and would have no effect on the defendants’ behavior towards him”); \n10\nRodriguez v. Tilton, 2015 WL 3507126, at *2 (E.D. Cal. June 3, 2015) (holding that \n11\nfederal courts are “not empowered to issue retrospective declaratory relief with respect to \n12\nallegedly unconstitutional conduct that has ended”); C.F.C. v. Miami-Dade County, 349 \n13\nF. Supp. 3d 1236, 1254 (S.D. Fla. 2018) (dismissing claim that sought only retrospective \n14\ndeclaratory relief when the declaration sought would be “nothing more than a gratuitous \n15\ncomment without any force or effect”).  Accordingly, Petitioners’ motion is DENIED to \n16\nthe extent it seeks retrospective declaratory relief regarding Trinh and Nguyen’s \n17\ndetention.  \n18\n \n19\n// \n20\n// \n21\n// \n22\n// \n23\n// \n24\n// \n25\n// \n26\n// \n27\n// \n28\n-25- \n\nCase 8:18-cv-00316-CJC-GJS   Document 146   Filed 06/11/20   Page 26 of 26   Page ID\n   #:2577\nIV.  CONCLUSION    \n1\n \n2\nFor the foregoing reasons, Respondents’ motion for summary judgment on Count \n3\nOne is GRANTED IN SUBSTANTIAL PART and Petitioners’ motion for summary \n4\njudgment on Count One is DENIED IN SUBSTANTIAL PART.   \n5\n \n6\n \n7\n \n8\n  DATED:  June 11, 2020 \n9\n            __________________________________ \n10\n              CORMAC J.
