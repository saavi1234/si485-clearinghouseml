CONCLUSION directing that the Section 235, 236\nand 101 programs be continued (cid:9) (cid:9) 17\n\n-3-\n4 \n1 • INTRODUCTION\nThis suit was initially brought by the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania, the Maine State Housing Authority, five non-profit\ncorporations which claim to be potential sponsors of FHA subsidized\nhousing, and various community and civil rights organizations,\npurportedly on behalf of all others similarly situated. A later\nMotion to Intervene as a Party Plaintiff, brought by the Board of\nSupervisors of Fairfax County, Virginia; was also granted. The\nTlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the\ndefendants, James T. Lynn, Secretary of the Department of Housing\n-and Urban Development (HUD), and Roy(cid:9) Ash, Director of the Office\nof Management and Budget . (OMB),_to begin reprocessing pending or\nnew applications for federal financial assistance in the Section\n235, 236 and rent supplement programs which were suspended by\nthe Secretary of HUD on January 8, 1973. Plaintiffs contend that they\nare directly aggrieved by Defendants' suspension of these programs\nand that Defendants' actions will prevent the completion of Plaintiffs'\nproposed projects and the inception of any new ones underthe applic-\nable statutory programs. They allege that HUD is required to\ncontinue implementation and operation of these programs and that\nthe Secretary's action is unlawful, unconstitutisonal and discriminatory.\nPlaintiffs have filed Motions for Preliminary Injunction and\nSummary Judy.itent. The latter Motion seeks to mace permanent the relief\nsought in the former, namely, the permanent enjoining of Defendants\nfrom refusing to accept applications for subsidLes, to process existing\nand new applications in accordance with the Defendants' own regulations\nand to approve and complete the processing of those projects. found\nby Defendants to be qualified under Defendants' own regulations.

A private sponsor\nwishing the build Section 235, 236 or 101 housing must make extensive\n- financial and organizational commitments before it can obtain a\nFeasibility Letter, in the case of Section 236, or a Fund ReServation,\nin the case of Section 235, which constitutes the government's initial\n•\nindication that a project may be eligible for approval.(cid:9) If an\napplication for Section 236 housing is approved after the applicant's\nsubmission of detailed plans and specifications, HUD will issue a\nFirm Commitment providing that it will insure a mortgage note in\na specified amount for the project.

The orders provided that as of January 5, 1973 no more\n----',-e-r'applfcations -would be accepted for projects under the programs; that---\nno-feasibility letters or fund reservations would be issued for\nPpIications-already on file; and that no conditional or firm commit-\ni\". mentS•yould-be_issued for any. project unless a feasibility letter or\n:::::-: fund:7reservation had already been issued prior to :the close of\nA:::.biisiness on-January 5, 1973. As of this .time, the total amount..of\n';.-unobligated contract authority available for Section 235, 236 and 101-\n10/\nprograms and thus withheld by the Defendants is $431,040.00\nII. THE CLASS ACTION ISSUE \nA. The Court Will Certify This Matter As a Class Action \nUnder Rules 23(b)(1)(A), 23(b)(1)(B) and 23(b)(2) of \nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nPlaintiffs have filed an Amended Complaint seeking to bring\nthis action on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly\nsituated. Defendants argue that the class action allegations should\ndismissed as .unmanageable because of the mass of unidentifiable_.\n- members of the alleged class.\nThe Court is of the opinion that this matter is properly maintain-\nable as a class action on behalf of all those who have participated in\nefforts to obtain nondiscriminatory access of minority and low and\nmoderate income persons to statutorily created housing subsidy,mort-\ngage loan insurance and rent supplement programs and particularly\nthose applicants or potential applicants for Section 235, 236 or 101\nsubsidies whose applications have not been or will not be processed, or\n, • who have been or will be deterred from filing such applications by virtue\n--tofrtho-Defendant Secretary's order of January 8,_1973..The prerequisites.'.\n10/ U.S. Dept. of Housing & Urban Development, Suromary of the HUD\nBudget, Fiscal Year 1974, p. HPMC 1-6 (1973).\n\n-7-\n11/\nof Rule 23(a) are clearly met.(cid:9) There is a commonality of interest\nin the basic question of law involved, i.e., whether the actions\nof the Secretary in suspending the subsidy programs were lawful,\nand the basic fact common to the membei-s of the class is simply that\ndc-ant':can7have7hisapplicationsidered as.-long as Defendants'_\n.order is in e,ffect. Moreover, Plains' suit fits appropriately:\nofithe:molds7avairabl_Eir Rule_23(b): It ._is appropriate\nI-\n:under. Rule 23_(b) (1) (A) in that -the-_pr-Zsecuticin of separate actions by\n•(cid:9) _.•\n- MeMbers Of...theLclass will create- thc—risk of inconsistent adjudications\n__.with_ respect t individualtriem-64.-the class which would establish__\nincompatible standards of cofiduct7lor. the Defendants. It is appropriate\nunder Rule 23 (b) (1) (B) in that an adjudication as to the individual\nPlaintiffs alone will as a practical matter be dispositive of the\ninterests of other members of the class not parties to the litigation.\nIt is appropriate under Rule 23(b) (2) in • that Defendants have acted on\n_grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate\ninjunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\nFinally, while the Court does not view this action as one brought\nprimarily to vindicate the denial of a civil right, the situation\npresented and the type of relief sought are closely analogous to a\ncivil rights suit, and the use of the class action in civil rights\ncontexts is so widespread as to not require citation.\nIII. THE MERITS OF PLAINTIFFS' CASE:\nISSUES\nThis case is ripe for action on the parties' Motions for\nSummary Judyment. The Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n-411/ Rule 23(a) lists four prerequisites to maintaini.ng a class action:\n. (1) the class is so numerous that .joinder of . a.11;members is\nimpracticable, (2) there-are questions of law or . fact common to\n::tt-,2-the . class, (3) the claims or_-defernses , of-the Trepresentative parties\nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.\n\n(cid:9)\n-8-\nhas been extensively briefed and argued in open court, and the\nparties have supplemented their arguments in their Motions for\nSummary Judgment. The issues raised by the various Motions are\nbascially the same, and the Court discerns no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact.\nNumerous issues have been raised by both sides to this litigation,\nbut the answers to two of them are dispostive. The first of these\n.basic-issues is whether the Secretary has the discretion and authority\nin the administration of the Section 235, 236 and 101 programs to\n:suspend their operation for program related reasons. The Second is\nwhether the Secretary's actions are a usurpation of legislative\nauthority granted to Congress by Article I of the Constitution.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Plaintiffs Have Been Directly Acrgrieved by the Secretarv's \nOrder of January 8, 1973, and As Such Have Standing to \nMaintain This Suit. \nAt the outset, the Court is met with Defendants' contention\nthat Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this litigation in that they\nhave not been directly aggrieved by the actions of the Defendants.\nDefendants argue that because HUD has not made any final commitments\nto any of the Plaintiffs, and since the Secretary's order was a\n\"suspension\" rather than a \"termination\" of the programs, Plaintiffs'\n* •(cid:9) —\nclaims of direct injury are merely speculative. This argument would\napply, of course, to all members of the class defined in II.A.,  supra.\nIn Sierra Club v. Morton, the Supreme Court stated that \"the\n'injury in fact' test [of standing] requires more than an injury to\na cognizable interest. It requires that the party seeking review be\n12/\n(cid:9)himself among the injured.\"(cid:9) It is difficult for the Court to under-\nstand how anyone could be more injured by the actions of the Defen-\ndants than the present Plaintiffs. Indeed, if the Court were to\naccept the Defendants' contentions it is clear that no one would be\n12/ Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 732 (1972).\n\nin a position to challenge the Secretary's actions for lack of\nstanding. Many of the Plaintiff private organizations have been\nor intended to be nonprofit sponsors of Section 235, 236 and 101\nhousing. They have expended time, money and effort in submitting or\n:preparing-to submit applications for subsidies under these programs.\nLikewise, the public Plaintiffs have expended time and money in\n-fostering sponsorship of and encouraging-applications-for federally'\n;..„. _assisted housing projects, including Section 235 and. 236 programs.\n=.7..t.:T 7-7,AI:1.0f-the Plaintiffs are directly interested in obtaining non- 7.::\ndiscriminatory access of minority and low and moderate income persons -\nto_statutorily created housing subsidy, mortgage loan insurance and\nrent supplement programs. Much of the time and money expended by\nthese Plaintiffs in. reliance on the HUD programs will be wasted by\nthe actions of the Defendants. It would be speculative for the Court\nto attempt to determine how many of the Plaintiff sponsors would\nultimately-qualify for financial assistance under the HUD programs.\nIt is not speculative to find(cid:9) under the present status quo that\nnone of the Plaintiffs will receive any assistance at all. There is\nno question but that these Plaintiffs have a \"direct stake\" in the\n13/\noutcome of this litigation.\n•\nB. Defendants' Defenses Of Sovereign Immunity,\n\"Political Question\" And Lack of Justici,-ble \nControversy Are Without Merit.\nDefendants have also raised the arguments that this e.Ction\nis barred as an unconsented suit against the sovereign, and that\nit presents a political question beyond the competence of the Court.\nIn support of the former, Defendants cite the general rule as stated\nby the Supreme Court in Land v. Dollar to the effect that a suit is\n13/ Sierra Club v. Morton, supra, at 740.\n\n-10-\nis. against the sovereign if \"the judgment sought would expend\nItself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the\n14/\npublic adminAstration.\"\nIt is. clear, however, that the relief sought in this litiga-\ntion will not have these effects, since such amounts of money\nas may be involved have already been appropriated by Congress.\nMoreover, the 'doctrine of sovereign immunity is inapplicable since\n•Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants' actions were beyond the scope\n 15/\n--of their statutory authority and were unconstitutional.(cid:9) Finally,\n-Plaintiffs are seeking review of administrative action pursuant to\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § ,Z701-706, which constitutes\nanother exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity within this\n16/\nCircuit, and partially provides the basis for the Court's juris-\ndiction over this action.\nDefendants' contention that this litigation presents a\npolitical question and as such is nonjusticiable is similarly with-\nout merit. Basically, Defendants assert that the Court is being asked\nto supervise and direct the actions of the Legislative and Executive\nbranches of the Government, that the issue of the Executive's power\nto determine the manner in which funds are ex pended is a question\nwhich is \"essentially political in nature,\" and that there is a\nlack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving\nthe dispute, citing, inter alia, Powell v. McCormack and Baker v. Carr \n17/\nas authorities for these propositions.(cid:9) The issues in this case,\n14/ 330 U.S. 731, 738 (1947).\n15/ Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 621-22 (1963); Larsen v.

The moneys in question have already been appropriated\nand the relief which Plaintiffs seek would only require Defendants to\naccept and process applications for such moneys, rather than the immed-\n18/\ndate disbursement of funds.(cid:9) Clearly it is ,within the province of\nthe Judicial branch to determine the nature of the Congressional\nmandate and whether the Defendants have refused to comply with that\nmandate. This case does not present a nonjusticiable political question.\nC. The Congressional Mandate Does Not Permit\nthe Suspension of Section 235, 236 and 101 \nPrograms, but Requires Their Continuation.\nDefendants contend that the Secretary of HUD has discretion in\nthe administration of the housing programs presently at issue and the\nauthority to suspend activities for program related reasons. It is\nasserted that HUD experienced difficulty in administering these pro-\ngrams in a manner consistent with Congressional intent as to the income\ngroups to be ,served by the programs and the availability of program\nbenefits in all parts of the United States. Because of this difficulty,\nthe Defendants argue that the Secretary, in a proper exercise of his\ndiscretion, suspended the operation of the housing programs pending\nfurther re-evaluation. The results of a re-evaluation study will allegedly\nbe ready for presentation to Congress by early September, 1973.\nThe fact that the Secretary is dissatisfied with these programs\nis immaterial if the Congressional mandate requires that they be\noperated on a continuing basis. The relevant statutes and legislative\nhistory demonstrate such a mandate.\n18/ To this extent, the case of Housing Authority of the City and \nCounty of San Francisco v. United States De partment of Housing and \nUrban Development, 340.F..Supp. 654 (N.D. Cal. 1972), is distinguish-\nable:.from the case at bar..:: In Housing Authority, the plaintiffs sough\n which apparently would have required the executive to spend\nthe full amounti.of appropriated funds. The court, finding no standards\nby which it could \"determine when or whether a breach of executive\nduty has occurred,\" dismissed the action.\n\nCongress' first declaration of national housing policy\nvas Section 2 of the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. §1441, the\nfoundation for all later federal housing assistance. Section 2\nstates in part:\n\"The Congress hereby declares that the general welfare\nand security of the Nation and the health and living\nstandards of its people require housing production and\nrelated community development sufficient to remedy the\nserious housing shortage, the elimination of substandard\nand other inadequate housing through ... the realization \nas soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home and a\nsuitable living environment for every American family.\nThe policy to be followed in attaining the national\nhousing objective hereby established shall be: (1) private\nenterprise shall be encouraged to serve as large a part of\nthe total need as it can; (2) governmental assistance shall\nbe utilized where feasible to enable private enterprise to .\nserve more of the total need. ... The Department of\nHousing and Urban Develo pment ... shall exercise [its)\npowers, functions, or duties under this or any other law,\nconsistently with the national housing  policy declared by\nwin \nthis Act and in such manner as  facilitate sustained\nprogress in attaining the national housing objective hereby\nestablished. (emphasis added) •\nCongress set the specific goal of production of 17-18 million\nhousing units. This was a \"specific congressional charge and directive\nto the administrative agencies of the Federal government\"; and was to\n19/\nbe attainedby 1960.(cid:9) The goal, however, was not met, and Congress\nacted again in 1965 by enacting the Housing Act of 1965, which funded\n20/\nand improved existing programs to keep them \"in full operation.\"\net\nThe 1965 Act also created the rent supplement program, §101, 12\nU.S.C. §1701s.\nDespite these efforts, the housing crisis continued to\nworsen, and Congress responded by enacting the Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Act of 1968, the chief provisions of which were Titles\nI and II, which added sections 235 and 236 to the National Housing\nAct; 12 U.S.C. §§1715z, 1717z-1.

These programs were the essential tool for\naccomplishing the quantitative goal of the construction or rej\nhabilitation of six million housing units for low and moderate\nincome families by 1978.\n\n-14--\nEach year after 1968, through Fiscal Year 1973, Congress\nhas increased the funding of Section 235, 236 and 101 programs.\nThe initial authorization of funds for Sections 235 and 236 was a\n21/\ntotal of $600 million, $300 million for each program.(cid:9) The 1968\nat, i_.Act...ualso_.authorized an increase up to $290, million–for Section . 10•\n22/\nrent supplements.(cid:9) By 1972, the total•grants authorized for Section\n235 were $890 million, for Section 236 $925 million, and for Section 101\n$433 million.

The actions of\nthe Secretary have frustrated that clear intent. Two months after\nthe Secretary's action, Congress described the harm to the national\n25/\nhousing program:\n\"[Subsidized]-housing starts for FY 75 will be\nvirtually zero even if it is decided to reactivate\nthe program at the expiration of the(cid:9) moratorium.\nOnce all the units in the pipeline are constructed,\nit will take at least another year to reach mean-\ningful housing production levels.\"\nThe distinction which the Defendants have attempted to draw between\nthis case and other cases which have overturned Executive branch\ndeterminations to terminate or suspend programs contrary to\nCongressional enactment is without merit, for whether the Secretary's\nsuspension of these housing programs is program related or not, the\n26/\nsimple fact is that the programs are not in operation.

The Secretary's Actions Violate The \nDuties Imposed On The Executive By\nArticle II Of The Constitution. \nWhen the programs involved in this litigation were suspended,\nthen Secretary Romney, in a speech delivered on January 8, 1973,\nindicated the reasons underlying the suspension. He stated that\nwhat the Executive branch desired was .a \"searching evaluation, and\n27/\n. hopefully new program enactment.(cid:9) While Congress was evaluating\nwhether to enact new programs, the existing programs would be\nstopped -- there would be no \"business as usual.\" These activities\nwere followed up by the President, who submitted the budget for\nthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1974 without requesting any new\n29/\nmoney for Section 235, 236 and 101 programs.(cid:9) In-an explanatory\naddress to the nation on March 4, 1973, the President proposed that\na number of programs, including those involved in this action, would\nbe replaced by revenue sharing.

It is certainly true that such powers have long\nbeen interpreted as broad grants of authority necessary to the\nfulfillment of the many and varied duties imposed upon the President\nand the Executive branch. It is not true that the Executive has\nthe authority to terminate or suspend indefinitely a statutory\nprogram such as that involved here for the reason. that Congress\nmay see fit to alter those programs at some date in the future.\nCongress has mandated that the programs continue.

A later\nMotion to Intervene as a Party Plaintiff, brought by the Board of\nSupervisors of Fairfax County, Virginia; was also granted. The\nTlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the\ndefendants, James T. Lynn, Secretary of the Department of Housing\n-and Urban Development (HUD), and Roy(cid:9) Ash, Director of the Office\nof Management and Budget . (OMB),_to begin reprocessing pending or\nnew applications for federal financial assistance in the Section\n235, 236 and rent supplement programs which were suspended by\nthe Secretary of HUD on January 8, 1973. Plaintiffs contend that they\nare directly aggrieved by Defendants' suspension of these programs\nand that Defendants' actions will prevent the completion of Plaintiffs'\nproposed projects and the inception of any new ones underthe applic-\nable statutory programs. They allege that HUD is required to\ncontinue implementation and operation of these programs and that\nthe Secretary's action is unlawful, unconstitutisonal and discriminatory.\nPlaintiffs have filed Motions for Preliminary Injunction and\nSummary Judy.itent.

THE MERITS OF PLAINTIFFS' CASE:\nISSUES\nThis case is ripe for action on the parties' Motions for\nSummary Judyment. The Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n-411/ Rule 23(a) lists four prerequisites to maintaini.ng a class action:\n. (1) the class is so numerous that .joinder of . a.11;members is\nimpracticable, (2) there-are questions of law or . fact common to\n::tt-,2-the . class, (3) the claims or_-defernses , of-the Trepresentative parties\nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.\n\n(cid:9)\n-8-\nhas been extensively briefed and argued in open court, and the\nparties have supplemented their arguments in their Motions for\nSummary Judgment. The issues raised by the various Motions are\nbascially the same, and the Court discerns no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact.\nNumerous issues have been raised by both sides to this litigation,\nbut the answers to two of them are dispostive. The first of these\n.basic-issues is whether the Secretary has the discretion and authority\nin the administration of the Section 235, 236 and 101 programs to\n:suspend their operation for program related reasons. The Second is\nwhether the Secretary's actions are a usurpation of legislative\nauthority granted to Congress by Article I of the Constitution.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Plaintiffs Have Been Directly Acrgrieved by the Secretarv's \nOrder of January 8, 1973, and As Such Have Standing to \nMaintain This Suit. \nAt the outset, the Court is met with Defendants' contention\nthat Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this litigation in that they\nhave not been directly aggrieved by the actions of the Defendants.\nDefendants argue that because HUD has not made any final commitments\nto any of the Plaintiffs, and since the Secretary's order was a\n\"suspension\" rather than a \"termination\" of the programs, Plaintiffs'\n* •(cid:9) —\nclaims of direct injury are merely speculative. This argument would\napply, of course, to all members of the class defined in II.A.,  supra.\nIn Sierra Club v. Morton, the Supreme Court stated that \"the\n'injury in fact' test [of standing] requires more than an injury to\na cognizable interest. It requires that the party seeking review be\n12/\n(cid:9)himself among the injured.\"(cid:9) It is difficult for the Court to under-\nstand how anyone could be more injured by the actions of the Defen-\ndants than the present Plaintiffs. Indeed, if the Court were to\naccept the Defendants' contentions it is clear that no one would be\n12/ Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 732 (1972).\n\nin a position to challenge the Secretary's actions for lack of\nstanding. Many of the Plaintiff private organizations have been\nor intended to be nonprofit sponsors of Section 235, 236 and 101\nhousing. They have expended time, money and effort in submitting or\n:preparing-to submit applications for subsidies under these programs.\nLikewise, the public Plaintiffs have expended time and money in\n-fostering sponsorship of and encouraging-applications-for federally'\n;..„. _assisted housing projects, including Section 235 and. 236 programs.\n=.7..t.:T 7-7,AI:1.0f-the Plaintiffs are directly interested in obtaining non- 7.::\ndiscriminatory access of minority and low and moderate income persons -\nto_statutorily created housing subsidy, mortgage loan insurance and\nrent supplement programs. Much of the time and money expended by\nthese Plaintiffs in. reliance on the HUD programs will be wasted by\nthe actions of the Defendants. It would be speculative for the Court\nto attempt to determine how many of the Plaintiff sponsors would\nultimately-qualify for financial assistance under the HUD programs.\nIt is not speculative to find(cid:9) under the present status quo that\nnone of the Plaintiffs will receive any assistance at all. There is\nno question but that these Plaintiffs have a \"direct stake\" in the\n13/\noutcome of this litigation.\n•\nB. Defendants' Defenses Of Sovereign Immunity,\n\"Political Question\" And Lack of Justici,-ble \nControversy Are Without Merit.\nDefendants have also raised the arguments that this e.Ction\nis barred as an unconsented suit against the sovereign, and that\nit presents a political question beyond the competence of the Court.\nIn support of the former, Defendants cite the general rule as stated\nby the Supreme Court in Land v. Dollar to the effect that a suit is\n13/ Sierra Club v. Morton, supra, at 740.\n\n-10-\nis. against the sovereign if \"the judgment sought would expend\nItself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the\n14/\npublic adminAstration.\"\nIt is. clear, however, that the relief sought in this litiga-\ntion will not have these effects, since such amounts of money\nas may be involved have already been appropriated by Congress.\nMoreover, the 'doctrine of sovereign immunity is inapplicable since\n•Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants' actions were beyond the scope\n 15/\n--of their statutory authority and were unconstitutional.(cid:9) Finally,\n-Plaintiffs are seeking review of administrative action pursuant to\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § ,Z701-706, which constitutes\nanother exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity within this\n16/\nCircuit, and partially provides the basis for the Court's juris-\ndiction over this action.\nDefendants' contention that this litigation presents a\npolitical question and as such is nonjusticiable is similarly with-\nout merit. Basically, Defendants assert that the Court is being asked\nto supervise and direct the actions of the Legislative and Executive\nbranches of the Government, that the issue of the Executive's power\nto determine the manner in which funds are ex pended is a question\nwhich is \"essentially political in nature,\" and that there is a\nlack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving\nthe dispute, citing, inter alia, Powell v. McCormack and Baker v. Carr \n17/\nas authorities for these propositions.(cid:9) The issues in this case,\n14/ 330 U.S. 731, 738 (1947).\n15/ Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 621-22 (1963); Larsen v.

The moneys in question have already been appropriated\nand the relief which Plaintiffs seek would only require Defendants to\naccept and process applications for such moneys, rather than the immed-\n18/\ndate disbursement of funds.(cid:9) Clearly it is ,within the province of\nthe Judicial branch to determine the nature of the Congressional\nmandate and whether the Defendants have refused to comply with that\nmandate. This case does not present a nonjusticiable political question.\nC. The Congressional Mandate Does Not Permit\nthe Suspension of Section 235, 236 and 101 \nPrograms, but Requires Their Continuation.\nDefendants contend that the Secretary of HUD has discretion in\nthe administration of the housing programs presently at issue and the\nauthority to suspend activities for program related reasons. It is\nasserted that HUD experienced difficulty in administering these pro-\ngrams in a manner consistent with Congressional intent as to the income\ngroups to be ,served by the programs and the availability of program\nbenefits in all parts of the United States. Because of this difficulty,\nthe Defendants argue that the Secretary, in a proper exercise of his\ndiscretion, suspended the operation of the housing programs pending\nfurther re-evaluation. The results of a re-evaluation study will allegedly\nbe ready for presentation to Congress by early September, 1973.\nThe fact that the Secretary is dissatisfied with these programs\nis immaterial if the Congressional mandate requires that they be\noperated on a continuing basis. The relevant statutes and legislative\nhistory demonstrate such a mandate.\n18/ To this extent, the case of Housing Authority of the City and \nCounty of San Francisco v. United States De partment of Housing and \nUrban Development, 340.F..Supp. 654 (N.D. Cal. 1972), is distinguish-\nable:.from the case at bar..:: In Housing Authority, the plaintiffs sough\n which apparently would have required the executive to spend\nthe full amounti.of appropriated funds. The court, finding no standards\nby which it could \"determine when or whether a breach of executive\nduty has occurred,\" dismissed the action.\n\nCongress' first declaration of national housing policy\nvas Section 2 of the Housing Act of 1949, 42 U.S.C. §1441, the\nfoundation for all later federal housing assistance. Section 2\nstates in part:\n\"The Congress hereby declares that the general welfare\nand security of the Nation and the health and living\nstandards of its people require housing production and\nrelated community development sufficient to remedy the\nserious housing shortage, the elimination of substandard\nand other inadequate housing through ... the realization \nas soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home and a\nsuitable living environment for every American family.\nThe policy to be followed in attaining the national\nhousing objective hereby established shall be: (1) private\nenterprise shall be encouraged to serve as large a part of\nthe total need as it can; (2) governmental assistance shall\nbe utilized where feasible to enable private enterprise to .\nserve more of the total need. ... The Department of\nHousing and Urban Develo pment ... shall exercise [its)\npowers, functions, or duties under this or any other law,\nconsistently with the national housing  policy declared by\nwin \nthis Act and in such manner as  facilitate sustained\nprogress in attaining the national housing objective hereby\nestablished. (emphasis added) •\nCongress set the specific goal of production of 17-18 million\nhousing units. This was a \"specific congressional charge and directive\nto the administrative agencies of the Federal government\"; and was to\n19/\nbe attainedby 1960.(cid:9) The goal, however, was not met, and Congress\nacted again in 1965 by enacting the Housing Act of 1965, which funded\n20/\nand improved existing programs to keep them \"in full operation.\"\net\nThe 1965 Act also created the rent supplement program, §101, 12\nU.S.C. §1701s.\nDespite these efforts, the housing crisis continued to\nworsen, and Congress responded by enacting the Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Act of 1968, the chief provisions of which were Titles\nI and II, which added sections 235 and 236 to the National Housing\nAct; 12 U.S.C. §§1715z, 1717z-1.

These programs were the essential tool for\naccomplishing the quantitative goal of the construction or rej\nhabilitation of six million housing units for low and moderate\nincome families by 1978.\n\n-14--\nEach year after 1968, through Fiscal Year 1973, Congress\nhas increased the funding of Section 235, 236 and 101 programs.\nThe initial authorization of funds for Sections 235 and 236 was a\n21/\ntotal of $600 million, $300 million for each program.(cid:9) The 1968\nat, i_.Act...ualso_.authorized an increase up to $290, million–for Section . 10•\n22/\nrent supplements.(cid:9) By 1972, the total•grants authorized for Section\n235 were $890 million, for Section 236 $925 million, and for Section 101\n$433 million. Appropriations have likewise kept pace, and in Fiscal\nYear 1973, the cumulative total for Section 235 programs was $665\nmillion, for Section 236 programs $700 million, and for Section 101\n23/\nprograms $330 million.\nAmong the President's roles under the HUD Act of 1968 was\nthe requirement of Section 1602, 42 U.S.C. §1441b, that he submit to\nCongress, in January 1969,a detailed plan \"to be carried out over a\nperiod of ten years [June 30, 1968, to June 30, 1978] for the\nelimination of all substandard housing and the realization of the\ngoal ... .\" Section 1603, 42 U.S.C. §1441c, required the President\nto submit, in each of the ten years, a detailed annual progress report.\nSection 1603(2) provides that if the objectives for any year set in\nthe ten year plan have not been met, the President shall tell the\nCongress in his next annual report \"the reasons for such failure, .\nthe steps being taken to achieve the objectives of the plan\" during\nthe rest of the ten year period, and \"any necessary revision in the\nobjectives.\" The reason for this objective was\n\"that the stating in definite terms of annual minimum\nhousing goals with this added requirement of giving\n.21/ P.L. 90-446, §.;.3101(a), 201(a), 82 Stat. 477, 498 (1968).\n22/ Id., §202(a).\n.23/ U.S. Dept. of Housing & Urban Development, Summary of the HUD\nBudget, Fiscal Year 1974, p.

The actions of\nthe Secretary have frustrated that clear intent. Two months after\nthe Secretary's action, Congress described the harm to the national\n25/\nhousing program:\n\"[Subsidized]-housing starts for FY 75 will be\nvirtually zero even if it is decided to reactivate\nthe program at the expiration of the(cid:9) moratorium.\nOnce all the units in the pipeline are constructed,\nit will take at least another year to reach mean-\ningful housing production levels.\"\nThe distinction which the Defendants have attempted to draw between\nthis case and other cases which have overturned Executive branch\ndeterminations to terminate or suspend programs contrary to\nCongressional enactment is without merit, for whether the Secretary's\nsuspension of these housing programs is program related or not, the\n26/\nsimple fact is that the programs are not in operation.

If a decision to suspend\nor terminate these programs is made, it•shall be made by Congress.\nThe decision of the Secretary to suspend them was in excess of his\nauthority and contrary to law. and the Court has jurisdiction under\n28 U.S.C. §1361 to compel him to perform his duty.,\nD. The Secretary's Actions Violate The \nDuties Imposed On The Executive By\nArticle II Of The Constitution. \nWhen the programs involved in this litigation were suspended,\nthen Secretary Romney, in a speech delivered on January 8, 1973,\nindicated the reasons underlying the suspension. He stated that\nwhat the Executive branch desired was .a \"searching evaluation, and\n27/\n. hopefully new program enactment.(cid:9) While Congress was evaluating\nwhether to enact new programs, the existing programs would be\nstopped -- there would be no \"business as usual.\" These activities\nwere followed up by the President, who submitted the budget for\nthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1974 without requesting any new\n29/\nmoney for Section 235, 236 and 101 programs.(cid:9) In-an explanatory\naddress to the nation on March 4, 1973, the President proposed that\na number of programs, including those involved in this action, would\nbe replaced by revenue sharing.

The Court finds unpersuasive:\nDefendants' arguments that the challenged actions are in accord-\nance with powers granted to the Executive by Article II of the\nConstitution. It is certainly true that such powers have long\nbeen interpreted as broad grants of authority necessary to the\nfulfillment of the many and varied duties imposed upon the President\nand the Executive branch. It is not true that the Executive has\nthe authority to terminate or suspend indefinitely a statutory\nprogram such as that involved here for the reason. that Congress\nmay see fit to alter those programs at some date in the future.\nCongress has mandated that the programs continue.

Construction is induced, however, by the sponsor’s reasonable reliance on firm reservation of \ncontract authority. \n \n5  Also suspended were the Section 23 public housing leasing program, 42 U.S.C. § 1421b, the Section 106 program of \n  assistance to non-profit sponsors of low and moderate income housing, 12 U.S.C. § 1701x, and a number of \ncommunity development programs and subsidy programs directed to the problems of rural housing. E.g., Section \n521 interest credit program, which was ordered resumed in Pealo v. Farmers Home Administration, 361 F.Supp. \n1320 (D.D.C.1973). The Section 23 leasing program was later resumed. 119 Cong.Rec. H8073 (daily ed. Sept. 19, \n1973). \n \n6  The suspension did not purport to dishonor commitments already made. Thus, on January 8, 1973, the Secretary of \n  HUD directed all HUD field offices, until further notice, to: \n(1) issue no further conditional commitments under Section 235 except pursuant to firm reservations of contract \nauthority issued to developers on or before close of business January 5, 1973 and (2) issue no feasibility letters or \nmake fund reservations under Section 236 or under the Section 101 rent supplement program after the close of \nbusiness January 5, 1973. \n \n7  H.R.Doc.No.57, 93d Cong., 1st Sess.

See Complaint P1(b). Since, in our view, the authority to suspend the programs for the purpose of \ndeciding whether to terminate them necessarily entails the latter power, we attach no significance to the semantic \ndispute. In the Secretary’s view, he terminated these programs only after completion of the study evaluating their \nviability, the same time at which he resumed operating the Section 23 program. Indeed, the September termination \nwas itself qualified, since the President lifted the suspension as to ‘subsidy applications for units which had moved \nmost of the way through the application process by January 5 (1973).’ 119 Cong.Rec. H8073 (daily ed. Sept. 19, \n1973). The applications here referred to were clearly distinct from those left unaffected by the suspension order, \nsee note 6 supra, for the President’s next sentence was that, ‘in addition, the Department will process applications \nin cases where bona fide commitments have been made.’ (Emphasis added.) \n \n11  Appellant renews in this court his argument that the case presents a non-justiciable political question, and seeks to \n  ‘preserve’ the objection of sovereign immunity, which he recognizes to be contrary to the prior decisions of this \ncourt. We reject both arguments on the basis of the opinion below. As to sovereign immunity, we note in addition \nthat 12 U.S.C. § 1702 provides in part that ‘the Secretary shall, in carrying out the provisions of (subchapter II of \nchapter 13, title 12) be authorized in his official capacity, to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, \nState or Federal.’ Both the 235 and 236 programs are established under subchapter II of chapter 13, title 12. \n \n12  Brief of Appellees at 17, 35. In a speech on January 8, the day of the suspension, Secretary Romney said that by 1970 \n  ‘it was clear that literally billions and billions of dollars of hard-earned taxpayer money were being wasted, \nparticularly in our central cities, and that hundreds of thousands of our most needy and disadvantaged citizens, for \nwhom the taxpayers were generously making important financial sacrifices, not only would not benefit, but would \nbe victimized and disillusioned.’ Remarks before the 29th Annual Convention of the National Ass’n of Home \nBuilders, at Houston, Texas, HUD News Release (Jan. 8, 1973) at 7-8, J.A. 26, 33-34. \n \n13  Setting National Priorities: The 1972 Budget 136. \n \n \n14  Each section provides that ‘the aggregate amount of the contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts \n  approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed’ specified annual \nauthorizations. 12 U.S.C. §§ 1701s(a), 1715z(h)(1), 1715z-1(i)(1). Cumulative authorizations and appropriations \nthrough Fiscal 1973 are (in millions of dollars): \n \n15  We do not understand the Secretary to claim discretion to suspend or terminate the programs merely because they \n  have not worked, but only because, in his judgment, they cannot work no matter how administered. \n13 \n \n\n \n \nCom. of Pa. v.

Fourth Annual Report \non National Housing Goals, H.Doc.No.92-319, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 44 (1972). \n \n27  The Congress has authorized the Secretary to make contracts that commit the United States to paying up to $2,248 \n  million per year for the three programs taken together. See note 14 supra. On January 8, 1973, the Secretary had \nunused obligational authority of $431 million. In a letter to Senator Sparkman dated November 8, 1973, he reported \nthat authority still unused as of June 30, 1973, totaled $360.8 million. \nIt is important to bear in mind that the budgetary impact of each commitment made is felt over the life of the \nproject approved. The actual cost of using a dollar of obligational authority therefore depends upon the length of \nthe commitment. Thus, whether a dollar of authority is used to enter a ten-year or a forty-year contract, remaining \ncontract authority is reduced by only one dollar although the actual run-out cost is $10 in the former instance and \n$40 in the latter. With less than $2 billion of contract authority obligated, therefore, it is estimated that the runout \ncost of the programs is already $85.7 billion.

Fisher, Presidential Spending Discretion and Congressional Controls, 37 Law & Contemp.Prob. 135, 171 (1972): \n \nAppropriations are made many months, and sometimes years, in advance of expenditures. Congress acts with \nimperfect knowledge in trying to legislate in fields that are highly technical and constantly undergoing change. New \ncircumstances will develop to make obsolete and mistaken the decisions reached by Congress at the appropriation \nstage. It is not practicable for Congress to adjust to these new developments by passing large numbers of \nsupplemental appropriation bills. Were Congress to control expenditures by confining administrators to narrow \nstatutory details it would perhaps protect its power of the purse but it would not protect the purse itself. Discretion \nis needed for the sound management of public funds. \n \n32  ‘The axiom that courts should endeavor to give statutory language that meaning that nurtures the policies \n  underlying legislation is one that guides us when circumstances not plainly covered by the terms of a statute are \nsubsumed by the underlying policies to which Congress was committed.’ United States v. Sisson, 399 U.S. 267, \n297-298, 90 S.Ct. 2117, 2133, 26 L.Ed.2d 608 (1970). \n \n33  In some instances ‘the most revealing legislative expressions’ of intent occur not in legislative history but in \n  response to events subsequent to enactment.

Butz, slip op. at 11 (D.D.C.Civ.Action No. \n1210-73, Aug. 3, 1973). \n \n34  The House Rules Committee recently analyzed the problems involved in judicial resolution of ‘impoundment \n  questions.’ Impoundment Control and 1974 Expenditure Ceiling, H.Rep.No.93-336, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1973). It \nfeared the potential for error when a court ‘examine(s) the intent of Congress, perhaps imperfectly expressed, when \nit enacted an appropriation or obligational authority in some previous year. Any court must face considerable \ndifficulty in deciding what Congress means in 1973 when it has to construe a measure enacted in 1970.’ As a result, \nthe Committee feared that the court’s own policy judgments ‘about relative spending priorities in the context of \ncurrent needs and economic conditions’ might color its decision. In this case, the unusual extent to which Congress \nhas clarified its intent, as detailed below, and the Committee’s own efforts in alerting the courts to this problem, \ngive reason to hope that we have not fallen prey to this particular frailty. \n \n35  Hearings on the Moratorium on Subsidized Housing Before the Subcomm. on Housing of the House Comm. on \n  Banking and Currency, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973) (Comm.

Id. at 55-57 (questions 4(b) and 5(b) submitted in \nwriting to the Secretary and inserted in the record with his answers). \nIn contrast is the Report of the Subcomm. on Priorities and Economy in Government of the Joint Economic Comm., \nHousing Subsidies and Housing Policy 5 (March 5, 1973) (Comm.

Lynn, 501 F.2d 848 (1974)   \n163 U.S.App.D.C. 288 \n \nsuspension, was based on research and hearings prior thereto. The majority suggested that the suspension ‘and \nsimilar announcements affecting other programs’ raise the most serious constitutional issue . . ..’ They recognized \nthe need for some executive discretion in the management of federal funds’ but objected vehemently to any \nsubstantial failure to implement programs for which Congress has authorized and appropriated funds. It is apparent, \nhowever, that they viewed the suspension as directed at the control of inflation, id., and not at ‘the questions which \nhave arisen concerning the effectiveness of subsidized housing programs,’ which had been the Subcommittee’s \nconcern in holding hearings. Id. at 3. Since it is established for purposes of this litigation that the suspension was \n‘program related,’ see text at notes 12-13, supra, the Subcommittee’s opposition to it cannot be taken as endorsing \nthe view that the relevant statutes prohibit a suspension for any reason under any circumstances. \n \n37  119 Cong.Rec.

Indeed  only  Representatives  Abzug  and  Holtzman  challenged  the  legality  of  the  housing  subsidy \nmoratorium, and this on constitutional grounds. 119 Cong.Rec. H5209-10. It is clear, at least in Mrs. Abzug’s case, \nthat this was done only after rejecting the bona fides of the Secretary’s reasons for suspension. See note 36, supra. \n \n40  S.Rep.No.93-272, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (June 28, 1973).

Part 1 of the report, which contains a description and analysis of all federal \n  housing activities, was lodged with this court per our order of November 2, 1973. \n \n46  Consequently, the subsidiary question of whether the Secretary abused his discretion or acted arbitrarily in refusing \n  to accept or process applications for subsidy up to but not including the issuance of commitments, thereby \nminimizing disruption of the ‘pipeline’ in the event that the programs were resumed, is a question mooted by the \nlater decision to terminate them, and we do not address it. \n \n47  See 1 K. Davis, Admin. L. Treatise § 7.06, at 430 (1958). \n \n \n48  As quantified in 1968, this objective became a goal of ‘twenty-six million housing units, six million of these for low \n  and moderate income families.’ 42 U.S.C. § 1441a. \n \n49  Congress set no minimum income on eligibility for Section 235 or 236 subsidy, but did set a maximum expressed in \n  terms of 135% Of the ‘maximum income limits which can be established in the area . . . for initial occupancy in public \nhousing dwellings.’ Twenty per cent of the payments made under each program could be for families with incomes \nin excess of that figure but less than ninety per cent of the income limit prescribed by the Secretary for occupants of \nprojects financed with mortgages insured under 12 U.S.C. § 1715l(d) (3) and (5). \n \n50  The Congress’s intent to concentrate homeownership (and rental) subsidies among lower income beneficiaries is \n  unambiguous.  The  Administration-supported  bill,  H.R.  17989,  which  passed  the  House,  had  provided  for \n‘Homeownership for Low and Moderate Income Families.’ The Senate bill was enacted after the Conference \nCommittee had substituted much of the House language, but it retained the Senate description of Section 235, \n‘Homeownership for Lower Income Families.’ The Congress had already amended the Administration bill by adding \nincome eligibility maxima, and the Conference Committee further tightened these, and added the provision last \nquoted in the text and another directing the Secretary to report semiannually to a committee of each house on the \nincome levels of families receiving a subsidy. The Conferees also amended the provision for insurance of mortgages \nexecuted by non-profit sponsors to finance the purchase, rehabilitation, and resale of homes so as to exclude any \nbut lower income vendees. See 12 U.S.C. § 1715z(j)(4)(A). \n \n51  The following information relating to the three programs is drawn from the Secretary’s study, Housing in the \n  Seventies, supra note 27, unless otherwise indicated. The study was conducted under the direction of the Assistant \nSecretary for Policy Development and Research by more than one hundred analysts drawn from throughout the \n18 \n \n\n \n \nCom. of Pa. v. Lynn, 501 F.2d 848 (1974)   \n163 U.S.App.D.C. 288 \n \nExecutive Branch and organized into five study teams. Information was solicited and received from members of \nCongress and committee staffs, public and private interest groups, and the general public pursuant to a notice in the \nFederal Register. 38 Fed.Reg. 8685 (Apr. 5, 1973); extended, 38 Fed.Reg. 14302 (May 31, 1973). \n \n52  12 U.S.C. 1715z(b)(2) (third proviso) (1970), amending 12 U.S.C. 1715z(b) (2) (third proviso) (Supp. IV, 1968). \n \n \n53  Measured in terms of the total subsidy paid to households in an income class and spread among all households in \n  that income class, the subsidy increases with every increase of $1,000 income from $3,000 to $7,000 and then \ndeclines. The subsidy to families in the $3,000 to $4,000 group, for example, is $.19 for each such family in the \ncountry. For the succeeding targeted income groups, the figures are $1.52, $7.70, $18.03, and $20.83. The subsidy \npaid per household in the $7,000 to $8,000 group was $14.80; in the $8,000 to $10,000 group, $6.71; and above \n$10,000, $.21. \n \n54  E.g., 3 1973 Appropriations Hearings, supra note 25, passim; Surveys and Investigations Staff, House Comm. on \n  Appropriations, Report, in id. at 1294, 1316-25; Staff of the House Comm. on Banking and Currency, Investigation \nand Hearing of Abuses in Federal Low and Moderate Income Housing Programs, 91st Cong., 2d Sess.

The structure of Section 235 may create incentives for these abuses, but it does not put \nthem inexorably beyond the reach of corrective action by the administrator. \n \n57  Section 236 housing may be built by profit, nonprofit, or cooperative enterprises. A profit-making enterprise is \n  limited to a six per cent cash return on investment, but realizes substantial additional tax benefits during the \ndevelopment of the project. Certain construction period expenses ordinarily of a capital nature are immediately \ndeductible. Accelerated depreciation of the project cost basis generates a tax loss that can shelter other income. \nThis effect is magnified by the high loan-to-value ratio available, enabling a smaller than conventional equity \ninvestment to leverage a higher ratio of depreciable basis to equity. Furthermore, the forty year amortization period \nloads the early year payments with a greater component of deductible interest than obtains under conventional \n20-25 year financing. \n \n58  Tenants pay the greater of the ‘basic rent’ or 25% Of their adjusted incomes but no more than the ‘market rent,’ \n  composed of operating expenses, amortization at the FHA ceiling rate, and the mortgage insurance payment. The \n19 \n \n\n \n \nCom. of Pa. v. Lynn, 501 F.2d 848 (1974)   \n163 U.S.App.D.C. 288 \n \namount of subsidy is the difference between the market rent and what the tenant is paying. \n \n59  HUD Office of Audit, Report on Audit of Section 236 Multifamily Housing Program (05-02-2001-5000, Jan. 29, 1972) \n  (Exhibit 2) reported that 85.05% Of tenants paid only the basic rent and thus received the maximum subsidy, while \nonly 1.54 per cent paid the full market rent. \n \n60  The actual cost of Section 236 housing, taking account of tax revenue foregone in order to induce sponsorship by \n  taxable sponsors, would of course increase the disparity. The estimated revenue cost discounted to present value is \n$1,446 per unit. \n \n61  If adjusted to reflect neighborhood quality the disparity would have been greater. \n \n \n62  Apparently some projects include swimming pools and apartments with amenities such as dishwashers. Survey and \n  Investigations Staff, Report in 3 1973 Appropriations Hearings, supra note 25, at 1310. \n \n63  See id., at 1315; General Accounting Office, Report to the Congress: Opportunities to Improve Effectiveness and \n  Reduce Costs of Rental Assistance Housing Program (B-171630, Jan. 10, 1974); HUD Office of Audit, supra note 59. \n \n64  Cf. Mandina v. Lynn, 357 F.Supp. 269 (W.D.Mo.1973). \n \n \n65  The court conceptualized the relevant class as being composed of ‘all those who have participated in efforts to \n  obtain nondiscriminatory access of minority and low and moderate income persons to statutorily created housing \nsubsidy, mortgage loan insurance and rent supplement programs and particularly those applicants or potential \napplicants for Section 235, 236, or 101 subsidies whose applications have not been or will not be processed, or who \nhave been or will be deterred from filing such applications because of the suspension order of January 8.’ \nPast participation in efforts to obtain nondiscriminatory subsidized housing is clearly not sufficient to establish \nstanding for present equitable relief. Cf. Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972). \nMore importantly, the district court erred in its use of the disjunctive respecting ‘applicants for Section 235, 236 or \n101 subsidies.’ There can be no applicants under Section 101 who are not also applicants or sponsors under another \nprogram; in this case, that other program must be Section 236. \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \n\n \n \nCom. of Pa. v.
