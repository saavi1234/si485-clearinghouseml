    "summary": "<p>This class action suit, filed on March 15, 2018, sought to enjoin the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from detaining asylum seekers in order to deter other potential migrants from seeking refuge in the United States. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, were asylum seekers who had been detained without individualized determinations that they posed a flight risk or danger to the community. The plaintiffs sued DHS and alleged violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and assigned to Judge James E. Boasberg.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs stated that, upon arriving in the U.S., the government determined they had a credible fear of persecution and referred them to immigration courts for further assessment of their asylum claims. In the meantime, DHS detained them and did not provide individualized review of the need for detention. The plaintiffs argued that they were not detained due to individualized assessments that they pose a flight risk or danger to the community, but rather because DHS wanted to deter other migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs argued that DHS adopted this broad policy of detaining asylum seekers at five Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices--the offices in Detroit, El Paso, Los Angeles, Newark, and Philadelphia--on the basis that it would deter other migrants. The plaintiffs argued this policy was in violation of a 2015 opinion from this district court, as well as Supreme Court precedent holding that such general deterrence interests can inform criminal but not civil detention and that a conclusory national security interest was not sufficient to support the policy.</p>\r\n<p>On March 20, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class, defined in the complaint as: \"(1) All arriving asylum seekers; (2) who are found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture; and (3) who are or will be detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; (4) after having been denied parole under the authority of ICE&rsquo;s Detroit, El Paso, Los Angeles, Newark, or Philadelphia Field Office.\"</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs then moved for a preliminary injunction on March 30, 2018, seeking to enjoin the government from continuing to apply its deterrence policy. On April 24, 2018, the government moved to dismiss the case, claiming that the court should dismiss the complaint in its entirety because the court lacked jurisdiction to grant constitutional injunctive relief and because the complaint failed to allege facts that, taken as true, could plausibly demonstrate that the alleged unlawful deterrence policy exists.</p>\r\n<p>On July 2, finding that the circumstances warranted extraordinary relief, Judge Boasberg granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction and granted class certification on a provisional basis for purposes of the preliminary injunction. Judge Boasberg held that it was likely that DHS had a policy or practice of detaining asylum seekers in violation of its own guidance or regulations, and so he ordered the government to follow a 2009 ICE Parole Directive--a set of principles and procedures establishing the processes by which the agency must determine whether an asylum seeker will be detained or released pending their immigration hearing. The court enjoined the defendants from denying parole to any provisional class member without first giving an individualized determination, through the parole process, that such provisional class member presented a flight risk or a danger to the community. Moreover, Judge Boasberg required that the individualized determinations be based on the specific facts of each provisional class member&rsquo;s case rather than categorical criteria applicable to all provisional class members.</p>\r\n<p>The court then held the motion to dismiss in abeyance as the parties worked together to implement the injunction and resolve outstanding issues outside of the courtroom. On Oct. 22, 2018 the court permitted the plaintiffs to conduct discovery for the limited purpose of determining if the government was complying with the preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>In a December 21, 2018 status report, the plaintiffs reported concerns about the defendants' noncompliance with the court's preliminary injunction order.</p>\r\n<p>On February 28, 2019, Judge Boasberg filed an opinion and order granting in part and denying in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. He denied the motion as to the plaintiffs' APA and due process claims, but granted it as to certain defendants, dismissing them from the case. He found that his prior opinion foreclosed most of the defendants' arguments as to the plaintiffs' APA claims, and that he did not need to weigh in on the due process claim, as a decision at this point would not affect the outcome of the case. 2019 WL 1003440.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed the administrative record on April 8.</p>\r\n<p>On April 11, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a finding of civil contempt against the Los Angeles ICE Field Office for alleged ongoing violations of the court's preliminary injunction. They also requested that the court appoint a special master to oversee the Field Office's compliance with the injunction.</p>\r\n<p>In a July 3 telephonic status conference, Judge Boasberg ordered the plaintiffs' motion for contempt to be held in abeyance pending the parole-grant rates to be disclosed in the defendants' next report. He noted that the rates at the Los Angeles Field Office had risen in the last report.</p>\r\n<p>On July 19, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and a permanent injunction. On September 20, the defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On January 29, 2020, the parties filed a joint status report proposing that they withdraw their pending motions for summary judgment and that the court set a new briefing schedule to give the plaintiffs sufficient time to review any supplementation of the administrative record that may occur, as the defendants had recently completed collecting documents from the ICE field offices. The court entered an order to effectuate the parties' requests.</p>\r\n<p>On February 7, Judge Boasberg issued an opinion and order denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for contempt. Judge Boasberg noted that he was denying the motion because the defendants had volunteered to implement certain remedies to ensure compliance with the preliminary injunction, but that he also found it necessary to mandate certain measures to enforce the injunction. He ordered that the staff of the Los Angeles Field Office receive training on the 2009 ICE Parole Directive (which they are supposed to be following pursuant to the injunction). He also ordered that field office officials provide short explanations when rendering parole decisions to better inform asylum seekers of their reasoning. Finally, he declined to appoint a special master, concluding that the above measures would be sufficient to ensure compliance. 2020 WL 601629.</p>\r\n<p>On October 13, 2020, the plaintiff class filed both a motion for summary judgment and permanent injunction to enjoin DHS from enforcing its policy detaining asylum seekers without individualized consideration of flight risk or danger to the community. On December 17, 2020, DHS filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Shortly thereafter, the parties began negotiations to settle the matter and have since filed regular status reports to inform the court of the status of their negotiations through 2025.</p>\r\n<p>In a November 28, 2024 status report, the parties mentioned that they had exchanged several offers and counterproposals, and had made significant progress in approaching resolution. The latest settlement offer was sent to the defendants on December 19, 2024, which the defendants then began to review. Due to the change in presidential administrations on January 20 following the November 2024 presidential election, the defendants requested additional time to review the proposed offer. The parties requested that briefing deadlines continue to be held in abeyance in light of these settlement negotiations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Negotiations, and therefore this case, remain ongoing as of February 17, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "text": "Case 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 68   Filed 02/28/19   Page 1 of 9\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n   \nANSLEY DAMUS, et al., \n \n  Plaintiffs, \n  v.         Civil Action No. 18-578 (JEB) \nKIRSTJEN M. NIELSEN, et al.,   \n \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nDoes the Department of Homeland Security have a policy or practice of detaining \nasylum-seekers in violation of its own guidance or regulations?  The Court issued an Opinion on \nJuly 2, 2018, finding a likelihood that Defendants do have such a policy, leading it to enter a \npreliminary injunction.  The Opinion did not, however, rule on DHS’s Motion to Dismiss, which \nwas filed amid briefing on preliminary relief.  The parties now ask the Court to resolve that \nMotion.   \nAs the Government has acknowledged, most of its arguments in favor of dismissal of \nPlaintiffs’ Administrative Procedure Act claims are foreclosed by the prior Opinion.  The \nquestion that remains is whether Defendants’ actions also violate the Due Process Clause.  The \nCourt, however, need not weigh in on this thorny constitutional issue.  The “cardinal principle of \njudicial restraint” is that “if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide \nmore.”  PDK Labs., Inc. v. DEA, 362 F.3d 786, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (concurring opinion of \nRoberts, J.).  Since a decision on the extent of the asylum-seekers’ due-process rights will not at \nthis point affect the outcome of this case, avoidance is the proper course.  The Court will, \naccordingly, deny the Motion to Dismiss this count, but it will do so without prejudice; as a \n1  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 68   Filed 02/28/19   Page 2 of 9\nresult, in the event the constitutional claim ultimately becomes germane to adjudicating the rights \nof the parties, the Court may revisit it.  Separately, the Court will grant DHS’s Motion to Dismiss \ntwo individual Defendants from this case.    \nI.  Background \nThe circumstances underlying this litigation were recounted at length in the Court’s prior \nOpinion.  See Damus v. Nielsen, 313 F. Supp. 3d 317 (D.D.C. 2018).  Only a short summary is \nthus needed to set the stage.  The Court begins with a refresher on the legal landscape and then \nturns to the procedural history of this case.   \nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act, non-citizens who seek asylum upon their \narrival in the United States are referred to interviews to determine whether they have a credible \nfear of persecution or torture in their home countries.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).  If the \ninterviewing officer finds that such a fear exists, the individual “shall be detained for further \nconsideration of the application for asylum.”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  This detention authority, \nhowever, is not “entirely inflexible.”  Damus, 313 F. Supp. 3d at 323.  Instead, asylum-seekers \nwho are not security or flight risks can be paroled into the United States “for urgent humanitarian \nreasons or significant public benefit.”  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b).  In a 2009 Directive, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement explained that parole would be appropriate under these provisions when \nan asylum-seeker establishes his identity and demonstrates that he is neither a flight risk nor a \ndanger to the public.  See ECF No. 22-1 (ICE Directive 11002.1), ¶ 6.2.  This Directive also \nrequires individualized assessments, written notices of the process, and explanations of decisions \ndenying parole.  Id., ¶¶ 6.1, 6.5. \n  In March 2018, nine asylum-seekers who were detained after being denied parole filed \nthis suit.  See ECF No. 3 (Compl.), ¶¶ 1–2.  On behalf of a class of similarly situated Plaintiffs, \n2  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 68   Filed 02/28/19   Page 3 of 9\nthey asserted that five particular ICE Field Offices were not providing the individualized \ndeterminations required by the 2009 Directive.  Id., ¶¶ 14–17.  In support, they pointed to parole-\ndenial rates at those offices nearing 100%, an almost complete reversal from the minimal denial \nrates maintained in the previous administration.  Id., ¶¶ 37–39.  Plaintiffs alleged that these \nactions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause.  Id., ¶¶ 66–80.  \nSoon thereafter, they filed motions for provisional class certification and for a preliminary \ninjunction, which the Government opposed.  See ECF Nos. 11 & 17.  The Government also filed \na Motion to Dismiss.  See ECF No. 22 (MTD).  Granting the asylum-seekers’ motions, the Court \nentered an Order enjoining DHS from “denying parole to any provisional class members absent \nan individualized determination, through the parole process, that such provisional class member \npresents a flight risk or a danger to the community.”  ECF No. 33 (PI Order) at 1.  DHS’s \nMotion, meanwhile, was held in abeyance.  See Minute Order of July 10, 2019.  After \nsubsequent proceedings in which Plaintiffs were granted limited discovery related to the \nGovernment’s compliance with the injunction, see ECF Nos. 41 & 52, the parties now ask the \nCourt to rule on Defendants’ Motion.  \nII.  Legal Standard \nIn evaluating their Motion to Dismiss, the Court must “treat the complaint’s factual \nallegations as true . . . and must grant [P]laintiff[s] ‘the benefit of all inferences that can be \nderived from the facts alleged.’”  Sparrow v. United Air Lines, Inc., 216 F.3d 1111, 1113 (D.C. \nCir. 2000) (quoting Schuler v. United States, 617 F.2d 605, 608 (D.C. Cir. 1979)); see also \nJerome Stevens Pharms., Inc. v. FDA, 402 F.3d 1249, 1253–54 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  The Court need \nnot accept as true, however, “a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation,” nor an inference \n3  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 68   Filed 02/28/19   Page 4 of 9\nunsupported by the facts set forth in the Complaint.  See Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 193 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)). \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides for the dismissal of an action where a \ncomplaint fails “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Although “detailed factual \nallegations” are not necessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, “a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal citation omitted).  For a plaintiff to survive \na 12(b)(6) motion, the facts alleged in the complaint “must be enough to raise a right to relief \nabove the speculative level.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555–56 (2007).  \nIII.  Analysis \nThe Court first addresses the Government’s arguments in favor of dismissing the APA \nclaims, all of which were addressed by the prior Opinion.  It then moves on to the due-process \ncount and two individual Defendants.   \nA.  APA Claims \nThere is no need to linger on the APA claims, since DHS’s objections on that score were \nsquarely rejected in the Court’s Opinion granting the motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nDefendants contend that these causes of action should be dismissed because (1) the Court lacks \njurisdiction under the INA to grant Plaintiffs relief; and (2) the claims are unsupported by \nsufficient factual allegations.  See MTD at 10–15.  As to the first, the Court previously \nconcluded that the “alleged jurisdictional hurdles [we]re easily cleared by the asylum-seekers, \nand that their claims [could] therefore proceed.”  Damus, 313 F. Supp. 3d at 327.   With regard to \nthe second, the Court found, based on the “drastic decline in parole-grant rates at the five ICE \nField Offices, and the affidavits by the named Plaintiffs and their counsel regarding the \n4  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 68   Filed 02/28/19   Page 5 of 9\nprocessing of their parole applications,” that “Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of their [] claim that Defendants are not abiding by their own policies and \nprocedures.”  Id. at 341.  As the Government acknowledged in a recent status conference, see \nStatus Conf. of Feb. 7, 2019, these conclusions foreclose its only arguments for dismissing these \nclaims.  \nB.  Due-Process Claim \nThe Opinion did not, conversely, resolve Defendants’ position on the due-process claim.  \nThe Government asserts that it should be dismissed because Plaintiffs, as non-citizens detained \nupon their arrival into the United States, have no due-process rights beyond those bestowed on \nthem by Congress.  See MTD at 16 (citing Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. \n206, 212 (1953)).  The Court found it unnecessary to rule on this claim for purposes of the \npreliminary injunction because the asylum-seekers achieved all the relief they then sought \nthrough victory on their APA claims.  Likewise, it need not decide the merits of it now.  This is \nso for two reasons.  First, the merits of the constitutional cause of action rise and fall in relevant \npart with the merits of Plaintiffs’ APA claims.  And second, the asylum-seekers request the same \nrelief from both.  Resolving the matter will therefore have no ultimate effect on the relative \nsuccess of the parties or the breadth of relief awarded.  The Court will thus adhere to the \n“longstanding principle of judicial restraint requir[ing] that courts avoid reaching constitutional \nquestions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.”  Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 705 \n(2011) (citations omitted).   \n  The Merits  \nTo start, under the facts alleged, Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their due-process claim \nwithout also prevailing on their APA ones.  The linchpin of their APA argument is that DHS has a \n5  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 68   Filed 02/28/19   Page 6 of 9\npolicy or practice of failing to provide asylum-seekers the individualized parole determinations \nrequired by law.  See Compl., ¶¶ 66–74; ECF No. 17 (PI Motion) at 16–32; ECF No. 24 (Opp. to \nMTD) at 3–15.  There is little question that such a policy or practice, if it exists, would violate \nthe APA.  The crux of the asylum-seekers’ due-process claim is the same: DHS’s allegedly \nunconstitutional practice of “refus[ing] to provide individualized parole determinations.”  PI \nMot. at 39 (formatting modified).  In order to succeed on their due-process claim, therefore, the \nasylum-seekers must prove that DHS has a policy or practice of refusing to provide \nindividualized parole determinations.  Yet once they have so proven, they will have necessarily \nprevailed on their APA claim.  Resolving the legal dispute about Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights is \nthus unnecessary to determining who will triumph on the merits in this case. \n  Besides being unnecessary, deciding the due-process claim would be no walk in the park.  \nCourts across the country have divided on the right answer.  Compare Rosales-Garcia v. Holland, \n322 F.3d 386, 411–15 (6th Cir. 2003) (en banc) (holding that persons subject to immigration \ndetention upon arrival in United States are protected by Due Process Clause), and Perez v. \nDecker, 2018 WL 3991497, at *3–4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, 2018) (same), with Borrero v. Aljets, 325 \nF.3d 1003, 1005–08 (8th Cir. 2003) (holding that persons detained at border do not have \njudicially enforceable due-process rights), and Aracely, R. v. Nielsen, 319 F. Supp. 3d 110, 144 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (concluding that due process does not entitle asylum-seekers to individual \nhearings).  Last year, with the issue squarely teed up, the Supreme Court declined to resolve it.  \nSee Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 851 (2018).  These disagreements counsel against this \nCourt’s weighing in unnecessarily, particularly when the parties have given it less than ten total \npages of briefing.  See PI Mot. at 36–41; MTD at 15–17; Opp. at 16–17. \n6  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 68   Filed 02/28/19   Page 7 of 9\n  Relief \nPlaintiffs also seek equivalent relief on their due-process and APA claims.  If they win on \nthe latter, the asylum-seekers will presumably obtain permanent injunctive relief requiring DHS \nto provide them with the individualized parole determinations required by the Parole Directive.  \nSee Compl., ¶ c.  As the crux of the former is that the Due Process Clause requires individualized \nparole determinations, the relief they would be accorded if successful would also be the parole \ndeterminations to which they claim to be entitled.  See Salazar v. Buono, 559 U.S. 700, 718 \n(2010) (“A court must find prospective relief that fits the remedy to the wrong or injury that has \nbeen established.”). \nPlaintiffs, the Court acknowledges, do briefly hint at a different due-process claim that \nmay seek potentially broader relief.  In opposing dismissal of several individual Defendants — \nan issue the Court addresses below — they say in a footnote that “Plaintiffs’ complaint also \nincludes a claim that Due Process requires a custody hearing before an immigration judge as a \nneutral decision-maker when detention becomes unreasonably prolonged.”  Opp. at 17 n.5.  \nBased on the parties’ positions and filings throughout this case, however, the Court is not \nconvinced that Plaintiffs are really pursuing such a claim.  As far as the Court can tell, the \nfootnote is the only place this theory is mentioned in any briefing.  The silence in their motion \nfor class certification is particularly notable.  The proposed class, which the Court provisionally \ncertified, includes some asylum-seekers who have not been detained for a prolonged period and \nthus would not be entitled to the relief sought for this claim.  But “Rule 23(b)(2)” — the basis for \ncertification here — “applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would \nprovide relief to each member of the class.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360 \n7  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 68   Filed 02/28/19   Page 8 of 9\n(2011).  A class drawn to include persons detained for any amount of time may face difficulty \npursuing a class-wide claim hinging on prolonged detention.   \nAs to the Complaint, it implies that Plaintiffs may have a separate due-process claim in a \nsingle legal assertion: “[P]articularly where detention is prolonged, due process requires a \ncustody hearing before a neutral-decision maker to determine if detention is necessary.”  Compl., \n¶ 79.  It also requests that the Court “[e]nter an order enjoining Defendants from subjecting \nPlaintiffs and proposed class members to prolonged detention absent a custody hearing before an \nimmigration judge.”  Id., ¶ d.  But that is it.  Considered as a whole, the Court finds that the \nasylum-seekers have not pursued a constitutional claim based on prolonged detention.  The \nbroader relief to which they might be entitled from such a claim thus does not necessitate a \ndecision on the due-process issue.  “If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in \nthe process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of \nconstitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable.”  Spector Motor Serv. v. McLaughlin, \n323 U.S. 101, 105 (1944).  The Court, accordingly, will not decide the due-process question \ntoday.     \nOne outside possibility is worth flagging: that the nature of the claims being litigated in \nthis case will matter for determining the propriety of discovery.  The general rule, of course, is \nthat discovery is not available in an APA case — instead, such cases are litigated on the basis of \nthe administrative record.  See Air Transp. Ass’n of America v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 663 F.3d \n476, 487 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  No such rule exists in constitutional cases.  At this point, though, the \nCourt is skeptical that any difference in the substantive basis of the claims will matter to the \navailability of discovery.  See Bellion Spirits, LLC v. United States, 335 F. Supp. 3d 32, 41–45 \n(D.D.C. 2018).  In any event, if the nature of the claims is dispositive in a subsequent discovery \n8  \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 68   Filed 02/28/19   Page 9 of 9\nmotion, the Court can consider the Government’s arguments in favor of dismissing the due-\nprocess claim at that point.  For now, the proper course is to deny the Motion to Dismiss without \nprejudice.          \nC.  Individual Defendants \nThe Court last turns to the Government’s independent argument that certain individual \nDefendants — namely, the Attorney General and the Director of the Executive Office for \nImmigration Review — should be dismissed.  See MTD at 17–18.  Plaintiffs oppose on the \nground that they maintain a separate due-process claim seeking bond hearings for asylum-\nseekers in prolonged detention and that such hearings would be supervised by the Attorney \nGeneral and EOIR Director.  See Opp. at 17 n.5.  As the Court has just explained, however, it is \nnot persuaded that Plaintiffs are pursuing any such claim.  The Court thus agrees with the \nGovernment that those individual Defendants should be dismissed.     \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor these reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss.  A separate Order so stating will issue this day. \n/s/ James E. Boasberg \nJAMES E.

Plaintiffs bring this class action to enjoin a Department of Homeland \nSecurity (“DHS”) policy and practice of categorically detaining asylum seekers in order \nto deter others from seeking refuge in the United States.   \n2.  Plaintiffs are all asylum seekers who traveled to the United States, were \nfound to have a credible fear of persecution, and were referred for immigration \nproceedings to decide their asylum claims.  All of them have sponsors in the United \nStates who are prepared to provide them with housing and ensure they attend their court \nhearings, and none of them have criminal records or history of violence.  Yet DHS has \nimprisoned them during the pendency of their asylum cases, with no individualized \nreview of whether their detention is necessary.   \n3.  In R.I.L-R. v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164 (D.D.C. 2015), this Court \npreliminarily enjoined a DHS policy of detaining families seeking asylum that was \ndesigned to “send[] a message of deterrence” to other migrants.  Id. at 188-89.  Applying \nestablished Supreme Court precedent, the Court held in its preliminary-injunction ruling \nthat immigration detention could not lawfully be founded on general deterrence—which \nmay inform criminal, but not civil, detention.  The Court, moreover, found that the \ngovernment’s conclusory incantations of “national security” could not support a \ndeterrence-based detention policy.  Id. at 189-90.   \n4.  Notwithstanding R.I.L-R., DHS has now unlawfully embarked on an even \nbroader policy of detaining asylum seekers on deterrence grounds at five U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) Field Offices across the country (the \n  2 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 3 of 29\n“Deterrence Policy”).  With the approval of ICE Headquarters, and in violation of a \nlongstanding DHS directive precluding detention of asylum seekers except in unusual \ncases (“Parole Directive”), these five Field Offices have detained virtually all adults who \nrequest asylum at a port of entry to the United States.  The five Field Offices have \ndetained these asylum seekers based not on individualized determinations that they pose a \nflight risk or a danger to the community, but rather to deter other migrants from seeking \nrefuge here.   \n5.  Detaining asylum seekers to deter others, without even considering \nwhether individuals are flight risks or dangers to the community, violates the Parole \nDirective (which generally bars the detention of asylum seekers who pose neither a flight \nrisk nor a danger to the community), the Immigration and Naturalization Act (“INA”), \nregulations promulgated thereunder, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  Indeed, even if DHS’s current parole policy were not based on deterrence, \nit would be unlawful for DHS to engage in virtually blanket detention of asylum seekers \nwithout individualized determinations of flight risk or danger to the community.  The fact \nthat the Policy is based on general deterrence—which cannot be a basis for civil \ndetention—makes it even clearer that the Policy is unlawful.  See R.I.L-R., 80 F. Supp. at \n189.  \n6.  Ensuring that asylum seekers have access to a meaningful parole process \nhas become even more critical in light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Jennings \nv. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830 (2018).  The Court in Jennings held that parole is the only \nexception to detention under the INA for asylum seekers who presented themselves at \nports of entry to the United States, and that this “express exception to detention implies \n  3 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 4 of 29\nthat there are no other circumstances under which [such] aliens . . . may be released.”  Id. \nat 844 (emphasis omitted).  The Deterrence Policy, however, effectively and unlawfully \neliminates this opportunity for release at the five ICE Field Offices, leaving asylum \nseekers within these Field Offices with no meaningful way to avoid detention during the \npendency of their asylum cases. \n7.  ICE data suggests that, as a result of the Deterrence Policy, more than a \nthousand individuals in the last year have been unlawfully deprived of their liberty for \nnothing more than seeking refuge in a nation that has provided it to countless others since \nits founding.  Each additional day of detention exacerbates the grave risk to the mental \nand physical health of these individuals.  Absent intervention by this Court, thousands \nmore asylum seekers will suffer the same fate.  The Court should enjoin the Deterrence \nPolicy and require Defendants to provide Plaintiffs and other proposed class members \nwith individualized determinations of flight risk and danger to the community before \nsubjecting them to detention. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n(federal question); 28 U.S.C. § 1361 (mandamus); and 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (All Writs Act).  \nDefendants have waived sovereign immunity pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702.   \n9.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because \nmultiple defendants reside in this District, and a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to this action occurred in this District. \n \n \n  4 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 5 of 29\nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiffs are asylum seekers who presented themselves to immigration \nauthorities at a U.S. port of entry, were found to have a credible fear of persecution or \ntorture in their home countries, and have been referred for proceedings inside the United \nStates to decide their asylum claims.  They are all detained pursuant to the Deterrence \nPolicy. \n11.  Ansly Damus, a former ethics teacher, is seeking asylum in the United \nStates after fleeing political persecution—including beating and death threats—in his \nhome country, Haiti.  Fearing for his life, Mr. Damus came to the United States in \nOctober 2016.  An asylum officer found that he had a credible fear of persecution and \nreferred him for removal proceedings.  Although an immigration judge has granted him \nasylum—twice—the government appealed both determinations, and Mr. Damus has \nremained in detention pending the government’s repeated appeals.  In late January 2017 \nand February 2018, the Detroit ICE Field Office denied Mr. Damus’ requests for release \non parole pursuant to the Deterrence Policy, even though he established his identity, \nidentified a sponsor with whom he could live, and showed that he poses no flight risk or \ndanger to the community.  As a result, Mr. Damus has been detained in ICE custody for \nthe last 16 months—with no end in sight.  Mr. Damus is currently detained at the Geauga \nCounty Safety Center in Chardon, Ohio. \n12.  N.J.J.R. is seeking asylum in the United States after fleeing beating and \nthreats from armed groups that seek to eliminate opposition to the Venezuelan \ngovernment.  Fearing for his life, N.J.J.R. presented himself to immigration officers in \nOctober 2017.  An asylum officer found that N.J.J.R. had a credible fear of persecution \n  5 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 6 of 29\nand referred him for removal proceedings.  The Newark ICE Field Office denied \nN.J.J.R’s requests for release on parole pursuant to its Deterrence Policy, even though he \nhas established his identity, identified a sponsor with whom he could live, and shown he \nposes no flight risk or danger to the community.  N.J.J.R. has been detained for over four \nmonths.  He is currently detained at the Essex County Correctional Facility in Newark, \nNew Jersey.   \n13.  Abelardo Asensio Callol is seeking asylum in the United States after \nfleeing persecution at the hands of the Cuban government due to his refusal to be a part \nof the Cuban Communist Party and attend a rally held in memory of Fidel Castro.  \nFearing for his life, Mr. Callol presented himself to immigration officers in December \n2017.  An asylum officer found that Mr. Callol had a credible fear of persecution and \nreferred him for removal proceedings.  ICE denied Mr. Callol parole without ever \ninterviewing him on his eligibility for parole.  Mr. Callol submitted several requests to \nICE asking how to submit additional documentation that would establish his identity and \ndemonstrate that he is not a flight risk and that he has sponsors with whom he can live.  \nICE has not responded to any of his requests.  Mr. Callol has been detained for over three \nmonths.  Currently he is detained at the York County Prison in York, Pennsylvania. \n14.  Alexi Ismael Montes Castro is seeking asylum in the United States after \nfleeing harassment, assault, and threats at gunpoint in Honduras because he is gay.  \nFearing for his life, Mr. Montes Castro presented himself to immigration officers and \nsought asylum in November 2017.  An asylum officer found that Mr. Montes Castro had \na credible fear of persecution and referred him for removal proceedings.  Mr. Montes \nCastro was not even aware that he could request release on parole until he received a \n  6 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 7 of 29\nboilerplate letter from ICE in January 2018, denying him parole pursuant to the \nDeterrence Policy.  ICE never interviewed him to determine his eligibility for parole.  \nICE denied Mr. Montes Castro parole even though he provided the government with his \nbirth certificate and explained that he had a relative in Virginia willing to provide him \nhousing and support in the course of requesting asylum.  Mr. Montes Castro has been \ndetained for about four months.  Currently he is detained at the York County Prison in \nYork, Pennsylvania. \n15.  H.A.Y. and A.M.M. are a wife and husband seeking asylum in the United \nStates after fleeing a criminal cartel in Mexico that sought to take control of their home, \ncattle, and farm.  Fearing for their lives, the couple came to the United States in \nDecember 2017.  Asylum officers found that they each had a credible fear of persecution \nand referred them both for removal proceedings.  In February 2018, the El Paso ICE \nField Office denied both H.A.Y.’s and A.M.M.’s requests for parole pursuant to the \nDeterrence Policy, even though they had established their identities, identified a sponsor \nwith whom they could live, and shown that they pose no flight risk or danger to the \ncommunity.  H.A.Y. and A.M.M. have been detained for over two months.  H.A.Y. is \ncurrently detained at the El Paso Processing Center in El Paso, Texas.  A.M.M. was \nseparated from his wife and is currently detained at the Otero County Processing Center \nin Chaparral, New Mexico. \n16.  L.H.A. is seeking asylum in the United States after fleeing a dangerous \ngang in El Salvador, which attempted to recruit and extort money from him, and \nthreatened to kill him and his family.  Fearing for his life, L.H.A. came to the United \nStates in May 2016.  An asylum officer found that L.H.A. had a credible fear of \n  7 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 8 of 29\npersecution and referred him for removal proceedings.  On June 14, 2017, L.H.A. applied \nfor parole, but the El Paso ICE Field Office denied L.H.A.’s request for parole pursuant \nto the Deterrence Policy, even though he had established his identity, identified a sponsor \nwith whom he could live, and shown he poses no flight risk or danger to the community.  \nL.H.A. has been detained for more than twenty-one months.  He is currently detained at \nthe El Paso Processing Center in Texas. \n17.  E.E.C.S. is seeking asylum in the United States after the dangerous MS-13 \ngang in El Salvador beat him and threatened to kill him, and Salvadoran police targeted \nhim.  Fearing for his life, E.E.C.S. presented himself to U.S. immigration officers in \nDecember 2017.  An asylum officer found that E.E.C.S. had a credible fear of \npersecution and referred him for removal proceedings.

Legal Framework Governing Parole of Asylum Seekers. \n28.  Under the INA, a person who is subjected to expedited removal who \nrequests asylum at a port of entry to the United States must first demonstrate a credible \nfear of persecution in his or her home country during an interview with an immigration \nofficer—meaning there is a “significant possibility” that the individual is eligible for \nasylum.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).  If an individual establishes a credible fear of \npersecution, he or she is then entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge to \nadjudicate the asylum claim.  See id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f). \n29.  There typically is an interval of several months between an asylum \nseeker’s credible-fear interview with an immigration officer and a decision on his or her \nasylum claim by an immigration judge.  During that period, DHS must determine \nwhether the individual should be detained or released pending resolution of the asylum \nclaim.  That resolution can take more than a year or even several years if it involves \nappeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) or a federal court of appeals.  \n30.  Pursuant to the INA and implementing regulations, asylum seekers who \ndo not pose a flight risk or a danger to the community may be paroled by DHS during the \npendency of their immigration cases on a “case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian \nreasons or significant public benefit.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A), 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b); see \nalso 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(c). \n  11 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 12 of 29\n31.  DHS issued the Parole Directive in 2009.1  The Parole Directive defines \nthe circumstances under which there is a “significant public benefit” to granting parole \npursuant to the INA and implementing regulations.  The Parole Directive provides that, \nabsent exceptional overriding factors, an asylum seeker who has established a credible \nfear of persecution should be granted parole in the “public interest” and released from \ndetention while pursuing his or her asylum claims if the individual (a) establishes his or \nher identity to the satisfaction of DHS; and (b) presents neither a flight risk nor danger to \nthe community.  Parole Directive ¶ 6.2. \n32.  DHS’s policy, reflected in the Parole Directive, against the detention of \nasylum seekers who have credible claims to asylum ensures that the government adheres \nto constitutional prohibitions against arbitrary detention.  Asylum seekers, including \nthose detained at ports of entry into the United States, are “persons” who may not be \ndeprived of liberty without due process of law under the Due Process Clause.  \nAccordingly, the Due Process Clause, as well as the INA and its implementing \nregulations, preclude DHS from subjecting a bona fide asylum seeker to long-term civil \nimmigration detention absent an individualized determination that the individual poses a \nflight risk or is a danger to the community. \n33.  Until recently, DHS relied on the Parole Directive to grant parole to \nthousands of asylum seekers with a credible fear, based on individualized findings that \ntheir detention was unnecessary.  This is not surprising:  the overwhelming majority of \nasylum seekers who establish a credible fear lack any criminal history, pose no threat to \n1 ICE Directive 11002.1, Parole of Arriving Aliens Found to Have a Credible Fear of \n P  e  r  s  e  c  u  t i  o  n    o   r    T  o  r  t u   r e     ( D   e  c  .    8 , 2009), https://www.ice.gov/doclib/dro/pdf/11002.1-hd-\nparole_of_arriving_aliens_found_credible_fear.pdf. \n  12 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 13 of 29\npublic safety, and do not need to be detained to ensure their appearance for court \nproceedings.2 \n34.  DHS has not revoked or amended the Parole Directive.  Indeed, in \nFebruary 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly stated that the Parole Directive \n“remain[s] in full force and effect” pending the DHS Secretary’s “further review and \nevaluation.”3  DHS has not withdrawn or amended the Parole Directive since that time.   \n35.  The government also represented to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates last year that the Parole Directive remains “in ‘full force and effect.’”4  The \ngovernment emphasized that the Parole Directive generally requires DHS “to release the \nalien if he establishes his identity [and] demonstrates that he is not a flight risk or \ndanger,” and requires an individualized analysis that “calls for far more than checking a \nbox on a form.”5   \n36.  So long as the Parole Directive remains in effect, it is binding on ICE, and \nits provisions must be applied to asylum seekers who establish a credible fear of \npersecution.  See Abdi v. Duke, 280 F. Supp. 3d 373, 2017 WL 5599521, at *28 \n2 See, e.g., Mark Noferi, A Humane Approach Can Work: The Effectiveness of \nA   l  t e  r  n  a  t i  v  e  s    t o    D    e  t e  n  t i  o  n    f  o  r    A  sylum Seekers, at 1, 3 (July 2015), \nhttps://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/a_humane_appr\noach_can_work_the_effectiveness_of_alternatives_to_detention_for_asylum_seekers.pdf \n(summarizing research showing that asylum seekers are predisposed to comply with legal \nprocesses). \n3 See Memorandum from John Kelly, Implementing the President’s Border Security and \nImmigration Enforcement Improvements Policies, at 9-10 (Feb. 20, 2017) (“Kelly \nMemorandum”), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Implementing-the-\nPresidents-Border-Security-Immigration-Enforcement-Improvement-Policies.pdf. \n4 Pet.

The Unlawful Detention of Virtually All Asylum Seekers at Five ICE \nField Offices. \n37.  DHS has, since the Trump Administration took office last year, \nimplemented a de facto policy of denying parole in virtually all cases at its Detroit, El \nPaso, Los Angeles, Newark, and Philadelphia Field Offices (“the ICE Field Offices”).  \nAltogether, these ICE Field Offices detain approximately 24 percent of ICE’s total \naverage daily detention population. \n38.  ICE data suggests that the ICE Field Offices likely denied at least 1,000 \nrequests for parole by arriving asylum seekers during 2017.  Between February and \nSeptember 2017,6 the ICE Field Offices denied parole at the following rates:  Detroit \nofficers denied 63 of 64 parole requests, or 98 percent of cases; El Paso officers denied \n349 of 349 parole requests, or 100 percent of cases; Los Angeles officers denied 326 of \n354 parole requests, or 92 percent of cases; Newark officers denied 10 of 10 parole \nrequests, or 100 percent of cases; and Philadelphia officers denied 43 of 43 cases, or 100 \npercent of cases.  \n39.  This is a dramatic change from ICE’s past practice pursuant to the Parole \nDirective.  Between 2011 and 2013, the ICE Field Offices paroled 92 percent of arriving \nasylum seekers pursuant to the Directive.  More recently, the parole rate began to fall, \ndropping to less than 4 percent on average across the ICE Field Offices during the period \nfrom February through September 2017.   \n6 September 2017 data is the the most recent data available to Plaintiffs. \n                                                        \n  14 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 15 of 29\n40.  Since the Trump Administration came into office, officers in the ICE Field \nOffices repeatedly have told detainees and their attorneys that parole will no longer be \ngranted. \n41.  The ICE Field Offices are no longer following the requirements of the \nParole Directive.  Asylum seekers routinely are not notified of the availability of parole, \nin violation of the Parole Directive.  See Parole Directive, §§ 6.1, 8.1 (requiring DHS \nofficers to provide asylum seeker with parole advisal “[a]s soon as practicable following \na credible fear determination”).  When notification is provided, the ICE officer does not \n“explain the contents of the notification to the [asylum seeker] in a language he or she \nunderstands,” also in violation of the Parole Directive.  Id. § 8.1.  Some asylum seekers \nare denied parole even before they are notified of their ability to seek it, again in violation \nof the Parole Directive.  Others are not given interviews before their parole requests are \ndenied, likewise in violation of the Parole Directive.  See id. § 8.2 (requiring parole \ninterview generally “no later than seven days” after asylum seeker passes credible fear \nscreening).  Indeed, sometimes the ICE Field Offices simply do not respond to asylum \nseekers’ parole requests at all.    \n42.  Even where the ICE Field Offices ostensibly consider parole requests, \nthey no longer provide individualized determinations of flight risk and danger, in \nviolation of the Parole Directive.  See id. § 6.2.  Instead, the ICE Field Offices issue \ndenials that give no indication that the evidence in support of the parole request has been \nconsidered.  The denials typically come in the form of very short form letters that contain \nboilerplate language and/or checkboxes indicating that the asylum seeker poses a “flight \nrisk” or has not sufficiently demonstrated her identity.  These form denials provide no \n  15 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 16 of 29\nexplanation of why the asylum seeker has been denied parole or any indication that the \nrequest was given any individualized consideration at all, again in violation of the Parole \nDirective.  See id. § 8.2 (“The letter must include a brief explanation of the reasons for \ndenying parole.”).  The form denials also typically come in English, including for asylum \nseekers who do not understand English—another violation of the Parole Directive.  See \nid.  The denials also often do not inform the asylum seeker of her right to seek \nredetermination of the denial, which is yet another violation.  See id.   \n43.  As a result, many asylum seekers who clearly satisfy the Parole \nDirective’s criteria for release are denied parole.  The ICE Field Offices grant release \nonly in extremely narrow circumstances—such as medical emergencies or a shortage in \ndetention bed space.  The result is that numerous individuals for whom detention serves \nno permissible purpose are being deprived of their liberty—for months or even years—as \nthey wait for their asylum claims to be adjudicated. \n44.  Officials at ICE Headquarters are fully aware of and have permitted the \nICE Field Offices to implement this policy.  The Parole Directive specifically requires \nICE Headquarters to analyze periodic reporting on parole decisions and take corrective \naction as needed.  See Parole Directive ¶¶ 8.11, 8.12.  Although ICE Headquarters has \nbeen aware of detention practices across the ICE Field Offices for more than a year, it has \ntaken no action to require the ICE Field Offices to follow the Parole Directive. \n45.  Another federal court recently held that ICE officers at ICE’s Buffalo, \nNew York Field Office violated the Parole Directive through their blanket detention of \nasylum seekers.  In November 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nNew York found that the government had engaged in a class-wide practice of issuing \n  16 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 17 of 29\n“blanket denials” to parole requests that failed to analyze each case “‘on its own merits \nand based on the facts of the individual alien’s case,’” in violation of the Parole \nDirective.  Abdi, 2017 WL 5599521, at *23.  The court granted a preliminary injunction \nrequiring, among other things, that the Buffalo ICE Field Office “immediately \nadjudicate” the parole requests of a class of detained asylum seekers “in conformance \nwith [its] legal obligations, including [its] obligations under the [Parole] Directive.”  Id. \nat *28.   \nC.  The Deterrence Motive Behind the Virtually Blanket Detention at the \nICE Field Offices. \n46.  DHS’s de facto policy of denying parole in virtually all cases at the ICE \nField Offices, without individualized determinations of flight risk or danger to the \ncommunity, would be unlawful regardless of the motive behind that policy.  But here, \nthat illegality is exacerbated by the policy’s unlawful motive.  The Deterrence Policy is \nplainly motivated by the Trump Administration’s goal of deterring other asylum seekers \nfrom seeking refuge in the United States.  As this Court found in its preliminary \ninjunction ruling in R.I.L-R., deterrence of others—which is a function of criminal law—\nis not a permissible basis for civil immigration detention.  See R.I.L-R., 80 F. Supp. 3d at \n189-90. \n47.  The Trump Administration’s own words establish that the Deterrence \nPolicy is indeed deterrence-based.  Executive Order No. 13767, Border Security and \nImmigration Enforcement Improvements, 82 Fed. Reg. 8793 (Jan. 30, 2017), makes \ndetention central to the Administration’s efforts to deter what it considers unauthorized \nmigration.  The Order makes it the policy of the Executive Branch to “detain individuals \napprehended on suspicion of violating . . . Federal immigration law, pending further \n  17 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 18 of 29\nproceedings regarding those violations.”  Id. at 8793.  This new detention policy aims, in \npart, “to secure the Nation’s southern border” and “prevent further illegal immigration \ninto the United States.”  Id. at 8793. \n48.  On February 20, 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly issued the Kelly \nMemorandum, which implemented the Executive Order through “new policies designed \nto stem illegal immigration and facilitate the . . . . detention and removal of aliens who \nhave no lawful basis to enter or remain in the United States.”7  The Kelly Memorandum \ndid not rescind the Parole Directive, and, indeed, stated that the Directive “remain[s] in \nfull force and effect” pending the DHS Secretary’s “further review and evaluation.”8  \nNonetheless, the Kelly Memorandum articulated that DHS would broadly detain migrants \nas a means of deterring other migrants from coming to the United States.  This in turn has \nresulted in Defendants violating the Parole Directive at the ICE Field Offices by \neffectuating the Deterrence Policy. \n49.  With respect to detention, the Kelly Memorandum states that “[t]he \nPresident has determined that the lawful detention of aliens arriving in the United States \n. . . pending a final determination of whether to order them removed, including \ndetermining eligibility for immigration relief, is the most efficient means by which to \nenforce the immigration laws at our borders.”9  To that end, “[p]olicies that facilitate the \nrelease of removable aliens apprehended at and between the ports of entry . . . \ncollectively referred to as ‘catch-and-release,’ shall end.”10 \n7 Kelly Memorandum at 1. \n 8   I  d  .   a  t    9  - 1   0  .                                   \n9 Id. at 2. \n10 Id. \n  18 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 19 of 29\n50.  An earlier draft of the Kelly Memorandum states the Administration’s \ndeterrence goals in even clearer terms.  The draft expressly states that DHS’s new \nenforcement policies—including its expanded use of detention to end “catch-and-\nrelease”—were “designed to deter illegal immigration,” and that “[t]he President has \ndetermined that the lawful detention of arriving aliens pending a determination of their \ninadmissibility and eligibility for immigration relief has a significant deterrent effect on \nillegal immigration.”11  The final version of the memorandum merely replaces “deter \nillegal immigration” with “stem illegal immigration,” and “significant deterrent effect” \nwith “most efficient means by which to enforce the immigration laws.”  Despite these \ncosmetic revisions, which were presumably made to create the appearance that the memo \ndoes not violate R.I.L-R. and the authorities on which it is based, the purpose of DHS’s \nnew detention policies remains clear: the deterrence of migration to the United States. \n51.  Since the Kelly Memorandum was issued, the Trump Administration has \ncontinued to emphasize its goal of deterring migration through detention.  A recent White \nHouse Framework on Immigration Reform & Border Security provides that “[t]he \nDepartment of Homeland Security must have tools to deter illegal immigration.”  \nSpecifically, the Administration pledges to “[d]eter illegal entry” by ending “catch-and-\nrelease and by closing legal loopholes that have eroded our ability to secure the \nimmigration system and protect public safety.”12 \n11 Memorandum from John Kelly, Implementing the President’s Border Security and \n I m    m   i g   r a  t i  o  n    E   n  f  o  r  c  e  m   e  n   t   I m    p  rovements Policies, at 1 (Jan. 25, 2017) (draft) (emphases \nadded), http://www.aila.org/infonet/leaked-dhs-memo-on-implementation-of-presidents. \n12 White House Framework on Immigration Reform & Border Security (Jan. 25, 2018), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/white-house-framework-immigration-\nreform-border-security/. \n  19 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 20 of 29\n52.  The ICE Field Offices’ detention practices for asylum seekers directly \nreflect the Trump Administration’s commitment to arbitrary detention as a strategy of \nimmigration enforcement and deterrence.   \n53.  Notwithstanding the Trump Administration’s deterrence goals, detaining \ncurrent asylum seekers will not deter future asylum seekers.  Individuals who flee \nviolence and persecution and come to the United States in fear of their lives and safety \nwill not be deterred by the threat of detention.13  \nD.  The Deterrence Policy Causes Plaintiffs and Proposed Class Members \nIrreparable Harm. \n54.  Defendants’ categorical detention of Plaintiffs and those similarly situated, \nwithout any individualized review of flight risk and danger to the community, has caused \nPlaintiffs and those similarly situated irreparable harm. \n55.  Detention facilities for asylum seekers are punitive and abusive.14  ICE \nuses secure facilities to detain asylum seekers, including jails designed to hold \nindividuals charged with or convicted of crimes.  Asylum seekers detained in secure \nfacilities are often subjected to physical and verbal abuse at the hands of security \npersonnel.  Medical and mental healthcare at ICE detention facilities is typically \ninadequate.   \n13 See Jonathan Hiskey, et al., Understanding the Central American Refugee Crisis: Why \nT   h  e  y    A   r  e    F   l e  e  i n   g    a  n   d    H   o   w     U   .

Policies Are Failing to Deter Them (American \nImmigration Council 2016), \nhttps://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/understanding_t\nhe_central_american_refugee_crisis.pdf.  \n14 See, e.g., USCIRF, Report on Asylum Seekers in Expedited Removal, Volume I: \nFindings and Recommendations, at 60-61, 68-69 (2005), \nhttp://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/resources/stories/pdf/asylum_seekers/Volume_I.\npdf. \n  20 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 21 of 29\n56.  The detention of asylum seekers causes them psychological and physical \ntrauma.  Confined detainees have little information or control over their environments \nand often experience circumstances similar to “sensory deprivation.”15  They develop \nfeelings of “helplessness and hopelessness that lead to debilitating depressive symptoms, \nchronic anxiety, despair, dread,” Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”), and suicidal \nideation.16  Some attempt suicide. \n57.  Asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable to trauma because detention \nmay exacerbate traumas they have experienced in the past.17  The court in the Abdi case \nfound that class members’ “physical and psychological impairments” resulting from their \n“prolonged confinement” established that detainees were irreparably harmed.  2017 WL \n5599521, at *23.  These deleterious impacts of detention begin immediately and worsen \nover time.   \n58.  Detention also impairs asylum seekers’ ability to adequately prepare for \nand litigate their asylum hearings.  See id.  Representation is crucial to prevailing on an \nasylum claim,18 yet detention makes it much less likely that asylum seekers can secure \nlawyers, gather evidence, and prepare their asylum cases.

Detention further curtails access to counsel by imposing strict limitations on \nattorney access and attorney communications.  For those asylum seekers able to secure \nrepresentation, the conditions of detention impair their ability to develop trusting \nrelationships with attorneys, which are necessary to prepare their claims for protection.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS   \n59.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n23(a) and 23(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated.  The \nproposed class is defined as follows: \n(1) All arriving asylum seekers; (2) who are found to have a credible fear \nof persecution or torture; and (3) who are or will be detained by U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement; (4) after having been denied \nparole under the authority of ICE’s Detroit, El Paso, Los Angeles, \nNewark, or Philadelphia Field Office. \n \n60.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nAccording to ICE data, from February to September 2017 alone, the ICE Field Offices \ndenied nearly 800 requests for parole by asylum seekers who passed their credible fear \ninterviews.  This data suggests that, since late January 2017, more than 1,000 asylum \nseekers likely have been detained and denied parole pursuant to Defendants’ Deterrence \nPolicy, and therefore have satisfied the class definition.  Many more individuals will \nbecome class members in the future. \n61.  Whether the Deterrence Policy is lawful presents common questions of \nfact and law.  All class members have been subjected to a common Deterrence Policy.  \n  22 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 23 of 29\nThe facts and circumstances surrounding that policy thus concern all class members.  The \nissues regarding the legality of the Deterrence Policy also apply to the class as a whole. \n62.  The claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the \nclass.  Plaintiffs and the class of individuals they seek to represent have all been detained \npursuant to the policies and practices described above.  The legal claims raised by \nPlaintiffs are identical to the class claims. \n63.  Plaintiffs are adequate representatives because they seek the same relief as \nthe other members of the class:  that Defendants be enjoined from applying the \nDeterrence Policy and required to determine custody based on an individualized \ndetermination of each migrant’s flight risk and danger to the community through the \nparole process and at a custody hearing before an immigration judge.  Plaintiffs do not \nhave any interests adverse to those of the class as a whole. \n64.  The proposed class would be represented by counsel from the ACLU, \nCovington & Burling LLP, the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, and Human \nRights First.  Counsel have extensive experience litigating class action lawsuits, \nincluding lawsuits on behalf of immigration detainees.  Counsel also have significant \nlegal and factual expertise on the detention of asylum seekers. \n65.  Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class by \napplying the Deterrence Policy to all class members.  Thus, injunctive and declaratory \nrelief is appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n \n \n \n  23 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 24 of 29\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFirst Claim \n(Administrative Procedure Act) \nUnlawful Failure to Follow and/or Effective Rescission the ICE Parole Directive  \n \n66.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully \nset forth herein. \n67.  Pursuant to the Deterrence Policy, Defendants have detained Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly-situated persons without parole reviews that conform to the requirements of the \nParole Directive.   \n68.  Through the Deterrence Policy, DHS has violated and/or de facto \nrescinded the Parole Directive without providing any reasoned justification for its change \nin policy. \n69.  DHS’s violation and/or effective rescission of its own Parole Directive \nwhile representing that the Directive remains in full force and effect is unlawful.   \n70.  Defendants’ actions are arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law, in \nviolation of the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nSecond Claim \n(Administrative Procedure Act – Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act \nand Implementing Regulations) \nFailure to Provide an Individualized Determination of Flight Risk and Danger  \n \n71.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully \nset forth herein. \n72.  Pursuant to the Deterrence Policy, Defendants have detained Plaintiffs and \npersons similarly situated, without having made individualized determinations through \nthe parole-review process that such detention is necessary based on flight risk or danger \n  24 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 25 of 29\nto the community.  Defendants have done so to deter other asylum seekers from seeking \nrefuge in the United States. \n73.  Defendants’ Deterrence Policy constitutes final agency action for which \nthere is no other adequate remedy.  This action governs parole decisions made by ICE \nagents at the ICE Field Offices pursuant to INA § 212(d)(5), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5), 8 \nC.F.R. § 212.5(b), and will govern parole decisions made at those field offices in the \nfuture.  Because of the Deterrence Policy, Plaintiffs and those similarly situated have \nbeen or will be detained without individualized parole review on flight risk or danger. \n74.  Under the INA and implementing regulations, immigration detention of an \nasylum seeker must be based on an individualized determination that the asylum seeker \nconstitutes a flight risk or a danger to the community.  Detention based on general \ndeterrence of others is not permissible.  Accordingly, the Deterrence Policy violates the \nINA and its implementing regulations. \n \nThird Claim \n(Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution) \nFailure to Provide an Individualized Determination of Flight Risk and Danger  \n \n75.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully \nset forth herein. \n76.  The Due Process Clause provides that “no person . . . shall be deprived of \n. . . liberty . . . without due process of law.”  U.S. Const., amend. V. \n77.  Asylum seekers who present themselves at a port of entry to the United \nStates are “persons” who may not be deprived of liberty without due process of law under \nthe Due Process Clause. \n  25 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 26 of 29\n78.  The Due Process Clause permits civil immigration detention of an asylum \nseeker only where such detention is reasonably related to the government’s interests in \npreventing flight or protecting the community from danger.  Thus, due process requires \nan individualized assessment of flight risk or danger to the community to determine \nwhether detention is justified. \n79.  In addition, particularly where detention is prolonged, due process \nrequires a custody hearing before a neutral decision-maker to determine if detention is \nnecessary. \n80.  Pursuant to the Deterrence Policy, Defendants have detained Plaintiffs and \nsimilarly situated persons without individualized determinations of flight risk or danger \nto the community through the parole process or at a custody hearing before a neutral \ndecision-maker.  Thus, the Deterrence Policy violates the Due Process Clause. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \na.  Certify this case as a class action lawsuit, as proposed herein, appoint Plaintiffs as \nclass representatives, and appoint the undersigned counsel as class counsel; \nb.  Declare that the Deterrence Policy is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law; \nc.  Enter an order enjoining Defendants from detaining Plaintiffs and proposed class \nmembers absent parole reviews that result in individualized determinations that \ndetention is necessary to prevent flight or danger to the community and that \nconform to the other requirements of the Parole Directive; \nd.  Enter an order enjoining Defendants from subjecting Plaintiffs and proposed class \nmembers to prolonged detention absent a custody hearing before an immigration \n  26 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 27 of 29\njudge to determine if detention is necessary to prevent flight or danger to the \ncommunity; \ne.  Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to \nJustice Act and any other applicable statute or regulation; and \nf.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate. \n  27 \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 3   Filed 03/15/18   Page 28 of 29\nDated: March 15, 2018 Respectfully submitted.\nJudy Rabinovitz Dennis B.

Civil Action No. 18-578 (JEB) \nKIRSTJEN NIELSEN, Secretary of the   \nDepartment of Homeland Security, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \n   \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n  As the events of recent months make clear, the question of how this nation will treat \nthose who come to our shores seeking refuge generates enormous debate.  While arriving \nforeigners may have myriad reasons for wanting to settle in the United States, a subset claims a \nfear of persecution in their native lands.  They seek asylum here.  Since 2009, the detention of \nthose asylum-seekers has, in part, been governed by a set of principles and procedures set forth \nin a “Parole Directive” issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a component of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.  This document establishes the process by which ICE must \ndetermine whether an individual who has passed a credible-fear interview – the first step toward \ngaining asylum status – will be released from detention on parole pending a full hearing.  \n  Plaintiffs (and other members of the class they seek to represent) are noncitizens being \nheld at five ICE Field Offices who have received a credible-fear determination but have been \ndenied parole.  Although, in the past, individuals deemed to have a “credible fear” of persecution \nand thus a significant possibility of being granted asylum were overwhelmingly released, \nPlaintiffs contend that there is a new reality in place.  Pointing to the fact that parole rates have \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 2 of 38\nplummeted from over 90% to nearly zero, as well as to testimony from detained asylum-seekers \nand their counsel, they assert that the Government is no longer following its own Parole \nDirective.  Plaintiffs allege that, rather than providing individualized determinations and \nprocedural safeguards, DHS is now engaging in systematic detention.  \n  Seeking the protections spelled out in the Directive, Plaintiffs have now turned to the \ncourts.  They filed suit in March of this year against DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, as well as \nThomas Homan, the Acting Director of ICE, U.S. Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, and \nthe directors of the five ICE Field Offices.  Their Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs have been \ndenied parole in violation of the ICE Directive, and that the Government has thereby violated the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment.  Defendants have now moved to dismiss, contending that this Court \nlacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the various counts and that Plaintiffs have failed to state a \nviable claim for relief.  The asylum-seekers both oppose dismissal and request a preliminary \ninjunction requiring DHS to comply with the Parole Directive and to provide individualized \nparole determinations while this suit is pending.   \nFinding that the circumstances here merit that extraordinary form of relief, the Court will \ngrant Plaintiffs’ Motion.  In so doing, this Opinion does no more than hold the Government \naccountable to its own policy, which recently has been honored more in the breach than the \nobservance.  Having extended the safeguards of the Parole Directive to asylum-seekers, ICE \nmust now ensure that such protections are realized.  \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 3 of 38\nI.  Background \nA.  Statutory and Regulatory Framework \n \nPlaintiffs in this case are detained pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b).  This statute provides that if a noncitizen “who is arriving in the United States” \ndemonstrates an intention to apply for asylum or expresses a fear of persecution or torture, he is \nreferred for an interview to determine whether the fear is credible.  See 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).  If the interviewing officer determines this to be the case, the INA provides \nthat the individual “shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum,” \nwhich includes a full asylum hearing before an immigration court and, if unsuccessful, an \nadministrative appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f); 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  This detention requirement is not, however, entirely inflexible.  \nInstead, an individual detained under § 1225(b) can be paroled “into the United States \ntemporarily” pursuant to the discretion of the Attorney General.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  \nAccording to agency regulations, the Secretary of Homeland Security “may invoke” this parole \nauthority for individuals who are “neither a security risk nor a risk of absconding,” and who meet \none or more of a series of conditions – namely, “for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant \npublic benefit.”  Id.; 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b).   \nIt is this last factor – “public benefit” – that is the focus of the 2009 Directive, “Parole of \nArriving Aliens Found to Have a Credible Fear of Persecution or Torture,” issued by \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE Directive” or “Parole Directive”).  See ECF No. \n22-1 (ICE Directive 11002.1).  The Directive explains the agency’s interpretation of “public \nbenefit” for the purposes of determining parole and sets out a number of procedural requirements \nfor assessing asylum-seekers’ eligibility for release.  On a broad level, the Directive states that \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 4 of 38\n“[e]ach alien’s eligibility for parole should be considered and analyzed on its own merits and \nbased on the facts of the individual alien’s case,” and that if an asylum-seeker establishes his \nidentity and that he presents neither a flight risk nor a danger to the public, “[ICE] should, absent \nadditional factors . . . parole the alien on the basis that his or her continued detention is not in the \npublic interest.”  Id., ¶ 6.2 (emphasis added).  More specifically, the Directive sets out a series of \nprocedures ICE must undertake to determine whether a given asylum-seeker should be granted \nparole, including, inter alia, that the individual shall be provided written notice of the parole \nprocess explained in a language he understands, id., ¶¶ 6.1, 8.1, shall be granted a parole \ninterview within seven days of a credible-fear finding, id., ¶ 8.2, shall be provided written \nnotification of a parole determination, id., ¶ 6.5, and shall be given a “brief explanation of the \nreasons for any decision to deny parole.”  Id., ¶ 6.5.  As a result, although the Directive affirms \nthat parole decisions are discretionary, it also establishes certain minimum procedures and \nprocesses that are to be utilized in making these determinations.  Id., ¶ 4.4 (Directive “explains \nhow the term [public interest] is to be interpreted by [ICE] when it decides whether to parole \narriving aliens determined to have a credible fear” and “mandates uniform recordkeeping and \nreview requirements for such decisions”). \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Detention \n \nThe nine named Plaintiffs and other members of the class they seek to represent are \n“asylum seekers who traveled to the United States, were found to have a credible fear of \npersecution, and were referred for immigration proceedings to decide their asylum claims.”  \nCompl., ¶ 2.  During the pendency of their asylum determinations, however, each has remained \ndetained, allegedly “with no individualized review of whether their detention is necessary.”  Id.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 5 of 38\nThe lead plaintiff, Ansly Damus, is a former ethics teacher who is seeking asylum in the \nUnited States after fleeing political persecution in Haiti.  Id., ¶ 11.  Damus entered the United \nStates in October 2016 and was referred for immigration proceedings after an asylum officer \ndetermined that he had a credible fear of persecution.  He was subsequently granted asylum \ntwice, but the Government appealed both determinations; meanwhile, the Detroit ICE Field \nOffice denied his requests for parole in January 2017 and February 2018.  Id.  He has therefore \nremained detained – at this point – for over a year and a half.  Id.  \nPlaintiff L.H.A. (the Court has permitted certain named Plaintiffs to proceed under \npseudonyms) has been detained for even longer – over two years.  Id., ¶ 16.  He entered the \nUnited States in May 2016, upon fleeing threats in El Salvador.  After receiving a credible-fear \ndetermination, L.H.A. applied for parole on June 14, 2017, but his request was denied by the El \nPaso Field Office and he remains detained.  Id. \nPlaintiffs Alexi Castro, H.A.Y., A.M.M., E.E.C.S., and L.I.L.M. have been detained for \nshorter periods (so far), but their experiences mirror those of Damus and L.H.A.  Each was found \nto have a credible fear of persecution, each requested parole, and each was subsequently denied  \nrelease and remains detained.  Id., ¶¶ 14, 15, 17, 18.  For two of the Plaintiffs, however, the story \ntakes a slightly different twist.  Abelardo Callol, who presented himself to immigration officers \nin December 2017 after fleeing persecution in Cuba, was denied parole and had been detained \nfor over three months at the time the Complaint was filed.  Id., ¶ 13.  N.J.J.R., who presented \nhimself to immigration in October 2017 after fleeing Venezula, had been detained for over four.  \nId., ¶ 12.  In the time since the Complaint was filed, however, both men have been granted \nasylum and released from detention.  See ECF No. 32 (Pl. Class Cert. Reply) at 15 n.6.   \n  According to Plaintiffs, this shared experience of being found to have a credible fear of \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 6 of 38\npersecution but then being denied parole is indicative of the issue at the crux of this case – \nnamely, the allegation that certain ICE Field Offices are no longer providing individualized \nparole determinations pursuant to the 2009 Directive.  In support of this claim, Plaintiffs point to \nthe steep descent of parole-grant rates in the initial months of the current administration.  Citing \nfigures showing that nearly 100% of parole requests processed by the five Field Offices at issue \nhave been denied, Plaintiffs allege that the Government is no longer following its own parole \npolicies.   \nThis past spring, the asylum-seekers looked elsewhere to vindicate their claims.  On \nMarch 15, 2018, they brought a class-action suit in this Court, challenging the parole regime \ncurrently in place at the Detroit, El Paso, Los Angeles, Newark, and Philadelphia ICE Field \nOffices.  See Compl., ¶¶ 21-25.  They claim that these Field Offices are categorically denying \nparole, an approach that Plaintiffs contend is contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious in \ncontravention of the APA and the INA.  Id., ¶¶ 66-74.  They additionally bring a freestanding \nallegation that the current state of the parole system violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  Id., ¶¶ 75-80.  Presently before the Court are Plaintiffs’ Motions for a preliminary \ninjunction requiring that Defendants follow the Parole Directive during the pendency of this suit, \nas well as for provisional class certification for purposes of the requested injunction.  Defendants \noppose both Motions and separately seek dismissal of the suit under Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  In keeping with the expedited nature of a preliminary-\ninjunction proceeding, the Court held a hearing on May 17, 2018, after which it ordered further \nbriefing on the issue of class certification.  See ECF Order of May 29, 2018.  That briefing \ncomplete, this Opinion regarding injunctive relief now follows.  Given the result, the Court does \nnot now tackle Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 7 of 38\nII.  Legal Standard \n \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter \nv. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  A party seeking preliminary relief must make a “clear \n‘showing that four factors, taken together, warrant relief: likely success on the merits, likely \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, a balance of the equities in its favor, and \naccord with the public interest.’”  League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d \n1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Pursuing America’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 505 (D.C. \nCir. 2016)).  “The moving party bears the burden of persuasion and must demonstrate, ‘by a \nclear showing,’ that the requested relief is warranted.”  Hospitality Staffing Solutions, LLC v. \nReyes, 736 F. Supp. 2d 192, 197 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. \nEngland, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). \nBefore the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, courts weighed these factors on a \n“sliding scale,” allowing “an unusually strong showing on one of the factors” to overcome a \nweaker showing on another.  Davis v. PBGC, 571 F.3d 1288, 1291-92 (D.C. Cir. 2009); see \nDavenport v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 166 F.3d 356, 360-61 (D.C. Cir. 1999).  This Circuit has \nhinted, though not held, that Winter – which overturned the Ninth Circuit’s “possibility of \nirreparable harm” standard – establishes that “likelihood of irreparable harm” and “likelihood of \nsuccess” are “‘independent, free-standing requirement[s].’”  Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, \n392-93 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Davis, 571 F.3d at 1296 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring)); see \nLeague of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 7 (declining to address whether “sliding scale” approach \nis valid after Winter).  Unresolved, too, is the related question of “whether, in cases where the \nother three factors strongly favor issuing an injunction, a plaintiff need only raise a ‘serious legal \nquestion’ on the merits.”  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citation \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 8 of 38\nomitted).  Regardless of the extent to which showings of irreparable harm and success on the \nmerits can be diminished, however, it is clear that where the plaintiff can show neither harm nor \nsuccess, no relief is warranted.  See Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, \n205 F. Supp. 3d 4, 26 (D.D.C. 2016). \nIII.  Analysis \n \n  At the heart of Plaintiffs’ suit is their assertion that, under the current administration, the \nparole practices at the five Field Offices have drastically departed from the policies and \nprotections enshrined in the 2009 ICE Directive.  Offering comparative statistics as well as \ndeclarations from detained asylum-seekers and their counsel, Plaintiffs contend that parole has \nbeen effectively eliminated as an option and detention has instead become the status quo.  They \nattribute this shift in part to the Trump administration’s emphasis on “deterrence” and “zero-\ntolerance” when it comes to the treatment of undocumented individuals.  Defendants contest this \ncharacterization, claiming instead that there is no “deterrence policy” in place, that they continue \nto implement the ICE Directive, and that parole remains available to asylum-seekers at the five \nField Offices.  \n  Before turning to its analysis of these issues, however, the Court must first address two \nthreshold complications: justiciability and class certification.  According to Defendants, the \nasylum-seekers’ case cannot proceed because this Court lacks jurisdiction over their claims and \nbecause they do not present a proper class.  Disagreeing on both fronts, the Court will discuss \nthese points separately before tackling the merits of injunctive relief.  \n \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 9 of 38\nA.  Preliminary Issues \n \n1.  Jurisdiction  \nDefendants raise a bevy of jurisdictional objections.  Specifically, the Government \nalleges that Plaintiffs’ claims challenging the parole process are barred by 8 U.S.C. § \n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) and their request for classwide injunctive relief by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1).  \nUltimately, the Court concludes that these alleged jurisdictional hurdles are easily cleared by the \nasylum-seekers, and that their claims may therefore proceed.  \nOne arrow Defendants pluck from their justiciability quiver relies on on 8 U.S.C. § \n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which provides:  \n[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to review . . . any other \ndecision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of \nHomeland Security the authority for which is specified under \nthis subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General \nor the Secretary of Homeland Security. \n \nAccording to the Government, Plaintiffs are improperly attempting to challenge “ICE officers’ \ndiscretionary weighing of the evidence.”  ECF No. 26 (Def. PI Reply) at 4.   \nTo the extent Plaintiffs are challenging the determinations themselves – i.e., the actual \nbalancing of the merits of each application for parole – this Court agrees that it lacks jurisdiction.  \nIt will, therefore, not inquire into the specific strengths or weaknesses of the parole decisions \nunder dispute, including Plaintiffs’ allegation that certain of the proffered rationales for denial \nwere “pretextual.”  ECF No. 24 at 8-10.  Yet the asylum-seekers do not rest their case on a \nchallenge to discrete parole determinations.  Rather, they allege that ICE is, as a matter of \ngeneral course, not complying with the policies and procedures of the Parole Directive.  In other \nwords, they are not challenging the outcome of ICE’s decisionmaking, but the method by which \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 10 of 38\nparole is currently being granted (or denied).  The question, therefore, is whether such a claim \nfalls within the scope of § 1252(a).  \nAs the Supreme Court held in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001), § \n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not entirely strip federal courts of jurisdiction over claims relating to the \nparole process.  In that case, the petitioners challenged the Attorney General’s authority to detain \nthem indefinitely beyond the removal period.  Id. at 682.  The Court held that, although §1252(a) \nprecludes judicial review of the discretionary determination to detain a noncitizen, the petitioners \nwere not in fact challenging such decisionmaking.  Instead, “they challenge[d] the extent of the \nAttorney General’s authority,” a claim that the Supreme Court held fell outside the scope of § \n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  Id. at 688.   \nThis Court reached a similar conclusion when interpreting a parallel jurisdictional bar, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1226(e), in its decision in R.I.L-R. v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164 (D.D.C. 2015).  As \nhere, the provision at issue in that case precluded judicial review over any decision by the \nAttorney General regarding the “grant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole.”  Id. at 176.  Yet, \nbecause Plaintiffs in R.I.L-R. were contesting the policies underlying their detention, and not \n“th[e] discretionary determinations granting or denying bond or parole in an individual case,” the \nCourt found that it had subject-matter jurisdiction.  Id. at 177.  Here, too, Plaintiffs are \n“challeng[ing] an overarching agency” action as unlawful – in this case, Defendants’ systematic \nfailure to follow the Parole Directive and to instead impose detention without its safeguards and \nindividualized determinations.  Id. at 176.  As a district court held last year when presented with \nnearly identical claims by a putative class of asylum-seekers detained at the Buffalo Federal \nDetention Facility, Plaintiffs are not asking for this Court to review the propriety of any given \nparole decision, but, instead, “simply seek compliance with certain minimum procedural \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 11 of 38\nsafeguards when parole decisions are made” by requiring that Defendants follow the Directive.  \nAbdi v. Duke, 280 F. Supp. 3d 373, 385 (W.D.N.Y. 2017).  This Court agrees that such claims \ndo not fall within the jurisdictional bar of 1252(a).  Id. at 384 (“Petitioners are asking that this \nCourt ensure that Respondents comply with certain policies and procedures in making th[e] \nparole decision – issues that are beyond the jurisdictional bar of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).”).   \nDefendants additionally assert that the classwide injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs is \njurisdictionally barred by a separate provision of the INA.  See ECF No. 22 (Def. Opp. to PI) at \n10-12.  Specifically, they point to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1), which provides that “no court (other \nthan the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of \nthe provisions of [8 U.S.C. §§ 1221-1232], other than with respect to . . . an individual alien \nagainst whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.”  According to Defendants, to \ngrant relief in this case, the Court would need to enjoin the operations of ICE in carrying out its \ndelegated powers on a classwide basis –  relief that they allege is prohibited under 8 U.S.C. § \n1252(f)(1).  See Def. PI Opp. at 10-12.  \n Even assuming that Plaintiffs’ claims fall within the provisions addressed by § \n1252(f)(1) – a premise that is disputed by the parties – Defendants’ jurisdictional argument is \neasily defeated.  As this Court noted in R.I.L.-R., Section 1252(f)(1) “prohibits only injunction of \n‘the operation of’ the detention statutes.”  80 F. Supp. 3d at 184 (citing Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 \nF.3d 1105, 1120 (9th Cir. 2010)).  Put another way, “[w]here . . . a petitioner seeks to enjoin \nconduct that allegedly is not even authorized[,]  . . . the court is not enjoining the operation of \n[the statute], and § 1252(f)(1) therefore is not implicated.”  Id. (citing Rodriguez, 591 F.3d at \n1120) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Here, Plaintiffs do not seek to “enjoin or \nrestrain the operation” of any provision of the INA.  Instead, they ask that this Court mandate \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 12 of 38\ncompliance with the Parole Directive, which addresses the discretionary authority of the \nAttorney General to grant temporary parole.  As a classwide injunction in this case would not \nobstruct the “operation of” any statute, but merely require conduct that complies with ICE’s own \nDirective, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) does not stand in the way. \n2.  Class Certification \nTo achieve meaningful relief with respect to DHS’s allegedly unlawful actions, Plaintiffs \nsensibly ask this Court to provisionally certify a class.  To obtain certification, a plaintiff must \nshow that the proposed class satisfies all four requirements of Rule 23(a) and one of the three \nRule 23(b) requirements.  See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 345-50 (2011).  \nRule 23(a) states that a class may be certified only if: (1) it is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable (“numerosity”), (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the \nclass (“commonality”), (3) the claims or defenses of the representative are typical of those of the \nclass (“typicality”), and (4) the class representative will fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the class (“adequacy of representation”).  Plaintiffs must show, in addition, that: (1) the \nprosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class would create a risk \nof inconsistent adjudications, (2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole, or (3) questions of law or fact \ncommon to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual \nmembers.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)-(3).   \nIn deciding whether class certification is appropriate, a district court must ordinarily \nundertake a “rigorous analysis” to see that the requirements of the Rule have been satisfied.  See \nGen. Tel. Co. of SW v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982).  “Rule 23 does not set forth a mere \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 13 of 38\npleading standard.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.  Rather, the party seeking class certification \nbears the burden of “affirmatively demonstrat[ing] his compliance with the Rule – that is, he \nmust be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions \nof law or fact, etc.”  Id. (emphasis in original).   \n Plaintiffs here, however, need only provisional class certification in order for the Court \nto grant their preliminary injunction.  See Tr. of PI Hearing (May 17, 2018) at 6:6-8.  In granting \nsuch provisional certification, the Court must still satisfy itself that the requirements of Rule 23 \nhave been met.  See Berge v. United States, 949 F. Supp. 2d 36, 49 (D.D.C. 2013) (citing Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23 Advisory Committee Notes 2003 Amendments).  Its analysis is tempered, however, by \nthe understanding that such certifications “may be altered or amended before the decision on the \nmerits.”  Bame v. Dillard, No. 05-1833, 2008 WL 2168393, at *5 (D.D.C. May 22, 2008) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).   \nPlaintiffs’ proposed class consists of all arriving asylum-seekers who “are found to have \na credible fear of persecution or torture” and “who are or will be detained by ICE . . .  after \nhaving been denied parole under the authority of the [five] ICE Field Offices.”  Mot. for Class \nCert. at 5-6.  The Court must therefore consider whether this class, as defined, meets the \nrequirements under Rule 23.  It will begin by addressing Defendants’ threshold contention that \nthe class cannot be certified because certain members lack standing, and then briefly analyze the \nfirst and fourth prongs of Rule 23(a), neither of which Defendants contest.  It then assesses the \nsecond and third specifications together, both of which are disputed.  Finally, it considers \nwhether Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden under Rule 23(b).     \n \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 14 of 38\na.  Standing \nDefendants first attack Plaintiffs’ standing to bring a classwide suit.  According to the \nGovernment, Plaintiffs’ request that this Court “certify a class that includes all arriving asylum \nseekers who are found to have a credible fear . . .  who are or will be detained by ICE after \nhaving been denied parole under the authority of [the five] Field Offices”  cannot proceed \nbecause the class definition “includes persons who have not experienced the harm Plaintiffs \nallege.”  Opp. to Class Cert. at 28.  The asylum-seekers reply that “[t]o the contrary, all class \nmembers have been denied parole pursuant to Defendants’ de facto parole denial policy and thus \nhave suffered the injury alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint.”  Pl. Class Cert. Reply at 14.   \n To establish standing, a plaintiff “must, generally speaking, demonstrate that he has \nsuffered ‘injury in fact,’ that the injury is ‘fairly traceable’ to the actions of the defendant, and \nthat the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n162 (1997) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561 (1992); Valley Forge \nChristian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, \n471-472 (1982)).  Standing is assessed “upon the facts as they exist at the time the complaint is \nfiled,”  Natural Law Party of U.S. v. Fed. Elec. Comm’n, 111 F. Supp. 2d 33, 41 (D.D.C. 2000), \nand “Rule 23’s requirements must be interpreted in keeping with Article III constraints.”  \nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 592 (1997). \n  Here, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately established the standing of their \nclass members.  As defined, the putative class includes only arriving asylum-seekers who have \nbeen or will be detained by the five ICE Field Offices after having been denied parole.  Each of \nthese individuals has suffered a concrete injury – detention imposed without the protections of \nthe Parole Directive – from the Government’s refusal to grant them the Directive’s requisite \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 15 of 38\nprocesses and protections.  Although the Government asserts that “not all putative class members \nhave been injured by Defendants’ purported policy . . . [as] not all persons detained at the Field \nOffices were denied parole,” Opp. to Class Cert. at 28, this line of argument entirely ignores \nPlaintiffs’ definition of the class as including only those asylum-seekers who are or will be \ndetained “after having been denied parole.”  Pl. Class Cert. Reply at 15 (emphasis altered).  The \n(albeit negligible) percentage of asylum-seekers released by the Field Offices does not, therefore, \nundermine Plaintiffs’ classwide standing, as they are explicitly excluded from the definition of \nthe class.     \n  For those individuals who are (or will be) detained after being denied release on parole, \nPlaintiffs adequately allege that the Government is engaging in injurious conduct, the resolution \nof which would likely be redressed by a favorable decision by this Court.  According to \nPlaintiffs, their detention is the direct result of the Field Offices’ current departure from the \nprotections of the Parole Directive in favor of de facto detention – an allegation that, as discussed \nin more depth below, is robustly supported by statistics and other record evidence.  In light of the \nprior substantial grant rates under the Directive and the near-uniform detention of asylum-\nseekers under the current administration, it is in no sense “speculative” that enjoining the Field \nOffices to implement the Directive would render Plaintiffs’ release far more likely.  As this \nCircuit has emphasized, “A significant increase in the likelihood that [a litigant] would obtain \nrelief that directly redresses the injury suffered will suffice for standing.”  Nat’l Parks \nConservation Ass’n v. Manson, 414 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks \nomitted); accord Lichoulas v. FERC, 606 F.3d 769, 775 (D.C. Cir. 2010).  Granting the \ninjunctive relief in this case would mandate compliance with the procedures and policies of the \nDirective and would therefore result in a greater opportunity for class members’ release on \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 16 of 38\nparole.  The Court is, consequently, satisfied that the requirements of Article III are met by the \nproposed class.  \nb.  Numerosity \nThe numerosity requirement is determined case by case and “‘imposes no absolute \nlimitations.’”  Bynum v. D.C., 214 F.R.D. 27, 32 (D.D.C. 2003) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. v. \nEEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980)).  Plaintiffs need not prove exactly how many people fall \nwithin the class to merit certification.  See, e.g., Kifafi v. Hilton Hotels Retirement Plan, 189 \nF.R.D. 174, 176 (D.D.C. 1999) (“So long as there is a reasonable basis for the estimate provided, \nthe numerosity requirement can be satisfied without precise numbers.”).  As a general \nbenchmark, “courts have found that a proposed class consisting of at least forty members” \nsatisfies this requirement.  Johnson v. D.C., 248 F.R.D. 46, 52 (D.D.C. 2008) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted); accord Taylor v. District of Columbia Water & Sewer Auth., 241 \nF.R.D. 33, 37 (D.D.C. 2007); Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 32.  \nDefendants do not challenge the numerosity of the proposed class, and rightly so.  \nPlaintiffs have provided ample evidence that a large number of asylum-seekers – well over 40 – \nhave been denied parole at the five Field Offices, see ECF No. 17-10 (Decl. of Anne Daher), ¶ \n10, and state that the “Government itself has identified nearly 800 class members.”  Mot. for \nClass Cert. at 1.  As discussed below, they have further demonstrated that the detention of class \nmembers is sufficiently tethered to ICE’s compliance, or lack thereof, with the protections and \nprocedures enshrined in the Parole Directive.  Nothing more is needed to satisfy the numerosity \nrequirement under Rule 23.   \nc.   Adequacy of Representation \nIn order to satisfy this prerequisite, Plaintiffs must show both that (1) there is no conflict \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 17 of 38\nof interest between the named members and the rest of the class, and that (2) counsel is \ncompetent to represent the class.  See Twelve John Does v. D.C., 117 F.3d 571, 575 (D.C. Cir. \n1997); Johnson, 248 F.R.D. at 53-54; Taylor, 241 F.R.D. at 45; Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 35.  No \ntrace of a conflict exists here, and Plaintiffs are represented by very capable counsel from the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union and Covington & Burling LLP.  Defendants, appropriately, do \nnot dispute that these requirements have been met either.  \nd.   Commonality and Typicality \nThe Government, conversely, finds greater traction in citing two other prongs of the \ncertification test.  Rule 23(a)(2) – commonality – requires that Plaintiffs establish that “there are \nquestions of law or fact common to the class.”  Class members’ claims must depend on “a \ncommon contention [that] is capable of classwide resolution – which means that determination of \nits truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in \none stroke.”  Wal-Mart Stores, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.  In other words, the representative plaintiffs \nmust show that the class members have “suffered the same injury.”  Id. (citation omitted).  As the \nD.C. Circuit explained, commonality is satisfied where there is “a uniform policy or practice that \naffects all class members.”  D.L. v. District of Columbia, 713 F.3d 120, 128 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \nTo demonstrate typicality, as required by Rule 23(a)(3), Plaintiffs must show that their \nclaims are “typical of the claims . . . of the class.”  Typicality means that the representative \nplaintiffs must “possess the same interest and suffer the same injury” as the other class members.  \nSee Falcon, 457 U.S. at 156 (citations omitted).  The commonality and typicality requirements \noften overlap because both “serve as ‘guideposts’” to determine whether a class action is \npractical and whether the representative plaintiffs’ claims are sufficiently interrelated with the \nclass claims to protect absent class members.  See Taylor, 241 F.R.D. at 44-45 (quoting Falcon, \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 18 of 38\n457 U.S. at 157 n.13).  Here, as Defendants’ principal challenge to class certification goes to \nboth, the Court considers them together.  \nContending that Plaintiffs have been unable to establish a categorical practice affecting \nparole at the five Field Offices, Defendants argue that a class action is an improper vehicle to \nchallenge their alleged failure to conform with the Parole Directive.  According to the \nGovernment, Plaintiffs “allege a variety of procedural and substantive violations of the Parole \nDirective facially unconnected to any coordinated agency action.”  Def. Opp. to Cert at 1.  They \ncontend, therefore, that class certification is not available here because the asylum-seekers \n“cannot credibly identify any single policy or practice that bridges all their claims.”  Id. (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  Put another way, under the Government’s view of the \ncase, Plaintiffs are not challenging any uniform agency policy, but instead contest “the manner in \nwhich ICE has exercised its discretionary parole authority in more than a thousand different \ncases.”  Id. at 26 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  DHS goes on to argue that the \n“fundamental flaw in Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification is that it does not provide any \nevidence linking each Plaintiff’s denied parole applications to a single or ‘indivisible’ \ngovernment action capable of being enjoined ‘in one stroke.’”  Id. at 27 (citing Wal-Mart, 564 \nU.S. at 350) (emphasis added). \nThis argument bears a striking resemblance to Defendants’ objection that Plaintiffs have \nnot established a common injury for the purposes of standing, and, for similar reasons, the Court \nrejects it here as well.  While it is true that the reasons for any given discretionary detention \ncannot necessarily be proven on an individualized basis, the Government has nonetheless \nconceded that ICE is required to follow the Directive when determining parole for asylum-\nseekers who have established a credible fear of persecution.  See Def. Reply at 5.  Plaintiffs here \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 19 of 38\nhave provided ample evidence that, in the initial months of the current administration, nearly \nevery application for parole from such individuals has been denied.  This is in sharp contrast to \nthe prior parole-grant rates, and, as discussed in depth below, indicates a likely departure from \nthe policies and processes mandated by the Parole Directive. \n The Court can, therefore, conclude that a “common question[] of law and fact” unites the \nclass members’ claims – namely, the allegation that the five ICE Field Officers are no longer \nproviding the “individualized determinations” of parole eligibility and procedural protections \nrequired by the Parole Directive.  See D.L. v. D.C. (D.L. II), 860 F.3d 713, 724-26 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) (evidence suggesting failure to follow statutory provisions satisfies commonality); R.I.L-\nR., 80 F. Supp. 3d at 182 (holding that “ample evidence that nearly every Central American \nfamily apprehended since June 2014 has been detained” supports conclusion that “common \nquestions of law and fact united the class members’ claims”).  Such a showing provides the “glue \nholding” the alleged basis for the putative class’s detention “together.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at \n352.  The asylum-seekers acknowledge that the circumstances of their detention may vary, but \nthey have sufficiently identified a common cause and injury as a result of the current parole \nregime and ICE’s departure from the mandates of the Parole Directive.  See Pl. Class Cert. Reply \nat 5-6. \nThe fact that the precise role this alleged failure to follow the Directive played in any \nspecific determination may differ among the Plaintiffs does not destroy the fact that all (or nearly \nall) class members were subjected to the same system of de facto parole denial.  Indeed, as this \nCircuit has held, if there is a “single” common question, “factual variations among the class \nmembers will not defeat the commonality requirement.”  Hardy v. D.C., 283 F.R.D. 20, 24 \n(D.D.C. 2012) (quoting Bynum v. D.C., 214 F.R.D. 27, 33 (D.D.C. 2003)).  As the court held in \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 20 of 38\nAbdi when faced with the question of certifying the class of detained asylum-seekers at the \nBuffalo ICE Field Office, the question of whether Defendants were providing “certain \nprocedural safeguards when adjudicating parole . . . determinations” is a common question that \nwill “generate common answers apt to drive resolution of the litigation.”  323 F.R.D. at 141 \n(citation omitted).  The court therefore rejected the Government’s contention, repeated here, that \nthe request to certify the class could not proceed “because the claims require individualized \nfactual determinations.”  Id.; see also Borum v. Brentwood Vill., LLC,  324 F.R.D. 1, 15-16 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (no requirement under Rule 23 that “all members of the putative class will be \naffected by the policy in the same way”); Nio v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 323  F.R.D. 28, 32 \n(D.D.C. 2017) (“factual variations among class members” do not trump “the overarching \nquestions common to the class” addressing the “legal authority to implement [the challenged] \npolicies and practices”).  \n This Court agrees with the sound reasoning of Judge Wolford of the Western District of \nNew York.  Contrary to the Government’s assertion that “[i]f the class is certified, the Court will \nbe forced to hear individualized evidence of ICE’s compliance or alleged non-compliance with \nthe Parole Directive for potentially every putative class member,” the resolution of this case \nwould require no such piecemeal litigation.  See Def. Opp. to Cert. at 32.  Rather, Plaintiffs ask \nthis Court to determine only whether, as a general matter, the five Field Offices are following the \nDirective or are instead systematically denying parole.  Analyzing this issue thus requires only a \ncommon, programmatic analysis, as the specific facts of each denial matter not if Plaintiffs are \ncorrect in their claim that the Directive is no longer in force overall.   \nNor is commonality defeated by the fact that a small percentage of asylum-seekers were, \nin fact, released from two of the five Field Offices.  As Plaintiffs correctly note, “A policy or \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 21 of 38\npractice may satisfy Rule 23(a)(2), even when it is substantially less uniform than the near-100% \nparole-denial rates at issue here.”  Pl. Class Cert. Reply at 5.  See, e.g., Hoyte v. D.C., 2017 WL \n3208456, at *10 (D.D.C. July 27, 2017) (commonality found when 43% of claims conformed to \nalleged D.C. practice of failing to provide interim hearings).  \nFinally, the Court can also dispose of Defendants’ contention that Plaintiffs are unable to \nestablish commonality because they do not allege a common motive underlying the Field \nOffices’ departure from the Parole Directive.  See Opp. to Class Cert at 30-32, 39.  As this \nCircuit held in D.L. II, a common motive is not required under Rule 23 when “liability does not \ndepend on the reason for a defendant’s failure” to follow the law.  See 860 F.3d at 725 \n(distinguishing Wal-Mart on ground that “crux of the inquiry” under Title VII “is the reason for a \nparticular employment decision”).  Here, although Plaintiffs identify “deterrence” as the \nmotivating factor behind the lack of individualized parole determinations and compliance with \nthe Directive, the Court need not find any such common intention in order to certify the class.  \nThe asylum-seekers’ claims rest not on the impetus behind the Field Offices’ practices, but, \ninstead, on the very fact that they are no longer following the binding guidance of the Parole \nDirective.  See Pl. PI Brief at 17-19, 23-26, 28-31; see also Garnett, 2018 WL 1524748, at *5 \n(“The question the Court confronts is simply whether the applications are being . . . processed” \nlawfully, “not why they are . . . not.”) (emphasis added).  \nThe same reasoning applies to Defendants’ challenge to typicality.  The Government \nalleges that Plaintiffs “point to no evidence that the five ICE Field Offices have engaged in the \n‘unitary course of conduct’ they allege . . . and so no named Plaintiff can say that his claim is \n‘typical’ of anyone else’s.”  Opp. to Class Cert. at 40 (citation omitted).  Again, the typicality \nrequirement is satisfied when the claims of the class representatives “arise from the same course \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 22 of 38\nof conduct, series or events, or legal theories of other class members.”  Hoyte, 2017 WL \n3208456, at *4 (citation omitted).  Here, it is clear from Plaintiffs’ filings and affidavits that the \nnine named class members have each alleged a personal deprivation of the protections of the \nParole Directive, contending that they have instead been denied the opportunity for release under \nthe Field Offices’ current practice of nearly uniform detention.  Although the specific details of \neach named Plaintiff’s parole adjudication may vary, the crux of their allegations is typical of the \nclaims of the putative class that the Government is no longer providing asylum-seekers with the \nindividualized determinations and opportunities for release required under the Directive.  In light \nof the record evidence of a current no-parole regime in place at the five Field Offices, see \nSection III. B, infra, such allegations are sufficiently tethered to a uniform course of \ngovernmental conduct.  Defendants’ various objections thus parried, the Court finds that \ncommonality and typicality have been established. \ne.   Rule 23(b)(2) \nTo obtain certification, a proposed class must also satisfy just one of the three Rule 23(b) \nspecifications.  Plaintiffs here invoke Rule 23(b)(2), which sets forth two basic requirements: (1) \nthe party opposing the class must have “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \nthe class,” and (2) “final relief of an injunctive nature or a corresponding declaratory nature, \nsettling the legality of the behavior with respect to the class as a whole, must be appropriate.”  \nPut otherwise, Rule 23(b)(2) codifies the “presumption that the interests of the class members are \ncohesive.”  Lightfoot v. D.C., 273 F.R.D. 314, 329 (D.D.C. 2011).  \nIn disputing that this cohesion requirement has been satisfied, Defendants regurgitate a \nvariant of the same challenge they raised to standing, typicality, and commonality – to wit, that \nPlaintiffs have not shown that “all putative class members warrant the same relief for the same \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 23 of 38\nreasons.”  Opp. to Class Cert. at 41.  Once again, the Court cannot concur.  Plaintiffs allege that \nthe five Field Offices no longer follow the policies and procedures outlined in the 2009 Parole \nDirective.  They seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring compliance with the Directive \nand mandating that the Field Offices provide the individualized parole determinations and \nprotections required by such agency guidance.  Contrary to the Government’s argument that “it \nis difficult to see how each individual alleged violation of the Parole Directive would be \namenable to resolution on a classwide basis,” id. at 42, the asylum-seekers are not asking for this \nCourt to remedy discrete errors in their parole determinations or to interfere with ICE’s \ndiscretionary decisionmaking.  Rather, Plaintiffs ask only that the Court address an alleged \nsystematic harm – the failure of the Field Offices to comply with the Directive.  This departure \nfrom the Directive is an agency action “generally applicable” to all class members, and a \ndetermination of whether that practice is unlawful would therefore resolve all members’ claims \n“in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart Stores, 564 U.S. at 350; see R.I.L-R., 80 F. Supp. 3d at 182 (Rule \n23(b)(2) satisfied when class challenges agency action “generally applicable to all class \nmembers”).  Rule 23(b)(2) thus poses no obstacle to class certification.   \nB.  The Merits \n \nThe undercard bouts now concluded, the Court turns to the main event: the merits of \nPlaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction.  The Complaint provides three distinct grounds \nfor such relief.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that DHS’s actions: (1) are contrary to law under \nthe APA by failing to follow the Parole Directive; (2) violate the APA by failing to conform with \nthe INA; and (3) abridge Plaintiffs’ due-process rights under the Fifth Amendment.  See Mot. for \nPI at 1-3.  Because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ first theory warrants relief, it will focus its \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 24 of 38\nattention accordingly.  In doing so, it addresses each of the four prongs of the preliminary-\ninjunction analysis.  \n1.  Likelihood of Success  \n \nTo remind any reader whose attention may understandably have flagged: in Count I of \ntheir Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that DHS is no longer complying with the ICE \nDirective, a practice they assert is “contrary to law” under the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \nLikelihood of success, consequently, turns on the strength of their argument that Defendants are \nfailing to follow the Directive, and that such a departure is unlawful.  This is where the rubber \nmeets the road. \nDefendants contest both the premise and the substance of Plaintiffs’ APA claims. DHS \ncontends that the asylum-seekers do not have a cause of action under the statute, that the Parole \nDirective does not provide a sound basis for the relief they seek, and that they do not \ndemonstrate that the agency is in fact failing to follow the necessary procedures. Because \nPlaintiffs’ argument in support of this count rests in large part on a somewhat obscure area of \nlaw – the so-called Accardi doctrine – the Court will first lay out the fundamentals of this \nconcept, next look at the question of whether Plaintiffs may raise such claims under the APA, \nand conclude with the alleged violations themselves.  \na.     The Accardi Doctrine  \nPlaintiffs’ first APA count is based, in large part, on the “Accardi doctrine,” which they \nallege requires Defendants to follow the ICE Directive in adjudicating parole determinations.  \nThis doctrine arises from a 1954 Supreme Court decision, United States ex rel. Accardi v. \nShaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954), in which the Court vacated a deportation order because it \nwas issued without procedures that conformed to the relevant agency regulations.  The Court \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 25 of 38\nstated that “[r]egulations with the force and effect of law supplement the bare bones” of federal \nstatutes, and that, even in areas of expansive discretion, agencies must follow their own “existing \nvalid regulations.”  Id. at 266, 268.  Two decades later, in Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 232 \n(1974), the Supreme Court returned to the doctrine – this time striking down a Bureau of Indian \nAffairs benefits determination because it did not comply with the procedures set forth in the \nagency’s internal manual.  In doing so, the Court noted that Accardi’s teachings apply with \nparticular force in those cases in which “the rights of individuals are affected,” stating that “it is \nincumbent upon agencies to follow their own procedures . . . even where [they] are possibly \nmore rigorous than otherwise would be required.”  Id. at 235.  \nThis Circuit and district courts here have subsequently invoked the doctrine, noting that \n“Accardi has come to stand for the proposition that agencies may not violate their own rules and \nregulations to the prejudice of others.”  Battle v. FAA, 393 F.3d 1330, 1336 (D.C. Cir. 2005); see \nalso Steenholdt v. FAA, 314 F.3d 633, 639 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“The Accardi doctrine requires \nfederal agencies to follow their own rules, even gratuitous procedural rules that limit otherwise \ndiscretionary actions.”); Wilkinson v. Legal Servs. Corp., 27 F. Supp. 2d 32, 34 n.3 (D.D.C. \n1998) (citing Accardi and stating that “government agencies are bound to follow their own rules, \neven self-imposed procedural rules that limit otherwise discretionary decisions”); Vanover v. \nHantman, 77 F. Supp. 2d 91, 103 (D.D.C. 1999), aff'd, 38 F. App'x 4 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (judicial \nreview under Accardi available for “claims that an agency has acted in violation of its own \nbinding procedures where those procedures are promulgated for the protection of individuals, \neven where the procedures were not issued as formal regulations”); Jefferson v. Harris, 285 F. \nSupp. 3d 173, 185 (D.D.C. 2018).  And, in the immigration context, the Second Circuit has \nexplained that the Accardi doctrine’s “ambit is not limited to rules attaining the status of formal \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 26 of 38\nregulation,” and that it can be applied to internal agency guidance.  See Montilla v. INS, 926 \nF.2d 162, 167 (2d Cir. 1991); see also Zhang v. Slattery, 840 F. Supp. 292, 296 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) \n(requiring that INS adhere to internal procedures in parole memorandum).   \n  The doctrine is not without its limits, however.  Courts have distinguished between those \ninternal agency regulations that are enforceable and those that remain unreviewable – drawing a \nline “between procedural rules benefitting the agency . . . and procedural rules benefitting the \nparty otherwise left unprotected . . . [or] cases in which the agency has failed to exercise \ndiscretion required by its regulations.”  Lopez v. FAA, 318 F.3d 242, 247 (D.C. Cir. 2003), as \namended (Feb. 11, 2003).  This Circuit has articulated this distinction as meaning that “agencies \ncannot relax or modify regulations that provide the only safeguard individuals have against \nunlimited agency discretion.”  Id.  Similarly, the Supreme Court has held that the enforceability \nof agency policies depends upon whether they impose binding norms on the agency.  Vitarelli, \n359 U.S. at 539–40; Dulles, 354 U.S. at 372.  Following that guidance, this Circuit has \nsynthesized these considerations to conclude that “an agency pronouncement is transformed into \na binding norm if so intended by the agency,” a determination that takes into account the \nsubstance and intent of the agency action, as well as whether it confers individual protections or \nprivileges.  See Padula v. Webster, 822 F.2d 97, 100 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (citations omitted).  \nb.       Accardi and Parole Directive \nThe next set of questions for the Court is therefore whether Plaintiffs can bring their \nAccardi claim pursuant to their first APA count, and whether the Parole Directive falls within the \nrealm of agency rules, regulations, and guidance to which the doctrine can attach.   \nOn the initial issue, Defendants contend that the asylum-seekers’ Accardi allegations \npresent a claim without a cause of action.  According to the Government, Plaintiffs’ assertion \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 27 of 38\nthat the Field Offices are failing to follow the Parole Directive is “not cognizable under Section \n706(2) of the APA.”  Opp. to Class Cert at 26.  Plaintiffs respond that the APA empowers them \nto challenge agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, \n706(2), and that their allegation that ICE’s systematic departure from the Parole Directive is \nunlawful is thus actionable under that Act.   \nThey are correct.  “It has long been settled that a federal agency must adhere firmly to \nself-adopted rules by which the interests of others are to be regulated.”  Mass. Fair Share v. Law \nEnf't Assistance Admin., 758 F.2d 708, 711 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  As numerous courts have held, the \nAccardi doctrine therefore provides plaintiffs with a means by which they can hold agencies \naccountable to their own policies.  See, e.g., Burdue v. FAA, 774 F.3d 1076, 1082 n.2 (6th Cir. \n2014) (“Under the doctrine outlined in Accardi, a party may always challenge an agency's failure \nto abide by its own regulations.”) (internal citation omitted).  It is clear, moreover, that such \nclaims may arise under the APA.  See Schaefer v. Geren, 607 F. Supp. 2d 61, 68-70 (D.D.C. \n2009), aff'd sub nom. Schaefer v. McHugh, 608 F.3d 851 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (addressing Accardi \nclaim pursuant to allegation that Army Board for Correction of Military Records “acted \narbitrarily, capriciously, and contrary to law” in violation of APA § 706(2)(A)); Nat'l Ass'n of \nHome Builders v. Norton, 340 F.3d 835, 841, 852 (9th Cir. 2003) (upholding Accardi challenge \nunder APA § 706 and finding that “[h]aving chosen to promulgate the [] policy, the [Fish and \nWildlife Service] must follow that policy”); Alamo Exp., Inc. v. United States, 613 F.2d 96, 98 \n(5th Cir. 1980) (finding APA violation by Interstate Commerce Commission because it failed to \ncomply with internal procedure).    \nThis connection between § 706(2) and Accardi was carefully explained in a recent \nopinion from the Southern District of California addressing a different form of internal agency \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 28 of 38\nguidance on immigration, the “Operating Procedures” governing Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals.  See Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2017 WL 4340385, at *5-6 (S.D. Cal. \nSept. 29, 2017).  As the court spelled out in Torres, the plaintiffs’ allegation that Defendants had \n“fail[ed] to follow their own procedures in terminating Plaintiff’s DACA status” was properly \nframed as a claim that the agency’s actions were “arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of \ndiscretion.”  Id. at *5-6.  Such allegations, Torres concluded, fell well within the scope of the \nAccardi doctrine: “While Defendants are granted broad discretion to commence, adjudicate, and \nexecute removal orders, a fundamental principle of federal law is that a federal agency must \nfollow its own procedures.”  Id. (citing Morton, 415 U.S. at 233-35).  For an agency to violate \nthis governing maxim, the court found, would amount to an “unlawful” action under the APA.  \nId. (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)).  Agreeing with the analysis in Torres, and with the congeries of \nother cases addressing Accardi claims under the framework of administrative law, the Court \nrejects Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiffs have failed to identify a cause of action under the \nAPA. \nThe Court finds the Government’s contention that Plaintiffs may not rely on the Parole \nDirective for their Accardi claim because it is not “binding” on the agency similarly unavailing.  \nAs discussed above, the premise underlying the Accardi doctrine is that agencies can be held \naccountable to their own codifications of procedures and policies – and particularly those that \naffect individual rights.  Here, the policies and procedures contained within the Directive \nestablish a set of minimum protections for those seeking asylum, including an opportunity to \nsubmit documentation, the availability of an individualized parole interview, and an explanation \nof the reasons for a parole denial.  The Directive therefore falls squarely within the ambit of \nthose agency actions to which the doctrine may attach.  See Pacific Molasses Co. v. FTC, 356 \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 29 of 38\nF.2d 386, 389-90 (5th Cir. 1966) (“[O]nce an agency exercises its discretion and creates the \nprocedural rules under which it desires to have its actions judged, it denies itself the right to \nviolate these rules.”); Pasquini v. Morris, 700 F.2d 658, 663 n.1 (11th Cir. 1983) (“Although the \n[INS] internal operating instruction confers no substantive rights on the alien-applicant, it does \nconfer the procedural right to be considered for such status upon application.”).  \nDefendants’ reliance on language in the Directive disclaiming that the document confers \nany substantive rights does not prove otherwise.  The ICE Directive provides that it “is not \nintended to, shall not be construed to, may not be relied upon to, and does not create any rights, \nprivileges, or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the United \nStates.”  Parole Directive, ¶ 10.  The Government points to this language in refuting Plaintiffs’ \nAccardi claims, stating in its briefing that “the Parole Directive’s statement that it places \nrequirements on ICE and its officers without creating a private cause of action should be viewed \nby the Court as determinative evidence of the extent to which DHS intended to be bound by the \nDirective.”  Reply at 2-3.  Yet the Government’s subsequent statement at oral argument that the \nDirective is, in fact, binding compels the Court to find otherwise.  See Tr. at 19:12-13.  It would \nseem that this representation is in fact the “determinative evidence” of the extent to which the \nagency “intended to be bound.”  The Court will therefore take Defendants at their word that the \nDirective is binding agency policy and thus concludes that it can be challenged via an Accardi \nclaim.  \nThe Court additionally notes that, even absent such concession, the Accardi doctrine \ncould well apply to the ICE Directive.  This case is distinguishable from a prior Opinion in this \nCircuit addressing the effects of disclaimer language in agency guidance, In re Grand Jury \nSubpoena, Judith Miller, 438 F.3d 1141 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  In Miller, this Circuit held that DOJ \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 30 of 38\nguidelines for issuing subpoenas to the media – which contained language similar to that in the \nICE directive – did not create legally enforceable procedural rights.  Yet although Miller relied in \npart on the express reservation at issue in that case, it does not stand for the proposition that such \na disclaimer would necessarily defeat Plaintiffs’ claim that the Directive is binding upon and \nenforceable against DHS.  Instead, Miller explicitly distinguished Morton on the ground that the \nprocedures contained in the BIA manual at issue in that case were “intended to benefit” \nindividuals, whereas the DOJ guidelines provided no such protections and instead “exist[ed] to \nguide the Department’s exercise” of its internal decisionmaking to seek subpoenas.  See Miller, \n438 F.3d at 1152.  As discussed above, the ICE Directive falls clearly on the side of Morton \nrather than Miller, as “given the nature of the guidelines themselves, and the function they \ngovern,” the Directive was intended – at least in part – to benefit asylum-seekers navigating the \nparole process.  Id. at 1153.  The Court finds, therefore, that the disclaimer language contained \nwithin the Directive does not bar the application of the Accardi doctrine.  See Abdi, 280 F. Supp. \n3d at 389 (holding that agency cannot “avoid application of Accardi by simply disclaiming any \nbinding effect in the [D]irective itself” and that “[t]o find otherwise would render the teachings \nof Accardi and its progeny meaningless”). \nc.       Merits of Accardi Claim \nHaving determined that Plaintiffs may invoke the Accardi doctrine, the Court must now \nassess whether they are likely correct with respect to the substantive claim at the heart of this \ncase – viz., the allegation that ICE is no longer following the Directive.  As an initial matter, the \nCourt briefly addresses Plaintiffs’ assertion that the current practice at the five Field Offices of \n“denying parole in virtually all cases” is motivated by deterrence.  See Pl. PI Reply at 2.  This \nline of argument may well be true, see Pl. Class Cert. Reply at 6 n.2 (contending that “evidence \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 31 of 38\nof the Trump Administration’s deterrence goals continues to accumulate”), but, as Plaintiffs \nacknowledge, it is not necessary for the Court to delve into the basis for the agency’s alleged \ndeparture from the Directive.  See Pl. PI Reply at 14-15 (“Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary \ninjunction, regardless of whether Defendants have been motivated by deterrence.”); Tr. at 5:17-\n19; 26:20-22.  Because it need not resolve this issue of impetus, the Court turns instead to the \nrecord regarding the current parole regime at the various Field Offices.  \nIt begins with the most compelling evidence in support of Plaintiffs’ case: the raw \nnumbers.  Although Benjamin Disraeli decried “lies, damn lies, and statistics,” the numbers here \nare irrefutable.  According to records obtained by the asylum-seekers, “[D]uring the eight \nmonths from February to September 2017,” ICE’s El Paso, Philadelphia, and Newark Field \nOffices denied 100% of parole applications.  See Pl. Reply at 1.  During that same period, the \nLos Angeles and Detroit Offices denied 92% and 98% of applications, respectively.  See Daher \nDecl., ¶¶ 5-1; Compl., ¶ 38.  These figures, Plaintiffs assert, “constitute[] a marked departure \nfrom just a few years ago,” when ICE was also implementing the Parole Directive and granted \nparole to more than 90% of asylum-seekers.  See id.; Compl., ¶ 39.   \nThe Government’s response to these figures is underwhelming at best.  Indeed, as \ncounsel conceded at the hearing, in light of the numbers for the first months of the \nadministration, “there are questions” as to whether the five Field Offices are following the Parole \nDirective.  See Tr. at 19:19-25; Tr. at 20:17-25 (“[T]hose statistics certainly look like outliers” \nfrom the Parole Directive.); Tr. at 21:7-11 (Government is “trying to get more information” as to \nwhether “these five offices are following the” Directive).  Although Defendants now state that \nthey are “trying to get th[e] numbers” for intervening years, see Tr. at 20:7-8, and are “in the \nprocess of retrieving more information on the parole data,” ECF No. 31-1 (Decl. of David W. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 32 of 38\nJennings), ¶ 10, the fact remains that the only statistics submitted in this case are those cited by \nPlaintiffs.  While DHS may believe that such figures overcount the actual parole-denial rate, \ntheir speculation is not sufficient to rebut Plaintiffs’ assertion that the current release rate at the \nfive ICE Field Offices is approaching zero.  \n Defendants’ assertion that the statistics were “cherry picked” is similarly unavailing.  \nSee PI Opp. at 14.  The Government attempts to cast doubt on Plaintiffs’ figures by arguing that \nthey strategically selected the numbers from only five ICE Offices across the nations.  Yet, as \nPlaintiffs very reasonably note, “[I]t is those five Field Offices, and only those five, whose \npractices are at issue in this case.”  PI Reply at 4.  It therefore seems to make perfect sense for \nthem to present numbers from those specific locales.  Nor can Defendants allege that the asylum-\nseekers have manipulated the figures from the five Field Offices at issue.  The statistics \npresented by Plaintiffs include every parole request – more than 800 cases – recorded by ICE at \nthose offices during the first eight months of the current administration.  See Daher Decl., ¶¶ 5-\n11.  The Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs’ analysis adequately supports their claims.  \nThe Court notes, moreover, that the dramatic departure in parole-grant rates from years \npast has not been explained in any way by Defendants.  The Government does not dispute \nPlaintiffs’ assertion that “there has been no significant change in the types of asylum seekers \ntraveling to the United States,” Pl. Reply at 1, nor does it indicate any other change in \ncircumstances that would lead to a shift in how the Parole Directive is being applied.  See Pl. \nReply at 3 (noting that “Defendants do not suggest that asylum seekers detained in 2017 \nsuddenly became more apt to flee or more apt to commit crimes than those detained earlier, and \nthey make no other effort to explain the numbers”).  Instead, in February 2017, then-DHS \nSecretary John Kelly stated that the Parole Directive “remain[s] in full force and effect,” and the \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 33 of 38\nGovernment represented the same to the Supreme Court just last year.  See Def. MTD, Exh. B at \n9-10 (Kelly Memorandum); Pet. Suppl. Reply. Br., Jennings v. Rodriguez, No. 15-1204, at 6 n.2 \n(filed Feb. 21, 2017).  Declarations submitted by Defendants in this case, moreover, also state \nthat the Parole Directive remains in force.  See ECF Nos. 22-3 (Decl. of Diane L. Witte), ¶ 3; 22-\n4-5 (Declaration of Rebecca Adducci), ¶¶ 3-4.  Such representations – and the dearth of data \nsupporting the allegation that Plaintiffs’ numbers are off – place the Government in an untenable \nposition.  Defendants cannot claim that the ICE Directive remains fully in effect, and yet, at the \nsame time, provide no explanation for the sudden shift in the day-to-day treatment of asylum-\nseekers under the current administration.  Indeed, as the Government stated at argument, “The \npolicy . . . certainly envisions case by case determinations that will result in parole.”  Tr. at \n20:23-24.  Defendants concede that such an aim is “clear from reading the Parole Directive.”  Id.  \nFaced with the current record, the reasonable conclusion is that the five ICE Field Offices are not \nin fact putting this language into effect on the ground.  \nIn addition to providing the Court with these troubling statistics, Plaintiffs support their \nclaims with a number of declarations from asylum-seekers and their advocates.  The record \nincludes affidavits from each of the named Plaintiffs, all of whom assert various violations of the \nParole Directive with respect to ICE’s adjudication of their release requests.  See, e.g., Pl. PI \nMot., Exhs. 12 (N.J.J.R. Decl.), ¶ 13; 13 (Callol Decl.), ¶¶ 10, 15; 16 (A.M.M. Suppl. Decl.) at 3, \nExh. C.  Plaintiffs’ evidence also includes the statements of attorneys such as Joan Del Valle, an \nexperienced immigration lawyer, who asserts that she has been told by multiple ICE officials that \n“there is no more parole.”  Pl. Exh. 10 (Decl. of Joan Del Valle), ¶ 8; see also Pl. Exh. 4 \n(Declaration of Jessica Miles), ¶ 6 (stating that as an immigration attorney she has been told by \nICE officers that agency is “not granting parole”).  Finally, there are also declarations from \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 34 of 38\nvarious immigration practitioners stating that ICE is now denying parole to individuals who, in \nyears past, would have been granted release under the Parole Directive.  See Pl. Mot. at 8 \n(collecting statements from nine declarations).  In sum, Plaintiffs argue that “the evidence \ndemonstrates that similarly situated individuals who routinely were granted parole in prior years \nare being denied parole under the current regime,” and that the Parole Directive is thus no longer \nbeing implemented at these five locations.  See Pl. Reply at 1.  \n DHS marshals its own declarations, asserting that the named Plaintiffs were in fact given \nindividualized parole determinations and that the Directive remains in place.  Yet, as Plaintiffs \naptly note, Defendants’ declarations rely on records that have not been submitted to the Court \nand are written by individuals who largely did not have direct involvement with the specific \nadjudications.  See Pl. Reply at 5-6; Ramirez v. ICE, 2018 WL 1882861, at *14 (D.D.C. Apr. 18, \n2018) (refusing to credit declarations from ICE officials when officials were not decisionmakers \nand instead based assertions on “purported review” of documents).  And, even if given full \nweight by this Court, the statements by various ICE officials do little to rebut the overwhelming \nevidence presented by Plaintiffs.  See Huynh v. Harasz, 2016 WL 2757219, at *18-19 (N.D. Cal. \nMay 12, 2016) (denial of 215 out of 215 applications could support conclusion that agency had \nblanket policy of denying applications, even in light of evidence suggesting individualized \nreview).  Although Defendants have submitted copies of certain letters and forms sent to the \nnamed Plaintiffs regarding their parole determinations, these summary and often boilerplate \nrecords do little to shine light on whether the Field Offices did, in fact, provide individualized \ndeterminations and comply in full with the Directive.   \nIndeed, in certain cases, Defendants’ evidences cuts against DHS’s contention that it \ncontinues to follow the Parole Directive.  In the case of Plaintiff H.A.Y., the Government has \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 35 of 38\nprovided a declaration from Diane Witte of the El Paso Field Office, stating that the office \ndenied H.A.Y.’s parole request because she was “a recent entrant and thus presented a flight \nrisk.”  Witte Decl., ¶ 23.  This reasoning is contrary to the very concept of giving each applicant \nan “individualized determination,” as “recent entry” is a categorical characteristic of most, if not \nall, asylum-seekers.  For the El Paso Field Office to conclude that such entry is, itself, sufficient \nto demonstrate flight risk strongly suggests that it is not conducting the particularized \nassessments required by the Directive.  Certain of Defendants’ records similarly undermine their \nassertion that the processes mandated by the Directive remain in place, as they evince a lack of \ncompliance with its enumerated procedures.  See, e.g., ECF No. 22-6 (Declaration of Jennifer \nRitchey), Exh. 2-5 (providing records showing that Plaintiffs Castro and Callol received letters \nadvising them of the right to apply for parole only one day prior to receiving nearly identical \nboilerplate letters informing them of parole denial); compare ECF No. 23 (Decl. of Andre \nQuinones), ¶ 4 (stating that “parole interviews are not conducted in every case if the interview \nwould be superfluous”) with Parole Directive, ¶ 8.2 (“Unless an additional reasonable period of \ntime is necessary . . . no later than seven days following a finding that an arriving alien has a \ncredible fear, a [Detention and Removal Operations] officer . . . must conduct an interview with \nthe alien to assess his or her eligibility for parole”) (emphasis added); id., Witte Decl., ¶ 9 \n(discussing denial of parole for L.H.A. without interview). \nIn light of the drastic decline in parole-grant rates at the five ICE Field Offices, and the \naffidavits by the named Plaintiffs and their counsel regarding the processing of their parole \napplications, this Court finds that the asylum-seekers are able to demonstrate that individualized \nparole determinations are likely no longer par for the course.  The Court therefore finds that \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their Accardi claim that \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 36 of 38\nDefendants are not abiding by their own policies and procedures.  Having decided this critical \nissue, the Court moves on to the remaining three preliminary-injunction factors.  \n2.  Irreparable Harm \n \nTo establish the existence of the second factor, a party must demonstrate that its injury is \n“of such imminence that there is a ‘clear and present’ need for equitable relief to prevent \nirreparable harm.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. \nCir. 2006) (quoting Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  The \ninjury must also be “both certain and great; it must be actual and not theoretical.”  Id. (quoting \nWisconsin Gas, 758 F.2d at 674).  Finally, the injury must be “beyond remediation.”  Id. \n  Plaintiffs have satisfied this inquiry here.  As discussed above, the evidence they present \nsuggests that asylum-seekers are being denied parole without the protections of the ICE \nDirective.  The record indicates that, instead, they are subject to a de facto “no-parole” reality, \nunder which detention has become the default option.  It is evident, moreover, that being \ndeprived of the safeguards of the Parole Directive harms putative class members in myriad ways.  \nSee ECF No. 17-23 (Declaration of Allen S. Keller), ¶¶ 11-24 (discussing “harmful effects of \nimmigration detention on the health and well-being of asylum-seekers”); Abdi, 280 F. Supp. 3d \nat 407-08 (finding irreparable harm when asylum-seekers detained at facility failing to follow \nParole Directive).  Although Defendants contend that Plaintiffs can seek parole redeterminations, \nand thus are not subject to irreparable harm, they make no showing that such requests are any \nmore likely to be granted than the initial applications.  See Def. Opp. at 24.  Given that this Court \nhas already agreed with Plaintiffs’ contention that parole requests are being nearly uniformly \ndenied at the five Field Offices, it makes little sense to seek redetermination under the same \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 37 of 38\nregime as a route to meaningful relief.  See ECF No. 25-3 (Stambaugh Suppl. Decl.), ¶¶ 6, 10 \n(redetermination denial consisted solely of “original boilerplate parole denial letter”).  \nThe injuries at stake, furthermore, are “beyond remediation.”  Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at \n297.  Members of the proposed class do not seek monetary compensation for their injuries.  \nInstead, they seek injunctive and declaratory relief requiring that Defendants follow their own \nparole policies.  Unlike economic harm, the harm from detention pursuant to an unlawful \ndeparture from agency procedure cannot be remediated after the fact.  Cf. Davis v. Pension \nBenefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1295 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (economic losses are typically not \nirreparable because compensation can be awarded after a merits determination). \n3.    Balance of Harms and Public Interest  \nUnder the circumstances of this case, factors three and four do not require in-depth \nanalysis.  As courts in this district have recognized, “The public interest is served when \nadministrative agencies comply with their obligations under the APA.”  N. Mariana Islands v. \nUnited States, 686 F. Supp. 2d 7, 21 (D.D.C. 2009).  The Parole Directive itself, moreover, states \nthat the detention of asylum-seekers who are neither a flight risk nor dangerous is “not in the \npublic interest” and therefore requires an individualized parole determination as to whether they \nshould be released.  See Parole Directive, ¶ 6.2 (emphasis added).  In light of the Court’s \nconclusion that DHS’s current failure to follow the ICE Directive is likely unlawful, and that the \nparole practices in place at the five Field Offices cause irreparable harm to those seeking asylum, \nthe Court finds that these last two factors favor Plaintiffs as well.  \n*  *  * \nTo be clear, in finding that injunctive relief is warranted in this case, this Court is simply  \nordering that Defendants do what they already admit is required – follow the ICE Directive when \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 34   Filed 07/02/18   Page 38 of 38\nadjudicating asylum-seekers’ detention.  The Directive provides a framework of minimum \nprotections for those claiming refugee status, and, as Defendants acknowledge, it is binding on \nthe Government.  To mandate that ICE provide these baseline procedures to those entering our \ncountry – individuals who have often fled violence and persecution to seek safety on our shores – \nis no great judicial leap.  Rather, the issuance of injunctive relief in this case serves only to hold \nDefendants accountable to their own governing policies and to ensure that Plaintiffs receive the \nprotections they are due under the Parole Directive.   \nIV.    Conclusion  \nFor the aforementioned reasons, the Court will grant Plaintiffs’ Motions for a Preliminary \nInjunction and will grant provisional class certification.  A separate Order consistent with this \nOpinion shall issue this day. \n                                /s/ James E. Boasberg                 \n                        JAMES E.

Civil Action No.  18-578 (JEB) \nCHAD WOLF, Acting Secretary of the   \nDepartment of Homeland Security, et al.,  \n \n            Defendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n  About nineteen months ago, the Court entered a preliminary injunction against several \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Field Offices across the country.  In so doing, it ordered \nthe Government to follow a 2009 ICE Parole Directive — a set of principles and procedures \nestablishing the processes by which the agency must determine whether an asylum-seeker will be \nreleased from detention pending his immigration hearing.  Plaintiffs — members of a class of \nasylum-seekers — believe that one of those Field Offices is currently flouting the injunction.  \nThey thus turn to this Court, moving to hold the Government in contempt and proposing a \nnumber of measures to ensure compliance.  Following an evidentiary hearing and a second round \nof briefing, the Government, though maintaining it has carried out the Court’s instructions to the \nletter, has volunteered to implement some of these remedies.  The Court appreciates the \nGovernment’s commitment to do so, but also believes some further steps are required.  It will \ndeny the Motion for Contempt but mandate certain measures under its authority to enforce its \ninjunction.     \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 128   Filed 02/07/20   Page 2 of 10\nI.  Background \nThe underlying facts of this litigation have been set forth in detail in a prior Opinion.  See \nDamus v. Nielsen, 313 F. Supp. 3d 317, 322–25 (D.D.C. 2018).  Because the Court assumes the \nreader’s familiarity with this case, it offers only a few words on the procedural history to set the \nstage. \nIn July 2018, the Court issued an injunction against five ICE Field Offices, ordering them \nto follow the 2009 Directive.  See ECF No. 33 (PI Order); Damus, 313 F.3d at 343.  To be more \nspecific, it mandated that Defendants refrain from “denying parole to any provisional class \nmember absent an individualized determination”; that these determinations be based on the facts \nof each class member’s case; and that Defendants comply with the procedural requirements of \nthe Directive.  Id., ¶¶ 3–5.  Separately, the Court directed the Government to file monthly reports \nreflecting parole determinations at each of the five Field Offices so that it could monitor \ncompliance with the Directive and the injunction.  See Minute Orders of July 24 and Aug. 28, \n2018.   \nThe first of these reports — issued six weeks after the injunction — revealed the \npersistence of low parole rates across the board.  Not surprisingly, Plaintiffs became concerned \nthat the Government was defying the Court’s mandate.  See Damus v. Nielsen, 328 F.R.D. 1, 3 \n(D.D.C. 2018).  Their concerns only intensified after practitioners in detention facilities reported \nthat asylum-seekers were still being detained without any individualized consideration.  Id. at 4.  \nConvinced that Plaintiffs had raised a sufficient question of noncompliance, the Court permitted \nlimited discovery.  Id. at 6.  In the months that followed, Plaintiffs deposed officials from each of \nthe Field Offices at issue.  See ECF No. 77 (Pl. Contempt Motion) at 2–3; ECF No. 86 (Def. \nOpp. to Contempt Motion) at 3.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 128   Filed 02/07/20   Page 3 of 10\nIn the end, Plaintiffs concluded that the Los Angeles Field Office’s noncompliance with \nthe injunction was the most glaring.  See Pl. Contempt Mot. at 1–2, 2 n.2.  As evidence of this, \nthey point to the Office’s comparatively low grant rate — approximately 16% — from July 2018 \nto April 2019.  See ECF No. 81 (Pl. Supp. to Contempt Motion) at 1; Pl. Contempt Mot. at 8.  \nThis stands in stark contrast to the rate of 43% during the years of the previous administration, \nwhich promulgated the Directive.  See ECF No. 112 (Def. Exhibits for Hearing) at 2 (2011–16).  \nThey also rely on the deposition testimony of Gabriel Valdez, the Officer in Charge of the \nLAFO’s Adelanto Processing Center, which is currently the only detention facility operating in \nthe Los Angeles area.  See Pl. Contempt Mot. at 7–9; ECF No. 120 (Def. Response to Contempt \nSupp.) at 3 n.1.  According to Plaintiffs, Valdez all but confirmed that the Government was \nfalling short of its obligations — namely, by acknowledging that the injunction did not affect the \nparole-determination process in the least.   See Pl. Contempt Mot. at 7–11.  In addition, \ntestimony from immigration practitioners on the ground, asylum-seekers underscore, confirms \nnoncompliance.  For example, these attorneys maintain that the LAFO, contrary to the \nDirective’s instructions, is not providing detainees parole decisions in a language they can \nunderstand.  See, e.g., id., Exh. F (Declaration of Madelaine Behr), ¶ 6; Exh. I (Declaration of \nElizabeth Hercules-Paez), ¶ 6.   \nWith these grievances in mind, Plaintiffs moved for contempt against the LAFO in April \n2019.  In response, the Government advances two main arguments.  First off, it contends that, \nbecause the Directive does not require a particular grant or denial rate, Plaintiffs’ fixation on \nsuch rates is unavailing.  See Def. Opp. to Contempt Mot. at 8–9.  Second, it posits that Valdez’s \ntestimony does not stand for what asylum-seekers say it does.  Specifically, the reason he \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 128   Filed 02/07/20   Page 4 of 10\nconfirmed that the Office did not changes its polices in response to the injunction was because \nthere was no need to — it has been following the Parole Directive all along.  Id. at 7–19.   \nWith the parties unable to reach an agreement, the Court held an evidentiary hearing in \nOctober.  See Minute Order of Sept. 30, 2019.  It heard testimony from OIC Valdez, Andre \nQuinones (an LAFO Assistant Field Office Director), and an immigration practitioner.  At the \nhearing’s end, it asked both sides to provide supplemental briefing evaluating the testimony’s \neffect on their positions.  See Minute Order of Oct. 31, 2019.  Armed with those submissions, the \nCourt is now primed to proceed.     \nII.  Legal Standard \nFederal courts have “inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders \nthrough civil contempt.”  Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370 (1966).  Such power is \nvital to “the enforcement of the judgments, orders, and writs of the courts, and consequently to \nthe due administration of justice.”  Broderick v. Donaldson, 437 F.3d 1226, 1234 (D.C. Cir. \n2006) (quoting Ex parte Robinson, 86 U.S. (19 Wall) 505, 510 (1874)).  To determine whether \ncontempt is appropriate, a court evaluates whether “the putative contemnor has violated an order \nthat is clear and unambiguous,” and whether such a violation has been shown “by clear and \nconvincing evidence.”  Id. (quoting Armstrong v. Exec. Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274, \n1289 (D.C. Cir. 1993)).   \nAlong with the contempt power, a court has the authority to issue additional orders to \nenforce a prior injunction.  See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 687 (1978); see also Nat’l Law \nCtr. on Homelessness & Poverty v. U.S. Veterans Admin., 765 F. Supp. 1, 13 (D.D.C. 1991) \n(modifying injunction to ensure compliance without contempt finding).  This equitable authority \nis broad, “particularly where the enjoined party has not ‘fully complied with the court’s earlier \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 128   Filed 02/07/20   Page 5 of 10\norders.’”  Nat’l Law Ctr. on Homelessness & Poverty v. U.S. Veterans Admin., 98 F. Supp. 2d \n25, 26–27 (D.D.C. 2000) (quoting Hutto, 437 U.S. at 687).  As with the initial injunction, \nhowever, further injunctive relief must be “narrowly tailored to remedy the specific harm.”  \nAviation Consumer Action Project v. Washburn, 535 F.2d 101, 108 (D.C. Cir. 1976).   \nIII.  Analysis \nIn their Motion, Plaintiffs seek a finding of contempt and an order directing the \nGovernment to implement several remedial measures.  See ECF No. 118 (Pl. Contempt Motion \nSupp.).  According to them, the road to compliance entails four steps: (1) formal training to \ninstruct LAFO staff on the requirements of the Directive; (2) a systematic quality-assurance \nprocess to ensure that asylum-seekers are afforded individualized determinations; \n(3) individualized explanations of parole decisions instead of boilerplate forms; and (4) the \nappointment of a special master to oversee the LAFO.  Id. at 9–11.  As just mentioned, the Court \nmay order some or all of these measures as a means to enforce its prior injunction without having \nto resort to its contempt power.  Facilitating resolution here, the Government has agreed to adopt \ntwo remedial measures — viz., additional formal training and a quality-assurance program.  See \nDef. Resp. to Contempt Supp. at 18–19.  \nAs to the former, Defendants have volunteered to: (1) train frontline LAFO staff on the \nDirective “with a focus on proper procedures related to serving advisals, conducting parole \ninterviews, and making recommendations”; (2) train deciding officials on how to properly \nreview and evaluate these parole determinations; and (3) designate an LAFO officer and ICE \nattorney to conduct periodic training in that Field Office.  Id. at 18–19.  On the quality-assurance \nfront, the Government has proposed that the OIC of the Adelanto detention facility review a \ncertain number of parole determinations on a monthly basis.  Id. at 19 (capping assessment at 20 \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 128   Filed 02/07/20   Page 6 of 10\ncases every month).  Because these measures are reasonably aimed at ensuring the LAFO’s \ncompliance with the prior injunction, the Court will impose them.    \nThe Government is not yet off the hook, though, as the LAFO’s parole rates continue to \nraise the Court’s antennae.  Since the issuance of the injunction in July 2018, Defendants have \nconsidered 1,846 parole applications, denying over 80% of them.  See ECF No. 125 (Def. Jan. \n2020 Status Report) at 3 (1,488 applicants detained as flight risks; 46 detained as danger to \ncommunity).  For perspective, consider that between 2011 and 2013, the LAFO grant rate \nhovered around 80%.  See Def. Hearing Exhs. at 2.  Although that number decreased in the three \nyears that followed, the Government still granted parole nearly 40% of the time.  Id. (from 2014–\n16, 1,523 grants out of 3,864 applications).  Only a year later, following the change in \nadministration, that rate plummeted to 7%.  Id.  This drop, of course, served as the impetus for \nPlaintiffs to seek injunctive relief in the first place.  See Damus, 313 F. Supp. 3d at 323–25.  It is \nno surprise, then, that Plaintiffs’ takeaway from the recent statistics is that LAFO officials are \ndisregarding the Court’s mandate.  See Pl. Contempt Mot. Supp. at 3–4.  Asylum-seekers also \nhighlight the testimony of an immigration lawyer, who indicated that all of her clients had been \ncategorically denied parole.  See ECF No. 121 (Pl. Reply) at 2–3; id., Exh. A (Pl. Hearing \nTranscript) at 114:19–115:7.   \nOn the flip side, Defendants believe that the LAFO has abided by the Directive since \n2011.  See Def. Resp. to Contempt Supp. at 3.  To account for the persistence in low grant rates, \nthe Government points to the testimony of its witnesses Quinones and Valdez.  Id. at 6–12.  At \nthe hearing, both offered a number of reasons for why the denials have skyrocketed.  For \nexample, they recounted the influx of aliens arriving at our nation’s border without proper \nidentification documents.  See, e.g., id., Exh. A (Def. Hearing Transcript) at 43:20–25 (Valdez \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 128   Filed 02/07/20   Page 7 of 10\nnoting increase in “prepped documents”), 171:18–23 (Quinones pointing out lack of “correct or \nsufficient documents” establishing applicant’s identity).  Unlike in years past, Valdez elaborated, \nrecent parole applicants are not producing original identification documents.  Id. at 44:14–16.  \nInstead, they are providing copies of such documents, making it all the more difficult to suss out \nan applicant’s identity.  Id. at 44:16–23.  In his telling, scores of these aliens present nearly \nidentical, less-than-truthful accounts about their lack of original documentation.  Id. at 44:1–12 \n(several of those crossing through Central America alleged to have lost passports “in the jungles \nof Colombia”).   \nValdez also noted that more and more asylum-seekers are identifying community \norganizations — rather than family members — as potential parole sponsors.  Id. at 44:25–45:2.  \nThe problem with that, in his view, is that these organizations tend to offer a temporary residence \nonly.  Id. at 45:3–14.  Without a stable living situation, an applicant is less likely to receive \nnotifications about immigration proceedings.  Id. at 58:13–59:9.   And without such notice, he is \nless likely to show up at future proceedings, thereby posing a flight risk.  Id. at 58:13–59:9.   \n  Last, Valdez rationalized that the improved practices of his staff have played a role in the \nrecent parole grants.  Around 2014, he recalled, officers at the Adelanto detention facility were \nnot adequately discharging their responsibilities.  Id. at 42:3–9; 46:7–20.  In his words, his staff \ndid not “do[] their due diligence in verifying the date that was being submitted [and] . . . was \nbeing used to make evaluations.”  Id. at 75:19–23.  Concerned about these practices, Valdez has \ndirected his officers to be more diligent when corroborating information.  Id. at 47:6–8.  These \nefforts, he explained, have been a contributing factor to the “downward trend” in the grant rates.  \nId. at 42:6–9.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 128   Filed 02/07/20   Page 8 of 10\n  Although the Court found no reason to doubt the credibility of Valdez and Quinones, \ntheir testimony does not plug every hole.  Start with the position that LAFO staff are now better \nat assessing parole applications.  As Plaintiffs note, an officer’s decision on a particular \napplication is merely “a recommendation.”  Pl. Contempt Mot. Supp. at 4 (quoting Pl. Hearing \nTr. at 69:24).  That decision is next reviewed by a supervisor, who likewise provides only his \nrecommendation.  See Def. Hearing Tr. at 70:5–6, 21.  In the last step, an AFOD — the deciding \nofficial — “start[s] the whole [evaluation] process over again” and then renders the binding \ndetermination.  Id. at 71:16; Pl. Hearing Tr. at 88:24–25 (“[T]hey don’t make the decision.  I \ndo.”).  Bearing in mind that every recommendation is reviewed by an AFOD, the drop in parole \ngrants cannot be completely accounted for by more diligent lower-level staff. \n  As to documents, Valdez acknowledged that he had seen only “fluctuations,” not “trends” \nin their quality.  See Pl. Hearing Tr. at 95:16–25.  The data, moreover, show a descending \ntrajectory in grant rates, not the ebb and flow one would otherwise expect.  To be sure, there was \none meaningful spike in those rates — in June of last year, the LAFO granted parole to more \nthan 40% of applicants.  Id. at 16:16–17:3; compare ECF No. 114 (Pl. Exhibit List), Exh. 7 (Def. \nJune 2019 Status Report) with Exh. 6 (Def. May 2019 Status Report) (46 grants out of 108 \ndeterminations).  That month appears to have been an anomaly, however.  An official noted that \nthe June 2019 rate actually resulted from the closure of other facilities in the Los Angeles area.  \nSee Pl. Exh. 8 (Declaration of Jennifer Herrera), ¶ 11.  Because that led to limited detention \nspace in LAFO centers still in operation, officials had to release asylum-seekers who otherwise \nwould have been detained.  Valdez offered “no information to challenge” that testimony.  See Pl. \nHearing Tr. at 18:11.    \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 128   Filed 02/07/20   Page 9 of 10\n  Finally, as for potential sponsors, the hearing also laid bare the fact that most applicants \ncontinue to list family members and friends, rather than these organizations, as sponsors.  Id. at \n96:20–97:7.  As such, Defendants’ concern about the rise of community sponsorships — and the \nincreased flight risk associated with them — seems overblown. \nIn sum, the Government has failed to persuasively justify the fall in parole grants or \nconvincingly explain that it is following the Directive.  The Court will therefore order further \ninjunctive relief using Plaintiffs’ requests as a framework.   \nFirst, they ask that LAFO staff receive training on the Directive’s requirements.  See Pl. \nContempt Mot. Supp. at 9–10.  To that end, the Government has volunteered to implement a \nnumber of training measures — remedies that the Court has already imposed.  See supra Section \nIII at 5–6.  To ensure agency compliance, Plaintiffs may assign an attorney to review the \nLAFO’s training procedures (or be present at some trainings) insofar as this review does not \nunduly intrude into ICE’s operations.   \nSecond, asylum-seekers request a quality-assurance program.  See Pl. Contempt Mot. \nSupp. at 10.  According to them, the LAFO last engaged in a quality-assurance audit in 2016.  Id.  \nIn response, the Government has proposed a systematic review process that the Court believes \nsufficiently addresses Plaintiffs’ concerns.  See supra Section III at 5–6.   \nThird, they request that the LAFO provide individualized explanations of parole \ndecisions.  See Pl. Contempt Mot. Supp. at 10.  Plaintiffs want more than a checked box on a \nboilerplate form or a cookie-cutter parole-denial letter.  Id.  So that asylum-seekers may be better \ninformed of the reasoning behind a parole decision, the Court will require LAFO officials to \nprovide a few-sentence explanation in rendering their decisions for the time being.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00578-JEB   Document 128   Filed 02/07/20   Page 10 of 10\nFourth and finally, the Court will decline Plaintiffs’ invitation to appoint a special master \nto oversee the LAFO’s compliance with the injunction.  It believes that the above measures are \nreasonably tailored to ensure compliance.  That said, it reserves the opportunity to appoint a \nspecial master if asylum-seekers can show down the line that the Government is not complying \nwith this mandate. \nIV.  Conclusion \n  Given the injunctive relief outlined above, the Court will deny Plaintiffs’ Contempt \nMotion in part.  A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will be issued this day. \n                                /s/ James E. Boasberg                 \n                        JAMES E.
