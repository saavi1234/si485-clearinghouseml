    "summary": "<p>This action, filed on February 6, 2018, challenged the Department of Justice's \"sanctuary city\" policy tying federal funding to immigration enforcement.  The plaintiff, the city of West Palm Beach, Florida (\"the City\"), sued the DOJ after the DOJ threatened to subpoena the City for records out of suspicion that the City might be noncompliant with immigration law and therefore ineligible for federal funding. The City argued it was fully compliant with federal law, and that linking funding to particular immigration laws violated the separation of powers, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The City filed this case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. It sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</p><p>The City argued that with nearly 27% of its population consisting of foreign-born individuals, immigrants were \"an integral part of the City’s\" civic, academic, and labor communities, and that the City depended on its immigrant population. In March 2017, the complaint explained, the City adopted a resolution seeking to keep information related to one's immigration and citizenship status private while expressly providing that federal laws superseded the resolution. The City's goal was \"to foster trust between the immigrant population and City officials and employees, and to encourage people of all backgrounds to take full advantage of the City’s resources and opportunities.\" </p><p>Separately, the complaint explained that it had received nearly $400,000 in federal  Byrne JAG funding since 2006. The City argued that starting November 2017, the DOJ began targeting it for alleged compliance issues with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which prohibits localities from interfering with certain federal immigration enforcement measures. On January 25, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order tying federal funds to compliance with § 1373. The complaint stated that in a letter sent to the City in November 2017, the DOJ requested information addressing the status of the City's compliance with § 1373 and eligibility for Byrne JAG funding. The City responded to the letter to affirm its compliance and eligibility. In January 2018, the DOJ sent another letter indicating the City may be out of compliance and requesting that the City send documents relevant to the inquiry and that failure to do so would result in a subpoena. </p><p>Ultimately, the City argued that the DOJ had no statutory authority for imposing such conditions on the Byrne JAG grant. Even if Congress did intend to so authorize the DOJ, requiring certification of compliance with § 1373 violated the Spending Clause. Moreover, the City argued that its Resolution and laws were fully compliant with federal law, and that it was not a \"sanctuary city.\" </p><p>On February 21, the City moved for preliminary injunction, seeking a declaration that it was compliant with § 1373. Shortly thereafter, the parties entered into mediation. On March 23, the parties indicated they had reached a settlement. The DOJ declared that the City was in compliance with federal law, and that it was therefore eligible for the federal grant. The City agreed to end the litigation and subsequently issued a memorandum to city employees clarifying that its laws did not preclude sharing information with federal immigration officials. The parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal on March 28, and the court ordered the case closed the next day.</p><p>The case is now closed. The settlement agreement is not currently publicly available, though this page will be updated if becomes available.</p>",

SESSIONS, in his official \ncapacity as Attorney General of the United \nStates; ALAN R. HANSON, in his official  \ncapacity as Principal Deputy Assistant  \nAttorney General; JON ADLER, in his official \ncapacity as Director of the Bureau of Justice \nAssistance; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT \nOF JUSTICE   \n \n        Defendants. \n_____________________________________________/ \n \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \nPlaintiff, by and through its undersigned attorneys, commences this action against the  \nabove-named Defendants, and states as follows: \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n \n1.  Plaintiff, the City of West Palm Beach (“West Palm Beach” or “City”), brings this \naction to protect the City from Defendants’ repeated and unlawful attempts to use an established \nfederal grant program—the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”), \nwhich has for years provided crucial support for law enforcement in West Palm Beach—as the \nbasis for erroneous and recurring harassment of the City and its officials based upon wrongly \nperceived non-compliance with Title 8, Section 1373 (“Section 1373”) of the United States Code.  \n \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 2 of 34\n2.  West Palm Beach has a vibrant immigrant community, with nearly 27 percent of \nthe City’s population consisting of foreign born persons.1  As such, immigrants are an integral part \nof  the  City’s  workforce,  small  business  sector,  school  and  college  population,  and  civic \nassociations; their success is vital to the City’s success.  To ensure that West Palm Beach’s \nimmigrant community continues to thrive, the City adopted a Resolution in March 2017 that seeks \nto  foster  trust  between  the  immigrant  population  and  City  officials  and  employees,  and  to \nencourage  people  of  all  backgrounds  to  take  full  advantage  of  the  City’s  resources  and \nopportunities.  \n3.  The Resolution in question, West Palm Beach City Commission Resolution 112-\n17 (“Resolution 112-17”), protects the confidentiality of individuals’ immigration and citizenship \nstatus information, and prevents the unnecessary disclosure of that information to unauthorized \nthird parties. See Ex. 1.  The rationale behind these policies is that if immigrants do not fear adverse \nconsequences to themselves or to their families from interacting with City officers, they are more \nlikely to report crimes, apply for public benefits to which they are entitled, enroll their children in \nWest Palm Beach’s public schools, request health services like vaccines, and—all in all—\ncontribute more fully to the City’s health and prosperity.  \n4.  Resolution 112-17, however, specifically and explicitly contains several savings \nclauses which repeatedly state that all federal laws and related requirements supersede any and all \nprotections and provisions contained within the Resolution.  \n5.  The City of West Palm Beach has received Byrne JAG funding since 2006.  Over \nthe last five years, the City has received nearly $400,000 in Byrne JAG funds.  These funds have \nbecome a staple in the City’s budget and are today an important source of funding for the police \n                                                 \n1 See U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: West Palm Beach city, Florida, \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/westpalmbeachcityflorida/PST045217 (last visited Jan. 30, 2018) \n  2 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 3 of 34\ndepartment.  Prior to 2017, West Palm Beach has never had any conflicts with the federal \ngovernment in obtaining Byrne JAG funds.  \n6.  Beginning on November 15, 2017, the City of West Palm Beach, along with 28 \nother state and local jurisdictions, became the target of what Defendants deemed to be “concerns \nabout these jurisdictions’ Section 1373 compliance. . . .” See Ex. 2.  \n7.  Specifically, Defendants, via letter and press release, ordered the City to take three \nactions in November 2017: a) address whether West Palm Beach has laws, policies, or practices \nthat violate Section 1373; b) address whether West Palm Beach would comply with Section 1373 \nthroughout the award period should it receive 2017 Byrne JAG funds; and c) explain how any \nsavings clauses in Resolution 112-17 are interpreted by the City and communicated to officers or \nemployees.  See Exs. 2, 3. \n8.  Even though City officials were alarmed by Defendants’ letter at the time, given \nthe plain and unmistakable language of Resolution 112-17, the City nonetheless replied in good \nfaith to Defendants’ inquiry on November 29, 2017.  See Ex. 4.   \n9.  The City’s response explained that the plain language of Resolution 112-17 clearly \nand unequivocally requires that all employees and officers follow the law and does not in any way \nprohibit or otherwise restrict West Palm Beach officers or employees from sending information \nto,  or  receiving  information,  from  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  Immigration  and \nCustoms Enforcement, or any other Federal Agency when sending and receiving such information \nis required by Federal Law; the City of West Palm Beach Code of Ordinances; or other binding \ncourt decisions, opinions or processes.  See Ex. 4.         \n10.  The City did not take legal action against Defendants in November 2017 out of a \nspirit of good faith and because, inter alia, Defendants’ November 2017 letter specifically stated \n  3 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 4 of 34\nthat  “[t]he  Department  has  not  made  a  final  determination  regarding  West  Palm  Beach’s \ncompliance with section 1373. This letter does not constitute final agency action and nothing in \nthis letter creates any right or benefit enforceable at law against the United States.” See Ex. 3. \n11.  Despite, the City’s good faith response to Defendants’ inquiry, on January 24, 2018, \nthe City received another letter from Defendants stating that “[a]fter reviewing your response, the \nDepartment remains concerned that your jurisdiction’s laws, policies, or practices may violate \nsection 1373, or, at a minimum, that they may be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent \nwith section 1373.” See Ex. 5.   The new letter demands that the City provide the following \ndocuments to the Defendants by no later than February 23, 2018:  \nAll documents reflecting any orders, directives, instructions, or guidance to your \nlaw  enforcement  employees  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  police  officers, \ncorrectional officers, and contract employees), whether formal or informal, that \nwere  distributed,  produced,  and/or  in  effect  during  the  relevant  timeframe, \nregarding whether and how these employees may, or may not, communicate with \nthe  Department  of  Justice,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  and/or \nImmigration  and  Customs  Enforcement,  or  their  agents,  whether  directly  or \nindirectly. \n \nThe letter stated that if the City should “fail to respond in a complete and timely manner, the \nDepartment will subpoena these documents in accordance with 34 U.S.C. §§ 10225, 10221, 10230, \n10151 – 10158, 10102(a)(6), 10110, and 10110 note.”  And, the letter threatened that “[s]hould \nthe Department determine your jurisdiction is out of compliance with section 1373, the Department \nmay, as detailed in your award documents, seek return of your FY 2016 grant funds, require \nadditional conditions for receipt of any FY 2017 Byrne JAG funding for which you have applied, \nand/or deem you ineligible for FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds.” \n  4 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 5 of 34\n12.  Unlike the November 2017 letter, the January 2018 letter did not contain the \ndisclaimer that the “Department has not made a final determination,” and did not state that the \nletter did not constitute final agency action.  \n13.  At the same time Defendants sent their January 2018 letter, they also issued a press \nrelease indicating that: a) the number of jurisdictions of concern had fallen from 29 to 23, b) the \nremaining jurisdictions on the list “will be subject to a Department of Justice subpoena,” if they \nfail  to  respond  to  the  letter  to  Defendants’  satisfaction;  and  c)  that  the  Attorney  General \n“continue[d] to urge all jurisdictions under review to reconsider policies that place the safety of \ntheir communities and their residents at risk.”   See Ex. 6.  The Attorney General also stated that \n“Protecting  criminal  aliens  from  federal  immigration  authorities  defies  common  sense  and \nundermines the rule of law. We have seen too many examples of the threat to public safety \nrepresented  by  jurisdictions  that  actively  thwart  the  federal  government’s  immigration \nenforcement—enough is enough.” \n14.  The imposition of these conditions marks a radical departure from the Department \nof Justice’s past grant-making practices. No statute permits the Attorney General to impose these \nconditions on the Byrne JAG program.  Although Congress delegated certain authorities to the \nAttorney General to administer Byrne JAG awards, the Attorney General has far exceeded that \ndelegation here.  Moreover, even if Congress had intended to authorize the Attorney General to \nattach conditions of this nature to JAG grants (which it did not), that would have been unlawful:  \nDemanding that localities certify compliance with Section 1373 and provide documents proving \ntheir compliance as conditions of receiving Byrne JAG funds, would flout the limits of Congress’ \nSpending Clause powers under the United States Constitution.  \n  5 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 6 of 34\n15.  Simply put, the Attorney General’s imposition of these conditions on the FY 2016 \nand FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant is contrary to law, unconstitutional, and arbitrary and capricious.   \n16.  The City seeks a declaratory judgment confirming that its laws and policies fully \ncomply with Section 1373, to the extent that the statute is lawfully deemed applicable to the Byrne \nJAG program.   Furthermore, the City also seeks a declaration from the Court stating that \nDefendants’ imposition of the condition that the City comply with Section 1373, and respond to \npaperwork requests from Defendants seeking to verify their compliance with Section 1373, in \norder to receive JAG funding is unlawful.  Defendants’ agency actions are contrary to federal \nstatute, contrary to the Constitution’s separation of powers, and arbitrary and capricious. Further, \neven if Congress had intended to permit the Defendants’ actions, they would violate the Spending \nClause.    \n17.  The City also seeks injunctive relief.  It respectfully requests that the Court \npermanently enjoin Defendants from imposing compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 as a condition \nfor receiving Byrne JAG funding and COPS funding, as well as any other injunctive relief the \nCourt deems necessary and appropriate to require Defendants to cease and desist their repeated \nharassment of the City and its officials based upon unfounded concerns of noncompliance with \nfederal law. This includes enjoining Defendants from requiring the City to provide any further \nresponses to Defendants’ endless inquiries regarding what it is a very plainly worded City \nResolution.  \n18.  Despite the fact that the City has at all times complied Title 8 Section 1373 of the \nUnited  States  Code,  Defendants  have  repeatedly  threatened  to  withhold  and  claw  back \nCongressionally appropriated federal funds, and to harass City officials with federal subpoenas, \nbased on their purported dissatisfaction with the City’s evidence of compliance with the law.   \n  6 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 7 of 34\n19.  Defendants’ unlawful actions toward the City are inexplicable and are entirely \ndivorced from both the plain language of the City’s applicable laws and the City’s actual daily \npractices.  The City has tried in good faith to inform Defendants that there is no absolutely no legal \nor factual basis for deeming the City to be in violation of Title 8 Section 1373 of the United States \nCode, but these communications have been unsuccessful in ceasing Defendants’ unsubstantiated \nallegations against the City.  \n20.  The City is certain that its laws and practices comply with Title 8 Section 1373 of \nthe United States Code.  Nevertheless, Defendants’ unfounded concerns about the City’s laws and \npractices have placed at risk the $61,116 in JAG funds received through DOJ’s August 29, 2016 \naward and have created funding uncertainty for the City that requires the City to obtain clarity \nfrom this Court.  Additionally, the Edward Bryne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) \nProgram: FY 2016 Local Solicitation (CFDA # 16.738) states in pertinent part: “If the applicant is \nfound to be in violation of an applicable federal law [Section 1373] by the Office of Inspector \nGeneral, the applicant may be subject to criminal and civil penalties in addition to Office of Justice \nPrograms programmatic penalties, including suspension or termination of funds, inclusion on the \nhigh risk list, repayment of funds, or suspension and debarment.”   See Ex. 7.  These application \nrequirements create uncertainty as to what if any criminal and civil penalties could be imposed \nagainst the City and its employees and creates additional funding uncertainty for future awards.   \n21.  While the City has not received a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice  relating \nto its Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant awards, in his Memorandum for all \nDepartment Grant-Making Components dated May 22, 2017, the Attorney General stated that the \nDepartment of Justice will require jurisdictions applying for certain Department grants to certify \ntheir compliance with federal law, including Section 1373 as a condition for receiving an award.  \n  7 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 8 of 34\nHe further explained that the certification requirement will apply to any existing grant administered \nby the Office of Justice Programs and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services that \nexpressly contains this certification condition and to future grants for which the Department is \nstatutorily authorized to impose such a condition.  See Ex. 8.  \n22.  In fact, the 2017 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) Application Guide required the City \nto comply with the new grant condition requiring compliance with Section 1373 regarding \nprohibitions or restrictions on sending to, requesting or receiving from, maintaining, or exchanging \ninformation  on  citizenship  or  immigration  status,  including  any  prohibitions  or  restrictions \nimposed or established by a State or local government entity or official.  Failure to comply with \nall COPS Office award requirements may result in suspension or termination of award funds, the \nrepayment of award funds and/or other remedies available by law.  See Ex. 9.  \n23.  The COPS program is authorized under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 379dd et. seq, as amended and the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act in 1994, Title I Part Q, Public Laws 103-322.  The program is designed to \nincrease the capacity of law enforcement agencies to implement community policing strategies \nthat strengthen partnerships for safer communities and enhance law enforcement’s capacity to \nprevent, solve, and control crime through funding for additional officers. \n24.  The City has routinely applied for and received COPS Grant awards for hiring in \nthe amount of $900,000 in August 2003; $1,785,456 in October, 2009; and $1,250,000 in \nSeptember 2013.    The City applied for but did not received funding for FY 2017.    \n25.  These  awards  have  been  significant  to  the  City  in  implementing  community \npolicing strategies that strengthen partnerships for safer communities and enhancing the police \ndepartment’s ability to prevent, solve, and control crime through funding additional officers. \n  8 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 9 of 34\n26.  Because the same certification required for the Byrne JAG funding is required for \nthe COPS funding, the City is unsure whether future COPS awards will be subject to the \nDefendant’s unwarranted concerns relating to the City’s compliance with Section 1373 subjecting \nit to further funding uncertainty and potential civil and criminal penalties.   \n27.  In addition, the erroneous perception that Plaintiff is either a “sanctuary city” and/or \nis in violation of Section 1373 is also placing the City’s funding from the State of Florida at risk.  \nThere are several bills pending in the Florida State Legislature that would financially punish cities \nthe federal government deems as uncooperative on immigration enforcement. \n28.   For these reasons, and those discussed below, the Court should declare that the \nCity complies with Section 1373 and that Defendants’ immigration-related conditions on Byrne \nJAG funding and COPS funding are unlawful, as well as enjoining Defendants from further \ninquiring as to whether Resolution 112-17 violates Section 1373, thereby ensuring that this \nResolution can remain in effect. \nPARTIES \n29.  Plaintiff City of West Palm Beach is a city organized and existing under the \nconstitution and laws of the State of Florida.  West Palm Beach was incorporated in 1894, and is \nhome to almost nearly 110,000 residents, including a diverse array of immigrant communities from \naround the world.  Nearly 27 percent of the City’s residents are foreign born, and approximately \n31 percent of the City’s residents speak a language other than English as their primary language \nspoken at home.  \n30.  Defendant Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III is the Attorney General of the United \nStates. He is sued in his official capacity. The Attorney General is the federal official in charge of \nthe  United  States  Department  of  Justice,  which  took  and  threatens  imminently  to  take  the \n  9 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 10 of 34\ngovernmental actions at issue in this lawsuit. He is sued in his official capacity pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 702. \n31.  Defendant Alan R. Hanson is Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in \ncharge of the Office of Justice Programs, which administers JAG funding and which set forth the \nso-called “special conditions” at issue.  He is sued in his official capacity pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § \n702. \n32.  Defendant Jon Adler is the Director in charge of Bureau of Justice Assistance \nwithin the Office of Justice Programs, which administers JAG funding and which set forth the so-\ncalled “special conditions” at issue.  He is sued in his official capacity pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n33.  Defendant U.S. Department of Justice (“USDOJ”) is an executive department of \nthe United States of America pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 101 and a federal agency within the meaning \nof 28 U.S.C. § 2671. As such, it engages in agency action, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 702 \nand is named as a defendant in this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702. USDOJ is responsible for \nadministering the JAG funds appropriated by Congress. \nSTANDING AND NEED FOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF \n34.  The City of West Palm Beach is aggrieved by the actions of Defendants and has \nstanding to bring this action because of the injury to its sovereignty as a city caused by the \nchallenged federal actions. The inclusion of unconstitutional and unlawful conditions as part of \nthe Byrne JAG award impairs the City’s exercise of its police power in a manner it deems \nnecessary to protect the public safety. Because of Defendants’ unconstitutional actions, the City \nof West Palm Beach is in imminent danger of losing $61,116 in JAG funds for fiscal year 2016; \n$59,970 in JAG funds for fiscal year 2017; and any future Byrne JAG, and potentially COPS, grant \nfunds for which the City may apply. \n  10 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 11 of 34\n35.  Defendants actions have placed the City in an untenable position, with the clock \nwinding down: agree, by February 23, 2018, to accept the Department’s new unconstitutional grant \nconditions and hope that yet another explanation of its very clearly worded Resolution will allay \nthe Department’s concerns; or stand on its rights and risk forfeiting crucial funds that it has counted \non for more than a decade to provide critical (and, at times, lifesaving) equipment, technology and \nsoftware to West Palm Beach Police officers and critical services to West Palm Beach residents.  \nMoreover, the longer the erroneous perception exists that Plaintiff is either a “sanctuary city” \nand/or is in violation of Section 1373, the greater the risk to the City’s funding from the State of \nFlorida.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n36.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346.  The \nCourt is authorized to issue the relief sought here under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 701, 702, 705, 706, the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, and the Mandamus \nStatute, 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  \n37.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \nbecause this is an action against officers and agencies of the United States in their official \ncapacities, brought in the District where the subject of the action is situated, where the Plaintiff \nresides, and where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred. \n38.  This action arises within the West Palm Beach Division of this District, wherein \noccurred a substantial part of the events which give rise to the Plaintiff’s claim. \nRIPENESS \n39.  This case is ripe for adjudication because the Attorney General has decided to \nimpose the Challenged Conditions on West Palm Beach for the City to receive Byrne JAG Program \n  11 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 12 of 34\nand COPS Program funds, and that decision is one from which legal consequences will flow, \nincluding civil and criminal penalties and the loss of funds.  Moreover, Defendants specifically \nremoved the “non-final determination” language that had been included in their November 2017 \nletter from their latest letter sent in January 2018. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  WEST PALM BEACH’S POLICIES \n  A.   Introduction \n40.  West Palm Beach is a rapidly growing city and is recognized as a welcoming city \nfor immigrants from across the globe who seek good jobs and better futures for themselves and \ntheir families.  Nearly 27 percent of the City’s residents are foreign born, and approximately 31 \npercent of the City’s residents speak a language other than English as their primary language \nspoken at home.  \n41.  In early 2017, after hearing from their constituents regarding their fear of accessing \nCity services and resources, the City Commission decided to enact a resolution designed to \nreassure its residents that the City of West Palm Beach is a welcoming city that celebrates the \ndiversity of its residents.  \nB.  The City of West Palm Beach’s Resolution Number 112-17 \n42.  As stated in the City Commission Agenda Cover Memorandum, the purpose for the \nResolution was to celebrate the cultural diversity and acknowledge the positive contributions of \nthe immigrant communities in West Palm Beach.  See Ex. 1.  The City wanted to promote use of \nits services by all its residents who are eligible to receive them, and let all residents know that they \ncould seek assistance of City agencies regardless of personal or private attributes, without negative \n  12 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 13 of 34\nconsequences to their personal lives.  And, the City wanted to promote an environment of \ncooperation between the City’s immigrant communities and all City officers and employees. \n43.  The key fact supporting the Resolution was the City’s finding that assistance from \na person, whether documented or not, who is a victim of, or a witness to, a crime is important to \npromoting  the  safety  of  all  its  residents,  and  that  the  cooperation  of  the  City’s  immigrant \ncommunities is essential to prevent and solve crimes and maintain public order, safety and security \nin the entire City. \n44.  Resolution 112-17 contains two provisions that are at issue in this case that pertain \nto immigration. \n45.  Specifically, Section 3 of Resolution 112-17 states as follows: \nNo Agent or Agency shall request information about or otherwise investigate or \nassist in the investigation of the Citizenship or immigration status of any person \nunless such inquiry or investigation is required by Florida Statutes; Federal \nLaw; the City of West Palm Beach Code of Ordinances; or other binding court \ndecisions, opinions or processes. Notwithstanding this provision, the City Attorney, \nor his/her designee, may investigate and inquire about immigration status when \nrelevant to potential or actual litigation or an administrative proceeding in which \nthe Cities or may be a party. \n(emphasis added). In plain English, this provision expresses a City policy instructing employees \nnot  to  take  matters  into  their  own  hands  and  suddenly  become  self-appointed  immigration \ninvestigators when they have been hired by the City to perform other duties such as being a \nlibrarian, a social worker, or a police officer.     \n46.  By the same token, this same provision clearly and unambiguously instructs City \nemployees and agencies to conduct any and all immigration inquiries or investigations that are \nrequired under federal law. \n  13 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 14 of 34\n47.  The second provision at issue is Section 4 of Resolution 112-17, which states as \nfollows: \nNo  Agent  or  Agency  shall  disclose  information  regarding  the  Citizenship  or \nimmigration status of any person unless required to do so pursuant to Florida \nStatutes; Federal Law; the City of West Palm Beach Code of Ordinances; other \nbinding court decisions, opinions, or processes; or when such disclosure has been \nauthorized in writing by the individual to whom such information pertains, or if \nsuch  individual  is  a  minor  or  is  otherwise  not  legally  competent,  by  such \nindividual’s parent or guardian. \n(emphasis added).  In plain English, this provision expresses a City policy instructing employees \nthat, if they take possession of information regarding the Citizenship or immigration status of any \nperson in the City, they should not to take matters into their own hands and suddenly become self-\nappointed immigration enforcement officials when they have been hired by the City to perform \nother duties such as being a librarian, a social worker, or a police officer.     \n48.  By the same token, this same provision clearly and unambiguously instructs City \nemployees  and  agencies  to  provide  any  and  all  information  regarding  the  Citizenship  or \nimmigration status of any person that is required under federal law. \n49.  A further critical fact about Resolution 112-17 is that the City expressed these \nsentiments and factual findings in the form of a resolution, which is a formal expression of the \npolicy position of the City Commission which staff are encouraged to follow, as opposed to an \nordinance, which has the force and effect of a law, the violation of which may actually be enforced \nin a county or circuit court.  \n50.  Resolution 112-17 was simply a memorialization of the exact state of affairs that \nhas existed in the City of West Palm Beach for decades regarding how the City handles matters \nrelated to the immigration status of its residents.  \n \n  14 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 15 of 34\nC. Other Relevant Policies and Practices  \n \n51.  In addition to the clear and unambiguous text of Resolution 112-17, which clearly \ndoes not prohibit any cooperation between federal immigration enforcement officials and City \nOfficials, it is also well known to the Federal Government that the City of West Palm Beach \ncooperated with requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement when those requests arise.  \nIn fact, on April 9, 2015, the City of West Palm Beach has entered into a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding  with  the  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  Homeland  Security \nInvestigation, which states in pertinent part:  \nThe Parties agree that effective enforcement of the laws relating to HSI jurisdiction \nrequires close cooperation and coordination between the two Parties.  The Parties \nhave therefore entered into this MOU to govern use of HSI designations by certain \nemployees of the West Palm Beach Police Department.  . . . However in designating \nCustoms  Officers  (Excepted),  HSI  is  not  conveying  the  authority  to  enforce \nadministrative violations of immigration law.   \n \nSee Ex. 10.  \n \n52.  Moreover, when an individual is arrested by City police, they are booked into the \nPalm Beach County Jail, which is run by the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.  It is at that \nmoment when issues regarding an individual’s immigration status are likely to arise.  Any concerns \nraised  by  Defendants  about  information  sharing  between  local  police  and  Immigration  and \nCustoms Enforcement would thus occur at the County level and not at the City level.   \nII. THE BYRNE JAG PROGRAM AND 2017 GRANT CONDITIONS  \nA.   Overview of the Byrne JAG Program  \n \n53.  Congress created the modern-day Byrne JAG program in 2005 as part of the \nViolence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act. See Pub. L. No. 109-\n162 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 3751 et seq.). In fashioning the present-day Byrne JAG grant, \nCongress merged two prior grant programs that had also provided criminal justice assistance \n  15 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 16 of 34\nfunding to states and localities. These two predecessor grant programs were the Edward Byrne \nMemorial Formula Grant Program, created in 1988, and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant \nProgram.2 \n54.  Today, grants under the Byrne JAG program are the primary source of federal \ncriminal justice funding for states and localities. As stated in a 2005 House Report accompanying \nthe bill, the program’s goal is to provide State and local governments the “flexibility to spend \nmoney for programs that work for them rather than to impose a ‘one size fits all’ solution” for \nlocal policing. See H.R. Rep. No. 109-233, at 89 (2005).  \n55.  The authorizing statute for the Byrne JAG program provides that localities can \napply for funds to support a range of local programming to strengthen their criminal justice \nsystems. For instance, localities can apply for funds to support “law enforcement programs, \nprosecution and court programs, prevention and education programs, corrections and community \ncorrections programs, drug treatment and enforcement programs,” and “crime victim and witness \nprograms.” 42 U.S.C. § 3751(a)(1).  \n56.  Byrne JAG funding is structured as a formula grant, awarding funds to all eligible \ngrantees according to a prescribed formula. See 42 U.S.C. § 3755(d)(2)(A). The formula for states \nis a function of population and violent crime, see id. § 3755(a), while the formula for local \ngovernments is a function of the state’s allocation and of the ratio of violent crime in that locality \nto violent crime in the state as a whole, see id. § 3755(d).  \n57.  Unlike discretionary grants, which agencies award on a competitive basis, “formula \ngrants . . . are not awarded at the discretion of a state or federal agency but are awarded pursuant \nto a statutory formula.” City of Los Angeles v. McLaughlin, 865 F.2d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir. 1989). \n                                                 \n2 See Nathan James, Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (“JAG”) Program, Congressional Research \nService (Jan. 3, 2013), https://goo.gl/q8Tr6z. \n  16 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 17 of 34\nStates and local governments are entitled to their share of the Byrne JAG formula allocation as \nlong as their proposed programs fall within at least one of eight broadly-defined goals, see 42 \nU.S.C. § 3751(a)(1)(A)-(H), and their applications contain a series of statutorily prescribed \ncertifications and attestations, see id. § 3752(a).  \n58.  The City of West Palm Beach has filed direct applications for Byrne JAG funding \nevery year since the 2006.   All its applications have been granted; the City has never been denied \nByrne JAG funds for which it applied. For instance, in FY 2016, West Palm Beach received \n$61,115 in its direct Byrne JAG award. That award was dated August 30, 2016. In FY 2015, the \nCity received $52,437 in its direct Byrne JAG award. Over the past ten years, excluding funds \nreceived as part of the 2009 Recovery Act, West Palm Beach’s annual Byrne JAG award has \naveraged $74,997 and has ranged between $118,338 (in 2007) to $61,116 (in 2016). \n59.   Over the last five years, the Department has routinely disbursed West Palm \nBeach’s JAG award in September and August of the particular grant year, and the money is \nimmediately obligated by the City’s criminal justice agencies to fund pressing needs. However, \nthe City has not yet been awarded funds for FY2017. \n60.  The City is also eligible for, and has previously been awarded, competitive sub-\ngrants from the annual Byrne JAG award to the State of Florida.  \n61.  West Palm Beach uses the federal funding provided by the Byrne JAG program to \nsupport a number of priorities within and improvements to its criminal justice system. In recent \nyears, a significant portion of West Palm Beach’s Byrne JAG funding has gone towards West Palm \nBeach  Police  Department  technology  and  equipment  enhancements,  training,  and  over-time \npayments to police officers. It is clear, then, that the funds that the City receives from the Byrne \nJAG program play a vital role in many facets of the City’s criminal justice programming.  \n  17 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 18 of 34\n62.  For FY 2017, West Palm Beach has applied for $59,970 in funding and intends to \nuse its JAG award for, among other things, providing maritime security required by Presidential \nvisits to the area. \nB.   Conditions for Byrne JAG Funding \n  \n63.  The statute creating the Byrne JAG program authorizes the Attorney General to \nimpose a limited set of conditions on applicants. First, the statute authorizes the Attorney General \nto require that applicants supply information about their intended use of the grant funding, and to \ndemonstrate that they will spend the money on purposes envisioned by the statute. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 3752(a)(2) & (5) (the Attorney General can insist upon assurances by applicants that “the \nprograms to be funded by the grant meet all the requirements of this part” and “that Federal funds \n. . . will not be used to supplant State or local funds”). Second, the statute allows the Attorney \nGeneral to require that applicants provide information about their budget protocols; for instance, \nhe can insist that a recipient of a Byrne JAG “maintain and report such data, records, and \ninformation (programmatic and financial) as [he] may reasonably require.” Id. § 3752(a)(4). Third, \nthe Attorney General can demand that localities “certif[y],” in conjunction with their applications \nfor funding, that they “will comply with all provisions of this part and all other applicable Federal \nlaws.” Id. § 3752(a)(5)(D). Finally, the statute authorizes the Attorney General to “issue Rules to carry \nout this part.” Id. § 3754.  \n64.  That is all. The above delegations of authority do not include a general grant of \nauthority to the Attorney General to impose new obligations the Attorney General himself creates and \nthat are neither traceable to existing “applicable Federal law[]” nor reflected in “provisions of this part” \n(i.e., the JAG statute itself). See id. § 3752(a)(5)(D). Congress’ decision not to delegate to the Attorney \nGeneral such a broad scope of authority was intentional and clear.  \n  18 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 19 of 34\n65.  Time and time again, Congress has demonstrated that it knows how to confer agency \ndiscretion to add substantive conditions to federal grants when it wants to. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § \n3796gg-1(e)(3) (authorizing the Attorney General to “impose reasonable conditions on grant awards” \nin a different program created by the Omnibus Control and Safe Streets Act); 42 U.S.C. § 14135(c)(1) \n(providing that the Attorney General shall “distribute grant amounts, and establish grant conditions . . \n.”); see also Andrus v. Glover Const. Co., 446 U.S. 608, 616-617 (1980) (“Where Congress explicitly \nenumerates certain exceptions,” its “omission” of a different exception means “only one inference can \nbe drawn: Congress meant to” exclude that provision).  \n66.  Furthermore, the Attorney General has never imposed conditions on Byrne JAG \napplicants beyond the bounds of his statutory authority, i.e., conditions that neither reflect “applicable \nFederal laws” nor that relate to the disbursement of the grants themselves.  Past conditions almost all \nrelated to the administration and expenditure of the grant itself.  The few conditions that apply to \nthe general conduct of the recipient or subrecipient are expressly made applicable to federal \ngrantees by statute.  \n67.  The Department of Justice’s new conditions do not apply to the expenditure of the \ngrant funding, and the Section 1373 condition refers to a federal law that is wholly inapplicable to \nthe JAG grant. The Department offered no statistics, studies, or legal authority to support its \nimposition of these 2017 conditions as promoting public safety and the law enforcement purposes \nof the JAG program. \n68.  Had Congress authorized the Attorney General to create new substantive conditions \nfor Byrne JAG funds at his choosing, that would have upended Congress’ formula approach for \ndistributing funds under the program based on population and violent crime. That in turn would \nhave resulted in the allocating of grants according to criteria invented by the Department of Justice. \nThat is not the program Congress created. See Amalgamated Transit Union v. Skinner, 894 F.2d \n  19 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 20 of 34\n1362, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (“Where Congress prescribes the form in which an agency may \nexercise its authority, . . . we cannot elevate the goals of an agency’s action, however reasonable, \nover that prescribed form.”). \n69.  Congress’s decision to use a formula grant mechanism, namely, “in accordance \nwith the formula established under section 10156 of this title,” impacts its use of the phrase “may \n… make grants to States and units of local government.” 34 U.S.C. § 10152(a)(1). Read together, \nthis language demonstrates that Congress imposed a non-discretionary duty to issue JAG awards. \nIt is, as in other statutory schemes, a mandate to issue JAG awards, not a delegation of discretion \nto the Attorney General. See, e.g., United Hosp. Ctr., Inc. v. Richardson, 757 F.2d 1445, 1453 (4th \nCir. 1985) (“While the term ‘may’ in a statute or agency regulation dealing with agency power is \ngenerally construed as permissive rather than mandatory, the construction of such term—whether \ndiscretionary or mandatory—is reached in every case ‘on the context of the statute [or regulation], \nand on whether it is fairly to be presumed that it was the intention of the legislature [or agency] to \nconfer a discretionary power or to impose an imperative duty.’” (brackets in original)); id. (“There \ncan be no question that the board intended the challenged provision in this regulation, even though \nstated in terms of ‘may,’ to be mandatory.”); Wilson v. United States, 135 F.2d 1005, 1009 (3d Cir. \n1943) (“[T]he word 'may’, ordinarily permissive in quality, is frequently given a mandatory \nmeaning where a public body or officer is clothed by statute with power to do an act which concerns \nthe public interest, or the rights of third persons. In such cases, what they are empowered to do for the \nsake of justice, or the public welfare, the law requires shall be done. The language, although permissive \nin form, is, in fact peremptory.” (ellipsis omitted) (citing Bd. of Supervisors of Rock Island Cty. v. U.S. \nex rel. State Bank, 71 U.S. 435 (1866)).  \n \n \n  20 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 21 of 34\nC.    Section 1373 Condition \n70.  On February 26, 2016, Congressman John Culberson, Chairman of the House \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, sent a letter \nto then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, inquiring whether recipients of Department of Justice \ngrants were complying with Section 1373.3 \n71.  The  Culberson  letter  spurred  the  Office  of  Justice  Programs  (“OJP”)  at  the \nDepartment of Justice to ask that the Department’s Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) investigate \nlocal jurisdictions’ compliance with Section 1373. In an email sent from OJP to Inspector General \nMichael Horowitz on April 8, 2016, OJP indicated that it had “received information” indicating \nthat several jurisdictions who receive OJP funding may be in violation of Section 1373 and \nattached a spreadsheet of over 140 state and local jurisdictions that it wanted OIG to investigate.4 \n72.  On May 31, 2016, Inspector General Horowitz transmitted a report to Department of \nJustice  Assistant  Attorney  General  Karol  Mason,  reviewing  the  policies  of  ten  state  and  local \njurisdictions,  and  whether  they  comply  with  Section  1373.  The  jurisdictions  analyzed  were: \nConnecticut, California, City of Chicago (Illinois), Clark County (Nevada), Cook County (Illinois), \nMiami-Dade (Florida), Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), Orleans Parish (Louisiana), Philadelphia \n(Pennsylvania) and New York City. The report expressed “concerns” with several of the localities’ \nlaws and policies. The report did not analyze the effects of any of the ten local jurisdictions’ policies \non crime rates or public safety.  And most notably, the report expressed no concerns about West Palm \nBeach.  \n                                                 \n3 See Letter from Cong. Culberson to Attorney General Lynch (Feb. 26, 2016), available at https://goo.gl/Cytb3B. \nCongressman Culberson’s letter was accompanied by analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies, a non-profit \ninstitute that describes itself as “animated by a ‘low-immigration, pro-immigrant’ vision of America that admits \nfewer immigrants but affords a warmer welcome for those who are admitted.” About the Center for Immigration \nStudies, Center for Immigration Studies (last visited January 30, 2018), https://goo.gl/GrsfoQ. \n4 See Ex. 7.  (Memorandum from Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz to Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Karol Mason (May 31, 2016) (describing OJP’s earlier email to OIG)). \n  21 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 22 of 34\n73.  On July 7, 2016, Assistant Attorney General Mason, who then oversaw the Office of \nJustice Programs, sent a Memorandum to Inspector General Horowitz conveying that, in response to \nOIG’s report, “the Office of Justice Programs has determined that Section 1373 is an applicable federal \nlaw for the purposes of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistant Grant (JAG) program and the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP).”  There was no analysis supporting this conclusion \nwhatsoever, nor any explanation for why OJP had not reached that conclusion during the prior ten \nyears that it administered the JAG program.  \n74.  Also on July 7, 2016, the Office of Justice Programs released a Question and Answer \n“Guidance” document, entitled “Office of Justice Programs Guidance Regarding Compliance with 8 \nU.S.C. § 1373.”  See Ex. 11.  The Q&A Guidance document stated that under the Department’s new \npolicy, “[a] JAG grantee is required to assure and certify compliance with all applicable federal \nstatutes, including Section 1373.” The document explained that Section 1373 “prevents federal, state, \nand local government entities and officials from ‘prohibit[ing] or in any way restrict[ing]’ government \nofficials or entities from sending to, or receiving from, federal immigration officers information \nconcerning an individual’s citizenship or immigration status.” But it further stated that “Section 1373 \ndoes not impose on states and localities the affirmative obligation to collect information from private \nindividuals regarding their immigration status, nor does it require that statutes and localities take \nspecific actions upon obtaining such information.”  \n75.  On  October  6,  2016,  OJP  released  a  document  entitled  “Additional  Guidance \nRegarding Compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373.”  See Ex. 12.  That document addressed the question, \n“Does OJP’s guidance on 8 U.S.C. § 1373 impact FY 2016 funding?” And it answered: “No FY 2016 \nor prior year Byrne/JAG or SCAAP funding will be impacted. However, OJP expects that JAG and \nSCAAP recipients will use this time to examine their policies and procedures to ensure they will be \nable to submit the required assurances when applying for JAG and SCAAP funding in FY 2017.”  \n  22 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 23 of 34\n76.  As Defendants have conceded in other cases, Section 1373 imposes no affirmative \nobligation on state or local entities to collect immigration status information or take any specific actions \nupon receiving immigration status information.  \n77.  Within a week of taking office, on January 25, 2017, President Trump issued Executive \nOrder 13768, a sweeping order aimed at punishing “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Entitled “Enhancing \nPublic Safety in the Interior of the United States,” the order announced that it is the policy of the \nExecutive Branch to withhold “Federal funds” from “jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable \nFederal law” by acting as “sanctuary jurisdictions.” Exec. Order 13768 §§ 1, 2(c). The Order directed \nthe Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to “ensure that jurisdictions that \nwillfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions) are not eligible to receive \nFederal grants,” and authorized the Secretary of DHS to “designate, in his discretion and to the \nextent consistent with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction.” Id. § 8(a). The Order was \nultimately enjoined in large part by the United States District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia because the court found that it violated multiple constitutional provisions. County of \nSanta Clara v. Trump, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2017 WL 1459081 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 25, 2017). \n78.  As the Santa Clara case unfolded, the Defendants sharpened their focus—both \nwithin the context of that lawsuit and more broadly—on denying local jurisdictions grants \ndisbursed by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security in particular, as the mechanism \nfor carrying out the Administration’s efforts to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities. At the \npreliminary injunction hearing in March in the Santa Clara case, the lawyer for the government \nrepresented that the Executive Order only applied to three federal grants administered by the \nDepartments of Justice and Homeland Security. Id. at *1. \n \n  23 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 24 of 34\nD.   Defendants’ November 15, 2017 Letter to the City of West Palm Beach and \nAccompanying Press Release \n \n79.  On  November  15,  2017,  Defendants  issued  a  press  release  entitled  “Justice \nDepartment Sends Letters to 29 Jurisdictions Regarding Their Compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373.” \nSee Ex. 2.  The press release announced that “[t]he Department of Justice today sent the attached \nletters to 29 jurisdictions that may have laws, policies, or practices that violate 8 U.S.C. 1373, a \nfederal statute that promotes information sharing related to immigration enforcement.” \n80.  The press release explained that “Jurisdictions that were found to have possible \nviolations of 8 U.S.C. 1373 will have until December 8, 2017 to demonstrate that the interpretation \nand application of their laws, policies, or practices comply with the statute.” \n81.  The press release also included a statement from the Attorney General indicating \nthat he “urge[d] all jurisdictions found to be potentially out of compliance in this preliminary \nreview  to  reconsider  their  policies  that  undermine  the  safety  of  their  residents.  We  urge \njurisdictions to not only comply with Section 1373, but also to establish sensible and effective \npartnerships to properly process criminal aliens.” \nE. The City’s November 29, 2017 Response to Defendants’ November 15, 2017 Letter \n82.  Even though City officials were alarmed by Defendants’ press release and letter at \nthe time, given the plain and unmistakable language of Resolution 112-17, the City nonetheless \nreplied in good faith to Defendants’ inquiry on November 29, 2017.  See Ex. 4.   \n83.  The City’s response explained that Resolution 112-17 clearly and unequivocally \nrequires that all employees and officers follow the law and does not in any way prohibit or \notherwise restrict West Palm Beach officers or employees from send to or receiving information \nfrom the Immigration and Naturalization Service or any other Federal Agency when sending and \n  24 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 25 of 34\nreceiving such information is required by Federal Law; the City of West Palm Beach Code of \nOrdinances; or other binding court decisions, opinions or processes.       \n84.  The City did not take legal action against Defendants in November 2017 out of a \nspirit of good faith and because, inter alia, Defendants’ November 2017 letter specifically stated \nthat  “[t]he  Department  has  not  made  a  final  determination  regarding  West  Palm  Beach's \ncompliance with section 1373. This letter does not constitute final agency action and nothing in \nthis letter creates any right or benefit enforceable at law against the United States.” See Ex. 3. \nF.  Defendants’ January 24, 2017 Letter to the City of West Palm Beach and \nAccompanying Press Release \n \n85.  Despite, the City’s good faith response to Defendants’ inquiry, on January 24, 2018, \nthe City received another letter from Defendants stating that “[a]fter reviewing your response, the \nDepartment remains concerned that your jurisdiction’s laws, policies, or practices may violate \nsection 1373, or, at a minimum, that they may be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent \nwith section 1373.” See Ex. 5.   The new letter demands that the City provide the following \ndocuments to the Defendants by no later than February 23, 2018:  \nAll documents reflecting any orders, directives, instructions, or guidance to your \nlaw  enforcement  employees  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  police  officers, \ncorrectional officers, and contract employees), whether formal or informal, that \nwere  distributed,  produced,  and/or  in  effect  during  the  relevant  timeframe, \nregarding whether and how these employees may, or may not, communicate with \nthe  Department  of  Justice,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  and/or \nImmigration  and  Customs  Enforcement,  or  their  agents,  whether  directly  or \nindirectly. \n \nThe letter stated that if the City should “fail to respond in a complete and timely manner, the \nDepartment will subpoena these documents in accordance with 34 U.S.C. §§ 10225, 10221, 10230, \n10151 – 10158, 10102(a)(6), 10110, and 10110 note.”  And, the letter threatened that “[s]hould \nthe Department determine your jurisdiction is out of compliance with section 1373, the Department \n  25 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 26 of 34\nmay, as detailed in your award documents, seek return of your FY 2016 grant funds, require \nadditional conditions for receipt of any FY 2017 Byrne JAG funding for which you have applied, \nand/or deem you ineligible for FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds.” \n86.  Unlike the November 2017 letter, the January 2018 letter did not contain the \ndisclaimer that the “Department has not made a final determination,” and did not state that the \nletter did not constitute final agency action.  \n87.  At the same time Defendants sent their January 2018 letter, they also issued a press \nrelease indicating that: a) the number of jurisdictions of concern had fallen from 29 to 23, b) the \nremaining jurisdictions on the list “will be subject to a Department of Justice subpoena,” if they \nfail  to  respond  to  the  letter  to  Defendants’  satisfaction;  and  c)  that  the  Attorney  General \n“continue[d] to urge all jurisdictions under review to reconsider policies that place the safety of \ntheir communities and their residents at risk.”   See Ex. 6.  The Attorney General also stated that \n“Protecting  criminal  aliens  from  federal  immigration  authorities  defies  common  sense  and \nundermines the rule of law. We have seen too many examples of the threat to public safety \nrepresented  by  jurisdictions  that  actively  thwart  the  federal  government’s  immigration \nenforcement—enough is enough.” \n88.  The City is being targeted by Defendants for no justifiable or understandable \npurpose because it is undeniably clear that there is absolutely no way the City is violating Section \n1373.   This targeting is unjustifiably placing the City at a risk of losing critical federal and state \nfunding it does not deserve to lose.  \n89.  Because of the injuries West Palm Beach will suffer in all of the above circumstances, \nthe City faces a significant danger of harm due to the Defendants’ continual imposition of uncertain \nconditions for receiving the FY 2017 Byrne JAG grant, keeping its FY 2016 Byrne JAG funds, and \npotentially receiving COPS grant funding in the future.  \n  26 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 27 of 34\nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nCOUNT I \n(Declaratory Judgment Act: The City of West Palm Beach Complies with 8 U.S.C. § 1373) \n \n90.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs 1-\n89. \n91.  The City of West Palm Beach certified its compliance with Section 1373 to the \nDepartment of Justice both in its FY 2016 and FY 2017 application for Byrne JAG funding and \nalso in its November 29, 2017 letter to Defendants signed by the City Attorney and describing the \nbasis for the City’s compliance. See Exs. 13 and 14.  \n92.  The City of West Palm Beach complies with Section 1373 to the extent it can be \nconstitutionally enforced vis-a-vis the City. \n93.  The City’s policies, namely Resolution 112-17, direct City officials and employees \nnot to collect immigration status information unless such collection is required by state or federal \nlaw.  Because West Palm Beach cannot restrict the sharing of information it does not collect, the \nCity’s policy of non-collection renders it necessarily compliant with Section 1373 for all cases \ncovered by the non-collection policy. \n94.  Moreover, Resolution 112-17, clearly permits disclosure of information regarding \nthe citizenship or immigration status of any person when required pursuant to federal law.  And, it \nclearly provides lawful authorization for any Agent or Agency to request information about or \notherwise investigate or assist in the investigation of the Citizenship or immigration status of any \nperson when required by federal law.   \n95.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that it complies \nwith Section 1373 as properly construed. \n \n  27 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 28 of 34\nCOUNT II \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act through Ultra Vires Conduct Not \nAuthorized by Congress in the Underlying Statute) \n \n96.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs 1-\n89. \n97.  The Department of Justice may only exercise authority conferred by statute. See \nCity of Arlington v. FCC, 133 S. Ct. 1863, 1869 (2013). \n98.  The Byrne JAG statute provides no authority to the Attorney General to impose \nconditions on the receipt of Byrne JAG funds that are neither reflected in “applicable Federal laws” \nnor concern the administration of the JAG program itself.  \n99.  The conditions added to the FY 2017 grant by the Department of Justice are neither \n“applicable Federal laws” nor conditions that deal with the administration and spending of the \nByrne JAG funds.  \n100.  The Attorney General’s imposition of the new conditions is unauthorized by statute. \n101.  The Attorney General’s imposition of the new conditions also contradicts the \nformula-grant structure of the Byrne JAG program. See 42 U.S.C. § 3755(d)(2)(A).  \n102.  The APA requires courts to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”; “contrary \nto constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity”; or “in excess of statutory jurisdictions, \nauthority, or limitations[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C). The Act further demands courts to “compel \nagency action [that is] unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” Id. § 706(1).  \n103.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration \nthat the Attorney General is without the statutory authority to impose the Section 1373 certification \nand proof of compliance conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds, and in doing so, has acted \n  28 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 29 of 34\ncontrary to law under the APA. Plaintiff is also entitled to a permanent injunction preventing the \nAttorney General from putting those conditions into effect. \nCOUNT III \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act through Violation of the Constitution’s \nSeparation-of-Powers) \n \n104.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs 1-\n89. \n105.  The Constitution vests Congress, not the President or officials in the Executive \nBranch, with the power to appropriate funding to “provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United \nStates.” U.S. Const. art I, § 8, cl. 1. \n106.  The President’s constitutional duty—and that of his appointees in the Executive \nBranch—is to “take Care that the Law be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, cl. 5. \n107.  The President “does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend . . . funds” that \nhave already been appropriate by Congress “for a particular project or program.” In re Aiken Cnty., \n725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013); see also Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 44 (1975). \n108.  The President also cannot amend or cancel appropriations that Congress has duly \nenacted because doing such violates the Presentment Clause of the Constitution and results in the \nPresident purporting to wield a constitutional power not vested within his office. See Clinton v. \nCity of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998).  \n109.  Imposing a new condition on a federal grant program amounts to refusing to spend \nmoney appropriated by Congress unless that condition is satisfied.  \n110.  The Section 1373 condition was not imposed by Congress, but rather by the \nDepartment of Justice in issuing its Office of Justice Program Guidance for FY 2016 Byrne JAG \n  29 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 30 of 34\nawards and its FY 2017 Byrne JAG application. Therefore, the Section 1373 condition amounts to \nan improper usurpation of Congress’s spending power by the Executive Branch.  \n111.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the Attorney \nGeneral’s imposition of the Section 1373 compliance and verification conditions violates the \nconstitutional principle of separation of powers and impermissibly arrogates to the Executive \nBranch power that which is reserved for the Legislative Branch. Plaintiff is also entitled to a \npermanent injunction preventing the Attorney General from putting those conditions into effect. \nCOUNT IV \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act through Arbitrary and Capricious Agency \nAction) \n \n112.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs 1-\n89. \n113.  The Department of Justice’s decision to impose the Section 1373 compliance and \nverification conditions on the receipt of FY 2016 and FY 2017 Byrne JAG and COPS funds \ndeviates from past agency practice without reasoned explanation or justification. \n114.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the Attorney \nGeneral’s imposition of the Section 1373 compliance and verification conditions is arbitrary and \ncapricious. Plaintiff is also entitled to a permanent injunction preventing the Attorney General \nfrom putting those conditions into effect. \nCOUNT V \n(Spending Clause) \n115.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs 1-\n89. \n  30 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 31 of 34\n116.  Congress could not have authorized the immigration-related conditions attached the \nByrne JAG award here because they do not satisfy the requirements of the Spending Clause of the \nConstitution. \n117.  None  of  the  three  conditions—attestation  of  compliance  with  Section  1373, \nverification of compliance with Section 1373, and providing affirmative statements of willingness \nto enforce immigration law—is “reasonably related” or “germane[]” to the federal interest that \nunderlies the Byrne JAG or the COPS grant program. See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, \n207-08 & n.3 (1987) (conditions must be “reasonably related,” or “germane[],” to the particular \nprogram); see also New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167 (1992) (the attached “conditions \nmust . . . bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal spending”). The three conditions all \ndeal with federal civil immigration enforcement, not localities’ enforcement of state or local \ncriminal law.  \n118.  The three conditions threaten the federal interest that underlies the Byrne JAG and \nCOPS  program.  They  undermine  Congress’s  goals  of  dispersing  funds  across  the  country, \ntargeting funds to combat violent crime, respecting local judgment in setting law enforcement \nstrategy, and increasing local law enforcement hiring to implement community policing strategies  \nwhich enhance law enforcement’s capacity to prevent, solve, and control crime. \n119.  The Department’s imposition of the conditions also violates the requirement that \nSpending Clause legislation “impose unambiguous conditions on states, so they can exercise \nchoices knowingly and with awareness of the consequences.” Koslow v. Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, 302 F.3d 161, 175 (3d Cir. 2002).  \n  31 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 32 of 34\n120.  Moreover, because the conditions are ambiguous, they arguably require cities to \ninfringe on individuals’ Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, violating the prohibition on Spending \nClause conditions that “induce unconstitutional action.” Koslow, 302 F.3d at 175.  \n121.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that the imposition \nof the three immigration-related conditions for the FY 2016 and FY 2017 Byrne JAG and the \nCOPS  grant  program  violates  the  Constitution’s  Spending  Clause  as  well  as  an  injunction \npreventing those conditions from going into effect.  \nCOUNT VI \n(Tenth Amendment: Commandeering) \n122.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs 1-\n89. \n123.  The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from “requir[ing]” states \nand localities “to govern according to Congress’s instructions,” New York, 505 U.S. at 162, and \nfrom “command[ing] the States’ officers . . . to administer or enforce a federal regulatory \nprogram,” Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997). \n124.  Where the “whole object” of a provision of a federal statute is to “direct the \nfunctioning” of state and local governments, that provision is unconstitutional, Printz, 521 U.S. at \n932, and must be enjoined, id. at 935; New York, 505 U.S. at 186-187. That description precisely \nfits each of the three immigration-related conditions.  \n125.  If Section 1373 is interpreted to extend to information sharing about witnesses, \nvictims, and law-abiding persons in the City, and to require that West Palm Beach provide federal \nauthorities unfettered access to immigration status information about such persons, that would \nhamper the City’s ability to ensure law and order. As a result, West Palm Beach’s personnel would \n  32 \n  \n\nCase 9:18-cv-80131-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2018   Page 33 of 34\nbe “commandeered” to perform federal functions rather than to pursue local priorities, in violation \nof the Tenth Amendment. \n126.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that if Section \n1373 is construed by the Department to conflict with West Palm Beach’s local policies, that would \nresult in a violation of the Tenth Amendment. Plaintiff is entitled to a permanent injunction \npreventing the Department from taking such an interpretation. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays this Court: \na.   Declare that the City of West Palm Beach complies with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 as properly \nconstrued; \nb.   Declare that all immigration-related conditions for the FY 2016 and 2017 Byrne JAG and \nCOPS grants are unlawful; \nc.  Permanently enjoin the Defendants from enforcing Section 1373 conditions for the FY \n2016 and 2017 Byrne JAG award and future JAG and COPS grants awards and retain \njurisdiction to monitor the Department’s compliance with this Court’s judgment;  \nd.   Grant such other relief as this Court may deem proper; and \ne.   Award the City of West Palm Beach reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees. \nRespectfully submitted,          Dated: February 6, 2018 \n/s/ Kimberly L.
