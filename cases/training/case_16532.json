    "summary": "<p>This case is part of the Clearinghouse Special Collection on the events and litigation leading up to and surrounding the famous Selma-to-Montgomery marches of 1965.  </p><p>On March 25, 1965, the famous Selma-to-Montgomery march concluded, bringing thousands of protesters to Montgomery seeking an end to racially discriminatory voting practices in Alabama. Viola Liuzzo wanted to support the protesters, and so she drove from her home in Michigan to Montgomery so that she could drive protesters back to Selma. During one of her trips between Selma and Montgomery, four Klansmen spotted her - a white woman - and another volunteer - a black man - sitting in the front. The Klansmen drove up to Liuzzo's car and shot her in the head. For more information on the murder and conspiracy trials that followed, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15097\">United States v. Wilkins</a>. </p><p>The investigation into her murder revealed that one of the Klansmen, Gary Rowe, was in fact an FBI informant. During the previous trials, Rowe testified that he began his informant duties in 1960 or 1961, which required him to infiltrate the KKK. In 1975, the Senate Salect Committee to Study Governmental Operations commenced an investigation into the role of the FBI and Rowe during the civil rights movement. In the course of the investigation, Rowe testified that the FBI wanted Rowe to get closer to the violent events taking place, even if it meant he had to participate in them. He also testified that despite reporting on dozens of planned violent incidents to the FBI, the FBI prevented only two of them. As to the Liuzzo murder, Rowe testified that one of the other Klansmen involved called him that morning and told him that his \"big day with the Klan had finally come,\" though the Klansmen disclosed no further details of what was planned at that point. The Committee's final report was issued in 1976.</p><p>Liuzzo's children then filed an administrative claim with the FBI on October 12, 1977. Before a final disposition was reached in the administrative proceedings, they brought this action against the FBI on July 5, 1979. They were represented by the ACLU. The plaintiffs alleged that the FBI was responsible for Liuzzo's murder and that they subsequently mishandled her body. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that the FBI exercised direct, continuous, and complete control over Rowe during his time as an informant. The plaintiffs argued that the FBI knew or should have known that Rowe was not responsible enough as required by FBI policy and the FBI did not sufficiently train and supervise Rowe. The plaintiffs thus accused the FBI of negligence in authorizing Rowe to participate in the KKK's violence, including the activities leading to Liuzzo's murder. Further, they argued that Rowe's failure to prevent the murder was negligent and in violation of FBI policy as well as federal and state law. Finally, the plaintiffs argued that the FBI was negligent in handling Liuzzo's body after the murder, leading to emotional distress for her family. The plaintiffs brought this case under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), and they sought damages. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.</p><p>The FBI moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the complaint was barred by a two year statute of limitations. The FBI claimed the cause of action began to accrue in 1965 after Liuzzo's murder, while the plaintiffs argued that their cause began to accrue in December 1975 after the Committee hearings when they discovered the causal link between FBI conduct and the murder. The plaintiffs also argued that they could not have discovered his causal link earlier because the FBI was actively concealing relevant information. The court denied the motion on February 29, 1980 (485 F. Supp. 1274), holding that the cause of action did not accrue until the injury was discovered. While the plaintiffs thought they knew the cause of Liuzzo's death almost immediately after the events, the court held that they had no reason to suspect FBI complicity with the Klansmen until Rowe's 1975 testimony. The court found that during the Klansmen trials, the FBI did not attempt to correct the conception of Rowe as a helpless bystander to the murder, and that it was not until 1975 that he revealed the FBI condoned his participation in the violence.</p><p>The FBI subsequently moved to dismiss again. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs moved to compel discovery of a relevant FBI report. The court denied both motions on Feb. 25, 1981 (508 F. Supp. 923). The court held that because the plaintiffs' claims alleged the FBI was directly rather than vicarious liable, the FTCA did not bar them. Further, the court held that the FTCA's liability exception for claims arising out of assault and battery did not apply because the plaintiffs' claims arose out of FBI conduct other than the murder itself. The court also held that the plaintiffs' claims attacked the implementation rather than the formation of FBI policy, and as such they were not clearly barred under the FTCA's exception for government discretion. Separately, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel, finding that the report was privileged and its disclosure would jeopardize its current and future investigation processes. </p><p>Litigation continued, and on May 27, 1983, the court issued its final judgment (565 F. Supp. 640). The court held that the FBI was not liable because it was not negligent in directing Rowe to participate in the activities of March 25, 1965 leading to the murder. The court found that Rowe neither participated in or encouraged the shooting, and that the crime was able to solved so quickly because of Rowe's presence. It further found that the FBI's standard of care for authorizing informant activities was a matter of the FBI's discretion and so could not be the basis of liability. Rather, the court found the issue to be whether the particular FBI agent directing Rowe that day was acting as an ordinary and reasonably prudent agent would. The court held that the evidence suggested the directing agent did act reasonably given how critical information was to the FBI in assisting the civil rights movement, and that had he not allowed Rowe to accompany the Klansmen that day, the agent would have undermined the FBI's mission and the civil rights movement. The court also held that Rowe's failure stop the shooting did not generate liability because there was no evidence that the FBI or its agents were part of a conspiracy to shoot Liuzzo. Indeed, the court found that Rowe suggested other violence on Liuzzo instead of shooting her, and that this evidence suggested he was trying to pick the lesser of two wrongs in a tense situation.</p><p>The case is now closed.

A. No. 79-72564.\n|\nFeb. 29, 1980.\nSynopsis\nChildren of civil rights worker filed action under the Federal Tort Claims Act against the United States and its agency, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, alleging that Government was responsible for murder of their mother and that certain \ngovernment agents mishandled and abused their motherโs body after her death. On United Statesโ motion to dismiss on \nground that complaint was barred by two-year statute of limitations applicable to tort claims against the Government, the \nDistrict Court, Joiner, J., held that where civil rights workerโs children had no reason to suspect that investigation was even \nwarranted, based on what was known in 1965, at time that worker was killed, their claims accrued no earlier than December \n2, 1975, the date on which they obtained knowledge that FBI agents were possibly implicated in incident and action was not \nbarred by limitations.\n \nMotion denied.\n \nAttorneys and Law Firms\n*1275 Dean A.

Dept. of Justice, Torts Branch, Civil Division, Washington, \nD. C., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nJOINER, District Judge.\nThe case arises out of the tragic and brutal slaying of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo in March of 1965. Plaintiffs, the \nchildren of Mrs. Liuzzo, have filed this action under the Federal Tort Claims Act1 against the United States and its agency, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, alleging that the government was responsible for the murder of their mother, and that certain \ngovernment agents mishandled and abused their motherโs body after her death.2\n \nThis case is before the court on defendantโs motion to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiffsโ complaint, barred by the 2 year \nstatute of limitations applicable to tort claims against the government, 28 U.S.C. s 2401(b), fails to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted.3 As more fully discussed below, the issue presented by this motion is whether plaintiffsโ suit is barred \nby reason of the lapse of twelve years between the date of Mrs. Liuzzoโs death and the date on which plaintiffs filed their \nadministrative claim against the government. Specifically, the governmentโs motion requires a determination of when, under s \n2401(b), plaintiffsโ cause of action accrued: in 1965, as the government argues, when Mrs. Liuzzo was killed, or in 1975, as \nplaintiffs argue, when information was disclosed which suggested a causative link between the conduct of FBI personnel and \nMrs. Liuzzoโs death.\n\n \nIn all cases in which a statute of limitations defense is interposed by a defendant, a thorough understanding of the facts is \nessential. Accordingly, an examination of the facts of this case follows. The sources of this factual history are the plaintiffsโ \ncomplaint and affidavits and the numerous exhibits submitted by the parties for the courtโs perusal. These exhibits include \nnewspaper and magazine articles, transcripts from earlier trials, transcripts of testimony given before the Senate Select \nCommittee to Study Governmental Operations, and the Committeeโs Final Report issued in April of 1976.\n \nHISTORY OF THE CASE\nOn March 25, 1965, Viola Liuzzo was in Alabama participating in civil rights activities, specifically, the Selma-Montgomery \nvoting rights march. Following the march, Mrs. Liuzzo was driving between the cities of Selma and Montgomery with a \nblack companion, Leroy Moten. During this trip, her car was overtaken by a car occupied by four members of the Ku Klux \nKlan. As the Klan car pulled alongside the Liuzzo car, the Klansmen opened their windows and fired on Mrs. Liuzzo and her \ncompanion. *1276 The shots killed Mrs. Liuzzo, but her passenger escaped injury.\n \nOn March 26, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson appeared on television, flanked by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and \nAttorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, and announced the arrests of four Klansmen in connection with the Liuzzo murder. \nPresident Johnson stated:\nDue to the very fast and the always efficient work of the special agents of the FBI who worked all \nnight long immediately after the tragic death of Mrs. Viola Liuzzo on a lonely road between Selma and \nMontgomery, Alabama, arrests were made a few minutes ago of four Ku Klux Klan members . . . \ncharging them with conspiring to violate the civil rights of the murdered woman.\nAfter naming the arrested Klansmen, the President continued:\nI cannot express myself too strongly in praising Mr. Hoover and the men of the FBI for their prompt and expeditious and \nvery excellent performance in handling this investigation.\nIt is in keeping with the dedicated approach that this organization has shown throughout the turbulent era of civil rights \ncontroversies.\nNew York Times, March 27, 1965.\n \nOne of the arrested Klansmen, Gary Rowe, later surfaced as an undercover FBI informant. Rumors that one of the Klansmen \nwas an informant began to circulate when a federal grand jury indicted only three of the Klansmen, and were confirmed when \nthe informant testified, under heavy guard, before the Alabama grand jury. On Roweโs testimony, the state grand jury returned \nmurder indictments against the three other men who were in the car.\n \nThree criminal trials resulted from the Liuzzo murder: two murder trials in the state courts and one federal conspiracy trial. \nOnly one of the three indicted Klansmen was tried on the murder charge, Collie LeRoy Wilkins. His first trial resulted in a \nhung jury, and the second in an acquittal. All three Klansmen were successfully prosecuted on the federal charge of \nconspiring to violate Mrs. Liuzzoโs civil rights, and, on verdicts of guilty, each received the maximum sentence.\n \nGary Rowe testified at all three trials, and related both the background of his involvement with the Ku Klux Klan and the \nFBI, and his version of the events which took place on March 25. Rowe testified that he was approached by an FBI agent in \n1960 or 1961 and was asked to infiltrate the Klan. His duties, he stated, were to โkeep up withโ any violent actions, and to \nreport to the FBI on the men whom he met in his undercover work.\n \nIn March of 1965, Rowe lived in Birmingham, Alabama. His testimony concerning Mrs. Liuzzoโs murder was as follows. \nRowe said he left Birmingham for the Selma-Montgomery area on the morning of the 25th, and called his FBI contact agent \nto inform him of the trip. While in Selma, Rowe and three Klan companions spotted Mrs. Liuzzo and a black man in a car. \nHis companions expressed a desire to โtake them.โ The Klansmen pursued the Liuzzo car down Highway 80 between Selma \nand Montgomery, and tried several times to overtake the car. Rowe testified that he tried to convince the Klansmen several \ntimes to turn back, but that they insisted on continuing. Finally, on the fourth attempt, at speeds approaching 100 miles per \nhour, the Klan car overtook the Liuzzo car. Rowe stated that as they overtook the Liuzzo car, one of the Klansmen passed his \ngun to Wilkins, and Wilkins opened his window and fired two shots, just as Mrs. Liuzzo turned to her left and look at them. \n\nAccording to Rowe, Eugene Thomas, the owner of the gun, directed the men to โshoot the hell out of them.โ Rowe testified \nthat he drew his pistol and pretended to fire, but didnโt. Rowe further testified that he did not know when he left Birmingham \nthat the trip would end in a slaying, and that he was powerless to prevent the murder because he didnโt know that shots would \nbe fired until they were fired. Rowe stated that he phoned the FBI contact agents upon his return to Birmingham and later \nturned over his pistol to the agents.\n \n*1277 Roweโs testimony was not, of course, unchallenged in the three trials. At the first state trial, Wilkins was represented \nby Matt Murphy, Imperial Klonsel of the Klan. Murphy questioned Rowe on an alleged bribe he received from the FBI to \ntestify, and Rowe stated that he was not bribed, and that Murphy himself had manufactured the story. Murphy also questioned \nRowe regarding threats Rowe allegedly made to โkill niggers,โ and about a trip to Tuscaloosa when he allegedly had a burp \ngun in his car. Murphy asked whether Rowe himself had insisted on โkilling some niggersโ on the night of the murder. Rowe \nrepeatedly denied Murphyโs allegations. Murphyโs cross-examination of Rowe did establish, however, that Rowe was a paid \ninformant, and that Rowe was paid for his expenses and the information that he provided the FBI.\n \nThe cross-examinations in the second state trial and in the federal conspiracy trial included further attempts to impeach \nRowe. In these trials, Arthur Hanes, a former FBI agent, served as defense counsel, and attempted to portray Rowe as a paid \nFBI troublemaker. The focus of Hanesโ line of questioning was the 1961 Klan attack on the Freedom Riders at the \nBirmingham bus depot. Hanesโ questions to Rowe elicited the information that Rowe was present at the scene, and was, at the \ntime, working for the FBI. Hanes asked whether Rowe helped โjump on these riders,โ and Rowe denied the allegation. He did \nstate, however, that he was involved in an affray:\nQ: You worked for the FBI, and you were involved in that affray. Were you ordered by the FBI to engage in that affray \nand provoke a little trouble?\nA: No, sir. I did that on my self reservation.\nQ: You did that on your โself reservationโ?\nA: Self preservation.\nState murder trial transcript at 509.\nQ: You participated in the attack on the first Freedom Riders on Mothers Day in Birmingham, Alabama, at the bus \nstation, didnโt you?\nA: No, sir.\nQ: Were you there?\nA: Yes, sir.\nQ: But you didnโt participate in the attacks on these people?\nA: No, sir.\nFederal conspiracy trial transcript at 287-88.\n \nAt both trials, Hanes showed Rowe a picture from the Saturday Evening Post, March 2, 1963, depicting the attack on the \nFreedom Riders, and asked whether one of the individuals shown beating the riders was Rowe. Rowe denied that it was his \npicture.\nMr. Hanes: I would like for the record to show that I pointed to a rather hefty man with his back to \nthe camera, and I asked the witness if that was he, and he said no.\nFederal trial transcript at 289.\n \nThe federal conspiracy trial ended, as noted above, with convictions of all three Klansmen. If the exhibits submitted by \nplaintiffs and the government are any indication, this last trial marked the end of media interest in the case. As mentioned \nearlier, the two Klansmen in the car other than Wilkins were never tried on state criminal charges. The Liuzzo case surfaced \n\nagain ten years later, in 1975, when the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations commenced an \ninvestigation. Prior to setting forth information obtained through this investigation, however, it is useful to summarize the \nfacts believed to be accurate in 1965, the date on which the government states the statute of limitations began running.\n \nIt was clearly established in 1965 that Rowe was a paid, undercover FBI informant who was in the car with the three \nKlansmen accused of killing Viola Liuzzo. On Roweโs testimony, it was believed that Collie LeRoy Wilkins fired the murder \n*1278 weapon, and Roweโs testimony provided the basis for three criminal prosecutions. Rowe and the FBI were credited \nwith breaking the case both by the media and by President Johnson. Although Rowe was cross-examined during the three \ncriminal trials regarding his activities with the Klan, Rowe consistently denied any wrongdoing. He acknowledged that he \nhad been involved in an affray for his self preservation.\n \nIn 1975, the Senate Select Committee on Governmental Operations commenced its investigation, and directed its focus, in \npart, to the activities of the FBI and Gary Rowe in the civil rights movement. Rowe was deposed4 by the Committee in \nOctober of 1975, and testified before the Committee on December 2, 1975. The Committee issued its Final Report in April, \n1976. The Senate investigation revealed more information regarding the activities of the FBI and Rowe in the civil rights \nmovement of the early 1960s.\n \nWhen he appeared before the Senate Committee, Rowe testified that his initial instructions from the FBI regarding his \nparticipation in violent activities were explicitly against such participation. Rowe stated, however, that his contact agent was \ndissatisfied because Rowe was not reporting on the violence that the Bureau knew was occurring. Rowe was then instructed \nto get closer to the action groups within the Klan. Regarding his participation in violence against civil rights workers, Rowe \nstated that he informed his agent in advance of the violence. When asked what his instructions were, Rowe replied that the \nagent told him:\nWe have to by law instruct you that you are not to participate in any violence. However, I know you \nhave to do this. We know itโs something that you have to do and we understand it, and we need the \ninformation. Thatโs the important thing: get the information.\nSenate Committee Hearings, Vol. 6, p. 117.\n \nRowe related that he had participated in the 1961 attack on the Freedom Riders, and that the FBI knew of the planned \nviolence three weeks in advance. In contrast to his 1965 testimony, Rowe stated to the Committee that he had made a trip to \nTuscaloosa, and that he had been arrested with various types of weapons in his car. Rowe further stated that although he had \nreported on โhigh dozensโ of incidents of planned violence, to his knowledge, the FBI prevented only two of the incidents.\n \nThe Liuzzo murder was mentioned twice during Roweโs testimony, when he was asked whether he surfaced in connection \nwith the murder, and when he was asked whether he helped solve the murder. Roweโs testimony before the Committee \ndisclosed no facts about the Liuzzo case not known in 1965.\n \nRoweโs deposition testimony, however, filled in other aspects of his duties as an undercover FBI informer. That part of \ndeposition which involves the Liuzzo case provides information that adds to his 1965 story. Rowe stated that on the morning \nof March 25, he received a phone call from a Klansman, Robert Thomas, and was told to go to the march. Rowe stated he \nwas told that โmy big day with the Klan had finally come . . . . I had finally been elected to do the greatest deed of my life for \nthe Klan. I asked him what it was and he told me he wouldnโt know until the time came.โ Roweโs call to his contact agent on \nthe morning of March 25 related this instruction. Rowe stated that his agent told him to go, but added, โbut be careful \nbecause this sounds really big.โ Deposition, October 17, 1975 at 32-33. Rowe maintained, however, that he did not know that \nMrs. Liuzzo and her companion were murder targets.\nI honestly felt, in my heart, that we was going to go out there and felt we was going to beat the hell out \nof him (the black companion), because thatโs what we had been doing. I honestly felt that, in my heart. \nDept. at 35.\n \nThe Senate Committee issued its final report in April of 1976. One of the problems *1279 noted by the Committee in \nresponse to Roweโs testimony was that of the governmentโs:\nparticipation or unseemly involvement through its paid and directed informants in the violent or \ncriminal activity it is investigating. Senate Select Committee on Governmental Operations, Final \n\nReport, Book III at 239, April 23, 1976.5\n \nThus, in late 1975 and early 1976, Rowe for the first time disclosed that he did participate in acts of violence, and that this \nparticipation was known and approved by his contact agent. He also disclosed that the FBI was informed of planned violence, \nand only rarely, to Roweโs knowledge, took preventative steps. Moreover, the contents of Roweโs communication to his \ncontact agent on the morning of March 25 were disclosed: Rowe was elected to perform the greatest deed of his life for the \nKlan; his big day had finally come.\n \nDISCUSSION\nThe government contends that plaintiffsโ suit is barred by reason of 28 U.S.C. s 2401(b), which provides:\nA tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the \nappropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within \nsix months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the \nclaim by the agency to which it was presented.\nPlaintiffs filed their administrative claim with the FBI on October 12, 1977. No final disposition on this claim was made at \nthe time they filed this suit on July 5, 1979.\n \nIn support of the motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations, the government argues that, under s 2401(b), plaintiffsโ \ncause of action โaccruedโ in 1965, either on the date of their motherโs death or shortly thereafter. The government then \ncontends that upon this accrual in 1965, plaintiffs were under a duty to use due diligence to discover the avenues of legal \nrecourse available to them. According to the government, plaintiffsโ failure to discover their cause of action within two years \nof 1965, although unfortunate, cannot be excused. Under s 2401(b), it is argued, plaintiffsโ claim is โforever barred.โ\n \nPlaintiffs argue that, although they knew of their injuries in 1965, their cause of action against the government accrued no \nearlier than December 2, 1975, the date on which information was first disclosed suggesting a causative link between their \ninjuries and the federal government. Their failure to discover their cause of action, they argue, was caused, in part, and \naggravated by the governmentโs active concealment of information relevant to the circumstances of their motherโs death. \nThus, they argue, even exercising due diligence they could not have discovered their cause of action until Rowe testified at \nthe Committee hearings on December 2, 1975.\n \n[1]\n Statutes of limitation, in general, serve an important purpose, and\nrepresent a pervasive legislative judgment that it is unjust to fail to put the adversary on notice to defend within a specified \nperiod of time and that โthe right to be free from stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.โ \nThese enactments are statutes of repose; and although affording plaintiffs what the legislature deems a reasonable time to \npresent their claims, *1280 they protect defendants and the courts from having to deal with cases in which the search for \ntruth may be seriously impaired by the loss of evidence, whether by death or disappearance of witnesses, fading memories, \ndisappearance of documents, or otherwise. United States v. Kubrick, โ- U.S. โโ, โโ, 100 S.Ct. 352, 357, 62 L.Ed.2d \n259 (1979). Citations omitted.\nIn the context of tort claims against the United States, moreover, it must be borne in mind that the Federal Tort Claims Act is \na limited waiver of sovereign immunity, a waiver which should not be extended beyond that which Congress intended. Id.\n \nIn enacting s 2401(b), Congress directed tort claimants to present their claims within two years of the date on which their \ncauses of action accrue. Thus, the crucial question in this case concerns when plaintiffsโ cause of action against the United \nStates accrued within the meaning of s 2401(b).\n \nThe Supreme Court has recently provided guidance on the issue of when a cause of action accrues in the context of federal \ntort claims. In United States v. Kubrick, supra, a medical malpractice plaintiff brought suit within two years of the date on \nwhich he learned that the treatment which caused his injury may have constituted malpractice, but more than two years after \nthe date on which he had knowledge of both his injury and its cause. The Court was thus faced with the question of whether \nthe plaintiffโs cause of action accrued on the earlier date, when he had knowledge of his injury and its cause, or whether it \naccrued only on his awareness that he may have been legally wronged.\n\n \nIn concluding that the plaintiffโs cause of action accrued on the earlier date, the Court distinguished between knowledge of \ninjury and causation and knowledge of a legal wrong.\nWe are unconvinced that for statute of limitations purposes, a plaintiffโs ignorance of his legal rights \nand his ignorance of the fact of his injury or its cause should receive identical treatment. That he has \nbeen injured in fact may be unknown or unknowable until the injury manifests itself; and the facts \nabout causation may be in the control of the putative defendant, unavailable to the plaintiff or at least \nvery difficult to obtain. The prospect is not so bleak for a plaintiff in possession of the critical facts that \nhe has been hurt and who inflicted the injury. He is no longer at the mercy of the latter. There are \nothers who can tell him if he has been wronged, and he need only ask.\nKubrick, supra, at โโ, 100 S.Ct. at 359.\n \nThe Court stressed that the purpose of s 2401(b) is to require the reasonably diligent presentation of claims, and stated that \nthe postponement of accrual until a plaintiff is aware that his injury was negligently afflicted would undermine that purpose. \nThe Court stated that on knowledge of injury and causation, a plaintiff can seek out advice as to whether his treatment \nconformed to the generally applicable standard of medical care.\nBut however or even whether he is advised, the putative malpractice plaintiff must determine within \nthe period of limitations whether to sue or not, which is precisely the judgment that other tort claimants \nmust make. Id. at โโ, 100 S.Ct. at 360.\n \n[2]\n Thus, in the area of medical malpractice, it is clear that a plaintiffโs cause of action accrues within the meaning of s \n2401(b) on his knowledge of his injury and the relevant facts about causation. It must be noted, however, that the general \nrule, outside the malpractice and latent injury area, has been that a cause of action accrues immediately upon the potential \nplaintiffโs injury. See e. g., Kington v. United States, 396 F.2d 9 (6th Cir.), cert. den., 383 U.S. 960, 89 S.Ct. 396, 21 L.Ed.2d \n373 (1968); Steele v. United States, 599 F.2d 823 (7th Cir. 1979). If the pre-Kubrick general rule were applied in this case, it \nis clear that plaintiffsโ suit would be time-barred, unless plaintiffs could assert a successful tolling argument based on the \ngovernmentโs alleged fraudulent concealment of the relevant facts regarding their claims. On the other hand, if, as plaintiffs \nargue, Kubrick *1281 applies in the context of this suit, it is possible that plaintiffsโ claims are not time-barred. Application of \nKubrick in such a way as to hold that plaintiffsโ suit was timely filed, however, requires affirmative answers to two questions. \nFirst, does Kubrick apply outside the malpractice area? Second, does Kubrick apply to cases, like this one, in which the \nrelevant facts about causation, unknown to the plaintiffs, concern who caused the injury rather than what caused the injury?\n \nThe Scope of Kubrick:\nApplication to Non-Malpractice Cases\n \nThe determination of when a cause of action accrues for purposes of s 2401(b) has often been made by ascertaining the \nโtypeโ of case which is presented. Thus, in an โordinary tortโ case, the general rule that the claim accrues on the date of \ninjury was applied, Steele v. U. S., supra, and in a โwrongful deathโ case, the same rule was also followed. Kington v. U. S., \nsupra. Yet, โmedical malpracticeโ cases have triggered a different response from courts which, recognizing the inherent \nunfairness of imposing the statuteโs time limitations regardless of when the injury is manifested, have fashioned the more \nliberal discovery rule applicable to malpractice tort claims against the government. This categorical approach to limitations \ndefenses has not been altogether unwarranted. In most cases, plaintiffs are aware of the relevant facts as soon as they are \ninjured, and, likewise, most cases which present a compelling situation in which to apply the discovery rule are malpractice \ncases.\n \n[3]\n Nonetheless, strict application of the various doctrines developed under s 2401(b) according to the type of case presented \ncould impose harsh and, indeed, illogical consequences on any given plaintiff. Kubrick, this court believes, signals an end to \nthe categorical approach to the statute of limitations, and teaches that the facts in each case must be thoroughly examined to \ndetermine when the plaintiff had knowledge of the โcritical factsโ regarding his injury. On this date, his claim accrues, and \nthe plaintiff is charged with the duty of promptly investigating and presenting his claim. This court is aware of no reason why \nharsh consequences should be avoided in one category of cases and yet mechanically imposed in another. Rather, the \n\nrationale of Kubrick is broad enough to warrant, indeed compel, its application to a nonmalpractice case if the plaintiff in that \ncase is ignorant of the critical facts concerning his injury.\n \nThe Scope of Kubrick :\nCausation\n \n[4]\n In Kubrick, the Court had before it a case in which the plaintiff necessarily knew who caused his injury as soon as he \nlearned what caused his injury. The cause of plaintiffโs deafness in Kubrick was the treatment of his infection with neomycin, \nand there was no question regarding who administered the drug. Thus, the Court was not directly faced with the question of \nwhether a plaintiffโs ignorance of the identity of the person who caused the injury postpones the accrual of his cause of \naction. Nonetheless, the language and rationale of Kubrick indicate that ignorance of the โwhoโ element of causation should, \nlike ignorance of the โwhatโ element of causation, postpone accrual of a cause of action, at least in certain circumstances.\n \nAs noted above, Kubrick drew a distinction between a plaintiffโs ignorance of a legal wrong and ignorance of his injury and \nits cause. In so doing, the Court identified the โcritical factsโ that give rise to the accrual of a cause of action: that the plaintiff \nhas been injured and who inflicted the injury. Kubrick, supra, at โโ, 100 S.Ct. at 359. The rationale underlying the \npostponement of accrual until the plaintiff learns of both his injury and its cause rests on the Courtโs recognition that an injury \nmay itself be latent, and facts about causation may be in the control of the putative defendant, โunavailable to the plaintiff or \nat least very difficult to obtain.โ Once armed with the knowledge of his injury and its cause, however, a plaintiff is able to \ninvestigate whether he has suffered an actionable injury. Id.\n \n*1282 The Kubrick decision thus reflects a pragmatic reconciliation between two competing concerns. The first concern is to \npreserve the purpose of s 2401(b), that of requiring the reasonably diligent presentation of claims against the government. \nThe second concern, as the language in Kubrick makes clear, is that of fixing the date of accrual of a claim at that point in \ntime when the plaintiff can realistically be expected to undertake an investigation into the possibility of pressing a claim \nagainst the government. In Kubrick, the Court found that a malpractice plaintiff is able to conduct such an investigation when \nhe acquires knowledge of his injury and its cause, and that postponement of accrual beyond this time would undermine the \npurpose of the limitations statute.\n \n[5]\n Based on the above, it is clear that a plaintiffโs ignorance of the identity of the tortfeasor can be as critical an element to \naccrual as ignorance of what the tortfeasor did to cause the injury. Without knowledge of the identity of the tortfeasor, an \ninjured party may be helpless to discover the relevant information about his injury, including whether the tortfeasorโs conduct \nconformed to the standards required by law. Thus, the inquiries which Kubrick requires an injured party to make upon accrual \nof his claim may be foreclosed when he is ignorant of the identity of the persons responsible for his harm. Nonetheless, \nKubrick clearly instructs that reasonable diligence is required in presenting claims against the government, and accrual of a \ncause of action cannot be postponed beyond the date on which the injured party has sufficient information to conduct an \ninvestigation into the merits of his claims.\n \n[6]\n In order to determine the date of accrual of plaintiffsโ claims in this case, it is necessary to ascertain the earliest date on \nwhich plaintiffs had sufficient information to commence an investigation into whether they had a cause of action against the \ngovernment. As a matter of law, the date of accrual cannot be postponed beyond this time, for to do so would undermine the \npurpose of s 2401(b).\n \nAn examination of the facts in this case reveals that plaintiffs were aware of their injury and its direct cause almost \nimmediately upon its occurrence. This case presents an unusual factual situation, however, in that plaintiffs thought they \nknew who caused the injury as soon as they knew what caused their injury. Moreover, plaintiffs were not alone in their \nconception of the identities of the persons responsible for their motherโs death. In 1965, the official version of the Liuzzo \nmurder was that three Klansmen were solely responsible. Gary Rowe, by his testimony at three criminal trials, portrayed \nhimself as a helpless witness to the murder, and clearly stated that he had no idea that the car chase would result in a murder \nattempt. Roweโs testimony was not refuted or supplemented by any government personnel in such a way as to give notice to \nplaintiffs that his story was anything but accurate. Rather, his version of the events of March 25 was tacitly approved: by \nPresident Johnson when he credited the FBI with solving the murder, and by various FBI agents who, in 1965, had \nknowledge of the information to which Rowe later testified before the Senate Committee, and yet took no steps to correct the \nstory which the plaintiffs, as well as judges, jurors, and citizens of this country, were led to believe was true.\n\n \nDefendant argues that the impeachment attempts by defense counsel in the criminal trials were sufficient to put plaintiffs on \nnotice that they had a potential claim against the government. Affidavits submitted by two of the plaintiffs refute this \nargument. Although a mere suggestion of wrongdoing may, in some instances, provide an injured party with sufficient \ninformation to require him to investigate further, this court is of the opinion that both the source of the suggestion of \nwrongdoing and the context in which it was made must be considered. In this case, the suggestions that Rowe was involved \nin violence were made by counsel for the three Klan defendants in the criminal trials. One of the defense attorneys was a \nmember of the very organization to which the defendants belonged, the organization viewed by many *1283 as the direct \ncause of much of the violence against civil rights workers. Less credible sources for the true state of facts can scarcely be \nimagined, especially in view of the fact that Rowe consistently denied any wrongdoing.\n \nThe facts of this case amply demonstrate that plaintiffs had no reason to commence an investigation into governmental \ncomplicity in their motherโs murder until 1975, when Rowe publicly testified regarding his violent activities as an FBI \ninformer. Indeed, all indications, from the workings of the federal and state criminal justice systems to the public statements \nof President Johnson, led plaintiffs to the justifiable belief that those responsible for their motherโs murder had been \napprehended, tried, and incarcerated.\n \nUnder the circumstances of this case, it would be both unfair and unrealistic to hold that plaintiffs should have investigated \ntheir claims earlier, for they had no cause to do so. This case thus presents an instance in which knowledge of the identity of \nthe tortfeasor is a critical element to the accrual of a claim. Until 1975, plaintiffs had no knowledge sufficient to put them on \nnotice that the defendant or its agents may have caused their motherโs death. Roweโs 1975 testimony provided the first direct \ninformation of possible governmental malfeasance, and plaintiffsโ claims accrued no later, and no earlier, than this date. From \nDecember 2, 1975, plaintiffs had two years to determine whether they would file a claim against the government. This they \ndid, and Kubrick requires no more.\n \nThis court is cognizant of the fact that pre-Kubrick decisions of lower courts have held that a plaintiffโs ignorance of the \nidentity of the tortfeasor does not excuse a delay of more than two years in pressing a tort claim against the government. \nWhile these decisions are not binding on this court, it is important to note that they are distinguishable from the situation \npresented by the Liuzzo case, and may, in fact, survive Kubrick.\n \nOne line of cases holds that where a plaintiff knows both who and what caused his injury, the plaintiffโs ignorance of the fact \nthat the tortfeasor was a government employee does not toll the statute of limitations. Grix v. United States, C.A. No. \n74-72550 (E.D.Mich.1975); Baker v. United States, 341 F.Supp. 494 (D.Md.1972); Lien v. Beehner, 453 F.Supp. 604 \n(N.D.N.Y.1978). These cases stand for the proposition that when an injured party has knowledge as to who as well as what \ninflicted his harm, it is not unreasonable to impose on him the obligation to investigate the โlegalโ identity of the tortfeasor, \nor whether any entity is vicariously liable for the tortfeasorโs conduct. Kubrick appears to sanction the results reached in \nthese cases, because once a plaintiff has knowledge as to the identity of the tortfeasor he has sufficient information to \ncommence an investigation of the tortfeasorโs employment status, corporate status, and other legally recognized affiliations. \nIndeed, this is the type of inquiry that most tort plaintiffs make as a matter of course. If accrual of a plaintiffโs claim in this \nsituation were postponed, the purpose of the limitations statute would be undermined a result that Kubrick expressly forbids.\n \nThe difference between the facts of the Liuzzo case and the facts of the cited cases is readily apparent. In this case, the \nplaintiffs lacked knowledge of the identity of the persons they now allege to be tortfeasors and the fact that the alleged \ntortfeasors may have been culpably involved in the killing, as well as their status as governmental employees. In the cited \ncases, the plaintiffs were ignorant of only the latter. Thus, unlike the plaintiffs in Grix, Baker and Lien, the plaintiffs in this \ncase had no starting point from which to commence an investigation. Under Kubrick, a cause of action accrues at the earliest \npoint at which a plaintiff has knowledge of the critical facts surrounding his injury such that an investigation is both \nwarranted and realistically possible. For the Liuzzo plaintiffs, this was in 1975, when they learned that tortfeasors other than \nthe three Klansmen could possibly have been implicated in their motherโs death.\n \nAnother case holding that ignorance of the identity of the tortfeasor does not toll *1284 the statute of limitations is Steele v. \nUnited States, 599 F.2d 823 (7th Cir. 1979). In Steele, the plaintiff was injured while installing lights on an inactive runway at \nChicagoโs OโHare Airport. When he connected the wires to the transformer box, he received a severe shock because the \ncurrent to the box was on. The plaintiff in Steele sought to excuse his delay of 25 months in filing his claim against the \ngovernment, arguing that for two months after the accident he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable diligence could \nnot have known, that the Federal Aviation Administration maintained a remote power switch to the transformer. The court \nreviewed the procedural history of Steeleโs claims, and expressed some doubt as to whether Steele was truly ignorant of the \n\npower switch. Steele at 829, note 9. Apart from this, however, the court declined to apply the โdue diligence-discoveryโ rule \napplicable to malpractice claims to the โordinary tortโ situation presented by Steeleโs claims. The court instead followed the \ngeneral rule which states that when an injury coincides with a negligent act, and some damage is discernible at that time, the \ncause of action accrues and the statute starts running. Steele, at 828.\n \nThe facts as reported in the Steele decision give no indication of what obstacles, if any, prevented the plaintiff from \ndiscovering the existence of the FAAโs power switch. Assuming there were none, the Steele decision is not necessarily \nirreconcilable with Kubrick. Where a person is injured because of conduct known to be wrongful relative to a potentially \ndangerous physical object, that person has information adequate to investigate who had control over the object. The scope of \nsuch an investigation has a focal point, and is necessarily limited to that class of entities which had the reason, opportunity \nand means to exercise control over the object.\n \nUnlike the situation in Steele, the plaintiffs in this case had no reason to investigate the cause of their motherโs death in 1965, \nbecause, based on the information known at that time, they believed and were led to believe the cause to be the three \nKlansmen. Moreover, even if they had had reason to investigate further in 1965, it is not clear that the FBI should reasonably \nhave been a target of their inquiries. In the absence of any indication of wrongdoing, this court will not impose on plaintiffs \nthe retroactive duty to investigate the very organization credited with solving their motherโs murder, merely because one of \nits agents was present at the scene of the crime.\n \nThis court is persuaded that the facts of this case present a situation which, under Kubrick and the prior lower court decisions, \nexcuses plaintiffsโ delay in pressing their claims. Plaintiffsโ ignorance of the identities of the persons responsible for their \nmotherโs death prevented them from conducting the investigation which Kubrick requires plaintiffs to make upon accrual of \ntheir claims. Indeed, based on what was known in 1965, they had no reason to suspect that an investigation was even \nwarranted. Thus, their claims accrued no earlier than December 2, 1975, the date on which they obtained knowledge that the \ndefendantโs agents were possibly implicated in the murder. Because they filed their administrative claims within two years of \nthe date on which their claims accrued, s 2401(b), as interpreted by Kubrick, does not bar their claims.\n \nFinally, it is important to remember that the issue in this case is a narrow one involving the accrual of claims under a \ncongressionally enacted statute of limitations for tort claims filed against the United States. This decision is not a discussion \nof the correct or incorrect methods of crime investigation or law enforcement. It is not an effort to either condemn or praise \nany particular law enforcement agency for the methods it believes to be necessary to prevent and investigate crime. What is \ninvolved in this case as it relates to crime prevention and investigation is only the holding that activity that tends to hide the \nparticipation of government related personnel in torts that occur in the course of their duties may provide a longer time to \nthose injured to make claims than would be true if other methods were used. The longer period of time having been granted, \nthe *1285 ultimate issue of liability remains yet to be determined.\n \nFor the foregoing reasons, defendantโs motion is denied.\n \nSo ordered.\n \nAll Citations\n485 F.Supp. 1274\nFootnotes\n1\n28 U.S.C. ss 1346(b), 2401(b), 2671 et seq.\n2 Plaintiffs allege six separate causes of action in their complaint:\n(a) That FBI informant Gary Rowe wrongfully murdered Viola Liuzzo;\n(b) That Rowe wrongfully failed to prevent the murder of Viola Liuzzo;\n(c) That the FBI wrongfully recruited, trained, and supervised Rowe;\n(d) That the FBI wrongfully authorized Rowe to participate in illegal activities;\n(e) That the FBI wrongfully failed to prevent Viola Liuzzoโs murder;\neach of which directly or proximately caused Mrs. Liuzzoโs death, and\n(f) That the FBI wrongfully abused and mishandled Viola Liuzzoโs body after her death, and that as a \nproximate cause of such actions, plaintiffs suffered severe injuries, including emotional distress and mental \nanguish.\n3 Defendantโs motion to dismiss is brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

The arguments advanced in support of the motion have no bearing on the claim regarding the abuse of Mrs. \n \nLiuzzoโs body after her death. Amended Complaint, paragraph 18(f). The court will therefore treat this motion as being directed \nonly against the first five claims found in paragraph 18(a) through (e) of the Amended Complaint. \n \n2  Although defendant makes a concession to the contrary, when a claim โarisesโ for purposes of the proviso to 28 U.S.C. s 2680(h) \nbears no relationship to when a claim โaccruesโ under the FTCA statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. s 2401(b). The considerations \n \nand factors relevant to the accrual of a claim, and thus when a plaintiff must file his claim, do not affect whether or when \nCongress might decide to waive sovereign immunity for a claim. While due diligence is required in pressing a recoverable claim, \nCongress is certainly free to set an effective date for the waiver of sovereign immunity in this type of situation, and no amount of \ndiligence on plaintiffsโ part can alter the fact that the wrong occurred prior to the date that immunity was waived. \n \n3  Obviously, the government can be liable for Roweโs failure to act only if Rowe was an employee of the government and owed a \nduty to Mrs. Liuzzo to prevent the killing. The question of duty is discussed at pp. 935-936, infra. Because of the resolution \n \nreached on the proper scope of s 2680(h), the court finds it unnecessary to resolve at this time whether Rowe was, under the \nlaw, an โemployeeโ of the United States. Moreover, such a determination cannot be made on the record presently before the \ncourt, as there are material factual questions to be resolved with respect to this issue. \n \n4  See note 3, supra. \n \n \n5  It is clear that the F.B.I. had formulated policy with regard to the use of informants during the period in question, but the full \nscope of this policy and its precise terms do not presently appear in the record. The court and plaintiffs have received portions of \n \nthe F.B.I. Manual of Instructions on the use of criminal and racial informants and portions of Agents Handbook on the use of \ninformants. Counsel for defendant has been submitting these documents as they become available through efforts to respond to \ndiscovery requests, and it is not clear at this time that all relevant documents have been produced. Moreover, as plaintiffs allege \nthat the policy as formulated was negligently and wrongfully implemented, and as material factual questions remain as to these \nallegations, these issues are not ripe for summary judgment. See note 6, infra. \n \n6  Defendant also argues that the existing policy requirements were met by the F.B.I. with regard to Rowe. This argument is based \non the policy directive that criminal and racial informantsโ stability and reliability be periodically evaluated, and positive \n \nevaluations of Rowe in these respects by his agents. This argument misses the mark, however, for plaintiffs assert that these \nevaluations were not made with the requisite degree of care. Whether Roweโs agents did act negligently or wrongfully in this \nrespect presents a factual issue which cannot be resolved on this motion. For purposes of this discussion, it is sufficient that \nthese claims are not barred by s 2680(a). \n \n7  See, e. g., United Scottish Ins. Co. v. United States, 614 F.2d 188 (9th Cir. 1979), and cases cited at 192-98; LeSuer v. United \nStates, 617 F.2d 1197 (5th Cir. 1980); Gelley v. Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., 466 F.Supp. 182 (D.Minn.) affโd 610 F.2d 588 \n \n(8th Cir. 1979); Devlin Lumber & Supply Corp. v. United States, 488 F.2d 88 (4th Cir. 1973); Zeller v. United States, 467 F.Supp. \n487 (E.D.N.Y.1979); Geo. Byers Sons, Inc. v. East Europe Import Export, Inc., 463 F.Supp. 135 (D.Md.1979). The court is not \nunaware of authority to the contrary. See, e. g., Blanton v. United States, 428 F.Supp. 360 (D.D.C.1977); Gill v. United States, 429 \nF.2d 1072 (5th Cir. 1972). However, many of the cases appearing to adopt the theory that breach of federally imposed duties \ncreates a cause of action cognizable under the FTCA can be explained on the bases of the โGood Samaritanโ basis for tort \nrecovery alluded to in Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61, 76 S.Ct. 122, 100 L.Ed. 48 (1955). See United Scottish Ins. \nCo., supra, 614 F.2d at 197, n.9. To the extent that there is authority for imposing liability for breach of duties imposed by federal \nlaw or regulations, the court declines to follow those cases, and adheres to the view that liability under the FTCA must be \n  13 \n \n\ngrounded in state substantive law. This result is required by the language of 28 U.S.C. s 1346(b) and is consistent with the \nSupreme Courtโs view of that section in Carlson v. Green, supra. \n \n8  The theory of recovery recognized by s 319 of the Restatement rests on the commission of a tort by the person controlled by the \ndefendant. The courtโs holding that plaintiffsโ cause of action based on s 319 is a valid one is similarly limited. \n \n \n9  The Senatorsโ interest in the conduct of Rowe as an F.B.I. informant was apparently sparked by reports in the New York Times \nand on the ABC networkโs television show โ20-20โ that Rowe had been involved in violent crimes and had shot Mrs. Liuzzo. First \n \naffidavit of Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Counsel on Professional Responsibility, filed in Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Dept. of Justice, \nCiv. No. 80-1172 (D.D.C.), P 3. The โPlayboyโ affidavits have been submitted by plaintiffs as exhibits. \n \n10  The Office of Professional Responsibility was created in 1975, and serves as a special review and advisory body within the \nDepartment of Justice. It reports directly to the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, or \n \nSolicitor General. The OPR receives and reviews information or allegations concerning conduct by members of the Department of \nJustice that may be in violation of the law, Department regulations or orders, or applicable standards of conduct. Declaration of \nAttorney General Benjamin Civiletti, P 6, submitted in support of defendantโs response in opposition to plaintiffsโ motion to \ncompel. \n \n11  Declaration of Michael E. Shaheen, Counsel on Professional Responsibility, P 4, submitted in support of defendantโs response in \nopposition to plaintiffsโ motion to compel. \n \n \n12  Second affidavit of Michael E. Shaheen in Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Dept. of Justice. \n \n \n13  The declaration of Attorney General Civiletti is lengthy and will not be set forth in any detail. Summarizing, he asserts that the \nReport must remain confidential in order to: maintain the confidentiality of sources so as to avoid a chilling effect on future \n \ninvestigations; protect the ability of the Attorney General to receive reports with candor; protect certain grand jury material; \nprotect the ability of the Department of Justice to respond to congressional inquiries; and, in general, maintain the effectiveness \nof the Department of Justice. \nThe declaration of Michael Shaheen is also offered in support of the claim of privilege. Mr. Shaheen states that he oversaw the \nwork of the Task Force, and reviewed, commented on, and submitted the Report to Attorney General. He claims that the \nReport is a predecisional communication, and that to the extent that the Report includes factual accounts, these accounts are \nthe composite product of selection, interpretation, and integration by the Task Force. According to Mr. Shaheen, there are no \nparts of the Report which are strictly factual and not part of the analytical process. Thus, he claims, no parts of the Report not \nalready available can be segregated for release. He claims the Report must remain confidential in order to: protect the ability \nof the OPR and Department of Justice to receive information from individuals who would not come forward unless \nconfidentiality is maintained; protect the lives of various informants; and protect the frank, candid environment within the \nDepartment of Justice necessary to the deliberative process. \nCertain aspects of the declarations touch on privileges not briefed by defendant, e. g., the informantโs privilege (protecting \ninformation which would jeopardize the safety of informants) and the protection of grand jury material under F.R.Cr.P. 6. This \nopinion does not deal with any privilege other than that briefed by the government, the deliberative process privilege. \nDefendant has attempted to reserve its ability to argue the applicability of these privileges should it become necessary. \nMemorandum to Accompany In Camera Submission, n.1. The courtโs resolution of this motion has rendered defendantโs \nposition on the other privileges moot. However, the court notes that the better procedure would have been to present all \nprivilege claims in the first instance in order to avoid the necessity: (1) to determine if the nonassertion of claimed privileges \noperates to waive those claims, and (2) if the privileges are not so waived, to determine the issues involved on a motion to \ncompel on a piecemeal basis. The defendant is instructed to follow this approach if a similar motion is presented in the future. \n \n14  This rule was one of the privilege rules not adopted by Congress. Congress instead adopted a privilege rule, Rule 501, which \nstated that privilege โshall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the Courts of the \n \nUnited States in light of reason and experience.โ The considered judgment of the Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence, the \nCommittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, the Judicial Conference and the Supreme Court in approving the draft of the \nprivilege rules is strong evidence that the rule is in accordance with the principles of common law โin light of reason and \nexperience.โ The rules were not rejected by Congress because they were incorrect, but because of serious doubts as to the right \nor wisdom of the adoption of privilege rules by means of the rule making process. The cases decided by the Supreme Court since \nthe publication of the privilege rules are not inconsistent with the draft rule. United States v.

Kennedy  and  James \nAbourezk  sent  a  joint  letter to  the  Department  of  Justice \nstating  that the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  was  'iintensely \ninterested\"  in  receiving  a  full  report  on  an  investigation \ninto  allegations  that Mr.  Gary  Thomas  Rowe,  Jr.,  committed  a \nviolent  crime  while  a  government  informant. \nOn  July  8,  9,  and  11,  1978,  the ยทNew  York  Times  had \npublished  reports  that  Gary  Thomas  Rowe,  Jr.,  had  taken  part \nin violent  crimes  with  klansmen  while  serving  the  FBI  as  an \ninformant within  the  Ku  Klux  Klan  in  Birmingham  from  1960  to \n1965.  In  particular,  the  Times  reported  that  in  1963,  Rowe  shot \nan  unidentified black man,  and  was  told by  his  handling  FBI  agent \nto keep  quiet  about  it.  ABC  television had  also  shown  in \nJuly  1978,  a  two-part  documentary  suggesting  that  Rowe  fired \nthe  bullet which  killed Viola  Liuzza,  a  civil  rights  worker \nwho  was  shot  on  U.  S.  Highway  80  on  March  25,  1965,  following \nthe  Selma  to  Montgomery  freedom  march,  and  that he  gave \n\"indications  of  deception\"  when  he  told  a  polygrapher .in \n1978  that he  had  not  fired  into Viola  Liuzzo's  car.  ABC \nalso  repor~ed that  Collie  Leroy  Wilkins  gave  a  \"truthful \nresponse\"  when  he  told  a  polygrapher  that  Rowe  had  fired \ntoward  the  Liuzza  car  in  1965. \nAfter  receiving  the  Senators'  letter,  Deputy  Attorney \nGeneral  Benjamin  Civiletti  assigned  the matter  in-\nvolving  the  unidentified black  man  to  the  Criminal  Division \n- 1  -\n\nand  the  remaining  allegations  to  the  Department's  Office  of \nProfessional  Responsibility. \nOn  August  1,  1978,  Assistant  Attorney  General  Philip  B. \nHeymann  informed  the  Deputy  Attorney  General  th~t the  Criminal \nDivision  needed  full  access  to  the  FBI's  files  to \ncomplete  its  investigation  and  noted  that  the  Statute  of \nLimitations  had  run  on  any  violations  of  Federal  law  that \nRowe  might  have  been  committed  in  the  early  1960's. \nOn  August  16,  1978,  FBI  Director William  H.  Webster \nforwarded  to  the  Counsel,  Office  of  Professional  Responsi-\nbility  for  the  Department  of  Justice,  a  510-page  report  on . \nits preliminary  inquiry  of  the  Rowe  allegations,  based  on  a \nreview  of  FBI  files.  After  examining  this  and  the  Criminal \nDivision's  report,  the  Counsel  ยทrequested  the  Attorney  Gen-\neral  to  assign  four  attorneys  to  complete  the  Rowe  inquiry. \nOn  October  24,  1978,  Attorney  General  Griffin  B.  Bell \ncreated  a  special  task  force  of  four  attorneys  to  investigate \nand  report  on  the  following  matters: \n(1)  Whether  FBI  personnel  acted  improperly  in \nhandling  Mr.  Gary  Thomas  Rowe  while  he \nserved  as  a  Bureau  informant  within  the  United \nKlans  of  America  (UKA); \n(2)  Whether  Civil  Rights  Division  attorneys, \nwho  tried United  States  v.  Eaton,  et al.  (the \nfederal  civil  rights  case  arising  out  of  the  high \nway  murder  of  Mrs.  Viola  Liuzzo),  were  aware  of \nMr.  Rowe's  alleged  unreliability,  or  suspected  he  was \nunreliable;  and \n(3)  Whether  there  is  any  evidence  to  sub \nstantiate  the  allegation  that  Mr.  Rowe  was \n... \n\\ \n/  - 2  -\n\nresponsible  for  the  death  of  Mrs.  Viola  Liuzzo \n(to  the  extent  this  is  possible  without  preju \ndicing  the  rights  of  Mr.  Rowe  or  the  State  of \nAlabama  in view  of  Mr.  Rowe's  recent  state \nindictment  for  the  murder). \nRalph  Hornblower,  III,  returning  to  the  Deparqnent  of \nJustice,  was  app9inted  to  lead  the  Task  Force,  taking  a \nleave  of  absence  from  a  Washington,  D.C.  law  firm.  Three \nattorneys  were  selected  from  the  Department  of  Justice; \nWilliam M.  Logan,  Criminal  Section,  Tax  Division;  John  R. \nFleder,  Consumer  Affairs  Section,  Antitrust  Division;  Donald \nR.  Burkhalter,  Executive  Office  for  United  States  Attorneys. \nMarydale  Drury,  an  Intelligence  Research  Specialist  for \nthe  Organized  Crime  and  Racketeering  Section,  Criminal \nI \nDivision,  was  also  appointed  to  the  Task  Force. \n- 3  -\n\nII.  SUMMARY  OF  FINDINGS \nThe  FBI  paid  Gary  Thomas  Rowe,  Jr.  to  inform  on  the  Ku \nKlux  Klan  from  1960  to  1965  -- a  time  when  the  city of \nBirmingham was  in  the  throes  of  a  violent  civil rig~ts \nstruggle.  Extremists  were  at  that  time  bombing  churches  and \nhomes,  protesting  the  civil  rights  movement.  The  FBI \nbelieved  that  a  hard  core  of  klansmen  in  the  Eastview  13 \nklavern  of  the  Alabama  Knights  of  the  Ku  Klux  Klan  were \nresponsible  for  much  of  the  violence.  Rowe  was  recruited  to \ninfiltrate their  ranks. \nHe  rose  rapidly  and  soon  became  a  confidant  of  several \nklan  leaders.  He  gave  the  Bureau  more  and  better  informa-\ntion  than  any  klan  informant  in  the  city.  Following  Bureau \npolicy,  Rowe's  handling  agents  first  instructed  him  to  get \nclose  to  the  klansmen  to  find  out what  they were  doing,  but \nto  stay  away  when  things  got  violent.  However,  both  Rowe \nand  some  of  the  agents  soon  recognized  that  he  would  never \npenetrate  the  inner  circle  responsible  for  the  violence \nwithout  taking  part,  at  least to  some  extent,  in  its plan-\nning  and  execution.  Nonetheless,  the  agents  warned  him  that, \nif he  did  get  involved  in violence,  the  Bureau  would  disown \nhim  and  treat him  like  a  common  criminal.  This  did  not  prove \nto  be  the  case.  When  agents  learned  that  Rowe  had  taken \npart  in klan  beatings,  they  apparently  never  reported \nhim  to  local  authorities  or  terminated  him  as \nan  informant.  While  the  files  do  not  say  so  specifically, \n- 4  -\n\nit seems  clear that  he  was  simply  too  valuable  to  abandon. \nThe  Task  Force  found  evidence  indicating  that  some  agents \nfailed  to  report  to  their  superiors  all  they  knew  abo~t his \nviolent  activities. \nRowe  told  the  Task  Force  that he  established his \ncredibility in  the  klan  by  beating  up  blacks  and  civil \nrights  demonstrators  on  city buses  and  at  lunch  counters, \nbut  nothing  in  FBI  files  indicates  that he  told his  agents \nabout  it.  On  the  contrary,  on  August  3,  1961,  he  had  told \nthe  FBI  that he  was  able  to  persuade  Eastview  13  not  to  com-\nmit  violence  on  city buses.  He  now  boasts  that  he  frequently \nfought  and  raised hell  on  his  \"own  time\"  and  did  not  report \nit to  the  FBI  because  it was  \"none .of  their business\". \nDuring  his  f ir'st three  years  with  the  FBI,  Rowe  reported \nthat he  was  merely  present  only  a  few  times  when  klan  violencP \nbroke  out.  One  occasion was  a  night  ride  to  rough  up  an \nelderly white  couple  who  was  raising  a  black  child,  and \nanother was  an  attack on  blacks  at  a  local  carnival.  (Rowe \nnow  says  that he  threw  a  sheet  over  the  old man's  head,  and \nbeat  up  several  blacks  at  the  carnival.)  In  another  incident, \nRowe  reported  that he  was  present when  a  group  of  klansmen \nbeat  up  a  black  person  at  a  lunch  counter.  Rowe  now  says \nhe  assaulted  two  people.  However,  his  reports  to  the  FBI, \ngiven  orally  and  later written  up  by  his  agent,  only \n- 5  -\n\nvaguely  describe  the  incidents  without  defining  Rowe's  role. \nIn  each  case,  there  is  nothing  in  the  records  at  least  to \nsuggest  that  agents  ever  tried  toยท find  out what  Rowe  was \nreally doing. \nThe  most  serious  incident  of  Rowe's  early years  in  the \nklan  occurred  at the  Trailways  bus  station  in  Birmingham  on \nMay  14,  1961.  Rowe  reported  several  days  in  advance  that \nthe  klan  planned  to  attack  a  group  of  freedom  riders  ar \nriving  that day,  and  that  Public  Safety  Director  Eugene \n\"Bull\"  Connor  had  promised  klan  leaders  fifteen minutes  to \ndo  their work  before  the  police moved  in.  The  Bureau  noti \nfied  the  Chief  of  Police  at  least  four  times  that  trouble \nwas  brewing,  but  did  not  place  agents  at  the  scene  when  it \nhappened.  The  Task  Force  determined  that of  the  hundreds  of \npeople  at the  station  that day,  Rowe  was  one  of  a  handful \nmost  responsible  for  the  beatings.  The  strongest  evidence \nis  a  front  page  photograph  published  in  the  Birmingham  Post \nHerald  the  next  day,  showing  Rowe  beating  up  a  freedom \nrider.  In  attempting  to  identify  the  attackers,  Rowe's \nhandling  agent  discussed  the  photograph with  him  several \ntimes,  but  apparently  never  told his  superiors  that  Rowe  was \nin  the  picture.  Washington  was  informed  only  that_Rowe  had \n\"peaceably  demanded\"  film  from  some  photographers. \nHowever,  on  another  occasion,  the  Task  Force  found \nthat  Rowe  attempted  to  save  the  life of  a  prominent \n- 6  -\n\ncivil  rights  leader.  On  July  20,  1962,  he  told  the  FBI  that \nthe  klan's  Grand  Titan  had  appointed  Rowe  and  four  other \nklansmen  to murder  Rev.  Fred  L.  Shuttlesworth,  at  a  planned \nsit-in at  a  local  airport  restaurant.  The  Burea~ alerted \nr \nShuttlesworth  and  the  police  of  the  plan,  and  foiled  the \nklansmen  waiting  at  the  airport.  Shuttlesworth  did  not \nappear  and  the  klansmen  were  dissuaded  from  attacking  anyone \nwhen  an  extra detail  of  police  pulled  into  the  restaurant. \nThe  Bombings \nRowe  has  been  alleged  to have  been  involved  in  some  of \nthe  bombings  that  struck  Birmingham  in  1963,  including  the \nbombing  of  the  16th  Street  Baptist  Church.  The  Task  Force \ncould  find  no  evidence  that he  was  associated with  the \nchurch bombing  in which  four  young  girls were  killed. \nHowever,  he  now  admits  that he  was  present when  klansmen \nfirebombed  the  home  of  a  prominent  black  businessman, \nA.  G.  Gaston,  one  week  before  the  church was  hit.  Rowe  says \nhe  told  the  FBI  about  the  Gaston  bombing,  but  the  Task  Force \nfound  nothing  to  support  this.  FBI  agents  vigorously  deny \nany  knowledge  of  Rowe's  involvement -in  any  Birmingham  bombing. \nFiles  obtained by  the  Task  Force  show  that  an  all out, \nfull  field  investigation of  the  1963  church  bombing  led  the \nFBI  to  identify  four  or  five  key  suspects.  In  1964,  the \nBureau  interviewed  two  persons  who  reported  that  they  had \nseen  four  white  men  ,  all klansmen,  drive  up  to  16th  Street \n- 7  -\n\nand  Sixth Aveยท~n  ue  in  the  early morning  of  September  15,  1963, \nonly  eight hours  before  the  destruction  occurred  and  at  least \none  of  the  four  walked  toward  the  church  carrying  an  object \nwith  a  handle.  Rowe  was  not  among  them. \nThe  Birmingham  field  off ice  urged  the  Bureau  to  present \nthis  evidence  to  the  Department  of  Justice  in  order  to  ob-\ntain  a  prosecutive  opinion,  but  Director  Hoover  overruled, \nexplaining  that  the  \"chance  of  successful  prosecution \nis  very  remote.\"  Consequently,  the  evidence  remained  in  FBI \nfiles  until  over  ten  years  later,  when  the  State  of  Alabama \nopened  a  grand  jury which  lead  to  the  murder  conviction \nin  1977  of  Robert  Chambliss,  one  of  the  four  men  whom  the  in-\nformants  spotted  near  the  church  that  night. \nThe  Task  Force  also  discovered  that Birmingham  Police \nhad  seen  Rowe  near  the  site of  another  bombing  at Sixth \nAvenue  and  Center  Street  in  an  all black  neighborhood  in \nWest  Birmingham  on  September  25,  1963.  Rowe  told the  FBI \nthat he  was  driving  his  girlfriend home  when  he  heard  an \nexplosion  and  rushed  to  the  nearest  telephone  booth  -- to \ncontact  the  FBI.  Minutes  later a  shrapnel  bomb  also exploded. \nFBI  files  contain  nothing  which  suggests  that  agents  ever \nsuspected he  was  involved,  although  he  was  in  the  vicinity \nof  the  bombings.  Yet,  there  is  evidence  that  Rowe  knew  more \nabout  the  Center  Street bombing  than  he  let on  when  first \ncontacted  after the  explosion.  Seven months  later he  told \nhis  handling  agent  (apparently  for  the  first  time)  that \nChambliss  and  his  associates  had  discussed how  to make \nshrapnel  bombs  less  than  two  weeks  before  the  shrapnel  bomb \nwent  off  at  Center  Street. \n- 8  -\n\nr \nI \nRowe  told  the  Task  Force  that  he  shot  a  black man  in \nself-defense  at  the  height  of  a  race  riot  in  the  fall  of \n1963,  reported  it to  his  handling  agent,  and  was  told  to \nkeep  quiet  about  it.  We  found  no  evidence  to  support  Rowe '.s \n(  . \nstory,  and  after  interviewing  city officials,  including  the \nCounty  Coroner,  discovered  no  City  or  County  records  to \nconfirm  it.  If  Rowe  is  telling the  truth  about  this  inci-\ndent,  then  it is most  likely  that  the  man  was  injured and \ntreated  at one  of  the  city's hospitals.  Death  records  should \nhave  provided  at least  some  corroboration  for  his  story,  but \nthey  do  not.  Rowe's  handling  agent  at  the  time  of  the \nalleged  shooting, .insists  that  Rowe  never  told  him  about  the \nshooting. \nJanuary  1964  - March  24,  1965 \nBy  late  1963,  the  Birmingham  field  office was  able  to \ndevelop  other  informants  within  Eastview  13  who  began  to  re-\nport on  Rowe.  They  told  the  office  that  Rowe  had  punched  a \nnewspaperman,  apparently without  provocation,  and  that he \nhad  participated  in  beating  up  blacks  at  a  baseball  field \nin  Birmingham.  Rowe  himself  told  the  FBI  that he  had  become \nleader of  one  of  the  klan's  most  violent .\"action  squads\".  When \nHeadquarters  found  out,  he  was  ordered  to  step down  as \nsquad  leader,  but  allowed  to  remain  on  the  squad.  Reports \nthat  Rowe  was  deeply  involved  in  klan  violence  apparently \nnever  triggered  investigations  into precisely what  he  was \ndoing  wi~h his  Eastview  associates.  As  long  as  h~ was  pro-\nviding  good  intelligenceยท,  the  Birmingham  field  office  ap-\npeared willing  to  overlook  Rowe's  own  involvement. \n9  -\n\n\"Huey  Lipscomb\" \nThe  FBI  was  able  to  develop  another  informant  named \nHuey  Lipscomb  [l]  from  the  Eastview  \"inner circle\"  in  late \n1963.  The  Task  Force  discovered  that  Lipscomb  pl9nned  and \ncarried out  serious  acts  of  violence,  both  before  and while \nhe  served  as  an  FBI  informant  from  1963  through  1965.  The \nrecord  shows  the  FBI  was  fully  aware  of  Lipscomb's  back-\nground  and  criminal  activities,  including  his  taking  part  in \nplanning  the  murder  of  Reverend  Fred  Shuttlesworth,  before \nmaking  him  an  informant.  Yet  we  found  no  evidence  that  the \nBureau  sought  to  limit his  violent  and  unlawful  activity \nwhile  they  were  paying  him  for  intelligence  on  the  klan. \nThe  Killing  of  Viola  Liuzzo \nOn  March  25,  1965,  a  civil  rights  worker  from  Detroit, \nnamed  Viola  Liuzzo,  was  shot  and  killed while  driving  on \nU.S.  Highway  80,  following  the  Selma  to  Montgomery  freedom \nmarch.  Gary  Thomas  Rowe,  Jr.  immediately  reported  to  the \nFBI  that he  was  in  the  car  from  which  the  fatal  shots  were \nfired.  Based  in  part on  President  Johnson's  request,  the \nBureau  opened  a  massive  investigation  and  arrested  the  car's \nthree  other  occupants  the  day  after  the  shooting.  Criminal \ncharges  were  filed  against  Collie  Leroy  Wilkins,  Eugene \nThomas  and  William  O.  Eaton  in  state  and  federal  courts. \nWith .Rowe  as  the  Government's  star witness  in  two  state \nmurder  trials  and  one  federal  civil  rights  trial,  Wilkins \n1.  All  informants'  names  have  been  changed  in  this  report \nin order  to  protect  their  identities. \n- 10  -\n\nwas  acquitted  in  state  court,  but  all  three were  convicted \nin  federal  court  for  violating Mrs.  Liuzzo's  civil  rights \nand  sentenced  to  serve  ten  year prison  terms.  Rowe  was  not \ncharged  in  connection with  the  Liuzzo  killing  until  1978, \ni \nwhen  he  was  indicted  for  murder  by  an  Alabama  grand  jury. \nThe  Alabama  investigation began  after Wilkins  and  Thomas \naccused  Rowe  of murdering  Mrs.  Liuzzo  in  a  July  1978  ABC-TV \ndocumentary. \nRowe  testified under  oath  in  all three  trials  and  has \ntalked  about  the  Liuzzo  killing  for  the  record  eight other \ntimes.  Much  of what  he  has  said  about  the  night  of  March  25 \nremains  consistent  throughout  all  the  accounts.  But  we  did \ndiscover  jarring discrepancies  in  key  aspects  of  his  1965 \ntestimony  and  of  the  accounts  he  gave  in 1975  and  later. \nFor  example,  Rowe  now  says  he  saw  Wilkins  shoot  both  Viola \nLiuzzo  and  her  passenger,  but  in  1965  he  testified that he \ntold Wilkins  after the  shooting  that he  [Wilkins]  had  missed. \nRowe  now  says  under  oath  that  the  klansmen  returned  to  the \nLiuzzo  car  immediately  after  the  shooting,  but  in  1965  he \ntestified in  court  that  they  never  turned  back.  He  made \nother  inconsistent  statements,  but  on  the  ultimate  question \nwho  killed Viola  Liuzzo  -- he  has  steadfastly maintained  his \ninnocence. \nCollie  Leroy  Wilkins,  Eugene  Thomas  and  William  0.  Eaton \nKlansmen  Eugene  Thomas  and  Collie  Leroy  Wilkins  were  in \nthe  car with  Rowe  the  night  Mrs.  Liuzzo  was  killed as  was \no. \nWilliam  Eaton,  who  died  shortly  after  the  three  were \n- 11  -\n\nconvicted  in  federal  court  of  violating  her  civil  rights. \nBoth  Thomas  and  Wilkins,  zealous  segregationists,  had  a \nhistory  of  violence  before  Mrs.  Liuzzo  was  shot.  Thomas  was \na  high  official  in  the  Alabama  klan,  and  a  close personal \n( \nfriend  and  mentor  to Wilkins,  twenty  years  his  junior. \nAlthough  they  distrusted  Rowe  and  may  have  suspected  he \nwas  a  Government  informant,  they  allowed  him  to  travel with \nthem  to  Montgomery  on  March  25,  1965,  supposedly  to watch \nthe  freedom  marchers.  They  told  the  Task  Force  they  did  not \nplan  any  violence,  but  both  Eaton  and  Thomas  were  armed. \nWilkins,  on  probation  for  a  federal  firearms  violation,  did \nnot  bring  a  gun. \nAlthough  Thomas'  and  Wilkins'  1979  accounts  of what \nhappened  on  March  25,  1965,  are  consistent on  some  basic \npoints,  there  are  discrepancies  on  these  issues:  how  Rowe \nhappened  to  be  invited  on  their Montgomery  trip,  what  was \nsaid  in the  car  before  and  after  the  shooting,  how  Rowe \nreacted  to  the  marchers,  how  many  shots  were  fired,  who \nfired  first,  where  they  went  after  the  shooting  and  how  they \nconspired  to  cover  it up. \nThomas  also  gave  the  Task  Force  an  account which  is \ninconsistent with what  he  said  shortly  after his  arrest  in \n1965:  namely,  where  they  were  seated  in  the  car,  and  what \nThomas  did with  his  gun  on  March  25th. \nThomas  and  Wilkins  now  say  that  at the  three  trials \nthey  did  not  accuse  Rowe  of  firing  the  fatal  shots  because \n- 12  -\n\ntheir attorneys  advised  them  to  keep  quiet.  To  have  admitted \non  the  stand  that  they  were  in  the  car would  have  made  their \nconvictions  on  accessory  charges  much  more  likely,  they  said. \nThey  could  not  adequately  explain why  they  failep  to  speak \nout  after  their  convictions,  however.  Thomas  vaguely  said \nhe  was  afraid of  jeopardizing his  parole,  and  Wilkins  merely \noffered  that  no  one  in  authority  or  in  the  press  had  ever \nasked  him  whether  he,  in  fact,  killed Mrs.  Liuzzo. \nGiven  their history  of  violence,  their conflicting \nstories  about  the  shooting,  their  failure  to  accuse  Rowe \nbefore  1978,  and  their obvious  desire  for  revenge,  neither \nWilkins  nor  Thomas  make  credible witnesses. \nLeroy  Moton \nAlthough  Rowe  continues  to  insist that  Leroy  Moton  was \nnot  the  black man  in  the  car with  Mrs.  Liuzzo  on  the  night \nshe  was  killed,  all  available  evidence  is  to  the  contrary. \nFBI  records  clearly document  what  Moton  did  and  where  he \nwent  after the  shooting.  Numerous  witnesses  confirm  that \nMoton  drove  Mrs.  Liuzzo's  car  throughout  March  25th,  and \nseveral  people  saw  them  together  in  her  car  that  afternoon. \nFBI  interview reports  establish  that he  was  picked  up  near \nthe  scene  of  the  shooting  and  that he  immediately  reported \nthe  shooting  to  his  rescuers,  who  then  notified  the  FBI.  Agents \nwere  able  to  interview him  four  hours  after the  incident. \nPhysical  Evidence \nFBI  laboratory  analysis  clearly established  Eugene \nThomas'  .38  revolver  as  the  murder  weapon.  Ballistic tests \n\\ \n_, \n)  - 13  -\n\ntaken  shortly  after  the  killing proved  that  the  bullet  found \nlodged  in  Liuzzo's  spine was  fired  from  Thomas'  gun.  However, \nno  one  claims  that  Thomas  or  Eaton  fired  it because  Thomas \nwas  driving,  and  all  agree  that Eaton  had  a  .22.  As  there \nwere  no  fingerprints  taken  from  the  murder  weapon  or  shell \ncasings,  it is  impossible  to  determine,  on  the  basis  of \nphysical  evidence,  who  actually  fired  Thomas'  gun.  The  FBI \nagent  who  seized  the  weapon  at  Thomas'  house  on  March  26, \n1965,  concluded  on  first  inspection  that  the  gun  had  been \nwiped  clean,  and  consequently,  in  a  possible  violation of \nBureau  policy,  never  ordered  a  fingerprint  check. \nThe  Prosecutions \nGary  Thomas  Rowe  testified at  the  second  Wilkins' \nmurder  trial and  the  federal  civil  rights  trial  that  he  did \nnot  take  part  in  the  violence  at  Trailways  on  May  14ยท,  1961, \nand  that he  did  not  appear  in  a  Saturday  Evening  Post  photo \ngraph  of  the  incident. \nIn  1975,  Rowe  admitted  that  he  was  in  the  picture  and \nclaimed  that the  FBI  had  instructed  him  to  lie  about  it.  He \nsaid  the  same  to  the  Task  Force  in  1979.  However,  all of \nthe  FBI  agents  we  talked  to  denied  so  instructing  Rowe. \nFormer  Assistant  Attorney  General  John  Doar  was  shown \nthe  picture  at  the  federal  trial,  but  does  not  recall  asking \nBureau  agents  or  Rowe  whether  Rowe  was  in  fact  in  the  picture, \neven  though  Rowe  had  been  questioned  about  it at  the  second \nstate  trial -- testimony  which  the  Civil  Rights  Division \nreviewed  before  the  federal  trial. \n- 14  -\n\nCivil  Rights  Division  attorneys  assigned  to  the  Liuzzo \ncase  asked  the  Bureau  for  complete  background  information  on \nRowe,  Thomas,  Wilkins  and  Eaton,  and  on  the  Bessemer  and \nEastview klaverns,  along  with  other  investigative  information \nf \n1  on  the  Liuzzo  killing.  The  Division  also  searched  its own \nfiles  and  found  three  instances  in which  Rowe  was  apparently \ninvolved  in violence,  but  this  did  not  cause  them  to  suspect \nRowe  as  the  killer.  In  accordance  with  FBI  policy,  the \nBureau  did  not  provide  the  Department  with  all the  information \nfrom  their  files  on  Rowe.  It was  difficult,  therefore,  for  the \nprosecutors  to make  an  informed  evaluation of  Rowe's  credibility. \nHowever,  we  found  no  evidence  that  the  FBI  deliberately withheld \ninformation  about  Rowe  from  the  prosecutors  for  the  purpose  of \neliminating  Rowe  as  a  suspect  in  the  shooting. \nWe  found  no  evidence  that  any  FBI  agents  or  Department \nattorneys  who  worked  on  the  case  ever  believed  that  Rowe \nfired  the  fatal  shots  on  the  night  of  March  25th. \nThe  FBI  Guidelines \nThe  Task  Force  closely  examined  FBI  regulations  governing \nthe  use  of  informants  in  the  early  1960's.  We  discovered \nthat  the  FBI  Manual  of  Instructions  provided  agents  with  no \nguidance  on  how  to  advise  or  control  an  informant  found  to \nhave  engaged  in violence  or most  criminal  activity,  and  we \ncould  locate,  after months  of  searching  in Washington  and \nBirmingham,  only  a  few  documents  which  considered ยทthe  subject \nat  all.  The  Task  Force  interviewed  eighteen  FBI  agents  and \nnine  informants  to  see  how  these  rules  operated  in  practice. \nMost  of  the  supervisors  and  Headquarters  officials  told us \n- 15  -\n\nthat  informants  were  absolutely  prohibited  from  taking  part \nin violence,  but  several  field  agents  said  that  klan  infor-\nmants  had  to  participate  in  violence  in  order  to  penetrate \nthe  klan's  inner  circle  and  obtain  critical  information. \nr \nExcept  for  Rowe,  all  the  informants  we  talked  to  said  that \ntheir  agents  did,  in  fact,  advise  them  to  avoid  violence  and \ncriminal  activity,  but many  informants  also  strongly  suggested \nthat the  only way  to  keep  their  cover  and  save  their  lives  was \nto  talk  as  if they  were  as  violent  as  the  klansmen  they  were \nassociating with. \nCOINTELPRO \nRowe  told  the  Senate  Select  Committee  on  Intelligence  in \n1975  that while  working  for  the- Bureau,  an  agent  he  believes \nto  be  Byron  McFall  told  him  that  the  FBI  had  \"declared war\" \non  the  klan.  Rowe  says  the  agent  used  the  word  COINTELPRO, \nand  instructed him  to  sleep with  klan wives,  foment  dissen-\nsion,  report  on  political  affiliations,  and  disrupt  political \ncampaigns.  Our1  investigation  indicated,  however,  that  the \nFBI  did  not  begin  the  COINTELPRO  program  against white  hate \ngroups  until  September  2,  1964,  well  after McFall  had  retired, \nand  only  six months  before  Rowe  ended  his  career  as  an \ninformant.  The  files  show  that  the  Birmingham  field  office \ninitiated only  two  COINTELPRO  actions  while  Rowe  was  an \ninformant,  and  they  consisted of  anonymous  mailings  to \nselected klansmen  and  did  not  involve  Rowe.  We  found  no \nevidence  that  the  Birmingham  field  off ice  ever  instructed \nRowe  or  any  other  informant  to  sleep with  klan wives  or  to \n\\ \n~ยท-, , \ndisrupt  political  campaigns. \n- 16  -\n\nIII.  HISTORICAL  BACKGROUND \nGary  Thomas  Rowe,  Jr.  worked  for  the  Federal  Bureau  of \nInvestigation  as  a  paid  informant  within the  ranks  of  the  Ku \nKlux  Klan  in  Birmingham,  Alabama,  from  1960  to  19,65.  These \nwere  critical years  for  the  civil  rights  movement,  especially \nin  Birmingham,  where  some  of  the  most  important  events  of \nthat era  transpired.  To  evaluate  properly  the  FBI's  handling \nof  Rowe,  one  must  understand  some  of  the  historical  forces \nat work  in  Birmingham  at this  time. \n\"The  hardest  problems  of  all  in  law  enforcement,\" \nAttorney  General  Robert  Kennedy  told his  audience,  \"are \nthose  involving  a  conflict of  law  and  local  custom.\"  The \noccasion was  Law  Day  exercises  at  the  University  of  Georgia \non  May  7,  1961,  the  week  Alan  Shepard  became  the  first \nAmerican  to  fly  in  space,  and  only  eight days  before  a  mob \nwould  attack  Freedom  Riders  at  the  Trailways  bus  station  in \nBirmingham.  Kennedy  was  using  the  forum  at  Law  Day  to make \na  major  policy  statement  of  the  Administration's  position on \ncivil  rights  issues.  [l] \nUnder  the  law,  the  Attorney  General's  options  were \nlimited.  Before  the  passage  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of \n1964,  the  federal  government  had  only  limited  jurisdiction \nover major  civil rights  grievances  - segregation  of  public \nfacilities  and  discrimination  in  employment  practices.  Only \nin  two  areas,  police  brutality  and  voter  intimidation,  was \nfederal  jurisdiction undisputed,  but  these  cases  proved \nenormously  difficult  to  prosecute. \n1.  New  York ยทTimes,  May  7,  1961. \n- 17  -\n\nThe  federal  statutes  covering  civil rights  violations \nand  police  brutality were  codified  in  Title  18,  United \nStates  Code,  Sections  241  and  242  -- laws  which  dated \nfrom  the  Reconstruction  Era  and  which  had  lain dormant  until \nthe  1940s.  Section  241  is  a  conspiracy  statute which  requires \nthe  government  to prove  that  two  or more  persons  conspired \nto  injure,  oppress,  threaten,  or  intimidate  any  citizen  in \nthe  free  exercise  of  his  civil  rights.  [2]  Federal  prosecu \ntors  discovered  that  it was  extremely  difficult to  convince \nhostile  juries that  the  accused  intended  not  only  to  inflict \nviolence,  but  also  to  deprive  the  victim of  his  constitu \ntional  rights.  Similar  problems  were  encountered  under \nSection  242,  which  applies  to  police  officers  and  persons \nacting  under  the  color of  law who  willfully  deprive  a  victim \nof  his  civil rights.  [3]  Between  January  1,  1958,  and  June \n30,  1960,  the  Justice  Department  received  1,328  complaints \nof  police  brutality,  of which  52  were  prosecuted,  resulting \nin  six  convictions. [4] \nThen  and  now,  primary  responsibility  for  prosecuting \nthose  accused  of  doing  violence  lay  with  state and  local \nauthorities.  Short  of  nationalizing  the  National  Guard  and \nestablishing  a  kind  of military occupation of  the  South,  as \nthe  President  can  do  under  Titles  3  and  10  of  the  United \nu.s.c. \n2.  18  241  (1948). \nu.s.c. \n3.  18  242  (1948). \n4.  United  States  Commission  of  Civil  Rights,  Justice  (1961). \n~.   - 18  -\n\nStates  Code  in  cases  of  domestic  violence  and  insurrection[S], \nthe  most  effective  course  of  action  open  to  the  federal \ngovernment  was  to  apply  pressure,  through  the  federal  courts, \nupon  state  and  local  authorities  to  force  them  tq  execute \ntheir  sworn  duties,  and  to  enforce  their own  laws  in  accordance \nwith  the  United  States  Constitution. [6] \nIn  his  speech  at  the  University  of  Georgia,  Attorney \nGeneral  Kennedy  stressed  that  the  Justice  Department  would \npromote  racial  equality,  first  through  mediation  designed  to \nreach  voluntary  compliance,  and  then  when  necessary,  through \nthe  courts  to  enforce  existing  statutes,  particularly  those \nrelating  to  voting  rights.  The  policy was  conceived with \nan  eye  on  past  history,  particularly  the  Reconstruction  Era, \nwherein  gains  made  by  blacks  through  force  of  northern  arms \nwere  lost when  northern  troops  left.  There  was  a  conviction \nwithin  the  Department,  strongly  held  by  Burke  Marshall, \nAssistant  Attorney  General  for  Civil  Rights,  that  the  emphasis \nought  to  be  on  achieving  results  through  processes  within \nthe  state  and  local  institutions,  and  with  a  minimum  of \nfederal  force.  In  that  regard,  the  Kennedy  Administration \nplaced  a  high  priority on  the  enfranchisement  of  black \n5 โข  10  U. S . C.  3 31,  3 3 2 ,  and  3 3 3 โข  3  U. S . C.  301. \n6.

[7]  It was  clear  that  no  one  in the  administration \nwanted  to  develop  a  federal  police  force  to  enforce  civil \nrights,  which  in  any  event  would  have  been  impractical  and \ncertainly would  have  set a  dangerous  precedent.  rs]  The \ncivil  rights  movement  and  the  development  of  confrontation \npolitics  soon  forced  the  hand  of  the  federal  government  in  a \nnumber  of  crisis  situations.  But  it is  important  to  remember \nthat  in  the  period  from  1960  to  1964,  neither  the  Justice \nDepartment  nor  its Bureau  of  Investigation  saw  itself as \nthe  South's  policemen. \nThe  FBI  viewed  its role  in  these  matters  primarily  as \nan  intelligence  gathering  operation.  When  violent  confronta-\ntions  broke  out  between  demonstrators  and  their opponents, \nthe  Bureau  maintained  that  it had  no  police  or  arrest \npowers  in  such  situations  and  that  its proper  role \nwas  to  provide  information  about  planned  violence  to  the \nDepartment  of  Justice  and  the  local  authorities,ยท who  had  the \nlegal  obligation  to  act.  Moreover,  in  those  situations \nrequiring  a  federal  presence  to quell  disturbances,  the \nproper  forces  to  serve  that  function  under  the  Constitution \nwere  the  United  States  Marshals  or  the  National  Guard.

Adams). \n- 20  -\n\nAs  for  the  klan,  the  FBI  believed  that  it was  necessary \nto  use  informants  from  within  to  ascertain  its plans  for \ncriminal  activity,  and  in  addition,  to  disrupt  and  neutra-\nlize  the  organization.  The  Bureau  tried to  do  this  by \n( \ncreating uncertainty  and  distrust among  klansmen  and  by  making \nthe  klan  know  that  the  government  had  penetrated  its ranks. [10] \nThe  FBI  has  acknowledged  that  in  some  instances  it exceeded \nits authority  by  pursuing  these  tactics.  [11] \nIn  1965,  at the  height  of  the  Bureau's  intelligence \noperation  against  the  klan,  approximately  six percent  of  the \ntotal  klan membership  were  acting  as  FBI  informants. [12] \nGary  Thomas  Rowe,  Jr.,  was  recruited  in  the  Spring  of \n1960,  when  Special  Agent  Barrett  Kemp  asked  him  to  join  the \nEastview  13  \"Klavern\"  (local  chapter),  considered  one  of  the \nmost  violent  in Alabama.  When  Birmingham  became  a  major \nfocal  point  for  the  civil  rights  struggle,  Rowe  soon  became \nan  extremely  valuable  informant  in  the  Bureau  network.  With \na  population  of  340,000,  Birmingham was  one  of  the  South's \nlargest cities,  and  the  major  industrial  center  for. that \nregion.  Public  facilities  were  thoroughly  segregated,  and \nmost  of  the  city's  140,000  blacks  were  confined  to menial, \nlow-paying  jobs.  Since  few  blacks  were  able  to  overcome  the \nobstacles  of  voter  registration,  they  had  no  political \npower. \n10.  Id.,  144-45. \n11.  Id.,  143. \n12.  Id.,  144. \n- 21  -\n\nIn  December  1960,  the  Supreme  Court  handed  down  its \ndecision  in  Boynton  v.  Virginia  [13],  ruling  that  racial  seg \nregation  in  terminals  and  stations  serving  interstate bus \nand  rail  traffic was  unconstitutional.  Legal  sc4olars  were \nenthusiastic,  but,  as  a  practical matter,  there was  little \nvoluntary  compliance  in the  Sou~h. \nThe  Congress  of  Racial  Equality  (CORE),  under  the \nleadership  of  James  Farmer,  decided  to  dramatize  the  continu \ning  practice  of  segregation  by  sponsoring  interracial  \"Free \ndom  Rides\"  on  regularly  scheduled  bus  routes  through  the \nSouth.  Two  of  these  buses,  travelling west  from  Atlanta, \nentered Alabama  on  May  14,  1961.  A mob  stopped  and  attacked \nthe  first on  a  highway  outside  of  Anniston,  60  miles  east of \nBirmingham,  and  left it gutted by  a  fire  bomb.  The  second \nmade  it to  the  Trailways  station  in  Birmingham,  where  another \nmob  set upon  the  riders with  chains  and  lead  pipes,  sending \nmany  to  the  hospital.  On  May  19th,  a  club  swinging  crowd \ngreeted  still another  bus  in Montgomery  and  brutalized  its \nriders.  [14]  Local  ambulances  refused  to  carry  the  injured \nto  the  hospital. [15] \nPhotographs  of  the  flaming  bus  and  the  bleeding  freedom \nriders  were  widely  publicized  by  the  national  news  media, \nand,  for  many  people,  the  violence was  the  first  evidence  of \nthe  impending  racial  crisis.

Guthman,  We  Band  of  Brothers,  171  (1971). \n- 22  -\n\nnews  accounts  were  stories  that  local  civil  and  police \nauthorities  in all  three  cities  had  done  nothing  to  prevent \nthe mob  violence,  despite  having  known  about  it in  advance.  [16] \nDuring  the  remainder  of  1961  and  1962,  the  focus  of \nf \nnational  attention  shifted  to  places  like  Oxford,  Mississippi, \nwhere  James  Meredith  was  enrolled  in  the  University  of  Missis-\nsippi with  an  escort  of  hundreds  of  federal  marshals,  and  to \nAlbany,  Georgia,  where  Dr.  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.  was \ndeveloping  confrontation  politics  on  a  much  larger  and  more \neffective  scale.  Using  Gandhian  tactics,  King  and  his \nfollowers  willingly  submitted  to  arrest  and  abuse,  to  dram-\natize  both  the  inequities  they  suffered  and  the  unwillingness \nof  some  whites  to  submit  to  change. [17] \nA  Gallup  poll  taken  on  June  16,  1963,  on  the  question \nof whether  Kennedy  was  \"pushing  racial  integration  too  fast \nor  not  fast  enough\"  showed  36  percent  answering  \"too  fast\", \n18  percent  \"not  fast  enough\",  32  percent  \"about  right\",  and \n14  percent with  no  opinion.  Thus,  there was  not  yet  sufficient \nsupport  for  the  civil rights  legislation President  Kennedy \nasked  for  on  June  11th,  the  day  Governor  George  C.  Wallace \nstood  in  the  door  at the  University  of  Alabama.  On  June  27th, \nthe  Secretary of  the  Senate,  Robert  (Bobby)  Baker,  reported \nto  Majority  Leader  Mike  Mansfield  that  \"it is virtually \nimpossible  to  secure  51  Senators  who  will  vote  for  the  President's \n16.

Fred  Shuttlesworth  of  Birmingham  planned  a  .civil  rights \nf \ncampaign  for  that  city based  on  the  tactics  developed  in \nAlbany.  They  identified  segregated  lunch  counters  and \ndepartment  stores  as  targets  for  demonstrations,  and  raised \nsums  of money  for  bail. [19]  In  the  spring  of  1963,  King  and \nShuttlesworth  launched  a  series  of  daily marches,  sit-ins, \npray-ins,  and  boycotts  of  downtown  stores.  The  City  obtained \nan  injunction  in  the  State  court  against  the  demonstrations, \nwhich  King  ignored,  resulting  in his  imprisonment.  He  used \nthe  opportunity  to  write  his  famous  \"Letter  from  Birmingham \nJail\",  in which  he  stated that  his  purpose  was  \"to  create  a \nsituation  so  crisis-packed  that  it will  inevitably open  the \ndoor  to  negotiations\",  and  justified his  tactics with  an \nappeal  to  \"man's  moral  responsibility  to  disobey  unjust \nlaws\". [20] \nSoon,  the  City  found  itself running  out  of  places  to \nput  the  demonstrators  it had  arrested,  and  the  Director  of \nPublic  Safety,  Eugene  \"Bull\"  Connor,  changed  his  tactics.  On \nMay  3rd,  his  police  stopped  arresting demonstrators  and \nconcentrated on  repulsing  them.  That  day,  the  nation watched \non  the  evening  news  films  of  Bull  Connor's  police  dogs, \n18.  Note  from  Bobby  Baker  to  Mike  Mansfield,  June  27,  1963, \n.JFK  Papers. \n19.

[21] \nThroughout  the  highly  publicized violence,  however, \nKing's  coalition was  holding  secret meetings  a  newly-\nwi~h \nelected  city  leadership,  considered moderate  compared  to  the \nsegregationist  City  Commission  it had  replaced.  And  on  May \n10th,  the  negotiators  went  public  and  announced  an  agreement \nto end  the  crisis whereby  lunch  counters  and  public  facilities \nwould  be  desegregated within  ninety  days,  and  regular  lines \nof  communication  would  be  established with  the  black  com-\nmunity. [22]  Members  of  the  old  City  Commission,  speaking \nfor  a  substantial  portion of  the  white  community,  immediately \ndenounced  the  agreement  and  branded  it a  cowardly  capitulation \nto  rabble  rousers.  [23] \nThe  evening  after  the  agreement  was  announced,  the  Ku \nKlux  Klan  held  a  rally  in  a  local  park.  It was  followed  by \na  dynamite  bomb  explosion  at  the  home  of  Rev.  A.D.W.  King, \nthe  brother of  Martin  Luther  King,  and  shortly  thereafter, \nanother  bomb  exploded  at  the  A.G.  Gaston  Motel,  which  had \nbeen  a  headquarters  for  the  movement.  The  bombings  set off \nriots  in  the  black  neighborhoods,  where  police  cars  and \nfiretrucks  were  stoned. \nConcerned  that  these  events  would  destroy  the  criti-\ncally  important  precedent  of  a  negotiated  settlement, \n21.

He  warned  that  the  federal  government  wo.uld  \"not \nt \npermit  it to  be  sabotaged  by  a  few  extremists  on  either side \nwho  think  they  can  defy  both  the  law  and  the  wishes  of \nresponsible  citizens  by  inciting or  inviting violence\".  [24] \nThe  President's  concern  was  well  founded,  for  the  bomb-\nings  in  Birmingham  did  not  begin  nor  end with  the  two  that \nexploded  on  May  11,  1963.  The  City  had  been  plagued  by \nracially motivated  bombings  since  the  mid-1950's,  events  so \ncommon  that  a  middle-class  black  neighborhood  came  to  be \nknown  as  Dynamite  Hill.  Between  1956  and  the  end  of  1963, \nthere were  at  least twenty-two  bombings  of  black  homes  and \nchurches  in  Birmingham,  most  of which  remain  unsolved. \nDecember,  1956  - home  of  the  Rev.

It is  in \nthis  context  that  one  must  evaluate  the  Bureau's  use  of \ninformants,  and  of  Gary  Thomas  Rowe,  Jr. \nOne  perspective  on  the  era.may  be  found  in  this  state-\nment  by  an  agent  who  was  assigned  to  Birmingham when  many  of \nthese  events  occurred: \nI'm thinking  of  the  Rev.  Shuttlesworth's \nchurch  on  Christmas  Eve,  blown  so  that  there's \nnothing  left but  the  peak  of  the  roof,  and  an \nangry  mob,  when  Fred  crawls  out what's  left of \nthe  rosette window  and  says,  'Everybody  calm \ndown.  That  one  didn't have  my  name  on  it.' \nI  mean  those  are  the  incredible  things, \nokay?  And  our  efforts  to  neutralize  a  group \nof  folks  who  were  given  to  that kind  of  activity \nwas  what  those  four  or  five  years  in  Birmingham, \nAlabama  were  all  about.  And,  we  wouldn't  have \ndone  it without  guys  like  Tommy  Rowe. \n*  *  * \nYou  know,  there  was  no  thrust  anywhere \nabout  this  -- we  weren't  exactly  stumbling  around \nin  the  dark,  but we  had  precious  little direction \nto  add  a  federal  layer of  investigative  force  to \nproblems  that we  had  never  encountered  before. \nWho  ever encountered  the  street demonstration \nbefore  Little  Rock  in  1957?  None,  to my  know \nledge. \nYou  know,  how  do  you  cope  with  -- nobody \never  saw  that before  -- 2,000  people  gathered \n- 28  -\n\ntogether  in  a  corrunon  cause  and  sit down  ... \nin  a  major  city  and  block  four  intersections \nat  one  time.  โข  โข  โข  And  thus  crops  up  Bull  Connor,  who \narrests  a  couple  of  hundred  kids  the  same  day  and \nhas  nothing  to  do  with  them,  so  he  lines. them  up \nin  columns  of  fours  and  double-times  them  from \ndowntown  Birmingham  to  the  fairgrounds:  that's \ngoing  to  be  the  compound:  and  they  put  them 1all \nunder  arrest  in  the  Alabama  State  Fairgrounds. \nAnd  then  they  set up  tables  and  bond  them  out, \nand  they  end  up  in  our  files. \nI  mean,  those  things  happened.  Those  were \nthe  difficult problems.  We  were  all  learning,  we \nwere  all going  to  school  on  this  stuff  as  we \nwent.  [27] \n27.  Neil  P.

BECOMES  AN  INFORMANT \nGary  Thomas  Rowe,  Jr.,  was  27  years  old  and  working  at \na  dairy when  the  FBI  first  contacted  him.  [l]  The  occasion, \nironically,  was  a  routine  investigation by  the  Bur~au of  a \nreport  that  someone  had  been  in  a  bar  impersonating  an  FBI \nagent.  It was  Rowe. [2] \nThe  time  was  early  April  1960,  and  Clarence  Kelley,  now \nretired Director  of  the  FBI,  was  the  Special  Agent  in  Charge \n(SAC)  of  the  Birmingham  field office.  Since  the  case  was \nrelatively minor,  he  assigned  it to  a  young  agent  named \nBarrett  Kemp,  not  six months  out  of  the  FBI  training  acad-\nemy. [3]  Kemp  tracked  down  Rowe  and  found  that  the \nyoung  dairy worker  had  merely  been  trying  to  impress  someone \nsitting next  to  him  at  the  bar.  Kemp  \"read  him  the  riot \nact,\"  reminding  him  that what  he  had  done  was  a  punishable \noffense,  and  then  took  down  some  background  information  to \nassure  Rowe  that he  was  serious. [4]  Kemp  observed: \nHe  was  a  frustrated,  undereducated  indi \nvidual.  He  never  graduated  from  high  school, \nif I  recall  properly.  From  Savannah,  Georgia. \nHis  parents  apparently  still lived  there  at \nthat  time.  He  was  married,  and  had  a  couple \nchildren.  And  he  attempted  to  get on  the \nBirmingham  Police  Department.  That  is what  he \ntold me.  But  he  was  turned  down  because  he \ndidn't have  the  education.  He  said,  \"I have \nalways  been  involved  in  law  enforcement,  wanted \n1.  .Memorandum  from  BH  SAC  to  Director,  Nov.  5,  1960;  HQ \n137-6295-2;  Task  Force  235.

I  even \nride  around  town  occasionally with  some  of \nthese  officers  because  we're  friends.  [5] \nIn  the  weeks  following  this  encounter,  Special  Agent \nKemp  dropped  in on  Rowe  several  times,  partly  to  assure \n1\nhimself  that  Rowe  was  not  repeating  his  mistake,  but  also  to \nsee  if Rowe's  interest  in  law  enforcement  was  genuine.  Al-\nthough  Rowe's  views  on  race  were  not  extreme,  Kemp  learned \nfrom  their  conversations  that  some  of  Rowe's  drinking  bud-\ndies  at the  VFW  Club  had  approached  him  several  times  about \njoining the  klan.  At  this  point,  Kemp  began  to  consider  the \npossibility of  using  Rowe  as  an  informant.  [6] \nFollowing  Bureau  policy,  the  agent  began  a  thorough \nbackground  investigation of  Rowe.  He  discovered,  among \nother  things,  that  at age  14,  Rowe  had  enlisted in  the \nGeorgia  National  Guard,  perhaps  relying on  his  5'  11\"  height \nand  muscular  build  to  cover  the  extra  three  years  he  gave \nhimself  on  his  application.  [7]  After  an  honorable  dis-\nu. \ncharge  in 1950,  he  enlisted  in  the  S.  Marine  Corps \nReserves,  serving  as  an  infantryman  until  1957.  [8]  He \nserved  both  these  tours  in  reserve  duty  status with  only \nshort  periods  of  active  duty  for  training. \n5.  Id. \n6.  Id.,  6-11.

The  FBI's  background  investigation  turned  up  little \ninformation  about  his  childhood  or  family.  He  d~opped out \n( \nof  school  in  the  eighth  grade,  and  as  a  young  adult,  he  held \na  variety of  jobs,  including  ambulance  driving,  a  job  he \nlost  for  carrying  unauthorized  passengers.  He  had  a  scrape \nwith  the  law  at  age  18,  when  the  Savannah  police  arrested \nhim  for  carrying  a  pistol without  a  permit.  He  was  later \nacquitted. [9]  In  late  1951,  he  married  and  was  divorced  in \nless  than  a  year.  About  a  year  later,  he  married  again. \n[10]  After moving  to  Birmingham,  Rowe  worked various  jobs \nincluding  a  dairy  as  a  machinist,  where  he  worked  through \n1964. \nKemp  discovered  from  county  court  records  that  Rowe  had \nbeen  arrested  at  a  bar  in  Birmingham on  September  21,  1956, \nfor  impersonating .a  police  officer,  and  fined  $30.  When \nasked  about  this,  Rowe  told  Kemp  that  the  bar  owner  who \naccused  him  was  lying. [11] \nFinding  nothing  in his  background  check  that would  dis-\nqualify  Rowe,  Kemp  approached  him  one  day  about  becoming  an \ninformant: \n9.  Id.,  236.  United  States  v.

We  took  off  and  had  a  nice  long  ride, \nParked  out  in  a  residential  area  and  talked.  And, \nI  made  a  pass  at him  relative  to  the  klan,  whether \nhe'd be  interested. \nHe  said,  \"I  don't  know. \"  He  said,  \"I  ljeally \ndon't  know.\"  He  was  sort of  negative. \nI  said,  \"Well,  I'll tell you  what.  I'd have \nto  get  clearance,  but  I  can  pay  your  membership \nfees  and  if you  need  a  robe,  I  could  probably  defer \nthat  expense--defray  that  expense,  and  you  will \nnot  have  to  be  out  of  pocket,  but we  might  need \nsome  information.  You  think  about  it.\" \n\"Hey,  I  jtist don't  think  I  want  to  get \ninvolved  in  that.\"  And, .that was  his  first  reac \ntion. \nI  think  probably  it was  a  few  days  later  that \nhe  called the  office  and  told me  he  wanted  to  see \nme.  And .I  went  out  and  met  him,  and,  \"Yes,  I'll \ndo  it.\"  At  that  particular point--this  is when  we \nopened  an  informant  file,  I  guess,  and  got  clear \nance  from  the  boss  to  do  it,  to  try him  out  to  see \nwhether  it was  going  to  help.  [12] \nThe  field  office opened  his  informant  file  on  April  18, \n1960.  [13]  A  few  weeks  later,  Rowe  contacted his  friend  at \nthe  VFW  Club,  and  after waiting  for  a  background  check \nby  the  \"Klan  Bureau  of  Investigation\",  was  formally  initiated \ninto  the  Eastview  13  Klavern  of  the  Alabama  Knights,  Knights \nof  the  Ku  Klux  Klan,  Inc.  on  June  23,  1960.

It would \nf \n1  appear  tihat  this  information  should  have  been  considered  in \norder  to  assess  Rowe's  stability  and  reliability. \nThe  field  off ices  had  been  admonished  by  Headquarters \nabout  this  very  problem  not  five  months  before: \nRACIAL  INFORMANT  PROGRAM  - In  one  of \nour  Southern  offices  recently,  a  discontinued \npotential  informant  on  Klan  matters  misrep \nresented  himself  as  a  former  FBI  agent  while \ntestifying  in  a  child custody  hearing.  Al \nthough  he  had  operated  as  a  potential  infor \nmant  for  only  a  few  months  and  had  been \ndiscontinued  for  some  time,  this  situation \nagain  points  up  the  need  for  thorough,  in \ntensive  background  investigation and  careful \npersonal  scrutiny  of  such  individuals.  Your \nattention  is  again  directed  to  the  need  of \npreventing  the  development  of  an  individual \nas  a  potential  racial  informant  who  may \npossess  some  weakness  as  to  stability and \nreliability.  [16]  ยท \nNonetheless,  the  Bureau  did  not  hastily  rush  into \nmaking  Rowe  an  informant.  From  May  until  November  16,  1960, \nwhen  the  field office  completed  his  background  check,  [17] \nBirmingham was  authorized  only  to  accept  information  Rowe \n15.

[18] \nRowe  began  playing  the  role  of  a  conscientious  klansman, \n( \narriving each  Thursday  night  at  the  klavern's  second  story \nhall  above  Morgan's  Furniture  Store  in  Northeast  Birmingham. \n[19]  After  each  meeting,  he  wrote  a  report  of  his  observations \nusing  the  code  name,  Karl  Cross,  [20]  and  mailed  it to  a \nblind  post  office  box  assigned  to  him  by  Agent  Kemp. \nRowe's  early reports  reflect  the  number  of  persons  in \nattendance,  and  the  bombast  in which  the  klansmen  warmed \nthemselves  each week,  but  very  little in  the  way  of  planned \nor  prior violence.  Later,  Rowe  learned  that  the  hard  busi-\nness  of  the  klan was  plotted  in  small  sessions,  closed  to \nthe  general  membership,  by  only  a  handful  of  trusted  Klans-\nmen.  [21]  As  described  in  Rowe's  weekly  reports,  the  open \nmeetings  do,  however,  reveal  the  state of mind  which  ultimately \nproduced  the  Birmingham  bombings  of  the  1960's.

He  was  given  his  membership  by  Mrs.  Franklin \nRoosevelt's  son.  They  we,re  all  at  a  dinner  given \nfor  Sen.  Kennedy.  Klansman  Donaldson  got  up.,  and \nsaid  that  there  was  two  good  ways  to  stop  th'e  damn \ncommunist.  That was  to  get  someone  to  fill his \nface  full  of  acid  or  to  use  one  of  the  guns  that \nthey  had  dry  rotting  to  shoot  him  with.  There  was \na  very  loud  applause  for  him.  [22] \nROWE  ADVANCES  IN  THE  KLAN \nOn  August  18,  1960,  the  klavern  held  an  election  to \nfill  the  vacant  post  of  Night-Hawk  In-Chief,  a  time-consuming \njob  that  no  one  wanted. [23]  Two  klansmen  had  already  declined \nnomination  before  a  friend  put  Tommy  Rowe's  name  into  consider-\nation,  and  when  Rowe  told  them  he  was  willing  to  take  it, \nhe  was  elected by  acclamation.  [24] \nIt was  an  important  turn  of  events,  because  the  Night-\nHawk  was  responsible  for  investigating all new  applicants  to \nthe  klavern,  and  as  an  officer,  he  was  included  in  its  inner \nI \ncircle.  [25]  Later  that  evening,  Rowe  put  the  news  into  his \nreport  to  Kemp,  concluding with  the  wry  admonition,  \"I \nsuggest  that you  watch  this  fellow,  Tommy,  because  he  is  in \ncomplete  charge  of  security  for  the  klavern.\"[26] \n22.

It \nwas  indicated  that  $4,811.00  had  been  spent  by \nEastview klavern  during  the  calendar year  1960; \nthat  the  treasury  had  $700.00  remaining  after \nall expenses  were  paid. \nBy  written  report,  on  February  1,  1961, \ninformant  furnished  the  names  of  the  newly \nelected  State  officers  and  the  men  in  attendance \nat the  State meeting  held  at  Eastview  Klavern \n13,  on  January  28,  1961,  at Birmingham. \nOn  February  1,  1961,  informant  orally \nadvised  that  ROBERT  SHELTON,  Imperial  Wizard \n- 37  -\n\nof  THE  ALABAMA  KNIGHTS,  KKKK,  INC.,  was  estab -\nlishing  a  system  of  degrees  for  klansmen.  The \nnames  of  all  the  degrees  are  not  presently \nknown,  but  Second  Degree  Klansmen  will  be  known \nas  \"Knights  of  the  Great  Forest\".  Certain \nfunctions  and  duties  will  be  required  of  all \nmembers  attempting  to  obtain  a  higher  degre~ \nwithin  each  local  klavern. \nr \nInformant  has  furnished  information  on \napproximately  55  members  of  Eastview  Klavern  13, \nTHE  ALABAMA  KNIGHTS,  KKKK,  INC.,  including  all \nthe  officers  of  that  Klavern.  In  addition,  he \nhas  furnished  information  regarding  ROBERT \nSHELTON,  Imperial  Wizard  of  THE  ALABAMA  KNIGHTS, \nKKKK,  INC.,  and  information  regarding  officers \nand  members  of  other  Klaverns  in  the  Birmingham \narea. \nSince  his  election  to  the  off ice  of  Investi \ngator  for  Eastview  Klavern  13,  he  has  furnished \nthe  names  of  applicants  and  all new  members \ncoming  into  that  klavern.  [27] \nThe  Bureau  paid  Rowe  $155  for  this  information,  and  $57.66 \nfor  his  related expenses.  [28] \nRowe's  development  as  an  informant  coincided with \na  decision  by  the  FBI's  leadership  to  increase  coverage  of \nthe  newly  resurgent  klan.  In  a  memorandum  to  all  FBI  field \noffices  in the  South  on  January  5, .1961,  the  Director  noted \nthat,  with  the  increased  number  of  school  desegregation  law-\nsuits,  \"it may  be  expected  that  the  membership  and  activities \nof  klan  and  related  organizations  in  these  areas  will  increase \nduring  the  next  year,\"  and  he  directed  those  offices  \"to \nremain  constantly  alert  to  indications  of  a  widening  of  the \nactivities  or membership  of  such  groups.\"  He  emphasized \n27.

Every  effort must  be  expended \nto  increase  this  coverage.  [30] \nGUIDANCE  AND  -CONTROL  OF  ROWE \nFollowing  FBI  instructions  regarding  potential  informants, \n[31]  Kemp  warned  Rowe  frequently  that his  cooperation wit~ \nthe  Bureau was  voluntary  and  confidential,  and  that  he  could \nin no  way  consider.himself  to be  an  FBI  employee.  Kemp \nfurther  explained  that  the  Bureau was  willing to  buy  informa-\ntion  from  him  on  a  COD  basis,  but he  should  not  assume  that \nthe  Bureau was  paying  him  a  salary.  [32] \nNevertheless,  Rowe  somehow  developed  a  more  romantic \nconception  of  his  own  role,  which  he  described  in  a  Task \nForce  interview: \n29.ยท  Memorandum  from  Director  to  BH  SAC,  Jan.

I  knew  what  my  position was. \nQuestion:  What  was  your  position? \nMr.  Rowe:  To  quote  him,  'an  undercover  agent'. \nQuestion:  To  quote  who? \nMr.  Rowe:  To  quote  Kemp. \nQuestion:  And  did  the  FBI  issue  you  any  kind \nof  identification papers? \nMr.  Rowe :  No,  no. \nQuestion:  So  you  just considered  yourself \nan  undercover  agent  for  the  FBI? \nMr.  Rowe:  That's  correct.  The  difference \nbeing was  this,  okay?  The  difference  being, \nthen,  the  word  \"informant\"  was  a  bad  word  to me, \napparently  a  bad  word  to  them.  An  informant  is \na  man  that  picks  up  the  telephone  at  3:00. in \nthe  morning  and  calls you  and  says,  'Hey,  I  got \nsome  information  for  you.  For  $100,  $25,  you \ncan  have  it.'  That's  an  informant,  to me .... \nQuestion:  So  you  prefer  to  be  called an \nundercover  agent. \nMr.  Rowe:  I  prefer  to  be  what  I  was.  I \nwas  given  an  assi~nment, and  told  to  go  infil \ntrate an  organization.  That's  what  I  was  told \nto  do. \nQuestion:  So,  Mr.  Rowe,  you  considered \nyourself  an  undercover  agent  for  the  FBI? \nMr.  Rowe:  Absolutely.  ,C3  3] \nThus,  there  seems  to  have  been  some  confusion  between \nRowe  and  Kemp  on  this  question.

This  is  the \nconundrum which  faced  every  informant,  including  Rowe,  who \nwished  to  penetrate  the  inner  circles  of  the  klan  in  the \n1960's. \nKemp  insists  that he  warned  Rowe  repeatedly  not  to  get \ninvolved  in  any  violence  whatsoever,  and  told him  that  the \nBureau,  if he  did  get  involved,  would  disown  him  and  treat \nhim  like  an  ordinary  criminal. [35]  He  says  he  can  remember \nonly  two  occasions  when  Rowe  admitted  he  was  violent: \nharassing  an  interracial  couple  while  night  riding with \nklansmen,  and  attacking  a  newsman  at the  Trailways  bus \nstation  in  May  1961.  [36]  Rowe  insists,  however,  that  he \ntook  part  in many  more  beatings  during  this  period,  partic-\nularly of  those  who  tried to  integrate  the  local  buses  and \ndowntown  department  stores,  and  that he  reported  this \nactivity  to  Kemp,  usually  in writing.

The  Task  Force  does  have  evidence  that  Rowe  beat  up \nfreedom  riders  at  the  Trailways  station on  May  14 ,  1961,  and \n1\nwe  shall  examine  this  incident  below.  But  before  Trailways, \nFBI  files  indicate  Rowe  reported he  was  involved  in violence \non  only  one  other  occasion.  There  is  no  indication  that  any \nof  Rowe's  reports  from  this  period  are  missing. \nThe  one  reported  episode  occurred  on  April  6,  1961. \nRowe  reported  that  a  klansman  called him  out  of  a  regular \nEastview  13  meeting  one  night  and  asked  him  to move  some \nheavy  equipment.  [38]  .He  walked  outside  and  was  told  to \njoin about  thirteen other  klansmen  on  a  trip to  a  farmhouse \nin  Odenville,  Alabama.  .They  had  just  learned  that  a  white \ncouple  by  the  name  of  Forman  was  raising  a  black  child;  they \nplanned  to  do  something  about  it.  When  Mr.  Forman,  then  69, \ncame  to  the  door,  two  klansmen  tried to  throw  a  sheet over \nhis  head,  Rowe  reported,  but were  unable  to  grab  him  even \nthough  he  was  very  short,  about  five  feet  four  inches.

A young \nklansman  pulled  his  .22,  and  the  66  year  old  Mrs.  Forman, \nfearing  for  her  family,  fired.  Some  of  the  klansmen  returned \nf \nfire,  and  then  scattered  into  the  woods.  [40]  One  fell  into \na  ravine,  injuring  his  kneecap,  and  several  others  stumbled \nthrough  the  woods  and  emerged  bruised  and  scratched,  but \nnone  of  Mrs.  Forman's  shots  hit anyone.  [41] \nThe  Bureau  interviewed  the  Formans,  and  their  story \nconfirmed  Rowe's  report.  [42]  But  nothing  in  the  file  indi-\ncates  he  took  part  in  the  attempted  assault  other  than \ndriving  out  to  the  house  with  the  other klansmen.  In  our \nFebruary  21st  interview,  however,  Rowe  said  he  was  the  one \nwho  tried to  throw  the  sheet  over  Mr.  Forman's  head.  [43] \nThe  next  day  the  Birmingham  SAC  did  inform Headquarters \nof  the  incident  as  Rowe  had  reported  it,  [44]  again  on \n~nd \nApril  11,  1961,  reported  that: \n[Rowe]  has  been  advised  in  the  past  and  again \non  April  10th  to  attempt  to  avoid  any  incident \ninvolving  violence,  and  that  if he  is  involved, \nhe  does  so  at his  own  risk.

[45] \nThe  Birmingham  office  also  informed  the  St.  Clair  County \nSheriff's office of  the  Forman  incident,  without iexposing \nRowe,  of  course.  [46] \n-\nIt is difficult  to  evaluate  Rowe's  claim  that he  told \nthe  Bureau  about  his  beating  up  blacks  and  civil rights \nactivists  in  city buses  and  downtown  department  stores. \n[47]  When  Rowe  first reported  on  the  city bus  situation,  he \nmaintained  he  was  effective  in  preventing  violence.  At \na  klavern meeting  on  August  3,  1961,  a  klansman  named  King, \nwho  happened  to  be  the  father  of  a  bus  driver,  took  the \nfloor  and  urged  the  other klansmen  to  help  throw  the  blacks \noff  the  buses.  Rowe  reportedly  told the  klansmen  that  they \nwould  get  arrested  and  lose  their  jobs  if they  tried this, \nand  that  the  bus  drivers  should  handle  their own  problems. \nRowe  described what  happened  next: \nSo  then  KING  got  back  up  and  stated  that  he \nhad  be  [sic]  in  the  KLAN  for  over  ten  years,  and \nhe  felt  like  the  law was  wrong  and  he  pleaded \nfor  the men  to  take  the  law  in  there  [sic]  own \nhands  and  put  a  stop  to  the  bus  situation once \nand  for  all.  So  ROWE  got  back  up  and  said  that \nhe  was  not  going  to  take  the  law  in  his  hands; \nthat we  had  a  good  judge  at City  Hall  to  handle \nsuch  cases,  and  then  if that  failed  and  every \nthing  else  failed  they  might  see  about  it, but \nhe  felt  like  KING  only  came  to  the  meeting \nbecause  his  son  was  involved,  that he  had  only \n45.

So  then \nsome  of  the  other  Klansmen  stated  that  ROWE  had \na  pertty  [sic]  good  reason  for  not  wanting  to \nhandle  the  case,  and  they  were  not  either. [48] \nOn  August  30,  1960,  Rowe  told  Kemp  that the  klan wanted \nhim  to  buy  a  two  foot  long  baseball  bat  and  to  d~liver it to \nanother  klansman  for  modification.  At  a  klavern  meeting  one \nweek  later,  the  bat was  returned  to  Rowe,  loaded with  four \nto  five  ounces  of  lead,  and  plugged  and  varnished  at the \nend.  He  saw  about  one  hundred  similar bats  stored  in  a  box \nat  the  klavern  hall.  [49]  There  the  Grand  Titan,  regional \nleader  for  Northern  Alabama,  Hubert  Page,  told  the  klansmen \nthat he  did  not  think  the  law was  doing  enough  about  blacks \nriding on  buses  and  sitting down  at  lunch  counters.  Page \nsaid  the  klan  would  \"strike  down  at  the  niggers\"  to make \nthem  think  twice  before  sitting in the  front  of  buses.  [50] \nAs  Page  described  it,  klan  leadership planned  to mobilize \nsevera.l  hundred  klansmen  from  all over  Birmingham  to  ride \nthe  city buses  on  a  particular day  and  to  attack  any  black \nsitting out  of  place,  using  the  leaded  bats,  bicycle  chains, \nand  blackjacks.

A different  informant \nfrom  the  Bessemer  klavern  reported  hearing  the  plan  dis-\ncussed  at  a  September  16th meeting.  They  were  nqt  to  act \nuntil  \"the  way  was  clear\"  [53];  however,  an  October  22nd \nFBI  report  showed  klan  leaders  had  still not  scheduled \nWholesale  Day  as  of  that date.  [54]  This  is  the  last  ref-\nerence  to  the  operation  in  FBI  files.  When  Rowe  first \nreported  the  plan  to  his  handling  agent  on  August  25th, \nBirmingham  passed  it on  to  Headquarters  and  local military \nintelligence  offices  according  to  routine  procedure.  [55] \nHad  Rowe  informed  the  Bureau  in  advance  of  a  planned  date, \nit seems  likely  that the  Bureau  would  likewise  have ยทpassed \nit on  and made  a  record  of  it. \nRowe  did  advise  the  FBI  that  the  klan  planned  to move \nviolently  against  department  store  pickets  in  a  December  15, \n1960  report: \nThey  are  still looking  for  a  big  picket \ngroup  before  Christmas  at  the  larger  stores  in \nBirmingham,  Montgomery,  Anniston,  Mobile,  and \nTuscaloosa,  Alabama.

There  is  no  mention \noth~r \nof  this  plan  in  the  FBI  files. \nOf  course,  it is  possible  that  Rowe  informed  Kemp \norally  about  the  beatings,  and  Kemp  neglected  to  put  the  in \nformation  in  FBI  files.  This  seems  to  have  happened  in  the \nTrailways  bus  station  incident,  which  we  will  examine  next. \n- 47  -\n\nV.  INCIDENT  AT  THE  TRAILWAYS  BUS  STATION \nMAY  _14,  1961 \nThe  attack  on  the  Freedom  Riders  at the  Trailways  bus \nstation in Birmingham  on  May  14,  1961,  is  a  criti9al event \nf \nin  Rowe's  career  as  an  FBI  informant,  because  the  evidence \nobtained by  the  Task  Force  shows  that of  the  hundreds  gathered \nfor  the  CORE  bus  arrival,  Rowe  was  one  of  the  handful most \nresponsible  for  the  violence  at the  bus  station.  The  evi-\ndence  available  to  Special  Agent  Kemp  within  hours  of  the \nincident was  such  that it would  have  been  difficult for  him \nnot  to  have  known  the  full  extent  of  Rowe's  involvement. \nHowever,  there  is  nothing  in FBI  files  which  indicates  he \nbrought  this  information  to  the  attention of  Birmingham's \nSpecial Agent  in Charge  or  Headquarters. \nThe  incident  illustrates  the  rewards  and  the  dangers  of \nhaving  an  aggressive  informant  like  Rowe.  Only  a  month \nbefore,  he  had  uncovered  a  link between  the  klan  and  the \nBirmingham Police  Department.  On  April  17,  1961,  Rowe  told \nKemp  that  he  had  been  talking  to  Robert  Shelton,  Imperial \nWizard  of  the  Alabama  Knights  of  the  Ku  Klux  Klan,  and  that \nShelton haยต  told him  to  contact  a  Sergeant  Tom  Cook  of  the \nBirmingham  Police  Department  to  pick  up  some  information \nCook  had.[l]  By  coincidence,  the  same  day  Sergeant  Cook \ncalled Special Agent  C.  B.  Stanberry,  who  handled  klan \nmatters  for  the  Bureau,  and  inquired  if Stanberry knew  one \nTommy  Lowe  [sic],  a  member  of  the  klan.  When  Stanberry  said \n1.  Memorandum  from  BH  SAC  to  Director,  Apr.  19,  1961;  BH \n170-9-93;  Task  Force  353. \n- 48  -\n\nno,  Cook  said he  intended  to  talk  to  Lowe,  but would  not  do \nso  if he  was  \"one  of  your  boys.\"12] \nLater  that day,  Rowe  met  with  Cook  at a  Birmingham \nrestaurant. [3]  Cook  told Rowe  that  the  Imperial  Wizard  had \nassured  him  that  \"Rowe  was  100%,\"  and  that Cook  wanted  to \nuse  Rowe  as  a  contact  to  pass  information  to  the  klan.  At \nthat meeting,  he  furnished  Rowe  with  the  names  of  several \ninterracial  integrationist groups  as  well  as  the  places \nwhere  they  were  meeting  and  the  identities  of  the  persons \nattending.[4]  He  also warned  Rowe  that he  believed  the  FBI \ndefinitely had  an  informant  in Eastview  13  because  the \nBureau  had  recently  tipped  off  the  Birmingham  Police  that \nthe  klavern was  planning violence  at a  local  Unitarian \nchurch.[5]  Cook  promised  that  if the  klan  could  identify  the \ninformant,  \"a  jury  could  be  fixed  to  have  the  individual \nsent  to  the  penitentiary.\"[6] \nThe  Birmingham  FBI  off ice  knew  Sergeant  Cook  was  then \nin charge  of  \"racial matters\"  for  the  Birmingham  Police \nDepartment  and  a  close  associate  of  Public  Safety  Cornmis-\nsioner Eugene  \"Bull\"  Connor.  At  the  time,  Connor  was  run-\nning  for  re-election,  and  the  Birmingham  SAC  speculated \nthat: \n2.  Id.,  354. \n3.  Id. \n4.  Id.,  354-55. \n5.  Id.,  354 \n6.

This  is particularly \nsignificant  since  it is known  by  Agents  of  this  office \nthat COOK  takes  most .of  his  orders  directly  from  CONNOR \nand  not  from  Chief  [of  Police,  Jamie]  MOORE.{7] \nSAC  Thomas  Jenkins  reassured  Headquarters  that Rowe  was  still \ncompletely  loyal  to  the  FBI  and  that: \nAll  agents  have  been  cautioned  concerning  this \npossible  connection  between  the  Birmingham Police  Depart \nment  and  the  klan.  They  were  instructed  to  immediately \nadvise  of  any  information  coming  to  their attention \nregarding  this matter. \nIn  view  of  the  above  information,  this  office \nwill  continue  to  be  most  circumspect  in  any  information \ndisseminated  to  the  Birmingham  Police  in order  not \nto divulge  the  identity of  any  of  our  informants. [8] \nWord  of  impending  violence  against  the  Freedom  Riders \ncame  i\"n  on  May  4  and  5  1961,  when  three  different Birming-\nI \nham  informants  reported  to  the  FBI  that  the  Grand  Titari, \nHubert  Page,  had  been  making  the  rounds  at klavern meetings \nwith  the  news  that the  Congress  of  Racial  Equality  (CORE) \nwas  planning  to  test desegregation  on  interstate buses  in \nAlabama  and  that Robert  Shelton wanted  all klansmen  to  stand \nby  to  stop  them  if the  police  did  not. [9]  Page  had  obtained \nhis  information  about  the  CORE  plans,  Rowe  was  able  to \nlearn,  from  Sergeant Tom  Cook.  [10]  On  May  12,  the  SAC \n7.

Rowe  reported  that an \nangry  discussion  broke  out  at  a  December  15,  1960,  meeting \nof  Eastview  13  when  klansmen  learned  that nothing  had  been \ndone  about  a  sit-in at Birmingham's  Greyhound  station. [12] \nKlan  officers  apologized  and  promised  to  prepare  plans  for \nfuture  sit-ins.[13]  Writing  in  the  third person  under  the \npseudonym  Karl  Cross,  Rowe  mentioned  something  else  in  that \nreport which,  with  the  benefit of  hindsight,  becomes  impor-\ntant: \nThey  also  said  that  they want  all group  captains \nto  get  together  for more  training  in  the  manner  to \nhandle  such  attempts.  We  also  heard  that they  told \nklansmen  BILLY  JACKSON  and  TOMMY  ROWE  one  day  this \nweek  to  start Judo  classes  on  all  the  lethal  chops \nand  holds  that  they  know,  and  a  select group  of men \nwill  receive  this  training.[14] \nOn  May  12,  1961,  Rowe  alerted  the  Bureau  that Hubert  Page, \nthe  Grand  Titan,  had  visited Eastview  13  the  night before \nand  announced  he  had  just learned  that  the  CORE  \"Freedom \nRiders\"  would  arrive  in  Birmingham  on  Sunday,  May  14,  and \n11.

[15]  After  the  meeting,  Page \ntold  Rowe  that he  learned  the  date  of  their arrival  from \nShelton,  who  got  it from  Sergeant  Tom  Cook.  Pag~ said  that \n( \nBull  Connor  had  promised  that,  when  trouble  broke  out, \nConnor  would  see  that  fifteen  to  twenty minutes  would  elapse \nbefore  sending  in  the  police.  If blacks  attempted  to  enter \nthe  depot  restaurant,  Connor  reportedly  advised  the  klansmen \nto  start a  fight  and  blame  it on  the  blacks;  and  if they \nattempted  to  enter  the  restrooms,  to  beat  them  up  until  it \n\"looked  like  a  bulldog  got  a  hold  of  them,\"  remove  their \nclothes,  allowing  the  police  to  arrest  them  as  they  emerged \nnaked.  Connor  advised  the  klan  leadership  not  to worry  if \nany  klansmen  were  arrested.  He  would  see  that  the  blacks \nwould  be  found  at  fault  and  would  insure  that  any  sentences, \nif meted  out  to  klansmen,  would  be  light. [16] \nRowe  was  unable  to  determine  whether  Connor  had  spoken \ndirectly to  Page  or  through  Shelton. [17]  The  primary  docu-\nmentary  evidence  of  Bull  Connor's  \"fifteen minutes\"  state-\nment,  is  the  teletype  summarizing  Rowe's  report which  the \nSAC  immediately  dispatched  to  Headquarters.

Sixty  select klansmen  were  ordered  to  be  present  at \nthe  scene  -- thirty  at the  depot  and  thirty more  in  reserve \nat the Moulton  Hotel  nearby,  to be  deployed  once  the  action \ni \nstarted.  Five  klan  officers,  including  Rowe,  were  assigned \nto  stand  inside  the  depot  to  spot  CORE  leaders  as  they \narrived.  The  five  were  not  to participate  in  the  planned \nbeatings,  but were  to  follow  the  CORE  leaders  to  their hotel \nor motel  and  attack  them  later.  Each  klansman  was  assigned \nto  a  squad  leader,  one  of whom  was  Rowe,  and  instructed  to \nbring  his  leaded  baseball  bat.[19] \nAll  of  these  facts,  including  Rowe's  proposed  role, \nwere  teletyped  immediately  to  Headquarters  on  May  12. [20] \nAt  6:25  p.m.  on  the  same  day,  Headquarters  Supervisor \nClement  McGowan  telephoned  Birmingham Assistant Special \nAgent  in  charge,  Kenneth  Raby,  and  directed  him  to  alert \nPolice  Chief  Moore  that  \"several  groups\"  were  interested  in \nthe  CORE  buses'  arrival,  and  that  there  \"could  be  some \nviolence.\"  The  exact  language  was  important  because  of  the \ndanger  of  exposing  the  source  of  the  information. [21] \nThe  following  morning,  Saturday,  May  13,  SAC  Jenkins \nlocated  Chief  Moore  and  gave  him  the warning. [22]  Moore \n19.  Id.,  389-90. \n20.

[23] \nSaturday  afternoon,  the  Atlanta  FBI  office  teletyped \nHeadquarters,  Birmingham  and  Mobile  to  advise  thqt  two  CORE \ngroups  had  arrived  in Atlanta on  separate  buses  and  had  used \nthe  station  facilities  there without  incident.  The  buses \nwere  scheduled  to  depart  for  Birmingham  at  8:40  a.m.  and \n11:00  a.m.  the  morning  of  the  14th. [24]  For  the  third  time, \nSAC  Jenkins  picked  up  the  telephone  and  advised  Chief  Moore \nthat  the  buses,  and  the  violence,  were  coming. [25] \nThe  Bureau  conducted  a  massive  investigation  in  the \nmonths  that  followed  to  establish what  actually  happened  at \nthe  Trailways  bus  station that  Sunday,  and  it is  puzzling, \nin  light of what  they  knew  of  the  incident  in  advance,  that \nthe  FBI  did  not  place  agents  at  the  scene  to  observe  the \nincident  first hand.  Nothing  in  FBI  files  indicates  whether \nthat was  even  considered.  Of  course,  the  Bureau  no  doubt \nassumed  that  primary  responsibility  for  maintaining  law  and \norder  lay with  the  Birmingham  Police  Department.  However, \nboth  Headquarters  and  Birmingham  did  have  reason  to  suspect \na  police-klan collusion  to  interfere with  the  rights  of \ninterstate  travellers,  and  in  hindsight,  it is  indeed  unfortunate \nthat  the  Bureau  did  not  take  additional  action  to  prevent  the \n23.

The  Bureau  did  conduct  an  exhaustive  in-\nvestigation  after the  incident,  except  perhaps  as  to  Rowe's \nI \ninvolvement.  [26] \nNumerous  witnesses  were  interviewed,  and  virtually  all \nagreed  on  the  basic  facts . . The  first  CORE  bus  left Atlanta \nas  scheduled  and  travelled westward  along  U.S.  78  to  Annis-\nton,  Alabama,  sixty miles  east  of  Birmingham,  where  a  mob  of \nCalhoun  County  klansmen  forced  it off  the  road  and  threw  a \nfire  bomb  inside,  destroying  the  entire bus.  Somehow,  the \npassengers  managed  to  escape  without  serious  injury.  [27] \nRowe  was  not  involved  in  this  incident. \nThe  second  bus,  trailing by  two  hours,  arrived at the \nTrailways  station  in downtown  Birmingham  at  about  4:15 \np.m.  [28]  The  CORE  group  disembarked  amidst  a  crowd  of  regu-\nlar passengers  and  walked  from ..t he  platform at  the  rear of \nthe  station through  a  corridor  toward  the  \"white  only\" \nwaiting  room.

L.  B.  Earle,  a  local white  completely  unaware  of \nthe  CORE  expedition,  had  just emerged  from  the  restroom when \nthe  mob  caught  him  and  put  seven  deep. gashes  in his  head. \nWhen  it was  over,  nine  persons  were  sent  to  the  hospital, \nonly  two  of whom  were  CORE  freedom  riders.  :[31] \nOne  of  the  injured  blacks  was  George  Webb,  who  had  come \nto  the  station to  pick  up  his  fiance,  a  passenger  on  the  bus, \n[32]  but  not  part  of  the  CORE  group.  He  was  standing  near \nthe  rear  door  of  the  corridor when  four  men  grabbed  him  and \nstarted to  beat  him  with  fists  and  clubs.

The \nphotographer,  Tom  Langston,  stated that  his  camera  flash \nf \ncaused  the  men  who  were  beating  up  Webb  to  drop  their victim \nand  chase  Langston  out  the  building  and  onto  a  platform \nwhere  they  smashed  his  camera  and  beat  him  unconscious. [40] \nJulian  \"Bud\"  Gordon,  a  reporter  for  the  Birmingham News,  was \nstanding  in  the  parking  lot  at  the  rear of  the  depot  and  saw \nthem  pummeling  the  photographer.  He  told  the  Bureau  that \nthe  men  who  got  Langston  were  the  same  ones  who  were  shown \ndoing  the  beating  in  the  newspaper  picture. [41]  Gordon  took \nthree  pictures  of  the  Langston  beating  before  the  attackers \nspotted  him,  rushed  over,  and  demanded  his  film.  Gordon  told \nthe  Bureau  that  \"the  big  fellow\"  who  was  bending  over  the \nvictim  in  the  newspaper  picture was  the  one  who  took  his \ncamera,  but  later restrained  the  pipe-wielding man  from \nhitting  Gordon.

Minutes  later,  the  heavy-set, \nyellow-~hirted man  and  two  other~ approached  his  car. \nThey  smashed  his  car window,  jerked  the microphone  off  the \ndash,  and  threw  Lake  on  to  the  pavement. [45]  Then  they  threw \nhim  up  against  a  wall  and  took  two  swings  at him with  a \nblackjack,  which  missed.  Then,  Lake  watched  them  as  they \nwalked  casually  up  the  street toward  the  police  station. [46] \nSeveral  days  later,  Rowe  admitted  he  smashed  Clancy  Lake's \nwindow. [ 4 7] \nAt  7:15  p.m.,  on  May  14,  Kemp  telephoned  Rowe's  house \nto  find  out what  had  happened.  Rowe's  wife  told Kemp  that \nhe  had  returned  home  briefly at 5:00  p.m.  and  left again  in \nthe  company  of  three  other men.

There \nis no  mention  in  the  memorandum  that Rowe  himself. took  part \nin  the  violence.  [50] \nIn  the  same  memorandum,  Kemp  states  that  Rowe  told him \nthat he  had  gone  with  a  group  of  klansmen  to  the  Greyhound \ndepot  about  6:00  p.m.  on  May  14  in hopes  of  catching  another \nCORE  bus,  and  that his  throat  got  cut when  a  fight  broke  out \nwith  some  local  blacks  taking  license  numbers. [51]  There \nare  no  further  details  of  Rowe's  involvement  in  that  fight. \nFinally,  Kemp  reported  that on  the morning  of May  15,  1961, \nhe  called Rowe  about  the  photograph  on  the  front  page  of  the \nBirmingham  Post-Herald,  and  Rowe  identified  three  klansmen. \n_Again,  there  was  no  mention  that Rowe  was  in  the  picture.

Ac-\ncording  to  Kemp,  Rowe  learned  through  klan  contacts  that  the \nman  swinging  the  club was  not  a  klansmanยท,  but  a  member  of \nthe  National  States  Rights  Party,  a  militant  segregationist \norganization.  Kemp  reported  additional  speculation  about \nthe  identities  of  other  individuals,  but  again,  failed  to \nmention  that Rowe  was  in  the  picture.  [55]  The  Task  Force \nwas  unable  to  determine  anyone  in  the. Birmingham  field \noffice  other  than  Kemp  who  knew  what  Rowe  looked  like. \nOn  the  same  day,  Kemp  wrote  a  lengthy  and  detailed \naccount  of  Rowe's  involvement  in Trailways.  It begins  with \nan  explanation: \nHUBERT  PAGE,  Grand  Titan  for  THE  ALABAMA  KNIGHTS, \nKNIGHTS  OF  THE  KU  KLUX  KLAN,  INCORPORATED,  had  speci \nfically  instructed  BH  248-PCI  (RAC)  that he  was  to \nbe  present with  PAGE  at all  times  on May  14,  1961,  so \n54.

Rowe  also  admitted  he  was  part of  the  group \nwho  attacked Clancy  Lake,  although  he  said  they  did  so  be-\ncause  Lake  cursed  at them.  Specifically,  Rowe  admitted \nusing  his  heel  to  smash  Lake's  window  and  attempting  to \nstrike Lake  when  he  was  against  the  wall.  [57]  There  is no \ndiscussion  in  the  memorandum  that Rowe  took  part  in any \nof  the  beating  inside  the  depot. \nWhen  the  Task  Force  showed  Kemp  the  Post-Herald \nphotograph  on  March  9,  1979,  he  had  no  difficulty  identify-\ning  individual  number  18  as  being  Rowe,  but he  could  not \n56.

His  own  reports  from  the \ntime  show  that he  has  exaggerated  his  role,  and  that Cook \nwas  working  through  Hubert  Page,  the  Grand  Titan.

MAY  1961  - JUNE  1963 \nThe  files  indicated  that  Rowe's  informant  career  for \nthe  next  twenty-five  months  is  relatively uneventful.  He \ncontinued  to  report  regularly on  klan  activities,,  which \nr \nmostly were  cross  burnings,  speeches,  and  conventions  known \nas  \"klonvocations\".  The  Birmingham  field  office  advised \nHeadquarters  that  \"he  is  held  in  esteem by  Robert  M. . shelton, \nImperial  Wizard  of  the  new  United  Klans  of  America,  and  his \nadvice  and  company  is  sought  frequently  by  Hubert  Page,  a \nmember  of  Eastview  klavern  and  now  Grand  Dragon  [state  leader] \nfor  Alabama  of  the  United  Klans  of  America,  Inc.\"[l] \nFour  events  in  this  period  are  particularly  noteworthy, \nand  they  illustrate once  again  the  costs  and  rewards  of \nusing  informants. \nA.- The  Bessemer  Carnival  and  Krystal  Kitchen  Incidents \nA mass  meeting  of  all  the  klansmen  in northern  Alabama \nwas  held  on  April  11,  1962,  to  discuss  the  fact  that blacks \nhad  been  mixing  with  whites  at  a  carnival  then  being  held  in \nhonor  of  Bessemer's  diamond  jubilee.  Rowe  and  an  informant \nfrom  another  klavern  reported  that  Grand  Dragon  Hubert  Page \nhad  given  orders  for  a  select group  of  klansmen  to  bring \ntheir weapons  to  the  carnival  at  9:00  p.m.  on  April  12th.

[3]  The  Bureau  immediately  alerted \nBessemer  Police  Chief  George  Barron,  who  dispatched  an  extra \n( \ndetail  of  police  to  cover  the  carnival. [4]  Chief  Barron \ncalled  at 11:30  p.m.  on  the  12th,  and  informed  the  Birmingham \nfield  office  that  the  carnival  closed  that  evening  without \nincident. [5]  The  next  morning,  Rowe  reported  that  the \nklansmen  had  arrived  on  schedule,  but  only  milled  around  the \narea,  and  had  done  nothing.  Rowe  pointed  out  that  the \ncarnival's  final  day  was  the  14th,  and  that  there  were  no \nadditional  plans  for  violence.  [6] \nSix weeks  later,  a  curious  entry was  made  in  Rowe's \ninformant  file.  It is  a  report  he  prepared  describing what \nhappened  on  April  12th: \nWe  were  very  busy  but  learned  that  some  of \nthe  Klansmen  were  determined  to  stop  the  Negroes \nfrom  attending  the  Carnival  and  going  in  the \nvarious  features  along  with white  people.  Some \nof  the  Klansmen  carried  chains,  others  carried \nbattery  cables,  knives  and  a  few  guns.  It was \ndifficult to  keep  track  of  all  the  men  but we \nlearned  that  a  Klansman  named  CAGLE,  another \nnamed  WYMAN  LEE  and  possibly  BUDDY  GALYEAN  were \narrested  by  Bessemer  Police  on  this  occasion. \nThey  were  later brought  into  Recorders  Court  in \nBessemer  where  the  judge  dismissed  several  cases \nincluding  those  against  the  above  named  Klansmen, \n3.

BH  SAC  to  Director,  supra  n.2  at  892-93. \n- 66  -\n\nWe \naccording  to  our  best  information.  learned \nthat  BUDDY  GALYEAN  was  wielding  a  battery  cable \nand  it is known  that  GENE  THOMAS  of  [Bessemer]  was \nhitting one  big  Negro  over  the  head  with  some \nkind  of  chain. [7] \nHe  signed  this  report  using  his  code  name  Karl  Cross  on \n( \nJune  1,  1962,  one  and  a  half months  after  the  incident.  As \nthe  reader  can  tell,  the  report  is vague  about  what  Rowe  was \ndoing.  When  the  Task  Force  interviewed  Rowe,  he  stated  that \nhe  beat  several  people  that evening,  and  told  the  Bureau \nwhat  he  had  done. [8]  The  agent  handling  him  at the  time, \nByron  McFall,  told  the  Task  Force  that  his  memory  of  the \nevent  is  vague,  but  he  does  not  believe  Rowe  told him  he  was \npersonally  involved  in  the  fighting. [9] \nThe  facts  are  ambiguous.  It is not  clear why  Rowe \nwrote  a  supplementary  report  on  June  1st,  but  it seems  that \nRowe  did  not  tell McFall  everything  he  had  done  when  reporting \non  April  13th,  or on  June  1st either.  On  the  other  hand, \nRowe's  informant  file  does  not  contain  any  indication  that \nMcFall  attempted  to  follow  up  on  the  many  unanswered  questions \nin  the  June  1st report. \nMcFall  described  his  attitude  toward  informants  and \ntheir work: \n7.

But  you  have  to  face \nthis  item of  reality,  and  that  is,  ... if he's  going \nalong  as  if he  were  a  good,  solid  Klansman,  he's \ngoing  to  have  to  act  like  he  engages  in  the \nactivities,  and  go  along  with  them,  or  he'll \nnever  find  out what's  going  on.  1 \nI  don't want  this  to  be  construed  as  a  subtle \nway  of  saying  that we  instructed  him  at all; \nbecause  we  did  not.  He  was  instructed not  to \nengage  in violence,  just as  criminal  informants \nare  instructed:  Don't  engage  in  criminal \nactivities  in  order  to  get  information  for  us. \nWe  got  all  the  information we  need. [10] \nA  similar  incident  occurred  on  December  2,  1961,  when  a \ngroup  of  klansmen  stopped  at  the  Krystal  Kitchen  restaurant \nin  Birmingham  for  hamburgers,  and  discovered  a  black  sitting \nat  the  counter.  Rowe  reported  that .a  \"general  fight  ensued\" \nwhich  was  broken  up  by  the  police. [11]  The  files  give  no \nindication  that  he was  personally  involved,  although  Rowe \nnow  freely  admits  he  beat  up  two  people  there. [12]  Again, \nit is not  possible  to  determine  if Rowe  failed  to  report  the \nincident,  McFall  failed  to  record  it,  or  if  Rowe  is  now  not \ntelling the  truth. \nB.  Assassination  Attempt  On  Rev.  Fred  L.  Shuttlesworth \nAs  Rowe  arrived  at  a  meeting  of  the  Eastview  klavern  on \nJuly  19,  1962,  he  was  called  aside  by  Grand  Dragon  Hubert \n10.  Id.,  18-19. \n11.

[13]  The  subject was  the  recent \nFederal  Court  decision  desegregating  the  Dobbs  House  restau-\nrant  at the  Birmingham  airport.  Hubert  Page  told  the  group \nt \nthey  were  selected  for  the  meeting  because  they were  all \ntrusted klansmen. \nAccording  to  Rowe,  Page  said  that Mayor  Arthur  Hanes \nand  Commissioner  Bull  Connor  were  \"tired of  the  way  things \n[w]ere  going  in  the  racial  situation  in  Birmingham,  but  that \ntheir hands  [were]  tied.\"  Page  said  that  Tom  Cook  of  the \nBirmingham  Police  had  informed  him  that  Rev.  Shuttlesworth \nwas  going  to  lead  a  group  into  the  Dobbs  House  on  July  21st \nor  22nd  to  test the  desegregation  ruling.  Page  bragged  that \nthe  police  had  promised  protection  if the  klan  took  action \nagainst  the  Shuttlesworth  group,  and  he  claimed  to  have  made \narrangements  with  Governor  John  Patterson  for  pardons  if \nthey  were  caught  and  convicted. Il4] \nPage  then  described  the  plan  of  attack. [15]  Four \nklansmen  were  to  start a  fight  with  the  demonstrators  at  the \nrestaurant while  one  man  would  use  the  fight  as  cover  to \nquietly kill  Rev.  Shuttlesworth with  a  knife.  Huey  Lipscomb, \na  klansman  later to  become  a  FBI  informant,  agreed  to  kill \nhim. [16] \n13.

Rowe  said  he  tried to  point  out  that  away \n\"~oing \nf \nwith  Rev.  Shuttlesworth would  only  cause  more  trouble  and \nthat  someone  would  step  into  his  shoes,  but  the  others  were \ntoo worked  up  to  listen to  reason.\"  [17]  Page  said  that the \npolice  had  informed  him  that  Rev.  Shuttlesworth was  usually \naccompanied  by  two  body  guards,  and  Rowe  was  assigned  to \nfight  one  of  them. [18] \nThe  allegations  of  police  complicity  posed  a  dilemma \nfor  SAC  Henry  A.  Fitzgibbon.  Revealing  that the  FBI  knew  of \nthe  plot might  dissuade  the  conspirators  from  killing \nShuttlesworth,  but  it might  also  put  Rowe's  life  in  jeopardy \nby  exposing  him  as  an  informant.  This  is,  in  fact,  exactly \nwhat  happened. \nOn  July  20,  1962,  SAC  Fitzgibbon  called Mayor  Hanes  and \nPolice  Chief  Moore  and  advised  them  in  guarded  terms  that ยท \nthe  Bureau was  aware  of  a  serious  threat  to  the  life of  Rev. \nShuttlesworth  should  he  appear  at  the  Dobbs  House. [19]  Moore \nreplied  that  he  would  have  a  special  detail  at  the  airport \n17.  Id.,  1026. \n18.  Id.,  1026-27. \n19.

[20]  Floyd  Mann,  Director  of  Public  Safety \nfor  Alabama,  was  given  the  same  information. [21] \nMeanwhile,  the  Bureau  located  Rev.  Shuttlesworth  in \nCincinnati,  and  an  agent  advised  him  in  person  of  the  threat \nf \nto  his  li~e. [22]  Rev.  Shuttlesworth was  grateful  for  the \ninformation,  and  indicated  that he  planned  to  arrive  in \nBirmingham  on  July  30th,  rather  than  the  21st. [23] \nThe  klansmen,  and  Rowe,  worked  in  shifts  at  the  airport \nall  through  the  weekend  of  July  21st  and  22nd,  and  the \nklansmen  were  disappointed when  Rev.  Shuttlesworth  did  not \nappear. [24]  Groups  of  blacks  were  seated  and  served  on  both \ndays  at the  Dobbs  House,  but  the  klansmen  made  no  move \nagainst  them  because  of  the  extra policemen. [25] \nOn  the  evening  of  July  22nd,  Page  cornered  Rowe  and \ntold him  that Page's  contact  in  the  police  department  had \njust  informed  him  that  the  FBI  knew  about  the  klan's  plan, \nand  this  could  only  mean  that one  of  six men  had  been  talking \ntoo  much.

[27]  Page  never  figured  out who  the \ninformant  was,  and  he  continued  to  confide  in  Rowe.  How \nl \never,  one  of  the  six conspirators,  Bill  Holt,  never  com-\npletely trusted  Rowe  again,  and  tried on  several  occasions \nto  have  him  thrown  out  of  the  klan.  [28] \nC.  The  Trip  to  Tuscaloosa \nOn  June  8,  1963,  Rowe  advised  the  Birmingham  office  that \ntwelve  members  of  the  Eastview  13  security  guard  were  to \ntravel  to  Tuscaloosa,  Alabama,  apparently  in  connection with \nthe  attempt  to  desegregate  the  University  of  Alabama.  Klans-\nman  Herman  Cash  asked  Rowe  to  bring  Rowe's  unregistered \ncarbine.  The  FBI  immediately  notified  local  authorities, \nmilitary  intelligence  and  the  Department  of  Justice  [29] \nSeveral  hours  later Alabama's  Director  of  Public  Safety \ntold  the  FBI  that  the  Alabama  Highway  Patrol  had  arrested  six \nmen  on  Highway  11  just outside  Tuscaloosa.  The  men  had  six \nloaded  pistols,  two  night  sticks,  a  bale  hook,  two  sabres \nand  two  bayonets.

The  Bombings \nIn  1963,  Birmingham was  shaken  by  a  series  of  bombings,  most \nof which  Federal  law  enforcement  officials  considered  the work  of \nthe  Ku  Klux  Klan: \n(1)  A  dynamite  explosion  at  the  Gaston  Motel,  owned \nby  a  wealthy  and  prominent  black  businessman  on  May -11,  1963; \n(2)  Two  dynamite  explosions,  also  on  May  11,  1963, \nat the  home  of  Reverend  A.

Firebombing  of A.  G.  Gaston  Residence \nOn  September  8,  1963,  A.  G.  Gaston's  home  in Jefferson  County, \nAlabama,  was  struck  by  two  firebombs.  FBI  records  indicate  that \nthe  \"facts  in  this  firebombing  were  brought  to  the  attention of \nthe  Department  [of  Justice]  on  September  8,  1963,  and  no  investi-\ngation was  requested. [3]  However,  the  Birmingham  office  of  the \nFBI  maintained  a  file  on  it. [4]  Rowe  discusses  this  incident  in \nhis  book,[5]  without  saying  he  was  there  when  the  bombs  were \nplanted.  However,  in an  interview with Alabama  law  enforcement \nofficials  in 1977,  Rowe  claimed  that he  \"was  in  on  that\"  bombing. [6] \nRowe  stated  that  he  suggested  to  one  of  the  alleged  klan  partici-\npants:  \"Why  don't we  just show  his  [Gaston's]  ass  up?  You  know, \nwe'll  go  out  and  bomb\"  his  home.

[8]  He  described  how \nthey  crawled  on  their hands  and  knees  past  an  armed  guard, \nwhile  a  klansman  left Rowe  and  crept  up  to  the  fr.ont  of  the \n( \nhouse  and  lobbed  a  \"quick  flare\"  at  the  home. [9]  Rowe  told \nthe  Alabama  officials  in  1977  that he  contacted  the  FBI  that \nevening  and  described  the  Gaston  bombing.  Rowe  also  informed \nthe  Task  Force  about  the  Gaston  home  bombing, [10]  again \nsaying  he  reported  the  incident  to  the  FBI. [11] \nHowever,  our  review  of  FBI  files,  including  the  Gaston \nbombing  file,  BH  157-341,  and  Rowe's  informant  files,  pro-\nduced  no  record:  (1)  that  Rowe  was  near  the  Gaston  home  on \nSeptember  8,  1963,  or  any  other  time;  (2)  that  he  discussed \nthe  bombing  with  any  FBI  officials;  or  (3)  that  he  was  ever \nsuspected  of  being  involved. \n2.

[12] \nThe  bomb  exploded  in  an  empty  basement  room,  blew  down  a \nwall,  and  hurled  rocks  and  debris  into  a  Sunday  9chool  room \nwhere  the  children were  reassembling  for  closing  prayers.  [13] \nIt was  the  forty-first  bombing  in  Birmingham  since  1947.  [14] \nIn  Washington,  President  John  F.  Kennedy  expressed \n\"outrage  and  grief\"  over  the  killing.  [15]  Civil  Rights  Assistant \nAttorney  General  Burke  Marshall  was  ordered  to  fly  directly \nto  Birmingham.  The  FBI  dispatched  ten  special  agents  and  Little \nRock  SAC  Roy  K.  Moore  to  conduct  a  full-field  investigation, \nincluding  an  inunediate  crime  scene  search,  interviewing wit-\nnesses  and  examining  files  to  identify  key  suspects.  [16] \nOn  September  16,  Attorney  General  Robert  F.  Kennedy \ntelephoned  his  FBI  liaison  Courtney  A.  Evans  at  5:20  p.m.  and \nasked  for  a  progress  report  on  the  investigation.  Evans  told \nhim  the  Bureau was  conducting  an  \"all-out,  no  holds  barred \ninvestigation,\"  but  had  nothing  concrete  to  report.  On \nEvans'  memorandum  to  Belmont,  Hoover  wrote,  \"We  must  not \ngive  a  'blow by  blow'  account  (to  the  Department)  because \n12.

[19]  Over  the  next  month  or \nso,  the  investigation was  \"pressed  relentlessly  24  hours  a  day, \nseven  days  a  week  โข...  All  logical  and  even,  when  necessary, \nillogical  leads\"  were  pursued.  [20] \nB.  Contacts  with  Rowe \nFormer  Special  Agent  Byron  McFall  who  was  then  Rowe's \nhandling  agent,  spoke  with  Rowe  several  times  on  September .15, \n1963.  According  to  his  report  to  SAC  Faisst,  McFall  made  his \ndaily  telephone  call  to  Rowe  at  9:00  a.m.  Rowe  had  nothing  to \nreport,  except  to  say  that  he  had  been  awakened  at  4:00  a.m.  by \na  loud  blast.  McFall  immediately  investigated  the  matter  and \ndetermined  the  noise  Rowe  heard was  a  boiler explosion  at the \n17.  Memorandum  from  C.A.

At  9:30  a.m.,  he  called  Rowe \nback  to  tell him  so. \nLess  than  an  hour  later,  McFall  learned  of  the  church \nbombing.  He  telephoned  Rowe  immediately.  Rowe  provided  no \n( \ninformation  and  volunteered  that  he  did  not  think  klansmen \nwere  involved,  explaining  that  the  16th  Street  Church  was \nlocated  in  a  heavily  black  neighborhood.  He  did  name  four \nklansmen  as  possible  suspects  because  they  had  been  handling \n\"problems\"  for  the  klan,  but  emphasized  that he  had  no  infor-\nmation  whatever  linking  these  men  to  the  bombing.  Rowe  then \noffered  to  do  some  checking.  He  made  several  telephone  calls \nto  three  of  the  klansmen  and  one  of  their  frfends,  but was \nunable  to  reach  any  of  them.  [21]  Rowe  now  says  that  shortly \nafter  the  bombing  he  informed  his  handling  agent  that he  had \nseen  Robert  Chambliss  and  Tommy  Blanton,  Jr.,  in  an  automobile \nnear  the  16th  Street  Church  on  the  night  of  September  13, \n1963.  [22]  We  found  no  document  in  FBI  files  to  support  this \nclaim. \nThe  FBI  continued  to  interview  Rowe  about  the  church \nbombing,  but  he  provided  little additional  information.  On \nDecember  23,  1963,  Rowe  executed  an  affidavit  in  the  presence \nof  Special  Agents  J.  Brooke  Blake  and  Byron  McFall.  Rowe \nstated: \nI  have  never  been  involved  in  any  bombings \nand  do  not  have  knowledge  of who  perpetrated  any \nof  the  Birmingham  bombings.  [23] \n21.

Affidavit  of  Gary  Thomas  Rowe,  Dec.  23,  1963,  HQ  62-118023 \nat  81. \n- 79  -\n\nHowever,  it is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  affidavit was  not \nwhat  it appeared  to  be,  as  Rowe  also  stated  that  he  had  never \nbelonged  to  any  klan  organization  an  obviously  inaccurate \nstatement.  Thus,  it appears  that  the  af~idavit was  written \nf \nfor  Rowe's  safety--so  that  he  could  tell the  klan  that he \nhad  never  given  information  to  the  FBI. \nC.  The  Bureau's  Suspects \nWithin  about  two  months,  the  FBI  had  focused  its \ninvestigation on  ten  klansmen:  Tommy  Blanton,  Jr.,  Charles \nCa.gl.e,  Robert  Chambliss,  Troy  Ingram,  Levi  Yarbrough,  Bobby \nCherry,  Earl  Thompson,  Billy  Tipton,  Gene  Reeves,  and  Ross \nKeith.  [24]  Seven  of  the  ten were  present  or  past members  of \nEastview  13,  and  the  others  were  klan  associates  of  one  or \nmore  of  the  seven. \nThe  FBI  particularly concentrated  on  Chambliss  as  a  likely \nsuspect.  Rowe  had  told  the  Bureau  less  than  a  month  before  the \nchurch  bombing  that  he  had  heard  that  Chambliss  had  bombed \nblack  homes  in  Birmingham  in  the  past  and  had  generally  operated \nwith  four  others.  [25]  Only  two  days  after  the  bombing,  a \nJefferson  County  Sheriff's  Office  detective  reported  that \nRobert  Chambliss  had  made  the  church  bomb  at klansman  Troy \nIngram's  home  on  September  14,  1963.  [26]  A  few  days  later, \nthe  FBI  learned  that  Chambliss  had  been  particularly  ill-\ntempered  the  previous  week  and  had  complained  that  the  church \n24.

[27]  Apparently,  Chambliss \nhad  become  disenchanted with  the  klan's  reluctance  to  do \nserious  violence  and  had  organized  a  new  group  of  klansmen \nwho  met  near  the  Cahaba  River  Bridge.  [28] \nThe  first  important  eyewitness  identification of \nFBI'~ \nany  of  the  above  suspects  in  the  church  bombing  case  was  from \na  Detroit woman,  Kirthus  L.  Glenn.  She  told the  Bureau  that \nshe  and  her  date  had  parked  their  car  near  the  church  between \n2:10  and  2:15  a.m.  in  the  early morning  of  September  15,  1963. \nWhile  there,  she  saw  a  car,  which  fit the  description  of  Tommy \nBlanton,  Jr.'s and  noticed  three  other white  men.  Mrs.  Glenn \nidentified  Chambliss  as  the  man  in  the  right  rear  seat of  the \ncar.  [29] \nBy  December,  1964,  the  Bureau  received  some  vital  new \ninformation  on  the  church  bombing  case. \nAfter  2:00  in  the  morning  of  September  15,  1963,  Dale \nTarrant  and  Abington  Spaulding  drove  over  to  the  16th  Street \nBaptist  Church,  where,  on  Sixth  Avenue  North  near  the  church, \nยท they  observed  a  1957  blue  and  white  Oldsmobile  with  Tommy \nBlanton,  Jr.,  at the  wheel  and  Chambliss  in  the  back  seat. \n27.

Either  Cherry \nf \nor  Cash  climbed  back  into  the  Chevrolet,  while  the  other  started \nwalking  east down  the  alley  toward  the  church  \"carrying  some-\nthing  by  a  handle.\"  Tarrant  could  not  identify whom  he  saw \nwalking  down  the  alley,  but  he  was  certain  it was  not  Chambliss \nor  Blanton.  Then  Blanton  started up  his  car,  drove  north  on \n15th  Street  to  Seventh  Avenue  North,  turned  right  and  proceeded \neast,  out  of  Tarrant's  sight. \nFour  or  five  minutes  later,  Tarrant  spotted  Blanton's \ncar  parked  at the  intersection  of  Seventh  Avenue  and  16th  Street \nNorth  with  Chambliss,  Blanton,  and  a  third  individual,  presumably \nCash  or  Cherry,  waiting  inside.  Tarrant  immediately  saw  the \nfourth  individual  walking  toward  the  car  and  away  from  the \n16th  Street Baptist  Church.  Tarrant  and  Spaulding  became  \"very \nfrightened\"  and  quickly  left the  area. \nIn  his  December,  1964,  interview with  FBI  agents  Melton \nAlexander  and  Robert  Womack,  fifteen  months  after the  fatal \nbombing,  Tarrant  could  not  recall  other vehicles  or  pedestrians \nin the  church's  vicinity  at the  time.  [30] \nThe  Task  Force  asked  Alexander  about  his  interview with \nTarrant: \n30.  Report  of  Dale  Tarrant  to  SA  Womack  and  SA  Melton  Alexander, \nDec.  15,  1964;  BH  157-352-5476.

[31] \nAlexander  also  had  no  recollection of  anyone  in  the  field \ni \noff ice  telling him  that  he  was  attaching  too  much  significance \nto  these  interview  reports.  [32]  Immediately  after  interviewing \nTarrant  and  Spaulding,  Alexander  prepared  a  teletype  and \ncommunicated  their eyewitness  accounts  to  Headquarters.  [33] \nA memorandum  was  prepared  over  Alex  Rosen's  name  for  the  FBI \ntop  command.  [34]  \"Our  concentration  on  coverage  of  the  'Cahaba \nRiver  Group',\"  it read,  \" ... has  produced  a  significant break-\nthrough  in  the  form  of  live  sources  who  may  eventually  be  in \na  position  to  furnish  testimony  in  this matter.\"  [37]  Tarrant \nand  Spaulding's  reports  were  communicated  in  full  to  the  FBI \nleadership,  along with  the  caveat  that  neither would  \"testify \nat this  time  since  they  are  literally fearful  of  their  lives.\"  [36] \nWhen  we  interviewed  Dale  Tarrant  in  February  1979,  he \nrecanted  the  entire  account  and  said  that  Spaulding  and  he \nwere  lying  to  the  agents  at the  time.

[38]  Of  course,  it is  equally  possible  that  the  two \ninformants  are  still fearful  for  their  lives  and  are  only  now \nrecanting,  sixteen years  later,  to  protect  themselves  from \nretaliation by  the  klan,  particularly when  some  of  the  details \nof  their observations  of  the  morning  of  September  15,  1963, \nwere  confirmed  by  Kirthus  Glenn,  a  woman  whom  they  apparently \ndid  not  know  when  they  spoke  with  the  FBI  in  1964.

Rowe  as  a  Suspect \nThe  Task  Force  discovered  no  evidence  from  FBI  files \nlinking  Rowe  to  the  church  bombing  or  suggesting  that  the  FBI \never  considered  him  to  be  a  suspect. \nOn  November  13,  1964,  FBI  informant  Dale  Tarrant was  asked \nhis  opinion  as  to who  was  responsible  for  the  bombing  of  the \n16th  Street  Church.  He  identified nine  persons  who  partici-\npated,  four  others  who  might  have  participated  in  furnishing \nthe  dynamite  which  became  the  fatal  bomb,  and  eleven  other men \nincluding  Rowe  who  according  to  Tarrant  \"had  knowledge\"  about \nthe  bombing.  [50]  The  Task  Force .found  no  indication  that \nTarrant's  opinion  generated  any  investigation  about  Rowe's \nknowledge  or  involvement  in  the  bombing  even  though  Rowe  had \npreviously  provided  no  information which  we  found  concerning \nwho ยทwas  responsible. \nApparently,  the  FBI  did  not  show  Rowe's  picture  to  persons \nwho  may  have  had  information  about  the  church  bombing  case, \neven  when  pictures  of  suspects  were  shown.  However,  Rowe's \nphoto  was  shown  to  FBI  informant  'Wylam  Pratt'  in March,  1964, \nin connection with  the  FBI's  investigation of  the  church  bombing \ncase.  [51]  The  FBI  may  well  have  shown  Rowe's  picture  to  this \nperson,  however,  solely  to minimize  the  risk  that  Pratt would \nsuspect  Rowe  was  an  informant. \n50.

For  instance,  in  July, \n1964ยท,  Chambliss  suspected  that  Rowe  was  an  FBI  informant.  He \nreportedly  said  that  if the  klan  found  him  at a  klavern \nguilt~ \n( \nmeeting,  Rowe  \"would  not  leave  the  meeting  alive.\"  [52] \nIn  August,  1963,  Rowe  was  one  of  the  Eastview  13  members \nwho  was  assigned  to  locate  the  shack  along  the  Cahaba  River \nwhere  Chambliss  and  other  dissident  klansmen  were  meeting.  [53] \nThere  is  no  record  in  the  files  that  Rowe  ever  joined up  with \nChambliss  and  the  Cahaba  River  group. \nThe  Task  Force  interviewed  FBI  agents  who  were  in \nBirmingham  in  the  1960's  and  asked  whether  they  ever  suspected \nRowe  in  the  church  bombing  case  or  the  other  1963  Birmingham \nbombings. \nSAC  Ray  Faisst can  not  recall  Rowe  ever  being  connected \nwith  dynamiting  activity.  [54]  ASAC  Robert  Jensen  has  no  knowledge \nthat  any  Bureau  employee  ever  suspected  Rowe  as  being  involved \nin  the  Birmingham  bombings.  [55]  James  L.  McGovern,  who \narrived  in  Birmingham  in March,  1965,  and  became  the  SAC \nthere  at the  end  of  1965  never  heard  that  any  FBI  employee \n52.

[56] \nNor  did  any  of  the  non-supervisory  agents  the  ~ask Force  inter-\nviewed  suspect  Rowe  personally  or  hear  that  any  other  FBI  person \nsuspected  him,  [57]  except  Neil  Shanahan  who  reaalled there \nmay  have  been  some  general  speculation  in  the  Birmingham  office \nof  Rowe's  involvement  in  the  Birmingham  bombings.  [58]  Former \nSpecial  Agent  .Melton  Alexander,  who  took  charge  of  the  Birming-\nham  office's  investigation of  the  church  bombing  in  1965, \nrecalls  that  the  FBI  considered  everyone  who  was  connected \nwith  the  klan  as  a  suspect  in  the  case.  Thus  Rowe  who  was \nostensibly  a  klan  member  was  not  eliminated  as  a  suspect merely \nbecause  of  his  informant  status.  [59] \n3.  The  Center  Street  Bombings \nAt  about  1:30  a.m.,  September  25,  1963,  an  explosion  in \nthe  vicinity  of  1601 ยทcenter  Street was  reported  to  the  Birming-\nham  police.  Fifteen minutes  later,  a  second  explosion went \noff  in  the  street  and  blew  a  three  by  two  foot  hole,  18  inches \ndeep,  into  the  pavement.  The  force  of  the  blast  sheared  off \na  wood  light pole  which  fell  back  into  a  vacant  lot,  and  sent \nchunks  of  curbing  and  sidewalk  flying.  The  second  bomb  had  been \n56.

[60]  This  material was  later  found \nembedded  in the  sides  of  seven  neighboring  homes.  Some  of  it \nhad  shot  into  nearby  houses,  breaking windows  and  damaging \ni \nsiding.  Miraculously,  no  one  was  hurt. \nThe  FBI's  investigation  revealed  that  the  first  explosion \nwas  a  \"noisemaker,\"  designed  to  attract  a  crowd  of  people  (it \nwas  an  all black  neighborhood)  and  police  to be  cut  down  by \nthe  shrapnel  bomb  which  went  off  seconds  later.  [61]  A  crowd \nof  onlookers  did  come  out  of  the  houses  after the  first  bomb \nwent  off,  but  somehow,  narrowly  escaped  injury. \nSpecial  Agent  Harry  T.  Posey  was  assigned  to  the  desk \nthat  night  at  the  FBI  field  office.  At  1:33  a.m.,  he  heard \na  Birmingham  Police  Department  broadcast  reporting  on  the  first \nCenter  Street explosion.  One  minute  later,  Tommy  Rowe  called \nin  to  inform  the  office  that  he  was  in  the  area,  had  heard  an \nexplosion,  and would  rush  to  the  bombing  site.

While  they  talked,  Rowe  heard  another \nexplosion  but  could  not  tell  from  where  the  noise  came.  [63] \nIn  his  February  21,  1979,  interview,  Rowe  recalled \nBirmingham  Police  Officers  J.  D.  Allred  and  James, Vines  driving \nr \nup  to  a  phone  booth  and  asking  him  about  the  explosion.  [64] \nWhen  asked what  he  was  doing  in  an  all black  neighborhood, \nRowe  explained  that  he  had  to  take  Sixth  Avenue  South  to \ndrive  his  girlfriend,  Helen  Metcalf,  back  to  her  apartment.  [65] \nRowe  said heยท called the  FBI  office  to  report  that  he  heard what \nhe  thought  to be  a  bomb.  \"And  while  I  was  on  the  telephone, \nanother  bomb  went  off.\"  [66] \nLater  that  night,  Rowe  called  the  Birmingham  Police \nDepartment  and  learned  that  Officers  Vines  and  Allred wanted \nto talk  to  Rowe  again.  [67]  Knowing  he  had  seen  them  on \noccasion  at the  Disabled  Veterans  Hall,  he  told the  department \nswitchboard  operator  that  he  would  stop  by  there  on .the  way \nhome . .

McFall \nreports  that  Rowe  saw  them  there,  but  for  some  unexplained \nreason,  they  were  unable  to  talk  because  a  Police \nBirmi~gham \nDepartment  official  came  in  and  sat down  with  them.  [69] \nRowe  reported  the  above  to McFall  at  8:45  the  morning \nafter  the  Center  Street bombing  on  September  25,  1963.  McFall \nasked  him  about  Chambliss.  Rowe  replied  that  Chambliss  had \nnot  been  attending  klavern meetings  lately  and  had  \"no  infor-\nmation  whatsoever  indicating  Chambliss  [was]  responsible  for \nor  has  any  information  about  the  recent  bombings.\"  [70]  He \npromised  to  keep  trying  to  find  out who  was  responsible.  [71] \nEarlier  in  the  year,  March  24,  1963,  Rowe  had  similarly \ngiven  the  FBI  an  immediate  report  of  a  bombing  at  the  home \nof  Elizabeth  Williams,  also  in  an  all black  neighborhood. \nSpecial  Agent  McFall  said  Rowe  was  able  to  report  it so \nquickly  because  Rowe  received  the  report  from  one  of  his \npolice  contacts.

However,,  in April,  1964, \nf \nSpecial  Agent  Blake  reinterviewed  Rowe  about  the  Center  Street \nbombing.  [73]  His  memorandum  states  that when  Rowe  met  Vines \nand  Allred  on  September  28,  1963,  they  said  that  they  did  not \nmind  the  klan  \"killing Negroes,  but  don't  get  us,\"  [74]  which \nimplies  that they  could  have  suspected  Rowe  was  involved  and \nwere  merely  warning  the  klan  and  Rowe  to  be  more  careful  about \ntheir  bombing  targets. \nSpecial  Agent  McFall  told us  that  he  did  not  suspect  Rowe \nin  the  Center  Street bombings  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  Rowe \nwas  near where  a  bomb  exploded.  This  suggested  to  McFall  that \nRowe  was: \ndoing  a  good  job  if he's  there  somewhere  where \nhe's  knowing  what's  going  on.  There  would  be  no \npercentage  in  him  trying  to  commit  violence.  He \nwouldn't  gain  anything  by  it.  [75] \nIn  contrast  to  the  16th  Street  Church  bombing,  Rowe  provided \nthe  FBI  with  useful  information  about  the  Center  Street bombing. \nOn  October  7,  1963,  he  told Agent  McFall  that  \"Huey  Lipscomb\" \nhad  told  Rowe  and  other  klansmen  in  December,  1962,  how  to make \n73.

Lipscomb  explained  that  a  person  could  take \nan  old  tool  box  and  fill  it with  iron  and  nails  which,  when \nused with  an  explosive  could  \"hurt  a  lot of  niggers.\"[76] \nSeven  months  later,  FBI  agents  interviewed  Rowe  qbout  the  1963 \nBirmingham  bombings,  and  Rowe  stated that only  three  days  before \nthe  church  bombing  and  thirteen  days  before  the  Center  Street \nbombings,  Rowe  had  heard  a  group  of  klansmen  discussing  shrapnel \nbombs. \nDuring  this  conversation  CHAMBLISS  made  the \nstatement,  which  [Rowe]  heard,  that  \"two  bombs  should \nbe  made,  one  to  draw  out  the  'niggers'  and  the  other \nto  kill them\" โขโข.โข  [Klansman]  Walker  again  asked  how \nto make  a  shrapnel  bomb  and  [Lipscomb]  said  that  an \nold  syrup  can  or  tool  box  loaded with  nails,  bolts, \nand  other metal  fragments  and  1/2  stick of  dynamite \n\"would  really make  a  mess.\"  [77] \nThe  Task  Force  found  no  record  that  Rowe  provided  this \ninformation  to  the  FBI  until  at  least  seven  months  after the \nCenter  Street  shrapnel  bombings.  Nor  did we  find  any  record \nin  FBI  files  that  any  FBI  official  asked  why  this  report was \nnot  filed  at  the  time  of  the  klavern meeting  on  September  12, \n1963.

He  had  been \ndrinking  and  was  driving  alone.  He  rounded  a  curve,  looked \nup,  and  saw  a  crowd  of  black  people  milling  about  the  street; \nsome  were  pounding  on  a  taxi;  others  were  dragging  a  woman \nout  the  taxi's  door.  He  saw  a  group  beating  up  a  white  man \nand  throwing  bricks.  Suddenly,  a  brick  smashed  his  rear \nview  mirror  to  his  left.[3] \nAnd  I  looked  this way,  I  saw  a  great big  ass \nblack man--at  that  time,  I'd say  he  was  about  my \nsize.

McFall  replied  that \nit is  \"an  absolute  falsehood.  He  never  did  tell me.  If he \nhad,  it'd been  written up.

[17]  I  don't  think  that \nany  part of  this  statement  is  true.  And  I  don't \nknow  how  to  account  for  it,  except  that he  might \njust have  been  trying  to  set himself  up.  But  the \nfact  remains  that  he  didn't  tell me,  and  -- even \nthough  he  apparently  is  trying  to  cut under  me  -- I \nwould  suggest  that  I  wouldn't  even  consider  that \nhe'd be  in  a  position  to  kill anybody. \nQuestion:  And  why  do  you  say  that? \nMcFall:  I  just don't  think  he  would,  with  the \ntraining  that we  gave  him.  He  just understood  that \nhe  wasn't  to  engage  in  any  violence  to  that extent.  [18] \nFormer  Special  Agent  J.

A  lot of \nth.is  we  took  with ยทa  grain  of  salt or bragging.

I  would  have  to  go \nby  his  testimony  or what  you  already  know.  I  can't \nplace  any  period  of  time.  It didn't happen  while  I \nwas  handling  him. \nQuestion:  Did  he  tell you  that  story while  you \nwere  handling  him? \nMr.  Blake:  I  don't  recall  specifically.

Did  you \never  hear  that  story? \nMr.  Blake:  No.  Maybe  he  did  the  shooting  or many \nof  the  shootings  he  was  referring  to. \nQuestion:  But  you  never  heard  specifically  that \nhe  killed  a  black  man? \nQuestion:  He  never  told you  that  he  had  shot  somebody \nin  that  general  vicinity back  in  those  days? \nMr.  Blake:  He  never  told me  specifically.

Shanahan  recalled  Rowe  recounting  the \nstory  \"many  times  โข  five  or  six  times.\"  [21]  When \nasked  what  he  did  about  it,  Shanahan  replied  that he  did \nnothing  except  ask  other  agents  whether  it was  true  and \nwhat  to  do  about  it.

[28] \nThe  Task  Force  did  not  locate  any  reference  to \nthis  alleged  shooting  incident  in  Rowe's  informant  file  or  in \nany  other  FBI  file.  Nor  did  we  locate  any  information  that \nthe  FBI  ever  conducted  an  inquiry  into  the  circumstances \nsurrounding  the  shooting,  into  Rowe's  alleged  involvement, \nor'-  into  the  condition  or whereabouts  of  the  victim. \nOn  April  4,  1979,  the  Task  Force  spoke  with  James  O. \nButler of  Birmingham who  had  been  Jefferson  County's  coroner \nfrom  1951-1976.  Throughout  this  twenty-five  year  period, \nButler was  solely  responsible  for  examining  the  corpses  of \nall victims  of  alleged  homicide  occurring  in  Birmingham  and \nJefferson  County.  We  recounted  the  above  report  of  the  Rowe \nshooting  and  asked  him  to  review  all  autopsy  reports  filed \n2 6.  Id. \n27.  Id.,  209. \n28.

A  black man  by  the  name \nof  John  L.  Coley  was  shot  dead  the  night  Arthur  Shore's  home \nwas  bombed  on  September  4,  1963,  but  he  was  clearly  the \nvictim of  a  shotgun  blast,  Butler  reported.  \"It was \ndefinitely  not  a  .38.\"  [29]  The  former  coroner  also  found  a \nreport  on  a  Thomas  Lyman,  a  black man  injured  in  the  back  of \nthe  head  that  night,  but  because  that  report  indicated Lyman \nwas  hit with  a  piece  of  mortar  or  cement,  it did  not  appear \nin  any  way  to  correspond  to  Rowe's  story. \nButler  could  not  recall  ever  being  contacted  about  the \nincident  by  the  FBI,  and  there was  no  notation  in  the  coro-\nner's  office  file,  he  said,  that  agents  had  ever  done  so. \n[30]  He  was  certain  that  he  would  have  examined  all homi-\ncide  victims  in  1963  and  suggested  that  if Rowe's  account \ndid  in  fact  happen,  the  shobting  did  not  result  in  the  black \nman's  death.  Had  he  been  wounded,  Rowe's  victim could  have \nbeen  treated  at  any  one  of  over  a  half  dozen  hospitals,  and \nrecords  of  such  treatment,  now  over  fifteen  years  old,  would \nbe  virtually  impossible  to  find. \n29.

JANUARY  1964  - MARCH  24,  1965 \nBy  January,  1964,  the  Birmingham  office  had  expanded \nits  investigation of  the  1963  bombings,  and  especially, \nthe  church  bombing,  by  putting more  agents  on  the 1case. \nKnowing  the  importance  of  obtaining more  intelligence  on \nkey  klan  suspects,  the  Bureau  also  began  to  devote  more \nattention  and  resources  to  developing  additional  infor \nmants  within Eastview  13  and  related klaverns. \nFor  the  first  time,  the  Bureau  had  informants  who \nbegan  to  report  effectively on  Gary  Thomas  Rowe's  activi \nties.  While  the  record  does  not  indicate  that  the  FBI \ninstructed  these  new  informants  to watch  Rowe, [l]  they \nwere  told  to  report on  all klan  activities.  Two  of  them, \nwhom  we  will  identify  here  as  Robin  Huffman  and  Huey \nLipscomb  in order  to  protect  them  and  their  families  from \nklan  retaliation,  became  quite  close  to  Rowe.  By  contrast, \nthe  informants  reporting  on  Eastview  13  before  1964  were \nnever  close  enough  to  Rowe  to  report  useful  information \nabout  him.  In  this  section,  we  examine  eleven  separate \nincidents  in which  the  FBI  received  information  from  Rowe \nand  others. \nA.  The  Request  for  Blasting Caps \nOn  February  7,  1964,  Rowe  told  his  handling  agent  J. \nBrooke  Blake  in person  that klansman  William Holt  asked \n1.  Robin  Huffman  Interview by  Task  Force,  Feb.  3,  1979,  2. \n- 105  -\n\nRowe  a  day  earlier  if he  had  some  electric blasting  caps, \nused  to  ignite dynamite  sticks.[2]  As  Rowe  told Blake, \nHolt  and  other Eastview members  knew  that a  Warrior  klans-\nman  had  provided  Rowe  with  a  case  of  blasting  caps  the \n.  r \nprevious  year  and  that Rowe  had  the  caps  at the  time  of \nthe  1963  Birmingham bombings.  Rowe  told  Holt  that he \nstill had  some.  Holt wanted  four,  and  instructed  Rowe \nto  give  them  to  him  on  February  8,  1964,  at  the  UKA  Klan-\nvocation  in  Birmingham. \nThe  day  of  the  Klonvocation  at the  Tutwiler  Hotel, \nRowe  telephoned  Holt  and  asked  if he  still needed  the \nblasting  caps. [3]  Holt  again  said he  wanted  four.  Later \nin  the  day,  Rowe  approached  Holt  personally  at the  Tutwiler \nHotel,  and  told  him  he  the  blasting  caps  in his  right \nh~d \ninside  coat  pocket.  Holt  refused  to take  them  because  he \nsaid  \"he  (Holt)  was  hotter  than  a  firecracker,\"[4]  and \ntold  Rowe  he  would  have  someone  else  pick  them  up.  And \nso  Rowe  gave  the  blasting  caps  to  a  Bessemer  klansman, \nnamed  \"Big  John\"  Burnette. [5] \nRowe  told  the  Task  Force  that Blake  and  another  agent \nfollowed  Rowe,  Eugene  Thomas,  and  \"Big  John\"  Burnette  out \n2.

Thomas  took  out \nhis  gun  and  told  Rowe  that he  was  going  to  kill Blake. [6] \n\"I  am  going  to  kill  the  son-of-a-bitch.  He's  screwing  me \nhis  last time.\"[7]  Rowe  prevented  the  incident  by  \"pro \n< \nvoking  a  fight\"  with  Blake  and  by  saying,  \"Hey  you  want \nto  fight,  cock  sucker,  you  fight  me.  You  know  I'll whip \nyour  goddamn  ass.\"[8]  Both  Rowe  and  Blake  believe  that \nRowe  may  have  kept  Thomas  from  shooting  Blake. [9] \nFBI  Reaction \nWhile  the  Birmingham  off ice  did  inform  Headquarters \nabout  much  of  this  incident,  the  SAC  did  not  advise  his \nsuperiors  in Washington  when  seeking  further  payments  for \nRowe  that  Rowe  had  blasting  caps  in  his  possession. [10] \nNothing  in  the  files  indicates  that  the  FBI  asked \nRowe  why  he  acquired  blasting  caps  or whether  he  ever \nused  them.  However,  Special  Agent  Blake  recalls  that \nRowe  told him  that  he  kept  the  blasting  caps  as  a  \"cover.\" \nThus  this  event  did  not  trigger  a  suspicion  that  Rowe  was \n6.

Rowe  \"Would  Go\" \nOn  March  18,  1964,  J.  Brooke  Blake  showed  Rowe's  picture \nto  an  informant,  Wylam  Pratt.  The  informant  commented  that \nRowe  was  an: \nEastview  Klavern  member,  known  to  be  dangerous, \nhas  two  carbines  in  his  possession,  and  [Pratt]  had \nheard  WILLIAM  HOLT  say  [Rowe]  \"would  go.\"[11] \nFBI  Reaction \nThe  Bureau  files  do  not  indicate  how  Birmingham  reacted \nto  this  report  or whether  it was  communicated  to  Headquarters. \nSpecial  Agent  Blake  told  the  Task  Force  that  he  did  not  react \nto  Pratt's  report  that  Rowe  was  known  to  be  dangerous  because, \n\"I  knew  it myself.\"[12]  Blake  understood  that  in klan  termi-\nnology,  the  phrase  \"would  go\"  meant  that  Rowe  would  fight, \ntake  part  in  an  action  squad,  and  commit  violence. [13]  Blake \ncould  not  recall  telling  else  about  the  report  that \n~nyone \nRowe  was  \"dangerous,\"  and  although  he  did  copy  the  report \nto  six other  files,  he  failed  to  include  it in  Rowe's. \nBlake  said: \nNo,  heck,  it was  common  knowledge  among  agents \nabout  his  mannerisms.

Rowe's  Leadership  on  the  Action  Squad \nOn  March  12,  1964,  Rowe  reported  to  Brooke  Blake  that \n( \nExalted  Cyclops  [Klavern  leader]  Robert  Thomas  had  just assigned \nhim  to  one  of  two  squads  who  would  serve  Imperial  Wizard  Robert \nShelton  as  \"special  or  trouble\"  squads  in  case  black  protest \ndemonstrations  broke  out  in either Birmingham  or  Bessemer. [15] \nOn  March  26,  1964,  at an  Eastview  13  meeting,  Rowe  was  instructed \nthat he  would  be  in  charge  of  such  a  squad  at a  Billy  Graham \nreligious  service.  Rowe  reported  that  the  Eastview  leadership \nselected  Rowe  to  \"captain\"  not  only  this  squad,  but  five  others \nin the  klavern. [16]  Also,  Robert  Thomas  told  Rowe  that  a  tough \nnew  contingent  of  Eastview  recruits,  considered  \"head-knockers,\" \nhad  been  assigned  to  Rowe's  action  squad. [17]  The  FBI  was  aware \nthat  an  action  squad  was  a  \"violence  squad\"  designed  to  handle \nall  \"major  operations\"  for  the  klan  including  floggings,  bombings, \nand  harassment,  which  could,  theoretically,  result  in  jail \nsentences  for  the  participants.

They  were  to  patrol white  areas  of  Birmingham \nlooking  for  black  youths.  Tidwell  stated: \nI  want  the .Negroes  terrorized  for  being  in \nthe  areas  where  they  don't  beldng.

As  partial \njustification,  Birmingham  stated  that  Rowe: \n[H]as  recently  been  assigned  as  the  squad  leader \nof  \"Squad  Number  One,\"  which  squad  is  the  \"Action \nSquad\"  and  he  was  placed  in  this  position  at  instruc \ntions  of  Imperial  Wizard,  ROBERT  M.

[24]  Headquarters  asked  a  number  of 1questions \nabout  Rowe's  duties  as  a  Squad  including whether  the \nL~ader, \nsquad was  considered  violent  and  demanded  a  response  before \nauthorizing more  informant  payments  to  Rowe. [25]  Birmingham \nreplied  the  very  next  day,  April  14,  1964. [26]  Rowe  told  the \nagents  that  as  leader,  he  had  the  power  to  take  action without \nobtaining  approval  from  some  high  authority  in  the  klan.  Also, \nas  squad  leader,  he  made  policy.[27]  Rowe  stressed,  however, \nto  the  FBI  questioners  that he  was  in  the  klan  \"to keep  acts \nยท of  violence  down.\"[28]  Finally,  Rowe  stated that he  could \nnot  have  refused  his  assignment  as  action  squad  leader,  a \nposition  he  did  not  seek,  \"without  compromising\"  himself, \nmeaning  that he  was  afraid klansmen  would  suspect him  of \nbeing  a  government  informant  if he  refused  to  serve  in posi-\ntions  to which  the  klan  leadership  appointed  him.

[35] \nIf  the  klan  asked  Rowe  to  take  part in violence,  Head-\nquarters  instructed  the  field  office  to make  sure  Rowe  contacted \nhis  handling  agent  for  guidance.

Blake  recalled  that  this  issue  frustrated  him \nbecause: \nOne  year  somebody  said,  \"Well,  why  isn't he \nleader?  Why  isn't he  higher  up  in  the  klan?''  and \nthe  next  year,  somebody  would  say,  \"Let's  not  have \nhim  in  this  position.\" \nBlake  conceded  that both  Rowe  and  he  were  unhappy  with  the \nHeadquarter's  instructions  and  \"procrastinat[ed]  and  bitch[ed]\" \nabout  them.[40]  But  Blake  was  certain  that he  passed  the \norder  on  to  Rowe.  In  fact,  he  recalls  that he  may  have  shown \nRowe  the  Headquarter's  directive.  However,  Blake  admitted: \nIt might  have  been  the  manner  in which  I \nsaid--just knowing  my  relationship with  him- \nthat  could  have  led  him  to  believe  that  I  was \nsaying  one  thing,  but  giving  acquiescence  to \nanything  else  he  did.  That wouldn't  alter my \nearlier testimony  that he  was  not  to  initiate \nor  instigate  acts  of  violence.[41] \nBlake's  frustration with  the  Headquarter's  May  4,  1964, \ndirective may  have  been  based  on  his  concern  that the  klan \nwas  about  to  use  even  more  violent -means  to  block  integration. \nIn  his  April  8,  1964,  request  for  authority  to  cont.inue  pay-\nments  to  Rowe,  Blake  noted  that Robert  Creel,  the  Grand \nDragon  of Alabama,  had  recently  told  an  Eastview  13  meeting \nthat  \"he  was  tired of  backtracking\"[42]  and  that  if klansmen \ndid  not want  to  \"bust  ass  and  kill niggers,\"[43]  they  should \n40.

When  Rowe  was  removed  ~rom a \nleadership  position,  he  may  have  thus  lost a  unique  opportunity \nto  learn  about  serious  violence  the  klan  planned  for  the  coming \nyear. \nThe  Task  Force  spoke  with  Joseph  Deegan,  the  Headquarters \nofficial who  drafted  the  instructions  to  Birmingham  about \nRowe's  involvement  on  the  action  squad. [44]  We  asked  Deegan \nif the  May  4  Airtel was  intended  to  absolutely  prohibit  Rowe \nfrom  taking  part  in violence.  Deegan  explained  that although \nthe  Airtel  did  not  in  so  many  words  prohibit  absolutely  Rowe's \nparticipation  in violence,  such  an  intent was  nevertheless \nclear. \nD.  Beating  of  Blacks \nOn  May  18,  1964,  FBI  informant  \"Huey  Lipscomb\"  reported \nthat on  May  14,  1964,  Rowe  and  five  or  six other klansmen \nattended  a  baseball  game  at an  integrated park  and  did  \"some \nmissionary  work  among  Negroes  seated  in  integrated  seats.\"[45] \nBirmingham  immediately  passed  this  information  on  to  Head-\nquarters. [46]  On  June  4,  1964,  Special  Agent  Robert  Murphy \nclarified what  Lipscomb  meant  about  \"missionary work,\"  and \nconcluded,  that Rowe  and  others  \"beat  up  several  Negroes.\"[47] \n44.

Also, \nhe  recalled knocking  down  and  stripping  a  policeman  of  his  gun \nand  added  that he  frequently  fought  and  raised  hell  on  his \n\"own  time\"[50]  which  was  not  reported  to  the  FBI  because  he \n\"didn't  think  it was  none  of  their business.\"(51] \nSpecial  Agent  Blake  certified Rowe's  continuing  stability \nand  reliability on  August  14,  1964,  and  failed  to mention  in \nhis  quarterly  report  on  Rowe  that  he  had  beยทen  seen  beating  up \nblacks  at the  ball park  only  three months  earlier.

[53] \nE.  Buying  Weapons \nOn  May  22,  1964,  Lipscomb  reported  that  on  the  previous \nevening,  Rowe  asked  him  for  $50,  so  that  he  could  buy,  for  the \naction  squad,  a  high-powered  rifle,  machine  gun,  sniper-scope, \nand  infrared  field  glasses,  after obtaining  $300  from  action \nsquad  members. [54] \nFBI  Reaction \nSpecial  Agent  Brooke  Blake  could  not  recall  anyone  telling \nhim  about  Rowe's  raising money  for  action  squad  weapons.  Had \nhe  been  told  about  it,  he: \n[C]ouldn't  go  back  and  interview  Rowe  specifically \nabout  things  that  [Lipscomb]  had  said,  or  else  it would \nhave  surfaced. the  fact  to  Rowe  that  [Lipscomb]  was  an \ninformant.

[56] \nBlake  said he  expected  Rowe  to  tell him  about  such  things \nand  would  have  likely put  this  information  in  Rowe's  infor-\nmant  file. [57]  However,  Rowe's  file  fails  to  contain  any \nsuch  information. \nJoseph  Deegan  said  that  Lipscomb's  report,  even  if \naccurate,  did  not  indicate  that  Rowe  was  still acting  as  a \nleader  on  the  action  squad. [58] \nF.  Trip  to  Tuscaloosa \nAfter  receiving  a  telephone  call  from  Robert  Thomas, \nRowe  notified  the  FBI  that he  had  been  instructed  to  go  to \nTuscaloosa  to meet  blacks  who  were  going  to march  on  a  store. \nThomas  told  Rowe  that  Robert  Shelton,  who  had  ordered  Rowe  to \ngo  to  Tuscaloosa,  had  indicated  that  \"he  wouldn't  be  surprised \n56.

Rowe  mentioned  that  some  whites \nattacked  several  blacks,  but  his  report  to  Blake  says  nothing \nabout:  (1)  Rowe  attacking  a  newspaper  man;  (2)  his  talking  about \nsnake  throwing  with  Robert  Thomas;  and  (3)  his  carrying  a \npistol  and  rifle on  the  trip.

Creel's  presence  was  confirmed  by  another  FBI  infor-\nmant  we  shall  call  Fulton  Roebuck.

However,  there  is  no  record  that  the  office  sent  it \nto Washington.  Rather  on  July  9,  1964,  in  a  memorandum  from \nthe  SAC  to  the  Director,  Womack  sought  authority  to  continue \nto  pay  Huffman,  and  neglected  to  say  anything  about  the \nincident.

Thus,  in  our  interviews,  we  concentrated  on  how \nthe  Birmingham  office  reacted  to  Huffman's  report  on  Rowe. \nWomack  told  the  Task  Force  that  although  he  gave  a  copy \nof  the  report  to  Rowe's  handling  agent,  J.  Brooke  Blake,  he \nwas  under  no  obligation  to  police  the  informants  for  whom \nother  agents  were  responsible.[86]  In  passing,  he  added  that \nRowe,  as  an  informant,  should  not  have  committed  the  violence \nwhich  Huffman  attributed  to  him--\"or  at least he  should  have \ndone  it so  that no  one  would  have  seen  him.\"[87]  We  asked \nWomack  why  he  did  not mention  either  Rowe's  \"newspaperman \nattack\"  or  the  \"snake  incident\"  in his  July  29,  1964,  report \non  the  church  bombing  investigation;  Womack  replied  that  these \nincidents  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  church  bombing.  Womack \nwas  unable  to  explain why  he  nonetheless  included  Huffman's \nreport  on  whites  beating  up  blacks  during  the  July  4,  1964, \nAtlanta  rally.[88] \nSpecial  Agent  Blakeยท told  the  Task  Force  that he  did  not \nchastise  Rowe  after  seeing  Huffman's  report  of  the  Atlanta \ntrip.  He  explained: \n{T]he  mission  of  the  FBI  was  not  to  chastise \ninformants  for  punching  somebody,  it was  to  be \nin  a  position  to  solve  bombings  and  to  predict \n86.

Blake  would  not  have  done \nanything  else  to  Rowe[92]  such  as  reporting  him  to  local \nenforcement  officials or  recommending  his  termination  as  an \ninformant. \nH.  Rowe's  Status  as  a  Confidential  Informant \nIn mid-1964,  the  klan's  smouldering  suspicions  that  Rowe \nwas  an  FBI  informant  began  to  heat  up.  In  June,  Robert  Thomas \ntold Huffman  to  investigate  Rowe  for  that purpose. [93]  At  the \nsame  time,  William Holt,  an  active  klansman  and  one  of  those \nwho  recruited  Rowe  into  the  klan,  talked  about  Rowe  with \nHuffman.

They  failed  to  produce  any \nevidence  and  the  matter  died. [97]  The  Bureau  received  a \nsimilar,  although  second  hand,  account  of  the  meeting  from \nHuffman.[98]  Rowe's  version  of  the'  hearing  was  more  detailed \nand  was  forwarded  to  Headquarters  ori  July  20,  1964.[99]  Rowe \nreported  that he  tore  open  William Holt's  shirt and  slapped  his \nface,  after  Rowe  became  angry  that Holt  had  denied  having \naccused  Rowe  of  being  an  informant. \nThis  was  apparently  the  last serious  effort  to  expose \nhim  as  an  informant  until  he  surfaced  after  the  Liuzzo  killing. \n94.

[101] \nHe  could  not  accurately  list all  the  weapons  he  had  seen,  he \nsaid,  but  he  could  remember  klansmen  with  .38,  .22,  and  .45 \ncaliber pistols;  a  .45  caliber  automatic  pistol;  Ml  semi-\nautomatic  carbines;  hand  grenades;  M2  carbines;  .22  caliber \nrifles;  double  barrel  shotguns;  a  Thompson  .45  caliber sub-\nmachine  gun;  a  burp  gun;  303  Enfield  rifles;  dynamite;  .a  .44 \ncaliber magnum  pistol;  a  flare  gun;  and  blasting  caps.

The  Flame  Club  rncident \nOn  September  26,  _1964,  Rowe  reported  that he  and  several \nother  Eastview 13  Klavern members  drove  over  to  the  Bessemer \nKlavern  to  discuss  what  they  should  do  about  an  i!f tegrated \nnightclub,  named  the  Flame  Club.[104]  Rowe,  Eugene  Thomas, \nand  another  klansmen  then  drove  to  the  club,  and  found  blacks \nand  whites  sitting and  dancing  together.  They  left,  and  Thomas \ncalled  a  Lieutenant  Barnes  of  the  Bessemer  Police,  who  obliged \nThomas  with  dynamite,  a  submachine  gun, ยทand  hand  grenades  \"to \nremedy\"  the  Flame  Club  situation,  according  to  Rowe's  informant \nreport.[105]  The  men  joined  other  klansmen  and  returned  to \nthe  Flame  Club  only  to  find  several  Fairfield Police  cars \nparked  in  front  of  the  club.  The  klan  thus  abandoned  the  plan \nGene  Thomas  had  devised  to  explode  dynamite  at  the  rea~ of  the \nclub  and  to  fire  at fleeing  patrons  with  automatic  weapons.[106] \nLater,  the  plan was  revived,  apparently  by  Robert  Thomas, \nonly  to  be  dropped  at  the  order  of  Robert  Shelton,  Imperial \nWizard.

[109]  The \nFairfield Police  happened  on  the  Flame  Club  by  coincidence \nI \nonly;  they  were  apparently  arresting  several  blacks  for \nunrelated matters. [110] \nFBI  Reaction \nAfter  the  FBI  received  its  first report  from  Rowe  that \nthe  klan  had  attempted  to  attack  the  Flame  Club,  the  Birmingham \noffice  spoke  with  the  Fairfield Police  and  notified unstated \n\"appropriate  law  enforcement  agencies.\"[111]  Also,  Headquarters \nadvised  Birmingham  to  inform  the  owner  of  the  Flame  Club, [112] \nwhich  was  done  on  October  1,  1964.

The  Klokan  Conunittee \nOn  December  10,  1964,  Rowe  was  elected as  Klokan  Chief  for \nEastview  13. [115]  The  Klokan  Corrunittee  generally was  charged \nwith  investigating  new  klan members  and  protecting klan \nsecurity.[116]  However,  shortly  after  Rowe's  selection  the \nBureau  learned  that  the  conunittee  had  other  duties.  On \nDecember  22,  1964,  Huey  Lipscomb  advised  Agents  Shanahan  and \nMurphy  that  in  1963  the  Eastview  13  Klokan  Conunittee  was \ncomposed  of  Eugene  Reeves,  Earl  Thompson  and  Rowe. [117] \nLipscomb  reported  that during  that period  \"any  violence which \ncame  from  Eastview  Klavern  13  would  have  to  be  okayed  by \nall three  of  these  individuals\"  including,  of  course,  Rowe \n[emphasis  added] .[118] \n115.

The  Bureau  file \n( \ndoes  not  indicate  that  anyone:  (1)  asked  Rowe  if the  Klokan \nCommittee  approved  all  Eastview violence  in  1964  as  well  as \n1963;  (2)  cautioned  Rowe  not  to  approve  or take  part  in violence \nin his  capacity  as  Klokan  Chief;  (3)  told  Rowe  to  resign  from \nhis  position  as  Klokan  Chief;  (4)  told  Headquarters  about \nRowe's  elevation  to  Klokan  Chief;  or  (5)  found  out  whether \nRowe  was  complying  with  the  Director's  order  that  he  not \ndirect or  instigate violence. [119] \nThe  Task  Force  questioned  Agent  Shanahan  about  this  report. \nShanahan  concluded  that  the  report was  merely  Lipscomb's \n\"analysis  of  the  situation.\"[120]  He  admitted  that  Lipscomb's \nstatement  about  Rowe's  approval  role  in violence  would  not \nhave  gotten  him  \"too  excited,\"[121]  and  did  not  affect  his \nattitude  about  Rowe.

ROWE  AND  EASTVIEW  13  INFORMANT  \"HUEY  LIPSCOMB\" \nThe  Task  Force  attempted  to  place  the  FBI's  handling  of \nGary  Thomas  Rowe  in  perspective  by  examining  how  the  Bureau \nhandled  several  other  klan  informants.  One  of  tmese  indivi-\nduals  shall  be  referred  to  as  \"Huey  Lipscomb\".  From  1963  to \n1965,  the  FBI  paid  him  to  inform on  the  activities  of  fellow \nklansmen.  By  focusing  on  Rowe  and  Lipscomb,  however,  we  are \nnot  suggesting  that  they  are  representative  of  the  informants \nthe  FBI  had  developed  in  the  Alabama  Ku  Klux  Klan  at this \ntime.  Most  of  the  informant  files  we  examined  indicate  that \nthe  informants  themselves  did  not  take  part  in  violent  or \nillegal  activities. \nA.  Lipscomb's  Background \nBefore  engaging  Lipscomb,  then  37  years  old,  as  an \ninformant,  the  FBI  examined  his  criminal  record  and  discovered \nthat he  had  been  arrested  at  least  eleven  times,  all prior \nto  his  twenty-eighth  birthday. [l] \nIn  1943,  he  was  arrested  for  burglary  and  larceny, \ngiven  a  suspended  sentence  and  fined  $50.  Three  years \nlater,  he  was  charged with  grand  larceny,  but  released  the \nday  after his  arrest.  In  1947,  he  was  again  arrested  and \ncharged with  burglary  and  grand  larceny  and  put  on  probation \nfor  three  years.  Shortly  before  his  probation  expired,  he \nwas  arrested  for  theft of  goods  from  interstate  commerce,  and  put \non  five  years  probation.  Finally,  in  1954,  he  was  charged with \n1.  Report  of  SA  Neil  P.  Shanahan,  Sept.  30,  1965;  BH  157-356-190; \nTask  Force  4272. \n- 133  -\n\nassault with  intent  to murder.  The  FBI  files  do  not  indicate \nthe  disposition  of  the  case. \nIn  December  1961,  the  FBI  first  learned  that  Lipscomb, \nstill two  years  from  being  an  informant,  planned  to  participate \nt \nin  racial violence when  Rowe  reported  that  a  group  of  klansmen, \nincluding  Lipscomb,  were  plotting  to  destroy  a  desegregated \nHoliday  Inn  in  Knoxville,  Tennessee.  Fortunately,  city \nofficials were  alerted,  and  the  plan was  aborted. [2]  In \n1962,  Rowe  reported  that  the  klan  planned  to  attack  blacks \nwho  were  accompanying  civil  rights  leader,  Fred  L.  Shuttles-\nworth,  to  the  Dobbs  House  Restaurant  in  Birmingham.  Rowe \ninformed  his  handling  agent  that  the  klan  conspired  to \nencircle  Shuttlesworth  at  the  restaurant,  as  if to  beat  him \nup,  whereupon  Lipscomb  was  to  move  forward  and  stab  him  to \ndeath. \nIn  Rowe's  view,  Lipscomb  was  both willing  and  able  to \nkill Shuttlesworth.  [3]  Special  Agent  Murphy,  who  later became \nLipscomb's  handling  agent,  today  also  believes  Lipscomb  was \ncapable  of  killing,  but  only  if  \"he  had  to  prove  himself\"  to \nhis  klan  friends. [4]  The  FBI  warned  Rev.  Shuttlesworth  not \nto  go  near  the  Dobbs  House. \n2.  Report  of  SA  John  McCormack,  Nov.  14,  1963:  HQ  157-1131-1; \nTask  Force  2136. \n3.

Gaston  Motel  in  Birmingham \nwas  bombed,  and  downtown  department  store windows  were \nbroken  by  klansmen  who  were  upset  at  the  stores  for  deciding \nto  allow blacks  to work  there.  On  May  25,  1963,  FBI  agents \n( \ninterviewed  Lipscomb.  He  denied  any  wrongdoing[5],  but \nSpecial  Agent  Byron  McFall  refused  to  believe  him.  Three \nweeks  later,  McFall  reported  in  a  memorandum  to  the  SAC: \nIt seems  entirely  logical  that  [Lipscomb] \nmay  have  had  something  to  do  with  breaking  the \nwindows  in  the  Parisian  Department  Store,  and \nthat he  might  even  have  some  connection  with \nthe  [Gaston  Motel]  bombing. [6] \nOn  September  13,  1963,  the  Birmingham  office  opened  a \n\"157\"  [racial matters]  file  on  Lipscomb,  when  they  identified \nhim  as  a  suspect  in  the  bombing  of  Arthur  D.  Shores'  home  on \nSeptember  4,  1963. [7]  After  the  16th  Street  Baptist  Church \nwas  bombed,  eleven  days  later,  FBI  agents  again  interviewed \nhim.  Again,  Lipscomb  denied  any  involvement  in  the  church \nbombing  [8] ,  and  said he  had  no. information  on  the  matter.  He \nalso  denied  ever  owning  dynamite. \nB.

[11]  He  told  them  that he  was  at a \nt \nlocal  klan  hangout  on  September  4,  1963,  when  he  heard  that \nArthur  Shores'  home  had  been  bombed.  He  then  drove  to \nRobert  Chambliss'  home  and  removed  dynamite  from  the  trunk \nof  Chambliss'  car.  Lipscomb  and  klansman  Charles  Cagle  put \nthe  dynamite  in  Lipscomb's  car  and  brought  it to  a  field \nnear  a  dirt road  in Mount  Olive,  Alabama.  Several  days \nlater,  Lipscomb  learned  that  the  dynamite  was  missing. \nWhile  denying  that  he  knew  how  to  make  a  bomb,  Lipscomb \nadmitted  that  this  dynamite  \"could  have  possibly  been  used \nin  the  bombing  of  the  16th  Street  Baptist  Church\". [12] \nAt  about  this  time,  the  FBI  examined  Lipscomb  with  a \npolygraph  and  concluded  that he: \nwas  attempting  deception  and  ...  has  knowledge \nof  the  bombing  of  the  16th  Street  Baptist  Church \nand  may  have  participated  in  some  way  in  the \nbombing  or  the  planning  thereof.

[16] \nOn  November  16,  1963,  Lipscomb  received  his  first  informant \npayment  from  the  Bureau.  It was  a  check  for  $50.  In  the \nnext  seven  months,  the  Bureau  paid  him  an  additional  $150[17], \napparently  believing  that when  Lipscomb  accepted  FBI  money, \n\"he  realized  full  well  the  'hold'  agents  now  have  on  him.\"[18] \nSpecial  Agent  Murphy  told  the  Task  Force  that by  accepting \nBureau  money,  he  broke  his  klan  oath. and  thereby  ran  the \nrisk of  suffering  severe  retaliation,  including  death,  at \nthe  hands  of  other  klansmen.

The  Bureau's  Supervision  of  Lipscomb \nThe  FBI  recognized  that  Lipscomb  was  a  church  bombing \nsuspect while  working  as  an  FBI  informant.  [20]  Agents \nconsidered  him  valuable  because,  being  violent  nature,  he \nb~ \nhappened  to  run  with  violent  people.  \"[I]f you  want  to \ncatch  fish,  you've  got  to  go  into  the  water\"[21],  Agent \nMurphy  told us.  Accordingly,  Murphy  was  instructed  to  handle \nLipscomb  \"very  cautiously  and  very  warily\". [22]  The  handling \nagent  thus  followed  the  policy  of  \"reporting  everything\" \nabout  Lipscomb's  violent  activities[23],  except  \"how  much \nblood  ran  out  of  the  wound\". [24] \nD.  Lipscomb's  Knowledge  of  the  Birmingham  Bombings \nOn  October  7,  1963,  Rowe  reported  that  Lipscomb  had  talked \nabout  making  shrapnel  bombs  in  1962  which  \"could  hurt  a  lot \nof  niggers\". [25]  This  report  apparently  prompted  agents  to \nre-interview  Lipscomb,  which  they  did  on  October  16,  1963; \nbut  again  he  denied  ever  talking  about  making  a  shrapnel \nbomb  or even  knowing  how  to make  one.

Rowe  reported  that  at  the  meeting, \nLipscomb  boasted  to  Robert  Chambliss  about  how  he[Lipscomb] \n\"told you  guys  how  to make  a  bomb\". [27]  Lipscomb  also  filed \n( \nan  informant  report  on  the  October  30th meeting,  but  notably \nfailed  to mention  anything  about  telling  Chambliss  how  to \nmake  a  bomb. [28]  There  is  no  record  that  FBI  agents  ever \nquestioned  Lipscomb  and  Rowe  to  resolve  these  inconsistent \nreports. \nSeveral  days  later,  Rowe  and  Lipscomb  attended  another \nEastview  13  meeting.  According  to  Rowe's  report,  Lipscomb \nannounced  that  night  that  \"[I]  told  TROY  INGRAM,  ROBERT \nCHAMBLISS,  and  BILL  HOLT  how  to make  a  shrapnel  bomb\"[29], \nin obvious  reference  to  the  type  of  bomb  which  went  off  at \nCenter  Street  and  Sixth  Avenue  on  the  night  of  September  25, \n1963. \nThe  Birmingham  SAC  reported  some  of  Lipscomb's \nincriminating  statements  to  Headquarters  on  February  7,  1964. \n[30]  In  his  interview with  the  Task  Force,  Special  Agent \n27.

[33]  Rowe \nidentified  Lipscomb  as  one  of  four  suspects  in  the  August  20,  1963 \nbombing  of  the  home  of  Arthur  Shores,  a  prominent  black  at-\ntorney.  [34]  Rowe  fingered  Lipscomb  as  having  helped  build \nthe  shrapnel  bomb  which  exploded  at  Center  Street  and  Sixth \nAvenue  on  September  25,  1963.  Rowe  also  reported  that Ala-\nbama  Highway  Patrol  Captain  Ben  Allen  believed  Lipscomb  was \ninvolved  in the  Center  Street  shrapnel  bombings.  In  his \nreport's  final  section,  Rowe  advised  the  Bureau  that  Lipscomb \nhad  instructed  another  klansman  named  Harry  Walker,  just \nthree  days  before  the  16th  Street  Church  bombing,  how  to \nmake  a  bomb  and  had  also  told  Eastview member  Troy  Ingram \nthat he  [Lipscomb]  would  have  no  difficulty making  a  shrapnel \nbomb.

Lipscomb's  Other  Violent  Activities \nLipscomb  readily  admitted  to  agents  that  he  had  been \nviolent  in  the  past,  that  he  had  beaten  up  and  thrown  acid \non  blacks  and  \"knocked  some  heads  together\". [36] \n1 \nWe  were  unable  to  find  any  record  in  FBI  files  that \nagents  advised  Lipscomb  not  to  take  part  in violence  or  that \nthey  ever  considered  terminating  him  after  learning  that  he \nadmitted  having  done  violence  to  blacks.  Of  course,  the \nFBI's  primary  concern  at  this  point was  to  solve  some  of  the \nbombings  and  agents  were  perhaps  willing  to  overlook  Lips-\ncomb's  violent  behavior.  Agents  believed  Lipscomb  \"undoubted-\nly  participated  in  some  of  [Birmingham's]  minor  bombings\"[37], \nand  on  December  2,  1963,  Agents  McCormack  and  Zimmerman \nreported  that  Lipscomb: \nreadily  admits  that while  he  would  not  perform \nany  extreme  acts  of  violence,  he  is  not  now \nadverse  to  'knocking  a  nigger  on  the  head'. [38] \nThe  files  give  no  indication  that  anyone  in  the  FBI \never  advised  Lipscomb  to  stop  beating  blacks.  Moreover, \nAgent  Murphy,  then  Lipscomb's  handling  agent,  confirmed  in \nhis  Task  Force  interview  that he  failed  to  give  such  instruc-\ntions.  To  have  done  so  would  have  been  futile,  Murphy \n36.  Report  of  Lipscomb  to  SA  McCormack  and  SA  Zimmerman,  Nov.  2, \n1963;  BH  157-352-3223;  Task  Force  2052. \n37.

[39]  Murphy  maintains  that had  he  told \nLipscomb  to  stop  \"punching  out\"  or  \"beating  up\"  people, \nLipscomb  would  have  laughed  at him. [40]  \" [It]  just was  not \nin the  man's  constitutional makeup  to  not  engage  in violence.\"[41] \nNor  did  Murphy  consider  it advisable  to  give  him  such  instruc-\ntions[42],  because  Lipscomb  would  have  risked  exposing \nhimself  as  an  informant  and  getting  thrown  out  of  the  klan, \nhad  he  agreed  not  to  commit  violence. [43] \nLipscomb  was  also,  at  the  same  time,  a  suspect \nin  the.church  bombing,  and  I  was  walking  a  fine \nline  in  operating  him  to  begin  with,  between  his \nconstitutional  rights  and  the  constitutional  rights \nof  the  other  sector of  the  populace  that he  didn't \nquite  go  along with.  No,  I  would  think  that  to \ntell him  not  to[commit  violence]  would  have  been \nirrelevant.  It  just wasn't  in  the  man's  nature, \nand  if he  had  suddenly  listened to what  I  said, \nand  turned  tame,  and  wasn't  the  boisterous,  macho, \nbeer-swigging  bully  that  he  had  been  for  his  pre \nvious  life,  they  would  have  exposed  him  and  thrown \nhim  out  of  the  klan  immediately. [44] \nThe  FBI  was  concerned  enough  about  Lipscomb's  violent \ntendencies  to  report  him  to  the  U.  S.  Secret  Service.  On \nApril  14,  1964,  Birmingham  told  the  Service  to watch  him  if \nthe  President  of  the  United  States  should  ever  travel  to \n39.

[45]  Agent  Murphy  explained  that  this  report merely \nreflected  the  FBI's  recognition  that  Lipscomb  was  \"a  very \nviolent man,  an  extremely  violent man\". [46] \nIn  the  spring  of  1964,  Lipscomb  advised  FBI agents  that \n1\nhe  was  then willing  to  beat  up  or  kill Negroes  or  other \npersons. [47]  One  month  later,  on  May  14,  1964,  Rowe  reported \nhe  heard  klansman  Cecil  Henson  say  that  Lipscomb  and  several \nothers  apparently  beat  up  some  whites  at  a  local  movie \ntheatre. [48]  Lipscomb  admitted  to  Rowe  that  he  hit one \nperson  in  the  temple  with  a  battery  cable  and  coupling \ndevice. [49] \nRowe's  report was  placed  in  Lipscomb's  file  at  the  time \nSpecial  Agent  Robert  Murphy  was  his  handling  agent,  but  the \nTask  Force  was  unable  to  locate  any  record  in  FBI  files \nindicating  that  agents  either questioned  Lipscomb  about  this \nincident  or warned  him  about  engaging  in  such  violence. \nWhen  asked  about  it,  Special  Agent  Murphy  responded: \nWell,  I  don't  think  I  would  have  gotten \ngreatly upset  about  it, because  these  people  were \ngiven  to  boasting.  The[y]  were  given  to  exaggera \ntion,  and  they  marked  their masculinity  in  terms \nof  the  number  of  beer  cans  they  drank,  and  the \nnumber  of  fist  fights  they  got  into.

[50] \nThere  was  nothing  in  Rowe's  report  about  Lipscomb's \nfighting  at  the  movie  theatre  that  surprised Agent  Murphy.  [51] \nThe  agent  added,  however,  that  Bureau  Headquarters  was  then \nprimarily  concerned with  solving  the  church  bombing  case  and \nwould  have  considered  such  reports  to  be  essentially  local \nproblems  for  state  law  enforcement  authorities  and  not  \"of \nany  great  consequence\"  to  the  FBI. \nMurphy's  view  of  Headquarters'  reaction was  amply \ndemonstrated when  Headquarters  approved  his  request  for \nauthority  to  continue  payments  to  Lipscomb.  [52]  Murphy \ninformed  Washington  that  Lipscomb  was  a  member  of  an  action \nsquad  and  that he: \nis  called upon  to  take  part  in  various  klan  activi \nties  and  in  the  past  has  participated in various \nacts  of  physical  violence.

[55]  But  SA  Murphy \n! \nbelieved  that  Lipscomb  was  just boasting,  and  would  probably \nnot  do  such  things.  Murphy  could  not  recall warning  Lipscomb \nnot  to  engage  in  such  rattlesnake  antics.  [56] \nIn  September  1964,  Birmingham  attempted  to  convert \nLipscomb  from  probationary  to  full  informant  status  because \nagents  considered  him  valuable  and  trustworthy[57],  and \nbecause  Agent  Murphy  thought  Lipscomb's  \"acts  of  violence \nhad  come  down  to  a  stop\".

The  march  was  intended  to  dramatize  voter  regi.stration \nrestrictions  against  black  people  in Alabama  and  to  present \nto  Governor  George  C.  Wallace  a  petition of  grievances.  Dr. \nMartin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  and  his  Southern  Christian  Leadership \nConference  led  and  organized  the  march,  which  arrived  at  the \nsteps  of  the  State  Capitol  Building  in  Montgomery  on  March \n25,  1965.

[70]  On \nNovember  28,  1967,  Thomas  went  to  federal  prison  in Atlanta, \nand  on  December  2,  Wilkins  went  to  Terre  Haute,  Indiana.  [71] \nOn  December  5,  1969,  Thomas  filed  a  motion  with  the \ndistrict court  for  reduction  of  sentence.  The  motion  made  no \nmention  as  to  who  fired  the  shots  which  killed Viola  Liuzzo. \nIt was  denied  the  day  it was  filed.  Neither  Wilkins  nor \nThomas  ever  filed  any  motions  in  federal  court  relating  to \nwho  killed Viola  Liuzzo.  Prior  to  the  summer  of  1978, \nneither  publicly  claimed  that  Gary  Thomas  Rowe  fired  the \nshots  which  killed Viola  Liuzzo. \n6 7.  Id. \n68.  376  F.2d,  supra  at  563. \n6 9.

On  March  24,  1965, \nRowe  received  a  telephone  call  from  Robert  Thomas,  his \n! \nsuperior  in  the  klan.  Thomas,  then  Grand  Titan,  and  head  of \nsix or eight  Alabama  klaverns,  told  Rowe  not  to  go  to \nMontgomery  the  next  day. [l] \nThe  next morning  Eugene  Thomas  telephoned  around  7:00 \na.m. [2],  7:20  a.m. [3],  or  approximately  8:00  a.m. [4]  and \ntold him  to  get  ready  to  go  to  Montgomery  that morning.  [5] \nMinutes  later,  Rowe  received  a  telephone  call  from  Robert \nThomas,  rescinding  his  instructions  of  the  24th  and  advising \nRowe  to  travel with  Eugene  Thomas  to  Montgomery.  [6]  When \nRowe  asked why  Robert  Thomas  had  changed  his  mind  from  the \nnight  before,  Robert  Thomas  told  Rowe  to  follow  orders, \ngiving  the  impression  that  they  were  those  of  Imperial \nWizard  Robert  Shelton.

Shanahan.  [8]  At  about  8:50,  Shanahan \ncalled  Rowe  to  give  permission  to  go  along.  [9] \nRowe  left his  home  around  8:50  a.m.  [10]  to meet  Gene \nI! \nThomas  at  the  Bessemer  klavern  hall  and  then  followed  him \nto  Thomas'  house.  Rowe  left his  car  there  [11],  and  climbed \ninto  Thomas'  1962  red  and  cream  colored  Chevrolet  [12],  in \nthe  rear  seat behind  Thomas  who  was  driving.  Wilkins, \nEaton,  Rowe,  and  Thomas  departed  from  Thomas'  house  in \nBessemer  shortly  after  9:00  a.m.  [13],  with  Wilkins  according \nto what  Rowe  told  Justice  Department  attorney  St.  John  Barrett, \nin the  right  front  and  Eaton  in  the  right  rear.  [14]  This \nconflicts  with  Rowe's  testimony  at  the  federal  civil  rights \ntrial where  Rowe  testified that Wilkins  sat  in  the  rear \nright  seat  during  the  entire  trip  in  Thomas'  car  on  March \n25,  1965.

Trial  3  at  319. \n- 164  -\n\nIn  1975,  Rowe's  story  changed.  Robert  Thomas  called \nRowe  in  the  early morning  of  March  25,  1965,  to  say  that  the \nday  was  going  to  be  Rowe's  \"big  day  with  the  klan  .  [he] \nhad  been  elected  to  do  the  greatest  deed  of  [his]  life  for \nthe  Klan.\"[16]  Special  Agent  Shanahan  then warned  him  to  be \ncareful  because  the  trip  \"sounds  really  big.\"  [17]  Later, \nklansman  Robert  Creel  called  Rowe  at home  to  ask  why  he  was \nlate  and  to  say  that  the  day  was  going  to  be  Rowe's  \"big  day \nwith  us.  I'm placing my  life on  you  today.  Get  up  here.\"  [18] \nRowe's  version  changed  again  when  the  Task  Force \ninterviewed  him  in  February  1979.  He  told  us  that  in  the  early \nmorning  of  March  25,  1965,  Robert  Thomas  called  Rowe,  asked \nhim  what  shift he  worked,  and  told him  to  go  to  Bessemer  to \nmeet  Robert  Creel.  After  Rowe  checked  with  Agent  Shanahan, \nRobert  Thomas  called  again  to  tell  Rowe  to  forget  the  trip, \nand  Rowe  contacted  Shanahan  to  say  he  was  staying  in  Birmingham. \n, Creel  then  called  Rowe  to  ask  why  he  had  not  gone  to  Bessemer. \nWhen  Rowe  told- him  that  Robert  Thomas  had  cancelled  their  trip, \nCreel  hung  up  [19],  and  called back  shortly  to  tell  Rowe  that \n\"this  is  going  to  be  one  of  the  greatest  things  of  your  life \nfor  the  klan.\"  [20]  Rowe  then  spoke  with  Shanahan  for  the \n16.

Shanahan  stated that  \"it sounds  pretty big\". \n121]  Rowe  went  to  Bessemer;  but  not  to  Gene  Thomas'  house. \n\"I  don't  even  know  where  Gene  Thomas  lives, ...  Rowe told  us. \n1\n122]  Rowe  previously  testified to  having  visited Thomas' \nhouse  both  prior  to  and  on  March  25,  1965.  [23] \nWe  asked  Rowe  about  these  inconsistencies.  Rowe  admitted \nthat he  may  have  talked with  Gene  Thomas  over  the  telephone \nthat day.  [24]  He  was  certain,  however,  that Robert  Thomas \nand  not  Gene,  called him  first on  March  25th.  [25] \nSpecial  Agent  Shanahan's  recollection parallels  Rowe's \npre-1975  accounts.  He  does  not  recall  speaking  with  Rowe \nthree  times,  on  March  25th  [26],  and  does  not  remember  Rowe \nattaching  special  significance  to  the  trip  (i.e.,  one  of  the \ngreatest  things  of  Rowe's  life  for  the  klan).  [27]  The  Task \nForce  did  not  find  any  record  in FBI  files  or  elsewhere, \nthat  someone  told  Rowe  that  the  Montgomery  trip would  be \nsignificant. \nBoth  Robert  Thomas  and  his wife,  Mildred,  told  the  Task \nForce  that Robert  Thomas  did  not  instruct Rowe  to  go  to \n21.

Each \ntime,  Mildred  Thomas  remembers  she  or  her  husband  saying  he \nI \ndid  not want  to go. [29]  Interestingly,  both Mildred  and \nRobert  Thomas  testified at the  first murder  trial[30]  and \nRobert  Thomas  testified at the  federal  trial.[31]  Neither \nwas  asked  to  refute  Rowe's  testimony  that  Robert  Thomas \nordered  Rowe  to Montgomery;  that he  telephoned  Rowe  that \nmorning;  and  that he  gave  Rowe  permission  to  go. [32]  Nor \ndoes  Rowe  today  accept  the  Thomas'  versions  of  these  events. [33] \nMONTGOMERY \nThomas,  Wilkins,  Eaton  and  Rowe  arrived  in Montgomery \nbetween  10:00  a.m.  and  11:00  a.m.[34]  They  cruised  around \nthe  Capitol  for  a  few  minutes  and  then  parked  at  an  all-day \nparking  lot near  the  Alabama  State  Capitol  building.

I36J \nAt  a  gasoline  station they watched  the  civil  rights \nactivists march  up  to  the  steps  of  the  Capitol  building. \n! \nI37]  According  to  Rowe's  federal  trial testimony,  the  four \n\"harassed\",  \"booed\",  \"hollered  at\"  and  argued  with marchers \nand  spectators.  [38]  This  testimony  conflicted with  Rowe's \nstate  trial  testimony  in which  he  denied  heckling,  or  even \ntalking  to,  the  demonstrators.  [39]  No  one  asked  Rowe  to \nexplain  this  inconsistency  at  the  federal  trial.  In  our \ninterview  Rowe  admitted  that he  shouted  insults  at  the \nprotesters,  but  only  to  convince  the  three  klansmen  that he \nshared  their views,  [40]  and  to  keep  them  from  suspecting \nhe  was  an  informant. \nRowe's  1979  account  of  the  afternoon  in Montgomery  differed \nsharply  from  his  prev1ous  stories.  He  told  the  Task  Force \nthat after  arriving  in Montgomery,  Gene  Thomas  drove  to  the \nservice  station,  talked  to  several  people  there,  and  returned \nto  the  car  to  tell the  others  that  they  would  \"set up  here\".

[42]  While  watch-\ning  the  march,  Rowe  and  Wilkins  broke  up  a  fistfight.  [43] \nFinally,  Gene  Thomas  saw  a  nun,  and  suggested  as9aulting  her \nsexually. [44]  We  found  no  pre-1979  record  to  support  this \naccount. \nJACK'S  TAVERN \nAfter  departing  from  Montgomery,  Rowe  and  the  others \ndrove  to  a  bar-restaurant  near  Maxwell  Air  Force  Base, \ncalled Jack's  Tavern  or  Cafe,  or  Jack's  Beverages  for  beers \nand  something  to  eat.  [45]  In  1965  Rowe  recalled  Gene \nThomas  telling  a  man  to  \"inform  the  'Montgomery  people'  that \nTHOMAS  was  in  town  so  that  if they  were  picked  up -for  any \nreason  arrangements  could  be  made  for  them  to  be\"  let out  on \nbond.

[79] \nIn  one  1965  interview,  Rowe  apparently  suggested  to \nThomas  that  if Thomas  forced  the  Liuzzo  car  off  the  road, \n\"Wilkins  and  I  will  jump  out  and  get  them.\"  [80]  Also,  he \nstated that  \"if we  are  going  to  do  anything  at  all,  we  ought \nto whip  their  ass  and  let the  whole  world  see  them\".  [81]  If \nthese  remarks,  which  were  attributed  to  Rowe,  were  accurate, \nit appears  to  the  Task  Force  that  either Rowe  wanted  the \noccupants  in  the  Liuzzo  car  to  be  physically  attacked,  or \nthat  Rowe  recognized  that  the  people  in  the  Liuzzo  car were \ngoing  to  be  shot  at  and  that  a  beating was  preferential  to  a \nkilling. \n77.

A  couple  of  transfer  trucks  approached  from \nthe  opposite  direction  [89],  thereby  quashing  the  attempt. \nThis  does  not  square  with  Rowe's  trial testimony.

[122]  Shanahan  explained  that  he  did \nnot  include  this  in his  March  26th  report  because  he  then \n\"probably  knew  that  the  other  guy  in  the  car was !alive  and \nwell\".  [123] \nWhen  told  that  this  story  now  conflicted with  his  prior \ntrial  testimony,  Shanahan  read  the  testimony  and  told us \nthat  it was  more  accurate  than  his  present  recollection \nbecause  it was  \"more  contemporaneous  with  the  occurrence\", \n[i.e.,  the  shooting] .  [124] \nTHE  TRIP  HOME \nIn  1965,  Rowe  emphatically  stated  that  after  the \nshooting  the  four  did  not  stop  or  return  to  the  Liuzza  car \nto  see  if they  had  done  any  damage.  [125]  At  the  first \ntrial,  Rowe  testified that  the  Thomas  car did  not  stop  for \nat  least  twenty  miles.  [126]  Defense  lawyer,  Matt  Murphy, \nspecifically questioned  Rowe  about  this  on  the  stand  [127]: \nQuestion:  You  never  did  return  to  the  car  then? \nRowe:  No,  sir. \nQuestion:  You  are  certain of  that,  Mr.  Rowe? \nRowe:  I  am  very  certain,  we  did  not  go  back \nto  the  Liuzza  automobile.

[ 12 8] \nIn  his  1975  Senate  deposition,  Rowe  recounted  a \ndramatically  different  story.  After  the  shooting,  someone \nin  the  car  told  Thomas  to  stop.  Thomas  applied  the  brakes, \nturned  his  car  around,  and  headed  back  to  the  Liuzza  car. \nWilkins  jumped  out  of  the  car,  climbed  down  a  ravine  and \nover  some  bushes,  and  returned  to  tell  the  other  three  that \nhe  had  blown  the  passenger's  head  off.  Wilkins  also  apparently \ntold Thomas  that Thomas  must  have  been  wrong  when  he  appeared \nto  see  a  head  pop  up  in the  back  of  the  Liuzza  car.  [129] \nIn  1979,  Rowe  gave  us  a  similar  version.  He  said \nWilkins  ordered  Thomas  to  stop  the  car,  over  Rowe's  own \nobjections.  Wilkins  got  out  of  the  car  and  returned  from \nthe  Liuzza  car  to  say,  \"I'm one  hell  of  a  shot  ...  I  killed \nboth  the  fuckers.\"  [130] \nWe  pointed  out  to  Rowe  the  conflicts  between  his  1965 \nand  post-1974  accounts,  and  he  replied  that  he  could  not \n128.

[131]  When  asked  why  his  1965  account \n( \nwould  not  tend  to  be  \"better\"  and  more  accurate,  Rowe  said: \nI  don't know.  You  know  I'm beginning  to \nwonder.  I  had  a  hell  of  a  trauma  there,  so  I'm \njust not  sure,  just to  be  honest with  you.  [132] \nOn  several  occasions,  Rowe  said  that Wilkins  accused \nhim  of not  firing  his  gun  and  that  Rowe  responded  by  saying \nhe  fired  twice.  [133]  In  a  1965  interview,  however,  Rowe \nsaid  that Wilkins,  Thomas,  and  Eaton  did  not  realize  \"in  the \nexcitement  that he  [Rowe]  had  not  himself  fired  at the \ncar.\" [134] \nRowe  has  repeatedly  stated that Wilkins  and  Eaton  threw \ntheir empty  shells  out of  the  car  after the  shooting. [lBS] \nBut  he  has  not  been  consistent  as  to  precisely when  they  did \nso.  Rowe  has  alternatively  stated that Wilkins  and  Eaton \nthrew  out  their empty  cartridges  one  half  to  two  miles  from \n131.  Id. ,  Vol.  I  at  202-04.  Vol.  II  at 134. \n132.  Id.

Mrs. \nLiuzzo's  foot  was  still on  the  accelerator,  and  the  motor \nwas  racing.

Civil  Rights  Division \nattorneys  told him,  he  stated  in  1965,  that  they  would  try \nto  design  the  questioning  in  such  a  way  as  to  keep  the  issue \nof Moton's  identity  from  coming  up  at  trial. [26]  And  Rowe \nreplied  that  if the  question  of  Moton's  identify  did  come \nup,  he  would  \"truthfully\"  and  \"factually\"  describe  the \nperson  he  thought  to  be  in  the  victim's  car. [27] \nThis  version  is  confirmed  by  a  FBI  document  describing \na  meeting  John  Doar  had  with  Rowe  in  Tampa,  Florida  less \nthan  a  week  before  the  Federal  trial. [28]  There,  Doar \nassured  Rowe  that he  did  not  consider  Rowe's  inability to \nidentify Moton  as  the  other  occupant  in  the  Liuzza  car  as \nbeing  harmful  to  the  government's  case,  and  explicitly \nstated  that  if Rowe  believed Motop  not  to  be  the  right man, \nhe  should  so  testify. [29]  Rowe  then  asked  Doar  for  written \nassurances  to  that effect[30],  and  on  November  27,  1965,  Mr. \nDoar  did  so: \n26.

[31]  ยท \nOn  November  28,  1965,  Inspector  McGovern  notified  Bureau \nHeadquarters  that  the  letter had  been  delivered. [32]  In \nFebruary  1979,  Rowe  denied  ever  having  seen  it,  although \na  FBI  memorandum  confirms  that  Doar's  letter was  delivered. \n[33] \nRowe  himself  has  given  conflicting descriptions  of  Mrs. \nLiuzzo's  passenger.  In  his  March  31  interview with  Barrett, \nRowe  described  Moton  as  a  heavy  set negro  in  his  30's,  wear-\ning  a  green  wool  sport  coat,  a  necktie,  white  shirt and  hat. \n[34]  On  November  15,  1965,  Rowe  told  Special  Agent  Neil \nShanahan  that he  was  \"a  large  Negro,  with  an  exceptionally \nlarge  neck,  possibly  shirt size  17,  ... ,\"wearing  a  dress \nshirt,  tie,  sport  coat,  and  a  \"business-type  snap  brim hat \nwith  a  feather  in the  band.\"[35]  In  Rowe's  book,  he  describes \nthe  passenger  in much  the  same  way: \n31.

He  appeared  to  be  a  large man  in \nhis  late  thirties;  he  was  wearing  a  green  sport \ncoat with  dark  checks,  a  white  shirt and  dark  tie, \nand  a  black  or  brown  felt  hat.  [36] \nNotice  that  the  hat  is  now  described  as  being made  of \nfelt.  There  is  no  mention  of  a  \"snap  brim\"  or  \"feather  in \nthe  band\".  But  in  1979,  Rowe  described  him  as  wearing  a \nRussian  \"Moskovitch\"  [sic]  hat. \nQuestion:  Have  you  ever  testified he  had  on  a \nbusinesslike  hat with  a  feather  in  it? \nRowe:  No,  sir.  I  don't  believe  I  did.  No, \nsir,  that man  had  on  a  Russian  cap  that \nhad,  shiny,  like  a  fur  cap;  that's what \nthe  man  had  on  .  [It was]  black  or \ndark  brown  ....

Account  of  Lavaughn  Coleman \nFormer  Birmingham  Police  Off  Lavaughn  Coleman  told us \nice~ \nthat he  saw  Rowe  after  the  Liuzza  killing at a  motel  in \nBirmingham.  To  make  sure  no  one  could  hear  what  he  said,  Rowe \ntook  Coleman  into  the  bathroom,  turned  on  the  shower,  and \nflushed  the  toilet.  Then  Rowe  said,  \"I  [or we]  had  to  smoke  a \nwhore  tonight\",  [l]  leading  Coleman  to  conclude  that Rowe \nkilled her.  [ 2] \nBut  Coleman's  account  to  the  Task  Force  conflicts  at  least \nin  tone  with  what  he  told  the  FBI  in  1965.  Answering  questions \nabout  another  Bureau  investigation  [3],  the  eleven-year  Birming-\nham  police  veteran  admitted  he  had  been  close  to  Rowe  for  five \nor  six years,  and  said  that  Rowe  had  performed  an  \"exceptional \nservice  to  the  country  and  to  the  FBI  by  assisting  them  over \nthe  past  several  years.\"  [4]  Although  not  apparently  asked  about \nit,  he  said nothing  about  Rowe  shooting Viola  Liuzzo. \nThe  Task  Force  obtained  a  copy  of  a  report  of  an  interview \nconducted  in  1975  or  1976,  of  Coleman  by  the  Birmingham  Police \nDepartment.  According  to  the  report,  Coleman  told  Birmingham \nauthorities  that when  he  visited Rowe  in  1965,  shortly  after \n1.

Indictment  of  Gary  Thomas  Rowe,  Circuit Court  of \nLowndes  County,  Alabama,  Sept.  20,  1978. \n\nF.  The  Federal  Grand  Jury \nOn  April  5  and  6,  1965,  a  federal  grand  jury  in Montgomery \nheard  evidence  concerning,  among  other  things,  the  death  of \nViola  Liuzzo.  Because  Rule  6(e)  of  the  Federal  of  Criminal \n~ules \nProcedure  prohibits  public  release  of  the  evidence  presented, \nthe  Task  Force  has  chosen  to  summarize  the  proceedings  in  this \nseparate  section. \nThirteen witnesses,  including  Gary  Thomas  Rowe,  Jr.,  testi \no. \nfied.  The  grand  jury  indicted Collie  Leroy  Wilkins,  William \nEaton,  and  Eugene  Thomas,  for  violations  of  18  U.S.C.  ยง241.  We \nfound  Rowe's  testimony  to  be  noteworthy  but will  also  mention \nthe  testimony  of  others  which  we  consider  important. \n(1)  Special  Agent  Neil  Shanahan  stated  that when  he  met \nRowe  at  the  West  End  Baptist  Church  in  the  early morning  of \nMarch  26,  1965,  Rowe  \"was  visibly  shaken โขโขโข and  more  shaken  than \nI  had  ever  seen  him  before .โข.. \"[l] \n(2)  Rowe  testified that  at a  housing  project  near  the \nA.M.E.  Church,  Thomas  handed  his  gun  to Wilkins.[2]  This  is \nconsistent with  two  other  1965  versions  of  the  killing, [3] \nbut  is  inconsistent with  his  Task  Force  interview.[4] \n1.

See  Section X (B),  Footnote  62. \n- 224  -\n\n(3)  Rowe  conf;i,rmed  what  he  had  said  to Department  Attorney \nSt.  John  Barrett earlier that week--that  he  told  Thomas  during \nthe  chase  to  stop  the  Liuzzo  car  so  that ~owe and  W~lkins \ncould  forcibly  remove  Hrs.  Liuzza  and  her  passenger.[5] \n(4)  Rowe  completely  contradicts  his  post-1965  accounts[6] \nemphatically  stating  that,  after  the  shooting,  Thomas  imme \ndiately  accelerated  his  car  and  sped  away.[7] \n(5)  Rowe  said  in  the  grand  jury  that he  did  not  know \nwhether  Eaton  or Wilkins  hit anyone  that night.  He  testified \nthat,  when  Wilkins  disposed  of  his  pistol  cartridges,  Rowe \n\"didn't know  whether  the  people  [in  the  Liuzzo  car]  were \ndead  or  injured.\"[8]  Rowe  testified that Wilkins  was  also \nunsure  about whether  Wilkins  had  hit anybody  and  asked  Thomas \nto  turn  on  the  radio  to  find  out  so  that  they  could  \"decide \nwhat  to  do  with  the  weapons.\"[9] \nA  grand  juror  asked  Rowe  how  Wilkins  and  Eaton  missed \nMrs.  Liuzzo's  passenger,  and  Rowe  replied,  \"Ma'am,  we  haven't \nfigured  that  out  ourselves ....  I  really don't know  how  he \nwasn't  hit.\"[10] \n5.  Transcript  191.  See  Section  X(B),  Footnotes  80-81. \n6.  See  Section X(B),  Footnotes  129-130. \n7.  Transcript  197-198. \n8.

[13] \n(7)  Special Agent  Lawrence  Gettings  testified  that when  he \narrested Eugene  Thomas  the  next  day,  Thomas  told  him  that Wilkins \nrode  in  the  right  rear  seat  and  Rowe  in  the  left rear  on  the \ntrip  to Montgomery.  This  squares  with  Rowe's  accounts  about \nthe  seating  arrangement.  Gettings  also  testified that Thomas \nthen  told him  that  he  had  kept  his  .38  pistol  in his  glove \ncompartment  during  the  entire  trip and  that he,  Thomas,  did \nnot  know  who  had  killed Viola  Liuzzo. [14] \n(8)  The  transcript  shows  that  the  grand  jury wrestled \nwith  the  question  of who  to  indict.  One  grand  juror  asked  the \nprosecutors  if Rowe  could  be  indicted. [15] \n11.

Transcript  334. \n- 226  -\n\nDepartment  Attorney  St.  John  Barrett replied: \nWith  respect to Mr.  Rowe,  of  course,  .it is \ntrue  that  the  Grand  Jury  can--has  it within  its \npower  to  indict anybody,  I  suppose ..โขโข  In  our \npresentation โข.. and  in  the  proposed  indictment, \nMr.  Rowe  has  not  been  named,  and  he  has  not  been \nnamed  for  the  simple  reason  that  in  our  judgement \nhe  has  committed  no  violation of  Federal  law. \nYou  can  disagree  with  us.  You  can  return  such \nan  indictment  that you  see  is proper. [16] \nThe  grand  juror's question was  prompted  by  the  United  States \nAttorney's  comment  during  the  grand  jury proceedings  that  the \nproposed  indictment  contained  four  names  on  it--Wilkins,  Thomas, \nโข \nand  Eaton  (the  three  who  were  subsequently  indicted) ,  as  well \nas  Rowe's  superior  in  the  klan,  Robert  Thomas. [17] \nAnother  grand  juror  raised  the  possibility of  indicting \nRowe  in order  to  dispel  suspicion  that  Rowe  was  providing \ninformation  to  the  FBI. [18]  However,  Barrett  apparently \nconvinced  the  grand  jury  that  indicting  Rowe  would  probably \ncause  Rowe,  as  a  defendant,  not  to  testify against  the  others. \nAlthough  the  transcript does  not  contain  the  grand  jury's \nprivate deliberations,  their  comments  to  the  prosecutors \ndo  not  indicate  that  they  seriously  considered  indicting \nRowe,  either  along with,  or  in  place  of,  Wilkins,  Thomas, \nand  Eaton. \n16.

Physical  Evidence \nViola  Liuzzo's  car was  discovered  by  Alabama  State Highway \nPatrol  Troopers  H.  L.  Burgess  and  Torruny  McGhee. [l]  They  arrived \nat the  scene  around  8:30  p.m.  after receiving  a  report of  an \nautomobile  accident  on  Highway  80,  and  when  they  saw  her  body, \nirrunediately  called  their  supervisor  to  send  a  state  investi-\ngator.[2]  While  peering  through  the  left side window  with  a \nflashlight,  Trooper  Burgess  noticed what  appeared  to  be  a \nbullet  lying  on  the  rear  floor  near  the  driver's  side.[3]  He \npicked  it up  and  turned  it over  to  State  Investigator E.  J. \nDixon.  The  bullet was  later given  to  FBI  laboratory  examiner \nMarion  Williams  who  forwarded  it to  the  FBI  laboratory  in \nWashington. [ 4] \nAt  9:30  p.m.,  FBI  Inspector  Joseph  Sullivan  and  Special \nAgent  Clifton Browning,  Jr.,  of  the  Selma  office,  arrived  at \nthe  scene  and  conducted  an  initial investigation.  They  found \na  driver's  license  on  the  body  and  identified  the  victim as \nViola  Liuzzo.[5]  Due  to  the  large  quantity  of  blood  on  the \n1.

[6] \nAccording  to  the  Bureau,  the  area  around  the  vehicle  \"was \nsearched  in  a  terrain-type  search,  chartered  [sic],  photographed, \nand  minutely  examined  with  a  view  to  the  development  of  all \npossible  evidentiary  character which  remained  on  the  scene.\"[7] \nAs  seen  from  FBI  photographs  and  sketches,  the  killing \noccurred  on  a  straight  stretch of  Highway  80,  27.5  miles  from \nSelma. [8]  When  the  shooting  occurred,  the  Liuzza  car was \ntravelling up  a  slight  incline,  and  after  the  shots  were  fired, \nit veered  off  to  the  right,  crossed  a  ditch,  and  travelled over \nan  open  area  for  252'  11\",  before  coming  to  a  stop  at  a  barbed \nwire  fence  approximately  50'  from  the  highway. [9]  Between  the \nhighway  and  the  fence,  there were  no  visible  obstructions, \nbushes  or  trees.

[47] \nHowever,  Laboratory  Examiner  Williams  testi~ied at the \ntrial that  the  bullet marks  found  below  Mrs.  Liuzzo's  window \nwere  made  by  bullets  smaller  than  a  .38  caliber,  which  suggests \nthat  the  holes  were  made  from  Eaton's  .22. \nEaton's  wife  contacted  the  Bureau  after  her  husband's  death \non  March  9,  1966,  and  told  interviewing  agents  that when  the \nFBI  searched  her  home,  they  found  the  wrong  gun.

There  was  no  su9gestion \nthat  the  shooting  of  a  civil rights worker  was  planned. [10] \nOn  March  31,  1965,  Barrett arranged  to  interview  Rowe  for \nfive  hours.

In  an  attempt  to  find  evidence  tying  Wilkins, \nEaton,  and  Thomas  to  other  criminal  acts,  a  record \nDivi~ion \nanalyst  examined  nine  volumes  in  1965.  The  researcher \nreported  to  her  superiors  that  on  one  occasion  Rowe  de-\nlivered blasting  caps  to  a  Bessemer  klansman  named  \"Big \nJohn,\"  who  in  turn  passed  them  along  to  a  Georgia \nKlansman.  [24]  She  also  reported  that  Rowe  travelled with \nseveral  Eastview  klansmen  on  April  14,  1965,  to  do  \"missionary \nwork\"  at  an  integrated baseball  field  [25]  and  that  Rowe  was \npart of  a  klan  group  which  planned  to  beat  up  a  splinter \nklan  organization.  [26]  There  is  nothing  in  Civil  Rights \nDivision  or  FBI  files  to  indicate  that  this  information \ncaused  the  Civil  Rights  prosecutors  to  inquire  further  into \nRowe's  violent  activities  or  to  question  his  credibility. \nIt is  clear  that  the: Bureau,  both  at  Headquarters  and \nin Birmingham,  did  not  provide  all pertinent  information \nabout  Rowe,  not  only  from  his  three  volume  informant  file, \nbut  also  from  the  informant  files  of  others  who  were  in  a \n24.

What  the  FBI  and  the  Civil  Rights  Division  Knew  About \nRowe's  Apparently  Untrue  Statements \nAn  examination  of  Rowe's  testimony  in  the  second  state murder \ntrial  and  the  Federal  civil  rights  trial strongly  suggests  that \nRowe  lied under  oath  in  both  trials.  We  were  unabl~ to  determine \nwith  certainty whether  Civil  Rights  Division  attorneys  knew  about \nit,  however. \nIn  the  second murder  trial,  Rowe  testified that  he  was  present \nat the  Trailways  bus  station  on  Mothers  Day,  1961,  but  that  he \ncommitted  no  violence  there. [l]  Defense  attorney  Arthur  Hanes \nshowed  him  a  picture  from  the  March  2,  1963,  edition of  the \nSaturday  Evening  Post.  The  Post  picture  covers  the  same  scene \nas  the  front  page  picture  displayed  in  the  May  15,  1961,  Birming-\nham  Post-Herald,  and  as  we  described  in  Chapter  Vat note  35, \nshows  Rowe  grabbing  a  Freedom  Rider  while  others  beat  him with \nfists  and  pipes.  Hanes  asked  Rowe  if he  was  in  the  picture. \nRowe  vigorously  denied  he  was  [2]  and  repeated  this  denial  at \nthe  Federal  civil  rights  trial when  asked  the  same  question.

The \nBig  Man  is  going  to  have  a  nervous  breakdown  when  he \nsees  this.  Now,  here's what  you've  got  to  do,  to  the \nday  you  die--!  don't care  if The  Man  himself  tells you, \n'Goddarnnit,  Gary  Thomas  Rowe,  Jr.,  I  know  that's you'- \nyou're  going  to  look  at him,  straight  in  the  eye  and \nsay,  'No,  sir.  That's  not me.  That's  Arnie  Cagle.' \nQuestion:  Now,  \"The  Man\"  refers  to whom? \nRowe:  A  klansman  that was  in  the  ---. \nQuestion:  No,  sorry.  You  said  that  the  FBI \nI'~ \nagent  told  you,  if The  Man  ever  comes  and  asks  you  ... \nRowe:  I'm  sorry.  The  Man,  through  the  years, \nwas  referred  to  as  Mr.  Hoover. \nQuestion:  The  FBI  agents  were  asking  you  to \nalways  maintain  that that picture was  of  a  man  who \nresembled  you,  who  was  also  a  klan member,  but \nw~s \nnot  you? \nRowe:  That  is  correct,  until  the  day  I  die. \nQuestion:  I  see. [5] \nAnd  in his  interview with  the  Task  Force,  Rowe  admitted \nconunitting  violence  at Trailways. \n4.

The  fight \nwas  going  pretty  good,  and  it was  just--everybody was \nfighting  at this  time.  It was  just a  damn--really  a  free \nfor-all.  I  mean,  clubs--you  can't believe  this--whites \nwas  hitting whites.  I  mean,  everybody  was  just swinging, \nand  whatever  in  the  hell you  could  find  was  hit.{6] \n*  *  * \nQuestion:  Do  you  remember  hitting  anybody?  Who  do \nyou  remember  hitting  in  that bus  station--Trailways  bus \nstation? \nRowe:  Sir,  I  can't  tell you  the  names.  I  probably \nhit half  a  dozen,  a  dozen  people,  in  there. [7] \nWe  also  questioned  Rowe  about  the  photograph,  and  he  admitted \nbeing  pictured  in  it. \nQuestion:  Did  you  ever  discuss  that photograph with \nthe  FBI? \nRowe:  Yes,  sir. \nQuestion:  And  what  did  they  tell you? \nRowe:  They  told me,  to  the  day  I  die,  if I  live  to \nbe  99  years  old,  again,  said,  \"The  old man's  going  to \nshit.  He's  going  to  climb  the  wall.\" \nHe  said,  \"Who  does  that  look  like  to  you?\" \nAnd  I  said,  \"Me.\" \nAnd  he  said,  \"Just  think  very carefully.  Who  else \ndoes  that  look  like besides  you.\" \nAnd  I  looked  at it,  and  Iยท said,  \"I  tell you  the \ntruth,  kind  of  like  Cagle.\" \nHe  said,  \"That's  it,  Cagle.\"  He  says,  \"To  the  day \nyou  die,  if you're  99  goddamn  years  old,  I  don't  care \nwho  asks  you--if  the  Director  comes  down  and  looks  you \nin  the  eye  and  says,  'Who's  that?'--you're  telling me \nnow,  that' s  Cagle. \" I 8] \n6.

Barrett Kemp,  Rowe's  handling  agent  in May,  1961,  could \nnot  recall  ever  seeing  the  photograph,  although  FBI  records  do \nsuggest,  however,  that he  did  in  fact  examine  it.

He  was  there.  I  recognized  that. \nI  think  everyone  recognized  that.  He  was  subject  to  prose-\ncution  the  same  as  the  other  three.  In  that  sense,  he  was \nnot  only  a  suspect,  he  was  a  subject  But  his  testimony \nwas  recognized  as  necessary  to  the  Government's  case,  if it \ncould  be  corroborated.\"[2] \nWhen  former  agent Melton  Alexander  was  asked  if anyone \nin  the  FBI  suspected  that Rowe  fired  the  fatal  shots,  he \nanswered: \nWell,  the  question  arises,  there was  not  an  FBI \nagent  in  that  car.  We  don't have  a  disinterested \nthird-party  credible witness.  We  have  a  man  who \nhas  furnished  information  predominantly  reliable \nin  the  past,  who  reports  faithfully,  who  has  not \nturned  on  the  FBI  or  done  things  that make  you \nthink  an  informant  is  playing  both  ends.  The \ndecision  is made,  at  least in  this  stage,  to \n1.  James  L.  McGovern  Interview by  Task  Force,  Feb.  23,  1979,  46. \n2.  Id.  4 7. \nI \n- 25.3  -\n\naccept  or  reject.  I  don't  think  anybody  ever \nmade  the  conscious  determination  in  our  minds \nthat  Rowe  could  not  have  fired  the  gun,  and  did \nnot.  However,  we  had  no ยทpositive  evidence  to \nthe  fact  he  did  fire,  or  pull  the  trigger.  Now, \nhere  is where  you  come,  the  prosecutor's  deter \nmination  is who  you  are  going  to  prosecute.  !And \nthe  Assistant Attorney  General  in  the  Civil \nRights  Division made  his  decision:  We  carve \nRowe  out  and  he's  going  to  be  our  witness. \nWe're  going  to  prosecute  A,  B  and  C  and  D,  Rowe \nwill  riot  get  prosecuted;  he'll be  our  witness. \nSo  that's when  the  prosecutor's  determination \nwas  mad~ a~ to w~o to  accept  or  reject credibility. \nNow,  as  to .whether  I  ever  heard  anybody  at \nFBI  say,  \"I  believe  Rowe  shot,\"  or ยท\"I  positively \nbelieve  he  did  not,\"  the  answer  is no;  I  don't \nknow  that  ever  said  that.[3] \nanyb~~y \nRowe's  last handling  agent,  Neil  Shanahan,  confirms \nAlexander's  recollection  that no  one  suspected  Rowe. [4]  Nor \ndid  the  Justice  Department  prosecutors.  ยทSt.  John  Barrett,  who \n-\ninterviewed  Rowe  for  five  hours  on  March  31,  admitted  he  was \ntroubled  that  Rowe  was  in  the  car  and  did  nothing  to  stop  the \nshooting. [5]  Nonetheless,  Barrett concedes  that  the  trial \nteam was  caught  up  in  trying  to  corroborate  Rowe's  story,  rather \nthan  to  destroy  it โข .  \"The  fact was,  Rowe  was  our witness.

Tommy  Rowe  pulled out \ngun  and  fired,\"  and  on  another  page  Doar  wrote:  \"Even  if Rowe \ndid  the  shooting,  people  are  all guilty.\" \nWhen  asked  about  these  notes,  Mr.  Doar  explained  that he \nwas  concerned  about  a  defense  strategy  alleging  Rowe  was  the \nkiller and  posed  the  hypothetical  statements  himself  to  help \nprepare  his  case.  Doar  stated he  had  no  reason  to  think  the \nstrategy would  be  used--he  was  just trying  to  anticipate \npossible  defenses.

GARY  THOMAS  ROWE:  THE  AFTERMATH \nAfter  Wilkins,  Eaton,  and  Thomas  were  arrested  on \nMarch  26th,  the  klan  immediately  began  to  suspect  that  Tommy \nRowe  had  a  hand  in  turning  them  in. [l]  Rowe  went  home  and \n! \nlearned  that he  and  ~is family  had  already  received  threaten-\ning  telephone  calls[2],  and  he  asked  the  Bureau  if he  could \nmove  into  a  motel,  which  he  did  on  March  29,  1965. [3] \nThat  day,  agents  asked  Rowe  to  sign  a  fourteen-page \ndetailed  statement  of  the  Liuzzo  episode  in  order  to  confirm \nhis  account  of  Mrs.  Liuzzo's  death. [4]  The  Selma  office \nteletyped Washington  and  stated that  Rowe  would  sign  the \nstatement provided  he: \nknows  where  he  stands  with  respect  to  prose \ncution  in both  Federal  and  State  courts.  He \nraises  the  question  concerning what  can  be  done \nfor  him with  respect  to  future  employment,  and \nwhat  will  be  done  with  respect  to  relocation of \nhis  family  and  himself .... [Rowe  was]  not  interested \nin  large monetary  return  for  his  services  as  he \nfeels  he  has  served  his  country  during  the  past \nseveral  years  in  the  capacity  of  an  informant  and \nhas  performed  a  duty  and  an  obligation  as  a  citizen.

After  considerable  discussion with  John  Doar, \nand  agents  James  McGovern,  and  Neil  Shanahan,  Rowe  agreed  to \ntestify  [19],  but  only  after  asking  for  and  receiving written \nassurance  from  Doar  that  Rowe,  if questioned  about  Moton, \nwould  answer  that  he  did  not  believe  Leroy  .Moton  was  in  the \ncar with  Mrs.  Liuzza.

[23]  Rowe  signed  the  following  statement: \nThis  amount  has  been  accepted  by  me  in  full \nand  complete  satisfaction of  services  rendered \nvoluntarily  to  representatives  of  the  FBI  up  to \nand  including  January  14,  1966. \nMy  acceptance  of  this  amount  in  fulfillment \nof  the  above  brings  to  a  close  a  very  pleasant \nrelationship,  which  I  have  enjoyed with  representa \ntives  of  the  FBI,  who  have  on  all  occasions  treated \nme  fairly  and  with  the  utmost  consideration,  and \nI  wish  to  take  this  opportunity  to  express  my  ap \npreciation.  [24] \nOn  January  17,  1966,  Rowe  became  a  Deputy  United  States \nMarshal  in  San  Diego,  California,  [25]  a  position which  he \nheld  until  January  1968. \n22.

Burkhalter \n- 262  -\n\nAI;>PENDIX  I.  METHOD  OF  REV::LEW \nIn  order  to  carry  out  the  Task  Force's mission  as  stated \nin Chapter  I,  we  reviewed  nearly  800  volumes  of  FBI  records  in \nwhole  or  in part,  depending  on  the  relevance  of  the  particular \nvolume  to  the  focus  of  the  inquiry.  The  average  volume  contains \nabout  200  pages.  Initially,  we  located  and  examined  every \nreference  to  the  name  Gary  Thomas  Rowe  and  all  the  variations \nof  the  name  in  the  Bureau's  central  indices.  These  files  were \nlocated  in Washington  and  40  different  field  offic'es.  The  Task \nForce  personally  inspected  all  such  files  in  the  critical offices \nof  Birmingham,  Mobile,  Atlanta,  and  Savannah,  and  had  the \nrelevant  files  from  the  other  oยฃfices  forwarded  to Washington \nfor  review. \nSignificantly,  we  were  given  full  access  to  Rowe's  personal \ninformant  files  in Washington  and  Birmingham  and  to  the  files \nof  every  other  FBI  informant  known  to  have  any  contact with \nRowe. [l] \nTo  check  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  file  entries \nunder  Rowe's  name,  we  read  all  the  general  files  on  the  incidents \nin which  Rowe  was  known  or  suspected  to  have  been  involved.  We \ngave  particular  attention  to  files  in Washington  and  Birmingham \nrelating  to  the  Liuzzo  murder  (HQ  44-28601;  BH  44-12360),  the \nbombing  of  the  16th Street Baptist Church  and  related bombings \n1.  References  to  the  identity of  the  other  informants  were \ndeleted  to  protect  their  confidentiality. \n1 \n\nin Birmingham  (HQ  157-1025;  BH  157-352),  and  the  beatings  of  freedom \nriders  at  th~ Trailways  bus  station  (HQ-149-1684;  BH  149-16). \nAs  an  additional means  of  finding  out  about  Rowe,  we \npulled  and  read  the  files  in  Birmi~gham onยท the  Eartview  13 \nKlavern,  to which  Rowe  belonged_,  and  the  Bessemer  Klavern,  which \nwas  closely  affiliated to  Eastview during  the  time  Rowe  was \nan  FBI  informant  and  the  pertinent  files  on  Alabama's  United \nKlans  of America.  We  also examined  the  files  relating  to  the \nFBI's  Counter-Intelligence  Program  (COINTELPRO)  against  the \nklan. \nWe  reviewed  all  files maintained  by  the  Department's  Civil \nRights  Division  relating  to  the  Liuzzo  murder,  the  bombing  of \nthe  16th Street Baptist Church,  and  the  Trailways  bus  station \nincident.  We  also  reviewed  the  documents  the  Criminal  Division \nobtained  in  their  1978  inquiry,  and  the  documents  made  available \nby  the  Senate  Select Conunittee  on  Intelligence  and  by  the  FBI's \nInspection  Division. \nWhen  Rowe  surfaced  as  an  FBI  informant  and  government  wit-\nness  following  the  Liuzzo  killing,  klansmen  were  bitter and \nstarted  spreading  stories  about  his  character  and  conduct  in \nthe  klan.  We  did not  pursue  all these  allegations,  especially \nwhen  they  appeared  to  be  obviously  vindictive. \nFor  example,  when  Mary  Lou  Holt,  the  wife  of  a  klansman, \nwas  interviewed  by  the  FBI  in 1964,  she  said  that: \nThe  perpetrators  of  the  16th  Street Baptist \nChurch  [bombing]  were  undoubtedly  Negroes  or whites \n2 \n\ninterested  in  bi-racial  activities who  felt  the \nChurch  bombing  would  help  the  cause  of  civil  rights \nin  the  South. [2] \nBut  when  reinterviewed  in  1965  after  Rowe  surfaced,  she  told the \nBureau  that  a  \"morally  low  and  unstable  person  sยตch  as  Tommy \nRowe  was  likely  responsible  for  the  bombs  which  had  been \nplanted  in  Birmingham  over  the  previous  several  years.\"[3] \nThe  Task  Force  sought  not  only  to  identify  each  time  the \nklan  asked  Rowe  to  take  part  in  violence,  but  also  to  document \nwhat  the  Bureau  did with  the  information when  they  got  it in \nadvance. \nTo  complement  our  file  review,  Task  Force  members  inter-\nviewed:  4  present  or  former  FBI  Headquarters  officers;  19 \npresent  or  former  FBI  agents  or  field  office  personnel;  10 \npresent  or  former  klansmen  or klan  sympathizers;  9  FBI \ninformants  or  former  informants  (including  Gary  Thomas  Rowe); \n8  present  or  former  Alabama  or  local  law  enforcement  officials; \n5  Civil  Rights  Division  attorneys  or  support  personnel;  2 \nformer  United  States  Attorneys  and  1  former  Assistant  United \nStates  Attorney;  2  of  Rowe's  former  girlfriends;  2  private \ncitizens  of  Birmingham;  1  former  Alabama  law  enforcement \ninformant;  and  Leroy  Moton  for  a  total  of  64  interviews.  We \ninterviewed  agents  in Akron,  Atlanta,  Birmingham,  Dallas, \n2.  Report  of  SA  Robert  Murphy  and  SA  J.

Where  the  interview \nsubjects  agreed,  we  recorded  the  conversations  under  oath \nand  had  them  transcribed.  We  prepared memoranda  for  most  of \nthe  interviews  which  were  not  tape  recorded. \nSeveral  klansmen  and  former  acquaintances  of  Rowe  refused \nto  talk  to  the  Task  Force.  One  former  Eastview  13  informant \nwho  knew  Rowe  refused  to  be  interviewed  on  account  of  his \npoor  health. \nWe  learned  that the  Bureau  used  a  limited  amount  of \nelectronic  surveillance  on  some  suspects  at  the  height  of  the \nchurch  bombing  investigation.  We  reviewed  the  transcripts \nand  logs  from  these  installations,  and  in  certain instances, \ncompared  them  for  accuracy  against  the  tape  recordings  them \nselves.  A  microphone  was  placed  in  Gary  Thomas  Rowe's  auto \nmobile,  but mechanical  or  technical  problems  prevented  it from \nworking. \nWe  photocopied  over  5375  pages  from  Bureau  files,  which \nwere  arranged  chronologically  and  numbered  sequentially. \nFolders  were  set up  for  each  interview  subject  to  hold  relevant \ndocuments  from  FBI  files  and  interview  transcripts  or memo-\n4 \n\nranda.  Certain  folders  were  designated  by  number  only  to \nprotect  the  identities  of  FBI  informants.  Likewise,  we  created \npseudonyms  for  certain  informants  and  confidential  sources \nwho  are  discussed  in  the  final  report. \nExcept  for  the  Mobile  office,  we  found  only  a  handful  of \npages  and  documents  missing  from  the  hundreds  of  volumes  we \nexamined.  Most  of  these  documents  were,  in all  likelihood, \nnot missing,  but merely  improperly  numbered  by  the  file  clerks. \nWe  found  it most  unfortunate,  however,  to  discover  that one  of \nthese  missing  documents  appears  to  be  absent  from  Rowe's  infor \nmant  files.  Labelled  170-9-SF-206,  the  document  should  have \nbeen  entered  in  the  October  section of  his  1963  file--about \none  month  after  the  date  of  the  16th  Street Church  bombing. \nWe  investigated  the  matter,  however,  and  found  no  indication \nof wrongdoing. \nWe  also  discovered  that  the  Mobile,  Alabama,  field  office's \nentire  file  on  the  shooting  of  Viola  Liuzzo,  MO  44-1245,  was \ndestroyed  on  December  23,  1977,  long  before  the  Attorney  General \ncreated  the  Task  Force.  We  conducted  an  inquiry  into  the \ncircumstances  surrounding  this  file  destruction  and  concluded \nthat  the  Mobile  office  destroyed  the  file  after  the  Director \nhad  ordered  all field  offices  to  destroy  its criminal  files \nwhich  had  been  closed  for  over  five  years,  according  to  the \nFBI's  official  file  destruction program.[4]  Fortunately,  we \n4.  41  C.F.R.  101.11;  44  U.S.C.  3301-02. \n5 \n\nwere  able  to  reconstruct much  of  the  file  from  Department  FBI \nHeadquarters  and  Birmingham  field  office  files  and  do  not \nconsider  the  loss  of  these  files  to  have  significantly  inter-\nferred with  our  investigation. \nIn  this  report,  the  Task  Force  used  the  FBI's  numbering \nsystem in citations  referring  to  Bureau  documents.  The \nnumbering  system  generally  indicates:  (1)  the  classification \nor  type  of  investigative violations  or  administrative  area \ninvolved;  (2)  the  individual  case  file within  the  category; \nand,  (3)  the  serialization of  documents  in  the  file.  The \nsymbols  for  Headquarters  or  the  field  off ice  sending  and \n) \nreceiving  the  documents  and  the  title of  the  person  sending \nor  receiving  the  document  is  also  included  in  the  citation. \nFor  instance,  the  citation,  Teletype  from  BH  SAC  to  Director, \nHQ  157-~025-699,  indicates  that  the  Birmingham  Special  Agent \nin  Charge  sent  to  FBI  Headquarters  a  document,  now  found \nin  HQ  files,  which  was  the  699th  document  in  the  1025th \ncase  fileยท assigned  to  the  Racial  Matters  (157)  classifica-\ntion.  Similarly,  the  citation,  Memo  from  SA  Womack  to  BH \nSAC,  BH  157-352-4850,  refers  to  a  document,  found  in  the \nBirmingham  field  office  files,  from  Special  Agent  (SA) \nWomack  to  the  Birmingham  SAC  which  is  the  4850th  docu-\nment  in  the  352nd  case  file  assigned  to  the  Racial  Matters \nclassification. \n6 \n\nThe  Task  Force  photocopied  documents  from  Bureau  !iles \nwhich  were  arranged  chronologically  and  numbered  sequen \ntially.

Rowe  said  the \nagent  used  the  word  COINTELPRO,  and  instructed  Rowe  that  he \nwas  now  allowed  to  sleep with  klan wives,  spread  lies, \nfoment  dissension,  report  on  klan  political  affiliations, \nand  disrupt  the  political  campaigns  of  Mayor  Art  Hanes. \nRowe  first made  these  allegations  in  1975,  before  the \nSenate  Select  Conunittee  on  Intelligence  Activities,  and \nexpanded  upon  them  in his  autobiography  the  following \nyear.

[4]  Although  Rowe  talks  freely  about  his \n\"instructions,\"  he  is very  unspecific  about  what,  if anything, \nhe  actually  did,  other  than  professing  to  have  slept with  12 \nto  15  klan  wives  at the  behest  of  the  Bureau. [5]1 \nThe  COINTELPRO  program  against white-hate  groups  is \nwell  documented  in  Bureau  files,  which  were  created  at  a \ntime  when  it is  safe  to  say  that  no  one  dreamed  they  would \nbecome  public  knowledge.  It began  on  September  2,  1964, \nwhen  the  Director  circulated a  letter to  17  Southern  field \noffices  advising  that, \n\"effective  immediately,  the  Bureau  is \ninstituting a  coordinated  Counterintelligence \nProgram  (COINTELPRO)  directed  against \nklan-type  and  white-hate  organizations. \nOffices  receiving  copies  of  this  letter are \ninstructed to  immediately  open  an  active \ncontrol  file,  captioned  as  above,  and  to \nassign  responsibility  for  this  program  to \nan  experienced  and  imaginative  Special \nAgent  who  is well  versed  in  investigation \nof  hate  and  racist-type  organizations  and \ntheir membership.\"[6] \nThe  letter explained  that  the  purpose  of  the  program \nwas,  \"to  expose,  disrupt  and  otherwise  neutralize  the  activi-\nties of  the  various  klans  and  hate  organizations,  their \nleadership  and  adherents.\"  It emphasized  that,  \"we  must \nfrustrate  any  effort of  the  groups  to  consolidate  their \nforces  or  to  recruit  new  or youthful  adherents.\"  Participa-\nting offices were  directed  to  submit  to  Headquarters  an \n4.

[8]  Neither  involved  Rowe.  It appears \nthat  all  COINTELPRO  actions,  wherever  undertaken,  were \nhighly  defined,  specific  acts,  and  no  authorization was  ever \ngranted  for  the  kind  of  continuing  activity described by \nRowe.

Special  Agent  Byron \nMcFall  retired  in early  1964,  before  COINTELPRO  against  the \nklan  began,  and  he  resolutely  denies  that he  ever  gave \ninstructions  such  as  Rowe  described,  or  anything  like  them, \n[9]  and  says  he  was  unaware  of  the  program's  existence while \nin ยทBirmingham ..

Introduction \nThe  Task  Force's  starting point  for  under$tahding  the  FBI \nprocedures  for  handling  Gary  Thomas  Rowe  was  to  examine  those  rules, \nregulations,  and  guidelines  which  were  in effect while  Rowe  was  an \ninformant.  Between  November  19,  1978,  and March  26,  1979,  we \nrequested  the  FBI  to  provide  the  following  documents  covering  the \nrelevant  time  period  (1960-1965): \n(1)  All  general  FBI  guidelines  or  regulations  on \nhandling  informants; . \n(2)  From  Headquarters  and  Birmingham  and  Mobile  field \noffices,  FBI  files  170-00  and  137-00  consisting \nof  the  principal  instructions  on  the  handling  of \ninformants; \n(3)  Any  guidelines  or  regulations  on  the  use  of \n\"extremist\"  informants; \n(4)  Any  instructions  on  informants  given  to  FBI  agents \nat the  Bureau's  Quantico  Training  School; \n(5)  Any  instructions which  agents  were  expected  to \nadvise  informants  about  engaging  in violence  and \nany  explanatory  affidavits  from  present  or  former \nFBI  personnel; \n(6)  Any  instructions  on  what  agents  were  expected  to \nreport  about  violent  acts  which  an  informant may \nhave  conunitted. \nThe  following  section outlines  our  examination  and  analysis \nof  the  documents  the  FBI  provided  in  response  to our  requests. \n.  I \nWe  will  then  look  at how  FBI  personnel  understood,  interpreted, \nor knew  about  these  rules. \n12 \n\n2.  The  Importance  of  Informants \nThe  FBI  had  recognized  that  the  United  States_ government  has \nalways  used  informants  in  times  of war  and  peace,  to  combat  criminalE \nand  subversives.fl]  In  1946,  FBI  Director  Hoove~ instructed  all \nSpecial  Agents  in  Charge  to  exert pressure  on  agents  to  develop \ninformants.[2]  The  need  for  adequate  confidential  informant \ncoverage  was  continually  stressed  in bulletins,  letters,  conferences, \nand  field  inspections.[3] \nIn  1950,  he  wrote  to  twelve  top  FBI  officials  and  stated  that \nthere  was  a  \"deplorable  lack  of  confidential  informants  developed \nby  the  field  office.\"[4]  The  FBI  its concern  in 1955[5] \nr~stated \nand  19 5 9 . [ 6] \nOn  October  17-18,  1960,  the  FBI  held  a  conference  in New \nOrleans  on  the  development  and  maintenance  of  informants.  There \na  Headquarters  official  stressed  the  importance  of  getting  informants \ninto  the  \"inner  groups\"  of  the  klan,  so  as  to  prevent  the  bombings \n1.

Following  the  disappearances  of \ncivil  rights  workers  Michael  Schwerner,  Andrew  Goodman,  and  James \nChaney  from  Philadelphia,  Mississippi,  on  June  21,  1964,  the  FBI \ninformed  all  field  offices  in  the  South.that  continuing  acts  of \nracial violence  including  bombings,  shootings,  killings,  assaults, \nand  church  bombings  made  it essential  to  develop  more  informants \nwithin  klan  organizations,  especially  in what  Director Hoover \ncalled  the  \"hard  core\"  groups. [9] \nJust  six days  later,  the  Director  advised  all field  offices \nthat President Johnson  was  depending  on .the  FBI  \"for necessary \naction  in  connection with  the  current  racial  situation\"  and  advised \neach  office  to  give  the  highest priority  to  developing  more  racial \ninformants[lO]  including  klan  organizations.

[12] \n3.  What  Is  An  Informant \nFBI  informants  such  as  Gary  Thomas  Rowe,  who  penetrated klan \nI \ngroups  were  considered  \"racial  informants,\"  under  the  FBI's  Manual \nof  Instructions. [13] \nBefore  1964,  the  FBI  defined  a  racial  informant  as  an: \nIndividual  actively  engaged  in  obtaining  and \nfurnishing  current  information  on  racial  matters \nexclusively  for  the  Bureau  and  whose  identity must \nbe  protected.  Should  be  a  member  or  attend meetings \nof  klan  and  similar  hate-type  organizations  which \nhave  a  propensity  for  violence  or which  strive \nto  deny  individuals  certain constitutional  rights \nby  use  or  threat of  such  violence;  or  should  be  in \nsuch  a  position  relative  to  these  organizations \nthat he  can  obtain  and  does  provide  current  infor \nmation  of  value  concerning  them. [14] \nIn  January  1964,  the  FBI  created  a  new  section  of  the  Manual \nto  cover  racial  informants  but  left this  definition  and  the \ngoverning  rules  and  regulations  essentially unchanged. [15] \nEven  before  Rowe  became  an  informant,  the  Bureau  recognized \nthat many  informants  in both  the  racial  and  criminal  fields \nwere  themselves  criminal: \n12.

Developing  Informants \nBefore  designating  someone  as  an  FBI  \"racial  informant,\"  the \nagency  placed  him  on  probationary  status  and  called him  a  \"potential \nracial  informant.\"  Potential  racial  informants  were  those who  were \n\"in a  position  to  become  active\"  in klan  groups  and  who  tried  to \nobtain  from  them  information  for  the  Bureau. [19]  Until  1964,  the \nproper  procedures  for  developing  and  for  handling  racial  informants \nwere  set forth  in  ยงยง  107  and  108  of  the  FBI  Manual  of  Instructions. \nUnderยง  108  M 8  a  (1) (a),  the  field was  to  conduct  an  extensive \nbackground  investigation on  a  potential  racial  informant  before \n16.

The  background  investigation \nincluded:  (1)  checking  field  office  files  fo~ derogatory  infor \nmation;  (2)  obtaining  information  about  his  personal  history, \nhealth,  reliability,  stability,  integrity,  genera+  reputation, \nand  employment;  (3)  checking  his  credit and  arrest  records;  and \n(4)  determining  his  domestic  status,  including  possible marital \ndifficulties.  Once  this  investigation was  completed,  the  field \nhad  to  conclude  that  the  potential  racial  informant  could  be  used \n\"without  danger  of  embarrassment  to  the  Bureau,\"[20]  and  had  to \nverify  to  Headquarters  that he  possessed  stability,  reliability, \nand  had  been  indoctrinated against disclosing  his  confidential \nrelationship with  the  FBI.  The  applicable Manual  of  Instructions \ndid  not  define  either  the  term  \"stability\"  or  \"reliability.\" \nThe  FBI  recognized  that although  its informants  did  not  have \nto  be  \"lily-white,\"  Headquarters  would  not  approve  anyone  who  had \nan  unsatisfactory  service  record,  used  narcotics  or whiskey,  or \nengaged  in  sex  perversion. [21]  However,  there  is no  record  that \nthe  Bureau would  reject a  potential  racial  informant  if they  knew \nhe  had  engaged  in violence  in  the  past  or might  do  so  in  the  future. \nTo  obtain  a  potential  racial  informant's  cooperation,  agents \nwere  instructed  to  exploit mutual  interest,  such  as  sports  topics \nand  hobbies.[22] \n20.

The  field \na \nhad  to  show  that  the  candidate  would  not  present  \"danger  of \nembarrassment  to  the  Bureau\"  and  to  certify his  \"stability,\" \n\"reliability,\"  and  \"indoctrination against  [the]  disclosure\"  of \nhis  confidential  relationship with  the  FBI. [24]  In  addition,  the \nfield  office  had  to  show  that  the  potential  racial  informant would \ncontinue  to  provide  the  Bureau with  valuable  information. \n5.  The  Handling  of  Racial  Informants \na.)  Payments \nThe  Special Agent  in Charge  could  authorize  a  payment  to \nan  informant  of  up  to  $200  without  Headquarter's  approval.[25] \nBefore  making  additional  payments,  the  SAC  had  to  send  to  Head-\nquarters  a  \"letter of  justification\"  every  four  months,  which \nincluded  the  following: [26] \n(1)  Current membership  in  \"subversive\"  organizations; \n(2)  A  summary  of  information  recently  furnished; \n(3)  Any  information  he  provided which  was  of \nunusual  value  to  the  FBI; \n(4)  The  number  of  reports  the  informant  submitted; \n23.

In  1952,  Director  Hoover  stated  that \ninformants  \"are  not  in any  sense  Federal  employees.  Each \ninformant  thoroughly  understands  his  position  in  this  regard \nand  operates  as  an  independent  contractor.\"  [29]  The  FBI \n27.

Supervision ยทof .Informants \nThere  are  records  which  indicate  that  the  FBI  was  most \nconcerned  about  insuring  that  their  informants  be  adequately \nsupervised.  In  1952,  Director  Hooverยท indicated he  was  concerned \nabout  informants  exposing  the  identities  of  other  informants. [32] \nAlso,  the  Bureau was  quite  concerned  that  agents  were  accepting \ninformation  from  informants  \"at  face  value\" [33]  and  instructed \nagent  handlers  to  be  on  guard  against  \"false  or  speculative \ninformation\"  and,  if discovered,  to  report  it immediately  to \nHeadquarters. [34]  The  Director maintained  that: \nInformants  are  essentially double-crossers; \n~informants should  not  be  given  information  .โขโขโข  [35] \n30.

[37]  Headquarters \nemphasized  that  agents  constantly  review  the  \"reliability\"  of \ntheir  informants. [38] \nAgents  were  never  allowed  to  offer  their  informant  alcohol[39] \nor  other  gifts.

Illegal Acts  and  Violence \nThe  FBI's  regulations  did  not  specifically  instruct agents \nto warn  informants  that  they  were  not  to  violate  any  federal,  state, \nor  local  law.  Agents  were,  however,  told  to  advise  their  informants \nthat they  would  be  subject  to  federal  \"impersonation\"  statutes  if \nthey  ever  claimed  to  be  FBI  undercover  agents.

The \nDepartment  concluded  that an  informant  is not  immune  from  \"prose-\ncution  for  actions  which  could  subject  a  Federal  enforcement \nofficer  to  prosecution,\"{50]  but  he  would  not  be  prosecuted  if \nhis  intent was  to  assist the  government  in  its enforcement  of  the \nlaw.[51]  Headquarters  placed  pertinent  sections  of  this  opinion \nletter in  the  Manual  of  Instructions  for  Criminal  Informants. [52] \nHowever,  they  issued  no  instructions  on  what  field  offices ยทshould \ndo  after  receiving  allegations  or  reports  that an  informant \nviolated  the  law.

An  agent  from  the  Birming-\nham  office  reported: \nThe  problem  is how  to  get  information  into  that \ninner  group.  It is pointed  out  that  this  problem was \ndiscussed  [at  the  conference],  but was  never  satis \nfactorily  solved.  In  other words,  our  policy  is not \nto  ask  the  informant  to  engage  in  any  forms  of  violence. \nIf he  does  not  get  selected  for  the  inner  group  or \nden,  he  may  never  know  what  is actually  going  on, \nas  far  as  violence  is  concerned. [53] \nThe  Headquarters  official  indicated  that  field  offices  should  not \ndisseminate  information  on  cross  burnings  since  \"informants  may \nassist  in  cross  butnings.\"[54] \nIn  1964,  Headquarters  advised  Birmingham  that  informants \nsuch  as  Rowe  were  not  permitted  to  serve  in positions where  they \nlead  or  instigate violence.  Rowe  was  consequently  ordered  not \nto direct,  lead,  or  instigate  any  acts  of  violence,  but was \n53.  SA  Stanberry  to  BH  SAC,  supra  n.  7  at  222,  226. \n54.

If Rowe  was  unable  to  contact  the  office  about \nproposed  violence  he  was  expected  to  participate  in,  \"he  should \nbe  instructed  to  avoid  participation wherever  possible.\"[56] \nThe  Manual  of  Instructions  did  provide  some  guidance  on \nhow  racial  informants  should  behave  within  the  klan.  For  example, \nthey were  expected  to  converse  with,  and  not  just observe,  other \nklansmen. [ 5 7] \nThe  FBI  recently  explained  to  the  Task  Force  how  agents \nwere  instructed  in  the  1960's  to  handle  informants  who  encountered \nviolent  situations: \nThe  Department  of  Justice  task  force. looking  into \nthe  FBI's  handling  of  former  Ku  Klux  Klan  informant \nGary  Thomas  Rowe  has  access  to FBI  investigative  files, \nincluding  the  control  files  concerning  criminal  and \nracial  informants,  namely  137-00  and  170-00,  respectively. \nDuring  the  course  of  their  file  reviews  and  as  a  result \nof  interviews  with  former  and  current FBI  personnel, \nthe  task  force  believes  the  area  of  official instruc \ntions which  the  Agent  was  required  to  give  informants \nlacked  some  essential points.  These  points  are  the \nconunitting  of  violence  and  whether  an  Agent  should \nreport  such  activity  to  superiors,  both  in  the  field \nand  to  FBI  Headquarters  (FBIHQ). \n55.  Memorandum  from  Director  to  BH  SAC,  May  4,  1964; \nBH  170-9-299A;  Task  Force  2661. \n56.  Id. \n57.  FBI  Manual  of  Instructions,  ยง  107  F  9  b. \n25 \n\nIn  response  to  th~ ta~k force  gerieral  inquiry, \nthere  follows  a  sununary  of  information which will \nbe  helpful  to  the  task  force  in understanding  the \nbackground  in  these matters: \nOne  of  the most  traditional  and  basic  activities \nof  an  FBI  Agent  or  official  is  the  developmeht  and \nhandling  of  informants.  This  important  function \nhas  been  constantly  emphasized  and  followed  through \nout most  of  the  FBI's  history, .with more  particular \nemphasis  and  stress  being  afforded  these matters \nafter World  War  II.  The  repetition and  concern \ntransmitted  to  the  individual  Agent  and  to  the \nSpecial  Agent  in Charge  (SAC)  amounted  to  a  massive \nprogram  of  constant  periodic  reiteration  to  the \nextent  that all  involved  in  the  program  could  not \nhelp  but  to  accept  the  fundamental  premise  that \nillegal acts  cannot  be  condoned.  From  the  period \nof  new  Agent's  training,  through. in-service  schools, \nSAC  Memoranda  and  other  conununications,  the  Agent \nand  SAC  were  constantly  pressed  for  both  developing \ninformants  and  simultaneously  in not  taking  any \naction which  would  bring .the  FBI  into  disrepute \nor  embarrassment.  Any  deviation,  misperformance, \nor  lack  of  performance  on  the  part of  FBI  personnel \nwas  the  subject of  implied  disciplinary  action,  if \nnot  actual  disciplinary  action. \nWith  the  above  emphasis  clearly  in mind,  no \nspecific  document  appears  in FBI  files  which  covers \nthe  full  spectrum of  informant  development  or \nhandling.  One  must  recognize  that the  FBI,  as \nan  institution,  learned  from  situations  and  events, \nincluding mistakes,  and  the  procedures  governing \ninformants  developed .step by  step.  Consequently, \nto  look  back  at this  stage  and  ask  specific questions \nas  to whether  certain instructions  existed  in  the \nearly  1960's,  such  as  \"Were  informants  instructed \nnot  to  commit  acts  of  violence?\"  has  to  be  con \nsidered  in  the  broad  spectrum of  informant  develop \nment  and  handling. \nSpecifically,  no  such written  instructions \nwere  located;  however,  documents  which  cover  areas \nclose  to  this  issue were  located which,  when  read, \ncould  lead  a  reasonable  person  to  conclude  FBI \nprocedures.were  such  that an  Agent  would  both warn \nan  informant  about  the  consequences  of  the  informant's \nillegal acts  to  the  appropriate  authorities,  should \n26 \n\nan  informant  so  reveal  such  activity  to  the  handling \nAgent  or the  Agent  receives  such  data  from  other \nsources.  Any  failure  to  do  so  would  be  the  failure \nof  an  Agent  who  \"risked\"  such  action  on  his  own  and \nwas  not  an  institutional  failure. \nRather  than  state  the  specific  step-by-str.p \ndevelopment  of  informants  and  their handling,  there \nis enclosed  a  selection  of  documents  which  appear \nin  FBI  central  files,  which,  when  read  in  order  and \nas  a  whole,  display  the  FBI's  concern  and  basic \ninstructions  for  an  Agent  developing  and  handling \nan  informant. \n*  *  * \nIn  brief  summary,  the  above  documents  on  an \nindividual  basis  may  not  appear  to  show  the  concern \nand  extent  of  instructions  on  specific  points  Agents \nwere  required  to  follow  in  developing  and  handling \ninformants.  Further,  the  above  documents  are  not \nfully  complete  as  a  massive  survey  of  our  files \nwould  be  required  to  cover  each  and  every  situation \nand  event  which  has  occurred  in  the  past.  There  is, \nhowever,  a  sufficient  amount  of  material  enclosed \ntherein  to  verify  both  the  complexity,  the  serious \nness,  and  the  parameters  of  instructions  which  would \nnot  allow  illegal  activity  on  the  part  of  an  infor \nmant  to  go  unnoticed  or  unreported. [58] \nIn  sum,  a  thorough  file  search  by  the  Task  Force  and  the  FBI \nuncovered  no  document  which  definitively  set  forth  whether  there \nwas  a  permissible  level  of  violence  for  informants  such  as  Rowe. \nThe ยทFBI  maintains  that  it conducted  a  massive  program  to \ninsure  that  its personnel  understood  that  illegal  acts  would \nnot  be  condoned.  However,  we  are  forced  to  conclude  from \nour  review  of  the  files  that  there  is  little documentary \nevidence  to  support  this  view.  In  addition,  we  could  find \nno  guidelines  which  would  have  assisted the  agent  handler \nand  his  superiors  to  determine  whether  there  were  any \n58.  Memorandum  from  FBI  to  the  Task  Force,  Mar.  29,  1979. \n- 27  -\n\nsituations  in which  the  FBI  would  allow  an  informant  to  engage \nin  \"minor\"  unlawful  or violent  conduct  in  order  to  obtain  from \nhim  valuable  information  of  extraordinarily  dangerous  violence, \nsuch  as  a  planned  bombing.  Yet  the  record  clearly  demonstrates \nI \nthat  Headquarters  wanted  the  field  agents  to  develop  as  many \ninformants  as  possible  and  constantly  pressured  them  to  do  so. \nIt is  also  clear that  the  handling  agents  were  not  given \nenough  guidance  in writing  on  how  to  handle  someone  like  Rowe. \nFor  example,  if Rowe  reported  that  he  and  other  klansmen  had \njust attacked  some  blacks  who  were  attempting  to  integrate  a \nlocal  restaurant,  it is  not  at  all  clear that  the  agent  would \nknow  how  he  ought  properly  to  respond. \nShould  the  agent  have  reported  the  facts  to  Headquarters \nimmediately?  Should  Rowe  have  been  admonished  not  to  engage  in  such \nactivity  in the  future?  Should  either the  agent  or  Headquarters \nhave  recommended  that  Rowe  be  terminated?  What  action,  if any, \nshould  the  Special  Agent  in  Charg~ take?  What  objective  standards \nshould  the  SAC  or  Headquarters  have  applied  to  determine  whether \nto  terminate  him?  Should  the  SAC  have  immediately  conducted  an \nindependent  investigation of  the  facts  surrounding  the  restaurant \nbeating  to  insure  that  Rowe's  role  was  as  he  described  it?  Should \nthe  field  office  have  advised  the  local  police  of  the  incident, \nwhile  revealing,  or  not  revealing,  Rowe's  identity?  FBI  regulations \nin effect at the  time  provided  no  answers  to  these  questions. \n28 \n\nAPPENDIX  lI.I. \nHANDLING  OF  FBI  INFORMANTS \nB.  HOW  THEY  OPERATED  IN  PRACTICE \nThe  Task  Force  attempted  to  determine  how  th~ FBI  rules \nand  regulations  on  informants  were  interpreted  and  understood \nat all  levels within  the  Bureau  and  by  FBI  informants. \n1.  Supervisory  Persons \nAlex  Rosen,  SAC,  Inspector,  Assistant  Director,  and \nAssistant  to  the  Director  of  the  FBI[l]  was  the  highest  ranking \nofficial we  interviewed.  For  29  years,  Mr.  Rosen  headed  the \ndivision  responsible  for  all civil rights  and  criminal \ncases,[2]  and  in  that capacity  played  a  supervisory  role \nin every  major  case  the  FBI  handled  until his  retirement. [3] \nUnder  his  tenure  at  the  Bureau,  Mr.  Rosen  stated  that \nagents  were  required  to  tell their  informants  that  the  FBI \nwould  not  protect  them  if they  were  found  violating  the  law, \nand  would  treat them  like  any  other  law-breaker.[4] \nRosen  emphasized  that  the  FBI  would 'never  allow  a  klan \ninformant  to  engage  in violence,  even  if that would  be  the \nonly  way  for  him  to  obtain  good  information.  \"It could  not \nbe  countenanced  under  any  circumstances.  It was  never \n1.  Alex  Rosen  Interview by  Task  Force,  Mar.  8,  1979,  2-3. \n2.  Id.,  3. \n3.  Id.,  4. \n4.  10-13. \n~~-' \n\njustified,\"  he  stated. [5]  Rosen  said  the  FBI  followed  a \npolicy  of  terminating  an  informant's  services  and  of  sending \nan  inspector  to  in~estigate, after  receiving  a  report  that \nan  informant  was  violent.  The  inspector would  thln  de~ide \nwhether  to  refer  the  matter  to  local  prosecutive  authorities. [6] \nFor  example,  Rosen  would  consider  it intolerable  and  a \n\"serious  offense\"  for  a  klan  informant  to  take  part  in  beating \nup  blacks  with  other  klansmen  and  would  have  recommended \nreporting  the  incident  to  the  local  police. [7] \nRosen  maintained  that  informants  were  fully  capable  of \ngetting  information  about  klan  activities without  engaging \nin violence,  merely  by  being  close  to  the  leadership which \nwas  carrying  out  the  klan's  policy  of  violence.  [8]  He \nstressed  that handling  agents  were  required  to  reduce  each \noral  informant  report  to writing[9]  and  to  communicate  to \nHeadquarters  any  information  that  an  informant  had  engaged \nin violence. [ 10] \nJoseph  Deegan,  a  supervisor  in  the  FBI's  Civil  Rights \nSection,  Criminal  Division,  administered  the  racial  informant \nprogram  for  the  entire  United  States  between  approximately \n5.

[11]  He \nwas  the  first non-clerical  Headquarters  employee  who  reviewed \nincoming  correspondence  about  racial  informants.  Addition-\nally,  he  drafted  any  correspondence  from  Headquarters  to  a \nI \nfield  office  about  racial  informants  and  obtained  approval \nfrom  at  least one  higher  FBI  official before  sending  it out. \nWhile  he  supervised  activities  of  the  field's  racial \ninformants,  Deegan  expected  that  all  \"investigative \nactivity~ \nof  an  informant was  to  be  made  a  matte~ of  record.  He \nconceded  that defining  this  term was  left in  part. to  an \nagent's  discretion.  However,  all oral  reports  provided  by \ninformants  were  to  be  placed  in  the  informant's  file,  inclu-\nding  any  violence  he  was  involved  in.  Headquarters  expected \nto  be  told  about  an  informant's  unlawful  conduct. \nIn  terms  of  violence,  Deegan  told  us  that  the  FBI's \npolicy was  clear,  concise,  and  absolute  -- informants  were \nnot  to  participate  in violence  in  any  form  under  any  circum-\nstances.  Additionally,  informants  were  not  even  to  be \npresent when  violence  occurred,  unless  their presence  could \nnot  be  avoided.  Al though we  told Mr.  Deegan  that  some  agยทents \nencouraged  Rowe  to  be  at the  scene  of  klan  violence,  Deegan \nsaid that  the  Bureau  was  quite  capable  of  getting effective \nintelligence  information  about  klan  activity without  allow-\ning  its informants  to  observe  violence. \n11.  Joseph  Deegan  Interview by  Task  Force,  Apr.  25,  1979. \n31 \n\nHeadquarters  continuously  provided  informant  classes \nand  in-service  training  on  handling  informants  to  field \nagents.  Deegan  was  an  instructor  in  some  classes.  He \nspecifically  recalled  outlining what  agents  sho.uld  do  if an \nI \n,  informant  was  ordered  to  partLcipate  in  racial  violence, \nsuch  as  beating  up  blacks  in  a  restaurant.  The  informant \nwas  to  be  instructed  that  he  could  not  participate  even  if \ninformation  about  the  other  perpetrators  could  only  be \nobtained  through  the  informant's  participation.  An  informant \nwas  told  that under  these  circumstances,  he  would  just have \nto work  hard  in  other ways  at getting  the  needed  intelligence. \nMr.  Deegan  also  discussed  the  differences  between  pro-\nbationary  informants  (PCI)  and  full  informants.  While  the \nformer  was  considered  by  the  FBI  to  be  less  reliable,  he  was \nnot  given  any  leeway  to  participate  in  violence  or  other \nillegal  activity. \nFormer  Inspector  James  L .  .McGovern,  SAC  in  Birmingham \nafter  Rowe's  time,  [12)  stated emphatically  that  the  FBI \nwould  not  allow  its  informants  to  engage  in  any  violence. \n[13)  Reports  of  an  informant  engaging  in  violence,  such \nas  floggings,  should  have  been  immediately  sent  to  the \nDirector,  he  stated,  who  would  have  ordered  to  terminate \n12.

Rather  than  tolerate  such \nconduct,  the  FBI  preferred  to  do  without .the  information.  115] \nRaymond  L.

[19] \nBoth  men  told  the  Task  Force  that  informants  were  not \nallowed  to  participate  in violence  in  any  way.  [20]  While \nJensen  could  not  recall whether  this  policy was  in writing, \nhe  recalled  that  informants  were  supposed  to  be  specifically \ninstructed  to  avoidยท being  in  a  position where  they  would  be \ninvolved  in violent  activity.

[24]  Agents  were  expected  to  do  everything \npossible  to  see  that  an  informant  provided  good \n~nformation, \nand  yet  at the  same  time,  not  allow  him  to  engage  in  any  un-\nlawful  acts.  An  informant  is  faced  then  and  now,  with  an \nexacting  challenge  -- to  associate with  law-breakers  without \nhimself  breaking  the  law.  [25] \nIf he  had  known  Rowe  had  taken  part  in violence,  Faisst \nsaid he  would  have  terminated  him  [26]  and  even  considered \ncalling his  activity  to  the  attention of  prosecuting \nauthorities,  [27]  and  ASAC  Jensen  would  have  immediately  noti-\nfied  FBI  Headquarters  for  advice.  [28] \nFaisst expected  agents  to  see  that  their  informants \nreceived  proper  instructions  and  guidance,  [29]  but  he  would \nnot  have  held  the  agent  responsible  for  the  unlawful  act  of \nhis  informant.  \"I  can't visualize  any  law  enforcement  officer \n23.

[40] \nAfter  Kemp  resigned  from  the  Bureau  to  ente~ private \n(  . \nlaw  practice,  Byron  McFall  was  Rowe's  agent  handler  until \nMcFall's  retirement  in  December  1963.  [41]  McFall  considered \nRowe  to  be  the  FBI's  most  valuable  klan  informant  in  Birming-\nham  [42]  because  of  his  ability  to  get  close  to  klan  leaders. \n[43] \nAlthough  he  advised  Rowe  not  to  engage  in klan  violence, \nMcFall  recognized  that  Rowe  considered  these  instructions \nimpossible  to  follow.  McFall  told  Rowe  that  he  should  \"stay \nwith\"  the  klansmen  doing  the  violence  until  he  could  break \naway  and  report  it to  the  FBI.  [44]  Although  McFall  tried \nto monitor  Rowe's  reports  by  examining  the  reports  of  other \nklan  informants,  he  never  told  Rowe  that he  had  other  klan \ninformants.

[48] \nBlake  considered  Rowe  an  important  klan  inf9rmant,  as \ndemonstrated  by  the  fact  that  Rowe  received  regular  payments, \nwhereas  other  informants  were  generally  paid  only  when \nthey  provided  information.  [49] \nBlake  developed  a  close  personal  relationship with \nRowe,  [SO]  and  made  \"him  realize  that he  was  an  'operative' \nfor  the  government,\"  [Sl]  because  Rowe  fancied  his  role  as  a \nlaw  enforcement  officer  and  liked  to  feel  as  if he  was  an  FBI \nagent.  [S2] \nBlake  tried to  confirm  Rowe's  reports  through  other \nsources  of  information  [S3]  and  never  completely  trusted \nRowe.  \"You  hoped  [informants]  would  follow  your  guidance  and \n[the  agent  would]  pray  a  lot.\"  [S4]  When  Blake  caught  Rowe \nmaking  a  report  that was  inconsistent with  other  informant \n47.

He  may  have  to  take  a  punch \nor  a  swing  as  an  action  team  is moving  in.  So  I \nwould  caution  him  [as  to]  what  certain  levels  of \nviolence  he  should  become  involved  in.  [57] \nWhile  Blake  coached  Rowe  \"not  to  be  a  leader  in violence \nand  take  a  low-key  part  in  it,\"  [58]  Rowe  was  allowed  to  hit \npeople  and  throw  fists  and,  in  Blake's words,  \"his  fist was \nprobably  as  dangerous  as  some  dangerous  weapons,  and  as  I \nrecall,  he  was  trained  in  judo  or  karate  or  something.\"  [59] \nHe  had  to  engage  in  this limited violence,  Blake  reasoned, \nto  keep  his  cover  as  an  informant.  [60]  Rowe  had  to  partici-\npate  in occasional  acts  of  violence  so  that  he  could  report \non  violent  crimes,  \"but  if he  was  out every  night,  making  it \n55.

[62]  Nevertheless,  he  warned \nRowe  not  to  instigate  vio~ence,  [63]  since  such  ~onduct would \nhave  constituted  an  embarassment  to  the  Bureau.  [64]  Blake \nwas  confident  that  Rowe  did  not  instigate violence  because \nRowe  knew  \"he'd be  in hot water  and  that  I  would  report  him.\"[65] \nInitially,  Blake  informed  the  Task  Force  that  he  made \n-whatever  Rowe  told him  a  matter  of  record,  [66]  ,but  later \namended  this  by  saying  that  he  did  not  make  a  record  of  Rowe's \nreports  that  he  had  \"thrown  fists\"  because  to  stay  in  the \nklan  \"action groups\"  and  to  keep  furnishing  information,  he \nhad  to  \"do  something\"  violent.  [67]  While  Blake  conceded  that \n.FBI  Headquarters  may  not  have  wanted  Rowe  to  get  into  fist \nfights,  he  stated  that  this  position was  unrealistic: \nIt would  be  totally  stupid  and  ridiculous \nfor  me  as  a  field  agent  that  I  ought  to  have  a \ngood  informant,  that  had  to  stand  out  in  a  crowd \nand  not  do  anything,  if he  was  in  a  position  report \ning  violence.  I  would  tell the  inspector  or  super \nvisor  he's  out  of  his  mind  and  [should]  find  some \nbody  else  to handle  [Rowe].  [68] \n61.  Id. ,  Vol.  II  at  31. \n62.

[69]  How-\never,  Blake  maintained  that  he  recorded  reports  when  Rowe \nI \ndid  \"anything more  serious\"  than  use  his  fists  in  klan  fights. \n[70] \nNeil  P.  Shanahan  was  Rowe's  last handling  agent,  from \nSeptember  1964,  and  throughout  the  time  he  served  as  a  wit-\nness  in  the  Liuzzo  murder  and  civil  rights  trials.  Shanahan \nreceived  FBI  training on  handling  informants,  consulted  the \nFBI  Manual,  and  drew  on  the  experience  of  other  agents.  [71] \nWhen  he  started .handling  Rowe,  Shanahan  was  told  that  Rowe \nwas  the  most  valuable  source  of  information  the  FBI  had  in  the \nklan.  Rowe  was  \"our  ace  in  the  hole\"  [72]  at getting  \"the \nmost  accurate,  the  best,  the  up-to-the-minute  information.\"  [73] \nRowe's  information was  used  to  see  that  the  klan  \"disbanded \nI \nand  no  longer  functioned  as  an  organization which  would  com-\nmit  murder,  violence,  [and]  mayhem.\"  [74] \nShanahan  told  Rowe  that  there was  no  justification for \nan  informant  to  engage  in  \"affirmative  acts\"  of  violence  such \n69.

(77] \nShanahan  reported  all  information  from  Rowe  he  considered \n\"pertinent  to  [the  FBI's]  overall mission.\"(78]  Nobody  in \nthe  Bureau  ever  advised  him  that  he  had  to  record  in  FBI \nfiles  reports  that  Rowe  had  conunitted  violence, [79]  although \nhe  probably  would  have  done  so. [80]  Shanahan  believed he \nhad  sole  discretion  and  \"was  the  judge\"  as  to what  to  put  in \nRowe's  file  and  to  conununicate  to  others  within  the  Bureau. [81] \n3.  Other  FBI  Agents \nRobert  Murphy,  the  agent  who  handled  informant  \"Huey \nLipscomb,\"[82]  recalled  that official  Bureau  policy was  for \ninformants  to  avoid  violence  or  \"bad  deeds.\"[83] \n75. \n76. \n77. \n78. \n79. \n80. \n81. \n82.

[84] \nI \nMurphy  contended  that  a  specific  report  that  Rowe  had  been \ninvolved  in  \"missionary work\"  and  had  taken  part  in beating  up \nblack  people  was: \n[A]  piece  of  trivia as  far  as  I'm  concerned \nat that  point  in  time.  There  was  no  violation \nof  Federal  law;  there  was  nothing  we  could  act \non;  there was  nothing we  could  do. [85] \nHe  further  believed  that  referring  such  matters  to  local \nprosecutive  authorities  would  not  have  resulted  in  any \nprosecutive  action  at  that  time  in  Birmingham.  \"It was \nalmost  a  foregone  conclusion  that  prosecutions  of white  men \ndid  not  take  place  as  long  as  they  visited their violence \nupon  black men,  and  it was  that very  thing  that we  were \nattempting  to  change  and  to  move.\"[86]  Murphy  was  required \nto  report  immediately  to  the  SAC  any  incidents  of  violence \nby  informants. [87] \n4.  The  Views  of  Informants \nOf  the  nine  klan  informants  interviewed,  we  found  none  who \nsaid  that the  FBI  encouraged  them  to  take  part  in klan  violence. \n84.

I \nhave  considered  such  a  warning  unnecessary  because  he  claimed \nnever  to  have  engaged  in violence. 189]  Both  Roebuck[90]  and \nSpaulding  Rutledgef91]  did  not  expect  any  preferential prosecu-\ntive  treatment on  account  of  their FBI  relationships. \nNorwood  Ensley  remembers  the  FBI  telling him  that  if he \nengaged  in violence,  he  did  so  at his  own  risk. [92]  While \nhis  handling  agent,  C.  B.  Stanberry,  advised  him  to  carry  a \ngun  when  around  other klansmen,  Ensley  was  advised  only  to \nuse  it in  self-defense. [93] \nCliff Vanderbilt  recalls  his  handling  agent  telling him \nto  avoid  violence.  [94]  He  said his  handling  agent  told \nhim  about  tablets,  which  he  never  used,  [95]  to make  himself \nsick  if he  needed  an  excuse  to  avoid  it.  [96] \n88.

Rowe' s  Views \nWhen  Gary  Thomas  Rowe  started working  as  an  informant  he \nwas  told  to  gather  information  about  everything which  related \nto  the  kl an  including  planned  or  actual  violence . [97]  \"Don't \n1 \ndo  nothing,  don't  say  nothing;  just  stand  back  and  report what \nhappens.  Stay  out of  it  [violence].\"[98]  At  the  second  state \ntrial,  Rowe  testified when  asked  whether  anyone  at the  FBI \nsuggested  that  Rowe  commit  violence: \nQuite  the  contrary.  I  have  been  instructed \nnumerous  of  [sic]  times:  'Do  not  antagonize,  parti \ncipate,  do  not  get  involved  in  any  violence.' [99] \nRowe  stated  that  these  instructions  changed  when  the  FBI \nconcluded  that  Rowe  was  not  getting  information  about  planned \nviolence  merely  through  attending  the  klan's  open  klavern \nmeetings.  Rowe  was  instructed  to  \"get  closer\"  to  the  klansmen \nwho  met  in  a  small  group  after  the  meetings. [100]  Following \nthis  instruction,  Rowe  began  to  participate  in violent  acts. [101] \nRowe  swore  that  he  never,  however,  instigated violence[l02] \nand  was  told  not  to  plan  it either. [103] \n97.

And  I'm going Ito  stand \nover  here  to  the  sideline  and  take  names?  I'd stand \nout  like  a  sore  thumb. \nRowe  recalls  the  FBI  specifically  instructing  Rowe  to \n\"stay  away\"  from  bombs. [105] \nRowe  contends  that  at  some  point  in  his  career  as  an \ninformant,  the  FBI  declared war  on  the  klan.  He  was  told  to \n\"do  whatever  has  to  be  done  to  disrupt  the  klan.\"[106]  After \nthis  \"declaration of war,\"  Rowe  was  told  that  agents  no  longer \nhad  to  cover  up  Rowe's  participation  in violence.  He  could \ncommit  beatings  on  buses  and  at  restaurants  with  blackjacks, \nchains,  and  pistols. [107]  In  order  to  obtain  the  information \nthe  FBI  needed  from  the  klan  action  squads,  he  said  in his \nbook  that he  had  to  participate  to  the  extent  the  others  did: [108] \nAnyone  the  [klan]  activists  thought  was  timid,  they \nnaturally would  have  nothing  to  do  with,  and  before  a  man \ncan  gain  entry to  these  squads,  he  must  be  accepted  on \ntheir  terms.  ยท \n104.

[109] \n6.  The  Danger  of  \"Exposure\" \nIn  understanding  the  FBI's  handling  of  Rowe,  the  reader \nshould  understand  that  Rowe  may  have  had  to  do  and  say  things \nmerely  to  avoid  being  identified as  an  FBI  informant.  Most  klan \ninformants  and  FBI  agents  we  interviewed maintained  that  informants \nif exposed,  stood  to  lose  their  lives. [110] \nTo  dispel  suspicion,  informants  were  forced  to  resort  to \nunconventional  and  unpredictable  behavior.  Special  Agent  Murphy \ntold us  that when  Huey  Lipscomb  was  seen  talking  to  him, \nLipscomb  later told  the  suspicious  klansmen  that  he  was \nconspiring with  the  FBI  to  obtain  a  list of  all  informants \nthe  FBI  had  planted  in  the  klan. [111]  Thomas  OWenton,  who \nassociated with  one  of  the  klan's  most  dangerous  persons, \nsaid he  deliberately  talked  like  an  \"agitator\"  to  appear  as \nmean  as  his  klan  associates  were.

[113] \nCliff Vanderbilt[ll4]  said  that  the  klansmen  frequently \ntested others  to  see  if they  could  figure  out who  among  them \nwas  an  informant.  He  said he  was  able  to  avoid  suspicion  by \nengaging  in  the  following  conversation,  which  he  acted  out \nfor  our  benefit,  pretending  he  was  at  a  klavern meeting: \n[115] \nVanderbilt:  This  country  is  in  one  hell  of  a \nshape.

Obviously,  they  must  have  some  kind  of  hold \non  him  to make  him  do  the  things  that  he  is  doing \nto  our  country  today.  The  communists  once  said  that \nthey  would  take  this  country  over  and  never  fire  a \nshot,  and  damn,  if I  don't  believe  that Johnson  is \nhelping  them  do  it. \nTask  Force:  What  should  we  do  about  it? \nVanderbilt:  Well,  it is  kind  of  hard  now,  you \ncan't go  up  there  and  shoot  the  bastard because  you'd \nget  caught  before  you  got  there,  so  what  we're  going \nto  have  to  do  now,  we're  going  to  have  to  beat \nthem  at  the  polls.  We're  going  to  have  to  get out \nhere  and  convince  people  that  they  need  to  clean \nhouse  up  there  in Washington  from  top  to  bottom,  and \nget  some  people  elected  in  there  that has  got  some \nsense,  and  some  white  people  instead of  these  communists. \n113.

As  a \nmatter  of  fact,  it might  come  to  that. \nTask  Force:  Will  you  take  part  in  it ff  it does? \nVanderbilt:  I  keep  my  shotgun  oiled up  at  all  times. \nTask  Force:  So  you're  ready? \nVanderbilt:  I'm dead  ready,  and  I'll tell you \nsomething  else,  we'd  better all oil up  our  shotguns \nand  we'd  better get  us  some  supplies  of  ammunition \non  hand  and  keep  it home  because  the  day  is \ncoming  when  we're  going  to  have  to  get  out  there \nand  fight  like  hell;  and  blood  is  going  toยท run \nlike water  in  the  streets  before  this  thing  is \nover,  and  I'll tell you  one  damn  thing,  for  sure, \nI'm not  giving  this  country  to  the  niggers  or  to \nthe  communists  either without  one  hell  of  a  fight, \nand  if I  run  out of  ammunition,  I'll throw  rocks \nat  them. \n48 \n\nAPPENDIX  III \nHANDLING  FBI  INFORMANTS \nC.  CURRENT  RULES  AND  REGULATIONS \nOn  December  15,  1976,  then  Attorney  General Edward  H. \n1\nLevi  promulgated  instructions  designed  to  govern  the  FBI's \nuse  of  informants  in  domestic  security  and  criminal  cases \n[Levi  Guidelines]. [l]  The  guidelines  recognize  that  informants \nare  a  lawful  and  often  essential  tool  in  law  enforcement \ninvestigatio~s, [2]  but  attempt  to  insure  that  the  government, \nthrough  its informants,  does  not  itself become  a  violator of \nthe  law. [3] \nAgents  are  required  to  instruct  their  informants  that \nin carrying out  their assignments,  they  shall  not: \n1.  participate  in  acts  of  violence;  or \n2.  use  unlawful  techniques  (e.g.,  breaking  and  entering, \nelectronic  surveillance,  opening  or  otherwise \ntampering  with  the  mail)  to  obtain  information \nfor  the  FBI;  or \n3.  initiate a  plan  to  commit  criminal  acts;  or \n4.  participate  in  criminal  activities of  persons  under \ninvestigation,  except  insofar  as  the  FBI  determines \nthat  such  participation  is  necessary  to  obtain \ninformation  needed  for  purposes  of  federal  prosecution. \nWhenever  the  FBI  learns  that  persons  under \ninvestigation  intend  to  commit  a  violent  crime,  in \nformants  used 'in  connection with  the  investigation \nshall  be  instructed  to  try  to  discourage  the \nviolence. [ 4] \n1.  Memorandum  from  the  Attorney  General  to  the  Director,  FBI, \nDec.  15,  1976. \n2.  Id.,  1 .. \n3.  Id. \n4.  Id.,  3. \n49 \n\nThe  FBI  is ordinarily  required  to  notify  appropriate \nlaw  enforcement  or  prosecutive  authorities  upon  learning \nthat  an  informant  has  violated  these  instructions  in  furtherance \nof  nis  assignment[5]  or  has  committed  a  serious  qrime  which \nis  unconnected  with  his  FBI  assignment. [6]  When  the  FBI \nconsiders  such  notification  inadvisable,  it is  required  to \nnotify  the  Department  of  Justice  of  the  facts  and  circumstances \nsurrounding  the  informant's  violation  and  to  recommend  whether \nthe  informant's  services  should  be  continued. [7] \nThe  current  FBI  Manual  of  Instructions  incorporates  the \nabove  instructions[8]  and  highlights  them  elsewhere. [9] \nSection  137-3  of  the  Manual  sets  forth  the  rules  for \ndeveloping  informants.  Before  operating  an  informant,  the \nfield  off ice must  obtain  review  and  approval  from  Headquarters \nby  submitting basic  biographical  information  on  him,  including \nhis  local  arrest  record,  and  past  criminal  activity. [10] \nThe  field  is not  required,  however,  to  certify that  a  prospective \ninformant  is unlikely  to  participate  in violence  or  engage \nin unauthorized  criminal  activity. \n5.
