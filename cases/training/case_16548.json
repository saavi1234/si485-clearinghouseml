    "summary": "<p>This case is part of the Clearinghouse Special Collection on the events and litigation leading up to and surrounding the famous Selma-to-Montgomery marches of 1965.  </p><p>Prior to this suit, three black individuals outside of a county courthouse in Selma, AL were encouraging other eligible black voters to register to vote on July 6, 1964. In response, Sheriff James Clark - famous for his support of segregation and resort to violence in opposing the civil rights movement - ordered the mass arrest of black individuals in the area, including bystanders. Over 50 individuals were arrested and jailed, some of whom were juveniles. None were provided with written charges until a few days later when they were charged with interference with a court in session. The police officer who signed the ex post warrants had no knowledge of the warrants. Later, a majority of the adults were further charged with contributing to the delinquency of a particular minor, even though some of the adults did not even know the child. The Sheriff's office did not investigate the charges, and bonds for most were set above the $300 legal limit.</p><p>The State of Alabama and the City of Selma filed a criminal case against these arrestees in state court. On July 11, 1964, the arrestees removed this case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, where they sought relief arguing that the arrests constituted coercion and intimidation in violation of the Civil Rights Act. The State moved to remand the case back to state court. </p><p>The docket shows that the state moved to transfer the proceedings to the federal court's criminal docket; Judge Thomas granted that motion on April 16, 1965 leading some of the arrestees to appeal. </p><p>We have no further information about the disposition of the case, though the case is now closed. </p>",
