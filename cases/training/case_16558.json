    "summary": "<p>On May 6, 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed this lawsuit against Virginia in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Plaintiff sued pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1997-1997j. The case was assigned to Judge Leonie M. Brinkema. </p><p>The events leading up to this lawsuit began in March 1997, when the DOJ informed the Governor of Virginia that it was commencing an investigation of the Central State Hospital (CSH). CSH is an institution covered by CRIPA and operated by Virginia to provide psychiatric treatment and other services to persons with mental illness. In April 1997, the DOJ conducted on-site inspections and evaluations of CSH. It found that conditions at CSH constituted a pattern of violations of the constitutional and federal statutory rights of patients, specifically the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794.</p><p>In June 1997, the Plaintiff advised Virginia of these findings. Virginia then voluntarily started to develop a written plan to address the care provided at CSH. This plan would later get incorporated into the Settlement Agreement.</p><p>On May 6, 1999, the DOJ filed both the complaint and Settlement Agreement in anticipation of the resolution of this case through the execution of the Agreement. To avoid adversarial litigation, the parties agreed upon a Plan (described in the Agreement) to remedy CSH's deficiencies that the U.S. found. </p><p>The Settlement Agreement included the following important provisions for the Plan, among several other smaller promises:</p><p>- The U.S. shall tour the facility with its expert consultants to assess the status of implementing the Plan. </p><p>- The parties will share information necessary to determine Virginia's compliance with the Agreement. </p><p>- Virginia shall provide the U.S. with quarterly summaries of each open or founded allegation of abuse and/or neglect, as well as other problematic incidents as defined in the Administrative Practice Manual. </p><p>- Virginia shall allow the U.S. to take a certification tour, which is to permit the U.S. to assess the status of Virginia's implementation of the Plan. </p><p>- By no later than July 1, 2000, Virginia shall provide written notice to the United States that it may conduct the certification tour (called the \"Notice Date\"). </p><p>- If the Plaintiff found that Virginia failed to implement the Plan, the Plaintiff may file a motion to vacate the dismissal without prejudice and to restore the Action to the Court's active docket. This motion must be filed within ten months of the Notice Date.</p><p>- If the Plaintiff fails to file a Motion to Restore within this time frame, Virginia shall be conclusively entitled to an order dismissing this case with prejudice. </p><p>Judge Brinkema dismissed the case without prejudice on the same day the Settlement Agreement was filed. However, the case was not fully closed on this date because as explained more fully above, the Agreement stated that the U.S. may restore the case if Virginia failed to implement the Plan. </p><p>By October 4, 2001, the government had not filed a motion to restore. Virginia thus filed a motion to dismiss the case. Judge Brinkema granted the motion and dismissed the case with prejudice. The case closed in 2001. </p>",

      "text": "VIRGINIA CENTRAL STATE HOSPITAL SETTLEMENT \n \n \n \n \n \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nThe United States of America (hereinafter the \"United States\") and the Commonwealth of Virginia (hereinafter \n\"Virginia\") agree to settle the above captioned matter (hereinafter \"this Action\") on the terms and conditions set \nforth below in this Settlement Agreement (hereinafter the \"Agreement\"). I. Introduction. \n1. By letter dated March 24, 1997, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, United States Department \nof Justice, informed the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia that the United States was commencing an \ninvestigation of the Central State Hospital (hereinafter \"CSH\") in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, pursuant to the Civil \nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act (hereinafter \"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq. \n2. CSH is an institution covered by CRIPA and operated by Virginia to provide psychiatric treatment and other \nservices to persons with mental illness. \n3. On April 28 through May 2, 1997, representatives of the United States conducted on-site inspections and \nevaluations of CSH. \n4. As a result of these examinations and inspections, the United States advised the Governor of Virginia, in a letter \ndated June 30, 1997, that, in its opinion, conditions at CSH constituted a pattern or practice of violations of the \nconstitutional and federal statutory rights of CSH patients. \n5. Beginning in June 1997, and continuing from time to time thereafter, Virginia voluntarily developed and \ncommenced implementation of a written plan to address the care provided at CSH (the \"Plan\") (\"Exhibit I\"). \n6. Virginia has at all times denied that conditions at CSH violate the constitutional or federal statutory rights of \npatients at CSH. \n7. Virginia has at all times maintained that, as a matter of state policy, it aspires to provide a level of care to CSH \npatients in excess of what it regards as the minimal level of care required by the Constitution and federal law. By \nentering into this Agreement and agreeing to implement the Plan, Virginia does not admit that any of the terms of \nsuch documents or the level of care it provides are legally required pursuant to the Constitution or federal law. \n8. On May 6, 1999, in anticipation of the execution of this Agreement, the United States filed the Complaint in this \nAction. \n9. The parties agree it is in their mutual interests to avoid adversarial litigation. To that end, the parties have agreed \nupon the Plan and upon methods of communication and conciliation as set forth in this Agreement. The parties \nrecognize that implementation of the Plan provides CSH patients with a level of care satisfying all constitutional and \nfederal statutory standards at issue in this litigation. \n10. The parties agree that the resolution of this case is in the best interests of CSH patients, and otherwise in the best \ninterests of their common citizens. \nAccordingly, the parties agree as follows: \nII. Rule 41(a)(2) Dismissal Without Prejudice. \n\n1. Immediately upon execution of this Agreement, the parties shall jointly move the Court for entry of an Order of \ndismissal without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2), in the form attached as Exhibit II. In the event the Court \nrefuses or fails to enter that Order in the attached form, this Agreement shall be null and void. \nIII. Dismissal With Prejudice. \n1. The Court shall enter a dismissal of this Action with prejudice upon the occurrence of one or more of the \nfollowing conditions: \na. In the event the United States fails to file a Motion to Restore (defined in § VIII below), Virginia shall be \nconclusively entitled to an order dismissing this Action with prejudice exactly ten months from the Notice Date \n(defined in § VII below); \nb. Joint motion of the parties; \nc. Unopposed motion of defendants; or \nd. In the event the United States files a Motion to Restore pursuant to the procedures set forth in § VIII below, but \nthe Court does not find that Virginia failed to achieve substantial compliance with the Plan. \nIV. Plan Implementation. \n1. Virginia agrees to fully implement the Plan by the Notice Date, as defined in § VII(2) below, provided, however, \nVirginia agrees to implement the nurse staffing provisions contained in Section III of the Plan by December 31, \n1999. \nV. Consultation Tour. \n1. To allow the United States an opportunity to observe Virginia's implementation of the Plan, and to promote the \nsharing of technical information and the amicable resolution of any disagreements, the United States shall retain \nexpert consultants to tour CSH to assess the status of such implementation and to confer with CSH with respect to \nsuch implementation. \n2. On dates mutually agreed upon by the parties, but no later than 180 days after entry of the Order described in § II \nabove, the United States shall tour the facility with its expert consultants, after reasonable notice to Virginia of the \nidentity and curriculum vitae of those consultants. One additional tour at a mutually agreeable date shall also be \nconducted prior to the Notice Date, unless both parties agree in writing that such a tour is unnecessary. At least 45 \ndays prior to each tour, the United States shall inform Virginia of the documents its expert consultants will need in \npreparation for the tour. Said documents shall be substantially similar to those previously requested and provided \nduring expert consultant tours of CSH. The United States agrees to provide information to Virginia based on these \ntours within 60 days of the tours. The parties agree to confer regarding the desirability of further sharing of technical \ninformation, including a conference between the United States' expert consultants and Virginia's professionals. \n3. The United States' expert consultants shall tour CSH utilizing the same procedures used during prior United \nStates' expert consultant tours at CSH, including but not limited to procedures governing confidentiality of patient \nrecords. \n4. The United States shall not commence or support any civil action under this Agreement or otherwise, or initiate \nany other CRIPA proceeding against Virginia, based on any matter observed during these tours or documents \nproduced in connection with the tours with the exception that the United States may use such documentation and \ninformation that it obtains or is provided to support a Motion to Restore filed pursuant to § VIII of this Agreement \nthat Virginia has failed to comply with the nurse staffing requirements contained in § III of the Plan by December \n31, 1999, or as provided in § IX of this Agreement. \n\n5. The findings and conclusions of the United States' expert consultants shall not be used by the United States in any \ncourt proceeding nor shall they be disclosed or used by the United States for any purpose other than as set forth in § \nV(4) above, or in § IX of this Agreement. \nVI. Interim Reports. \n1. Beginning on April 30, 1999, and continuing every three months thereafter until the Notice Date defined in § VII \nbelow, Virginia shall provide the United States with quarterly summaries of each reported Category I and II incident \nas defined in the Standard Administrative Practices and Procedures Manual, Chapter 28, Reporting and Responding \nto Unusual Incidents, Appendix B (Exhibit III) occurring at CSH (hereinafter \"Incident Summaries\"), and each open \nor founded allegation of abuse and/or neglect as defined in Departmental Instruction #33 (Exhibit IV) (hereinafter \n\"Abuse/Neglect Summaries\"). The Incident Summaries shall be in the form attached as Exhibit V. The \nAbuse/Neglect Summaries shall be in the form attached as Exhibit VI. CSH will also provide a quarterly progress \nreport outlining the status of its implementation of the Plan, including its efforts to fill nurse staffing positions. \n2. The United States may request reasonable follow-up information, including documents from Virginia, with \nrespect to any incident identified on the Incident and/or Abuse/Neglect Summaries. \n3. The United States shall advise Virginia of any alleged deficiencies in the implementation of the Plan ascertained \nfrom its evaluation of Incident and/or Abuse and Neglect Summaries and follow-up information. Virginia agrees to \nconfer in person or in writing with the United States with respect to any such alleged deficiencies. \nVII. Certification Tour. \n1. The purpose of the certification tour is to permit the United States to assess the status of Virginia's \nimplementation of the Plan before this case is dismissed with prejudice as provided by § III, so that the United States \nmay file a Motion to Restore, if necessary, pursuant to § VIII. \n2. Not later than July 1, 2000, Virginia shall provide written notice to the United States that it may conduct the \ncertification tour. A copy of the notice shall be filed simultaneously with the Clerk of the U.S. District Court in \nAlexandria. If Virginia fails to send this notice on or before July 1, 2000, the United States shall have the right to \nprovide written notice to Virginia that it will conduct the certification tour. A copy of the notice shall be filed \nsimultaneously with the Clerk of the U.S. District Court in Alexandria. The date such notice is filed with the Clerk, \neither by Virginia or the United States, shall be deemed the \"Notice Date\" for purposes of this Agreement. \n3. By August 1, 2000, the United States shall inform Virginia of (i) the identity and vitae of any expert consultants it \nwill retain to assess Virginia's compliance with the Plan, and (ii) the documents it seeks to assess Virginia's \ncompliance with the Plan, which shall be substantially similar to those previously requested and provided during \nexpert consultant tours of CSH. \n4. By September 1, 2000, Virginia shall inform the United States of the identity and vitae of any expert consultants it \nwill retain for the certification tour, and shall provide the United States with the requested documents. \n5. No sooner than September 1, 2000, and no later than October 31, 2000, the United States' attorneys and expert \nconsultants shall tour CSH to assess the status of Virginia's compliance with the Plan. The procedures for such tours \nshall be substantially similar to those previously used during expert consultant tours at CSH (including, but not \nlimited to, procedures governing confidentiality of patient records), except that Virginia shall have the right for its \nown attorneys and expert consultants to accompany those of the United States on all aspects of the tour. \n6. No later than January 1, 2001, Virginia and the United States shall receive from their respective expert consultants \ntheir reports evaluating Virginia's implementation of the Plan. In selecting and retaining their expert consultants, the \nUnited States and Virginia shall each be responsible for assuring that said expert reports can be completed by their \nexpert consultants within this time period. \n\n7. No later than February 1, 2001,the United States shall notify Virginia of any alleged deficiencies in Virginia's \nimplementation of the Plan. The United States shall specify by page numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs, each \nprovision of the Plan which it alleges to have been implemented in a deficient manner. The United States shall set \nforth in reasonable detail (i) the evidentiary basis of its allegations of deficiency, and (ii) the remedial measures \nwhich it proposes to remedy each deficiency. The reasonable details to be provided shall include, but not be limited \nto, a complete statement of all the opinions of any expert consultants on which the United States relies, the basis and \nreasons for such opinions and the information considered by the expert in forming such opinions. The United States \nmay, at its option, satisfy the requirement of reasonable detail by providing a copy of said expert's report and by \nciting to the provisions of the expert's report upon which it relies, if such information, as is specified above, is \ncontained in said expert's report. \n8. No later than March 1, 2001, Virginia shall notify the United States of Virginia's concurrence or disagreement \nwith each of the United States' allegations of deficiency and proposed remedial measures. If Virginia concurs with \nany of the United States' allegations of deficiency, but disagrees with the proposed remedial measure, it shall \npropose an alternative remedial measure. \n9. Between March 1, and April 30, 2001, Virginia and the United States shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any \ndisputes over the United States' allegations of deficiency and/or disputes over the proposed remedial measures. The \nconciliation process shall include at least one face-to-face meeting between representatives of the parties; and if such \nmeeting does not achieve conciliation, then the conciliation process shall continue with a prompt mediation session \nbefore a judicial officer, if feasible under the time frames in this Agreement. During the conciliation process, \nVirginia shall have the right, but shall not be required, to support its position by disclosing relevant portions of its \nexpert reports. \n10. Should Virginia give notice as provided in ¶ 2 of this section prior to July 1, 2000, the dates specified herein \nshall commence on the first day of the first full month following the Notice Date and follow in time intervals similar \nto those indicated in §§ V and VII. \nVIII. Motion to Restore The Action. \n1. In the event Virginia and the United States are unable to resolve any dispute concerning the United States' \nallegations of Virginia's failure to implement the Plan or a provision of the Plan, the United States may file a motion \nto vacate the dismissal without prejudice and to restore the Action to the Court's active docket (\"Motion to Restore\") \nfor the purpose of adjudicating allegations by the United States that Virginia has failed to substantially comply with \nthe Plan. \n2. The United States may not file a Motion to Restore earlier than the ninth month following the Notice Date, except \nwith respect to an allegation that Virginia has failed to implement the nurse staffing provisions contained in Section \nIII of the Plan. By no later than January 31, 2000, Virginia shall provide the United States with documentation, in a \nformat to be mutually agreed upon by the parties, describing the numbers and deployment of nursing staff. The \nUnited States shall provide Virginia with any allegations that CSH has failed to comply with the nurse staffing \nprovisions of the Plan within 15 days of receipt of the documentation. Virginia shall respond to any such allegations \nwithin 15 days of receipt. Within the following 30 days, the parties shall attempt to resolve any disputes involving \nthe alleged nurse staffing deficiencies which shall include at least one face-to-face meeting between representatives \nof the parties, and a mediation session before a judicial officer, if feasible under the timeframes in this Agreement. \nThe alleged deficiencies shall be subject to a Motion to Restore after March 31, 2000. \n3. The Motion to Restore shall (i) identify those portions of the Plan the United States alleges that Virginia has \nviolated, specifying Plan page numbers, paragraphs, and subparagraphs; and (ii) identify with specificity the \nremedial measures sought by the United States. \n4. Any Motion to Restore shall be served upon counsel for Virginia by certified mail, return receipt requested. \n5. Unless a different time is ordered by Order of the Court, Virginia shall have twenty (20) days from the receipt of \nsuch motion to file its response. \n\n6. Upon the filing of the Motion to Restore, the Action shall be litigated in accordance with the applicable Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, Local Rules, and orders of the Court, including, but not limited to, such rules and orders \npertaining to discovery provided, however, that the Complaint shall be deemed amended and superseded in \naccordance with the allegations set forth within the Motion to Restore pursuant to ¶¶ 2 and 3 above. \n7. The United States shall have the burden of proof. To prevail, the United States must show that Virginia failed to \nachieve substantial compliance with the Plan. \n8. The parties shall request the Court to hear such motions and to conduct such trial as may be necessary to \nadjudicate the Motion to Restore the Action, including the allegations set forth pursuant to ¶¶ 2 and 3 above. If the \nCourt finds that Virginia is not in substantial compliance with the Plan, it may order specific performance of those \nportions of the Plan which the Court finds Virginia has violated. \n9. The exclusive remedy for any alleged failure by Virginia to achieve substantial compliance with the Plan shall be \nan Order for specific performance pursuant to ¶ 8 above; provided, however, that this limitation shall not be \nconstrued as an attempt to limit the power of the Court in the event any such order for specific performance is \nentered and thereafter violated. Any such order for specific performance may be directed against such officials \nwhom the Court may determine are responsible for such violations. Neither Virginia nor any officials thereof shall \nbe subject to a finding of, or sanctions for, contempt unless an order for specific performance has been entered \npursuant to a Motion to Restore and is thereafter violated in such a manner as to make such a finding or sanctions \nappropriate. The provisions of this paragraph are of the essence of this Agreement. \n10. If, following a Motion to Restore after the Notice Date, the Court finds that Virginia is in substantial compliance \nwith the Plan, it shall dismiss this Action with prejudice. \nIX. Emergency Provision. \n1. The United States may seek immediate relief from the Court for the limited purpose of redressing an alleged \nemergency at CSH. An emergency shall be defined as apattern or practice of violating the Plan that creates an \nimmediate substantial risk of serious bodily harm to CSH patient(s). \n2. In any motion seeking relief for an alleged emergency, the United States shall file an enhanced pleading which \nsets forth the specific facts on which an emergency is alleged, the specific violations of the Plan, and the legal basis \nfor the allegations (hereinafter \"Motion for Emergency Relief\"). \n3. The parties shall confer in good faith in an effort to resolve any such allegations prior to filing any such Motion \nfor Emergency Relief. \n4. Any Motion for Emergency Relief shall be served upon counsel for Virginia by certified mail, return receipt \nrequested. \n5. Unless a different time is ordered by Order of the Court, Virginia shall have twenty (20) days from the receipt of \nsuch motion to file its response. \n6. Upon the filing of any Motion for Emergency Relief, the motion shall be litigated in accordance with the \napplicable Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Local Rules, and orders of the Court, including but not limited to such \nrules and orders pertaining to discovery. \n7. The United States shall have the burden of proof. To prevail, the United States must prove the existence of an \nemergency as defined in ¶ 1 above. \n8. The parties shall request the Court to hear such motions and to conduct such trials as may be necessary to \nadjudicate the Motion for Emergency Relief, including the allegations required by ¶ 2 above. If the Court finds that \nno emergency exists, it shall dismiss the Motion with prejudice. The dismissal shall have no effect on the United \n\nStates' ability to file a Motion to Restore pursuant to § VIII. If the Court finds that an emergency exists, it may order \nspecific performance of those portions of the Plan which the Court finds gave rise to the emergency. \n9. The exclusive remedy for an alleged emergency shall be specific performance pursuant to ¶ 8 above; provided \nhowever that this limitation shall not be construed as an attempt to limit the power of the Court in the event any such \norder for specific performance is entered and thereafter violated. Any Order for specific performance may be \ndirected against such officials whom the Court may determine are responsible for such emergencies. Neither \nVirginia nor any officials thereof shall be subject to a finding of, or sanctions for, contempt unless an order for \nspecific performance has been entered pursuant to a Motion for Emergency Relief and is thereafter violated in such \na manner as to make such findings or sanctions appropriate. \nX. Interpretation of the Plan. \n1. The parties recognize that implementation of the Plan must be evaluated and interpreted in light of standards not \nexpressly set forth in the Plan. In such cases, for purposes of determining whether CSH has implemented the Plan, \nor any portion thereof, the parties agree that the relevant and applicable standard shall be as follows: Decisions by \nVirginia with respect to the implementation of policies, procedures, and other activities required by the Plan shall be \nevaluated for the purposes of determining compliance with the Plan by the \"professional judgment\" standard \narticulated in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982). \n2. This Agreement, together with attachments, is an integrated document and contains the entire agreement between \nthe parties, and wholly cancels, terminates, and supersedes any and all previous and/or contemporaneous oral \nagreements, negotiations, and commitments and writings between the parties thereto with respect to this Action and \nCSH. \n3. Except as provided in ¶ 7 below, no change, modification, extension, termination, discharge, abandonment or \nwaiver of this Agreement or any of the provisions hereof, nor any representation, promise or condition relating to \nthis Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto unless made in writing and signed by the parties or their \ncounsel. \n4. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in the Plan shall be construed as an admission or evidence (i) that the \npractices at CSH have at anytime or in any way violated constitutional standards or other legal standards governing \nthe provision of care at CSH, (ii) that the terms of the Agreement or the Plan are necessary to meet constitutional \nstandards or other legal standards governing the provision of care at CSH, or (iii) that the policies, practices, and \nprocedures described in the Plan did not exist at CSH prior to the initiation of the CRIPA investigation; nor shall this \nAgreement or the Plan be used by any person or party as the basis for any liability of Virginia except as expressly \nprovided herein with respect to this Action. \n5. Each of the terms of the Agreement and the Plan shall be deemed to have been mutually drafted by the parties, \nand shall not be construed against either party as the author thereof. \n6. Deadlines and time references (e.g., use of present and past tense) used in the Plan shall reflect CSH's schedule \nfor implementation as of the original and/or revised date of the Plan. They may be used for purposes of consultation \nbetween the United States and Virginia, pursuant to the Consultation Tour provided by Section V. Notwithstanding \nsuch deadlines and time references, CSH shall be deemed to have implemented this Plan for all purposes under the \nAgreement if it has been implemented by the Notice Date, except that the nurse staff provisions contained in Section \nIII of the Plan shall be subject to a Motion to Restore if not implemented by December 31, 1999. \n7. Virginia shall have the right to propose modifications to the Plan from time to time by giving the United States \nwritten notice of the language proposed for deletion from and/or addition to the Plan. Such proposed modifications \nshall be deemed effective for all purposes under this Agreement on the date specified in the proposal unless the \nUnited States gives Virginia written notice of its objection within 30 days of its receipt of the proposed modification. \n8. Virginia shall not be deemed to have failed to achieve substantial compliance with the Plan due to any shortage of \nstaff where such shortage is the result of an unusual level of absences beyond Virginia's reasonable control, or \n\nvacancies created by the death, discharge, retirement, or resignation of any employee or by the creation of new \npositions in response to an increase in census, so long as Virginia takes necessary steps to fill such vacancies with \nreasonable promptness. \n9. In the event the United States hereafter files any motion or commences any action or proceeding, alleging that \nVirginia has failed to meet any obligations to which it may be lawfully subject under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), neither the position of the United States nor the position of Virginia shall be in \nany way prejudiced by the provisions of the Plan found under Part V thereof (\"Discharge Planning and Community \nPlacement\"). Said provisions shall in no way limit either party with respect to the ADA, including but not limited to \narguments regarding constitutional, statutory and/or regulatory interpretation and authority. \nXI. Miscellaneous. \n1. The parties shall request that the Motion to Restore and any other proceeding held in this case be heard by the \nHonorable Leonie M. Brinkema, United States District Court Judge. Any party may file a motion to vacate the \ndismissal without prejudice and to restore the case to the active docket for the limited purpose of adjudicating an \nalleged violation of § V, VI, or VII of this Agreement. Any such motion shall be adjudicated pursuant to the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure and the local rules of this Court. Any such motion shall state the paragraphs of the \nAgreement that are alleged to be violated. The exclusive remedy for any such violation shall be an order for specific \nperformance. Any such order for specific performance shall be directed against such officials whom the Court may \ndetermine are responsible for such violations. No party nor any official thereof shall be subject to a finding of, or \nsanctions for, contempt unless such an order for specific performance has been hereafter entered and is thereafter \nviolated in such a manner as to make such finding or sanctions appropriate. The parties shall attempt in good faith to \nresolve any dispute prior to filing any motion alleging a violation of this Agreement. \n2. This Agreement shall be applicable to and binding on the parties to this Agreement, their officers, agents, \nemployees, and successors. \n3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the United States shall have no standing to seek, nor shall \nit be entitled to entry of, any order for specific performance that would, as a practical matter, require the expenditure \nof funds in any biennium in excess of (i) the level of funding appropriated for the facility by the General Assembly \nin the 1998-2000 biennium, plus (ii) such additional funding, if any, as may be needed to fund staff positions \nrequired by the Plan but not currently filled. Virginia represents its good faith belief that the level of funding \nappropriated for the 1998-2000 biennium, together with such additional funds as are available to the Governor for \nfunding such staff positions in said biennium, is sufficient to implement the Plan. \n4. This Agreement and the Rule 41(a)(2) Dismissal referenced in this Agreement resolve all of the allegations raised \nin the Complaint. Accordingly, the United States shall not amend its Complaint (except as provided in § VIII ¶¶ 1, 2, \nand 6, above) nor file any new CRIPA action based on events at CSH occurring prior to entry of any dismissal with \nprejudice of this Action. \n5. Each party shall bear its own costs, including attorney's fees, except that Virginia may move for attorney's fees \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1997a(c) at the conclusion of any proceeding brought by the United States pursuant to §§ \nVIII and IX herein. \n6. An executed copy of this Agreement shall be filed with the Clerk of Court, and a copy delivered to the United \nStates District Judge assigned to this Action. \n7. The following shall govern the termination of Virginia's obligation under the Agreement and the Plan: \n(a) subject to the provisions of subparagraph (b), Virginia's obligation with respect to the Agreement and the Plan \nshall terminate ten months from the Notice Date or with the entry of a Dismissal with Prejudice, whichever is \nearlier. \n\n(b) With respect to any provisions of the Plan which are the subject of a Motion to Restore under § VIII, the \nobligations of such provisions shall continue pending an adjudication of such Motion to Restore. \n(c) With respect to any provisions of the Plan for which the Court has entered an order for specific performance, the \nparties agree to jointly move the Court to dismiss such orders and to dismiss the case with prejudice within one year \nfrom the date such order for specific performance was entered, unless and to the extent that the United States has \nmoved for a finding of civil contempt with respect to such order within said one year period. \n(d) If the United States moves for a finding of civil contempt, but the Court finds no such contempt, Virginia's \nobligations under the Agreement and Plan shall terminate as of that time with respect to the provision(s) that was the \nsubject of said motion for contempt. \n(e) If a finding of civil contempt has been made, the obligations under the provisions of the Plan with respect to \nwhich such finding has been made shall be extended for such period as may be required by the Court as a remedy \nfor such contempt. \n8. The parties recognize that the community services boards (\"CSBs\") and local behavioral health authorities \nreferenced in the Plan are agencies of local government rather than state government. Nothing in the Agreement nor \nthe Plan shall be construed to impose any obligation on CSBs or such authorities, nor to impose any obligation on \nVirginia with respect to funding or directing the activities of CSBs and/or such authorities beyond what may be \nrequired by state law. \n9. This Settlement Agreement is signed on behalf of the United States by Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney \nGeneral and other counsel of record for the United States, and on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia by \nWilliam H. Hurd, Senior Counsel to the Attorney General, and other counsel of record for the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. Each of said counsel represents that she or he has and/or has obtained all authority necessary to sign on \nbehalf of the United States and the Commonwealth of Virginia, respectively. Counsel for the Commonwealth further \nrepresent that they execute this Settlement Agreement on behalf of the Commonwealth with the authorization \nconsent and/or approval of the other Defendants in this case, to-wit: Governor James S. Gilmore III, Secretary \nClaude A. Allen, Commissioner Richard E. Kellogg, and James S. Reinhard, M.D., Acting Director of Central State \nHospital. \nThis Settlement Agreement between the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia \nregarding the Central State Hospital is signed on behalf of the United States of America by the following: \n______________________________ \nBy: Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division \n______________________________ \nBy: Steven H.

      "title": "Central State Hospital Findings Letter",
      "text": "CENTRAL STATE HOSPITAL FINDINGS LETTER \nJune 30, 1997 \nThe Honorable George Allen  \nGovernor of Virginia  \nRichmond, VA 23212 \nRe: CRIPA Investigation of Central State Hospital \nDear Governor Allen: \nOn March 24, 1997, we notified you that we were conducting an investigation, pursuant to the Civil Rights of \nInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 etseq., of Central State Hospital (\"Central State\"), a \npsychiatric hospital near Petersburg, Virginia. Prior to initiating this investigation, former Virginia Attorney General \nJames Gilmore called Attorney General Janet Reno to pledge the Commonwealth's full cooperation in any \nDepartmental investigation of the conditions. Special Litigation Section Chief Steven Rosenbaum and his staff \nsubsequently met with Virginia Deputy Attorney General William Hurd and his staff to discuss the Department's \nplans for investigating Central State and the Commonwealth's plans for improving conditions at the facility. I am \nwriting now to report our findings with regard to this investigation.  \n  \nCentral State is a 495-bed psychiatric state hospital that was originally established in 1870 as a separate institution \nfor African-Americans who had mental health disorders. Today, the hospital provides psychiatric services to all \npersons. It serves adolescents and adult civil patients from a defined geographic area surrounding the Petersburg \narea. In addition, Central State houses the only secure forensic hospital unit in Virginia. The hospital has six \nbuildings that contain 20 patient wards. The patient population is broken down as follows: the forensic unit (7 \nwards) is comprised of 176 patients; the adolescent unit (2 wards) houses 19 patients and the adult civil unit (11 \nwards) has approximately 270 patients.  \n  \nWe conducted the investigation by touring the facility with expert consultants in psychiatry and psychiatric nursing \nbetween April 28 through May 2, 1997. During the course of this investigation, these experts made observations, \ninterviewed staff and patients, and examined numerous patient and facility records, including incident and restraint \nstatistics and summaries, committee minutes, morbidity/mortality reviews, and facility policies and procedures. At \nthe conclusion of these tours, both experts provided Central State Hospital staff and Commonwealth officials with a \nsummary of their major findings.  \n  \nOn May 29, 1997, we met with Deputy Attorney General Hurd and his staff in Fredericksburg, Virginia to discuss \nthe status of our investigation of Central State and matters related to our CRIPA activities in other institutions in \nVirginia. We subsequently reached agreement with Commonwealth officials on a process, with time frames, for \nresolving our Central State investigation. As part of that process, the Commonwealth has agreed to take some \nimmediate steps to address serious deficiencies at Central State and to develop and implement additional plans for \nremedial action, based upon the findings and recommendations in this letter.  \n  \nBefore addressing the substantive violations, we would like to express our appreciation to the staff of the \nDepartment of Mental Health, Central State, and the Attorney General's office for their assistance and cooperation \nduring our investigation of Central State. We expect to continue to work with these officials in the same cooperative \nmanner to remedy the problems at the facility.  \n  \nIn investigating Central State Hospital, our purpose was to evaluate whether patients were being afforded their \nconstitutional and federal statutory rights. Patients in state-operated mental health facilities have a Fourteenth \nAmendment due process right to adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, reasonably safe conditions and \n\nadequate mental health treatment. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982); O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. \n563 (1975). In addition, the Commonwealth must provide public services to individuals with disabilities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs. See, e.g., Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12132 et seq., 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ \n794 et seq. and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.  \n  \nDuring our investigation, we found numerous conditions that lead us to conclude that constitutional and federal \nstatutory rights of Central State patients are being violated. As detailed below, a major cause of many of these \ndeficiencies is that Central State has an insufficient number of adequately trained professional and direct care staff to \nmeet the needs of patients. The facts that support our findings of unlawful and unconstitutional conditions at Central \nState Hospital are set forth below, followed by the remedial actions that we believe are necessary to remedy these \nconditions. \nI. Central State Is Failing To Ensure The Reasonable Safety Of Its Patients  \n  \nA. Inadequate Protection From Injuries, Dangerous Behaviors, and Abuse  \n  \nThe facility's incident reports and special abuse investigations reveal a high level of injuries and dangerous \nsituations that place patients at risk of harm. Patients are injured repeatedly due to self-injurious behavior and \naggressive acts of other patients. Many of these incidents are preventable and reflect systemic deficiencies at Central \nState including lack of adequate staffing, failure to supervise patients, and inadequate assessment and treatment of \nmental illness, particularly patients with behavioral problems.  \n  \nCentral State does not provide needed treatment to abate or eliminate these behaviors. For example, in the period \njust prior to our tour, one patient engaged in almost daily incidents of self-injurious behavior, including banging his \nhead on the wall, hitting his face with his fist, punching a wall, and assaulting others on a regular basis. Our experts \nconcluded that this patient did not have an appropriate treatment plan to address his serious behavior problems. \nAnother patient with numerous incidents of self-injurious behavior was characterized by staff as \"merely seeking \nattention,\" resulting in her behaviors largely being ignored, rather than treated.  \n  \nThe lack of supervision is prevalent throughout the hospital. It is not uncommon, for example, for nearly half the \nacute admissions ward, approximately 76 patients, to be on \"high risk status\" necessitating staff observation at least \nevery fifteen minutes. In order to be placed on this status, a physician must determine that the patient poses a special \nrisk because the patient is suicidal or homicidal, presents an elopement or arson risk, or requires special precautions. \nDespite the potential for serious harm posed by each of these conditions, Central State does not provide adequate \nstaffing to carry out the physicians' orders for enhanced supervision. As a result, Central State patients fail to receive \nthe professional judgments by qualified professionals that is necessary to their care.  \n  \nIn addition to inadequate supervision on the acute admissions ward, our experts found the lack of supervision and \npotential for harm particularly significant on the Forensic Unit, which houses the most aggressive, assaultive and \nself-injurious patients. Incident reports document numerous injuries to these high-risk patients as a result of not \nbeing monitored adequately.  \n  \nCentral State also fails to take adequate steps to assess, supervise and treat patients who are at risk of suicide. \nCentral State has abandoned the use of a formalized suicide assessment for incoming patients. Instead, the standard \ncurrently used by Central State to determine whether a patient will be closely monitored by staff rests solely on a \nverbalization of immediate suicide plans at the time of admission. Without a formalized suicide assessment, \nphysicians are unable to determine which patients are at risk and the level of staff supervision that is necessary to \n\nensure a patient's safety. Our experts found that the standard for assessing suicide risk at Central State departs \nsubstantially from accepted professional standards.  \n  \nThe failure to assess and supervise patients at risk of suicide has dire consequences for Central State patients. For \nexample, last year one patient was admitted with a history of suicide ideations, verbalizations and gestures while \nconfined to a jail. On admission, the patient denied immediate plans to commit suicide and was not placed on any \ntype of increased supervision. The patient eventually hanged himself. Staff found another patient, who had \nthreatened to harm herself, gouging her abdomen and shouting that she must pay for what she had done --but the \npatient was not placed on increased supervision. She was found three days later underneath her bed, nude, with a bra \nwrapped around her neck in an effort to strangle herself. A review of incidents from January 1996 to April 1997 \nreveal numerous suicide attempts, including repeated attempts by patients who were not supervised properly. \nOther types of preventable incidents that occur routinely throughout the facility demonstrate a systemic failure to \nprotect patients from harm. Staff also frequently fail to report injuries. For example, in one case, a patient was \ndiscovered last year to have 42 bruises, ranging in size from one to two inches, over his upper torso. He sustained \nthese injuries despite the fact that he was under supposedly 24-hour surveillance by Central State staff. Although the \nfacility suspected that the bruises occurred during a two-week period of time, during which there were multiple \nopportunities for staff to observe the bruises, none of the bruises were reported until the end of the two-week \nperiod.  \n  \nCentral State also does not have an adequate procedure for investigating untoward events, abuse allegations and \ndeaths. We reviewed numerous incident reports involving injuries where the medical staff conducted little or no \nfollow-up to determine the cause of the incident, its effect on the patient, or how similar incidents might be avoided \nin the future. In addition, Central State staff disclosed that follow-up is generally limited to reviewing the initial \nincident report and quantifying the number of incidents rather than identifying the reason for the incident and how to \nprevent it in the future. Central State also fails to investigate allegations of abuse in a comprehensive and timely \nmanner. Many of the allegations of abuse cannot be substantiated because the quality of the evidence is so poor or \noutdated. Finally, the facility fails to conduct routine mortality reviews. Given the problems with the health care \ndelivery system at Central State, detailed below, the failure to conduct routine, independent mortality reviews is a \nserious deficiency because such reviews may reveal issues that require remedial attention.  \n  \nThese facts demonstrate that Central State residents are at serious risk of harm and have suffered harm, in violation \nof their basic rights, due to the facility's failure to provide adequate staffing, supervision and treatment.  \n  \nB. Unsafe and Inadequate Physical Conditions  \n  \nThe physical plant of the Forensic Unit is dangerous and compromises the welfare and safety of patients residing \nthere. The Unit has too many patients, too little space and numerous blind spots. Moreover, temperature control and \nventilation problems pose a health risk to patients who receive psychotropic medications that impair their ability to \nregulate internal body temperature. In addition, the nurses' station does not have adequate sight lines to allow \nadequate supervision of patients. Such poor environmental and physical conditions subject Central State patients, as \nwell as staff, to serious risks to their personal safety and well being.  \n  \nII. Central State Is Failing To Provide Adequate Mental Health Care For Its Patients  \n  \nCentral State is not providing its patients with adequate psychiatric and mental health services in accordance with \ngenerally accepted standards. Psychiatric practices at Central State are typically characterized by superficial \nevaluations, inadequate follow-ups, a lack of cogent treatment planning, a lack of multi-disciplinary input into \n\npsychiatric treatment decisions, and an over-reliance on restrictive interventions. Moreover, the psychiatric and \nmental health services at Central State fail to provide patients with a reasonable opportunity to be cured or function \nas independently as their psychiatric conditions permit.  \n  \nA. Inadequate Psychiatric and Mental Health Services  \n  \nCentral State frequently fails to diagnose patients' mental illness appropriately. An adequate diagnosis is essential to \ndevelop appropriate treatment. Inadequate diagnoses have led to improper treatment that has harmed patients, either \nby subjecting them to needless or improper medications and their attendant side-effects, or by failing to treat the \nunderlying mental illness, thereby exposing the patient to negative behaviors that are not controlled properly.  \n  \nPatient treatment is not multi-disciplinary, individualized or properly managed, in accordance with accepted \nprofessional standards. Review of patient records and interviews with Central State staff reveal little or no evidence \nof multi-disciplinary participation in treatment planning. Records demonstrate that staff are providing treatment \nwithout an adequate understanding of the patient's problems. Treatment goals are vague and fail to provide an \nobjective, measurable basis for evaluating patient progress.  \n  \nTreatment is also not adequately coordinated between disciplines. In particular, master treatment and nursing care \nplans are inconsistent. Additionally, nursing care plans suffer similar defects to treatment plans. For instance, initial \nnursing care plans are not individualized. Patients are placed in categories, and then all patients in the same category \nreceive the same nursing care plan without regard to their individual needs.  \n  \nBehavioral management planning and psychological services are also inadequate. Of the records reviewed, we found \nnumerous patients with recurrent self-injurious behavior who were not receiving appropriate behavioral \nmanagement. This is particularly true of the Forensic Unit. The failure to provide adequate behavioral management \nhas led to patients receiving little therapeutic care, treatment and programming. To the extent that behavior \nprogramming does exist, its negative nature predominates. The emphasis is primarily on containment, rather than \nteaching alternative, adaptive behaviors.  \n  \nCentral State's Forensic Unit houses several patients who are dually diagnosed as being both mentally ill and \nmentally retarded. Staff admit that they are not trained to address the needs of this patient population and that the \nfacility offers no specialized programming. Central State also fails to provide adequate treatment for the 22 percent \nof the patient population who are dually diagnosed as having a substance abuse problem in addition to being \nmentally ill.  \n  \nB. Inadequate Discharge Planning and Community Services \nOur consultants found that Central State's discharge planning is inadequate and violates professional standards. \nCentral State fails to ensure that professional judgments about the most integrated setting appropriate to meet each \npatient's needs are made and implemented with due regard to the commitment status of the patient. Patient charts \nlack adequate discharge criteria. This inhibits the exercise of professional judgment about readiness for discharge. \nOur experts found Central State's discharge system to be arbitrary, with some patients released too soon while others \nare hospitalized for too long.  \n  \nDischarge planning is given low priority at Central State. Discharge plans are often developed only shortly before a \npatient is about to be released, rather than being incorporated into treatment objectives in accordance with accepted \nprofessional standards. Consequently, patients are often discharged without a clear plan and adequate services to \n\naddress basic living needs. For example, one patient was discharged on a temporary leave to a group home, without \nneeded supervision, and was found shortly thereafter in a creek near the facility where he apparently drowned. \nFinally, the failure of Central State to provide adequate discharge planning for those patients who are dually \ndiagnosed as having a substance abuse problem in addition to being mentally ill, results in frequent re-admissions \nafter these patients are discharged to the community.  \n  \nThe Commonwealth is not providing integrated hospital and community services in order to ensure adequate patient \ntransition into the community. Because community treatment services are inadequate, persons who otherwise could \nlive in community settings end up being re-hospitalized.  \n  \nIII. Inappropriate Use of Restraints and Seclusion.  \n  \nRestraint and seclusion practices depart substantially from accepted professional standards. Despite recent \nimprovements in hospital policy, Central State employs an excessive amount of seclusion and restraint for \ninappropriately long periods of time, contrary to accepted professional practice. For example, incident reports reveal \nthat staff placed patients in restraints for extended periods of time simply because they did not follow ward rules \n(e.g., left the ward without permission). In one case, a patient was placed in restraints because he talked back to the \nstaff. Staff appear frequently to make ad hoc decisions about whether to place a patient in restraints, often without \nappropriate precipitating factors.  \n  \nCentral State's inappropriate use of restraints and seclusion as punishment has had tragic consequences. Last year, a \npatient died after staff secured her to a bed by her arms, legs and waist in five-point restraints and then left her \nunattended in a locked seclusion room. Almost a year before her death, her Central State psychiatrist had warned \nCentral State officials that she should not be left unattended in restraints because the patient faced potentially life-\nthreatening consequences from her asthma and epileptic seizures. The psychiatrist in a memorandum titled \"Duty to \nWarn,\" urged staff members to avoid strapping down the patient as punishment. The memorandum also noted that \nCentral State staff continually ignored the patient as she lay unconscious during potential fatal epileptic seizures. \nAppealing for more humane treatment of his patient, the psychiatrist warned that the seizures could be fatal to the \npatient because thick nasal mucus could drain into her mouth and obstruct breathing. At the time of her death, her \nbehavior program provided that she be placed in restraints for 48 hours to be renewed for an additional eight hour \nperiods if inappropriate behavior continued. Staff were instructed to not \"engage in small talk\" and to ignore her \nprotests. The patient had spent over 300 hours of the last two months of her life in restraints. Our experts concluded \nthat the facility's care and treatment of this patient was clearly inappropriate. The year before, another patient died \nwhile in restraints and locked alone in a secluded room. \nNumerous other patients were documented as being restrained almost on a daily basis. According to Central State's \nmonthly reports on \"Extensive Use of Seclusion/Restraint,\" one patient was secluded/restrained for 1,727 hours over \nan eight month period. Another patient was reported as having been secluded/restrained for 720 hours over a four-\nmonth period. In the first three months of 1997, a third patient is reported as being secluded or restrained for 668 \nhours. Our experts concluded that these and other examples demonstrated an excessive use of restraint and seclusion \n-- a problem that Central State staff have acknowledged. Following an internal staffing and patient abuse report, the \nMedical Director announced on February 25, 1997, that seclusion and restraint would only be used as an emergency \nintervention and would no longer be used as program interventions in behavior treatment plans.  \n  \nNonetheless, the inappropriate and excessive use of restraints and seclusion for patients still remains a problem at \nCentral State. While overall usage is down, our review of restraint and seclusion data since the enactment of the new \npolicy still indicates the extensive use of seclusion and restraint for many patients, particularly those with behavioral \nproblems. For example, on the Forensic Unit, one patient, in the one-month period just prior to our tour, had been \nsubjected to 33 orders of seclusion/restraint for a total of 233 hours, an average of seven hours each time. Another \npatient had 49 orders of seclusion/restraint for a total of 396 hours, an average of eight hours each time. Moreover, \n\nAdolescent Unit physicians continue to use the most restrictive intervention of restraint as the first choice of \nbehavioral treatment.  \n  \nOur expert consultants found that the continuing problems in restraint and seclusion are related to the facility's \ngenerally inadequate treatment process. The low staffing level at Central State also contributes to the excessive use \nof restraint and seclusion as the staff are unable to spend sufficient time with agitated patients to prevent aggression \nor to implement programs necessary to afford patient safety. Patients at Central State are often kept in restraints and \nseclusion without any objective, recorded criteria for their release or explanation of the problem behavior that is \nbeing addressed by the use of restraints. Staff lack an understanding of less restrictive measures that could be \nutilized where appropriate. Patients, therefore, often remain in restraints long past the point when professionals \nagree that release should occur. Monitoring of patients while in seclusion or restraint is deficient at Central State as \ndemonstrated in the incidents during the past several years where patients have died. A recent incident where a \npatient set fire to the bed after staff restrained him and left him unattended in seclusion highlights this deficiency. In \nsum, Central State's restraint and seclusion practices require immediate correction.  \n  \nIV. Inadequate medical care and medication practices.  \n  \nCentral State's psychopharmacological practices substantially depart from generally accepted medical judgment. \nLittle or no effort is expended to conduct the detailed review of a patient's medication history necessary to avoid the \nrisk of placing patients on medications that have produced adverse side-effects in the past or that have proven \nineffective. \nThe medication practices throughout Central State vary substantially and appear to be based on decisions by \nindividual physicians who are not properly supervised. Physicians are underutilizing standard technologies and \nmedications. The problem is exacerbated by confusing and sometimes contradictory memoranda defining \nmedication practices. Physicians fail to justify the medications chosen for treatment or changes made in treatment. \nMedications are either not changed at all or changed so frequently that it is difficult if not impossible to ascertain the \nefficacy of the medication. Our experts found medications being prescribed at sub-therapeutic levels. The result is \nthat medications are not working, patients are acting out more, and staff rely on restraints as a means of patient \ncontrol.  \n  \nWe further found inappropriate and excessive use of medications on a pro re nata (\"PRN\"), or \"as needed\" basis. \nThis practice gives discretion to unqualified staff to determine when medications should be given to a patient. \nMoreover, nurses fail to document the effect of PRN medications in violation of standard nursing practices.  \n  \nComprehensive assessments of patients' health care needs and evaluation of the efficacy of treatment interventions \nare a critical component of adequate health care. Central State physicians, however, are not routinely performing \nadequate assessments. Nor does the staff act in an interdisciplinary way to identify, plan for, and treat the specific \nneeds of patients. This lack of interdisciplinary communication is a basic failing that negatively affects practically \nevery aspect of patient care at Central State.  \n  \nEmergency medical care at Central State is also inadequate. Our nursing expert concluded that inadequate medical \nemergency response was a contributing factor to two deaths at Central State that occurred during the past year. In \none instance, there was a delay in initiating cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In another instance, there was a delay in \nproviding emergency medical equipment. One of the deaths occurred on the weekend in the Forensic Unit, where \nthere is only one registered nurse on duty for an entire building of 176 patients.  \n  \n\nCentral State staff and administrators admit that nursing care is particularly understaffed. The nursing shortages \nhave resulted in a lack of monitoring, review and coordination of medical services. Our nursing consultant found \nthat to make up for the lack of nurses, Central State has had to use an excessive rate of overtime since the beginning \nof the calendar year. To continue the use of overtime at the same rate for the entire year would result in the \nequivalent of hiring 53 additional full-time nurses. This excessive use of overtime in a mental health facility is \ndangerous and does not comport with accepted professional standards.  \n  \nInadequate and incomplete record keeping practices deprive Central State staff of information necessary to make \nprofessional decisions concerning patient care and treatment. Patient charts lack sufficient medical histories of \npatients to allow professional judgments to be made regarding treatment. Diagnostic evaluations lack appropriate \ndocumentation and justification. Our consultants found that staff did not record patient response to prescribed \ntreatment and medication. Records regarding the detection, evaluation and management of drug side effects were \nabsent from patient charts. Nor do the records reflect explanations for changes in treatment or follow-up procedures \npertaining to recognized medical conditions. In sum, Central State records lack relevant clinical information \nnecessary for staff to make professional decisions. \nMINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES  \n  \nI. Protection From Harm  \n  \n1. Central State must provide a safe environment for its patients. Staff members should adequately monitor and \nsafeguard the patients, especially those with histories of exhibiting behaviors that cause injuries to themselves or \nothers. Patients also must be protected from being victimized by other aggressive patients.  \n  \n2. Central State should employ sufficient trained, independent investigators to ensure that all incidents of abuse, \nserious injury or unexpected death are adequately investigated.  \n  \n3. Central State should develop and implement adequate suicide prevention measures, including initial assessment \nprotocols and a sufficient number of qualified staff to adequately supervise suicidal patients.  \n  \n4. The physical plant of the Forensic Unit needs to be modified to ensure the safety and well being of Central State \npatients and staff.  \n  \n5. Central State should hire and deploy a sufficient number of qualified direct care and professional staff necessary \nto provide patients with adequate supervision and medical and psychiatric treatment.  \n  \n6. Physician orders for enhanced supervision must be communicated to appropriate staff and implemented.  \n  \nII. Mental Health Care  \n  \n1. Central State must evaluate, diagnose, treat, and discharge patients consistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards. Individualized psychological assessments should be performed promptly in accordance with \nprofessional standards. In particular, such assessments should be conducted for patients who repeatedly engage in \nproblem behaviors.  \n  \n\n2. The treatment process should be reformed. Patient treatment must be appropriate, individualized, coordinated, and \nproperly managed. Such programs should give each patient a reasonable opportunity to be cured and function as \nindependently and effectively as possible given his or her individual condition. To that end, treatment planning \nshould reflect multi-disciplinary thinking. Patients should have appropriate input in the treatment process. Treatment \nshould be based on objective data and clearly established goals. Staff should be trained to write professionally \nappropriate behavioral goals and objectives. Data collected by staff for treatment decisions should be adequately \nincorporated into the treatment planning process. Master treatment and nursing care plans need to be consistent and \nadequately organized for staff review.  \n  \n3. Central State needs to provide adequate treatment for patients with specialized needs. If mentally retarded patients \ncontinue to be housed at Central State, they must be provided with adequate individualized treatment and training. \nPatients with a dual diagnosis of substance abuse should be provided adequate treatment for that problem.  \n  \n4. Qualified professionals at Central State must evaluate patients to determine the most integrated setting appropriate \nto meet their needs. Discharge criteria need to be adequately developed and discharge planning should be a \nconsideration long before a patient is about to be discharged. Central State must develop and implement adequate \ndischarge plans that identify the necessary aftercare services to meet the needs of patients upon discharge. The \nCommonwealth should develop a quality assurance/improvement system to oversee the discharge process. This \nsystem should ensure that patient discharge plans are implemented and that appropriate aftercare services are \nprovided that meet the needs of the patient in the community. Individualized, professionally justified placement \ndecisions should consider a patient's needs.  \n  \nIII. Seclusion and Restraint  \n  \n1. Seclusion and restraint policies must comport with professional standards and must be conducted in a safe and \nappropriate manner. The practice of using seclusion for the convenience of staff, or in lieu of treatment, must cease \nimmediately. The decision to seclude and/or restrain a patient should only be employed pursuant to the exercise of \nprofessional judgment by a qualified professional (i.e., psychiatrist, medical doctor, psychologist, or registered \nnurse). Patients in seclusion and/or restraint should be adequately and appropriately monitored. Use of seclusion and \nrestraints should be properly documented and reviewed in a timely fashion by qualified staff. Criteria for release \nfrom seclusion and restraints should be clearly identified, and use of seclusion and restraints as part of any treatment \nprocess should be professionally appropriate and regularly reviewed.  \n  \nIV. Medical Care and Medication Practices  \n  \n1. Central State's psychopharmacological practices must comport with generally accepted professional standards. \nPatients should receive prompt professional evaluation of medical problems. All use of drugs should be \nprofessionally justified, carefully monitored, documented, and reviewed by qualified staff. \n2. Central State must provide adequate and appropriate psychiatric and mental health services in accordance with \naccepted professional standards.  \n  \n3. Central State must ensure that its patients receive adequate medical, including emergency, care in accordance with \ngenerally accepted standards of care. Central State should ensure adequate and appropriate interdisciplinary \ncommunication among relevant professionals, and Central State physicians should write appropriate, complete and \nclear orders pursuant to professionally accepted standards.  \n  \n\n4. Central State should develop and implement an adequate quality assurance process in accordance with \nprofessionally accepted standards.  \n  \n \n \n  \n \nPursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, the Attorney General may initiate a lawsuit to correct \ndeficiencies at an institution forty-nine days after appropriate officials are notified of them. 42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(1). \nWe know that Virginia is already engaged in efforts to improve conditions at Central State and look forward to \nreceiving the initial plan of correction based upon these efforts. As we have agreed, we will give the Commonwealth \nan opportunity to respond to this findings letter in accordance with the time frames agreed to in the correspondence \nbetween Special Litigation Section Chief Steven Rosenbaum and Virginia Deputy Attorney General William H. \nHurd.  \n  \nAgain, we want to thank you for your cooperation. We will continue to work with you and other Commonwealth \nofficials to resolve the serious deficiencies we have identified.  \n  \nSincerely,  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  \nIsabelle Katz Pinzler  \nActing Assistant Attorney General  \nCivil Rights Division \ncc: The Honorable Richard Cullen  \nAttorney General  \nCommonwealth of Virginia \nMr. Robert Metcalf  \nSecretary  \nDepartment of Mental Health and  \nHuman Resources \nMr. Timothy Kelly  \nCommissioner  \nDepartment of Mental Health \nMr. James C.
