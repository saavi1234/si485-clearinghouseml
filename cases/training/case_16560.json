    "summary": "<p>This suit, filed on April 9, 2018, challenged a report created and issued by defendants the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Executive Order 13780: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States required this report, known as the Initial Section 11 Report. Muslim Advocates—a nonprofit organization—filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, arguing that the report was biased and misleading against Muslims and the threat they pose to the United States. The plaintiff claimed this further stigmatized Muslims in the US while stoking anti-Muslim sentiments and filed the complaint under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for violations of the Information Quality Act (IQA). Specifically, the plaintiff sought a retraction and correction of the report to bring it in compliance with the IQA. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. </p><p>The IQA and its implementing guidelines required that when federal agencies publish information to the public, the information meet threshold levels of quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity. Executive Order 13780 (\"the EO\"), which President Trump signed on March 6, 2017, significantly restricted individuals from six Muslim-majority countries from being able to enter the US. Further, Section 11 of the EO required DHS, in consultation with the DOJ, to collect and publish information regarding foreign nationals and terrorism. This requirement included information on: foreign nationals who have participated in terrorism-related activities in the US, foreign nationals who have become radicalized since entering the US, honor killings, and \"any other information relevant to public safety and security.\" According to the complaint, the report misled the public in several ways: (1) by focusing on international terrorism thereby artificially inflating the proportion of terrorist incidents committed by foreign nationals relative to native born citizens, (2) by including individuals who committed acts of terror abroad but had minimal ties to the US, and (3) by counting foreign-born individuals rather than foreign nationals in its figures. The plaintiff argued that such misleading information perpetuated the Trump administration's discrimination against Muslims as well as general anti-Muslim stereotypes and sentiments. As such, the plaintiff argued that the report was harmful to Muslim communities.</p><p>On April 10, 2018, the case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley.</p><p>On August 2, 2018, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that the plaintiff lacked standing and did not have a right of action under the IQA. On August 22, the government requested the court to stay the case because their IQA guidelines allow petitioners to submit an administrative appeal of IQA responses. On August 23, 2018, Magistrate Judge Corley ordered the matter stayed until November 28, 2018.</p><p>On November 29, 2018, Magistrate Judge Corley ordered the matter further stayed pending the plaintiff's administrative appeal and a joint status report. </p><p>The parties stipulated that the stay would expire on February 19, 2019. The defendants issued its final response in the plaintiff's administrative appeal in the week of February 18, 2019. </p><p>On April 1, 2019, the plaintiff filed its first amended complaint to include a summary of the administrative appeal. The plaintiff asserted that in its final response in the administrative appeal, defendants admitted that \"the information quality concerns raised by plaintiff have merit\" and that “information in the Report could be criticized by some readers, consistent with some of the concerns\" raised by the plaintiff. The plaintiff contended that despite these concessions, defendants declined to retract or correct the report and continue to disseminate it, in violation of the IQA. </p><p>On April 29, 2019, the government filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's first amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, or alternatively for failure to state a claim. The defendants asserted that every court to have considered a claim alleging a violation of the IQA has rejected it, reasoning that third-parties have no basis to enforce legal rights under the IQA. The defendants further alleged that the plaintiff lacked standing, as the plaintiff was unable to establish an injury in fact that is traceable to the report and that the plaintiff's claim was unlikely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. The defendants last argued that its responses to the plaintiff's administrative appeal do not constitute \"final agency action\" and are thus not reviewable under the APA. </p><p>On July 19, 2019, Magistrate Judge Corley issued an order granting the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Judge Corley held that the plaintiff did not adequately state a claim because its claim, premised on alleged violations of the IQA, was not subject to judicial review under the APA. Judge Corley was inclined to order that the complaint be dismissed without leave to amend, as there was nothing to suggest that the plaintiff could amend its complaint to correct the deficiencies noted by defendants. However, Judge Corley granted the plaintiff 30 days leave to file an amended complaint. 2019 WL 3254230.</p><p>On September 16, 2019, Judge Corley entered final judgment in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff after plaintiff did not file an amended complaint by the August 19, 2019 deadline.</p><p>Plaintiff has not filed an appeal of the district court's final judgment and the case is now closed.</p>",

(Dkt.

No. 40.)  After \n20  careful consideration of the parties’ briefing, and having had the benefit of oral argument on June \n21  20, 2019, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion because Plaintiff’s claim \n22  premised on alleged violations of the IQA is not subject to judicial review under the APA.  \n23  // \n24  // \n25  // \n26 \n                                                 \n1 Record citations are to material in the Electronic Case File (“ECF”); pinpoint citations are to the \n27 \nECF-generated page numbers at the top of the documents.  \n2 All parties have consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n28 \n636(c).  (Dkt. Nos.  \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 2 of 20\n \n1  BACKGROUND \n2  I.  Relevant Statutory and Factual Background3 \n3    A.  The Information Quality Act and Implementing Guidelines \n4    The IQA “was included as a brief note to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, \n5  Pub. L. No. 106-554, 114 Stat. 2763 (2000),” (codified at 44 U.S.C. 3516 note (Paperwork \n6  Reduction Act Guidelines)).  Harkonen v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 800 F.3d 1143, 1145 (9th Cir. \n7  2015).  The statute directs the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) to “‘issue guidelines . . \n8  . that provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the \n9  quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) \n10  disseminated by Federal agencies in fulfillment of the purposes and provisions of . . . the \n11  Paperwork Reduction Act.’”  Id. (quoting 44 U.S.C. 3516 note).  The IQA’s focus “is on the \n12  quality of information shared by federal agencies, and on ensuring broad access to information.”  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Id. at 1148.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    The IQA directs that the content of OMB’s guidelines shall: \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (1)  apply  to  the  sharing  by  Federal  agencies  of,  and  access  to, \n sir\net information disseminated by Federal agencies; and \ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr (2) Require that each Federal agency to which the guidelines apply— \nee 17 \nth\nintr   (A) issue guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality,    \nUo\nN 18 \n                                                 \n19 \n3 Courts ordinarily do not look beyond the four corners of the complaint when considering a \nmotion to dismiss.  Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001).  “A court may, \n20 \nhowever, consider certain materials—documents attached to the complaint, documents \nincorporated by reference in the complaint, or matters of judicial notice—without converting the \n21 \nmotion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.”  United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, \n908 (9th Cir. 2003).  Under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b), “court[s] may judicially notice a fact \n22 \nthat is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial court’s \nterritorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose \n23 \naccuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Here, the complaint includes as exhibits \ncorrespondence to and from DOJ and DHS regarding the government report at issue and \n24 \nPlaintiff’s subsequent request for correction of that report under the IQA.  (Dkt. No. 37, Exs. A-\nN.)  Thus, those documents are properly before the Court.  Defendants request that the Court also \n25 \n“take judicial notice of the Initial Section 11 Report, which is available on the DHS website,” and \ncited in the FAC.  (Dkt. No. 40 at 14 n.1 (citing Dkt. No. 37 at ¶ 38 n.8).)  Because the Section 11 \n26 \nReport is cited in the complaint and indeed forms the basis for Plaintiff’s APA claim, it is properly \nbefore the Court under the incorporation-by-reference doctrine.  Further, the Section 11 Report is \n27 \njudicially noticeable under Rule 201(b).  See Barron v. Reich, 13 F.3d 1370, 1377 (9th Cir. 1994) \n(noting that district courts may take judicial notice of “[r]ecords and reports of administrative \n28 \nbodies”).   \n2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 3 of 20\n \n  objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including \n1    statistical information) disseminated by the agency, by not \n  later than 1 year after the date of issuance of the guidelines \n2    under subsection (a); \n3    (B) establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected \n  persons  to  seek  and  obtain  correction  of  information \n4    maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not \n  comply with the guidelines issued under subsection (a); and  \n5 \n  (C) Report periodically to the director— \n6 \n    (i) the number and nature of complaints received by \n7      the agency regarding the accuracy of information  \n    disseminated by the agency; and  \n8 \n    (ii) how such complaints were handled by the agency   \n9 \n10  44 U.S.C. 3516 note.  The IQA does not expressly provide for judicial review of information \n11  disseminated by Federal agencies, or otherwise provide a private right of action.   \n12      1.  OMB Guidelines \na \ntr in\nuoro 13    OMB issued its final guidelines pursuant to the IQA in February 22, 2002.  See Guidelines \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Disseminated by Federal Agencies, 67 Fed. Reg. 8452 (Feb. 22, 2002).  The guidelines set forth \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  four central duties that agencies must undertake: (1) “adopt a basic standard of quality (including \nS d nr\nee 17  objectivity, utility, and integrity)” that is “to be ensured and established at levels appropriate to the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  nature and timeliness of the information . . . disseminated,” as well as specific quality standards \n19  “for the various categories of information”; (2) develop a quality review process to ensure the \n20  “objectivity, utility, and integrity[ ] of information before it is disseminated”; (3) “establish \n21  administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain, where appropriate, \n22  timely correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply \n23  with OMB or agency guidelines,” as well as “an administrative appeal process” for “requests for \n24  reconsideration” of agency decisions; and (4) submit to OMB a report detailing the agency’s \n25  information quality guidelines and thereafter submit a yearly report regarding any complaints the \n26  agency receives related to its compliance with OMB’s Guidelines.  67 Fed. Reg. at 8458-59.   \n27  // \n28  // \n3 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 4 of 20\n \n1      2.  DOJ Guidelines \n2    DOJ issued its guidelines (“DOJ Guidelines”) in October 2002 in response to OMB’s \n3  directive.  See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, DOJ Information Quality Guidelines, \n4  https://www.justice.gov/information-quality.  The DOJ Guidelines track the language of the OMB \n5  Guidelines, stating, in pertinent part that they “will adhere to the basic standards cited in the final \n6  OMB Guidelines and focus on the following areas”: (1) “adopt[ing] a basic standard of quality \n7  (including objectivity, utility, and integrity); (2) develop[ing] a process for reviewing the quality . \n8  . . of information before it is disseminated; and (3) establish[ing] administrative mechanisms \n9  allowing affected persons (individual or entity that may use, benefit, or be harmed by the \n10  disseminated information at issue) to seek and obtain, where appropriate, timely correction of \n11  information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with OMB or \n12  agency guidelines.”  Id.   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13    The DOJ Guidelines specify that those requesting correction of information “bear the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  ‘burden of proof’ with respect to the necessity for correction as well as with respect to the type of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  correction they seek.”  Id.  DOJ will review such requests, and “[a]fter it has completed its review, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  DOJ will determine whether a correction is warranted, and, if so, what corrective action it will \nS d nr\nee 17  take.”  Id.  Further: \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Any corrective action will be determined by the nature and timeliness \nof the information involved and such factors as the significance of the \n19  error on the use of the information and the magnitude of the error.  \nDOJ is not required to change, or in any way alter, the content or \n20  status of information simply based on the receipt of a request for \ncorrection. \n21 \n22  Id.  The DOJ Guidelines provide that the agency “will normally respond to requests for correction \n23  of information within 60 calendar days of receipt,” and “will inform the requester that more time \n24  is required” if necessary.  Id.  If a petitioner disagrees with the agency’s determination, it can file a \n25  request for reconsideration; DOJ will respond to such requests “within 45 calendar days of \n26  receipt.”  Id.   \n27    As to their scope, the DOJ Guidelines expressly state: \n28  These guidelines are not a regulation. They are not legally enforceable \n4 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 5 of 20\n \nand do not create any legal rights or impose any legally binding \n1  requirements or obligations on the agency or the public.  Nothing in \nthese guidelines affects any otherwise available judicial review of \n2  agency action.     \n3  Id.   \n4      3.  DHS Guidelines \n5    The DHS guidelines (“DHS Guidelines”) became effective on March 18, 2011.  See U.S. \n6  Dep’t of Homeland Security, Information Quality Guidelines 1 (2011), \n7  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/dhs-iq-guidelines-fy2011.pdf.  The DHS \n8  Guidelines track the DOJ Guidelines in that they “adhere to the basic standards cited in the OMB \n9  guidelines and focus on the [same basic] areas.”4  Id. at 2.  The DHS Guidelines further track the \n10  DOJ Guidelines regarding requests for correction; specifically, they provide that: (1) the burden is \n11  on the petitioner to demonstrate that the information does not comply with the DHS or OMB \n12  Guidelines; (2) DHS Components “should respond to requests for correction” within 60 days of \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  receipt, and notify the petitioner if the request “requires an extended period of time for \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  processing”; and (3) DHS components “should develop an administrative appeals process” \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  regarding requests for correction and respond to such appeals within 60 days.  Id. at 6, 8.  Further: \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  In making determinations of whether or not to correct information, \nS d nr [DHS] Components may reject claims made in bad faith or without \nee 17  justification.  [DHS] Components need undertake only the degree of \nth\nintr correction  that  they  conclude  is  appropriate  for  the  nature  and \nUo\nN 18  timeliness of the information involved and explain such practices in \ntheir annual fiscal year reports to DHS. \n19 \n20  Id. at 6.  Also like the DOJ Guidelines, the DHS Guidelines expressly limit their enforceability:  \n21  The guidelines are not intended to be, and should not be construed as, \nlegally  binding  regulations  or  mandates.    These  guidelines  are \n22  intended only to improve the internal management of DHS and, \ntherefore, are not legally enforceable and do not create any legal rights \n23  or impose any legally binding requirements or obligations on the \n24 \n                                                 \n4 As with the DOJ Guidelines, the stated focus of the DHS Guidelines is on: (1) “a basic standard \n25 \nof quality (including objectivity, utility, and integrity)”; (2) developing “a process for reviewing \nthe quality . . . of information before it is disseminated”; and (3) establish[ing] administrative \n26 \nmechanisms allowing affected persons (individual or entity that may use, benefit, or be harmed by \nthe disseminated information at issue) to seek and obtain, where appropriate, timely correction of \n27 \ninformation maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with OMB or \nagency guidelines.”  See U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, Information Quality Guidelines 2 \n28 \n(2011), https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/dhs-iq-guidelines-fy2011.pdf.   \n5 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 6 of 20\n \nagency  or  the  public.    Nothing  in  these  guidelines  affects  any \n1  available judicial review of agency action.  \n2  Id.   \n3    B.  Executive Order No. 13780 \n4    On March 6, 2017, the President of the United States signed Executive Order No. 13780, \n5  Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.  82 Fed. Reg. 13209 \n6  (Mar. 6, 2017).  The order “temporarily restricted the entry (with case-by-case waivers) of foreign \n7  nationals from six countries”—Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—“because each ‘is \n8  a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or \n9  contains active conflict zones.’”  Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2404 (2018) (quoting Exec. \n10  Order No. 13780, § 1(d), 82 Fed. Reg. at 13210).  Section 11 of the order directed “the Secretary \n11  of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General,” to “collect and make publicly \n12  available the following information” for purposes of public transparency: \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  (i) information  regarding the number of foreign nationals  in  the \nCfi\n tla United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses \nciC 14  while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses \nrts fo while in the United States; or removed from the United States based \niD tc 15  on terrorism-related activity, affiliation with or provision of material \n sir\net support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national-\ntatsiD 16  security-related reasons; \nS d nr\nee 17  (ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the \nth\nintr United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United \nUo\nN 18  States and who have engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have \nprovided  material  support  to  terrorism-related  organizations  in \n19  countries that pose a threat to the United States; \n20  (iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-\nbased violence against women, including so-called “honor killings,” \n21  in the United States by foreign nationals; and \n22  (iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as \ndetermined by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney \n23  General, including information on the immigration status of foreign \nnationals charged with major offenses. \n24 \n25  Exec. Order No. 13780, § 11, 82 Fed. Reg. at 13217.   \n26    C.  The Section 11 Report \n27    As directed, in January 2018 DOJ and DHS issued a joint report responsive to Section 11 \n28  of the Executive Order.  See U.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Executive \n6 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 7 of 20\n \n1  Order 13780: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, Initial \n2  Section 11 Report (Jan. 2018) (the “Report”).5  The Report notes, in pertinent part: \n3  [S]ubsequent  to  the  issuance  of  Executive  Order  13780,  the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of \n4  Justice  (DOJ)  worked  collaboratively  to  provide  information \nresponsive  to  the  requirements  of  Section  11.  Unless  specified \n5  otherwise, this initial report includes information for the period from \nSeptember 11, 2001 until the date of issuance. Notably, however, \n6  because of previous information collection and reporting practices of \nDHS and DOJ, some of the information provided in this initial report \n7  does  not  capture  the  full  spectrum  of  statistics  envisioned  by \nExecutive Order 13780. DHS and DOJ will endeavor to provide \n8  additional  information  in  future  reports  issued  pursuant  to  the \nrequirements of Executive Order 13780. \n9 \n10  Id. at 1.  The Report addresses the four previously-discussed substantive categories of information \n11  outlined in the Executive Order.  See id. at 2-10.   \n12    D.  Plaintiff’s Request for Correction \na \ntr in\nuoro 13    Plaintiff petitioned DOJ and DHS for correction of the Report on January 29, 2018.  (Dkt. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Nos. 37 at ¶ 85 & 37-2, Ex. B.)  The petition cites five categories of information as deliberately \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  misleading and biased and thus in violation of the IQA.  First: \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Section 11 directed the Departments to provide information related to \nS d nr foreign nations and terrorism-related offenses, which the Executive \nee 17  Order claimed would be used to inform the country’s immigration \nth\nintr policy.  Instead, the Report provided information regarding foreign-\nUo\nN 18  born individuals rather than foreign nationals, which allows it to \nattribute  73  percent  of  international  terrorism-related  offenses  to \n19  individuals who the Departments  apparently perceive as  foreign, \ndespite their American citizenship.  \n20 \n21  (Dkt. No. 37-2, Ex. B at 7.)  Second, “[t]he Report’s substitution of international terrorism for all \n22  terrorism misleadingly ignores domestic terrorism, artificially inflating the proportion of terrorist \n23  incidents committed by foreign nationals.”  (Id. at 8.)  Third, “[t]he Report’s inclusion of \n24  individuals who committed terrorism overseas and whose only apparent tie to the United States is \n25  extradition to the United States for prosecution.”  (Id. at 9.)  Fourth, “[t]he Report’s examples of \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n5 \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Executive%20Order%2013780%20Section%2\n28 \n011%20Report%20-%20Final.pdf \n7 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 8 of 20\n \n1  foreign nationals charged with or convicted of terrorism-related offenses are misleading and \n2  perpetuate the Administration’s discriminatory narrative that Muslims are likely to commit acts of \n3  terrorism.”  (Id. at 10.)  Finally, “[t]he Report’s information relating to gender-based violence is \n4  misleading and perpetuates anti-Muslim stereotypes.”  (Id. at 11.)  Plaintiff asserted that it was an \n5  “affected person” under the terms of the agency guidelines, and requested that DOJ and DHS \n6  retract the Report, and if necessary, publish a revised Report correcting the deficiencies noted by \n7  Plaintiff.  (Id. at 12-13.)   \n8    DOJ and DHS separately responded in writing to Plaintiff’s petition on June 15, 2018, and \n9  June 19, 2018, respectively, notifying Plaintiff that its request for correction was under review.  \n10  (Dkt. Nos. 37-3, Ex. C & 37-4, Ex. D.)  DOJ issued its denial on July 31, 2018, addressing each of \n11  Plaintiff’s five categories of concern, “determin[ing] that there is no inconsistency with the IQA \n12  Guidelines,” and “conclud[ing] that neither retraction nor correction of [the Report] is required \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  under the IQA Guidelines.”  (Dkt. No. 37-5, Ex. E at 4.)  The denial letter notes Plaintiff’s right to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  request reconsideration.  (Id.)   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    DHS denied Plaintiff’s request for correction by letter dated August 1, 2018.  (Dkt. No. 37-\n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  6, Ex. F.)  The letter asserts in part that Plaintiff based “much of” its request for correction “not on \nS d nr\nee 17  the data in the Report itself, but on [Plaintiff’s] differing interpretation of that data, which do[es] \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  not warrant correction under the Department’s IQA guidelines.”  (Id. at 3.)  Thus, DHS \n19  “conclude[d] that neither retraction nor correction of information in the [Report] is warranted.”  \n20  (Id.)  DHS noted, however, that it would “take the points raised in [Plaintiff’s] request into \n21  consideration in the preparation of future reports.”  (Id.)  The letter further notes Plaintiff’s “right \n22  to an administrative appeal.”  (Id. at 4.)   \n23    E.  Plaintiff’s Requests for Reconsideration \n24    On September 13, 2018, Plaintiff filed separate but identical requests for reconsideration of \n25  the DOJ and DHS denials, asserting that “[t]he Report must be corrected because the information \n26  it presents inflates the proportion of terrorist events that it can attribute to immigrants, especially \n27  Muslim men,” and restating that the five previously-discussed categories information are \n28  misleading and do not meet IQA standards.  (Dkt. Nos. 37-7, Ex. G at 2-13 & 37-8, Ex. H at 2-\n8 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 9 of 20\n \n1  13.)  DOJ and DHS issued interim responses on October 24, 2018, and November 7, 2018, \n2  respectively, indicating that Plaintiff’s request for reconsideration was under review.  (Dkt. Nos. \n3  37-9, Ex. I & 37-11, Ex. K.)   \n4    DOJ denied Plaintiff’s request for reconsideration by letter dated December 21, 2018.  \n5  (Dkt. No. 37-10, Ex. J.)  DOJ’s denial letter addresses each of Plaintiff’s “five general areas of \n6  concern regarding the Report,” and states, in pertinent part: \n7  [T]he Department concludes on reconsideration that information in \nthe Report could be criticized by some readers, consistent with some \n8  of  the  concerns  voiced  in  your  Request  for  Reconsideration.  \nHowever, the Department  also  concludes that it  was sufficiently \n9  transparent in its presentation of information, and as a result, the \nReport should not be withdrawn or corrected.  Working closely with \n10  DHS, the Department will consider IQA principles in issuing future \nreports under Section 11 of Executive Order 13780 to better present \n11  such information to the public. \n12  (Id. at 2.)   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13    On December 19, 2018, DHS notified Plaintiff that DHS needed additional time to “review \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  and respond” to Plaintiff’s request for reconsideration.  (Dkt. No. 37-12, Ex. L at 2.)  DHS notified \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Plaintiff on January 31, 2019 that further time was required due to a lapse in appropriations.  (Dkt. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  No. 37-13, Ex. M at 2.)  On February 14, 2019, DHS denied Plaintiff’s request for reconsideration.  \nS d nr\nee 17  (Dkt. No. 37-14, Ex. N.)  DHS’s denial letter addresses Plaintiff’s five areas of concern, and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  states, in pertinent part:  \n19  The  Department  has  conducted  an  independent  review  of  your \nRequest for Reconsideration and concludes that, while it will take into \n20  consideration in future Section 11 Reports those points raised in both \nyour Requests for Correction and Reconsideration, the Section 11 \n21  Report  was  sufficiently  transparent  in  its  presentation  of  the \ninformation and meets the IQA guidelines.  It therefore declines to \n22  withdraw or correct it.  \n23  (Id. at 2.)   \n24  II.  Complaint Allegations and Requested Relief \n25    Plaintiff is a civil rights organization located in Washington, D.C.  (Dkt. No. 37 at ¶ 12 \n26  n.1.)  It “promotes freedom and justice for Americans of all faiths, with a particular focus on \n27  issues impacting Muslim communities.”  (Id.)  In carrying out its mission, Plaintiff “engages in \n28  civil rights litigation, policy advocacy, and public education to fight inaccurate stereotypes about \n9 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 10 of 20\n \n1  Muslims and other immigrants.”  (Id.) \n2    The gravamen of the FAC is that the Report “fails the objectivity and utility requirements” \n3  of “[t]he IQA, OMB’s IQA Guidelines, and DOJ and DHS’s IQA Guidelines,” and instead \n4  “presents information in a deceptive, misleading, and incomplete manner, and in so doing, \n5  mispresents the actual terror threat to the country, artificially inflating the threat that immigrants \n6  and Muslims pose to the United States.”6  (Id. at ¶¶ 108, 110; see also id. at ¶¶ 4-7, 41-84.)  As a \n7  result, “Defendants’ ongoing dissemination of the Report following their denials of Plaintiff[’s] \n8  Petition and Appeal Petitions violates the IQA and its implementing Guidelines, and is therefore \n9  arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with law, without observance of \n10  procedure required by law, and otherwise violative of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).”  (Id. at ¶ 111.)    \n11    Plaintiff seeks the following relief: (1) declarations “that the Report disseminates \n12  information that fails the standard of quality required of federal agencies,” and “that Defendants \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  violated the IQA, its implementing Guidelines, and the APA”; (2) an order requiring “Defendants \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  to expressly retract or correct the Report and to cease dissemination of the Report”; (3) attorneys’ \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  fees and costs of suit; and (4) “such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.”  (Id. at \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  32.)   \nS d nr\nee 17  III.  Procedural History \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    Plaintiff filed its original complaint on April 9, 2018, asserting a claim under the APA for \n19  violation of the IQA.  (Dkt. No. 1.)  Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the same \n20  grounds asserted in the instant motion.  (See Dkt. No. 21).  The parties then filed a stipulation to \n21  stay the case pending Plaintiff’s administrative appeals, (Dkt. No. 25), which the Court granted, \n22  (Dkt. No. 26).  Plaintiff filed the FAC after completing the administrative appeals process, (Dkt. \n23 \n                                                 \n24 \n6 Although the FAC contains allegations regarding Defendants’ processing of Plaintiff’s IQA \nrequests for correction and reconsideration, (see Dkt. No. ¶¶ 9, 90, 92-93, 99-105 (alleging \n25 \ninadequate or tardy responses to Plaintiff’s petitions)), the thrust of Plaintiff’s claim concerns the \ncontent of the Report, (see id. at ¶ 11 (noting that despite Plaintiff’s IQA petitions, “Defendants \n26 \ndeclined to retract or correct the Report, and instead continue to disseminate it. In doing so they \nviolate the IQA and its implementing Guidelines.”)).  Plaintiff’s requested relief further indicates \n27 \nthat Plaintiff’s claim is based on the content of the Report and not inadequate processing of \nPlaintiff’s petitions, (see id. at 32 (seeking injunctive relief requiring “Defendants to expressly \n28 \nretract or correct the Report and to cease dissemination of the Report”)).      \n10 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 11 of 20\n \n1  No. 37), and Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss, (Dkt. No. 40).  The motion is fully \n2  briefed, (see Dkt. Nos. 41 & 44), and the Court heard oral argument on June 20, 2019.     \n3  DISCUSSION \n4    Defendants argue that dismissal is warranted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject \n5  matter jurisdiction because: (1) Plaintiff lacks standing; specifically, Plaintiff fails to satisfy the \n6  injury-in-fact prong; (2) the IQA does not confer any legal rights and thus Plaintiff does not have a \n7  right of action under the statute; and (3) Plaintiff’s claim is not subject to judicial review under the \n8  APA.  (See Dkt. No. 40 at 22-30.)  Defendants argue in the alternative that dismissal is warranted \n9  under Rule 12(b)(6) because Plaintiff fails to state a claim for relief under the APA.  The Court \n10  addresses dismissal only in the context of Rule 12(b)(6) because Defendants’ standing arguments \n11  are intertwined with their 12(b)(6) arguments, and even if Plaintiff was to satisfy Article III \n12  standing requirements, Plaintiff fails to state a claim under the APA.      \na \ntr in\nuoro 13    A.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim Under the APA \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    There is no dispute that the IQA does not provide a private right of action; thus, Plaintiff \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  brings its challenge under the APA.  See Family Farm All. v. Salazar, 749 F. Supp. 2d 1083, 1090-\n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  91 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (“A party challenging an administrative agency’s compliance with a \nS d nr\nee 17  substantive statute that lacks an internal private right of action must seek judicial review under the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  APA.”) (citing Lujan, 497 U.S. at 882).  Pursuant to the APA, a plaintiff may seek judicial review \n19  of agency action that is either “made reviewable by statute” or constitutes “final agency action for \n20  which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Defendants assert that there \n21  is no judicial review of agency IQA decisions under the APA because: (1) the IQA precludes \n22  judicial review; (2) IQA determinations are “committed to agency discretion”; and (3) such \n23  determinations do not constitute final agency action for APA purposes.  (Dkt. No. 40 at 27-30.)   \n24      1.  Judicial Review is Precluded under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) \n25    Judicial review is precluded under the APA when the “challenged agency action is \n26  committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  In general, Section 701(a)(2) \n27  precludes judicial review “if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful \n28  standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. \n11 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 12 of 20\n \n1  812, 830 (1985).  Thus, courts must “consider the language of the statute and whether the general \n2  purposes of the statute would be endangered by judicial review.”  Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v. United \n3  States, 648 F.3d 708, 719 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n4  Here, neither the IQA nor its implementing guidelines provide judicially manageable \n5  standards “against which to judge an agency’s exercise of discretion” in deciding whether to grant \n6  an IQA request for correction.  See Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830.  The IQA itself directs OMB to issue \n7  guidelines to Federal agencies to aid them in ensuring “the quality, objectivity, utility, and \n8  integrity” of disseminated information.  44 U.S.C. § 3516 note.  The IQA provides no substantive \n9  standards as to those terms.  The statute further directs OMB to require Federal agencies to issue \n10  their own guidelines that comply with OMB’s guidelines and set forth agency-specific \n11  “administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of \n12  information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with the [OMB] \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  guidelines.”  Id.  Again, the statute itself does not provide standards regarding those administrative \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  mechanisms.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Pursuant to the IQA, the OMB Guidelines direct agencies, in pertinent part to “establish \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain, where appropriate, \nS d nr\nee 17  timely correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  with OMB or agency guidelines.”  67 Fed. Reg. at 8459 (emphasis added).  Further, the OMB \n19  Guidelines provide that the agencies’ “administrative mechanisms shall be flexible, [and] \n20  appropriate to the nature and timeliness of the disseminated information.”  Id. (emphasis added).  \n21  As to the IQA request determination, the Guidelines state: \n22  Agencies, in making their determination of whether or not to correct \ninformation,  may  reject  claims  made  in  bad  faith  or  without \n23  justification,  and  are  required  to  undertake  only  the  degree  of \ncorrection that they conclude is appropriate for the nature and \n24  timeliness of the information involved.   \n25  Id. at 8458 (emphasis added).  The OMB Guidelines’ use of discretionary language (i.e., “where \n26  appropriate,” “flexible,” “that they conclude is appropriate”) provides for complete agency \n27  discretion in determining whether to even consider—much less grant—a party’s IQA request for \n28  correction.   \n12 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 13 of 20\n \n1  The DOJ and DHS guidelines likewise provide no judicially manageable standards by \n2  which to assess the propriety of their IQA determinations.  The guidelines instead track the OMB \n3  Guidelines and provide similar discretionary language regarding agency determinations of \n4  requests for correction.  See DOJ Guidelines (“Any corrective action will be determined by the \n5  nature and timeliness of the information involved and such factors as the significance of the error \n6  on the use of the information and the magnitude of the error.  DOJ is not required to change, or in \n7  any way alter, the content or status of information simply based on the receipt of a request for \n8  correction.”); DHS Guidelines at 6 (“[DHS] Components need undertake only the degree of \n9  correction that they conclude is appropriate for the nature and timeliness of the information \n10  involved and explain such practices in their annual fiscal year reports to DHS.”).   \n11    Plaintiff asserts that the OMB Guidelines and relevant agency guidelines “set forth precise \n12  and detailed definitions of the statute’s information quality watchwords: ‘quality’, ‘utility’; \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  ‘objectivity’; and ‘integrity’” that “provide[ ] meaningful standards for courts to apply to evaluate \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  whether an agency has properly reviewed a petition for correction.”  (Dkt. No. 41 at 9, 21 (quoting \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  67 Fed. Reg. at 8459-60).)  The Court disagrees.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Although the OMB and relevant agency guidelines contain defined terms, those terms \nS d nr\nee 17  alone do not create judicially manageable standards by which a court can determine the propriety \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  of an agency’s decision regarding a petition for correction.  Instead, the OMB Guidelines’ broad \n19  language regarding an agency’s discretion in considering requests for correction demonstrates that \n20  the application of such terms to a specific request is not a mechanical process but instead depends \n21  upon the “nature and timeliness of the information involved.”  See 67 Fed. Reg. at 8458 (providing \n22  that agencies “are required to undertake only the degree of correction that they conclude is \n23  appropriate for the nature and timeliness of the information involved”).  And as previously \n24  discussed, the DOJ and DHS Guidelines provide near verbatim discretionary language regarding \n25  when correction is necessary.  Such language does not lend itself to judicial review.  \n26  Plaintiff further argues that “the structure and purpose of the IQA provide an additional \n27  standard against which the Court can consider Plaintiff’s APA claim.”  (Dkt. No. 41 at 23 (citing \n28  Page v. Donovan, 727 F.2d 866, 868 (9th Cir. 1984) (“Even if the statute is drawn broadly, review \n13 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 14 of 20\n \n1  is not precluded if the legislative history offers standards that a reviewing court can apply.”)).)  \n2  Plaintiff asserts that it is implicit in the IQA “that agencies cannot exercise their discretion in a \n3  manner that renders the rights of ‘affected persons’ illusory.”  (Id. (citing 44 U.S.C. § 3516 note).)  \n4  As the Court previously concluded, however, the IQA creates no enforceable legal rights to \n5  information or its correctness; thus, any procedural right created by the IQA’s directive that OMB \n6  issue guidelines requiring federal agencies to “establish administrative mechanisms allowing \n7  affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information,” see 44 U.S.C. § 3516 note, is not \n8  tethered to a legal interest.  If the IQA creates no enforceable legal right to information or its \n9  correctness, then it follows that the “structure and purpose” of the IQA does not create judicially \n10  manageable standards by which to judge an agency’s decision regarding a request for correction.    \n11    The Court’s conclusion that judicial review is precluded under § 701(a)(2) is in line with \n12  other courts that have squarely addressed IQA-based APA claims and concluded that the merits of \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  such claims are not reviewable.  See, e.g., Harkonen v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, No. C-12-629 CW, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  2012 WL 6019571, at *16 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 3, 2012) (“[T]he IQA and agency guidelines grant \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  sufficient discretion to the DOJ to preclude judicial review under the APA.”), aff’d on other \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  grounds, 800 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 2015); Salazar, 749 F. Supp. 2d at 1092-95 (finding IQA-based \nS d nr\nee 17  APA claim precluded from judicial review under § 701(a)(2)); Ams. for Safe Access v.

Minn. 2004) (same), aff’d in part and vacated in part on other grounds, 421 F.3d \n25  618 (8th Cir. 2005).  \n26    The cases cited by Plaintiff do not counsel a different result.  (See Dkt. No. 41 at 17, 19 \n27  (citing Zero Zone, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 832 F.3d 654, 678 n.25 (7th Cir. 2016); Harkonen \n28  v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 800 F.3d 1143, 1151 (9th Cir. 2015); Prime Time Int’l Co. v. Vilsack, 599 \n14 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 15 of 20\n \n1  F.3d 678, 686 (D.C. Cir. 2010)).)  In Zero Zone, the plaintiffs challenged the U.S. Department of \n2  Energy (“DOE”) “decisionmaking process and substance of . . . final rules” regarding “the energy \n3  efficiency of commercial refrigeration equipment.”  832 F.3d at 660-61.  The plaintiffs argued that \n4  the DOE’s rulemaking violated, in part, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and the court \n5  analyzed the action under the APA.  See id. at 667-68.  The plaintiffs also framed one issue, which \n6  the court discussed as an “alternative” argument, “as a violation of the Information Quality Act.”  \n7  Id. at 678 n.25.  The court noted, in a footnote: \n8  [The plaintiffs] frame this issue as a violation of the Information \nQuality Act.  See 44 U.S.C. § 3516 note (a).  However, “almost every \n9  court that has addressed an Information Quality Act challenge has \nheld that the statute ‘creates no legal rights in any third parties.’”  \n10  Miss. Comm’n on Envtl. Quality v. EPA, 790 F.3d 138, 184 (D.C. Cir. \n2015) (quoting Salt Inst. v. Leavitt, 440 F.3d 156, 159 (4th Cir. \n11  2006)).  That being said, the APA still affords the petitioners the right \nto bring this challenge.  \n12 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Id.  Plaintiff here cites Zero Zone for the proposition that “[m]ultiple Circuit Courts have \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  concluded that that IQA claims raised under the APA may be adjudicated.”  (See Dkt. No. 41 at \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  17.)  Nothing supports such an expansive reading of the Zero Zone footnote, however, which \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  contains that court’s lone reference to the IQA.  It appears instead that the Zero Zone court \nS d nr\nee 17  analyzed the particular issue characterized by the plaintiff as a violation of the IQA in the context \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  of the plaintiff’s overriding challenge to DOE’s rulemaking, which falls under the APA.  Further, \n19  and most importantly, the Zero Zone court did not do what Plaintiff asks the Court to do here: \n20  reach the merits of an IQA challenge under the APA by deciding whether an agency’s \n21  determination regarding a request for correction comports with the text of the IQA and its \n22  implementing guidelines.     \n23    The Ninth Circuit’s decision in Harkonen is similarly unhelpful to Plaintiff.  There the \n24  plaintiff filed an IQA request for correction with DOJ regarding press releases it issued detailing \n25  the plaintiff’s conviction for wire fraud.  800 F.3d at 1147.  DOJ denied the plaintiff’s request \n26  initially and on reconsideration, asserting that press releases were excluded from coverage under \n27  the DOJ Guidelines.  Id.  The plaintiff filed suit under the APA, claiming that DOJ’s denial of his \n28  request for correction under the IQA and “the exclusion of press releases from DOJ’s and OMB’s \n15 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 16 of 20\n \n1  [IQA] Guidelines” were arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law.”  Id.  \n2  The district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, noting that “[c]ourts that have \n3  reviewed the IQA have uniformly found that it ‘does not create any legal right to information or its \n4  correctness.’”  2012 WL 6019571 at *11 (collecting cases).  The district court thus concluded that \n5  there was no final agency action for purposes of an APA claim, and that judicial review was \n6  precluded under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  Id. at *11-17. \n7    On appeal, the plaintiff and defendants set forth the exact arguments at issue here; \n8  specifically, the plaintiff asserted that “the IQA imposes an obligation on the DOJ to correct \n9  information disseminated by the agency, and creates a right under the APA to judicial review of \n10  DOJ decisions not to correct this information.”  800 F.3d at 1148.  The defendants “argue[d] that \n11  the IQA does not authorize courts to review the correctness of information disseminated by an \n12  agency.”  Id.  The Ninth Circuit did not reach those arguments, however, and instead noted that its \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  “review must begin with the threshold question of whether OMB and DOJ had the authority to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  exclude press releases from the coverage of the IQA guidelines.”  Id. at 1149.  In doing so, the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Harkonen court expressly did not address the issue presented here, noting that “[w]e have no \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  reason in this case to reach the broad question of whether the IQA confers upon a private \nS d nr\nee 17  individual the right to seek judicial review of the correctness of all information published by the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  government.”  800 F.3d at 1148.  The court analyzed “[w]hether OMB’s and DOJ’s decisions to \n19  exclude press releases from the coverage of the IQA guidelines were within their authority” using \n20  the two-step test established by Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 \n21  (1984), and concluded that OMB and DOJ did have such authority and that the press release at \n22  issue was properly excluded from coverage.  Id. at 1149-51.  Thus, the court did not reach the \n23  merits of the plaintiff’s IQA-based APA claim but instead determined that the information at issue \n24  did not fall under the IQA’s coverage.   \n25    Plaintiff’s reliance on Prime Time is similarly unavailing.  There the plaintiff “sought \n26  disclosure and correction under the IQA of the data that [the U.S. Department of Agriculture \n27  (“USDA”)] used to calculate” its “quarterly assessments on tobacco manufacturers and importers” \n28  pursuant to the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act (“FETRA”), 7 U.S.C. § 518d(b).  599 \n16 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 17 of 20\n \n1  F.3d at 680, 685.  USDA did not respond to the plaintiff’s IQA requests, and plaintiff filed suit \n2  directly under the IQA and under the APA.  Single Stick, Inc. v. Johanns, 601 F. Supp. 2d 307, \n3  311-12 (D.D.C. 2009), aff’d in part and rev’d in part, Prime Time Int’l Co. v. Vilsack, 599 F.3d \n4  678 (D.C. Cir. 2010).  The district court dismissed the plaintiff’s “claim that USDA’s failure to \n5  respond to requests for disclosure and ‘correction’ of the data underlying the assessments violated \n6  the [IQA] . . . , ruling that the IQA did not vest any party with the right to disclosure and \n7  correction and that USDA’s failure to respond did not constitute final agency action subject to \n8  judicial review under the [APA].”  599 F.3d at 682.   \n9    On appeal, USDA argued that the FETRA assessments were excluded from IQA coverage \n10  under both the OMB and agency guidelines because the assessments constituted “adjudicative \n11  proceedings.”  Id. at 685.  The D.C. Circuit first determined that OMB properly “exercised its \n12  discretion to exclude documents prepared and distributed in the context of adjudicative \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  proceedings” in its interpretation of the IQA.  Id. at 685 (citing Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843).   As to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the merits of the plaintiff’s IQA claim, the court determined that the underlying agency action—\ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  FETRA assessments—were adjudicative proceedings and thus subject to APA review under the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act, 7 U.S.C. § 518d(i), (j).  Id. at 686 (concluding that the \nS d nr\nee 17  plaintiff had “rights to an administrative appeal and judicial review”) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 551(7) \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (defining “adjudication”) and 7 U.S.C. § 518d(i), (j)).  In other words, the court did not conclude \n19  that the IQA provides a right to review under the APA, but instead found that review is proper \n20  under FETRA and the APA.  See also Salazar, 749 F. Supp. 2d at 1096-1100 (concluding that \n21  Prime Time does not support that “the IQA provides a right to judicial review” under the APA); \n22  Harkonen, 2012 WL 609571, at *12 (“Prime Time does not support that . . . the court found there \n23  was a right to review under the APA.”).  The Prime Time court thus “affirm[ed] the dismissal of \n24  the IQA challenge, although on a different ground than relied upon by the district court.”  Id. at \n25  686.    \n26    Simply put, Plaintiff cites no case in which a court has done what Plaintiff asks this Court \n27  to do—adjudicate the merits of an IQA-based APA claim premised on an agency’s failure to grant \n28  a petition for correction.  Conversely, courts that have addressed the issue of APA claims \n17 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 18 of 20\n \n1  premised on alleged IQA violations have “uniformly found” that such claims are precluded from \n2  judicial review.  See Harkonen, 2012 WL 6019571 at *11 (collecting cases).  That authority is \n3  persuasive, and the Court follows it here.   \n4    In any event, as discussed below, even if the IQA’s implementing guidelines did provide \n5  judicially manageable standards, Plaintiff’s claim would still fail to state a cause of action under \n6  the APA.   \n7      2.  No “Final Agency Action” for Purposes of an APA Claim \n8  As previously discussed, the APA provides for judicial review of “final agency action for \n9  which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Determining whether an \n10  agency action is “final” is a two-step process.  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997).  \n11  The action must first “mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process.”  Id. \n12  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Next, “the action must be one by which rights or \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  Id. at 178 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In general, “administrative orders are not final \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and reviewable unless and until they impose an obligation, deny a right, or fix some legal \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  relationship as a consummation of the administrative process.”  Ukiah Valley Med. Ctr. v. FTC, \nS d nr\nee 17  911 F.2d 261, 264 (9th Cir. 1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Defendants \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  argue that Section 704 forecloses judicial review of Plaintiff’s IQA claim because Defendants’ \n19  decisions regarding Plaintiff’s requests for correction are not “actions from which legal \n20  consequences will flow.”  (Dkt. No. 40 at 30.)  The Court agrees.   \n21  Plaintiff asserts that Defendants’ “final denials determined rights and obligations” because \n22  the IQA and its implementing guidelines confer a procedural right that entitles petitioners to \n23  “‘seek and obtain correction’” of disseminated information “that is not of sufficient ‘quality,’ \n24  ‘objectivity,’ ‘utility,’ or ‘integrity.’”  (Dkt. No. 41 at 24 (quoting 44 U.S.C. § 3516 note \n25  (b)(2)(B)).)  Plaintiff fails to show, however, that a procedural right to petition for correction of \n26  information is tethered to any legal consequences or obligations that flow from Defendants’ \n27  denials of Plaintiff’s requests for correction.  Indeed, courts have rejected similar arguments that \n28  the IQA and its implementing guidelines implicate legal rights or cause legal consequences for \n18 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 19 of 20\n \n1  purposes of an APA claim, finding instead that the IQA “does not create any legal right to \n2  information or its correctness.”  See, e.g., Harkonen, 2012 WL 6019571, at *11 (“Courts that have \n3  reviewed the IQA have uniformly found that it ‘does not create any legal right to information or its \n4  correctness.’) (collecting cases); Salazar, 749 F. Supp. 2d at 1103 (finding that “[t]he IQA creates \n5  no enforceable legal rights at all”); Salt Inst. v. Leavitt, 440 F.3d 156, 159 (4th Cir. 2006) \n6  (affirming dismissal of IQA-based APA claim and finding the IQA “does not create any legal right \n7  to information or its correctness”).  Plaintiff cites no case in which a court has held that an \n8  agency’s final denial of an IQA request for correction constitutes final agency action for APA \n9  purposes.   \n10  To the extent that Plaintiff was entitled to petition for the correction of information under \n11  the IQA and its implementing guidelines, the DOJ and DHS afforded Plaintiff that procedural \n12  right and issued determinations on Plaintiff’s petitions.  Plaintiff points to no language in either \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  the IQA or its implementing guidelines suggesting that Defendants’ IQA determinations implicate \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  a legal right or obligation for purposes of an APA claim.  See Harkonen, 2012 WL 6019571, at \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  *12 (finding no final agency action for APA purposes because “the denial of Plaintiff’s request for \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  correction did not deny him a legal right.”).  Absent a showing that Defendants’ IQA \nS d nr\nee 17  determinations give rise to legal consequences, Plaintiff fails to allege final agency action for \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  purposes of an APA claim.   \n19  Plaintiff argues in a footnote that because it “raises procedure-based injuries, and not a \n20  right to informational correctness, the cases Defendants cite to establish that the IQA does not \n21  create a ‘legal right to information or its correctness’ are off base.”  (See Dkt. No. 41 at 16 n.6 \n22  (citing Salt Inst., 440 F.3d at 159; Harkonen, 2012 WL 6019571, at *11).)  Despite that assertion, \n23  however, the relief sought by Plaintiff’s complaint demonstrates that Plaintiff’s claim is premised \n24  on a purported right to informational correctness under the IQA that Salt Inst. and the district court \n25  in Harkonen squarely rejected.  The complaint seeks declarations “that the Report disseminates \n26  information that fails the standard of quality required of federal agencies” and “that Defendants \n27  violated the IQA, its implementing Guidelines, and the APA,” and an order requiring “Defendants \n28  to expressly retract or correct the Report and to cease dissemination of the Report.”  (Dkt. No. 1 at \n19 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 49   Filed 07/19/19   Page 20 of 20\n \n1  32.)  Plaintiff’s opposition reiterates that Plaintiff’s injury would be redressed by “[a] court order \n2  declaring that the Report fails to meet baseline information quality standards, that Defendants \n3  violated the IQA and the APA, and ordering them to correct or retract and cease disseminating \n4  the Report.”  (Dkt. No. 41 at 16 (emphasis added).)  Simply put, Plaintiff’s complaint does not \n5  seek redress for any “procedure-based injuries” but instead seeks correction of information.  Such \n6  relief is unavailable under the APA.  \n7  CONCLUSION \n8    For the reasons set forth above, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \n9  dismiss with prejudice to the extent Plaintiff challenges Defendants’ refusal to correct the Report.  \n10  Alleged violations of the IQA arising out of agency determinations regarding Plaintiff’s requests \n11  for correction and reconsideration cannot form the basis of an APA claim.  The Court is inclined \n12  to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint without leave to amend as Plaintiff’s opposition does not suggest \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  that Plaintiff could amend its complaint to correct any of the deficiencies noted by Defendants in \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  their motion and the Court is not aware of how it could.  Nonetheless, because the issue was not \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  explored at oral argument, the Court will grant Plaintiff 30 days leave to file an amended \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  complaint, provided Plaintiff believes in good faith that its amendment addresses the issues raised \nS d nr\nee 17  by the Court’s Order.  If Plaintiff instead simply disagrees with the Court’s ruling, then the next \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  steps are for the Court to enter judgment and for Plaintiff to pursue an appeal should it so choose.  \n19  Accordingly, should no amended complaint be filed within 30 days of this Order, the Court will \n20  enter judgment.   \n21    This Order disposes of Docket No. 40.   \n22  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n23  Dated: July 19, 2019 \n24   \n25     \nJACQUELINE SCOTT CORLEY \n26 \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n27 \n28 \n20 ",

President Trump campaigned on the promise of a “total and complete shutdown of \n7\n8 Muslims entering the United States.”  Since taking office, he sought to fulfill this overtly \n9 discriminatory pledge by enacting three successive bans on nationals of several Muslim-majority \n10\ncountries and a series of policies aimed at slowing the entry of refugees, particularly from \n11\nMuslim-majority countries, into the United States.  He has also attempted to reduce other \n12\nlongstanding paths to lawful immigration.   \n13\n2.  As part of this anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant agenda, the President and members of his \n14\nAdministration regularly overstate and misrepresent the threat that immigrants, especially \n15\n16 Muslim immigrants, pose to the United States.  This bias infects a report published by \n17 Defendants on January 16, 2018, the Executive Order 13780: Protecting the Nation From \n18\nForeign Terrorist Entry Into the United States Initial Section 11 Report (the “Report”).  \n19\n3.  Executive Order 13780, which required publication of the Report, incorporated President \n20\nTrump’s second attempt at a travel ban, and directed Defendants, in order to be “more \n21\ntransparent with the American people and to implement more effective policies and practices that \n22\nserve the national interest,” to compile and disseminate information that purports to link \n23\n24 terrorism to immigration.   \n25\n26\n27\n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 3 of 33\n \n1 4.  The Report presents information on immigrants and foreign nationals in a manner that \n2\nmisleadingly inflates the threat they pose to the United States.  Its presentation of this \n3\ninformation also focuses exclusively and inaccurately on Muslims. \n4\n5.  Among the ways the Report manipulates information to support its anti-immigrant and \n5\nanti-Muslim conclusions: it ignores domestic terrorism incidents; it departs from the directive of \n6\nEO 13780 and analyzes terrorism incidents involving foreign-born Americans rather than foreign \n7\n8 nationals; it includes individuals who committed terrorism acts overseas and whose only tie to \n9 the United States is their extradition for prosecution; and it relies on irrelevant and debunked \n10\nstudies in providing information regarding so-called “honor killings” and violence against \n11\nwomen. \n12\n6.  In so doing, the Report perpetuates the ongoing stigmatization of immigrants and \n13\nMuslims by the Administration.  For example, the Trump Administration used the Report to \n14\njustify its sweeping ban on the entry of nationals from six Muslim-majority countries into the \n15\n16 United States.  It has also specifically tied the Report’s findings to its calls for an end to the \n17 issuance of diversity and family reunification visas, which would have a significant negative \n18\nimpact on Muslim immigrants.   \n19\n7.  The Report has been used explicitly to stoke anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment \n20\nand is likely to continue to be used in this manner.  It therefore not only contributes on its face to \n21\nstigmatization, but it is also likely to contribute to increased acts of hate and violence against \n22\nthese communities. \n23\n24 8.  Muslim Advocates submitted a petition for retraction and correction of the Report (the \n25\n“Petition”) because the Report’s presentation of information does not meet the level of quality \n26\nrequired of federal agencies by the IQA and its implementing Guidelines. \n27\n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 4 of 33\n \n1 9.  Belatedly, and only after the initiation of this litigation, Defendants complied with their \n2\nobligation to respond substantively to Plaintiff’s Petition, declining to retract or correct the \n3\nReport.  The parties agreed to stay the litigation in order to proceed through the administrative \n4\nappeal process.   \n5\n10.  The administrative appeal process has now concluded.  In their final substantive \n6\nresponses, both Defendants admitted that the information quality concerns raised by Plaintiff \n7\n8 have merit.  DOJ conceded that “information in the Report could be criticized by some readers, \n9 consistent with some of the concerns voiced in your Request for Reconsideration.”  DHS agreed \n10\nthat Plaintiff’s criticisms of the Report’s biased selection of illustrative examples of terrorists “is \n11\nwell-taken.”  And DHS “acknowledge[d] the points you have raised” and will take them “into \n12\nconsideration in future Section 11 Reports.”   \n13\n11.  Nevertheless, Defendants declined to retract or correct the Report, and instead continue to \n14\ndisseminate it.  In so doing they violate the IQA and its implementing Guidelines. \n15\n16 Parties \n17 12.  Muslim Advocates is a civil rights organization that promotes freedom and justice for \n18\nAmericans of all faiths, with a particular focus on issues impacting Muslim communities.  \n19\nMuslim Advocates engages in civil rights litigation, policy advocacy, and public education to \n20\nfight inaccurate stereotypes about Muslims and other immigrants.  In particular, Muslim \n21\nAdvocates works to ensure that policies enacted under the banner of national security do not \n22\nwrongfully discriminate against Muslims and are not based on inaccurate or misleading \n23\n24 information.  Muslim Advocates’ headquarters are in Washington, DC.1   \n25\n26                                                  \n1 In January 2019, following the initiation of this case, Muslim Advocates closed the office it \n27\nmaintained in Oakland, California.  It now resides in Washington, DC. \n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 5 of 33\n \n1 13.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \n7\n8 because this action arises under federal law, specifically the IQA, 44 U.S.C. § 3516 note, and the \n9 APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.  \n10\n16.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), because Plaintiff resided \n11\nin this district at the time of the initial filing in this case.   \n12\n17.  At the time the Complaint was filed, Plaintiff resided in Alameda County, making \n13\nassignment to the Oakland Division appropriate pursuant to Local Civil Rule 3-2(c), (d). \n14\nThe Information Quality Act \n15\n16 18.  The IQA, together with its implementing Guidelines, requires that information \n17 disseminated to the public by federal agencies, including by DHS and DOJ, be of requisite \n18\nquality, objectivity, utility, and integrity.2 \n19\n19.  The IQA, an addendum to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq. \n20\n(“PRA”), directed the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) to issue guidelines under \n21\nvarious PRA authorities by September 30, 2001. \n22\n20.  The IQA provides that the guidelines issued by OMB should require each federal agency \n23\n24 to which they apply to, in turn: \n25\n                                                 \n26\n2 Consolidated Appropriations—FY 2001, Pub.

OMB issued “final guidelines”, as directed, after a period of notice and comment, in \n8\n2002.3 \n9\n22.  In issuing its Guidelines, OMB explained, “[g]iven the administrative mechanisms \n10\nrequired by [the IQA] as well as the standards set forth in the Paperwork Reduction Act, it is \n11\nclear that agencies should not disseminate substantive information that does not meet a basic \n12\n13 level of quality.”  67 Fed. Reg. at 8452.   \n14 23.  The OMB Guidelines elaborate on the directives set forth in the IQA itself.  They define \n15\n“quality”, “utility”, “objectivity,” and “integrity”, among other relevant terms.  These definitions \n16\nstate, in part: \n17\n“Quality” is an encompassing term comprising utility, objectivity, and integrity. \n18\n“Utility” refers to the usefulness of the information to its intended users, including \n19\nthe public. In assessing the usefulness of information that the agency disseminates \nto the public, the agency needs to consider the uses of the information not only \n20\nfrom the perspective of the agency but also from the perspective of the public. As \n21 a result, when transparency of information is relevant for assessing the \ninformation’s usefulness from the public's perspective, the agency must take care \n22 to ensure that transparency has been addressed in its review of the information. … \n23 “Objectivity” includes whether disseminated information is being presented in an \naccurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner. This involves whether the \n24\n                                                 \n25\n3 Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec.

Sometimes, in disseminating \ncertain types of information to the public, other information must also be \n2\ndisseminated in order to ensure an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased \npresentation.  \n3\n24.   The OMB Guidelines also require agencies to “establish administrative mechanisms \n4\n5 allowing affected persons to seek and obtain, where appropriate, timely correction of information \n6 maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with OMB or agency \n7\nguidelines.”  Id. at 8459. \n8\n25.  Defendants have each promulgated guidelines applicable to themselves. \n9\n26.  The DOJ Guidelines set forth definitions of “utility”, “objectivity”, and “integrity”, which \n10\n“apply, consistent with the OMB Guidelines (paragraph V, definitions) which will also apply.”4 \n11\n27.  The DOJ Guidelines also set forth a process for submitting a formal request for \n12\n13 correction, including a description of the information that requests for correction should include, \n14\nand a statement that the requester bears the burden of proof in seeking a correction.   \n15\n28.  The DOJ Guidelines state that:  \n16\nBased on the explanation and evidence submitted with the request for correction, \n17 a DOJ official who is knowledgeable of the subject matter will conduct a \nthorough review of the information being challenged, the processes that were used \n18\nto create and disseminate the information, and the conformity of the information \nand those processes with both OMB’s and DOJ’s Information Quality Guidelines.  \n19\nAfter it has completed its review, DOJ will determine whether a correction is \n20 warranted, and, if so, what corrective action it will take. … After the responsible \nDOJ component has made its final determination pertaining to a request for \n21 correction of information, it will respond to the requestor by letter, e-mail, or fax.  \nThe response will explain the findings and the actions to be taken (if any) in \n22\nresponse to the complaint.   \n23\n24\n                                                 \n25\n4 U.S. DOJ, Information Quality: Ensuring the Quality of the Information Disseminated by the \nDepartment (“DOJ Guidelines”), https://www.justice.gov/iqpr/information-quality (last updated \n26\nOct. 31, 2018). \n27\n \n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 8 of 33\n \n1 29.  DOJ Guidelines state that normally the agency will respond to a request for correction \n2\nwithin sixty calendar days of receipt, or will inform the requestor of any additional time needed \n3\nto resolve the request, the reason why, and an estimated decision date. \n4\n30.  The DHS Guidelines, which are based on the OMB Guidelines, also state that the three \n5\nunderlying requirements for quality information are utility, objectivity, and integrity of \n6\ninformation, and set forth accompanying definitions.5   \n7\n8 31.  The DHS Guidelines also provide for an administrative information correction process, \n9 whereby “affected persons can seek, and obtain, where appropriate, timely correction of \n10\ninformation that does not comply with OMB Guidelines, DHS Guidelines, or [DHS] Component \n11\nstandards.”6   \n12\n32.

In addition to the travel restrictions, Section 11 of EO 13780 (“Section 11”) instructs the \n7\n8 Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, to collect and make \n9 publicly available certain information regarding foreign nationals and terrorism. EO 13780, Sec. \n10\n11(a).   \n11\n36.

Report at \n2\n2.  This presentation of information runs contrary to EO 13780’s directive that Defendants \n3\npublish information regarding foreign nationals charged with or convicted of “terrorism-related \n4\noffenses” generally, not just international terrorism-related offenses.   \n5\n45.  Through their manipulation of data, Defendants artificially increased the proportion of \n6\nimmigrants and foreign nationals presented as responsible for terrorist incidents—without \n7\n8 making clear that the scope of the data is much narrower than what EO 13780 requires and \n9 without explaining how the presentation skews the terrorist threat actually posed to the United \n10\nStates.  As such, Defendants have disseminated information that lacks utility and is not objective. \n11\nThe Report provided misleading and biased information by substituting data concerning \n12 foreign-born individuals for data concerning foreign nationals. \n \n13 46.  Section 11 directed Defendants to provide various information related to “foreign \n14\nnationals” and terrorism-related offenses.  EO 13780, Sec. 11(a). \n15\n47.  The Report instead disseminates information regarding foreign-born individuals, rather \n16\nthan foreign nationals, stating that of at least 549 individuals who were convicted of international \n17\n(and only international) terrorism-related charges in U.S. federal courts between September 11, \n18\n2001, and December 31, 2016, “approximately 73 percent (402 of these 549 individuals) were \n19\n20 foreign-born.”  Report at 2.     \n21 48.  The Report does not provide any explanation for the substitution of foreign-born persons \n22\nfor foreign nationals, although doing so results in the misleading conclusion that nearly three-\n23\nquarters of individuals who were convicted of international terrorism-related charges were \n24\nimmigrants or non-citizens.  This conclusion is debunked by concrete data—the majority of \n25\n26\n27\n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 14 of 33\n \n1 jihadist terrorists, for example, since September 11 have been U.S. citizens.13  As another study \n2\nof terrorism concluded, native born citizens are responsible for the overwhelming majority of \n3\nterrorism fatalities since 2002.14   \n4\n49.  The Report further states that of these 549 individuals, 254 were not U.S. citizens, 148 \n5\nwere foreign-born, naturalized and received U.S. citizenship, and 147 were U.S. citizens by birth.  \n6\nReport at 2.  Had the Report followed EO 13780’s directive to report on foreign nationals, even \n7\n8 based on its own flawed data, it would have concluded that fewer than half, or 46 percent, of \n9 individuals charged or convicted of international terrorism-related offenses met this criterion. \n10\n50.  Responding to a request for information that purports to be about the terrorist threat that \n11\nforeign national immigrants pose to the United States by disseminating information that includes \n12\nnaturalized citizens perpetuates the Administration’s discriminatory view that only native-born \n13\nindividuals are actually American, and results in numbers that are artificially inflated.   \n14\n51.  Providing such misleading information is also contrary to effective counterterrorism \n15\n16 policy, which aims to prevent terrorism from sowing discord within a society. The Report’s focus \n17 on the country of an individual’s birth also ignores the essential question of where and why the \n18\nterrorist became radicalized.  As a group of counter-terrorism experts informed Defendants in \n19\nsupport of Plaintiff’s Petition, by ignoring the issue of domestic radicalization, Defendants made \n20\n21\n22\n                                                 \n23 13 Peter Bergen et al, Terrorism in America After 9/11: Part II. Who Are the Terrorists?, New \nAmerica, https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/terrorism-in-america/who-are-terrorists/ (last \n24\nvisited Mar. 27, 2019).  \n25 14 See Alex Nowrasteh, New Government Terrorism Report Provides Little Useful Information, \nCato Inst. (Jan. 16, 2018), https://www.cato.org/blog/new-government-terrorism-report-nearly-\n26\nworthless (“Since the beginning of 2002, native-born Americans were responsible for 78 percent \nof all murders in terrorist attacks committed on U.S. soil while foreign-born terrorists only \n27\ncommitted 22 percent.”). \n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 15 of 33\n \n1 “a deliberate choice not to help the public understand better the nature of radicalization and its \n2 role in terrorist activities on U.S. soil.”15 \n3\n52.  As such, in substituting foreign-born for foreign national, Defendants disseminated \n4\ninformation that does not have utility and is not objective.   \n5\n  The Report’s inclusion of individuals who committed terrorism overseas and whose \n6\nonly apparent tie to the United States is extradition to the United States for prosecution is \nmisleading. \n7\n \n8 53.  EO 13780 also directs Defendants to disseminate information regarding terrorist events \n9 that took place in the United States, specifically data about individuals who were charged with or \n10\nconvicted of terrorism-related offenses “while in the United States” or who have been removed \n11\nfrom the United States for various reasons.  EO 13780, Sec. 11(a)(i).   \n12\n54.  In response, the Report instead disseminates information about individuals who \n13\n“committed offenses while located abroad, including [those] who were transported to the United \n14\nStates for prosecution.”  Report at 2.   \n15\n16 55.  Although someone who has been extradited to the United States for trial may be charged \n17 and convicted while in the United States, the offenses committed by that person overseas do not \n18\nreveal the actual terror threat to the United States, nor could they serve to inform the United \n19\nStates’ immigration policy.  Including information about offenses that occurred overseas \n20\nmisleadingly inflates the number of foreign nationals Defendants can claim are responsible for \n21\nterrorism-related offenses, without having any bearing on terrorist threats that exist within the \n22\nUnited States, as Section 11 originally required.  Defendants provide no explanation for the \n23\n24 inclusion of this information. \n25\n                                                 \n26\n15 Letter from Joshua A. Geltzer et al., Inst. for Constitutional Advocacy and Prot., Georgetown \nUniv. Law Ctr., to Jefferson B. Sessions et al., U.S. Attorney Gen., at 6 (Sept. 13, 2018) \n27\n(attached hereto as “Attachment A”) (emphasis omitted).  \n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 16 of 33\n \n1 56.  The Report also fails to provide access to readily available and nonconfidential \n2\nunderlying aggregate data that would reveal the degree to which including overseas offenses \n3\nmisrepresents the nexus between foreign nationals and the risk of terrorism in the United \n4\nStates—namely the number of charges and convictions it counted for which the perpetrator’s \n5\nprimary connection to the United States was extradition for trial.   \n6\n57.  Defendants’ manipulation of data misleadingly inflates the threat posed by foreign \n7\n8 nationals.  As such, Defendants have disseminated information that lacks utility and is not \n9 objective. \n10\nThe Report’s examples of foreign nationals charged with or convicted of terrorism-related \noffenses are misleading and perpetuate the Administration’s discriminatory narrative that \n11\nMuslims are likely to commit acts of terrorism. \n12  \n58.  The Report disseminates eight purportedly “illustrative examples among the 402 \n13\nconvictions of foreign nationals or naturalized U.S. citizens.”  Report at 3-7.   \n14\n59.  Each of these profiles is of a man who appears to be Muslim, either because he is from a \n15\n16 Muslim-majority country or has a Muslim-sounding name or both.  \n17 60.  The individuals profiled arrived in the United States through the precise immigration \n18\nprovisions the Administration has maligned and sought to eliminate: refugee resettlement, \n19\nmigration preferences to support family reunification, and the visa diversity lottery.16    \n20\n21\n22\n                                                 \n23\n16 See Faiza Patel, Trump Administration’s Fuzzy Math on Terrorist Origins Is More than \n24\nMisleading -- It’s Dishonest, Just Security (Jan. 16, 2018), \n25 https://www.justsecurity.org/51084/trump-administrations-fuzzy-math-terrorist-origins-\nmisleading-its-dishonest/; see also Dan Merica & Tal Kopan, Trump Demands Congress \n26 Terminate Diversity Immigration Lottery, CNN (Nov. 1, 2017), \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/politics/donald-trump-chuck-schumer-nyc-attack/index.html \n27\n(detailing President Trump’s plans to reform the immigration system). \n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 17 of 33\n \n1 61.  Even though the underlying data—conviction records—is not confidential or otherwise \n2\ninaccessible, the Report provides no additional information or quantification for outside \n3\nobservers to test the Departments’ doubtful assertion that these examples are “illustrative.”   \n4\n62.  This presentation of information lacks utility and is not objective. \n5\nThe Report’s information relating to gender-based violence is misleading and perpetuates \n6\nanti-Muslim stereotypes. \n \n7\n63.  Subsection (a)(iii) of Section 11 instructs Defendants to provide information regarding \n8\nthe number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including so-called \n9\n“honor killings,” in the United States by foreign nationals.   \n10\n64.  The information provided by the Report, which purports to be responsive to this \n11\n12 directive, is inaccurate and misleading.  \n13 65.  The federal government has not “recorded and tracked in an aggregated statistical manner \n14\ninformation pertaining to gender-based violence against women committed at the federal and \n15\nstate level.”17  Nor does the federal government have reliable information regarding the \n16\nprevalence of so-called “honor killings.”  Defendants appear not to possess any quality \n17\ninformation that is responsive to the directive of subsection (iii). \n18\n66.  Instead, Defendants provide alternate data, which range from irrelevant to inaccurate.   \n19\n20 67.  The Report cites the average annual number of non-fatal domestic violence \n21 victimizations. Although that number is significant, the data does not reveal the proportion \n22\nperpetuated by foreign nationals.  Indeed, studies show that gender-based violence rates are \n23\n24\n25\n26\n                                                 \n27 17 Report at 7. \n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 18 of 33\n \n1 largely the same across all countries, a point which further casts doubt on the Report’s attempt to \n2 link gender-based violence and national origin.18 \n3\n68.  The Report also presents discredited data to perpetuate the stigmatization of Muslims \n4\ninherent in EO 13780’s implication that “honor killings” are a significant problem in the United \n5\nStates.  The Report asserts that “a study commissioned and provided to the DOJ’s Bureau of \n6\nJustice Statistics in 2014 estimated that an average of 23-27 honor killings occur every year in \n7\n8 the United States.”19   The author of the study has, in fact, disclaimed the accuracy of its \n9 conclusion, saying “it’s not terribly scientific,” a fact not disclosed by the Report.  Moreover, the \n10\nstudy cited was not commissioned by the Department of Justice, but by a private organization.20   \n11\n69.  Finally, the Report also cites a study regarding the number of women and girls who may \n12\nbe at risk for female genital mutilation, noting that the number was three times higher in 2012 \n13\nthan in 1990.21  The Report fails to explain that the study’s methodology simply correlates the \n14\nrisk of female genital mutilation in various countries to the number of women and girls living in \n15\n16 the United States who were born in that country or who lived with a parent born in that \n17 country.22  In short, the study simply tracks immigration rates, and explicitly does not present \n18\n                                                 \n19\n18 See, e.g., K.M.

As such, Defendants have disseminated information that lacks utility and is not objective. \n4\nThe Report’s role in the Administration’s larger campaign to target immigrant and Muslim \n5 communities. \n \n6\n71.  The Report’s misleading and biased presentation of the threat of violent extremism that \n7\nimmigrants, especially Muslim immigrants, pose to the United States is consistent with the views \n8\nof the President and Defendants.  \n9\n72.  During his campaign, then-candidate Trump infamously called for “a total and complete \n10\nshutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” stating further “[i]t is obvious to anybody that \n11\n12 the hatred is beyond comprehension. . . . [O]ur country cannot be the victims of horrendous \n13 attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human \n14\nlife.”  He later stated that “Islam hates us,” and that “[w]e can’t allow people coming into the \n15\ncountry who have this hatred.”23   \n16\n73.  After becoming President, President Trump re-tweeted anti-Muslim videos from a far-\n17\nright British activist, which were titled: “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!”; \n18\n“Muslim destroys a statue of Virgin Mary!”; and “Islamist mob pushes teenage boy off roof and \n19\n20 beats him to death!”24  The videos were misleading and drew wide condemnation, but the White \n21\n22\n                                                 \n23 23 Int’l Refugee Assistance Project v.

President Trump has also repeatedly argued, inaccurately, that immigrants pose a threat \n4\nto public safety.26  \n5\n75.  Similarly, former-Attorney General Sessions, who oversaw publication of the Report, \n6\nrelied on a single outlier study of questionable methodology to claim that, despite the vast body \n7\n8 of research showing that crime tends to decrease in areas where immigrants settle27, “illegal \n9 aliens are more than twice as likely to be convicted of crimes as Arizonans,” and that “[t]ens of \n10\nthousands of crimes have been committed in this country that would never have happened if our \n11\nimmigration laws were enforced and respected like they ought to be.”28 \n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n                                                                                                                                                             \n18\npolitics/wp/2017/11/29/trump-retweets-inflammatory-and-unverified-anti-muslim-\nvideos/?utm_term=.1a55596e88c1.  \n19\n25 Id. \n20\n26 Salvador Rizzo, Trump’s Claim That Immigrants Bring ‘Tremendous Crime’ Is Still Wrong, \n21 Wash.

And Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen has stated that even though the number of \n2\nunlawful entries to the United States was at historically low levels, still it “is an unacceptable \n3\nrisk to public safety and national security.”29 \n4\n77.  Consistent with these views, the Administration has used the Report to support its \n5\nattempts to restrict lawful immigration and its ongoing stigmatization of Muslims. \n6\n78.  For example, the White House issued a statement that the Report shows that “our current \n7\n8 immigration system jeopardizes American security” and used the Report to justify its calls to end \n9 the visa lottery and migration preferences to support family reunification.30 \n10\n79.  Similarly, former-Attorney General Sessions stated that the Report “reveals an \n11\nindisputable sobering reality—our immigration system has undermined our national security and \n12\npublic safety.”31   \n13\n80.  In her statement on the Report’s release, Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen said that it \n14\n“is a clear reminder of why we cannot continue to rely on immigration policy based on pre-9/11 \n15\n16 thinking that leaves us woefully vulnerable to foreign-born terrorists, and why we must examine \n17 our visa laws and continue to intensify screening and vetting of individuals traveling to the \n18\nUnited States to prevent terrorists, criminals, and other dangerous individuals from reaching our \n19\ncountry.”32  \n20\n21\n                                                 \n22\n29 Written Testimony of DHS Secretary Nielsen Before the U.S. Senate Committee on the \n23 Judiciary (Jan. 16, 2018), https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/01-16-\n18%20Nielsen%20Testimony.pdf. \n24\n30 Fact Sheet, White House, Our Current Immigration System Jeopardizes American Security \n25 (Jan. 16, 2018), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/current-immigration-system-\njeopardizes-american-security/. \n26\n31 DOJ Press Release, supra note 9. \n27 32 Id. \n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 22 of 33\n \n1 81.  She also warned the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Report was “just the tip of the \n2\niceberg” and repeated the conclusion that supposedly three-fourths of individuals convicted of \n3\ninternational terrorism in U.S. federal courts were foreign born in her testimony in January 2018 \n4\nas part of her justification for the travel ban against nationals of six Muslim-majority countries.33 \n5\nThe Report’s use in public discourse and its harmful effects on Muslim communities. \n6\n82.  The Report has also—and predictably—been widely used to promote anti-Muslim, anti-\n7\n8 immigrant rhetoric by commentators in the public sphere.  In the days following its publication, \n9 it was described in news outlets as “linking terrorism with our broken immigration system, full \n10\nof holes.”34  On one of the most-watched television news programs in the country,35 the host \n11\ndescribed the Report as showing that “America’s terror threat is clearly . . . an immigration \n12\n13\n14\n15                                                  \n16 33 Anna Giaritelli, DHS Chief: Foreign-born Have Made Up 3 in 4 of International Terrorism \nConvictions in US Courts Since Sept. 11 Attacks, Wash.

The damaging stigma the Report has caused is further amplified by an entirely \n4\nforeseeable mischaracterization of its findings.  The Report found (misleadingly) that 73 percent \n5\nof all individuals convicted of international terrorism-related offenses were foreign-born.  But \n6\nnumerous government officials and anti-immigrant outlets have stated that 73 percent of \n7\n8 individuals convicted of all terrorism-related offenses were foreign-born.  For example, \n9 President Trump tweeted on its release date that the report “shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals \n10\nconvicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born.”38  On the same day, then-House \n11\nJudiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte stated that “[o]f the 549 terror-related convictions since the \n12\n13\n14\n                                                 \n15\n36 Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Tucker Carlson Discuss Immigration – MGTOW, \n16\nYouTube (Jan. 18, 2018), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_244_Rf-Co (at 0:22). \n17 37 See, e.g., David Horowitz, Man up, DC!

By contributing to the stigmatization of Muslims, the Report is also likely to contribute to \n12\nincreases in associated hate speech and violence.  As many experts have noted, public rhetoric \n13\nand policies targeting a disfavored group correlate with increases in violence targeting those \n14\ngroups. 43  And in fact, multiple reports have found significant increases in hate incidents against \n15\n16\n                                                 \n17\n39 Press Release, H.R.

In the Petition, Plaintiff also explained that it is an “affected person” within the meaning \n2\nof the IQA and its implementing Guidelines because, among other reasons,  \n3\nMuslim Advocates works to ensure that policies enacted under the banner of \n4 national security do not wrongfully discriminate against Muslims and are not \nbased on inaccurate or misleading information.   \n5\nMuslim Advocates uses reliable information concerning the American \n6 immigration population in its work, and it, as well as its clients, is also “harmed” \nby the dissemination of the Report, which seeks to portray immigrants, and \n7\nparticularly Muslim immigrants, as inherently violent and likely to commit acts of \nterror.  Moreover, the Report serves as a mechanism to justify the travel and \n8\nrefugee bans, which the Administration has attempted to justify, at least in part, \n9 by reference to the kinds of inaccurate data and biased findings contained in the \nReport.  The Report serves as further post hoc justification for those efforts, \n10 which directly harm Muslim Advocates and its clients. \n11\n87.  The petition was sent via email and Federal Express.  The Federal Express deliveries \n12\narrived on January 30, 2018. \n13\n88.  Under both DOJ and DHS Guidelines, Defendants had 60 days to respond for a request \n14\nfor correction or to notify the requestor that additional time is needed.   \n15\n89.  As detailed below, Plaintiff did not receive even an acknowledgement letter from \n16\n17 Defendants until after the initial Complaint was filed in this case. \n18 Defendants’ Responses to Plaintiff’s Petition \n19\n90.  On June 15, 2018, after taking more than twice as much time as is permitted under its \n20\nIQA guidelines to respond, Defendant DOJ provided a letter acknowledging receipt.  DOJ \n21\nfurther stated that additional time was required to “review and provide any response” and noted \n22\nthat it anticipated doing so “within sixty (60) days of this letter.”  Att. C.  \n23\n91.  Defendant DHS followed suit with a nearly identical acknowledgment letter on June 19, \n24\n25 2018.  DHS likewise stated that an additional sixty (60) days was needed to review and provide a \n26\nresponse to the Petition.  Att. D. \n27\n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 27 of 33\n \n1 92.  DOJ provided its first substantive response to the Petition in a July 31, 2018 letter.  Att. \n2\nE.  This letter addressed briefly and inadequately the information quality errors set forth by \n3\nPlaintiff in the Petition. DOJ’s letter concluded that the agency’s IQA guidelines did not require \n4\nretraction or correction of the Report.  See id.  This conclusion was incorrect.  \n5\n93.  DHS provided a substantive response to the Petition on August 1, 2018.  See Att. F.  This \n6\nresponse’s analysis of the arguments set forth in the Petition was also incomplete and inadequate.  \n7\n8 The response did acknowledge that DHS planned to “refine the available data, provide more \n9 detail where practicable, and examine other datasets that might warrant release in the interest of \n10\ntransparency,” taking the points raised in the Petition into consideration during the preparation of \n11\nfuture Section 11 reports.  Id. at 2.  Despite this tacit admission of the Petition’s merit, DHS \n12\nconcluded that retraction or correction was not warranted.  Id.   \n13\n94.  Both the July 31 DOJ letter and the August 1 DHS letter provided notice of the \n14\nopportunity to appeal the final decisions to deny the Petition.   \n15\n16 Plaintiff’s Appeal Petitions \n17 95.  Muslim Advocates submitted administrative appeals to DOJ and DHS on September 13, \n18\n2018, requesting reconsideration of the agencies’ denials of Plaintiff’s Petition.  Atts. G, H \n19\n(collectively the “Appeal Petitions”). \n20\n96.  The Appeal Petitions explained that DOJ’s and DHS’s responses to the Petition were \n21\ninadequate and did not cure the information quality errors in the Report.  Among the reasons \n22\nprovided, the Appeal Petitions stated that:   \n23\n24 a.  The DOJ and DHS responses failed to engage meaningfully with the Petition’s arguments \n25\nthat the substitution of “foreign-born” for “foreign national” results in a biased and \n26\nmisleading presentation of the terrorist threat posed by immigrants, in violation of the \n27\n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 28 of 33\n \n1 IQA’s objectivity and utility requirements.  Further, the responses failed to articulate a \n2\nreason why there is utility in distinguishing between U.S.-born and foreign-born citizens, \n3\nwhich does not reveal meaningful differences in rights or responsibilities, and is not a \n4\ndistinction relied on by those who conduct counterterrorism work.  \n5\nb.  The decision to focus on international terrorism, and to ignore completely acts of \n6\ndomestic terrorism, is neither objective nor useful because the omission artificially \n7\n8 inflates the proportion of terrorist incidents presented as having been committed by \n9 foreign nationals and ignores a critical component of the counterterrorism discussion.  In \n10\ntheir defense of the Report, Defendants asserted that data capturing instances of domestic \n11\nterrorism were not available to them, and that the Report was sufficiently clear about the \n12\npresentation of information.  As the Appeal Petitions point out, however, such \n13\ninformation has been compiled by the government, including in the reports and studies \n14\ncited by Plaintiff, and so was readily available for Defendants in order to consider the \n15\n16 threat posed by domestic terrorism and thereby provide objective and useful information \n17 to the public.   \n18\nc.  Defendants also failed to respond adequately to the Petition’s argument that the Report’s \n19\ninclusion of individuals who were only present in the United States because they were \n20\nbrought here through extradition in the total number of terrorism-related convictions \n21\nmisleadingly inflates the terrorist threat posed by foreign nationals.  The responses’ \n22\nassertion that these individuals were accurately described as having come to the United \n23\n24 States through extradition did not account for the misleading and useless presentation of \n25\nthe information.  Moreover, Defendants inexplicably failed to provide underlying data, in \n26\n27\n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 29 of 33\n \n1 their possession, showing what percentage of the total number of individuals identified in \n2\nthe Report were included based on their extradition to the United States. \n3\nd.  Defendants’ attempts to justify the Report’s profiling of eight “illustrative examples,” all \n4\nof which appear to be Muslim men who arrived in the United States through the precise \n5\nimmigration provisions the Administration has sought to eliminate, were unpersuasive.  \n6\nPlaintiffs’ criticism is not “subjective,” as asserted by Defendants, but based in the \n7\n8 objectivity and utility requirements of the IQA.  Compounding this problem, the Report \n9 had failed to include any of the underlying data that might have allowed an outside \n10\nobserve to test whether these eight examples were, in any sense, illustrative, an omission \n11\nthe responses further failed to explain or discuss.   \n12\ne.  Finally, Defendants failed to address adequately the misleading and anti-Muslim \n13\ninformation disseminated concerning so-called “honor killings,” which the Report \n14\nportrays as a substantial issue in the United States, in part by relying on irrelevant and \n15\n16 inaccurate data.  The DHS and DOJ responses did not address specifically the Report’s \n17 inclusion of discredited and irrelevant data sources.  The responses further asserted that \n18\nthe Report noted the lack of aggregate data discussing “honor violence” and that this \n19\ntransparency was sufficient.  But none of these defenses save the Report, which fails to \n20\nmeet the IQA’s objectivity requirement.        \n21\n97.  The Appeal Petitions also emphasized the ways in which the Administration—both \n22\nPresident Trump and Defendants—has used the Report to further stigmatize immigrants as \n23\n24 dangerous and likely to be terrorists; important context for understanding the Report’s bias.   \n25\n98.  Contemporaneously with the submission of the Appeal Petitions, a group of former \n26\nofficials with extensive counter terrorism experiences submitted a letter to Defendants in support \n27\n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 30 of 33\n \n1 of Plaintiff’s appeals.  See Att. A.  This letter reinforced many of the arguments made by \n2\nPlaintiff and further explained how continued dissemination of the Report can inflict damage on \n3\nvital counterterrorism efforts.  Id. at 3.  As the authors of the letter stated, “[a]llowing \n4\nmisunderstandings to continue to circulate would undermine the objectives of effective \n5\ncounterterrorism policy and exacerbate the fear and division that terrorists seek to create.”  Id. \n6\nDefendants’ Responses to the Appeal Petitions \n7\n8 99.  DOJ did not acknowledge receipt of the administrative appeal until October 24, 2018, \n9 and offered no substantive response at that time, asserting instead that it would take an additional \n10\nforty-five (45) days to review and provide a further response.  Att. I. \n11\n100.  DOJ responded substantively to the Appeal Petition by letter dated December 21, 2018.  \n12\nIn this response, DOJ admitted that Plaintiff had raised valid concerns about the quality of the \n13\ninformation presented in the Report.  Specifically, DOJ stated that \n14\n[T]he Department concludes on reconsideration that information in the Report could be \n15\ncriticized by some readers, consistent with some of the concerns voiced in your Request \n16 for Reconsideration. … Working closely with DHS, the Department will consider IQA \nprinciples in issuing future reports under Section 11 of Executive Order 13780 to better \n17 present such information to the public. \n \n18\nSee Att. J at 1 (emphasis added).   \n19\n101.  Despite this admission, DOJ declined to retract or correct the Report. The justification it \n20\nprovided for doing so is inadequate and incorrect in light of the information submitted in support \n21\nof the request for retraction.  \n22\n102.  DHS was even tardier in its response to the administrative appeal, acknowledging receipt \n23\n24 on November 7, 2018, and stating that it would take an additional 45 days to review and consider \n25\nits response.  Att. K.  On December 19, 2018, DHS again informed Plaintiff that it would take an \n26\n27\n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 31 of 33\n \n1 additional 45 days to respond.  Att. L.  On January 31, 2019, DHS again stated by letter that it \n2 would take an additional 45 days to respond.  Att. M.46  \n3\n103.  Finally, on February 14, 2019—155 days since the Plaintiff submitted its administrative \n4\nappeal—DHS provided a substantive response.  Att. N.  \n5\n104.  DHS acknowledged the validity of Plaintiff’s information quality concerns, stating, “it \n6\nwill take into consideration in future Section 11 Reports those points raised in both your \n7\n8 Requests for Correction and Reconsideration.”  Id. at 1.  Further, DHS admitted that Plaintiff’s \n9 contention regarding the bias in the selection of the eight illustrative examples “is well-taken.” \n10\nId. at 2. \n11\n105.  Nevertheless, DHS declined to retract or correct the Report.  Id.  The justification it \n12\nprovided for doing so is inadequate and incorrect in light of the information submitted in support \n13\nof the request for retraction. \n14\n106.  Defendants continue to promulgate the Report on their respective websites.   \n15\n16 Claim for Relief: Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n17 107.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates all allegations in the above paragraphs as if fully set forth \n18\nherein. \n19\n108.  The IQA, OMB’s IQA Guidelines, and DOJ and DHS’s IQA Guidelines require that \n20\ninformation disseminated by agencies meet a requisite level of quality.   \n21\n109.  The Report is information disseminated by Defendants within the meaning of the IQA \n22\nand its implementing Guidelines.   \n23\n24 110.  The Report fails the objectivity and utility requirements of information quality; instead, it \n25\npresents information in a deceptive, misleading, and incomplete manner, and in so doing, \n26                                                  \n27 46 This delay was apparently attributable to the lapse in appropriations. \n28 First Amended Complaint         Case No:18-cv-02137-JSC \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 37   Filed 04/01/19   Page 32 of 33\n \n1 misrepresents the actual terror threat to the country, artificially inflating the threat that \n2\nimmigrants and Muslims pose to the United States. \n3\n111.  Defendants’ ongoing dissemination of the Report following their denials of Plaintiffs’ \n4\nPetition and Appeal Petitions violates the IQA and its implementing Guidelines, and is therefore \n5\narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with law, without observance of \n6\nprocedure required by law, and otherwise violative of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n7\n8 Prayer for Relief \n9 WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that this Court grant the following relief: \n10\n1.  Declare that the Report disseminates information that fails the standard of quality \n11\nrequired of federal agencies; \n12\n2.  Declare that Defendants violated the IQA, its implementing Guidelines, and the APA; \n13\n3.  Order Defendants to expressly retract or correct the Report and to cease dissemination of \n14\nthe Report; \n15\n16 4.  Award Plaintiff its costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and other disbursements incurred in \n17 this action; and  \n18\n5.  Grant such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \n19\nDate: April 1, 2019        Respectfully submitted, \n20  \n            /s/ Robin F. Thurston_______________ \n21 Robin F.

President Trump campaigned on the promise of a “total and complete shutdown of \n7 \n8  Muslims entering the United States.”  Since taking office, he has sought to fulfill this overtly \n9  discriminatory pledge by enacting three successive bans on nationals of several Muslim-majority \n10 \ncountries and a series of policies aimed at slowing the entry of refugees, particularly from \n11 \nMuslim-majority countries, into the United States.  He has also sought to reduce other \n12 \nlongstanding paths to lawful immigration.   \n13 \n2.  As part of this anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant agenda, the President and members of his \n14 \nAdministration regularly overstate and misrepresent the threat that immigrants, especially \n15 \n16  Muslim immigrants, pose to the United States. This bias infects a report recently published by \n17  Defendants, the Executive Order 13780: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into \n18 \nthe United States Initial Section 11 Report (the “Report”).  \n19 \n3.  Executive Order 13780, which required publication of the Report, incorporated President \n20 \nTrump’s second attempt at a travel ban, and directed Defendants, in order to be “more \n21 \ntransparent with the American people and to implement more effective policies and practices that \n22 \nserve the national interest,” to compile and disseminate information that purports to link \n23 \n24  terrorism to immigration. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  2 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 3 of 26\n \n1  4.  The Report presents information on immigrants and foreign nationals in a manner that \n2 \nmisleadingly inflates the threat they pose to the United States.  Its presentation of this \n3 \ninformation also focuses exclusively and inaccurately on Muslims. \n4 \n5.  Among the ways the Report manipulates information to support its anti-immigrant and \n5 \nanti-Muslim conclusions: it ignores domestic terrorism incidents; it departs from the directive of \n6 \nEO 13780 and analyzes terrorism incidents involving foreign-born Americans rather than foreign \n7 \n8  nationals; it includes individuals who committed terrorism acts overseas and whose only tie to \n9  the United States is their extradition for prosecution; and it relies on irrelevant and debunked \n10 \nstudies in providing information regarding so-called “honor killings” and violence against \n11 \nwomen. \n12 \n6.  In so doing, the Report perpetuates the ongoing stigmatization of immigrants and \n13 \nMuslims by the Administration.  For example, the Trump Administration has used the Report to \n14 \njustify its sweeping ban on the entry of nationals from six Muslim-majority countries into the \n15 \n16  United States. It has also specifically tied the Report’s findings to its calls for an end to the \n17  issuance of diversity and family reunification visas, which would have a significant negative \n18 \nimpact on Muslim immigrants. \n19 \n7.  The Report has been used explicitly to stoke anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment \n20 \nand is likely to continue to be used in this manner. It therefore not only contributes on its face to \n21 \ntheir stigmatization, but it is also likely to contribute to increasing hate violence against these \n22 \ncommunities. \n23 \n24  8.  Muslim Advocates sought a retraction and correction of the Report because its \n25 \npresentation of information does not meet the level of quality required of federal agencies by the \n26 \nIQA and its implementing Guidelines.  Defendants have failed to comply with their obligation to \n27 \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  3 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 4 of 26\n \n1  respond to this request for retraction, and accordingly, Plaintiff seeks judicial relief pursuant to \n2 \nthe APA. \n3 \nParties \n4 \n9.  Muslim Advocates is a civil rights organization that promotes freedom and justice for \n5 \nAmericans of all faiths, with a particular focus on issues impacting Muslim communities.  \n6 \nMuslim Advocates engages in civil rights litigation, policy advocacy, and public education to \n7 \n8  fight inaccurate stereotypes about Muslims and other immigrants.  In particular, Muslim \n9  Advocates works to ensure that policies enacted under the banner of national security do not \n10 \nwrongfully discriminate against Muslims and are not based on inaccurate or misleading \n11 \ninformation.  Muslim Advocates’ headquarters are in Oakland, California.   \n12 \n10.  The Department of Justice is a federal agency.  Along with the Department of \n13 \nHomeland Security, it disseminated the Report. \n14 \n11.  The Department of Homeland Security is a federal agency.  Along with the \n15 \n16  Department of Justice, it disseminated the Report.   \n17  Jurisdiction, Venue, and Intradistrict Assignment \n18 \n12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \n19 \nbecause this action arises under federal law, specifically the Information Quality Act, 44 U.S.C. \n20 \n§ 3516 note (“IQA”), and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. (“APA”). \n21 \n13.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), because Plaintiff resides \n22 \nin this district.   \n23 \n24  14.  Plaintiff resides in Alameda County, making assignment to the Oakland Division \n25 \nappropriate pursuant to Local Civil Rule 3-2(c), (d). \n26 \n27 \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  4 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 5 of 26\n \n1  The Information Quality Act \n2 \n15.  The IQA, together with its implementing Guidelines, requires that information \n3 \ndisseminated to the public by federal agencies, including by DHS and DOJ, be of requisite \n4 \nquality, objectivity, utility, and integrity.1 \n5 \n16.  The IQA, an addendum to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq. \n6 \n(“PRA”), directs the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) to issue guidelines under \n7 \n8  various PRA authorities by September 30, 2001. \n9  17.  The IQA provides that the guidelines issued by OMB should require each federal agency \n10 \nto which they apply to, in turn: \n11 \n(A) issue guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and \n12  integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by the \nagency, by not later than 1 year after the date of issuance of the guidelines under \n13  subsection (a); [and] \n14 \n(B) establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and \nobtain correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that \n15 \ndoes not comply with the guidelines issued under subsection (a). \n16 \n44 U.S.C. § 3516 note (B)(2). \n17   \n18.  OMB issued “final guidelines”, as directed, after a period of notice and comment, in \n18 \n2002.2 \n19 \n19.  In issuing its Guidelines, OMB explained, “[g]iven the administrative mechanisms \n20 \n21  required by [the IQA] as well as the standards set forth in the Paperwork Reduction Act, it is \n22 \n23                                                  \n24  1 Consolidated Appropriations—FY 2001, Pub. L. No. 106-554, § 515, 114 Stat. 2763, 2763A-\n153, 154 (2000) (codified at 44 U.S.C. § 3516 note). \n25 \n2 Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Guidelines for Ensuring and \n26  Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by \nFederal Agencies (“OMB Guidelines”), 67 Fed. Reg. 8451, 8452 (Feb. 22, 2002), \n27 \nhttps://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2002-02-22/pdf/R2-59.pdf. \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  5 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 6 of 26\n \n1  clear that agencies should not disseminate substantive information that does not meet a basic \n2 \nlevel of quality.”  67 Fed. Reg. at 8452.   \n3 \n20.  The OMB Guidelines elaborate on the directives set forth in the IQA itself.  They define \n4 \n“quality”, “utility”, “objectivity,” and “integrity”, among other relevant terms.  These definitions \n5 \nstate, in part: \n6 \n“Quality” is an encompassing term comprising utility, objectivity, and integrity. \n7 \n“Utility” refers to the usefulness of the information to its intended users, including \n8 \nthe public. In assessing the usefulness of information that the agency disseminates \n9  to the public, the agency needs to consider the uses of the information not only \nfrom the perspective of the agency but also from the perspective of the public. As \n10  a result, when transparency of information is relevant for assessing the \ninformation’s usefulness from the public's perspective, the agency must take care \n11 \nto ensure that transparency has been addressed in its review of the information. … \n12 \n“Objectivity” includes whether disseminated information is being presented in an \n13  accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner. This involves whether the \ninformation is presented within a proper context. Sometimes, in disseminating \n14  certain types of information to the public, other information must also be \ndisseminated in order to ensure an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased \n15 \npresentation.  \n16 \n21.   The OMB Guidelines also require agencies to “establish administrative mechanisms \n17 \nallowing affected persons to seek and obtain, where appropriate, timely correction of information \n18 \nmaintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with OMB or agency \n19 \nguidelines.”  Id. at 8459. \n20 \n21  22.  Defendants have each promulgated guidelines applicable to themselves. \n22  23.  The DOJ Guidelines set forth definitions of “utility”, “objectivity”, and “integrity”, which \n23 \n“apply, consistent with the OMB Guidelines (paragraph V, definitions) which will also apply.”3 \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n3 U.S. DOJ, Information Quality: Ensuring the Quality of the Information Disseminated by the \nDepartment (“DOJ Guidelines”), https://www.justice.gov/iqpr/information-quality (last updated \n26 \nNov. 1, 2016). \n27 \n \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  6 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 7 of 26\n \n1  24.  The DOJ Guidelines also set forth a process for submitting a formal request for \n2 \ncorrection, including a description of the information that requests for correction should include, \n3 \nand a statement that the requester bears the burden of proof in seeking a correction.   \n4 \n25.  The DOJ Guidelines state that:  \n5 \nBased on the explanation and evidence submitted with the request for correction, \n6 \na DOJ official who is knowledgeable of the subject matter will conduct a \nthorough review of the information being challenged, the processes that were used \n7 \nto create and disseminate the information, and the conformity of the information \n8  and those processes with both OMB’s and DOJ’s Information Quality Guidelines.  \nAfter it has completed its review, DOJ will determine whether a correction is \n9  warranted, and, if so, what corrective action it will take. … After the responsible \nDOJ component has made its final determination pertaining to a request for \n10 \ncorrection of information, it will respond to the requestor by letter, e-mail, or fax.  \nThe response will explain the findings and the actions to be taken (if any) in \n11 \nresponse to the complaint.   \n12 \n26.  DOJ Guidelines state that normally the agency will respond to a request for correction \n13 \nwithin sixty calendar days of receipt, or will inform the requestor of any additional time needed \n14 \nto resolve the request, the reason why, and an estimated decision date. \n15 \n27.  The DHS Guidelines, which are based on the OMB Guidelines, also state that the three \n16 \n17  underlying requirements for quality information are utility, objectivity, and integrity of \n18 \ninformation, and set forth accompanying definitions.4   \n19 \n28.  The DHS Guidelines also provide for an administrative information correction process, \n20 \nwhereby “affected persons can seek, and obtain, where appropriate, timely correction of \n21 \ninformation that does not comply with OMB Guidelines, DHS Guidelines, or [DHS] Component \n22 \nstandards.”5   \n23 \n24 \n                                                \n25  4 U.S. Dep’t Homeland Security, Information Quality Guidelines (last visited Jan. 18, 2018), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/dhs-iq-guidelines-fy2011.pdf (“DHS \n26 \nGuidelines”) at 2-5. \n27  5 Id. at 6. \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  7 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 8 of 26\n \n1  29.

President Trump signed Executive Order 13780, Protecting the Nation from Foreign \n6 \nTerrorist Entry into the United States (“EO 13780”) on March 6, 2017. \n7 \n8  31.  EO 13780 significantly restricts entry to the United States by individuals from six \n9  Muslim-majority countries.  The travel restrictions imposed by EO 13780 and its predecessor \n10 \nand successor Executive Order and Proclamation6 are the subject of widespread and ongoing \n11 \nlitigation.  Numerous individuals and organizations sued to challenge the legality of parts of the \n12 \nOrders and Proclamation, obtaining injunctions against their restrictions on travel. \n13 \n32.  In addition to the travel restrictions, Section 11 of EO 13780 (“Section 11”) contains an \n14 \ninstruction to the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, to \n15 \n16  collect and make publicly available certain information regarding foreign nationals and \n17  terrorism. EO 13780, Sec. 11(a).  This Section has not been the subject of litigation.   \n18 \n33.  Section 11 requires in pertinent part that “[t]o be more transparent with the American \n19 \npeople and to implement more effectively policies and practices that serve the national interest, \n20 \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent \n21 \nwith applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available the following \n22 \ninformation: \n23 \n24 \n25                                                  \n26  6 Exec.

EO 13780, Sec. \n17 \n11(b).   \n18 \n35.  On January 16, 2018, DOJ and DHS released a report titled: “Executive Order 13780: \n19 \nProtecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States Initial Section 11 \n20 \nReport”7, which is the initial report required by Section 11, and which purports to provide \n21 \n22  information responsive to the four categories of information that Section 11 requires be made \n23  available.  Report at 1.   \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n7 U.S. DHS & U.S. DOJ, Executive Order 13780: Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist \n26  Entry into the United States Initial Section 11 Report (the “Report”) (Jan. 2018), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Executive%20Order% \n27 \n2013780%20Section%2011%20Report%20-%20Final.pdf. \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  9 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 10 of 26\n \n1  36.  The Report sets forth various information in response to the four subsections identified \n2 \nby Section 11, including the misleading conclusion that three out of four individuals convicted of \n3 \ninternational terrorism and terrorism-related offenses were foreign-born.     \n4 \n37.  Defendants issued the Report with accompanying press releases highlighting the “three \n5 \nout of four” conclusion and have disseminated the Report to the public on their respective \n6 \nwebpages.8   \n7 \n8  38.  Despite the Administration’s ongoing dissemination of the Report, the information in the \n9  Report is biased, misleading, and incomplete.  It violates OMB’s IQA Guidelines, lacking utility \n10 \nand objectivity, and Defendants’ respective IQA Guidelines, as set forth in detail, below.   \n11 \nThe Report’s substitution of international terrorism for all terrorism misleadingly \n12  undercounts domestic terrorism, and artificially inflates the proportion of terrorist incidents \ncommitted by immigrants and foreign nationals. \n13   \n39.  The government’s own studies show that native born citizens commit significant numbers \n14 \nof terrorist attacks in the United States, and indeed are responsible for the overwhelming \n15 \n16  majority of terrorism fatalities since 2002.9  An April 2017 Government Accountability Office \n17  report concluded that “of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since \n18 \nSeptember 12, 2001, far right wing violent extremist groups were responsible for 62 (73 percent) \n19                                                  \n20  8 Press Release, U.S. DHS, DHS, DOJ Report: Three Out of Four Individuals Convicted of \nInternational Terrorism and Terrorism-Related Offenses Were Foreign-Born (“DHS Press \n21 \nRelease”) (Jan. 16, 2018), https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/01/16/dhs-doj-report-three-out-four-\nindividuals-convicted-international-terrorism-and; Press Release, U.S. DOJ, DOJ, DHS Report: \n22 \nThree Out of Four Individuals Convicted of International Terrorism and Terrorism-Related \n23  Offenses Were Foreign-Born (“DOJ Press Release”) (Jan. 16, 2018), \nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/doj-dhs-report-three-out-four-individuals-convicted-\n24  international-terrorism-and-terrorism. \n9 See Alex Nowrasteh, New Government Terrorism Report Provides Little Useful Information, \n25 \nCato Inst.

Despite the prevalence of serious domestic terrorist threats, particularly the threat posed \n9  by far-right wing violent extremist groups, the Report, which purports to address all terrorism-\n10 \nrelated offenses, only provides data related to international terrorism-related offenses.  Report at \n11 \n2.  This presentation of information runs contrary to EO 13780’s directive that Defendants \n12 \npublish information regarding foreign nationals charged with or convicted of “terrorism-related \n13 \noffenses” generally, not just international terrorism-related offenses.  Through their manipulation \n14 \nof data, Defendants have been able to artificially increase the proportion of immigrants and \n15 \n16  foreign nationals presented as responsible for terrorist incidents—without making clear that the \n17  scope of the data is much narrower than what EO 13780 requires.   \n18 \n41.   The Report’s conclusions were drawn from data regarding only international terrorism-\n19 \nrelated offenses, specifically: “public convictions in federal courts between September 11, 2001, \n20 \nand December 31, 2016 resulting from international terrorism investigations, including \n21 \n                                                \n22 \n10 See U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, Countering Violent Extremism: Actions Needed to \n23  Define Strategy and Assess Progress of Federal Efforts 4 (Apr. 2017), \nhttp://www.gao.gov/assets/690/683984.pdf. \n24 \n11 See FBI & DHS Joint Intelligence Bulletin, White Supremacist Extremism Poses Persistent \nThreat of Lethal Violence 4 (May 10, 2017), available at \n25 \nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3924852-White-Supremacist-Extremism-JIB.html; \n26  see also Jana Winter, FBI and DHS Warned of Growing Threat from White Supremacists Months \nAgo, Foreign Policy (Aug. 14, 2017), http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/14/fbi-and-dhs-warned-\n27 \nof-growing-threat-from-white-supremacists-months-ago/ (citing the Joint Intelligence Bulletin).  \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  11 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 12 of 26\n \n1  investigations of terrorist acts planned or committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the \n2 \nUnited States over which Federal criminal jurisdiction exists and those within the United States \n3 \ninvolving international terrorists and terrorist groups.” Report at 2.   \n4 \n42.  Defendants omitted data related to domestic terrorism without explanation.   \n5 \n43.  The Report categorically excludes all terrorism-related offenses that occurred in the \n6 \nUnited States which were planned and executed by individuals without international connections.  \n7 \n8  This exclusion dramatically misrepresents the actual terrorist threat posed by immigrants and \n9  foreign nationals in the United States.  By presenting data that omits completely information \n10 \nabout the documented threat posed by domestic terrorists without international ties, and framing \n11 \nit as responsive to the directive to provide data regarding all terrorism-related offenses, \n12 \nDefendants have disseminated information that lacks utility and is not objective. \n13 \nThe Report provides misleading and biased information by substituting data concerning \n14 \nforeign-born individuals for data concerning foreign nationals. \n \n15 \n44.  Section 11 directed Defendants to provide various information related to “foreign \n16 \nnationals” and terrorism-related offenses.  EO 13780, Sec. 11(a). \n17 \n45.  The Report instead disseminates information regarding foreign-born individuals, rather \n18 \nthan foreign nationals, stating that of at least 549 individuals who were convicted of international \n19 \n20  (and only international) terrorism-related charges in U.S. federal courts between September 11, \n21  2001, and December 31, 2016, “approximately 73 percent (402 of these 549 individuals) were \n22 \nforeign-born.”  Report at 2.     \n23 \n46.  The Report does not provide any explanation for the substitution of foreign-born persons \n24 \nfor foreign nationals, although doing so results in the inaccurate conclusion that nearly three-\n25 \nquarters of individuals who were convicted of international terrorism-related charges were \n26 \nimmigrants or non-citizens.  \n27 \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  12 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 13 of 26\n \n1  47.  The Report further states that of these 549 individuals, 254 were not U.S. citizens, 148 \n2 \nwere foreign-born, naturalized and received U.S. citizenship, and 147 were U.S. citizens by birth.  \n3 \nReport at 2.  Had the Report followed EO 13780’s directive to report on foreign nationals, even \n4 \nbased on its own flawed data, it would have concluded that fewer than half, or 46 percent, of \n5 \nindividuals charged or convicted of international terrorism-related offenses met this criterion. \n6 \n48.  Responding to a request for information that purports to be about the terrorist threat that \n7 \n8  foreign national immigrants pose to the United States by disseminating information that includes \n9  naturalized citizens perpetuates the Administration’s discriminatory view that only native-born \n10 \nindividuals are actually American, and results in numbers that are artificially inflated.  As such, \n11 \nin substituting foreign-born for foreign national, Defendants disseminated information that does \n12 \nnot have utility and is not objective.   \n13 \n  The Report’s inclusion of individuals who committed terrorism overseas and whose \n14 \nonly apparent tie to the United States is extradition to the United States for prosecution is \nmisleading. \n15 \n \n16  49.  EO 13780 also directs Defendants to disseminate information regarding terrorist events \n17  that took place in the United States, specifically data about individuals who were charged with or \n18 \nconvicted of terrorism-related offenses “while in the United States” or who have been removed \n19 \nfrom the United States for various reasons.   EO 13780, Sec. 11(a)(i).   \n20 \n50.  In response, the Report instead disseminates information about individuals who \n21 \n“committed offenses while located abroad, including [those] who were transported to the United \n22 \nStates for prosecution.”  Report at 2.   \n23 \n24  51.  Although someone who has been extradited to the United States for trial may be charged \n25 \nand convicted while in the United States, the offenses committed by that person overseas do not \n26 \nnecessarily reveal the actual terror threat to the United States, nor could they serve to inform the \n27 \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  13 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 14 of 26\n \n1  United States’ immigration policy.  Including information about offenses that occurred overseas \n2 \nmisleadingly inflates the number of foreign nationals Defendants can claim are responsible for \n3 \nterrorism-related offenses, without having any bearing on terrorist threats that exist within the \n4 \nUnited States, as Section 11 originally required.  Defendants provide no explanation for the \n5 \ninclusion of this information. \n6 \n52.  The Report also fails to provide access to readily available and nonconfidential \n7 \n8  underlying aggregate data that would reveal the degree to which including overseas offenses \n9  misrepresents the nexus between foreign nationals and the risk of terrorism in the United \n10 \nStates—namely the number of charges and convictions it counted for which the perpetrator’s \n11 \nprimary connection to the United States was extradition for trial.   \n12 \n53.  Defendants’ manipulation of data misleadingly inflates the threat posed by foreign \n13 \nnationals.   \n14 \nThe Report’s examples of foreign nationals charged with or convicted of terrorism-related \n15 \noffenses are misleading and perpetuate the Administration’s discriminatory narrative that \n16  Muslims are likely to commit acts of terrorism. \n \n17  54.  The Report disseminates eight purportedly “illustrative examples among the 402 \n18 \nconvictions of foreign nationals or naturalized U.S. citizens.”  Report at 3-7.   \n19 \n55.  Each of these profiles is of a man who appears to be Muslim, either because he is from a \n20 \nMuslim-majority country or has a Muslim-sounding name or both.  \n21 \n56.  The individuals profiled arrived in the United States through the precise immigration \n22 \nprovisions the Administration has maligned and sought to eliminate: refugee resettlement, \n23 \n24  migration preferences to support family reunification, and the visa diversity lottery.12    \n25 \n                                                \n26 \n12 See Faiza Patel, Trump Administration’s Fuzzy Math on Terrorist Origins Is More than \nMisleading -- It’s Dishonest, Just Security (Jan. 16, 2018), \n27 \nhttps://www.justsecurity.org/51084/trump-administrations-fuzzy-math-terrorist-origins-\n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  14 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 15 of 26\n \n1  57.  Even though the underlying data—conviction records—is not confidential or otherwise \n2 \ninaccessible, the Report provides no additional information or quantification for outside \n3 \nobservers to test the Departments’ doubtful assertion that these examples are “illustrative.”   \n4 \nThe Report’s information relating to gender-based violence is misleading and perpetuates \n5  anti-Muslim stereotypes. \n \n6 \n58.  Subsection (a)(iii) of Section 11 instructs Defendants to provide information regarding \n7 \nthe number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including so-called \n8 \n“honor killings,” in the United States by foreign nationals.   \n9 \n59.  The information provided by the Report, which purports to be responsive to this \n10 \ndirective, is inaccurate and misleading.  \n11 \n12  60.  The federal government has not “recorded and tracked in an aggregated statistical manner \n13  information pertaining to gender-based violence against women committed at the federal and \n14 \nstate level.”13  Nor does the federal government have reliable information regarding the \n15 \nprevalence of so-called “honor killings.”  Defendants appear not to possess any quality \n16 \ninformation that is responsive to the directive of subsection (iii). \n17 \n61.  Instead, Defendants provide alternate data, which range from irrelevant to inaccurate.   \n18 \n62.  The Report cites the average annual number of non-fatal domestic violence \n19 \n20  victimizations. Although that number is significant, the data does not reveal the proportion \n21  perpetuated by foreign nationals.  Indeed, studies show that gender-based violence rates are \n22 \n23 \n                                                                                                                                                       \n24 \nmisleading-its-dishonest/; see also Dan Merica & Tal Kopan, Trump Demands Congress \n25 \nTerminate Diversity Immigration Lottery, CNN (Nov. 1, 2017), \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/11/01/politics/donald-trump-chuck-schumer-nyc-attack/index.html \n26 \n(detailing President Trump’s plans to reform the immigration system). \n27 \n13 Report at 7. \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  15 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 16 of 26\n \n1  largely the same across all countries, a point which further casts doubt on the Report’s attempt to \n2  link gender-based violence and national origin.14 \n3 \n63.  The Report also presents discredited data to perpetuate the stigmatization of Muslims \n4 \ninherent in EO 13780’s implication that “honor killings” are a significant problem in the United \n5 \nStates.  The Report asserts that “a study commissioned and provided to the DOJ’s Bureau of \n6 \nJustice Statistics in 2014 estimated that an average of 23-27 honor killings occur every year in \n7 \n8  the United States.”15   The author of the study has, in fact, disclaimed the accuracy of its \n9  conclusion, saying “it’s not terribly scientific,” a fact not disclosed by the Report.  Moreover, the \n10 \nstudy cited was not commissioned by the Department of Justice, but by a private organization.16   \n11 \n64.  Finally, the Report also cites a study regarding the number of women and girls who may \n12 \nbe at risk for female genital mutilation, noting that the number was three times higher in 2012 \n13 \nthan in 1990.17  The Report fails to explain that the study’s methodology simply correlates the \n14 \nrisk of female genital mutilation in various countries to the number of women and girls living in \n15 \n16  the United States who were born in that country or who lived with a parent born in that \n17  country.18  In short, the study simply tracks immigration rates, and explicitly does not present \n18 \n                                                \n19 \n14 See, e.g., K.M.

The Report’s misleading and biased presentation of the threat of violent extremism that \n6 \nimmigrants, especially Muslim immigrants, pose to the United States is consistent with the views \n7 \nof the President and Defendants.  \n8 \n66.  During his campaign, then-candidate Trump infamously called for “a total and complete \n9 \nshutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” stating further “[i]t is obvious to anybody that \n10 \nthe hatred is beyond comprehension. . . . [O]ur country cannot be the victims of horrendous \n11 \n12  attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human \n13  life.”  He later stated that “Islam hates us,” and that “[w]e can’t allow people coming into the \n14 \ncountry who have this hatred.”19   \n15 \n67.  The Fourth Circuit later relied on these and other statements in concluding that there is a \n16 \ncompelling case that EO 13780’s primary purpose was to target Muslims, noting that “[t]hen-\n17 \ncandidate Trump’s campaign statements reveal that on numerous occasions, he expressed anti-\n18 \nMuslim sentiment, as well as his intent, if elected, to ban Muslims from the United States.”20   \n19 \n20  68.  After becoming President, President Trump re-tweeted anti-Muslim videos from a far-\n21  right British activist, which were titled: “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!”; \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n19 Int’l Refugee Assistance Project v.

President Trump has also repeatedly argued, inaccurately, that immigrants pose a threat \n6 \nto public safety.23  \n7 \n8  70.  Similarly, Attorney General Sessions recently relied on a single outlier study of \n9  questionable methodology to claim that, despite the vast body of research showing that crime \n10 \ntends to decrease in areas where immigrants settle24, “illegal aliens are more than twice as likely \n11 \nto be convicted of crimes as Arizonans,” and that “[t]ens of thousands of crimes have been \n12 \ncommitted in this country that would never have happened if our immigration laws were \n13 \nenforced and respected like they ought to be.”25 \n14 \n15 \n16                                                  \n17  21 Ashley Parker & John Wagner, Trump Retweets Inflammatory and Unverified Anti-Muslim \nVideos, Wash.

And Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen recently stated that even though the number of \n2 \nunlawful entries to the United States was at historically low levels, still it “is an unacceptable \n3 \nrisk to public safety and national security.”26 \n4 \n72.  Consistent with these views, the Administration is using the Report to support its \n5 \nattempts to restrict lawful immigration and its ongoing stigmatization of Muslims. \n6 \n73.  For example, the White House issued a statement that the Report shows that “our current \n7 \n8  immigration system jeopardizes American security” and used the Report to justify its calls to end \n9  the visa lottery and migration preferences to support family reunification.27 \n10 \n74.  Similarly, Attorney General Sessions stated that the Report “reveals an indisputable \n11 \nsobering reality—our immigration system has undermined our national security and public \n12 \nsafety.”28   \n13 \n75.  In her statement on the Report’s release, Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen said that it \n14 \n“is a clear reminder of why we cannot continue to rely on immigration policy based on pre-9/11 \n15 \n16  thinking that leaves us woefully vulnerable to foreign-born terrorists, and why we must examine \n17  our visa laws and continue to intensify screening and vetting of individuals traveling to the \n18 \nUnited States to prevent terrorists, criminals, and other dangerous individuals from reaching our \n19 \ncountry.”29  \n20 \n21 \n                                                \n22 \n26 Written Testimony of DHS Secretary Nielsen Before the U.S. Senate Committee on the \n23  Judiciary (Jan. 16, 2018), https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/01-16-\n18%20Nielsen%20Testimony.pdf. \n24 \n27 Fact Sheet, White House, Our Current Immigration System Jeopardizes American Security \n25  (Jan. 16, 2018), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/current-immigration-system-\njeopardizes-american-security/. \n26 \n28 DOJ Press Release, supra note 8. \n27 \n29 Id. \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  19 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 20 of 26\n \n1  76.  She also warned the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Report was “just the tip of the \n2 \niceberg.” She then repeated the conclusion that supposedly three-fourths of individuals convicted \n3 \nof international terrorism in U.S. federal courts were foreign-born in her testimony in January \n4 \n2018 as part of her justification for the travel ban against nationals of six Muslim-majority \n5 \ncountries.30 \n6 \nThe Report’s use in public discourse and its harmful effects on Muslim communities. \n7 \n8  77.  The Report has also—and predictably—been widely used to promote anti-Muslim, anti-\n9  immigrant rhetoric by commentators in the public sphere. In the days following its publication, it \n10 \nwas described in news outlets as “linking terrorism with our broken immigration system, full of \n11 \nholes.”31 On one of the most-watched television news programs in the country,32 the host \n12 \ndescribed the Report as showing that “America’s terror threat is clearly . . . an immigration \n13 \n14 \n                                                \n15 \n30 Anna Giaritelli, DHS Chief: Foreign-born Have Made Up 3 in 4 of International Terrorism \nConvictions in US Courts Since Sept. 11 Attacks, Wash.

The damaging stigma the Report has caused is further amplified by an entirely \n4 \nforeseeable mischaracterization of its findings. The Report found (misleadingly) that 73 percent \n5 \nof all individuals convicted of international terrorism-related offenses were foreign-born. But \n6 \nnumerous government officials and anti-immigrant outlets have stated that 73 percent of \n7 \n8  individuals convicted of all terrorism-related offenses were foreign-born. For example, President \n9  Trump tweeted on its release date that the report “shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted \n10 \nof terrorism-related charges are foreign-born.”35 On the same day, House Judiciary Chairman \n11 \nBob Goodlatte stated that “[o]f the 549 terror-related convictions since the attacks on September \n12 \n13 \n14 \n                                                \n15 \n33 Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Tucker Carlson Discuss Immigration – MGTOW, YouTube \n16  (Jan. 18, 2018), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_244_Rf-Co (at 0:22). \n \n17  34 See, e.g., David Horowitz, Man up, DC!

By contributing to the stigmatization of Muslims, the Report is also likely to contribute to \n12 \nincreases in associated hate speech and violence.

In the Petition, Plaintiff also explained that it is an “affected person” within the meaning \n2 \nof the IQA and its implementing Guidelines because, among other reasons,  \n3 \nMuslim Advocates works to ensure that policies enacted under the banner of \nnational security do not wrongfully discriminate against Muslims and are not \n4 \nbased on inaccurate or misleading information.   \n5 \nMuslim Advocates uses reliable information concerning the American \n6  immigration population in its work, and it, as well as its clients, is also “harmed” \nby the dissemination of the Report, which seeks to portray immigrants, and \n7 \nparticularly Muslim immigrants, as inherently violent and likely to commit acts of \nterror.  Moreover, the Report serves as a mechanism to justify the travel and \n8 \nrefugee bans, which the Administration has attempted to justify, at least in part, \n9  by reference to the kinds of inaccurate data and biased findings contained in the \nReport.  The Report serves as further post hoc justification for those efforts, \n10  which directly harm Muslim Advocates and its clients. \n11 \n82.  The petition was sent via email and Federal Express.  The Federal Express delivery \n12 \narrived on January 30, 2018. \n13 \n83.  Under both DOJ and DHS Guidelines, Defendants have 60 calendar days to respond for a \n14 \nrequest for correction or to notify the requestor that additional time is needed.   \n15 \n84.  As of the date of filing, Plaintiff has not received any communication from either \n16 \n17  Defendant. \n18  Claim for Relief: Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n19 \n85.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates all allegations in the above paragraphs as if fully set forth \n20 \nherein. \n21 \n86.  The IQA, OMB’s IQA Guidelines, and DOJ and DHS’s IQA Guidelines require that \n22 \ninformation disseminated by agencies meet a requisite level of quality.   \n23 \n87.  The Report is information disseminated by Defendants within the meaning of the IQA \n24 \n25  and its implementing Guidelines.   \n26 \n27 \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  24 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 25 of 26\n \n1  88.  The Report fails the objectivity and utility requirements of information quality; instead, it \n2 \npresents information in a deceptive, misleading, and incomplete manner to artificially inflate the \n3 \nthreat that immigrants and Muslims pose to the United States. \n4 \n89.  Defendants were required to respond to Plaintiff’s Petition setting forth the ways in \n5 \nwhich the Report does not meet the IQA and its implementing Guidelines’ requirements as to \n6 \ninformation quality. \n7 \n8  90.  Defendants have failed to respond to Plaintiff’s Petition within the required timeframe.   \n9  91.  Defendants’ failure to respond to Plaintiff’s Petition violates the IQA and its \n10 \nimplementing Guidelines, and is therefore arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in \n11 \naccordance with law, without observance of procedure required by law, and otherwise violative \n12 \nof the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n13 \n92.  Defendants’ ongoing dissemination of the Report violates the IQA and its implementing \n14 \nGuidelines, and is therefore arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with \n15 \n16  law, and otherwise violative of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n17  Prayer for Relief \n18 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that this Court grant the following relief: \n19 \n1.  Declare that the Report disseminates information that fails the standard of quality \n20 \nrequired of federal agencies; \n21 \n2.  Declare that Defendants violated the IQA, its implementing Guidelines, and the APA; \n22 \n3.  Enjoin Defendants to cease dissemination of the Report; \n23 \n24  4.  Enjoin Defendants to respond to Plaintiff’s Petition;  \n25 \n5.  Award Plaintiff its costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and other disbursements incurred in \n26 \nthis action; and  \n27 \n28  Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n  25 \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-02137-JSC   Document 1   Filed 04/09/18   Page 26 of 26\n \n1  6.
