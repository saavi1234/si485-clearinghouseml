    "summary": "<p>On March 20, 2018, several people serving indeterminate sentences of a term of years to life with the possibility of parole in New York for crimes committed under age 18 filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the Commissioners of the New York State Board of Parole under 42 U.S.C &sect;1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, claimed that the New York State Board of Parole violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by repeatedly denying their parole applications. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge Vincent L. Briccetti.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs argued that they had been denied the realistic and meaningful opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation to which they were entitled and violated their Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth amendment rights. Specifically, the complaint alleged repeated instances where individual plaintiffs who were sentenced to prison for crimes committed as juveniles were denied parole arbitrarily. The complaint alleged that the New York State Board of Parole cherry-picked instances of misconduct to justify denying parole instead of reviewing parole applications holistically. In one instance, the Board allegedly relied on a single misbehavior from twenty years ago as a reason to deny parole to an inmate. This denial occurred even though the inmate had earned a master's degree while incarcerated, had been commended by local prison officials for helping to rehabilitate other prisoners, had low likelihood of recidivism, and had no instances of misconduct while in prison. The impact of these denials was that inmates, who had been sentenced for varying ranges of time, had their sentences extended beyond when they were supposed to be paroled.</p>\r\n<p>On March 23, 2018, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify their class for the lawsuit. Judge Briccetti denied their motion without prejudice on April 26, 2018, as being premature. Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to force the commissioners to review all of the application materials for an upcoming May Parole hearing on April 19, 2018. Judge Briccetti denied the motion and gave his reasoning verbally at a May 15 hearing.</p>\r\n<p>On June 22, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and on qualified immunity grounds. Shortly afterwards, the court, on its own motion, allowed plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which was filed on July 18. This amended complaint added six more named plaintiffs. On August 3, 2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On September 20, 2019, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' Sixth Amendment claims and all claims for injunctive relief, but ruled that the plaintiffs' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims for declaratory relief could proceed. 2019 WL 4572703. The court explained that, at that stage of the litigation, it found plausible plaintiffs' claim that the parole procedures for juveniles serving potential life terms do not satisfy due process.&nbsp; It further reasoned that the alleged denial of parole on the sole basis of the crime or juvenile criminal history and despite evidence of maturity and rehabilitation, if true, would violate the Eighth Amendment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thereafter, the parties engaged in discovery and related disputes.&nbsp; On June 1, 2022, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint, with updated plaintiffs and defendants.&nbsp; And on October 21, 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class.&nbsp; On February 2, 2023, the court issued an order requiring the parties to discuss settlement in good faith and denying plaintiffs' motion for class certification without prejudice pending resolution of defendants' anticipated motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; As of May 2023, the case remains in mediation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs are individuals \nwho were convicted of crimes committed when they were children under the age of 18 and \nsentenced to indeterminate life sentences with the possibility of parole.  Plaintiffs have been, \ncontinue to be, or will be subject to disproportionate punishment and deprived of due process of \nlaw by being denied a realistic and meaningful opportunity for release based upon demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation.  \n2.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of a class consisting of all persons eligible for \nrelease to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes committed when they were children \nunder the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life sentences with the possibility of parole in \nthe custody of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision \n(“DOCCS”) (hereinafter referred to as “juvenile lifers” or “Class Members”).  \n3.  Juvenile lifers, including Plaintiffs, have been, continue to be, or will be denied a \nmeaningful opportunity for release based upon demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, in \nviolation of the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.  Juvenile lifers, including Plaintiffs, have also been, continue to be, or will be \ndenied due process of law in the manner in which their parole hearings have been conducted, in \nviolation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 3 of 69\nJuvenile lifers, including Plaintiffs, have also been, continue to be, or will be denied their right to \na trial by jury and their right to due process because their sentences have been extended by \nfindings of fact made by the Board of Parole’s Commissioners, in violation of the Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n4.  Recognizing that fundamental differences between children and adults are \nrelevant to assessing proportionality in punishment, the U.S. Supreme Court has, in a series of \ncases, forbidden as unconstitutional life without parole for all juveniles, even those who commit \nheinous crimes, except for the “rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable \ncorruption”, and has held that this substantive constitutional rule is retroactive.  Montgomery v. \nLouisiana, 136 S. Ct. 718, 734 (2016) (quoting Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, 479-80 (2012)); \nGraham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 82 (2010).   \n5.  Taken together, these decisions establish that the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution prohibits statutory schemes that fail to provide juvenile lifers with a meaningful and \nrealistic opportunity for release based upon demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  See \nMiller, 567 U.S. at 470-80; Graham, 560 U.S. at 50. \n6.  These decisions have both a substantive component, which applies retroactively \nto all juvenile lifers in prison today, and a procedural component, which applies at parole \nhearings where juvenile lifers face possible life imprisonment if parole is denied.  See \nMontgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734-35.   \n7.  In New York State, the authority to release any person sentenced to a maximum \nterm of life prior to the end of his or her natural life lies with the New York State Board of \nParole (hereinafter “Board of Parole” or “Board”).  Defendants are each Commissioners of the \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 4 of 69\nBoard of Parole and are sued in their official capacity (hereinafter “Commissioners” or \n“Defendants”). \n8.  Despite clear precedent to the contrary, Defendants have interpreted the \nNew York Executive Law to allow Defendants to deny parole to juvenile lifers without regard to \nan individual’s subsequent demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, if Defendants determine \nthat release would be “not compatible with the welfare of society” or would “so deprecate the \nseriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law”.  See N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-i(2)(c)(A).   \n9.  Accordingly, Defendants regularly deny parole to juvenile lifers who demonstrate \nunmistakable rehabilitation and reform, and low risk to public safety.  Defendants have \nconsistently denied such individuals parole with short conclusory opinions citing only factors \npresent at the time of conviction, such as juvenile criminal history and the nature of the crime of \nconviction.  \n10.  The procedures and practices of the Board of Parole, as executed by Defendants, \nthereby deprive juvenile lifers, including Plaintiffs, of a meaningful opportunity for release based \non demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation in violation of the constitutional prohibition against \nexcessive punishment.  The formal regulations and regular practices of the Board of Parole, as \nexecuted by Defendants, also violate juvenile lifers’, including Plaintiffs’, Due Process rights, \nwhich arise from the liberty interest in parole conferred by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Eighth \nAmendment jurisprudence and by New York State Executive Law and the Board’s regulations. \n11.  Plaintiffs do not challenge their judgments of conviction and do not seek to \ninvalidate their sentences.  Plaintiffs do not seek an order of release from this Court.  Rather, \nPlaintiffs seek an order that Defendants must afford them, and those similarly situated, as \npersons sentenced to life imprisonment for offenses committed before they were 18 years old, a \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 5 of 69\nmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on non-arbitrary criteria that measure their degree \nof maturity and rehabilitation. \n12.  Plaintiffs do not maintain that all Class Members are necessarily entitled to \nimmediate release under the constitutionally mandated standard for release.  Through this action, \nPlaintiffs seek to ensure that Defendants apply the constitutionally mandated standard at parole \nrelease hearings for Plaintiffs and all Class Members. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n13.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343(a)(3).  The controversy arises under the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution.   \n14.  Venue properly lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2) \nbecause a majority of Plaintiffs are or were incarcerated within the Southern District of New \nYork, and Defendants have conducted parole hearings and taken other actions leading to the \ndenial of Plaintiffs’ rights, as alleged further herein, within the Southern District of New York. \nPARTIES \n \nA.  Plaintiffs \ni.  Plaintiff Carlos Flores \n15.  Plaintiff Carlos Flores is 54 years old and until his recent release, had been \nincarcerated since he was 17.  He was convicted of felony murder after participating in a robbery \nin January 1981 that resulted in an accomplice shooting an off-duty police officer who was a \npatron in the bar and drew a gun. \n16.  Mr. Flores was convicted of murder in the second degree and was sentenced to 21 \nyears to life.  At sentencing, the judge considered, and rejected, a lengthier minimum sentence of \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 6 of 69\n25 years because Mr. Flores had no prior criminal record and was not the shooter.  Mr. Flores \nwas denied parole ten times.  By the time he ultimately was granted parole on his eleventh try, \nafter the original complaint in this lawsuit was filed, he had already been incarcerated for 37 \nyears, 16 years in excess of the 21-year minimum set by the judge.  \n17.  Mr. Flores had a difficult upbringing.  He was a victim of frequent abuse and \ndropped out of school to support his family financially by working at a pizzeria.  He was \nmanipulated into participating in a robbery by a much older man who had significant influence \nover him—a man who had shown him friendship and who he had thought was a mentor.  During \nthe robbery, in an unplanned act, one of the robbers shot and killed a patron of the bar, Robert \nWalsh, an off-duty police officer.  At that time, Mr. Flores was in a separate room at the back of \nthe bar. \n18.  Nothing in Mr. Flores’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crimes reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”.   \n19.  Before Mr. Flores was released on June 25, 2018, he was incarcerated at Otisville \nCorrectional Facility in Otisville, New York.  Mr. Flores had an exceptional institutional record \nwhile in custody.  His last disciplinary offense was more than 25 years ago for disobeying an \norder to keep the mess hall line moving.  \n20.  He had low (favorable) scores across the board in his Correctional Offender \nManagement Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (“COMPAS”).  In addition, his COMPAS \nreport found that if released he would require the lowest level of supervision.  He had earned \noutside clearance to work in the community, a permit DOCCS grants only to the most \ntrustworthy inmates who can safely work outside the prison with minimal supervision. \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 7 of 69\n21.  Defendants last denied Mr. Flores release on October 24, 2017, on the \nunsubstantiated basis that his “discretionary release at this time, would not be compatible with \nthe welfare of society and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the Instant Offense and \nundermine respect for the law”.  \n22.  Plaintiff Carlos Flores brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of similarly \nsituated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n23.  Mr. Flores was denied a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that: \n(1) Commissioners did not fully consider, read or attend to Mr. Flores’s parole submission; \n(2) neither Mr. Flores nor his attorneys were permitted access to letters opposing his release; \n(3) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at his interview and the right to see and \nconfront any evidence against him; (4) his denial was based on a crime he committed decades \nago that he could not change; (5) Commissioners did not base their decision on Mr. Flores’s \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation; and (6) he was denied any explanation for what \nadditional steps he must take to be recommended for parole. \nii.  Plaintiff Lawrence Bartley \n24.  Plaintiff Lawrence Bartley is 45 years old and until his recent release, had been \nincarcerated since he was 17.  In December 1990, Mr. Bartley was involved in a gunfight that \nerupted at a local movie theater.  Twenty shots were exchanged in total, with only one shot fired \nby Mr. Bartley.  In the midst of the shooting, a bystander, Tremain Hall, was accidentally shot \nand killed.    \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 8 of 69\n25.  Mr. Bartley received an aggregate sentence of 27 and one-third years to life for \nsecond degree murder and associated offenses.  By the time he ultimately was granted parole in \nApril 2018, after the original complaint in this lawsuit was filed, he had already been imprisoned \nfor 27 years and was incarcerated at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, New York.   \n26.  Mr. Bartley grew up in a rough neighborhood surrounded by drug dealers and \ngang members.  At only age 16, he was shot four times in a drive-by shooting.  He began \ncarrying a gun thereafter out of fear for his life.   \n27.  Nothing in Mr. Bartley’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crimes reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”. \n28.  Mr. Bartley had an exceptional institutional disciplinary record while in custody.  \nHis last disciplinary infraction was in 2008, roughly ten years ago.   \n29.  Mr. Bartley’s COMPAS report found him to be at a low risk of reoffending.  \nMr. Bartley had received numerous letters of support from corrections officers, including from \nthe superintendent of Sing Sing, noting that Mr. Bartley’s behavior “exemplifies DOCCS’[s] \nmission of rehabilitating its residents to positively re-enter society”.   \n30.  While incarcerated, Mr. Bartley earned a six-month limited credit time allowance \n(“LCTA”) for “significant programmatic accomplishment” and lack of serious disciplinary \ninfractions.  The LCTA award made him eligible for parole release six months before the \nexpiration of his minimum term. \n31.  Defendants last denied Mr. Bartley release on September 6, 2017.  He was denied \nrelease despite ample evidence of his maturation and rehabilitation, including having earned a \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 9 of 69\nMaster’s degree, raised $8,000 for a gun buy-back program, publicly engaged in anti-violence \nand anti-gun violence programming and secured employment upon release. \n32.  In their September 6, 2017 decision, Defendants acknowledged these \nachievements, writing:  “The Panel applauds your exceptional packet, institutional \naccomplishments, your overall low COMPAS score and satisfactory case plan.  Your release \nplanning, community outreach, use of media, networking and your life as an example \nexemplifies an extraordinary effort to give back, demonstrates restoration and evidenced \nchange”.  The panel then concluded, without any basis, that “there is a reasonable probability \nthat you would not live and remain at liberty without again violating the law and that your \nrelease would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so deprecate the serious \nnature of the crime as to undermine respect for the law”. \n33.  Mr. Bartley represents himself and a class of similarly situated people eligible for \nrelease to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes committed when they were children \nunder the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life sentences with the possibility of parole in \nthe custody of DOCCS. \n34.  Mr. Bartley was denied a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that: \n(1) Commissioners did not meaningfully consider, read or attend to Mr. Bartley’s full parole \nsubmission; (2) the denial of release to parole supervision was based on a crime he committed \ndecades ago that he could not change; (3) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at \nhis interview and the right to see and confront any evidence against him; (4) he was denied the \nright to inspect and challenge the method of calculating his COMPAS scores; (5) Commissioners \nfailed to base their decision on Mr. Bartley’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation since the \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 10 of 69\nage of 17; and (6) he was denied any explanation for what additional steps he must take to be \nrecommended for parole.  \niii.  Demetrius Bennett  \n35.  Plaintiff Demetrius Bennett is 39 years old and has been incarcerated since he was \n15.  He was convicted of felony murder when, at 15 years old and under the direction of a man in \nhis thirties, Mr. Bennett participated in robbing a bicycle shop.  During the robbery, the older \nman shot and killed a police officer.   \n36.  Prior to the bicycle shop robbery, Mr. Bennett had no criminal record.  He did not \nplan the robbery, was not carrying a weapon, was not the shooter and was not in the room when \nthe shooting occurred.  After a trial, Mr. Bennett was convicted of murder in the second degree \nand robbery and was sentenced to nine years to life.  By the time he was ultimately granted \nparole in September 2018, after the amended complaint in this lawsuit was filed, he had already \nbeen denied parole eight times and had been incarcerated for over 23 years—14 years in excess \nof the nine-year minimum sentence set by the judge.    \n37.  Prior to the crime, Mr. Bennett, a 15-year-old child, had no family support.  \nMr. Bennett’s mother passed away when he was 13 years old and his father was only \nintermittently present during his childhood and was not performing a parenting role.  After his \nmother’s death, Mr. Bennett lived on the streets and stayed on friends’ couches.  His oldest sister \nand younger brother went to live with his aunt, and his other sister went to foster care.  \nMr. Bennett earned a meager living on the streets, pumping gas and helping people to their cars \nwith their groceries to earn money.  He stopped attending school out of frustration because he \ndid not know how to read or do math.   \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 11 of 69\n38.  Prior to the crime, Karen Young, the mother of one of Mr. Bennett’s friends, took \nMr. Bennett in off the streets even though they were not related, and Mr. Bennett returned to \nschool. \n39.  At the time of the crime, Mr. Bennett was high on marijuana.  He and his co-\ndefendants, Lavonne Smith and Vernon Smith, ages 16 and 17 years old respectively, were \npersuaded to rob a bicycle shop by his co-defendants’ uncle, Richard Larrier, who was in his \nthirties.  Mr. Bennett was directed to tie up the owners of the store in the back room.  During the \nrobbery, the police entered the store and Mr. Larrier shot and killed a police officer, Raymond \nCannon.  Mr. Larrier was subsequently shot and killed.  \n40.  Nothing in Mr. Bennett’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crime reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”.   \n41.  Mr. Bennett is presently incarcerated at Woodbourne Correctional Facility in \nWoodbourne, New York, while he awaits his release to parole supervision.  He earned his \nGeneral Equivalency Diploma (“GED”) after multiple attempts, demonstrating perseverance and \na commitment to his future.  During his incarceration, he has completed numerous programs and \nhas an extensive work history.  He has been described as an “asset” in an Inmate Progress Report \nfor his work on the maintenance and paint crew.  He was also described in that report as a \nhumble leader and respectful to all staff and his peers.   \n42.  For the most part, Mr. Bennett has low (favorable) scores on his COMPAS, \nexcept for “Prison Misconduct”, “ReEntry Substance Abuse” and “ReEntry Financial”, which \nare “high”, “probable” and “probable”, respectively.  As alleged below, Mr. Bennett lacks \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 12 of 69\nknowledge and has been denied information about how his COMPAS scores—favorable or \nunfavorable—are calculated. \n43.  His disciplinary record demonstrates his growth over the years, and in his \nSeptember 2017 decision Defendants noted that his “disciplinary record reflects some violent \nconduct over the years but none in nearly five years”.  \n44.  Defendants last denied Mr. Bennett release at his September 13, 2017 hearing.  \nAside from recounting the tragic loss of life caused by his crime, the Commissioners’ decision \ncontains all positive factors demonstrating rehabilitation and reform, noting that while in \ncustody, Mr. Bennett has “performed well in [his] programs, satisfying all requirements”.  \nNonetheless, without citing to any support in the record, the Board concluded that the “panel is \nnot convinced that if released you would live at liberty without once again violating the law or \nthat your release would not so deprecate the offense as to undermine respect for the law”.   \n45.  Plaintiff Demetrius Bennett brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of \nsimilarly situated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS.  \n46.  Mr. Bennett was denied a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that: \n(1) Commissioners did not fully consider, read or attend to Mr. Bennett’s parole submission; \n(2) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at his interview and the right to see and \nconfront any evidence against him; (3) he was denied the right to inspect and challenge the \nmethod of calculating his COMPAS scores; (4) Mr. Bennett was not permitted access to letters \nopposing his release; (5) his denial is based on a crime he committed decades ago that he cannot \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 13 of 69\nchange; (6) Commissioners did not base their decision on Mr. Bennett’s demonstrated maturity \nand rehabilitation; and (7) he was denied any explanation for what additional steps he must take \nto be recommended for parole. \niv.  L’Mani Delima \n47.  Plaintiff L’Mani Delima is 26 years old and has been incarcerated since he was a \n13-year-old weighing approximately 100 pounds.      \n48.  Mr. Delima’s attorney advised him to take a plea for his crime in exchange for a \nsentence of eight years to life.  After Mr. Delima was sentenced, his attorney was arrested and \nindicted for several racketeering and other serious offenses.  The court eventually vacated \nMr. Delima’s plea and sentence.  Mr. Delima then went to trial, represented by a new attorney, \nand was convicted and sentenced to nine years to life.  To date, he has been incarcerated for \nalmost 13 years.  He has now been denied parole three times. \n49.  In 2005, Mr. Delima was a five-foot-tall, 100-pound, 13-year-old middle school \nstudent, living with his single mother and three older siblings.  Mr. Delima’s mother was loving \nand hardworking, but she was a single mother working multiple jobs to support her children.  At \nthe time of the crime, Mr. Delima was being supervised by a man in his thirties whom \nMr. Delima knew well growing up and referred to as his “godfather”.  In June 2005, Mr. Delima \nwas shopping with his godfather and several other older men when a fight broke out between \nmembers of the group and Phoenix Garrett on the street.  During the struggle, Mr. Garrett \nslashed Mr. Delima’s godfather’s face.  In response, an older man handed Mr. Delima a gun and \nMr. Delima shot Mr. Garrett five times.  \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 14 of 69\n50.  Nothing in Mr. Delima’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crimes reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”.  \n51.  Mr. Delima is presently incarcerated at Fishkill Correctional Facility in Beacon, \nNew York.  Even though Mr. Delima has struggled with academic challenges, he has dedicated \nhis time in prison toward his academic development and continues to work toward obtaining his \nGED.  While incarcerated, he has completed a variety of vocational training and programs.  He \ncurrently works in the Residential Mental Health Unit and serves as the representative of his \nhousing unit on the Inmate Liaison Committee. \n52.  Mr. Delima has a high “Risk of Felony Violence” score on his COMPAS.  On \ninformation and belief, this score is due to Mr. Delima’s young age.  As alleged below, \nMr. Delima lacks knowledge and has been denied information about how his COMPAS scores—\nfavorable or unfavorable—are calculated. \n53.  Defendants last denied Mr. Delima parole in a decision dated August 24, 2017. \nThe decision merely states the fact of his chronological age of 13 at the time of the crime without \nany discussion of relevance to his culpability.  The decision states that the “Board of Parole \ncommends your personal growth, maturity and productive use of time, however, discretionary \nrelease on parole shall not be granted merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient \nperformance of duties while confined”.  However, the panel “concluded that [his] release at this \ntime in light of [his] offense and disciplinary record would so deprecate the offense as to \nundermine respect for the law”.   \n54.  Plaintiff L’Mani Delima brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of \nsimilarly situated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 15 of 69\ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n55.  Mr. Delima has been denied and continues to be denied a meaningful opportunity \nfor release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in \nthat: (1) Commissioners did not fully consider, read or attend to Mr. Delima’s parole submission; \n(2) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at his interview and the right to see and \nconfront any evidence against him; (3) he was denied the right to inspect and challenge the \nmethod of calculating his COMPAS scores; (4) his denial is based on a crime he committed over \na decade ago that he cannot change; and (5) Commissioners did not base their decision on \nMr. Delima’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. \nv.  Edgardo Lebron \n56.  Plaintiff Edgardo Lebron is 43 years old and has been incarcerated since he was \n15 years old.   \n57.  Mr. Lebron is serving an aggregate sentence of eight and one-half years to life.  \nBy the time he ultimately was granted parole in August 2018, after the amended complaint in \nthis lawsuit was filed, he had already been denied parole ten times and had been imprisoned for \n28 years—20 years in excess of the minimum sentence he was given as a child.  Mr. Lebron is \nincarcerated at Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York, while he awaits his release to \nparole supervision.   \n58.  Mr. Lebron did not have a stable family life as a child.  He was bounced between \nthe homes of his mother, father and grandparents in Puerto Rico and then was sent alone to live \nwith his aunt in the Bronx, New York, with the promise that his father would join him in the \nmainland United States a few months later.   \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 16 of 69\n59.  Mr. Lebron had difficulty adjusting to his new life in New York.  He missed his \nfamily and his Puerto Rican culture.  In addition, he did not speak English, and therefore \nstruggled in school and did not have any friends.   \n60.  When Mr. Lebron found out that his father in fact was not joining him in the \nBronx, Mr. Lebron’s eagerness to return to Puerto Rico intensified.   \n61.  Two neighborhood acquaintances who spoke Spanish (two men in their late \ntwenties or early thirties) promised to give Mr. Lebron money to buy a return flight to Puerto \nRico if he helped them rob people on the street.  The two older men taught Mr. Lebron to ask for \nmoney in English and gave him a knife to commit the robberies.  Soon thereafter, at 15 years old, \nMr. Lebron committed the crime for which he is currently incarcerated, pleading guilty to second \ndegree murder after stabbing once and killing Hugie Harley in September 1990.  \n62.  Nothing in Mr. Lebron’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crimes reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”.   \n63.  Mr. Lebron received a substantial number of disciplinary tickets while in prison.  \nIn recent years, he changed this course by obtaining his GED and completing a variety of \nvocational training and programs, such as custodial maintenance, mobility assistance and legal \nresearch.  He also wishes to obtain college credits, but has been unable to afford such courses.   \n64.  Mr. Lebron’s January 12, 2018 COMPAS has low (favorable) scores across the \nboard, except for “Prison Misconduct” and “ReEntry Substance Abuse”, which are “High” and \n“Probable”, respectively.  As alleged below, Mr. Lebron lacks knowledge and has been denied \ninformation about how his COMPAS scores—favorable or unfavorable—are calculated. \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 17 of 69\n65.  Defendants last denied Mr. Lebron release on November 9, 2016, concluding that \nhis “release is incompatible with the [w]elfare and safety of the community”.  \n66.  Plaintiff Edgardo Lebron brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of \nsimilarly situated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n67.  Mr. Lebron was denied a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that: \n(1) Commissioners did not fully consider, read or attend to Mr. Lebron’s parole submission; \n(2) neither Mr. Lebron nor his attorneys were permitted access to letters opposing his release; \n(3) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at his interview and the right to see and \nconfront any evidence against him; (4) he was denied the right to inspect and challenge the \nmethod of calculating his COMPAS scores; (5) his denial is based on a crime he committed \ndecades ago that he cannot change; (6) Commissioners did not base their decision on \nMr. Lebron’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation; and (7) he was denied any explanation \nfor what additional steps he must take to be recommended for parole. \nvi.  Antonio Roman \n68.  Plaintiff Antonio Roman is 41 years old and has been incarcerated for almost 24 \nyears for a crime committed when he was 17 years old.     \n69.  Mr. Roman was abandoned in infancy by both of his parents.  His mother left \nafter he was born and his father was absent.  He was raised by his grandmother, but she also \nabandoned him and moved to Puerto Rico when he was 16 years old, leaving Mr. Roman \nstruggling to support himself on his own.  Mr. Roman became a teen parent and did not have a \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 18 of 69\nway to support himself or provide for his daughter.  Mr. Roman was desperate.  He met an older \nman, co-defendant Ralph “Tony” Ambert, at a party.  Mr. Ambert offered Mr. Roman money \nand a car to help him shoot his father, stepmother and anyone else in the house, because \nMr. Ambert believed that his father was going to remove him from his will.  Under the direction \nof his older co-defendant, Mr. Roman shot and killed Mr. Ambert’s stepmother, Patricia Ambert.  \nMr. Roman did not know the victim prior to the crime.  He took a plea and was convicted of \nmurder in the second degree for a crime that occurred in January 1995 when he was 17 years old.  \n70.  Nothing in Mr. Roman’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crime reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”.  \n71.  Mr. Roman received a sentence of 20 years to life.  By the time he was ultimately \ngranted parole in September 2018, after the amended complaint in this lawsuit was filed, he had \nserved almost 24 years in prison and had been denied parole three times despite significant \nevidence of rehabilitation and an exceptional disciplinary record.   Mr. Roman is presently \nincarcerated in Fishkill Correctional Facility in Beacon, New York while he awaits release to \nparole supervision.   \n72.   Mr. Roman has an exceptional disciplinary record while in custody.  His last \ndisciplinary infraction was in 2003, roughly 15 years ago.  Furthermore, his COMPAS scores are \nlow (favorable) across the board.   \n73.  While incarcerated, Mr. Roman received his GED and has earned multiple college \ncredits.  He has participated in several programs for HIV awareness and treatment.  He also \ncompleted a 16-week training program for food handling and sanitation practices.   \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 19 of 69\n74.  He has received numerous commendable behavior reports from corrections \nofficers recommending him for parole.  \n75.  Defendants last denied Mr. Roman parole release on September 20, 2016 despite \nsignificant evidence of his maturity and rehabilitation.  Defendants “commend[ed] [his] personal \ngrowth and productive use of time”.  However, Defendants denied release on the unsubstantiated \nbasis that “if released at this time, [his] release would be incompatible with the welfare of society \nand would so deprecate the serious nature of the crime . . . as to undermine respect for the law”.  \nDefendants merely noted that they had “considered [his] age at the time of the crime and \ndiminished culpability at the time”.  Defendants concluded, however, that “discretionary release \n[was] not presently warranted as [his] release would trivialize the tragic loss of life that [he] \ncaused”.   \n76.  Plaintiff Antonio Roman brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of \nsimilarly situated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n77.  Mr. Roman was denied a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that:  (1) \nCommissioners did not fully consider, read or attend to Mr. Roman’s parole submission; (2) \nMr. Roman was not permitted access to letters opposing his release; (3) he was denied the right \nto have an attorney present at his interview and the right to see and confront any evidence against \nhim; (4) his denial is based on a crime he committed decades ago that he cannot change; (5) \nCommissioners did not base their decision on Mr. Roman’s demonstrated maturity and \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 20 of 69\nrehabilitation; and (6) he was denied any explanation for what additional steps he must take to be \nrecommended for parole. \nvii.  Dontae Quinones \n78.  Plaintiff Dontae Quinones is 43 years old and has been incarcerated since he was \n17 years old.   \n79.  Mr. Quinones grew up without consistent parental care or permanent home.  His \nfather has “never been in his life”, was incarcerated before he was born and remained \nincarcerated throughout Mr. Quinones’s teenage years.  His mother, who gave birth to him at a \nyoung age, was unprepared to care for him.  As a result, Mr. Quinones was shuffled between the \nhomes of his grandparents, his mother and a cousin in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn, New \nYork.  Mr. Quinones was largely left to the streets. \n80.  In January 1993, when Mr. Quinones was only 16 years old, he got into a verbal \nand physical altercation when Tyron Bess, an older man with whom Mr. Quinones had been \ngambling, lost and refused to pay his $12 gambling debt.  In the midst of the altercation, \nMr. Quinones, who carried a gun because he felt he needed one for protection in his \nneighborhood, shot the victim, killing him.   \n81.  Mr. Quinones was arrested carrying an illegal weapon and subsequently pled \nguilty to second-degree murder and illegal possession of a weapon in the third degree.  He was \nsentenced to 15 years to life for the former and received a concurrent sentence of one-and-a-half \nto four-and-a-half years for the latter.   \n82.  During his early years of incarceration, Mr. Quinones struggled with anger and \nrule abiding.  Between 1994 and 1995, while still a teenager, Mr. Quinones was convicted of \npromoting prison contraband and attempted assault in the first degree.  As a result of these two \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 21 of 69\nadditional convictions, Mr. Quinones is currently serving an aggregate sentence of 21 years to \nlife.  With respect to the attempted assault charge, Mr. Quinones maintains that in 1995, when he \nwas first transferred to an adult prison, he was placed in a “cage” with another violent inmate \nwhen a fight ensued.  Knowing that rapes were fairly common in the facility he was housed in, \nMr. Quinones used a razor blade during the fight because he “felt he had something to prove . . . \nnot to be with the stigmas of being raped and so on and so forth”.      \n83.  Mr. Quinones has now been denied parole three times.   \n84.  Nothing in Mr. Quinones’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that \nhis crime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crimes reflects \npermanent incorrigibility”.   \n85.  Mr. Quinones is presently incarcerated at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in \nOssining, New York.  Despite having a lengthy disciplinary record when he first entered the \nprison system, Mr. Quinones has sought to reform himself.  He has not had a disciplinary ticket \nin the past five years.  While incarcerated, he obtained his GED and has completed a variety of \nvocational training and programs, such as masonry, carpentry and the Youth Assistance \nProgram.  As a result of this progress, Mr. Quinones now has low (favorable) scores across the \nboard in his COMPAS, which also indicate that he would require the lowest level of supervision \nif released.   \n86.  During his time in prison, Mr. Quinones has also reflected on the crime for which \nhe is currently incarcerated, demonstrating insight into the impact of his actions.  Mr. Quinones \nis “certain and forever remorseful of [his] actions on that day, and how they forever must have \nterrorized the memories of those who reside in that community of downtown Brooklyn”.   \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 22 of 69\n87.  Mr. Quinones had a parole hearing on October 4, 2017.  During the hearing he \nexplained to Commissioners that the fact that he took someone’s life “is like a nightmare that I \nlive day-to-day with.  It’s nothing that I am proud of now as a man. And the remorse not only \ngoes out to the Bess family, but to society as a whole because a life was took and I can never \ntake that back”.  He also reflected during his hearing that “[O]nce I learned the reason for my \nbehavior, I was like that is senseless. You start reflecting on things and it changes your views, \nyour behavior”.  \n88.  Defendants denied Mr. Quinones release after that October 4, 2017 hearing, after \nthe new regulations were in effect.  The Commissioners’ decision cites all positive factors \ndemonstrating maturity and rehabilitation, including Mr. Quinones’s COMPAS scores indicating \nhim to be low risk to the community, stating:  “The Board of Parole commends your personal \ngrowth, programmatic achievements and productive use of time” and recognizing “your risk \nCOMPAS, your programming and case plan to your credit.  The panel also acknowledges . . . \nyour recent improvement in institutional behavior following a problematic disciplinary record \nearly in your incarceration”.  Nonetheless, Defendants then proceeded to deny Mr. Quinones \nrelease to parole supervision based on “[t]he seriousness of the crime” and, without basis, cited \nto Mr. Quinones’s “limited insight into the impacts of [his] actions”. \n89.  Consistent with the text of the new regulations and Defendants’ mistaken belief \nthat the Eighth Amendment merely obliges them to document their knowledge of the applicant’s \nage at the time of the crime, the denial decision was careful to include the phrase “[t]he panel  \nalso acknowledges your young age at the time of offense”.   \n90.  Plaintiff Dontae Quinones brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of \nsimilarly situated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 23 of 69\ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n91.  Mr. Quinones has been denied and continues to be denied a meaningful \nopportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due \nprocess, in that: (1) Commissioners did not fully consider, read or attend to Mr. Quinones’s \nparole submission; (2) neither Mr. Quinones nor his attorneys were permitted access to letters \nopposing his release; (3) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at his interview and \nthe right to see and confront any evidence against him; (4) he was denied the right to inspect and \nchallenge the method of calculating his COMPAS scores; (5) his denial is based on crimes he \ncommitted as a juvenile decades ago that he cannot change; (6) Commissioners did not base their \ndecision on Mr. Quinones’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation; and (7) he was denied any \nexplanation for what additional steps he must take to be recommended for parole. \nviii.  Sharod Logan \n92.  Plaintiff Sharod Logan is now 33 years old and has been incarcerated since he \nwas 16 years old.   \n93.  Prior to the crime, Mr. Logan had no family support.  When Mr. Logan was seven \nyears old, his father died while he was in prison for a crime unknown to Mr. Logan.  Three years \nlater, when Mr. Logan was only 10 years old, his mother also passed away.  Thereafter, he and \nhis two younger siblings were placed in the care of their 18-year-old sister who was already \ncaring for her own young daughter.  For the next six years, Mr. Logan did not have a permanent \nhome and bounced between his sister’s home in the Marcy Projects in Bedford-Stuyvesant, \nBrooklyn, and the home of his maternal grandmother.  Mr. Logan was largely left to the streets \nsurrounded by other troubled teens in the neighborhood.  \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 24 of 69\n94.  In 2001, when Mr. Logan was 16 years old, one of Mr. Logan’s teenaged friends \nsuggested that they rob a random stranger, Mr. Torres.  Mr. Logan did not know Mr. Torres, and \nhe did not have any plans before that day to rob him.  Nevertheless, Mr. Logan agreed to commit \nthe crime because his friend said that Mr. Torres had drugs on his person that they could steal \nand sell for money.  Mr. Logan approached the victim and demanded that he “ run [his] pockets”.  \nIn response, the victim, Mr. Torres, took out a knife and stabbed Mr. Logan three times in the \nback, once in his side and once in his arm.  Mr. Logan tried to retreat but was wounded and was \nunable to do so.  When Mr. Torres continued to pursue Mr. Logan, Mr. Logan turned around to \nface Mr. Torres, took out a gun that he had been carrying on him for protection and shot \nMr. Torres once, killing him.  Mr. Logan’s friend called an ambulance and Mr. Logan was \nadmitted to a hospital to be treated for his stab wounds.   \n95.  Mr. Logan subsequently was arrested and pled guilty to two counts of second-\ndegree murder.  He was sentenced to 16 years to life and has now served more than 17 years.  \n96.  Nothing in Mr. Logan’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crimes reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”.   \n97.  Mr. Logan is presently incarcerated at Fishkill Correctional Facility in Beacon, \nNew York.  He has low (favorable) COMPAS scores across the board.  And, as Defendants have \nacknowledged, Mr. Logan “is a young man who came to prison and took advantage of the \nopportunities that were afforded to him to improve his situation and prepare himself to get out.” \n98.  Defendants denied Mr. Logan release after his interview on December 19, 2017, \nafter the new regulations were in effect.  Defendants noted Mr. Logan’s “case plan, parole \npacket, and excellent programming achievements while incarcerated, indicat[ing] [his] personal \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 25 of 69\ngrowth and maturation.”  Nevertheless, Defendants denied parole to Mr. Logan in part because \nthey found two Tier-II disciplinary tickets “[o]f concern”.   \n99.  On information and belief, the two Tier II tickets arose from an incident in which \na civilian cook in Food Services at Fishkill Correctional Facility refused to provide Mr. Logan \nenough food to make 10 food trays.  Mr. Logan informed a correctional officer.  The civilian \ncook became angry and yelled at Mr. Logan, who walked out of the room to avoid further \nconfrontation.  A fellow inmate ultimately convinced the civilian cook to provide enough food to \nmake 10 food trays.  The day after his encounter with the civilian cook, Mr. Logan received the \nfirst of the two tickets.  He contested this ticket and three of the five charges regarding the \nticket—harassment, interference with employee and making a threat—were dropped.  The final \ntwo charges, for disobeying a direct order and for causing a disturbance, were not dropped.  The \nday after Mr. Logan received this ticket, he approached a different civilian cook in Food Services \nrequesting a change in work assignment.  The civilian cook reported Mr. Logan for refusing to \nwork.  Based on these two (non-violent) tickets, other tickets received years ago and alleged \nofficial opposition to Mr. Logan’s release—the authors and content of which they refused to \ndisclose—Defendants concluded that Mr. Logan’s “release would be incompatible with the \nwelfare of society and would so deprecate the seriousness of the offense as to undermine respect \nfor the law”. \n100.  Consistent with the text of the new regulations and Defendants’ mistaken belief \nthat the Eighth Amendment merely obliges them to document their knowledge of the applicant’s \nage at the time of the crime, the record reflects that Commissioners dutifully “note[d] [his] young \nage at the time of offense and the challenges [he] had faced in [his] life as a child and young \nadult.”  \n25 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 26 of 69\n101.  Plaintiff Sharod Logan brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of \nsimilarly situated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n102.  Mr. Logan has been denied and continues to be denied a meaningful opportunity \nfor release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in \nthat: (1) Commissioners did not fully consider, read or attend to Mr. Logan’s parole submission; \n(2) neither Mr. Logan nor his attorneys were permitted access to letters opposing his release; \n(3) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at his interview and the right to see and \nconfront any evidence against him; (4) his denial is based on a crime he committed decades ago \nthat he cannot change; (5) his denial is based on “official opposition” that Mr. Logan did not \nhave an opportunity to inspect and controvert; (6) he was denied the right to inspect and \nchallenge the method of calculating his COMPAS scores; (7) Commissioners did not base their \ndecision on Mr. Logan’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation; and (8) he was denied any \nexplanation for what additional steps he must take to be recommended for parole. \nB.

JUVENILES HAVE DIMINISHED CULPABILITY AND GREATER PROSPECTS \nFOR REFORM THAN ADULTS, AND THE STATE CANNOT, EXCEPT IN THE \n29 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 30 of 69\nRAREST OF CASES, CONDEMN JUVENILE OFFENDERS TO DIE IN PRISON \nWITHOUT A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR RELEASE. \nA.  The relevant scientific communities have recognized that children are \ncategorically different from adults. \n117.  Scientific and psychological studies confirm that children are fundamentally \ndifferent from adults, and as a result, their culpability is diminished.   \n118.  The first reason that justifies the diminished culpability of juvenile offenders is \ntheir lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility.  See Laurence Steinberg & \nElizabeth S. Scott, Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence: Developmental Immaturity, \nDiminished Responsibility, and the Juvenile Death Penalty, 58 Am. Psychologist 1009, 1011-14 \n(2003). \n119.  Their lack of maturity often results in impetuous and ill-considered actions and \ndecisions (i.e., impulsive conduct), which explains why “adolescents are overrepresented \nstatistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior”.  Jeffrey Arnett, Reckless Behavior \nin Adolescence: A Developmental Perspective, 12 Developmental Rev. 339, 339 (1992); see also \nLaurence Steinberg & Robert G. Schwartz, Developmental Psychology Goes to Court in Youth \non Trial: A Developmental Perspective on Juvenile Justice 9 (Thomas Grisso & Robert G. \nSchwartz eds. 2000).  \n120.  Developmental research shows that juveniles engage in impulsive decision-\nmaking because they are unable to perceive risks.  Melinda G. Schmidt et al., Effectiveness of \nParticipation as a Defendant: The Attorney-Juvenile Client Relationship, 21 Behav. Sci. & L. \n175, 180 (2003).  Another explanation for their impulsive behavior is that juveniles think more \nabout immediate gains as opposed to long-term consequences, and thus consider the meaning of \na potential act differently than adults.  Id.; see also Kristin N. Henning, Loyalty, Paternalism, and \n30 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 31 of 69\nRights: Client Counseling Theory and the Role of Child’s Counsel in Delinquency Cases, 81 \nNotre Dame L. Rev. 245, 271-72 (2005).   \n121.  A second area of difference between adults and adolescents is that juveniles are \nmore vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure.  Steinberg \n& Scott, supra, at 1014. \n122.  Their susceptibility to outside pressure is explained, at least in part, by the \nprevailing circumstance that juveniles have less control, or less experience with control, over \ntheir own environment.  Id. \n123.  It is no surprise, therefore, that psychologists have concluded that juveniles “lack \nthe freedom that adults have to extricate themselves from a criminogenic setting”.  Id. \n124.  A third area of difference between adults and adolescents is that the character of a \njuvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult.  Specifically, psychologists and psychoanalysts \nhave recognized that the personality traits of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed.  See \ngenerally, Erik H. Erikson, Identity: Youth and Crisis (1968); see also Steinberg & Scott, supra, \nat 1014. \n125.  Although these three inherently transitory characteristics of juveniles often lead \nthem to commit crimes, psychologists have recognized that, for most teenagers, their impulsive \nand risky behaviors “cease with maturity” as their identities become settled, they learn to \nconsider long-term consequences of potential actions prior to making choices, and they gain the \nresources and capacities to extricate themselves from negative influences.  Steinberg & Scott, \nsupra, at 1014. \n126.  As adolescents mature into adults, they gain an improved perspective on long-\nterm consequences, become more risk-averse and gain the self-regulatory capacities to conform \n31 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 32 of 69\ntheir actions to moral evaluation.  Kristin Henning, supra, at 272.  They “also come to regret \ndecisions they made in earlier years”.  Id.  \n127.  The behavior of adolescents evolves so much as they grow up that studies \nrecognize that “[o]nly a relatively small proportion of adolescents who experiment in risky or \nillegal activities develop entrenched patterns of problem behavior that persist into adulthood”.  \nSteinberg & Scott, supra, at 1014 (citations omitted). \nB.  The law has traditionally viewed children differently.  \n128.  Courts and legislatures have long recognized that children are not fully \npsychologically and socially developed, are susceptible to persuasion and abuse, and are marked \nby judgmental inexperience such that it is appropriate to limit their ability as a class to vote, \nmarry, serve on juries, drink alcohol, gamble, leave school and otherwise exercise full autonomy \nunder the law.  See J.D.B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.S. 261, 272-77 (2011). \n129.  The inherent characteristics of children have been recognized in the area of \npunishment in a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions.  Specifically, the U.S. Supreme Court \nrecognized that three distinctive attributes of juveniles mitigate their culpability:  juveniles have \ntransient immaturity; they are vulnerable to external forces; and their character traits are still \nbeing formed.  Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 733; Miller, 567 U.S. at 470-71; Graham, 560 U.S. at \n68; Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-70 (2005).   \n130.  By recognizing the psychological and social characteristics of children, these \ndecisions established constitutional limitations on the punishment that can be imposed on \nchildren, even for very serious crimes, reasoning that “children are constitutionally different \nfrom adults for purposes of sentencing” because they have “diminished culpability and greater \n32 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 33 of 69\nprospects for reform”.  Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 733 (quoting Miller, 567 U.S. at 471 (citing \nRoper, 543 U.S. at 569-70; Graham, 560 U.S. at 68)).   \n131.  In Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 572 (2005), the U.S. Supreme Court \ncategorically outlawed the death penalty for juvenile offenders, even those convicted of the most \nheinous murders, concluding that “neither retribution nor deterrence provides adequate \njustification for imposing the death penalty on juvenile offenders”. \n132.  In Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010), the U.S. Supreme Court held that \nsentencing a juvenile to life in prison without parole for crimes other than murder violates the \nEighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and usual punishment, specifically for non-homicide offenses. \n133.  In Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the \nEighth Amendment prohibits a sentencing scheme that requires life in prison without the \npossibility of parole for juvenile homicide offenders. \n134.  In Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. 718 (2016), the U.S. Supreme Court held \nthat Miller v. Alabama announced a substantive rule which, under the Constitution, is retroactive \nin cases on state collateral review. \n135.  In United States v. Reingold, 731 F.3d 204 (2d Cir. 2013), the Second Circuit \nreiterated the categorical prohibition of mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles. \n136.  These cases hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids a statutory scheme that \n(i) imposes life sentences upon minors who are not the rarest of irredeemable juveniles whose \ncrimes reflects permanent incorrigibility, and (ii) fails to provide those whose crimes reflect \nunfortunate yet transient immaturity with a meaningful and realistic opportunity for release.  \nNew York law fails this test on both accounts.  This rule is based on substantive constitutional \n33 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 34 of 69\nprinciples of proportionality governing punishment for juvenile lifers based on their diminished \nculpability and enhanced capacity for reform.  \nC.  Life sentences imposed on children are unconstitutional absent a parole \nscheme that provides a meaningful and realistic opportunity to obtain release \nbased on demonstrated rehabilitation and reform.  \n137.  “The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment \nguarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions.  That right . . . flows \nfrom the basic precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned \nto both the offender and the offense”.  Miller, 567 U.S. at 469 (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). \n138.  Accordingly, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that “sentencing a child to life \nwithout parole is [unconstitutionally] excessive for all but the ‘rare juvenile offender whose \ncrime reflects irreparable corruption’”.  Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734 (quoting Miller, 567 U.S. \nat 479-80).  States “must impose a sentence that provides some meaningful opportunity for \nrelease based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation”.  Graham, 560 U.S. at 50. \n139.  That holding has both “substantive” and “procedural component[s]”.  \nMontgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734-35.  Because of its substantive nature, the U.S. Supreme Court \nhas held that this constitutional rule applies retroactively.  Id. \n140.  As a matter of “substantive right”, it is unconstitutional to imprison for life \nwithout parole a juvenile “whose crimes reflect unfortunate yet transient immaturity” rather than \n“irreparable corruption”.  Miller, 567 U.S. at 479-80.  In furtherance of this substantive right, the \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized that a juvenile’s “demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation” \nis what entitles him to a “meaningful opportunity to obtain release”.  Id. at 479 (citing Graham, \n560 U.S. at 75). \n34 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 35 of 69\n141.  As a “procedural” matter, “a sentencer [must] consider a juvenile offender’s youth \nand attendant characteristics before determining that life without parole” is “proportionate” to the \noffense.  Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734.  The sentencer does not have unfettered discretion to \ntreat youth as a mere “factor” and assign said factor the weight he or she chooses.  Rather, youth \nis a constitutionally relevant status that makes certain forms of punishment unlawful.  The status \nof youth triggers the substantive guarantee that a juvenile not be imprisoned for life for a crime \nthat reflects transient characteristics of youth because to do so would be to impose a \ndisproportionate punishment. \n142.  Accordingly, the sentencer must “d[o] more than [merely] consider a juvenile \noffender’s youth before imposing life without parole”, id. at 734 (emphasis added), and must \ninstead analyze whether the crime reflects transient factors of youth or permanent incorrigibility.  \nId.  \n143.  Proceedings bearing on life sentences for juvenile offenders must, in order to \navoid being categorically unconstitutional, afford juvenile lifers who have evolved from a \ntroubled, misguided youth to a model inmate, a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that \nchildren who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change.  Id. at 724. \n144.  Accordingly, sentencing regimes that subject juvenile offenders to life with the \npossibility of parole are only constitutional insofar as the state provides a “meaningful \nopportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation”.  Miller, 567 \nU.S. at 479 (quoting Graham, 560 U.S. at 75). \n145.  Those substantive and procedural rights apply at parole hearings where a person \nwho committed a crime as a child faces possible life imprisonment if parole is denied.  After all, \n“[a] parole board is no more entitled to subject an offender to the penalty of life in prison in \n35 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 36 of 69\ncontravention of this rule than is a legislature or a sentencing court”.  Hawkins v. New York \nState Dep’t of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 140 A.D.3d 34, 38 (3d Dep’t 2016); Putland v. New \nYork State Dep’t of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 158 A.D.3d 633 (2d Dep’t 2018). \n146.  The U.S. Supreme Court allows life with parole sentences only because it \nunderstands parole to be “a regular part of the rehabilitative process.  Assuming good behavior, \n[parole] is the normal expectation in the vast majority of cases”.  Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, \n300-01 (1983) (citations omitted). \nII. NEW YORK SUBJECTS JUVENILE LIFERS TO UNCONSTITUTIONALLY \nDISPROPORTIONATE PUNISHMENT BY DENYING THEM A MEANINGFUL \nAND REALISTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR RELEASE BASED ON DEMONSTRATED \nMATURITY AND REHABILITATION. \nA.  New York sentencing law mandates life with the possibility of parole for \njuvenile offenders as young as 13 years old. \n147.  Under New York sentencing law, children aged 16 and 17 are sentenced to an \nindeterminate sentence with a mandatory maximum term of life imprisonment if convicted of a \nclass A felony, with the minimum term for a class A-I felony ranging from 15 to 25 years.  N.Y. \nPenal Law §§ 70.00(2)(a), 70.00(3)(a)(i).  Children as young as 13 years old who are convicted \nof murder receive an automatic maximum sentence of life in prison with opportunity for parole.  \nN.Y. CPL §§ 1.20(42), 180; N.Y. Penal Law § 70.05(2)(a). \n148.  Under the New York Penal Law, a defendant’s age and maturity, the transient \ncharacteristics attendant to youth, and a defendant’s capacity for rehabilitation play no role \nwhatsoever in setting the maximum sentence for those convicted of murder or other class A-I \nfelonies for which the mandatory maximum sentence is life.  \n36 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 37 of 69\n149.  The only mechanism, under New York law, by which the substantive right of \njuvenile lifers to be provided with a meaningful opportunity for release can be secured is through \nthe Board of Parole.  \nB.  New York parole law fails to afford juvenile lifers a meaningful and realistic \nopportunity for release upon rehabilitation. \n150.  The New York parole practices and procedures fail to provide juvenile lifers a \n“meaningful” or “realistic” opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation.  \n151.  The Board of Parole has interpreted the New York Executive Law to allow it to \ndeny parole to juvenile lifers if Defendants, in their subjective judgment, without regard to the \nindividual’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation subsequent to the crime, believe that \nrelease would be “not compatible with the welfare of society” or would “so deprecate the \nseriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law”.  See N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-i(2)(c)(A).   \n152.  Defendant Stanford told the Senate Crime Victims, Crime and Correction \nCommittee on February 15, 2018, that she understands the statutory language “deprecate the \nseriousness of the offense as to undermine respect for the law” to permit Commissioners to deny \nparole if they, in their personal opinion, believe that release for particular offenders who \ncommitted serious crimes “would so undermine respect for the law in the mind of the community \n[the offenders] would be going back to”.  Defendant Stanford termed this consideration as \n“community opposition” although it is not statutorily authorized under New York’s Executive \nLaw. \n153.  As a result, Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, juvenile lifers release \nto parole supervision based only on the crime committed or juvenile criminal history, despite \nclear evidence of rehabilitation and maturity. \n37 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 38 of 69\n154.  Defendants’ failures are illustrated in their treatment of the Named Plaintiffs.   \n155.  Defendants denied parole ten times to Plaintiff Carlos Flores, who had been \nincarcerated for 37 years, had a “low risk across the board” COMPAS risk assessment and had \nnot had a disciplinary ticket in 25 years.   \n156.  Despite Mr. Flores’s impeccable record, on October 24, 2017, Defendants Smith, \nCrangle and Demosthenes denied Mr. Flores release to parole supervision stating, without \nsubstantiation, that “discretionary release is not warranted due to concern for the public safety \nand welfare” and that “release at this time would not be compatible with the welfare of society \nand would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the Instant Offense and undermine respect for the \nlaw”.  The only treatment in Defendants’ decision given to Mr. Flores’s juvenile status at the \ntime of the offense was relegated to the following conclusory, passive voice statement: “[y]our \nage at the time of the offense, family situation and lack of maturity is noted”.   \n157.  On May 23, 2018—after Mr. Flores’s fourth hearing in just over two-and-a-half \nyears—he was granted parole release on the basis of the following factors:  “In prison you have \nparticipated in all recommended programs, have earned a Bachelor’s Degree, have put together a \nsolid release plan, gained insight and exhibited remorse for the victim’s family.  Your record \nfeatures a clean disciplinary record for over twenty-five years, and your overall low risk and \nneed scores is noted”.  Tellingly, the “factors” cited to approve release were identical to the \nfactors present at Mr. Flores’s prior hearings but were dismissed as insufficient to warrant \nrelease out of concern for the welfare of society three times in the prior years.  The panel also \nnoted in its grant decision that Mr. Flores’s release “should not be interpreted as mitigating or \ndiscounting [his] participation in the felony murder of an off-duty police officer”.  The only new \nfactor was his status as a named representative in this lawsuit. \n38 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 39 of 69\n158.  Defendants also denied parole release to Plaintiff Lawrence Bartley at his LCTA \ninterview, which he earned for “significant programmatic accomplishment” and an excellent \ndisciplinary record.  Defendants Cruse and Drake acknowledged Mr. Bartley’s “exceptional \npacket, institutional accomplishments . . . overall low COMPAS score and satisfactory case plan \n. . . release planning, community outreach, use of media, networking and your life as an example \nexemplifies an extraordinary effort to give back, [sic] demonstrates restoration and evidenced \nchange”.  On September 6, 2017, they nevertheless concluded, without any basis, that “there is a \nreasonable probability that you would not live and remain at liberty without again violating the \nlaw and that your release would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so \ndeprecate the serious nature of the crime as to undermine respect for the law”.  Defendants Cruse \nand Drake also cited opposition to Mr. Bartley’s release.  Their decision, however, failed to even \nmention that Mr. Bartley was a juvenile at the time of the offense or consider the hallmark \nfeatures of youth as they relate to culpability or the constitutional relevance of the exceptional \nevidence of maturity and rehabilitation.   \n159.  On April 9, 2018, Mr. Bartley was granted parole.  The factors cited in support of \nhis release include “your age of 17 at the time of the offense including the diminished culpability \nof youth and the growth and maturity since the time of the offense; your low risk assessment \nscores; your efforts toward rehabilitation including your receipt of LCTA; your expression of \nremorse for the victim as well as his family and your efforts to apologize to your victims; your \nrelease plans, letters of support and reasonable assurance from your family members, official \nletters including your attorney’s letter; letters from facility personnel, prospective employers and \nothers; commendable behavior reports and letters of commendation received; your parole packet; \n39 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 40 of 69\nsentencing minutes; your programs completions throughout your sentence; good disciplinary and \ninstitutional record”.   \n160.  These factors were identical to the factors present seven months previously when \nDefendants concluded in September 2017 that parole should be denied because “there is \nreasonable probability that you would not live and remain at liberty without again violating the \nlaw and that your release would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so \ndeprecate the serious nature of the crime as to undermine respect for the law”.  In April 2018, \nDefendants affirmed that Mr. Bartley’s “release should in no way be interpreted as mitigating or \ndiscounting the seriousness of [his] actions and the terrible loss of life [he] caused”.  The only \nnew factor in April 2018 was his status as a named representative in this lawsuit. \n161.  By the time he was granted release in September 2018, Defendants had denied \nparole release eight times to Demetrius Bennett, who has been incarcerated 14 years beyond his \nminimum sentence and has demonstrated growth over his 23 years of incarceration.  On \nSeptember 13, 2017, Defendants Thompson, Agostini and Davis denied Mr. Bennett release to \nparole supervision stating, without substantiation, that the “panel is not convinced that if released \nyou would live at liberty without once again violating the law or that your release would not so \ndeprecate the offense as to undermine respect for the law”.  The decision’s consideration of \nyouth was to note in passing that Mr. Bennett was “15 years old at the time and [was] following \nthe lead of [his] friends and their uncle”.     \n162.  Defendants further denied parole release to Plaintiff Edgardo Lebron ten times.  \nAt Mr. Lebron’s November 23, 2016 hearing, Defendants found the nature of the crime to be \n“more compelling” than Mr. Lebron’s COMPAS scores, institutional programming, release plans \nand improved disciplinary record.  Notably, however, when Mr. Lebron was granted parole in \n40 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 41 of 69\nAugust 2018, the only new positive factor in his record was his status as a named representative \nin this lawsuit. \n163.  In addition, by the time he was granted release in September 2018, Defendants \nhad denied parole release to Plaintiff Antonio Roman three times despite significant evidence of \nrehabilitation and maturity.  The decision from Mr. Roman’s September 20, 2016 hearing \nfocused substantially on the nature of the crime of conviction, rather than his youth at the time of \nthe crime.  The Commissioners noted that they had “considered [his] age at the time of the crime \nand diminished culpability at the time”, but nonetheless ultimately denied release, stating that \nMr. Roman’s “release would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so deprecate \nthe serious nature of the crime . . . as to undermine respect for the law”.   \n164.  In addition, Defendants denied parole release to Plaintiff Dontae Quinones three \ntimes despite his demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  While Defendants briefly referred to \nMr. Quinones’s age at the time of the offense, Defendants’ denial decision from Mr. Quinones’s \nOctober 4, 2017 hearing focused on the “seriousness of the crime” and concluded that \nMr. Quinones’s “release would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so \ndeprecate the seriousness of the instant offense as to undermine respect for the law”.   \n165.  Defendants also have denied parole release to Plaintiff Sharod Logan despite his \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  While, at Mr. Logan’s December 19, 2017 hearing, \nDefendants briefly referred to Mr. Logan’s age at the time of the offense, the Commissioners \nfound his disciplinary tickets—the vast majority of which he received when he was initially \nincarcerated over a decade ago—more compelling than his more recent evidence of maturity and \nrehabilitation.  Ultimately, the Commissioners concluded that Mr. Logan’s “release would be \n41 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 42 of 69\nincompatible with the welfare of society and would so deprecate the seriousness of the offense as \nto undermine respect for the law”. \n166.  As evidenced by their denial of release to the Named Plaintiffs, Defendants \ncontinue to deny juvenile lifers release to parole supervision even after they have demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation.  \n167.  Defendants’ reliance on the nature of a juvenile crime, prior juvenile record, \njuvenile disciplinary history, and “official”, “community” or victim opposition, to deny release \ndeprives juvenile lifers of the opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation.  This opportunity is required to bring life with parole sentencing regimes into \ncompliance with the Eighth Amendment’s proscription against disproportionate punishment.  \nC.  The Board of Parole willfully violates the rights of juvenile lifers.  \n168.  In 2016, the Third Department of New York State Supreme Court, Appellate \nDivision found the Board of Parole in violation of clearly established law under the Eighth \nAmendment because, “[t]he Board, as the entity charged with determining whether [Hawkins] \nwill serve a life sentence, was required to consider the significance of [Hawkins’s] youth and its \nattendant circumstances at the time of the commission of the crime before making a parole \ndetermination.”  Hawkins, 140 A.D.3d 34, 36 (3d Dep’t 2016).  \n169.  In response to the Hawkins decision and the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \nMontgomery, the Board eventually gave notice of proposed regulations that reflected \nDefendants’ official position regarding their legal obligations under the Eighth Amendment and \nthe Due Process Clause.  Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, Proposed \nRulemaking, I.D. No. CCS-39-16-00004-P (Sept. 28, 2016). \n42 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 43 of 69\n170.  The proposed regulations provided that an inmate’s juvenile status at the time of \nthe crime for which he or she is currently serving an indeterminate life sentence is merely one of \nmany factors that the Board must “consider”, and continued to permit Defendants to deny parole \nbased solely on their subjective assessment of the crime of conviction.  Dep’t of Corrections and \nCommunity Supervision, Proposed Rulemaking, I.D. No. CCS-39-16-00004-P (Sept. 28, 2016).  \nNumerous comments pointed out to the Board that the proposed regulations were facially \ninadequate to ensure that the hundreds of juvenile lifers currently incarcerated in DOCCS \ncustody receive a meaningful opportunity for release because the regulations did not require the \nBoard to base its release determination on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  \n171.  Even after the Hawkins decision and the notice of the proposed regulations, but \nprior to the adoption of the proposed regulations, the Board continued to interpret its power in a \nmanner inconsistent with the constitutional rule.  In Mr. Roman’s February 2017 administrative \nappeal decision, the Appeals Unit affirmed the Board’s September 2016 denial decision and \nrejected Mr. Roman’s argument that the Board ignored that he was only 17 years old at the time \nof the crime.  The Appeals Unit held that “the Board interview and decision was very much \naware of this mandated factor and discussed and reviewed it thoroughly”.  However, the only \ndiscussion of Mr. Roman’s age at the time of the crime during the September 2016 interview was \nthe following:  “We recognize that 17-year-olds have somewhat of a diminished capacity \ncompared to adults”.  The parole denial decision merely states that “the panel has considered \nyour young age at the time of the crime and diminished culpability”.  Furthermore, in \nMr. Roman’s administrative appeal decision, the Appeals Unit stated the following: “Nothing in \nthe due process clause requires the Parole Board to specify the particular evidence on which rests \nthe discretionary determination an inmate is not ready for conditional release. . . . There is no due \n43 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 44 of 69\nprocess requirement that the Parole Board disclose its release criteria”.  The Appeals Unit also \nstated that “[t]he Board may deny parole release without the existence of any aggravating \nfactors, no matter how exemplary the institutional record is”.   \n172.  Despite the objections to the proposed regulations, the Board formally adopted \nthese regulations, which became effective on September 27, 2017, without substantive changes \nand without curing the constitutional defects in them.    \n173.  Subsequent to the adoption of the new regulations, and demonstrating their \ninadequacy, Plaintiff Carlos Flores was again denied parole based solely on the nature of his \ncrime and without a meaningful opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation.  Defendants Smith, Crangle and Demosthenes failed to apply the constitutionally \nmandated standard to the ample evidence of Mr. Flores’s rehabilitation and maturation.  They \nignored the Board’s own COMPAS instrument finding Mr. Flores to be a low risk for \nreoffending; they ignored the fact that he had not had a disciplinary ticket in the past 25 years; \nand they ignored the fact that he was a 54-year-old man who had served 16 years beyond the \nminimum term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge in full light of the facts of the \ncrime.  Instead, Defendants Smith, Crangle and Demosthenes denied Mr. Flores release on the \nunsubstantiated formulaic “conclusion” that his “discretionary release at this time, would not be \ncompatible with the welfare of society and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant \noffense and undermine respect for the law”.  \n174.  This decision was administratively appealed on December 15, 2017, with a \nlengthy submission by counsel for Mr. Flores explaining, yet again, the constitutional standard \nthat the Board must follow when considering the applications for parole by juvenile lifers. \n44 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 45 of 69\n175.  On March 6, 2018, the Board decided the administrative appeal.  The Parole \nBoard Appeals Unit, including Defendant Chairwoman Stanford, ordered a de novo interview on \nthe basis that Commissioners did not explain what “course of conduct, before, during, and after” \nthe crime 36 years ago it found concerning.  Notably, it refused to instruct Commissioners that \nthe Eighth Amendment requires Defendants to release Mr. Flores to parole supervision if he has \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation and instead affirmed the unlawful standard under which \nit had denied Mr. Flores’s release stating, in part, that “the applicable principles and factors were \ndiscussed and considered by the Board in reaching its determination”.  \n176.  Defendants showed similar disregard for their obligations under applicable \nconstitutional law in deciding the administrative appeal of Mr. Bartley’s September 6, 2017 \ndenial.  On November 7, 2017, counsel submitted a lengthy brief perfecting the appeal \nidentifying the numerous substantive and procedural defects in Defendants’ consideration that \ndenied Mr. Bartley a meaningful opportunity for release, including Defendants’ failure to render \ntheir decision based on Mr. Bartley’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  In February \n2018, the Appeals Unit, including Defendant Chairwoman Stanford, ordered a new hearing on \nthe sole basis that Defendants failed to seek the recommendation of his trial attorney in advance \nof the interview in violation of N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-i(2)(c)(A)(vii).  The Appeals Unit refused \nto issue any findings of fact or law that would prevent the same defects from infecting his future \ninterview and the panel’s deliberation process.   \n177.  Defendants again demonstrated disregard for their obligations under applicable \nconstitutional law in deciding the administrative appeal of Mr. Delima’s August 22, 2017 denial.  \nOn March 26, 2018, Mr. Delima’s counsel submitted a lengthy brief perfecting the appeal \ndemonstrating that the Board’s hearing and denial failed to provide Mr. Delima with a \n45 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 46 of 69\nmeaningful opportunity for release and that the Commissioners treated his youthful age as an \naggravating factor because COMPAS appears to use his age as the main predictive factor for his \nhigh scores.  Mr. Delima’s counsel demonstrated that Defendants denied parole even though \nMr. Delima’s crime reflected the transient characteristics of youth and Mr. Delima has \nsubsequently demonstrated his rehabilitation and maturity.  Consistent with the Commissioners’ \ninterpretation of their obligations under the Eighth Amendment as codified in the current \nregulations, the Appeals Unit affirmed the decision of the Board in June 2018, concluding that \nthe Board was “aware of his youth and its [sic] transient immaturity”.  The Appeals Unit held \nthat Commissioners are “entitled to give whatever weight it feels to each factor” and that “denial \nof parole release primarily because of the severity of the crime is appropriate.” \n178.  Also subsequent to the adoption of the new regulations, and demonstrating the \ninadequacy of parole hearings, Plaintiff Sharod Logan was denied parole based on his youthful \ndisciplinary record and without a meaningful opportunity for release based on demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation.  Defendants Alexander, Berliner and Drake denied parole release to \nMr. Logan at his December 19, 2017 hearing despite his current maturity and rehabilitation.  \nDefendants ignored the Board’s own COMPAS instrument finding Mr. Logan to be at a low risk \nfor reoffending and that he had demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  Again, Defendants \ndenied parole with their customary boilerplate language that “there is a reasonable probability \nthatif [sic] released at this time, [Mr. Logan] would not live and remain at liberty without again \nviolating the law”, and thus that his “release would be incompatible with the welfare of society” \nand would “undermine respect for the law”. \n179.  Also subsequent to the adoption of the new regulations, and demonstrating the \ninadequacy of parole hearings, Plaintiff Dontae Quinones was again denied parole based solely \n46 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 47 of 69\non the nature of his crime and without a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  Defendants Crangle, Coppola and Cruse denied parole \nrelease to Mr. Quinones at his October 4, 2017 hearing based on the “seriousness of the crime”, \nrather than his current maturity and rehabilitation.  Defendants ignored the Board’s own \nCOMPAS instrument finding Mr. Quinones to be at a low risk for reoffending; they ignored the \nfact that he has not had a disciplinary ticket in several years; and they ignored the fact that he is \nnow a 43-year-old man who has served several years beyond the minimum term of imprisonment \nimposed by the sentencing judge in full light of the facts of the crime.  Instead, Defendants \ndenied parole to Mr. Quinones based on Defendants’ customary boilerplate language that release \nwas “incompatible with the welfare of society” and would “undermine respect for the law”.   \n180.  Commissioners appear to believe that their obligations under the Eighth \nAmendment and Hawkins—as codified in the regulations proposed in 2016 and adopted in \nSeptember 2017 without any substantive changes—are satisfied by merely acknowledging \npetitioners’ age at the time of the crime.  In Mr. Quinones’s administrative appeal decision, dated \nFebruary 6, 2018, Defendants held that “[i]t is not improper for the Board to base its decision to \ndeny parole release on the seriousness of the offense(s), nor is the Board required to expressly \ndiscuss in its determination each of the factors it considered or to give equal weight to each \nfactor it considered”.  Moreover, Defendants mistakenly held that “denial of release to \ncommunity supervision primarily because of the gravity of the inmate’s crime is appropriate” \nand that Eighth Amendment jurisprudence requires Defendants to only “consider” \nMr. Quinones’s youth at the time of the crime (i.e., Defendants are simply required to \nacknowledge the chronological fact of age at the time of the crime).  Consistent with the \nCommissioners’ interpretation of their obligations under the Eighth Amendment as codified in \n47 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 48 of 69\nthe current regulations, the Appeals Unit affirmed the Defendants’ hearing and denial decision \nbecause Commissioners “discussed and considered” Mr. Quinones’s age at the time of the crime.   \n181.  Since Hawkins, a number of New York State courts have found Defendants in \nviolation of their legal obligation to provide persons serving indeterminate life sentences with a \nmeaningful opportunity for release.  See, e.g., Martin v. Stanford, 58 Misc. 3d 345 (N.Y. Sup. \nCt., Cayuga County 2017); Darshan v. New York State Dep’t of Corrs. & Cmty. Supervision, \nNo. 652/2017 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Dutchess County July 18, 2017); Putland v. New York State Dep’t \nof Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 158 A.D.3d 633 (2d Dep’t 2018); Ruiz v. New York State Div. of \nParole, No. 2310-2017 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Dutchess County Apr. 5, 2018).  The plaintiffs in these \ncases were all released after the court decisions, one after serving decades beyond his minimum \nsentence. \n182.  Defendants continue to conduct unlawful hearings and refuse to extend requisite \nprocedural protections necessary to secure Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ substantive rights.  \nD.  The Board of Parole’s procedures violate the law. \n183.  The sheer volume of work before Defendants precludes the opportunity for Class \nMembers to be meaningfully heard and to receive decisions rendered based on demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation.   \n184.  Although the State is authorized to staff the Board of Parole with 19 members, it \nis currently staffed by 14 Commissioners.  These 14 Commissioners must conduct approximately \n12,000 parole interviews annually, in addition to sitting on appeals panels, staffing \nsubcommittees, conducting victim impact interviews, traveling for interviews and engaging in \nadministrative upkeep.  \n48 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 49 of 69\n185.  Interview panels consist of two to three Commissioners.  Each week, each panel \nis assigned approximately 40 to 70 interviews, which are usually conducted over only two \ndays—Tuesday and Wednesday—as Mondays are reserved for travel and Fridays are reserved \nfor victim interviews.  The majority of interviews are conducted by video conference.  This \nmeans each panel interviews between 20 and 35 applicants a day.  \n186.  Each of these applicants typically submits supporting materials (a “parole \npacket”), which include a personal statement, programmatic achievements and letters of support.  \nThe parole packet may contain hundreds of pages of material. \n187.  Defendant Stanford has testified that these parole files and packets are sometimes \ndelivered by prison staff and Offender Rehabilitation Counselors (“ORCs”) to the field office \nwhere the video conferences take place on Monday, the day before the interviews.  She has also \ntestified that Defendants often do not receive the parole files and packets prior to the morning of \nthe interviews.  \n188.  Defendant Stanford has testified that Commissioners typically arrive in the city or \ntown where the video conferencing of the interviews will take place on Monday the day or \nevening before the interviews, which begin at 8 a.m. the following morning.  \n189.  Once Commissioners arrive in a city on Monday, they check into assigned hotels \nand, according to Defendant Chairwoman Stanford, they may then review parole files if the files \nhave been delivered, in their hotel rooms, “at their leisure”.  \n190.  No regulation or policy requires Defendants to read parole materials before \nconducting an interview and making release decisions, and, according to Defendant Stanford, \n“not everyone does it”.  \n49 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 50 of 69\n191.  On information and belief, Defendants often see the files for the first time at \n8 a.m. on the day of the interviews. \n192.  The Board divides the weekly interview caseload by the total seated \nCommissioners to assign a “lead” Commissioner to each case.  During the interviews, only the \nlead Commissioner has a copy of the entire parole file.  The full file may contain hundreds of \npages of material documenting rehabilitation and reform, including:  \n•  personal statements composed by the parole applicant; \n•  detailed release plans; \n•  vocational accomplishments; \n•  programming completion; \n•  educational achievements; \n•  educational transcripts; \n•  letters from family members showing support; \n•  letters from those who have had personal contact with the applicant \nsupporting release and describing the reasons why they feel the applicant is \nsafe to release; \n•  job offers; \n•  drug and alcohol treatment completion certificates; \n•  commendable behavior reports; \n•  prison work assignment assessments; and \n•  statements of remorse or essays written by the applicant discussing insight \ninto his or her crime.  \n193.  Defendant Stanford has testified that the one or two Commissioners other than the \nlead Commissioner have only what is called a “book copy”, which includes only four things:  a \ncondensed version of the Parole Board Report (a one-page sheet consisting primarily of \ncheckboxes with basic information such as the applicant’s birth date, crimes of commitment, \n50 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 51 of 69\nwhether there are sentencing minutes or not, etc.), the COMPAS report, a modified rap sheet and \nthe applicant’s disciplinary record.  \n194.  Defendant Stanford has testified that the “book copy” contains all of the \ninformation necessary to the decision and that all other information is “less pertinent”. \n195.  Notably, the “book copy” does not include letters of support, personal statements, \ncommendable behavior reports or any of the most relevant and detailed materials that would \ndemonstrate rehabilitation, remorse, reform and suitability for community reentry.  \n196.  The lead Commissioner typically asks all of the questions in the interview.  \n197.  Although Defendant Stanford testified that interviews typically last 20 minutes, \non information and belief, inmates often have less than 10 minutes to make their case for release \nbecause the bulk of the “interview” consists of the lead Commissioner recounting the details of \nthe crime; longer interviews are usually provided only where the applicant is represented by \ncounsel or if the prior determination was overturned by a reviewing court.  \n198.  On information and belief, during the interview the other Commissioners are \noften not listening to the questions and answers during the pending interview, but instead are \npreparing for subsequent hearings on which they must take the “lead”.  \n199.  Despite this lack of materials and information or direct engagement from the non-\nlead Commissioners in a given interview, each Commissioner on the panel has an equal vote to \ngrant or deny release. \n200.  On information and belief, outcomes are often predetermined prior to the \ninterview and sometimes decision language is pre-written on a typed form denial.  This is a clear \nviolation of the “guarantee against arbitrary and irrational government action”, which includes \nthe “right to a hearing before a fact-finder that has not predetermined the outcome of the \n51 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 52 of 69\nhearing”.  Duffy v. Evans, No. 11 Civ. 7605 JMF, 2012 WL 4327605, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 19, \n2012). \n201.  To the extent the decision was not predetermined, the “deliberations” typically \nlast between two to five minutes immediately following the interview and prior to commencing \nthe next interview.  The final decision is then read into the record and transcribed by the \nstenographer. \n202.  On any given hearing day, a Board of Parole panel will potentially conduct 20 to \n35 interviews in less than eight hours.  Defendants, therefore, lack the time or inclination to read \nand evaluate the materials presented to them in the information packets, and routinely show up \nunprepared for the parole interviews (as occurred in many of the most recent interviews of the \nNamed Plaintiffs).  \n203.  These procedural inadequacies are exacerbated because the Board does not permit \ncounsel to appear or give statements at parole interviews.  \ni.  Commissioners have no training on which to base their decisions and do \nnot solicit expert evaluations of the maturation and rehabilitation of \njuvenile lifers. \n204.  On information and belief, 12 of the 14 Defendants have no substantial training in \nany discipline—such as child psychology, criminology or social work—that would enable them \nto competently evaluate whether an underlying crime reflected the transient immaturity or youth \nor instead permanent incorrigibility. \n205.  Commissioners do not seek input from experts competent to attest to the extent of \nmaturation and rehabilitation of juvenile lifers eligible for parole release.  \n206.  The Board does not make available funds for inmates to retain their own \nexperts—such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers or criminologists—who could \n52 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 53 of 69\nopine on whether the underlying crime reflected transient immaturity or permanent \nincorrigibility and whether the inmate has demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  \n207.  The prevalence of mental impairments among juvenile offenders is substantially \nhigher than among adolescents who are not involved with the justice system.  See generally, Lee \nUnderwood & Aryssa Washington, Mental Illness and Juvenile Offenders, 13 Int. J. Environ. \nRes. & Pub. Health 228 (2016).  Lack of access to psychological experts significantly raises the \nrisk that a person serving a life sentence for crimes committed as a juvenile is denied parole \nbased on undiagnosed psychiatric or cognitive impairments, which are often untreated in prison.  \nSee id.  \nii.  Commissioners improperly use risk assessment tools.  \n208.  Due process requires, at a minimum, that parole release decisions be made based \non accurate information.  See, e.g., United States v. Romano, 825 F.2d 725, 728 (2d Cir. 1987) \n(citing Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 741 (1948)). \n209.  The Board relies upon a risk and needs tool, called COMPAS, that does not \nspecifically consider the diminished culpability of juveniles and the hallmark features of youth.  \n210.  On information and belief, COMPAS fails to incorporate juvenile rehabilitative \ncapacities into its algorithm.  \n211.  On information and belief, COMPAS sometimes treats youth as an aggravating \nfactor.  For example, it counts as negative not having a job prior to incarceration, not being \nmarried and the age of first offense, includes juvenile justice encounters at very young ages in \nthe criminal involvement score and uses Plaintiffs’ current age to predict risk of felony violence.  \nDefendants’ use of COMPAS thereby disadvantages Plaintiffs and Class Members who were \nsentenced as juveniles to serve longer sentences than their adult counterparts. \n53 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 54 of 69\n212.  For example, Mr. Delima was only 13 years old at the time of his crime and has a \nhigh “risk of felony violence” score on his COMPAS by virtue of his youth.  On information and \nbelief, Mr. Delima’s high “risk of felony violence” score relies on criminological actuarial tables \nthat classify individuals within a group and assess risk based on certain shared characteristics \nwith others in that group.  On information and belief, one of the most important determinants of \nthis particular score is the inmate’s current age.  Therefore, very young juvenile offenders, such \nas Mr. Delima, who have served their minimum sentences and are parole-eligible in their \ntwenties, are statistically predicted to have high risk for felony violence and will be denied parole \nirrespective of their rehabilitation and reform.   \n213.  COMPAS is a commercial product sold by Northpointe Inc.  On information and \nbelief, Defendants either have not asked Northpointe to disclose its secret algorithms or have \nacquiesced in the refusal by Northpointe to do so.  As a result, COMPAS is a black box.  \nDefendants’ reliance upon COMPAS, without knowing how or whether COMPAS considers the \ndiminished culpability of juveniles and the hallmark features of youth, fails to comply with \nDefendants’ legal obligations. \n214.  Plaintiffs and Class Members lack knowledge and are denied information about \nhow their COMPAS scores are calculated, what variables enter into the scores, how variables are \nweighted in the algorithmic prediction, how the scores can be improved through rehabilitative \nefforts and whether there is any way to challenge the inclusion of erroneous information.  \nPlaintiffs and Class Members also have no way of knowing or contesting if impermissible \nfactors—such as age, race, family, poverty, or sex—function as aggregating variables in the \npredictive instrument.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs and Class Members are denied a \nmeaningful opportunity for release based on individualized information and personal \n54 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 55 of 69\nrehabilitation and reform because the scores are based on statistical facts about membership in a \nsupposed statistical group. \n215.  On information and belief, Commissioners do not know or understand how the \nscores are generated because Northpointe considers COMPAS a proprietary instrument and a \ntrade secret.    \n216.  Defendants have also refused to verify whether the COMPAS tool has been \nvalidated for youth or for developmental or mental disabilities, which are both overrepresented in \nthe population of serious juvenile offenders. \niii.  Commissioners use prior youthful criminal involvement or disciplinary \ntickets received as a juvenile as reasons for denying parole to juvenile \nlifers. \n217.  On information and belief, Defendants have access to and cite to previous \ninvolvement in the juvenile justice system and inmates’ disciplinary records from their time in \nOffice of Children and Family Services (“OCSF”) facilities as evidence that applicants are \nunsuitable for release.   \n218.  For example, in the middle of Mr. Bartley’s September 6, 2017 parole hearing, \nDefendant Cruse indicated that he would consider Mr. Bartley’s disciplinary tickets in reaching a \nrelease decision, and the subsequent denial decision cited to Mr. Bartley’s prior youthful \ncriminal conviction as one of the reasons for denying his release.  In addition, in upholding \nMr. Delima’s August 2017 parole denial, the Appeals Unit held that the “Board could cite the \nappellant’s juvenile record in denying parole release” and could “properly rely on appellant’s \nYouthful Offender (‘YO’) adjudication as one of the reasons for denying him release to parole \nsupervision”.  \n55 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 56 of 69\n219.  Defendants fail to account for youth when considering the institutional \ndisciplinary records of juvenile lifers imprisoned when they were still adolescents and not as able \nas adults to control impulses, plan alternative courses of action, and otherwise moderate their \nbehavior.  \n220.  On information and belief, Defendants have access to and cite to disciplinary \ntickets issued to juvenile lifers when they were still juveniles being held at OCSF as the basis to \ndeny parole, without considering the hallmark features of youth or undiagnosed or untreated \nintellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism \nspectrum disorder and mental disorders such as post-traumatic-stress disorder, emotional \ndisturbances or childhood depression, all of which are exacerbated in incarcerated youth. \n221.  All policies, customs and practices associated with denying juvenile lifers a \nmeaningful and realistic opportunity for parole release reflect the official policy of the Board \nmade or acquiesced to by each Defendant.  Defendants’ actions involve reckless or callous \nindifference to the rights of Plaintiffs and similarly situated persons serving life sentences for \ncrimes committed as minors.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n222.  Named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of a class consisting of all persons \neligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes committed when they \nwere children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life sentences with the \npossibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS.   \n223.  This action meets the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) as follows: \ni.  The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all of its members is \nimpracticable.  In New York, there are approximately 630 persons currently \n56 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 57 of 69\nserving life sentences for offenses they committed between the ages of 13 \nand 17.  (DOCCS Statistics on Under Custody Population as of Jan. 16, 2016, \nat 1.)  Those people are now, or will be in the future, eligible for release to \nparole supervision.  While the exact size of the proposed class may not be \nknown at this time, there can be no doubt that a class action is appropriate to \naddress the systemic issues presented in this case.  In addition, joinder of all \nmembers of the proposed class is impracticable because membership of the \nproposed class constantly changes, as additional juveniles receive life \nsentences with the possibility of parole, some later become parole-eligible, \nand others are released under parole supervision.     \nii.  The questions of law and fact presented by the Named Plaintiffs are common \nto other members of the class.  Such questions include, generally, whether, \nunder federal law, Defendants provide a meaningful opportunity for release \nupon demonstrated rehabilitation and maturity.  More specifically: \na.  Whether Plaintiffs have been subject to disproportionate punishment \nand deprived of due process of law by being denied a meaningful and \nrealistic opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation; \nb.  Whether New York State Executive Law governing parole release \nviolates the Eighth Amendment rights of Class Members to be free of \ndisproportionate punishment; \nc.  Whether Defendants’ policies and practices in conducting parole \nrelease interviews and making parole release decisions violate the \n57 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 58 of 69\nEighth Amendment rights of Class Members to be free of \ndisproportionate punishment; \nd.  Whether Defendants’ policies and practices in conducting parole \nrelease interviews and making parole release decisions infringe on the \nDue Process rights of Class Members; \ne.  Whether Defendants’ parole decisions are rendered based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation or are based solely on the \nnature of a Class Member’s crime committed as a juvenile or a Class \nMember’s juvenile history;  \nf.  Whether the volume of work before the Board precludes the \nopportunity for Class Members to be meaningfully heard;  \ng.  Whether Defendants adequately review the supporting materials in \norder to enable Class Members to demonstrate maturity and \nrehabilitation; \nh.  Whether the limited length of parole interviews conducted by \nDefendants deprives Class Members of a meaningful and realistic \nopportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation; \ni.  Whether denying Class Members the appointment of counsel and \nopportunity of counsel to be present at interviews deprives Class \nMembers of a meaningful and realistic opportunity for release based \non demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation and due process of law;  \n58 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 59 of 69\nj.  Whether denying Class Members the right to see and confront \nevidence against them deprives Class Members of a meaningful and \nrealistic opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation and due process of law;  \nk.  Whether Defendants’ failure to give Class Members any explanation \nas to what additional steps they must take to be granted parole deprives \nClass Members of a meaningful and realistic opportunity for release \nbased on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation;  \nl.  Whether Defendants’ reliance on the nature of a juvenile crime, prior \njuvenile record, juvenile disciplinary history, and “official”, \n“community” or victim opposition, to deny release deprives Class \nMembers of a meaningful and realistic opportunity for release based \non demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation; \nm. Whether Defendants’ reliance on a “book copy”, rather than an entire \nparole packet, deprives Class Members of a meaningful and realistic \nopportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation;  \nn.  Whether Defendants’ reliance on COMPAS, which does not \nspecifically consider the diminished culpability of juveniles and the \nhallmark features of youth, and indeed sometimes treats youth as an \naggravating factor, to deny release deprives Class Members of a \nmeaningful and realistic opportunity for release based on demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation; and \n59 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 60 of 69\no.  Whether Defendants deny parole based on an aggravating factor \nrelating to the crime of conviction that was not an element of the jury \nverdict, judicial finding or guilty plea convicting Class Members at \ntheir original criminal trials.  \niii.  The violations alleged by Named Plaintiffs are typical of those suffered by the \nclass.  The entire class will benefit from the relief sought. \niv.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \nNamed Plaintiffs have no interests adverse to or in conflict with those of the \nother Class Members.  Plaintiffs’ counsel have experience in constitutional \nlitigation.  Attorneys Issa Kohler-Hausmann and Avery Gilbert have extensive \nknowledge about New York’s parole practice and procedure.  Cravath, Swaine \n& Moore LLP, co-counsel for Plaintiffs, is a private law firm experienced in \nmajor class-action litigation. \nv.  The prosecution of separate actions by individual Class Members would \ncreate a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications that would establish \nincompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class.  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b)(l)(A). \nvi.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nclass, making appropriate declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(For Violation of the Prohibition Against Cruel and Unusual Punishment in the Eighth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.) \n \n60 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 61 of 69\n224.  The allegations of the preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference as if \nfully set forth herein. \n225.  Defendants, in their official capacity as Commissioners of the Board of Parole, \nhave acted and are acting under color of state law. \n226.  The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbids a statutory scheme that \nmandates life imprisonment for juvenile offenders or permits life sentences without providing \nthem with a realistic and meaningful opportunity for release upon demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation.   \n227.  Defendants have denied and continue to deny Plaintiffs, and members of the class, \na meaningful opportunity for release by, among other things:  (1) failing to base their parole \ndeterminations on the demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation of juvenile lifers who are eligible \nfor parole; (2) failing to give juvenile lifers any explanation as to what additional steps they must \ntake to be recommended for parole; (3) denying release to parole supervision based upon crimes \njuvenile lifers committed decades ago that they cannot change; (4) failing to fully consider, read \nor attend to an inmate’s parole submission; (5) denying juvenile lifers the right to have an \nattorney present at their interviews and the right to see and confront any evidence against them; \nand (6) using risk assessment tools that discriminate against youth.  With these actions, \nDefendants have denied Plaintiffs and other members of the class a meaningful and realistic \nopportunity for release upon their showing of maturity and rehabilitation, in violation of the \nEighth Amendment. \n228.  Plaintiffs Carlos Flores, Lawrence Bartley, Demetrius Bennett, L’Mani Delima, \nEdgardo Lebron, Antonio Roman, Dontae Quinones and Sharod Logan, and members of the \nclass, have been injured and will likely suffer future injury by Defendants’ policies and practices \n61 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 62 of 69\nby being denied their rights to meaningful opportunity for release from imprisonment \nnotwithstanding their youth at the time of their offense and despite their demonstration of \nmaturity and rehabilitation, in violation of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments \nin the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, giving rise to Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ \nclaims for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(For Violation of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, \nactionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.) \n \n229.  The allegations of the preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference as if \nfully set forth herein. \n230.  Defendants, in their official capacity as Commissioners of the Board of Parole, \nhave acted and are acting under color of state law. \n231.  Under established U.S. Supreme Court case law, the Eighth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution confers upon juvenile lifers a legitimate expectancy of parole upon a showing \nof maturation and rehabilitation.  This is a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  \n232.  In 2011, the New York Legislature amended the Executive Law to mandate that \nthe Board of Parole “establish written procedures” that “shall incorporate risk and needs \nprinciples to measure” the rehabilitation of inmates.  N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-c(4).  The Executive \nLaw, as amended in 2011, provides prisoners with a legitimate expectancy that if they \ndemonstrate rehabilitation and a strong likelihood of future compliance with the law, they will be \ngranted parole.  This is a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  \n233.  In 2017, the Board of Parole amended its regulations to require that its decision-\nmaking “shall be guided by risk and needs principles”.  9 NYCRR § 8002.2(a).  The regulations \nacknowledge a presumption of release upon rehabilitation (notwithstanding nonbinding \n62 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 63 of 69\ndisclaimers in the commentary) by requiring Commissioners to provide nonconclusory \nindividualized reasons based in the record for any departure from the conclusions of a validated \nrisk assessment instrument, but only when that departure is denying release.  Id.  The regulations \nalso require Commissioners to address all statutory factors in each hearing.  Id. § 8002.2(c).  The \nBoard of Parole regulations, as amended in 2017, provide prisoners with a legitimate expectation \nthat if they demonstrate rehabilitation and a strong likelihood of future compliance with the law, \nthey will be granted parole.  This is a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. \n234.  Defendants’ conduct and actions—including, inter alia, regularly failing to read, \nreview and consider extensive evidence submitted to the Board demonstrating low risk to \ncommunity, rehabilitation and maturity—deny Plaintiffs, and members of the class, due process \nof law to secure their liberty interest in parole release, in violation of the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n235.  Plaintiffs Carlos Flores, Lawrence Bartley, Demetrius Bennett, L’Mani Delima, \nEdgardo Lebron, Antonio Roman, Dontae Quinones and Sharod Logan, and members of the \nclass, have been injured and will likely suffer future injury, as a result of Defendants’ official \npolicies and regular practices, which fail to adequately distinguish between persons serving life \nsentences for crimes committed as children and those committed as adults, and Defendants’ \nfailure to provide sufficient procedural protections necessary to secure the substantive right to \nrelease upon a showing of maturity and reform in violation of the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment, giving rise to Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ claims for relief under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983.   \n63 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 64 of 69\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(For Violation of the Right to a Jury Trial in the Sixth Amendment and the Right to Due Process \nin the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.) \n \n236.  The allegations of the preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference as if \nfully set forth herein. \n237.  Defendants, in their official capacity as Commissioners of the Board of Parole, \nhave acted and are acting under color of state law. \n238.  Each Plaintiff was, and Class Members were, convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, a \ncrime committed while he or she was a juvenile.   \n239.  Any fact that enhances the penalty to which a criminal defendant may lawfully be \nsentenced must be found beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the criminal defendant.  See \nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000); Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 604-05 \n(2002); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 303-05 (2004); Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. \n99, 114-15 (2013). \n240.  A state may impose a life sentence upon a juvenile offender only upon a finding \nthat the defendant is among the “very rarest of juvenile offenders, those whose crimes reflect \npermanent incorrigibility”.  Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734. \n241.  Each Plaintiff was, and Class Members were, either convicted without a finding \nthat, or pleaded guilty without pleading to a fact that, Plaintiff’s and Class Members’ crimes \nreflected that they were among the rarest juveniles whose crimes reflect permanent \nincorrigibility.  \n242.  Nor can Defendants deny parole release to juvenile lifers who have demonstrated \nunmistakable rehabilitation and have completed the statutory minimum term of imprisonment \nselected by the sentencing judge—a judge with full knowledge of the facts of the offense \n64 \n \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 110   Filed 09/25/18   Page 65 of 69\nimposing a sentence within the range set by the legislature—on the basis of a fact about the \ncrime of commission that was not found beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the criminal \ndefendant. \n243.  Defendants’ conduct and actions—including, inter alia, taking into account facts \nthat impose greater punishment on the parole applicant than was authorized by a jury verdict, \njudicial finding or guilty plea—deny Plaintiffs, and members of the class, their right to have only \nfacts found beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the criminal defendants expose them to \npunishment, in violation of the jury trial right of the Sixth Amendment and their right to due \nprocess of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n244.  Plaintiffs Carlos Flores, Lawrence Bartley, Demetrius Bennett, L’Mani Delima, \nEdgardo Lebron, Antonio Roman, Dontae Quinones and Sharod Logan, and members of the \nclass, have been injured and will likely suffer future injury, as a result of Defendants’ denial of \nparole release based on an aggravating factor relating to the crime of conviction that was not an \nelement proved beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the criminal defendants at their \noriginal criminal trial, in violation of their right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment and \ntheir right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, giving rise \nto Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ claims for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n \n(a) Certify a plaintiff class pursuant to Fed.

This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs are individuals \nwho were convicted of crimes committed when they were children under the age of 18 and \nsentenced to indeterminate life sentences with the possibility of parole.  Plaintiffs have been, \ncontinue to be, or will be subject to disproportionate punishment and deprived of due process of \nlaw by being denied a realistic and meaningful opportunity for release based upon demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation. \n2.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of a class consisting of all persons eligible for \nrelease to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes committed when they were children \nunder the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life sentences with the possibility of parole in \nthe custody of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision \n(“DOCCS”) (hereinafter referred to as “juvenile lifers” or “Class Members”). \n3.  Juvenile lifers, including Plaintiffs, have been, continue to be, or will be denied a \nmeaningful opportunity for release based upon demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, in \nviolation of the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.  Juvenile lifers, including Plaintiffs, have also been, continue to be, or will be \ndenied due process of law in the manner in which their parole hearings have been conducted, in \nviolation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \nJuvenile lifers, including Plaintiffs, have also been, continue to be, or will be denied their right to \n2 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 3 of 62\n \na trial by jury and their right to due process because their sentences have been extended by \nfindings of fact made by the Board of Parole’s Commissioners, in violation of the Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n4.  Recognizing that fundamental differences between children and adults are \nrelevant to assessing proportionality in punishment, the U.S. Supreme Court has, in a series of \ncases, forbidden as unconstitutional life without parole for all juveniles, even those who commit \nheinous crimes, except for the “rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable \ncorruption”, and has held that this substantive constitutional rule is retroactive.  Montgomery v. \nLouisiana, 136 S. Ct. 718, 734 (2016) (quoting Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, 479-80 (2012)); \nGraham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 82 (2010).\n \n5.  Taken together, these decisions establish that the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution prohibits statutory schemes that fail to provide juvenile lifers with a meaningful and \nrealistic opportunity for release based upon demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  See \nMiller, 567 U.S. at 470-80; Graham, 560 U.S. at 50. \n6.  These decisions have both a substantive component, which applies retroactively \nto all juvenile lifers in prison today, and a procedural component, which applies at parole \nhearings where juvenile lifers face possible life imprisonment if parole is denied.  See \nMontgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734-35. \n7.  In New York State, the authority to release any person sentenced to a maximum \nterm of life prior to the end of his or her natural life lies with the New York State Board of \nParole (hereinafter “Board of Parole” or “Board”).  Defendants are each Commissioners of the \nBoard of Parole and are sued in their official capacity (hereinafter “Commissioners” or \n“Defendants”). \n3 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 4 of 62\n \n8.  Despite clear precedent to the contrary, Defendants have interpreted the New \nYork Executive Law to allow Defendants to deny parole to juvenile lifers without regard to an \nindividual’s subsequent demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, if Defendants determine that \nrelease would be “not compatible with the welfare of society” or would “so deprecate the \nseriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law”.  See N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-i(2)(c)(A). \n9.  Accordingly, Defendants regularly deny parole to juvenile lifers who demonstrate \nunmistakable rehabilitation and reform, and low risk to public safety.  Defendants have \nconsistently denied such individuals parole with short conclusory opinions citing only factors \npresent at the time of conviction, such as juvenile criminal history and the nature of the crime of \nconviction. \n10.  The procedures and practices of the Board of Parole, as executed by Defendants, \nthereby deprive juvenile lifers, including Plaintiffs, of a meaningful opportunity for release based \non demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation in violation of the constitutional prohibition against \nexcessive punishment.  The formal regulations and regular practices of the Board of Parole, as \nexecuted by Defendants, also violate juvenile lifers’, including Plaintiffs’, Due Process rights, \nwhich arise from the liberty interest in parole conferred by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Eighth \nAmendment jurisprudence and by New York State Executive Law and the Board’s regulations. \n11.  Plaintiffs do not challenge their judgments of conviction and do not seek to \ninvalidate their sentences.  Plaintiffs do not seek an order of release from this Court.  Rather, \nPlaintiffs seek an order that Defendants must afford them, and those similarly situated, as \npersons sentenced to life imprisonment for offenses committed before they were 18 years old, a \nmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on non-arbitrary criteria that measure their degree \nof maturity and rehabilitation. \n4 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 5 of 62\n \n12.  Plaintiffs do not maintain that all Class Members are necessarily entitled to \nimmediate release under the constitutionally mandated standard for release.  Through this action, \nPlaintiffs seek to ensure that Defendants apply the constitutionally mandated standard at parole \nrelease hearings for Plaintiffs and all Class Members. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n13.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343(a)(3).  The controversy arises under the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution. \n14.  Venue properly lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2) \nbecause a majority of Plaintiffs are or were incarcerated within the Southern District of New \nYork, and Defendants have conducted parole hearings and taken other actions leading to the \ndenial of Plaintiffs’ rights, as alleged further herein, within the Southern District of New York. \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \ni.  Plaintiff Carlos Flores \n15.  Plaintiff Carlos Flores is 58 years old and until his release in 2018, had been \nincarcerated since he was 17.  He was convicted of felony murder after participating in a robbery \nin January 1981 that resulted in an accomplice shooting an off-duty police officer who was a \npatron in the bar and drew a gun. \n16.  Mr. Flores was convicted of murder in the second degree and was sentenced to \n21 years to life.  At sentencing, the judge considered, and rejected, a lengthier minimum sentence \nof 25 years because Mr. Flores had no prior criminal record and was not the shooter.  Mr. Flores \nwas denied parole ten times.  By the time he ultimately was granted parole on his eleventh try, \n5 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 6 of 62\n \nafter the original complaint in this lawsuit was filed, he had already been incarcerated for 37 \nyears, 16 years in excess of the 21-year minimum set by the judge. \n17.  Mr. Flores had a difficult upbringing.  He was a victim of frequent abuse and \ndropped out of school to support his family financially by working at a pizzeria.  He was \nmanipulated into participating in a robbery by a much older man who had significant influence \nover him—a man who had shown him friendship and who he had thought was a mentor.  During \nthe robbery, in an unplanned act, one of the robbers shot and killed a patron of the bar, Robert \nWalsh, an off-duty police officer.  At that time, Mr. Flores was in a separate room at the back of \nthe bar. \n18.  Nothing in Mr. Flores’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crime[] reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”. \n19.  Before Mr. Flores was released on June 25, 2018, he was incarcerated at Otisville \nCorrectional Facility in Otisville, New York.  Mr. Flores had an exceptional institutional record \nwhile in custody.  His last disciplinary offense was more than 25 years before his release for \ndisobeying an order to keep the mess hall line moving. \n20.  He had low (favorable) scores across the board in his Correctional Offender \nManagement Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (“COMPAS”).  In addition, his COMPAS \nreport found that if released he would require the lowest level of supervision.  He had earned \noutside clearance to work in the community, a permit DOCCS grants only to the most \ntrustworthy inmates who can safely work outside the prison with minimal supervision.  He \nsuccessfully completed all of the terms of parole and was discharged from parole supervision on \nJune 25, 2021. \n6 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 7 of 62\n \n21.  Defendants last denied Mr. Flores release on October 24, 2017, on the \nunsubstantiated basis that his “discretionary release at this time, would not be compatible with \nthe welfare of society and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the Instant Offense and \nundermine respect for the law”. \n22.  Plaintiff Carlos Flores brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of similarly \nsituated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n23.  Mr. Flores was denied a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that:  \n(1) Commissioners did not fully consider, read or attend to Mr. Flores’s parole submission; \n(2) neither Mr. Flores nor his attorneys were permitted access to letters opposing his release; \n(3) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at his interview and the right to see and \nconfront any evidence against him; (4) his denial was based on a crime he committed decades \nago that he could not change; (5) Commissioners did not base their decision on Mr. Flores’s \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation; and (6) he was denied any explanation for what \nadditional steps he must take to be recommended for parole. \nii.  Plaintiff Lawrence Bartley \n24.  Plaintiff Lawrence Bartley is 49 years old and until his release in 2018, had been \nincarcerated since he was 17.  In December 1990, Mr. Bartley was involved in a gunfight that \nerupted at a local movie theater.  Twenty shots were exchanged in total, with only one shot fired \nby Mr. Bartley.  In the midst of the shooting, a bystander, Tremain Hall, was accidentally shot \nand killed. \n7 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 8 of 62\n \n25.  Mr. Bartley received an aggregate sentence of 27 and one-third years to life for \nsecond degree murder and associated offenses.  By the time he ultimately was released on parole \nin May 2018, after the original complaint in this lawsuit was filed, he had already been \nimprisoned for 27 years and was incarcerated at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, \nNew York. \n26.  Mr. Bartley grew up in a rough neighborhood surrounded by drug dealers and \ngang members.  At just 16 years of age, he was shot four times in a drive-by shooting.  He began \ncarrying a gun thereafter out of fear for his life. \n27.  Nothing in Mr. Bartley’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crime[] reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”. \n28.  Mr. Bartley had an exceptional institutional disciplinary record while in custody.  \nHis last disciplinary infraction was in 2008, roughly ten years before his release. \n29.  Mr. Bartley’s COMPAS report found him to be at a low risk of reoffending.  Mr. \nBartley had received numerous letters of support from corrections officers, including from the \nsuperintendent of Sing Sing, noting that Mr. Bartley’s behavior “exemplifies DOCCS’[s] \nmission of rehabilitating its residents to positively re-enter society”. \n30.  While incarcerated, Mr. Bartley earned a six-month limited credit time allowance \n(“LCTA”) for “significant programmatic accomplishment” and lack of serious disciplinary \ninfractions.  The LCTA award made him eligible for parole release six months before the \nexpiration of his minimum term.  He successfully completed all of the terms of parole and was \ndischarged from parole on August 31, 2021. \n8 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 9 of 62\n \n31.  Defendants last denied Mr. Bartley release on September 6, 2017.  He was denied \nrelease despite ample evidence of his maturation and rehabilitation, including having earned a \nMaster’s degree, raised $8,000 for a gun buy-back program, publicly engaged in anti-violence \nand anti-gun violence programming and secured employment upon release. \n32.  In their September 6, 2017 decision, Defendants acknowledged these \nachievements, writing:  “The Panel applauds your exceptional packet, institutional \naccomplishments, your overall low COMPAS score and satisfactory case plan.  Your release \nplanning, community outreach, use of media, networking and your life as an example \nexemplifies an extraordinary effort to give back, demonstrates restoration and evidenced \nchange.”  The panel then concluded, without any basis, that “there is a reasonable probability \nthat you would not live and remain at liberty without again violating the law and that your \nrelease would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so deprecate the serious \nnature of the crime as to undermine respect for the law”. \n33.  Mr. Bartley represents himself and a class of similarly situated people eligible for \nrelease to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes committed when they were children \nunder the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life sentences with the possibility of parole in \nthe custody of DOCCS. \n34.  Mr. Bartley was denied a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that:  (1) \nCommissioners did not meaningfully consider, read or attend to Mr. Bartley’s full parole \nsubmission; (2) the denial of release to parole supervision was based on a crime he committed \ndecades ago that he could not change; (3) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at \nhis interview and the right to see and confront any evidence against him; (4) he was denied the \n9 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 10 of 62\n \nright to inspect and challenge the method of calculating his COMPAS scores; (5) Commissioners \nfailed to base their decision on Mr. Bartley’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation since the \nage of 17; and (6) he was denied any explanation for what additional steps he must take to be \nrecommended for parole. \niii.  Demetrius Bennett \n35.  Plaintiff Demetrius Bennett is 43 years old and until his release in 2018, had been \nincarcerated since he was 15.  He was convicted of felony murder when, at 15 years old and \nunder the direction of a man in his thirties, Mr. Bennett participated in robbing a bicycle shop.  \nDuring the robbery, the older man shot and killed a police officer. \n36.  Prior to the bicycle shop robbery, Mr. Bennett had no criminal record.  He did not \nplan the robbery, was not carrying a weapon, was not the shooter and was not in the room when \nthe shooting occurred.  After a trial, Mr. Bennett was convicted of murder in the second degree \nand robbery and was sentenced to nine years to life.  By the time he was ultimately released on \nparole in October 2018, after the amended complaint in this lawsuit was filed, he had already \nbeen denied parole eight times and had been incarcerated for over 23 years—14 years in excess \nof the nine-year minimum sentence set by the judge. \n37.  Prior to the crime, Mr. Bennett, a 15-year-old child, had no family support.  \nMr. Bennett’s mother passed away when he was 13 years old and his father was only \nintermittently present during his childhood and was not performing a parenting role.  After his \nmother’s death, Mr. Bennett lived on the streets and stayed on friends’ couches.  His oldest sister \nand younger brother went to live with his aunt, and his other sister went to foster care.  Mr. \nBennett earned a meager living on the streets, pumping gas and helping people to their cars with \ntheir groceries to earn money.  He stopped attending school out of frustration because he did not \nknow how to read or do math. \n10 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 11 of 62\n \n38.  Prior to the crime, Karen Young, the mother of one of Mr. Bennett’s friends, took \nMr. Bennett in off the streets even though they were not related, and Mr. Bennett returned to \nschool. \n39.  At the time of the crime, Mr. Bennett was high on marijuana.  He and his co- \ndefendants, Lavonne Smith and Vernon Smith, ages 16 and 17 years old respectively, were \npersuaded to rob a bicycle shop by his co-defendants’ uncle, Richard Larrier, who was in his \nthirties.  Mr. Bennett was directed to tie up the owners of the store in the back room.  During the \nrobbery, the police entered the store and Mr. Larrier shot and killed a police officer, Raymond \nCannon.  Mr. Larrier was subsequently shot and killed. \n40.  Nothing in Mr. Bennett’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crime[] reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”. \n41.  While incarcerated, Mr. Bennett earned his General Equivalency Diploma \n(“GED”) after multiple attempts, demonstrating perseverance and a commitment to his future.  \nHe completed numerous programs and has an extensive work history.  He has been described as \nan “asset” in an Inmate Progress Report for his work on the maintenance and paint crew.  He was \nalso described in that report as a humble leader and respectful to all staff and his peers.  He \nsuccessfully completed all of the terms of parole and was discharged from parole supervision on \nOctober 24, 2021. \n42.  For the most part, Mr. Bennett had low (favorable) scores on his COMPAS, \nexcept for “Prison Misconduct”, “ReEntry Substance Abuse” and “ReEntry Financial”, which \nare “high”, “probable” and “probable”, respectively.  As alleged below, Mr. Bennett lacks \n11 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 12 of 62\n \nknowledge and was denied information about how his COMPAS scores—favorable or \nunfavorable—were calculated. \n43.  His disciplinary record demonstrates his growth over the years, and in his \nSeptember 2017 decision Defendants noted that his “disciplinary record reflects some violent \nconduct over the years but none in nearly five years”. \n44.  Defendants last denied Mr. Bennett release at his September 13, 2017 hearing.  \nAside from recounting the tragic loss of life caused by his crime, the Commissioners’ decision \ncontains all positive factors demonstrating rehabilitation and reform, noting that while in \ncustody, Mr. Bennett had “performed well in [his] programs, satisfying all requirements”.  \nNonetheless, without citing to any support in the record, the Board concluded that the “panel is \nnot convinced that if released you would live at liberty without once again violating the law or \nthat your release would not so deprecate the offense as to undermine respect for the law”. \n45.  Plaintiff Demetrius Bennett brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of \nsimilarly situated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n46.  Mr. Bennett was denied a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that:  \n(1) Commissioners did not meaningfully consider, read or attend to Mr. Bennett’s full parole \nsubmission; (2) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at his interview and the right \nto see and confront any evidence against him; (3) he was denied the right to inspect and \nchallenge the method of calculating his COMPAS scores; (4) he was not permitted access to \nletters opposing his release; (5) his denial was based on a crime he committed decades ago that \n12 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 13 of 62\n \nhe cannot change; (6) Commissioners did not base their decision on Mr. Bennett’s demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation; and (7) he was denied any explanation for what additional steps he \nmust take to be recommended for parole. \niv.  Antonio Roman \n47.  Plaintiff Antonio Roman is 44 years old and until his release in 2018, had been \nincarcerated for almost 24 years for a crime committed when he was 17 years old. \n48.  Mr. Roman was abandoned in infancy by both of his parents.  His mother left \nafter he was born and his father was absent.  He was raised by his grandmother, but she also \nabandoned him and moved to Puerto Rico when he was 16 years old, leaving Mr. Roman \nstruggling to support himself on his own.  Mr. Roman became a teen parent and did not have a \nway to support himself or provide for his daughter.  Mr. Roman was desperate.  He met an older \nman, co-defendant Ralph “Tony” Ambert, at a party.  Mr. Ambert offered Mr. Roman money \nand a car to help him shoot his father, stepmother and anyone else in the house, because Mr. \nAmbert believed that his father was going to remove him from his will.  Under the direction of \nhis older co-defendant, Mr. Roman shot and killed Mr. Ambert’s stepmother, Patricia Ambert.  \nMr. Roman did not know the victim prior to the crime.  He took a plea and was convicted of \nmurder in the second degree for a crime that occurred in January 1995 when he was 17 years old. \n49.  Nothing in Mr. Roman’s record suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that his \ncrime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crime[] reflects permanent \nincorrigibility”. \n50.  Mr. Roman received a sentence of 20 years to life.  By the time he was ultimately \nreleased on parole from Fishkill Correctional Facility in Beacon, New York on November 8, \n2018, after the amended complaint in this lawsuit was filed, he had served almost 24 years in \n13 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 14 of 62\n \nprison and had been denied parole three times despite significant evidence of rehabilitation and \nan exceptional disciplinary record.  \n51.  Mr. Roman had an exceptional disciplinary record while in custody.  His last \ndisciplinary infraction was in 2003, roughly 15 years before his release.  Furthermore, his \nCOMPAS scores were low (favorable) across the board. \n52.  While incarcerated, Mr. Roman received his GED and earned multiple college \ncredits.  He participated in several programs for HIV awareness and treatment.  He also \ncompleted a 16-week training program for food handling and sanitation practices.  He received \nnumerous commendable behavior reports from corrections officers recommending him for \nparole.  He successfully completed all of the terms of parole and was discharged from parole \nsupervision on November 8, 2021. \n53.  Defendants last denied Mr. Roman parole release on September 20, 2016 despite \nsignificant evidence of his maturity and rehabilitation.  Defendants “commend[ed] [his] personal \ngrowth and productive use of time”.  However, Defendants denied release on the unsubstantiated \nbasis that “if released at this time, [his] release would be incompatible with the welfare of society \nand would so deprecate the serious nature of the crime . . . as to undermine respect for the law”.  \nDefendants merely noted that they had “considered [his] age at the time of the crime and \ndiminished culpability at the time”.  Defendants concluded, however, that “discretionary release \n[was] not presently warranted as [his] release would trivialize the tragic loss of life that [he] \ncaused”. \n54.  Plaintiff Antonio Roman brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of \nsimilarly situated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \n14 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 15 of 62\n \ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n55.  Mr. Roman was denied a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that:  \n(1) Commissioners did not meaningfully consider, read or attend to Mr. Roman’s full parole \nsubmission; (2) Mr. Roman was not permitted access to letters opposing his release; (3) he was \ndenied the right to have an attorney present at his interview and the right to see and confront any \nevidence against him; (4) his denial was based on a crime he committed decades ago that he \ncannot change; (5) Commissioners did not base their decision on Mr. Roman’s demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation; and (6) he was denied any explanation for what additional steps he \nmust take to be recommended for parole. \nv.  Vintarra Martin \n56.  Plaintiff Vintarra Martin is 32 years old and has been incarcerated since she was \n16 years old.   \n57.  Ms. Martin grew up in a physically and emotionally abusive household.  Her \nmother suffered severe and regular beatings from her father.  After he left, her mother, \nMs. Taylor, inflicted the same sort of physical abuse on Ms. Martin.  When Ms. Martin was \n15 years old, she began dating Damasoh Kelly.  He was 23 years old at the time.  Mr. Kelly \ntreated Ms. Martin similarly to how her father had treated her mother; his beatings were severe \nand frequent.  Unable to leave the relationship without suffering extreme consequences, she lived \nin fear of him.   \n58.  On September 2, 2006, after finding her daughter’s positive pregnancy test, \nMs. Taylor confronted Mr. Kelly.  She threatened to call the police on him for statutory rape, and \na violent fight ensued.  Mr. Kelly verbally threatened Ms. Martin, saying he would kill her unless \n15 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 16 of 62\n \nshe stabbed her mother.  Ms. Martin took the knife from him and proceeded to stab her mother, \nresulting in Ms. Taylor’s death.  Ms. Martin took a plea and was convicted of murder in the \nsecond degree.  To date, she has been incarcerated for 16 years.  She has been denied parole two \ntimes.  \n59.  Nothing in Ms. Martin’s records suggests, nor was any finding ever made, that her \ncrime reflected that she was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crime[] reflects \npermanent incorrigibility”. \n60.  Ms. Martin is presently incarcerated at Taconic Correctional Facility in Bedford \nHills, New York.  She earned her GED and has completed two years of college programming.  \nDuring her incarceration, she has obtained vocational training in food service, sighted guide \ntechniques and medical services.  She has completed numerous programs and has an extensive \nwork history.  Her work as a mobility aide and sighted guide have each earned her multiple \nglowing reviews in Inmate Progress Reports.   \n61.  Despite the nature of her crime, she maintains strong relationships with her family \nmembers, speaking to many of them on a daily basis.  Her brother Tyvie Lafrance wrote a letter \npledging to support Ms. Martin emotionally and financially should she be released on parole. \n62.  Due to her accomplishments and disciplinary record while incarcerated,  \nMs. Martin was awarded a LCTA by DOCCS, allowing her to be considered for release to parole \nsupervision six months earlier than her parole eligibility date.  This award can only be given if an \nincarcerated person did not commit a “serious” disciplinary infraction while in custody and does \nnot have a “poor” institutional record. \n16 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 17 of 62\n \n63.  Ms. Martin’s October 6, 2020 COMPAS scored her as a “Low” “Risk of Felony \nViolence” but a “Medium” “History of Violence”.  Ms. Martin lacks knowledge and has been \ndenied information about how her COMPAS scores—favorable or unfavorable—are calculated. \n64.  Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Crangle denied Ms. Martin release at her \nLimited Credit Time Interview in February 2021, stating that an “aggravating factor” was that \nthe victim was her “mother” and that “[i]t can’t get any worse” in terms of heinousness than \n“killing your mother”.  \n65.  Commissioner Crangle and Commissioner Berliner again denied Ms. Martin \nrelease on April 27, 2021, commending her “personal growth and productive use of time” but \nconcluding that her “release would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so \ndeprecate the seriousness of [the] crime as to undermine respect for the law” due, again, to the \nfact that the victim was her mother and also due to the Commissioners’ findings and conclusions \nregarding an unspecified “ongoing course of conduct, before, during, and after the commission \nof the offense”. \n66.  Plaintiff Vintarra Martin brings this suit on behalf of herself and a class of \nsimilarly situated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n67.  Ms. Martin was denied and continues to be denied a meaningful opportunity for \nrelease based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that:  \n(1) Commissioners did not fully consider, read or attend to Ms. Martin’s parole submission; \n(2) she was denied the right to have an attorney present at her interview and the right to see and \nconfront any evidence against her; (3) she was denied the right to inspect and challenge the \n17 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 18 of 62\n \nmethod of calculating her COMPAS scores; (4) her denial was based on a crime she committed \nas a child that she could not change and facts about that crime that Defendant Commissioners \nbelieved require more punishment than that established by the legislature and sentencing judge; \n(5) she was denied based on Defendant Commissioners’ findings and conclusions about her \n“course of conduct before during and after the commission of the crime”, the facts of which were \nnot proved beyond a reasonable doubt; and (6) Commissioners failed to fully consider \nMs. Martin’s crime in the context of youth and did not base their decision on Ms. Martin’s \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. \nvi.  Terrance Anderson \n68.  Plaintiff Terrance Anderson is 39 years old.  Until his release on April 20, 2022, \nhe had been incarcerated for over 22 years, more than two years past his minimum sentence.   \n69.  Mr. Anderson had a tumultuous childhood.  Neither his stepfather nor his mother \nwas present at home, and his mother was often out using drugs.  When they were around, his \nmother and stepfather were physically abusive to each other and Mr. Anderson, increasingly so \nas his older siblings moved out of the house.  Prior to being incarcerated, he had met his father \nonly twice in his life.  His mother encouraged him to leave home as often as he could, and he \nspent much of his childhood bouncing between relatives’, friends’ and at times strangers’ homes.   \n70.  At age 16, Mr. Anderson was staying with a 39-year-old friend who introduced \nhim to victim Louis Sansivero, who was 49 years old at the time.  Mr. Sansivero would have \nMr. Anderson wash his car and run errands for him, and ultimately got him involved in dealing \ndrugs for him.   \n71.  On August 27, 1999, Mr. Sansivero came to collect the balance of $5,000 that \nMr. Anderson owed him in relation to drug sales.  Mutual friends warned Mr. Anderson that \nMr. Sansivero would hurt Mr. Anderson if he did not give Mr. Sansivero the full balance.  \n18 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 19 of 62\n \nMr. Anderson asked Mr. Sansivero for more time to pay him, but Mr. Sansivero demanded that \nhe be given the full amount that same day.  To buy time, Mr. Anderson said he would get the \nmoney from a nearby house and instead retrieved the gun that Mr. Sansivero had given him to \nguard the drugs.  He asked Mr. Sansivero again for additional time to pay him.  Mr. Sansivero \nresponded by standing up from the couch where he was sitting, which Mr. Anderson saw as a \nthreat.  Out of fear, Mr. Anderson started shooting.  Mr. Sansivero died from gunshot wounds to \nthe chest.  Mr. Anderson took a plea and was convicted of murder in the second degree for a \ncrime that occurred when he was 16 years old.  He has been denied parole two times. \n72.  Nothing in Mr. Anderson’s record suggests nor was any finding ever made, that \nhis crime reflected that he was among the “rarest of juvenile[s] . . . whose crime[] reflects \npermanent incorrigibility”.  \n73.  Prior to his release in April 2022, Mr. Anderson was incarcerated at Orleans \nCorrectional Facility in Albion, New York.  When he was first incarcerated, he had a substantial \ndisciplinary history, although even then, few of the violations were violent.  In recent years, his \ndisciplinary record substantially improved, which demonstrates his growth and maturation over \nthe years.  In his April 2021 hearing, Defendants noted with regards to his disciplinary record \nthat Mr. Anderson had “bumps in the road but since 2018 things have been better”. \n74.  With the exception of “Prison Misconduct” and “Reentry Substance Abuse”, \nwhich were “High” and “Probable” respectively, his December 22, 2020 COMPAS scores were \nlow (favorable) across the board.  In addition, “Prison Misconduct” and “Reentry Substance \nAbuse” are “Needs”, as opposed to “Risk”, scores and do not purport to predict risk of \nrecidivism or violence.  As alleged below, Mr. Anderson lacks knowledge and has been denied \ninformation about how his COMPAS scores—favorable or unfavorable—are calculated. \n19 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 20 of 62\n \n75.  While incarcerated, Mr. Anderson obtained his GED, an associate’s degree in \nbusiness management and 21 credits towards a second associate’s degree in liberal arts from \nSUNY Genesee Community College, where he consistently made the Dean’s List.  He also \ncompleted vocational training in over seven areas, including legal research and law library \nmanagement, business management and medical services.  Mr. Anderson further completed \nmultiple therapeutic and rehabilitative programs, including Alternatives to Violence, Alcohol and \nSubstance Abuse Treatment, Innovative Therapeutic Program, Healing Communities and \nParenting Plus.  Mr. Anderson consistently held jobs and leadership positions while incarcerated, \nincluding Group Leader for Laundry and Medical Services.   \n76.  On April 24, 2019, Defendants denied Mr. Anderson release stating that he had \nbeen “adjudicated as a juvenile delinquent” prior to the crime, that the “victim’s account through \nthe sentencing minutes is compelling” and that “strong language featured in the official \nopposition to [his] release underscores that . . . discretionary release is not warranted”.   \n77.  Defendants last denied Mr. Anderson release on April 20, 2021, stating that there \n“continues to be consistent opposition to [his] release” and that there were “strong statements at \n[his] sentencing . . . by the victim’s family and the judge”.  Despite noting Mr. Anderson’s \n“personal growth and productive use of time”, “positive programming and educational \nachievements”, “low [COMPAS] scores” and “thorough parole packets containing . . . letters of \nsupport and multiple certificates”, the Board concluded that releasing Mr. Anderson “would be \nincompatible with the welfare of society and would so deprecate the seriousness of [the] crime as \nto undermine respect for the law”.  Mr. Anderson appealed this decision and was granted parole \nat his de novo hearing on March 16, 2022.   \n20 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 21 of 62\n \n78.  Plaintiff Terrance Anderson brings this suit on behalf of himself and a class of \nsimilarly situated persons eligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes \ncommitted when they were children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life \nsentences with the possibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n79.  Mr. Anderson was denied a meaningful opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, and the right to due process, in that:  \n(1) Commissioners did not fully consider, read or attend to Mr. Anderson’s parole submission; \n(2) neither Mr. Anderson nor his attorneys were permitted access to letters opposing his release; \n(3) he was denied the right to have an attorney present at his interview and the right to see and \nconfront any evidence against him; (4) his denial was based on a crime he committed decades \nago that he could not change and facts about that crime that were not proved beyond a reasonable \ndoubt; (5) he was denied the right to inspect and challenge the method of calculating his \nCOMPAS scores; (6) Commissioners did not base their decision on Mr. Anderson’s \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation; and (7) he was denied any explanation for what \nadditional steps he must take to be recommended for parole. \nB.

JUVENILES HAVE DIMINISHED CULPABILITY AND GREATER PROSPECTS \nFOR REFORM THAN ADULTS, AND THE STATE CANNOT, EXCEPT IN THE \nRAREST OF CASES, CONDEMN JUVENILE OFFENDERS TO DIE IN PRISON \nWITHOUT A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR RELEASE. \nA.  The relevant scientific communities have recognized that children are \ncategorically different from adults. \n97.  Scientific and psychological studies confirm that children are fundamentally \ndifferent from adults, and as a result, their culpability is diminished. \n98.  The first reason that justifies the diminished culpability of juvenile offenders is \ntheir lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility.  See Laurence Steinberg & \nElizabeth S. Scott, Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence: Developmental Immaturity, \nDiminished Responsibility, and the Juvenile Death Penalty, 58 Am. Psychologist 1009, 1011-14 \n(2003). \n99.  Their lack of maturity often results in impetuous and ill-considered actions and \ndecisions (i.e., impulsive conduct), which explains why “adolescents are overrepresented \nstatistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior”.  Jeffrey Arnett, Reckless Behavior \nin Adolescence: A Developmental Perspective, 12 Developmental Rev. 339, 339 (1992); see also \nLaurence Steinberg & Robert G. Schwartz, Developmental Psychology Goes to Court in Youth \n25 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 26 of 62\n \non Trial: A Developmental Perspective on Juvenile Justice 9 (Thomas Grisso & Robert G. \nSchwartz, eds. 2000). \n100.  Developmental research shows that juveniles engage in impulsive decision-\nmaking because they are unable to perceive risks.  Melinda G. Schmidt, et al., Effectiveness of \nParticipation as a Defendant: The Attorney-Juvenile Client Relationship, 21 Behav. Sci. & L. \n175, 180 (2003).  Another explanation for their impulsive behavior is that juveniles think more \nabout immediate gains as opposed to long-term consequences, and thus consider the meaning of \na potential act differently than adults.  Id.; see also Kristin N. Henning, Loyalty, Paternalism, and \nRights: Client Counseling Theory and the Role of Child’s Counsel in Delinquency Cases, 81 \nNotre Dame L. Rev. 245, 271-72 (2005). \n101.  A second area of difference between adults and adolescents is that juveniles are \nmore vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure.  Steinberg \n& Scott, supra, at 1014. \n102.  Their susceptibility to outside pressure is explained, at least in part, by the \nprevailing circumstance that juveniles have less control, or less experience with control, over \ntheir own environment.  Id. \n103.  It is no surprise, therefore, that psychologists have concluded that juveniles “lack \nthe freedom that adults have to extricate themselves from a criminogenic setting”.  Id. \n104.  A third area of difference between adults and adolescents is that the character of a \njuvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult.  Specifically, psychologists and psychoanalysts \nhave recognized that the personality traits of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed.  See \ngenerally, Erik H. Erikson, Identity: Youth and Crisis (1968); see also Steinberg & Scott, supra, \nat 1014. \n26 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 27 of 62\n \n105.  Although these three inherently transitory characteristics of juveniles often lead \nthem to commit crimes, psychologists have recognized that, for most teenagers, their impulsive \nand risky behaviors “cease with maturity” as their identities become settled, they learn to \nconsider long-term consequences of potential actions prior to making choices, and they gain the \nresources and capacities to extricate themselves from negative influences.  Steinberg & Scott, \nsupra, at 1014. \n106.  As adolescents mature into adults, they gain an improved perspective on long-\nterm consequences, become more risk-averse and gain the self-regulatory capacities to conform \ntheir actions to moral evaluation.  Kristin Henning, supra, at 272.  They “also come to regret \ndecisions they made in earlier years”.  Id. \n107.  The behavior of adolescents evolves so much as they grow up that studies \nrecognize that “[o]nly a relatively small proportion of adolescents who experiment in risky or \nillegal activities develop entrenched patterns of problem behavior that persist into adulthood”.  \nSteinberg & Scott, supra, at 1014 (citations omitted). \nB.  The law has traditionally viewed children differently. \n108.  Courts and legislatures have long recognized that children are not fully \npsychologically and socially developed, are susceptible to persuasion and abuse, and are marked \nby judgmental inexperience such that it is appropriate to limit their ability as a class to vote, \nmarry, serve on juries, drink alcohol, gamble, leave school and otherwise exercise full autonomy \nunder the law.  See J.D.B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.S. 261, 272-77 (2011). \n109.  The inherent characteristics of children have been recognized in the area of \npunishment in a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions.  Specifically, the U.S. Supreme Court \nrecognized that three distinctive attributes of juveniles mitigate their culpability:  juveniles have \ntransient immaturity; they are vulnerable to external forces; and their character traits are still \n27 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 28 of 62\n \nbeing formed.  Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 733; Miller, 567 U.S. at 470-71; Graham, 560 U.S. at \n68; Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569-70 (2005). \n110.  By recognizing the psychological and social characteristics of children, these \ndecisions established constitutional limitations on the punishment that can be imposed on \nchildren, even for very serious crimes, reasoning that “children are constitutionally different \nfrom adults for purposes of sentencing” because they have “diminished culpability and greater \nprospects for reform”.  Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 733 (quoting Miller, 567 U.S. at 471 (citing \nRoper, 543 U.S. at 569-70; Graham, 560 U.S. at 68)). \n111.  In Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 572 (2005), the U.S. Supreme Court \ncategorically outlawed the death penalty for juvenile offenders, even those convicted of the most \nheinous murders, concluding that “neither retribution nor deterrence provides adequate \njustification for imposing the death penalty on juvenile offenders”. \n112.  In Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010), the U.S. Supreme Court held that \nsentencing a juvenile to life in prison without parole for crimes other than murder violates the \nEighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment, specifically for non-homicide \noffenses. \n113.  In Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the \nEighth Amendment prohibits a sentencing scheme that requires life in prison without the \npossibility of parole for juvenile homicide offenders. \n114.  In Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. 718 (2016), the U.S. Supreme Court held \nthat Miller v. Alabama announced a substantive rule which, under the Constitution, is retroactive \nin cases on state collateral review. \n28 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 29 of 62\n \n115.  In United States v. Reingold, 731 F.3d 204 (2d Cir. 2013), the Second Circuit \nreiterated the categorical prohibition of mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles. \n116.  These cases hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids a statutory scheme that (i) \nimposes life sentences upon minors who are not the rarest of irredeemable juveniles whose \ncrimes reflects permanent incorrigibility, and (ii) fails to provide those whose crimes reflect \nunfortunate yet transient immaturity with a meaningful and realistic opportunity for release.  \nNew York law fails this test on both accounts.  This rule is based on substantive constitutional \nprinciples of proportionality governing punishment for juvenile lifers based on their diminished \nculpability and enhanced capacity for reform. \nC.  Life sentences imposed on children are unconstitutional absent a parole \nscheme that provides a meaningful and realistic opportunity to obtain release \nbased on demonstrated rehabilitation and reform. \n117.  “The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment \nguarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions.  That right . . . flows \nfrom the basic precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned \nto both the offender and the offense.”  Miller, 567 U.S. at 469 (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). \n118.  Accordingly, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that “sentencing a child to life \nwithout parole is [unconstitutionally] excessive for all but the ‘rare juvenile offender whose \ncrime reflects irreparable corruption’”.  Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734 (quoting Miller, 567 U.S. \nat 479-80).  States “must impose a sentence that provides some meaningful opportunity for \nrelease based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation”.  Graham, 560 U.S. at 50. \n119.  That holding has both “substantive” and “procedural component[s]”.  \nMontgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734-35.  Because of its substantive nature, the U.S. Supreme Court \nhas held that this constitutional rule applies retroactively.  Id. \n29 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 30 of 62\n \n120.  As a matter of “substantive right”, it is unconstitutional to imprison for life \nwithout parole a juvenile “whose crimes reflect unfortunate yet transient immaturity” rather than \n“irreparable corruption”.  Miller, 567 U.S. at 479-80.  In furtherance of this substantive right, the \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized that a juvenile’s “demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation” \nis what entitles him to a “meaningful opportunity to obtain release”.  Id. at 479 (citing Graham, \n560 U.S. at 75). \n121.  As a “procedural” matter, “a sentencer [must] consider a juvenile offender’s youth \nand attendant characteristics before determining that life without parole” is “proportionate” to the \noffense.  Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734.  The sentencer does not have unfettered discretion to \ntreat youth as a mere “factor” and assign said factor the weight he or she chooses.  Rather, youth \nis a constitutionally relevant status that makes certain forms of punishment unlawful.  The status \nof youth triggers the substantive guarantee that a juvenile not be imprisoned for life for a crime \nthat reflects transient characteristics of youth because to do so would be to impose a \ndisproportionate punishment. \n122.  Accordingly, the sentencer must “d[o] more than [merely] consider a juvenile \noffender’s youth before imposing life without parole”, id. at 734 (emphasis added), and must \ninstead analyze whether the crime reflects transient factors of youth or permanent incorrigibility.  \nId. \n123.  Proceedings bearing on life sentences for juvenile offenders must, in order to \navoid being categorically unconstitutional, afford juvenile lifers who have evolved from a \ntroubled, misguided youth to a model inmate, a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that \nchildren who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change.  Id. at 724. \n30 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 31 of 62\n \n124.  Accordingly, sentencing regimes that subject juvenile offenders to life with the \npossibility of parole are only constitutional insofar as the state provides a “meaningful \nopportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation”.  Miller, 567 \nU.S. at 479 (quoting Graham, 560 U.S. at 75). \n125.  Those substantive and procedural rights apply at parole hearings where a person \nwho committed a crime as a child faces possible life imprisonment if parole is denied.  After all, \n“[a] parole board is no more entitled to subject an offender to the penalty of life in prison in \ncontravention of this rule than is a legislature or a sentencing court”.  Hawkins v. New York \nState Dep’t of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 140 A.D.3d 34, 38 (3d Dep’t 2016); Putland v. New \nYork State Dep’t of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 158 A.D.3d 633 (2d Dep’t 2018). \n126.  The U.S. Supreme Court allows life with parole sentences only because it \nunderstands parole to be “a regular part of the rehabilitative process.  Assuming good behavior, \n[parole] is the normal expectation in the vast majority of cases.”  Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, \n300-01 (1983) (citations omitted). \nII. NEW YORK SUBJECTS JUVENILE LIFERS TO UNCONSTITUTIONALLY \nDISPROPORTIONATE PUNISHMENT BY DENYING THEM A MEANINGFUL \nAND REALISTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR RELEASE BASED ON DEMONSTRATED \nMATURITY AND REHABILITATION. \nA.  New York sentencing law mandates life with the possibility of parole for \njuvenile offenders as young as 13 years old. \n127.  Under New York sentencing law, children aged 16 and 17 are sentenced to an \nindeterminate sentence with a mandatory maximum term of life imprisonment if convicted of a \nclass A felony, with the minimum term for a class A-I felony ranging from 15 to 25 years.  N.Y. \nPenal Law §§ 70.00(2)(a), 70.00(3)(a)(i).  Children as young as 13 years old who are convicted \nof murder receive an automatic maximum sentence of life in prison with opportunity for parole.  \nN.Y. CPL §§ 1.20(42), 180; N.Y. Penal Law § 70.05(2)(a). \n31 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 32 of 62\n \n128.  Under the New York Penal Law, a defendant’s age and maturity, the transient \ncharacteristics attendant to youth, and a defendant’s capacity for rehabilitation play no role \nwhatsoever in setting the maximum sentence for those convicted of murder or other class A-I \nfelonies for which the mandatory maximum sentence is life. \n129.  The only mechanism, under New York law, by which the substantive right of \njuvenile lifers to be provided with a meaningful opportunity for release can be secured is through \nthe Board of Parole. \nB.  New York parole law fails to afford juvenile lifers a meaningful and realistic \nopportunity for release upon rehabilitation. \n130.  The New York parole practices and procedures fail to provide juvenile lifers a \n“meaningful” or “realistic” opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation. \n131.  The Board of Parole has interpreted the New York Executive Law to allow it to \ndeny parole to juvenile lifers if Defendants, in their subjective judgment, without regard to the \nindividual’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation subsequent to the crime, believe that \nrelease would be “not compatible with the welfare of society” or would “so deprecate the \nseriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law”.  See N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-i(2)(c)(A). \n132.  Defendant Stanford told the Senate Crime Victims, Crime and Correction \nCommittee on February 15, 2018, that she understands the statutory language “deprecate the \nseriousness of the offense as to undermine respect for the law” to permit Commissioners to deny \nparole if they, in their personal opinion, believe that release for particular offenders who \ncommitted serious crimes “would so undermine respect for the law in the mind of the community \n[the offenders] would be going back to”.  Defendant Stanford termed this consideration as \n32 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 33 of 62\n \n“community opposition” although it is not statutorily authorized under New York’s Executive \nLaw. \n133.  As a result, Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, juvenile lifers release \nto parole supervision based only on the crime committed or juvenile criminal history, despite \nclear evidence of rehabilitation and maturity. \n134.  Defendants’ failures are illustrated in their treatment of the Named Plaintiffs. \n135.  Defendants denied parole ten times to Plaintiff Carlos Flores, who had been \nincarcerated for 37 years, had a “low risk across the board” COMPAS risk assessment and had \nnot had a disciplinary ticket in 25 years. \n136.  Despite Mr. Flores’s impeccable record, on October 24, 2017, Defendants Smith, \nCrangle and Demosthenes denied Mr. Flores release to parole supervision stating, without \nsubstantiation, that “discretionary release is not warranted due to concern for the public safety \nand welfare” and that “release at this time would not be compatible with the welfare of society \nand would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the Instant Offense and undermine respect for the \nlaw”.  The only treatment in Defendants’ decision given to Mr. Flores’s juvenile status at the \ntime of the offense was relegated to the following conclusory, passive voice statement:  “[y]our \nage at the time of the offense, family situation and lack of maturity is noted”. \n137.  On May 23, 2018—after Mr. Flores’s fourth hearing in just over two-and-a-half \nyears—he was granted parole release on the basis of the following factors:  “In prison you have \nparticipated in all recommended programs, have earned a Bachelor’s Degree, have put together a \nsolid release plan, gained insight and exhibited remorse for the victim’s family.  Your record \nfeatures a clean disciplinary record for over twenty-five years, and your overall low risk and \nneed scores is noted.”  Tellingly, the “factors” cited to approve release were identical to the \n33 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 34 of 62\n \nfactors present at Mr. Flores’s prior hearings but were dismissed as insufficient to warrant \nrelease out of concern for the welfare of society three times in the prior years.  The panel also \nnoted in its grant decision that Mr. Flores’s release “should not be interpreted as mitigating or \ndiscounting [his] participation in the felony murder of an off-duty police officer”.  The only new \nfactor was his status as a named representative in this lawsuit. \n138.  Defendants also denied parole release to Plaintiff Lawrence Bartley at his LCTA \ninterview, which he earned for “significant programmatic accomplishment” and an excellent \ndisciplinary record.  Defendants Cruse and Drake acknowledged Mr. Bartley’s “exceptional \npacket, institutional accomplishments . . . overall low COMPAS score and satisfactory case \nplan. . . release planning, community outreach, use of media, networking and your life as an \nexample exemplifies an extraordinary effort to give back, [sic] demonstrates restoration and \nevidenced change”.  On September 6, 2017, they nevertheless concluded, without any basis, that \n“there is a reasonable probability that you would not live and remain at liberty without again \nviolating the law and that your release would be incompatible with the welfare of society and \nwould so deprecate the serious nature of the crime as to undermine respect for the law”.  \nDefendants Cruse and Drake also cited opposition to Mr. Bartley’s release.  Their decision, \nhowever, failed to even mention that Mr. Bartley was a juvenile at the time of the offense or \nconsider the hallmark features of youth as they relate to culpability or the constitutional \nrelevance of the exceptional evidence of maturity and rehabilitation. \n139.  On April 9, 2018, Mr. Bartley was granted parole.  The factors cited in support of \nhis release include “your age of 17 at the time of the offense including the diminished culpability \nof youth and the growth and maturity since the time of the offense; your low risk assessment \nscores; your efforts toward rehabilitation including your receipt of LCTA; your expression of \n34 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 35 of 62\n \nremorse for the victim as well as his family and your efforts to apologize to your victims; your \nrelease plans, letters of support and reasonable assurance from your family members, official \nletters including your attorney’s letter; letters from facility personnel, prospective employers and \nothers; commendable behavior reports and letters of commendation received; your parole packet; \nsentencing minutes; your programs completions throughout your sentence; good disciplinary and \ninstitutional record”. \n140.  These factors were identical to the factors present seven months previously when \nDefendants concluded in September 2017 that parole should be denied because “there is \nreasonable probability that you would not live and remain at liberty without again violating the \nlaw and that your release would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so \ndeprecate the serious nature of the crime as to undermine respect for the law”.  In April 2018, \nDefendants affirmed that Mr. Bartley’s “release should in no way be interpreted as mitigating or \ndiscounting the seriousness of [his] actions and the terrible loss of life [he] caused”.  The only \nnew factor in April 2018 was his status as a named representative in this lawsuit. \n141.  By the time he was granted release in September 2018, Defendants had denied \nparole release eight times to Demetrius Bennett, who had been incarcerated 14 years beyond his \nminimum sentence and had demonstrated growth over his 23 years of incarceration.  On \nSeptember 13, 2017, Defendants Agostini and Davis and former Defendant Thompson denied \nMr. Bennett release to parole supervision stating, without substantiation, that the “panel is not \nconvinced that if released you would live at liberty without once again violating the law or that \nyour release would not so deprecate the offense as to undermine respect for the law”.  The \ndecision’s consideration of youth was to note in passing that Mr. Bennett was “15 years old at \nthe time and [was] following the lead of [his] friends and their uncle”. \n35 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 36 of 62\n \n142.  In addition, by the time he was granted release in September 2018, Defendants \nhad denied parole release to Plaintiff Antonio Roman three times despite significant evidence of \nrehabilitation and maturity.  The decision from Mr. Roman’s September 20, 2016 hearing \nfocused substantially on the nature of the crime of conviction, rather than his youth at the time of \nthe crime.  The Commissioners noted that they had “considered [his] age at the time of the crime \nand diminished culpability at the time”, but nonetheless ultimately denied release, stating that \nMr. Roman’s “release would be incompatible with the welfare of society and would so deprecate \nthe serious nature of the crime . . . as to undermine respect for the law”. \n143.  Defendants have denied parole release to Plaintiff Vintarra Martin two times, \ndespite substantial evidence of her growth and rehabilitation.  The decision from her April 27, \n2021 Hearing commends her “well-organized parole packet, release plans [and] multiple letters \nof support” as well as her “positive programming in the college program and several programs \nthat [she] completed”.  Despite this, the panel denied her release to parole, citing that she \n“brutally killed [her] mother” and that “[her] actions were heinous and [showed] a total disregard \nfor human life”.  The decision states that the panel was “concerned with the extreme violent \nnature of [her] actions as well as [her] ongoing course of conduct . . . before, during and after the \ncommission of [the] offense” and that “release would be incompatible with the welfare of society \nand would so deprecate the seriousness of [Ms. Martin’s] crime as to undermine respect for the \nlaw”.  \n144.  Defendants have also twice denied parole release to Plaintiff Terrance Anderson \ndespite his growth and rehabilitation.  While the denial decision for Anderson’s April 24, 2019 \nhearing states that the panel “considered” factors such as “youth, relationships at home, [and] \ndevelopment within the family”, the panel’s reasoning for the denial focused exclusively on the \n36 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 37 of 62\n \ninstant offense and Mr. Anderson’s juvenile record.  The denial decision did not acknowledge \neven once any of Mr. Anderson’s educational accomplishments, vocational certificates, \nrehabilitative and therapeutic programs, release plan, letters of support and reasonable assurance, \nor any other evidence demonstrating his growth during incarceration.  Instead, it concludes that \n“the victim’s account throughout the sentencing minutes is compelling, leaving the Panel to \nsense the impact [Mr. Anderson’s] behavior has caused and ultimately the strong language \nfeatured in the official opposition to [his] release underscores that which the Panel concurs, \ndiscretionary release is not warranted”.  The victim’s account and opposition letters were not \nonce mentioned during his April 2019 parole hearing.  \n145.  As evidenced by their denial of release to the Named Plaintiffs, Defendants \ncontinue to deny juvenile lifers release to parole supervision even after they have demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation. \n146.  Defendants’ reliance on the nature of a juvenile crime, prior juvenile record, \njuvenile disciplinary history, and “official”, “community” or victim opposition to deny release \ndeprives juvenile lifers of the opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation.  This opportunity is required to bring life with parole sentencing regimes into \ncompliance with the Eighth Amendment’s proscription against disproportionate punishment. \nC.  The Board of Parole willfully violates the rights of juvenile lifers. \n147.  In 2016, the Third Department of New York State Supreme Court, Appellate \nDivision found the Board of Parole in violation of clearly established law under the Eighth \nAmendment because, “[t]he Board, as the entity charged with determining whether [Hawkins] \nwill serve a life sentence, was required to consider the significance of [Hawkins’s] youth and its \nattendant circumstances at the time of the commission of the crime before making a parole \ndetermination.”  Hawkins, 140 A.D.3d 34, 36 (3d Dep’t 2016). \n37 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 38 of 62\n \n148.  In response to the Hawkins decision and the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \nMontgomery, the Board eventually gave notice of proposed regulations that reflected \nDefendants’ official position regarding their legal obligations under the Eighth Amendment and \nthe Due Process Clause.  Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, Proposed \nRulemaking, I.D. No. CCS-39-16-00004-P (Sept. 28, 2016). \n149.  The proposed regulations provided that an inmate’s juvenile status at the time of \nthe crime for which he or she is currently serving an indeterminate life sentence is merely one of \nmany factors that the Board must “consider”, and continued to permit Defendants to deny parole \nbased solely on their subjective assessment of the crime of conviction.  Dep’t of Corrections and \nCommunity Supervision, Proposed Rulemaking, I.D. No. CCS-39-16-00004-P (Sept. 28, 2016).  \nNumerous comments pointed out to the Board that the proposed regulations were facially \ninadequate to ensure that the hundreds of juvenile lifers currently incarcerated in DOCCS \ncustody receive a meaningful opportunity for release because the regulations did not require the \nBoard to base its release determination on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. \n150.  Even after the Hawkins decision and the notice of the proposed regulations, but \nprior to the adoption of the proposed regulations, the Board continued to interpret its power in a \nmanner inconsistent with the constitutional rule.  In Mr. Roman’s February 2017 administrative \nappeal decision, the Appeals Unit affirmed the Board’s September 2016 denial decision and \nrejected Mr. Roman’s argument that the Board ignored that he was only 17 years old at the time \nof the crime.  The Appeals Unit held that “the Board interview and decision was very much \naware of this mandated factor and discussed and reviewed it thoroughly”.  However, the only \ndiscussion of Mr. Roman’s age at the time of the crime during the September 2016 interview was \nthe following:  “We recognize that 17-year-olds have somewhat of a diminished capacity \n38 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 39 of 62\n \ncompared to adults.”  The parole denial decision merely states that “the panel has considered \nyour young age at the time of the crime and diminished culpability”.  Furthermore, in \nMr. Roman’s administrative appeal decision, the Appeals Unit stated the following:  “Nothing in \nthe due process clause requires the Parole Board to specify the particular evidence on which rests \nthe discretionary determination an inmate is not ready for conditional release. . . . There is no due \nprocess requirement that the Parole Board disclose its release criteria”.  The Appeals Unit also \nstated that “[t]he Board may deny parole release without the existence of any aggravating \nfactors, no matter how exemplary the institutional record is”. \n151.  Despite the objections to the proposed regulations, the Board formally adopted \nthese regulations, which became effective on September 27, 2017, without substantive changes \nand without curing the constitutional defects in them. \n152.  Subsequent to the adoption of the new regulations, and demonstrating their \ninadequacy, Plaintiff Carlos Flores was again denied parole based solely on the nature of his \ncrime and without a meaningful opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation.  Defendants Smith, Crangle and Demosthenes failed to apply the constitutionally \nmandated standard to the ample evidence of Mr. Flores’s rehabilitation and maturation.  They \nignored the Board’s own COMPAS instrument finding Mr. Flores to be a low risk for \nreoffending; they ignored the fact that he had not had a disciplinary ticket in the past 25 years; \nand they ignored the fact that he was a 54-year-old man who had served 16 years beyond the \nminimum term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge in full light of the facts of the \ncrime.  Instead, Defendants Smith, Crangle and Demosthenes denied Mr. Flores release on the \nunsubstantiated formulaic “conclusion” that his “discretionary release at this time, would not be \n39 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 40 of 62\n \ncompatible with the welfare of society and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant \noffense and undermine respect for the law”. \n153.  This decision was administratively appealed on December 15, 2017, with a \nlengthy submission by counsel for Mr. Flores explaining, yet again, the constitutional standard \nthat the Board must follow when considering the applications for parole by juvenile lifers. \n154.  On March 6, 2018, the Board decided the administrative appeal.  The Parole \nBoard Appeals Unit, including Defendant Chairwoman Stanford, ordered a de novo interview on \nthe basis that Commissioners did not explain what “course of conduct, before, during, and after” \nthe crime 36 years ago it found concerning.  Notably, it refused to instruct Commissioners that \nthe Eighth Amendment requires Defendants to release Mr. Flores to parole supervision if he has \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation and instead affirmed the unlawful standard under which \nit had denied Mr. Flores’s release stating, in part, that “the applicable principles and factors were \ndiscussed and considered by the Board in reaching its determination”. \n155.  Defendants showed similar disregard for their obligations under applicable \nconstitutional law in deciding the administrative appeal of Mr. Bartley’s September 6, 2017 \ndenial.  On November 7, 2017, counsel submitted a lengthy brief perfecting the appeal \nidentifying the numerous substantive and procedural defects in Defendants’ consideration that \ndenied Mr. Bartley a meaningful opportunity for release, including Defendants’ failure to render \ntheir decision based on Mr. Bartley’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.  In February \n2018, the Appeals Unit, including Defendant Chairwoman Stanford, ordered a new hearing on \nthe sole basis that Defendants failed to seek the recommendation of his trial attorney in advance \nof the interview in violation of N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-i(2)(c)(A)(vii).  The Appeals Unit refused \n40 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 41 of 62\n \nto issue any findings of fact or law that would prevent the same defects from infecting his future \ninterview and the panel’s deliberation process. \n156.  Since Hawkins, a number of New York State courts have found Defendants in \nviolation of their legal obligation to provide persons serving indeterminate life sentences with a \nmeaningful opportunity for release.  See, e.g., Martin v. Stanford, 58 Misc. 3d 345 (N.Y. Sup. \nCt., Cayuga County 2017); Darshan v. New York State Dep’t of Corrs. & Cmty. Supervision, \nNo. 652/2017 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Dutchess County July 18, 2017); Putland v. New York State Dep’t \nof Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 158 A.D.3d 633 (2d Dep’t 2018); Ruiz v. New York State Div. of \nParole, No. 2310-2017 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Dutchess County Apr. 5, 2018).  The plaintiffs in these \ncases were all released after the court decisions, one after serving decades beyond his minimum \nsentence. \n157.  Defendants continue to conduct unlawful hearings and refuse to extend requisite \nprocedural protections necessary to secure Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ substantive rights. \nD.  The Board of Parole’s procedures violate the law. \n158.  The sheer volume of work before Defendants precludes the opportunity for Class \nMembers to be meaningfully heard and to receive decisions rendered based on demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation. \n159.  Although the State is authorized to staff the Board of Parole with 19 members, it \nis currently staffed by 14 Commissioners.  These 14 Commissioners must conduct upwards of \n10,000 parole interviews annually, in addition to sitting on appeals panels, staffing \nsubcommittees, conducting victim impact interviews, traveling for interviews and engaging in \nadministrative upkeep. \n160.  Interview panels consist of two to three Commissioners.  Each week, each panel \nis assigned approximately 40 to 70 interviews, which are usually conducted over only two \n41 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 42 of 62\n \ndays—Tuesday and Wednesday—as Mondays are reserved for travel and Fridays are reserved \nfor victim interviews.  The majority of interviews are conducted by video conference.  This \nmeans each panel interviews between 20 and 35 applicants a day. \n161.  Each of these applicants typically submits supporting materials (a “parole \npacket”), which include a personal statement, programmatic achievements and letters of support.  \nThe parole packet may contain hundreds of pages of material. \n162.  Defendant Stanford has testified that these parole files and packets are sometimes \ndelivered by prison staff and Offender Rehabilitation Counselors (“ORCs”) to the field office \nwhere the video conferences take place on Monday, the day before the interviews.  She has also \ntestified that Defendants often do not receive the parole files and packets prior to the morning of \nthe interviews. \n163.  Defendant Stanford has testified that Commissioners typically arrive in the city or \ntown where the video conferencing of the interviews will take place on Monday the day or \nevening before the interviews, which begin at 8 a.m. the following morning. \n164.  Once Commissioners arrive in a city on Monday, they check into assigned hotels \nand, according to Defendant Chairwoman Stanford, they may then review parole files if the files \nhave been delivered, in their hotel rooms, “at their leisure”. \n165.  No regulation or policy requires Defendants to read parole materials before \nconducting an interview and making release decisions, and, according to Defendant Stanford, \n“not everyone does it”. \n166.  On information and belief, Defendants often see the files for the first time at \n8 a.m. on the day of the interviews. \n42 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 43 of 62\n \n167.  The Board divides the weekly interview caseload by the total seated \nCommissioners to assign a “lead” Commissioner to each case.  During the interviews, only the \nlead Commissioner has a copy of the entire parole file.  The full file may contain hundreds of \npages of material documenting rehabilitation and reform, including: \n  personal statements composed by the parole applicant; \n  detailed release plans; \n  vocational accomplishments; \n  programming completion; \n  educational achievements; \n  educational transcripts; \n  letters from family members showing support; \n  letters from those who have had personal contact with the applicant \nsupporting release and describing the reasons why they feel the applicant \nis safe to release; \n  job offers; \n  drug and alcohol treatment completion certificates; \n  commendable behavior reports; \n  prison work assignment assessments; and \n  statements of remorse or essays written by the applicant discussing insight \ninto his or her crime. \n168.  Defendant Stanford has testified that the one or two Commissioners other than the \nlead Commissioner have only what is called a “book copy”, which includes only four things:  a \ncondensed version of the Parole Board Report (a one-page sheet consisting primarily of \ncheckboxes with basic information such as the applicant’s birth date, crimes of commitment,  \n43 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 44 of 62\n \nwhether there are sentencing minutes or not, etc.), the COMPAS report, a modified rap sheet and \nthe applicant’s disciplinary record. \n169.  Defendant Stanford has testified that the “book copy” contains all of the \ninformation necessary to make the decision and that all other information is “less pertinent”. \n170.  Notably, the “book copy” does not include letters of support, personal statements, \ncommendable behavior reports or any of the most relevant and detailed materials that would \ndemonstrate rehabilitation, remorse, reform and suitability for community reentry. \n171.  The lead Commissioner typically asks all of the questions in the interview. \n172.  Although Defendant Stanford testified that interviews typically last 20 minutes, \non information and belief, inmates often have less than 10 minutes to make their case for release \nbecause the bulk of the “interview” consists of the lead Commissioner recounting the details of \nthe crime; longer interviews are usually provided only where the applicant is represented by \ncounsel or if the prior determination was overturned by a reviewing court. \n173.  On information and belief, during the interview the other Commissioners are \noften not listening to the questions and answers during the pending interview, but instead are \npreparing for subsequent hearings on which they must take the “lead”. \n174.  Despite this lack of materials and information or direct engagement from the non-\nlead Commissioners in a given interview, each Commissioner on the panel has an equal vote to \ngrant or deny release. \n175.  On information and belief, outcomes are often predetermined prior to the \ninterview and sometimes decision language is pre-written on a typed form denial.  This is a clear \nviolation of the “guarantee against arbitrary and irrational government action”, which includes \nthe “right to a hearing before a fact-finder that has not predetermined the outcome of the \n44 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 45 of 62\n \nhearing”.  Duffy v. Evans, No. 11 Civ. 7605 JMF, 2012 WL 4327605, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 19, \n2012). \n176.  To the extent the decision was not predetermined, the “deliberations” typically \nlast between two to five minutes immediately following the interview and prior to commencing \nthe next interview.  The final decision is then read into the record and transcribed by the \nstenographer. \n177.  On any given hearing day, a Board of Parole panel will potentially conduct 20 to \n35 interviews in less than eight hours.  Defendants, therefore, lack the time or inclination to read \nand evaluate the materials presented to them in the information packets, and routinely show up \nunprepared for the parole interviews (as occurred in many of the most recent interviews of the \nNamed Plaintiffs). \n178.  These procedural inadequacies are exacerbated because the Board does not permit \ncounsel to appear or give statements at parole interviews. \ni.  Commissioners have no training on which to base their decisions and do \nnot solicit expert evaluations of the maturation and rehabilitation of \njuvenile lifers. \n179.  On information and belief, 12 of the 16 Defendants have no substantial training in \nany discipline—such as child psychology, criminology or social work—that would enable them \nto competently evaluate whether an underlying crime reflected the transient immaturity of youth \nor instead permanent incorrigibility. \n180.  Commissioners do not seek input from experts competent to attest to the extent of \nmaturation and rehabilitation of juvenile lifers eligible for parole release. \n181.  The Board does not make available funds for inmates to retain their own \nexperts—such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers or criminologists—who could \n45 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 46 of 62\n \nopine on whether the underlying crime reflected transient immaturity or permanent \nincorrigibility and whether the inmate has demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. \n182.  The prevalence of mental impairments among juvenile offenders is substantially \nhigher than among adolescents who are not involved with the justice system.  See generally, Lee \nUnderwood & Aryssa Washington, Mental Illness and Juvenile Offenders, 13 Int. J. Environ. \nRes. & Pub. Health 228 (2016).  Lack of access to psychological experts significantly raises the \nrisk that a person serving a life sentence for crimes committed as a juvenile is denied parole \nbased on undiagnosed psychiatric or cognitive impairments, which are often untreated in prison.  \nSee id. \nii.  Commissioners improperly use risk assessment tools. \n183.  Due process requires, at a minimum, that parole release decisions be made based \non accurate information.  See, e.g., United States v. Romano, 825 F.2d 725, 728 (2d Cir. 1987) \n(citing Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 741 (1948)). \n184.  The Board relies upon a risk and needs tool, called COMPAS, that does not \nspecifically consider the diminished culpability of juveniles and the hallmark features of youth. \n185.  On information and belief, COMPAS fails to incorporate juvenile rehabilitative \ncapacities into its algorithm. \n186.  On information and belief, COMPAS sometimes treats youth as an aggravating \nfactor.  For example, it counts as negative not having a job prior to incarceration, not being \nmarried and the age of first offense, includes juvenile justice encounters at very young ages in \nthe criminal involvement score and uses Plaintiffs’ current age to predict risk of felony violence.  \nDefendants’ use of COMPAS thereby disadvantages Plaintiffs and Class Members who were \nsentenced as juveniles to serve longer sentences than their adult counterparts. \n46 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 47 of 62\n \n187.  For example, Mr. Bennett was only 15 years old at the time of his crime and had a \nmedium “risk of felony violence” score on his 2013 COMPAS by virtue of his youth.  On \ninformation and belief, Mr. Bennett’s medium “risk of felony violence” score relied on \ncriminological actuarial tables that classify individuals within a group and assess risk based on \ncertain shared characteristics with others in that group.  On information and belief, one of the \nmost important determinants of this particular score is the inmate’s current age.  Therefore, \nyoung juvenile offenders, such as Mr. Bennett, who have served their minimum sentences and \nbecome parole-eligible in their twenties or thirties, are statistically predicted to have higher risk \nfor felony violence and will be denied parole irrespective of their rehabilitation and reform. \n188.  COMPAS is a commercial product sold by Northpointe Inc.  On information and \nbelief, Defendants either have not asked Northpointe to disclose its secret algorithms or have \nacquiesced in the refusal by Northpointe to do so.  As a result, COMPAS is a black box.  \nDefendants’ reliance upon COMPAS, without knowing how or whether COMPAS considers the \ndiminished culpability of juveniles and the hallmark features of youth, fails to comply with \nDefendants’ legal obligations. \n189.  Plaintiffs and Class Members lack knowledge and are denied information about \nhow their COMPAS scores are calculated, what variables enter into the scores, how variables are \nweighted in the algorithmic prediction, how the scores can be improved through rehabilitative \nefforts and whether there is any way to challenge the inclusion of erroneous information.  \nPlaintiffs and Class Members also have no way of knowing or contesting if impermissible \nfactors—such as age, race, family, poverty or sex—function as aggregating variables in the \npredictive instrument.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs and Class Members are denied a \nmeaningful opportunity for release based on individualized information and personal \n47 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 48 of 62\n \nrehabilitation and reform because the scores are based on statistical facts about membership in a \nsupposed statistical group. \n190.  On information and belief, Commissioners do not know or understand how the \nscores are generated because Northpointe considers COMPAS a proprietary instrument and a \ntrade secret. \n191.  Defendants have also refused to verify whether the COMPAS tool has been \nvalidated for youth or for developmental or mental disabilities, which are both overrepresented in \nthe population of serious juvenile offenders. \niii.  Commissioners use prior youthful criminal involvement or disciplinary \ntickets received as a juvenile as reasons for denying parole to juvenile \nlifers. \n192.  On information and belief, Defendants have access to and cite to previous \ninvolvement in the juvenile justice system and inmates’ disciplinary records from their time in \nOffice of Children and Family Services (“OCFS”) facilities as evidence that applicants are \nunsuitable for release. \n193.  For example, in the middle of Mr. Bartley’s September 6, 2017 parole hearing, \nDefendant Cruse indicated that he would consider Mr. Bartley’s disciplinary tickets in reaching a \nrelease decision, and the subsequent denial decision cited to Mr. Bartley’s prior youthful \ncriminal conviction as one of the reasons for denying his release.  The Board’s April 24, 2019 \ndecision denying Mr. Anderson release to parole likewise cited to Mr. Anderson’s prior \nadjudication as a juvenile delinquent and Persons in Need of Supervision (“PINS”) petition.  \nThat decision was affirmed by the Appeals Unit. \n194.  Defendants fail to account for youth when considering the institutional \ndisciplinary records of juvenile lifers imprisoned when they were still adolescents and not as able \n48 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 49 of 62\n \nas adults to control impulses, plan alternative courses of action and otherwise moderate their \nbehavior. \n195.  On information and belief, Defendants have access to and cite to disciplinary \ntickets issued to juvenile lifers when they were still juveniles being held at OCFS as the basis to \ndeny parole, without considering the hallmark features of youth or undiagnosed or untreated \nintellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism \nspectrum disorder and mental disorders such as post-traumatic-stress disorder, emotional \ndisturbances or childhood depression, all of which are exacerbated in incarcerated youth. \n196.  All policies, customs and practices associated with denying juvenile lifers a \nmeaningful and realistic opportunity for parole release reflect the official policy of the Board \nmade or acquiesced to by each Defendant.  Defendants’ actions involve reckless or callous \nindifference to the rights of Plaintiffs and similarly situated persons serving life sentences for \ncrimes committed as minors. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n197.  Named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of a class consisting of all persons \neligible for release to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes committed when they \nwere children under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life sentences with the \npossibility of parole in the custody of DOCCS. \n198.  This action meets the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) as follows: \ni.  The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all of its members is \nimpracticable.  In New York, there are approximately 630 persons \ncurrently serving life sentences for offenses they committed between the \nages of 13 and 17.  (DOCCS Statistics on Under Custody Population as of \nJan. 16, 2016, at 1.)  Those people are now, or will be in the future, \n49 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 50 of 62\n \neligible for release to parole supervision.  While the exact size of the \nproposed class may not be known at this time, there can be no doubt that a \nclass action is appropriate to address the systemic issues presented in this \ncase.  In addition, joinder of all members of the proposed class is \nimpracticable because membership of the proposed class constantly \nchanges, as additional juveniles receive life sentences with the possibility \nof parole, some later become parole-eligible and others are released under \nparole supervision. \nii.  The questions of law and fact presented by the Named Plaintiffs are \ncommon to other members of the class.  Such questions include, generally, \nwhether, under federal law, Defendants provide a meaningful opportunity \nfor release upon demonstrated rehabilitation and maturity.  More \nspecifically: \na.  Whether Plaintiffs have been subject to disproportionate \npunishment and deprived of due process of law by being denied \na meaningful and realistic opportunity for release based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation; \nb.  Whether New York State Executive Law governing parole \nrelease violates the Eighth Amendment rights of Class Members \nto be free of disproportionate punishment; \nc.  Whether Defendants’ policies and practices in conducting parole \nrelease interviews and making parole release decisions violate \n50 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 51 of 62\n \nthe Eighth Amendment rights of Class Members to be free of \ndisproportionate punishment; \nd.  Whether Defendants’ policies and practices in conducting parole \nrelease interviews and making parole release decisions infringe \non the Due Process rights of Class Members; \ne.  Whether Defendants’ parole decisions are rendered based on \ndemonstrated maturity and rehabilitation or are based solely on \nthe nature of a Class Member’s crime committed as a juvenile or \na Class Member’s juvenile history; \nf.  Whether the volume of work before the Board precludes the \nopportunity for Class Members to be meaningfully heard; \ng.  Whether Defendants adequately review the supporting materials \nin order to enable Class Members to demonstrate maturity and \nrehabilitation; \nh.  Whether the limited length of parole interviews conducted by \nDefendants deprives Class Members of a meaningful and \nrealistic opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity \nand rehabilitation; \ni.  Whether denying Class Members the appointment of counsel and \nopportunity of counsel to be present at interviews deprives Class \nMembers of a meaningful and realistic opportunity for release \nbased on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation and due \nprocess of law; \n51 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 52 of 62\n \nj.  Whether denying Class Members the right to see and confront \nevidence against them deprives Class Members of a meaningful \nand realistic opportunity for release based on demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation and due process of law; \nk.  Whether Defendants’ failure to give Class Members any \nexplanation as to what additional steps they must take to be \ngranted parole deprives Class Members of a meaningful and \nrealistic opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity \nand rehabilitation; \nl.  Whether Defendants’ reliance on the nature of a juvenile crime, \nprior juvenile record, juvenile disciplinary history, and “official”, \n“community” or victim opposition to deny release deprives Class \nMembers of a meaningful and realistic opportunity for release \nbased on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation; \nm.  Whether Defendants’ reliance on a “book copy”, rather than an \nentire parole packet, deprives Class Members of a meaningful \nand realistic opportunity for release based on demonstrated \nmaturity and rehabilitation; \nn.  Whether Defendants’ reliance on COMPAS, which does not \nspecifically consider the diminished culpability of juveniles and \nthe hallmark features of youth, and indeed sometimes treats \nyouth as an aggravating factor, to deny release deprives Class \n52 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 53 of 62\n \nMembers of a meaningful and realistic opportunity for release \nbased on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation; and \no.  Whether Defendants deny parole based on an aggravating factor \nrelating to the crime of conviction that was not an element of the \njury verdict, judicial finding or guilty plea convicting Class \nMembers at their original criminal trials. \niii.  The violations alleged by Named Plaintiffs are typical of those suffered by \nthe class.  The entire class will benefit from the relief sought. \niv.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass.  Named Plaintiffs have no interests adverse to or in conflict with \nthose of the other Class Members.  Plaintiffs’ counsel have experience in \nconstitutional litigation.  Attorneys Issa Kohler-Hausmann and Avery \nGilbert have extensive knowledge about New York’s parole practice and \nprocedure.  Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, co-counsel for Plaintiffs, is a \nprivate law firm experienced in major class-action litigation. \nv.  The prosecution of separate actions by individual Class Members would \ncreate a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications that would establish \nincompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(b)(l)(A). \nvi.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to \nthe class, making appropriate declaratory or injunctive relief with respect \nto the class as a whole.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n53 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 54 of 62\n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n(For Violation of the Prohibition Against Cruel and Unusual Punishment in the Eighth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.) \n199.  The allegations of the preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference as if \nfully set forth herein. \n200.  Defendants, in their official capacity as Commissioners of the Board of Parole, \nhave acted and are acting under color of state law. \n201.  The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbids a statutory scheme that \nmandates life imprisonment for juvenile offenders or permits life sentences without providing \nthem with a realistic and meaningful opportunity for release upon demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation. \n202.  Defendants have denied and continue to deny Plaintiffs, and members of the class, \na meaningful opportunity for release by, among other things:  (1) failing to base their parole \ndeterminations on the demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation of juvenile lifers who are eligible \nfor parole; (2) failing to give juvenile lifers any explanation as to what additional steps they must \ntake to be recommended for parole; (3) denying release to parole supervision based upon crimes \njuvenile lifers committed decades ago that they cannot change; (4) failing to fully consider, read \nor attend to an inmate’s parole submission; (5) denying juvenile lifers the right to have an \nattorney present at their interviews and the right to see and confront any evidence against them; \nand (6) using risk assessment tools that discriminate against youth.  With these actions, \nDefendants have denied Plaintiffs and other members of the class a meaningful and realistic \nopportunity for release upon their showing of maturity and rehabilitation, in violation of the \nEighth Amendment. \n54 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 55 of 62\n \n203.  Plaintiffs Carlos Flores, Lawrence Bartley, Demetrius Bennett, Antonio Roman, \nVintarra Martin and Terrance Anderson, and members of the class, have been injured and will \nlikely suffer future injury by Defendants’ policies and practices by being denied their rights to \nmeaningful opportunity for release from imprisonment notwithstanding their youth at the time of \ntheir offense and despite their demonstration of maturity and rehabilitation, in violation of the \nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishments in the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution, giving rise to Plaintiffs’ and Class Members’ claims for relief under \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(For Violation of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, \nactionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.) \n204.  The allegations of the preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference as if \nfully set forth herein. \n205.  Defendants, in their official capacity as Commissioners of the Board of Parole, \nhave acted and are acting under color of state law. \n206.  Under established U.S. Supreme Court case law, the Eighth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution confers upon juvenile lifers a legitimate expectancy of parole upon a showing \nof maturation and rehabilitation.  This is a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. \n207.  In 2011, the New York Legislature amended the Executive Law to mandate that \nthe Board of Parole “establish written procedures” that “shall incorporate risk and needs \nprinciples to measure” the rehabilitation of inmates.  N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-c(4).  The Executive \nLaw, as amended in 2011, provides prisoners with a legitimate expectancy that if they \ndemonstrate rehabilitation and a strong likelihood of future compliance with the law, they will be \ngranted parole.  This is a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. \n55 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 56 of 62\n \n208.  In 2017, the Board of Parole amended its regulations to require that its decision-\nmaking “shall be guided by risk and needs principles”.  9 NYCRR § 8002.2(a).  The regulations \nacknowledge a presumption of release upon rehabilitation (notwithstanding nonbinding \ndisclaimers in the commentary) by requiring Commissioners to provide nonconclusory \nindividualized reasons based in the record for any departure from the conclusions of a validated \nrisk assessment instrument, but only when that departure is denying release.  Id.  The regulations \nalso require Commissioners to address all statutory factors in each hearing.  Id. § 8002.2(c).  The \nBoard of Parole regulations, as amended in 2017, provide prisoners with a legitimate expectation \nthat if they demonstrate rehabilitation and a strong likelihood of future compliance with the law, \nthey will be granted parole.  This is a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. \n209.  Defendants’ conduct and actions—including, inter alia, regularly failing to read, \nreview and consider extensive evidence submitted to the Board demonstrating low risk to \ncommunity, rehabilitation and maturity—deny Plaintiffs, and members of the class, due process \nof law to secure their liberty interest in parole release, in violation of the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n210.  Plaintiffs Carlos Flores, Lawrence Bartley, Demetrius Bennett, Antonio Roman, \nVintarra Martin and Terrance Anderson, and members of the class, have been injured and will \nlikely suffer future injury, as a result of Defendants’ official policies and regular practices, which \nfail to adequately distinguish between persons serving life sentences for crimes committed as \nchildren and those committed as adults, and Defendants’ failure to provide sufficient procedural \nprotections necessary to secure the substantive right to release upon a showing of maturity and \nreform in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, giving rise to \nPlaintiffs’ and Class Members’ claims for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n56 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 57 of 62\n \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(For Violation of the Right to a Jury Trial in the Sixth Amendment and the Right to Due Process \nin the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.)1 \n211.  The allegations of the preceding paragraphs are incorporated by reference as if \nfully set forth herein. \n212.  Defendants, in their official capacity as Commissioners of the Board of Parole, \nhave acted and are acting under color of state law. \n213.  Each Plaintiff was, and Class Members were, convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, a \ncrime committed while he or she was a juvenile. \n214.  Any fact that enhances the penalty to which a criminal defendant may lawfully be \nsentenced must be found beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the criminal defendant.  See \nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000); Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 604-05 \n(2002); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 303-05 (2004); Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. \n99, 114-15 (2013). \n215.  A state may impose a life sentence upon a juvenile offender only upon a finding \nthat the defendant is among the “very rarest of juvenile offenders, those whose crimes reflect \npermanent incorrigibility”.  Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734. \n \n1 In its September 20, 2019 Opinion and Order, the Court dismissed the portion of Count III that asserted a \nSixth Amendment claim against Defendants for their practice of making novel findings of fact, in violation of the \njury trial right of the Sixth Amendment.  (ECF 137, at 22-25.)  Plaintiffs maintain that ruling to be error and \nmaintain the existing pleading here to avoid any potential implication of waiver.  Because Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss and the September 20, 2019 Opinion and Order did not address the separate Due Process Clause right \nrequiring a person to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of facts that would, if true, subject a person to \ncriminal punishment, Plaintiffs continue to assert their Fourteenth Amendment Due Process claim against \nDefendants for the practice of making administrative novel findings of fact, in violation of the Due Process right \nrequiring a person to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of facts that would, if true, subject a person to \ncriminal punishment.  See Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993); In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). \n \n57 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 58 of 62\n \n216.  Each Plaintiff was, and Class Members were, either convicted without a finding \nthat, or pleaded guilty without pleading to a fact that, Plaintiff’s and Class Members’ crimes \nreflected that they were among the rarest juveniles whose crimes reflect permanent \nincorrigibility. \n217.  Nor can Defendants deny parole release to juvenile lifers who have demonstrated \nunmistakable rehabilitation and have completed the statutory minimum term of imprisonment \nselected by the sentencing judge—a judge with full knowledge of the facts of the offense \nimposing a sentence within the range set by the legislature—on the basis of a fact about the \ncrime of commission that was not found beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the criminal \ndefendant. \n218.  Defendants’ conduct and actions—including, inter alia, taking into account facts \nthat impose greater punishment on the parole applicant than was authorized by a jury verdict, \njudicial finding or guilty plea—deny Plaintiffs, and members of the class, their right to have only \nfacts found beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the criminal defendants expose them to \npunishment, in violation of the jury trial right of the Sixth Amendment and their right to due \nprocess of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n219.  Plaintiffs Carlos Flores, Lawrence Bartley, Demetrius Bennett, Antonio Roman, \nVintarra Martin and Terrance Anderson, and members of the class, have been injured and will \nlikely suffer future injury, as a result of Defendants’ denial of parole release based on an \naggravating factor relating to the crime of conviction that was not an element proved beyond a \nreasonable doubt or admitted by the criminal defendants at their original criminal trial, in \nviolation of their right to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment and their right to due process \n58 \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB-JCM   Document 270   Filed 06/01/22   Page 59 of 62\n \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, giving rise to Plaintiffs’ and Class \nMembers’ claims for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n(a)  Certify a plaintiff class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

This  is  an  action  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief.  Plaintiffs  are  individuals \nwho  were  convicted  of crimes  committed  when  they  were  children  under  the  age  of  18  and \nsentenced  to  indeterminate  life  sentences  with  the  possibility  of parole.  Plaintiffs  have  been  and \ncontinue  to  be  subject to  disproportionate  punishment  and  deprived  of due  process  of law  by \nbeing  denied  a realistic  and  meaningful  opportunity  for  release  based  upon  demonstrated \nmaturity  and  rehabilitation. \n2.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  on  behalf of a  class  consisting  of all  persons  eligible  for \nrelease  to  parole  supervision  who  were  convicted  of crimes  committed  when  they were  children \nunder  the  age  of  18  and  sentenced  to  indeterminate  life  sentences  with  the  possibility  of parole  in \nthe  custody  of the  New  York  State  Department  of Corrections  and  Community  Supervision \n(“DOCCS’”)  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “juvenile  lifers”  or  “Class  Members”). \n3,  Juvenile  lifers,  including  Plaintiffs,  have  been,  continue  to  be,  or  will  be  denied  a \nmeaningful  opportunity  for  release  based  upon  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation,  in \nviolation  of the  cruel  and  unusual  punishments  clauses  of the  Eighth  Amendment to  the  U.S. \nConstitution  and New  York  Constitution  Article  I,  Section  5.  Juvenile  lifers,  including  Plaintiffs, \nhave  also  been,  continue  to  be,  or  will  be  denied  due  process  of law  in  the  manner  in  which  their \nparole  hearings  have  been  conducted,  in  violation  of the  due  process  clauses  of the  Fourteenth \nAmendment to  the  U.S.  Constitution  and New  York  Constitution  Article  I,  Section  6.  Juvenile \nlifers,  including  Plaintiffs,  have  also  been,  continue  to  be,  or  will  be  denied  their  right  to a trial\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  3  of  44 \nby jury  because  their  sentence  has  been  extended  by  findings  of fact  made  by  the  Board  of \nParole’s  commissioners,  in  violation  of the  Sixth Amendment  of the  United  State  Constitution \nand New  York  Constitution  Article  I,  Section  2. \n4.  Recognizing  that  fundamental  differences  between  children  and  adults  are \nrelevant to  assessing  proportionality  in  punishment,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  has,  in  a \nseries  of cases,  forbidden  as  unconstitutional  life  without  parole  for  all juveniles  except  for  the \n“rare juvenile  whose  crimes  reflect  irreparable  corruption”,  and  has  held  that this  substantive \nconstitutional  rule  is  retroactive.  Montgomery  v.  Louisiana,  136  S.  Ct.  718,  734  (2016)  (quoting \n  \nMiller  v.  Alabama,  132  S.  Ct.  2455,  2469  (2012));  Graham  v.  Florida,  560  U.S.  48,  82  (2010). \n5.  Taken  together,  these  decisions  establish  that  the  Eighth  Amendment to  the  U.S. \nConstitution  prohibits  statutory  schemes  that  fail  to  provide juvenile  lifers  with  a meaningful  and \nrealistic  opportunity  for  release  based  upon  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation.  See \nMiller,  132  S.  Ct.  at  2464;  Graham,  560  U.S.  at  50. \n6.  These  decisions  have  both  a  substantive  component,  which  applies  retroactively \nto  all juvenile  lifers  in  prison today,  and  a procedural  component,  which  applies  at  parole \nhearings  where juvenile  lifers  face  possible  life  imprisonment  if parole  is  denied.  See \nMontgomery,  136  S.  Ct.  at  734-35. \n7.  In New  York  State,  the  authority to  release  any  person  sentenced  to  a maximum \nterm  of life  prior to  the  end  of his  or  her  natural  life  lies  with  the  New  York  State  Board  of \nParole  (hereinafter  “Board  of Parole”  or  “Board”).  Defendants  are  each  Commissioners  of the \nBoard  of Parole,  and  are  sued  in  their  official  capacity  (hereinafter  “Commissioners”  or \nDefendants”).\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  4  of  44 \n8.  Despite  clear  precedent to  the  contrary,  Defendants  have  interpreted  the  New \nYork  Executive  Law  to  allow  Defendants  to  deny  parole  to juvenile  lifers  without  regard  to  an \nindividual’s  subsequent  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation,  if Defendants  determine  that \nrelease  would  be  “not  compatible  with  the  welfare  of society”  or  would  “so  deprecate  the \nseriousness  of his  crime  as  to  undermine  respect  for  law”.  See  N.Y.  Exec.  Law  §  259-1(2)(c)(A). \n9.  Accordingly,  Defendants  regularly  deny  parole  to juvenile  lifers,  such  as \nPlaintiffs,  who  demonstrate  unmistakable  rehabilitation  and  reform,  and  low  risk to  public  safety. \nDefendants  have  consistently  denied  such  individuals  parole  with  short  conclusory  opinions \nciting  only  factors  present  at  the  time  of conviction,  such  as juvenile  criminal  history  and  the \nnature  of the  crime  of conviction. \n10.  The  procedures  and  practices  of the  Board  of Parole,  as  executed  by  Defendants, \nthereby  deprive juvenile  lifers,  including  Plaintiffs,  of a meaningful  opportunity  for  release  based \non  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation  in  violation  of the  constitutional  prohibition  against \nexcessive  punishment.  The  formal  regulations  and  regular  practices  of the  Board  of Parole,  as \nexecuted  by  Defendants,  also  violate juvenile  lifers’,  including  Plaintiffs’,  Due  Process  rights, \nwhich  arise  from  the  liberty  interest  in  parole  conferred  by  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court’s  Eighth \nAmendment jurisprudence  and  by New  York  State  Executive  Law  and  the  Board’s  regulations. \n11.  Plaintiffs  do  not  challenge  their judgments  of conviction  and  do  not  seek to \ninvalidate  their  sentences.  Rather,  Plaintiffs  seek  an  order  that  Defendants  afford them,  and \nthose  similarly  situated,  as  persons  sentenced  to  life  imprisonment  for  offenses  committed  before \nthey were  18  years  old,  a  meaningful  opportunity  to  obtain  release  based  on  non-arbitrary  criteria \nthat  measure  their  degree  of maturity  and  rehabilitation.\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  5  of  44 \nJURISDICTION  AND  VENUE \n12.  This  Court  has jurisdiction  over  this  action  pursuant to  28  U.S.C.  §§  1331  and \n1343(a)(3).  The  controversy  arises  under  the  Sixth,  Eighth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the \nU.S.  Constitution.  The  Court  also  has  supplemental jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1367(a)  over \nadditional  claims  arising  under  State  law. \n13.  Venue  properly  lies  in  this  district  pursuant to  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b)(1)  and  (2) \nbecause  Plaintiffs  are  incarcerated  within  the  Southern  District  of New  York,  and  Defendants \nhave  conducted  parole  hearings  and  taken  other  actions  leading  to  the  denial  of Plaintiffs’  rights, \nas  alleged  further  herein,  within  the  Southern  District  of New  York. \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n1.  Plaintiff Carlos  Flores \n14.  Plaintiff Carlos  Flores  is  54  years  old  and  has  been  incarcerated  since  he  was  17. \nHe  was  convicted  of felony  murder  after  participating  in  a robbery  in  January  1981  that  resulted \nin  an  accomplice  shooting  an  individual  who  drew  a  gun. \n15.  Mr.  Flores  was  convicted  of murder  in  the  second  degree  and  sentenced  to  21 \nyears  to  life.  At  sentencing,  the judge  considered,  and  rejected,  a  lengthier  minimum  sentence  of \n25  years  because  Mr.  Flores  had  no  prior  criminal  record  and  was  not the  shooter.  Mr.  Flores \nhas  now  been  denied  parole  ten times.  He  has  been  incarcerated  for  37  years,  16 years  in  excess \nof the  21-year  minimum  set  by  the judge. \n16.  Mr.  Flores  had  a  difficult  upbringing.  He  was a  victim  of frequent  abuse  and \ndropped  out  of school  to  support  his  family  financially  by  working  at  a pizzeria.  He  was \nmanipulated  into  participating  in  a  robbery  by  a much  older  man  who  had  significant  influence \nover  him—a  man  who  had  shown  him  friendship  and  who  he  had  thought  was  a mentor.  During \n5\néW  eNnce Ekee N   FOF EO.<  Ye Drashe   PYaOsRcU  efAit PeOh e   ONW EDFw ke   PsLtrAreO  CAPSwh et ePE S &  4:   Pe TLTaA i   LASGD AP OA  EOMree y   RPurme  emhc N¥h ewy    AK R  GoAPN  t  SA4h Aedf t  \nthe  robbery,  in  an  unplanned  act,  one  of the  robbers  shot  and  killed  a patron  at the  bar,  Robert \nWalsh.  At that  time,  Mr.  Flores  was  in  a  separate  room  at the  back  of the  bar. \n17.  Nothing  in  Mr.  Flores’s  record  suggests,  nor  was  any  finding  ever  made,  that  his \ncrime  reflected  that  he  was  among  the  “rarest  of puveniie[s]...  whose  crimes  reflects  permanent \nmcorrigibuity”. \nLS.  Mr.  Flores  is  presently  incarcerated  at  Otisville  Correctional  Facility,  mm  Otisville, \nNew  York.  Mr.  Flores  has  an  exceptional  institutional  record  while  in  custody.  His  last \ndisciplinary  offense  was  more  than  25  years  ago  for  disobeying  an  order  to  keep  the  mess  hall \nline  moving. \n19.  He  has  low  scores  across  the  board  in  his  Correctional  Offender  Management \nProfiling  for  Alternative  Sanctions  (C COMPAS”).  In  addition,  his  COMPAS  report  found  that  if \nreleased  he  would  require  the  lowest  level  of supervision.  He  has  earned  outside  clearance  to \nwork  in  the  community,  a  permit  DOCCS  grants  only to  the  most  trustworthy  imates  who  can \nsafely  work  outside  the  prison  with  minimal  supervision. \n20.  Defendants  last  denied  Mr.  Flores  release  on  October  24,  2017,  on  the \nunsubstantiated  basis  that  his  “discretionary  release  at  this  time,  would  not  be  compatible  with \nthe  welfare  of society  and  would  tend  to  deprecate  the  seriousness  of the  Instant  Offense  and \nundermine  respect  for  the  law”. \n21.  Plaintiff Carlos  Flores  brings  this  suit  on  behalf of himself and  a  class  of similarly \nsituated  persons  eligible  for  release  to  parole  supervision  who  were  convicted  of crimes \ncommitted  when  they  were  children  under  the  age  of  18  and  sentenced  to  indeterminate  life \nsentences  with  the  possibility  of parole  im  the  custody  of DOCCS.\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  7  of  44 \n22.  Mr.  Flores  has  been  denied  and  continues  to  be  denied  a meaningful  opportunity \nfor  release  based  on  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation,  and  the  right  to  due  process,  in \nthat  (1)  Commissioners  did  not  fully  consider,  read,  or  attend  to  Mr.  Flores’s  parole  submission; \n(2)  neither  Mr.  Flores  nor  his  attorneys  were  permitted  access  to  letters  opposing  his  release;  (3) \nhe  was  denied  the  right to  have  an  attorney  present  at  his  interview  and  the  right  to  see  and \nconfront  any  evidence  against  him;  (4)  his  denial  is  based  on  a  crime  he  committed  decades  ago \nthat  he  cannot  change;  (5)  Commissioners  did  not  base  their  decision  on  Mr.  Flores’s \ndemonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation;  and  (6)  he  was  denied  any  explanation  for  what \nadditional  steps  he  must take  to  be  recommended  for  parole. \nll.  Plaintiff Lawrence  Bartley \n  \n23.  Plaintiff Lawrence  Bartley  is  45  years  old  and  has  been  incarcerated  since  he  was \n17.  In  December  1990,  Mr.  Bartley was  involved  in  a  gunfight  that  erupted  at  a  local  movie \ntheater.  Twenty  shots  were  exchanged  in  total,  with  only  one  shot  fired  by  Mr.  Bartley.  In  the \nmidst  of the  shooting,  a bystander  was  accidentally  shot  and  killed. \n24.  Mr.  Bartley  received  an  aggregate  sentence  of 27  and  one-third  years  to  life  for \nsecond  degree  murder  and  associated  offenses.  He  has  been  imprisoned  for  27  years  and  1s \npresently  incarcerated  at  Sing  Sing  Correctional  Facility  in  Ossining,  New  York. \n25.  Mr.  Bartley  grew  up  in  a  rough  neighborhood  surrounded  by  drug  dealers  and \ngang  members.  At  only  16,  he  was  shot  four  times  in  a  drive-by  shooting.  He  began  carrying  a \ngun  thereafter  out  of fear  for  his  life. \n26.  Nothing  in  Mr.  Bartley’s  record  suggests,  nor  was  any  finding  ever  made,  that  his \ncrime  reflected  that  he  was  among  the  “rarest  of juvenile[s]  ..  .  whose  crimes  reflects  permanent \nincorrigibility”.\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Oocument  i  Fed  QS/2O/18  Page  8  of  44 \n27.  Mr.  Bartley  has  an  exceptional  institutional  disciplinary  record  while  in  custody. \nHis  last  disciplinary  infraction  was  in  2008,  roughly  ten  years  ago. \n28.  Mr.  Bartley’s  COMPAS  report  found  him  to  be  at  a  low  risk  of reoffending.  Mr. \nBartley  has  recerved  numerous  letters  of support  from  corrections  officers,  including  from  the \nsuperintendent  of Sing  Sing,  noting  that  Mr.  Bartley’s  behavior  “exemplifies  DOCCS’  mission \nof rehabilitating  its  residents  to  positively  re-enter  society”. \n29.  While  incarcerated,  Mr.  Bartley  earned  a  six-month  limited  credit time  allowance \n(“LCTA”)  for  “significant  programmatic  accomplishment”  and  lack  of serious  disciplinary \ninfractions.  The  LCTA  award  made  him  cligible  for  parole  release  six  months  before  the \nexpiration  of his  mimimum  term. \n30.  Defendants  denied  Mr.  Bartley  release  on  September  6,  2017.  He  was  denied \nrelease  despite  ample  evidence  of his  maturation  and  rehabilitation,  including  having  earned  a \nMaster's  degree,  raised  $8,000  for  a  gun  buy-back  program,  publicly  engaged  in  anti-violence \nand  anti-gun  violence  programming  and  secured  employment  upon  release. \n31.  In  its  September  6,  2017  decision,  Defendants  acknowledged  these  achievements, \nwriting:  “The  Panel  applauds  your  exceptional  packet,  institutional  accomplishments,  your \noverall  low  COMPAS  score  and  satisfactory  case  plan.  Your  release  planning,  community \noutreach,  use  of media,  networking  and  vour  life  as  an  example  exemplifies  an  extraordinary \neffort  to  give  back,  demonstrates  restoration  and  evidenced  change.”  The  panel  then  concluded, \nwithout  any  basis,  that,  “there  is  a  reasonable  probability that  you  would  not  live  and  remain  at \nliberty without  again  violating  the  law  and  that  your  release  would  be  incompatible  with  the\nvy \nwelfare  of society  and  would  so  deprecate  the  serious  nature  of the  crane  as  to  undermine  respect \nfor  the  law.” \n32.  Mr.  Bartley  represents  himself and  a  ciass  of similarly  situated  people  eligible  for \nrelease  to  parole  supervision  who  were  convicted  of crimes  committed  when  they  were  children \nunder  the  age  of  18  and  sentenced  to  indeterminate  life  sentences  with  the  possibility  of parole  in \nthe  custody  of DOCCS. \n33.  Mr.  Bartley  has  been  denied  and  continues  to  be  denied  a  meaningful  opportunity \nfor  release,  in  that  (1)  Commussioners  did  not  meaningfully  consider,  read,  or  attend  to  Mr. \nBartley’s  full  parole  submission;  (2)  the  denial  of release  to  parole  supervision  is  based  on  a \ncrime  he  committed  decades  ago  that  he  cannot  change;  (3)  he  was  denied  the  right  to  have  an \nattorney  present  at  his  interview  and  the  right to  see  and  confront  any  evidence  against  him;  (4) \nCommissioners  failed  to  base  their  decision  on  Mr.  Bartley’s  demonstrated  maturity  and \nrehabilitation  since  the  age  of  17;  and  (5)  he  was  denied  any  explanation  for  what  additional \nsteps  he  must take  to  be  recommended  for  parole. \nB.

JUVENILES  HAVE  DIMINISHED  CULPABILITY AND  GREATER  PROSPECTS \nFOR  REFORM  THAN  ADULTS,  AND  THE  STATE  CANNOT,  EXCEPT  IN  THE \nRAREST  OF  CASES,  CONDEMN  JUVENILE  OFFENDERS  TO  DIE  IN  PRISON \nWITHOUT  A  MEANINGFUL  OPPORTUNITY  FOR  RELEASE. \nA.  The  relevant  scientific  communities  have  recognized  that  children  are \ncategorically  different  from  adults. \nA8.  Scientific  and  psychological  studies  confirm  that  children  are  fundamentally \ndifferent  from  adults,  and  as  a result,  their  culpability  is  diminished. \nA9.  The  first  reason  that justifies  the  diminished  culpability  of juvenile  offenders  is \ntheir  lack  of maturity  and  an  underdeveloped  sense  of responsibility.  See Laurence  Steinberg  & \nElizabeth  Scott,  Less  Guilty  by  Reason  of Adolescence:  Developmental  Immaturity  Diminished \nResponsibility  and  the  Juvenile  Death  Penalty,  58  Am.  Psychologist  1009,  1011-14  (2003). \n  \n50.  Their  lack  of maturity  often  results  in  impetuous  and  ill-considered  actions  and \ndecisions  (i.e.,  impulsive  conduct),  which  explains  why  “adolescents  are  overrepresented \nstatistically  in  virtually  every  category  of reckless  behavior”.  Jeffrey Arnett,  Reckless  Behavior \nin Adolescence:  A  Developmental  Perspective,  12  Developmental  Rev.  at  339;  see  also  Laurence \n  \nSteinberg  &  Robert  G.  Schwartz,  Developmental  Psychology  Goes  to  Court  in  Youth  on  Trial:  A \nDevelopmental  Perspective  on  Juvenile  Justice  9  (Thomas  Grisso  &  Robert  Schwartz,  eds., \n  \n2000). \n12\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  13  of  44 \n51.  Developmental  research  shows  that juveniles  engage  in  impulsive  decision- \nmaking  because  they  are  unable  to  perceive  risks.  Melinda  G.  Schmidt  e¢ al.,  Effectiveness  of \nParticipation  as  a Defendant:  The  Attorney-Juvenile  Client  Relationship,  21  Behav.  Sci.  &  L. \n175,  180  (2003).  Another  explanation  for  their  impulsive  behavior  is  that juveniles  think  more \nabout  immediate  gains  as  opposed  to  long-term  consequences,  and  thus  consider  the  meaning  of \na potential  act  differently  than  adults.  Id.;  see  also  Kristin  Henning,  Loyalty,  Paternalism,  and \n  \nRights:  Client  Counseling  Theory  and  the  Role  of Child’s  Counsel  in  Delinquency  Cases,  81 \nNotre  Dame  L.  Rev.  245,  271-72  (2005). \n52.  | Asecond  area  of difference  between  adults  and  adolescents  is  that juveniles  are \nmore  vulnerable  to  negative  influences  and  outside  pressures,  including  peer  pressure.  Steinberg \n&  Scott,  Less  Guilty  by  Reason  of Adolescence,  58  Am.  Psychologist  at  1014. \n  \n53.  Their  susceptibility  to  outside  pressure  is  explained,  at  least  in  part,  by  the \nprevailing  circumstance  that juveniles  have  less  control,  or  less  experience  with  control,  over \ntheir  own  environment.  Id. \n54.  It  is  no  surprise,  therefore,  that  psychologists  have  concluded  that juveniles  “lack \nthe  freedom  that  adults  have  to  extricate  themselves  from  a  criminogenic  setting”.  Id. \n55.  A  third  area  of difference  between  adults  and  adolescents  is  that the  character  of a \njuvenile  is  not  as  well  formed  as  that  of an  adult.  Specifically,  psychologists  and  psychoanalysts \nhave  recognized  that the  personality  traits  of juveniles  are  more  transitory,  less  fixed.  See \ngenerally,  Erik  Erikson,  Identity:  Youth  and  Crisis  (1968);  see  also  Steinberg  &  Scott,  Less \n  \nGuilty  by  Reason  of Adolescence,  58  Am.  Psychologist  at  1014. \n56.  Although  these  three  inherently  transitory  characteristics  of juveniles  often  leads \nthem  to  commit  crimes,  psychologists  have  recognized  that,  for  most teenagers,  their  impulsive \n13\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  14  of  44 \nand  risky  behaviors  “cease  with  maturity”  as  their  identities  become  settled,  they  learn  to \nconsider  long-term  consequences  of potential  actions  prior  to  making  choices,  and they  gain  the \nresources  and  capacities  to  extricate  themselves  from  negative  influences.  Steinberg  &  Scott, \nLess  Guilty  by  Reason  of Adolescence,  58  Am.  Psychologist  at  1014. \n  \n57.  As  adolescents  mature  into  adults,  they  gain  an  improved  perspective  on  long- \nterm  consequences,  become  more  risk  averse  and  gain  the  self-regulatory  capacities  to  conform \ntheir  actions  to  moral  evaluation.  Kristin  Henning,  Loyalty,  Paternalism,  and  Rights:  Client \n  \nCounseling  Theory  and  the  Role  of Child’s  Counsel  in  Delinquency  Cases,  81  Notre  Dame  L. \nRev.  at  272.  They  “also  come  to  regret  decisions  they  made  in  earlier  years”.  Id. \n58.  The  behavior  of adolescents  evolves  so  much  as  they  grow  up  that  studies \nrecognize  that  “[o|nly  a relatively  small  proportion  of adolescents  who  experiment  in  risky  or \nillegal  activities  develop  entrenched  patterns  of problem  behavior  that  persist  into  adulthood”. \nSteinberg  &  Scott,  Less  Guilty  by  Reason  of Adolescence,  58  Am.  Psychologist  at  1014. \n  \nB.  The  law  has  traditionally  viewed  children  differently. \n59.  Courts  and  legislatures  have  long  recognized  that  children  are  not  fully \npsychologically  and  socially  developed,  are  susceptible  to  persuasion  and  abuse,  and  are  marked \nby judgmental  inexperience  such  that  it  is  appropriate  to  limit their  ability  as  a  class  to  vote, \nmarry,  serve  on juries,  drink  alcohol,  gamble,  leave  school  and  otherwise  exercise  full  autonomy \nunder the  law.  See  J.D.B.  v.  North  Carolina,  564  U.S.  261,  272-77  (2011). \n  \n60.  The  inherent  characteristics  of children  have  been  recognized  in  the  area  of \npunishment  in  a  series  of U.S.  Supreme  Court  decisions.  Specifically,  the  Supreme  Court \nrecognized  that three  distinctive  attributes  of juveniles  mitigate  their  culpability:  juveniles  have \ntransient  immaturity;  they  are  vulnerable  to  external  forces;  and  their  character traits  are  still \n14\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  15  of  44 \nbeing  formed.  Montgomery,  136  S.  Ct.  at  733;  Miller,  132  S.  Ct.  at  2646;  Graham,  560  U.S.  at \n68;  Roper v.  Simmons,  543  U.S.  551,  569-70  (2005). \n  \n61.  By  recognizing  the  psychological  and  social  characteristics  of children,  these \ndecisions  established  constitutional  limitations  on  the  punishment that  can  be  imposed  on \nchildren,  even  for  very  serious  crimes,  reasoning  that  “children  are  constitutionally  different \nfrom  adults  for  purposes  of sentencing”  because  they  have  “diminished  culpability  and  greater \nprospects  for  reform”.  Montgomery,  136  S.  Ct.  at  733  (quoting  Miller,  132  S.  Ct.  at  2464  (citing \nRoper,  543  U.S.  at  569-70;  Graham,  560  U.S.  at  68)). \n62.  In  Roper  v.  Simmons,  543  U.S.  551,  572  (2005),  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court \n  \ncategorically  outlawed  the  death  penalty  for juvenile  offenders,  even  those  convicted  of the  most \nheinous  murders,  concluding  that  “neither  retribution  nor  deterrence  provides  adequate \njustification  for  imposing  the  death  penalty  on juvenile  offenders”. \n63.  In  Graham  v.  Florida,  560  U.S.  48  (2010),  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  held  that \nsentencing  a juvenile  to  life  in  prison  without  parole  for  crimes  other than  murder violates  the \nEighth  Amendment’s  ban  on  cruel  and  usual  punishment,  specifically  for  non-homicide  offenses. \n64.  In  Miller v.  Alabama,  132  S.  Ct.  2455  (2012),  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  held  that \nthe  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  a  sentencing  scheme  that  requires  life  in  prison  without the \npossibility  of parole  for juvenile  homicide  offenders. \n65.  In  Montgomery  v.  Louisiana,  136  S.  Ct.  718  (2016),  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  held \n  \nthat  Miller  v.  Alabama  announced  a  substantive  rule  which,  under  the  Constitution,  is  retroactive \nin  cases  on  state  collateral  review. \n66.  In  United  States  v.  Reingold,  731  F.3d  204  (2d  Cir.  2013),  the  Second  Circuit \n  \nreiterated  the  categorical  prohibition  of mandatory  life  sentences  without  parole  for juveniles. \n15\n  \nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  16  of  44 \n67.  Together,  these  decisions  announce  substantive  constitutional  principles  of \nproportionality  governing  punishment  for juvenile  offenders  based  on  their  diminished \nculpability  and  enhanced  capacity  for  reform.  A  clear  implication  of those  principles  is  that the \nEighth  Amendment  forbids  a  statutory  scheme  that  (1)  imposes  life  sentences  upon  minors \nwithout  appropriate  consideration  of their  distinctive  attributes  as juveniles,  and  then  (11)  fails  to \nprovide  them  with  a  meaningful  and  realistic  opportunity  for  release.  New  York  law  fails  this \ntest  on  both  accounts. \nC.  Life  sentences  imposed  on  children  are  unconstitutional  absent  a  parole \nscheme  that  provides  a  meaningful  and  realistic  opportunity  to  obtain  release \nbased  on  demonstrated  rehabilitation  and  reform. \n68.  “The  Eighth  Amendment’s  prohibition  of cruel  and  unusual  punishment \nguarantees  individuals  the  right  not to  be  subjected  to  excessive  sanctions.  That  right  ...  flows \nfrom  the  basic  precept  of justice  that  punishment  for  crime  should  be  graduated  and  proportioned \nto  both  the  offender  and  the  offense.”  Miller,  132  S.  Ct.  at  2463  (internal  quotation  marks  and \ncitations  omitted). \n69.  Accordingly,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  “sentencing  a  child  to  life \nwithout  parole  is  [unconstitutionally]  excessive  for  all  but the  ‘rare juvenile  offender whose \ncrime  reflects  irreparable  corruption’”9.99   Montgomery,  136  S.  Ct.  at  734  (quoting  Miller,  132  S. \nCt.  at  2469).  States  “must  impose  a  sentence  that  provides  some  meaningful  opportunity  for \nrelease  based  on  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation”.  Graham,  560  U.S.  at  50. \n70.  That  holding  has  both  “substantive”  and  “procedural  component|s]”. \nMontgomery,  136  S.  Ct.  at  734-35.  Because  of its  substantive  nature,  the  Supreme  Court  has \nheld  that this  constitutional  rule  applies  retroactively.  Id. \n71.  As  amatter  of “substantive  right’,  it  is  unconstitutional  to  imprison  for  life \nwithout  parole  a juvenile  “whose  crimes  reflect  unfortunate  yet  transient  immaturity”  rather  than \n16\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  17  of  44 \n“irreparable  corruption”.  Miller,  132  S.  Ct.  at  2469.  In  furtherance  of this  substantive  right,  the \nSupreme  Court  has  recognized that  a juvenile’s  “demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation”  is \nwhat  entitles  him  to  a  “meaningful  opportunity  to  obtain  release”. Id.  (citing  Graham,  560  U.S. \nat  75). \n72.  Asa“procedural”  matter,  “a  sentencer  [must]  consider  a juvenile  offender’s  youth \nand  attendant  characteristics  before  determining  that  life  without  parole”  is  “proportionate”  to  the \noffense.  Montgomery,  136  S.  Ct.  at  734.  The  sentencer  does  not  have  unfettered  discretion  to \ntreat  youth  as  a mere  “factor”  and  assign  said  factor  the  weight  it  chooses.  Rather,  youth  is  a \nconstitutionally  relevant  status  that  makes  certain  forms  of punishment  unlawful  and  that triggers \nthe  substantive  guarantee  that  a juvenile  not  be  imprisoned  for  life  for  a  crime  that  reflects \ntransient  characteristics  of youth  because  to  do  so  would  be  to  impose  a  disproportionate \npunishment. \n73.  Accordingly,  the  sentencer  must  “d[o]  more  than  [merely]  consider  a juvenile \noffender’s  youth  before  imposing  life  without  parole”,  id.  at  734,  and  must  instead  analyze \nwhether  the  crime  reflects  transient  factors  of youth  or  permanent  incorrigibility.  Id. \n74.  Proceedings  bearing  on  life  sentences  for juvenile  offenders  must,  in  order  to \navoid  being  categorically  unconstitutional,  afford juvenile  lifers  who  have  evolved  from  a \ntroubled,  misguided  youth  to  a model  inmate,  a  meaningful  opportunity to  demonstrate  that \nchildren  who  commit  even  heinous  crimes  are  capable  of change.  Id.  at  724. \n75.  Accordingly,  sentencing  regimes  that  subject juvenile  offenders  to  life  with  the \npossibility  of parole  are  only  constitutional  insofar  as  the  state  provides  a  “meaningful \nopportunity  to  obtain  release  based  on  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation”.  Miller,  132 \nS.  Ct.  at  2469  (quoting  Graham,  560  U.S.  at  75). \n17\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  18  of  44 \n76.  Those  substantive  and  procedural  rights  apply  at  parole  hearings  where  a  person \nwho  committed  a  crime  as  a  child  faces  possible  life  imprisonment  if parole  is  denied.  After  all, \n[a]  parole  board  is  no  more  entitled  to  subject  an  offender to  the  penalty  of life  in  prison  in \ncontravention  of this  rule  than  is  a  legislature  or  a  sentencing  court”.  Hawkins  v.  N.Y.  State \n  \nDep’t  of Corr.,  140  A.D.3d  34,  38  (3d  Dep’t  2016);  Putland  v.  New  York  State  Dep’t  of Corr., \n  \n158  A.D.3d  633  (2d  Dep’t  2018). \n77.  The  U.S.  Supreme  Court  allows  life  with  parole  sentences  only  because  it \nunderstands  parole  to  be  “a regular  part  of the  rehabilitative  process.  Assuming  good  behavior, \n[parole]  is  the  normal  expectation  in  the  vast  majority  of cases.”  Solem  v.  Helm,  463  U.S.  277, \n300-01  (1983)  (citations  omitted). \nIl.  NEW  YORK  SUBJECTS  JUVENILE  LIFERS  TO  UNCONSTITUTIONALLY \nDISPROPORTIONATE  PUNISHMENT  BY  DENYING  THEM  A  MEANINGFUL \nAND  REALISTIC  OPPORTUNITY  FOR  RELEASE  BASED  ON  DEMONSTRATED \nMATURITY  AND  REHABILITATION. \nA.  New  York  sentencing  law  mandates  life  with  the  possibility  of parole  for \njuvenile  offenders  as  young  as  13. \n78.  Under New  York  sentencing  law,  children  aged  16  and  17  are  sentenced to  an \nindeterminate  sentence  with  a mandatory  maximum  term  of life  imprisonment  if convicted  of a \nclass  A  felony,  with  the  minimum  term  for  a  class  A-I  felony  ranging  from  15  to  25  years.  N.Y. \nPenal  Law  §§  70.00(2)(a),  70.00(3)(a)(1)..  Children  as  young  as  13  years  old  who  are  convicted \nof murder  receive  an  automatic  maximum  sentence  of life  in  prison  with  opportunity  for  parole. \nN.Y.  CPL  88  1.20(42),  180;  N.Y.  Penal  Law  §  70.05(2)(a). \n79.  Under  the  New  York  Penal  Law,  a  defendant’s  age  and  maturity,  the  transient \ncharacteristics  attendant to  youth,  and  a  defendant’s  capacity  for  rehabilitation  play  no  role \nwhatsoever  in  setting  the  maximum  sentence  for  those  convicted  of murder  or  other  class  A-I \nfelonies  for  which  the  mandatory  maximum  sentence  is  Jife. \n18\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  19  of  44 \n80.  The  only  mechanism,  under New  York  law,  by  which  the  substantive  right  of \njuvenile  lifers  to  be  provided  with  a meaningful  opportunity  for  release  can  be  secured  is  through \nthe  Board  of Parole. \nB.  New  York  parole  law  fails  to  afford  juvenile  lifers  a  meaningful  and  realistic \nopportunity  for  release  upon  rehabilitation. \n81.  The  New  York  parole  practices  and  procedures  fail  to  provide juvenile  lifers  a \n“meaningful”  or  “realistic”  opportunity  to  obtain  release  based  on  demonstrated  maturity  and \nrehabilitation. \n82.  The  Board  of Parole  has  interpreted  the  New  York  Executive  Law  to  allow  it to \ndeny  parole  to juvenile  lifers  if Defendants,  in  their  subjective judgment,  without  regard to  the \nindividual’s  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation  subsequent to  the  crime,  believes  that \nrelease  would  be  “not  compatible  with  the  welfare  of society”  or  would  “so  deprecate  the \nseriousness  of his  crime  as  to  undermine  respect  for  law”.  See N.Y.  Exec.  Law  §  259-i(2)(c)(A). \n83.  Defendant  Stanford  told  the  Senate  Crime  Victims,  Crime  and  Correction \nCommittee  on  February  15,  2018,  that  she  understands  the  statutory  language  “deprecate  the \nseriousness  of the  offense  as  to  undermine  respect  for the  law”  to  permit  Commissioners  to  deny \nparole  if they,  in  their  personal  opinion,  believe  that  release  for  particular  offenders  who \ncommitted  serious  crimes  “would  so  undermine  respect  for  the  law  in  the  mind  of the  community \n[the  offenders]  would  be  going  back to”.  Defendant  Stanford  termed  this  consideration  as \n“community  opposition”  although  it  is  not  statutorily  authorized  under New  York’s  Executive \nLaw. \n84.  As  aresult,  Defendants  continue  to  deny juvenile  lifers  release  to  parole \nsupervision  based  only  on  the  crime  committed  or juvenile  criminal  history,  despite  clear \nevidence  of rehabilitation  and  maturity. \n19\n85.  Defendants’  failures  are  illustrated  in  their  treatment  of the  Named  Plaintiffs. \n&>.  For  example,  Defendants  have  denied  parole  ten  times  to  Plaintulf Carlos  Flores, \nwho  has  been  incarcerated  for  37  years,  has  a  “low  risk  across  the  board”  COMPAS  risk \nassessment  and  has  not  had  a  disciplinary  ticket  in  25  years.  Despite  his  impeccable  record,  on \nOctober  24,  2017,  Defendants  South,  Crangie  and  Demosthenes  denied  Mr.  Flores  release  to \nparole  supervision  stating,  without  substantiation,  that  “discretionary  release  is  not  warranted  due \nto  concern  for  the  public  safety  and  welfare”  and  that  “release  at  this  time  would  not  be \ncompatible  with  the  welfare  of society  and  would  tend  to  deprecate  the  seriousness  of the  Instant \nOffense  and  undermine  respect  for  the  law”.  The  only  treatment  in  Defendants’  decision  given \nto  Mr.  Flores’s juvenile  status  at  the  time  of the  offense  1s  relegated  to  the  following  conclusory, \npassive  voice  statement that:  “|yjlour  age  at  the  tune  of the  offense,  family  situation  and  lack  of \nmaturity  is  noted.” \n&7.  Defendants  also  denied  parole  release  to  Plaintiff Lawrence  Bartley  at  his  Limited \nTime  Credit  Allowance  interview,  which  he  earned  for  “significant  programmatic \naccomplishment’  and  an  excellent  disciplinary  record.  Defendants  Cruse  and  Drake \nacknowledged  Mr.  Bartley’s  “exceptional  packet,  mstitutional  accomplishments  ...  overall  low \nCOMPAS  score  and  satisfactory  case  plan...  release  planning,  community  outreach,  use  of \nmedia,  networking  and  your  life  as  an  example  exemplifies  an  extraordinary  effort  to  give  back, \nisicf  demonstrates  restoration  and  evidenced  change”.  On  September  6,  2017,  they  nevertheless \nconcluded,  without  any  basis,  that  “there  is  a  reasonable  probability that you  would  not  live  and \nremain  at  liberty  without  agai  violating  the  law  and  that  your  release  would  be  incompatible \nwith  the  welfare  of society  and  would  so  deprecate  the  serious  nature  of the  crime  as  to \nundermine  respect  for  the  law”.  Defendants  Cruse  and  Drake  also  cited  opposition  to\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  21  of  44 \nMr.  Bartley’s  release.  Their  decision,  however,  fails  to  even  mention  that  Mr.  Bartley  was  a \njuvenile  at the  time  of the  offense  or  consider  the  hallmark  features  of youth  as  they  relate  to \nculpability  or the  constitutional  relevance  of the  exceptional  evidence  of maturity  and \nrehabilitation. \n88.  As  evidenced  by their  denial  of Mr.  Flores  and  Mr.  Bartley,  Defendants  continue \nto  deny juvenile  lifers  release  to  parole  supervision  even  after  they  have  demonstrated  maturity \nand  rehabilitation. \n89.  Defendants’  reliance  on  the  nature  of a juvenile  crime,  prior juvenile  record, \njuvenile  disciplinary  history,  and  “official”,  “community”  or  victim  opposition,  to  deny  release \ndeprives juvenile  lifers  of the  opportunity to  obtain  release  based  on  demonstrated  maturity  and \nrehabilitation.  This  opportunity  is  required  to  bring  life  with  parole  sentencing  regimes  into \ncompliance  with  the  Eighth  Amendment’s  proscription  against  disproportionate  punishment. \nC.  The  Board  of Parole  willfully  violates  the  rights  of juvenile  lifers. \n90.  In  2016,  the  Third  Department  of New  York  State  Supreme  Court,  Appellate \nDivision  found  the  Board  of Parole  in  violation  of clearly  established  law  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment  because,  “[t]he  Board,  as  the  entity  charged  with  determining  whether  [Hawkins] \nwill  serve  a  life  sentence,  was  required  to  consider  the  significance  of [Hawkins’]  youth  and  its \nattendant  circumstances  at the  time  of the  commission  of the  crime  before  making  a parole \ndetermination.”  Hawkins,  140  A.D.3d  34,  36  (3d  Dep’t  2016). \n91.  In  response  to  the  Hawkins  decision  and  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  decision  in \nMontgomery,  the  Board  gave  notice  of proposed  regulations  that  reflected  Defendants’  official \nposition  regarding  their  legal  obligations  under  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  the  Due  Process \nClause.  Department  of Corrections  and  Community  Supervision,  Proposed  Rulemaking, \nID.  No.  CCS-39-16-00004-P  (Sept.  28,  2016). \n21\nCase  f:1S-cv-02468-VB  Documentil  Filed  03/20/18  Page  22  of  44 \n92.  Numerous  comments  pointed  out  to  the  Board  that  the  proposed  regulations  were \nfacially  inadequate  to  ensure  that the  hundreds  of juvenile  lifers  currently  incarcerated  in New \nYork  DOCCS  custody  receive  a meaningful  opportunity  for  release. \n93.  Despite  these  objections,  the  Board  formally  adopted  these  regulations  on \nSeptember  17,  2017  without  curing  the  constitutional  defects  in  the  regulations.  The  regulations \nprovide  that  an  inmate’s puvenile  status  at  the  time  of the  crime  for which  he  or  she  1s  currently \nserving  an  indeterminate  life  sentence  is  merely  one  of many  factors  that  Board  must  “consider” \nONYCRE  8002.2,  and  contmue  to  permit  Defendants  to  deny  parole  based  solely  on  their \nsubjective  assessinent  of the  crume  of conviction. \nO4.,  Subsequent  to  the  adoption  of the  new  regulations,  and  demonstrating  their \ninadequacy,  Plaimtuf Carlos  Flores  was  again  denied  parole  based  solely  on  the  nature  of his \ncrune  and  without  a  meaningful  opportunity  for  release  based  on  demonstrated  maturity  and \nrehabilitation.  Defendants  Smith,  Crangle  and  Demosthenes  failed  to  give  any  weight  to  the \nampie  evidence  of Mr.  Flores’s  rehabilitation  and  maturation.  They  ignored  the  Board’s  own \nCOMPAS  imstrument  finding  Mr.  Flores  to  be  low  risk  for  reoffending;  they  ignored  the  fact \nthat  he  has  not  had  a  disciplinary  ticket  in  the  past  25  years;  they  ignored  the  fact  that  he  is  now \na  54-year-old  man  who  has  served  16  years  beyond  the  minimum  term  of imprisonment  imposed \nby  the  sentencing judge  in  full  light  of the  facts  of the  crime.  Instead,  Defendants  Smith,  Crangle \nand  Demosthenes  denied  Mr.  Flores  release  on  the  unsubstantiated  formulaic  “conclusion”  that \nhis  “discretionary  release  at this  time,  would  not  be  compatible  with  the  welfare  of society  and \nwould  tend  to  deprecate  the  seriousness  of the  instant  offense  and  undermine  respect  for  the \nlaw’,\nCm~ ase  a7py: i8-cv-P0eo 24A 58- -VBaa   D~ ocumenms t«   ia   Fyani le= d  0ey3e /20/1ia 8  ePt anC e ~  23  of  4a 4 \nOS.  Chis  decision  was  anpealed  administratively  on  December  15,  2017,  with  a \ns  2 \nlengthy  submission  by  counsel  for  Mr.  Flores  explaining,  vet  again,  the  constitutional  standard \nthat  the  Board  must  follow  when  considering  the  applications  for  parole  by juvenile  lifters. \n96.  On  March  6,  2018,  the  Board  decided  the  admimistrative  appeal.  The  Parole \nBoard  Appeals  Unit,  including  Defendant  Chairwoman  Stanford,  ordered  a  de  novo  interview  on \nthe  basis  that  the  Board  did  not  explam  what  “course  of conduct,  before,  during,  and  after”  the \ncrime  36  years  ago  it  found  concerning.  Notably,  it  refused  to  instruct  Commissioners  that  the \nEighth  Amendment  requires  Defendants  to  release  Mr.  Flores  to  parole  supervision  tf he  has \ndemonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation  and  instead  affirmed  the  unlawful  standard  under  which \nit  had  denied  Mr.  Flores’s  release  stating,  in  part,  that  “the  applicable  principles  and  factors  were \ndiscussed  and  considered  by  the  Board  in  reaching  its  determination”. \n97,  Defendants  showed  similar  disregard  for  its  obligations  under  applicable \nconstitutional  law  in  deciding  the  administrative  appeal  of Mr.  Bartley’s  September  6,  2017 \ndental.  On  November  7,  2017,  counsel  submitted  a  lengthy  brief perfecting  the  appeal \nidentifying  the  mumerous  substantive  and  procedural  defects  in the  Board’s  consideration  thal \ndenied  Mr.  Bartley  a meaningful  opportunity  for  release,  including  the  Board’s  failure  to  render \nits  decision  based  on  Mr.  Bartley’s  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation.  In  February  2018, \nthe  Appeals  Unit,  including  Defendant  Chairwoman  Stanford,  ordered  a  new  hearing  on  the  sole \nbasis  that  Defendants  failed  to  seek  the  recommendation  of his  trial  attorney  in  advance  of the \ninterview  in  violation  of N.Y.  Exec.  Law  §  259-12 )(cKA)Ovii).  The  Appeais  Unit  refused  to \nissue  any  findings  of facts  or  law  that  would  prevent  the  same  defects  from  infecting  his  future \ninterview  and the  panei’s  deliberation  process. \n tboat\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  24  of  44 \n98.  Since  Hawkins,  a  number  of New  York  State  courts  have  found  Defendants  in \nviolation  of their  legal  obligation  to  provide  persons  serving  indeterminate  life  sentences  with  a \nmeaningful  opportunity  for  release.  See,  e.g.,  Martin  v.  Stanford,  58  Misc.  3d  345  (Sup.  Ct., \nCayuga  County  2017);  Darshan  v.  N.Y.  State  Dep’t  of Corrs.  &  Comm.  Super.,  No.  652/2017 \n(Sup.  Ct.,  Dutchess  County  July  18,  2017);  Putland  v.  New  York  State  Dep’t  of Corr.,  158 \n  \nA.D.3d  633  (2d  Dep’t  2018). \n99.  Defendants  continue  to  conduct  unlawful  hearings  and  refuse  to  extend  requisite \nprocedural  protections  necessary  to  secure  Plaintiffs’  and  Class  Members’  substantive  rights. \nD.  The  Board  of Parole’s  procedures  violate  the  law. \n100.  The  sheer  volume  of work  before  Defendants  precludes  the  opportunity  for  Class \nMembers  to  be  meaningfully  heard  and  to  receive  decisions  rendered  based  on  demonstrated \nmaturity  and  rehabilitation. \n101.  Although  the  State  is  authorized  to  staff the  Board  of Parole  with  19  members,  it \nis  currently  staffed  by  14  Commissioners.  These  14  Commissioners  must  conduct  approximately \n12,000  parole  interviews  annually,  in  addition  to  sitting  on  appeals  panels,  staffing \nsubcommittees,  conducting  victim  impact  interviews,  traveling  for  interviews,  and  engaging  in \nadministrative  upkeep. \n102.  Interview  panels  consist  of two  to  three  Commissioners.  Each  panel  is  assigned \neach week  somewhere  between  40  to  70  interviews,  which  are  usually  conducted  over  only  two \ndays—Tuesday  and  Wednesday—as  Mondays  are  reserved  for  travel  and  Fridays  for victim \ninterviews.  The  majority  of interviews  are  conducted  by  video  conference.  This  means  each \npanel  interviews  between  20  and  35  applicants  a  day. \n24\n103.  Each  of these  applicants  typically  submits  supporting  materials  (a  “parole \npacket”),  including  a personal  statement,  programmatic  achievements,  and  letters  of support,  that \ncan  include  hundreds  of pages  of material. \n104.  Defendant  Stanford  has  testified  that  these  parole  files  and  packets  are  sometimes \ndelivered  by  prison  staff and  Offender  Rehabilitation  Counselors  (ORCs)  to  the  field  office \nwhere  the  video  conferences  take  place  on  Monday,  the  day  before  the  interviews.  She  has  also \ntestified  that  Defendants  often  do  not  receive  the  parole  files  and  packets  prior  to  the  morning  of \nthe  interviews. \n105.  Defendant  Stanford  has  testified  that  Commissioners  typically  arrive  in  the  city  or \ntown  where  the  video  conferencing  of the  interviews  will  take  place  on  Monday  the  day  or \nevening  before  the  interviews,  which  begin  at  8  a.m.  the  following  morning. \n106.  Once  Commissioners  arrive  m  a  city  on  Monday,  they  check  into  assigned  hotels \nand,  according  to  Chairwoman  Stanford,  they  may  then  review  parole  files,  if such  have  been \ndelivered,  “at their  leisure’  in  their  hotel  rooms. \nL107.  No  regulation  or  policy  requires  Defendants  to  read  parole  materials  before \nconducting  an  interview  and  making  release  decisions,  and  according  to  Defendant  Stanford, \n“not  everyone  does  it”. \n108.  On  information  and  belief,  Defendants  often  sce  the  files  for  the  first  time  at \n&  aim.  on  the  day  of the  interviews. \n[09.  The  Board  divides  the  weekly  interview  caseload  by  the  total  seated \nCommissioners  to  assign  a  “lead”  Commissioner  to  each  case.  During  the  interviews,  only  the \nn\n hbU\nlead  Commissioner  has  a  copy  of the  entire  parole  file.  The  full  file  may  contain  hundreds  of \npages  of material  documenting  rehabilitation  and  reform,  including: \ne  personal  statements  composed  by  the  parole  applicant; \ne  detailed  release  plans; \n®  vocational  accomplishments; \n®  programming  completion; \n®  educational  achievements: \n®  educational  transcripts; \n®  letters  from  family  members  showing  support; \n®  letters  from  those  who  have  had  personal  contact  with  the  applicant \nsupporting  release  and  describing  the  reasons  why  they  feel  the  applicant  is \nsafe  to  release; \n®  job  offers; \n®  drug  and  alcohol  treatment  completion  certificates; \n®  commendable  behavior  reports: \n®  prison  work  assignment  assessments:  and \n®  statements  of remorse  or  essays  written  by the  applicant  discussing  insight \ninto  his  or  her  crime. \nLiG.  Defendant  Stanford  has  testified  that the  one  or  two  Commissioners  other  than  the \nlead  Commiussioner  have  only  what  is  called  a  “book  copy”,  which  includes  only  four  things:  a \ncondensed  version  of the  Parole  Board  Report  (a  one  page  sheet  consisting  primarily  of \ncheckboxes  with  basic  information  such  as  birth  date,  crimes  of commitment,  whether  there  are \nsentencing  minutes  or  not,  etc.},  the  COMPAS  report,  a modified  rap  sheet  and  the  immiate’s \ndisciplinary  record. \nLii.  Defendant  Stanford  has  testified  that the  “book  copy”  contains  all  of the \ninformation  necessary  to  the  decision  and that  all  other  information  is  “less  pertinent”. \nab\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  27  of  44 \n112.  The  “book  copy”  does  not  include  letters  of support,  personal  statements, \ncommendable  behavior  reports  or  any  of the  most  relevant  and  detailed  materials  that would \ndemonstrate  rehabilitation,  remorse,  reform  and  suitability  for  community  reentry. \n113.  The  lead  Commissioner  typically  asks  all  of the  questions  in  the  interview. \n114.  Although  Defendant  Stanford  testified  that  interviews  typically  last  20  minutes, \non  information  and  belief,  inmates  often  have  less  than  10  minutes  to  make  their  case  for  release \nbecause  the  bulk  of the  “interview”  consists  of the  lead  Commissioner  recounting  the  details  of \nthe  crime;  longer  interviews  are  usually  provided  only  where  the  applicant  is  represented  by \ncounsel  or  if the  prior  determination  was  overturned  by  a  reviewing  court. \n115.  On  information  and  belief,  during  the  interview  the  other  Commissioners  are \noften  not  listening  to  the  questions  and  answers  during  the  pending  interview,  but  instead  are \npreparing  for  the  subsequent  hearings  on  which  they  must take  the  “lead”. \n116.  Despite  this  lack  of materials  and  information  or  direct  engagement  from  the  non- \nlead  Commissioners  in  a  given  interview,  each  Commissioner  on  the  panel  has  an  equal  vote  to \ngrant  or  deny  release. \n117.  On  information  and  belief,  outcomes  are  often  predetermined  prior  to  the \ninterview  and  sometimes  decision  language  is  pre-written  on  a typed  form  denial.  This  is  a  clear \nviolation  of the  “guarantee  against  arbitrary  and  irrational  government  action”,  which  includes \nthe  “right to  a hearing  before  a  fact-finder  that  has  not  predetermined  the  outcome  of the \nhearing”.  Duffy v.  Evans,  No.  11  Civ.  7605  JMF,  2012  WL  4327605,  at  *10  (S.D.N.Y.  Sept.  19, \n2012). \n27\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  28  of  44 \n118.  Ifnot,  the  “deliberations”  typically  last  between  2  to  5  minutes  immediately \nfollowing  the  interview  and  prior  to  commencing  the  next  interview.  The  final  decision  is  then \nread  into  the  record  and  transcribed  by  stenographer. \n119.  On  any  given  hearing  day,  a  Board  of Parole  panel  will  potentially  conduct  20  to \n35  interviews  in  less  than  eight  hours.  Defendants,  therefore,  lack the  time  or  inclination to  read \nand  evaluate  the  materials  presented  to  them  in  the  information  packets,  and  routinely  show  up \nunprepared  for  the  parole  interviews  (as  occurred  in  Mr.  Flores’s  2015  and  2017  interviews). \n120.  These  procedural  inadequacies  are  exacerbated  because  the  Board  does  not  permit \ncounsel  to  appear  or  give  statements  at  parole  interviews. \n1.  Commissioners  have  no  training  on  which  to  base  their  decisions  and  do \nn ot  solicit  expert  evaluations  of the  m aturation  and  rehabilitation  of \n juvenile  lifers.   \n121.  On  information  and  belief,  twelve  of the  fourteen  Defendants  have  no  substantial \ntraining  in  any  discipline—such  as  child  psychology,  criminology  or  social  work—that would \nenable  them  to  competently  evaluate  whether  an  underlying  crime  reflected  the  transient \nimmaturity  or  youth  or  instead  permanent  incorrigibility. \n122.  Commissioners  do  not  seek  input  from  experts  competent to  attest to  the  extent  of \nmaturation  and  rehabilitation  of juvenile  lifers  eligible  for  parole  release. \n123.  The  Board  does  not  make  available  funds  for  inmates  to  retain  their  own \nexperts—such  as  psychiatrists,  psychologists,  social  workers  or  criminologists—who  could \nopine  about whether  the  underlying  crime  reflected  transient  immaturity  or  permanent \nincorrigibility  and  whether  the  inmate  has  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation. \n124.  The  prevalence  of mental  impairments  among juvenile  offenders  is  substantially \nhigher  than  adolescents  who  are  not  involved  with  the justice  system.  See  generally,  Lee \nUnderwood  &  Aryssa Washington,  Mental  IlIness  and  Juvenile  Offenders,  13  Int.  J.  Environ. \n28\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  29  of  44 \nRes.&  Pub.  Health  228  (2016).  Lack  of access  to  psychological  experts  significantly  raises  the \nrisk that  a  person  serving  a  life  sentence  for  crimes  committed  as  a juvenile  is  denied  parole \nbased  on  undiagnosed  psychiatric  or  cogitative  impairments,  which  are  often  untreated  in  prison. \nSee id. \nUl.  Commissioners  improperly  uses  risk  assessment  tools. \n  \n125.  Due  process  requires,  at  a minimum,  that  parole  release  decisions  be  made  based \non  accurate  information.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Romano,  825  F.2d  725,  728  (2d  Cir.  1987) \n  \n(citing  Townsend  v.  Burke,  334  U.S.  736,  741  (1948)). \n  \n126.  The  Board  relies  upon  a risk  and  needs  tool,  called  COMPAS,  that  does  not \nspecifically  consider  the  diminished  culpability  of juveniles  and  the  hallmark  features  of youth. \n127.  On  information  and  belief,  COMPAS  fails  to  incorporate juvenile  rehabilitative \ncapacities  into  its  algorithm. \n128.  On  information  and  belief,  COMPAS  sometimes  treats  youth  as  an  aggravating \nfactor.  For  example,  it  counts  as  negative  not  having  a job  prior  to  incarceration,  not  being \nmarried,  the  age  of first  offense,  includes juvenile justice  encounters  at very  young  ages  in  the \ncriminal  involvement  score,  and  uses  current  age  to  predict  risk  of felony violence.  Defendants’ \nuse  of COMPAS  thereby  disadvantages  Class  Members  who  were  sentenced  as juveniles  to \nserve  longer  sentences  than  their  adult  counterparts. \n129.  COMPAS  is  a  commercial  product,  sold  by Northpointe  Inc.  On  information  and \nbelief,  the  Board  has  either  not  asked Northpointe  Inc.  to  disclose  its  secret  algorithms  or  has \nacquiesced  in  the  refusal  by Northpointe  Inc.  to  do  so.  As  a  result,  COMPAS  is  a black  box. \nDefendants’  reliance  upon  COMPAS,  without  knowing  how  or  whether  COMPAS  considers  the \ndiminished  culpability  of juveniles  and  the  hallmark  features  of youth,  fails  to  comply  with \nDefendants’  legal  obligations. \n29\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  30  of  44 \n130.  Defendants  have  also  refused  to  verify whether  the  COMPAS  tool  has  been \nvalidated  for juvenile  lifers. \niil.  Commissioners  use  prior  youthful  criminal  involvement  or  disciplinary \ntickets  received  as  a  juvenile  as  reasons  for  denying  parole  to  juvenile \nlifers. \n131.  On  information  and  belief,  Defendants  have  access  to  and  cite  to  previous \ninvolvement  in  the juvenile justice  system  and  inmates’  disciplinary  records  from  their  time  in \nOffice  of Children  and  Family  Services  (OCSF)  facilities  as  evidence  that  applicants  are \nunsuitable  for  release. \n132.  For  example,  in  the  middle  of Mr.  Bartley’s  September  6,  2017  parole  hearing, \nDefendant  Cruse  indicated  that  he  would  consider  Mr.  Bartley’s  disciplinary  tickets  in  reaching  a \nrelease  decision,  and the  subsequent  denial  decision  cited  to  Mr.  Bartley’s  prior  youthful \ncriminal  conviction  as  one  of the  reasons  for  denying  his  release. \n133.  Defendants  fail  to  account  for  youth  when  considering  the  institutional \ndisciplinary  records  of juvenile  lifers  imprisoned  when  they  were  still  adolescents  and  not  as  able \nas  adults  to  control  impulses,  plan  alternative  courses  of action,  and  otherwise  moderate  their \nbehavior. \n134.  On  information  and  belief,  Defendants  have  access  to  and  cite  to  disciplinary \ntickets  issued  to juvenile  lifers  when  they  were  still juveniles  being  held  at  OCSF  as  the  basis  to \ndeny  parole,  without  considering  the  hallmark  features  of youth  or  undiagnosed  or  untreated \nintellectual  disabilities,  learning  disabilities,  attention  deficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  autism \nspectrum  disorder,  and  mental  disorders  such  as  post-traumatic-stress  disorder,  emotional \ndisturbances  or  childhood  depression,  all  of which  are  exacerbated  in  incarcerated  youth. \n135.  All  policies,  customs,  and  practices  associated  with  denying juvenile  lifers  a \nmeaningful  and  realistic  opportunity  for  parole  release  reflect the  official  policy  of the  Board  of \n30\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  31  of  44 \nParole  made  or  acquiesced  to  by  each  Defendant.  Defendants’  actions  involved  reckless  or \ncallous  indifference  to  the  rights  of Plaintiffs  and  similarly  situated  persons  serving  life  sentences \nfor  crimes  committed  as  minors. \nCLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n136.  Named  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  on  behalf of a  class  consisting  of all  persons \neligible  for  release  to  parole  supervision  who  were  convicted  of crimes  committed  when  they \nwere  children  under  the  age  of  18  and  sentenced  to  indeterminate  life  sentences  with the \npossibility  of parole  in  the  custody  of the  DOCCS. \n137.  This  action  meets  the  requirements  of Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a)  as  follows: \ni.  The  proposed  class  is  so  numerous  that joinder  of all  of its  members  is \nimpracticable.  In New  York,  there  are  approximately  630  persons  currently \nserving  life  sentences  for  offenses  they  committed  between  the  ages  of  13 \nand  17.  (DOCCS  Statistics  on  Under  Custody  Population  as  of Jan.  16,  2016, \nat  1.)  Those  people  are  now,  or will  be  in  the  future,  eligible  for  release  to \nparole  supervision.  While  the  exact  size  of the  proposed  class  may  not  be \nknown  at this  time,  there  can  be  no  doubt that  a  class  action  is  appropriate  to \naddress  the  systemic  issues  presented  in  this  case.  In  addition, joinder  of all \nmembers  of the  proposed  class  is  impracticable  because  membership  of the \nproposed  class  constantly  changes,  as  additional juveniles  receive  life \nsentences  with  the  possibility  of parole,  some  later  become  parole-eligible, \nand  others  are  released  under  parole  supervision. \nli.  The  questions  of law  and  fact  presented  by the  Named  Plaintiffs  are  common \nto  other  members  of the  class.  Such  questions  include,  generally,  whether, \n31\n ,nr A hr dalaS ye A )37 PaoyeSee  CLvee   PULP?Re O  PShMae bweb  oROe y   LA FgeeVsR    t3L f AOSOCE UEIYERM GNoR Th   bofEC E   eBreee iPeeS Rg  EN  FGPS LaOfTf ipvParPik  oS e  rLPN RaNgx e    oOyYf ey   GNFY  £  aohA 4s  \nunder  federal  and  state  law,  Defendants  provide  a  meaningful  opportunity  for \nrelease  upon  demonstrated  rehabilitation  and  maturity.

The  violations  alleged  by Named  Plaintiffs  are  typical  of those  suffered  by  the \nclass.  The  entire  class  will  benefit  from  the  relief sought. \niv.  Named  plaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  interests  of the  class. \nNamed  Plaintiffs  have  no  interests  adverse  to  or  in  conflict with  those  of the \nother  Class  Members.  Plaintiffs’  counsel  have  experience  in  constitutional \nlitigation.

Defendants,  in  their  official  capacity  as  Commissioners  of the  Board  of Parole, \nhave  acted  and  are  acting  under  color  of state  law. \n140.  The  Eighth  Amendment to  the  U.S.  Constitution  forbids  a  statutory  scheme  that \nmandates  life  imprisonment  for juvenile  offenders  or  permits  life  sentences  without  providing \nthem  with  a realistic  and  meaningful  opportunity  for  release  upon  demonstrated  maturity  and \nrehabilitation. \n141.  Defendants  have  denied  and  continue  to  deny  Plamtiffs,  and  members  of the  class, \na meaningful  opportunity  for  release  to  Plaintiffs  and  other  members  of the  class  by,  among  other \nthings,  (1)  failing  to  consider  the  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation  of juvenile  ifers  who \nare  up  for  parole;  (2)  failing  to  give juvenile  lifers  any  explanation  as  to  what  additional  steps \nthey  must take  to  be  recommended  for  parole;  (3)  denying  release  to  parole  supervision  based \nupon  crimes  Plaintiffs  committed  decades  ago  that  they  cannot  change:  (4)  failing  to  fully \nconsider,  read  or  attend  to  an  inmate’s  parole  submission;  (5)  denying juvenile  lifers  the  right  to \nhave  an  attorney  present  at their  interviews  and  the  right to  see  and  confront  any  evidence  against \nthem;  and  (6)  using  risk  assessment  tools  that  discriminate  against  youth.  With  these  actions, \nDefendants  have  denied  Plaintiffs  and  other  members  of the  class  a  meaningful  and  realistic \nopportunity  for  release  upon  ther  showing  of maturity  and  rehabilitation,  in  violation  of the \nEighth  Amendment. \n142.  Plaintiffs  Flores  and  Bartley,  and  all  others  similarly  situated,  have  been  injured \nby  Defendants’  policies  and  practices  by  being  dented  their  rights  to  meaningful  opportunity  for \nrelease  from  imprisonment  notwithstanding  their  vouth  at the  tume  of their  offense  and  despite \ntheir  demonstration  of maturity  and  rehabilitation,  in  viclation  of the  prohibition  against  cruel\nand  unusual  punishments  in  the  Eighth  Amendment to  the  U.S.  Constitution,  giving  rise  to  their \nclaims  for  relief under  42  ULS.C.  $1983. \nSECOND  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n(For  Violation  of the  Prohibition Against  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishment  in Article  1,  §  5  of the \nNew  York  Constitution.) \n[43.  The  allegations  of the  preceding  paragraphs  are  incorporated  by  reference  as  if \nfully  set  forth  herein. \n144,  The  New  York  Constitution  forbids  the  mfliction  of cruel  and  unusual \npunishments.  Accordingly,  the New  York  Constitution  should  be  interpreted  to  forbid  life \nunprisonment  for puverntle  offenders  or  life  sentences  without  providing  them  with  a  realistic  and \nmeaningful  opportunity  for  release  upon  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation.  Consistent \nwith  this  constitutional  requirement,  the  New  York  Legislature  recently  restricted  the  discretion \nofthe  Board  of Parole  and  now  requires  that  parole  release  determmations  be  based  on  objective, \ndynamic  and  forward-looking  considerations. \n[45.  Defendants  have  denied  and  continue  to  deny  Plaintiffs,  and  members  of the  class, \nameaningtul  opportunity  for  release  to  Plaintiffs  and  other  members  of the  class  by,  among  other \nthings,  (1)  failing  to  consider  the  demonstrated  maturity  and  rehabilitation  of puvenile  lifers  who \nare  up  for  parole,  (2)  failing  to  deny juvenile  lifers  any  explanation  as  to  what  additional  steps \nthey  must  take  to  be  recommended  for  parole;  (3)  denying  release  to  parole  supervision  based \nupon  crimes  Plaintiffs  committed  decades  ago  that  they  cannot  change;  (4)  failing  to  fully \nconsider,  read  or  attend  to  an  inmate's  parole  submission:  (5}  denying juvenile  liters  the  right  to \nhave  an  attorney  present  at their  interviews  and  the  right  to  see  and  confront  any  evidence  against \nthem;  and  (6)  using  risk  assessment  tools  that  discriminate  against  youth.

The  allegations  of the  preceding  paragraphs  are  incorporated  by  reference  as  if \nfully  set  forth  herein. \n148.  Defendants,  in  their  official  capacity  as  Commussioners  of the  Board  of Parole, \nhave  acted  and  are  acting  under  color  of state  Law. \n[49.  Under  established  U.S.  Supreme  Court  case  law,  the  Eighth  Amendment  of the \nU.S.  Constitution  confers  upon juvenile  lifers  a  legitimate  expectancy  of parole  upon  a  showing \nof maturation  and  rehabilitation.  This  is  a  liberty  interest  protected  by  the  Due  Process  Clause. \n[50.  In  2011,  the  New  York  Legislature  amended  the  Executive  Law  to  mandate  that \nthe  Board  of Parole  “establish  written  procedures”  that  “shall  incorporate  risk  and  needs \nprinciples  to  measure”  the  rehabilitation  of inmates.  N.Y.  Exec.  Law  §  259-c(4).  The  Executive \nLaw,  as  amended  in  2011,  provides  prisoners  with  a  legitimate  expectancy  that  if they \ndemonstrate  rehabilitation  and  a  strong  likehhood  of future  compliance  with the  law,  they will  be \ngranted  parole.  This  is  a  liberty  imterest  protected  by  the  Due  Process  Clause. \n 4\ni~\nCase  7:18-cv-02468-VB  Document  1  Filed  03/20/18  Page  38  of  44 \n151.  In  2017,  the  Board  of Parole  amended  its  regulations  to  require  that  its  decision- \nmaking  “shall  be  guided  by  risk  and  needs  principles”.  9  NYCRR  §  8002.2(a).  The  regulations \nacknowledge  a presumption  of release  upon  rehabilitation  (notwithstanding  nonbinding \ndisclaimers  in  the  commentary)  by  requiring  Commissioners  to  provide  nonconculsory \nindividualized  reasons  based  in  the  record  for  any  departure  from  the  conclusions  of a validated \nrisk  assessment  instrument,  but  only  when that  departure  is  denying  release.  9  NYCRR \n§  8002.2(a).  The  regulations  also  require  Commissioners  to  address  all  statutory  factors  in  each \nhearing.  Id.  §  8002.2(c).  The  Board  of Parole  regulations,  as  amended  in  2017,  provide \nprisoners  with  a  legitimate  expectancy that  if they  demonstrate  rehabilitation  and  a  strong \nlikelihood  of future  compliance  with  the  law,  they  will  be  granted  parole.  This  is  a  liberty \ninterest  protected  by the  Due  Process  Clause. \n152.  Defendants’  conduct  and  actions  —  including,  inter  alia,  regularly  failing  to  read, \nreview,  and  consider  extensive  evidence  submitted  to  the  Board  of Parole  demonstrating  low  risk \nto  community,  rehabilitation  and  maturity —  deny  Plaintiffs,  and  members  of the  class,  the  due \nprocess  of law  to  secure  their  limited  liberty  interest  in  parole  release,  in  violation  of the  Due \nProcess  Clause  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  of the  U.S.  Constitution. \n153.  Plaintiffs,  and  members  of the  class,  have  been  injured  and  will  likely  suffer \nfuture  injury,  as  a  result  of Defendants’  official  policies  and  regular  practices,  which  fail  to \nadequately  distinguish  between  persons  serving  life  sentences  for  crimes  committed  as  children \nand  those  committed  as  adults,  and  Defendants’  failure  to  provide  sufficient  procedural \nprotections  necessary  to  secure  the  substantive  right to  release  upon  a  showing  of maturity  and \nreform  in  violation  of the  Due  Process  Clause  of the  Fourteenth Amendment,  giving  rise  to \nPlaintiffs’  claims  for  relief under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983. \n38\né\\ “e= tmhy eEht  ay  OFFe e OEeSkr   MAP VeOP PeSRSO  ’ SehA SaeeS O   YOL N FTPVei    5Le r,  SSPA EDe! a mote   pePC eeaHd.Ee S   rUPey AaP   Py enye  fa  Me  RaeeAn Q,aEe s   oTTSEYLSE    OeAxFFt    4ofA 4A  \nx \nFOURTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n(Por  Violation  of the  Due  Process  Clause  of Article  1,  §  6  of the  New  York  Constitution.) \n134.

Plamtitfs,  and  members  of the  class,  have  been  injured  and  will  likely  suffer \nfuture  injury,  as  a  result  of Defendants’  policies  and  regular  practices,  which  fail  to  adequately \ndistinguish  between  persons  serving  life  sentences  for  crimes  committed  as  children  and  those \ncomunitted  as  adults,  and  Defendants’  failure  to  provide  sufficient  procedural  protections \nnecessary  to  secure  the  substantive  right  to  release  upon  a  showing  of maturity  and  reform  in \nviolation  of the  Due  Process  Clause  of Article  I,  §  6  of the  New  York  Constitution. \nFIFTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n(For  Violation  of the  Right  to  a  Jury  Trial  in  the  Sixth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution, \nactionable  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983.) \n138.

Any  fact that  enhances  the  penalty  to  which  a  criminal  defendant  may  lawfully  be \nsentenced  must  be  found  by  a jury  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  or  admitted  by the  criminal \ndefendant.  See Apprendi  v.  New  Jersey,  530  U.S.  466,  490  (2000);  Ring  v.  Arizona,  536  U.S. \n  \n584,  604-05  (2002);  Alleyne  v.  United  States,  570  U.S.  99,  114-15  (2013). \n  \n161.

Class  Members  were  each  similarly  convicted  by  a jury  without  such \na  finding  or  pleaded  guilty  without  pleading  to  such a fact. \n163.  Defendants’  conduct  and  actions  —  including,  inter  alia,  taking  into  account  facts \nthat  impose  greater  punishment  on  the  parole  applicant than  was  authorized  by a  jury  verdict  or \nguilty  plea —  deny  Plaintiffs,  and  members  of the  class,  their  right to  have  only  facts  that  have \nbeen  authorized  by  a jury  verdict  or  guilty  plea  expose  them  to  punishment,  in  violation  of the \njury  trial  right  of the  Sixth  Amendment  of the  U.S.  Constitution. \n164.  Plaintiffs,  and  members  of the  class,  have  been  injured  and  will  likely  suffer \nfuture  injury,  as  a  result  of Defendants’  denial  of parole  release  based  on  an  aggravating  factor \nrelating  to  the  crime  of conviction  that was  not  an  element  of the jury  verdict  or  plea  convicting \nPlaintiff at the  original  criminal  trial,  in  violation  of Plaintiffs’  right to  a jury  trial  under  the  Sixth \nAmendment to  the  U.S.  Constitution,  giving  rise  to  Plaintiffs’  claims  for  relief under  42  U.S.C. \n§1983. \n40\noe Jo re id 4 wn? cris  copes, \nSIXTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n(For  Violation  of the  Right to  a Jury  Trial  m  Article  1,  §  2  ofthe  New  York  Constitution.) \n165.

They claim defendants have violated and will \ncontinue to violate their Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights by denying them a \n1 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 2 of 25\n“realistic and meaningful opportunity for release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation”  (Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) ¶ 1), and they seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of similarly situated persons, which the second \namended complaint refers to as “juvenile lifers” (SAC ¶ 2). \n  Now before the Court is defendants’ motion to dismiss the second amended complaint \npursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  (Doc. #114). \n  For the reasons set forth below, the motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN \nPART.  Plaintiffs’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims, insofar as they seek declaratory \nrelief, shall proceed.  Their Sixth Amendment claim, and all claims to the extent they seek \ninjunctive relief, are dismissed. \n  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \nBACKGROUND \n  For the purpose of ruling on the motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all well-\npleaded factual allegations in the second amended complaint, considers matters properly subject \nto judicial notice, and draws all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs’ favor, as summarized below.1 \nI.  The Plaintiffs \n  Each plaintiff was convicted by a New York State court of committing homicide as a \njuvenile.  Each received an indeterminate prison sentence up to a maximum term of life with the \npossibility of parole, to be served in the custody of the New York State Department of \nCorrections and Community Supervision (“DOCCS”). \n                                                 \n1   In support of the instant motion, defendants submitted Parole Board records including \ntranscripts of plaintiffs’ parole interviews.  (Doc. #115).  Those materials are extrinsic to the \nsecond amended complaint.  Accordingly, the Court has not considered them.  See Chambers v. \nTime Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 153 (2d Cir. 2002). \n2 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 3 of 25\nPlaintiff Flores committed felony murder of an off-duty police officer while robbing a bar \nin 1981, at age 17.  Flores’s accomplice shot and killed the police officer after the officer drew a \ngun while trying to stop the robbery.  Flores was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 21 \nyears to life.  He was denied parole ten times before being granted parole on his eleventh \napplication.  On June 25, 2018, DOCCS released Flores from custody after he served 37 years in \nprison.2  He was 54 when released. \nPlaintiff Bartley committed murder and other crimes when he participated in a gunfight at \na movie theater during which twenty shots were fired and an innocent bystander was killed.  \nBartley was 17.  He was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 27⅓ years to life.  Bartley \nserved more than 27 years in custody before being granted parole in April 2018.  DOCCS \nreleased Bartley to parole supervision in May 2018.  He left prison at the age of 45. \n  Plaintiff Bennett committed felony murder at the age of 15, allegedly “under the direction \nof a man in his thirties” who fatally shot a police officer during a robbery in which Bennett \nparticipated.  (SAC ¶ 35).  Bennett claims he did not plan the robbery and was in another room \ntying up a victim when the older man murdered the officer.  Bennett was sentenced to an \nindeterminate prison term of nine years to life.  In September 2018, after spending more than 23 \nyears in prison, Bennett was granted parole. \n  Plaintiff Delima committed murder in 2005, at the age of 13.  He claims he was shopping \nwith several older men, including one whom he called his “godfather,” when the group got into a \nfight with an individual who proceeded to slash Delima’s godfather in the face.  Delima says one \n                                                 \n2   The Court takes judicial notice of plaintiffs’ release dates.  All plaintiffs were released \nfrom prison after this lawsuit began.  As the Court previously noted (Doc. #77), the fact that the \nnamed plaintiffs have been released does not moot the “inherently transitory” class claims in this \ncase.  See Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 391, 938–39 (2d Cir. 1993). \n3 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 4 of 25\nof the older men in his group then handed Delima a gun that Delima used to shoot the purported \nassailant five times, killing him.  Delima was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of nine \nyears to life.  The Board granted him parole after interviewing him in February 2019.  Delima \nwas released from DOCCS custody in April 2019, at the age of 27. \n  Plaintiff Lebron committed murder and other crimes in 1990, assaulting and stabbing his \nvictim to death.  Lebron was 15 at the time.  He claims he turned to crime because he wanted to \nmove from New York to Puerto Rico to be with his father, and two acquaintances offered to buy \nhim a plane ticket to Puerto Rico if he helped them commit robberies.  Lebron was sentenced to \nan indeterminate prison term of eight and one-half years to life.  He served 28 years in prison \nbefore being paroled in August 2018, on his eleventh try.  DOCCS released Lebron in October \n2018 at the age of 43. \n  Plaintiff Roman was 17 years old when he committed a murder in 1995.  A man Roman \nmet at a party allegedly offered Roman money and a car in return for which Roman would help \nthe man kill the man’s father, stepmother, “and anyone else in the[ir] house,” because the man \nbelieved his father planned to disinherit him.  (SAC ¶ 69).  Roman shot and killed the stepmother \nand was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 20 years to life.  Roman served nearly 24 \nyears in prison and was denied parole three times.  In September 2018, the Board granted Roman \nparole.  Two months later, at the age of 41, Roman was released to parole supervision. \n  Plaintiff Quinones shot and killed a man in January 1993 over a $12 debt.  Quinones was \n16 years old.  He was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 15 years to life.  In 1994 or \n1995, while incarcerated, Quinones was convicted of promoting prison contraband and of an \nattempted first-degree assault during which he used a razor blade to attack another inmate.  \nThese subsequent convictions increased Quinones’s aggregate sentence to 21 years to life.  After \n4 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 5 of 25\nbeing denied parole three times, the Board granted him parole in 2019.  Quinones was released to \nparole supervision at the age of 44. \n  Plaintiff Logan was 16 years old when he murdered “a random stranger” whom Logan \ntried to rob on the street in 2001.  (SAC ¶ 94).  He was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term \nof 16 years to life.  The Parole Board denied Logan parole after a December 19, 2017, parole \ninterview, in part because Logan had received “two Tier-II disciplinary tickets” while \nincarcerated.  (Id. ¶ 98).  Logan later received parole.  In 2019, he was released at the age of 34 \nto parole supervision.  \nII.  Statutory and Regulatory Framework \n  New York law governs the Parole Board’s discretionary parole determinations.  Pursuant \nto Section 259-i(2)(c)(A) of the New York Executive Law, the Parole Board shall not grant an \noffender discretionary parole “merely as a reward for” the offender’s “good conduct or efficient \nperformance of duties” while incarcerated.  N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-i(2)(c)(A).  Rather, the Board \nshould grant discretionary parole “after considering if there is a reasonable probability that” the \noffender “will live and remain at liberty without violating the law” if paroled, and that the \noffender’s “release is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not so deprecate the \nseriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for law.”  Id. \n  The Executive Law states the Parole Board “shall” consider the following factors when \nmaking this determination:  (i) the offender’s “institutional record”; (ii) the offender’s \nperformance “in a temporary release program,” if any; (iii) the offender’s “release plans”; \n(iv) “any deportation order” and “recommendation regarding deportation”; (v) any statement to \nthe Parole Board by the offender’s victim or, in certain circumstances, the victim’s \nrepresentative; (vi) if applicable, the determinate sentence the offender would have received for \n5 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 6 of 25\nhis conviction under certain specified circumstances; (vii) “the seriousness of the offense,” \nincluding the type and length of the offender’s  sentence, the recommendations of the sentencing \ncourt, prosecutor, and the offender’s attorney, the offender’s pre-sentence probation report, “any \nmitigating and aggravating factors,” and the offender’s “activities following arrest prior to \nconfinement”; and (viii) the offender’s prior criminal record.  N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-i(2)(c)(A). \n  The Parole Board has promulgated regulations implementing this statutory directive.  \nAmong other things, the regulations require the Parole Board to make parole determinations \n“guided by risk and needs principles, including the [offender’s] risk and needs scores as \ngenerated by a periodically-validated risk assessment instrument.”  9 N.Y.C.R.R. § 8002.2(a).  \nThe regulations also reiterate in substance the eight statutory factors listed above.  Id. \n§ 8000.2(d). \n  In addition, and as particularly relevant here, the Parole Board has enacted a regulatory \nprovision governing parole determinations for juvenile offenders.  This rule requires the Parole \nBoard to consider “(i) [t]he diminished culpability of youth; and (ii) [g]rowth and maturity since \nthe time of the commitment offense.”  9 N.Y.C.R.R. § 8002.2(c)(1).  The rule further provides, \nInformation presented that the hallmark features of youth were causative of, or \ncontributing factors to, a minor offender’s commitment offense, should not, in \nitself, be construed to demonstrate lack of insight or minimization of the minor \noffender’s role in the commitment offense.  The hallmark features of youth include \nimmaturity,  impetuosity,  a  failure  to  appreciate  risks  and  consequences,  and \nsusceptibility  to  peer  and  familial  pressures. \n \nId. § 8002.2(c)(2). \nIII.  Procedural Allegations \nAccording to the second amended complaint, the Parole Board’s fourteen commissioners \nconduct approximately 12,000 parole interviews each year and also perform other duties \nincluding hearing appeals, interviewing crime victims, traveling, serving on subcommittees, and \n6 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 7 of 25\nperforming administrative tasks.  This workload allegedly results in defendants frequently \nhearing and deciding juvenile lifers’ parole applications with minimal consideration and without \nreviewing the offenders’ files. \n  Plaintiffs allege a juvenile seeking parole from a maximum prison sentence of life is \nassessed by an interview panel of two or three commissioners.  A panel allegedly conducts \napproximately 40 to 70 interviews per week, typically spread over two eight-hour days.  Before \nhis or her interview, each offender submits materials to the panel, including a personal statement, \n“programmatic achievements,” and letters supporting the offender’s parole application.  (SAC \n¶ 186).  Commissioners “sometimes” receive an interviewee’s parole materials the day before the \ninterview, and “often” receive them the morning of the interview.  (Id. ¶ 187).  Plaintiffs claim \nno regulation or policy requires commissioners to read an offender’s parole materials before \ninterviewing the offender and deciding whether to grant the offender discretionary parole.  \nAccording to plaintiffs, Chairwoman Stanford has acknowledged that “not everyone does it.”  \n(Id. ¶ 190). \nThe Board assigns a “lead” commissioner for each parole interview.  (SAC ¶ 192).  \nAccording to plaintiffs, during an offender’s interview, only that lead commissioner has a \ncomplete copy of the offender’s parole file, which may contain hundreds of pages.  Non-lead \ncommissioners allegedly receive only a partial, “book copy” of the offender’s file, comprising a \none-page “condensed version of the Parole Board Report,” the offender’s “modified rap sheet,” \nthe offender’s disciplinary record, and the offender’s “COMPAS report”—a report applying \nCorrectional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (“COMPAS”), which \nDOCCS allegedly uses as a predictive risk assessment tool.  (Id. ¶ 193). \n7 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 8 of 25\nA typical parole interview allegedly lasts approximately twenty minutes.  According to \nthe second amended complaint, the lead commissioner often spends most of that time recounting \nthe details of the offender’s crime.  Plaintiffs assert that non-lead commissioners often do not \nlisten to the lead commissioner’s questions or the offender’s answers, focusing instead on \npreparing for subsequent interviews for which they are assigned as lead.  Plaintiffs claim each \npanel member nonetheless “has an equal vote to grant or deny release.”  (SAC ¶ 199).  \nAccording to plaintiffs, panels often predetermine parole outcomes and prepare written denials \nbefore conducting interviews.  When the panel does not predetermine an outcome, it allegedly \ndecides whether to grant or deny discretionary parole during post-interview deliberations that \n“typically” last from two to five minutes per offender.  (Id. ¶ 201). \nPlaintiffs allege that twelve of the Parole Board’s fourteen commissioners “have no \nsubstantial training in any discipline—such as child psychology, criminology or social work—\nthat would enable them to competently evaluate whether an underlying crime reflected the \n[offender’s] transient immaturity or youth[,] or instead permanent incorrigibility.”  (SAC ¶ 204).  \nCommissioners allegedly do not seek the input of experts, pay for offenders to retain their own \nexperts, or pay for an attorney to represent an offender at his or her parole interview.  The second \namended complaint also asserts juvenile offenders suffer mental impairments at a “substantially \nhigher” rate than adolescents “not involved with the justice system,” allegedly raising the risk \nthat commissioners unaided by a psychological expert may unwittingly deny parole based on an \noffender’s undiagnosed or untreated psychiatric or cognitive impairment.  (Id. ¶ 207). \n  A juvenile offender’s COMPAS score allegedly serves as one factor commissioners \nconsider when deciding whether to grant the offender discretionary parole.  According to \nplaintiffs, COMPAS is a commercial product sold by a private company, comprising “secret \n8 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 9 of 25\nalgorithms” unknown to the Parole Board and its commissioners; “[a]s a result, COMPAS is a \nblack box.”  (SAC ¶ 213).  Plaintiffs claim defendants rely on COMPAS “without knowing how \nor whether COMPAS considers the diminished culpability of juveniles and the hallmark features \nof youth.”  (Id.).  Indeed, plaintiffs believe COMPAS holds young offenders’ ages against them \nby “sometimes treat[ing] youth as an aggravating factor” in various ways.  (Id. ¶ 211).  Plaintiffs \nclaim the Parole Board’s reliance on an algorithm of which the Parole Board and its \ncommissioners lack knowledge or understanding deprives juvenile offenders sentenced to a \nmaximum prison term of life of the individualized assessments to which they are constitutionally \nentitled. \n  Finally, commissioners allegedly point to juvenile offenders’ “previous involvement in \nthe juvenile justice system” (SAC ¶ 217) and their juvenile inmate disciplinary records as \nreasons to deny parole, without assessing whether that prior conduct is attributable to “the \nhallmark features of youth” (id. ¶ 220) or to an undiagnosed or untreated medical, emotional, or \npsychiatric condition.   \n  In addition to these general procedural allegations, each individual plaintiff alleges \ndefendants violated his constitutional rights by doing at least five of the following:  (i) failing to \nfully read or consider the plaintiff’s parole submissions; (ii) denying the plaintiff and his attorney \naccess to letters allegedly opposing his release; (iii) denying the plaintiff the rights to have an \nattorney present at his parole interview and to confront evidence against his release; (iv) denying \nthe plaintiff the chance to “inspect and challenge the method of calculating his COMPAS score”; \n(v) denying the plaintiff parole based solely on the nature of his crimes; (vi) denying the plaintiff \nparole without regard to the plaintiff’s demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation while \n9 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 10 of 25\nincarcerated; and (vii) not explaining to the plaintiff “what additional steps he must take to be \nrecommended for parole.”3  (See SAC ¶¶ 23, 34, 46, 55, 67, 77, 91, 102). \nIV.  Substantive Allegations \n  Plaintiffs also claim defendants interpret and apply the law governing discretionary \nparole determinations for juveniles serving a maximum prison term of life in a manner that \nviolates those offenders’ substantive Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual \npunishment. \nNamely, plaintiffs allege defendants “have denied, and continue to deny” parole to those \noffenders “based only on the crime committed or juvenile criminal history, despite clear \nevidence of rehabilitation and maturity.”  (SAC ¶ 153; see id. ¶ 166 (“Defendants continue to \ndeny juvenile lifers release to parole supervision even after they have demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation.”).  According to the second amended complaint, defendants interpret the \nConstitution and the New York Executive Law as permitting them to deny parole to a juvenile \noffender serving a maximum life term—even if the offender has matured and been \nrehabilitated—if defendants believe releasing the offender “would be ‘not compatible with the \nwelfare of society’ or would ‘so deprecate the seriousness of [the] crime as to undermine respect \nfor law.”  (Id. ¶ 151 (quoting N.Y. Exec. Law § 259-i(2)(c)(A); see id. ¶¶ 158, 160–61, 163–65, \n173, 180). \n                                                 \n3   Plaintiffs allege defendants engaged in different combinations of these actions in each \nplaintiff’s individual case.  Plaintiff Logan also alleges defendants violated his constitutional \nrights by denying him parole “based on ‘official opposition’ that Mr. Logan did not have an \nopportunity to inspect and controvert.”  (SAC ¶ 102). \n10 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 11 of 25\nDISCUSSION \nI.  Legal Standards \nA.  Rule 12(b)(1) \n“[F]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and lack the power to disregard such \nlimits as have been imposed by the Constitution or Congress.”  Durant, Nichols, Houston, \nHodgson, & Cortese-Costa, P.C. v. Dupont, 565 F.3d 56, 62 (2d Cir. 2009).4  A cause of action \n“is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) when the \ndistrict court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it,” Nike, Inc. v. Already, \nLLC, 663 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir. 2011).  The party invoking the Court’s jurisdiction bears the \nburden to establish that jurisdiction exists.  Conyers v. Rossides, 558 F.3d 137, 143 (2d Cir. \n2009). \nWhen deciding whether subject matter jurisdiction exists at the pleading stage, the Court \n“must accept as true all material facts alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences \nin the plaintiff’s favor.”  Conyers v. Rossides, 558 F.3d at 143.  “However, argumentative \ninferences favorable to the party asserting jurisdiction should not be drawn.”  Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. \nv. Balfour Maclaine Int’l Ltd., 968 F.2d 196, 198 (2d Cir. 1992). \nWhen a defendant moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and on other \ngrounds, the court typically should consider the Rule 12(b)(1) challenge first.  Rhulen Agency, \nInc. v. Ala. Ins. Guar. Ass’n, 896 F.2d 674, 678 (2d Cir. 1990). \n                                                 \n4   Unless otherwise indicated, case quotations omit all citations, internal quotation marks, \nfootnotes, and alterations. \n11 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 12 of 25\nB.  Rule 12(b)(6)     \n  In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court evaluates the sufficiency of the operative \ncomplaint under the “two-pronged approach” articulated by the Supreme Court in Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).  First, a plaintiff’s legal conclusions and “[t]hreadbare recitals \nof the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements,” are not entitled \nto the assumption of truth and are thus not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.  Id. at 678; \nHayden v. Paterson, 594 F.3d 150, 161 (2d Cir. 2010).  Second, “[w]hen there are well-pleaded \nfactual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they \nplausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. \n  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint’s allegations must meet a standard of \n“plausibility.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, \n564 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows \nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  “The plausibility standard is not akin to a \n‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.”  Id. (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). \nII.  Pullman Abstention \n  Defendants urge the Court to abstain from addressing plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to the \nPullman abstention doctrine. \n  The Court declines to do so. \n  The Pullman doctrine enables “federal courts to abstain from decision when difficult and \nunsettled questions of state law must be resolved before a substantial federal constitutional \nquestion can be decided.”  Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 221 F.3d 376, 384 (2d Cir. \n12 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 13 of 25\n2000).  “Abstention under the Pullman doctrine may be appropriate when three conditions are \nmet:  (1) an unclear state statute is at issue; (2) resolution of the federal constitutional issue \ndepends on the interpretation of the state law; and (3) the law is susceptible to an interpretation \nby a state court that would avoid or modify the federal constitutional issue.”  Id. at 385.  The \ndoctrine “involves a discretionary exercise of a court’s equity powers” in light of “a careful \nbalancing of the important factors as they apply in a given case, with the balance heavily \nweighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction.”  Id.  Put another way, Pullman abstention \n“should be utilized with strict circumspection.”  Id. \n  Here, none of the relevant factors weighs in favor of abstention.  First, the pertinent state \nstatute and regulations are not unclear.  Second, plaintiffs’ federal constitutional claims do not \ndepend on an interpretation of New York State law—rather, they depend on an interpretation and \napplication of federal Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.  And third, the state laws and \nregulations implicated here may not be reasonably interpreted so as to avoid the constitutional \nissues plaintiffs’ claims present. \n  Thus, exercising its discretion, the Court declines to abstain.5 \nIII.  Absolute Immunity \n  Defendants argue absolute immunity shields them from plaintiffs’ claims. \n  The Court agrees to the extent plaintiffs seek injunctive relief but disagrees to the extent \nthey seek declaratory relief. \n                                                 \n5   Defendants argue collateral estoppel and res judicata preclude plaintiffs’ claims.  (Defs’ \nBr. at 23 n.12).  Defendants forfeited this argument by raising it in a footnote.  See, e.g., United \nStates v. Greenfield, 831 F.3d 106, 118 n.9 (2d Cir. 2016).  The Court declines to address it.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 14 of 25\n  A.  Injunctive Relief \n  Parole board officials enjoy absolute judicial immunity from claims against them for \ndamages arising from their “quasi-adjudicative function in deciding whether to grant, deny or \nrevoke parole.”  Montero v. Travis, 171 F.3d 757, 761 (2d Cir. 1999).  Pursuant to Section 1983, \nthis immunity also extends to claims for injunctive relief against a parole board official arising \nfrom the official’s quasi-adjudicative function, see id., “unless a declaratory decree was violated \nor declaratory relief was unavailable” to the plaintiff, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n  Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint does not allege any defendant violated a \ndeclaratory decree or that declaratory relief was unavailable to plaintiffs when they commenced \nthis action.  Accordingly, insofar as plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, their claims must be \ndismissed on grounds of absolute immunity.  See Montero v. Travis, 171 F.3d at 761. \n  B.  Declaratory Relief \nDefendants also invoke absolute immunity from declaratory relief.  In support, \ndefendants argue the second amended complaint “attempt[s] to frame injunctive relief as \ndeclaratory relief.”  (Doc. #116 (“Defs’ Br.”) at 10; Doc. #126 at 3).  Defendants offer no further \nexplanation.  The Court declines to engage with this undeveloped argument.  See, e.g., Chase v. \nNodine’s Smokehouse, Inc., 360 F. Supp. 3d 98, 121 n.6 (D. Conn. 2019) (declining to address \ncursory one-sentence argument).  In any case, Section 1983’s text explicitly contemplates the \navailability of declaratory relief against a government official acting in his or her official \ncapacity, see 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and plaintiffs take the position that a declaratory judgment, if \n14 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 15 of 25\nultimately awarded, could provide them all the relief they seek without the need for an \ninjunction.6 \nJudicial immunity therefore does not preclude plaintiffs’ claims to the extent they seek \ndeclaratory relief.7 \nIV.  Eighth Amendment Claim \n  Defendants contend plaintiffs fail adequately to plead defendants violate the Eighth \nAmendment rights of juvenile offenders serving maximum terms of life in prison. \n  The Court disagrees. \n  A.  Legal Standard \n  The Supreme Court has held in a line of three cases—Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 \n(2010), Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012), and Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. 718 \n(2016)—that the Eighth Amendment prohibits sentencing a juvenile convicted of homicide to a \nmandatory life sentence without parole.8  Concluding “that a lifetime in prison is a \ndisproportionate sentence for all but the rarest of children,” Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. \nat 726 (quoting Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. at 479–80), the Supreme Court has directed that a \njudge may sentence a juvenile murderer to mandatory life without parole only if the juvenile \n                                                 \n6   At this stage of the case, the Court takes no position on the proper scope or substance of \ndeclaratory relief, if any, in this matter. \n \n7   Defendants also note that the Second Circuit dismissed in Guerin v. Higgins, 8 F. App’x \n31 (2d Cir. 2001) (summary order), a declaratory claim filed under Section 1983 against a judge, \non grounds of absolute immunity from declaratory relief.  Id. at 32.  The Court declines to follow \nthat summary order.  It both is non-binding and does not appear to stand for the proposition that \na government official sued under Section 1983 is immune from declaratory relief.  See id. \n(holding that Congress “effectively overruled” a specific Supreme Court opinion by amending \nSection 1983). \n \n8   The Constitution also prohibits sentencing to life without parole “a juvenile offender who \ndid not commit homicide.”  Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. at 82. \n15 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 16 of 25\n“exhibits such irretrievable depravity that rehabilitation is impossible and life without parole is \njustified,” id. at 733. \nAccordingly, the Constitution requires a sentencing judge to consider a juvenile \nmurderer’s “‘diminished culpability and heightened capacity for change’ before condemning him \nor her to die in prison.”  Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. at 726 (quoting Miller v. Alabama, \n567 U.S. at 471).  The state “is not required to guarantee” eventual release from prison to parole \nfor a juvenile offender serving life.  Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. at 479 (quoting Graham v. \nFlorida, 560 U.S. at 75).  However, the Constitution demands that the state afford such a juvenile \n“some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation.”  Id. (quoting Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. at 75). \nIn Montgomery v Louisiana, the Supreme Court held that this substantive constitutional \nrequirement applies retroactively.  Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. at 732–36.  The \nMontgomery Court further stated that its holding “does not require States to relitigate sentences” \nof juvenile life without parole, because “[a] State may remedy a Miller violation by permitting \njuvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them.”  Id. \nat 736.  The Court explained that rendering Miller-effected juveniles parole-eligible “ensures that \njuveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity—and who have since matured—will \nnot be forced to serve a disproportionate sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment.”  Id.  \nThus, “[t]hose prisoners who have shown an inability to reform will continue to serve life \nsentences,” while “[t]he opportunity for release will be afforded to those who demonstrate . . . \nthat children who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change.”  Id. \nThe Appellate Division, Third Department, of the New York State Supreme Court has \nheld that Graham, Miller, and Montgomery’s holdings extend to discretionary parole \n16 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 17 of 25\ndeterminations in New York.  Hawkins v. N.Y. State Dep’t of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 140 \nA.D.3d 34 (3d Dep’t 2016).  Thus, the Parole Board, “as the entity charged with determining \nwhether” a juvenile offender convicted of homicide “will serve a life sentence, . . . [must] \nconsider the significance of [the offender’s] youth and its attendant circumstances at the time of \nthe commission of the crime before making a parole determination.”  Id. at 36.  The Appellate \nDivision described this as “the minimal procedural requirement necessary” to protect the \nsubstantive Eighth Amendment rights of juvenile homicide offenders sentenced to a maximum \nterm of life imprisonment.  Id. \n  B.  Application \n1.  The Eighth Amendment Applies to Parole Proceedings \n  As an initial matter, the Court holds that the constitutional protections recognized by \nGraham, Miller, and Montgomery apply to parole proceedings for juvenile offenders serving a \nmaximum term of life imprisonment. \n  Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has addressed whether Graham, \nMiller, and Montgomery’s reach extends beyond sentencing and to parole.9  Federal courts are \ndivided on this question.  Compare, e.g., Brown v. Precythe, 2018 WL 4956519, at *5–7 (W.D. \nMo. Oct 12, 2018) (collecting cases) (applying Graham, Miller, and Montgomery to parole \ndeterminations), with Bowling v. Dir., Va. Dep’t of Corr., 920 F.3d 192, 197–99 (4th Cir. 2019) \n(“[W]e are satisfied that th[e] protections [recognized in Graham, Miller, and Montgomery] have \nnot yet reached a juvenile offender who has and will continue to receive parole consideration.”). \n                                                 \n9   Nor has either court resolved whether Graham, Miller, and Montgomery’s holdings apply \nto (i) juveniles sentenced to discretionary life without parole sentences, or (ii) juveniles \nsentenced to life with parole.  The Supreme Court recently granted certiorari in a case presenting \nthe former question.  Mathena v. Malvo, No. 18-217, 139 S. Ct. 1317 (2019) (Mem.). \n17 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 18 of 25\nThe Court finds more persuasive those decisions holding that the Eighth Amendment \nright in question attaches at the parole stage. \nIn arguing to the contrary, defendants emphasize that the relevant Supreme Court cases \naddress factors properly considered by a judge at the time a juvenile offender is sentenced—not \nby a parole board deciding whether to grant a juvenile offender parole.  True enough.  \nNonetheless, parole boards are uniquely empowered to deliver a juvenile lifer’s “categorical \nentitlement to ‘demonstrate maturity and reform,’ to show that ‘he is fit to rejoin society,’ and to \nhave a ‘meaningful opportunity for release.’”  Greiman v. Hodges, 79 F. Supp. 3d 933, 945 (S.D. \nIowa 2015) (quoting Graham, 560 U.S. at 79).  In other words, a parole board is the vehicle \nthrough which the rights recognized in Graham, Miller, and Montgomery are delivered.  As such, \na parole board must make parole determinations in a constitutional manner for juveniles to whom \nGraham, Miller, and Montgomery apply, “in the sense that the board . . . [must] take[] into \naccount the offender’s status as a child when the crime was committed.”  Diatchenko v. Dist. \nAttorney for Suffolk Dist., 27 N.E.3d 349, 368 (Mass. 2015) (analyzing claims brought under the \nEighth Amendment and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights).  Numerous courts have so \nheld.  See, e.g., Brown v. Precythe, 2018 WL 4956519, at *7 (collecting cases); Hawkins v. N.Y. \nState Dep’t of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 140 A.D.3d at 36.  The Court agrees with this \nauthority and likewise holds that Graham, Miller, and Montgomery vest in juvenile offenders \nsentenced to a maximum term of life imprisonment an Eighth Amendment right that attaches to \nthose offenders’ parole proceedings, which the Constitution mandates must amount to a \n“meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.”  \nMiller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. at 479 (quoting Graham, 560 U.S. at 75). \n18 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 19 of 25\n    2.  Plaintiffs Plausibly Allege an Eighth Amendment Violation \n  The next question is whether plaintiffs adequately plead that the manner in which \ndefendants make discretionary parole determinations for juvenile offenders serving a maximum \nterm of life violates the Eighth Amendment. \n  The Court holds that they do. \n  Defendants assert plaintiffs are wrong to suggest the Eighth Amendment requires that \nsuch determinations be based on the offenders’ demonstrated growth and maturity only, “to the \nexclusion of other relevant factors and principles.”  (Defs’ Br. at 16, 18).  But this argument \nmisconstrues plaintiffs’ arguments and allegations.  Plaintiffs do not contend the Eighth \nAmendment forbids a Parole Board from considering any factors except growth and maturity.  \nRather, plaintiffs argue defendants may properly consider any applicable statutory and regulatory \nfactor, so long as they ultimately “base their parole determinations on Plaintiffs’ current maturity \nand rehabilitation.”  (Doc. #119 (“Pls’ Opp. Br.”) at 12).  According to the second amended \ncomplaint, that is not the opportunity plaintiffs received:  Instead of basing parole determinations \non juvenile lifers’ demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation, defendants allegedly “have denied, \nand continue to deny, juvenile lifers release to parole supervision based only on the crime \ncommitted or juvenile criminal history,” and “despite clear evidence of rehabilitation and \nmaturity” (SAC ¶ 153 (emphases added)).  At this stage of the proceedings, the Court must \naccept this allegation as true; and if true, that contravenes Montgomery.  Thus, plaintiffs \nplausibly allege that the manner in which defendants adjudicate juvenile lifers’ parole \napplications violates the Eighth Amendment. \n  The Court therefore declines to dismiss plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim. \n19 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 20 of 25\nV.  Fourteenth Amendment Claim \n  Defendants assert plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment due process claim fails because \nplaintiffs have no liberty interest in parole.  In their reply brief, defendants also urge the Court to \nfind that the procedures the Parole Board affords juvenile homicide offenders sentenced to \npotential life terms satisfy the Constitution’s due process guarantee. \n  The Court disagrees that plaintiffs have no liberty interest in parole, and declines to rule \non the procedural adequacy of plaintiffs’ parole proceedings at this early stage of the case. \n  A.  Liberty Interest in Parole \n  First, juvenile offenders serving a maximum term of life have a cognizable liberty interest \nin obtaining parole upon demonstrating maturity and rehabilitation. \n“[T]o have a protectable liberty interest” in parole, “a prisoner must have more than a \nhope or a unilateral expectation of release.  He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of \nentitlement to it.”  Victory v. Pataki, 814 F.3d 47, 59 (2d Cir. 2016).  Accordingly, for a typical \nprisoner “who has not been granted parole, neither the mere possibility of release, nor a \nstatistical probability of release, gives rise to” a cognizable liberty interest in parole.  Id. at 60.  \nBefore Graham, Miller, and Montgomery, courts therefore commonly recognized the general \nproposition that prisoners ordinarily “have no liberty interest in parole, and the protections of the \nDue Process Clause are inapplicable.”  Barna v. Travis, 239 F.3d 169, 171 (2d Cir. 2001). \nBut Graham, Miller, and Montgomery changed that with respect to juvenile offenders \nserving a maximum prison term of life.   Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s holdings in those \ncases, “[i]f [a parole b]oard determines that a juvenile offender has demonstrated maturity and \nrehabilitation, parole or work release is required as a matter of law.”  Bonilla v. Iowa Bd. of \nParole, 930 N.W.2d 751, 777 (Iowa 2019) (citing Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. at 736; \n20 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 21 of 25\nGraham v. Florida, 560 U.S. at 75).  Thus, “although Graham stops short of guaranteeing parole, \nit does provide the juvenile offender with substantially more than a possibility of parole or a \nmere hope of parole; it creates a categorical entitlement to demonstrate maturity and reform, to \nshow that he is fit to rejoin society, and to have a meaningful opportunity for release.”  Greiman \nv. Hodges, 79 F. Supp. 3d at 945.  Graham, Miller, and Montgomery therefore confer on juvenile \noffenders a constitutionally protected “liberty interest in a meaningful parole review.”  Brown v. \nPrecythe, 2017 WL 4980872, at *12 (W.D. Mo. Oct. 31, 2017).10 \nAccordingly, the Court declines to dismiss plaintiffs’ due process claim on the ground \nthat juvenile offenders serving potential life prison terms lack a liberty interest in parole. \n  B.  Adequacy of Procedures \n  Second, the Court cannot find at this stage of the case that the procedures the Parole \nBoard affords juvenile lifers satisfy procedural due process as a matter of law. \n  “Due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular \nsituation demands.  A fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a \nmeaningful time and in a meaningful manner.”  Brown v. Precythe, 2017 WL 4980872, at *12.  \nTo pass constitutional muster, the parole procedures defendants provide to juvenile offenders to \nwhom Graham, Miller, and Montgomery apply must satisfy the balancing test established in \nMathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).  That well-known test calls for balancing the \n                                                 \n10   Accord Bonilla v. Iowa Bd. of Parole, 930 N.W.2d at 777; Hawkins v. N.Y. State Dep’t \nof Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 140 A.D.3d at 38–40; Hill v. Whitmer, 2019 WL 3067977, at *5 \n(E.D. Mich. July 12, 2019); Hayden v. Keller, 134 F. Supp. 3d 1000, 1010–11 (E.D.N.C. 2015); \nGreiman v. Hodges, 79 F. Supp. 3d at 945.  \n \n  Some federal district courts have held to the contrary in summary fashion.  See Lewis v. \nOkla. Pardon & Parole Bd., 2019 WL 2612666, at *2 (W.D. Okla. Feb. 6, 2019), report and \nrecommendation adopted, 2019 WL 1500671 (W.D. Okla. Apr. 5, 2019); Hill v. Snyder, 2011 \nWL 2788205, at *6 (E.D. Mich. July 15, 2011). \n21 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 22 of 25\nplaintiff’s interests against those of the state.  See, e.g., Bonilla v. Iowa Bd. of Parole, 930 \nN.W.2d at 775. \nAssuming plaintiffs’ factual allegations are true and drawing all reasonable inferences in \ntheir favor, the Court finds plausible plaintiffs’ claim that the parole procedures for juveniles \nserving potential life terms do not satisfy due process.  According to plaintiffs, Parole Board \ncommissioners commonly do not even read such offenders’ files before conducting parole \ninterviews or making parole determinations; make parole determinations based at least in part on \na risk assessment algorithm the workings of which no defendant knows or understands; \npredetermine parole outcomes before conducting parole interviews; and pay no attention to other \ncommissioners’ questions and offenders’ answers during interviews.  Plaintiffs further allege \ndefendants did these things in plaintiffs’ individual cases.  Taken together, these and the second \namended complaint’s other procedural allegations plausibly evidence that the Parole Board does \nnot afford juvenile homicide offenders serving potential life terms a procedurally adequate \n“meaningful opportunity” for release.  Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. at 479 (quoting Graham v. \nFlorida, 560 U.S. at 75); see, e.g., Brown v. Precythe, 2017 WL 4980872, at *12 & n.7. \nThe Court consequently declines to find that plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim fails \nas a matter of law. \nVI.  Sixth Amendment Claim \n  Lastly, defendants contend plaintiffs’ Sixth Amendment allegations fail to state a viable \nconstitutional claim. \n  The Court agrees. \n  Plaintiffs’ Sixth Amendment claim arises from the Supreme Court’s decision in Apprendi \nv. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and the line of cases that followed.  In Apprendi, the \n22 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 23 of 25\nSupreme Court held that under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, “Other than the fact of a \nprior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory \nmaximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Id. at 490.  This \n“constitutional rule” applies only when a criminal defendant’s sentence is “greater than the \nprescribed statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.”  United States v. Thomas, 274 F.3d \n655, 664 (2d Cir. 2001). \n  Here, each plaintiff was sentenced to a maximum term of life imprisonment with the \npossibility of parole.  That sentence is not alleged to exceed any plaintiff’s “prescribed statutory \nmaximum” sentence.  United States v. Thomas, 274 F.3d at 664.  Because this necessary \ncondition is not satisfied as to any plaintiff, the instant case falls outside Apprendi’s reach.  See \nKing v. Landreman, 2019 WL 2355545, at *2 (W.D. Wis. June 4, 2019). \n  Plaintiffs’ principal arguments to the contrary rest on the premise that the Parole Board’s \ndenials of juvenile lifers’ parole applications “amount to” the imposition of de facto sentences of \nlife without the possibility of parole—a sentence plaintiffs say does exceed their statutory \nmaxima.  (Pls. Opp. Br. at 29).  But this premise does not hold up:  Every named plaintiff has \nnow been released from custody, belying the dubious notion that an offender who has been \ndenied parole in the past necessarily will never be granted parole in the future.  Indeed, all \nplaintiffs except Flores and Delima were in their low- or mid-40’s when released from prison—\nFlores was 54, and Delima was 27.  It simply cannot be that DOCCS imposed on any of these \nparoled offenders “de facto life without parole.”  (Id. at 2). \n  To be sure, some courts have recognized that a juvenile offender can receive a de facto \nsentence of life without parole, triggering Graham, Miller, and Montgomery’s protections even \nthough the sentence imposed does not bear the formal “life without parole” title.  However, those \n23 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 24 of 25\ncourts have done so respecting prison terms the minimum length of which comes close to or \nexceeds the offender’s life expectancy.  See, e.g., Bowling v. Dir., Va. Dep’t of Corr., 920 F.3d \nat 197–98 (collecting federal cases); Starks v. Easterling, 659 F. App’x 277, 283 (6th Cir. 2016) \n(unpublished opinion) (White, J., concurring) (collecting state cases).  No plaintiff’s minimum \nsentence comes anywhere near his life expectancy, nor does the second amended complaint \nallege otherwise.  Thus, the concept of a de facto life without parole sentence has no application \nhere. \nThe Court also rejects plaintiffs’ argument that defendants violate Apprendi by denying \nparole to juvenile offenders serving potential life terms “based on new fact-finding” that \nplaintiffs say must be performed by a jury.  (Doc. #132 at 1).  Miller “did not impose a formal \nfactfinding requirement.”  Montgomery v. Louisiana, 136 S. Ct. at 735.  Further, Montgomery \ninstructs that a state can “remedy a Miller violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to \nbe considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them.”  Id. at 736.  Parole Board \ncommissioners therefore may evaluate whether a juvenile offender meets the proper criteria for \ndiscretionary release, even if the fact finder did not address those criteria in the offender’s \nunderlying criminal proceedings. \n  For all these reasons, the Court dismisses plaintiffs’ Sixth Amendment claim. \n   \n24 \n \n\nCase 7:18-cv-02468-VB   Document 137   Filed 09/20/19   Page 25 of 25\nCONCLUSION \nThe motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \nPlaintiffs’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims, to the extent they seek declaratory \nrelief, shall proceed.  Their Sixth Amendment Claim, and all claims to the extent they seek \ninjunctive relief, are dismissed. \nThe Court will schedule an initial pretrial conference by separate Order. \nThe Clerk is instructed to terminate the motion.  (Doc. #114). \nDated:  September 20, 2019 \n   White Plains, NY \n \nSO ORDERED: \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nVincent L. Briccetti \nUnited States District Judge \n25 \n ",

Plaintiffs filed the complaint in this action on March 20, 2018. (Doc. #1 ).\nOn March 23, 2018, electronic summonses were issued to defendants. (Doc. #21). On\nthe same date, plaintiffs' counsel moved to certify a class of \"[a]ll persons eligible for\nrelease to parole supervision who were convicted of crimes committed when they were\nchildren under the age of 18 and sentenced to indeterminate life sentences with the\npossibility of parole in the custody of the New York State Department of Corrections\nand Community Supervision.\" (Doc. #22). However, defendants have not yet been\nserved, nor has defendants' counsel appeared. In view of the foregoing, by April 9,\n2018, plaintiffs' counsel shall show cause in writing why the motion for class\ncertification should not be denied without prejudice as premature. So Ordered.
