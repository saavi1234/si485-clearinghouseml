    "summary": "<p>On November 17, 2011, Prison Legal News (PLN) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The plaintiff sued the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), the Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) Secretary in his official capacity, and GEO Group. Claiming violations of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants illegally censored PLNโs news publications and books from prisoners. Represented by the Florida Justice Institute and the Human Rights Defense Center, the plaintiff sought monetary, declaratory and injunctive relief and attorney fees and costs. Judge Robert L. Hinkle was initially assigned to the case before it was reassigned to Judge Mark Walker on December 21, 2012.</p><p>In January 2012, the plaintiff filed its first amended complaint. All defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. On June 7, 2012, the motions were denied. The defendants then filed their answers to the amended complaint.</p><p>In March 2012, the defendants moved to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The motion was granted and it was transferred on April 3, 2012. On April 12, 2012, PLN moved to transfer the case to the Tallahassee Division, and the court granted this request on May 9, 2012.</p><p>On October 10, 2012, the defendants each moved for summary judgment.</p><p>On January 29, 2013, the parties moved to dismiss the CCA and the Geo Group, as defendants without opposition because the parties had reached a private settlement agreement. The court approved this dismissal and retained jurisdiction over the private settlement agreement to ensure compliance. The lawsuit against the secretary of the FDOC remained.</p><p>The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on March 8, 2013. On August 11, 2014, after the court held hearings on the issue, it denied both motions for summary judgment. The case proceeded to trial.</p><p>January 5, 2015, began a four-day bench trial between PLN and FDOC. On October 5, 2015, the court dismissed the plaintiffโs First Amendment claims but ruled in favor of the plaintiffโs Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Due Process claims. 2015 WL 12911752. While it acknowledged that FDOC had valid security concerns regarding PLNโs publications, the court found that FDOC did not give the plaintiff proper notice before censoring those publications. Thus, the court prohibited FDOC from censoring the plaintiffโs written communication without due process of law. To ensure due process, the court ordered FDOC to give notice of future censorship of PLNโs publications. </p><p>PLN appealed the dismissal of the First Amendment claim.  On May 17, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the lower courtโs decision, finding that the district court had not abused its discretion. 2018 WL 2251249. Judges Edward Carnes (Chief Judge), Joel Dubina (Circuit Judge), and Anne Conway (US District Judge for the Middle District of Florida) were assigned to this appeal. In September of 2018, the plaintiff moved to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. </p><p>On January 7, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court denied cert. 139 S.Ct. 795. </p><p>Following this denial, PLN moved for attorney's fees in February, 2019. On October 22, 2019, the court issued an order awarding PLN $1,148,210.89 in attorneys' fees, $33,448.57 in expenses, and $6,204.42 in costs. PLNs total judgment amount was $1,187,863.88. </p><p>The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the permanent injunction.</p>",

Its target market is \nprisoners.  The State of Florida Department of Corrections has rules that restrict \nthe materials that may be mailed to prisoners.  In its first amended complaint, the \nplaintiff asserts that, without notice to the plaintiff, the rules have been applied to \nblock its publications, that the rules as so applied violate the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments, and that the failure to give the plaintiff notice violates the Due \nProcess Clause.  The first amended complaint names as defendants the DOC \nSecretary in his official capacity and two private corporations that operate \ncorrectional facilities under contract with DOC. \n \nCase No.   4:12cv239-RH/CAS\n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 65   Filed 06/07/12   Page 2 of 3\n \nPage 2 of 3\n \n  The defendants have moved to dismiss the first amended complaint for \nfailure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.   The defendantsโ primary \nassertion, in effect, is that the DOC rules are facially constitutional.  But facially \nvalid rules can be unconstitutionally applied.  See, e.g., Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 \nU.S. 401, 404, 419 (1989).  Whether that has occurred here cannot properly be \ndetermined on the defendantsโ motions to dismiss.   \n  This does not mean, though, that a determination of the as-applied claims \nmust await prolonged discovery.  See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant Cnty. Narcotics \nIntelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168-69 (1993) (โfederal courts \nand litigants must rely on summary judgment and control of discovery to weed out \nunmeritorious claims sooner rather than laterโ).  The attorneys should cooperate \nwith the goal of efficiently preparing and presenting the case on the merits so that \nthe side that is entitled to prevailโwhether plaintiff or defendantsโcan do so \nwithout undue burden.   \n  That leaves for consideration the motion to dismiss the Due Process claims.  \nThe defendants are incorrect when they assert that notice to a publisher is never \nrequired.  See Montcalm Publโg. Corp. v. Beck, 80 F.3d 105, 109 (4th Cir. 1996); \nMartin v. Kelley, 803 F.2d 236, 243-44 (6th Cir. 1986); Jacklovich v. Simmons, \n392 F.3d 420, 433-34 (10th Cir. 2004); see also Abdul Wali v. Coughlin, 754 F.2d \n1015, 1027-28 (2d Cir. 1985); Trudeau v. Wyrick, 713 F.2d 1360, 1366-67 (8th \n \nCase No.   4:12cv239-RH/CAS\n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 65   Filed 06/07/12   Page 3 of 3\n \nPage 3 of 3\n \nCir. 1983); Prison Legal News v. Cook, 238 F.3d 1145, 1152-53 (9th Cir. 2001).  \nThe first amended complaint adequately states a claim on which relief can be \ngranted. \n  For these reasons,  \n  IT IS ORDERED: \n  The motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief can be \ngranted, ECF No. 29 and 37, are DENIED. \n   SO ORDERED on June 7, 2012. \n            s/Robert L.

Plaintiff, PRISON LEGAL NEWS, brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, \nto  enjoin  Defendants,  THE  GEO  GROUP,  INC.,  a  Florida  Corporation,  CORRECTIONS \nCORPORATION OF AMERICA, a Tennessee Corporation registered in and doing business in the \nstate of Florida, and KENNETH S. TUCKER, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Florida \nDepartment of Corrections (โFDOCโ), from barring, in violation of the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution, the receipt by inmate subscribers of the journal Prison Legal \nNews, and to require Defendants to provide Plaintiff with constitutionally required notice as well as \n{07046133;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 14   Filed 12/16/11   Page 2 of 17\n \nan opportunity to be heard and/or protest the decision each time Plaintiffโs publications are censored \nby Defendants.  Plaintiff also seeks a declaratory judgment that Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., is \nunconstitutional as applied by the Defendants to Plaintiff, because it is used by the Defendants to \njustify the prohibition on sending literature to inmates, which has adversely affected Plaintiffโs \nservices to Floridaโs inmates. \n2.  Plaintiff brings this action because the Defendants have repeatedly ignored their \nconstitutional duty to allow Plaintiffโs publications into their institutions.  In fact, the FDOC โ \nthrough the Defendant Secretary โ has disregarded previous rulings by the Eleventh Circuit on this \nissue, and has continued to censor these publications despite previously changing its policy to allow \nthese same publications and rendering an earlier identical lawsuit moot. \n3.  Plaintiff has worked for years to provide news and information to inmates regarding \ntheir education, well-being, and safety, while abiding by the guidelines of the institutions into which \nthey send their publications.  Defendantsโ policies have injured Plaintiff, as well as the inmates with \nwhom they correspond, because Defendants continue to deny Plaintiff the right to send inmates \npublications designed to benefit them, both while incarcerated and after their release.  \nJurisdiction and Venue \n4.  Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question), as this \naction arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343 \n(civil rights), as this action seeks redress for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n5.  Plaintiffโs claims for relief are predicated upon 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, which authorizes \nactions to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights, privileges and immunities \n-2- \n{07046133;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 14   Filed 12/16/11   Page 3 of 17\n \nsecured to the Plaintiff by the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and \nlaws of the United States. \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction over claims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n7.  Plaintiffโs claim for attorneysโ fees and costs is predicated upon 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, \nwhich authorizes the award of attorneysโ fees and costs to prevailing plaintiffs in actions brought \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n8.  Venue properly lies in the Southern District of Florida pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 \nand Local Rule 3.4(d), S.D. Fla.  Defendant The Geo Group, Incโs corporate World Headquarters \nand principal place of business is located within the Southern District of Florida, Defendant \nCorrections Corporation of Americaโs registered agent resides in the Southern District of Florida, \nDefendant Tucker has a Regional office, eight facilities and thousands of inmates in the Southern \nDistrict of Florida, and โa substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claimโ \noccurred in the Southern District of Florida. \n9.

Defendant, The GEO Group, Inc. (hereinafter โGEOโ), is a Florida, for-profit \ncorporation with its corporate World Headquarters located in Boca Raton, Florida.  GEO provides \ncorrectional operation and management services to state and local governments around the world. \n12.  At all times material to this action, GEO contracted with the Florida Department of \nManagement Services (hereinafter โDMSโ) to assume the full operation and management of \nBlackwater River Correctional Facility (hereinafter โBlackwaterโ) in Milton, Florida.  Blackwater \nconfines a large number of inmates who have sought and been prohibited by Defendant GEO from \nreceiving Plaintiffโs publications.  Defendant GEO has authority pursuant to Rule ยง 33-501.401, \nF.A.C., to impound incoming mail, including Plaintiffโs publications, and is required by Rule ยง 33-\n501.401, F.A.C., to notify Plaintiff that its mail has been censored.

Graceville confines a large number of \ninmates who have sought and been prohibited by Defendant CCA from receiving Plaintiffโs \npublications.  Defendant CCA has authority pursuant to Rule ยง 33-501.401, F.A.C., to impound \nincoming mail, including Plaintiffโs publications, and is required by Rule ยง 33-501.401, F.A.C., to \n-4- \n{07046133;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 14   Filed 12/16/11   Page 5 of 17\n \nnotify Plaintiff that its mail has been censored.  Defendant CCA is sued for injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief, damages, attorneysโ fees and costs. \n15.  Defendant, Kenneth S. Tucker, is the Secretary of the FDOC.  Under Defendant \nTuckerโs control, the FDOC manages all correctional facilities within the state of Florida, with the \nexception of those facilities managed by Defendants GEO and CCA.  Defendant Tucker has ultimate \nresponsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of all FDOC rules, policies and procedures, and \nadministrative code provisions, and is responsible for the overall management of the Florida prison \nsystem.  As Secretary, Defendant Tucker is the highest ranking official of the FDOC, and is \nresponsible for the enactment and enforcement of Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C.  Defendant Tucker \nis sued in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief, attorneysโ fees and costs. \n16.

Plaintiff, PLN, is the publisher of a monthly magazine, Prison Legal News, and a \ndistributor of books and other materials pertaining to the legal rights of prisoners and the conditions \naffecting prisoners. \n18.  The purpose of PLN, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, Article III, Part 6, is to \neducate prisoners and the public about the destructive nature of racism, sexism, and the economic \nand social costs of prisons to society.   \n19.  For the past 21 years, the core of PLNโs mission has been public education, advocacy \nand outreach on behalf of, and for the purpose of assisting, prisoners who seek legal redress for \ninfringements of their constitutionally guaranteed and other basic human rights. \n-5- \n{07046133;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 14   Filed 12/16/11   Page 6 of 17\n \n20.  Prison Legal News is comprised of writings from legal scholars, attorneys, inmates \nand news wire services.  Prison Legal News has approximately 7,000 subscribers in the United \nStates and abroad, including subscribers in prisons in all 50 states.  Prison Legal News has numerous \nprisoner subscribers in the Florida state correctional system, including facilities organized and run \nby the Defendants.  Subscribers to Prison Legal News also include attorneys, judges, journalists, \nacademics, and others who have an interest in topics included in the magazine.  \n21.  Plaintiffโs publications, books and other materials, as described above, are political \nspeech and social commentary, which are at the core of First Amendment values and are entitled to \nthe highest protection afforded by the U.S. Constitution. \n22.  Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., provides: \n(3)  Inmates shall be permitted to receive and possess publications per terms and \nconditions established in this rule unless the publication is found to be detrimental to \nthe security, order or disciplinary or rehabilitative interests of any institution of the \ndepartment, or any privately operated institution housing inmates committed to the \ncustody of the department, or when it is determined that the publication might \nfacilitate criminal activity.  Publications shall be rejected when one of the following \ncriteria is met: \n  โฆ \n(l)  It contains an advertisement promoting any of the following where the \nadvertisement is the focus of, rather than being incidental to, the publication \nor the advertising is prominent or prevalent throughout the publication. \n    1.  Three-way calling services; \n    2.  Pen pal services; \n    3.  The purchase of products or services with postage stamps; or \n    4.  Conducting a business or profession while incarcerated. \n \n  (m) It otherwise presents a threat to the security, order or rehabilitative  \n  objectives of the correctional system or to the safety of any person. \n \n(emphasis added). \n \n-6- \n{07046133;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 14   Filed 12/16/11   Page 7 of 17\n \n23.  Defendants, by and through their application of Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., have \ncaused substantial harm to Plaintiff.  The effect of Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., is to deny Plaintiff \nits right to send literature to its inmate subscribers.  Since Defendantsโ application of Rule ยง 33-\n501.401(3), F.A.C., to Plaintiff, Plaintiff has been unable to send its publications to inmate \nsubscribers in the Defendantsโ custody.  As such, Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., substantially chills \nPlaintiffโs ability to communicate with its inmate subscribers, impedes Plaintiffโs ability to \ndisseminate its political message, frustrates Plaintiffโs organizational mission and diverts its limited \nresources, and violates Plaintiffโs rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment. \n24.  This is not the first time that Plaintiff has been forced to file suit to ensure that the \nDefendants comply with their constitutional obligations with regard to these publications.  Initially, \nPlaintiff was able to send its publications to Florida inmate subscribers without incident.  Beginning \nin approximately February 2003, the FDOC โ through the Defendant Secretary โ refused to allow \ndelivery of Prison Legal News, citing Rule ยง 33-501.401, F.A.C.  This censorship was based on \nadvertisements in Prison Legal News, which included three-way calling services, pen-pal services, \nand advertisements concerning the sale of postage stamps and inmate artwork.  This censorship and \nrefusal to allow delivery of Prison Legal News occurred even though the FDOC had previously \napproved subscriptions to Prison Legal News.  Nonetheless, the FDOC refused to deliver the \nsubscriptions, and Plaintiff filed suit. \n25.  During the lawsuit that ensued, the FDOC โ through the Defendant Secretary โ \namended Rule ยง 33-501.401, F.A.C., three separate times to allow Prison Legal News, and \nPlaintiffโs other publications, to be sent into FDOC institutions.  See Prison Legal News v. \nMcDonough, 200 Fed. Appโx 873, 875-76 (11th Cir. 2006).  Based solely on these changes in \n-7- \n{07046133;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 14   Filed 12/16/11   Page 8 of 17\n \npolicy, as well as the FDOCโs representation to the Court that they would not resume the \nimpoundment of Prison Legal News, the Middle District of Florida, and later the Eleventh Circuit, \nfound the case to be moot.  See id. at 878 (โ[A]lthough the FDOC previously wavered on its decision \nto impound [Prison Legal News], it presented sufficient evidence to show that it has โno intent to ban \nPLN based solely on the advertising content at issue in this caseโ in the future โฆ and that the \nmagazine will not be rejected based on its advertising content โฆ We have no expectation that FDOC \nwill resume the practice of impounding publications based on incidental advertisements.โ).   \n26.  Despite the FDOCโs representation to the district court and the Eleventh Circuit, the \nFDOC โ through the Defendant Secretary โ again revised the challenged rule in 2009 and began to \nagain impound and censor Prison Legal News and Plaintiffโs other publications based solely on their \nadvertising content, despite the fact that the prevalence of advertisements in the impounded \npublications had not been altered in any way since the FDOCโs misrepresentations to the district \ncourt and the Eleventh Circuit. \n27.  Since the FDOCโs latest revision to the challenged rule and Defendantsโ resumed \ncensorship of Prison Legal News, Plaintiff has been unable to fulfill its stated mission of educating \nprisoners and has been unable to distribute its constitutionally protected materials to inmates in \nDefendantsโ custody.   \n28.  None of the publications at issue in this case violate Defendantsโ policies or \nregulations and the censorship of these materials furthers no legitimate penological interest.  \nNonetheless, Defendants are refusing to allow these publications to be delivered to Florida inmate \nsubscribers on the basis that they โpresent a threat to the security, order, or rehabilitative objectives \nof the correctional system or the safety of any person,โ for the sole reason that the publications \n-8- \n{07046133;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 14   Filed 12/16/11   Page 9 of 17\n \ncontain โadvertising [which is] prevalent throughout the publication for (1) three-way calling \nservices; (2) pen-pal services; (3) the purchase of products or services with postage stamps; or (4) \nconducting a business or profession while incarcerated.โ  See Admissible Reading Material Rule, \nRule ยง 33-501.401(3)(l) and (m), F.A.C. \n29.  Since the Defendantsโ resumed censorship of Plaintiffโs publications, Defendants \nhave failed and refused to provide Plaintiff with notice and an opportunity to be heard and/or protest \nthe decision each time Plaintiffโs publications are censored by the Defendants.  \n30.  Since the FDOC โ through the Defendant Secretary โ began to again impound and \ncensor Prison Legal News and Plaintiffโs other publications in 2009, Plaintiff has filed numerous \nappeals regarding the rejection of Prison Legal News and Plaintiffโs other impounded publications \nwith the FDOCโs Literature Review Committee when Plaintiff is informed by its inmate subscribers \nthat its publications have been rejected by the Defendants.  All of Plaintiffโs appeals have been \ndenied.  \n31.  There is not a valid, rational connection between the Defendantsโ application of Rule \nยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., to Plaintiffโs publications, and any legitimate governmental interest put \nforward to attempt to justify it. \nCount One - Unconstitutional Censorship of PLN \nDefendant The GEO Group, Inc. \n \n32.

Plaintiff, Prison Legal News, brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, to \nenjoin Defendant officials of the Florida Department of Corrections (โFDOCโ) from barring, in \nviolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, the receipt by inmate \nsubscribers of the journal Prison Legal News, and to require the FDOC to provide Plaintiff with \nconstitutionally required notice as well as an opportunity to be heard and/or protest the decision each \ntime Plaintiffโs publications are censored by the FDOC.  Plaintiff also seeks a declaratory judgment \n{07044425;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 11/17/11   Page 2 of 12\n \nthat Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., is unconstitutional as applied by the FDOC to Plaintiff, because it \nis used by the FDOC to justify the prohibition on sending literature to inmates, which has adversely \naffected Plaintiffโs services to Floridaโs inmates. \n2.  Plaintiff brings this action because the FDOC has repeatedly ignored its constitutional \nduty to allow Plaintiffโs publications into FDOC institutions.  The FDOC has disregarded previous \nrulings by the Eleventh Circuit on this issue, and has continued to censor these publications despite \npreviously changing their policy to allow these same publications and rendering an earlier identical \nlawsuit moot. \n3.  Plaintiff has worked for years to provide news and information to inmates regarding \ntheir education, well-being, and safety, while abiding by the guidelines of the institutions into which \nthey send their publications.  The FDOCโs ever-changing policies have injured Plaintiff, as well as \nthe inmates with whom they correspond, because the FDOC continues to deny Plaintiff the right to \nsend inmates publications designed to benefit them, both while incarcerated and after their release.  \nJurisdiction and Venue \n4.  Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question), as this \naction arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343 \n(civil rights), as this action seeks redress for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n5.  Plaintiffโs claims for relief are predicated upon 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, which authorizes \nactions to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights, privileges and immunities \nsecured to the Plaintiff by the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and \nlaws of the United States. \n-2- \n{07044425;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 11/17/11   Page 3 of 12\n \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction over claims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n7.  Plaintiffโs claim for attorneysโ fees and costs is predicated upon 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, \nwhich authorizes the award of attorneysโ fees and costs to prevailing plaintiffs in actions brought \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n8.  Venue properly lies in this division of the Southern District of Florida pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1391 and Local Rule 3.4(d), S.D. Fla.  Defendants Mayo, Churchwell and Jenkins all reside \nin the Southern District of Florida, and โa substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claimโ occurred in this division of the Southern District of Florida. \n9.

Defendant, Larry Mayo, is the Warden of Everglades Correctional Institution \n(โEvergladesโ), located in Miami, Florida, within the division and district of this Court.  Everglades \nconfines a large number of inmates who have sought and been prohibited by Defendants from \nreceiving Plaintiffโs publications.  Defendant Mayo has authority pursuant to Rule ยง 33-501.401, \nF.A.C., to impound incoming mail, including Plaintiffโs publications, and is required by Rule ยง 33-\n-3- \n{07044425;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 11/17/11   Page 4 of 12\n \n501.401, F.A.C., to notify Plaintiff that its mail has been censored.  Defendant Mayo is sued in his \nofficial capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief, attorneysโ fees and costs. \n12.  Defendant, William Churchwell, is the Warden of Dade Correctional Institution \n(โDadeโ), located in Florida City, Florida, within the division and district of this Court.  Dade \nconfines a large number of inmates who have sought and been prohibited by Defendants from \nreceiving Plaintiffโs publications.  Defendant Churchwell has authority pursuant to Rule ยง 33-\n501.401, F.A.C., to impound incoming mail, including Plaintiffโs publications, and is required by \nRule ยง 33-501.401, F.A.C., to notify Plaintiff that its mail has been censored.  Defendant Churchwell \nis sued in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief, attorneysโ fees and costs. \n13.  Defendant, Norman Jenkins, is the Warden of Homestead Correctional Institution \n(โHomesteadโ), located in Florida City, Florida, within the division and district of this Court.  \nHomestead confines a large number of inmates who have sought and been prohibited by Defendants \nfrom receiving Plaintiffโs publications.  Defendant Jenkins has authority pursuant to Rule ยง 33-\n501.401, F.A.C., to impound incoming mail, including Plaintiffโs publications, and is required by \nRule ยง 33-501.401, F.A.C., to notify Plaintiff that its mail has been censored.  Defendant Jenkins is \nsued in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief, attorneysโ fees and costs. \n14.  Defendant, Kenneth S. Tucker, is the Secretary of the FDOC.  Under Defendant \nTuckerโs  control,  the  FDOC  manages  all  correctional  facilities  within  the  state  of  Florida.  \nDefendant Tucker has ultimate responsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of all FDOC \nrules, policies and procedures, and administrative code provisions, and is responsible for the overall \nmanagement of the Florida prison system.  As Secretary, Defendant Tucker is the highest ranking \nofficial of the FDOC, and is responsible for the enactment and enforcement of Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), \n-4- \n{07044425;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 11/17/11   Page 5 of 12\n \nF.A.C.  Defendant Tucker is sued in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief, \nattorneysโ fees and costs. \n15.  The actions of all Defendants as alleged herein were taken under the authority and \ncolor of state law. \nFactual Allegations \n16.  Plaintiff, PLN, is the publisher of a monthly magazine, Prison Legal News, and a \ndistributor of books and other materials pertaining to the legal rights of prisoners and the conditions \naffecting prisoners. \n17.  The purpose of PLN, as stated in its Articles of Incorporation, Article III, Part 6, is to \neducate prisoners and the public about the destructive nature of racism, sexism, and the economic \nand social costs of prisons to society.   \n18.  For the past 21 years, the core of PLNโs mission has been public education, advocacy \nand outreach on behalf of, and for the purpose of assisting, prisoners who seek legal redress for \ninfringements of their constitutionally guaranteed and other basic human rights. \n19.  Prison Legal News is comprised of writings from legal scholars, attorneys, inmates \nand news wire services.  Prison Legal News has approximately 7,000 subscribers in the United \nStates and abroad, including subscribers in prisons in all 50 states.  Prison Legal News has numerous \nprisoner subscribers in the Florida state correctional system, including facilities organized and run \nby  the  FDOC,  such  as  the  institutions  run  by  defendants  Mayo,  Churchwell  and  Jenkins.  \nSubscribers to Prison Legal News also include attorneys, judges, journalists, academics, and others \nwho have an interest in topics included in the magazine.  \n-5- \n{07044425;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 11/17/11   Page 6 of 12\n \n20.  Plaintiffโs publications, books and other materials, as described above, are political \nspeech and social commentary, which are at the core of First Amendment values and are entitled to \nthe highest protection afforded by the U.S. Constitution. \n21.  Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., provides: \n(3)  Inmates shall be permitted to receive and possess publications per terms and \nconditions established in this rule unless the publication is found to be detrimental to \nthe security, order or disciplinary or rehabilitative interests of any institution of the \ndepartment, or any privately operated institution housing inmates committed to the \ncustody of the department, or when it is determined that the publication might \nfacilitate criminal activity.  Publications shall be rejected when one of the following \ncriteria is met: \n  โฆ \n(l)  It contains an advertisement promoting any of the following where the \nadvertisement is the focus of, rather than being incidental to, the publication \nor the advertising is prominent or prevalent throughout the publication. \n    1.  Three-way calling services; \n    2.  Pen pal services; \n    3.  The purchase of products or services with postage stamps; or \n    4.  Conducting a business or profession while incarcerated. \n \n(emphasis added). \n \n22.  Defendants, by and through their application of Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., have \ncaused substantial harm to Plaintiff.  The effect of Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., is to deny Plaintiff \nits right to send literature to its inmate subscribers.  Since Defendantsโ application of Rule ยง 33-\n501.401(3), F.A.C., to Plaintiff, Plaintiff has been unable to send its publications to FDOC inmate \nsubscribers.  As such, Rule ยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., substantially chills Plaintiffโs ability to \ncommunicate with its inmate subscribers, and violates Plaintiffโs rights under the First and \nFourteenth Amendment. \n23.  This is not the first time that Plaintiff has been forced to file suit in order to ensure \nthat the FDOC complies with its constitutional obligations with regard to these publications.  \n-6- \n{07044425;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 11/17/11   Page 7 of 12\n \nInitially, Plaintiff was able to send its publications to FDOC inmate subscribers without incident.  \nBeginning in approximately February 2003, the FDOC refused to allow delivery of Prison Legal \nNews, citing Rule ยง 33-501.401, F.A.C.  This censorship was based on advertisements in Prison \nLegal News, which included three-way calling services, pen-pal services, and advertisements \nconcerning the sale of postage stamps and inmate artwork.  This censorship and refusal to allow \ndelivery  of  Prison  Legal  News  occurred  even  though  the  FDOC  had  previously  approved \nsubscriptions to Prison Legal News.  Nonetheless, the FDOC refused to deliver the subscriptions, \nand Plaintiff filed suit. \n24.  During the lawsuit that ensued, the FDOC amended Rule ยง 33-501.401, F.A.C., three \nseparate times to allow Prison Legal News, and Plaintiffโs other publications, to be sent into FDOC \ninstitutions.  See Prison Legal News v. McDonough, 200 Fed. Appโx 873, 875-76 (11th Cir. 2006).  \nBased solely on these changes in policy, as well as the FDOCโs representation to the Court that they \nwould not resume the impoundment of Prison Legal News, the Middle District of Florida, and later \nthe Eleventh Circuit, found the case to be moot.  See id. at 878 (โ[A]lthough the FDOC previously \nwavered on its decision to impound [Prison Legal News], it presented sufficient evidence to show \nthat it has โno intent to ban PLN based solely on the advertising content at issue in this caseโ in the \nfuture โฆ and that the magazine will not be rejected based on its advertising content โฆ We have no \nexpectation that FDOC will resume the practice of impounding publications based on incidental \nadvertisements.โ).   \n25.  Despite the FDOCโs representation to the district court and the Eleventh Circuit, the \nFDOC โ through Defendants โ again revised the challenged rule in 2009 and began to again \nimpound and censor Prison Legal News and Plaintiffโs other publications based solely on their \n-7- \n{07044425;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 11/17/11   Page 8 of 12\n \nadvertising content, despite the fact that the prevalence of advertisements in the impounded \npublications had not been altered in any way since the FDOCโs misrepresentations to the district \ncourt and the Eleventh Circuit. \n26.  Since the FDOCโs latest revision to the challenged rule and resumed censorship of \nPrison Legal News, Plaintiff has been unable to fulfill its stated mission of educating prisoners and \nhas been unable to distribute its constitutionally protected materials to FDOC inmates. Instead, these \npublications have been returned to Plaintiff by defendants Mayo, Churchwell and Jenkins, and other \ncorrectional facilities under the control of defendant Tucker. \n27.  None of the publications at issue in this case violate FDOC policies or regulations \nand the censorship of these materials furthers no legitimate penological interest.  Nonetheless, \nDefendants are refusing to allow these publications to be delivered to Florida inmate subscribers on \nthe basis that they contain โadvertising [which is] prevalent throughout the publication for (1) three-\nway calling services; (2) pen-pal services; (3) the purchase of products or services with postage \nstamps; or (4) conducting a business or profession while incarcerated.โ  See Admissible Reading \nMaterial Rule, Rule ยง 33-501.401(3)(l), F.A.C. \n28.  Since the FDOCโs resumed censorship of Plaintiffโs publications, Defendants have \nfailed and refused to provide Plaintiff with notice and an opportunity to be heard and/or protest the \ndecision each time Plaintiffโs publications are censored by the FDOC.  \n29.  Since the FDOC โ through Defendants โ began to again impound and censor Prison \nLegal News and Plaintiffโs other publications in 2009, Plaintiff has filed numerous appeals regarding \nthe rejection of Prison Legal News and Plaintiffโs other impounded publications with the FDOCโs \n-8- \n{07044425;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 11/17/11   Page 9 of 12\n \nLiterature  Review  Committee  when  Plaintiff  is  informed  by  its  inmate  subscribers  that  its \npublications have been rejected by the FDOC.

There is not a valid, rational connection between the Defendantsโ application of Rule \nยง 33-501.401(3), F.A.C., to Plaintiffโs publications, and any legitimate governmental interest put \nforward to attempt to justify it. \nCount I \n \nUnconstitutional Censorship of PLN \n \n31.

Defendantsโ actions in refusing to deliver or allow delivery of Plaintiffโs publications \nto  Florida  inmates,  solely  because  of  the  presence  of  certain  advertisements  within  these \npublications, violate Plaintiffโs rights of free speech, press and association as protected by the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \nCount II \n \nViolation of Due Process \n \n34.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference all allegations contained in ยถยถ 1 through 30 \nof this Complaint, as if set forth fully herein. \n35.  Defendant officials, in denying Plaintiff its right to communicate with its current and \npotential inmate subscribers, have deprived Plaintiff of constitutionally protected liberty and/or \nproperty interests without due process of law. \n-9- \n{07044425;1} \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 1   Filed 11/17/11   Page 10 of 12\n \n36.

The \nConstitution does place some limits on the measures that corrections officials may \nuse to carry out that duty, which is what this case is about. \nThe Florida Department of Corrections has rules aimed at preventing fraud \nschemes and other criminal activity originating from behind bars, but inmates \ncontinually attempt to circumvent measures in place to enforce those rules.  The \nDepartment, for its part, continually strives to limit sources of temptation and the \nmeans that inmates can use to commit crimes.  One way it does that is by \npreventing inmates from receiving publications with prominent or prevalent \nadvertisements for prohibited services, such as three-way calling and pen pal \nsolicitation, that threaten other inmates and the public.  In the Departmentโs \n                                                 \n  * Honorable Anne C. Conway, United States District Judge for the Middle District of \nFlorida, sitting by designation. \n  1 Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray 19 (Joseph Bristow ed., Oxford Univ. Press \n2006) (1890). \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 4 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 3 of 48 \nexperience, those ads not only tempt inmates to violate the rules and commit \ncrimes, but also enable them to do so.   \nOne publication the Department impounds based on its ad content is plaintiff \nPrison Legal News (PLN)โs monthly magazine, Prison Legal News.  PLN contends \nthat the Departmentโs impoundments of its magazine violate the First and \nFourteenth Amendments.  After a bench trial, the district court ruled that the \nimpoundments do not violate the First Amendment but the failure to give proper \nnotice of them does violate the Fourteenth Amendment.  We agree. \nI.  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nA.  Facts \n1.    The Florida Department of Corrections \n  Florida law requires the Department of Corrections to โprotect the public \nthrough the incarceration and supervision of offenders,โ to protect offenders โfrom \nvictimization within the institution,โ and to rehabilitate offenders.  Fla. \nStat. ยง 20.315(1), (1)(d).  The Department strives to balance those mandates of \npublic safety, prison security, and rehabilitation.  That is no small task.  It employs \n16,700 officers to oversee 100,000 inmates in 123 facilities throughout Florida.  \nThose officers enforce a multitude of rules to ensure prison security and public \nsafety.  See, e.g., Fla. Admin. Code rr. 33-602.101, .201, .203 (rules governing \ninmate care, property, and control of contraband).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 5 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 4 of 48 \nTo promote its rehabilitation mandate, the Department grants inmates phone, \npen pal, and correspondence privileges so that they can stay in touch with family \nand friends.  Id. r. 33-210.101(9) (allowing inmates to correspond with pen pals); \nid. r. 33-602.201 app. 1 (authorizing inmates to keep up to 40 stamps for \ncorrespondence); id. r. 33-602.205(1) (granting telephone privileges).  Those and \nsimilar privileges pose problems in Florida prisons and elsewhere.  Inmates have \nthe time, talent, and tendency to use their phone, pen pal, and correspondence \nprivileges to conduct criminal activity, thwarting efforts to protect inmates and the \npublic.  The record is heavy with evidence of that unfortunate reality. \nJames Upchurch, the Departmentโs Assistant Secretary for Institutions and \nRe-entry, testified that โ[g]iven uncontrolled and unverifiable telephone access, \ninmates have been found to use such opportunities to harass the general public, \n[D]epartment employees, their victims[,] and to search for new victims.โ  He cited \nthe example of incarcerated Mexican mafia members in California who used a \nnetwork of prison phones to sell drugs and conduct other illegal activity.  Prison \nLegal News itself has reported on instances of inmates abusing their phone \nprivileges.  See News in Brief:  Florida, Prison Legal News, Nov. 2011, at 50 \n(reporting how an inmate discovered that the county jailโs phone system provided \ndouble refunds each time a call did not go through, prompting the inmate to make \ncalls and then hang up until he had made the $1,250 he needed for bail); Mark \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 6 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 5 of 48 \nWilson, Reach Out and Defraud Someone:  Oregon Jail Prisoners Commit Phone \nScams, Prison Legal News, Nov. 2010, at 24โ25 (reporting on inmatesโ use of \nprison phones to conduct identity theft scams, one of which resulted in the \nindictment of an inmate on 35 counts of identity theft); News in Brief:  Florida, \nPrison Legal News, Sept. 2010, at 50 (reporting how a county inmate used the \nprison phones to call in bomb threats).2 \n  Like phone privileges, pen pal privileges may open doors to criminal \nactivity.  Inmates abuse pen pal privileges by soliciting kind-hearted but gullible \npeople and then defrauding them.  Pen pal scams are so common that the United \nStates Postal Service warns customers that pen pal ads have โproliferated in recent \nyearsโ and that โmany ads placed by prisoners are part of a sophisticated mail \nfraud scheme that misuses postal money orders to bilk consumers out of their hard \nearned savings.โ3   \n                                                 \n  2 PLN submitted into evidence every issue of Prison Legal News from 2002 through \n2014.   \n  3 Prison Pen Pal Money Order Scam, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, \nhttp://www.postalinspectors.uspis.gov/investigations/mailfraud/fraudschemes/othertypes/penpalf\nraud.aspx [https://web.archive.org/web/20170204190103/postalinspectors.uspis.gov/ \ninvestigations/mailfraud/fraudschemes/othertypes/penpalfraud.aspx]; see also Woods v. Commโr \nof the Ind. Depโt of Corr., 652 F.3d 745, 747 (7th Cir. 2011) (recounting that 350 inmates had \nplaced ads soliciting pen pals on websites, that โthe majority of these inmates \nhad . . . misrepresented themselves to the public in their postings on the sites,โ and that several \npen pals felt deceived after โsending money to prisoners who had lied about their release dates \nand offenses of convictionโ); United States v. Brown, 7 F.3d 1155, 1158 (5th Cir. 1993) (stating \nthat a Mississippi inmate scammed thousands of dollars out of a 65-year-old Florida retiree he \nmet through a โlonely hearts pen-pal clubโ).  [In keeping with Eleventh Circuit Internal \nOperating Procedure 10, โCitation to Internet Materials in an Opinion,โ under Federal Rule of \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 7 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 6 of 48 \n  Inmates also abuse correspondence privileges.  For instance, one Florida  \ninmate sent threatening letters to a federal magistrate judge, one of which informed \nthe judge that someone would โstick a curling iron up [the judgeโs] twat and plug \nthat sucker in,โ while another stated that the inmate was coming to kill her.  See \nUnited States v. Adamson, No. 4:00cr52, 2007 WL 2121923, at *1 (N.D. Fla. July \n23, 2007) (unpublished).  Another way inmates abuse correspondence privileges is \nby using their stamps as a currency in the underground prison economy to buy \ndrugs, sexual favors, and anything else they can bargain for.  See United States v. \nBecker, 196 F. Appโx 762, 763 & n.1 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (noting how \none inmate ran a prison gambling operation where inmates paid him with stamps \nand another inmate used stamps to pay for heroin); United States v. Martin, 178 F. \nAppโx 910, 911 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (stating how an inmate used letters \nwith hidden compartments to smuggle heroin into the prison, which he then gave \nto another inmate in exchange for stamps).  The problems associated with stamps \nincrease when inmates can send their stamps to โcash-for-stampsโ companies that \nwill exchange the stamps for cash at a percentage of the stampsโ face value.  \nInmates can use the cash to purchase goods and services outside prison walls, \nwhich facilitates contraband smuggling and the corruption of prison guards.   \n                                                 \n \nAppellate Procedure 36, a copy of the internet materials cited in this opinion is available at this \nCourtโs Clerkโs Office.] \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 8 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 7 of 48 \n  Recognizing that when inmates abuse their privileges it threatens other \ninmates and the public, the Department has sought to prevent that abuse.  First, it \nhas prohibited three-way calling, which includes any type of call transferring.  Fla. \nAdmin. Code r. 33-602.205(2)(a).  Three-way calling allows inmates to circumvent \nthe regulations the Department has in place to stop them from using prison phones \nto harass the public, arrange contraband smuggling, and conduct other criminal \nactivity.  The Departmentโs regulations restrict inmates to calling no more than ten \npeople on a pre-approved list and require each outgoing call to begin with an \nautomated message informing the recipient that the call is coming from a \nDepartment prison.  Id. r. 33-602.205(2)(a), (g).  The Department also monitors \nand records some inmate calls.  Id. r. 33-602.205(1). \nSecond, the Department does not allow inmates to โsolicit or otherwise \ncommercially advertise for money, goods, or services,โ which includes \nโadvertising for pen-palsโ and โplac[ing] ads soliciting pen-palsโ on social media \nand inmate pen pal websites.  Id. r. 33-210.101(9).  Third, inmates cannot use \nโpostage stamps as currency to pay for products or services.โ  Id. r. 33-\n210.101(22).  Fourth, inmates cannot conduct a business while confined, which \nincludes โany activity in which the inmate engages with the objective of generating \nrevenue or profit while incarcerated.โ  Id. r. 33-602.207(1)โ(2).  That rule exists \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 9 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 8 of 48 \nbecause inmate businesses increase the risk of fraud and burden Department staff \nwith monitoring more mail and phone activity.  Id. r. 33-602.207(2). \n  Just as some inmates abuse their privileges, some also evade or break the \nrules restricting their privileges.  For example, the Departmentโs telephone security \nvendor can detect three-way call attempts by the clicking noise that occurs when a \ncall is transferred, but inmates will blow into the receiver when transferring a call \nto mask that clicking noise.  There are nearly 700,000 three-way call attempts each \nyear in Department prisons, leading officials to believe that inmates would not \nmake so many attempts if some were not succeeding.  Disciplinary reports confirm \nthat some attempts do succeed.  Despite the rule prohibiting pen pal solicitation, \nsome inmates manage to post profiles on pen pal solicitation websites.  Inmates \nalso succeed in exchanging stamps for cash โโ one cash-for-stamps company \ndeposited over $50,000 into inmatesโ accounts over several years.  And as for the \nprohibition against conducting a business, one inmate, a jailhouse lawyer known as \nโH&R Block,โ lived up to his nickname by running a tax filing business where he \nwould file tax returns on behalf of other inmates.  See News in Brief:  Florida, \nPrison Legal News, Apr. 2010, at 50.  Of course, those tax returns were false, and \nthe inmate faced up to 90 years in prison for his scheme.  Id.   \n2.    The Departmentโs Admissible Reading Material Rule \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 10 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 9 of 48 \n  Because some inmates abuse their privileges and break the rules put in place \nto stop that abuse, the Department takes additional steps to help increase prison \nsecurity and public safety.  As Department official Upchurch testified, protecting \nthe public โgoes further than just . . . keeping the inmates inside the fence and not \nallowing them to be out committing the crimes that they commit.โ  Prison security \nchallenges evolve.  Upchurch cited the availability of contraband cell phones, \nwhich give inmates unregulated internet access and have been used in other states \nto orchestrate prison riots and arrange assaults on prison staff.  PLNโs expert \nacknowledged that Department officials must be proactive in addressing security \nproblems.  As Upchurch testified, โact[ing] after the fact [in the prison business] \nrisk[s] someoneโs life.โ  \n  One of the ways the Department tries to stay a step ahead of inmates is to \nscreen all incoming publications for content that might enable them to break prison \nrules.  See Fla. Admin. Code r. 33-501.401(3).  Under the Departmentโs \nAdmissible Reading Material Rule, inmates can โreceive and possess \npublications . . . unless the publication is found to be detrimental to the security, \norder or disciplinary or rehabilitative interests of any institution of the \n[D]epartment . . . or when it is determined that the publication might facilitate \ncriminal activity.โ  Id.  For example, to bolster the Departmentโs ban on inmates \npossessing firearms or other dangerous weapons, id. r. 33-602.203(2), the rule \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 11 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 10 of 48 \nprohibits inmates from receiving publications that โdescribe[ ] procedures for the \nconstruction of or use of weapons,โ id. r. 33-501.401(3)(a).   \n  The Admissible Reading Material Rule applies that same logic to ads for \nprohibited services.  A publication is impounded if it contains ads for three-way \ncalling services, pen pal solicitation services, cash-for-stamps exchange services, \nor for conducting a business, but only โwhere the advertisement is the focus of, \nrather than being incidental to, the publication[,] or the advertising is prominent or \nprevalent throughout the publication.โ  Id. r. 33-501.401(3)(l).  The Department \ncan also impound any publication that โotherwise presents a threat to the security, \norder or rehabilitative objectives of the correctional system or the safety of any \nperson.โ  Id. r. 33-501.401(3)(m).  Once mailroom staff impound an issue of a \nmagazine for violation of the rules, it is withheld from inmates until the \nDepartmentโs Literature Review Committee makes a final decision about whether \nthe issue does violate the Admissible Reading Material Rule.  Id. rr. 33-501.401(5), \n(8), (14)(a).4  Mailroom staff cannot impound all issues of an entire publication in \n                                                 \n  4 The Admissible Reading Material Rule defines โimpoundmentโ as the action taken by \nmailroom staff โto withhold an inmateโs incoming publication . . . pending review of its \nadmissibility by the Literature Review Committee.โ  Fla. Admin. Code r. 33-501.401(2)(b).  \nWhen the Committee upholds an impoundment, that is a โrejectionโ and the issue is considered  \ncontraband.  Id. r. 33-501.401(2)(j).  The difference between an impoundment and rejection is \nimmaterial here, so we use the term โimpoundโ to refer to the Departmentโs decision to withhold \na particular issue from an inmate subscriber. \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 12 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 11 of 48 \nadvance; instead, they must separately review and decide whether each issue of a \npublication violates the Admissible Reading Material Rule.  Id. r. 33-501.401(5).5 \n3.    Prison Legal News and the First Impoundments of It \n  Prison Legal News is a monthly magazine founded in 1990 that reports on \nlegal developments in the criminal justice system and other topics that affect \ninmates.  About 70% of the magazineโs 7,000 nationwide subscribers are inmates.  \nIt has subscribers in all 50 state prison systems and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  \nOnly about 70, or one percent of the 7,000 subscribers, are Florida inmates.  Prison \nLegal News began carrying advertisements in 1996 to cover its publication costs.  \nNot surprisingly, the ads are placed by companies whose target audience is \nprisoners.  Two examples are law firms specializing in prisoner litigation and \nschools offering inmate correspondence courses.  Nothing wrong with that. \n  In 2003 the Department began impounding some Prison Legal News issues \nbased on ad content.  The problem ads included ones for pen pal solicitation, cash-\nfor-stamps exchange services, and three-way calling services.  The ads for pen pal \nsolicitation offered inmates the opportunity to post on the companyโs website a \nprofile with a photo and address, and the public could search for that profile by the \ninmateโs age, race, and other features.  The cash-for-stamps ads gave inmates the \n                                                 \n  5 For example, if the Department decides that the January issue of Prison Legal News \nviolates the Admissible Reading Material Rule, then it impounds that issue.  Fla. Admin. Code \nr. 33-501.401(8).  But when the February issue arrives, mailroom staff must review that latest \nissue to determine whether it complies with the rule.  Id. r. 33-501.401(5).   \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 13 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 12 of 48 \nopportunity to exchange stamps for cash at a percentage of the stampsโ face value.  \nThe three-way calling ads offered discount phone services on collect calls from \ninmates.  The Department determined that those phone services fell under its broad \ndefinition of โthree way callingโ because the companies forwarded or transferred \nthe inmatesโ collect calls to the call recipientโs home phone, cell phone, or blocked \nhome phone number.6  The Department determined that all three types of ads \nviolated Rule (3)(l), but it was especially concerned with the ads for three-way \ncalling because it believed that its telephone security vendor could not trace inmate \ncalls made through the discount phone services.   \n  PLN sued the Department in 2004 to stop the impoundments.  After the \nDepartmentโs telephone vendor gave assurances that it could block three-way call \nattempts, the Department agreed in 2005 not to impound Prison Legal News as \nlong as all the problematic ads were incidental to the overall publication.  Because \nthe Department began allowing inmate subscribers to receive Prison Legal News \nwe rejected PLNโs argument that an injunction was necessary to stop the \n                                                 \n  6 PLN asserts that Prison Legal News has never run ads for three-way calling, but its brief \nand one of its trial exhibits contradict that assertion.  It acknowledges that its magazine contains \nads for discount phone services that allow subscribers to avoid long distance charges by \nassigning the inmate a local number to call, and then transferring that call to the final call \nrecipient (so if a Miami inmate wants to call his mother in Kansas, the Miami inmate can call a \nMiami number and the call is then transferred to Kansas).  That type of call service falls under \nthe Departmentโs definition of three-way calling.  See Fla. Admin. Code r. 33-602.205(2)(a) \n(โInmates shall not make three-way telephone calls nor make calls to numbers on the list which \nare then transferred to other telephone numbers.โ).  And PLNโs trial exhibit shows that almost \nevery issue of Prison Legal News from January 2002 to December 2014 included ads for the \nprohibited services.  One of the columns in that exhibit is labeled โ3-Way Calls.โ   \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 14 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 13 of 48 \nimpoundments, and we affirmed the district courtโs grant of judgment as a matter \nof law to the Department.  See Prison Legal News v. McDonough, 200 F. Appโx \n873, 876โ78 (11th Cir. 2006) (unpublished).   \n4.    The Departmentโs Renewed Impoundments of Prison Legal News \n  That peace was short-lived.  Several changes after 2005 undermined the \ntruce and led to the current conflict.  For one thing, the number and size of rule-\ndefying ads increased after 2005, resulting in their becoming less incidental and \nmore prominent.7  As the ads became more prominent, Department officials \nnoticed an increase in the number of inmates sending stamps to cash-for-stamps \ncompanies.  They also became concerned about a phone technology called Voice \nover Internet Protocol, which makes it harder to detect three-way call attempts by \ntransferring calls over the internet with no noise.  That technology had not been an \nissue in 2005, but in the following years it became more widespread and more of a \nproblem.   \n                                                 \n  7 Although the percentage of the magazine containing ads prohibited by Rule (3)(l) \nincreased only from an average of 9.21% in 2005 to 9.80% in 2009, those naked percentages \ndonโt tell the whole story because the number of full-page and half-page ads increased.  The \nmagazine also grew from 48 pages in 2005 to 64 pages in 2014, which allowed PLN to include \nmore problematic ads without changing the proportion of the magazine devoted to such ads.   \nMore importantly, the record does not stop at 2009.  PLNโs own exhibit shows that the \npercentage of problematic ads increased from 9.80% in 2009 to 15.07% in 2014, the last year of \nthe impoundments that are covered in the record.  That is an increase of more than 50% in the \npercentage of problematic ads in the most recent five-year period for which there is data.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 15 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 14 of 48 \nNew types of ads offering โprisoner conciergeโ and โpeople locatorโ \nservices also began to appear in Prison Legal News after 2005.  Prisoner concierge \ncompanies offer inmates a variety of administrative and financial services.  One \nsuch company, Prisoner Assistant, ran ads offering inmates โaccess to hundreds of \nprofessional services that have never before been available to prisoners,โ including \nmoney orders, online fund transfers, internet purchases and research, website \ndevelopment, cell phone contracts, and Green Dot cards (prepaid debit cards that \ncan be reloaded and used to send money).  That company even provides inmates \nwith an โExecutive Assistant to manage [the inmateโs] file and provide personal \nattention to [the inmateโs] requests,โ and claimed in its ad that โ[i]f it can be done, \nwe will try to do it.โ  According to the Department, prisoner concierge companies \nthreaten prison security and public safety by, among other things, making it easier \nfor inmates to create an alternate identity that conceals their inmate status from \npeople on the outside, enabling them to violate prison rules and commit crimes.   \nPeople locator companies are just that.  One such company placed ads \nclaiming that it can find โjust about anyoneโ including โhard to find people [and] \nunlisted numbers and address[es].โ  That company has a database of 1.2 billion \nrecords and provides inmates with a personโs date of birth, email address, any \nunlisted telephone numbers, and social security number.  With reason, the \nDepartment fears that inmates will use people locator services to perpetrate scams \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 16 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 15 of 48 \nor allow inmates to find and harm judges, jurors, witnesses, or anyone else the \ninmate may want to harass or harm.   \nAll of those developments between 2005 and 2009 โ the increasing number \nand size of the rule-defying ads, the growth of internet-based phone technology, \nand the appearance of prisoner concierge and people locator ads โ led the \nDepartment to begin impounding Prison Legal News again in September 2009.8  \nThe Department decided that the ads for three-way calling services, pen pal \nsolicitation services, and cash-for-stamps exchange services violated Rule (3)(l).  It \nalso determined that the ads for prisoner concierge and people locator services \nviolated Rule (3)(m), the provision prohibiting any publication that โpresents a \nthreat to the security, order or rehabilitative objectives of the correctional system or \nthe safety of any person.โ  Id. r. 33-501.401(3)(m).  The Department impounds \n                                                 \n  8 The Department amended Rule (3)(l) in June 2009.  The earlier version provided that a \npublication would not be impounded as long as the ads were โmerely incidental to, rather than \nbeing the focus of, the publication.โ  The amendment provided that a magazine could also be \nimpounded if the rule-defying ad was โprominent or prevalent throughout the publication.โ  PLN \ncontended at trial that the Department amended the rule to keep Prison Legal News out of \nFlorida prisons, but the district court rejected that contention as conjecture and found that the \nDepartment amended Rule (3)(l) to make it clearer and to address its new security concerns.  \nPLN makes only a cursory attempt to raise that contention here, offering no supporting authority, \nwhich means that it is abandoned.  See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., 739 F.3d 678, 681 \n(11th Cir. 2014) (โWe have long held that an appellant abandons a claim when he . . . raises it in \na perfunctory manner without supporting arguments and authority.โ).  Its assertion that the \nโprominent or prevalentโ language is too vague is not properly before us because the district \ncourt denied PLNโs motion to amend its complaint to include a void-for-vagueness claim, and \nPLN did not appeal that ruling.  See Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S. Ct. 2868, 2877 \n(1976) (โIt is the general rule, of course, that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue \nnot passed upon below.โ). \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 17 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 16 of 48 \nother publications that violate those rules, but it is the only corrections department \nin the country that impounds Prison Legal News based on its ad content.    \n5.    The Departmentโs Failure to Provide Notice to PLN \nAt the time of trial in January 2015, the Department had impounded every \nissue of Prison Legal News since September 2009, a total of 64 issues (the \nmagazine has 12 issues per year).  The Admissible Reading Material Rule requires \nthe Department to send to all publishers a notice form listing the โspecific reasonsโ \nfor an impoundment.  Fla. Admin. Code r. 33-501.401(8)(b).  Despite that rule, the \nDepartment did not send PLN a notice form for 26 out of the 62 monthly issues it \nimpounded between November 2009 and December 2014, which means that PLN \ndid not receive a notice form for 42% of the issues impounded during that time \nspan.  That number rises to 87% when defective notice forms that did not list the \nreasons for the impoundment are considered.   \nWhen PLN did receive a notice form for an impounded issue, it appealed the \nimpoundment decision to the Departmentโs Literature Review Committee, which \nmakes the final decision whether an issue violates the Admissible Reading \nMaterial Rule.  See id. rr. 33-501.401(14)(a), (15)(a).  Those appeals were \nunsuccessful, so PLN sued the Department in November 2011 to stop the \nimpoundments.   \nB.  Procedural History \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 18 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 17 of 48 \n  PLN brought two claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the Department \nSecretary in her official capacity.  First, it claimed that Rules (3)(l) and (3)(m), as \napplied to Prison Legal News, violate the First Amendment.  Second, it claimed \nthat the Departmentโs failure to provide PLN with proper notice for each \nimpounded monthly issue violated its right to procedural due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  PLN sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the \nDepartment.   \n  After a bench trial, the district court ruled against PLN on the First \nAmendment claim and for it on the Fourteenth Amendment claim.  The court \nentered an injunction requiring the Department to provide PLN with notice each \ntime it impounded a monthly issue of the magazine and the reason for the \nimpoundment.  The Department appeals the courtโs judgment that it violated \nPLNโs due process rights.  PLN cross-appeals the courtโs judgment that the \nimpoundments of Prison Legal News do not violate the First Amendment.9        \nII.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW \n                                                 \n  9 PLN also publishes a book called the Prisonerโs Guerilla Handbook and sends \ninformation packets about its publications to inmates.  The Department impounded those \npublications, and PLN claimed in its amended complaint that impounding them also violated its \nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  (PLN claimed that the impoundment of all of its \npublications violated its constitutional rights; its amended complaint did not contain separate \nclaims for each publication).  Although PLNโs brief refers to its โpublications,โ it mentions the \nhandbook and information packets by name only once in its 82-page initial brief.  As a result, \nPLN has abandoned any separate challenge to those publications.  See Sapuppo, 739 F.3d at 681.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 19 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 18 of 48 \n  After a bench trial, we review de novo the district courtโs legal conclusions \nand we review its fact findings for clear error.  Proudfoot Consulting Co. v. \nGordon, 576 F.3d 1223, 1230 (11th Cir. 2009).  โWe review the decision to grant \nan injunction and the scope of the injunction for abuse of discretion.โ  Angel Flight \nof Ga., Inc. v. Angel Flight Am., Inc., 522 F.3d 1200, 1208 (11th Cir. 2008). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  First Amendment Claim \n  PLN contends that the Departmentโs impoundments of Prison Legal News \nviolate its First Amendment right of access to its inmate subscribers.  The parties \nagree that the deferential standard established by the Supreme Court in Turner v. \nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S. Ct. 2254 (1987), governs PLNโs First Amendment \nchallenge to the impoundments.  PLN has received a helping hand from sixteen \nlaw professors acting as amici curiae who claim an โinterest in seeing that First \nAmendment doctrine develops in a way that promotes rather than censors free \nspeech.โ  Br. of Amici Curiae at 1.  The amici contend that we should give prison \nmanagement decisions decreased deference under the Turner standard in light of \nthe Supreme Courtโs recent First Amendment decisions, mostly in other contexts. \n  On the First Amendment issue we begin by explaining the Turner standard, \nwhich requires deference to prison officialsโ decisions.  We then address the \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 20 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 19 of 48 \namiciโs argument for diminished deference.  And then we will discuss the \napplication of the First Amendment to the impoundments. \n1.    The Turner Standard \n  โPrison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the \nprotections of the Constitution.โ  Turner, 482 U.S. at 84, 107 S. Ct. at 2259.  \nInmates retain some constitutional rights in prison, id., and publishers like PLN \nhave a First Amendment right of access to their inmate subscribers, Thornburgh v. \nAbbott, 490 U.S. 401, 408, 109 S. Ct. 1874, 1879 (1989).   \n  But that right is limited.  See Lawson v. Singletary, 85 F.3d 502, 509 (11th \nCir. 1996) (noting the โmore limited nature of . . . First Amendment rightsโ in the \npenal context).  โRunning a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that \nrequires expertise, planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are \npeculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of \ngovernment.โ  Turner, 482 U.S. at 84โ85, 107 S. Ct. at 2259.  Those branches are \nresponsible for prison administration, which means that โseparation of powers \nconcerns counsel a policy of judicial restraintโ and deference to prison officialsโ \nmanagement decisions.  Id. at 85, 107 S. Ct. at 2259.  And โ[w]here a state penal \nsystem is involved, federal courts have . . . additional reason to accord deference to \nthe appropriate prison authorities.โ  Id.  To balance judicial deference with โthe \nneed to protect constitutional rights,โ the Turner Court held that a prison regulation \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 21 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 20 of 48 \naffecting constitutional rights is valid as long as โit is reasonably related to \nlegitimate penological interests.โ  Id. at 85, 89, 107 S. Ct. at 2259, 2261.  The \nDepartment and PLN agree that the Turner standard controls here.   \n  The Department must show โmore than a formalistic logical connection \nbetween [the impoundments of Prison Legal News] and a penological objective.โ  \nBeard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 535, 126 S. Ct. 2572, 2581 (2006) (plurality \nopinion).  But that does not mean that this Court sits as a super-warden to second-\nguess the decisions of the real wardens.  See Turner, 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S. Ct. at \n2262 (rejecting the view that courts should be the โprimary arbiters of what \nconstitutes the best solution to every administrative problemโ).  Instead, under \nTurner we owe โwide-rangingโ and โsubstantialโ deference to the decisions of \nprison administrators because of the โcomplexity of prison management, the fact \nthat responsibility therefor is necessarily vested in prison officials, and the fact that \ncourts are ill-equipped to deal with such problems.โ  Al-Amin v. Smith, 511 F.3d \n1317, 1328 (11th Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted); see also Pope v. \nHightower, 101 F.3d 1382, 1384 n.2 (11th Cir. 1996) (โFederal courts must \nscrupulously respect the limits on their role by not thrusting themselves into prison \nadministration; prison administrators must be permitted to exercise wide discretion \nwithin the bounds of constitutional requirements.โ).  The Supreme Court has \nreaffirmed that point time and time again.  See, e.g., Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 22 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 21 of 48 \n126, 132, 123 S. Ct. 2162, 2167 (2003) (โWe must accord substantial deference to \nthe professional judgment of prison administrators, who bear a significant \nresponsibility for defining the legitimate goals of a corrections system and for \ndetermining the most appropriate means to accomplish them.โ); Shaw v. Murphy, \n532 U.S. 223, 229, 121 S. Ct. 1475, 1479 (2001) (โ[W]e generally have deferred to \nthe judgments of prison officials in upholding [prison] regulations against \nconstitutional challenge.โ); Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 408, 109 S. Ct. at 1879 \n(โ[T]his Court has afforded considerable deference to the determinations of prison \nadministrators who, in the interest of security, regulate the relations between \nprisoners and the outside world.โ). \n2.    The Amiciโs Diminished Deference Argument \n  In spite of all of those Supreme Court decisions requiring us to grant \nsubstantial deference to the decisions of prison officials, the amici argue that we \nshould not.  Claiming clairvoyance, they predict the Supreme Court will overrule \nits precedents, and they urge us to go ahead and effectively do that ourselves.  See \nBr. of Amici Curiae at 2 (โModern First Amendment jurisprudence trends toward \nmore protections for speech rights, a direction that should inform this Courtโs \nanalysis.โ).  The amici discern a trend from several recent Supreme Court \ndecisions, nearly all of which have nothing to do with Turner or challenges to \nprison regulations, to argue that increased protection of free speech requires \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 23 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 22 of 48 \ndecreased deference under Turner.  See, e.g., United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. \n709, 713โ15, 729โ30, 132 S. Ct. 2537, 2542โ43, 2551 (2012) (holding that the \nStolen Valor Act violated the First Amendment); Brown v.

In any event, our duty is to \nfollow Supreme Court decisions, not to use them to map trends and plot \ntrajectories.   \nThe only Court that can properly cut back on Supreme Court decisions is the \nSupreme Court itself.  See Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236, 252โ53, 118 S. Ct. \n1969, 1978 (1998) (โOur decisions remain binding precedent until we see fit to \nreconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about \ntheir continuing vitality.โ); State Oil Co. v.

See Beard, 548 \nU.S. at 524โ25, 535, 126 S. Ct. at 2575โ76, 2581โ82 (plurality opinion) (rejecting \na First Amendment challenge to a prison rule and stating that the court of appeals \nerred by offering โno apparent deference to the deputy prison superintendentโs \nprofessional judgmentโ);10 see also Davila v. Gladden, 777 F.3d 1198, 1212โ13 \n                                                 \n  10 Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concurred in the judgment and agreed with \nthe plurality that โ[j]udicial scrutiny of prison regulations is an endeavor fraught with peril.โ  \nBeard, 548 U.S. at 536, 126 S. Ct. at 2582 (Thomas, J., concurring).  The amici attempt to \ndistinguish Beard, which involved a challenge to a prison policy designed to motivate better \nbehavior by barring certain inmates from receiving publications.  Id. at 524โ25, 126 S. Ct. at \n2575โ76 (plurality opinion).  They argue that the Beard case was exceptional because it involved \nmaximum security inmates and that the prisonโs regulations were motivated by its rehabilitative \ngoals.  Neither of those distinctions matter.  What matters is that the Beard Court did not water \ndown Turner.  Id. at 528โ33, 126 S. Ct. at 2577โ80 (plurality opinion).  The amiciโs argument \nthat the prison policy at issue in Beard still allowed inmates to receive legal correspondence, id. \nat 526, 126 S. Ct. at 2576 (plurality opinion), and that Prison Legal News is a form of legal \ncorrespondence fails on its essential premise because it is not.  We agree with the definition in \nthe Florida Administrative Code that legal mail is โmail to and fromโ courts, attorneys, public \ndefenders, legal aid organizations, agency clerks, and government attorneys.  Fla. Admin. \nCode r. 33.210.102(1)โ(2).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 25 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 24 of 48 \n(11th Cir. 2015) (addressing the Turner standard without any hint that it should be \napplied with decreased deference in light of recent Supreme Court decisions). \nThe Beard decision confirms that whatever the Supreme Court has done in \nother First Amendment cases, it has not adopted a damn-the-deference, full-speed-\nahead approach to First Amendment rights within prison walls.  As a result, we \ncategorically reject the amiciโs argument that we should leap-frog ahead of the \nSupreme Court in this area.  We follow Supreme Court decisions, here as \nelsewhere, instead of plotting ways around them.11 \nWith the proper level of deference in mind, we will turn now to applying the \nTurner standard to determine whether the impoundments of Prison Legal News \nunder its Rules (3)(l) and (3)(m) violate the First Amendment. \n3.    Application of the Turner Standard \n  The Turner standard requires the Department to show that its impoundments \nof Prison Legal News are content neutral, Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 415, 109 S. Ct. \nat 1882, and โreasonably related to legitimate penological interests,โ Turner, 482 \nU.S. at 89, 107 S. Ct. at 2261.  The impoundments are content neutral because they \nare based โsolely on . . . [the magazineโs] potential implications for prison \nsecurity.โ  Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 415โ16, 109 S. Ct. at 1883.  And PLN does not \n                                                 \n11 While we categorically reject the contention and supporting arguments of the amici, we \ndo not mean to be unfair.  The professorsโ brief does have good grammar, sound syntax, and \ncorrect citation form. \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 26 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 25 of 48 \ndispute that the Departmentโs asserted interests for the impoundments โ prison \nsecurity and public safety โ are legitimate.  See Perry v. Secโy, Fla. Depโt of \nCorr., 664 F.3d 1359, 1366 (11th Cir. 2011) (โ[P]rotecting the public and ensuring \ninternal prison security are legitimate penological objectives.โ).  Those interests \nare not only legitimate, but paramount.  See Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 415, 109 \nS. Ct. at 1882 (โ[P]rotecting prison security . . . is central to all other corrections \ngoals.โ) (quotation marks omitted).  \n  That leaves the issue of whether the Departmentโs impoundments of Prison \nLegal News are โreasonably relatedโ to prison security and public safety.  Turner, \n482 U.S. at 89, 107 S. Ct. at 2261.  The Turner Court established four factors to \ndetermine the reasonableness of prison regulations:  (1) whether there is a โvalid, \nrational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental \ninterest put forward to justify itโ; (2) whether the publisher has alternative means \nto exercise its right of access to its inmate subscribers; (3) what โimpact \naccommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other \ninmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generallyโ; and (4) whether PLN \nโcan point to . . . alternative[s] that fully accommodate[ ] [its] rights at de minimis \ncost to valid penological interests.โ  Id. at 89โ91, 107 S. Ct. at 2262 (quotation \nmarks omitted).  \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 27 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 26 of 48 \n  PLN contends that the Departmentโs impoundments of Prison Legal News \nunder Rules 3(l) and 3(m) fail all four factors and therefore amount to \nunconstitutional censorship.  We disagree.   \na.    The First Turner Factor:  The Existence of a Rational Connection \n  The first Turner factor requires the Department to show that there is a \nโrational connectionโ between its decision to impound Prison Legal News and its \ninterests in prison security and public safety.  Id. at 89, 107 S. Ct. at 2262.  The \nDepartmentโs position is that limiting inmatesโ exposure to the ads in Prison Legal \nNews will reduce the risk that inmates will engage in behavior that endangers other \ninmates, guards, and the public.  PLNโs position is that there is no rational \nconnection because there is no evidence that ads in its magazine have ever caused \na security breach.  PLNโs argument demands too much. \n   The Turner standard does not require the Department to present evidence of \nan actual security breach to satisfy the first factor.  Instead, the Supreme Court \nrecognized that prison officials must be able to โanticipate security problems \nand . . . adopt innovative solutionsโ to those problems to manage a prison \neffectively.  Id. (emphasis added).  We have rejected the โmisconceptionโ that \nprison officials are โrequired to adduce specific evidence of a causal link between \n[a prison policy] and actual incidents of violence (or some other actual threat to \nsecurity).โ  Lawson, 85 F.3d at 513 n.15.  โRequiring proof of such a correlation \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 28 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 27 of 48 \nconstitutes insufficient deference to the judgment of the prison authorities with \nrespect to security needs.โ  Id.  Other circuits agree.  See, e.g., Simpson v. County \nof Cape Girardeau, 879 F.3d 273, 280 (8th Cir. 2018) (โCape Girardeau may seek \nto prevent harm that has yet to occur and, as a result, is not required to provide \nevidence of previous incidents of contraband reaching inmates through the mail in \norder to adopt a postcard-only incoming mail regulation.โ); Murchison v. Rogers, \n779 F.3d 882, 890 (8th Cir. 2015) (stating that Turner โdoes not require actual \nproof that a legitimate interest will be furthered by the challenged policyโ and that \nโevidence short of an actual incident satisfiesโ the first factor) (quotation marks \nomitted); Singer v. Raemisch, 593 F.3d 529, 536 (7th Cir. 2010) (โThe question is \nnot whether [a game banned by the prison] has led to gang behavior in the past; the \nprison officials concede that it has not.  The question is whether the prison officials \nare rational in their belief that, if left unchecked, [the game] could lead to gang \nbehavior among inmates and undermine prison security in the future.โ); Cal. First \nAmend. Coal. v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 868, 882 (9th Cir. 2002) (stating that prison \nofficials โmust at a minimum supply some evidence that . . . potential problems are \nreal, not imagined,โ but affirming that โprison officials may pass regulations in \nanticipation of security problemsโ). \n  In Perry, a case involving a First Amendment challenge to a Department \nregulation prohibiting pen pal solicitation, we did not require that prison officials \n27 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 29 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 28 of 48 \nproduce evidence of a past incident to satisfy the first Turner factor.  See Perry, \n664 F.3d at 1362, 1366.  We held that the Department had established a rational \nconnection between that regulation and its security and safety interests through the \ntestimony of James Upchurch, id. at 1366, the same prison official the Department \nrelied on in the present case.  He testified in Perry that โwhen inmates only receive \npen pals through personal associates and not pen pal companies . . . the possibility \nof the inmate defrauding the pen pal is greatly reduced.โ  Id. (emphasis added).  \nWe did not demand any evidence that inmatesโ solicitation of pen pals had \npreviously caused a security breach.  Id.     \n  There is plenty of evidence that preventing inmates from viewing prominent \nor prevalent ads for prohibited services will reduce the possibility that they will use \nthose services.12  The ads not only make the prohibited services available to \n                                                 \n  12 PLN asserts that the Department is judicially estopped from arguing that the \nproblematic ads present a security threat because the Department allegedly took the position in \nthe earlier litigation that the same types of ads do not present such a threat.  See Robinson v. \nTyson Foods, Inc., 595 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2010) (โ[J]udicial estoppel is designed to \nprevent a party from asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that is [clearly] inconsistent with a \nclaim taken by the party in a previous preceding.โ) (quotation marks omitted).  Not so.  PLNโs \ncurrent position is not clearly inconsistent with its earlier position because the Department never \nrepresented that the ads present no security threat.  Instead, its position was that the problematic \nads were not a security threat as long as they remained incidental in terms of their size and \nnumber.  See McDonough, 200 F. Appโx at 878 (stating that we did not expect the Department to \nโresume the practice of impounding publications based on incidental advertisementsโ) (emphasis \nadded).  But after 2005 the ads became more prominent (the size and number of the ads \nincreased), ads for prisoner concierge and people locator services appeared, and phone \ntechnology changed.  In view of those changes, the Departmentโs decision to renew \nimpoundment was not an attempt to โplay[ ] fast and loose with [this Court] to suit the \nexigencies of self interest.โ  In re Coastal Plains, Inc., 179 F.3d 197, 205 (5th Cir. 1999) \n(quotation marks omitted).  As a result, the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 30 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 29 of 48 \ninmates but also appear along with articles about inmate phone scams, the role of \nGreen Dot cards in prison gang extortion schemes, and the nationwide problem \nwith smuggling contraband like drugs and cell phones into prisons.  An inmate \nreading Prison Legal News not only reads articles about inmates putting the \nprohibited services to dangerous use, but also sees ads that enable him to obtain \nthose same prohibited services.  As PLNโs expert acknowledged, โ[j]ust because \nthere [are] rule[s] [prohibiting use of those services] is no guarantee that everybody \nwill abide by the rule[s].โ  See Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526, 104 S. Ct. \n3194, 3200 (1984) (โInmates have necessarily shown a lapse in ability to control \nand conform their behavior to the legitimate standards of society by the normal \nimpulses of self-restraint; they have shown an inability to regulate their conduct in \na way that reflects either a respect for law or an appreciation of the rights of \nothers.โ).  Given that common-sense proposition, itโs no surprise that Upchurch, \nthe Departmentโs expert, agreed with the district courtโs statement that the ads \nโcreate the possibility, [the] real possibilityโ of inmates doing an end run around \nprison rules.  He explained how that possibility exists for each type of ad at issue in \n                                                 \n \nPLNโs judicial estoppel argument.  And because judicial estoppel does not apply here, we need \nnot decide the extent to which it can be applied against a state if at all.  See Heckler v. Cmty. \nHealth Servs. of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 60โ61, 104 S. Ct. 2218, 2224 (1984) (noting \nthe uncertainty on that point). \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 31 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 30 of 48 \nthis case:  (1) three-way calling ads, (2) pen pal solicitation ads, (3) cash-for-\nstamps exchange ads, and (4) prisoner concierge and people locator ads.13 \ni.    Three-Way Calling Ads \n  The Department is concerned with ads for three-way calling because that \nservice undermines its ability to determine a call recipientโs identity and location.  \nFor instance, the December 2009 issue of Prison Legal News featured an ad from a \ncompany that allowed inmates to make a call to a local number, which could then \nbe forwarded to up to three different numbers.  Those types of three-way calling \nservices, combined with the growth of internet-based phone technology, make it \neasier for inmates to call people outside their approved list.  Although two phone \ncompanies that advertise in Prison Legal News provide the Departmentโs telephone \nvendor with the final call recipientโs number and address, other companies that \nadvertise in the magazine have not done so.  Given that Department inmates make \n700,000 three-way call attempts each year โ and some of those attempts succeed \nโ the Departmentโs effort to reduce that number by curtailing inmatesโ exposure \nto ads for that service is rational.  See Prison Legal News v. Livingston, 683 F.3d \n                                                 \n  13 Rule (3)(l) allows the Department to impound publications that contain prominent or \nprevalent ads for โ[c]onducting a business or profession while incarcerated.โ  Fla. Admin. Code \nr. 33-501.401(3)(l).  PLN asserts that the district court failed to analyze the rational connection \nbetween an ad for that kind of service and the Departmentโs penological interests, but neither \nparty discusses those particular ads in its briefs.  In any event, Upchurch testified that all the ads \ncreate the possibility that inmates will circumvent prison rules, which is enough to establish a \nrational connection.  See Perry, 664 F.3d at 1366. \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 32 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 31 of 48 \n201, 218 (5th Cir. 2012) (holding that it was reasonable for prison officials to \nconclude that removing a book โdescribing racial tensions in the prison context โ \nas opposed to racial tensions more generally โโ would make prison violence less \nlikely). \n  PLN argues that the Departmentโs fears about three-way calling ads are \noverblown.  It points out that the Department allows inmates to call cell phones, \neven though cell phones present just as much of a security threat as three-way \ncalling because the Department cannot identify a cell phone call recipientโs \nlocation.  (Identifying a call recipientโs location helps the Department detect and \nstop criminal activity conducted over the phones).  According to PLN, that alleged \nloophole undermines the rational connection.  See Woodford, 299 F.3d at 881 \n(noting that a prison policy involved in that case contained โloopholes that \nundermine[d] its rationalityโ).  But the Department explained why it allows \ninmates to call cell phones despite the security problems they present.  Given the \ndecline in landline use, prohibiting inmates from calling cell phones would curtail \ntheir ability to keep in touch with family and friends, which can be critical for \nrehabilitation.  The Department also has several rules addressing the unique \nsecurity problems that cell phones create:  the cell phone must be contracted \nthrough a company licensed with the Federal Communications Commission; calls \nto pre-paid or pay-as-you-go phones are prohibited; and the cell phone owner must \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 33 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 32 of 48 \nprovide a physical billing address.  See Fla. Admin. Code r. 33-602.205(2)(a).  \nBecause the Department has good reason for not banning all calls to cell phones, \nwhile also limiting three-way calls, PLNโs argument that the restriction on ads for \nthree-way calls has no rational connection to security and safety interests is \nunpersuasive. \nii.  Pen Pal Solicitation Ads \n  Upchurchโs testimony shows why the Departmentโs concerns with pen pal \nsolicitation ads are rationally connected to its security and safety interests.  He \ndescribed how those services give inmates opportunities to prey on the public by  \nallowing them to write people they have no connection with, which heightens the \nrisk of fraud.  In his experience, giving inmates the opportunity to solicit pen pals \nresulted in the exploitation of kind-hearted but gullible people.  Inmates have been \nknown to borrow or buy from each other pen pal letters that have proven effective \nin scamming victims.  Upchurch explained that such scams are hard to investigate \nbecause victims are often embarrassed and prosecutors prefer to focus on criminals \non the streets, not those already in prison.  And despite the Departmentโs rule \nprohibiting pen pal solicitation, inmates succeed in posting online profiles with the \nsame companies that advertise in Prison Legal News.  Given that evidence, the \nDepartmentโs belief that reducing inmatesโ exposure to the ads will help ensure \ncompliance with the prohibition on pen pal solicitation is rational.   \n32 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 34 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 33 of 48 \niii.  Cash-for-Stamps Ads \n  Turning to cash-for-stamps ads, Upchurch testified that the large number and \nsize of those ads in Prison Legal News makes inmates โaware of the opportunity \n[to break prison rules] where they otherwise might not be.โ  That is enough to \nestablish a rational connection between the ads and the Departmentโs penological \ninterests.  See McCorkle v. Johnson, 881 F.2d 993, 995โ96 (11th Cir. 1989) \n(upholding a prisonโs ban on a satanic bible based on prison officialsโ testimony \nthat allowing access to it would โonly encourageโ violent behavior because of the \nbookโs teachings about revenge and disobedience).  Upchurch also testified that the \nlarge number of cash-for-stamps ads in each issue of Prison Legal News shows that \nthe companies are making money off their ads, which evidences that the ads are \ncausing inmates to use those services.14  The record supports his suspicion, because \nit shows that over a period of several years a cash-for-stamps exchange company \ndeposited more than $50,000 into the accounts of Florida inmates.  \niv.  Prisoner Concierge and People Locator Ads \n                                                 \n  14 PLN argues that if the Department is worried about the security problems stamps \npresent, then it should just prohibit inmates from keeping stamps altogether instead of allowing \nthem to keep up to 40 stamps at a time.  But the Department explained that it allows inmates to \nkeep some stamps so that they can mail letters to family and friends, and switching to a stamp-\nless system would be costly and impractical.  The Department does inspect all outgoing mail, but \nstamps are easily hidden and the Department processes 50,000 pieces of mail each day.  \nAllowing inmates to have stamps for the legitimate purpose of sending mail to family and \nfriends, while banning ads that tempt them to use stamps for illegitimate purposes, is rational.   \n33 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 35 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 34 of 48 \n  Finally, Upchurch testified about why ads for prisoner concierge and people \nlocator services threaten prison security and public safety.  The problem with \nprisoner concierge companies is that their services allow inmates to conceal their \ntrue identities from the public.  Upchurch recounted how some prisoner concierge \ncompanies offer photo editing services, which an inmate could use to transform an \nofficial prison photo depicting him in a prison uniform into a fake vacation photo \ndepicting him in a bathing suit at the beach.  The inmate could then use that fake \nphoto to misrepresent himself to the public, which facilitates fraud.  In that and \nother ways, those ads undermine the Departmentโs ability to control inmatesโ \ncontact with the public.   \n  The case against ads for people locator services is even more obvious.  As \nUpchurch put it, inmates could use people locator services to โlocate judges, \nlawyers, prosecutors, former witnesses, families of victims,โ or anyone else โthey \nwould have an axe to grind with.โ  He cited the example of a Department inmate \nwho threatened a judge, as well as the example of a prison gang member who after \nhe was released murdered the chief of the Colorado Department of Corrections.  \nAs the district court aptly noted, โit doesnโt require a JD, or a federal judgeshipโ to \nsee why people locator services pose a threat.      \nv.   The โFocus ofโ or โProminent or Prevalentโ Requirement \n34 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 36 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 35 of 48 \n  It is true that Rule (3)(l) prohibits only those publications where the rule-\ndefying ads are either the โfocus ofโ the publication or are โprominent or \nprevalentโ throughout it.  Fla. Admin. Code r. 33-501.401(3)(l).  PLN asserts that \nif the ads are as dangerous as the Department makes them out to be, then the \nDepartment should impound a publication with even one suspect ad, which it could \ndo.  See Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 404โ05 & n.5, 418โ19, 109 S. Ct. at 1877 & n.5, \n1884โ85 (upholding the facial validity of a prison regulation that allowed a warden \nto reject a publication based on a single prohibited feature).  Upchurch testified \nthat the Department adopted the โprominent or prevalentโ standard to \nโmoderate[ ]โ the โfocus ofโ requirement in Rule 3(l) and provide โsome leewayโ \nto Prison Legal News and other publications with questionable ads.15  It did so \neven though that more moderate approach amounted to โgiv[ing] in on some \nsecurity concerns.โ  PLN has not convinced us that moderation in pursuit of safety \nis a constitutional vice.  We do not condemn the Department for permitting more  \nexpression than it was required to.16 \nvi.   Summary of the First Turner Factor \n                                                 \n15 Except, for example, publications containing even a single depiction of, or description \nabout, how to manufacture drugs or construct a weapon.  See Fla. Admin. Code r. 33-\n501.401(3)(a), (c). \n  16 PLN, inconsistently, also argues that the Department cannot prohibit a large amount of \nprotected speech based on a few suspect ads.  But the Thornburgh Court upheld the facial \nvalidity of regulations doing just that.  See 490 U.S. at 404โ05 & n.5, 418โ19, 109 S. Ct. at 1877 \n& n.5, 1884โ85.   \n35 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 37 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 36 of 48 \n  The record shows that the Departmentโs decision to limit inmatesโ exposure \nto the ads is not โso remoteโ from the Departmentโs security and safety interests \nโas to render the . . . [impoundments] arbitrary or irrational.โ  Pope, 101 F.3d at \n1385.  Itโs not remote at all.  There is a rational connection between its \nimpoundments of Prison Legal News based on the magazineโs ad content and \nprison security and public safety interests.    \nb.    The Second Turner Factor:  Alternative Means \n  The second Turner factor is โwhether there are alternative meansโ available \nto PLN to exercise its right of access to its inmate subscribers.  See Turner, 482 \nU.S. at 90, 107 S. Ct. at 2262.  PLN contends that this factor weighs in its favor \nbecause the district court found that PLN could not afford to publish its magazine \nwithout advertising revenue, and publishing a separate Florida-only version \nwithout the rule-defying ads would be cost prohibitive.  With those options off the \ntable, PLN argues, the impoundments amount to a blanket ban on its magazine \nbecause it has no other way to send Prison Legal News to inmate subscribers in \nFlorida.    \n  It is a close call, but we reject PLNโs argument that no alternative means \nexist here.  The Supreme Court has made clear that prisons do not have to provide \nexact, one-for-one substitutes to provide alternative means.  See id. at 92, 107 S. \nCt. at 2263 (holding that a prison regulation satisfied this factor because it did not \n36 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 38 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 37 of 48 \nโdeprive prisoners of all means of expression,โ and instead barred โcommunication \nonly with a limited class of other people with whom prison officials have particular \ncause to be concernedโ).  Even if PLN cannot deliver Prison Legal News to its \ninmate subscribers in Florida, this factor is satisfied as long as there is some other \nway to exercise its right of access to inmates.  See Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 417โ\n18, 109 S. Ct. at 1884 (stating that the second factor was satisfied even though \ninmates could not attend a particular Muslim religious ceremony because they \ncould โparticipate in other Muslim religious ceremoniesโ) (citing OโLone v. Estate \nof Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 107 S. Ct. 2400 (1987)). \n  Although PLN cannot publish its magazine without ads and cannot afford to \npublish a Florida-only version, it can send its other publications to Florida inmates.  \nFor example, PLN publishes a handbook called the Prisonersโ Guerrilla Handbook, \nwhich describes various educational programs for prisoners.  The Department does \nnot impound that handbook.  PLN also distributes to inmates a variety of books \nabout daily life in prison, incarceration in the United States, and related topics.  See \nLivingston, 683 F.3d at 209โ10.  There is no indication that those books are \nimpounded.  \nPLNโs argument focuses solely on its ability to send Prison Legal News to \nFlorida inmates, but โadequate alternativesโ can exist even โwhere prisoners [are] \ncut off from unique and irreplaceable activities.โ  Id. at 219; see also id. at 209, \n37 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 39 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 38 of 48 \n218โ19 (concluding that the second factor favored the corrections department, \nwhich had banned five of PLNโs books in Texas prisons, because the โalternatives \nleft open to PLN to communicate its intended message to [the inmates were] \nextensive,โ as it could distribute โcountless other booksโ to inmates).  Sending \nalternate publications might not be โidealโ for PLN, but Turner does not demand \nthe ideal.  See Yang v. Mo. Depโt of Corr., 833 F.3d 890, 894โ95 (8th Cir. 2016) \n(upholding a prison regulation that prohibited a Chinese inmate from \ncorresponding in Chinese with his Chinese-speaking relatives in China, who did \nnot speak English, because the inmate could still correspond in English, receive \nvisitors, and make domestic and international calls).  The second factor favors the \nDepartment or, perhaps more accurately, does not disfavor the Department.   \nc.    The Third Turner Factor:  Impact of Accommodating the Asserted Right \n  The โthird consideration is the impact [that] accommodation of the asserted \nconstitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of \nprison resources generally.โ  Turner, 482 U.S. at 90, 107 S. Ct. at 2262.   \n  As weโve explained, the Department impounded every monthly issue of \nPrison Legal News during the five-year period for which there is evidence in the \nrecord because the magazineโs ads give inmates the opportunity to use prohibited \nservices, which creates security problems.  It follows that if the Department admits \nan issue of the magazine, it would have to allocate more time, money, and \n38 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 40 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 39 of 48 \npersonnel in an attempt to detect and prevent security problems engendered by the \nads in the magazines.  See Simpson, 879 F.3d at 281 (โRequiring Cape Girardeau \nto abandon the postcard-only policy would force the jail to dedicate more time and \nresources to searching the mail, which would detract from the officersโ other duties \nrelated to security and inmate welfare.โ); Woods, 652 F.3d at 750 (stating that a \nban on pen pal websites passed the third Turner factor because pen pal scams \nโunduly distract[ed] prison officials from the day-to-day affairs they must manage \nin order to maintain a safe atmosphere for everyone in the prison environmentโ).  \nPLNโs subscribers could share copies of the magazine and its ads with non-\nsubscribing inmates or spread information by word-of-mouth about the companies \noffering the prohibited services.  See Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 412, 109 S. Ct. at \n1881 (stating that periodicals โreasonably may be expected to circulate among \nprisoners, with the concomitant potential for coordinated disruptive conductโ).  As \nUpchurch testified, that โripple effectโ increases the burden on Department staff.  \nSee Turner, 482 U.S. at 90, 107 S. Ct. at 2262 (โWhen accommodation of an \nasserted right will have a significant ripple effect on fellow inmates or on prison \nstaff, courts should be particularly deferential to the informed discretion of \ncorrections officials.โ) (quotation marks omitted).  The third factor favors the \nDepartment.   \nd.    The Fourth Turner Factor:  Exaggerated Response \n39 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 41 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 40 of 48 \n  The final Turner factor requires us to consider whether the impoundments of \nPrison Legal News are โan exaggerated response to prison concerns.โ  Id. \n(quotation marks omitted).  The โexistence of obvious, easy alternatives may be \nevidence that the regulation . . . is an exaggerated responseโ to a problem, while \nthe โabsence of ready alternatives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison \nregulation.โ  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  PLN argues that the Departmentโs \ndecision to impound the magazine is an exaggerated response to its security \nconcerns because no other corrections department in the nation impounds this \nparticular magazine based on its ad content.  And it points to several supposedly \nsimple alternatives to impoundment that would alleviate the Departmentโs security \nconcerns:  prohibiting inmates from calling out to cell phones, switching to a \nstamp-less system, or attaching a flyer to each issue of Prison Legal News to \nremind inmates not to use the prohibited services.   \n  The Departmentโs decision to impound Prison Legal News is not an \nexaggerated response to its security concerns.  Although the โpolicies followed at \nother well-run institutions [are] relevant to a determination of the need for a \nparticular type of restriction,โ such policies are not โnecessarily controlling.โ  \nProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 414 n.14, 94 S. Ct. 1800, 1812 n.14 (1974), \noverruled on other grounds by Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 413โ14, 109 S. Ct. at \n1881โ82.  โ[T]he Supreme Court has made it patently clear that the Constitution \n40 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 42 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 41 of 48 \ndoes not mandate a lowest common denominator security standard whereby a \npractice permitted at one penal institution must be permitted at all institutions.โ17  \nPope, 101 F.3d at 1385; see also Crime Justice & Am., Inc. v. Honea, 876 F.3d \n966, 971, 978 & n.6 (9th Cir. 2017) (rejecting the plaintiffโs argument that a ban on \nits magazine coming into a countyโs jail was an exaggerated response to safety \nconcerns, even though the magazine was โwidely distributed at other jails,โ \nbecause the county did not have as much control over the inmates in its jail \ncompared to other counties).  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to prison \nmanagement.  As Upchurch testified, every institution faces different security \nproblems and deals with those problems in different ways.  For example, some \nprisons put microwaves in communal inmate living areas, while others would \nnever allow that arrangement out of fear that an inmate would heat up hot water \n                                                 \n  17 There is no support for PLNโs argument that the Department has the burden of showing \nsomething unique about its institutions to justify its impoundment decisions.  Cf. Overton, 539 \nU.S. at 132, 123 S. Ct. at 2168 (โThe burden . . . is not on the State to prove the validity of prison \nregulations but on [the challenger] to disprove it.โ).  PLN cites Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.S. ___, 135 \nS. Ct. 853, 859 (2015), where the Supreme Court held that Arkansasโ ban on prisoners having \n1/2 inch beards substantially burdened a Muslim inmateโs religious exercise.  The Supreme \nCourt observed that most states and the federal government permitted inmates to grow beards of \nthat length, and stated that โwhen so many prisons offer an accommodation, a prison must, at a \nminimum, offer persuasive reasons why it believes that it must take a different course . . . .โ  Id. \nat 866.  The Court analyzed that claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized \nPersons Act, which requires the government to show that its regulation is the least restrictive \nmeans of furthering a compelling interest.  Id. at 863.  Turner, by contrast, does not require the \nDepartment to use the โleast restrictive meansโ to promote prison security.  Turner, 482 U.S. at \n90โ91, 107 S. Ct. at 2262.  And even under RLUIPA, a state need not permit an accommodation \njust because others do.  See Knight v. Thompson, 796 F.3d 1289, 1291, 1293 (11th Cir. 2015) \n(rejecting the argument that the policies of 39 other prison systems rendered invalid the \nchallenged prison policy). \n41 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 43 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 42 of 48 \nand use it as a weapon.  Upchurch explained that what matters to the Department is \nnot the policies of corrections departments in other states, but maintaining prison \nsecurity and public safety.18  In his view, the impoundments of Prison Legal News \nhelp accomplish those goals.   \n  PLNโs proposed alternatives range from bad to worse.  Prohibiting inmates \nfrom calling cell phones would make it difficult for them to keep in touch with \nfamily and friends (because of the decline in landline use), which in turn would \nundermine efforts to rehabilitate inmates.  Switching to a stamp-less system would \ncost $70,000 (to change the Departmentโs banking system), require changing two \nstate statutes, and force the Department to solve the logistical challenge of how \ninmates could send letters from prison canteens.  See Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 419, \n109 S. Ct. at 1885 (stating that courts must consider the administrative \ninconvenience of proposed alternatives).   \nLast and most definitely least, PLN proposes that the Department follow \nNew Yorkโs lead and simply attach to each issue of Prison Legal News a flyer \nreminding inmates not to use the prohibited services.  Really?  If all New York has \n                                                 \n  18 One reason that the policies of departments in other states do not matter so much is that \ncircumstances vary from state to state.  For example, PLNโs evidence shows that the Arizona \nDepartment of Corrections does not impound Prison Legal News.  PLNโs expert admitted, \nhowever, that Arizonaโs โphysical structures and facilities are more secure thanโ Floridaโs, which \ntends โto use dormitories for certain categories of prisoners that many other states would not put \nin a dormitory.โ  Because of differences in physical structures and facilities, the Departmentโs \nsecurity concerns differ from those of Arizonaโs corrections department. \n42 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 44 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 43 of 48 \nto do to prevent inmate misconduct and crime is gently remind them not to \nmisbehave, one wonders why that stateโs prisons have fences and walls.  Why not \nsimply post signs reminding inmates not to escape?  If New York wants to engage \nin a fantasy about convicted criminals behaving like model citizens while serving \nout their sentences, it is free to do so, but the Constitution does not require Florida \nto join New York in la-la-land.  Though it was hardly necessary to state the \nobvious, Upchurch testified that a reminder flyer on the magazine would not \nalleviate security concerns.  See id. at 419, 109 S. Ct. at 1884โ85 (โIn our view, \nwhen prison officials are able to demonstrate that they have rejected a less \nrestrictive alternative because of reasonably founded fears that it will lead to \ngreater harm, they succeed in demonstrating that the alternative they in fact \nselected was not an โexaggerated responseโ under Turner.โ).  Like the first three \nfactors, this final factor favors the Department. \ne.    The Turner Factors:  Conclusion \n  Upchurch summed up the relationship between the impoundment of Prison \nLegal News and the Departmentโs prison security and public safety interests by \nstating that those rules โcertainly help[ ]โ advance those interests.  And thatโs the \npoint.  The impoundment of Prison Legal News is not a silver bullet guaranteeing \nthat inmates will not break the rules and commit crimes while incarcerated.  But \nthe record shows that a โreasonable relationshipโ does exist between the \n43 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 45 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 44 of 48 \nDepartmentโs decision to impound the magazine and its prison security and public \nsafety interests.  Turner, 482 U.S. at 91, 107 S. Ct. at 2262.  That is all Turner \nrequires.  Id. at 90โ91, 107 S. Ct. at 2262.  Because all four Turner factors favor \nthe Department, we hold that the impoundments of Prison Legal News under Rules \n(3)(l) and (3)(m) do not violate the First Amendment. \nB.  Due Process Claim \nThat the Departmentโs impoundments of Prison Legal News do not violate \nthe First Amendment doesnโt let the Department entirely off the constitutional \nhook.  The district court ruled that the Department violated PLNโs right to due \nprocess by failing to provide it with notice for each impounded issue, and the court \nentered an injunction requiring the Department to do that.  That was not an abuse \nof discretion.   \n  PLN must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard each time the \nDepartment impounds an issue of the magazine.  See Perry, 664 F.3d at 1367; \nMontcalm Publโg Corp. v. Beck, 80 F.3d 105, 106 (4th Cir. 1996) (โWe hold that \npublishers are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard when their \npublications are disapproved for receipt by inmate subscribers.โ); Jacklovich v. \nSimmons, 392 F.3d 420, 433 (10th Cir. 2004) (following Montcalm); see \nalso Londoner v. City and Cty. of Denver, 210 U.S. 373, 385, 28 S. Ct. 708, 714 \n(1908) (โ[D]ue process of law requires that . . . the [party] shall have an \n44 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 46 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 45 of 48 \nopportunity to be heard, of which he must have notice . . . .โ).19  As the district \ncourt ruled, the Admissible Reading Material Rule on its face satisfies those \nrequirements.  When the Department impounds an issue of a publication, the rule \nrequires that it send the publisher a notice form listing the โspecific reasonsโ for \nthe impoundment of that issue.  Fla. Admin. Code r. 33-501.401(8)(b).20  The \nLiterature Review Committee reviews every impoundment decision, id. r. 33-\n                                                 \n  19 We held in the Perry decision that there is a lower due process standard for mass \nmailings (that is, bulk correspondence).  664 F.3d at 1368.  We reject the Departmentโs argument \nthat magazines sent to subscribers are mass mailings.  See Montcalm, 80 F.3d at 109 & n.2 \n(contrasting magazines sent to individual subscribers with mass mailings, which are sent to โeach \nand every inmate at a given institutionโ).  It is also not enough that publishers may receive notice \nof an impoundment from inmates.  See Jacklovich, 392 F.3d at 433โ34 (โ[The] publisherโs rights \nmust not be dependent on notifying the inmate[,] who in all likelihood will never see the \npublication . . . .โ). \n  20 PLN and the amici argue that the Department must provide PLN with notice for each \nindividual copy of Prison Legal News that the Department impounds, even if the Department has \nalready sent notice that it has impounded a copy of that same issue sent to another inmate.  In \nother words, if the Department impounds the January 2018 issue of Prison Legal News and \nwithholds 70 copies of that issue from its inmate subscribers, then PLN wants notice forms for \nall 70 copies, not just one notice for the January issue.  Due process does not demand that much.  \nUnder the administrative rule, once one facility impounds a monthly issue, every other facility \nmust impound that same issue on the same grounds until the Literature Review Committee can \ndecide whether that issue can be admitted into the prisons.  Id. rr. 33-501.401(8)(c), (14)(a), \n(14)(c).  Copy-by-copy notice is not necessary for PLN to learn the reason(s) for the \nimpoundment as long as all copies are impounded for the same reason(s).  See Livingston, 683 \nF.3d at 223 (holding that due process does not require copy-by-copy notice because later \nโdenials of identical publications amount to the routine enforcement of a rule with general \napplicabilityโ).  \nWe also reject PLNโs and the amiciโs argument that it is entitled to more due process \nprotections because of the content of its magazine.  See Shaw, 532 U.S. at 230, 121 S. Ct. at \n1480 (rejecting the argument that courts should โenhance constitutional protection [under \nTurner] based on their assessments of the content of the particular communicationsโ). \n45 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 47 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 46 of 48 \n501.401(14)(c), and the publisher can independently appeal an impoundment \ndecision to that committee, id. r. 33-501.401(15)(a).21   \n  Those procedures, if applied, would have ensured that for each impounded \nissue PLN received a notice form listing the reasons for the impoundment.  As the \nDepartment acknowledges, however, that did not happen for 26 out of the 62 \nmonthly issues (42%) impounded between November 2009 and December 2014.  \nThat failure rate increases to 87% when we take into account defective notice \nforms that did not list the reasons for the impoundment.  Despite that remarkable \nfailure rate, the Department argues that the Secretary cannot be enjoined because \nthere is no evidence that the failure to send the forms was a result of a Department \npolicy or custom to deprive PLN of notice.22  The Department asserts that PLN \nshould find the mailroom workers who are responsible for the failure to provide \nnotice and sue them.  No. \n                                                 \n  21 PLN argues that when the committee reviews an impoundment decision it cannot \nreasonably gauge whether ads are โprominent or prevalentโ in the magazine because it receives \nonly a publicationโs front cover and a copy of the pages with problematic content.  Fla. Admin. \nCode r. 33-501.401(8)(b).  That argument fails because publishers must send a copy of the entire \nimpounded issue when the publisher files its own appeal with the committee.  Id. r. 33-\n501.401(15)(a)(2).   \n  22 The Department argues that PLN did not receive the required notice because of \nnegligent mailroom staff, and that the negligent deprivation of notice cannot give rise to a \nprocedural due process violation.  Cf. Jones v. Salt Lake County, 503 F.3d 1147, 1162โ63 (10th \nCir. 2007) (concluding that PLNโs due process claim failed where a prisonโs mailroom staff \nnegligently failed to deliver the magazine to inmate subscribers).  But the Department \ndeliberately impounded Prison Legal News, which means that it had to provide notice to PLN for \neach impounded issue.   \n46 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 48 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 47 of 48 \n  PLN doesnโt have to hunt and peck throughout Floridaโs correctional system \nfor negligent mailroom workers to sue.  The buck stops with the Secretary.  See \nFla. Stat. ยง 20.315(3) (โThe head of the Department of Corrections is the Secretary \nof Corrections. . . .  The secretary shall ensure that the programs and services of the \ndepartment are administered in accordance with state and federal laws, rules, and \nregulations . . . .โ).  This is not a case of one or two notice letters lost in the mail or \nmailroom.  PLN did not receive notice forms for 42% of the impounded issues, and \nmany forms it received for other issues were defective.  PLNโs effort to enjoin the \nongoing violation of its right to due process is appropriate, and it seeks only \nprospective relief against the Department.  See Friends of Everglades v. S. Fla. \nWater Mgmt. Dist., 570 F.3d 1210, 1215 (11th Cir. 2009) (stating that the Ex Parte \nYoung doctrine permits โlawsuits against state officials as long as the plaintiffs \nseek only prospective injunctive relief to stop ongoing violations of federal lawโ).  \nAnd as the district court pointed out, its injunction โessentially requires compliance \nwith the [Departmentโs] own rule.โ  The Secretary should not protest too loudly an \norder to enforce a rule she is statutorily required to enforce.  See Fla. Stat. \nยง 20.315(3).   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  The Departmentโs concerns with the ads in Prison Legal News are \nreasonably related to its legitimate interests in prison security and public safety, so \n47 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 49 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 48 of 48 \nwe defer to its decision and hold that the impoundments of Prison Legal News \nunder Rules (3)(l) and 3(m) do not violate the First Amendment.  But with the \npower to impound Prison Legal News comes the duty to inform PLN of the \nreasons for the impoundments.  The Department did not do that, which is why the \ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in entering an injunction to require the \nDepartment to adhere to its own notice rules. \n  AFFIRMED. \n48 \n \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 300   Filed 05/17/18   Page 50 of 50\nCase: 15-14220     Date Filed: 05/17/2018     Page: 1 of 1 ",

JONES, in her \nofficial capacity as Secretary of the \nFlorida Department of Corrections, \n \n    Defendant. \n \n___________________________/ \n \nAMENDED ORDER1 \n \nThis case involves an as-applied First Amendment challenge to Florida \nAdministrative Code Rule 33-501.401(3)(l) and (m), as well as a procedural due \nprocess claim brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  Prison Legal News2 and Julie L. \nJones, on behalf of the Florida Department of Corrections, litigated this case to a \n                                           \n1  The original order, ECF No. 251, is amended as a result of Plaintiffโs motion to alter or \namend the judgment, ECF No. 258.   \n \n2 In 2009, PLN, the corporation, changed its name to the Human Rights Defense Center.  \nTr. of Trial 36:24-:25 (Jan. 5, 2015).  This order continues to refer to the entity as PLN. \n \n1 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 2 of 66\n   \n \nfour-day bench trial beginning on January 5th, 2015.3  This order sets forth the \nfindings of fact, analysis of law, and verdict. \nI \nThe parties dispute the constitutionality of the FDOCโs impoundment and \nrejection of PLNโs magazine, Prison Legal News, a monthly publication \ncomprising writings from legal scholars, attorneys, inmates, and news wire \nservices.  FDOC regulates inmate mail with Rule 33-501.401 of the Florida \nAdministrative Code, titled โAdmissible Reading Material.โ  Rule 33-501.401 \nauthorizes the FDOC to screen all mail entering its facilities and sets forth a \ndetailed process by which it may impound that mail. \nSection (3) of Rule 33-501.401 contains thirteen subsections, labeled (a) \nthrough (m), providing distinct criteria by which incoming publications โshall be \nrejectedโ from the prison population.  The First Amendment action specifically \nchallenges subsections (l) and (m), ECF No. 14 ยถ 22, which state: \n[A] [p]ublication[] shall be rejected when . . . \n \n(l) It contains an advertisement promoting any of the following where \nthe advertisement is the focus of, rather than being incidental to, the \n                                           \n3 The sole remaining defendant in this action, Julie L. Jones, is the current Secretary of \nthe FDOC.  Two other secretaries have cycled through the FDOC during this litigation, Kenneth \nS. Tucker and Michael D. Crews.  Some early documents are directed at these individuals.  The \nSecretary of the FDOC is responsible for the overall management of the Florida prison system \nand has ultimate responsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of all FDOC rules, policies \nand procedures, and administrative code provisions.  See ECF No. 14 ยถ 15; ECF No. 68 ยถ 15.  \nFor simplicity, this order refers to Defendant Jones as the FDOC. \n2 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 3 of 66\n   \n \npublication or the advertising is prominent or prevalent throughout the \npublication. \n \n1. Three-way calling services; \n2. Pen pal services; \n3. The purchase of products or services with postage stamps; or \n4. Conducting a business or profession while incarcerated.  \n \n[or] \n \n(m) It otherwise presents a threat to the security, order or rehabilitative \nobjectives of the correctional system or the safety of any person. \n \nFla. Admin. Code R. 33-501.401(3)(l), (m) (2009) (amended 2010).4 \nAs relief, PLN requests a declaratory judgment that Rule 33-501.401(3) is \nunconstitutional as applied to Prison Legal News.  ECF No. 14, at 13.  PLN also \nseeks an injunction that prohibits the impoundment and rejection of Prison Legal \nNews, orders the delivery of all previously censored and withheld issues, and \nrequires individualized notice and an opportunity to be heard whenever a copy of \nan issue is rejected.5  Finally, PLN seeks the same due process remedies for the \n                                           \n4 That is the 2009 version.  The Rule was amended in 2010.  That amendment did not \nchange subsections (3)(l) and (m).  In the version before 2009, the prohibition against \nadvertisements for three-way calling services, pen pal services, the purchase of products or \nservices with postage stamps, and conducting a business while incarcerated appeared in section \n(4), not subsection (3)(l).  See Fla. Admin. Code R. 33-501.401(4) (2006) (amended 2009).  For \nclarity, this Court refers to these prohibitions as (3)(l).  The other subsection at issue in this case \nis (3)(m), the Ruleโs residual clause.  Prior to 2009, the residual clause appeared under \nsubsection (3)(l).  See Fla. Admin. Code R. 33-501.401(3)(l) (2006) (amended 2009).  This Court \nrefers to the residual clause as (3)(m). \n \n5 PLN attempted to add a void-for-vagueness claim.  It sought leave to file a second \namended complaint on February 19, 2013.  ECF No. 119.  That motion was denied for failure to \nshow good cause.  ECF No. 127, at 3.  At the time, the trial was set for May 13, 2013.  ECF No. \n106.  The trial would eventually be delayed by more than a year.  Had this Court known, perhaps \n3 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 4 of 66\n   \n \nbooks and information packets it has mailed to FDOC inmates, which it maintains \nthe FDOC impounded without notice.  Tr. of Trial 4-5 (Jan. 8, 2015). \nII \nThis part of the order sets forth background facts that help situate the lawsuit \nin the broader contest between the parties. \nA \nThis is not the partiesโ first rodeoโthat would have been in February 2003, \nwhen the FDOC began censoring Prison Legal News due to its advertisement of \nservices accepting postage stamps as payment, three-way calling services, pen pal \nservices, and offers to purchase inmate artwork.  See Prison Legal News v. Crosby, \nNo. 3:04-cv-14-JHM-TEM, slip op. at 5-8, ยถยถ 4, 7, 14-16 (M.D. Fla. July 28, \n2005), Pl.โs Trial Ex. 23 (the โMoore Orderโ).  PLN sued the FDOC in January \n2004 challenging that censorship under the First Amendment.6  Id. at 2. \n                                           \nit would have ruled differently on the motion to amend.  Either way, PLN did not again move to \namend the complaint until trial.  By then it was far too late, and the motion was denied. \n6 The First Amendment challenge to the censorship was not the sole claim.  PLN also \nargued that Rule 33-602.207 of the Florida Administrative Code, which prohibits prisoners from \nengaging in outside businesses or professions and which the FDOC interpreted as proscribing \ncompensation for writing for Prison Legal News, infringes on PLNโs First Amendment rights as \na publisher.  Moore Order 17.  The Eleventh Circuit would eventually disagree.  See Prison \nLegal News v. McDonough, 200 F. Appโx 873, 875 (11th Cir. 2006).  Lastly, PLN had originally \nasserted a due process claim under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, but abandoned that \nclaim at the start of the bench trial.  Moore Order 2 n.1. \n \n4 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 5 of 66\n   \n \nWhile the suit was pending in March 2005, the FDOC amended Rule 33-\n501.401 to clarify that publications would not be rejected for the advertising \ncontent in that case, so long as those ads are โmerely incidental to, rather than \nbeing the focus of, the publication.โ7  Moore Order 15.  Following this amendment, \nthe FDOC promised to no longer impound Prison Legal News for its advertising \ncontent.  Id. at 13-15.  The FDOC ceased impounding and rejecting Prison Legal \nNews for the duration of the litigation and argued that PLNโs First Amendment \nchallenge to the Rule was moot. \nThis convinced the district court.  Four months after the amendment was \nimplemented, it found that the FDOC had โshown that the [newly adopted] \nprocedures . . . allow for distribution of [Prison Legal News] in its current formatโ \nand that the magazine would not be rejected solely on the basis of the advertising \ncontent at issue.  Id. at 15-16.  The Eleventh Circuit reiterated these sentiments on \n                                           \n7 Rule 33-501.401 has been amended several times.  The FDOCโs interpretation of the \nRule has also fluctuated.  In the first lawsuit, โthe FDOC changed its position several times as to \nwhether PLNโs magazine contained prohibited material.  In early 2003, the FDOC began \nimpounding issues of PLNโs magazine because they contained ads for three-way calling services, \nwhich are prohibited for Florida inmates because they pose a threat to prison security.  In \nNovember 2003, the FDOC reversed its decision and allowed for delivery of eight issues that it \nhad previously impounded.  However, a month later, in December 2003, the FDOC again \ndecided to impound the magazine for including three-way calling service ads due to ongoing \nsecurity concerns.  By March 2004, the FDOC was satisfied that its telephone provider could \nproperly monitor prisonersโ calls and that the three-way calling service ads were no longer a \nsecurity concern.  Therefore, the FDOC again approved delivery of the magazine.โ  McDonough, \n200 F. Appโx at 875. \n5 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 6 of 66\n   \n \nappeal.  In rejecting PLNโs argument that an injunction was necessary to prevent \nfurther censorship, the Eleventh Circuit stated: \nWe agree with the district courtโs finding that, although the FDOC \npreviously  wavered  on  its  decision  to  impound  the  magazine,  it \npresented sufficient evidence to show that it has โno intent to ban PLN \nbased solely on the advertising content at issue in this caseโ in the \nfuture.  The FDOC demonstrated that its current impoundment rule \ndoes allow for distribution of PLN in its current format and that the \nmagazine will not be rejected based on its advertising content.  The \nFDOC officially revised its impoundment rule and has not refused to \ndeliver issues of the magazine since this amendment. . . .  We have no \nexpectation  that  FDOC  will  resume  the  practice  of  impounding \npublications based on incidental advertisements. \n \nMcDonough, 200 F. Appโx at 878.  Since the Eleventh Circuit disposed of the \nclaim as moot, it further declared that, โ[a]s to the current rule, we offer no opinion \non its constitutionality.โ  Id. \nB \nLess than three years after the Eleventh Circuitโs ruling in McDonough, the \nFDOC amended the Rule to provide an additional ground for rejection under (3)(l).  \nUnder the revised Rule, publications with โprominent or prevalentโ advertisements \nfor services prohibited by (3)(l) would also be rejected.  Fla. Admin. Code R. 33-\n501.401(3)(l) (emphasis added). \nThe 2009 amendments became effective on June 16, 2009.  Def. Crewsโ \nObj. to Pl.โs First Set of Interrogs. to Def.

The FDOC has impounded every issue of Prison Legal News since September \n2009.  Tr. of Trial 105:24-106:2 (Jan. 6, 2015). \nPLN initiated this suit on November 17, 2011.  ECF No. 1.  On December \n16, 2011, PLN filed its First Amended Complaint.  ECF No. 14.  Only two counts \nremain, both against the FDOC.  See ECF No. 117 (confirming the dismissal of the \nother two original defendants under a settlement agreement).  Count III is a First \nAmendment as-applied challenge to subsections (3)(l) and (m) of the Rule.  ECF \nNo. 14, at 11, ยถยถ 40-43.  PLN alleges that the FDOCโs actions โin refusing to \ndeliver or allow delivery of Plaintiffโs publications to Florida inmates in its \ncustody, solely because of the presence of certain advertisements within these \npublications, violate Plaintiffโs rights to free speech, press and association as \nprotected by the First and Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983.โ  Id. ยถ 43.  And, in Count VI, PLN contends that the FDOCโs \nโfailure and refusal to provide Plaintiff with constitutionally required notice and an \nopportunity to be heard and/or protest the decision each time Plaintiffโs \npublications are censored . . . violates Plaintiffโs rights to due process of law \nprotected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments . . . and by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.โ  \nId. at 14, ยถยถ 52-55. \n7 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 8 of 66\n   \n \nOn January 5, 2015, the parties began a four-day bench trial on these two \ncounts.  ECF No. 235.  At its conclusion, the Court extended the parties an \nopportunity to brief certain key issues.  See ECF Nos. 241-44, 246. \nIII \nIn this part are the facts of the case, as found by this Court after careful \nconsideration of all the evidence presented at trial.  Most facts are undisputed.  For \nthose in dispute, the order lays out the competing views before resolving them.  \nA \nEstablished in 1990 by Paul Wright and Ed Meade, Prison Legal News is a \nmonthly magazine that reports on news and legal developments related to the \ncriminal justice system.  Tr. of Trial 32:8-:22 (Jan. 5, 2015).8  PLN, a nonprofit \nwith its principal place of business in Lake Worth, Florida, publishes Prison Legal \nNews.  Tr. of Trial 36:18-37:2 (Jan. 5, 2015).  Its mission is to inform the public \nabout events in prisons and jails and the need for progressive criminal justice \nreform, to inform prisoners and their advocates about these events and how to \nadvocate for their rights, and to enhance rehabilitation for prisoners, ensure \n                                           \n8 The magazine was initially titled Prisonerโs Legal News.  Tr. of Trial 122:22-123:5 \n(Jan. 5, 2015).  In 1992, the editors changed the name to Prison Legal News because they \nโthought that [the] news and information was too important to . . . restrict it to prisoners.โ  Id. \n \n8 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 9 of 66\n   \n \ntransparency and increase accountability of prison officials.  Tr. of Trial 32:23-\n33:9 (Jan. 5, 2015). \nOver the past 25 years, Prison Legal News has published over 700 articles \non the FDOC and Florida prisons and jails, with coverage ranging from \nmisconduct by FDOC contractors to individual cases involving a host of legal \nissues.  Tr. of Trial 51:15-:22 (Jan. 5, 2015).  Prisoners are the magazineโs primary \naudience.  Tr. of Trial 123:6-:10 (Jan. 5, 2015). \nPrison Legal News started carrying advertisements in 1996.9  Tr. of Trial \n41:16-:22 (Jan. 5, 2015).  But it was not until February 2003 that the FDOC \ncensored Prison Legal News for its advertising content.  Tr. of Trial 41:23-42:8, \n184:9-:10 (Jan. 5, 2015).  The FDOC specifically took issue with the publicationโs \nadvertisement of services accepting postage stamps as payment, three-way calling \nservices, pen pal services, and offers to purchase inmate artwork; proscribed \nmostly by subsection (3)(l).  Moore Order 5-8.  The justification was that those \nadvertisements presented a security risk because they promoted prohibited \nservices.  Id. at 3. \n                                           \n9 The FDOC says that advertisements are unnecessary.  The evidence overwhelmingly \nrefutes that argument.  This Court finds that without advertisements PLN could not print Prison \nLegal News.  This Court further finds that printing a Florida-only edition of Prison Legal News \nwould be cost-prohibitive.  Tr. of Trial 60:23-71:14 (Jan. 5, 2015). \n9 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 10 of 66\n   \n \nPLN sued and the FDOC subsequently amended the Rule several times \nduring the 2005 litigation, vacillating between admitting publications containing \n(3)(l) advertisements and rejecting them.  Moore Order 7.  Eventually the FDOC \nsettled on a rule that would not reject publications such as Prison Legal News for \nadvertising services prohibited by subsection (3)(l), so long as the advertisements \nwere โmerely incidental to, rather than being the focus of, the publication.โ Id. at 8. \nThis Court finds that there were several reasons for this change.  First, the \nFDOC believed that it had in place security measures to alleviate some of the \nconcerns associated with the prohibited services advertized in Prison Legal News.  \nSignificantly, the FDOC trusted that its telephone vendor, at the time MCI, could \ndetect and block three-way calls and call-forwarding.  See, e.g., id. at 7; Tr. of Trial \n78:11-:22 (Jan. 6, 2015).  Second, the FDOC recognized that โincidentalโ \nadvertisement did not pose a significant security threat to the prisons.  Moore \nOrder 15.  Following this recognition, the FDOC promised that it would no longer \nimpound and reject Prison Legal News โin its current format.โ  Id. at 16.  The Rule \nwas not, as PLN claims, amended to โmootโ the 2005 case.  Tr. of Trial 78:11-:22 \n(Jan. 6, 2015). \nFinally, this Court finds that the 2005 litigation did not concern services \nprohibited by subsection (3)(m).  See Tr. of Trial 69:9-70:8 (Jan. 6, 2015) \n(discussing the major concerns in the prior litigation); Tr. of Trial 214 (Jan. 7, \n10 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 11 of 66\n   \n \n2015) (testifying that prior litigation was not about subsection (3)(m)).  This \nlitigation does. \nB \nFrom 2005 to 2009 the FDOC, proceeding under the revised Rule, did not \nreject Prison Legal News.  Then, in June 2009, the FDOC once again amended \nsubsection (3)(l) of the Rule.  Along with this revision came the decision to resume \nrejection of publications such as Prison Legal News for advertising services \nprohibited by subsection (3)(l).10 11  At trial, the parties vigorously disputed what \n                                           \n10 At times during this litigation the FDOC has taken the position that the 2009 revisions \nwere not substantiveโthat is, that the sole purpose was to clarify โincidentalโ to assist mailroom \nstaff.  The witnesses at trial could not agree on whether the change was substantive, and the \nparties never directly addressed the issue. \nIf truly not substantive, adding โprominent or prevalentโ should not have resulted in \nheightened censorship, generally.  Yet that is precisely what happened.  Within a few months the \nFDOC resumed rejection of Prison Legal News, even though there was no noticeable change in \nthe magazine between June 2009, when the rule was implemented, and September 2009, the first \nissue impounded since 2005.  See Def.โs Trial Ex. 1; Pl.โs Trial Ex. 79. \nWhat explains this inconsistency?  First, it may not be an inconsistency at all.  It could be \nthe case that Prison Legal Newsโ advertising content had ballooned well beyond โincidentalโ \nback in October 2008, when it made the permanent jump from 48 pages per issue to 56.  See Pl.โs \nTrial Ex. 79, at 38.  This would mean that FDOC mailroom staff mistakenly admitted Prison \nLegal News for nearly a year.  Under this view, the 2009 amendment worked.  The staff has \ngotten it right ever since, impounding and rejecting every issue of the magazine from September \n2009 to the present. \nThis Court finds, however, that the true and more obvious answer is that the 2009 \namendment was not a simple โrestylingโโto borrow from the judicial Committee on Rules of \nPractice and Procedureโof the Rule.  The evidence at trial bears this out.  For instance, Susan \nHughes, chairwoman of the Literature Review Committee from 2012 to October 2013, testified \nthat she understood the 2009 revision to be a change in the rule.  Tr. of Trial 2:13-:17, 6:9-7:8 \n(Jan. 7, 2015).  And, as this Court will discuss, the FDOC provided additional justifications for \nthe substantive decision to again reject Prison Legal News, such as renewed security concerns. \n \n11 The FDOC also began censoring Prison Legal News for advertisements prohibited by \nsubsection (3)(m). \n \n11 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 12 of 66\n   \n \nprompted these changes.  Everyone agrees it was not any major incident or tragedy \nrelated to (3)(l) services, since none occurred between 2005 and 2009.12  Tr. of \nTrial 5:9-:12 (Jan. 6, 2015). \nFDOC administrators gave three primary reasons for amending subsection \n(3)(l) in 2009, each of which this Court deems credible.  See Tr. of Trial 58:20-:21 \n(Jan. 6, 2015).  The first was a disagreement among the administrators โover \nwhether the prior policy met the needs of the department.โ  Tr. of Trial 59:8-:10 \n(Jan. 6, 2015).  According to James Upchurch, new technology, such as the advent \nof Voice over Internet Protocol (โVoIPโ) technology, forced the FDOC to \nreconsider previous security decisions.  Tr. of Trial 19:12-:22 (Jan. 6, 2015).  \nSecurus is the FDOCโs current telephone vendor.  Like MCI, it works by detecting \nnoises and clicks made on a phone line that signal the initiation of three-way calls \nand call-forwarding.  Tr. of Trial 15-16 (Jan. 6, 2015).  Circumventing the system \ngenerally requires obfuscating those specific noises or transferring calls without \nany noise at all.  VoIP employs the latter.  Tr. of Trial 19:12-:22 (Jan. 6, 2015).  \nThe changes in technology proved wrong the FDOCโs belief that it had adequate \nsecurity measures to curb three-way calling and call-forwarding. \n                                           \n12While no single, major incident prompted the amendment, this Court finds that there is \nevidence that companies and prisoners disregarded prison rules against exchanging stamps for \nmoney and services.  See, e.g., Tr. of Trial 36:18-40:13 (Jan. 6, 2015).  \n12 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 13 of 66\n   \n \nThe second reason given was dissatisfaction with the vagueness of \nsubsection (3)(l).  FDOC administrators sought to clarify the circumstances under \nwhich publications should be censored for their advertising content.  See Tr. of \nTrial 59:11-:14 (Jan. 6, 2015); see also Pl.โs Trial Ex. 30 (identifying clarity as the \ngoal of the 2009 revisions).  They did so with the antonyms โprominent or \nprevalent,โ which the FDOC believed would assist mailroom staff in their \ndecision-making.  Lastly, the FDOC had noticed an increase in the volume of \nadvertisements related to postage stamps.  Tr. of Trial 59:16-:18 (Jan. 6, 2015). \nA major theme in PLNโs First Amendment challenge is that the FDOC had \nno legitimate reasons for amending subsection (3)(l).  So, PLN endeavored to \nundermine these reasons all through trial. \nPLN asserts that the first reasonโthe purported circumvention of Securusโ\nis false.  Securus, like MCI, is contractually obligated to block the call services at \nissue.  This contract was recently renewed by the FDOC.  That means the system \nworks, says PLN.  Otherwise, the FDOC would not have renewed the contract. \nFDOC offers evidence to refute PLNโs argument.  First, Securus itself \nadmits it is not 100% effective.  Second, FDOC personnel monitoring phone calls \nhave heard inmates successfully transfer calls.  Third, hundreds of thousands of \nattempted calls have been detected by Securus.  According to the FDOC, this \n13 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 14 of 66\n   \n \nmeans that some prisoners successfully transfer calls, or else there would not be so \nmany attempts. \nFDOC officials also said that increasing Securusโ effectiveness would be too \ncostly.  They explained that Securus could be made more effective by increasing \nits sensitivity to noise.  The heightened sensitivity would capture more attempts, \nbut also result in more false positives.  It would shutdown inmates placing rule-\nabiding phone calls.  This would lower prisoner morale and increase tension to \nuntenable levels.  Tr. of Trial 15-16:25 (Jan. 6, 2015).  So it goes. \nWith respect to the first reason, this Court makes the following \ndeterminations.  At the time of the 2005 litigation, the FDOC believed that its \ntelephone vendor could detect all attempts at three-way calling and call-\nforwarding.  After all, Securus, its current vendor, is contractually obligated to \nblock three-way calls and call-forwarding attempts.  Yet it is unable to do so.  \nSome calls, including those transferred using VoIP technology, elude the system.  \nThere is no evidence to suggest that any other provider could do a better job than \nSecurus.  And while it is theoretically possible to increase Securusโ efficacy, any \nbenefit from doing so would be offset by attendant prison instability. \nAs to the third reason, PLN points out that the FDOC never ran a study to \ndetermine whether advertisements accepting stamps as payment increased between \n2005 and 2009.   Tr. of Trial 59:19-60:7 (Jan. 6, 2015).  The FDOC instead relied \n14 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 15 of 66\n   \n \non plain observations and noticed that the number of such advertisements had \ngrown โsubstantially.โ  Tr. of Trial 59:19-60:18 (Jan. 6, 2015); accord Tr. of Trial \n8:22-9:1 (Jan. 6, 2015). \nThat is beside the point.  In fact the magazine did increase in size.  Tr. of \nTrial 109:18-110:6 (Jan. 5, 2015).  In four years the magazine went from 48 pages \nto 56 pages per issue, containing both more substantive, non-offending content and \nprohibited advertisements.  See Pl.โs Trial Ex. 79 (providing total number of pages \nfor every issue of Prison Legal News dating back to January 2002); Def.โs Trial \nEx. 7.  Qualitatively, the advertisements have changed as well.  The number of \nโhalf page or greaterโ (3)(l) ads have increased.  Def.โs Trial Ex. 7.  And since \n2010, PLN has run an offending advertisement on the back cover of the magazine.  \nId.  Today, Prison Legal News is 64-pages long.  See Pl.โs Trial Ex. 79.  No formal \nstudy is necessary to see that. \nPLN additionally argues that the FDOC is wrong to look to the total number \nof advertisements.  Tr. of Trial 49:9-:12 (Jan. 7, 2015).  Instead, as PLN would \nhave it, the proper measure is the percentage of the magazine that is prohibited \nadvertisement.  Tr. of Trial 49:14-50:2 (Jan. 7, 2015).  The merits of this argument \nare explored later.  For now, suffice to say that the percentage of advertisements \nfor three-way calling services, stamps as payment, pen pal services, and \nconducting a business servicesโthat is, those prohibited by subsection (3)(l) of the \n15 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 16 of 66\n   \n \nRuleโincreased only slightly from 9.21% in 2005 to 9.8% in 2009.  See Pl.โs Trial \nEx. 79, at 85.  In 2014, (3)(l)-prohibited advertisements averaged 15.07% of the \npublication.  Id.13 \nNotably, neither this โstudyโ nor anything else introduced by the parties \nexamines the percentage for advertisement prohibited by (3)(m).  See Tr. of Trial \n242, 250:9-:15 (Jan. 5, 2015) (explaining methods, which excluded (3)(m) ads); \nsee also Def.โs Trial Ex. 7 (providing number of advertisements forbidden by other \nrules, including (3)(m), and showing that, by 2009, Prison Legal Newsโ advertising \ncontent had widened to include more types of prohibited advertisements; but still \nnot revealing the percentage of (3)(m) advertisements). \nAnother contention made by PLN, which it hopes this Court will adopt as \nfact, is that FDOC officials amended the Rule in 2009 specifically to exclude \nPrison Legal News.  PLN cites email exchanges among FDOC administrators \nwhere they discuss the 2009 amendment and how the new rule might โrun afoulโ \nof the promises made in the 2005 litigation.  See, e.g., Tr. of Trial 61-66 (Jan. 6, \n2015); Pl.โs Trial Ex. 57a-57i.  To PLN, these emails are a smoking gun of the \nulterior motive animating the 2009 revisions.  See Tr. of Trial 135-136 (Jan. 5, \n                                           \n13 Evidence before this Court shows that advertising content in Prison Legal News has \nbeen on the rise since 2005.  Paul Wright testified that PLN does not intend to further increase \nthe number and size of offending advertisements.  Tr. of Trial 59:8-:10 (Jan. 5, 2015).  This \nCourt has no reason to disbelieve Mr. Wright. \n16 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 17 of 66\n   \n \n2015) (accusing the FDOC of censoring Prison Legal News for its editorial \ncontent). \nAt minimum, the emails reveal that FDOC officials were aware that the \n2009 changes would lead to rejection of Prison Legal News.  This supports the \nfinding that the FDOC intended the 2009 amendments to be substantive.  And \nperhaps when placed, as PLN does, in the broader context of FDOC prevarication \nand inconsistent application of the Rule, they hint at chicanery (more on this later).  \nBut it is still a stretch to say that the emails demonstrate that FDOC officials \namended the Rule in 2009 specifically to exclude Prison Legal News. \nThese emails are the closest thing PLN presented to direct evidence that the \nFDOC targets Prison Legal News.  Other circumstantial evidence relies heavily on \ninference to support this theory.  PLN reasons, for example, that security concerns \ncould not possibly underlie the amendment because no major incident or tragedy \nrelated to the services advertised occurred between 2005 and 2009.  The Rule must \nthen be a faรงade, masking institutional bias against a publication that informs \nprisoners of their rights. \nSuch a finding would be nothing less than conjecture.  There are many \nreasons, not the least of which is that there is some evidence of stamp-related \nproblems.  Animus is not the only inference that can be drawn from the fact that \nthe FDOC amended subsection (3)(l) before a calamity transpired.  Plus, the FDOC \n17 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 18 of 66\n   \n \nunequivocally denies any malice, its officials going as far as saying that they view \nPrison Legal News favorably.  See, e.g., Tr. of Trial 212:9-:13 (Jan. 7, 2015).  \nMore importantly, PLN failed to offer any evidence showing that the FDOC does \nnot censor other publications containing similar advertising content, or that the \nonly other publications that the FDOC censors contain editorial content similar to \nPrison Legal News.  To the contrary, the FDOC produced evidence, though \nlimited, that it has repeatedly rejected other publications on (3)(l) grounds, some of \nwhich on their face do not resemble Prison Legal News.  See, e.g., Def.โs Trial Ex. \n12, at 37-39 (censoring American Arab Message for advertising services for \nstamps), 63-65 (censoring Cellmates for pen pal advertisement), 69-71 (censoring \nButterwater catalog for advertising services for stamps), 72-74 (censoring Picture \nEntertainment for advertising services for stamps); Def.โs Trial Ex. 15. \nHere, the more limited conclusion is the soundest.  And that conclusion is \nthat FDOC officials did not amend subsection (3)(l) in 2009 because they disliked \nPrison Legal Newsโ โeditorialโ content.14  And there is no evidence, this Court \nfinds, that the FDOC censors Prison Legal News but not other publications with \nsimilar advertising content.  Lastly, with respect to subsection (3)(l), this Court \n                                           \n14 It is not entirely clear how much โmotiveโ matters, if at all, in the First Amendment \nanalysis.  The order later explores the divergent case law on this issue.  Ultimately, this Court \ndoes not decide whether motive matters because, even if it does, PLN failed to present sufficient \nevidence that FDOC officials acted with ill will in 2009 when they amended the Rule and \nresumed impounding Prison Legal News. \n18 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 19 of 66\n   \n \nfinds, consistent with the expert testimony presented at trial, that advertisements \nfor such services implicate legitimate security concerns.  Tr. of Trial 69-147 (Jan. \n7, 2015). \nTurning to subsection (3)(m), this Court makes the following findings.  \nSubsection (3)(m) contains a residual clause requiring the FDOC to reject \npublications that otherwise present a threat to security, order, rehabilitative \nobjectives, and safety.  From 2009 onward, the FDOC became increasingly \nconcerned with services falling outside the ambit of (3)(l) and within the purview \nof (3)(m).  See, e.g., Tr. of Trial 15:14-:20 (Jan. 7, 2015).  Chiefly troubling among \nthese servicesโat least to the FDOCโare prisoner concierge services, which \nenable inmates to establish outside bank accounts, run background checks, and \nlocate people, among other things.  See Tr. of Trial 69:9-70:8 (Jan. 6, 2015); see \nalso Tr. of Trial 73:13-:21 (Jan. 7, 2015) (listing services falling under umbrella \nterm โprisoner concierge servicesโ).  This Court finds, consistent with the expert \ntestimony produced by the FDOC, that advertisements for these services constitute \nlegitimate security risks.  See Tr. of Trial 69-147 (Jan. 7, 2015). \nPrison Legal News contained these sorts of advertisements in 2009.  See \nDef.โs Trial Ex. 7.  It did not back in 2005.  See id.  Indeed, the largest increase in \nadvertisements in Prison Legal News has been for prisoner concierge services.  Tr. \n19 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 20 of 66\n   \n \nof Trial 73:13-:21 (Jan. 7, 2015).  Unremarkably, then, the FDOC began invoking \nsubsection (3)(m) to censor the publication. \nNot all of PLNโs evidentiary arguments are duds.  The following is largely \nundisputed.  Florida is the only state that censors Prison Legal News because of its \nadvertising content.  Tr. of Trial 71:15-:20, 198-200 (Jan. 5, 2015).  The private \nprison corporations censor Prison Legal News only in Florida as well.  Tr. of Trial \n75:14-:20 (Jan. 5, 2015).  Some states that previously censored the publication \nbecause of its advertising content have found less restrictive ways of furthering \ntheir legitimate penological goals without banning it.  See, e.g., Tr. of Trial 81:19-\n82:14 (Jan. 5, 2015) (explaining that New York staples a notice to the magazine \nbefore delivering it to inmates warning them that certain services are prohibited). \nOther prison rules seem in tension with the penological grounds upon which \nthe FDOC censors Prison Legal News.  Inmates may call up to 10 numbers \npreapproved by the FDOC.  Tr. of Trial 13:1-:7 (Jan. 6, 2015).  The FDOC claims \nthat three-way calling and call-forwarding present a security risk because these \nservices mask the identity and location of the true recipient of a call.  Tr. of Trial \n197-200 (Jan. 5, 2015).  Yet the FDOC allows inmates to list cell phone numbers, \nfor which it has no way of knowing the location and identity of the person on the \nother end.  Id.; see also Tr. of Trial 22:5-:10 (Jan. 6, 2015).  The assignment of a \ncell phone number likewise does not depend on geography.  Tr. of Trial 49-50 \n20 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 21 of 66\n   \n \n(Jan. 6, 2015) (explaining how someone in Miami can obtain a cell phone number \nwith a Tallahassee area code).  Similarly, even though the FDOC has stamp-related \nsecurity concerns, it allows inmates to possess up to 40 stamps at any given time.  \nTr. of Trial 188:3-:4 (Jan. 5, 2015).  And, as PLN stresses, there are many ways for \ninmates to obtain the information advertized in Prison Legal News despite its \ncensorship. \nThese inconsistencies aside, this Court determines that the FDOCโs stated \npenological objectives for censoring Prison Legal New have been steadfast: \nsecurity, rehabilitation, and protecting the public, FDOC staff and inmates. \nC \nThe FDOCโs literature review process can be broken down into two groups.  \nThe first group consists of incoming publications that have not previously been \nrejected by the Literature Review Committee (โLRCโ), the body that reviews \nimpoundment decisions made by FDOC institutions.  As to that group, the process \nworks as follows. \nAn issue of Prison Legal News enters an FDOC facility or institution.  \nMailroom personnel initially flag potential advertising violations.  If they think the \nadvertising content violates the Rule, the publication is sent to the warden or the \nwardenโs designee (โ[f]or the purposes of approving the impoundment of \npublications,โ the designee is limited to the assistant warden), who makes the \n21 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 22 of 66\n   \n \nimpoundment decision for the FDOC institution.  Fla. Admin. Code R. 33-\n501.401(8)(a).  If that official believes the publication violates the Rule, he or she \ncompletes โForm DC5-101, Notice of Rejection or Impoundment of Publications.โ  \nId.  The form is supposed to indicate the โspecific reasonsโ for impoundment.  Id. \nSeveral copies of this form are made.  Not everyone is entitled to a copy.  \nUnder the Rule, the inmate is always entitled to notice whenever a copy of any \npublication addressed to him or her is impounded.  But the Rule only requires that \nthe institution that โoriginated the impoundment . . . also provide a copy of the \ncompleted form to the publisher, mail order distributor, bookstore or sender, and to \nthe literature review committee.โ  Fla. Admin. Code R. 33-501.401(8)(b).  โ[A] \ncopy of the publicationโs front cover or title page and a copy of all pages cited on \n[the form],โ are attached to the copy sent to the LRC.15  Id. (emphasis added). \nFDOC personnel do not mark down every offending advertisement.  So the \nLRC never receives a photocopy of the entire impounded publication.16  The LRC \nreviews the institutionโs decisionโin (3)(l) cases, reviewing to see whether \noffending advertisement is โprominent or prevalent throughout the publicationโโ\n                                           \n15 Briefly, the parties dispute the burden of making a copy for the publisher every time an \nFDOC facility impounds a copy of an issue.  The dispute centered on whether doing so would \nimpose a de minimus burden on the FDOC.  This Court has considered the evidence and now \nfinds that making a copy for the publisher every time would be minimally burdensome. \n \n16 The FDOC does not copy the entire publication for fear that doing so infringes \ncopyright protections. \n22 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 23 of 66\n   \n \nwithout ever knowing the number and size of all offending advertisements in any \ngiven issue of Prison Legal News, nor the issueโs total page count.  It may affirm \nor overturn the institutionโs decision on different or additional grounds.  Tr. of \nTrial 113:20-:25, 120:20-:23 (Jan. 6, 2015).  The LRC does not use Form DC5-101 \nto make its decision.  Tr. of Trial 120 (Jan. 6, 2015).  Instead, the LRC uses a \ndifferent form that it keeps internally.  Id.  These internal forms have not been \nprovided to this Court by either party. \nOnce an initial impoundment decision is made, the Rule requires all other \ninstitutions to impound the same publication pending review by the LRC.  Fla. \nAdmin. Code R. 33-501.401(8)(c).  The initial impounding institution is supposed \nto notify other institutions of the impoundment through a centralized database that \nexplains why a specific publication was impounded.  This reduces duplicative \nefforts.  Institutions that subsequently receive the same publication should \nautomatically reject it on the same grounds as the initial institution. \nGroup two concerns publications that have previously been rejected by the \nLRC.  Once the LRC affirms an initial impoundment, it rejects the specific issue of \na publication and informs all institutions of its decision.  Future recipient \ninstitutions are then required to reject other copies of that issue.  The LRC does not \nnotify publishers when it upholds an impoundment decision unless the publisher \nappealed the initial impoundment decision.  Tr. of Trial 86:3-:8 (Jan. 6, 2015). \n23 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 24 of 66\n   \n \nD \nThe FDOC has impounded every issue of Prison Legal News since \nSeptember 2009.  Pursuant to its policy, it admits not providing PLN a notice of \nimpoundment for every copy of each issue it has impounded.17 \nThe FDOC says that it has provided PLN at least one impoundment notice \nper issue since 2009.  As evidence, the FDOC called two witnesses who worked in \nthe mailroom at Florida State Prison.  Tr. of Trial 154, 180 (Jan. 7, 2015).  One of \nthem, Ms. Patricia Goodman, has been working there since at least 2009.  Tr. of \nTrial 154:22-155:7 (Jan. 7, 2015).  The two witnesses are responsible for mailing \nout the impoundment notices originating at Florida State Prison.  Both testified \nabout the impoundment protocol at their institution and how closely these \nprocedures are followed by mailroom staff.  See, e.g., Tr. of Trial 158:5-:7 (Jan. 7, \n2015).  Neither could independently recall actually sending PLN an impoundment \nnotice every single time.  As further support, the FDOC provided documentation of \nnotices of impoundment from 2009 to the present.  See Def.โs Trial Ex. 5. \nNone of this, says PLN, demonstrates that the FDOC provided PLN with an \nimpoundment notice for every issue since 2009.  PLN is absolutely correct.  First, \nthe testimonial evidence submitted by the FDOC is limited to one of its \ninstitutions, Florida State Prison.  No one argues that Florida State Prison was \n                                           \n17 Whether due process requires individualized notice per copy will be discussed later. \n24 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 25 of 66\n   \n \nalways the original impounding institution.  There is no evidence that the other \ninstitutions regularly followed protocol like Ms. Goodman.  Second, even for the \nFlorida State Prison, the witnesses admitted that they could not recall whether they \nnotified PLN every time.  Third, the notices of impoundment submitted are \nreproductions of notices received by PLN from prisoners, not the FDOC.  See ECF \nNo. 241, at 9-10 (explaining that the notices reproduced in Defendantโs Trial \nExhibit 5 contained PLN Bates numbers; PLN originally disclosed these notices to \nthe FDOC during discovery). \nThis Court finds in favor of PLN on these facts.  PLN proved that it did not \nreceive an impoundment notice for every issue impounded since November 2009.  \nECF No. 241, at 9.  Two of its witnesses explained PLNโs mail protocol, credibly \nestablishing PLNโs meticulous recordkeeping.  Tr. of Trial 252, 268 (Jan. 5, 2015).  \nFrom November 2009 to June 2013, Mr. Zachary Phillips was responsible for \nfiling mail concerning censorship or possible censorship of Prison Legal News.  \nTr. of Trial 253:8-254:6 (Jan. 5, 2015).  He reviewed notices of rejection or \nimpoundment from November 2009 to May 2013.  Tr. of Trial 257-263 (Jan. 5, \n2015).  PLN did not receive a notice of impoundment from the FDOC for many of \nthose months.  See, e.g., Tr. of Trial 257:13-:14 (Jan. 5, 2015) (stating that in 2010 \nPLN did not receive notices in May, June, July, August, September, and October). \n25 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 26 of 66\n   \n \nIn summary, for 26 issues between November 2009 and December 2014, \nPLN did not receive any notice from the FDOC that Prison Legal News had been \nimpounded.18  That is roughly 42% of all issues during that period where the \nFDOC withheld Prison Legal News without notifying PLN.  ECF No. 241, at 9.  \nOf the notices PLN did receive, many did not list the page numbers containing \nadvertisements allegedly in violation of the Rule.  Id.  Some did not even state the \nsubsection allegedly breached.  Id.  And at least three times PLN received a notice \nof rejection without having first received a notice of impoundment, meaning that \nthe LRC had made its decision before PLN had an opportunity to appeal.  Id. \nLastly, this Court finds that the FDOC failed to provide notice every time it \nimpounded the Prisonersโ Guerilla Handbook and the information packets sent to \nits inmates by PLN.  See Tr. of Trial 261-262 (Jan. 5, 2015); Tr. of Trial 4-5 (Jan. \n8, 2015); Pl.โs Trial Ex. 46; Pl.โs Trial Ex. 86. \nIV \nThere are three principal issues to be resolved.  The first is preliminary and \ndoes not address the merits of PLNโs lawsuit.  That issue is whether the FDOC \nshould be judicially estopped from censoring Prison Legal News under Rule 33-\n501.401(3)(l).  Resolving that issue does not completely dispose of the case \n                                           \n18 This is the summary provided by PLN in its post-trial brief.  See ECF No. 241, at 9.  \nThis Court has independently reviewed the evidence submitted at trial and agrees with the \nsummary. \n26 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 27 of 66\n   \n \nbecause PLN also brought an as-applied First Amendment challenge to subsection \n(3)(m) of the Rule.  The two remaining issues are: first, whether the FDOCโs \ncensorship of Prison Legal News under Rule 33-501.401(3)(l) and (m) \nunconstitutionally abridges PLNโs First Amendment rights;19 and second, whether \nthe FDOC violated PLNโs procedural due process rights. \nA \nThe preliminary question is whether judicial estoppel bars the FDOC from \ncensoring Prison Legal News on the basis that its advertising content violates Rule \n33-501.401(3)(l). \nThe doctrine of judicial estoppel generally โprevents a party from asserting a \nclaim in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a \nprevious proceeding.โ  New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749 (2001) \n(quoting 18 Mooreโs Federal Practice ยง 134.30, p. 134-62 (3d ed. 2000)).  It is \ndesigned โto protect the integrity of the judicial process.โ  Id.  To that end, the \ndoctrine, in its โsimplest manifestation[],โ estops a party from asserting โa present \nposition because [that] party had earlier persuaded a tribunal to find the opposite.โ  \n18B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure ยง 4477 (2d ed. \n2015). \n                                           \n19 Applied to the State of Florida by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n27 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 28 of 66\n   \n \nThe Supreme Court in New Hampshire explained that while โ[t]he \ncircumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are \nprobably not reducible to any general formulation of principle,โ โseveral factors \ntypically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case.โ  \n532 U.S. at 750 (alteration in original) (quoting Allen v. Zurich Ins. Co., 667 F.2d \n1162, 1166 (4th Cir. 1982)). \nFirst, a partyโs later position must be โclearly inconsistentโ with its \nearlier position.  Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has \nsucceeded in persuading a court to accept that partyโs earlier position, \nso  that  judicial  acceptance  of  an  inconsistent  position  in  a  later \nproceeding would create โthe perception that either the first or the \nsecond court was misled.โ  Absent success in a prior proceeding, a \npartyโs later inconsistent position introduces no โrisk of inconsistent \ncourt determinations,โ and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity.  \nA  third  consideration  is  whether  the  party  seeking  to  assert  an \ninconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an \nunfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped. \n \nId. at 750-51 (citations omitted). \nIn this Circuit, courts consider two additional factors.  โFirst, it must be \nshown that the allegedly inconsistent positions were made under oath in a prior \nproceeding.  Second, such inconsistencies must be shown to have been calculated \nto make a mockery of the judicial system.โ   Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., 291 \nF.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. v. Harvey, \n260 F.3d 1302, 1308 (11th Cir. 2001), cert. granted, judgment vacated on other \ngrounds, 537 U.S. 1085 (2002)).  โ[T]hese . . . enumerated factors are not \n28 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 29 of 66\n   \n \ninflexible or exhaustive.โ  Id. at 1286.  And, courts have discretion in invoking the \ndoctrine.  New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750.  But they โmust always give due \nconsideration to all of the circumstances of a particular case when considering [its] \napplicability.โ  Burnes, 291 F.3d at 1286 (emphasis added). \nThe FDOC currently maintains that the advertisements for (3)(l) services in \nPrison Legal News present a security threat, justifying the publicationโs censorship \nunder that subsection.  PLN insists that this position is clearly inconsistent with the \n2005 representation that โsuch โincidentalโ ads do not pose a significant security \nthreat to the prisons.โ  Moore Order 15.  It would be different if the underlying \nfacts changed, but according to PLN, the only thing that has changed is the \nFDOCโs โinterpretation of the evidence or its decisions on how to enforce the rules \nat issue.โ  ECF No. 241, at 20.  It points out that the percentage of (3)(l) \nadvertising content in Prison Legal News did not increase significantly from 2005 \nto 2009, and that no major incident or tragedy linked to (3)(l) services occurred \nduring that time period.  The FDOCโs โflip-floppingโ โover the same rule and \nsame security concerns,โ PLN claims, is precisely the sort of inveiglement of the \njudiciary that judicial estoppel is supposed to ward against. \nBut because circumstances have changed, the two FDOC positions are not \nclearly inconsistent.  First, technology changed.  In 2005, the FDOC decided not to \ncensor publications containing advertisements for three-way calling and call-\n29 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 30 of 66\n   \n \nforwarding services because it believed that its telephone vendor could detect and \nblock all such attempts.  See Moore Order 14.  Yet inmates have continued to \nbypass the FDOCโs security measures using technology such as VoIP that \npreviously was not so widely available.  The FDOC was clearly mistaken about the \nefficacy of its security measures.  Judicial estoppel simply does not apply โwhen \nthe prior position was taken because of a good faith mistake rather than as part of a \nscheme to mislead the court.โ  Ryan Operations G.P. v. Santiam-Midwest Lumber \nCo., 81 F.3d 355, 362 (3d Cir. 1996). \nSecond, the extent to which Prison Legal News advertizes services \nprohibited by (3)(l) has also changed.  PLN stresses that the proportion of the \nmagazine that is (3)(l) advertisement barely increased from 9.21% in 2005 to 9.8% \nin 2009.  To PLN, these percentages demonstrate that in 2009 such advertisements \nwere no less โincidentalโ than they had been in 2005.  PLN thus equates \nโincidentalโ to proportional. \nA strictly proportion-based metric, however, overlooks significant \ndifferences.  For starters, Prison Legal News ran larger ads in 2009.  A chart \nsubmitted by the FDOC tallies the number of โhalf page or greaterโ (3)(l) ads.  \nDef.โs Trial Ex. 7.  From April 2005, the last issue censored in the previous \nlitigation, to September 2009, the number of such ads increased by 100%, from 2 \nto 4.  Id. at 1.  That number rose even more, now hovering around 6 per issue.  Id. \n30 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 31 of 66\n   \n \nat 3.  So while the overall proportion of (3)(l) advertisement had not increased \nsignificantly in 2009, the number of larger, more conspicuous ads did. \nThe magazine also shifted away from advertising three-way calling services \nto advertisements enabling inmates to purchase products or services with postage \nstamps.  By PLNโs own account, the number of these so-called โstampโ \nadvertisements went from 2 in April 2005 to 7 in September 2009.  Compare Pl.โs \nTrial Ex. 79, at 17-18, with id. at 43-44.  That number has steadily ticked upward: \n8 by November 2009; 9 in February 2010; 10 in March 2010; a slight decrease \nbefore rebounding to 11 in July 2010; 13 by August 2010; peaking at 17 in March \n2013; and steadying at the lower end of the teens ever since.  Id. at 44-84.  \nAdvertisements for three-way calls have not seen this growth, but they have not \ndecreased either.  Id.  Although PLN argues that the overall percentage of (3)(l) \nadvertisements has not changed much,20 the magazine clearly emphasizes a \ndifferent type of (3)(l) ad today than it did in 2005. \nThe most obvious shortcoming with equating โincidentalโ to proportional is \nthat it misses the absolute increase of advertisements for services prohibited by \n(3)(l).  See id.; Def.โs Trial Ex. 7.  Perhaps a 10-page publication with one page of \nadvertisement is functionally equivalent to a 100-page publication with ten pages \n                                           \n20 This is not actually true.  The overall percentage in 2005 was 9.21%.  Pl.โs Trial Ex. \n79, at 85.  By 2011 that number had gone up to 10.19%.  Id.  It hit 12.66% in 2012, and now \nhovers above 15%.  Id. \n31 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 32 of 66\n   \n \nof advertisement.  This Court, however, refuses to supplant FDOC officialsโ \njudgment on whether one of these equally proportionate, but qualitatively different \npublications presents any more of a security risk than the other.  See Jones v. N. \nCarolina Prisonersโ Labor Union, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 125 (1977) (admonishing \nthe lower court for โnot giving appropriate deference to the decisions of prison \nadministrators and appropriate recognition to the peculiar and restrictive \ncircumstances of penal confinementโ). \nAll of these changes to the content and format of Prison Legal News matter \nfor judicial estoppel.  PLN paints the FDOCโs representations in 2005 as a blanket \npromise that Prison Legal News would never again be censored for advertising \nservices prohibited by (3)(l).  But that is not what the Moore Order articulates.  The \nFDOC represented that โsuch โincidentalโ adsโ did not pose a security threat.  \nMoore Order 15 (emphasis added).  This is a direct reference to the advertising \ncontent at issue in that case.  See Blackโs Law Dictionary 1661 (10th ed. 2014) \n(defining โsuchโ as โThat or those; having just been mentionedโ).  By limiting its \nrepresentation, the FDOCโs promise cannot fairly be read as extending to all future \niterations of such advertisements, particularly those different in kind. \nFurthermore, the Moore Order itself reflects the limited finding that the \nFDOC had promised not to impound Prison Legal News โin its current format.โ  \nMoore Order 21 (emphasis added).  The Eleventh Circuit reiterated this \n32 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 33 of 66\n   \n \nunderstanding on appeal.  McDonough, 200 F. Appโx at 878 (โThe FDOC \ndemonstrated that its current impoundment rule does allow for distribution of PLN \nin its current format.โ) (emphasis added).  The format changed in four years.  It \nhas changed even more since then.  Consequently, the FDOCโs current position is \nnot clearly inconsistent with the position it took before Judge Moore, and this \nCourtโs acceptance of that position would not โcreate the perception that . . . the \nfirst . . . court was misled.โ  New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 750-51. \nAccordingly, the FDOC is not judicially estopped from adopting the current \nposition that Prison Legal News must be censored because its (3)(l) advertising \ncontent presents a security risk.21 \nB \nThis Court must also decide whether the FDOCโs censorship of Prison \nLegal News pursuant to Rule 33-501.401(3)(l) and (m) violates PLNโs rights under \nthe First Amendment. \nPLN has a legitimate First Amendment interest in accessing prisoners โwho, \nthrough subscription, willingly seek [the] point of viewโ expressed in Prison Legal \n                                           \n21 The FDOC additionally contends that judicial estoppel does not apply against states \nwhen doing so would โcompromise a governmental interest in enforcing the lawโ and โwhere \nbroad interests of public policy [are] at issue.โ  ECF No. 242, at 4-5 (quoting New Hampshire, \n532 U.S. at 755-56).  It argues this case implicates both concerns.  First, estoppel would \ncompromise the FDOCโs interest in enforcing prison safety rules.  Second, broad interests of \npublic safety and prison security are at issue.  PLN responds that neither interest is at play in this \nlitigation.  This Court need not decide this issue because it finds that the totality of the \ncircumstances counsel against judicial estoppel. \n33 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 34 of 66\n   \n \nNews.  Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 408 (1989).  Prison regulations \nlimiting that access must be analyzed under the reasonableness standard developed \nby the Supreme Court in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987).  Thornburgh, 490 \nU.S. at 413-14 (holding that regulations affecting the sending of a โpublicationโ to \na prisoner must be analyzed under Turner; refusing to distinguish between \nincoming correspondence from prisoners and incoming correspondence from \nnonprisoners); accord Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 224 (1990) (โ[T]he \nstandard of review we adopted in Turner applies to all circumstances in which the \nneeds of prison administration implicate constitutional rights.โ); Perry v. Secโy, \nFlorida Depโt of Corr., 664 F.3d 1359, 1365 (11th Cir. 2011).  Under Turner, such \nregulations are โvalid if [they are] reasonably related to legitimate penological \ninterests.โ  Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 413 (alteration in original) (quoting Turner, \n482 U.S. at 89). \nSeveral factors are relevant to the reasonableness inquiry.  The first factor is \nmultifold, requiring courts to โdetermine whether the governmental objective \nunderlying the regulations at issue is legitimate and neutral, and that the \nregulations are rationally related to that objective.โ  Id. at 414.  This โ โfactorโ is \nmore properly labeled an โelementโ because it is not simply a consideration to be \nweighed but rather an essential requirement.โ  Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, \n274 (2d Cir. 2006); accord Shaw v. Murphy, 532 U.S. 223, 229-30 (2001) (โ[After \n34 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 35 of 66\n   \n \nstating the first Turner factor:] If the connection between the regulation and the \nasserted goal is โarbitrary or irrational,โ then the regulation fails, irrespective of \nwhether the other factors tilt in its favor.โ). \nA second factor โis whether there are alternative means of exercising the \nright that remain open to [the plaintiff].โ  Turner, 482 U.S. at 90.  โA third \nconsideration is the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will \nhave on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources \ngenerally.โ  Id.  Finally, Turner instructs lower courts to inquire whether there are \nโeasy alternativesโ indicating that the regulation is not reasonable, but rather an \nโexaggerated responseโ to prison concerns.  Id. \nAfter the impinged constitutional right has been identified, as is the case \nhere, the state must โput forwardโ the legitimate governmental interests underlying \nits regulation.  Id. at 89.  Once this is done, the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden \nof showing that the regulation in question, as applied, is not reasonably related to \nlegitimate penological objectives.  Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003) \n(โThe burden, moreover, is not on the State to prove the validity of prison \nregulations but on the [plaintiff] to disprove it.โ). \n35 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 36 of 66\n   \n \nThe FDOC identified public safety and prison security as the underlying \nlegitimate governmental interests.22  No one questions whether those are legitimate \ngovernmental interests.  Any suggestion to the contrary would be fruitless.  See \nThornburgh, 490 U.S. at 415 (holding that regulation promulgated with the \npurpose of โprotecting prison securityโ is legitimate, since that โpurpose . . . is \ncentral to all other corrections goalsโ); Perry, 664 F.3d at 1366 (acknowledging \nthat โprotecting the public and ensuring internal prison securityโ are legitimate \npenological interests).  \nPLN instead contends that the FDOCโs application of Rule 33-501.401(3)(l) \nand (m) is not content-neutral, and that censoring Prison Legal News for its \nadvertising content is not rationally related to public safety and prison security.  \nAnd so, with respect to the first factor, the question becomes (1) whether the Rule \nโoperate[s] in a neutral fashion, without regard to the content of the expressionโ at \nissue; and (2) whether censoring Prison Legal News due to its advertising content \nrationally relates to public safety and prison security.  Turner, 482 U.S. at 90. \nAs to neutrality, the Supreme Court has explained that Turner requires \nnothing more than that โthe regulation or practice in question must further an \nimportant or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of \n                                           \n22 It identified other reasons too, but only the security objectives are necessary for this \nanalysis.  \n36 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 37 of 66\n   \n \nexpression.โ  Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 415 (quoting Procunier v. Martinez, 416 \nU.S. 396, 413 (1974)).  โWhere . . . prison administrators draw distinctions \nbetween publications solely on the basis of their potential implications for prison \nsecurity, the regulations are โneutralโ . . . .โ  Id. at 415-16. \nThe limited evidence at trial reveals that the FDOC censors an assorted mix \nof publications under subsections (3)(l) and (m).  Nothing in the record implies that \nsuch censorship turns on the content of the publication.  PLN did not show, for \ninstance, that the FDOC disparately censors publications critical of its institutions. \nLacking this evidence, PLN argues that FDOC administrators did not amend \nthe Rule in 2009 on legitimate penological grounds.  PLN alleges, citing a series of \nemails, that the true motivation behind the amendment was a dislike of Prison \nLegal News.  See Pl.โs Trial Ex. 57a-57i. \nโIt is unclear what role, if any, motive plays in the Turner inquiry.โ  Hatim \nv. Obama, 760 F.3d 54, 61 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  Compare Hammer v. Ashcroft, 570 \nF.3d 798, 803 (7th Cir. 2009) (โIt is not clear why one bad motive would spoil a \nrule that is adequately supported by good reasons.  The Supreme Court did not \nsearch for โpretextโ in Turner; it asked instead whether a rule is rationally related to \na legitimate goal.โ) (citation omitted), with Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 276-77, and \nQuinn v. Nix, 983 F.2d 115, 118 (8th Cir. 1993) (โPrison officials are not entitled \nto the deference described in Turner and Procunier if their actions are not actually \n37 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 38 of 66\n   \n \nmotivated by legitimate penological interests at the time they act.โ).  In this case, \nthe contours of that role need not be delineated because โ[e]ven if some quantum \nof evidence of an unlawful motive can invalidate a policy that would otherwise \nsurvive the Turner test,โ the evidence introduced by PLN is โtoo insubstantial to \ndo so.โ  Hatim, 760 F.3d at 61; see also Prison Legal News v. Stolle, No. \n2:13CV424, 2014 WL 6982470, at *6 n.2 (E.D. Va. Dec. 8, 2014) (rejecting \napplicability of motive and holding, in the alternative, that PLN failed to present \nsufficient evidence of โunlawful motiveโ that could โinvalidate a policy that would \notherwise survive the Turner testโ).  As previously explained, the emails simply do \nnot evidence unlawful animus on the part of FDOC administrators.  Neither does \nthe other circumstantial evidence.  PLN thus failed to show that the FDOC applies \nRule 33-501.401(3)(l) and (m) in a biased fashion. \nSetting neutrality aside, this Court now turns to the gravamen of PLNโs First \nAmendment challenge.  PLN advances three principal reasons for why there is no \nrational connection between the censorship at issue and the stated penological \nobjectives. \nThe first argument boils down to a dispute about the evidentiary burden \nnecessary to establish a โrationalโ connection.  Everyone, even PLNโs expert, \nagrees that the underlying services addressed in Rule 33-501.401(3)(l) and (m) \nunquestionably compromise public safety and prison security.  See, e.g., Tr. of \n38 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 39 of 66\n   \n \nTrial 68-69 (Jan. 8, 2015) (summarizing how even PLNโs expert agrees that the \nunderlying services compromise security); Tr. of Trial 203:9-:15 (Jan. 5, 2015) \n(admitting that โ[those services raise] very legitimate concernsโ).  This is why the \nFDOC forbids prisoners from using them. \nBut PLN says that evidence that prohibiting the use of these services furthers \nsecurity is not enough.  This case, PLN insists, is not about those services.  This \ncase is about censoring a publication because it advertizes those services.  That is \ncorrect.  Even so, the FDOC also articulated a logical connection between \ncensorship and the penological objectives at stake, and presented sufficient \nevidence in support. \nThe logic is straightforward.  Without question, the proper, initial response \nto the dangerous services is forbidding prisoners from using them.  Though not \nsurprisingly, they do so anyway.  Tr. of Trial 241-243 (Jan. 7, 2015).  See \ngenerally Washington, 494 U.S. at 225 (โ[A] prison environment, . . . โby \ndefinition,โ is made up of persons with โa demonstrated proclivity for antisocial \ncriminal, and often violent, conduct.โ โ  (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, \n526 (1984))).  So the FDOC has adopted prophylactic safeguards in addition to \nbare proscription. \nRule 33-501.401 is such a safeguard.  Advertisements compromise security \nbecause they convert a publication into a โone-stop shopโโto borrow from the \n39 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 40 of 66\n   \n \nFDOCโs expertโfor dangerous services.  Tr. of Trial 71-72:15 (Jan. 8, 2015).  By \nlimiting inmatesโ exposure, the Rule seeks to reduce the likelihood that inmates \nwill use those services. \nPLN responds that such โgeneral or conclusoryโ articulation of rationality is \ninsufficient to withstand constitutional muster.  Tr. of Trial 64:17 (Jan. 8, 2015).  \nThis Court agrees, โTurner requires prison authorities to show more than a \nformalistic logical connection between a regulation and a penological objective.โ  \nBeard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 535 (2006).  The FDOC met that burden by \nproviding the testimony of several administrators who, โrelying on their \nprofessional judgment, reached an experience-based conclusion that [censorship] . \n. . further[s] [the] legitimate prison objectives.โ  Id. at 533 (emphasis added); see \nalso Prison Legal News v. Livingston, 683 F.3d 201, 216 (5th Cir. 2012) (โ[P]rison \npolicies may be legitimately based on prison administratorsโ reasonable \nassessment . . . .โ) (emphasis added).  And, as additional support, the FDOC \nprovided โexpert testimony to establish that [censorship] will help curbโ prisonersโ \nuse of the services.  Perry, 664 F.3d at 1366 (holding that expert testimony is \nsufficient to establish rational connection; deferring to the opinion of FDOC \nadministrator James Upchurch, who is also a witness in this case). \nNone of this suffices for PLN.  It wants specific past incidents.  And not \nmerely some past example of an inmate using a prohibited service to do something \n40 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 41 of 66\n   \n \nbad; PLN demands a concrete, unfortunate incident caused by an inmate using a \nbanned service, which the inmate learned about in Prison Legal News.  See, e.g., \nTr. of Trial 66:2-:8 (Jan. 8, 2015). \nNo controlling precedent in this Circuit requires the FDOC to provide \nevidence of an actual, past incident.  See, e.g., Perry, 664 F.3d at 1363 (affirming \nsummary judgment in favor of the FDOC on First Amendment challenge to prison \nregulation despite fact that the FDOC failed to cite specific instances of the alleged \nproblem in Florida).  Several other circuits likewise do not require it.  See, e.g., \nMurchison v. Rogers, 779 F.3d 882, 890 (8th Cir. 2015) (โ[P]rison officials need \nnot wait until particular prohibited material causes harm before censoring it . . . .โ); \nLivingston, 683 F.3d at 216 (โ[P]rison policies may be legitimately based on prison \nadministratorsโ reasonable assessment of potential dangers.โ).  But even if such \nevidence were required, FDOC administrators provided examples, both in Florida \nand throughout the country, of problems associated with specific services that \nadvertize, or have advertized, in Prison Legal News.  See, e.g., Tr. of Trial 5-6, 39-\n41 (Jan. 6, 2015) (explaining that FDOC officials learned of a company that had \nbeen sending prisoners money for stamps, and how such companies could \ndistribute money for prisoners to people in the outside world in exchange for \nstamps; this company had previously advertized on Prison Legal News). \n41 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 42 of 66\n   \n \nPLNโs second reason is that the FDOC applies the Rule arbitrarily.  PLN \nintroduced evidence of identical issues of Prison Legal News censored at separate \nFDOC facilities on different grounds, as reflected on the impoundment notice \naccompanying the censorship.  There is also some testimony about issues that were \ninitially admitted at some facilities while denied at others.  Lastly, PLN stresses \nthat advertisements for other prohibited services and products are not censored by \nthe FDOC.  PLN maintains that these inconsistencies amount to an irrational \napplication of the Rule. \nCase law supports the proposition that the consistency with which a \nregulation is applied matters for determining whether it is rationally connected to a \nlegitimate penological objective.  โThe existence of similar material within the \nprison walls may serve to show inconsistencies in the manner in which material is \ncensored such as to undermine the rationale for censorship or show it was actually \ncensored for its content.โ  Murchison, 779 F.3d at 890 (emphasis added).  In \naddition to inconsistent censorship of โsimilarโ material, general โinconsistencies \ncould [also] become so significant that they amount to a practical randomness that \ndestroys the relationship between a regulation and its legitimate penological \nobjectives.โ  Id. (quoting Livingston, 683 F.3d at 221); see also Thornburgh, 490 \nU.S. at 417 n.15. \n42 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 43 of 66\n   \n \nAlthough PLN has presented evidence of inconsistent censorship decisions \nmade by FDOC mailroom staff, this Court does not believe PLN demonstrated \ninconsistencies that rise to a level of randomness or that undermine the rationale \nfor censoring Prison Legal News.  The fact that mailroom personnel do not \nuniformly censor Prison Legal News on the same grounds is not dispositive.  \nโWith the volume of material that must be screened, we cannot expect prison \nofficials to perfectly screen all material that violates prison regulations.โ  \nMurchison, 779 F.3d at 890.  Inconsistent application by mailroom staff goes more \nto the vagueness of the Rule. \nIn any event, mailroom staff decisions are not final and do not permanently \ncompel censorship of the magazine throughout Florida.  Initial impoundment \ndecisions are subject to review by the LRC.  The LRC rejects the publication on \nthe grounds it thinks adequate.  That decision is then uniformly applied throughout \nFlorida because once the LRC makes a decision, there is no further individualized \nreview by mailroom staff. \nThis pares down the risk of randomness and distinguishes this case from \nThornburgh,23 where each prison warden independently decided censorship, such \n                                           \n23 Yet, even the inconsistencies in that case did not defeat an otherwise rational \nconnection.  Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 417 n.15 (addressing the โseeming inconsistenciesโ in that \ncase and holding that the regulation at issue struck โan acceptable balanceโ between uniformity \nand individualized review). \n43 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 44 of 66\n   \n \nthat โcertain federal prisons had excluded the very same book that others had \nallowed.โ  Livingston, 683 F.3d at 221.  Here, the very same issue of Prison Legal \nNews is eventually censored throughout the FDOC.  Like in Livingston, the LRCโs \nโsystem-wideโ โexclusion decisionsโ make the inconsistencies โonly arguable,โ \nbecause the only apparent inconsistencies left to sort out are the decisions to admit, \nfor example, an advertisement about guns versus one about three-way calling.  Id.  \nThis Court refuses to engage in such โone-to-one comparisonsโ of specific ads.  Id.  \nNot because these inconsistencies are irrelevant.  But rather, due to the substantial \ndeference owed prison administrators regarding which type of advertisement is \nmore problematic. \nAbsent a showing that the FDOC is admitting other magazines containing \nadvertisements closely resembling those found in Prison Legal News, which there \nis none, this Court holds that the โlimited amount of inconsistency at the margins \nof [the FDOCโs] exclusion decisions is not enough to defeat the reasonableness of \n[the FDOCโs] practices.โ  Id. \nThe last argument PLN advances is that other FDOC regulations undermine \nthe Rule to such a great extent that they render the Ruleโs connection to security \nirrational.  To illustrate, among the many such rules explored at trial is a regulation \npermitting inmates to list cell phone numbers on their preapproved contact list and \nanother allowing inmates up to 40 stamps at any given time.  See Tr. of Trial 22:5-\n44 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 45 of 66\n   \n \n:10 (Jan. 6, 2015); Tr. of Trial 188:3-:4 (Jan. 5, 2015).  PLN asserts that these rules \nundermine the logic behind censoring some of the services singled out in (3)(l).  \nCell phones have three-way calling and call-forwarding capabilities identical to, or \nbetter than, the services advertized on Prison Legal News.  The FDOC has no way \nof knowing a cell phone userโs location, just like it does not know the location of \nthe person on the other end of a forwarded call.  Tr. of Trial 197 (Jan. 5, 2015); Tr. \nof Trial 22:5-:10 (Jan. 6, 2015).  Also, the FDOC allows inmates to have stamps \nand allows families to send inmates stamps despite their contention that they are a \nserious hazard in prisons.  See Tr. of Trial 188:3-:4 (Jan. 5, 2015). \nAn FDOC administrator explained each conflicting rule.  Cell phones are \nubiquitous in modern society.  Prohibiting inmates from calling cell phones would \neffectively preclude them from speaking with many of their loved ones who no \nlonger carry land lines.  The FDOC could theoretically impose such a draconian \nrule, but it would surely lead to increased tension within prisons.   See Tr. of Trial \n102-103 (Jan. 7, 2015) (summarizing practical impossibility). \nLikewise, the FDOC once proposed a rule that would have embargoed \nstamps sent by family members to an inmate by mail.  Tr. of Trial 23 (Jan. 6, \n2015).  Under the proposed rule, families would have been limited to depositing \nmoney into inmatesโ prison accounts which the inmate could then use to purchase \nstamps.  Families and friends of prisoners vehemently opposed the proposal, \n45 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 46 of 66\n   \n \nexpressing concern that the rule would increase the likelihood that their imprisoned \nloved ones would either be victimized or simply not purchase any stamps at all.  \nTr. of Trial 23-24 (Jan. 6, 2015).  Moreover, FDOC officials testified that \nimplementing the accounting measures proposed by PLN to counteract the \nproblems with stamps would be too costly and require amending state statutes.  Tr. \nof Trial 25 (Jan. 6, 2015).  Nearly every other seemingly paradoxical regulation in \nplace also had some corresponding explanation. \nRunning a prison system is not easy.  Prison administrators, charged with the \nunenviable task of โdeal[ing] with the difficult and delicate problems of prison \nmanagement,โ must make considered decisions that balance order, security and \nresources.  Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 407-08.  The first Turner factor requires this \nCourt to determine whether the censorship at issue is rationally related to \nlegitimate penological objectives.  Finding that it is both rational and supported by \nevidence, this Court declines PLNโs invitation to disrupt the balance struck by the \nFDOC. \nThe remaining factors tilt in the FDOCโs favor as well.  When considering \nwhether alternative means of exercising the abridged right remain open to the \nplaintiff, the Supreme Court instructs courts to view โ โthe rightโ in question . . . \nsensibly and expansively.โ  Id. at 417.  This means that the alternatives need not be \nperfect substitutes.  Livingston, 683 F.3d at 218. \n46 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 47 of 66\n   \n \nThe Rule leaves open sufficient alternatives for PLN to express their point of \nview to inmates.  First, as in Perry, the Rule does not completely prevent PLN \nfrom corresponding with inmates.  664 F.3d at 1366.  There are countless other \nwritten materials that PLN may send prisoners.  As the Fifth Circuit in Livingston \nexplained, if alternative means existed in OโLone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U.S. \n342 (1987), โwhere prisoners were cut off from [a] unique and irreplaceable \n[activity]โโโa unique religious ceremonyโโsurely there are alternatives to a \nmagazine.  683 F.3d at 219. \nSecond, even Prison Legal News is not invariably censored.  The Rule \napplies only when a particular issueโs advertising content crosses a certain \nthreshold.24  And while this Court accepts that advertisements are necessary, the \nunfeasibility of printing Prison Legal News without advertising content is not \ndispositive.  PLN has not proven that it is unable to adopt advertising rubrics that \nwould help bring its magazine in line with prison regulations. \nThe third factor is the impact the accommodation of the asserted \nconstitutional right will have on guards, inmates and prison resources.  In this case, \nโthe class of publicationsโ excluded by the Rule โis limited to those found \npotentially detrimental to order and security.โ  Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 418.  The \n                                           \n24 This threshold, however, is almost impossible to identify.  As this Court will explain \nshortly, vagueness is principally responsible for the Ruleโs disparate application. \n47 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 48 of 66\n   \n \nevidence demonstrates that accommodating the specific way in which PLN seeks \nto exercise its rightโthrough a publication containing dangerous amounts of \nadvertising contentโwould โsignificantly less[en] liberty and safety for everyone \nelse, guards and other prisoners alike.โ  Id.  The Supreme Court has held that this \nfact alone pushes the third factor in FDOCโs favor.  Id. (deferring to the โinformed \ndiscretion of corrections officialsโ who had said that accommodating the right \nwould lessen liberty and safety for โeveryone else, guards and other prisonersโ). \nThe final Turner factor is whether there are โeasy alternativesโ indicating \nthat the regulation is not reasonable, but rather an โexaggerated responseโ to prison \nconcerns.  482 U.S. at 90.  This is not an inquiry into whether prison officials \nadopted the โleast restrictive alternative.โ  Id. at 90-91.  โBut if an inmate claimant \ncan point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisonerโs rights at de \nminimis cost to valid penological interests, a court may consider that as evidence \nthat the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.โ  Id. at 91. \nAs this Court explained during its discussion of rationality, there are no \nโeasy alternativesโ available to the FDOC.  The prohibition against using the \nservices themselves is not enough.  Similarly, the alternatives suggested by PLN to \neliminate the security concerns either have equally unattractive side effects or are \ncostly to implement. \n48 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 49 of 66\n   \n \nAdditionally, with respect to subsection (3)(l), โ[a]lthough the FDOC did not \nneed to narrowly tailor its Rule to only prohibitโ publications containing \nโprominent or prevalentโ offending advertisements, it adopted a less exaggerated \nresponse than censorship for any amount of offending advertising content.  Perry, \n664 F.3d at 1367.  And as to subsection (3)(m), this Court is โcomforted by the \nindividualized nature of the determinations required by the regulation,โ under \nwhich a publication is censored only if the LRC determines that it โpresents a \nthreat to the security, order or rehabilitative objectives of the correctional system or \nthe safety of any person.โ  Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 416. \nAdmittedly, the fact that Florida is the only state that currently censors \nPrison Legal News for its advertising content is troublingโat least for purposes of \ndetermining whether the Rule is indeed an exaggerated response.  Some states have \ncensored the publication for its advertising content.  New York once censored it for \ncarrying advertisements about services accepting stamps as payment.  Tr. of Trial \n81-82 (Jan. 5, 2015).  New York eventually settled on a less restrictive way of \nfurthering its security interest without censoring the entire magazine: attaching a \nnotice warning prisoners that the services advertized are prohibited.  Id.  Even if \nthis is the sounder policy, the FDOC is not required to implement the least \nrestrictive regulation.  Moreover, the FDOC may be constrained in ways that New \nYorkโs department of corrections is not.  Significant variances would make \n49 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 50 of 66\n   \n \ncomparison futile.  Comparing different statesโ department of corrections is \ndifficult, and in this case the parties did not submit sufficient evidence to do so.   \nThis Court is also not blind to the many other worrisome facts uncovered at \ntrial.  The most disconcerting is the Ruleโs vagueness.   None of the witnesses at \ntrial were able to articulate any reasonably specific guidelines to determining when \nadvertisements were โprominent or prevalent.โ  Some considered whether font was \nlarge and bolded to determine prominence.  Others looked to the size of the \nadvertisements.  For prevalence, no one could identify a cutoff.  With no \nframework handy, this Court would probably be unable to apply the Rule to those \npublications at the margins.  Yet FDOC officials felt very strongly about their \nability to determine prominence and prevalence correctly.  It seems that they, \nunlike this Court, โknow it when [they] see it.โ  Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, 378 \nU.S. 184, 197 (1964) (Stewart, J., concurring). \nTo make matters worse, the LRC, the final decision-maker, never reviews an \nentire publication or book when it makes its decision.  As this Court mentioned \nearlier, this means that final determinations about prevalence are made without \nknowing whether, for instance, the four or five pages copied and attached to the \nimpoundment notice are four or five out of one hundred, one thousand. \nThat being said, there is no void-for-vagueness claim pending.  This lawsuit \ninstead focuses on whether the FDOC has applied subsections (3)(l) and (m) to \n50 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 51 of 66\n   \n \nPrison Legal News in a manner reasonably related to legitimate penological \ninterests.  Courts have wrestled with the role played by general vagueness in the \nTurner analysis.  See Martinez v. Fischer, No. CIV S-10-0366 GGH P, 2011 WL \n4543191, at *8 n.4 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2011) (โ[T]he undersigned has trouble \nfitting the Turner test, an analysis focused on the legitimacy of prison regulations, \nwith an analysis focused on whether regulations are understandable.โ); Miller v. \nWilkinson, No. 2:98-CV-275, 2010 WL 3909119, at *5 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 30, 2010) \n(noting that โ[p]rison regulations are not often challenged on vagueness groundsโ \nand that some courts have held that โthe First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, do \nnot โapply with independent force in the prison-litigation contextโ โ (quoting \nWaterman v. Farmer, 183 F.3d 208, 213 (3d Cir. 1999))); Bahrampour v. Lampert, \n356 F.3d 969, 975-76 (9th Cir. 2004) (applying Turner test despite inmateโs \nassertion that vagueness and overbreadth claims must be considered separate and \napart from application of Turner test.); cf. Sweet v. McNeil, No. 4:08CV17-\nRH/WCS, 2009 WL 903291, at *7 (N.D. Fla. Mar. 31, 2009) (Hinkle, J.) \n(importing deferential principles to void-for-vagueness suit, in light of Turner).25 \n                                           \n25 PLN does not argue that the Turner analysis entirely subsumes the void-for-vagueness \ninquiry.  Moreover, PLN moved to amend their complaint to add a void-for-vagueness claim.  \nThis implies that PLN also thinks that the two claims are separate and distinct.  In addition, there \nhas not been any argument on the issue of whether void-for-vagueness and overbreadth claims \napply with independent force in the prison context.  This Court accordingly treats them as \nseparate claims. \n51 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 52 of 66\n   \n \nIn this case, all Turner factors support the FDOC.  This includes the last one, \nwhere, instead of banning any amount of offensive advertisement, the FDOC \nelected the less restrictive option of allowing publications with some advertising \ncontent.  The difficulty of applying the more reasonable option should not, and \ndoes not, overcome the other Turner factors.  The uniformity with which the \npublication has been rejected by the LRC, both at the time and after re-reviewing \nthe censored issues in preparation for trial, further alleviates the concern that the \nRule cannot be applied intelligibly.  Finally, the Rule here seems equally as \ndifficult to apply as the one in Thornburgh, but that did not preclude a finding in \nthe governmentโs favor.  See 490 U.S. at 428 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part) (addressing the regulationโs vagueness). \nThis Court therefore holds that PLN has failed to show that the FDOCโs \ncensorship of Prison Legal News is not โreasonably related to legitimate \npenological interests.โ  Turner, 482 U.S. at 89. \nC \nThe final issue is whether the FDOC violated PLNโs due process rights in its \nimpoundment of Prison Legal News, the Prisonersโ Guerilla Handbook and the \ninformation packets sent to FDOC inmates. \nThe โdecision to censor or withhold delivery of a particular [publication],โ \nsuch as Prison Legal News, โmust be accompanied by minimum procedural \n52 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 53 of 66\n   \n \nsafeguards.โ26  Procunier, 416 U.S. at 417.  Under Procunier, those safeguards are: \n(1) notifying the intended recipient-inmate; (2) giving the author of the publication \na reasonable opportunity to protest the decision; and (3) referring complaints about \nthe decision to a prison official other than the person who originally disapproved \nthe correspondence.27  Id. at 418-19. \nPLN claims that the current review process violates Procunier because only \nthe institution that initially impounds an issue of Prison Legal News is required to \nprovide the publisher notice.   Publishers, PLN argues, are entitled to notice every \ntime a copy of an issue is impounded.  This is so even if later impoundment \ndecisions duplicate earlier determinations.  The FDOC responds that since all \nissues of Prison Legal News are alike, PLN is only entitled to one notice per issue. \n                                           \n26 Procunier addressed the due process afforded prisoners and their correspondents when \nexchanging letters.  Circuit courts have extended the due process safeguards to magazine \npublishers.  See Jacklovich v. Simmons, 392 F.3d 420, 433 (10th Cir. 2004); Montcalm Pub. \nCorp. v. Beck, 80 F.3d 105, 109 (4th Cir. 1996).  They have held that a publisherโs right to due \nprocess does not depend on notifying the inmate.  Jacklovich, 392 F.3d at 433-34. \n \n27 The FDOC seems to have abandoned its argument that Mathews v. Eldridge applies.  \n424 U.S. 319 (1976).  Even if Eldridge did apply, see Perry, 664 F.3d at 1368, it would similarly \nrequire of the FDOC the same procedural safeguards this Court sets forth in this order.  โThe \nfundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and \nin a meaningful manner.โ  Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 333.  A โmeaningful mannerโ presupposes that \nthe deprived party be provided with the information necessary to mount a meaningful challenge \nto the deprivation.  In this case, that means informing PLN of the distinct, independent bases \nupon which its magazine has been impounded.  Sharing this information is critical to reducing \nthe risk of erroneous deprivation.  Testimony about the ease of making additional copies \nsuggests that the costs of implementation are minimal.  The upshot of doing so benefits the \ngovernmentโs interest in due process of law and ensures that PLN has a meaningful opportunity \nto contest the deprivation. \n53 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 54 of 66\n   \n \nNeither party properly demarks the requirements of due process.  Procunier \ndemands that the publisher โbe given a reasonable opportunity to protestโ the \ncensorship.  Id. at 18 (emphasis added).  For an opportunity to be reasonable, the \npublisher must know of the grounds upon which the publication has been censored.  \nSee Henry J. Friendly, โSome Kind of Hearingโ, 123 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267, 1280 \n(1975) (explaining that it is โfundamentalโ to due process that โnotice be given . . . \nthat . . . clearly inform[s] the individual of the proposed action and the grounds for \nitโ).  This knowledge component of due process does not turn on whether the \npublication is the first copy or a subsequent copy.  What matters is the basis for \ncensorship.  If a subsequent impoundment decision is based on a different reason \nnot previously shared with PLN, due process requires that PLN be told of this new \nreason. \nThe FDOCโs current policy of providing notice once per issue should \ntheoretically satisfy this formulation.  Under the Rule, once one institution \nimpounds an issue of Prison Legal News, a later institution must automatically \nimpound that same issue pending a final rejection determination by the LRC.  Fla. \nAdmin. Code R. 33-501.401(8)(c).  The subsequent institution learns of the first \ninstitutionโs reasons for impoundment through a centralized database.  It must then \ninform its inmate of โthe specific reasons why the publication was impounded.โ  \n54 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 55 of 66\n   \n \nId. (emphasis added).  That is, the later institution must inform the prisoner of the \ninitial institutionโs reasons for impoundment. \nThe succeeding, perfunctory impoundment amounts to โroutine enforcement \nof a rule with general applicabilityโ because it does not raise new grounds for \ncensorship.  Livingston, 683 F.3d at 223.  The initial reasons for impoundment \nhaving been communicated to PLN, this ordinarily would not require additional \nnotice. \nDespite this mechanism, PLN has at times received multiple notices \nimpounding a specific issue of Prison Legal News on different grounds.  PLN \nexpresses uncertainty as to how this happens, since the Rule requires future \ninstitutions to replicate the first institutionโs reasoning.  ECF No. 241, at 12 n.10. \nOne explanation is that sometimes multiple institutions receive the same \nissue of Prison Legal News simultaneously.  When that happens, each institution \nthinks of itself as an initial impounding institution.  In that scenario PLN should \nreceive a notice per initial impounding institution.  But the moment these \nsimultaneous, initial impoundment decisions are disseminated throughout the \nFDOC, later institutions should cease providing independent grounds for \nexclusion. \nAnother explanation is that the Rule is not always followed.  And as a result \na subsequent impoundment is not perfunctory, but rather the product of an \n55 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 56 of 66\n   \n \nindependent determination.  See, e.g., ECF No. 241, at 11-12 (summarizing \nevidence).  Worse, FDOC has at times completely failed to inform PLN of an \nimpoundment decision, only notifying PLN of a rejection.  This means that by the \ntime PLN received notice, the LRC had already reviewed the initial impounding \ninstitutionโs decision. \nThe FDOC claims that even if its employees failed to send PLN \nimpoundment notices, it cannot be held liable because the failure is merely \nnegligent.  It cites Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986), and Davidson v. \nCannon, 474 U.S. 344 (1986), in support of the argument that โthe Due Process \nClause is simply not implicated by a negligent act of an official causing unintended \nloss of or injury to life, liberty, or property.โ  Daniels, 474 U.S. at 328.  PLN, in \nresponse, contends that Daniels only holds that the substantive deprivation must be \ncaused by conduct beyond mere negligence.  According to PLN, the failure to \nprovide noticeโthat is, the process itselfโgives rise to liability, even if the \nemployee only negligently failed to do so. \nThere seems to be a circuit split on the issue of whether Daniels is limited to \nthe substantive deprivation or whether it extends to the process itself.  In Dale E. \nFrankfurth, D.D.S., v. City of Detroit, the plaintiff brought an action under ยง 1983 \nfor damages resulting from the demolition of a building he owned.  Nos. 86-1476, \n86-1825, 1987 WL 44769, at *1(6th Cir. Sept. 17, 1987).  The Sixth Circuit, citing \n56 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 57 of 66\n   \n \nDaniels, held that the plaintiffโs โfailure to receive notice was due to the negligent \nact of a clerk.  Because the act was negligent, no fourteenth amendment \ndeprivation is involved and there is no constitutional need to provide a remedy.โ  \nId. at *3; accord Brunken v. Lance, 807 F.2d 1325, 1331 (7th Cir. 1986) \n(โ[Daniels] teaches that an official does not โdepriveโ a person of life, liberty, or \nproperty, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, when an officialโs \nnegligent act causes the unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property. . . .  \nGiven this evidence, [the defendantโs] failure to notify [the plaintiff] was at most \nnegligent.โ). \nIn contrast, the Third Circuit in Sourbeer v. Robinson limited Daniels to the \nsubstantive deprivation.  791 F.2d 1094, 1104-05 (3d Cir. 1986).  In so doing, it \nsummarized the distinction well: \nCases such as Davidson, dealing with a state of mind requirement for \nยง  1983/due  process  actions,  relate  only  to  the  highly  unusual \ncircumstance where the deprivation of life, liberty, or property the case \nis predicated upon was not intentional, as opposed to where the failure \nto provide  adequate  process  was  not  intentional.    For  example, in \nDavidson prison guards negligently failed to take action to protect one \nprisoner who was threatened by another, allegedly โdeprivingโ him of \na liberty interest in being free of assaults. . . .  In [Daniels] it was alleged \nthat a correctional deputy had negligently left a pillow on a stairway, \ncausing the plaintiff to slip and thereby โdeprivingโ him of a liberty \ninterest.  These cases, it is readily apparent, are of a highly unusual \nnatureโthe defendants had probably not even been aware until after \nthe fact of the โdeprivationsโ that would trigger due process concerns.  \nโTo hold that injury caused by such conduct is a deprivation within the \nmeaning of the Fourteenth Amendment would trivialize the centuries-\nold principle of due process of law.โ \n57 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 58 of 66\n   \n \n \nHere, in contrast, the keeping of Sourbeer in administrative custodyโ\ndepriving him of libertyโwas itself an intentional act.  That being the \ncase, it was not necessary for the district court to make any other state \nof mind finding.  We know of no authority for the proposition that an \nintentional deprivation of life, liberty or property does not give rise to \na due process violation because the failure to provide due process was \nwithout fault. \n \nId. (citations omitted).  As far as this Court or the parties can tell, the Eleventh \nCircuit has not spoken on the issue. \nThis Court believes that the Third Circuit has the better-reasoned opinion.  \nThis is particularly true here, where the relief sought is declaratory and injunctive.  \nEven supposing that the โfaultโ associated with past failures matters for recovering \ndamages against the government, an injunction pivots on the โindependent legal \nright . . . being infringed.โ  Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 424 F.3d \n1117, 1127 (11th Cir. 2005).  The right in this case implicates โthe most \nrudimentary demands of due process of lawโโnotice.  Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 \nU.S. 545, 550 (1965).  Just because past failures were the product of negligent \nconduct does not absolve the FDOC of its constitutional obligation to provide \nnotice going forward. \nIn any event, PLN has shown that the FDOCโs failure to provide notice \nexceeded negligence.  The systemic failure of FDOC personnel to provide notice \n42% of the time reveals that the failures were not coincidental.  The high failure \nrate indicates a substantial risk, one disregarded by FDOC administrators.  At the \n58 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 59 of 66\n   \n \nvery least this amounts to recklessness or gross negligence, which everyone agrees \nsuffices for a due process violation.  See Fagan v. City of Vineland, 22 F.3d 1296, \n1305 (3d Cir. 1994) (collecting cases); Burch v. Apalachee Cmty. Mental Health \nServs., Inc., 840 F.2d 797, 802 (11th Cir. 1988), affirmed sub. nom. Zinermon v. \nBurch, 494 U.S. 113 (1990) (holding allegations of actions taken willfully, \nwantonly, and with reckless disregard sufficient to state a due process claim).  See \ngenerally Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 839 (1994) (deliberate indifference is \nconscious disregard of a substantial risk). \nThis same reasoning applies to impoundment of the Prisonersโ Guerilla \nHandbook and the information packets.  The record unquestionably establishes that \nFDOC personnel failed to notify PLN on a couple of occasions that it had \nimpounded the Prisonersโ Guerilla Handbook and the information packets.  The \ninjunction is appropriate because those failures are part of the greater, widespread \npractice of not providing notice. \nBefore concluding, this Court addresses two remaining arguments.  First, the \nFDOC contends that PLN waived due process.  Mr. Wright admitted that at some \npoint PLN stopped appealing impoundment decisions.  Tr. of Trial 159:20-160:2 \n(Jan. 5, 2015).   Apparently PLN thought appealing was futile.  From this the \nFDOC concludes that it no longer had to apprise PLN of impoundment decisions \nsince, in all likelihood, PLN would not have appealed. \n59 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 60 of 66\n   \n \nThe problem with that logic is that the reasons for impounding Prison Legal \nNews vary.  Indeed, the Rule proscribes โtotal[] rejectionโ of a periodical and \nmandates that โeach issue of the subscription . . . be reviewed separately.โ  Fla. \nAdmin. Code R. 33-501.401(5).  That PLN did not appeal past impoundments does \nnot necessarily mean that it will not appeal future impoundments based on \ndifferent reasons.  The old adage that past behavior does not predict future \nperformance rings truer here, where the underlying circumstances change over \ntime. \nMore importantly, the FDOC failed to notify PLN of many impoundment \ndecisions.  Of course PLN did not appeal.  It did not know that an issue had been \ncensored, by which institution, and on what grounds.  The fact that PLN may have \nlater received a copy of an impoundment notice from an inmate is of no \nconsequence.  Notice must be timely and must set forth the basis for censorship, \nwhich many impoundment notices introduced at trial clearly did not.  Armstrong, \n380 U.S. at 552 (โ[The opportunity to be heard] must be granted at a meaningful \ntime and in a meaningful manner.โ).  Given these deficiencies, PLN did not waive \nits right to due process by failing to appeal. \nFinally, PLN asserts that the LRCโs practice of affirming an impoundment \ndecision on different or additional grounds than that found by the initial \nimpounding institution violates Procunier.  Recall that Procunier instructs that \n60 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 61 of 66\n   \n \ncertain โminimum procedural safeguardsโ must accompany the decision to censor \na periodical.  416 U.S. at 417.  PLN says that the LRCโs practice violates the third \nsafeguard requiring that complaints about a censorship decision be referred to \nsomeone other than the prison official who โoriginally disapproved the \n[publication].โ  Id. at 418-19.  PLN says that by censoring a publication on a \ndifferent or additional basis, the LRC effectively becomes the โoriginalโ decision-\nmaker.  And because no other prison official reviews the LRCโs decisions, PLN is \nleft to ask the LRC to review its own decision, in violation of Procunier. \nUnder PLNโs view, the reason for censorship determines who โoriginally \ndisapprove[s]โ the publication.  There would be a different โoriginalโ decision-\nmaker for each new reason.  But Procunier is not so specific.  It only requires that \na different prison official review the original censorship.  It says nothing about \nwhether that review must be limited to the reasons originally given. \nThis is consistent with Baker on Behalf of Baker v. Sullivan, 880 F.2d 319, \n320 (11th Cir. 1989), which PLN relies on to argue that expanding the scope of \nreview without notice violates due process.   In this case the issue never expands.  \nThe initial impounding institution is tasked with determining whether a particular \npublication violates the Rule.  The same issue that the LRC must decide. \n \n \n61 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 62 of 66\n   \n \nV \nThe Supreme Court has made it clear that โ[p]rison walls do not form a \nbarrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.โ  \nTurner, 482 U.S. at 84.  Yet these protections mean little if inmates do not \nunderstand them.28  Cue PLN.  Through its publications PLN teaches inmates their \nrights and informs them of unconstitutional prison practices.  With this knowledge \ninmates become another check to government encroachment on constitutional \nrights.  This in turn helps prison administrators correct insidious practices, ensuring \nlong-term stability.  Everyone ultimately benefits when knowledge grows from \nmore to more. \nBut the Constitution does not guarantee PLN unfettered communication with \ninmates.  That right must be balanced against the legitimate penological concerns \ninherent in running a prison system.  In this case, the FDOC requires PLN to \nconform its written communications to Rule 33-501.401(3), which censors \npublications containing certain types of advertisements.  After carefully \nconsidering the evidence presented at trial and the arguments made by the parties, \nthis Court concludes that the FDOCโs censorship of Prison Legal News under \nsubsections (3)(l) and (m) of the Rule does not violate PLNโs First Amendment \n                                           \n28 This is even more pernicious considering how prisoners are not afforded counsel and \nhow prisons limit inmatesโ access to the prison library, books, and legal materials.  \n62 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 63 of 66\n   \n \nrights because the censorship reasonably relates to public safety and prison \nsecurity. \nThat the censorship in this case complies with the First Amendment, \nhowever, does not give the FDOC license to censor without regard to its due \nprocess obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment.  But that is precisely what \nthe FDOC has done, repeatedly.  It has impounded multiple issues of Prison Legal \nNews and other PLN mail without notifying PLN.  Adhering to its regulations, it \nthen fails to notify PLN when the mail is finally rejected.  The FDOC will continue \nto do this going forward absent interjection by this Court. \nFor these reasons, \nIT IS ORDERED: \n1.  Judicial estoppel does not preclude the Florida Department of \nCorrections from adopting its current litigation position. \n2.  The Florida Department of Correctionsโ censorship of Prison Legal \nNews under Rule 33-501.401(3) of the Florida Administrative Code \ndoes not violate Prison Legal Newsโ First Amendment rights. \n3.  The Florida Department of Correctionsโ censorship procedures violate \nPrison Legal Newsโ right to due process under the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n4.  The Clerk shall enter an amended judgment stating: \n63 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 64 of 66\n   \n \nPrison Legal Newsโ First Amendment claim against the \nFlorida  Department  of  Corrections  is  dismissed  with \nprejudice. \n \nPrison Legal News successfully proved that the Florida \nDepartment of Corrections has violated its right to due \nprocess under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Prison Legal \nNews  has  also  shown  that  the  Florida  Department  of \nCorrectionsโ current censorship practices will continue to \ndeprive Prison Legal News of due process of law. \n \nAccordingly,  the  Florida  Department  of  Corrections  is \npermanently enjoined from censoring Prison Legal Newsโ \nwritten communications without due process of law.  To \ncomply with due process of law, this permanent injunction \nmodifies the Florida Department of Correctionsโ current \nnotification procedures as follows:   \n \n(1) The Florida Department of Corrections must notify \nPrison Legal News when it first impounds a particular \nwritten communication by Prison Legal News.   \n \n(2) The notification must specify the prison rule, including \nthe subsection, purportedly violated and must indicate the \nportion of the communication that allegedly violates the \ncited regulation.   \n \n(3) The Florida Department of Corrections does not have \nto notify Prison Legal News when copies of that same \nwritten  communication  are  subsequently  impounded, \nunless the subsequent impoundment decision is based on \na different or additional reason not already shared with \nPrison Legal News.   \n \n(4) If the Literature Review Committee rejects a written \ncommunication based on a different or additional reason \nnot already shared with Prison Legal News, the Florida \nDepartment of Corrections must notify Prison Legal News \nof the basis for that decision, including the specific prison \n64 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 65 of 66\n   \n \nrule violated and the portion of the communication that \nviolates the cited regulation.   \n \n(5) This injunction is not governed by the Prison Litigation \nReform Act (PLRA) because this is not a civil proceeding \nโwith  respect  to  the  conditions  of  confinement  or  the \neffects of actions by government officials on the lives of \npersons confined in prison.โ 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(g)(2).  But \neven  if  the  PLRA  did  apply,  the  Court  finds  that  the \ninjunction complies with the PLRAโs โneeds-narrowness-\nintrusivenessโ standard.  See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(1)(A). \nThe relief is narrowly drawn, as it only requires notice to \nPrison Legal News and no other party, and only requires \nnotice on a per-issue (rather than a per-copy) basis. It \nrequires compliance with the minimum requirements of \ndue process.  Similarly, the relief extends no further than \nnecessary to correct the violation of PLNโs due process \nrights.  It only requires notice to Prison Legal News and \nno other party, and only requires notice on a per-issue \n(rather than a per-copy) basis. For the same reasons, the \ninjunction is the least intrusive means necessary to correct \nthe violation of PLNโs due process rights.  Even though it \nwould be minimally burdensome to provide notice to the \npublisher every time a copy of the magazine is censored, \nthe injunction only requires notice on a per-issue basis. \nFinally,  the  Court  has  given substantial weight to any \nadverse  impact  on  public  safety  or  the  operation  of  a \ncriminal justice system caused by the injunction, and finds \nthat the injunction will have no impact on public safety \nand  almost  no  impact  on  the  Florida  Department  of \nCorrections,  as  the  injunction  essentially  requires \ncompliance with the FDOCโs own rule. \n \n \n \n \n65 \n\nCase 4:12-cv-00239-MW-CAS   Document 279   Filed 10/05/15   Page 66 of 66\n   \n \n5.
