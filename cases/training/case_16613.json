Having thoroughly reviewed the parties briefing on Plaintiff's motion to compel, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion with this text only order instead of a publishable order in order to avoid continued delay. Within 21 days of today's order, Defendant shall fully respond to the discovery requests covering the following four categories that are the subject of the motion to compel: (1) CoreCivic Financial documents; (2)Monthly staffing reports; (3)CoreCivic Policies (Policy 5-1, Incident Reporting; Policy 16-100, Phones; Policy 1-22, Internal auditing); and (4)Audit Reports. The Court finds these discovery requests seek non-privileged information that is relevant to Plaintiffs' claims and proportional to the needs of the case. The Court finds that some of Defendants' objections were substantially justified albeit ultimately unpersuasive, and the Court further finds it impossible to parse the substantially justified from the unjustified insofar as making a determination of fees and expenses. Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiffs' request for fees and expenses. Ordered by US DISTRICT JUDGE CLAY D LAND on August 23, 2021 (CDL) (Entered: 08/23/2021)"

The Court is unconvinced that the parties have made a good faith effort to resolve their discovery disputes or to at least narrow them. Accordingly, the parties are ordered to confer in good faith in another attempt to resolve and/or narrow their disagreements. They shall docket a report with the Court by 12 Noon on February 25, 2022 stating whether their good faith efforts have resolved the pending motion, and if not, the extent that such discussions have narrowed what the Court must decide. If the matters are not resolved, the Court intends to schedule an in person hearing of counsel, and upon making a decision on the motion, the Court will determine whether either side had good cause to take the positions they took, and if they did not, that side will be sanctioned, which sanctions may include payment of the opposing side's travel expenses associated with the in person hearing. In reconsidering their positions, the parties should be guided by the fundamental principle: discoverable materials shall be restricted to \"nonprivileged matter that is RELEVANT to any party's claim or defense AND PROPORTIONAL to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.\" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1). The Court expects any meaningful good faith discussion to include a thoughtful consideration of the application of these factors to the specific requests in dispute and not simply \"lawyer talk\" that cites the factors and then rationalizes a predetermined desired result.

The Court is satisfied that good cause exists to keep these documents confidential. The Court understands that Plaintiffs cited the reports in their motion for class certification. But the Court did not rely on these reports in reaching its decision on the motion for class certification. The Court also did not rely on the reports when it stated in the order lifting stay that it expected genuine fact disputes to exist on the individual named Plaintiffs' claims. So, these reports are not necessary for the public to understand any of the Court's rulings, and the Court declines to unseal them.

    "summary": "<p>On April 17, 2018, three current or former detained immigrants filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, where the case was assigned to Judge Clay D. Land. The plaintiffs sued CoreCivic, Inc., a private prison corporation that owned and operated the Stewart Detention Center (&ldquo;Stewart&rdquo;), under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1589, 1594, and 1595. The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and private counsel, alleged that the defendant operated a deprivation scheme intended to force detained immigrants to work nearly for free for the detention facility, resulting in a forced labor scheme and an economic windfall for the defendant. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant deprived detainees of basic necessities so that they were forced to work to purchase those items and threatened those who refused to work with serious harm, including deprivation of privacy, criminal prosecution, or solitary confinement. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages. They claimed violations of the TVPA and unjust enrichment under state common law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought certification of the following two classes: (1) all civil immigration detainees who performed work for CoreCivic at Stewart in the &ldquo;Volunteer Work Program&rdquo; within the past ten years, up to the date of class certification (&ldquo;Forced Labor Class&rdquo;); and (2) all civil immigration detainees who performed work for CoreCivic at Stewart in the &ldquo;Volunteer Work Program&rdquo; within the past four years, up to the date of class certification (&ldquo;Unjust Enrichment Class&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 21, 2018, CoreCivic filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; entire complaint for failure to state a claim under the TVPA, arguing that Congress did not intend the TVPA to apply to alien detainees in the lawful custody of the U.S. Government or to private contractors operating immigration detention facilities. On August 17, 2018, Judge Land denied the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss and found that the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to support both their TVPA claim and their unjust enrichment claim. Most significantly, the court found that the TVPA did apply to work programs in federal immigration detention facilities operated by private for-profit contractors. However, Judge Land certified the issue for immediate interlocutory appeal given the substantial ground for difference of opinion on this issue. 332 F.Supp.3d 1305.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendant appealed the district court&rsquo;s denial of its motion to dismiss to the Eleventh Circuit on December 12, 2018. After holding oral argument in January 2020, an Eleventh Circuit panel (Circuit Judges Frank Hull and Stanley Marcus and District Court Judge Barbara Rothstein) issued an opinion on February 28, 2020, concluding that \"the TVPA covers the conduct of private contractors operating federal immigration detention facilities.\" 951 F.3d 1269. The Eleventh Circuit further concluded that the TVPA does not bar private contractors from operating voluntary work programs for persons held in immigration detention facilities but that private contractors who operate such programs \"may be liable if they knowingly obtain or procure the labor or services of a program participant through the illegal coercive means explicitly listed in the TVPA.\" The Eleventh Circuit's review was limited only to the legal question of whether the TVPA applied to private contractors operating immigration detention facilities, so it did not address whether the plaintiffs' complaint sufficiently stated a claim under the TVPA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following the Eleventh Circuit's decision, the district court lifted the stay. In mid-June 2020, CoreCivic filed a counterclaim against the plaintiffs. The counterclaim asserted that the plaintiffs, if they were to prevail, would be unjustly enriched by any monetary damages and that, in the event damages were awarded, the court should also enter an order awarding CoreCivic all costs and expenses incurred in providing basic necessities to the plaintiffs and the putative class while they were detained. On August 7, 2020, the plaintiffs moved to dismiss CoreCivic's counterclaim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a new amended complaint on October 16, 2020. In their answer, CoreCivic reasserted their counterclaim. The plaintiffs again moved to dismiss the counterclaim. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion on March 10, 2021, finding that the defendant had failed to state a claim under Georgia law. Judge Land noted that the defendant failed to allege that they had any expectation that the plaintiffs would bear the cost of the basic necessities provided by CoreCivic during their detention, writing that \"CoreCivic&rsquo;s audacity in claiming that it should be compensated for providing basic necessities to detainees who it contracted to detain is astonishing.\" 2021 WL 6931810.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 23, 2021, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel discovery and ordered CoreCivic to fully respond to discovery requests relating to financial documents, monthly staffing reports, policies, and audit reports. Discovery continued throughout 2021 and into early 2022. On February 15, 2022, the court found that the parties had not made a good faith effort to resolve their outstanding discovery disputes and ordered the parties to meet and confer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 1, 2022, the plaintiffs moved for class certification of the Forced Labor and Unjust Enrichment Classes. On March 28, 2023, the court denied the motion for class certification, writing that not every putative class member was similarly situated with other class members, even if policies and practices existed that applied to every putative class member who chose to participate in the work program. The plaintiffs contended that class-wide evidence that proved CoreCivic knowingly established a scheme intended to coerce detainees to participate in the work program also proved that CoreCivic obtained the labor of all detainee participants &ldquo;by means of&rdquo; that scheme. The court rejected this reasoning because, while each putative class member may have been subject to the same conditions of confinement, the record did not show that those conditions were the motivating factor for the putative class member&rsquo;s decision to join the work program. Thus, the plaintiffs had not established commonality, typicality, and predominance. 2023 WL 2666852.</p>\r\n<p>On July 17, 2023, the defendants moved for partial summary judgment on the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claims and their request for declaratory and injunctive relief. The following month, on August 28, the court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The court granted summary judgment to the defendants as to the plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief because the plaintiffs conceded that these claims were moot given that they were not at Stewart anymore. The court denied summary judgment as to the unjust enrichment claims because there was evidence that an underlying contract existed, and because there was a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the plaintiffs were coerced to work for CoreCivic. However, the court limited the plaintiffs' potential damages to the value of the benefit they conferred to CoreCivic through their work. 2023 WL 5538164.</p>\r\n<p>On September 21, 2023, the plaintiffs moved again for class certification. A jury trial was scheduled for October 16, 2023, but less than three weeks before the scheduled trial, on September 29, 2023, the parties informed the court that they had reached a settlement in principle, and would soon finalize the agreement and dismiss the case.&nbsp; On October 27, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal and the case was closed.&nbsp; Although the terms of the settlement do not appear to be available in the case docket, contemporaneous news reports described settlement terms including a requirement that CoreCivil notify all detained people participating in the work program at Stewart, in English and Spanish, of their rights, including the right to refuse to work and to prompt monetary compensation, training, and safety equipment.&nbsp;</p>",

They bring this class action, asserting claims against \nCoreCivic under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (โTVPAโ), \nas  amended,  18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589,  1594-95,  and  under  Georgia  law.  \nThey allege that CoreCivic operates a โdeprivation schemeโ in which \nit forces detainees to work through threats of physical violence, \nsolitary  confinement,  and  deprivation  of  basic  necessities.  \nCoreCivic  moved  to  dismiss  the  action  (ECF  No.  30).    For  the \nfollowing reasons, CoreCivicโs motion to dismiss is denied. \n1 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 2 of 17\n \nSTANDARD \nโTo survive a motion to dismissโ under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6), โa complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to โstate a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.โโ  Ashcroft v.

Stewart has nearly 2,000 beds and is one of the largest \nimmigration detention centers in the nation.  Id. ยถ 24. \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  conditions  at  Stewart  are \ndeplorable.  The bathrooms are in poor condition.  Id. ยถ 41.  Some \nshowers have no hot water, while other showers have no cold water.  \nId.  The open dormitories house 66 people in bunk beds with no \nprivacy.  Id. ยถ 56.  Each dormitory has one bathroom with several \nsinks and toilets.  Id.  The showers in the shared bathroom do not \nhave  temperature  control.    Id.    Conflict  and  violence  occur \nfrequently in the open dormitories.  Id.  Detainees refer to the \nopen dormitories as the โChicken Coopโ because of the unsanitary \nconditions and overcrowding.  Id. \nCoreCivic does not adequately furnish detainees with basic \nhygiene products like toilet paper, soap, lotion, or toothpaste.  \nId. ยถ 42.  Instead, CoreCivic instructs detainees to buy these \nbasic  necessities  from  the  commissary.    Id.

Stewartโs โVoluntary Work Programโ \nCoreCivic  operates  a  โvoluntary  work  programโ at  Stewart.  \nId. ยถ 27.  CoreCivic assigns program participants to various jobs \nin the facility.  Id. ยถ 29.  Responsibilities include scrubbing \nbathrooms, cleaning the medical center, preparing meals, washing \ndetaineesโ laundry, and cleaning floors.  Id. ยถ 30.  CoreCivic \ngenerally pays detainees in the program between $1 and $4 per day.  \nId. ยถ 31.  CoreCivic deposits detaineesโ wages into their inmate \nfund  accounts  so  the  detainees  may  purchase  items  at  the \ncommissary.  Id. ยถ 38.   \nDetainees in the voluntary work program are spared from some \nof Stewartโs more unfavorable conditions.  Program participants \nare not housed in the Chicken Coop.  Instead, they are provided \nmore favorable living quarters with private two-person cells, a \nshared common area, a bathroom shared with only one other cellmate, \nand  a  shower  with  temperature  control.    Id.  ยถ 55.    But  when \nparticipants refuse to work, CoreCivic threatens to transfer them \nback to the Chicken Coop, id. ยถ 54, revoke their access to the \ncommissary, id. ยถ 57, transfer them to solitary confinement, id. \nยถ 59, or initiate criminal proceedings against them, id. ยถ 50.  \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  CoreCivic  maintains  deplorable \nconditions  as  part  of  a  โdeprivation  schemeโ  that  provides \n4 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 5 of 17\n \nCoreCivic with a cheap supply of labor to operate the facility, \nthereby enabling CoreCivic to increase its profits.  Id. ยถยถ 1-2, \n59-60.  According to Plaintiffs, this scheme operates as follows: \n(1) CoreCivic deprives detainees of basic necessities, including \ntoothpaste, soap, toilet paper, privacy, safety, and contact with \nloved ones; (2) detainees must participate in the voluntary work \nprogram to move to humane accommodations and to earn money to \npurchase necessities at the commissary; and (3) once detainees are \nin the program, CoreCivic threatens to harm or actually harms those \nwho refuse to work.  Id. ยถ 1.  Therefore, according to Plaintiffs, \nparticipation in the โvoluntaryโ work program is โnot โvoluntaryโ \nin any meaningful sense.โ  Id. ยถ 36. \nIII.  Named Plaintiffs \nBarrientos, Velazques-Galicia, and Ahmed either are working \nor previously worked as kitchen workers in the program.  Id. ยถยถ 62, \n78, 86.  Specifically, Barrientos alleges CoreCivic threatened to \ntransfer him to the Chicken Coop, id. ยถยถ 69-70, revoke his access \nto the commissary, id. ยถ 71, and put him in solitary confinement, \nid. ยถ 72, when he refused to work or when CoreCivic believed he \nwas organizing a work stoppage.  Velazquez-Galicia alleges that he \nwitnessed CoreCivic threaten to transfer detainees who decline to \nwork from the preferable two-person cells to the Chicken Coop.  \nId. ยถ 82.  Ahmed alleges that CoreCivic threatened to put him in \nsolitary confinement if he stopped working.  Id. ยถ 89.  He also \n5 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 6 of 17\n \nalleges that CoreCivic actually put him in solitary confinement \nfor ten days for threatening a work stoppage after he had not been \npaid.    Id. ยถ 90.    All  three  allege  that  they  participate  (or \nparticipated) in the work program because of CoreCivicโs threats \nof harm and because of CoreCivicโs deprivation scheme.  Id. ยถยถ 75, \n83, 91.  They bring this action on behalf of themselves and all \nothers  similarly  situated.    Plaintiffsโ  proposed  classes  are \nlimited to detainees who actually participate or participated in \nthe voluntary work program.  Id. \nDISCUSSION \n  Plaintiffs assert two categories of claims against CoreCivic: \n(1) civil liability for violations of the TVPA and (2) claims for \nunjust enrichment under Georgia law.  CoreCivic moved to dismiss \nall of Plaintiffsโ claims.  For the following reasons, CoreCivicโs \nmotion is denied. \nI.  TVPA Claims \nAs  to  Plaintiffsโ  TVPA  claims,  the  question  presented  is \nwhether  Plaintiffs  have  alleged  sufficient  facts  in  their \nComplaint, which if ultimately proven to be true, could subject \nCoreCivic to civil liability under the TVPA.  The TVPA provides a \nprivate cause of action against anyone: \n6 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 7 of 17\n \n(a)  Who[]  knowingly  provides  or  obtains  the  labor  or \nservices of a person by any one of, or by any combination \nof, the following meansโ \n(1)  by  means  of  force,  threats  of  force,  physical \nrestraint, or threats of physical restraint to that \nperson or another person; \n(2)  by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm \nto that person or another person; \n(3)  by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or \nlegal process; or \n(4)  by means of any scheme . . . intended to cause the \nperson  to  believe  that,  if  that  person  did  not \nperform  such  labor  or  services,  that  person  or \nanother  person  would  suffer  serious  harm  or \nphysical restraint[.] \n18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a).  The TVPA defines โserious harmโ as โany harm, \nwhether  physical  or  nonphysical,  including  psychological, \nfinancial,  or  reputational  harm,  that  is  sufficiently  serious, \nunder all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable \nperson of the same background and in the same circumstances to \nperform or to continue performing labor or services in order to \navoid incurring that harm.โ  Id. ยง 1589(c)(2). \nCoreCivic contends that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under \nthe TVPA because Congress did not intend the statute to apply to \nlawfully held detainees.  In the alternative, CoreCivic argues \nthat Plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim \nunder  the  โabuse  of  legal  processโ  prong.    Id.  ยง 1589(a)(3).  \nFinally,  CoreCivic  contends  that  Plaintiffsโ  TVPA  claims  for \n7 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 8 of 17\n \nconduct prior to December 23, 2008 are barred.  These arguments \nare addressed in turn. \nA.  Plaintiffs Stated Claims under the Plain Language of the \nTVPA  \nCoreCivic argues that the TVPA is intended to apply narrowly \nto forced labor in the human trafficking context and that applying \nit  to  detainee  work  programs  is  โabsurdโ  and  contrary  to  the \nintentions  of  Congress.    CoreCivicโs  argument  has  superficial \nappeal and some support from the TVPAโs legislative history.  But \nit  ignores  the  plain  language  of  the  statute.    It  also \nmisunderstands  โthe  absurdity  doctrine,โ  which  is  a  narrow \nexception  to  the  fundamental  principle  that  statutory \ninterpretation  must  be  anchored  to  the  plain  language  of  the \nstatute.  \nCoreCivic  points  to  evidence  of  congressional  intent  in \nsupport of its position.  See 22 U.S.C. ยง 7101 (setting forth the \ncongressional  purposes  and  findings  regarding  the  TVPA);  id. \nยง 7101(a) (โThe purposes of this chapter are to combat trafficking \nin persons, a contemporary manifestation of slavery whose victims \nare predominantly women and children, to ensure just and effective \npunishment of traffickers, and to protect their victims.โ).  But \nwhen interpreting a statute, the Court must presume that Congress \nsays what it means and means what it says.  Conn. Natโl Bank v. \nGermain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54 (1992).  If Congress intended the \n8 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 9 of 17\n \nTVPA to apply narrowly to human traffickers or human trafficking-\nrelated labor only, it could have easily limited ยง 1589 or ยง 1595 \nto those circumstances by saying so in those sections of the Act.  \nCongress  placed  no  such  restriction  in  the  statute  but  chose \ninstead to broadly prohibit โwhoeverโ from โobtain[ing] laborโ by \nany of the proscribed means.  18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a).  The Court thus \ndeclines to read an implied exclusion for lawfully confined victims \ninto the statute.  Of course, the lawful force necessary to detain \nthe  detainees  cannot  be  the  source  for  the  TVPA  claims.    But \nPlaintiffs allege that although they may be lawfully detained, \nthey cannot be forced to labor in violation of the TVPA.1 \nTo the extent CoreCivic relies on the โabsurdity doctrineโ as \nan exception to the fundamental principle that courts must apply \nstatutes as written, the Court finds that this exception does not \napply here.  The โabsurdity doctrineโ can be traced back to the \nEnglish common law.  As Blackstone explained in his Commentaries, \nโ[W]here  words  bear . . . a  very  absurd  signification,  if \nliterally understood, we must a little deviate from the received \nsense of them.โ  William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of \nEngland ยง 2, at 60 (4th ed. 1770).  As understood in the English \ncommon law: โ[I]n construing . . . all written instruments, the \n                     \n1 CoreCivic points to other textual โcluesโ that bolster its position \nthat the statute did not intend to apply to immigrant detainees.  But \nthese textual clues from other statutes do nothing to undermine the plain \nlanguage of the TVPA. \n9 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 10 of 17\n \ngrammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, \nunless that would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or \ninconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the \ngrammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified so as \nto avoid that absurdity and inconsistency, but no farther.โ  Grey \nv. Pearson, (1857) 10 Eng. Rep. 1216, 1234; 6 H.L. Cas. 61, 106 \n(Lord Wensleydale). \nThe absurdity doctrine, however, does not authorize โjudicial \nrevision of public and private texts to make them (in the judgeโs \nview) more reasonable.โ  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 237 (2012).  To avoid such \njudicial  mischief,  the  doctrine  has  two  limiting  conditions: \n(1) โ[t]he  absurdity  must  consist  of  a  disposition  that  no \nreasonable person could intend;โ and (2) โ[t]he absurdity must be \nreparable by changing or supplying a particular word or phrase \nwhose  inclusion  or  omission  was  obviously  a  technical  or \nministerial error.โ  Id. at 237-38.  The drafterโs failure to fully \nappreciate the effect of a plainly written statute does not bring \nit within the absurdity doctrine.  Id. at 238. \nCoreCivic points to no particular word or phrase in the TVPA \nthat it claims must be corrected.  Instead, it argues that the \nstatute  does  not  apply  to  persons  who  are  held  lawfully  as \ndetainees by the government.  It relies upon no language in the \nstatute for this broad assertion.  It simply points to legislative \n10 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 11 of 17\n \nhistory outlining the motivation for the enactment of the statute.  \nThus, it asks the Court rewrite the statute by effectively adding \na provision stating, โthis statute shall not apply to anyone who \nuses labor of detainees who are lawfully detained pursuant to a \ncontract with a governmental agency.โ  The absurdity doctrine does \nnot authorize the Court to re-draft a statute.  CoreCivic may find \nit absurd that Congress drafted the TVPA in such a way that it \ntheoretically  reaches  the  conduct  alleged  here.    And  one  can \nspeculate that Congress did not foresee the application of its \nplain  language  to  these  circumstances.    But  this  Court  cannot \nrewrite statutes to avoid what it may perceive to be an unintended \nconsequence or even an absurd public policy result.  Congress is \nalone responsible for any such absurdities and lack of legislative \nforesight.  Moreover, the Constitution gives it the exclusive power \nto fix them. \nThe Courtโs ruling today that Plaintiffs have stated a claim \nfor  relief  under  the  TVPA  certainly  does  not  mean  they  will \nultimately  prevail.    They  must  of  course  still  prove  their \nallegations.  And in doing so, they will be required to point to \nevidence that supports the reasonable conclusion that CoreCivic \nthreatened them with a serious risk of harm if they did not persist \nas laborers.  That burden will be a heavy one.  But they have today \n11 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 12 of 17\n \nplausibly stated such allegations to overcome CoreCivicโs motion \nto dismiss.2 \nB.  Plaintiffs  Alleged  Sufficient  Facts  to  State  a Claim \nunder ยง 1589(a)(3) \nCoreCivic  alternatively  contends  that  Plaintiffs  have  not \nplausibly  alleged  that  CoreCivic  obtained  their  labor  through \nactual or threatened abuse of the legal process under ยง 1589(a)(3).  \nUnder the statute, โ[t]he term โabuse or threatened abuse of the \nlegal processโ means the use or threatened use of a law or legal \nprocess, whether administrative, civil, or criminal, in any manner \nor for any purpose for which the law was not designed, in order to \nexert pressure on another person to cause that person to take some \naction  or  refrain  from  taking  some  action.โ  \n18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(c)(1).    According  to  the  Complaint,  CoreCivic \nprovided  each  detainee  with  a  โdetainee  orientation  handbook,โ \nwhich explains that refusing to work or organizing a work stoppage \nis punishable by initiation of criminal proceedings.  Compl. ยถ 50.  \nAnd  Plaintiffs  clearly  allege  that  CoreCivic  threatened  to \n                     \n2  CoreCivic  does  not  argue  that  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  allege  a \nsufficient threat of harm under the TVPA.  Thus, the Court leaves for \nanother day whether Plaintiffs must prove that the conditions in the \nChicken Coop do not meet the constitutional conditions of confinement \nstandard in order to show a serious threat of harm for TVPA purposes.  \nFor  prison  conditions  of  confinement  claims,  deprivations  must  be \nobjectively and sufficiently serious or extreme such that they constitute \na  denial  of  the  โminimal  civilized  measure  of  lifeโs  necessities.โ  \nThomas v. Bryant, 614 F.3d 1288, 1304 (11th Cir. 2010).  The same standard \napplies in the pretrial detainee context.  Keith v. Dekalb Cty., 749 \nF.3d 1034, 1044 n.35 (11th Cir. 2014).  \n12 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 13 of 17\n \ninitiate  criminal  proceedings  against  detainees  when  detainees \nrefused to work.  Id. ยถ 111.  If discovery reveals that CoreCivic \nmade no such threats, then summary judgment will be proper.  But \nat this stage, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged a claim under the \nโlegal processโ prong of the TVPA. \nC.  Plaintiffs  Stated  TVPA  Claims  for  Conduct  Prior  to \nDecember 23, 2008 \nWhen Congress first enacted the TVPA in 2000, it did not \nauthorize  a  private  right  of  action  for  violation  of  its \nprovisions.  See generally Victims of Trafficking and Violence \nProtection  Act  of  2000,  Pub.  L.  No.  106-386,  114  Stat.  1464.  \nCongress amended the TVPA in 2003 to provide a private right of \naction  against  โperpetratorsโ  of  TVPA  violations.    Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-\n193, 117 Stat. 2875.  Congress amended the TVPA again in December \n2008 to expand the class of individuals against whom a private \nright of action could be brought.  After the 2008 amendments, a \nplaintiff could bring a TVPA claim not only against โperpetrators,โ \nbut  also  against  โwhoever  knowingly  benefitsโ  financially  or \notherwise from a scheme they knew or should have known violated \nthe  TVPA.    William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044. \nCoreCivic characterizes Plaintiffsโ TVPA claims as arising \nexclusively under this โfinancial benefitโ prong of the TVPAโs \n13 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 14 of 17\n \nprivate  right  of  action  provision.    See  18 U.S.C. ยง 1595(a).  \nTherefore, it contends that Plaintiffs cannot state a TVPA claim \nfor conduct prior to December 23, 2008 (the date Congress expanded \nthe TVPAโs private right of action).  But Plaintiffsโ Complaint \narguably alleges a cause of action against CoreCivic as both a \nperpetrator  and  as  a  financial  beneficiary.    See  Compl.  ยถ 104 \n(โPlaintiffs  are  authorized  to  bring  this  [TVPA] \nclaim . . . because CoreCivic violated the forced labor provisions \nof [ยง 1589].โ); id. ยถ 105 (โPlaintiffs . . . also are authorized \nto  bring  this  [TVPA]  claim . . . because  CoreCivic  knowingly \nbenefitted  financiallyโ  from  the  deprivation  scheme  (emphasis \nadded)).    Therefore,  to  the  extent  Plaintiffsโ  TVPA  claim  is \npremised  on  CoreCivic  actually  perpetrating  TVPA  violations  as \nopposed  to  only  benefitting  financially  from  violations,  this \nclaim  may  encompass  conduct  as  early  as  2003,  subject  to  the \napplicable statute of limitations.  But CoreCivic cannot be liable \nfor only knowingly benefitting from the deprivation scheme until \nafter December 23, 2008.3 \n                     \n3 The Court notes that Plaintiffsโ proposed TVPA class is defined as all \nparticipants in the voluntary work program โwithin the past ten years \nup to the date the class is certified.โ  Compl. ยถ 94(a).  Plaintiffs \nfiled this action on April 17, 2018.  And the Court has not yet certified \nthe class.  Therefore, unless the class is certified before December 23 \nof this year, Plaintiffsโ TVPA claims will effectively be limited to \nconduct occurring after the 2008 amendments anyway. \n14 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 15 of 17\n \nII.  Unjust Enrichment Claims \nPlaintiffs  assert  claims  under  Georgia  law  for  unjust \nenrichment.  โThe concept of unjust enrichment in law is premised \nupon the principle that a party cannot induce, accept, or encourage \nanother to furnish or render something of value to such party and \navoid  payment  for  the  value  received.โ    Vernon  v.  Assurance \nForensic Accounting, LLC, 774 S.E.2d 197, 212 (Ga. Ct. App. 2015) \n(quoting Jones v. White, 717 S.E.2d322, 328 (Ga. Ct. App. 2011)) \n(explaining  that  for  purposes  of  an  unjust  enrichment  claim \nconferring a โbenefitโ means providing โany form of advantageโ \neven if it was not โearnedโ); see also Reynolds v. CB&T, 805 S.E.2d \n472,  478-79  (Ga.  Ct.  App.  2017)  (reversing  grant  of  summary \njudgment on unjust enrichment claim based upon lender inducing \nborrower  to  finish  construction  of  home  and  nevertheless \nforeclosing on the home when construction complete).  Although \nmost unjust enrichment claims are based on the party being induced \ninto some transaction with a reasonable expectation of receiving \nsomething in return, the Georgia courts have recognized that an \nunjust enrichment claim can be based on allegations of coercion.  \nSee Estate of Crook v. Foster, 775 S.E.2d 286, 287-90 (Ga. Ct. \nApp. 2015) (reversing trial courtโs grant of summary judgment on \nunjust enrichment claim where plaintiff claimed defendant coerced \nher into putting defendantโs name on deed).   \n15 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 16 of 17\n \nHere,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  CoreCivic  coerced  them  to \nprovide labor to CoreCivic, that CoreCivic benefitted from that \nlabor, and that CoreCivic should compensate Plaintiffs for the \nbenefit they conferred on CoreCivic because allowing CoreCivic to \nkeep that benefit would be unjust.  The Court cannot say that \nGeorgia would not recognize an unjust enrichment claim under these \ncircumstances.    Accordingly,  CoreCivicโs  motion  to  dismiss \nPlaintiffsโ unjust enrichment claims is denied. \nCONCLUSION \nBased on the foregoing, CoreCivicโs motion to dismiss (ECF \nNo. 30) is denied.   \nCERTIFICATE FOR IMMEDIATE APPEAL \n  Whether  the  TVPA  applies  to  work  programs  in  federal \nimmigration detention facilities operated by private for-profit \ncontractors is a controlling question of law as to which there is \nsubstantial ground for difference of opinion.  The Court today \nfinds that the TVPA does apply under the circumstances alleged in \nPlaintiffsโ  Complaint.    This  determination  thus  allows  this \nlitigation to proceed which will not only involve extensive fact \ndiscovery but also class certification proceedings.  If the Courtโs \nconclusion is wrong and the primary (maybe only) basis for federal \njurisdiction is removed, these subsequent proceedings will have \nbeen for naught.  Therefore, an immediate appeal may materially \nadvance the ultimate termination of the litigation.  Of course, if \n16 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 38   Filed 08/17/18   Page 17 of 17\n \ntodayโs order is affirmed, these proceedings will have arguably \nbeen unnecessarily delayed.  But given the nature of the issue to \nbe decided on appeal and the implications of todayโs ruling, the \nundersigned  is  of  the  opinion  that  an  immediate  appeal  is \nappropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b).  All proceedings in \nthis Court are stayed pending resolution of any application for \ninterlocutory appeal. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED, this 17th day of August, 2018. \nS/Clay D. Land \nCLAY D.

See, e.g., William Finnegan, The Deportation Machine, The New Yorker (Apr. \n22, 2013), https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/29/the-deportation-machine (reporting on the \ncase of Mark Lyttle, a U.S. Citizen who was wrongfully detained in Stewart and deported to Mexico). \n  1\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 2 of 34\n   \n \nsoapโand contact with loved onesโso that they have to work in order to purchase those items \nand costly phone cards at CoreCivicโs commissary. CoreCivic then threatens detained immigrants \nwho refuse to work with serious harm, including changing their housing unit assignment to living \nquarters that are less safe, sanitary, or private, or that are more restrictive or isolating, referral for \ncriminal prosecution, and, ultimately, the sensory and psychological deprivation of their humanity \nresulting from solitary confinement. Under these circumstances, no labor is voluntaryโit is forced.  \n2.  CoreCivicโs deprivation scheme ensures that the individuals detained in Stewart \nprovide the billion-dollar corporation with a ready supply of available labor needed to operate the \nfacility. Detained immigrants mop, sweep, and wax floors; scrub toilets and showers; wash dishes; \ndo laundry; clean medical facilities; and cook and prepare food and beverages daily for the nearly \n2,000 individuals locked inside Stewart. For this labor, CoreCivic pays detained immigrants \nbetween $1 and $4 per day and occasionally slightly more for double shifts. When CoreCivic needs \nโvolunteersโ to work double shifts in the kitchen or to work more than five days per week, as it \noften does to run Stewart, it employs a policy of threatening detained immigrants until they \ncomply. Under no circumstances does CoreCivic pay the detained immigrant workers anything \nclose to the federal minimum wage.  \n3.  Plaintiffs are former detained immigrants who were forced to work for CoreCivic \nat Stewart. Individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs bring this class \naction lawsuit to end CoreCivicโs forced labor scheme and remedy the unjust enrichment resulting \nfrom CoreCivicโs illegal labor practices.  \n  2\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 3 of 34\n   \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 because \nthis action arises under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act,2 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589, 1594, and \n1595. \n5.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act \nof 2005, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(d), because at least one class member is of diverse citizenship from one \ndefendant; there are over 100 class members; and the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds \n$5,000,000. \n6.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2) because the events or \nomissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. \n7.  This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  CoreCivic  because  the  corporation \nregularly conducts business in and has sufficient minimum contacts with the Middle District of \nGeorgia. \n8.  Plaintiffs request that this Court exercise supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367 over their state law claim of unjust enrichment. \n \n2 The Trafficking Victims Protection Act was enacted in 2000, see Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1486 \n(2000), and has been amended on multiple occasions since then. See, e.g., Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2003, Pub. L.

Plaintiffs \n9.  Plaintiff  Wilhen  Hill  Barrientos  was  detained  at  Stewart  when  the  original \nComplaint in this action was filed. See Doc. 1. Mr. Barrientos is a citizen of Guatemala and a U.S. \nLawful Permanent Resident. He was detained at Stewart intermittently between July 2015 and \nJune 2018. When the original Complaint was filed, he was working for CoreCivic as a kitchen \nworker and was generally paid between $1 and $4 per day as part of the โVoluntary Work \nProgram.โ When CoreCivic required him to work twelve hours or more in one day, he made up to \n$8 per day.  \n10.  Plaintiff Gonzalo Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez was detained at Stewart from approximately \nMay 2019 to January 2020. Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez is a citizen of Mexico and a U.S. Lawful \nPermanent Resident. While detained at Stewart, Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez worked for CoreCivic as \na kitchen worker and was paid $4 per day as part of the โVoluntary Work Program.โ   \n11.  Plaintiff Keysler Ramรณn Urbina Rojas was detained at Stewart between 2016 and \n2017. Mr. Urbina Rojas is a citizen of Nicaragua. He is seeking asylum in the United States, and \nhis  application  remains  pending.  While  detained  at  Stewart,  Mr.  Urbina  Rojas  worked  for \nCoreCivic as a kitchen worker and was paid $3 or $4 per day as part of the โVoluntary Work \nProgram.โ \nB.  Defendant \n12.  Defendant CoreCivic, formerly the Corrections Corporation of America, is a for-\nprofit  corporation  providing  correctional  and  detention  services.  CoreCivic  is  a  Maryland \ncorporation operating under federal tax laws as a Real Estate Investment Trust (โREITโ), with its \n  4\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 5 of 34\n   \n \nprincipal office at 5501 Virginia Way, Brentwood, Tennessee 37027. CoreCivic owns and operates \nStewart, where Plaintiffs were detained, at 146 CCA Road, Lumpkin, Georgia 31815. \n13.  At all relevant times, CoreCivic owned and operated Stewart under contract with \nStewart County, Georgia (โStewart Countyโ). Stewart County maintains an Intergovernmental \nService Agreement (โIGSAโ) with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (โICEโ) to detain \nimmigrants on behalf of ICE. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Immigration Detention is Civil, Not Criminal.  \n14.  Each year, hundreds of thousands of individuals are locked up in civil immigration \ndetention  facilities  while  awaiting  immigration  or  citizenship  status  determinations.  Those \ndetained include U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (green card holders) with longstanding \nfamily  and  community  ties,  children,  pregnant  women,  asylum  seekers,  victims  of  human \ntrafficking, and survivors of torture. Some detained immigrants were brought to the United States \nas children. And thousands ultimately have their United States citizenship or legal residency \naffirmed by an immigration court or federal judge. \n15.  Immigration violations are civil violations, and immigration detention is civil in \nnature.3 Many detained immigrants have no criminal history at all.  \n16.  Notwithstanding  immigration  detentionโs  civil  nature  and  purpose,  detained \nimmigrants are subjected to prison-like conditions at Stewart. According to Dora Schriro, former \nhead of ICEโs Office of Detention Policy and Planning, most detained immigrants are heldโ\n \n3 See, e.g., INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984) (โA deportation proceeding is a purely \ncivil action to determine eligibility to remain in this country, not to punish an unlawful entryโ); see also \nFong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 728-30 (1893) (observing that deportation proceedings \nhave โall the elements of a civil caseโ and are โin no proper sense a trial and sentence for a crime or \noffenseโ); see Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952).  \n  5\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 6 of 34\n   \n \nsystematically and unnecessarilyโunder punitive circumstances inappropriate for immigration \ndetentionโs noncriminal purposes.4 Detained immigrants are frequently subjected to punitive and \nlong-term solitary confinement, inadequate medical care, sexual and physical assault, lack of \naccess to counsel, and other harsh conditions of confinement; all without a right to a speedy trial, \na jury, a government-appointed lawyer, or a duly-entered conviction. \n17.  Many detained immigrants accede to deportation simply to escape intolerable \nconditions of confinement, even when they have valid claims to remain in the United States, \nincluding claims for asylum or other discretionary relief.  \nB.  The  Privatization  of  Immigration  Detention  and  CoreCivicโs  Economic \nWindfall. \n \n18.  Immigration detention expanded almost tenfold over the past twenty-five years, \nfrom a capacity of 5,532 detention beds in 19945 to an average daily population surpassing 50,000 \nin the fall of 2019.6  \n \n \n4 See Dora Schriro, Immigration Detention Overview and Recommendations 2-3. 21(U.S. Depโt of \nHomeland Sec., Immigration and Customs Enforcement) (Oct. 6, 2009), \nhttps://www.ice.gov/doclib/about/offices/odpp/pdf/ice-detention-rpt.pdf. \n5 Caitlin Patler and Tanya Maria Golash-Boza, The Fiscal and Human Costs of Imm.

CoreCivic has a financial interest in the detention of immigrants and is more \nprofitable when its detains more people. A substantial portion of its revenue is based on per diem \npayments from government clients based on daily occupancy rates. CoreCivicโs facility operating \ncosts  are  relatively  fixed  despite  occupancy  rates;  therefore,  when  occupancy  rates  drop, \nCoreCivicโs revenues and profits decline.10  \n22.  CoreCivicโs 2019 revenues were approximately $1.981 billion,11 and its stock is \npublicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, with a market capitalization of approximately \n$944 million.12  \n23.  Detention centers for which CoreCivic designated ICE as its โprimary customerโ \naccounted for 29% of CoreCivicโs total revenues in 2019 ($579.4 million).13 CoreCivic officials \nexpect these lucrative immigration detention contracts to account for a significant percentage of \nthe corporationโs ongoing revenues.14  \n \n10 CoreCivic Inc., Annual Report (Form 10-K) at 37 (Feb. 20, 2020), \nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1070985/000156459020005570/cxw-10k_20191231.htm. \n[hereinafter โCoreCivic 10-Kโ].  \n11 Id. at 61. \n12 CoreCivic Inc.

As part of its immigration detention enterprise, CoreCivic owns and operates the \nStewart Detention Center.  \n25.  With at least 2,000 beds, Stewart is one of the largest immigration detention centers \nin the nation. Between fiscal year 2001 and August 2020, more deportation proceedings began in \nStewart than all but two other immigration detention centers in the country.15  \n26.  Pursuant to the IGSA between ICE and Stewart County, ICE pays the County \n$62.03 per detained immigrant per day.16 Under its 2006 contract with CoreCivic, however, the \nCounty keeps only 85 cents per detained immigrant per day for its โadministrative costs.โ The \nrest of the money from ICE goes to CoreCivic. In 2016, CoreCivicโs revenue from Stewart was \n \n15 State and County Details on Deportation Proceedings in Immigration Court, Transactional Records \nAccess Clearinghouse (โTRACโ) (Aug. 2020), http://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/nta/ . \n16 Detention Facility Reports: Transfers, TRAC, http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/detention/tran.shtml (last \nvisited Oct. 13, 2020).  \n  9\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 10 of 34\n   \n \napproximately $38 million.17 By contrast, the Countyโs revenue from Stewart was $589,052 for \nthe same year.18  \n27.  CoreCivicโs economic windfall, and the profitability of its immigration detention \nenterprise, arises from its corporate scheme, plan, and pattern of systemically withholding basic \nnecessities from detained immigrants to ensure a readily available, captive labor force that cleans, \nmaintains, and operates its facilities for subminimum wages under threat of solitary confinement, \ncriminal prosecution, and other sanctions. Without this nearly free labor, CoreCivicโs windfall \nfrom immigrant detention would be substantially decreased. \nC.  CoreCivic  Uses  Detained  Immigrants  to  Clean,  Maintain,  and  Operate \nStewart. \n \n27.  CoreCivic operates a so-called Voluntary Work Program (โWork Programโ) at \nStewart. Through this program, CoreCivic uses detained immigrants to perform work that directly \ncontributes to institutional operations. \n28.  The  Performance  Based  National  Detention  Standards  (โPBNDSโ),  issued  as \nguidance  by  ICE,  delegate  the  site-specific  rules  for  each  Work  Program  to  the  โfacility \nadministratorโ but mandate, inter alia, that each Work Program comply with the PBNDS; that all \nwork, other than personal housekeeping, be voluntary and not required; that compensation be โat \nleast $1.00 (USD) per dayโ; and that work be limited to 8 hours per day, 40 hours per week.19  \n \n17 See Robin Urevich, Deadly Detention: Hell in the Middle of a Pine Forest, Capital and Main (Mar. 14, \n2018), https://capitalandmain.com/deadly-detention-hell-middle-pine-forest-0314. \n18 Stewart County, Georgia, Fin.

In the course of their labor for CoreCivic, detained immigrants in the Work \nProgram perform a wide range of work, including but not limited to: \na.  Scrubbing bathrooms, showers, toilets, and windows; \n \n20 CoreCivic, Detainee Orientation Handbook, Stewart Det. Ctr. 14 (2016) [hereinafter โStewart Detainee \nHandbookโ]. \n  11\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 12 of 34\n   \n \nb.  Cleaning and maintaining CoreCivicโs on-site medical center;  \nc.  Cleaning patient rooms and medical staff offices; \nd.  Sweeping, mopping, stripping, and waxing floors; \ne.  Washing detained immigrantsโ laundry; \nf.  Preparing, cooking, and serving meals; \ng.  Washing dishes; \nh.  Cleaning the kitchen and cafeteria before and after meals; \ni.  Performing clerical work for CoreCivic;  \nj.  Providing barber services to detained immigrants; \nk.  Cleaning intake areas and solitary confinement units; and \nl.  Cleaning and maintaining recreational areas. \n31.  CoreCivic  pays  detained  immigrants  who  participate  in  the  Work  Program \ngenerally between $1 and $4 per day. CoreCivic occasionally increases the wage rate it pays to \nkitchen workers to up to $8 per day when it needs workers to work twelve hours or more per day. \nUnder no circumstances does CoreCivic pay the detained immigrants the federal minimum wage \nof $7.25 per hour, or the Service Contract Act wages governing the jobs they perform. In fact, the \ndetained immigrantsโ wages generally are well under $1 per hour. \n32.  The Work Program allows CoreCivic to avoid recruiting from the local labor \nmarket, paying legally mandated wages, providing detained immigrants in the Work Program with \nany benefits, paying the costs of potential unionization, and paying federal and state payroll taxes, \nlike Medicare, thereby reducing operational costs and increasing its own profits. Further, it reduces \n  12\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 13 of 34\n   \n \nthe likelihood of former employees acting as whistleblowers regarding the deplorable and unsafe \nconditions inside Stewart.21 \n33.  Stewart County has one of the highest poverty rates among all Georgia counties. \nWith a population of roughly 6,600, nearly 40% of families live below the poverty level.22 The \nCountyโs average unemployment rate in July 2020 was 6.7%.23 The median household income is \n$25,385.24 Ninety-five percent of children in Stewart County public schools are reportedly eligible \nfor free or reduced-price meal programs.25 \n34.  According to CoreCivic, it employs around 300 people at Stewart, outside of the \nWork Program,26 only 96 of whom were Stewart County residents as of 2018.27 CoreCivic fills a \nsubstantial number of jobs at Stewart with detained immigrants in the Work Program who work \nfor nearly free.  \n35.  While CoreCivic profits handsomely from the labor of detained immigrants locked \ninside Stewart, the company locks out many Stewart County residents from jobs and the economic \ngrowth and prosperity that comes with fair-paying work. \n \n21 See, e.g., Urevich, supra note 17. \n22 U.S. Census Bureau, Stewart Cty., Ga., Quick Facts, \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/stewartcountygeorgia/IPE120219 (last visited Oct. 13, \n2020). \n23 Ga.

CoreCivic Withholds Necessary Care from Detained Immigrants at Stewart.  \n \n36.  Despite  its  name,  the  โVoluntary  Work  Programโ  is  not  โvoluntaryโ  in  any \nmeaningful sense. CoreCivic maintains a corporate scheme, plan, and pattern at Stewart of \ndepriving detained  immigrants with basic necessities; outside contact with loved ones; and \nthreatening them with serious harm, isolation, and criminal prosecution. As a result, detained \nimmigrants are forced to submit to CoreCivicโs labor scheme in order to buy necessities from the \ncommissary (including food, hygiene products, and phone cards) and to avoid solitary confinement \nand other sanctions. \n37.  CoreCivic owns and operates the commissary inside Stewart. The commissary is \nthe only place at Stewart where detained immigrants can purchase necessities, including hygiene \nproducts, clothes, food, and phone cards. Under corporate policy, CoreCivic is required to use any \nprofits  or  interest  earned  from  the  commissary  towards  welfare  expenditures  for  detained \nimmigrants.  \n38.  CoreCivic contracts with Trinity Services Group, Inc. (โTrinityโ) to provide food \nservices at Stewart. Through Trinity as its agent, CoreCivic fails to provide adequate food to \ndetained individuals at Stewart. \n39.  Detained immigrants must use funds from their โinmate fund accountโ to make \npurchases at the commissary. All of the detained immigrantsโ wages from the Work Program are \ndeposited into this account.  \n40.  When  detained  immigrants  in  the  Work  Program  make  purchases  at  the \ncommissary, they are giving their wages directly back to CoreCivic in a โcompany storeโ scenario. \nThis scenario is compounded by CoreCivicโs scheme, plan, and pattern of intentionally depriving \n  14\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 15 of 34\n   \n \ndetained immigrants of basic necessities, such as hygiene products, that can only be purchased at \nthe commissary. \n41.  CoreCivicโs  scheme  of  intentionally  depriving  detained  immigrants  of  basic \nnecessities and its failure to meet federal standards concerning housing, food, and hygiene products \nis well-documented.28  \n42.  According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Inspector \nGeneral (OIG), Stewart has โbathrooms that were in poor condition, including mold and peeling \npaint on walls, floors, and showers.โ29 Some bathrooms at Stewart lack hot water, while some \nshowers lack cold water.30  \n43.  The OIG has also found that Stewart fails to provide โbasic hygienic products, such \nas toilet paper, shampoo, soap, lotion, and toothpaste . . . promptly or at all when detainees ran out \nof them.โ31 Officers instruct detained immigrants to buy these necessities from the commissary \nwhen they run out.32 \n \n28 See Ben Norton, Privatized For-Profit Imm.

The same report from the OIG observes that Stewart stores โspoiled, wilted, and \nmoldy produce and other food in kitchen refrigerators, as well as food past its expiration date.โ33 \nOther food safety issues, according to the federal government, include โexpired frozen food, \nincluding meat, and thawing meat without labels indicating when it had begun thawing or the date \nby which it must be used.โ34 \n45.  In addition to depriving detained immigrants of basic necessities like safe and \nsufficient food and hygienic products, CoreCivic has a scheme, plan, and pattern of depriving \ndetained immigrants of outside contact with loved ones to compel detained immigrants to work in \norder to purchase costly phone cards from the commissary. \n46.  Stewart is geographically isolated and isolating for detained immigrants. It is \noutside the town of Lumpkin, Georgia, which has a population of 1,142 (not including the detained \nimmigrants).35 It is a two and one-half hour drive from Atlanta, Georgia. The people able to make \nthe trip to the detention center to visit a loved one are limited to non-contact visits. They must view \neach other through a plate glass window and speak through a closed-circuit telephone. These visits \nare limited to an hour.  \n47.  Other companies provide phone services for detained immigrants at Stewart. These \ncompanies provide the only way for detained immigrants to call anyone outside the detention \ncenter, except for pre-scheduled legal calls. The phone companies take advantage of this monopoly \nby charging excessively high rates for detained immigrants to make telephone calls.  Therefore, \nmost detained immigrants cannot speak with family members for more than a few minutes every \n \n33 Id. at 8 (reporting on Stewart and three other facilities). \n34 Id.

On information and belief, companies that have provided phone \nservices at Stewart include Talton Communications, Inc., Global Tel-Link Corporation, and \nSecurus Technologies.  \n48.  Detained immigrants must purchase phone cards at the commissary to make outside \ncalls. Many detained immigrants submit to the Work Program to purchase these costly phone cards \nso they can maintain contact with loved ones.36  \nE.  CoreCivic Threatens to Put Detained Immigrants in Solitary Confinement, \nAmong Other Sanctions, for Refusing to Work. \n \n49.  CoreCivic maintains a corporate scheme, plan, and pattern at Stewart of threatening \ndetained immigrants who refuse to work, organize a work stoppage, or participate in a work \nstoppage with โsegregationโ (i.e., solitary confinement), criminal prosecution, downgrading the \ndetained immigrantsโ housing, and/or revoking access to the commissary, among other sanctions. \n50.  CoreCivicโs  Stewart  Detainee  Orientation  Handbook,  which  every  individual \ndetained at Stewart receives upon entry, categorizes โ[e]ncouraging others to participate in a work \nstoppage or to refuse to work,โ as a High Offense category, the second-highest offense category. \nAs a result, encouraging others to participate in a work stoppage is punishable by, inter alia: \na.  โInitiat[ion] [of] criminal proceedingsโ; \nb.  โDisciplinary Segregation (Up to 30 days)โ; \nc.  โLoss of privileges: commissary, movies, recreation, etc.โ; and \nd.   โChang[ing] housingโ or โRestrict[ion] to housing unit.โ37  \n \n36 Imprisoned Justice, at 30-31. \n37 Stewart Detainee Handbook, at 31-32. \n  17\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 18 of 34\n   \n \n51.  CoreCivic maintains a corporate scheme, plan, and pattern at Stewart of threatening \nPlaintiffs and Class Members who refuse to work with โinitiat[ing] criminal proceedingsโ against \nthem, which constitutes a threatened abuse of the legal process. \n52.  CoreCivicโs overuse of disciplinary measures such as solitary confinement at \nStewart is well-documented.38 \n53.  The OIG has expressed โconcerns about a lack of professionalism and inappropriate \ntreatment of detainees by facility staff, which fostered a culture of disrespect and disregard for \ndetaineesโ basic rights.โ39 Detained immigrants have been โdisciplined, including being segregated \nor locked down in their cells, without adequate documentation in the detaineeโs file to justify the \ndisciplinary action.โ40  \n54.  In June 2017, officials at Stewart held a detained immigrant in solitary confinement \nfor nearly 30 days for allegedly encouraging others to participate in a work stoppage. \n55.  CoreCivic also maintains a corporate scheme, plan, and pattern at Stewart of \nthreatening Plaintiffs and Class Members who refuse to work with โchanging housingโ to living \nquarters that are less safe, sanitary, or private, or that are more restrictive or isolating. \n56.  Detained immigrants who submit to the Work Program are often provided with \nmore favorable living quarters, including โpodsโ with relatively private two-person cells, access \nto a common area, a shared bathroom with one cellmate, and a shower with temperature control. \n \n38See Norton, supra note 28; S. Poverty Law Ctr., supra note 28; ACLU of Ga., supra note 28; \nImprisoned Justice, supra note 28, at 36-37; see also Grae v. Corrections Corp. of Am., No. 3:16-cv-\n2267, 2017 WL 6442145 at *6 (M.D. Tenn. Dec. 18, 2017) (citing instances of CoreCivic placing \nindividuals in administrative segregation in Eden Detention Center for inappropriate reasons). \n39 OIG Report, at 6 (reporting on Stewart and two other facilities); see also Urevich, supra note 17 \n(former ICE officer and Stewart guard describing physical abuse and verbal mistreatment of detained \nimmigrants at Stewart). \n40 OIG Report, at 6 (reporting on Stewart and two other facilities).  \n  18\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 19 of 34\n   \n \n57.  These  smaller  pods  are  in  stark  contrast  to  the  open  dormitories.  The  open \ndormitories house up to 66 people, in 33 bunk beds. There is no privacy. The lights in these dorms \nare on all day and night, requiring some detained immigrants to fold socks over their eyes in order \nto sleep. There is one bathroom in these dorms with three to four toilets, three to four urinals, and \nfour sinks. This shared bathroom is often filthy, to the extent that the pod residents at times gag \nfrom the overwhelming and festering stench. The showers in the open dormitories do not have \ntemperature control and provide only extremely hot water. The open dormitories are also the site \nof frequent conflict and even violence. Indeed, the detained immigrants refer to open dormitories \nas โEl Gallinero,โ or โthe Chicken Coop,โ for both the conditions and overcrowded living quarters. \n58.  CoreCivic maintains a corporate scheme, plan, and pattern at Stewart of threatening \nPlaintiffs and Class Members with loss of access to the commissary when they refuse to work.  \n59.  Plaintiffs and Class Members rely on access to the commissary to purchase the \nbasic necessities that CoreCivic does not adequately provide and phone cards to maintain contact \nwith loved ones.  \n60.  By maintaining this scheme, plan, and pattern of threatening Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers who refuse to work with solitary confinement and other sanctions, CoreCivic ensures an \navailable labor pool of detained immigrants will work for nearly free, thus allowing it to continue \noperating Stewart at an enormous profit.  \n61.  CoreCivic knowingly benefitted financially, both by way of reduced labor costs \nand increased commissary revenue, from participating in a venture CoreCivic knew or should have \nknown forced Plaintiffs and Class Members to work, or attempted to force them to work. \n  19\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 20 of 34\n   \n \nF.  Plaintiff Barrientosโ Labor at Stewart \n62.  Mr. Barrientos performed work for CoreCivic at Stewart as a result of its unlawful \nforced labor scheme, plan, and pattern.  \n63.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Barrientos washed dishes, served meals, and prepared \nfood for detained immigrants at Stewart. While he was detained, he regularly worked eight- to \nnine-hour shifts per day, seven days per week.  \n64.  Prior to March 2018, Mr. Barrientos was paid $4 per day. If he worked over twelve \nhours in one day, he was paid $5 per day. If Mr. Barrientos worked seven consecutive days in one \nweek, he was compensated with a $5 phone card on top of his weekly wages.  \n65.  After March 2018, CoreCivicโs pay scheme changed. Under the new scheme, Mr. \nBarrientos was paid $1 per day if he worked fewer than six hours, $4 per day if he worked for six \nhours, $5 per day if he worked between eight and eleven hours and fifty-nine minutes, and $8 per \nday if he worked twelve hours or more. CoreCivic credited these wages to Mr. Barrientosโ \ncommissary account. \n66.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Barrientos was forced to cook and serve spoiled food to \ndetained immigrants after complaining about the expired food to kitchen supervisors.  \n67.  CoreCivic denied Mr. Barrientos access to basic necessities that he then had to \npurchase at Stewartโs commissary with his wages from the Work Program. In one instance, Mr. \nBarrientos ran out of toilet paper and requested another roll from a CoreCivic officer. The \nCoreCivic officer told Mr. Barrientos to use his fingers to clean himself. \n68.  While he was detained, Mr. Barrientos spent his wages on soap, toothpaste, food, \nclothes, phone cards, and other necessities from the commissary. \n  20\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 21 of 34\n   \n \n69.  Mr. Barrientos was housed in a pod with a relatively private, two-person cells that \ncontain a bathroom to be shared with his cellmate, and he was provided with access to a shower \nthat had both hot and cold water.  \n70.  Officers at Stewart threatened to transfer Mr. Barrientos from his pod to the \nChicken Coop if he stopped working, call in sick, refuse to change shifts as requested, or encourage \nothers to stop working.  \n71.  On one occasion, a CoreCivic Officer named Garden41 woke up Mr. Barrientos and \nordered him to work a 2 a.m. shift, even though he was assigned the 10 a.m. shift that day. When \nMr. Barrientos refused, the officer told him to pack his bags because he was being moved to other \nhousing. Mr. Barrientos relented and worked the early shift because feared being placed back in \nthe Chicken Coop. \n72.  Officers  at  Stewart  threatened  Mr.  Barrientos  with  denial  of  access  to  the \ncommissary if he stopped working, called in sick, or encouraged others to stop working. \n73.  Around late 2015, CoreCivic officers threatened to put Mr. Barrientos in solitary \nconfinement on two different occasions because they thought he and other kitchen workers were \norganizing a work stoppage.  \n74.  Around  October  2017,  CoreCivic  officers  put  Mr.  Barrientos  in  medical \nsegregation, allegedly for chicken pox, soon after he submitted a grievance against an officer who \nforced Mr. Barrientos to work while he was sick. Mr. Barrientos informed the officers that he had \nchicken pox as a child and was therefore unlikely to contract it again. CoreCivic detained Mr. \nBarrientos in medical segregation for two months and, despite a blood test, never informed him \nwhether he had contracted chicken pox so as to justify his segregation. \n \n41 Mr. Barrientos is unsure of the precise spelling of this Officerโs name and therefore acknowledges that \nthis spelling is an approximation. \n  21\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 22 of 34\n   \n \n75.  While in segregation, Mr. Barrientos was in a cell by himself and was denied basic \nnecessities and privileges. He was not allowed to see his family. His outdoor yard time was reduced \nfrom three to four hours per day to a half hour per day. As a result of his medical segregation, the \nimmigration  court  had to  reschedule a  hearing  in  his  immigration  case thereby  prolonging \nresolution of his case.  \n76.  Mr. Barrientos provided CoreCivic with his labor because of CoreCivicโs threats of \nphysical restraint, serious harm, and/or abuse of the legal process; and its scheme, plan, and pattern \nto threaten or inflict physical restraint and/or serious harm upon him if he refused to work. \n77.  CoreCivic retained the value of Mr. Barrientosโ labor as corporate profits instead \nof using it to provide for safe, minimally humane living conditions for detained immigrants at \nStewart or to compensate Mr. Barrientos fairly.  \nG.  Plaintiff Bermudez Gutiรฉrrezโs Labor at Stewart  \n78.  Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez has performed work for CoreCivic at Stewart as a result \nof its unlawful forced labor scheme, plan, and pattern.  \n79.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez washed dishes, served meals, cleaned \ntables,  mopped  floors,  cleaned  the  kitchen  and  cafeteria,  and  prepared  food  for  detained \nimmigrants at Stewart. While he was detained, he regularly worked four to six-hour shifts per day, \nseven days per week.  \n80.  Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez was paid $4 per day, regardless of the number of hours he \nworked. CoreCivic credited these wages to Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez โs commissary account.  \n81.  CoreCivic denied Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez access to basic necessities that he then \nhad to purchase at Stewartโs commissary with his wages from the Work Program.  \n  22\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 23 of 34\n   \n \n82.  Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez never had enough food to eat and lost approximately \ntwenty-five pounds during his time at Stewart. Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez regularly saw a kitchen \nmanager throw away leftover food and dump dirty water over it to prevent Work Program kitchen \nstaff from eating it. Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez worked in the Work Program to earn money to \npurchase additional food from the commissary.  \n83.  Besides purchasing food, Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez used his wages to purchase \nundershirts, a thermal shirt for warmth, toothpaste, stamps, phone cards, and other necessities from \nthe commissary. \n84.  Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez participated in the Work Program for the duration of his \ntime at Stewart, during which he was housed in a pod with two-person cells. He shared a toilet \nwith his cellmate. His housing unit primarily housed detained immigrants who worked in the \nkitchen. \n85.  Mr.  Bermudez  Gutiรฉrrez  witnessed  CoreCivic  officers  discipline  detained \nimmigrants who declined to work by moving them to different housing units, or threatening to do \nso, and threatening to revoke their commissary access. Sometimes, these people would be moved \nthe very next day after a missed day of work.  \n86.  Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez provided CoreCivic forced labor because of its threats of \nphysical restraint, serious harm, and/or abuse of the legal process; and its scheme, plan, and pattern \nto threaten or inflict physical restraint and/or serious harm upon him if he did not. \n87.  CoreCivic has retained the value of Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrezโs labor as corporate \nprofits instead of using it to provide for safer, more humane living conditions for detained \nimmigrants at Stewart or compensate Mr. Bermudez Gutiรฉrrez fairly.    \n  23\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 24 of 34\n   \n \nH.  Plaintiff Urbina Rojasโs Labor at Stewart  \n88.  Mr. Urbina Rojas performed work for CoreCivic at Stewart as a result of its \nunlawful forced labor scheme, plan, and pattern.  \n89.  Mr. Urbina Rojas worked in the kitchen as part of the Work Program at Stewart. \nHe generally worked seven days per week for roughly eight hours per day.  \n90.  Mr. Urbina Rojas was supposed to be paid $3 or $4 per day for his work in the \nkitchen. However, sometimes CoreCivic would not actually pay him for all of the days he worked.  \n91.  As a participant in the Work Program, Mr. Urbina Rojas experienced regular \nmistreatment by the supervisors and guards at his kitchen job, and he also regularly observed other \nWork Program participants being mistreated. For example, guards and supervisors would yell and \nscream at the workers. Sometimes he would write down the names of CoreCivic guards who were \nabusive in order to write grievances about them after a shift was over, but the guards would throw \naway his notes before he got the chance to write the grievances.  \n92.  Despite this mistreatment, Mr. Urbina Rojas continued to work because he was \nforced to do so.  \n93.  If Mr. Urbina Rojas and other workers living in his pod did not report to work on a \ngiven day for their shifts beginning at 2 a.m., CoreCivic guards would enter the pod and wake \nthem up to get out of bed to go to work. If the workers did not come willingly, the guards would \npull the covers off of them to get them out of bed. \n94.  CoreCivic denied Mr. Urbina Rojas access to basic necessities that he then had to \npurchase at Stewartโs commissary with his wages from the Work Program.  \n  24\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 25 of 34\n   \n \n95.  While he was detained, Mr. Urbina Rojas spent his wages on shampoo, deodorant, \nsoap, toothpaste, socks, shirts, undershirts, food, phone cards, and other necessities from the \ncommissary, at marked-up prices. \n96.  The quality and quantity of food at Stewart was so poor that Mr. Urbina Rojas lost \napproximately twenty pounds while detained. Mr. Urbina Rojas used his wages to purchase \nsupplemental food at the commissary. \n97.  If Mr. Urbina Rojas finished his work before others finished, and he declined to \ntake on additional tasks beyond the scope of his work assignment, it was understood there would \nbe punitive consequences, such as segregation or lockdown. In one instance, Mr. Urbina Rojas \nwas put in segregation because he was told by the kitchen supervisor to complete work above and \nbeyond his normal job duties. Mr. Urbina Rojas was in segregation for approximately four days \nbecause of this incident at work.  \n98.  While in segregation, Mr. Urbina Rojas was totally isolated in a single-person cell, \nand CoreCivic provided him with even less food than the normal small ration regularly provided \nat Stewart.  \n99.  On  one  occasion,  Mr.  Urbina  Rojas  and  other  workers  did  not  go  to  work. \nCoreCivic responded by putting them โon lockdown,โ during which CoreCivic did not allow the \nworkers to leave their beds under threat of pepper spray. They could not use the restroom without \npermission, and the phone access was cut off to the housing unit. The โlockdownโ lasted for \napproximately two to three days.  \n100.  Mr. Urbina Rojas experienced multiple other similar โlockdownsโ and threats of \nโlockdownsโ that included severely restricting workersโ movement, even to use the restroom, \nwhen the workers did not go to work. The โlockdownsโ usually had the desired effectโCoreCivic \n  25\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 26 of 34\n   \n \nwas able to force detained individuals to work to avoid โlockdownโ and to have unrestricted \nmovement in the unit and access to the restroom and phones. \n101.  On yet another occasion, Mr. Urbina Rojas joined a group of kitchen workers who \nhad decided not to go to their 2 a.m. kitchen shift. CoreCivic threatened the workers with \nsegregation. In the end, CoreCivic did not put the workers in segregation, instead sending them to \nwork, because it needed workers to cook and serve the food to the other detained individuals. \n102.  Mr. Urbina Rojas provided CoreCivic with his labor because of CoreCivicโs threats \nof physical restraint, serious harm, and/or abuse of the legal process; and its scheme, plan, and \npattern to threaten or inflict physical restraint and/or serious harm upon him if he refused to work. \n103.  CoreCivic retained the value of Mr. Urbina Rojasโs labor as corporate profits \ninstead of using it to provide for safe, minimally humane living conditions for detained immigrants \nat Stewart or to compensate Mr. Urbina Rojas fairly.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n104.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit as a class action on behalf of themselves individually \nand all others similarly situated under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a), (b)(2) for their \nrequests for declaratory and injunctive relief only, and (b)(3) for their requests for damages. This \naction satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, predominance, and superiority \nrequirements of those provisions.  \nA.   Class Definition  \n105.  Plaintiffs seek to certify the following two classes:  \n(a)  All  civil  immigration  detainees  who  performed  work  for \nCoreCivic at Stewart in the โVolunteer Work Programโ starting ten \nyears prior to the date the original complaint was filed (April 17, \n2018) until the date of final judgment in this matter (โForced Labor \nClassโ). \n \n  26\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 27 of 34\n   \n \n(b)  All  civil  immigration  detainees  who  performed  work  for \nCoreCivic at Stewart in the โVolunteer Work Programโ starting four \nyears prior to the date the original complaint was filed (April 17, \n2018)  until  the  date  of  final  judgment  in  this  matter  (โUnjust \nEnrichment Classโ). \n \n106.  Excluded from the class definitions are the defendants, their officers, directors, \nmanagement,  employees,  subsidiaries,  and  affiliates,  and  all  federal  governmental  entities. \nPlaintiffs reserve the right to revise the class definition based upon information learned subsequent \nto the filing of this action. \nB.  Class Certification Requirements under Rule 23(a), (b)(2), and (b)(3).  \n107.  Numerosity: The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nPlaintiffs do not know the exact size of the class because that information is within the control of \nCoreCivic. However, upon information and belief, the class members number in the thousands. \nMembership in the class is readily ascertainable from CoreCivicโs detention and Work Program \nrecords.  \n108.  Commonality: There are numerous questions of law or fact common to the Class, \nand those issues predominate over any question affecting only individual class members. The \ncommon legal and factual issues include the following: \na.  Whether CoreCivicโs conduct as set forth in Count I violated the forced labor and \nattempt provisions of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589, 1594, and 1595); \nb.  Whether CoreCivic was unjustly enriched by the Work Program; \nc.  Whether Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to equitable relief, including \ninjunctive and declaratory relief; and  \nd.  Whether Plaintiffs and the Class Members are entitled to damages and other \nmonetary relief and, if so, in what amount. \n  27\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 28 of 34\n   \n \n109.  Typicality: The claims asserted by Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Class, \nin that the representative Plaintiffs, like all Class Members, were subject to and impacted by \nCoreCivicโs uniform policy. Each member of the proposed Class has been similarly injured by \nCoreCivicโs misconduct. \n110.  Adequacy: Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \nPlaintiffs have retained attorneys experienced in class and complex litigation, including litigation \narising under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Plaintiffs and their counsel intend to \nvigorously prosecute this litigation. Neither Plaintiffs nor their counsel have interests that conflict \nwith the interests of the other class members.  \n111.  Predominance of Common Questions: The questions of law or fact common to \nthe class, identified above in paragraph 108, predominate over any questions affecting only \nindividual members. Specifically, CoreCivicโs scheme, plan, and pattern to force labor applies to \nthe class as a whole and has resulted in substantially similar injuries to the class.  \n112.  Superiority: Plaintiffs and Class Members have all suffered and will continue to \nsuffer harm and damages as a result of CoreCivicโs wrongful conduct. A class action is superior \nto other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. Treatment as \na class action will permit a large number of similarly situated persons to adjudicate their common \nclaims in a single forum simultaneously, efficiently, and without the duplication of effort and \nexpense that numerous individual actions would engender. Class treatment will also permit the \nadjudication of claims by many members of the proposed class who could not individually afford \nto litigate a claim such as is asserted in this complaint. Additionally, a class action is superior \nbecause the Class is comprised of many individuals who do not speak English as their native \n  28\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 29 of 34\n   \n \nlanguage and who are geographically dispersed. Finally, this class action likely presents no \ndifficulties in management that would preclude maintenance as a class action.  \n113.  This action satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) because CoreCivic has acted \nand refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive and/or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to each Class Member. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nCOUNT I \n \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT  \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1589)  \nOr, in the Alternative, Attempt to Commit Forced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a)). \nOn behalf of the Forced Labor Class \n \n114.

Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members are authorized to bring this claim \nagainst CoreCivic pursuant to the civil remedies provision of the Trafficking Victims Protection \nAct (โTVPAโ), 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595, because CoreCivic violated the forced labor provisions of 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 1589 or, in the alternative, the attempt provisions of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a).  \n116.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members also are authorized to bring this claim \nunder the TVPA, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595, because CoreCivic knowingly benefitted financially from \nparticipating in a venture which CoreCivic knew or should have known has engaged in violations \nof the forced labor or, in the alternative, the attempt provisions of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a). \n117.  CoreCivic knowingly obtained the labor or services of Plaintiffs and Forced Labor \nClass Members by means of physical restraint and threats of physical restraint of Plaintiffs and \nMembers  of  the  Forced  Labor  Class,  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.  ยง  1589(a)(1).  Specifically, \n  29\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 30 of 34\n   \n \nCoreCivic threatened to or did restrain Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members in solitary \nconfinement when they refused orders to work. \n118.  CoreCivic knowingly obtained the labor or services of Plaintiffs and Forced Labor \nClass Members by means of serious harm and threats of serious harm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง \n1589(a)(2).  \n119.  The serious harm CoreCivic caused and threatened was physical and non-physical \nharm, including psychological harm. Specifically,  \na.  Withholding of Basic Necessities: CoreCivic withheld or threatened \nto withhold basic necessities from Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class \nMembers, thereby forcing them to work for subminimum wages to \nbuy those basic necessities at the commissary and avoid hunger, \nundernourishment, lack of personal hygiene, and lack of contact \nwith loved ones, among other harms;  \n \nb.  Threatened and Actual Sanctions: When CoreCivic perceived that \nPlaintiffs and Forced Labor Class members were refusing to provide \ntheir labor, organizing a work stoppage, or participating in a work \nstoppage, CoreCivic  \n \ni.  placed  or  threatened  to  place  them  into \nsolitary confinement; \nii.  threatened criminal prosecution;  \niii.  threatened  to  transfer  them  to  living \nquarters  that  are  less  safe,  sanitary,  or \nprivate,  or  that  are  more  restrictive  or \nisolating; and/or \niv.  threatened  to  deny  them  access  to  the \ncommissary where they could buy food, \nhygiene products, and phone cards, thus \ndenying  them  basic  necessities  and \nisolating them from friends and family.  \n \n120.  The conduct described in paragraph 119, supra, is โserious harmโ as defined in 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 1589(c)(2) because it is โsufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to \ncompel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances [of Plaintiffs \n  30\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 31 of 34\n   \n \nand Forced Labor Class Members] to perform or to continue performing labor or services in order \nto avoid incurring that harm.โ \n121.  CoreCivic knowingly obtained the labor or services of Plaintiffs and Forced Labor \nClass Members โby means of a scheme, plan, or pattern [CoreCivic] intended to cause โฆ \n[Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members] to believe that, if โฆ [Plaintiffs and Forced Labor \nClass Members] did not perform such labor or services, โฆ [they] would suffer serious harm or \nphysical  restraintโ  as  described  in  paragraphs  115-119,  supra,  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.  ยง \n1589(a)(4). \n122.  CoreCivic knowingly obtained the labor or services of Plaintiffs and Forced Labor \nClass Members by means of abuse or threatened abuse of legal process, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \nยง 1589(a)(3). Specifically, CoreCivic threatened to initiate criminal proceedings against Plaintiffs \nand Forced Labor Class Members to obtain their labor and to prevent them from refusing to work. \n123.  In the alternative, CoreCivic attempted to obtain the labor or services of Plaintiffs \nand Forced Labor Class Members by the means described paragraphs 115-119, supra, in violation \nof 18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a).  \n124.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members have suffered damages in an amount \nto be determined at trial.  \n125.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members are entitled to recover compensatory \nand punitive damages. \n126.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members are entitled to recover mandatory \nrestitution in the full amount of their losses.  \n127.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members are entitled to recover their costs and \nreasonable attorneyโs fees.  \n  31\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 32 of 34\n   \n \nCOUNT II \nOn behalf of the Unjust Enrichment Class \nUNJUST ENRICHMENT \nGeorgia Common Law \n128.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations above. \n129.  CoreCivic materially and significantly reduced its labor costs and expenses, and \nincreased its corporate profits, by obtaining undercompensated labor from Plaintiffs and Unjust \nEnrichment Class Members. \n130.  Plaintiffs and Unjust Enrichment Class Members conferred non-gratuitous benefits \nupon CoreCivic by performing work for $1 to $4 per day, and up to $8 per day for kitchen workers \nunder certain circumstances, for which CoreCivic would otherwise have had to pay at least the \napplicable minimum wage or more, thereby significantly and materially increasing CoreCivicโs \nprofits and unjustly enriching CoreCivic at the expense of and detriment to Plaintiffs and Unjust \nEnrichment Class Members. \n131.  CoreCivicโs retention of any benefit collected directly and indirectly from this \nundercompensated labor violated principles of justice, equity, and good conscience.  \n132.  As a direct and proximate result of CoreCivicโs forced labor practices, Plaintiffs \nand Unjust Enrichment Class Members have suffered concrete harm and injury, including physical \nand emotional injury, and the unlawful violation of their rights.   \n133.  Plaintiffs and Unjust Enrichment Class Members are entitled to recover from \nCoreCivic all amounts that CoreCivic has wrongfully and improperly obtained, and CoreCivic \nshould be required to disgorge to Plaintiffs and Unjust Enrichment Class Members the benefits it \nhas unjustly obtained. Plaintiffs and Class Members are also entitled to recover exemplary \ndamages.   \n  32\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 87   Filed 10/16/20   Page 33 of 34\n   \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the Class, request that the Court:  \na.

Stewart \nis a federal immigration detention facility where aliens are held during the \npendency of removal proceedings or for other reasons related to enforcement of the \nnationโs immigration laws.  At Stewart, CoreCivic, as a private contractor, is \nrequired to operate what is referred to as a โvoluntary work program,โ through \nwhich detainees may perform work for compensation.   \n  Appelleesโ complaint alleged that, far from operating a โvoluntaryโ work \nprogram, CoreCivic coerces alien detainees to perform labor at Stewart by, inter \nalia, the use or threatened use of serious harm, criminal prosecution, solitary \nconfinement, and the withholding of basic necessities.  Appelleesโ complaint \nasserted that CoreCivicโs labor scheme violated, and continues to violate, the \nforced-labor prohibition in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (โTVPAโ), 18 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1589, 1594โ95, and Georgia law.  The TVPA subjects to criminal and \n \n  *Honorable Barbara J. Rothstein, United States District Judge for the Western District of \nWashington, sitting by designation. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 3 of 24 \ncivil liability โ[w]hoeverโ knowingly obtains the labor or services of a โpersonโ by \nany one of the prohibited coercive means explicitly listed in the TVPA.  18 U.S.C. \nยงยง 1589(a), 1595.   \n  CoreCivic moved to dismiss the complaint, contending that the TVPA does \nnot apply to a private government contractor or cover labor performed in work \nprograms by alien detainees in lawful custody of the U.S. government.  Although it \ndenied the motion, the district court certified for immediate appeal the narrow, \npurely legal question of โ[w]hether the TVPA applies to work programs in federal \nimmigration detention facilities operated by private for-profit contractors.โ  See 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 1292(b).  We granted CoreCivicโs petition for permission to immediately \nappeal the district courtโs order.   \n  After review, and with the benefit of oral argument, we conclude that: \n(1) under the plain language of the statute, the TVPA covers the conduct of private \ncontractors operating federal immigration detention facilities; (2) the TVPA does \nnot bar private contractors from operating the sort of voluntary work programs \ngenerally authorized under federal law for aliens held in immigration detention \nfacilities; but (3) private contractors that operate such work programs are not \ncategorically excluded from the TVPA and may be liable if they knowingly obtain \nor procure the labor or services of a program participant through the illegal \ncoercive means explicitly listed in the TVPA.  Because our review is limited to the \n3 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 4 of 24 \nlegal question of the TVPAโs applicability to private contractors operating federal \nimmigration detention facilities, we do not at this time address whether the factual \nallegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a TVPA claim. \nI. BACKGROUND \n  The question certified by the district court concerns the TVPA and work \nprograms in federal immigration detention facilities.  We review the TVPA, the \nrelevant work programs, and then the district court proceedings.  \nA. The TVPA  \n  The TVPA prohibits knowingly โobtain[ing] the labor or services of a \npersonโ by any one of, or combination of, the following means:  \n(1) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats of \nphysical restraint to that person or another person; \n \n(2) by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to that person \nor another person; \n \n(3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process; \nor \n \n(4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the \nperson to believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or \nservices, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or \nphysical restraint. \n \n18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a) (collectively, the โillegal coercive meansโ).  Section 1589(a) \napplies to โ[w]hoeverโ knowingly provides or obtains such forced labor or services \nfrom a โperson.โ  Id.   \n4 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 5 of 24 \n  In turn, ยง 1595(a) provides a private cause of action for any victim of a \nviolation of ยง 1589.  18 U.S.C. ยง 1595(a).  Under ยง 1595(a), โ[a]n individual who \nis a victim of a violationโ of the TVPA โmay bring a civil action against the \nperpetrator,โ as well as against anyone who โknowingly benefits, financially or by \nreceiving anything of value,โ from any such violation.  Id. \nB. Work Programs in ICE Detention Facilities \n  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (โICEโ) detains certain aliens \nduring the pendency of removal proceedings or for other reasons related to \nenforcement of the nationโs immigration laws.  ICE detains some of those aliens in \nfacilities operated by private contractors.  Appellant CoreCivic is a private \ncontractor that operates several detention centers throughout the country, including \nthe Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, where Appellees were or are \nbeing held.1    \n  CoreCivic, as a private contractor operating an ICE detention facility, is \nsubject to, and required to follow, the Performance-Based National Detention \nStandards (โPBNDSโ), the operative version of which was promulgated in 2011 \nand revised in 2016.  See U.S. Immigration & Customs Enfโt, Performance-Based \nNational Detention Standards 2011 (rev. 2016), available at \n \n  1CoreCivic operates the Stewart Detention Center through a contract with Stewart \nCounty, Georgia.  The County is a party to an Intergovernmental Service Agreement with ICE, \npursuant to which it detains aliens on ICEโs behalf.   \n5 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 6 of 24 \nhttps://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-standards/2011/pbnds2011r2016.pdf.  The \nPBNDS are designed to ensure a safe and secure detention environment that meets \ndetaineesโ basic needs and is consistent with applicable legal requirements.   \n  The PBNDS state that detention centers may require all detainees to \nโmaintain their immediate living areas in a neat and orderly mannerโ through \ncertain โpersonal housekeepingโ tasks such as โmaking their bunk beds daily,โ \nโstacking loose papers,โ and โkeeping the floor free of debris.โ  Id. ยง 5.8(V)(C).  \nBeyond these basic required tasks, detainees โshall not be required to work,โ and \nall other โ[w]ork assignments are voluntary.โ  Id. ยงยง 5.8(II)(2), 5.8(V)(C). \n  As to voluntary work, the PBNDS further state that โ[d]etainees shall be \nprovided the opportunity to participate in a voluntary work programโ through \nwhich they may earn monetary compensation.2  Id. ยงยง 5.8(I), 5.8(V)(A) (emphasis \nadded).  The purpose of such voluntary work programs is to reduce โ[t]he negative \nimpact of confinement . . . through decreased idleness, improved morale and fewer \ndisciplinary incidents.โ  Id. ยง 5.8(II)(4).  However, the facility administrator must \noperate the voluntary work program in compliance with the PBNDS, which \nregulate the selection of detainees, the hours of work (no more than 8 hours per \nday and 40 hours per week), the minimum compensation for completed work (at \n \n  2Since 1950, Congress has authorized ICE and its predecessor agencies to pay detained \naliens โfor work performedโ โwhile held in custody under the immigration laws.โ  8 U.S.C. \nยง 1555(d).  \n \n6 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 7 of 24 \nleast $1.00 per day), the number of work assignments a detainee can perform, and \nthe conditions under which that work occurs.  Id. ยงยง 5.8(V)(D)โ(O).  The PBNDS \ndelegate the site-specific rules for each work program to the โfacility \nadministrator.โ  Id. ยง 5.8(V)(D).   \n  Detainees may be removed from the voluntary work program for causes \nsuch as โunsatisfactory performanceโ or โdisruptive behavior,โ or as a โsanction \nimposed . . . for an infraction of a facility rule, regulation or policy.โ  Id. \nยง 5.8(V)(L).  Additionally, the PBNDS specify that participants in the voluntary \nwork program are โexpected to be ready to report for work at the required time,โ \nโmay not leave an assignment without permission,โ and โmay not evade attendance \nand performance standards in assigned activities nor encourage others to do so.โ  \nId. ยง 5.8(V)(M).     \n  The PBNDS otherwise provide for disciplinary action against detainees \noutside the context of the voluntary work program.  See generally id. ยง 3.1.  The \nPBNDS identify four categories of offenses and prescribe appropriate sanctions for \neach category.  Id. ยงยง 3.1(V)(C), 3.1 app. A.  Those categories are โgreatest,โ \nโhigh,โ โhigh moderate,โ and โlow moderate.โ3  Id.  According to the PBNDS, all \n \n  3For example, the PBNDS define โ[r]efusing to clean assigned living areaโ as a โhigh \nmoderateโ offense, while โfailing to keep self and living area in accordance with posted \nstandardsโ is a โlow moderateโ offense.  PBNDS ยง 3.1 app. A.  While the PBNDS define \nโ[e]ncouraging others to participate in a work stoppage or to refuse to workโ as a โhighโ offense, \nthere is no specific offense prescribed in the PBNDS for a detainee who, after signing up for the \nvoluntary work program, refuses to complete his assigned tasks.  See generally id. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 8 of 24 \nfour categories of infractions are punishable by a โ[l]oss of privilegesโโincluding \nโcommissary, vending machines, movies, recreation, etc.โโand a โ[c]hange [in] \nhousing,โ among other sanctions.   Id. ยง 3.1 app. A.  Additionally, all but the \nlowest category of infractions are punishable by the initiation of criminal \nproceedings and โ[d]isciplinary segregationโ of varying length based on the \nseverity of the infraction.  Id.  \nII. DISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS \nA. Complaint \n  In their complaint, Appellees alleged that the voluntary work program as \nimplemented by CoreCivic was, in fact, anything but voluntary.  Rather, the \ncomplaint alleged, aliens detained at Stewart work because they have no other \nmeaningful choice.  The complaint alleged CoreCivic was operating, and continues \nto operate, a โdeprivation schemeโ by which it forces detainees to participate in the \nwork program through threats of โserious harmโ in the form of deprivation of \nprivacy and safety, threats of referral for criminal prosecution, and threats of \nsolitary confinement; through withholding basic necessities like food, toothpaste, \ntoilet paper, and soap; and through deprivation of outside contact with loved ones.   \n   Appelleesโ complaint claimed that, by engaging in this alleged forced-labor \nโscheme,โ CoreCivic ran afoul of ยงยง 1589(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) in that it \nwas knowingly โobtain[ing] . . . laborโ by means of: (1) โforce, threats of force, \n8 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 9 of 24 \nphysical restraint, or threats of physical restraintโ; (2) โserious harm or threats of \nserious harmโ; (3) โthe abuse or threatened abuse of the law or legal processโ; and \n(4) a โscheme . . . intended to cause [a] person to believe that, if that person did not \nperform . . . labor or services, that person . . . would suffer serious harm or physical \nrestraint.โ  18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589(a)(1)โ(4).  Appelleesโ complaint claimed that this \nforced-labor schemeโwhich remains ongoingโoperates as follows. \n  The conditions at Stewart are alleged to be poor, particularly in the โopen \ndormitories,โ which detainees refer to as the โChicken Coopโ due to the unsanitary \nconditions and overcrowding.  The showers in the Chicken Coop, for example, are \nsaid to be moldy and without temperature control.  CoreCivic allegedly does not \nprovide detainees with basic hygiene products, including toilet paper, soap, and \ntoothpaste.  Detainees must purchase these items from the commissary when they \nrun out.  They also must purchase expensive โphone cardsโ from the commissary if \nthey wish to speak with loved ones who are unable to make the trip to the detention \ncenter.   \n  Detainees who participate in CoreCivicโs voluntary work program, however, \nare spared some of Stewartโs more unfavorable conditions andโbecause they are \npaid between $1.00 and $4.00 per dayโare able to purchase necessities from the \ncommissary.  For example, according to Appelleesโ complaint, work program \nparticipants are not housed in the โChicken Coop,โ but are provided two-person \n9 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 10 of 24 \ncells, a shared common area, a bathroom shared with only one other cellmate, and \na shower with temperature control.  Appelleesโ complaint alleged that, once \ndetainees are in the work program, CoreCivic threatens to harm or actually harms \nthose who refuse to work.   \n  In short, Appelleesโ complaint alleged that CoreCivic subjects detainees to \ninhumane conditions by depriving them of basic necessities and livable \naccommodations, detainees join the so-called voluntary work program to alleviate \nthese conditions, and CoreCivic then threatens any program participants who \nrefuse to work.  In this way, Appellees claim, CoreCivic effectively forces \ndetainees to continually work and participate in the program.  Appellees allege that \nthis provides CoreCivic with a cheap supply of labor to operate the facility with, \nwhich enables CoreCivic to increase its profits.   \n  The three named plaintiffsโBarrientos, Velazquez-Galicia, and Ahmedโall \neither are working or previously worked as kitchen workers as part of the voluntary \nwork program at Stewart.  However, they all claimed their participation in the \nwork program was not voluntary in any meaningful sense, as they were subject to \nthe above-described โdeprivation scheme.โ  Additionally, all three alleged they \nwere subject to or witnessed threats from CoreCivic employees once they began \nparticipating in the work program. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 11 of 24 \n  Barrientos, a citizen of Guatemala seeking asylum in the United States, \nearned between $1.00 and $4.00 per day as part of the voluntary work program, \nthough he makes up to $8.00 per day if CoreCivic requires him to work 12 hours or \nmore in one day.  He alleged CoreCivic threatened to transfer him to the Chicken \nCoop, revoke his access to the commissary, and put him in solitary confinement if \nhe stopped working, called in sick, refused to change shifts, or encouraged others \nto stop working.   \n  Velazquez-Galicia is a citizen of Mexico who intends to seek relief from \ndeportation and whose wife and two children are U.S. citizens.  He too is employed \nas a kitchen worker and is paid between $1.00 and $4.00 per day or up to $8.00 per \nday if he is required to work more than 12 hours in one day.  He alleged he \nwitnessed CoreCivic employees threaten to transfer detainees who declined to \nwork from the preferable two-person cells to the Chicken Coop.    \n  Ahmed is a citizen of Bangladesh who was detained at Stewart until \nFebruary 2018, when he allegedly opted to give up his asylum case in part due to \nhis desire to escape Stewartโs poor conditions.  Ahmed was paid $4.00 per day as a \nkitchen worker.  Like the other plaintiffs, he earned additional money if he worked \n12 hours or more.  He alleged that CoreCivic employees threatened to place him in \nsolitary confinement if he stopped working, and actually did place him in solitary \n11 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 12 of 24 \nconfinement for ten days when he threatened a work stoppage after he was not \npaid.   \nB. District Courtโs Order \n  CoreCivic moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that Appelleesโ \ncomplaint failed to state a claim under the TVPA because Congress did not intend \nthe statute to apply at all to alien detainees in the lawful custody of the U.S. \nGovernment or to private contractors operating immigration detention facilities.  \nThe district court disagreed, finding โthe plain language of the statuteโ clearly \nencompassed claims brought by alien detainees held in privately run detention \nfacilities.  The district court โdecline[d] to read an implied exclusion for lawfully \nconfined victims into the statute.โ   \n  The district court recognized, however, that โ[w]hether the TVPA applies to \nwork programs in federal immigration detention facilities operated by private for-\nprofit contractors is a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial \nground for difference of opinion.โ  We agreed, and granted CoreCivicโs petition \nfor immediate appeal. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Our Limited Review  \n  As an initial matter, we clarify the scope of our review.  Although the \ndistrict court identified a discrete legal question in its order, โappellate jurisdiction \n12 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 13 of 24 \n[under ยง 1292(b)] applies to the order certified to the court of appeals, and is not \ntied to the particular question formulated by the district court.โ  Yamaha Motor \nCorp., U.S.A. v. Calhoun, 516 U.S. 199, 205, 116 S. Ct. 619, 623 (1996).  Thus, \nwhile we โmay not reach beyond the certified order,โ we โmay address any issue \nfairly included within the certified order.โ  Id.  That said, we think it appropriate to \nlimit our review to the discrete and abstract legal issue the district court identified.  \nSee McFarlin v. Conseco Servs., LLC, 381 F.3d 1251, 1259 (11th Cir. 2004) (โThe \nlegal question must be stated at a high enough level of abstraction to lift the \nquestion out of the details of the evidence or facts of a particular case and give it \ngeneral relevance to other cases in the same area of law.โ).   \n  Because we limit our review to the discrete and abstract legal issue of the \nTVPAโs applicability to a certain class of cases, we are not concerned with the \nspecific factual allegations in the complaint, apart from the nature of the parties \n(legally detained immigrants seeking to assert claims against a private, for-profit, \ngovernment contractor) and, to a lesser extent, the fact that the claims arise out of \nthe operation of a work program required by the PBNDS.  In other words, we do \nnot address whether the complaint in this case sufficiently alleged a violation of the \nTVPA, assuming it applies to private contractors like CoreCivic.  We also do not \noffer any opinion on CoreCivicโs operation of work programs generally.  Indeed, \nwe decline to address the adequacy of the complaintโor any other fact-intensive \n13 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 14 of 24 \ninquiryโat this stage in the litigation.  See Mamani v. Berzain, 825 F.3d 1304, \n1312โ13 (11th Cir. 2016) (declining to address, in an interlocutory appeal, whether \na complaint stated a claim for relief under the Torture Victim Protection Act \nbecause the issue did not ask the court โto decide a pure or abstract question about \nthe TVPA itselfโ).4 \nB. Analysis \n  As to the discrete legal question before us, CoreCivic has not asked us to \nadopt a construction of the statute that would exempt federal contractors from any \nand all liability under the TVPA.  Rather, CoreCivic asks us to hold that the TVPA \n(specifically ยง 1589) can never apply in the specific context of a โfederally \nmandated voluntary work program in a detention setting,โ even where the work \nperformed through that program is obtained through, for example, force, physical \nrestraint, or threats of serious harm.  CoreCivic insists that its construction of the \n \n  4We deny Appelleesโ request to set aside the motions panelโs order granting Appellant \nCoreCivic permission to appeal.  We recognize that, like any decision made by a motions panel, \na petition for interlocutory review under ยง 1292(b) may be improvidently granted.  See 11th Cir. \nR. 27-1(g); McFarlin, 381 F.3d at 1253.  Appellees insist that CoreCivic essentially asks us to \nconsider fact-driven issues not appropriate for review under ยง 1292(b) and that, contrary to the \ndistrict courtโs conclusion, the unambiguous language of the statute leaves no room for a \nsubstantial difference of opinion.     \n  However, we agree with the district court that its order involves a pure question of law \nthat controls at least a substantial part of the case and about which there is substantial ground for \na difference of opinion, and that its resolution may well substantially reduce the amount of \nlitigation necessary on remand.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b).  A ruling in favor of CoreCivic on this \npure question of law would eliminate Appelleesโ sole federal claim and leave behind only one \nstate law claim.  And our answer to the legal question presented does not depend on any facts or \nthe factual record below.  In short, this appeal satisfies ยง 1292(b)โs requirements. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 15 of 24 \nstatute would be consistent with the text, structure, and purpose of the TVPA.  In \nsupport of its argument, CoreCivic points to: (1) the text of ยง 1589, particularly the \nrequirement that one โobtain[] the labor or services of a personโ; (2) the fact that, \nwhen Congress enacted the TVPA, it had long authorized labor by alien detainees; \n(3) the fact that courts have consistently held that alien detainees can be required to \nperform labor while in detention; (4) the express purpose of the TVPA, as well as \nthe legislative history leading to its enactment; and (5) the rule of lenity, which \nCoreCivic argues favors judicial restraint in the construction of this criminal \nstatute.   \n  The question of statutory interpretation is a legal issue we review de novo.  \nWiersum v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 785 F.3d 483, 485 (11th Cir. 2015).  โThe \ninterpretation of a statute begins with its language.โ  United States v. St. Amour, \n886 F.3d 1009, 1013 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 205 (2018); see also Artis \nv. District of Columbia, 583 U.S. ___, ___, 138 S. Ct. 594, 603 (2018) (โIn \ndetermining the meaning of a statutory provision, we look first to its language, \ngiving the words used their ordinary meaning.โ  (quotation marks omitted)).  We \nfirst โdetermine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous \nmeaning,โ and, โ[i]f so, we need go no further.โ  St. Amour, 886 F.3d at 1013 \n(quotation marks omitted). \n15 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 16 of 24 \n  As laid out above, the TVPA creates a cause of actionโboth criminal and \ncivilโagainst โ[w]hoever knowingly provides or obtains the labor or services of a \npersonโ by various illegal coercive means.  18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589(a), 1595(a).  We, \nlike the district court, find this language to be โplain and unambiguous.โ  See St. \nAmour, 886 F.3d at 1013.  The use of the general terms โ[w]hoeverโ and โpersonโ \nevinces no intent on the part of Congress to restrict the application of the statute to \nparticular actors or particular victims.  Instead, the clear and unambiguous \nlanguage of the statute limits liability only by reference to the actions taken by a \nwould-be violator: it applies to anyone who knowingly โobtains the labor or \nservices of a personโ through one of the four illegal coercive means explicitly \nlisted in the statute.  No other limiting principle is evident from the plain text.   \n  Indeed, the Dictionary Actโwhich provides the definition of various terms \nfor courts to use in โdetermining the meaning of any Act of Congressโโstates that \nthe word โwhoeverโ when used in a statute โinclude[s] corporations, companies, \nassociations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as \nindividuals.โ  1 U.S.C. ยง 1.  Congressโs express inclusion of corporations and \ncompanies in the general definition of โwhoeverโ presumptively indicates that a \nprivate, for-profit government contractorโlike CoreCivicโfalls within the \nmeaning of โ[w]hoeverโ for purposes of the TVPA.    \n16 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 17 of 24 \n  Despite the statuteโs use of general terms to describe its coverage, CoreCivic \nasks us to read into the statute a limiting principle: that Congress could not have \nintended alien detainees participating in voluntary work programs to sue and make \nuse of this statute.  But โthe presumed point of using general words is to produce \ngeneral coverageโnot to leave room for courts to recognize ad hoc exceptions.โ  \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts 101 (2012).  The primary textual argument CoreCivic makes is that the \nwords โobtains the labor or services of a personโ do not naturally encompass \nfederally mandated voluntary work programs for alien detainees of the type run by \nCoreCivic.  This is because CoreCivic, like any contractor operating an \nimmigration detention facility on ICEโs behalf, is required to provide a voluntary \nwork program for detainees, and thus it cannot illegally โobtain[] the laborโ of \ndetainees through such a program.  See PBNDS ยง 5.8(V)(A).   \n  But the fact that the PBNDS require CoreCivic to operate a work program \nfor detainees does not mean that such a program can never be operated in a \nmannerโi.e., by forcing labor through illegal coercive meansโthat violates the \nTVPA.  If CoreCivic, or any other private for-profit contractor, actually forces \ndetainees to provide labor (whether through a work program or not) through any of \nthe illegal coercive means explicitly proscribed by the TVPA, it has โobtain[ed] the \nlabor or services of a personโ in violation of the TVPA.  Again, nothing in the text \n17 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 18 of 24 \nof the statute excludes federal contractors providing immigration detention services \nfrom liability under the TVPA, even when that liability might arise out of the \noperation of a federally mandated work program.  And nothing in the PBNDS \npermits CoreCivic, or other private contractors operating immigration detention \nfacilities, to force detainees to perform labor (beyond personal housekeeping \ntasks), and certainly not through the illegal coercive means explicitly listed in the \nTVPA.  \n  CoreCivic warns us against the unintended consequences of this construction \nof the statute, implying that this decision could open up criminal liability in any \nnumber of custodial settings in which detainees or prisoners are incentivized or \nrequired to perform work.  As CoreCivic notes, however, Congress itself has long \nauthorized paid work by detained aliens, and federal courts (including this Court) \nhave long held that such detainees or inmates can be required to perform labor \nwhile in detention.  8 U.S.C. ยง 1555(d); see, e.g., Villarreal v. Woodham, 113 F.3d \n202, 207 (11th Cir. 1997) (โ[N]o Court of Appeals has ever questioned the power \nof a correctional institution to compel inmates to perform services for the \ninstitution without paying the minimum wage.โ (quotation marks omitted)).  Our \ndecision here does nothing to call this precedent into question.  \n  To be clear, our opinion should not be read to call into question the legality \nof voluntary work programs in federal immigration detention facilities, or to call \n18 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 19 of 24 \ninto question longstanding requirements that detainees or inmates be required to \nperform basic housekeeping tasks.5  But the mere fact that CoreCivicโor any \nother private government contractorโis operating a work program at the behest of \nthe federal government does not, in and of itself, shield CoreCivic from liability \nunder the TVPA if it in fact obtains the forced labor of program participants \nthrough the illegal coercive means explicitly proscribed by the TVPA.  18 U.S.C. \nยง 1589(a) (listing specific illegal coercive means).  All we hold today is that the \nplain language of the TVPA brings within its scope for-profit government \ncontractors operating work programs in federal immigration detention facilities, \nand such entities are not categorically excluded or shielded from liability under the \nTVPA. \nC. Purpose and Legislative History \n  Having concluded that the โlanguage at issue has a plain and unambiguous \nmeaning,โ โwe need go no further.โ  St. Amour, 886 F.3d at 1013 (quotation marks \nomitted); see also United States v. Noel, 893 F.3d 1294, 1297 (11th Cir. 2018) \n(โ[I]f the statuteโs language is clear, there is no need to go beyond the statuteโs \nplain language into legislative history.โ (internal quotation marks omitted)), cert. \n \n  5As discussed above, in the interest of maintaining order in an immigration detention \nfacility, the PBNDS authorize punishments for detainees who, among other things, refuse to \ncomplete basic personal housekeeping tasks or organize work stoppages.  See generally PBNDS \nยง 3.1.  Our decision should likewise not be read to imply that these basic disciplinary measures, \non their own, give rise to TVPA liability.   \n19 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 20 of 24 \ndenied, 140 S. Ct. 157 (2019).6  We do acknowledge CoreCivicโs arguments \nconcerning the purpose and legislative history of the TVPA, but where, as here, the \nstatutory text is not ambiguous, โ[o]nly the most extraordinary showing of contrary \nintentions in the legislative history will justify a departure from [the statutory] \nlanguage.โ  United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680, 105 S. Ct. 2897, 2902 \n(1985) (quotation marks omitted); see also Garcia v. United States, 469 U.S. 70, \n75, 105 S. Ct. 479, 482 (1984) (โWhen we find the terms of a statute unambiguous, \njudicial inquiry is complete, except in rare and exceptional circumstances.โ \n(quotation marks omitted)).  We do not find any such extraordinary showing of \ncontrary intentions here.   \n  As CoreCivic correctly points out, Congress enacted the TVPA as part of the \nVictims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 โto combat trafficking \nin persons, a contemporary manifestation of slavery whose victims are \npredominantly women and children, to ensure just and effective punishment of \ntraffickers, and to protect their victims.โ  Victims of Trafficking and Violence \nProtection Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, ยง 102(a), 114 Stat. 1464, 1466 \n(codified at 22 U.S.C. ยง 7101).  Congress supported that purpose with 24 \n \n  6CoreCivicโs argument that the rule of lenity weighs in favor of its preferred construction \nof the statute is similarly foreclosed by our conclusion that the statutory text is unambiguous.  \nSee United States v. Maturin, 499 F.3d 1243, 1246 (11th Cir. 2007) (โBecause [the statute] is \nclear, we need discuss neither legislative history nor the rule of lenity.โ (citing Salinas v. United \nStates, 522 U.S. 52, 66, 118 S. Ct. 469, 478 (1997))). \n20 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 21 of 24 \nlegislative findings, all of which focus on human trafficking and involuntary \nservitude.  Id. ยง 102(b), 114 Stat. at 1466โ69.  And the legislative history indicates \nthat ยง 1589 in particular was โintended to address the increasingly subtle methods \nof traffickers who place their victims in modern-day slavery.โ  H.R. Rep. No. 106-\n939, at 101 (2000) (Conf. Rep.).   \n  We do not find a private government contractorโs obtaining forced labor \nthrough actual or threatened force, restraint, or serious harm to be so far removed \nfrom the purpose Congress identified as to cause us to look beyond the plain \nstatutory language.  Just because Congress may have had in mind a particular \nnarrow objectiveโhere, combatting human traffickingโdoes not on its own \njustify a departure from the principle that we should give general terms their \ngeneral meaning.  See Scalia & Garner, supra, at 103โ04 (โThe argument most \nfrequently made against giving general terms their general meaning is the one \nmade (and rejected) in the Slaughter-House casesโthat those who adopted the \nprovision had in mind a particular narrow objective (equal protection for blacks) \nthough they expressed a more general one (equal protection for โany personโ).โ).  \nAs the Supreme Court has remarked, โstatutory prohibitions often go beyond the \nprincipal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the \nprovisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by \n21 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 22 of 24 \nwhich we are governed.โ  Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, \n79, 118 S. Ct. 998, 1002 (1998).7 \n  We also are not persuaded by CoreCivicโs resort to Supreme Court decisions \nit claims counsel against adopting a construction of a criminal statute, like the \nTVPA, that may lead to results disconnected from Congressโs purpose.  See \nMarinello v. United States, 584 U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 1101 (2018); Yates v. United \nStates, 574 U.S. 528, 135 S. Ct. 1074 (2015); Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, \n134 S. Ct. 2077 (2014).  Those cases all involved some disconnect between the \npurpose of the statute and the nature of the conduct alleged.  Here, in contrast, \nAppellees have alleged that CoreCivic engaged in precisely the type of conduct \nprohibited by the TVPA: obtaining labor by the specific illegal coercive means \nexplicitly set out in the statute.  CoreCivicโs argument is not that it is incapable of \ncarrying out the prohibited conduct; instead, it insists that, even if itโor any other \nprivate contractor operating an immigration detention facilityโengaged in the \nproscribed conduct, it cannot be the โ[w]hoeverโ envisioned by the statute.  We see \n \n  7Whatโs more, as the government notes in its amicus brief, โCongress has repeatedly \nemphasized that it seeks to stamp out any use of forced labor by federal contractors.โ  See Brief \nfor the United States as Amicus Curiae in Support of Neither Party at 7.  Pointing to this history, \nalong with the text and purpose of the TVPA, the government has adopted the position that โthe \nTVPA does not contain an implicit exception for private providers of immigration detention \nservicesโ and that Appellees โare not categorically barred from bringing a TVPA suit based on \nthe conduct of a contractor or subcontractor that provides immigration detention services to the \nUnited States.โ  Id. at 8.  The governmentโs position reinforces our conclusion that the results \nhere are not wholly disconnected from Congressโs purpose in enacting the TVPA. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 23 of 24 \nno reason to read this limiting principle into the statute.  Congress wrote this \nstatute plainly, and it is up to Congress, not us, to rewrite it. \n  We further note that, while none of our sister circuits has addressed the \nspecific application of the TVPA now before us, they have found ยง 1589 \napplicable outside the core human-trafficking context to which CoreCivic would \napparently have us limit the statuteโs reach.  See, e.g., Adia v. Grandeur Mgmt., \nInc., 933 F.3d 89, 91 (2d Cir. 2019) (concluding that ยง 1589(a)โs prohibition \nagainst obtaining labor through threats of serious harm applied to โan immigrant \nlawfully in this country on a temporary guest worker visa alleging that his \nemployers threatened to revoke their sponsorship, thereby subjecting him to \ndeportationโ); Bistline v. Parker, 918 F.3d 849, 871 (10th Cir. 2019) (concluding \nthat plaintiffs, all former members of a church, had plausibly alleged violations of \nthe TVPA against the church leader by alleging that they โwere threatened with \nforce, kidnapped, physically restrained, [and] threatened with other harmsโ if they \nfailed to follow orders from church leaders); United States v. Callahan, 801 F.3d \n606, 617 (6th Cir. 2015) (โThe statuteโs express terms do not limit its application \nto immigrant victims or sex workers.

To clarify, \nwe are not hereby approving the specific holdings or analyses in these decisions, \n23 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 24 of 24 \nbut cite them to show that federal courts have concluded that ยง 1589 is not limited \nto cases of overt human trafficking.   \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n  For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district courtโs denial of \nCoreCivicโs motion to dismiss Appelleesโ complaint, and hold that the TVPA \napplies to private for-profit contractors operating federal immigration detention \nfacilities.  We express no opinion on the question of whether the factual allegations \nin Appelleesโ complaint, taken as true, are sufficient to establish a violation of the \nTVPA. \n  AFFIRMED. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 18-15081     Date Filed: 02/28/2020     Page: 1 of 1 \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT \nELBERT PARR TUTTLE COURT OF APPEALS BUILDING \n56 Forsyth Street, N.W. \nAtlanta, Georgia 30303 \nDavid J.

AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND \n  DAMAGES \nCORECIVIC, INC.,    \n  CLASS ACTION \n Defendant.   \n  JURY DEMAND \n \n \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  Individuals detained at the Stewart Detention Center (โStewartโ) in Lumpkin, \nGeorgia  work  because  they  have  no  other  meaningful  choice.    Defendant  CoreCivic,  Inc., \n(โCoreCivicโ), the billion-dollar private prison corporation that owns and operates Stewart, \nmaintains a deprivation scheme intended to force detained immigrants1 to work for nearly free. \nCoreCivic deprives detained immigrants of basic necessities like food, toothpaste, toilet paper, \nand soap ๏ญ and contact with loved ones ๏ญ so that they have to work in order to purchase those \nitems and costly phone cards at CoreCivicโs commissary.  CoreCivic then threatens detained \nimmigrants who refuse to work with serious harm, including the deprivation of privacy and \nsafety in open living quarters, referral for criminal prosecution, and, ultimately, the sensory and \n                                                 \n1 This Complaint refers to individuals detained in Stewart as โdetained immigrantsโ with the caveat that \nthere are United States citizens detained in Stewart and in other civil immigration detention centers across \nthe nation.  See, e.g., William Finnegan, The Deportation Machine, The New Yorker, Apr. 29, 2013, \nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/29/the-deportation-machine (reporting on the case of \nMark Lyttle, a U.S. Citizen who was wrongfully detained in Stewart and deported to Mexico). \n  1\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 2 of 32\npsychological deprivation of their humanity resulting from solitary confinement.  Under these \ncircumstances, no labor is voluntary โ it is forced.  \n2.  CoreCivicโs deprivation scheme ensures that the individuals detained in Stewart \nprovide the billion-dollar corporation with a ready supply of available labor needed to operate \nthe facility.  Detained immigrants mop, sweep, and wax floors; scrub toilets and showers; wash \ndishes; do laundry; clean medical facilities; and cook and prepare food and beverages daily for \nthe nearly 2,000 individuals locked inside Stewart.  For this labor, CoreCivic pays detained \nimmigrants between $1 and $4 per day and occasionally slightly more for double shifts.  When \nCoreCivic needs โvolunteersโ to work double shifts in the kitchen or to work more than five days \nper week, as it often does to run Stewart, it employs a policy of threatening detained immigrants \nuntil they comply.  Under no circumstances does CoreCivic pay the detained immigrant workers \nanything close to the federal minimum wage.   \n3.  Plaintiffs are current or former detained immigrants who were forced to work for \nCoreCivic at Stewart.  Individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs bring \nthis  class  action  lawsuit  to  end  CoreCivicโs  forced  labor  scheme  and  remedy  the  unjust \nenrichment resulting from CoreCivicโs illegal labor practices.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 because \nthis action arises under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act,2 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589, 1594, and \n1595. \n                                                 \n2  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act was enacted in 2000, see Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1486 \n(Oct. 28, 2000), and has been amended on three different occasions since then.  See Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-193, 117 Stat. 2878 (Dec. 19, 2003); William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. \n5044 (Dec. 23, 2008); Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-22, 129 Stat. 227. \n  2\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 3 of 32\n5.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action Fairness \nAct of 2005, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(d), because at least one class member is of diverse citizenship \nfrom one defendant; there are more than 100 class members; and the aggregate amount in \ncontroversy exceeds $5,000,000. \n6.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2) because the events \nor omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. \n7.  This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  CoreCivic  because  the  corporation \nregularly conducts business in and has sufficient minimum contacts with the Middle District of \nGeorgia. \n8.  Plaintiffs request that this Court exercise supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367 over their state law claim of unjust enrichment. \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n9.  Plaintiff Wilhen Hill Barrientos is currently detained at Stewart.  He has been \ndetained at Stewart intermittently since on or about July 2015.  Mr. Barrientos is a citizen of \nGuatemala seeking asylum in the United States.  He is currently working for CoreCivic as a \nkitchen worker and is generally paid between $1 and $4 per day as part of the โVoluntary Work \nProgram.โ  When CoreCivic requires him to work twelve hours or more in one day, he makes up \nto $8 per day.  \n10.  Plaintiff Margarito Velazquez Galicia is currently detained at Stewart.  He has \nbeen detained there since on or about January 2018.  Mr. Velazquez is a citizen of Mexico and \nintends to seek relief from deportation in the form of cancellation of removal.  His wife and two \n                                                                                                                                                             \n(May 29, 2015).  This complaint refers to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589, 1594, and 1595, including \nall amendments, as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (โTVPAโ).   \n  3\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 4 of 32\nchildren are United States citizens.  Mr. Velazquez is currently employed as a kitchen worker \nand is generally paid between $1 and 4 per day as part of the โVoluntary Work Program.โ  When \nCoreCivic requires him to work twelve hours or more in one day, he makes up to $8 per day. \n11.  Plaintiff Shoaib Ahmed was detained at Stewart from approximately August 2017 \nto February 2018.  He is a citizen of Bangladesh who gave up his right to fight his asylum case \ndue to the poor living conditions at Stewart, threats, and retaliation by CoreCivic.  Mr. Shoaib \nworked for CoreCivic as a kitchen worker and was paid $4 per day.  If he worked twelve hours \nor more, he was paid an additional $1 per day as part of the โVoluntary Work Program.โ     \nB.  Defendant \n12.  Defendant CoreCivic, formerly the Corrections Corporation of America, is a for-\nprofit  corporation  providing  correctional  and  detention  services.  CoreCivic  is  a  Maryland \ncorporation operating under federal tax laws as a Real Estate Investment Trust (โREITโ), with its \nprincipal office located at 10 Burton Hills Boulevard, Nashville, Tennessee 37215.  CoreCivic \nowns and operates Stewart, where Plaintiffs were or are detained, located at 146 CCA Road, \nLumpkin, Georgia 31815. \n13.  At all relevant times, CoreCivic owned and operated Stewart under contract with \nStewart County, Georgia (โStewart Countyโ).  Stewart County maintains an Intergovernmental \nService  Agreement  (โIGSAโ)  with  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  (โICEโ)  to \ndetain immigrants on behalf of ICE. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Immigration Detention is Civil โ Not Criminal.  \n14.  Each  year,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  individuals  are  locked  up  in  civil \nimmigration detention facilities while awaiting immigration or citizenship status determinations.  \n  4\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 5 of 32\nThose detained include U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (green card holders) with \nlongstanding family and community ties, children, pregnant women, asylum seekers, victims of \nhuman trafficking, and survivors of torture.  Some detained immigrants were brought to the \nUnited States as children.  And thousands ultimately have their United States citizenship or legal \nresidency affirmed by an immigration court or federal judge. \n15.  Immigration violations are civil violations, and immigration detention is civil in \nnature.3  Many detained immigrants have no criminal history at all.   \n16.  Notwithstanding  immigration  detentionโs  civil  nature  and  purpose,  detained \nimmigrants are subjected to prison-like conditions at Stewart.  According to Dora Schriro, \nformer head of ICEโs Office of Detention Policy and Planning, most detained immigrants are \nheld  โ  systematically  and  unnecessarily  โ  under  punitive  circumstances  inappropriate  for \nimmigration detentionโs noncriminal purposes.4  Detained immigrants are frequently subjected to \npunitive  and  long-term  solitary  confinement,  inadequate  medical  care,  sexual  and  physical \nassault, lack of access to counsel, and other harsh conditions of confinement; all without a right \nto a speedy trial, a jury, a government-appointed lawyer, or a duly-entered conviction. \n17.  Many  detained  immigrants,  Plaintiff  Ahmed  included,  accede  to  deportation \nsimply to escape intolerable conditions of confinement, even when they have valid claims to \nremain in the United States, including claims for asylum or other discretionary relief.   \n \n                                                 \n3 See, e.g., INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984) (โA deportation proceeding is a purely \ncivil action to determine eligibility to remain in this country, not to punish an unlawful entryโ); see also \nFong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 728-30 (1893) (observing that deportation proceedings \nhave โall the elements of a civil caseโ and are โin no proper sense a trial or sentence for a crime or \noffenseโ); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952).  \n4 Dora Schriro, Immigration Detention Overview and Recommendations, U.S. Depโt of Homeland Sec., \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement 2-3, 21 (Oct. 6, 2009) available at \nhttps://www.ice.gov/doclib/about/offices/odpp/pdf/ice-detention-rpt.pdf. \n  5\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 6 of 32\nB.  The  Privatization  of  Immigration  Detention  and  CoreCivicโs  Economic \nWindfall. \n \n18.  Immigration detention expanded roughly eightfold over the past two decades, \nfrom a capacity of 5,532 detention beds in 19945 to a current capacity of over 41,000 beds, and \nclimbing.6  \n \n19.  During the same period, CoreCivic and other private prison corporations have \nspent tens of millions of dollars on lobbying efforts.7   \n20.  As  immigration  detention  expanded,  private  prison  corporations,  led  by \nCoreCivic,8 gained a rapidly increasing share of the contracts for new detention beds.9  \n                                                 \n5 Chad C.

CoreCivicโs 2017 revenues were approximately $1.765 billion,10 and its stock is \npublicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, with a market capitalization of approximately \n$2.36 billion11  \n22.  Detention centers for which CoreCivic designated ICE as its โprimary customerโ \naccounted for 25% of CoreCivicโs total revenues in 2017 ($444.1 million).12  CoreCivic officials \nexpect these lucrative immigration detention contracts to account for a significant percentage of \nthe corporationโs ongoing revenues.13   \n \n23.

With  nearly  2,000  beds,  Stewart  is  one  of  the  largest  immigration  detention \ncenters in the nation.  During fiscal year 2017, more deportation proceedings began in Stewart \nthan any other immigration detention center in the country.14  \n25.  Pursuant to the IGSA between ICE and Stewart County, ICE pays the County \n$62.03 per detained immigrant per day.15  Under its 2006 contract with CoreCivic, however, the \nCounty keeps only 85 cents per detained immigrant per day for its โadministrative costs.โ  The \nrest of the money from ICE goes to CoreCivic.  In 2016, CoreCivicโs revenue from Stewart was \napproximately $38 million.16  By contrast, the Countyโs revenue from Stewart was $589,052 for \nthe same year.17  \n26.  CoreCivicโs economic windfall, and the profitability of its immigration detention \nenterprise, arises from its corporate scheme, plan, and pattern of systemically withholding basic \nnecessities from detained immigrants to ensure a readily available, captive labor force that \ncleans, maintains, and operates its facilities for subminimum wages under threat of solitary \nconfinement,  criminal  prosecution,  and  other  sanctions.    Without  this  nearly  free  labor, \nCoreCivicโs windfall from immigrant detention would be substantially decreased. \n                                                 \n14 Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse of Syracuse Univ.

CoreCivic  Uses  Detained  Immigrants  to  Clean,  Maintain,  and  Operate \nStewart. \n \n27.  CoreCivic operates a so-called Voluntary Work Program (โWork Programโ) at \nStewart.  Through this program, CoreCivic uses detained immigrants to perform work that \ndirectly contributes to institutional operations. \n28.  The  Performance  Based  National  Detention  Standards  (โPBNDSโ),  issued  as \nguidance  by  ICE,  delegate  the  site-specific  rules  for  each  Work  Program  to  the  โfacility \nadministratorโ but mandate, inter alia, that each Work Program be in compliance with the \nPBNDS; that all work, other than personal housekeeping, be voluntary and not required; that \ncompensation be โat least $1.00 (USD) per dayโ; and that work be limited to 8 hours per day, 40 \nhours per week.18  \n29.  According to CoreCivicโs Detainee Orientation Handbook, which it provides to \nall detained immigrants at Stewart upon entry, the following work assignments may be available \nthrough the Work Program:  \na.  Administration Porter \nb.  Barber \nc.  Commissary \nd.  Hallway Porter \ne.  Intake Worker \nf.  Kitchen Worker \ng.  Laundry Worker \nh.  Library Worker \ni.

Night Floor Crew \nk.  Pod Porter \nl.  Recreation/Gym Worker \nm.  Sally port/Chemical Porter \nn.  Shower Porter \no.  Unit Law Library Helper \np.  Visitation Porter19 \n30.  In the course of their labor for CoreCivic, detained immigrants in the Work \nProgram perform a wide range of work, including but not limited to: \na.  Scrubbing bathrooms, showers, toilets, and windows; \nb.  Cleaning and maintaining CoreCivicโs on-site medical center;  \nc.  Cleaning patient rooms and medical staff offices; \nd.  Sweeping, mopping, stripping, and waxing floors; \ne.  Washing detained immigrantsโ laundry; \nf.  Preparing, cooking, and serving meals; \ng.  Washing dishes; \nh.  Cleaning the kitchen and cafeteria before and after meals; \ni.  Performing clerical work for CoreCivic;  \nj.  Providing barber services to detained immigrants; \nk.  Cleaning intake areas and solitary confinement units; and \nl.  Cleaning and maintaining recreational areas. \n                                                 \n19 CoreCivic, Detainee Orientation Handbook, Stewart Detention Center 14 (2016) [hereinafter โStewart \nDetainee Handbookโ]. \n  10\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 11 of 32\n31.  CoreCivic  pays  detained  immigrants  who  participate  in  the  Work  Program \ngenerally between $1 and $4 per day.  CoreCivic occasionally increases the wage rate it pays to \nkitchen workers to up to $8 per day when it needs workers to work twelve hours or more per day.  \nUnder no circumstances does CoreCivic pay the detained immigrants the federal minimum wage \nof $7.25 per hour, or the Service Contract Act wages governing the jobs they perform.  In fact, \nthe detained immigrantsโ wages generally are well under $1 per hour. \n32.  The Work Program allows CoreCivic to avoid recruiting from the local labor \nmarket, paying minimum wages, providing detained immigrants in the Work Program with any \nbenefits, paying the costs of potential unionization, and paying federal and state payroll taxes, \nlike Medicare, thereby reducing operational costs and increasing its own profits.  Further, it \nreduces the likelihood of former employees acting as whistleblowers regarding the deplorable \nand unsafe conditions inside Stewart.20 \n33.  Stewart County has the highest poverty rate among all Georgia counties.  With a \npopulation  of  roughly  5,900,  nearly  40%  of  families  live  below  the  poverty  level.21    The \nCountyโs average unemployment rate in February 2018 was 5.3%, which is a 1.2% higher than \nthe national average of 4.9%.22  The median family income is $20,882.23  One hundred percent of \nchildren in Stewart County public schools are reportedly eligible for free or reduced-price meal \nprograms.24 \n                                                 \n20 See, e.g., Urevich, supra note 16. \n21 U.S. Census Bureau, Stewart County, GA, Quick Facts: Income and Poverty, available at \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/stewartcountygeorgia/IPE120216 (last visited Apr.12, \n2018). \n22 Georgia Department of Labor, Georgia Labor Force Estimates 8 (2018), \nhttps://dol.georgia.gov/sites/dol.georgia.gov/files/related_files/document/laborforce.pdf \n23 U.S. Census Bureau, supra note 21. \n24 Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning, FY2016 Free and Reduced Lunch School Data, \nQualitied Schools, 24, http://decal.ga.gov/documents/attachments/16FreeRedQualSchools.pdf. \n  11\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 12 of 32\n34.  According to CoreCivic, it employs around 300 people at Stewart, outside of the \nWork Program,25 only 96 of whom are Stewart County residents.26  CoreCivic fills a substantial \nnumber of jobs at Stewart with detained immigrants in the Work Program who work for nearly \nfree.   \n35.  While  CoreCivic  profits  handsomely  from  the  labor  of  detained  immigrants \nlocked inside Stewart, the company locks out many Stewart County residents from jobs and the \neconomic growth and prosperity that comes with fair-paying work. \nD.  CoreCivic Withholds Necessary Care from Detained Immigrants at Stewart.  \n \n36.  Despite  its  name,  the  โVoluntary  Work  Programโ  is  not  โvoluntaryโ  in  any \nmeaningful sense.  CoreCivic maintains a corporate scheme, plan, and pattern at Stewart of \ndepriving detained immigrants with basic necessities; outside contact with loved  ones; and \nthreatening them with serious harm, isolation, and criminal prosecution.  As a result, detained \nimmigrants are forced to submit to CoreCivicโs labor scheme in order to buy necessities from the \ncommissary  (including  food,  hygiene  products,  and  phone  cards)  and  to  avoid  solitary \nconfinement and other sanctions. \n37.  CoreCivic owns and operates the commissary inside Stewart.  The commissary is \nthe only place at Stewart where detained immigrants can purchase necessities, including hygiene \nproducts, clothes, food, and phone cards.  Pursuant to corporate policy, CoreCivic is required to \nuse any profits or interest earned from the commissary towards welfare expenditures for detained \nimmigrants.  \n                                                 \n25 Harry Franklin, Facility to house immigrants Official ink deal to detain inmates to be deported, \nColumbus Ledger-Enquirer, Jul. 11, 2006 available at 2006 WLNR 11899060; Jeremy Redmon, \nDetention center is largest in nation, Atlanta Journal-Const., Jan. 16, 2011 available at 2011 WLNR \n930948. \n26 Caleb Bauer, CoreCivic has history of complaints, violations, S. Bend Trib., Jan. 17, 2018, \nhttps://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/corecivic-has-history-of-complaints-\nviolations/article_9355aa57-8309-56f6-9072-1e2f8e035a3c.html. \n  12\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 13 of 32\n38.  Detained immigrants must use funds from their โinmate fund accountโ to make \npurchases at the commissary.  All of the detained immigrantsโ wages from the Work Program are \ndeposited into this account.   \n39.  When  detained  immigrants  in  the  Work  Program  make  purchases  at  the \ncommissary,  they  are  giving  their  wages  directly  back  to CoreCivic  in  a  โcompany  storeโ \nscenario.  This scenario is compounded by CoreCivicโs scheme, plan, and pattern of intentionally \ndepriving detained immigrants of basic necessities, such as hygiene products, that can only be \npurchased at the commissary. \n40.  CoreCivicโs  scheme  of  intentionally  depriving  detained  immigrants  of  basic \nnecessities and its failure to meet federal standards concerning housing, food, and hygiene \nproducts is well-documented.27   \n41.  According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Inspector \nGeneral (OIG), Stewart has โbathrooms that were in poor condition, including mold and peeling  \npaint on walls, floors, and showers.โ28  Some bathrooms at Stewart lack hot water, while some \nshowers lack cold water.29  \n                                                 \n27 See Ben Norton, Privatized for-profit immigrant detention centers are a โliving nightmare,โ \ninvestigation shows, Salon (May 16, 2017), https://www.salon.com/2017/05/16/privatized-for-profit-\nimmigrant-detention-centers-are-a-living-nightmare-investigation-shows_partner/; Christie Thompson, \nWelcome to Stewart Detention Center, the Black Hole of America's Immigration System, VICE (Dec. 11, \n2016), https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypv59j/ welcome-to-stewart-detention-center-the-black-hole-\nof-the-immigration-system;  S.

The OIG has also found that Stewart fails to provide โbasic hygienic products, \nsuch as toilet paper, soap, lotion, and toothpaste . . . promptly or at all when detainees ran out of \nthem.โ30  Officers instruct detained immigrants to buy these necessities from the commissary \nwhen they run out.31 \n43.  The same report from the OIG observes that Stewart stores โspoiled, wilted, and \nmoldy produce and other food in kitchen refrigerators, as well as food past its expiration date.โ32  \nOther food safety issues, according to the federal government, include โexpired frozen food, \nincluding meat, and thawing meat without labels indicating when it had begun thawing or the \ndate by which it must be used.โ33 \n44.  In addition to depriving detained immigrants of basic necessities like safe and \nsufficient food and hygienic products, CoreCivic has a scheme, plan, and pattern of depriving \ndetained immigrants of outside contact with loved ones to compel detained immigrants to work \nin order to purchase costly phone cards from the commissary. \n45.  Stewart is geographically isolated and isolating for detained immigrants.  It is \noutside the town of Lumpkin, Georgia, which has a population of 1,123 (not including the \ndetained immigrants).34  It is a two and one-half hour drive from Atlanta, Georgia.  The people \nwho are able to make the trip to the detention center to visit a loved one are limited to non-\ncontact visits.  They must view each other through a plate glass window and speak through a \nclosed-circuit telephone.  These visits are limited to an hour.   \n                                                                                                                                                             \n29 Id. \n30 Id.

Talton Communications (โTaltonโ), the company that provides Stewartโs phone \nservice, provides the only way for detained immigrants to call anyone outside the detention \ncenter.  Talton takes advantage of this monopoly by charging excessively high rates for detained \nimmigrants to make telephone calls.  Therefore, most detained immigrants are not able to speak \nwith family members for more than a few minutes every week, and at great expense. \n47.  Detained immigrants must purchase Talton phone cards at the commissary to \nmake outside calls.  Many detained immigrants submit to the Work Program to purchase these \ncostly phone cards so they can maintain contact with loved ones.35  \nE.  CoreCivic Threatens to Put Detained Immigrants in Solitary Confinement, \nAmong Other Sanctions, for Refusing to Work. \n \n48.  CoreCivic  maintains  a  corporate  scheme,  plan,  and  pattern  at  Stewart  of \nthreatening detained immigrants who refuse to work, organize a work stoppage, or participate in \na  work  stoppage  with  โdisciplinary  segregationโ  (i.e.,  solitary  confinement),  criminal \nprosecution,  downgrading  the  detained  immigrantsโ  housing,  and/or  revoking  access  to  the \ncommissary, among other sanctions. \n49.  CoreCivicโs  Stewart  Detainee  Orientation  Handbook,  which  every  individual \ndetained at Stewart receives upon entry, categorizes โ[e]ncouraging others to participate in a \nwork stoppage or to refuse to work,โ as a High Offense category, the second-highest offense \ncategory.  As a result, encouraging others to participate in a work stoppage is punishable by, \ninter alia: \na.  โInitiat[ion] [of] criminal proceedingsโ; \nb.  โDisciplinary Segregation (Up to 30 days)โ; \nc.  โLoss of privileges: commissary, movies, recreation, etc.โ; and \n                                                 \n35 Imprisoned Justice, at 30. \n  15\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 16 of 32\nd.   โChang[ing] housingโ or โRestrict[ion] to housing unit.โ36  \n50.  CoreCivic  maintains  a  corporate  scheme,  plan,  and  pattern  at  Stewart  of \nthreatening  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  who  refuse  to  work  with  โintiat[ing]  criminal \nproceedingsโ against them, which constitutes a threatened abuse of the legal process. \n51.  CoreCivicโs overuse of disciplinary measures such as solitary confinement at \nStewart is well-documented.37 \n52.  The  OIG  has  expressed  โconcerns  about  a  lack  of  professionalism  and \ninappropriate treatment by Detention Center staff, which fostered a culture of disrespect and \ndisregard for detaineesโ basic rights.โ38  Detained immigrants have been โdisciplined, including \nbeing segregated or locked down in their cells, without adequate documentation in the detaineeโs \nfile to justify the disciplinary action.โ39  \n53.  In  June  2017,  officials  at  Stewart  held  a  detained  immigrant  in  solitary \nconfinement for nearly 30 days for allegedly encouraging others to participate in a work \nstoppage. \n                                                 \n36 Stewart Detainee Handbook, at 31-32. \n37See Ben Norton, Privatized for-profit immigrant detention centers are a โliving nightmare,โ \ninvestigation shows, Salon (May 16, 2017), https://www.salon.com/2017/05/16/privatized-for-profit-\nimmigrant-detention-centers-are-a-living-nightmare-investigation-shows_partner/; S.

CoreCivic also maintains a corporate scheme, plan, and pattern at Stewart of \nthreatening Plaintiffs and Class Members who refuse to work with โchanging housingโ to living \nquarters that are less safe, sanitary, and private. \n55.  Detained immigrants who submit to the Work Program are often provided with \nmore favorable living quarters, including โpodsโ that have private two-person cells, access to a \ncommon area, a shared bathroom with one cellmate, and a shower with temperature control. \n56.  These smaller pods are in stark contrast to the open dormitories.  The open \ndormitories house up to 66 people, in 33 bunk beds.  There is no privacy.  The lights in these \ndorms are on all day and night, requiring some detained immigrants to fold socks over their eyes \nin order to sleep.  There is one bathroom in these dorms with three to four toilets, three to four \nurinals, and four sinks.  This shared bathroom is often filthy, to the extent that the pod residents \nat times gag from the overwhelming and festering stench.  The showers in the open dormitories \ndo not have temperature control and provide only extremely hot water.  The open dormitories are \nalso the site of frequent conflict and even violence.  Indeed, the detained immigrants refer to \nopen  dormitories  as  โEl  Gallinero,โ  or  โthe  Chicken  Coop,โ  for  both  the  conditions  and \novercrowded living quarters. \n57.  CoreCivic  maintains  a  corporate  scheme,  plan,  and  pattern  at  Stewart  of \nthreatening Plaintiffs and Class Members with loss of access to the commissary when they refuse \nto work.   \n58.  Plaintiffs and Class Members rely on access to the commissary to purchase the \nbasic necessities that CoreCivic does not adequately provide and phone cards to maintain contact \nwith loved ones.  \n  17\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 18 of 32\n59.  By maintaining this scheme, plan, and pattern of threatening Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers who refuse to work with solitary confinement and other sanctions, CoreCivic ensures \nan available labor pool of detained immigrants will work for nearly free, thus allowing it to \ncontinue operating Stewart at an enormous profit.  \n60.  CoreCivic knowingly benefitted financially, both by way of reduced labor costs \nand increased commissary revenue, from participating in a venture CoreCivic knew or should \nhave known forced Plaintiffs and Class Members to work, or attempted to force them to work. \nF.  Plaintiff Barrientosโ Labor at Stewart \n61.  Mr. Barrientos has performed work for CoreCivic at Stewart as a result of its \nunlawful forced labor scheme, plan, and pattern.   \n62.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Barrientos washes dishes, serves meals, and prepares \nfood for detained immigrants at Stewart.  He regularly works eight to nine-hour shifts per day, \nseven days per week.  \n63.  Prior to March 2018, Mr. Barrientos was paid $4 per day.  If he worked more than \ntwelve hours in one day, he was paid $5 per day.  If Mr. Barrientos worked seven consecutive \ndays in one week, he was compensated with a $5 phone card on top of his weekly wages.  \n64.  After March 2018, CoreCivicโs pay scheme changed.  Currently, Mr. Barrientos is \npaid $1 per day if he works less than six hours, $4 per day if he works for six hours, $5 per day if \nhe works between eight and eleven hours and fifty-nine minutes, and $8 per day if he works \ntwelve hours or more.  CoreCivic credits these wages to Mr. Barrientosโ commissary account. \n65.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Barrientos has been forced to cook and serve spoiled \nfood to detained immigrants after complaining about the expired food to kitchen supervisors.  \n  18\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 19 of 32\n66.  CoreCivic denies Mr. Barrientos access to basic necessities that he then has to \npurchase at Stewartโs commissary with his wages from the Work Program.  In one instance, Mr.  \nBarrientos ran out of toilet paper and requested another roll from a CoreCivic officer.  The \nCoreCivic officer told Mr. Barrientos to use his fingers to clean himself. \n67.  Mr. Barrientos spends his wages on soap, tooth paste, food, clothes, phone cards, \nand other necessities from the commissary. \n68.  Mr. Barrientos is housed in a pod with private, two-person cells that contain a \nbathroom to be shared with his cellmate, and he is provided with access to a shower that has both \nhot and cold water.  \n69.  Officers at Stewart have threatened to transfer Mr. Barrientos from his pod to the \nChicken Coop if he stops working, calls in sick, refuses to change shifts as requested, or \nencourages others to stop working.  \n70.  On one occasion, a CoreCivic Officer named Garden40 woke up Mr. Barrientos \nand ordered him to work a 2 a.m. shift, even though he was assigned the 10 a.m. shift that day.  \nWhen Mr. Barrientos refused, the officer told him to pack his bags because he was being moved \nto another pod.  Mr. Barrientos relented and worked the early shift because he was afraid of \nbeing placed back in the Chicken Coop. \n71.  Officers  at  Stewart  threatened  Mr.  Barrientos  with  denial  of  access  to  the \ncommissary if he stopped working, called in sick, or encouraged others to stop working. \n72.  Around late 2015, CoreCivic officers threatened to put Mr. Barrientos in solitary \nconfinement on two different occasions because they thought he and other kitchen workers were \norganizing a work stoppage.   \n                                                 \n40 Mr. Barrientos is unsure of the precise spelling of this Officerโs name and therefore acknowledges that \nthis spelling is an approximation. \n  19\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 20 of 32\n73.  Around  October  2017,  CoreCivic  officers  put  Mr.  Barrientos  in  medical \nsegregation, allegedly for chicken pox, soon after he submitted a grievance against an officer \nwho forced Mr. Barrientos to work while he was sick.  Mr. Barrientos informed the officers that \nhe had chicken pox as a child and was therefore unlikely to contract it again.  CoreCivic detained \nMr. Barrientos in medical segregation for two months and, despite a blood test, never informed \nhim whether he had contracted chicken pox so as to justify his segregation. \n74.  While in segregation, Mr. Barrientos was in a cell by himself and was denied \nbasic necessities and privileges.  He was not allowed to see his family.  His outdoor yard time \nwas reduced from three to four hours per day to a half hour per day.  As a result of his medical \nsegregation, the immigration court had to reschedule a hearing in his immigration case thereby \nprolonging resolution of his case.  \n75.  Mr. Barrientos provides CoreCivic with his labor because of CoreCivicโs threats \nof physical restraint, serious harm, and/or abuse of the legal process; and its scheme, plan, and \npattern to threaten or inflict physical restraint and serious harm upon him if he refuses to work. \n76.  CoreCivic has retained and currently retains the value of Mr. Barrientosโ labor as \ncorporate profits instead of using it to provide for safe, minimally humane living conditions for \ndetained immigrants at Stewart or to compensate Mr. Barrientos fairly.   \nG.  Plaintiff Velazquezโs Labor at Stewart   \n77.  Mr. Velazquez has performed work for CoreCivic at Stewart as a result of its \nunlawful forced labor scheme, plan, and pattern.   \n78.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Velazquez washes dishes and prepares beverages during \nmeal services for other detained immigrants at Stewart.  On average, he works six to eight hours \nper day, five days per week. \n  20\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 21 of 32\n79.  For his labor, Mr. Velazquez is paid $1 per day if he works less than six hours, $4 \nper day if he works for six hours, $5 per day if he works between eight and eleven hours and \nfifty-nine minutes, and $8 per day if he works twelve hours or more.  CoreCivic credits these \nwages to Mr. Velazquezโs commissary account. \n80.  CoreCivic denies Mr. Velazquez access to basic necessities that he then has to \npurchase at Stewartโs commissary with his wages from the Work Program.  Mr. Velazquez uses \nhis  wages  to  purchase  phone  cards  and  food  at  CoreCivicโs  commissary,  among  other \nnecessities.  \n81.  Mr. Velazquez is housed in a pod with private, two-person cells.  He shares a \nbathroom with only one other person, his cellmate, and has access to a shower with temperature \ncontrol. \n82.  Mr.  Velazquez  has  witnessed  CoreCivic  officers  threaten  to  move  detained \nimmigrants who decline to work from their small pods like his to the Chicken Coop.  \n83.  Mr. Velazquez provides CoreCivic forced labor because of its threats of physical \nrestraint, serious harm, and/or abuse of the legal process; and its scheme, plan, and pattern to \nthreaten or inflict physical restraint and serious harm upon him if he does not. \n84.  CoreCivic has retained and currently retains the value of Mr. Velazquezโs labor as \ncorporate profits instead of using it to provide for safer, more humane living conditions for \ndetained immigrants at Stewart or compensate Mr. Velazquez fairly.  \nH.  Plaintiff Ahmedโs Labor at Stewart \n85.  Mr. Ahmed was detained at Stewart from approximately August 2016 to February \n2018. \n  21\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 22 of 32\n86.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Ahmed prepared, cooked, and served meals, washed \ndishes, and cleaned the kitchen area.  He worked eight-hour shifts, starting at 2:00 a.m., up to \nseven days per week. \n87.  In return for this labor, Mr. Ahmed was paid $4 per day.  If he worked twelve \nhours or more, he was paid an additional $1 per day. CoreCivic credited these wages to Mr. \nAhmedโs commissary account.  \n88.  CoreCivic denied Mr. Ahmed access to basic necessities that he then had to \npurchase at Stewartโs commissary with his wages from the Work Program.  Mr. Ahmed spent his \nwages on food and phone cards from the commissary, among other necessities. \n89.  Officers at Stewart threatened to put Mr. Ahmed in solitary confinement, if he \nstopped working or encouraged other detained immigrants to stop working. \n90.  In  November  2017,  officers  at  Stewart  actually  put  Mr.  Ahmed  in  solitary \nconfinement  for  threatening  a  work  stoppage  after  he  had  not  been  paid  for  his  work.  \nSpecifically,  officers  at  Stewart  held  Mr.  Ahmed  in  solitary  confinement  for  ten  days  for \nallegedly saying โno work tomorrow.โ41   \n91.  Mr. Ahmed provided CoreCivic forced labor because of its threats of restraint, \nserious harm, and/or abuse of the legal process; and its scheme, plan, and practice to threaten or \ninflict restraint and serious harm upon him if he does not. \n92.  CoreCivic retained the value of Mr. Ahmedโs labor by realizing this value as \ncorporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more humane living conditions for \ndetained immigrants at Stewart. \n \n                                                 \n41 Spencer Woodman, Private Prison Continues To Send ICE Detainees To Solitary Confinement For \nRefusing Voluntary Labor, The Intercept (Jan. 11, 2018), https://theintercept.com/2018/01/11/ice-\ndetention-solitary-confinement. \n  22\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 23 of 32\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n93.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit as a class action on behalf of themselves individually \nand all others similarly situated under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a), (b)(2) for their \nrequests for declaratory and injunctive relief only, and (b)(3) for their requests for damages.  \nThis  action  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  adequacy,  predominance,  and \nsuperiority requirements of those provisions.  \nA.

Excluded from the class definitions are the defendants, their officers, directors, \nmanagement,  employees,  subsidiaries,  and  affiliates,  and  all  federal  governmental  entities.  \nPlaintiffs  reserve  the  right  to  revise  the  class  definition  based  upon  information  learned \nsubsequent to the filing of this action. \nB.   Class Certification Requirements under Rule 23(a), (b)(2), and (b)(3).  \n96.  Numerosity:  The  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \nimpracticable.  Plaintiffs do not know the exact size of the class because that information is \nwithin the control of CoreCivic.  However, upon information and belief, the class members \nnumber in the thousands.  Membership in the class is readily ascertainable from CoreCivicโs \ndetention and Work Program records.   \n  23\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 24 of 32\n97.  Commonality: There are numerous questions of law or fact common to the Class, \nand those issues predominate over any question affecting only individual class members.  The \ncommon legal and factual issues include the following: \na.  Whether CoreCivicโs conduct as set forth in Count I violated the forced labor and \nattempt provisions of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589, 1594, and \n1595); \nb.  Whether CoreCivic was unjustly enriched by the Work Program; \nc.  Whether Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to equitable relief, including \ninjunctive and declaratory relief; and  \nd.  Whether Plaintiffs and the Class Members are entitled to damages and other \nmonetary relief and, if so, in what amount. \n98.  Typicality: The claims asserted by Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the \nClass, in that the representative Plaintiffs, like all Class Members, were subject to and impacted \nby CoreCivicโs uniform policy.  Each member of the proposed Class has been similarly injured \nby CoreCivicโs misconduct. \n99.  Adequacy: Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  \nPlaintiffs have retained attorneys experienced in class and complex litigation, including litigation \narising under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.  Plaintiffs and their counsel intend to \nvigorously prosecute this litigation.  Neither Plaintiffs nor their counsel have interests that \nconflict with the interests of the other class members.  \n100.  Predominance of Common Questions: The questions of law or fact common to \nthe class, identified above in paragraph 97, predominate over any questions affecting only \n  24\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 25 of 32\nindividual members.  Specifically, CoreCivicโs scheme, plan, and pattern to force labor applies \nto the class as a whole and has resulted in substantially similar injuries to the class.  \n101.  Superiority: Plaintiffs and Class Members have all suffered and will continue to \nsuffer harm and damages as a result of CoreCivicโs wrongful conduct.  A class action is superior \nto other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.  Treatment \nas a class action will permit a large number of similarly situated persons to adjudicate their \ncommon claims in a single forum simultaneously, efficiently, and without the duplication of \neffort and expense that numerous individual actions would engender.  Class treatment will also \npermit  the  adjudication  of  claims  by  many  members of the proposed class who could not \nindividually afford to litigate a claim such as is asserted in this complaint.  Additionally, a class \naction is superior because the Class is comprised of many individuals who do not speak English \nas their native language and who are geographically dispersed.  Finally, this class action likely \npresents no difficulties in management that would preclude maintenance as a class action.  \n102.  This action satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) because CoreCivic has \nacted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate \nfinal injunctive and/or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to each Class Member. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nCOUNT I \n \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT  \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1589)  \nOr, in the Alternative, Attempt to Commit Forced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a)). \nOn behalf of the Forced Labor Class \n \n103.  Plaintiffs and Class Members reallege and incorporate by reference herein all \nallegations above.   \n  25\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 26 of 32\n104.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members are authorized to bring this claim \nagainst CoreCivic pursuant to the civil remedies provision of the Trafficking Victims Protection \nAct (โTVPAโ), 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595, because CoreCivic violated the forced labor provisions of 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 1589 or, in the alternative, the attempt provisions of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a).   \n105.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members also are authorized to bring this claim \nunder the TVPA, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595, because CoreCivic knowingly benefitted financially from \nparticipating in a venture which CoreCivic knew or should have known has engaged in violations \nof the forced labor or, in the alternative, the attempt provisions of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a). \n106.  CoreCivic  knowingly  obtained  the  labor  or  services  of  Plaintiffs  and  Forced \nLabor Class Members by means of physical restraint and threats of physical restraint of Plaintiffs \nand Members of the Forced Labor Class, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a)(1).  Specifically, \nCoreCivic threatened to or did restrain Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members in solitary \nconfinement when they refused orders to work. \n107.  CoreCivic  knowingly  obtained  the  labor  or  services  of  Plaintiffs  and  Forced \nLabor Class Members by means of serious harm and threats of serious harm, in violation of 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 1589(a)(2).   \n108.  The serious harm CoreCivic caused and threatened was physical and non-physical \nharm, including psychological, financial, and reputational harm.  Specifically,  \na.  Withholding  of  Basic  Necessities:  CoreCivic  withheld  or \nthreatened to withhold basic necessities from Plaintiffs and Forced \nLabor  Class  Members,  thereby  forcing  them  to  work  for \nsubminimum  wages  to  buy  those  basic  necessities  at  the \ncommissary and avoid hunger, undernourishment, lack of personal \nhygiene, and lack of contact with loved ones, among other harms;  \n \n \n  \n  26\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 27 of 32\nb.  Threatened and Actual Sanctions: When CoreCivic perceived that \nPlaintiffs  and  Forced  Labor  Class  members  were  refusing  to \nprovide their labor, organizing a work stoppage, or participating in \na work stoppage, CoreCivic  \n \ni.  placed  or  threatened  to  place  them  into \nsolitary confinement; \nii.  threatened criminal prosecution;  \niii.  threatened to transfer them to unsafe and \nunsanitary  living  quarters,  where  they \nwould be deprived of privacy, safety, and \nsanitation; and \niv.  threatened  to  deny  them  access  to  the \ncommissary where they could buy food, \nhygiene products, and phone cards, thus \ndenying  them  basic  necessities  and \nisolating them from friends and family.  \n \n109.  The conduct described in paragraph 108, supra, is โserious harmโ as defined in 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 1589(c)(2) because it is โsufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, \nto compel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances [of \nPlaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members] to perform or to continue performing labor or \nservices in order to avoid incurring that harm.โ \n110.  CoreCivic  knowingly  obtained  the  labor  or  services  of  Plaintiffs  and  Forced \nLabor Class Members โby means of a scheme, plan, or pattern [CoreCivic] intended to cause โฆ \n[Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members] to believe that, if โฆ [Plaintiffs and Forced Labor \nClass Members] did not perform such labor or services, โฆ [they] would suffer serious harm or \nphysical  restraintโ  as  described  in  paragraphs  105-108,  supra,  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.  ยง \n1589(a)(4). \n111.  CoreCivic  knowingly  obtained  the  labor  or  services  of  Plaintiffs  and  Forced \nLabor Class Members by means of abuse or threatened abuse of legal process, in violation of 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 1589(a)(3).  Specifically, CoreCivic threatened to initiate criminal proceedings against \n  27\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 28 of 32\nPlaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members to obtain their labor and to prevent them from \nrefusing to work. \n112.  In the alternative, CoreCivic attempted to obtain the labor or services of Plaintiffs \nand  Forced  Labor  Class  Members  by  the  means  described  paragraphs  105-108,  supra,  in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a).  \n113.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members have suffered damages in an amount \nto be determined at trial.  \n114.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members are entitled to recover compensatory \nand punitive damages. \n115.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members are entitled to recover mandatory \nrestitution in the full amount of their losses.  \n116.  Plaintiffs and Forced Labor Class Members are entitled to recover their costs and \nreasonable attorneyโs fees.  \nCOUNT II \nOn behalf of the Unjust Enrichment Class \nUNJUST ENRICHMENT \nGeorgia Common Law \n117.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations above. \n118.  CoreCivic materially and significantly reduced its labor costs and expenses, and \nincreased its corporate profits, by obtaining undercompensated labor from Plaintiffs and Unjust \nEnrichment Class Members. \n119.  Plaintiffs  and  Unjust  Enrichment  Class  Members  conferred  non-gratuitous \nbenefits upon CoreCivic by performing work for $1 to $4 per day, and up to $8 per day for \nkitchen workers under certain circumstances, for which CoreCivic would otherwise have had to \npay  at  least  the  applicable  minimum  wage  or  more,  thereby  significantly  and  materially \n  28\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 29 of 32\nincreasing CoreCivicโs profits and unjustly enriching CoreCivic at the expense of and detriment \nto Plaintiffs and Unjust Enrichment Class Members. \n120.  CoreCivicโs retention of any benefit collected directly and indirectly from this \nundercompensated labor violated principles of justice, equity, and good conscience.  \n121.  As a direct and proximate result of CoreCivicโs forced labor practices, Plaintiffs \nand  Unjust  Enrichment  Class  Members  have  suffered  concrete  harm  and  injury,  including \nphysical and emotional injury, and the unlawful violation of their rights.     \n122.  Plaintiffs and Unjust Enrichment Class Members are entitled to recover from \nCoreCivic all amounts that CoreCivic has wrongfully and improperly obtained, and CoreCivic \nshould be required to disgorge to Plaintiffs and Unjust Enrichment Class Members the benefits it \nhas unjustly obtained. Plaintiffs and Class Members are also entitled to recover exemplary \ndamages.     \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the Class, request that the \nCourt:   \na.  Certify this action as a class action, with the classes as defined above;  \nb.  Find  that  Plaintiffs  are  proper  representatives  of  the  classes,  and  appoint  the \nundersigned as Class Counsel; \n \nc.  Order CoreCivic to identify and disclose to Plaintiffs all Class Members; \n \nd.  Order CoreCivic to pay for notifying Class Members of the pendency of this suit;  \n \ne.  Award declaratory and other equitable relief as is necessary to protect the interests of \nPlaintiffs and Class Members; \n \nf.  Award injunctive relief as is necessary to protect the interests of Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers,  including  enjoining  CoreCivic  from  continuing  to  conduct  business \nthrough the unlawful and unfair practices alleged herein; \n \n  29\n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 1   Filed 04/17/18   Page 30 of 32\ng.

Vacillation typically means that the party with \nthe burden of carrying the issue has failed to do so.  And that is \nthe case here.  The Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to \ncarry  their  burden  of  establishing  that  this  case  should  be \ncertified for class action purposes.  Their motion (ECF Nos. 213 \n& 238) is therefore denied. \nDISCUSSION \nA class action may only be certified if the party seeking \nclass certification satisfies, โthrough evidentiary proof,โ all \nthe requirements specified in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) \nplus at least one of the requirements set forth in Rule 23(b). \nComcast Corp. v.

Plaintiffs have the burden to prove that the \nclass certification requirements are met.  Brown v. Electrolux \nHome Prods., Inc., 817 F.3d 1225, 1233 (11th Cir. 2016).  With \nthese standards in mind, the Court analyzes Plaintiffsโ motion for \nclass certification, starting with some factual background. \nI.

The \nCourt will describe the voluntary work program, the โdeprivation \nscheme,โ and the work program discipline policies. \nCoreCivic must provide Stewart detainees an opportunity to \nparticipate  in  a  voluntary  work  program.

Detainees may receive funds from outside sources or \nmay earn money in the work program.2 \nPlaintiffs contend that the food, clothing, and hygiene items \nStewart provides to its detainees are so inadequate that detainees \nwould suffer serious harm if they could not earn funds through the \nwork  program  and  purchase  necessities  from  the  commissary.  \nPlaintiffs also allege that detainee workers are assigned to safer \nhousing than non-workers.  Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs \nargue that some detainees are coerced to join the work program and \nthen become trapped in it.

Analysis \nPlaintiffs  seek  to  certify  two  classes  pursuant  to  Rule \n23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3): a Forced Labor Class and an Unjust \nEnrichment  Class.    Both  classes  include  all  civil  immigration \ndetainees who participated in Stewartโs โvolunteer work program.โ  \nThe Forced Labor Classโs claims are under the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act (โTVPAโ,) 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589 et seq., and the Unjust \nEnrichment Classโs claims are under Georgia unjust enrichment law.  \nAll the claims are based on Plaintiffsโ assertion that the work \nprogram  is  not  voluntaryโthat  CoreCivic  coerces  detainees  to \nperform labor at Stewart by using or threatening serious harm and \nphysical restraint if work program participants refuse to work.  \nCoreCivic,  on  the  other  hand,  contends  that  Plaintiffs  cannot \nestablish  causation  on  a  class-wide  basis,  which  would  defeat \nascertainability, numerosity, commonality, and typicality. \n \nthat any Stewart detainee was ever reclassified to a higher security \nrisk category (or threatened with reclassification) based on refusal to \nwork.  For these reasons, Plaintiffs did not establish that detainees \nwere subjected to a common practice under which they were threatened \nwith criminal legal action or harm to their immigration proceedings if \nthey refused to work in the work program. \n7 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 8 of 18\n \nNotwithstanding the complexity of the briefing, the issue is \nrelatively simple.  Are the claims of the putative class members \nsufficiently common and typical such that litigating them together \nas a certified class is appropriate under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23?  When all the rhetoric and hyperbole is peeled away, \nthe essence of Plaintiffsโ claims is that CoreCivic created an \nenvironment which had the effect of coercing putative class members \nto participate in the work program, and then, upon signing up for \nthe program, the putative class members were trapped in the program \nand unable to escape it.  While policies and practices may have \nexisted that applied to every putative class member who chose to \nparticipate in the program, Plaintiffs fail to recognize that not \nevery putative class member is similarly situated with other class \nmembers. \nBefore certifying a class, the Court must consider โhow the \nclass  will  prove  causationโ  and  whether  the  elements  of  the \nplaintiffsโ claims โwill be subject to class-wide proof.โ  Cordoba \nv. DIRECTV, LLC, 942 F.3d 1259, 1273 (11th Cir. 2019) (quoting \nWilliams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., 568 F.3d 1350, 1358) (11th Cir. \n2009)).  If Plaintiffs cannot prove causation using class-wide \nevidence,  then  that  creates  problems  with  ascertainability, \ntypicality,  numerosity,  and  superiority  (because  it  is  not \npossible to tell which putative class members suffered an injury \nand  thus  have  standing  absent  an  individualized  inquiry)  and \n8 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 9 of 18\n \npredominance  (because  individualized  questions  of  causation \npredominate over common issues). \nPlaintiffs have not established that the critical issue of \ncausation  is  susceptible  to  class-wide  proof  under  the \ncircumstances presented here.  There is no dispute that the TVPAโs \nforced labor provision requires a plaintiff to prove causationโ\nthat the defendant knowingly procured labor โby means ofโ physical \nrestraint, serious harm, threats of physical restraint or serious \nharm, or a scheme intended to threaten serious harm or physical \nrestraint.  18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a).  Plaintiffsโ unjust enrichment \nclaims  are  based  on  their  contention  that  all  work  program \nparticipants were coerced to participate.  So, at its core, this \naction is about whether the worker detainees decided to participate \nand remain in the work program because CoreCivic would subject \nthem to some type of harm if they did not work.  Plaintiffs contend \nthat  class-wide  evidence  should  be  sufficient  to  prove  that \nCoreCivic  knowingly  established  a  scheme  intended  to  coerce \ndetainees  to  participate  in  the  work  program,  so  class-wide \nevidence can also prove that CoreCivic obtained the labor of all \ndetainee work program participants โby means ofโ that scheme.  The \nCourt is not convinced. \nPlaintiffs simply did not point to sufficient evidence from \nwhich the Court could reasonably conclude that every putative class \nmember agreed to participate in the Stewart work program because \n9 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 10 of 18\n \nhe was coerced to do soโor that this issue is capable of class-\nwide  resolution.    While  each  putative  member  may  have  been \nsubjected do the same conditions of confinement, the Court cannot \nfind based on the current record that all putative class members \nperceived the conditions of confinement the same way or that those \nconditions  were  the  motivating  factor  for  the  putative  class \nmemberโs decision to join the work program.  The record in fact \nindicates that 80% of the detainees chose not to participate in \nthe work program even though they were presumably subjected to the \nsame conditions as those who chose to participate in the program.  \nAnd two out of the three named Plaintiffs had sufficient personal \nfunds in their detainee trust accounts to purchase food at the \ncommissary,  which  belies  counselโs  contention  that  they  were \ncoerced to join the work program because it was their only means \nfor purchasing food or other essential items from the commissary.  \nAccordingly,  the  Court  cannot  conclude  that  every  reasonable \ndetainee would have felt coerced to participate in the program.  \nSome may have felt that way and some may not have perceived the \nconditions as coercive.  Those who found the conditions coercive \nmay have an individual claim, and those who did not may not have \nsuch  a  claim.    That  determination  requires  an  individualized \nassessment of each detaineeโs situation, with individual issues \npredominating over common ones.  \n10 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 11 of 18\n \nThe claim that detainees were trapped in the work program \nonce they signed up for it suffers from the same commonality, \ntypicality, and predominance problems.  There are several reasons \nwhy some putative class members may have wished to remain in the \nprogram voluntarilyโincluding earning funds to buy non-essential \nitems from the commissary and earning funds to save for use upon \nrelease from the detention facility.  The Court cannot find based \non  the  current  record  that  no  reasonable  detainee  would  have \nremained in the program voluntarily or even that most reasonable \ndetainees continued to participate in the program because they \nfelt they had no choice given the conditions of confinement and \nthe potential discipline for refusal to work.  Evaluating these \nissues requires an individualized assessment of each detaineeโs \nsituation.  The Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden on these \nissues.4 \nThis case is different than a conditions of confinement case \nin which the challenged conditions of confinement apply in the \nsame manner to each detainee and where causation can be inferred \nfrom common class-wide evidence, with no individualized evidence \n \n4 Plaintiffs point out that it is a violation of the TVPA to attempt to \nprocure labor by means of serious harm, physical restraint, or threats \nof serious harm and physical restraint, so even if a detainee was not \nsubjectively  coerced  to  provide  labor,  CoreCivic  still  attempted  to \nobtain his labor by coercive means.  18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a).  But 18 U.S.C. \nยง 1595(a) only provides a civil remedy for an โindividual who is a victim \nof a violationโ of the TVPA.  18 U.S.C. ยง 1595(a).  Plaintiffs did not \npoint to any authority that a person who is impervious to attempted \ncoercion is nonetheless a โvictimโ within the meaning of ยง 1595(a). \n11 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 12 of 18\n \nthat  could  otherwise  explain  the  class  membersโ  conduct.    In \nMenocal v. GEO Group, Inc., for example, the Tenth Circuit found \nthat the detainees were subjected to a uniform policy under which \ndetainees were threatened with physical restraint or serious harm \nif they refused to perform mandatory unpaid cleaning assignments.  \n882 F.3d 905, 916-17 (10th Cir. 2018).  The Tenth Circuit further \nconcluded that because the class members received notice of the \nsanitation  policyโs  terms  (including  possible  sanctions  for \nrefusing to clean) and performed work when they were assigned to \ndo so, a clear inference was that the sanitation policy caused the \ndetainees to work.  Id. at 919-920.  Significantly, the defendant \nin  Menocal  did  not  point  to  any  evidence  to  rebut  the  common \ninference of causation.  Id. at 921; see also Owino v. CoreCivic, \nInc., 60 F.4th 437, 446 (9th Cir. 2022) (considering sanitation \npolicy  similar  to  the  one  in  Menocal  and  finding  no  abuse  of \ndiscretion where the district court concluded โthat a factfinder \ncould reasonably draw a class-wide causation inferenceโ from the \nuniform policy).  In contrast, here, Plaintiffs did not demonstrate \nthat the work program policies are uniformly coercive, such that \nno reasonable detainee would join or remain in the Stewart work \nprogram  voluntarily,  absent  the  potential  for  serious  harm  or \nphysical restraint.5  Thus, this is not a case like Menocal or \n \n5 To rescue their motion for class certification, Plaintiffs may argue \nthat they are willing to assume the burden of proving at trial that the \n12 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 13 of 18\n \nOwino where there is no other reasonable explanation for the labor \nother than coercion.  For these reasons, the claims asserted in \nthis action are best suited for individual and not class treatment.  \nThe Court denies the motion for class certification. \nTHE OTHER PENDING MOTIONS \nI.  Plaintiffsโ Motion for Spoliation Sanctions \nIn addition to their class certification motion, Plaintiffs \nfiled  a  motion  for  spoliation  sanctions  because  a  CoreCivic \nemployee  destroyed  the  detention  files  of  Urbina  Rojas  and  an \nunknown  number  of  other  putative  class  members,  even  though \nCoreCivic understood that it had an obligation to preserve such \ndocuments.  As a sanction, Plaintiffs seek an adverse inference \njury instruction requiring the jury to presume that Urbina Rojasโs \ntestimony about his experience at Stewart is uncontroverted, plus \nattorneysโ fees associated with the sanctions motion. \nSpoliation  is  โthe  destruction  or  failure  to  preserve \nevidence that is necessary to contemplated or pending litigation.โ \nBath v. Intโl Paper Co., 807 S.E.2d 64, 68 (Ga. Ct. App. 2017) \n(quoting Baxley v. Hakiel Indus., Inc., 647 S.E.2d 29, 30 (Ga. \n2007)).  In this circuit, โfederal law governs the imposition of \n \nconditions of confinement and the conditions of continued participation \nare so coercive that no reasonable detainee could resist the coercion.  \nBut  Plaintiffs  did  not  rebut  the  evidence  that  through  the  years \napproximately 80% of the detainees have chosen not to participate in the \nprogram.  This evidence contradicts the assertion that no reasonable \ndetainee could resist the coercion caused by conditions of confinement \nat Stewart. \n13 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 14 of 18\n \nspoliation sanctions,โ although Georgia law provides guidance that \nthe Court may consider. Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp., 427 F.3d \n939, 944 (11th Cir. 2005).  Spoliation sanctions โare intended to \nprevent unfair prejudice to litigants and to insure the integrity \nof the discovery process.โ  Id.  The Court has โbroad discretionโ \nto impose sanctions for spoliation of evidence.  Id.  The most \nsevere sanctions, like adverse inference instructions to the jury, \nโare reserved for exceptional cases, generally only those in which \nthe party lost or destroyed material evidence intentionally in bad \nfaith and thereby prejudiced the opposing party in an uncurable \nway.โ  Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. Koch, 812 S.E.2d 256, 261 (Ga. \n2018)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted)  (quoting  Phillips  v. \nHarmon, 774 S.E.2d 596, 606 (Ga. 2015)). \nIn  determining  whether  a  sanction  is  warranted  for \nspoliation,  the  Court  may  consider  whether  Plaintiffs  were \nprejudiced  because  of  the  destruction  of  the  detention  files, \nwhether the prejudice can be cured, the practical importance of \nthe  evidence,  whether  CoreCivic  acted  in  bad  faith,  and  the \npotential for abuse if sanctions are not granted.  Flury, 427 F.3d \nat 945.  Here, CoreCivic admits that its employee deleted Urbina \nRojasโs detention file (and others) despite a litigation hold.  \nThe record suggests that CoreCivic did not take adequate measures \nto ensure that all relevant document custodians were aware of the \nlitigation hold and its requirements.  Plaintiffs contend that \n14 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 15 of 18\n \nUrbina Rojasโs detention file is central to his claim that he was \ncoerced to work in the Stewart work program because it should \ncontain evidence to corroborate his testimony that he was placed \nin segregation when he refused to do work outside of his regular \nduties.    CoreCivicโs  discipline  log  does  not  include  this \nsegregation placement.  If the discipline record were the only \nevidence of Urbina Rojasโs segregation placement, Plaintiffs might \nhave a good argument for some type of spoliation sanction.  But \nUrbina Rojas presented testimony that he was placed in segregation \nfor refusing to complete certain tasks.  It is difficult to see \nhow CoreCivicโs failure to preserve the detention file will result \nin uncurable prejudice to Urbina Rojas, which suggests that the \npractical importance of the evidence is low.  So, even if CoreCivic \ndid wrongfully fail to preserve the detention file, the Court is \nnot convinced that the sanctions Urbina Rojas seeks are warranted \nat  this  time.    The  Court  thus  declines  to  impose  spoliation \nsanctions based on the destruction of Urbina Rojasโs detention \nfile.  The Court notes that if CoreCivic tries to suggest that \nUrbina Rojas was not placed in segregation by pointing to the \ndiscipline log, then the Court would likely permit the factfinder \nto consider the fact that CoreCivic destroyed the detention file, \nwhich would have contained documentation regarding any segregation \nplacement.   \n15 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 16 of 18\n \nPlaintiffs also did not establish how they were prejudiced by \nCoreCivicโs failure to preserve the other detention files.  There \nis no contention that Plaintiffs would be able to establish the \nclass certification requirements if they had access to the files.  \nPlaintiffsโ chief concern is that CoreCivicโs motion to exclude \none of their experts rested in part on his failure to consider \nenough  detainee  grievances  and  disciplinary  reports.    But,  as \ndiscussed below, the motions to exclude the experts are moot, and \nthe Court declines to impose spoliation sanctions based on the \nfailure to preserve the other detention files. \nII.  The Partiesโ Motions to Exclude Experts \nThe  parties  also  filed  motions  to  strike  the  proposed \ntestimony of three experts under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and \nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 590 U.S. 579 (1993).   \nFirst,  CoreCivic  seeks  to  strike  Plaintiffsโ  psychiatrist \nexpert, Dr. Pablo Stewart.  The Court reviewed the portions of Dr. \nStewartโs report that Plaintiffs rely on in their motion for class \ncertification.  In those portions of his report, Dr. Stewart opines \nthat  Stewartโs  food  practices  might  coerce  some  detained \nindividuals  to  work,  that  segregation  can  cause  psychological \nharm,  and  that  the  transfer  from  worker  housing  to  non-worker \nhousing could potentially result in harm.  The Court finds that \neven if it were to admit Dr. Stewartโs opinions over CoreCivicโs \nobjections, his opinions do not demonstrate that causation can be \n16 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 17 of 18\n \nestablished on a class-wide basis using common evidence or that \ncommon  issues  predominate  over  individual  ones.    The  Court \nterminates the motion to exclude Dr. Stewart (ECF Nos. 247 & 253) \nSecond,  CoreCivic  moves  to  strike  Plaintiffsโ  economist \nexpert,  Steven  Schwartz.    Plaintiffs  rely  on  Dr.  Schwartz  to \nestablish a class-wide damages model.  Because the Court concludes \nthat the issue of causation cannot be determined on a class-wide \nbasis,  the  Court  finds  that  it  need  not  consider  whether  Dr. \nSchwartz class-wide damages model reliably measures the damages \nsuffered by the putative class members.  The Court terminates the \nmotion to exclude Dr. Schwartz (ECF Nos. 248 & 254). \nFinally, Plaintiffs move to strike CoreCivicโs psychiatric \nexpert, Dr. Joseph Penn.  The Court did not consider Dr. Pennโs \nopinion in ruling on the motion for class certification, so the \nCourt terminates the motion to exclude Dr. Penn (ECF Nos. 215 & \n239) as moot. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  set  forth  above,  the  Court  finds  that \nPlaintiffs  did  not  meet  their  burden  to  prove  that  the  class \ncertification requirements are met for the two classes they seek \nto certify.  Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiffsโ motion for \nclass certification (ECF Nos. 213 & 238).  The Court also denies \nPlaintiffsโ motion for spoliation sanctions (ECF Nos. 263 & 265).  \nThe motions to exclude experts (ECF Nos. 215, 239, 247, 248, 253, \n17 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 285   Filed 03/28/23   Page 18 of 18\n \n254) are terminated as moot.  Given the Courtโs ruling on class \ncertification, the only claims remaining in this action are the \nindividual claims of the named Plaintiffs. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED, this 28th day of March, 2023. \ns/Clay D.

CoreCivic seeks summary judgment \non Plaintiffsโ claims for (1) declaratory and injunctive relief \nand  (2)  unjust  enrichment.    Plaintiffs  concede  that  their \nindividual claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot \nbecause they are no longer in custody at Stewart.  The Court thus \ngrants CoreCivicโs partial summary judgment motion as to the claims \nfor  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief.    The  Court  denies  the \npartial summary judgment motion on the unjust enrichment claims. \nI.  Summary Judgment Standard \nSummary judgment may be granted only โif the movant shows \nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the \nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โ  Fed. R. Civ. \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 340   Filed 08/28/23   Page 2 of 5\n \nP. 56(a).  In determining whether a genuine dispute of material \nfact exists to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the evidence \nis viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary \njudgment,  drawing  all  justifiable  inferences  in  the  opposing \npartyโs favor.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 \n(1986).   A fact is material if it is relevant or necessary to the \noutcome of the suit.  Id. at 248.  A factual dispute is genuine if \nthe evidence would allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict for \nthe nonmoving party.  Id.   \nII.  Factual Background \nPlaintiffs were immigration detainees at Stewart Detention \nCenter,  which  is  operated  by  CoreCivic.    Plaintiffs  served  as \nkitchen workers in Stewartโs detainee work program, and they were \npaid between $1.00 and $4.00 per day for their work.  At least one \nof the Plaintiffs entered a written agreement to participate in \nthe program.  There are genuine fact disputes on whether Plaintiffs \nwere coerced to participate in the work program.  CoreCivic does \nnot seriously dispute that if it had not employed detainees like \nPlaintiffs to work at Stewart, it would have had to hire non-\ndetainee employees at a much higher pay rate to perform the tasks. \nIII.  Discussion \nCoreCivic argues that Plaintiffsโ unjust enrichment claims \nfail because they do not assert there was a failed contract, and \nthey do not have evidence of a contractual agreement between them \n2 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 340   Filed 08/28/23   Page 3 of 5\n \nand CoreCivic.  But they do.  CoreCivic acknowledges that at least \none Plaintiff signed a written agreement to participate in the \nprogram, that all three Plaintiffs agreed to work in the program \nfor certain benefits, that CoreCivic paid Plaintiffs the amount it \nagreed to pay them, and that Plaintiffs never reasonably expected \nto be paid more than they received.  Plaintiffs assert that they \nwere coerced to agree to participate in the work program and that \nany contract that arose between them and CoreCivic fails for that \nreason, so Plaintiffs may recover the value of the benefit they \nprovided to CoreCivic under an unjust enrichment theory.  \nGenuine  fact  disputes  exist  on  whether  CoreCivic  coerced \nPlaintiffs  to  participate  in  the  work  program.    As  the  Court \npreviously observed, the โconcept of unjust enrichment in law is \npremised upon the principle that a party cannot induce, accept, or \nencourage another to furnish or render something of value to such \nparty and avoid payment for the value received.โ Barrientos v. \nCoreCivic, Inc., 332 F. Supp. 3d 1305, 1312โ13 (M.D. Ga. 2018), \naff'd, 951 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2020) (quoting Vernon v. Assurance \nForensic Accounting, LLC, 774 S.E.2d 197, 212 (Ga. Ct. App. 2015)).  \nThe Court also previously recognized that an unjust enrichment \nclaim can arise where an agreement was formed by coercion.  Id. \n(citing Crook v. Foster, 775 S.E.2d 286, 287-90 (Ga. Ct. App. \n2015)).  For these reasons, the Court is satisfied that genuine \nfact disputes exist on Plaintiffsโ unjust enrichment claim. \n3 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 340   Filed 08/28/23   Page 4 of 5\n \nDefendants argue that even if Plaintiffs may proceed on their \nunjust enrichment claims, they may not recover the remedy they \nseek:  โdisgorgement  of  CoreCivicโs  profits  . . .  necessary  to \nremedy  the  injustice  of  CoreCivicโs  conduct.โ    Pls.โ  Resp.  to \nDef.โs Mot. Summ. J. 20, ECF No. 318.  Defendants believe that \nPlaintiffs are seeking disgorgement of CoreCivicโs profits for the \ntime when Plaintiffs were coerced to work in Stewartโs kitchen.  \nDefendantsโ summary judgment motion on this issue is granted to \nthe extent that Plaintiffs may not recover more than the reasonable \nvalue of the benefit they conferred on CoreCivic. \nAs Plaintiffs recognize, restitution is generally available \nas a remedy in unjust enrichment cases, and the remedy โtypically \ncompels the defendant to restore the benefit in question or its \ntraceable product, or else pay money in the amount necessary to \neliminate unjust enrichment.โ  AcryliCon USA, LLC v. Silikal GmbH, \n985 F.3d 1350, 1368 (11th Cir. 2021).  Disgorgement is a โspecies \nof restitutionโ that โgenerally allows a plaintiff to recover the \ndefendantโs โwrongful gain.โโ  Id.  (finding that the plaintiff \ndid not have enough evidence to prove non-speculative lost profits \ncaused by the defendantโs trade secret misappropriation).  โA party \ncannot receive and retain the benefit of anotherโs labor without \nthe duty to pay for the reasonable value of such work.โ  Watson v. \nSierra Contracting Corp., 485 S.E.2d 563, 570 (Ga. Ct. App. 1997).  \nThe value of services โmust be determined from the perspective of \n4 \n\nCase 4:18-cv-00070-CDL   Document 340   Filed 08/28/23   Page 5 of 5\n \nthe recipient to determine to what extent the party was benefited \nor enriched by such services.โ  Id.  The value of services from \nthe perspective of the recipient is a jury question.  Id.; accord \nWhite v. Arthur Enterprises, Inc., 464 S.E.2d 225 (Ga. Ct. App. \n1995)  (affirming  juryโs  unjust  enrichment  award  where  the \nplaintiff pointed to evidence of the value to the defendants of \nthe computer files the defendant stole from plaintiffs).  Thus, \nthe Court agrees that the remedy for Plaintiffsโ unjust enrichment \nclaim is not the entire profit CoreCivic made while Plaintiffs \nworked in Stewartโs kitchen; instead, it is the reasonable value \nof the benefit Plaintiffs conferred on CoreCivic. \nCONCLUSION \nAs  discussed  above,  CoreCivicโs  partial  summary  judgment \nmotion (ECF No. 304) is granted as to Plaintiffsโ individual claims \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief but denied as to their claims \nfor unjust enrichment, though the remedy shall be the reasonable \nvalue of the benefit Plaintiffs conferred on CoreCivic.  The Court \nwill handle the other pending motions in separate orders or at the \npretrial conference. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED, this 28th day of August, 2023. \ns/Clay D. Land \nCLAY D.
