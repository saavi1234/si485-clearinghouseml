    "summary": "<p>This immigration case involved the United States government&rsquo;s forcible separation of over 2,000 asylum-seeking families who arrived at the southern border without documentation.</p>\r\n<p>On February 26, 2018, an asylum seeker from the Democratic Republic of Congo (Ms. L.) filed this lawsuit and a writ for habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. The plaintiff sued the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and several other government entities and officials, all under the federal asylum statute and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Represented by the ACLU Immigrants&rsquo; Rights Project, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. Plaintiff asserted that she and her seven-year-old daughter were victims of the United States' forcible separation policy. Since their arrival on November 1, 2017, the plaintiff and her daughter had been detained. For the first 4 days upon arriving, they were detained together until the plaintiff was then sent to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in the San Diego area where she remained for nearly four months without her daughter.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff asserted violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the federal asylum statute at 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1158, which provides that all non-citizens with a well-founded fear of persecution shall have the opportunity to seek asylum, and APA violations for ICE&rsquo;s arbitrary and capricious practices and failure to consider paroling detained asylum seekers as per its own parole directive. The case was assigned to Judge Dana M. Sabraw.</p>\r\n<p>On March 2, 2018, the plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to expedite resolution of said motion. The plaintiff asked the court to enjoin the defendants from continuing to separate her from her daughter and argued that expedition was necessary to remedy the devastating harms that this separation was inflicting with each passing day. In support of this argument, the plaintiff offered testimony from nine medical experts who asserted that the trauma of forced separation from a parent imposes severe and long-lasting psychological and emotional damage on young children, especially children who are incarcerated and have already suffered the trauma of fleeing their home country.</p>\r\n<p>For reasons not apparent from the docket, on March 8, 2018, Judge Sabraw granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion to expedite. The court also required the plaintiff to provide a DNA sample to verify her maternity to her daughter. When the results of the DNA test came back on March 12, 2018, they showed a 99.99999% probability of maternity.</p>\r\n<p>On March 9, 2018, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint to modify this lawsuit into a class action and add a new named plaintiff, Ms. C. 2018 WL 3155677. That same day, the plaintiffs moved for class certification, asking that the court certify a class defined as &ldquo;[a]ll adult parents nationwide who (1) are or will be detained in immigration custody by the Department of Homeland Security, and (2) have a minor child who is or will be separated from them by DHS and detained in ORR custody, absent a demonstration in a hearing that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On March 19, 2018, the plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunction for classwide relief that would order the defendants to reunite the class members with their children and to discontinue their family separation practice. Given this motion, the court denied as moot the plaintiffs' motion for individual preliminary relief.</p>\r\n<p>On April 6, 2018, the federal government moved to dismiss the amended complaint. First, they argued that the original plaintiff&rsquo;s' claims were moot because she has been released from ICE detention and reunited with her daughter. Second, the defendants asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction over Ms. C.&rsquo;s habeas claim and that venue was improper for Ms. C.&rsquo;s other claims. Third, the defendants claimed the court lacked jurisdiction to review ICE&rsquo;s decisions to detain rather than parole the plaintiffs, to review ICE&rsquo;s decision about where to detain the plaintiffs, or to order ICE to detain them in a particular facility. Fourth, they contended that separation of the plaintiffs from their children did not violate the Fifth Amendment. Fifth, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim under both the APA and the Asylum Act.</p>\r\n<p>Partially agreeing with the defendants, Judge Sabraw granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss on June 6, 2018. 302 F.Supp.3d 1149. Specifically, the court dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims under the APA and relating to the federal asylum statute but retained the plaintiffs&rsquo; due process claim.</p>\r\n<p>The administration's practice of separating families at the border was formally abandoned on June 20, 2018, through Executive Order No. 13841. The Executive Order reestablished a policy to maintain family unity and directed that \"alien families be detained together 'during the pendency of any criminal improper entry or immigration proceedings involving their members.'\" The Executive Order did not provide any guidance on the reunification of families or future family separations.</p>\r\n<p>On June 26, 2018, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification, finding that the class was sufficiently numerous, that there were common questions of law among the class, that the plaintiffs are typical of the class as a whole, and that the plaintiffs would represent the class adequately. 331 F.R.D. 529.</p>\r\n<p>On that same day, Judge Sabraw granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a class-wide preliminary injunction, requiring much from the government to remedy the harm. 310 F.Supp.3d 1133. Specifically, the court enjoined the defendants; their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys; and all those who are in active concert or participation with them, from detaining class members in DHS custody without and apart from their minor children, absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child, unless the parent affirmatively, knowingly, and voluntarily declines to be reunited with the child in DHS custody. The court further ruled that:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If the defendants chose to release class members from DHS custody, the defendants were preliminarily enjoined from continuing to detain the minor children of the class members and had to release the minor children to the custody of their respective class members.</li>\r\n<li>The defendants must reunify all class members with their minor children who were under the age of five within fourteen days of the entry of this order and that the defendants must reunify all class members with their minor children that were age five and over within thirty days of the entry of this order.</li>\r\n<li>The defendants must take all steps necessary to facilitate regular communication between class members and their children who remained in DHS custody.</li>\r\n<li>The defendants must facilitate regular communication between and among all executive agencies responsible for the custody, detention, or shelter of class members and the custody and care of their children.</li>\r\n<li>The defendants were preliminarily enjoined from removing any class members without their child, unless the class member affirmatively, knowingly, and voluntarily declined to be reunited with the child prior to the class member&rsquo;s deportation, or there was a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.</li>\r\n<li>Finally, the court retained jurisdiction to entertain such further proceedings and to enter such further orders as may be necessary or appropriate to implement and enforce the provisions of this order and preliminary injunction. 310 F.Supp.3d 1133.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>On July 3, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint claiming that the government had separated thousands of migrant families over the past year without a legitimate purpose. 2018 WL 3575383. It forwarded the idea that the government's true purpose in separating these families was to deter future families from seeking refuge (i.e., asylum) in the United States. It referenced Attorney General Jeff Session's May 2018 announcement of &ldquo;a new initiative&rdquo; to refer &ldquo;100 percent&rdquo; of immigrants who cross the Southwest border for criminal immigration prosecutions, also known as the &ldquo;zero-tolerance policy,\" by which all parents who were prosecuted would be separated from their children. The complaint asserted that the true purpose of this new policy was to separate families in the hope that it would deter other families from seeking refuge in the United States. It also referenced President Trump's Executive Order (EO) of June 20, 2018, which purported to end the practice of family separation but allowed DHS to separate families for \"the child's welfare\" without setting forth how that standard would be applied. The complaint highlighted that this EO made no provision for reunifying families separated prior to its issuance or for returning children to parents who had already been deported.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs moved for a stay of removal and a temporary restraining order (TRO) on July 16, 2018. 2018 WL 3575386. The plaintiffs requested that the court order the government not to remove parents until one week after they have been reunited with their children given rumors that the government was planning mass deportations to be carried out imminently and immediately upon reunification. The plaintiffs claimed that class members were at imminent risk of deportation without being advised of their rights under the injunction or the effect of waiving their children's rights against prolonged detention under the Flores settlement.</p>\r\n<p>That same day, constitutional law scholars including Dean Erwin Chemerinsky of Berkeley Law filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs' arguments regarding the district court's authority to grant the TRO. The scholars asserted that the Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution forbids the government from delaying reunification of class members and their children until the eve of physical removal from the country; they said that this was because doing so would deny the plaintiffs and their families an effective means to fairly consider and present valid grounds for asylum and other relief from deportation.</p>\r\n<p>In opposition to the TRO, the government argued that the district court lacked the authority from staying the deportation of class members who had final orders of expedited removal (because in the procedural posture of their individual immigration cases, many had not passed an asylum screening and so did not have the right under federal law to present their asylum claims before an immigration judge).</p>\r\n<p>The parties filed a joint status report on July 19, 2018, in which the government stated that they had identified 2551 separated children from age 5 to 17 but that only 848 had been interviewed and cleared for reunification. 2018 WL 3575388. Many of these families were united but kept detained, mostly at two private family detention facilities in Texas. The plaintiffs noted that the government had failed to provide them a list of class members who had been released from ICE custody, a list of those who had been deported, as well as a list of parents with final removal orders, who needed to be counseled on their options and their children's options immediately.</p>\r\n<p>The next week in July 2018, Judge Sabraw ordered the government to provide the plaintiffs with a list of all class members who had been deported and of all who had been released into the interior of the country. The court also ordered the plaintiffs and the government to produce a written plan for reuniting parents who had been deported but whose children remained in the United States; the court later ordered each to appoint people to implement those plans. On August 3, 2018, the court ordered the government to provide information regarding class members who the defendants found ineligible for reunification with their children because of alleged criminal histories.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Sabraw issued an order clarifying the scope of the injunction on August 16, 2018. The court ordered that the injunctive relief did not limit DHS's authority to detain adults in its custody and that reunification did not give a parent a right to release if their detention was lawful. It further ordered that if DHS was trying to reunify a detained adult in its custody with their child, the parent could either (i) waive the child's rights under the Flores settlement so that the family could be detained together in DHS custody or (ii) waive his or her right not to be separated from his or her child under this court's injunction and allow the child to be detained in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and treated as an unaccompanied minor.</p>\r\n<p>That same day, the government informed the court of a \"disturbance\" at the ICE family detention center in Karnes County, Texas, between adult male class members who were being held there with their children. They said that the whole group of men were separated from their children again overnight but would be returned to Karnes.</p>\r\n<p>The TRO was denied as moot after Judge Sabraw granted a TRO for the plaintiffs in M.M.M et al v. Sessions (3:18-cv-01832-DMS-MDD, ECF No. 55), a family separation lawsuit filed by private counsel on August 3, 2018. The plaintiffs in M.M.M. are the children of class member parents in this case and the complaint raised issues surrounding the asylum process for families that had been separated at the border. The TRO granted for M.M.M. on August 16, 2018, stayed the deportation orders of Ms. L. class member parents pending the resolution of their children's asylum claims, in order to maintain family unity. In that order, Judge Sabraw ordered the parties in both cases to meet and confer with the government and to propose a solution.</p>\r\n<p>On August 23, 2018, the parties filed a new joint status report. 2018 WL 4144367. The government reported that they had identified 2,654 separated children ages 0-5 of which 1,923 had been reunited with a separated parent and 203 had been discharged to a sponsor (i.e., another family member or adult friend of the family) or had turned 18. 528 separated children remained in ORR custody; parents of 343 children of that group had been deported. The plaintiffs had received information from the government of 412 parents who had been deported. 231 parents had been reached by the plaintiffs and NGOs but 140 had not; of that group, neither party had a phone number for 41 parents and the phone numbers of 38 parents were inoperable or ineffective. The plaintiffs noted that they were investigating reports from deported parents who appeared to have been coerced or misled by U.S. government actions that deprived them of their right to seek asylum. These incidents include parents who were told that they needed to accept removal and not pursue asylum in order to be reunited with their children, and parents who were required to sign documents they did not understand, in languages they do not speak, that had the effect of waiving their right to seek asylum.</p>\r\n<p>The government appealed the court's order granting class certification to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 2018 (see 18-56151). Those proceedings were stayed in November 2018 before the parties had briefed the issues.</p>\r\n<p>On August 30, 2018, the parties filed another joint status report in which the plaintiffs identified discrepancies between lists it provided of parents and children. They also flagged that they had learned of separated children through legal service providers and NGOs who did not appear on government lists.</p>\r\n<p>The parties continued to file approximately weekly joint reports in September and October 2018 and less frequent reports in November 2018. As of September 23, 2018, 1,977 children had been reunited with their parents. Over 100 deported parents had not been reached in spite of significant NGO support.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on October 9, 2018. It added two named plaintiffs who were separated from their children at the time of the credible fear interviews (i.e., asylum screening) and who had received a negative determination. One of the women's negative determination had been affirmed by an immigration judge such that she had exhausted all administrative remedies and could be deported at any time. This complaint also added a right to family integrity under the Due Process Clause and asserted more robust violations under the federal asylum statute.</p>\r\n<p>That same day, Judge Sabraw granted the parties' motion for preliminary approval of a settlement agreement, approving classes in this case and in M.M.M. for the purposes of settlement only. A key component of that agreement allowed parents to have a new credible fear screening in \"good faith\" to determine whether a positive determination is warranted; with a positive determination, an asylum seeker may submit an asylum application and present their claim before an immigration judge. This was important because many parents had received negative determinations due in part to the trauma they were experiencing while separated from their children.</p>\r\n<p>On October 16, 2018, Judge Sabraw granted the plaintiffs' motion to require immediate implementation of the settlement agreement. This required the government to allow 60+ class members in detention who had elected to take advantage of the asylum procedures set out in the settlement agreement but who the government had refused to orient until final approval of the settlement. The court noted that it was the government's statutory obligation to allow people asserting a fear of persecution access to an asylum screening.</p>\r\n<p>The government informed the court on October 25, 2018 that it had released a total of 2,404 children and was working towards release of an additional 47.</p>\r\n<p>Together and Free, a grassroots organization that provides assistance to separated families, filed a notice of objection on November 6, 2018 to the fairness and adequacy of the proposed settlement agreement. It noted that many families which were treated as reunified were not in fact, as many parents remained in ICE custody while their children had been released to friends or extended family members. It also highlighted that deported family members did not receive adequate relief, as the settlement only would allow a reopening of their cases and a new asylum screening in \"rare and unusual\" instances.</p>\r\n<p>The court certified the settlement classes and granted final approval of the class action settlement on November 15, 2018, in response to the plaintiffs' motion filed the week prior. 2018 WL 7075890. Separate counsel were appointed for each of three groups: nonprofit organizations for members of the parent class who remained physically present in the United States, the ACLU for members of the parent class who had been physically removed from the United States, and private counsel for the child class. It provides that class members with expedited removal orders are entitled to a sua sponte review of their negative credible fear determinations and the opportunity to present additional evidence to an asylum officer.</p>\r\n<p>On December 14, 2018, the ACLU requested that the court clarify that the scope of the Ms. L class included parents whose children were separated from them before June 26, 2018, which was the date when the court granted the preliminary injunction. The government filed their opposition to this motion on February 6, 2019 (the deadline was extended because of a government shutdown), arguing that this backward-looking definition conflicted with the forward-looking language of the settlement. 2019 WL 927180. The court granted this motion on March 8, 2019, and modified the class definition to include parents who entered on or before June 1, 2017; the court noted that there was no dispute that they were subjected to the same family separation policies as the parents who indisputably fit into the scope of the class. 330 F.R.D. 284.</p>\r\n<p>On February 8, 2019, the court issued an order further clarifying the settlement agreement. It states that where a child was issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) in immigration court but a parent had not because they had received a negative CFI determination, the parent's case would be reviewed again so that both parent and child were deported or both placed in immigration court proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>On February 22, 2019, the court issued an order on the plaintiffs' motion to enforce the settlement agreement for class members who had not submitted executed waiver forms, after the plaintiffs filed their reply in support of this motion on February 13. 2019 WL 259140. Judge Sabraw did not outright grant the motion but ordered the government to provide plaintiffs' counsel with a list of names of people subject to removal for failure to execute these forms. The court also required that the government advise ICE to not remove class members until they were advised of their rights under the settlement agreement and an opportunity to execute the relevant forms.</p>\r\n<p>On April 5, 2019, the government filed a proposed plan to identify additional Ms. L. class members through statistical analysis of ORR records of 47,000 children who were released from its custody on or after June 1, 2017. From there, the government said they would manually review the case records of children who appeared to have the highest probability of having been separated, a process that they estimate will take 2 years to complete.</p>\r\n<p>Following a status conference and review of the parties' status report, Judge Sabraw issued an order on April 25, 2019, approving the government's plan to identify additional class members and mandating that the plan be completed within six months. 2019 WL 1868487.</p>\r\n<p>On June 6, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion to allow 21 parents deported without their children to travel to the U.S. to obtain an opportunity to reunite with their children. The parents are part of a group of 51 parents deported without their children that the plaintiffs identified as being deprived of an opportunity to apply for asylum, currently in danger, and possessing bonafide asylum claims. The government rejected all 51 applications without any individualized explanations. However, 30 of these parents managed to make it to the U.S.-Mexico border and all of them passed their credible fear interviews or were placed directly into immigration proceedings before an immigration judge, and were subsequently reunified with their children. The plaintiffs asserted that the remaining 21 parents are no different than those 30 and sought a remedy, appropriate under the Settlement Agreement and Ninth Circuit law, to provide a pathway to legal travel to the U.S. where they would \"almost certainly\" pass their credible fear interviews and reunite with their children.</p>\r\n<p>On July 30, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the preliminary injunction and request that the court clarify the standard for ongoing separations. The plaintiffs asserted that from June 2018 to June 2019 the defendants separated more than 900 children based on criminal history of the parents, no matter how insignificant the crime, and a unilateral determination that the parent is unfit or dangerous. The plaintiffs requested that the court set guidelines and work with the parties to create a process for resolving disputes about separations. The defendants argued that their practices were no different than the practices of other administrations and that the number of separations was a small fraction of individuals entering the border during that time, reflecting a careful exercise of discretion consistent with the court's order.</p>\r\n<p>On September 4, 2019, Judge Sabraw issued an order granting in part and denying in part plaintiffs' motion to allow parents deported without their children to travel to the United States. After initially requesting relief for 21 parents, the plaintiffs reduced the request to 18 parents. The court found that 11 of the parents were entitled to the requested relief and 7 were not, as these parents failed to prove that they were wrongfully removed. 403 F.Supp.3d 853.</p>\r\n<p>After holding a status conference with the parties, Judge Sabraw issued an order on September 20, 2019, mandating that defendants \"produce all governing documents memorializing standardized procedures, guidelines and guidance for separating parents and children at the border.\"</p>\r\n<p>The government informed the court on October 16, 2019, that it had released 2,788 children out of 2,814 possible children of potential class members for the original class period and identified 1,290 children of potential expanded class members.</p>\r\n<p>On January 13, 2020, Judge Sabraw issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion to enforce a preliminary injunction. Judge Sabraw, considering the defendants' implementation of guidelines and additional practices, its authority to secure the borders, and the scope of the class and need to avoid individualized determinations, found that defendants were exercising discretion consistent with the court's orders and plaintiffs' right to family integrity. Accordingly, Judge Sabraw concluded that there was no need for the court to intervene to further enforce the preliminary injunction. However, Judge Sabraw did find that the defendants were not acting consistently with the court's order with regard to DNA testing and requested clarification regarding separations based on family residential center standards. 415 F.Supp.3d 980.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed an unopposed motion to voluntarily dismiss the appeal in the Ninth Circuit on February 26, 2020. The appeal had been stayed since November 2018 and no briefs had been filed by either party. On March 9, 2020, the Ninth Circuit granted the defendants motion and dismissed the appeal.</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, 2021 the parties issued a joint Status Report after the court ordered the parties to inform the Court of how President Biden&rsquo;s February 2, 2021 &ldquo;Executive Order on the Establishment of the Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families&rdquo; affected the litigation. The parties agreed to enter into settlement negotiations and agreed that the Task Force would work in conjunction with the settlement negotiations to address the issues from litigation. The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Mitchell Dembin for settlement discussions. The government agreed to begin reunifying families during settlement negotiations to the extent possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties met for a preliminary settlement conference on March 17, 2021 and proceeded to meet over the course of the following two years and provided periodic status reports on the progress of reunification of families. On June 10, 2021, the parties filed a stipulated motion asking that the Court order the government to facilitate the reunification of families by considering for parole certain individuals who the parties agreed were eligible for relief, and returning those individuals for whom parole was granted to the United States at government expense. The Court entered the requested order on January 28, 2022. The parties filed a similar motion for consideration of parole of certain class members present in the United States, and the order was granted on January 31, 2022. The parties also filed a joint motion on April 29, 2022, which the Court granted on May 2, 2022, ordering the government to provide behavioral health services to the plaintiffs and their children during the ongoing settlement discussions.</p>\r\n<p>On April 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a limited modification of the Class, which would include parents separated from their children who were US citizens, and the child was therefore not taken into DHS custody. The Court granted the modification on April 19, 2023, and the Class was modified to &ldquo;All adult parents who enter the United States at or between designated ports of entry on or after July 1, 2017, who (1) have been, are, or will be detained in immigration custody by the DHS, and (2) have a minor child who is or will be separated from them by DHS and detained in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody, or where the separated child is a U.S. citizen and therefore was not sent to ORR custody, absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On May 1, 2023, the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Allison H. Goddard for further settlement proceedings. On October 16, 2023, the parties filed a joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement, which the Court granted on October 24, 2023. A fairness hearing was scheduled for December 8, 2023. On December 1, 2023 the parties filed a joint motion for final approval of the settlement agreement, which was granted on December 11, 2023. The Court dismissed the Plaintiff&rsquo;s claims with prejudice except that the Court retained jurisdiction for specified purposes subject to the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement was estimated to cover 4,500 - 5,000 children and their parents. Under the agreement, the government agreed to continue to identify families that were separated, fund family reunification in the US, provide support services for class members inside the US, and provide pathways to seek asylum. The government also agreed not to enact the zero-tolerance policy moving forward.</p>\r\n<p>Following settlement of the case, the Plaintiffs filed motions for attorney's fees. On September 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval for the proposed fees, totaling over $6 million for the Ms. L Plaintiffs and over $300,000 for the Dora Plaintiffs. On October 31, 2024, Plaintiffs requested final approval of the settlement after a period for class member objections had pass with no objections filed. The court granted final approval of the attorney's fees on November 5, 2024.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the second Trump administration, the case entered a new phase when, on April 23, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the settlement, arguing that the Department of Justice's planned termination of a contract that provided legal services to class members abrogated its obligation to provide legal services under the settlement. Because the contract had not yet expired, the Court found there was no breach and denied the motion without prejudice. Following a meet-and-confer, plaintiffs renewed their motion to enforce on May 12; the court found for the plaintiffs on June 10. 787 F.Supp.3d 1110.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the court found violations of provisions of the settlement that required the government to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>provide and &ldquo;adequately resource[ ] and fund[,]&rdquo; a variety of legal services to Class members, including among other things, counseling about relief to which Class members may be entitled, steps necessary to pursue such relief, and preparation for any interview with USCIS.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>identify cases for pro bono placement through in depth individualized consultations with Class members, and then help match potential pro bono representatives with reunified families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>contract with an independent contractor to communicate with Class members and assist them and their families with necessary parole and employment authorization applications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The court ordered the government to reinstate the legal services contract.</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2025, Defendants sought temporary relief from the Court&rsquo;s December 11, 2023 order, asking to suspend Settlement Agreement provisions related to behavioral health, medical services, and outreach until a new contractor was found. On June 30, 2025, Plaintiffs filed orders seeking to enforce settlement agreement provisions regarding (i) the independent adjudicator and travel-related assistance and (ii) behavioral health, medical services, and outreach. On July 3, 2025, Defendants requested relief from the June 10, 2025 order requiring them to reinstate the Acacia Task Order, citing changed circumstances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 18, 2025, the Court ordered Defendants to pay all outstanding amounts to the Independent Adjudicator, fund IOM for reunification of the three families by July 25, 2025, and make future payments as previously required. On July 24, 2025, the Court denied Defendants&rsquo; motions, granted Plaintiffs&rsquo; enforcement motion, and ordered Defendants to contract with Acacia and Seneca by August 25, 2025, to provide required services for at least one year or until a qualified provider is secured. 2025 WL 2590329.</p>\r\n<p>Separately, on June 27, 2025, the court ordered the Government to continue to notify Plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel within 24 hours of detaining any Ms. L. Class member or QAFM and to halt removals pending resolution of the Rule 60(b) motion. On August 4, 2025, the court reiterated the notification requirement, stayed removals during the Acacia task order reissuance, required ICE custody and reporting lists within 10 days, and suspended enforcement actions against pending applicants until class membership is determined. On August 26, 2025, Defendants appealed the June 27, 2025 Order and the August 4, 2025 Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 2, 2025, Defendants filed a motion in district court seeking partial relief under Rule 60(b), arguing that compliance with Section IV.C.1 of the Settlement Agreement is no longer possible due to conflicting requirements imposed by the newly enacted \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\"</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case, filed in 2018 in the Southern District of California by an asylum seeker from the Democratic Republic of Congo (Ms. L.), challenged the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border. Represented by the ACLU, Ms. L. and her seven-year-old daughter, who were separated and detained for months, alleged violations of the Due Process Clause, the federal asylum statute, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing that the government’s practices were arbitrary and caused severe trauma to children.\r\n\r\nThe case was assigned to Judge Dana M. Sabraw. On March 9, 2018, the lawsuit expanded into a nationwide class action for all detained parents separated from their children, absent evidence the parent was unfit or a danger. Plaintiffs sought to end family separation and compel reunification. Government defendants unsuccessfully argued the court lacked jurisdiction and that separation did not violate Fifth Amendment due process.\r\n\r\nOn June 26, 2018, after class certification, the court issued a classwide preliminary injunction requiring the government to cease family separations (absent a showing of parental unfitness), reunify families within specified timeframes, and facilitate communication. The government ended formal family separations by executive order but lacked a plan for reunification. The case subsequently led to an agreement for new credible fear asylum screenings for separated families and required the government to identify, locate, and compensate all separated parents and children.\r\n\r\nOver months and years, thousands of children were identified as affected, with the government ordered to track, reunify, and provide support services. The litigation addressed further challenges, such as government failure to provide information about affected families, legal obstacles for deported parents, and continuing cases of family separation based on factors like alleged parental criminal history. New legal claims were added, and further injunctive relief and settlements expanded class eligibility and obligations for reunification, support, and legal access.\r\n\r\nFollowing settlement discussions after President Biden’s 2021 executive order, the parties reached a wider settlement approved in December 2023, covering roughly 4,500–5,000 children and parents. Under the agreement, the government agreed to ongoing family reunification efforts, support services, and a ban on re-implementing “zero-tolerance” family separation policies. The court approved substantial attorney’s fees and retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement.\r\n\r\nIn 2025, under a new administration, the case re-entered active litigation when plaintiffs successfully moved to enforce the settlement after DOJ’s attempted termination of a legal services contract for class members. Additional litigation arose over indemnification of behavioral health, medical, and outreach services, payments to adjudicators, and the government’s compliance with reporting and notice requirements, with the court generally siding with plaintiffs and ordering continued services, reinstatement of contracts, and government notification of detentions. Ongoing appeals and additional motions ensued as the government argued it could not fully comply due to new laws.\r\n\r\nThis landmark case remains active, continuing to oversee federal compliance with the reunification, support, and due process rights of separated families.",

Lee Gelernt and Daniel Galindo appeared for Plaintiffs, and Daniel Schutrum-\n28  Boward and Cara Alsterberg appeared for Defendants.  After full consideration of the \n1 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11868     Page\n2 of 13\n \n1  parties’ arguments, the record, and the relevant case law, and for the reasons set out below, \n2  the Court denies Defendants’ motion for temporary relief from the Court’s Order requiring \n3  reinstatement of the Acacia Task Order, denies Defendants’ motion for temporary relief \n4  from  Court  order,  and  grants  Plaintiffs’  motion  to  enforce  the  settlement  agreement \n5  regarding the provision of services. \n6  I. \n7  BACKGROUND \n8    On June 10, 2025, this Court found Defendants in breach of the parties’ Settlement \n9  Agreement in this case, specifically, the sections regarding the provision of legal services \n10  to Class Members.  (See ECF No. 795.)  To remedy that breach, the Court ordered \n11  Defendants to reinstate their Legal Access Services for Reunified Families (“LASRF”) task \n12  order  with  Acacia  so  it  could  provide  the  necessary  legal  services,  and  set  a  status \n13  conference for June 27, 2025.  (Id. at 17-19.)   \n14    Defendants did not comply with the Court’s order to reinstate the task order with \n15  Acacia.  Instead, in the parties’ Joint Status Report filed on June 25, 2025, Defendants \n16  informed the Court they would be filing a motion for relief from the order pursuant to \n17  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).  (ECF No. 800 at 2-3.)  Defendants stated that if the \n18  Court granted that motion, the Government would “solicit a Request for Information, to \n19  include a Statement of Work, that [would] allow it to collect written information about the \n20  capabilities of vendors in the marketplace to offer immigration legal services, followed by \n21  a Request for Quote.”  (Id. at 2.)   \n22    Following the June 27, 2025 status conference, the Court issued an order directing \n23  Defendants to provide Acacia with a term sheet concerning renewal or reissue of the \n24  LASRF task order on or before July 1, 2025, at 5:00 p.m.  On that date, defense counsel \n25  sent an email to Sara Van Hofwegen, the Managing Director at Acacia Center for Justice, \n26  attaching a “nonbinding” term sheet, informing Ms. Van Hofwegen that “the Government \n27  intends to seek relief from the Court’s requirement that it reinstate any Task Order with \n28  Acacia” and that it “would like to pursue potential engagement with alternative vendors to \n2 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11869     Page\n3 of 13\n \n1  provide the legal services required under” the Settlement Agreement.  (Fifth Supp. Decl. \n2  of Sara Van Hofwegen in Supp. of Opp’n to Rule 60(b) Mot. Regarding the Provision of \n3  Legal Services (“Van Hofwegen Decl.”), Ex. A, ECF No. 818-1.)  Ms. Van Hofwegen \n4  informed defense counsel that Acacia could not “engage in any substantive conversation \n5  with DOJ’s trial counsel or take any action with respect to the proposed term sheet trial \n6  counsel provided without receiving communication from [Acacia’s] Contracting Officer.”  \n7  (Van Hofwegen Decl. ¶ 14.)  Acacia did not receive a response from defense counsel and \n8  had not received a response from Acacia’s Contracting Officer as of the filing of Ms. Van \n9  Hofwegen’s Declaration on July 11, 2025.  (Id. ¶¶ 14, 16.)   \n10    While the parties and the Court were dealing with the issue of the legal services \n11  provisions of the Settlement Agreement, and just a few hours before the Court issued its \n12  June 10, 2025 Order finding Defendants in breach of those provisions, another issue arose \n13  with  the  Settlement  Agreement.    That  issue  concerned  the  Settlement  Agreement’s \n14  requirements that Defendants provide Class Members with behavioral health services, \n15  assistance with certain medical costs, and housing support.  Until June 9, 2025, the United \n16  States Department of Health and Human Services, which is a named Defendant in this case \n17  and a party to the Settlement Agreement, had a contract with Seneca Family of Agencies \n18  to provide those services.  As with the Government’s contract with Acacia, however, the \n19  Government decided not to exercise its option to renew its contract with Seneca and instead \n20  allowed that contract to lapse.  In light of that decision, Defendants filed a separate Motion \n21  for  Temporary  Relief  from  Court  Order  Pursuant  to  Rule 60(b)  asking  the  Court  to \n22  “temporarily suspend” those sections of the Settlement Agreement requiring Defendants \n23  to provide these additional services to Class Members.  Plaintiffs then filed their own \n24  motion to enforce those Settlement Agreement provisions.   \n25  II. \n26  DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS \n27    Both  of  Defendants’  motions  are  brought  pursuant  to  Federal  Rules  of  Civil \n28  Procedure 60(b)(5) and 60(b)(6).  Under Rule 60(b)(5), a court may relieve a party from a \n3 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11870     Page\n4 of 13\n \n1  final judgment, order, or proceeding if “the judgment has been satisfied, released, or \n2  discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying \n3  it prospectively is no longer equitable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5).  Under Rule 60(b)(6), \n4  relief is available for “any other reason.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).   \n5    Here, Defendants rely on the final clause of Rule 60(b)(5), which provides for relief \n6  if applying the judgment or order “prospectively is no longer equitable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n7  60(b)(5).  This Rule “may not be used to challenge the legal conclusions on which a prior \n8  judgment or order rests, but the Rule provides a means by which a party can ask a court to \n9  modify or vacate a judgment or order if ‘a significant change either in factual conditions \n10  or in law’ renders continued enforcement ‘detrimental to the public interest.’”  Horne v. \n11  Flores, 557 U.S. 443, 447 (2009) (quoting Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. \n12  367, 384 (1992)).  “Once a moving party has met its burden of establishing either a change \n13  in  fact or law warranting modification  of  a  consent decree, the  district  court  should \n14  determine  whether  the  proposed  modification  is  suitably  tailored  to  the  changed \n15  circumstance.”  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391.   \n16    Rule 60(b)(6) “is a catchall that … covers ‘any other reason’ that justifies relief; that \n17  is, Rule 60(b)(6) provides only grounds for relief not already covered by the preceding five \n18  paragraphs.”  BLOM Bank SOL v. Honickman, 605 U.S. ___, 145 S.Ct. 1612, 1619 (2025).  \n19  The Supreme Court has “consistently reaffirmed that Rule 60(b)(6) ‘should only be applied \n20  in  extraordinary  circumstances.’”    Id.  at  1620  (quoting  Liljeberg  v.  Health  Services \n21  Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 864 (1988)).  “’This very strict interpretation of Rule \n22  60(b) is essential if the finality of judgments is to be preserved.’”  Id. (quoting Gonzalez v. \n23  Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 535 (2005)).   \n24  A.  Motion for Temporary Relief from Court Order Requiring Reinstatement of \nAcacia Task  Order \n25 \n \n26  The Court turns first to Defendants’ motion for relief from the Court’s June 10, 2025 \n27  Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement Regarding \n28  Provision of Legal Services, which required Defendants to reinstate their task order with \n4 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11871     Page\n5 of 13\n \n1  Acacia.  (See ECF No. 795.)  Defendants argue they are entitled to relief from this Order \n2  under Rule 60(b)(5) because of two significant changes in factual conditions.   \n3  The first significant change, according to Defendants, is “an unfavorable cost-to-\n4  output ratio at the taxpayer’s expense.”  (Mot. at 4, ECF No. 809.)  According to Sirce \n5  Owen,  the  Acting  Director  of  the  Executive  Office  for  Immigration  Review,  Acacia \n6  charged  the  Government  $4,605,843.86  under  the  previous  task  order  in  program \n7  management support costs, direct costs, and legal services.  (Decl. of Sirce Owen ¶¶3-4, \n8  ECF No. 809-1.)  That amount averages out to approximately $3,841 per individual served \n9  by the task order.  (See id. ¶ 4) (stating 1,199 Class Members and QAFMs received \n10  assistance under the task order).  Notably, Ms. Owen does not state this cost-to-output ratio \n11  was “unfavorable.”  Indeed, there is no evidence in the record to that effect.   \n12  On the contrary, the evidence reflects the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) negotiated \n13  and agreed with Acacia on the pricing structure for the task order.  (Van Hofwegen Decl. \n14  ¶¶ 5-9.)  During those negotiations, the DOJ decided to use a “firm fixed price” model, and \n15  the parties negotiated a set price for the services to be provided.  (Id. ¶ 6-7.)  Under the \n16  terms of the contract, the DOJ agreed to pay Acacia a flat fee to provide legal services to a \n17  base number of participants (785), and a flat rate for each additional participant above that \n18  number.  (Id. ¶ 7.)  Pursuant to the terms of the contract, Acacia notified the Government \n19  when it reached certain benchmarks, (id. ¶ 8), and on January 13, 2025 (one week before \n20  the change in presidential administration), it also gave the Government an estimate of when \n21  it would reach the baseline number and how many additional participants it expected to \n22  serve.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  At no time during the term of the contract did any government official \n23  express concerns about those additional anticipated costs.  (Id.)  Despite Defendants’ \n24  argument, they have failed to provide any evidence of a significant change in factual \n25  conditions such that applying the Court’s June 10, 2025 Order “is no longer equitable.”   \n26  Defendants also argue “the recent change in administration and implementation of \n27  new policy directives” constitutes a “significant change” such that application of the \n28  Court’s June 10, 2025 Order “is no longer equitable.”  (Reply at 1, ECF No. 823.)  Notably, \n5 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11872     Page\n6 of 13\n \n1  Defendants fail to cite any authority to support this argument, and at least one other court \n2  has rejected it.  See Center for Biological Diversity v. Environmental Protection Agency, \n3  No. 11-cv-00293-JCS, 2025 WL 901944 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2025).  In that case, the \n4  Government  requested  to  modify  a  stipulated  settlement  agreement to  extend  certain \n5  deadlines contained therein.  Id. at *1.  One of the bases for that request was a change in \n6  presidential administration.  Id. at *6.  There, like here, the court noted the Government \n7  failed  to  cite  “any  authority  that  suggests  that  a  change  in  administration,  by  itself, \n8  constitutes good cause or offers an equitable reason sufficient to justify modifying the \n9  terms of a settlement agreement under Rule 60(b)(5).”  Id. at *8.  The court reasoned that \n10  if courts were:  \n11  to adopt such an approach, it would mean, essentially, that parties could not \nenter into settlement agreements or consent decrees with an agency of the \n12 \nUnited States that spanned more than one administration as they could not \n13  count on adherence to the terms of the settlement agreement by subsequent \nadministrations.   \n14 \n \n15  Id.  According to the court, that would run counter the Government’s “long history of \n16  entering into consent decrees that bind future administrations, and of abiding by those \n17  agreements.”  Id.  That reasoning applies squarely here, and leads this Court to the same \n18  conclusion, namely that a change in presidential administration does not constitute the sort \n19  of “significant change” in either fact or law sufficient to show that prospective application \n20  of a court order “is no longer equitable.” \n21    Failing relief under Rule 60(b)(5), Defendants argue they are entitled to relief under \n22  Rule 60(b)(6) because “potentially uneconomical spending of public funds is unjust and \n23  should not be required.”  (Mot. at 5, ECF No. 809.)  This is a different shade of Defendants’ \n24  “cost-to-output ratio” argument raised above under Rule 60(b)(5), and thus it cannot serve \n25  as the basis for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See BLOM Bank SAL, 145 S.Ct. at 1619 (stating \n26  “Rule 60(b)(6) provides only grounds for relief not already covered by the preceding five \n27  paragraphs.”)   \n28  / / / \n6 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11873     Page\n7 of 13\n \n1    Defendants also argue they are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(6) because “[i]f \n2  the judicial process were to require the Government to use a specific vendor instead of \n3  allowing it to participate in an open competitive process, the public’s confidence [in the \n4  judicial process] may be comprised.”  (Mot. at 5, ECF No. 809.)  But this argument is a red \n5  herring.  Contrary to Defendants’ argument, there is nothing in the Court’s June 10, 2025 \n6  order that prohibits Defendants from participating in “an open competitive process” to find \n7  a contractor to fulfill Defendants’ obligations under the legal services provisions of the \n8  Settlement Agreement.  Defendants are, and have been, free to engage in that process.  On \n9  that point there is no dispute.  What Defendants are not free to do, however, is ignore their \n10  obligations to provide the legal services promised in the Settlement Agreement.   \n11  The Court’s order directing Defendants to reinstate their task order with Acacia was \n12  the result of Defendants’ breach of those contractual obligations.  It was not an order, in \n13  the abstract, directing Defendants to contract with a specific vendor instead of using the \n14  competitive bidding process.  In that context, it is hard to see how providing a remedy for \n15  a breach of a settlement agreement would undermine the public’s confidence in the judicial \n16  process, particularly when Defendants did not propose an alternative remedy in their \n17  briefing or argument on Plaintiffs’ motion.1  On the contrary, the Court’s finding of breach \n18  and provision of a remedy for that breach should hopefully serve to affirm the public’s \n19  confidence in the judicial process as a means of upholding and enforcing contractual rights.   \n20    Because Defendants have not shown they are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(5) \n21  or 60(b)(6), their motion for temporary relief from the Court’s June 10, 2025 Order is \n22  denied. \n23 \n \n24 \n25  1    In  their  opposition  to  Plaintiffs’  motion,  Defendants  requested  an  “opportunity to \naddress” any breach “without reverted [sic] to the prior contract [with Acacia].”  (Opp’n to \n26 \nRenewed  Mot.  to  Enforce  Settlement  Agreement  at 11,  ECF  No.  774.)    This  vague \n27  suggestion does not set out an alternative remedy.  It simply would have given Defendants \ncarte blanche to remain in breach of the Settlement Agreement, which is not an acceptable \n28 \nresult.   \n7 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11874     Page\n8 of 13\n \n1  B.  Motion for Temporary Relief from Court Order \n2    Defendants’ other Rule 60(b) motion is directed to the Court’s December 11, 2023 \n3  Order Granting Final Approval of Settlement Agreement and Certifying the Settlement \n4  Classes.  (See ECF No. 727.)  In this motion, Defendants request that the Court temporarily \n5  suspend sections IV.B.2.a., IV.B.2.b., and IV.B.2.d. of the Settlement Agreement, which \n6  govern the provision of behavioral health services, assistance with certain medical costs, \n7  and housing support, respectively, while Defendants complete the re-solicitation process \n8  to find a replacement for Seneca.   \n9    In support of this motion, Defendants rely primarily on the “no longer equitable” \n10  provision of Rule 60(b)(5).  (Mot. at 6, ECF No. 792.)  Although their argument is framed \n11  in various and sundry ways, at its core it relies on Executive Order 14151, “Ending Radical \n12  and  Wasteful  Government  DEI  Programs  and  Preferencing,”  which  was  signed  by \n13  President Trump on January 20, 2025.  Exec. Order 14151, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, \n14  2025).  This EO orders department heads to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by \n15  law, … all ‘equity action plans,’ ‘equity’ actions, initiatives, or programs, ‘equity-related’ \n16  grants  or  contracts,  and  all  DEI  or  DEIA  performance  requirements  for  employees, \n17  contractors, or grantees.”  Id.   \n18  It is not at all clear that this EO would apply to the Seneca contract, but even if it \n19  did, it does not constitute a change in law sufficient to warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(5).  \n20  Although a legislative change “may justify modifying or terminating a consent decree if \n21  the new law makes complying with the consent decree ‘impermissible,’ or, … ‘make[s] \n22  legal what the decree was designed to prevent[,]’” Flores v. Rosen, 984 F.3d 720, 741 (9th \n23  Cir. 2020) (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388), the executive branch cannot “unilaterally create \n24  the change in law that it then offers as the reason it should be excused from compliance \n25  with a consent decree.”  Id.  Thus, the EO does not provide a basis for the relief Defendants \n26  seek. \n27  Defendants also argue Seneca’s alleged violation of federal civil rights laws is a \n28  change in fact sufficient to warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(5).  The Court disagrees for two \n8 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11875     Page\n9 of 13\n \n1  reasons.    First,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  referral  of  Seneca  to  the \n2  Department of Labor is not a finding that Seneca has violated any law.  It is simply a \n3  referral, and nothing more.  Second, the factual basis of the referral, namely Seneca’s \n4  website, (Mot., Ex. A, n.4), was available to Defendants before they entered into the \n5  contract with Seneca.  (See Decl. of Leticia Galyean Sturtevant ¶ 9) (stating webpage cited \n6  in referral letter has been in existence since October 2020).  This evidence reflects that \n7  Seneca’s  conduct  has  not  changed  since  the  Settlement  Agreement  was  signed  and \n8  approved.  The only thing that has changed is Defendants’ interpretation of that conduct \n9  based on the EO.  (Reply at 5) (stating motion is not based on change in interpretation of \n10  law but is based on EO).  As stated above, however, the EO is not a proper basis for relief \n11  under Rule 60(b)(5).2 \n12  Absent relief under Rule 60(b)(5), Defendants turn to Rule 60(b)(6).  Here, they \n13  argue Seneca’s “potential violation of anti-discrimination civil rights laws constitutes \n14  ‘extraordinary circumstances’ supporting temporary relief under Rule 60(b)(6).”  (Mot. at \n15  7.)  This is the same argument Defendants raised under Rule 60(b)(5), and as stated above, \n16  it cannot also be used to request relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See BLOM Bank SAL, 145 \n17  S.Ct. at 1619 (stating “Rule 60(b)(6) provides only grounds for relief not already covered \n18  by the preceding five paragraphs.”)  \n19    Because Defendants have not shown they are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(5) \n20  or 60(b)(6), their motion for temporary relief from sections IV.B.2.a., b., and d. of the \n21  Settlement Agreement is denied.   \n22 \n23   \n24 \n2  In their reply brief, Defendants also suggested that under Rule 60(b)(5), the Court should \n25  consider whether the objectives of the Settlement Agreement have been achieved.  (Reply \nat 3.)  Defendants did not raise this issue in their motion, and thus the Court need not \n26 \nconsider it here.  See Zamani v. Carnes, 491 F.3d 990, 997 (9th Cir. 2007) (stating district \n27  court “need not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.”)  Even if the \nCourt were to  consider  it,  Defendants have not  made  the  requisite  showing that  the \n28 \nobjectives of the Settlement Agreement have been satisfied. \n9 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11876     Page\n10 of 13\n \n1  III. \n2  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n3    The  only  remaining  motion  at  issue  is  Plaintiffs’  motion  to  enforce  sections \n4  IV.B.2.a., b., and d. of the Settlement Agreement.  The Court set out the legal standard for \n5  this motion in its June 10, 2025 Order, and incorporates that standard here.   \n6    On the merits, Defendants do not dispute they are in breach of these provisions.  (See \n7  Decl. of Brian Goodger ¶ 16, ECF No. 792-2) (stating Defendants “will be unable to  \n8  comply” with these sections of the Settlement Agreement while they are engaged in the re-\n9  solicitation process).  In light of that concession, the Court finds Defendants are in breach.3 \n10  The only remaining issue is the remedy.  On that issue, Plaintiffs request the Court \n11  order Defendants to take all reasonable steps to expeditiously re-contract with Seneca to \n12  provide the necessary services for at least a one-year term, or if Defendants wish to pursue \n13  re-solicitation of the contract with another provider, a point Plaintiffs do not dispute, that \n14  Seneca’s contract “continue unless and until Defendants award and are able to begin such \n15  a  new  contract  that  meets  the  terms  of  the  Settlement  Agreement[.]”    (Mot.  at  5.)  \n16  Defendants argue this relief is unnecessary because the agreement to provide behavioral \n17  health services does not expire until December 10, 2030, and the agreement to provide \n18  copayment assistance is limited to a 12-month term, therefore that assistance can also be \n19  provided before the Settlement Agreement’s expiration date.4   \n20 \n21   \n22 \n3  Defendants urge the Court not to make a finding of breach, arguing their concession is \n23  sufficient.  But a concession of breach does not have the same force or effect as a Court \norder.  Accordingly, pursuant to Plaintiffs’ request and in light of Defendants’ concession, \n24 \nthe Court finds Defendants are in breach of these provisions.   \n25  4  On the housing assistance, Defendants assert that assistance was not implemented \nthrough the Seneca contract.  (Opp’n to Mot. at 5 n.2.)  However, Ms. Sturtevant, Seneca’s \n26 \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, states that since 2020 Seneca has provided housing \n27  assistance and referrals for 855 separated families.  (Sturtevant Decl. ¶ 5.)  Because \nDefendants have not produced any evidence to rebut Ms. Sturtevant’s Declaration, the \n28 \nCourt finds the housing assistance provision is at issue here.   \n10 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11877     Page\n11 of 13\n \n1  As set out in the Court’s June 10, 2025 Order, the Settlement Agreement gives the \n2  Court “the power to award such relief and issue such judgments as the Court deems \n3  necessary for enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.”  (Settlement Agreement at 43, \n4  ECF No. 721-2.)  The relief Plaintiffs request falls within the scope of the Court’s power, \n5  and is necessary to fulfill the Settlement Agreement’s terms and objectives.  As the Court \n6  stated at the final approval hearing, the family separation policy at issue in this case was \n7  “one of the most shameful chapters in the history of our country[.]”  (ECF No. 732 at 9.)  \n8  It forced the separation of thousands of immigrant parents from their children, many of \n9  whom have yet to be reunified, and it caused profound, devastating, and lasting damage to \n10  those  families.    The  Settlement  Agreement,  which  was  the  result  of  painstaking \n11  negotiations between Plaintiffs and the Government, aimed to address that damage by \n12  providing these families with certain services at the Government’s expense, including the \n13  behavioral health services, assistance with certain medical costs, and housing assistance at \n14  issue here.  To comply with those obligations, the Government contracted with Seneca, \n15  and until June 9, 2025, the Government, through its contract with Seneca, was providing \n16  those services to Class Members.  Although the Government was certainly within its rights \n17  to not renew the Seneca contract, its decision to do so does not excuse its obligations under \n18  the Settlement Agreement.  Those obligations continue regardless, and Defendants must \n19  comply with them.   \n20  As  with  Plaintiffs’  previous  motion  to  enforce  the  Settlement  Agreement’s \n21  provisions regarding legal services, Defendants do not propose an alternative remedy for \n22  their admitted breach.  They simply request that the Court allow them to continue in breach \n23  until they have a new contractor or service provider to fill the void left by Seneca’s absence.  \n24  That is not acceptable, especially since Defendants could have started the re-solicitation \n25  process before deciding not to renew Seneca’s contract, and thereby avoided this lapse in \n26  services.  Given that some of these families may have been separated more than eight years \n27  ago, the sheer number of Class Members entitled to receive these services, the length of \n28  time  it  has  taken  and  will  take  to  deliver  these  services,  and  that  Defendants  have \n11 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11878     Page\n12 of 13\n \n1  admittedly been in breach of these provisions since June 10, 2025, Defendants must comply \n2  with their obligations now, not when they have completed the re-solicitation process.  Thus, \n3  to enforce these provisions of the Settlement Agreement, the Court orders Defendants to \n4  re-contract with Seneca to provide the services at issue here.   \n5  IV. \n6  CONCLUSION \n7    For the reasons set out above, the Court denies Defendants’ motion for temporary \n8  relief from the Court’s June 10, 2025 order requiring reinstatement of the Acacia task order.  \n9  On or before August 25, 2025, Defendants, through the appropriate contracting officer, \n10  shall negotiate and complete a new task order with Acacia to resume the provision of legal \n11  services under the Settlement Agreement.  Defendants’ motion for temporary relief from \n12  sections IV.B.2.a., b., and d. of the Settlement Agreement is also denied.  Plaintiffs’ motion \n13  to enforce the Settlement Agreement regarding the provision of services is granted.  On or \n14  before August 25, 2025, Defendants shall re-contract with Seneca to provide the services \n15  set out in sections IV.B.2.a., b., and d. of the Settlement Agreement.  That contract shall \n16  have a minimum one-year term, or shall continue unless and until Defendants award and \n17  begin a contract with a new service provider to provide these services in a manner that \n18  satisfies the terms and objectives of the Settlement Agreement.   \n19  Consistent with the Court’s prior orders, and given the Court’s “power to award such \n20  relief and issue such judgments as the Court deems necessary for enforcement of the \n21  Settlement  Agreement[,]”  (Settlement  Agreement  at  43,  ECF  No.  721-2),  the  Court \n22  continues its order requiring the Government to inform Plaintiffs’ counsel within 24 hours \n23  if it detains a member of the Ms. L. Class or other QAFMs defined in the Settlement \n24  Agreement.  The information provided to Plaintiffs’ counsel shall include, but is not limited \n25  to, the identity of the detained person, their A-file number, and place of detention.  Counsel \n26  shall also meet and confer on whether the deadlines in the Settlement Agreement should \n27  be extended in light of Defendants’ breaches and the Court’s remedies stated herein.   \n28 \n12 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11879     Page\n13 of 13\n \n1    The Court sets a status conference for August 1, 2025, at 1:30 p.m. to discuss the \n2  parties’ progress in meeting their obligations under the Settlement Agreement and the \n3  Court’s Orders.

CONFERENCE \n13  U.S Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”); et al., \n14 \nRespondents-Defendants. \n15 \n16    This case came on for status conference on August 1, 2025.  Lee Gelernt, Daniel \n17  Galindo, and Anand Balakrishnan appeared for Plaintiffs, and Daniel Schutrum-Boward \n18  and Cristina Parascandola appeared for Defendants.  After hearing from counsel and being \n19  advised as to the status, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n20  1.  Consistent with the Court’s prior orders, and given the Court’s “power to award such \n21  relief and issue such judgments as the Court deems necessary for enforcement of the \n22  Settlement  Agreement[,]”  (Settlement  Agreement  at  43,  ECF  No.  721-2),  the  Court \n23  continues its order requiring the Government to inform Plaintiffs’ counsel within 24 hours \n24  if it detains a member of the Ms. L. Class or other QAFMs defined in the Settlement \n25  Agreement.  The information provided to Plaintiffs’ counsel shall include, but is not limited \n26  to, the identity of the detained person, his or her A-file number, and place of detention.   \n27  2.  The Court also reimposes its stay on removal of Class Members or QAFMs defined \n28  in the Settlement Agreement pending reissuance of Acacia’s task order.   \n1 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 840     Filed 08/04/25     PageID.11918     Page\n2 of 3\n \n1  Defendants argue this stay is prohibited by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1), which states: \n2  Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party \nor parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall \n3 \nhave  jurisdiction  or  authority  to  enjoin  or  restrain  the  operation  of  the \n4  provisions  of  part  IV  of  this  subchapter,  as  amended  by  the  Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Responsibility Act of 1996, other than with respect \n5 \nto the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom \n6  proceedings under such part have been initiated.   \n7  8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1).  However, the Supreme Court has stated this subsection “says \n8  nothing about stays, but is instead titled, ‘Limit on injunctive relief,’ and refers to the \n9  authority of courts to ‘enjoin the removal of any alien.’”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, \n10  430 (2009) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(2)).  Although Defendants characterize this Court’s \n11  order as an injunction rather than a stay, their characterization of the Court’s action is not \n12  controlling.  Rather, the stay being imposed is simply a temporary suspension of any \n13  removal orders against Class Members and QAFMs while Defendants cure their breach of \n14  the legal provisions of the parties’ Settlement Agreement.   \n15  3.  Within ten (10) days of this Order being filed, Defendants shall produce to Plaintiffs’ \n16  counsel: (1) A list of the names, A numbers, and location of all Class Members and QAFMs \n17  currently in ICE custody, and (2) A list of the names, A numbers, and most current contact \n18  information for all class members and QAFMs required to report to ICE for check-ins.   \n19  4.  Until  the  Independent  Adjudicator  rules  on  membership  in  the  class  for  all \n20  outstanding applicants, Defendants shall not take immigration enforcement actions against \n21  these applicants.  Plaintiffs shall identify the pending applicants to Defendants upon entry \n22  of this Order.   \n23  5.  Counsel shall meet and confer on the reporting requirements set out in Section VI.B. \n24  of the Settlement Agreement.   \n25  6.  On the issue of (1) the suspension/extension of parole and work authorizations and \n26  (2) whether the Court can and should extend the various deadlines set out in the Settlement \n27  Agreement, Plaintiffs shall file their opening brief on these issues on or before August 7, \n28 \n2 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 840     Filed 08/04/25     PageID.11919     Page\n3 of 3\n \n1  2025, Defendants shall file their response on or before August 11, 2025, and Plaintiffs \n2  shall file their reply on or before August 13, 2025.   \n3  7.  The Court will hear argument on these issues at the next status conference, which \n4  shall be held on August 15, 2025, at 1:30 p.m.  Counsel shall submit a Joint Status Report \n5  to the Court on or before 5:00 p.m. on August 13, 2025.

This case challenges the United States government’s forcible \n4  separation of parents from their young children for no legitimate reason and \n5  notwithstanding the threat of irreparable damage that separation has been \n6  universally recognized to cause young children. \n7  2.  Plaintiff Ms. L. is the mother of a seven (7) year-old daughter, who \n8  was ripped away from her, and then sent halfway across the country to be detained \n9  alone. Plaintiff Ms. C. is the mother of a fourteen (14) year-old son, who was also \n10  forcibly separated from his mother and detained more than a thousand miles away. \n11  3.  Ms. L. and Ms. C. bring this action on behalf of themselves and \n12  thousands of other parents whom the government has forcibly separated from their \n13  children. Like Ms. L. and Ms. C., many of these individuals have fled persecution \n14  and are seeking asylum in the United States. Without any allegations of abuse, \n15  neglect, or parental unfitness, and with no hearings of any kind, the government is \n16  separating these families and detaining their young children, alone and frightened, \n17  in facilities often thousands of miles from their parents.  \n18  4.  Forced separation from parents causes severe trauma to young \n19  children, especially those who are already traumatized and are fleeing persecution \n20  in their home countries. The resulting cognitive and emotional damage can be \n21  permanent.  \n22  5.  Defendants have ample ways to keep Plaintiffs together with their \n23  children, as they have done for decades prior to their current practice. There are \n24  shelters that house families (including asylum-seekers) while they await the final \n25  adjudication of their immigration cases. If, however, the government lawfully \n26  continues detaining these parents and young children, it must at a minimum detain \n27  them together in one of its immigration family detention centers.  \n28 \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1752   Page 4 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    6.  The Due Process Cl ause of the Fifth Amendment does not permit the \n \n2    government to forcibly take young children from their parents, without justification \n \n3    or even a hearing. That separation also violates the asylum statutes, which \n \n4    guarantee a meaningful right to apply for asylum, and the Administrative Procedure \n \n5    Act (APA), which prohibits unlawful and arbitrary government action.  \n \n6    JURISDICTION \n \n7    7.  This case arises under the Fifth Amendment to the United States \n \n8    Constitution, federal asylum statutes, and the APA. The court has jurisdiction under \n \n9    28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction); 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas \n \n10  jurisdiction); and Art. I., § 9, cl. 2 of the U nited States Constitution (“Suspension \n \n11    Clause”). Plaintiffs are in custody for purposes of habeas jurisdiction.  \n \n12    VENUE \n \n13    8.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Ms. L. was \n \n14    detained in this District when this action commenced, Defendants reside in this \n \n15    District, and a substantial portion of the relevant facts occurred within this District, \n \n16    including the Defendants’ implementation of their practice of separating immigrant \n \n17    parents from their children for no legitimate reason. \n \n18    PARTIES \n \n19    9.  Plaintiff Ms. L. is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n \n20    (the “Congo” or “DRC”).  She is the mother of 7 year-old S.S. \n \n21    10.  Plaintiff Ms. C. is a citizen of Brazil.  She is the mother of 14 year-old \n \n22    J. \n \n23    11.  Defendants U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has \n \n24    responsibility for enforcing the immigration laws of the United States. \n \n25    12.  Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is the \n \n26    sub-agency of DHS that is responsible for carrying out removal orders and  \n27  overseeing immigration detention.  \n28 \n2 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1753   Page 5 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    13.  Defendant U.S. Cus toms and Border Protection (“CBP”) is the sub-\n \n2    agency of DHS that is responsible for the initial processing and detention of \n \n3    noncitizens who are apprehended near the U.S. border.  \n \n4    14.  Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a \n \n5    department of the executive branch of the U.S. government which has been \n \n6    delegated authority over “unaccompanied” noncitizen children.  \n \n7    15.  Defendant Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) is the component \n \n8    of HHS which provides care of and placement for “unaccompanied” noncitizen \n \n9    children.  \n \n10  16.  Defendant Thomas Homan is  sued in his official capacity as the \n \n11    Director of ICE, and is a legal custodian of Plaintiffs. \n \n12    17.

Defendant Kirstjen Nielsen, is sued in her official capacity as the \n \n23    Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. In this capacity, she directs \n \n24    each of the component agencies within DHS: ICE, USCIS, and CBP. As a result, \n \n25    Respondent Nielsen has responsibility for the administration of the immigration \n \n26    laws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103, is empowered to grant asylum or other re lief, and \n27  is a legal custodian of the Plaintiffs.  \n28 \n3 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1754   Page 6 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    22.

Defendant Alex Azar is sued in his official capacity as the Secretary of \n \n15    the Department of Health and Human Services.  \n \n16    28.  Defendant Scott Lloyd is sued in his official capacity as the Director of \n \n17    the Office of Refugee Resettlement.  \n \n18    FACTS \n \n19    29.  Over the past year, the government has separated thousands of migrant \n \n20    families for no legitimate purpose.  The government’s true purpose in separating \n \n21    these families was to deter future families from seeking refuge in the United States. \n \n22    30.  Many of these migrant families fled persecution and are seeking \n \n23    asylum. Although there are no allegations that the parents are unfit or abusing their \n \n24    children in any way, the government has forcibly separated them from their young \n \n25    children and detained the children, often far away, in facilities for “unaccompanied” \n \n26    minors.   \n27  31.  There is overwhelming medical evidence that the separation of a \n28  young child from his or her parent will have a devastating negative impact on the \n4 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1755   Page 7 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    child’s well-being, especially wh ere there are other traumatic factors at work, and \n \n2    that this damage can be permanent.  \n \n3    32.  The American Association of Pediatrics has denounced the \n \n4    Administration’s practice of separating migrant children from their parents, noting \n \n5    that: “The psychological distress, anxiety, and depression associated with \n \n6    separation from a parent would follow the children well after the immediate period \n \n7    of separation—even after the eventual reunification with a parent or other family.”  \n \n8    33.  Prior Administrations detained migrant families, but did not have a \n \n9    practice of forcibly separating fit parents from their young children. \n \n10  34.  There are non-governmental  shelters that specialize in housing and \n \n11    caring for families—including asylum seeking families—while their immigration \n \n12    applications are adjudicated.  \n \n13    35.  There are also government-operated family detention centers where \n \n14    parents can be housed together with their children, should the government lawfully \n \n15    decide not to release them. The government previously detained, and continues to \n \n16    detain, numerous family units at those facilities. \n \n17    36.  In April 2018, the New York Times reported that more than “700 \n \n18    children have been taken from adults claiming to be their parents since October [of \n \n19    2016], including more than 100 children under the age of 4.” Caitlin Dickerson, \n \n20    Hundreds of Children Have Been Taken from Parents at U.S. Border, N.Y. Times, \n \n21    Apr. 20, 2018. \n \n22    37.  On May 7, 2018, Defendant Sessions announced “a new initiative” to \n \n23    refer “100 percent” of immigrants who cross the Southwest border for criminal \n \n24    immigration prosecutions, also known as the “zero-tolerance policy.” Defendant \n \n25    Sessions stated that as part of that prosecution, all parents who are prosecuted \n \n26    would be separated from their children. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney Ge neral \n27  Sessions Delivers Remarks to the Association of State Criminal Investigative \n28  Agencies 2018 Spring Conference (May 7, 2018).  The purpose of this new policy \n5 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1756   Page 8 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    was to separate families in the ho pe that it would deter other families from seeking \n \n2    refuge in the United States.   \n \n3    38.  At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in May, a deputy chief of \n \n4    Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection testified that between May 6 and \n \n5    May 19 alone, a total of 658 children were separated from their family members \n \n6    pursuant to this policy. The Washington Post reported that in the city of McAllen, \n \n7    Texas, 415 children were taken from their parents during a two week period.1 And \n \n8    in June 2018, the Department of Homeland Security reported that in the six weeks \n \n9    between April 19 and May 31, the administration took almost 2,000 children away \n \n10  from their parents.2   \n \n11    39.  Defendant Sessions and other government officials, including \n \n12    Defendant Nielsen, have repeatedly defended the separation of children from their \n \n13    parents in speeches and interviews with various media outlets. Among other \n \n14    justifications for the practice, they have stated that separating families would be a \n \n15    way to “discourage parents from bringing their children here illegally,”3 and that it \n \n16    would help “deter more movement” to the United States by asylum seekers and \n \n17    other migrants.4  Administration officials told the New York Times in May, “[t]he \n \n18    president and his aides in the White House had been pushing a family separation \n \n19    policy for weeks as a way of deterring families from trying to cross the border \n \n20    illegally.”5 \n \n21 \n \n                                                 \n \n22  1 https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-zero-tolerance-\n \n  at-the-border-is-causing-child-shelters-to-fill-up-fast/2018/05/29/7aab0ae4-636b-\n23 \n  11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html?utm_term=.d52d94c37d05. \n \n24    2 https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1JB2SF-OCATP. \n \n25    3 http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1801/16/cnr.04.html. \n \n26  4 https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/john-kelly-separating-children-from-\n   \nparents-immigration-border/ \n27 \n5 https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/us/politics/trump-homeland-security-\n28 \nsecretary-resign.html \n6 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1757   Page 9 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    40.  Even if the separate d child is released from custody and placed in a \n \n2    community setting or foster care, the trauma of the ongoing separation continues. \n \n3    41.  By taking away their children, Defendants are coercing class members \n \n4    into giving up their claims for asylum and other legal protection. Numerous class \n \n5    members have been told by CBP and ICE agents that they will see their children \n \n6    again sooner if they withdraw their asylum applications and accept earlier \n \n7    deportation.6 \n \n8    42.  Many class members have given up their asylum claims and stipulated \n \n9    to removal as a way to be reunited with their children faster. \n \n10  43.  For class members who have  not been coerced into giving up their \n \n11    asylum claims, separation from their children has made those applications much \n \n12    more difficult. Separation prevents parents from helping their children apply for \n \n13    asylum and navigate removal proceedings. Separation also makes it harder for \n \n14    parents to present facts involving their children which support their own asylum \n \n15    claims. \n \n16    44.  The trauma of separation also renders asylum-seeking class members \n \n17    too distraught to effectively pursue their asylum applications.  See, e.g., Angelina \n \n18    Chapin, Separated Parents Are Failing Asylum Screenings Because They’re So \n \n19    Heartbroken, Huffington Post (June 30, 2018).7 \n \n20 \n \n                                                   \n21 \n  6 This practice has been widely reported. See, e.g., Dara Lind, Trump Will Reunite \n \n22  Separated Families—But Only if They Agree to Deportation, Vox.com (June 25, \n \n  2018), https://www.vox.com/2018/6/25/17484042/children-parents-separate-\n23 \n \nreunite-plan-trump; Jay Root & Shannon Najmabadi, Kids in Exchange for \n \n24  Deportation: Detained Migrants Say They Were Told They Could Get Kids Back on \n \n  Way Out of U.S., Texas Tribune (June 24, 2018), \n25 \n \nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2018/06/24/kids-exchange-deportation-migrants-\n \n26  claim-they-were-promised-they-could/?utm_campaign=trib-\n   \nsocial&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=1529859032. \n27 \n7 https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/separated-parents-too-grief-stricken-to-\n28 \nseek-asylum-experts-say_us_5b379974e4b08c3a8f6ad5d9. \n7 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1758   Page 10 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    45.  Defendants have de ported class members without their separated \n \n2    children. Their children are now stranded in the United States alone. Many of these \n \n3    parents are now struggling to make contact with their children, who are being \n \n4    detained thousands of miles away across multiple international borders. See Miriam \n \n5    Jordan, “I Can’t Go Without My Son,” a Mother Pleaded as She Was Deported to \n \n6    Guatemala, N.Y. Times (June 17, 2018).8 \n \n7    46.  On June 20, 2018, President Trump signed an Executive Order (“EO”) \n \n8    purporting to end certain family separations going forward.9 The EO directs DHS to \n \n9    “maintain custody of alien families during the pendency of any criminal improper \n \n10  entry or immigration proceedings.”   \n \n11    47.  The EO directs DHS to separate families any time DHS determines \n \n12    that separation would protect “the child’s welfare.”  It does not, however, set forth \n \n13    how that standard will be applied.  In prior cases the government has applied that \n \n14    standard in a manner that is inconsistent with the child’s best interest, including in \n \n15    Ms. L’s case. \n \n16    48.  The EO makes no provision for reunifying the thousands of families \n \n17    who were separated prior to its issuance. \n \n18    49.  The EO makes no provision for returning separated children to parents \n \n19    who have been already been deported without their children. \n \n20    NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n \n21    50.   Ms. L. and her daughter S.S. are one of the many families that have \n \n22    recently been separated by the government.  \n \n23 \n \n                                                 \n \n24  8 https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/us/immigration-deported-parents.html.

Ms. L. and her daug hter are seeking asylum in the United States.  \n \n2    52.  Ms. L. is Catholic and sought shelter in a church until she was able to \n \n3    escape the Congo with S.S. \n \n4    53.  Upon reaching the United States, Ms. L. and S.S. presented themselves \n \n5    at the San Ysidro, California Port of Entry on November 1, 2017.  Although their \n \n6    native language is Lingala, they were able to communicate to the border guards that \n \n7    they sought asylum.   \n \n8    54.  Based on her expression of a fear of returning to the Congo, Ms. L. \n \n9    was referred for an initial screening before an asylum officer, called a “credible fear \n \n10  interview.” She subsequently passed the c redible fear screening but, until March 6, \n \n11    2018, remained detained in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in the San Diego area.   \n \n12    55.  On or about November 5, immigration officials forcibly separated \n \n13    then-6 year-old S.S. from her mother and sent S.S. to Chicago. There she was \n \n14    housed in a detention facility for “unaccompanied” minors run by the Office of \n \n15    Refugee Resettlement (ORR).  \n \n16    56.  When S.S. was taken away from her mother, she was screaming and \n \n17    crying, pleading with guards not to take her away from her mother. While detained, \n \n18    Ms. L. spoke to her daughter approximately 6 times by phone, never by video.  For \n \n19    months she was terrified that she would never see her daughter again. The few \n \n20    times Ms. L. was able to speak to her daughter on the phone, her daughter was \n \n21    crying and scared. \n \n22    57.  In December, S.S. turned 7 and spent her birthday in the Chicago \n \n23    facility, without her mother. \n \n24    58.  In detention, Ms. L. was distraught and depressed because of her \n \n25    separation from her daughter. As a result, she did not eat properly, lost weight, and \n \n26    was not sleeping due to worry and nightmares.   \n27  59.     In one moment of extreme despair and confusion, Ms. L. told an \n28  immigration judge that she wanted to withdraw her application for asylum, \n9 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1760   Page 12 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    realizing her mistake only a few  days later. She is seeking to reopen her case before \n \n2    the Board of Immigration Appeals. \n \n3    60.  The government had no legitimate interest in separating Ms. L. and her \n \n4    child. \n \n5    61.  There has been no evidence, or even accusation, that S.S. was abused \n \n6    or neglected by Ms. L. \n \n7    62.  There is no evidence that Ms. L. is an unfit parent or that she is not \n \n8    acting in the best interests of her child.  \n \n9    63.  After Ms. L. filed this lawsuit and moved for a preliminary injunction, \n \n10  Defendants abruptly released her from cus tody on March 6, 2018, due to the filing \n \n11    of the lawsuit. Defendants informed her that she would be released mere hours in \n \n12    advance, with no arrangements for where she would stay. S.S. was released to Ms. \n \n13    L.’s custody several days later. Both are now pursuing their claims for legal \n \n14    protection.  \n \n15    64.  Ms. C. and her 14 year-old son, J., are another one of the families who \n \n16    have been separated by the government. Like Ms. L. and her daughter, Ms. C. and \n \n17    her son are seeking asylum in the United States. \n \n18    65.  Ms. C. and J. fled Brazil and came to the United States to seek asylum. \n \n19    A few feet after Ms. C. entered the United States, a border guard approached her, \n \n20    and she explained that she was seeking asylum. Ms. C. subsequently passed a \n \n21    credible fear interview, and was put in removal proceedings, where she is applying \n \n22    for asylum. \n \n23    66.  Despite having communicated her fear of persecution to border guards, \n \n24    the government prosecuted Ms. C. for entering the country illegally, took her son J. \n \n25    away from her, and sent him to a facility for “unaccompanied” children in Chicago. \n \n26    67.  The government continued to separate Ms. C. from her son ev en after \n27  she completed serving her criminal misdemeanor sentence on September 22, 2017, \n28  and was sent to an immigration detention facility, the El Paso Processing Center. In \n10 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1761   Page 13 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    early January 2018, she was tran sferred again, to another immigration facility, the \n \n2    West Texas Detention Facility (also known as Sierra Blanca), but still was not \n \n3    reunited with her son. Even after Ms. C was released from immigration detention \n \n4    on April 5, 2018, the government did not reunify her with her son for another two \n \n5    months, until June 9. \n \n6    68.  While separated from J., Ms. C. was desperate to be reunited with him.  \n \n7    She worried about him constantly and did not know when she would be able to see \n \n8    him. They spoke on the phone only a handful of times while they were separated by \n \n9    Defendants. \n \n10  69.  J. had a difficult time emotio nally during the months he was separated \n \n11    from his mother. \n \n12    70.  The government had no legitimate interest for the separation of Ms. C. \n \n13    and her child. \n \n14    71.  There is no evidence, or even accusation, that J. was abused or \n \n15    neglected by Ms. C. \n \n16    72.  There is no evidence that Ms. C. is an unfit parent or that she is not \n \n17    acting in the best interests of her child. \n \n18    CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n \n19    73.   Plaintiffs bring this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n \n20    23(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of all other persons \n \n21    similarly situated. \n \n22    74.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class: \n   \n23 \n \nAll adult parents who enter the United States at or between designated ports \n \n24  of entry who (1) have been, are, or will be detained in immigration custody \n \n  by the DHS, and (2) have a minor child who is or will be separated from \n25 \n \nthem by DHS and detained in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or DHS \n \n26  custody, absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to \n   \nthe child. \n27 \n \n28 \n11 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1762   Page 14 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    75.  Ms. L. and Ms. C. a re each adequate representatives of the proposed \n \n2    class. \n \n3    76.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because \n \n4    the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. There are at a \n \n5    minimum hundreds of parents who fit within the class.   \n \n6    77.  The class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule of \n \n7    Civil Procedure 23(a)(2). The members of the class are subject to a common \n \n8    practice: forcibly separating detained parents from their minor children absent any \n \n9    determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child. By definition, \n \n10  all class members have experienced that p ractice, and none has been given an \n \n11    adequate hearing regarding the separation. The lawsuit raises numerous questions \n \n12    of law common to members of the proposed class, including: whether Defendants’ \n \n13    family separation practice violates class members’ substantive due process right to \n \n14    family integrity; whether the practice violates class members’ procedural due \n \n15    process rights; whether the practice violates the federal asylum statute; and whether \n \n16    these separations are unlawful or arbitrary and capricious under the APA. \n \n17    78.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule \n \n18    of Civil Procedure 23(a)(3), because the claims of the representative Plaintiffs are \n \n19    typical of the claims of the class. Ms. L., Ms. C., and the proposed class members \n \n20    are all individuals who have had or will have their children forcibly taken away \n \n21    from them despite there being no proven allegations of abuse, neglect, or any other \n \n22    danger or unfitness. Plaintiffs and the proposed class also share the same legal \n \n23    claims, which assert the same substantive and procedural rights under the Due \n \n24    Process Clause, the asylum statute, and the APA.  \n \n25    79.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule \n \n26    of Civil Procedure 23(a)(4). The representative Plaintiffs seek the same rel ief as the \n27  other members of the class—namely, an order that they be reunified with their \n28  children, whether through release or in family detention facilities. In defending their \n12 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1763   Page 15 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    own rights, Ms. L. and Ms. C. w ill defend the rights of all proposed class members \n \n2    fairly and adequately.  \n \n3    80.  The proposed class is represented by counsel from the American Civil \n \n4    Liberties Union Immigrants’ Rights Project and the ACLU of San Diego and \n \n5    Imperial Counties. Counsel have extensive experience litigating class action \n \n6    lawsuits and other complex cases in federal court, including civil rights lawsuits on \n \n7    behalf of noncitizens.  \n \n8    81.  The members of the class are readily ascertainable through \n \n9    Defendants’ records.  \n \n10  82.  The proposed class also satis fies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n \n11    23(b)(2). Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class by \n \n12    unlawfully separating parents from their young children. Injunctive and declaratory \n \n13    relief is thus appropriate with respect to the class as a whole.  \n \n14    CAUSES OF ACTION \n \n15    COUNT I \n \n16    (Violation of Due Process: Right to Family Integrity) \n \n17    83.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n \n18    fully set forth herein.  \n \n19    84.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all \n \n20    “persons” on United States soil and thus applies to Ms. L., Ms. C., their children \n \n21    S.S. and J., and all proposed class members.  \n \n22    85.  Plaintiffs, their children, and all class members have liberty interests \n \n23    under the Due Process Clause in remaining together as families.  \n \n24    86.  The separation of the class members from their children violates \n \n25    substantive due process because it furthers no legitimate purpose and was designed \n \n26    to deter.    \n27  87.  The separation of the class members from their children also violates \n28  procedural due process because it was undertaken without any hearing.  \n13 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1764   Page 16 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1      COUNT II \n \n2    (Administrative Procedure Act: Arbitrary and Capricious Practice) \n \n3    88.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n \n4    fully set forth herein.  \n \n5    89.  The APA prohibits agency action that is arbitrary and capricious or \n \n6    violates a person’s legal or constitutional rights.  \n \n7    90.  Defendants’ separation practice is final agency action for which there \n \n8    is no other adequate remedy in a court. Defendants’ decision to separate parents is \n \n9    not tentative or interlocutory, because Defendants have already separated thousands \n \n10  of families and continue to do so, and the  policy was announced by high-level \n \n11    officials. And Defendants’ decision to separate gravely impacts class members’ \n \n12    rights to remain together as families. \n \n13    91.  Defendants’ separation of Ms. L., Ms. C., and the other class members \n \n14    from their children without any explanation or legitimate justification is arbitrary \n \n15    and capricious and accordingly violates the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \n \n16    92.  Among other things, Defendants failed to offer adequate reasons for \n \n17    adopting their unprecedented new separation practice; they failed to explain why \n \n18    they were not using alternatives to separation, including supervised release and \n \n19    family detention; and for parents like Ms. L., Defendants have never explained why \n \n20    they cannot verify parentage before imposing traumatic separation on both parent \n \n21    and child.  \n \n22    COUNT III \n \n23    (Violation of Right to Seek Protection Under the Asylum and Withholding of \n \n24    Removal Statutes, and the Convention Against Torture)  \n \n25    93.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n \n26    fully set forth herein.    \n27  94.  Under United States law, noncitizens with a well-founded fear of \n28  persecution shall have the opportunity to apply for asylum in the United States. 8 \n14 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1765   Page 17 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    U.S.C. § 1158(a). In addition, no ncitizens have a mandatory statutory entitlement to \n \n2    withholding of removal where they would face a probability of persecution if \n \n3    removed to their country of nationality, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), or withholding or \n \n4    deferral of removal where they would face a probability of torture.  Foreign  Affairs \n \n5    Reform  and  Restructuring  Act  (“FARRA”),  Pub.  L.  No.  105-277,  Div.  G.,  \n \n6    Title XXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681-822 (Oct. 21, 1998) (codified as Note to 8 \n \n7    U.S.C.§ 1231).  \n \n8    95.  Class members have a private right of action to challenge violations of \n \n9    their right to apply for asylum under § 1158(a). That right is not barred by 8 U.S.C. \n \n10  § 1158(d)(7), which applies to only certain  procedural requirements set out in \n \n11    Section 1158(d). \n \n12    96.  Defendants’ separation of families violates federal law that provides \n \n13    for asylum and other protection from removal, as well as their due process right to \n \n14    seek such relief.  Separation severely impedes their ability to pursue their asylum \n \n15    and other protection claims in a number of ways, including by denying them the \n \n16    ability to coordinate their applications with their children, present facts related to \n \n17    their children, and creating trauma that hinders their ability to navigate the complex \n \n18    process. \n \n19    97.  The government is also using the trauma of separation to coerce \n \n20    parents into giving up their asylum and protection claims in order to be reunited \n \n21    with their children. \n \n22    PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n23    Plaintiffs request that the Court enter a judgment against Defendants and \n \n24    award the following relief:  \n \n25    A. Certify a class of all adult parents nationwide who enter the United States \n \n26    at or between designated ports of entry who (1) have been, are, or will be d etained \n27  in immigration custody by the DHS, and (2) have a minor child who is or will be \n28  separated from them by DHS and detained in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or \n15 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 85   Filed 07/03/18   PageID.1766   Page 18 of 19\n \n \n \n \n1    DHS custody, absent a determina tion that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to \n \n2    the child. \n \n3    B. Name Ms. L. and Ms. C. as representatives of the class, and appoint \n \n4    Plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel;  \n \n5    C. Declare the separation of Ms. L., Ms. C., and the other class members \n \n6    from their children unlawful;  \n \n7    D. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from continuing to \n \n8    separate the class members from their children;  \n \n9    E. Order Defendants either to release class members along with their \n \n10  children, or to detain them together in the  same facility;  \n \n11    F. Enjoin Defendants from removing any class members from the country \n \n12    who have received final removal orders until they are reunited with their children, \n \n13    unless the class members knowingly and voluntarily decide that they do not want \n \n14    their children removed with them; \n \n15    G. Enjoin Defendants from removing any class member who received a final \n \n16    removal order prior to the issuance of this Court’s preliminary injunction on June \n \n17    26, 2018, or prior to receiving notice of their rights under the injunction, until they \n \n18    have had an opportunity to consult with class counsel, or a delegate of class \n \n19    counsel, to insure that these class members have knowingly and voluntarily chosen \n \n20    to forego any further challenges to removal, rather than feeling coerced into doing \n \n21    so as a result of separation from their children. \n \n22    H.  Require Defendants to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs;  \n \n23    I. Order all other relief that is just and proper. \n \n24     \n  Dated: July 3, 2018  Respectfully Submitted,  \n25 \n   \n  /s/Lee Gelernt \n26 \n  Bardis Vakili (SBN 247783)  Lee Gelernt*   \nACLU FOUNDATION OF SAN  Judy Rabinovitz* \n27 \nDIEGO & IMPERIAL COUNTIES  Anand Balakrishnan* \nP.O.

This case challenges the United States government’s forcible \n3  separation of parents from their young children for no legitimate reason and \n4  notwithstanding the threat of irreparable psychological damage that separation has \n5  been universally recognized to cause young children.  \n6  2.  Plaintiff Ms. L. is the mother of a seven (7) year-old daughter, who \n7  was ripped away from her, and then sent halfway across the country to be detained \n8  alone.  Plaintiff Ms. C. is the mother of a fourteen (14) year-old son, who was also \n9  forcibly separated from his mother and detained more than a thousand miles away. \n10  3.  Ms. L. and Ms. C. bring this action to have the government reunite \n11  them with their young children, from whom they have been separated now for more \n12  than four and five months respectively. \n13  4.  They also bring this action on behalf of the hundreds of other parents \n14  whom the government has forcibly separated from their children and continues to \n15  separate.  Like Ms. L. and Ms. C., almost all of these individuals have fled \n16  persecution and are seeking asylum in the United States.  Without any assertions of \n17  abuse, neglect, or parental unfitness, and with no hearings of any kind, the \n18  government is detaining these young children, alone and frightened, in facilities \n19  often thousands of miles from their parents. \n20  5.  Forced separation from parents causes severe trauma to young \n21  children, especially those who are already traumatized and are fleeing persecution \n22  in their home countries.  The resulting cognitive and emotional damage can be \n23  permanent.   \n24  6.  Defendants have ample ways to keep Plaintiffs together with their \n25  children.  There are shelters that house families (including asylum-seekers) while \n26  they await the final adjudication of their immigration cases.  If, however, the \n27  government feels compelled to continue detaining these parents and young children, \n28 \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 32   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.619   Page 4 of 15\n \n \n \n \n1    it must at a minimum detain them   together in one of its immigration family \n \n2    detention centers.  \n \n3    7.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not permit the \n \n4    government to forcibly take young children from their parents, without justification \n \n5    or even a hearing.  That separation also violates the asylum statutes, which \n \n6    guarantee a meaningful right to apply for asylum, and the Administrative Procedure \n \n7    Act (APA), which prohibits arbitrary government action. \n \n8    JURISDICTION \n \n9    8.  This case arises under the Fifth Amendment to the United States \n \n10  Constitution, federal asylum statutes, and  the APA.  The court has jurisdiction \n11  under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction); 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas \n12  jurisdiction); and Art. I., § 9, cl. 2 of the United States Constitution (“Suspension \n13  Clause”).  Plaintiffs are in custody for purposes of habeas jurisdiction. \n14  VENUE \n15  9.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because Ms. L. was detained \n16  within this District when this action commenced and a substantial portion of the \n17  relevant facts occurred within this District, including the separation of Ms. L. and \n18  her daughter. \n19  PARTIES \n20  10.  Plaintiff Ms. L. is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n21  (the “Congo” or “DRC”).  She is the mother of 7 year-old S.S. \n22  11.   Plaintiff Ms. C. is a citizen of Brazil.  She is the mother of 14 year-old \n23  J. \n24  12.  Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is the \n25  sub-agency of DHS that is responsible for carrying out removal orders and \n26  overseeing immigration detention.  \n27  13.  Defendants U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has \n28  responsibility for enforcing the immigration laws of the United States. \n2 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 32   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.620   Page 5 of 15\n \n \n \n \n1    14.  Defendant U.S. Cus toms and Border Protection (“CBP”) is the sub-\n \n2    agency of DHS that is responsible for the initial processing and detention of \n \n3    noncitizens who are apprehended near the U.S. border. \n \n4    15.  Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is \n \n5    the sub-agency of DHS that, through its Asylum Officers, conducts interviews of \n \n6    certain individuals apprehended at the border to determine whether they have a \n \n7    credible fear of persecution and should be permitted to apply for asylum. \n \n8    16.  Defendant U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a \n \n9    department of the executive branch of the U.S. government which has been \n \n10  delegated with authority over “unaccompa nied” noncitizen children. \n11  17.  Defendant Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) is the component \n12  of HHS which provides care of and placement for “unaccompanied” noncitizen \n13  children. \n14  18.  Defendant Thomas Homan is sued in his official capacity as the \n15  Director of ICE, and is a legal custodian of Plaintiffs. \n16  19.

Over the past year, the government has separated hundreds of migrant \n23  families for no legitimate purpose.   \n24  32.  Almost all of these migrant families fled persecution and are seeking \n25  asylum.  Although there are no allegations that the parents are unfit or abusing their \n26  children in any way, the government has forcibly separated them from their young \n27  children and detained the children, often far away, in facilities for “unaccompanied” \n28  minors. \n4 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 32   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.622   Page 7 of 15\n \n \n \n \n1    33.  There is overwhelm ing medical evidence that the separation of a \n \n2    young child from his or her parent will have a devastating negative impact on the \n \n3    child’s well-being, especially where there are other traumatic factors at work, and \n \n4    that this damage can be permanent.  \n \n5    34.  The American Association of Pediatrics has recently denounced the \n \n6    Administration’s practice of separating migrant children from their parents, noting \n \n7    that: “The psychological distress, anxiety, and depression associated with \n \n8    separation from a parent would follow the children well after the immediate period \n \n9    of separation—even after the eventual reunification with a parent or other family.” \n \n10  33.   Prior Administrations detain ed migrant families, but did not have a \n11  practice of forcibly separating fit parents from their young children.  \n12  34.  According to reports, the government may soon adopt a formal \n13  national policy of separating migrant families, and placing the children in \n14  government facilities for unaccompanied minors.    \n15  35.   There are non-governmental shelters that specialize in housing and \n16  caring for families—including asylum seeking families—while their immigration \n17  applications are adjudicated.  \n18  36.  There are also government-operated family detention centers where \n19  parents can be housed together with their children, should the government decide \n20  not to release them. \n21  37.  Ms. L. and her daughter S.S. are one of the many families that have \n22  recently been separated by the government.  \n23  38.  Ms. L. and her daughter are seeking asylum in the United States.  \n24  39.  Ms. L. is Catholic and sought shelter in a church until she was able to \n25  escape the Congo with S.S. \n26  40.  Upon reaching the United States, Ms. L. and S.S. presented themselves \n27  at the San Ysidro, California Port of Entry on November 1, 2017.  Although their \n28 \n5 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 32   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.623   Page 8 of 15\n \n \n \n \n1    native language is Lingala, they w  ere able to communicate to the border guards that \n \n2    they sought asylum.   \n \n3    41.  Based on her expression of a fear of returning to the Congo, Ms. L. \n \n4    was referred for an initial screening before an asylum officer, called a “credible fear \n \n5    interview.”   She subsequently passed the credible fear screening but, until March 6, \n \n6    2018, remained detained in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in the San Diego area.   \n \n7    42.  On or about November 5, immigration officials forcibly separated 7-\n \n8    year-old S.S. from her mother and sent S.S. to Chicago.  There she was housed in a \n \n9    detention facility for “unaccompanied” minors run by the Office of Refugee \n \n10  Resettlement (ORR).    \n11  43.  When S.S. was taken away from her mother, she was screaming and \n12  crying, pleading with guards not to take her away from her mother.  That was the \n13  last time Ms. L. saw her daughter.  During the few times Ms. L. was able to speak \n14  to her daughter on the phone, her daughter was crying and scared.  Although her \n15  daughter was terrified for herself, she was also frightened for her mother, always \n16  asking how her mother was doing in “prison.” \n17  44.  Ms. L. and her daughter have been separated now for more than four \n18  months.  Seven-year-old S.S. is alone in a facility in Chicago. \n19  45.  While detained, Ms. L. spoke to her daughter approximately 6 times \n20  by phone, never by video.  For months she has been terrified that she would never \n21  see her daughter again.  \n22  46.  S.S. is scared and misses her mother, and wants to be reunited with her \n23  as soon as possible.  In December, S.S. turned 7 and spent her birthday in the \n24  Chicago facility, without her mother. \n25  47.  Every day that S.S. is separated from her mother causes her greater \n26  emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent \n27  emotional trauma.  \n28 \n6 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 32   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.624   Page 9 of 15\n \n \n \n \n1    48.  Ms. L. is distraught  and depressed because of the separation from her \n \n2    daughter.  In detention, she did not eat properly, lost weight, and was not sleeping \n \n3    due to worry and nightmares. \n \n4    49.     In one moment of extreme despair and confusion, Ms. L. told an \n \n5    immigration judge that she wanted to withdraw her application for asylum, \n \n6    realizing her mistake only a few days later.  Her application to reopen her asylum \n \n7    case is pending before the immigration judge. \n \n8    50.  The government has no legitimate interest in separating Ms. L. and her \n \n9    child. \n \n10  51.  There has been no evidence,  or even accusation, that S.S. was abused \n11  or neglected by Ms. L. \n12  52.  There is no evidence that Ms. L. is an unfit parent or that she is not \n13  acting in the best interests of her child.  \n14  53.  After Ms. L. filed this lawsuit and moved for a preliminary injunction, \n15  Defendants abruptly released her from custody on March 6, 2018.  Defendants \n16  informed her that she would be released mere hours in advance, with no \n17  arrangements for where she would stay.  They have not reunited her with her \n18  daughter, who remains detained at an ORR facility halfway across the country. \n19  54.  Ms. C. and her 14 year-old son, J., are another one of the families who \n20  have been separated by the government.  Like Ms. L. and her daughter, Ms. C. and \n21  her son are seeking asylum in the United States. \n22  55.  Ms. C. and J. fled Brazil and came to the United States to seek asylum.  \n23  A few feet after Ms. C. entered the United States, a border guard approached her, \n24  and she explained that she was seeking asylum.  Ms. C. subsequently passed a \n25  credible fear interview, and was put in removal proceedings, where she is applying \n26  for asylum. \n27 \n28 \n7 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 32   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.625   Page 10 of 15\n \n \n \n \n1    56.  Despite having com municated her fear of persecution to border guards, \n \n2    the government prosecuted Ms. C. for entering the country illegally, took her son J. \n \n3    away from her, and sent him to a facility for “unaccompanied” children in Chicago. \n \n4    57.  The government continued to separate Ms. C. from her son even after \n \n5    she completed serving her 25-day criminal misdemeanor sentence on September 22, \n \n6    2017, and was sent to an immigration detention facility, the El Paso Processing \n \n7    Center.  In early January 2018, she was transferred again, to another immigration \n \n8    facility, the West Texas Detention Facility (also known as Sierra Blanca), but still \n \n9    not reunited with her son. \n \n10  58.  Ms. C. has not seen her son s ince he was taken from her in the more \n11  than 5 months since she was placed into an immigration detention facility.  She is \n12  desperate to be reunited with him.  She worries about him constantly and does not \n13  know when she will be able to see him.  They have only spoken on the phone a \n14  handful of times since they were forcibly separated by Defendants. \n15  59.  J. has been having a difficult time emotionally since being separated \n16  from his mother. \n17  60.  Every day that J. is separated from his mother causes him greater \n18  emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent \n19  emotional trauma. \n20  61.  The government has no legitimate interest in separating Ms. C. and her \n21  child. \n22  62.  There has been no evidence, or even accusation, that J. was abused or \n23  neglected by Ms. C. \n24  63.  There is no evidence that Ms. C. is an unfit parent or that she is not \n25  acting in the best interests of her child.  \n26 \n27 \n28 \n8 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 32   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.626   Page 11 of 15\n \n \n \n \n1    CLA  SS ALLEGATIONS \n \n2    64.  Plaintiffs bring this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n \n3    23(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of all other persons \n \n4    similarly situated.  \n \n5    65.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following nationwide class:  \n \n6    All adult parents nationwide who (1) are or will be detained in immigration \n  custody by the Department of Homeland Security, and (2) have a minor child \n7 \n \nwho is or will be separated from them by DHS and detained in ORR custody, \n \n8    absent a demonstration in a hearing that the parent is unfit or presents a \ndanger to the child.    \n9 \n \n \n10  66.  Plaintiffs Ms. L. and Ms. C. are each adequate representatives of the \n \n11  proposed class.   \n12  67.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because \n13  the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \n14  68.  There are hundreds of parents that fit within the class and many more \n15  that will become separated from their young children. \n16  69.  The class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule of \n17  Civil Procedure 23(a)(2).  The members of the class are subject to a common \n18  practice: forcibly separating detained parents from their minor children.  By \n19  definition, all class members have experienced that practice, and none has been \n20  given an adequate hearing regarding the separation.  The lawsuit raises numerous \n21  questions of law common to members of the proposed class, including: whether \n22  Defendants’ family separation practice violates class members’ substantive due \n23  process right to family integrity; whether the practice violates class members’ \n24  procedural due process rights; whether the practice violates the federal asylum \n25  statute; and whether these separations are arbitrary and capricious under the APA. \n26  70.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule \n27  of Civil Procedure 23(a)(3), because the claims of the representative Plaintiffs are \n28  typical of the claims of the class.  Ms. L., Ms. C., and the proposed class members \n9 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 32   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.627   Page 12 of 15\n \n \n \n \n1    are all individuals who have had  or will have their children forcibly taken away \n \n2    from them despite there being no proven allegations of abuse, neglect, or any other \n \n3    danger or unfitness.  Plaintiffs and the proposed class also share the same legal \n \n4    claims, which assert the same substantive and procedural rights under the Due \n \n5    Process Clause, the asylum statute, and the APA. \n \n6    71.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule \n \n7    of Civil Procedure 23(a)(4).  The representative Plaintiffs seek the same relief as \n \n8    the other members of the class—namely, an order that they be reunified with their \n \n9    children, whether through release or in family detention facilities.  In defending \n \n10  their own rights, Ms. L. and Ms. C. will de fend the rights of all proposed class \n11  members fairly and adequately. \n12  72.  The proposed class is represented by counsel from the American Civil \n13  Liberties Union Immigrants’ Rights Project and the American Civil Liberties Union \n14  of San Diego and Imperial Counties.  Counsel have extensive experience litigating \n15  class action lawsuits and other complex cases in federal court, including civil rights \n16  lawsuits on behalf of noncitizens. \n17  73.  The members of the class are readily ascertainable through \n18  Defendants’ records. \n19  74.  The proposed class also satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n20  23(b)(2).  Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class by \n21  unlawfully separating parents from their young children.  Injunctive and declaratory \n22  relief is thus appropriate with respect to the class as a whole.  \n23   \n24   \n25   \n26   \n27   \n28   \n10 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 32   Filed 03/09/18   PageID.628   Page 13 of 15\n \n \n \n \n1    CA USES OF ACTION \n \n2    COUNT I \n \n3    (Violation of Due Process) \n \n4    75.

Ms. L., Ms. C., their children, and all class members have a liberty \n \n10  interest under the Due Process Clause in r emaining together as a family. \n11  78.  The separation of the class members from their children violates \n12  substantive due process because it furthers no legitimate purpose, not to mention a \n13  compelling governmental interest. \n14  79.

This is an immigration case involving the United States government’s \n3  forcible separation of plaintiff from her seven (7) year-old-daughter, S.S.  \n4  2.  Plaintiff, Ms. L., is S.S.’s mother and a native of the Democratic \n5  Republic of Congo. Fearing near certain death in the Congo, Ms. L. escaped with \n6  S.S.  \n7  3.  Upon arriving at a United States Port of Entry near San Diego on \n8  November 1, 2017, they presented themselves to border agents. Although their \n9  native language is Lingala, they were able to explain to the border guards, in the \n10  little bit of Spanish they knew, that they sought asylum.  \n11  4.  Based on her expression of a fear of returning to Congo, Ms. L. was \n12  given an initial screening interview before an asylum officer.  The initial interview \n13  requires the asylum officer to determine whether the applicant has a significant \n14  possibility of ultimately receiving asylum.  The officer determined that Ms. L. did \n15  have a significant possibility of ultimately receiving asylum and therefore allowed \n16  her to move on to the next stage of the long asylum process. \n17  5.  Since their arrival on November 1, Ms. L. and S.S. have been detained. \n18  6.  For the first 4 days upon arriving, Ms. L. and S.S. were detained \n19  together, in what Ms. L. understood to be some sort of motel.  \n20  7.  Ms. L. was then sent to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in the San \n21  Diego area, where she remains today, nearly four months later.  But her daughter \n22  S.S. was taken from her. \n23  8.  Although S.S. is only 7 years old, she was sent half way across the \n24  country to a facility in Chicago without her mother, or anyone else she knows.   \n25  9.  When the officers separated them, Ms. L. could hear her daughter in \n26  the next room frantically screaming that she wanted to remain with her mother. \n27 \n28 \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 1   Filed 02/26/18   PageID.4   Page 4 of 12\n \n \n \n \n1    10.  No one explained to  Ms. L. why they were taking her daughter away \n \n2    from her or where her daughter was going or even when she would next see her \n \n3    daughter.   \n \n4    11.  Ms. L. did not get to speak to her daughter until approximately four \n \n5    days later, and then only on the phone.  In the nearly four months they have been \n \n6    separated, Ms. L. has only spoken to her daughter approximately 6 times, and then \n \n7    only by phone, and never by video hookup where they can see each other.  \n \n8    12.  On the phone, S.S. cries and is fearful of what will happen to her and \n \n9    her mother.  She also worries constantly about how her mother is doing in “prison” \n \n10  and whether she is eating and sleeping pro perly. \n11  13.  Ms. L. tries to remain positive during these calls and comfort her \n12  daughter, but feels hopeless under the circumstances, and does not herself fully \n13  understand much of what is happening.  It was only after Ms. L. was detained more \n14  than 3 months that she finally obtained legal counsel in her immigration \n15  proceeding.  \n16  14.  The reason why Ms. L. and S.S. were separated was not a finding (or \n17  even any accusation) that Ms. L. was abusing or neglecting S.S., or that she is an \n18  unfit parent. \n19  15.  Ms. L. and her daughter have been separated now for nearly 4 months.  \n20  Seven-year-old S.S. sits all alone in a Chicago facility, frightened and traumatized, \n21  crying for her mother and not knowing when she will see her again.  \n22  16.  Ms. L. brings this action to reunite with her daughter. There are \n23  shelters that house African asylum-seekers and their children while they await the \n24  final adjudication of their asylum cases. If, however, the government feels \n25  compelled to continue detaining Ms. L. and S.S., it must at a minimum detain \n26  them together in one of its immigration family detention centers.  \n27 \n28 \n2 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 1   Filed 02/26/18   PageID.5   Page 5 of 12\n \n \n \n \n1    17.  The Due Process Cl ause of the Fifth Amendment does not permit the \n \n2    government to forcibly take a 7-year-old child from her mother, without \n \n3    justification or even a hearing. \n \n4    JURISDICTION \n \n5    18.  This case arises under the Fifth Amendment to the United States \n \n6    Constitution, federal asylum statutes, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The \n \n7    court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction); 28 \n \n8    U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas jurisdiction); and Art. I., § 9, Cl. 2 of the United States \n \n9    Constitution (“Suspension Clause”). Plaintiff and her daughter are in custody for \n \n10  purposes of habeas jurisdiction.   \n11  VENUE \n12  19.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because Ms. L. is detained \n13  within this District and a substantial portion of the relevant facts occurred within \n14  this District. \n15  PARTIES \n16  20.  Petitioner Ms. L. is a 39-year-old citizen of the Democratic Republic \n17  of the Congo (the “Congo” or “DRC”).  She is the mother of S.S. \n18  21.  Respondent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) is \n19  the sub-agency of DHS that is responsible for carrying out removal orders and \n20  operates and oversees the Otay Mesa detention facility. \n21  22.  Respondent U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has \n22  responsibility for enforcing the immigration laws of the United States. \n23  23.  Respondent U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) is the sub-\n24  agency of DHS that is responsible for the initial processing and detention of \n25  noncitizens who are apprehended near the U.S. border. \n26  24.  Respondent U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is \n27  the sub-agency of DHS that, through its Asylum Officers, conducts interviews of \n28 \n3 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 1   Filed 02/26/18   PageID.6   Page 6 of 12\n \n \n \n \n1    certain individuals apprehended  at the border to determine whether they have a \n \n2    credible fear of persecution and should be permitted to apply for asylum. \n \n3    25.  Respondent U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is \n \n4    a department of the executive branch of the U.S. government. \n \n5    26.  Respondent Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) is a component \n \n6    of HHS which provides care of and placement for unaccompanied noncitizen \n \n7    children. \n \n8    27.  Respondent Thomas Homan is sued in his official capacity as the \n \n9    Director of ICE, and is a legal custodian of Petitioner. \n \n10  28.  Respondent Greg Archambea ult is sued in his official capacity as the \n11  ICE San Diego Field Office Director, and is a legal custodian of Petitioner. \n12  29.  Respondent Joseph Greene is sued in his official capacity as the ICE \n13  San Diego Assistant Field Office Director for the Otay Mesa Detention Center, and \n14  is a legal custodian of Petitioner. \n15  30.  Respondent Kirstjen Nielsen, is sued in her official capacity as the \n16  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.  In this capacity, she directs \n17  each of the component agencies within DHS: ICE, USCIS, and CBP.  As a result, \n18  Respondent Nielsen has responsibility for the administration of the immigration \n19  laws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103, is empowered to grant asylum or other relief, and \n20  is a legal custodian of the Petitioner. \n21  31.  Respondent Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III is sued in his official \n22  capacity as the Attorney General of the United States. In this capacity, he has \n23  responsibility for the administration of the immigration laws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § \n24  1103, oversees the Executive Office of Immigration Review, is empowered to grant \n25  asylum or other relief, and is a legal custodian of the Petitioner. \n26  32.  Respondent L. Francis Cissna is sued in his official capacity as the \n27  Director of USCIS. \n28 \n4 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 1   Filed 02/26/18   PageID.7   Page 7 of 12\n \n \n \n \n1    33.  Respondent Kevin K  . McAleenan is sued in his official capacity as the \n \n2    Acting Commissioner of CBP. \n \n3    34.  Respondent Pete Flores is sued in his official capacity as the San \n \n4    Diego Field Director of CBP. \n \n5    35.

Respondent Alex Azar is sued in his official capacity as the Secretary \n \n8    of the Department of Health and Human Services. \n \n9    37.  Respondent Scott Lloyd is sued in his official capacity as the Director \n \n10  of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.   \n11  FACTS \n12  38.  Ms. L. and her daughter S.S. are seeking asylum in the United States.  \n13  39.  Ms. L. is Catholic and sought shelter in a church until she was able to \n14  escape the Congo with S.S. \n15  40.  Upon reaching the United States, Ms. L. and S.S. presented themselves \n16  at the San Ysidro, California Port of Entry on November 1, 2017. Although their \n17  native language is Lingala, they were able to communicate to the border guards that \n18  they sought asylum.   \n19  41.  Based on her expression of a fear of returning to the Congo, Ms. L. \n20  was referred for an initial screening before an asylum officer, called a “credible fear \n21  interview.”   She passed the credible fear screening but has been detained for nearly \n22  4 months in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in the San Diego area.   \n23  42.  On or about November 5, immigration officials separated 7-year-old \n24  S.S. from her mother and sent S.S. to Chicago, to be housed in a facility under the \n25  auspices of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).  \n26  43.  When S.S. was taken away from her mother, she was screaming and \n27  crying, pleading with guards not to take her away from her mother. \n28 \n5 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 1   Filed 02/26/18   PageID.8   Page 8 of 12\n \n \n \n \n1    44.  Ms. L. and her daug hter have been separated now for nearly four \n \n2    months. Seven-year-old S.S. is alone in a facility in Chicago. \n \n3    45.  Ms. L. has spoken to her daughter approximately 6 times by phone and \n \n4    is terrified she will never see her daughter again.  \n \n5    46.  S.S. is scared and misses her mother, and wants to be reunited with her \n \n6    as soon as possible. Each time S.S. is able to speak with her mother on the phone, \n \n7    she is crying. In December, S.S. turned 7 and spent her birthday without her \n \n8    mother. \n \n9    47.  There is overwhelming medical evidence that the separation of a \n \n10  young child from her parent will have a de vastating negative impact on the child’s \n11  well-being, especially where there are other traumatic factors at work, and that this \n12  damage can be permanent.  \n13  48.  The American Association of Pediatrics has recently denounced the \n14  Administration’s practice of separating immigrant children from their parents, \n15  noting that: “The psychological distress, anxiety, and depression associated with \n16  separation from a parent would follow the children well after the immediate period \n17  of separation—even after the eventual reunification with a parent or other family.” \n18  49.  Every day that S.S. is separated from her mother causes her greater \n19  emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent \n20  emotional trauma.  \n21  50.  Ms. L. is distraught and depressed because of the separation from her \n22  daughter. She is not eating, has lost weight, is not sleeping due to worry and \n23  nightmares. \n24  51.  The government has no legitimate interest in separating Ms. L. and her \n25  child. \n26  52.  There has been no evidence, or even accusation, that S.S. was abused \n27  or neglected by Ms. L. \n28 \n6 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 1   Filed 02/26/18   PageID.9   Page 9 of 12\n \n \n \n \n1    53.  There is no evidenc e that Ms. L. is an unfit parent or that she is not \n \n2    acting in the best interests of her child.  \n \n3    54.  Because she passed her credible fear interview, Ms. L. is eligible for \n \n4    release from detention on parole, which would enable her to be reunited with her \n \n5    daughter.    However, the San Diego Field Office has a policy and practice of \n \n6    refusing to grant parole to detained asylum seekers such as Ms. L., notwithstanding \n \n7    an ICE Parole Directive that specifically favors their release. \n \n8    55.  Under current DHS practice, numerous other asylum-seeking parents \n \n9    and their young children are being separated upon arrival in the United States.  \n \n10  56.   Prior Administrations detain ed families, but they did not have a \n11  practice of forcibly separating fit parents from their young children.  \n12  57.  According to reports, the government may soon adopt a formal \n13  national policy of separating parents from their children.    \n14  58.  If S.S. and her mother are both released from detention, there are non-\n15  governmental shelters that specialize in housing and caring for African asylum \n16  seekers. \n17  59.  If the government refuses to release them, there are government-\n18  operated family detention centers where S.S. and her mother can be housed \n19  together. \n20  CAUSES OF ACTION \n21  COUNT I \n22  (Violation of Due Process) \n23  60.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n24  fully set forth herein. \n25  61.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all \n26  “persons” on United States soil and thus applies to Ms. L. and her daughter. \n27  62.   S.S. and her mother have a liberty interest under the Due Process \n28  Clause in remaining together as a family. \n7 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 1   Filed 02/26/18   PageID.10   Page 10 of 12\n \n \n \n \n1    63.  The separation of S. S. and her mother violates substantive due process \n \n2    because it furthers no legitimate purpose, not to mention a compelling \n \n3    governmental interest. \n \n4    64.  The separation of S.S. and her mother also violates procedural due \n \n5    process because it was undertaken without any hearing.  \n \n6    COUNT II \n \n7    (Violation of Asylum Statute) \n \n8    65.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n \n9    fully set forth herein. \n \n10  66.  Under United States law, non citizens with a well-founded fear of \n11  persecution shall have the opportunity to obtain asylum in the United States.  8 \n12  U.S.C. § 1158. \n13  67.  Defendants’ separation of Ms. L. from her daughter violates federal \n14  asylum law because it impedes their ability to pursue their asylum claims. \n15  COUNT III \n16  (Administrative Procedure Act—Arbitrary and Capricious Practice) \n17  68.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n18  fully set forth herein.  \n19  69.  The APA prohibits agency action that is arbitrary and capricious. \n20  70.  Defendants’ separation of Ms. L. from her daughter without a \n21  legitimate justification is arbitrary and capricious and accordingly violates the APA. \n22  5 U.S.C. § 706.    \n23  COUNT IV \n(Administrative Procedure Act—Failure to Follow \n24 \nand Unlawful Rescission of the ICE Parole Directive) \n25 \n71.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n26 \nfully set forth herein.  \n27 \n72.  Defendants have detained Ms. L. without considering her for release \n28 \non parole as required by ICE’s own Parole Directive  \n8 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 1   Filed 02/26/18   PageID.11   Page 11 of 12\n \n \n \n \n1    73.  The San Diego Field  Office has de facto rescinded the Parole Directive \n \n2    at the Otay Mesa Detention Facility without providing any reasoned justification—\n \n3    or, indeed, any justification at all—for such rescission. \n \n4    74.  If Ms. L. were paroled, her daughter could be released to her. \n \n5    75.

The  Motion  is  GRANTED,  the  Settlement  Agreement  is \n25  APPROVED, the Ms. L. Settlement Class is CERTIFIED and Plaintiffs’ claims \n26  are  hereby  DISMISSED  WITH  PREJUDICE,  subject  to  the  terms  of  the \n27  Settlement Agreement and with retention of jurisdiction as set forth in this Order. \n28 \n        \n \n\n \n1 \n2.  The  Court  finds  that  the  Settlement  Agreement  is  a  compromise \n2 \nreached  by  the  parties  as  a  result  of  arms-length  negotiations.  The  Settlement \n3 \nAgreement benefits the Ms. L. Settlement Class and was not the result of collusion \n4 \nbetween the parties. The Ms. L. Settlement Class has received notice of the terms of \n5 \nthe Settlement Agreement that complied with the requirements of Federal Rule of \n6 \nCivil Procedure 23(e)(1), and no Ms. L. Settlement Class member has objected to \n7  the Settlement Agreement. \n8  3.  The Court therefore finds that approval is appropriate and hereby grants \n9  approval of the Settlement Agreement, as amended. Pursuant to Paragraph VII.A of \n10  the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Agreement is hereby incorporated into the \n11  terms of this Order. This Order constitutes the final judgment of the Court with \n12  regard to this Action, and Plaintiffs’ claims are hereby dismissed with prejudice, \n13  except that the Court retains jurisdiction for specified purposes subject to the terms \n14  of  the  Settlement  Agreement,  including  retaining  jurisdiction  to  enforce  the \n15  Settlement  Agreement’s  terms  and  to  review  any  future  modifications  to  the \n16  Settlement Agreement that the parties might enter into upon mutual agreement. \n17  4.  Notwithstanding the terms of Paragraph 3, the Court’s May 19, 2023 \n18  Order, ECF No. 689, shall remain in place for 90 days following issuance of this \nOrder. \n19 \n5.  This  Order  and  all  obligations  of  the  parties  under  the  Settlement \n20 \nAgreement will terminate on the Termination Date of the Settlement Agreement, \n21 \nexcept that: \n22 \na.  Defendants’ obligations under Section V (Future Separations) will \n23 \nterminate on the Termination Date – Future Separations; and \n24 \nb.  Defendants will continue to provide Behavioral Health Services as \n25 \ndescribed in Section IV.B.2.a. above for one year following the \n26 \nTermination Date. \n27 \n28 \n    - 2 -    \n \n\n \n1 \n6.  From the Effective Date until the Termination Date, the Court will \n2 \nretain jurisdiction over the Action only for the purpose of enforcing the terms of the \n3 \nSettlement Agreement, except that the Court shall retain jurisdiction over Section V \n4 \n(Future Separations) until the “Termination Date – Future Separations,” and shall \n5 \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes regarding the provision of Behavioral Health \n6 \nServices as described in Section IV.B.2.a. for one year following the Termination \n7  Date; and shall retain jurisdiction to resolve disputes concerning any applications for \n8  relief filed pursuant to this Settlement Agreement that remain pending as of the \n9  Termination Date. \n10  7.  For purposes of the Settlement Agreement, the Court further finds that \n11  the requirements for a class action are met, and hereby defines the Ms. L. Settlement \n12  Class set forth in the parties’ Settlement Agreement. Specifically: \n13  a.  The  Court  finds  that  certification  is  warranted  under  the \n14  requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) because: (1) \n15  the  members  of  the  proposed  Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class  are  so \n16  numerous that joinder is impracticable; (2) there are issues of law \n17  and fact common to the proposed Ms. L. Settlement Class; (3) the \n18  claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Ms. L. \nSettlement Class members; and (4) the proposed Class Counsel will \n19 \nfairly and adequately represent the interests of the Ms. L. Settlement \n20 \nClass members. \n21 \nb.  The Court also finds that certification of the Ms. L. Settlement Class \n22 \nis  warranted  under  the  requirements  of  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \n23 \nProcedure 23(b)(2) because Defendants are alleged to have acted or \n24 \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the proposed Ms. \n25 \nL. Settlement Class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n26 \n27 \n28 \n    - 3 -    \n \n\n \n1 \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the Ms. L. Settlement \n2 \nClass as a whole. \n3 \n8.  The requirements of Rule 23(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n4 \nare met, and the Court hereby confirms the appointment of the ACLU Immigrants’ \n5 \nRights Project as counsel for the Ms. L. Settlement Class. \n6 \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n7 \nDated:  December 11, 2023 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n \n11   \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n    - 4 -    \n ",

This motion is made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2412(a)(1), (b), and (d)(1)(A) and \n7 \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 23 and 54(d). \n8  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court award attorneys’ fees1 as follows: \n9 \n•  For the Ms. L. Plaintiffs, a total award of $6,109,934.14, with $4,000,000 \n10 \nto go to the ACLU and $2,109,934.14 to go to the Steering Committee \n11 \norganizations; \n12 \n•  For the Dora Plaintiffs, a total award of $301,729.93. \n13 \nThis Motion is based on this Notice of Motion, the attached brief, the \n14 \nconcurrently filed declarations, and all other pleadings and papers on file in this action \n15 \nand such other argument or evidence that the Court may consider. Defendants have \n16 \nstated that they do not oppose Plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees. \n17 \nINTRODUCTION \n18 \nPlaintiffs respectfully seek approval of their settlement with Defendants \n19 \nconcerning fees and costs. This Motion addresses the fees and expenses award for \n20 \nboth the Ms. L. Plaintiffs, including the Steering Committee, as well as the Dora \n21 \nPlaintiffs, whose case was filed separately but later incorporated into this case.   \n22 \nDefendants have agreed to pay, and Plaintiffs have agreed to accept, subject to \n23 \nthe Court’s approval, the following amounts in satisfaction of Plaintiffs’ claims for \n24 \n \n25 \n1 Plaintiffs understand that absent an applicable exception, the fee award here is \n26  subject to being offset by debts owed by named Plaintiffs to any state or federal \nagency. Plaintiffs are aware of at least one debt owed by a class representative and \n27 \nunderstand that the fee award will be offset by the amount of that debt before the fee \n28  award is paid to class counsel.  \n1 \n    18cv00428 \n51552865.2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 752   Filed 09/24/24   PageID.10662   Page 3 of 14\n   \n1  costs, attorneys’ fees, and litigation expenses: \n2  •  For the Ms. L. Plaintiffs, a total award of $6,109,934.14, with $4,000,000 \n3  to go to the ACLU and $2,109,934.14 to go to the Steering Committee \n4  organizations; \n5  •  For the Dora Plaintiffs, a total award of $301,729.93. \n6 \nPursuant to Rule 23(h) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffs \n7 \nrespectfully move for the Court’s approval of this settlement regarding fees and costs \n8 \n(the “Fees Settlement Agreement”). See Exhibit A. \n9 \nBACKGROUND \n10 \nThe history of this case is set forth in numerous orders and filings in this case, \n11 \nincluding in the briefs filed in connection with the parties’ request for preliminary and \n12 \nfinal approval of the Ms. L. Settlement Agreement, which this Motion will hereinafter \n13 \nrefer to as “the Merits Settlement.” See, e.g., Dkt. 711, 715, 716, 721. This description \n14 \nwill focus on updates concerning the parties’ fees negotiations. \n15 \nThe Merits Settlement provides that Defendants will pay Plaintiffs “reasonable \n16 \nfees and other expenses . . . in accordance with the Equal Justice to Access Act.”  \n17 \nMerits Settlement, Section VIII. Defendants “reserve[d] their right to raise defenses \n18 \nrelated to the reasonableness” of fees and expenses, “but otherwise waive[d] their \n19 \navailable defenses” under EAJA.   \n20 \nThis Court also enlisted the aid of Magistrate Judge Goddard in facilitating the \n21 \nparties’ settlement discussions. On March 13, 2024, Judge Goddard held a status \n22 \nconference concerning the parties’ negotiations, and issued various deadlines for the \n23 \nparties to engage in and complete their negotiations. See, e.g., Dkt. 740. \n24 \nThe Ms. L Plaintiffs served their fee demand on Defendants on April 10, 2024, \n25 \nafter receiving extensions from this Court. See Dkt. 735. On April 29, 2024, the \n26 \nACLU and Steering Committee provided their billing and costs records and reports. \n27 \nSee Dkt. 742. Thereafter, the parties engaged in negotiations concerning Plaintiffs’ fee \n28 \n2 \n    18cv00428 \n51552865.2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 752   Filed 09/24/24   PageID.10663   Page 4 of 14\n   \n1  demand, and reached agreement in principle on July 1, 2024.   \n2  In February 2024, the Dora Plaintiffs submitted a fee proposal to Defendants \n3  based on the documented hours worked, after review for billing judgment. The Dora \n4  Plaintiffs also provided detailed records for Defendants’ review. After negotiations, \n5  the Dora Plaintiffs and Defendants reached agreement in principle on June 6, 2024. \n6 \nThe parties are now filing this Motion, after receiving extensions to finalize the \n7 \nAgreement. See Dkts. 747, 749.  \n8 \nARGUMENT \n9 \nI.  The Court Should Grant Preliminary Approval of the Proposed \n10 \nSettlement for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. \n11 \n“In a certified class action, the court may award reasonable attorneys’ fees and \n12 \nnontaxable costs that are authorized by law or by the parties’ agreement.” Fed. R. Civ. \n13 \nP. 23(h). Because the parties have agreed to an attorneys’ fee and costs award, the \n14 \nCourt’s task is to determine whether the agreed-upon amount is reasonable, using the \n15 \nfees potentially awardable under the relevant fee-shifting statute or statutes as a \n16 \nbenchmark. See Comm’r, INS v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 161 (1990) (“[O]nce a private \n17 \nlitigant has met the multiple conditions for eligibility for EAJA fees, the district \n18 \ncourt’s task of determining what fee is reasonable is essentially the same as that \n19 \ndescribed in Hensley.”). The Ms. L and Dora Plaintiffs are eligible for attorneys’ fees \n20 \nand expenses pursuant to the EAJA as a prevailing party.  28 U.S.C. § 2412. \n21 \nA. The Ms. L Plaintiffs and Steering Committee \n22 \nThe Ms. L. Plaintiffs seek a total award of $6,109,934.14, with $4,000,000 for \n23 \nthe ACLU and $2,109,934.14 for the Steering Committee organizations. \n24 \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Requested Fee Award is Reasonable. \n25 \nHere, the agreed upon amounts in fees and expenses is reasonable when \n26 \ncompared to a lodestar. “The lodestar method is most appropriate where the relief \n27 \nsought is primarily injunctive in nature, and a fee-shifting statute authorizes the award \n28 \n3 \n    18cv00428 \n51552865.2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 752   Filed 09/24/24   PageID.10664   Page 5 of 14\n   \n1  of fees to ensure compensation for counsel undertaking socially beneficial litigation.” \n2  Laguna v. Coverall N. Am., Inc., 753 F.3d 918, 924 (9th Cir. 2014), vacated on other \n3  grounds, 772 F.3d 608 (9th Cir. 2014) (citation and quotation marks omitted). A \n4  lodestar figure is “presumptively reasonable.” Cunningham v. Cty. of Los Angeles, \n5  879 F.2d 481, 488 (9th Cir. 1988) (citation omitted). Under the Supreme Court’s \n6 \ndecision in Hensley v. Eckerhart, “[t]he most useful starting point for determining the \n7 \namount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the \n8 \nlitigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.” 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983).  The \n9 \ndistrict court may adjust that amount based on other factors, “including the important \n10 \nfactor of the results obtained.” Id. at 434 (quotation marks omitted). \n11 \nHere, the settlement amount is a fraction of the fees and costs actually incurred, \n12 \nwhich, under conservative calculations, Plaintiffs and the Steering Committee \n13 \nestimate to be approximately $8.7 million. The Ms. L Plaintiffs and Steering \n14 \nCommittee have agreed to accept less than 70% of this lodestar as part of Settlement. \n15 \nThis figure is reasonable in light of the complexity of this litigation, the novelty \n16 \nof the issues presented, the results obtained, and the skill and experience of the \n17 \nattorneys. As the Court knows, this litigation was unusually intense, as it involved one \n18 \nof the prior Administration’s most controversial immigration policies, which \n19 \ndominated national news for lengthy periods of time. Starting from the case’s filing in \n20 \nFebruary 2018, the parties engaged in fast-paced and complex litigation concerning \n21 \nMs. L’s individual request for relief, see, e.g., Dkt. 21, Plaintiffs’ motions for \n22 \nclasswide preliminary injunction, and Defendants’ motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Dkts. \n23 \n35, 48, 56, 78, 81. See Declaration of Stephen B. Kang (“Kang Decl.”), ¶5.  \n24 \nAfter this Court issued a classwide preliminary injunction in late June 2018, the \n25 \nparties began intense litigation concerning the enforcement of the injunction. The \n26 \nCourt held multiple status conferences and hearings for months, accompanied by \n27 \nnumerous status reports. These reports addressed a broad spectrum of issues, \n28 \n4 \n    18cv00428 \n51552865.2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 752   Filed 09/24/24   PageID.10665   Page 6 of 14\n   \n1  including the identification and reunification of separated parents, identifying and \n2  tracking Class Members’ locations, and the procedures governing the release of \n3  children to Class Members. See, e.g., Dkts. 98, 99, 104, 146, 171, 189.   \n4  This pace continued through 2018 and much of 2019. Among other things, \n5  Plaintiffs filed an emergency classwide motion for a temporary restraining order \n6 \nenjoining the removal of Class Members, see, e.g., Dkt. 116, litigated issues \n7 \nconcerning excluded class members, see, e.g., Dkt. 221, and conferred numerous \n8 \ntimes concerning identification and outreach to the Class. Plaintiffs also moved to \n9 \nexpand the Class to include parents separated during earlier phases of the prior \n10 \nAdministration, which resulted in intensive efforts to identify expanded Class \n11 \nmembers. See, e.g., Dkts. 344, 386, 397. The parties also engaged in motion practice \n12 \nconcerning, inter alia, returning parents who were unlawfully deported to the United \n13 \nStates, e.g., Dkt. 418, and exclusions from the Class based on criminal history, \n14 \nparentage, and other reasons, e.g., Dkt. 439.   \n15 \nConcurrently, in August 2018 Plaintiffs formed (with the Court’s endorsement) \n16 \nthe Steering Committee, comprised of the law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Garrison \n17 \nLLP, Justice in Motion, Kids in Need of Defense, and the Women’s Refugee \n18 \nCommission. See Dkt. 175 at 2; Dkt. 181 at 7-8; Kang Decl., ¶¶7-10. The Steering \n19 \nCommittee began identifying, locating, and reaching out to Class Members to inform \n20 \nthem of, and help them exercise, their reunification rights. This work was \n21 \nextraordinarily difficult, as numerous Class Members were deported to various \n22 \ncountries with no effort to reunify them with their families or maintain accurate \n23 \ninformation. The Steering Committee sent human rights defenders to numerous and \n24 \nremote locations in Central America and other countries to find separated family \n25 \nmembers; reviewed voluminous and complex government records to find usable \n26 \ncontact information; employed investigation tools to locate parents; and counseled \n27 \nfamily members. These efforts continued from August 2018 through December 2023, \n28 \n5 \n    18cv00428 \n51552865.2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 752   Filed 09/24/24   PageID.10666   Page 7 of 14\n   \n1  when the Court granted final approval of the Merits Settlement. \n2  Starting in early 2021, the parties engaged in complex settlement negotiations \n3  for almost three years, which involved numerous government agencies and \n4  stakeholder organizations, and addressed many contested issues and difficult areas of \n5  law. See Dkt. 579. Those negotiations resulted in a comprehensive Merits Settlement \n6 \nthat provided a diverse array of significant benefits to the Class. In 2021, Defendants \n7 \nalso established the Family Reunification Task Force, see Dkt. 573, which began \n8 \nefforts to reunify separated class members in the United States pursuant to \n9 \nhumanitarian parole processes. The implementation of that process became part of the \n10 \nparties’ settlement negotiations in this case, and Plaintiffs and the Steering Committee \n11 \nplayed key roles in ensuring the effectiveness of these parole processes. \n12 \nThe ACLU’s attorneys are all entitled to enhanced rates under EAJA.  Because \n13 \nACLU IRP’s lawyers have unique expertise in handling complex federal litigation \n14 \ninvolving immigration issues, particularly involving children and families, they are \n15 \nentitled to enhanced rates under EAJA. See Nadarajah v. Holder, 569 F.3d 906, 912 \n16 \n(9th Cir. 2009); Kang Decl., ¶¶11-50.   \n17 \nFinally, the amount of the Ms. L Plaintiffs’ lodestar excluded multiple areas of \n18 \nwork. For example, Plaintiffs did not request fees for work contributed by certain \n19 \njunior attorneys and paralegals at various points. For its part, the Steering Committee \n20 \nis not seeking enhanced rates, and is not seeking compensation for periods of time in \n21 \n2021-22 when they conducted outreach efforts pursuant to certain government \n22 \ncontracts. Kang Decl., ¶¶6, 10. \n23 \n2.  Plaintiff’s Costs Are Reasonable \n24 \nNontaxable costs may also be awarded to class counsel under Rule 23(h).  See \n25 \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(h). Plaintiffs’ demand included a total of $957,909.65, which \n26 \nincludes both the ACLU and the Steering Committee’s costs. That amount is fair and \n27 \nreasonable. The large majority of this figure was spent on outreach and identifying \n28 \n6 \n    18cv00428 \n51552865.2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 752   Filed 09/24/24   PageID.10667   Page 8 of 14\n   \n1  Class Members, such as funding human rights defenders and other searches in Central \n2  America to look for hundreds of families (often in remote locations), transportation \n3  and travel costs for defenders and families, and interpretation and translation services. \n4  The remaining costs were comprised of routine litigation expenditures, such as court \n5  fees and travel expenses for the numerous court appearances in this case, particularly \n6 \nduring the litigation-heavy 2018-19 period. Kang Decl., ¶3. Like the fees discussed \n7 \nabove, this amount only includes costs spent through December 11, 2023. \n8 \n3.  The Fees Agreement Is the Product of Extended Arms-Length \n9 \nNegotiations Between Well-Informed and Experienced Counsel. \n10 \nThe Settlement is the product of extensive negotiation between counsel for both \n11 \nparties. The parties exchanged of offers and counteroffers over a period of months, \n12 \nand also appeared at a status conference before Magistrate Judge Goddard. Further, \n13 \nthe award of fees and costs will not affect the relief the Merits Settlement affords an \n14 \nindividual class member.  \n15 \nCounsel for the parties also have deep experience with similar actions, which \n16 \nfurther supports preliminary approval of the Fees Settlement. Ms. L Plaintiffs’ counsel \n17 \nhas substantial experience with complex immigration litigation and class/civil rights \n18 \nactions, and has unique expertise in working with this Class in particular. Defendants’ \n19 \nlawyers are tasked specifically with defending lawsuits raising constitutional and \n20 \nstatutory claims related to noncitizens in government custody. See 28 C.F.R. § \n21 \n0.45(k). The opinion of the parties’ experienced counsel regarding the Fees \n22 \nSettlement’s fairness “provides further support for approval” of this Agreement. Chan \n23 \nv. Sutter Health Sacramento, LA CV15-02004 JAK (AGRx), 2017 WL 819903, at *5 \n24 \n(C.D. Cal. Feb. 14, 2017).   \n25 \nMoreover, the Ninth Circuit has “made clear that ‘since the proper amount of \n26 \nfees is often open to dispute and the parties are compromising precisely to avoid \n27 \nlitigation, the court need not inquire into the reasonableness of the fees at even the \n28 \n7 \n    18cv00428 \n51552865.2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 752   Filed 09/24/24   PageID.10668   Page 9 of 14\n   \n1  high end with precisely the same level of scrutiny as when the fee amount is \n2  litigated.’” Laguna, 753 F.3d at 922 (citation and quotation omitted). \n3    B. The Dora Plaintiffs. \n4  For the reasons set forth below, the Dora Plaintiffs request and are entitled \n5  under the EAJA to reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses for a total of $301,729.93.  \n6 \n1.  The Dora Plaintiffs’ Requested Award is Reasonable. \n7 \nThe requested attorney fees of $299,032.02 are reasonable. “[R]easonable \n8 \nattorney fees” are available to eligible parties under the EAJA.  28 U.S.C. § \n9 \n2412(d)(2)(A). Fee-shifting statutes like the EAJA compensate for time that is \n10 \n“reasonably expended on the litigation.”  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433.  The attached \n11 \nDeclaration supports the total amount of reasonable time counsel spent working on the \n12 \ncase at the applicable rates. See Declaration of Wilson G. Barmeyer. The fee request \n13 \nincludes work performed from the initiation of the Dora litigation in 2018 through the \n14 \nglobal Ms. L settlement in late 2023.   \n15 \nAlthough Dora counsel were representing a number of families in \n16 \nadministrative proceedings before August 2018, which led directly to the Dora \n17 \nlitigation, Dora counsel are not requesting EAJA fees for that work and are instead \n18 \nseeking fees beginning with work performed in connection with filing the litigation in \n19 \n2018. Dora counsel’s request includes fees for litigating the case through class action \n20 \nsettlement in 2018, the subsequent filing of an amended complaint in the Ms. L case \n21 \n(adding Dora claims as part of Ms. L), the process for seeking approval of the 2018 \n22 \nclass action settlement, and time worked on implementation of the Dora settlement, \n23 \nwhich included motion practice to enforce the settlement.   \n24 \nFor rates, Dora counsel is requesting fees under the EAJA statutory rates \n25 \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2412 (d)(2)(A), calculated according to the formula set out in \n26 \nThangaraja v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 870, 876–77 (9th Cir. 2005), which makes the fee \n27 \nrequest much lower than a lodestar rate. An award of attorneys’ fees is typically \n28 \n8 \n    18cv00428 \n51552865.2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 752   Filed 09/24/24   PageID.10669   Page 10 of 14\n   \n1  determined by the lodestar method, which is calculated by multiplying the number of \n2  hours reasonably expended by a reasonable hourly rate.  Ferland v. Conrad Credit \n3  Corp., 244 F.3d 1145, 1149 n.4 (9th Cir. 2001). This may be adjusted based upon \n4  other factors, including the “results obtained.” See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434. There is \n5  a “strong presumption” that the lodestar amount represents a reasonable fee. Gates v. \n6 \nDeukmejian, 987 F.2d 1392, 1397 (9th Cir. 1992). Dora counsel is limiting its request \n7 \nto the EAJA rates of approximately $200/hour notwithstanding the complexity of the \n8 \nwork performed in this case. Using the EAJA rates results in a very substantial \n9 \nreduction from the fees that could be sought under any other rate scale. Given the \n10 \nsignificant and complex legal and factual issues and the number of parties and class \n11 \nmembers, with litigation spanning five years and multiple jurisdiction, and the results \n12 \nobtained in the litigation, the attorney’s fees and expenses requested in this settlement \n13 \nare reasonable as compared to the potential lodestar. The request of $299,032.02 in \n14 \nfees is less than 1/3 of the lodestar, if the fee request were based on market rates.    \n15 \nDora counsel have also exercised billing judgment to review the time entries \n16 \nand remove hours that counsel believed were unsupported, i.e., under the EAJA \n17 \ncounsel should exclude hours that are “excessive, redundant, or otherwise \n18 \nunnecessary,” or were occurrences of block billing and vague time entries. Hensley, \n19 \n461 U.S. at 434. Dora counsel exercised billing judgment at several stages, including \n20 \nthrough a review and reduction of certain time entries and by agreeing to further such \n21 \nreductions in discussions with Defendants. Accordingly, the request for attorney’s fees \n22 \nfrom 2018–2023 for 1627.5 hours at $299,032.02 is reasonable. \n23 \nDora plaintiffs also incurred reasonable expenses in the amount of $2,697.91 \n24 \nand are entitled to these expenses under the EAJA. The expenses cover filing fees, \n25 \ntravel to a court hearing, and costs of printing for communications to class members.  \n26 \nII.  The Court Should Approve the Parties’ Proposed Notice Plan and \n27 \nSet a Hearing for Final Approval of the Fees Settlement. \n28 \n9 \n    18cv00428 \n51552865.2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 752   Filed 09/24/24   PageID.10670   Page 11 of 14\n   \n1  Under Rule 23(e)(1), the Court should “direct notice in a reasonable manner to \n2  all class members who would be bound” by the proposed settlement. Notice is \n3  satisfactory if it “generally describes the terms of the settlement in sufficient detail to \n4  alert those with adverse viewpoints to investigate and come forward and be heard.” \n5  Churchill Vill. v. Gen. Elec., 361 F.3d 566, 575 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation and quotation \n6 \nmarks omitted). \n7 \nThe Notice Plan here easily fulfills these requirements. The Fees Notice \n8 \n(attached here as Exhibit B) will be distributed by posting on the websites of \n9 \nDefendants and the ACLU within ten days of the Court’s preliminary approval order; \n10 \ndistribution via a broad network of nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups who \n11 \neach work with dozens (if not hundreds) of Class Members; and distribution to \n12 \nPlaintiffs’ extensive list of lawyers who represent Class Members. The Fees Notice \n13 \nwill be translated to and distributed in Spanish, as well as English.   \n14 \nThe Fees Notice will include summary information regarding the Fees \n15 \nAgreement, as well as links to websites containing the Fee Agreement’s full terms. \n16 \n“Courts have routinely held that notice by publication in a periodical, on a website, or \n17 \neven at an appropriate physical location is sufficient to satisfy due process.” Briseno v. \n18 \nConAgra Foods, Inc., 844 F.3d 1121, 1129 (9th Cir. 2017).  \n19 \nThe parties also propose that the Court set the following deadlines for approval \n20 \nof the Fees Agreement: \n21 \n•  Deadline for objections/responses to Fees Agreement: 30 days after Court \n22 \ngrants preliminary approval \n23 \n•  Deadline for the parties to submit any replies in support of approval of the Fees \n24 \nAgreement and for parties to file motion for final approval: 35 days after Court \n25 \ngrants preliminary approval \n26 \n•  Hearing on final approval of Fees Agreement: Earliest practicable date after \n27 \nbriefing is complete \n28 \n10 \n    18cv00428 \n51552865.2 \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 752   Filed 09/24/24   PageID.10671   Page 12 of 14\n   \n1  CONCLUSION \n2    For these reasons, the Court should grant this motion.  \n3  DATED: September 24, 2024    Respectfully submitted, \n4   \n/s/ Lee Gelernt \n5 \nLee Gelernt* \n6 \nDaniel A.

      "text": "Case 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11418     Page\n1 of 19\n \n1   \n2   \n3   \n4   \n5   \n6   \n7   \n8  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n9  SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n10   \n11  Ms. L.; et al.,    Case No.:  18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n \n12  Petitioners-Plaintiffs, \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ \n13  v.  RENEWED MOTION TO ENFORCE \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n14  U.S Immigration and Customs \nREGARDING PROVISION OF \nEnforcement (“ICE”); et al., \n15  LEGAL SERVICES \nRespondents-Defendants. \n16 \n17 \n18    This  case  returns  to  the  Court  on  Plaintiffs’  renewed  motion  to  enforce  their \n19  Settlement Agreement with Defendants, specifically, the sections regarding the provision \n20  of legal services to Ms. L. Settlement Class Members and Qualifying Additional Family \n21  Members (“QAFM”).  Plaintiffs filed their initial motion on April 23, 2025, (ECF No. 754), \n22  after learning that Defendants were not going to renew their contract with Acacia Center \n23  for Justice, the independent contractor that had been providing legal services since April \n24  2024.  Because the Acacia contract had not yet expired, the Court found there was no \n25  breach and denied the motion.  (ECF No. 770.)  The Court also ordered the parties to meet \n26  and confer on the issues discussed during oral argument, and invited Plaintiffs to renew \n27  their motion if those issues could not be resolved.  Unfortunately, the issues were not \n28  resolved, and the present motion ensued.  Each side thoroughly briefed the issues and \n1 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11419     Page\n2 of 19\n \n1  submitted supporting evidence.  On June 4, 2025, the Court heard argument from counsel.  \n2  After full consideration of the parties’ arguments, the record, and the relevant case law, the \n3  Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion for the reasons set out below.   \n4  I. \n5  BACKGROUND \n6    This case stems from the first Trump Administration’s policy to deter migration from \n7  Mexico by separating migrant families after they crossed into the United States.  The policy \n8  resulted in the separation of thousands of parents from their minor children, many of whom \n9  remain separated to this day.  The policy caused lasting, excruciating  harm to these \n10  families, and gratuitously tore the sacred bond that existed between these parents and their \n11  children.   \n12    Shortly after taking office in January 2021, former President Biden established the \n13  Family Reunification Task Force, which was comprised of representatives from various \n14  federal agencies, including the Defendants in this case.  (ECF No. 711.)  Thereafter, in \n15  March 2021, the parties began negotiations to settle this case.  More than two years later, \n16  after  “extensive,  wide-ranging,  and  arms-length  negotiations”  involving  multiple \n17  government  agencies  and  consultations  with  numerous  stakeholders  and  advocates \n18  working with separated families and children, the parties settled the case.  (Id.)  The \n19  settlement provided three types of relief to Class members: (1) relief designed to reunify \n20  separated families and help them reestablish themselves after reunification, including \n21  parole  and  work  authorization,  (2)  a  process  for  handling  Class  members’  asylum \n22  applications, and (3) programs intended to facilitate legal help for Class members, in \n23  addition to outreach programs designed to contact Class members and inform them of their \n24  rights and reunification options.  (Id.)  The Court preliminarily approved the settlement on \n25  October 23, 2023, and ordered that notice of the settlement be provided to class members.  \n26  (ECF No. 717.)  Notice was delivered, no objections were received, and the Court granted \n27  final approval on December 12, 2023.  (ECF No. 727.)   \n28  / / / \n2 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11420     Page\n3 of 19\n \n1    The final settlement agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) is a painstaking, 46-page \n2  document that covers the topics set out above in specific detail.  (ECF No. 721-1.)  The \n3  provisions at issue here are found in Section IV.B.2.c of the Settlement Agreement, which \n4  governs  Defendants’  obligations  to  provide  Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class  Members  and \n5  QAFMs1 with certain immigration legal services.  (Id. at 10-13.)  Those services include \n6  “Legal Access Services for Reunified Families,” (id. at 10-11), a “Program to Place Cases \n7  with  Pro  Bono  Representatives,”  (id.  at  12),  and  “Assistance  Outside  EOIR[2] \n8  Proceedings.”  (Id. at 12-13.)   \n9    Under the “Legal Access Services” provision, EOIR was to provide certain services \n10  to Class members through its Immigration Court Helpdesk Program (“ICH”) “or a separate \n11  similar program (‘Program’)[.]”  (Id. at 10.)  EOIR opted not to use ICH and instead created \n12  “the  Legal  Access  Services  for  Reunified  Families  (‘LASRF’)  Program.”    (Decl.  of \n13  Stephanie Gorman in Supp. of Opp’n to Mot. ¶ 3, ECF No. 765-1.)  To carry out the LASRF \n14  Program’s  duties,  the  Department  of  Justice  issued  a  task  order  under  an  Indefinite \n15  Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (“IDIQ”) Contract it had with Acacia Center for Justice.  \n16  (Decl. of Sara Van Hofwegen in Supp. of Mot. to Enforce Settlement Agreement ¶¶ 3-4, \n17  Ex. A, ECF No. 762-1.)  The task order period was May 1, 2024 to April 30, 2025, and \n18  included a one-year extension option for the period May 1, 2025 to April 30, 2026.  (Id. ¶ \n19  4.)   \n20  Under  the  Statement  of  Work  issued  for  the  LASRF  program,  Acacia \nsubcontracted with nine regional service providers and a national pro bono \n21 \nprovider to provide legal services to Ms. L. Class Members and their Qualified \n22  Additional Family Members (“QAFM”), including individual counseling and \nconsultations, legal advice, pro se workshops, Friend of the Court Services, \n23 \nand pro bono placement and mentoring assistance with parole applications \n24 \n25   \n26 \n1  The Ms. L. Settlement Class is defined in Section II of the Settlement Agreement and is \n27  referred to in this Order as “Class members.”   \n2 EOIR stands for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is part of the \n28 \nDepartment of Justice.   \n3 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11421     Page\n4 of 19\n \n1  and  renewals,  applications  and  renewals  or  employment  authorization \ndocuments (EADs), or hearing preparation from the LASRF Program. \n2 \n \n3  (Id. ¶ 6.)  In addition to the regional service providers, Acacia also employed “[m]ore than \n4  20 full-time equivalent attorneys and support staff[.]”  (Third Supp. Decl. of Sara Van \n5  Hofwegen ¶ 3, ECF No. 783-7.)   \n6    “The LASRF task order provided a 90-day period to launch the LASRF program and \n7  launch services.”  (Id. ¶ 4.)  The Program launched on July 22, 2024, and from that date \n8  until April 30, 2025, Acacia delivered legal services to “nearly 1,200 Class members and \n9  QAFMs[.]”  (Id. ¶ 5.)  “Of these nearly 1200 participants, more than 70 class members and \n10  QAFMs were placed with pro bono attorneys for legal representation[.]”  (Id.)  \n11  Additionally,  for  these  nearly  1200  participants,  the  LASRF  network \nconducted more than 1600 individual consultations and more than 250 group \n12 \nservices.  As part of these services, the Acacia subcontractors gave parole \n13  advice  and  assistance  to  more  than  1100  individuals  and  provided \nemployment  authorization  information  and  support  to  more  than  925 \n14 \nindividuals.   \n15   \n16  (Id.)   \n17    Ms. Van Hofwegen estimates:  \n18  that Acacia received approximately 50 new referrals per month. … Many of \nthe referrals from [the International Organization for Migration, or IOM3] \n19 \nwere for individuals with urgent deadlines in their cases, often because they \n20  required assistance with re-parole or received requests for additional evidence \n(RFEs) in their initial or renewal parole applications.   \n21 \n \n22  (Id. ¶ 7.)  Acacia’s subcontractors also conducted outreach to Class members.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  \n23  After making contact, the subcontractors “would first schedule the class member for an \n24 \n25   \n26 \n3 In 2021, IOM was granted a federal contract to support the reunification of Ms. L. Class \n27  members.  (Third Supp. Decl. of Anilú Chadwick ¶ 2, ECF No. 783-6.)  IOM does not have \npermission to assist Class members with re-parole or requests for evidence.  (Id. ¶ 3; Third \n28 \nSupp. Decl. of Sara Van Hofwegen ¶ 7, ECF No. 783-7.)     \n4 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11422     Page\n5 of 19\n \n1  individual consultation:  a one-on-one appointment during which the subcontractor would \n2  conduct a legal screening of the participant to fully understand their immigration situation \n3  and identify urgent deadlines.  Initial consultations included provision of tailored legal \n4  advice.”  (Id.)  Acacia subcontractors also placed cases with pro bono attorneys.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  \n5  Before placing a case with a pro bono volunteer, the referring subcontractor \nperformed  an  in-depth  legal  screening  to  understand  the  individual’s \n6 \nimmigration  situation,  deadlines,  avenues  for  relief,  and  unique \n7  circumstances.  … After placement, the LASRF program provided ongoing \nmentorship to the pro bono attorney, including guidance, advice, training, and \n8 \nreview of documents submitted to the court.   \n9   \n10  (Id.)   \n11    Despite Acacia’s successful implementation of the LASRF Program and its delivery \n12  of services to nearly 1,200 Class members over the course of approximately eight months, \n13  Defendants terminated Acacia’s contract in April of this year.  (Supp. Decl. of Sara Van \n14  Hofwegen, Attachment 1, ECF No. 766-2.)  The administrative record surrounding this \n15  termination  indicates  the  contract  was  canceled  at  the  request  of  President  Trump’s \n16  “Department of Government Efficiency,” also known as DOGE.  (Id. at AR 1-2, 8.)   \n17    When the contract expired, “Acacia maintained a list of nearly 300 referrals awaiting \n18  services by a legal service subcontractor.”  (Third Supp. Decl.  Sara Van Hofwegen ¶ 6, \n19  ECF No. 783-7.)  More than 200 individuals on that referral list had parole expiration dates \n20  that have either already expired or that expire this month or next.  (Id.)   \n21    Since Acacia’s contract expired on April 30, 2025, EOIR has assumed management \n22  and control over the LASRF Program.  (Supp. Decl. of Stephanie Gorman ¶ 3, ECF No. \n23  768-1.)  To facilitate delivery of services under the new “federalized” program, “EOIR \n24  distributed an outreach flyer to DHS and the U.S. Department of Health and Human  \n25  / / / \n26  / / / \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n5 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11423     Page\n6 of 19\n \n1  Services (HHS) to share with IOM and Seneca[4].”  (Second Supp. Decl. of Stephanie \n2  Gorman ¶ 7, ECF No. 774-1.)  EOIR has also launched a webpage for Class members and \n3  QAFMs, which includes access to the flyer, “a list of upcoming group orientation sessions, \n4  resources for class members and [QAFMs], and instructions for volunteer attorneys and \n5  representatives seeking to represent class members.”  (Id. ¶ 8.)  EOIR has also launched a \n6  LASRF hotline, which Class members and QAFMs can call to request legal services.  (Id. \n7  ¶ 9.)  EOIR has also set up an email address “to centralize communications from the \n8  LASRF Program to class members, [QAFMs], and organizations seeking to refer cases for \n9  LASRF services.”  (Id. ¶ 10.)  In addition to these “outreach” efforts, EOIR has been \n10  providing “virtual group orientations” for Class members on the legal services available \n11  under the LASRF Program, including re-parole and employment authorization renewal, \n12  requests for evidence, notices of intent to deny, and denial notices.  (Id. ¶ 15.)  EOIR has \n13  also been conducting outreach to its “pro bono network … to inform them about the \n14  opportunity to represent class members before EOIR and DHS.”  (Id. ¶ 16.)   \n15    Although numerous Class members have been referred to EOIR and some have \n16  requested services under the new “federalized” Program,5 (see Fifth Supp. Decl. of Anilú \n17  Chadwick ¶¶ 3-5, 7, ECF No. 789-1; Fourth Supp. Decl. of Stephanie Gorman ¶ 3, 6-7), \n18  there is no evidence that any of those services have actually been provided.  (Fifth Supp. \n19  Decl. of Anilú Chadwick ¶¶ 3-5, 7, ECF No. 789-1.)   \n20  / / / \n21 \n \n22 \n23  4 Until June 9, 2025, the Government had a contract with Seneca Family of Agencies to \nprovide case management and behavioral health services to Class members.  (Fifth Supp. \n24 \nDecl. of Anilú Chadwick ¶ 10, ECF No. 789-1.)   \n25  5 Despite being referred to EOIR, at least one Class member reports “being afraid of \nretribution for seeking EOIR’s assistance.”  (Fifth Supp. Decl. of Anilú Chadwick ¶¶ 7.c, \n26 \nECF No. 789-1.)  Another Class member is “concerned that [their] ongoing attempts to \n27  access EOIR legal services may jeopardize [their] immigration case.  [They] fear[ ] that \n[their] fervent pursuit of support could lead to [their] detention by ICE, adding to the \n28 \nanxiety of an already challenging situation.”  (Id. ¶ 7.d.)   \n6 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11424     Page\n7 of 19\n \n1  II. \n2  LEGAL STANDARD \n3    “Once a case has been dismissed, a proceeding to enforce a settlement agreement \n4  requires an independent basis for jurisdiction.”  Pruco Life Ins. Co. v. California Energy \n5  Dev. Inc., No. 3:18-cv-02280-DMS-AHG, 2021 WL 2453280, at *4 (S.D. Cal. June 16, \n6  2021) (citing Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 378 (1994)).  In \n7  this case, the Settlement Agreement specifically states “that any action or proceeding to \n8  enforce the terms of this Agreement shall be brought exclusively to the Court in the Ms. L. \n9  case.”  (Settlement Agreement at 43, ECF No. 721-1.)  That provision goes on to state: \n10  “The Court shall have the power to award such relief and issue such judgments as the Court \n11  deems necessary for enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.”  (Id.)  This provision \n12  confers jurisdiction on this Court to hear the present dispute.   See Pruco, 2021 WL \n13  2453280, at *4 (citing Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 382) (stating “[i]f the district court expressly \n14  retains  jurisdiction  over  the  settlement  agreement  or  incorporates  the  terms  of  the \n15  settlement agreement into the dismissal order, then the Court may exercise ancillary \n16  jurisdiction over a motion to enforce the agreement.”) \n17    In resolving the present dispute, the Court looks to “principles of local law which \n18  apply to interpretation of contracts generally.”  O’Neil v. Bunge Corp., 365 F.3d 820, 822 \n19  (9th Cir. 2004) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  Under California law, the \n20  preponderance  of  the  evidence  standard  applies  to  motions  to  enforce  settlement \n21  agreements.  See Buss v. Superior Court, 16 Cal. 4th 35, 54 (1997) (holding preponderance \n22  of the evidence standard applies to “contractual causes of action”). \n23  III. \n24  DISCUSSION \n25    Plaintiffs argue Defendants are in breach of several provisions of Section IV.B.2.c \n26  of the Settlement Agreement.  Each of these provisions is discussed below. \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n7 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11425     Page\n8 of 19\n \n1  A.  Section IV.B.2.c.i \n2    Section  IV.B.2.c.i  concerns  “Legal  Access  Services  for  Reunified  Families.”  \n3  (Settlement Agreement at 10, ECF No. 721-1.)  This Section requires Defendants to \n4  provide and “adequately resource[ ] and fund[,]” a variety of legal services to Class \n5  members, including among other things, counseling about relief to which Class members \n6  may be entitled, steps necessary to pursue such relief, and preparation for any interview \n7  with USCIS.  (Id. at 11.)  Specifically, Subsection IV.B.2.c.i.(a) states: \n8  In addition to the group information sessions, individual information sessions, \nand self-help workshops that EOIR’s Immigration Court Helpdesk Program \n9 \n(ICH) currently offers, EOIR, through ICH or a separate program (‘Program’), \n10  shall also provide assistance to Ms. L. Settlement Class members, short of full \nrepresentation, including:   \n11 \n•  legal advice, such as individualized consultations and counseling \n12  about relief for which Ms. L. Settlement Class members may be \neligible, and the steps necessary to apply for such relief, as well as \n13 \npreparation for any interviews before USCIS;  \n14  •  assistance  with  document  preparation,  including  preparing \nimmigration-related documents for submission to DHS (including \n15 \nUSCIS),  and  EOIR  pursuant  to  EOIR’s  limited  appearance \n16  regulations; and  \n•  Friend of the Court services, where allowed by the immigration \n17 \ncourt,  to  facilitate  the  flow  of  information  in  the  courtroom, \n18 \nincluding informing noncitizens of their rights and obligations and \ncalling  attention  to  law  or  facts  that  may  be  helpful  to  the \n19 \nimmigration  court.   Where permitted  by  the immigration  court, \n20 \nEOIR will facilitate remote or in-person access for Friend of Court \nservices as appropriate given language needs or location of the \n21 \nparticipating family and legal services provider.   \n22 \n \n23 \n(Id. at 10-11.)   \n24 \n  Plaintiffs argue Acacia was providing all these services to Ms. L. Settlement Class \n25 \nmembers before its contract with Defendants expired.  The Declaration of Sara Van \n26 \nHofwegen, the Managing Director at Acacia, supports that argument.  (See Decl. of Sara \n27 \nVan Hofwegen in Supp. of Mot. to Enforce Settlement Agreement ¶ 6, ECF No. 762-1.) In \n28 \nthat Declaration, Ms. Hofwegen states:  \n8 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11426     Page\n9 of 19\n \n1  Under  the  Statement  of  Work  issued  for  the  LASRF  program,  Acacia \nsubcontracted with nine regional service providers and a national pro bono \n2 \nprovider  to  provide  legal  services  to  Ms.  L.  Class  Members  and  their \n3  Qualifying  Additional  Family  Members  (QAFM),  including  individual \ncounseling and consultations, legal advice, pro se workshops, Friend of the \n4 \nCourt Services, and pro bono placements and mentoring and assistance with \n5  parole applications and renewals, applications and renewals or employment \nauthorization documents (EADs), or hearing preparation from the LASRF \n6 \nProgram.   \n7   \n8  (Id.)  Plaintiffs argue since Acacia’s contract expired, Defendants have not been providing \n9  any of these services to Class members, and they are therefore in breach of this provision.   \n10    Defendants respond that they are complying with this provision by conducting \n11  outreach to Ms. L. Settlement Class members, updating the together.gov and juntos.gov \n12  websites, creating a webpage for Class members, launching and staffing a telephone hotline \n13  for Class members, setting up and monitoring an email address for Class members and \n14  making phone calls to Class members who inquire through the email address, calling Class \n15  members on the Acacia waiting list, and providing services to Class members through \n16  referrals to pro bono attorneys.  None of these efforts, however, actually delivers the \n17  services set out in Section IV.B.2.c.i.(a).  Indeed, Defendants concede EOIR  and its \n18  personnel cannot provide these services directly.  (Opp’n to Renewed Mot. at 3, ECF No. \n19  774) (recognizing that since EOIR evaluates applications for immigration relief it cannot \n20  also provide legal advice to the same individuals seeking such relief).  \n21    Absent an ability to provide these services directly, Defendants contend they are \n22  fulfilling their contractual obligations by referring Class members to pro bono attorneys, \n23  who will, in turn, provide the necessary services.   (See, e.g., Second Supp. Decl. of \n24  Stephanie Gorman ¶ 18, ECF No. 774-1) (stating “EOIR will engage with volunteer \n25  attorneys and representatives to fulfill the individualized services specified under section \n26  IV.B.2.c.i.(a).”)  However, the Settlement Agreement itself states “EOIR cannot ensure \n27  that it can find a pro bono representative for every family.”  (Settlement Agreement at 12, \n28  ECF No. 721-1.)  And the evidence currently before the Court reflects that since the \n9 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11427     Page\n10 of 19\n \n1  expiration of Acacia’s contract on April 30, 2025, and despite requests from and referrals \n2  of Class members to EOIR, (see Fourth Supp. Decl. of Stephanie Gorman ¶¶ 3, 6, 7; Fifth \n3  Supp. Decl. of Anilú Chadwick ¶¶ 2-5, 7.(a)-(d), 10), EOIR has not placed a single Class \n4  member with pro bono counsel.  (See Third Supp. Decl. of Stephanie Gorman ¶ 12, ECF \n5  No. 782-2) (stating, as of May 23, 2025, “No cases have yet been placed with a pro bono \n6  representative.”)   \n7    This difficulty in finding pro bono counsel for Class members is not specific to \n8  Defendants.  During the one-year term of its contract, and out of a group of nearly 1200 \n9  Class members who received services, Acacia was only able to place approximately 70 \n10  Class members with pro bono counsel.  (Third Supp. Decl. of Sara Van Hofwegen ¶ 5, ECF \n11  No. 783-7.)  Since Acacia’s contract expired, the pro bono landscape has only deteriorated \n12  because of funding cuts and staffing shortages.  (See, e.g., Decl. of Alicia de la O ¶ 8, ECF \n13  No.  771-2)  (stating  American  Bar  Association  Commission  of  Immigration  “is \n14  experiencing  significant  staffing  and  resource  challenges  due  to  the  recent  notice  of \n15  termination  leading  to  a  loss  of  funding  for  the  LOP  services  offered  through  the \n16  Information Hotline.”)  Thus, although Defendants intend to provide the services set out in \n17  Section IV.B.2.c.i.(a) through pro bono counsel, the current landscape strongly suggests \n18  Defendants’ placement rate, which is presently zero, is not likely to improve.  Unless or \n19  until those placements are actually made, Defendants are not providing Class members \n20  with  the  services  required  by  Section  IV.B.2.c.i.(a)  of  the  Settlement  Agreement.  \n21  Defendants are therefore in breach of this provision.   \n22  B.  Section IV.B.2.c.ii \n23    Section  IV.B.2.c.ii  is  entitled,  “Program  to  Place  Cases  with  Pro  Bono \n24  Representatives.”  Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section state:   \n25  (a) EOIR cannot ensure that it can find a pro bono representative for every \nfamily.  However, the Program will leverage its existing pro bono referral \n26 \nefforts, and provide additional funding, to recruit, train, mentor, and match \n27  pro bono attorneys to represent Ms. L. Settlement Class members.  EOIR will \n28 \n10 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11428     Page\n11 of 19\n \n1  facilitate Model Hearing Programs in connection with provider training for \nnew pro bono representatives, where available.   \n2 \n \n3  (b) The Program would identify cases for pro bono placement through in-\ndepth  individualized  consultations  of  Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class  members.  \n4 \nThese cases would then be placed on an online pro bono platform to help \n5  match  potential  pro  bono  representatives  with  reunified  families.    The \nProgram will provide pro bono attorneys with mentors to advise and consult \n6 \nwith them throughout the case.   \n7   \n8  (Settlement Agreement at 12, ECF No. 721-1.) \n9    Plaintiffs  argue  Defendants  are  in  breach  of  subsection  (b)  of  this  provision.  \n10  Specifically, they assert Defendants cannot conduct individualized consultations of Ms. L. \n11  Settlement Class members prior to pro bono referrals because, as noted, EOIR’s practice \n12  manuals and federal ethics regulations prohibit them from doing so.  (Renewed Mot. at 7-\n13  9, ECF No. 771.)  Defendants do not dispute this argument.  In fact, Defendants state all \n14  Class Members who request individualized assistance will be referred to pro bono counsel, \n15  therefore there is no need for individualized consultations in the first instance.  (Opp’n to \n16  Renewed Mot. at 5, ECF No. 774.) (stating “in-depth individualized consultations will not \n17  be needed because the individual facts and circumstances of a case will not inform whether \n18  the class member receives pro bono assistance or how they are matched with a volunteer.”)   \n19    The problem with Defendants’ argument, however, is the Settlement Agreement \n20  requires those “individualized consultations.”  (See Settlement Agreement at 12, ECF No. \n21  721-1) (stating the Program would “identify cases for pro bono placement through in-depth \n22  individualized consultations of Ms. L. Settlement Class members.”)  Having agreed to that \n23  requirement, Defendants cannot just simply disregard it.  As stated by the California Court \n24  of Appeal:  \n25  Why negotiate an agreement if either party can disregard its provisions?  What \npoint would there be in reducing it to writing, if the terms of the contract were \n26 \nof no legal consequence?  Why submit the agreement to the governing body \n27  for determination, if its approval were without significance?  What integrity \nwould be left in government if government itself could attack the integrity of \n28 \nits own agreement?   \n11 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11429     Page\n12 of 19\n \n1  Chula Vista Police Officers’ Ass’n v. Cole, 107 Cal. App. 3d 242, 247-48 (1980) (quoting \n2  Glendale City Employees Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Glendale, 15 Cal. 3d 328, 336 (1975)).   \n3    Although the language of the contract is clear, the requirement for individualized \n4  consultations also makes sense for both the pro bono attorneys and the Class members.  As \n5  set out in the Declaration of Steven H. Schulman, the process of referring and accepting \n6  pro bono cases “is a match-making one[.]”  (Decl. of Steven H. Schulman in Supp. of \n7  Renewed Mot. ¶ 5, ECF No. 783-1.)  Most referrals come from nonprofit legal services \n8  organizations that “interview[ ] potential clients and draft[ ] detailed, deidentified case \n9  summaries.”  (Id.)  The pro bono professionals then “review these summaries and consider \n10  who in the firm may have the interest, availability, and capacity to take on the matter \n11  described.”  (Id.)  Indeed, this is what Acacia did when trying to place Class members with \n12  pro bono counsel.  (See Third Supp. Decl. of Sara Van Hofwegen ¶ 12, ECF 783-7) (stating \n13  before placing a case with a pro bono volunteer, “the referring subcontractor performed an \n14  in-depth legal screening to understand the individual’s immigration situation, deadlines, \n15  avenues  for  relief,  and  unique  circumstances.”)    The  referring  entity  then  “screened \n16  potential pro bono attorneys to ensure they had the capacity and training necessary to take \n17  the case.”  (Id.)   \n18    Here, the individualized consultations required by the Settlement Agreement are the \n19  starting point for a successful pro bono referral process, and they are particularly important \n20  in this case, where Class members will undoubtedly need different kinds of legal advice.  \n21  For  instance,  certain  Class  members  may  need  assistance  with  parole  and  work \n22  authorization applications.  Other Class members may need assistance with their asylum \n23  applications.    Other  Class  members  may  need  assistance  with  pending  removal \n24  proceedings.  And some Class members may need assistance in all three areas.  Defendants’ \n25  failure to conduct the individualized consultations dooms the possibility of placing Class \n26  members with pro bono counsel, (see Schulman Decl. in Supp. of Renewed Mot. ¶ 5) \n27  (stating “[l]aw firms with pro bono professionals rarely (if ever) accept pro bono matters \n28  without knowing anything about the facts or law involved.  That is because it is all but \n12 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11430     Page\n13 of 19\n \n1  impossible to recruit volunteers without offering accurate and clear information about what \n2  they are volunteering to do.”), and as relevant to the present motion, is a breach of Section \n3  IV.B.2.c.ii.(b) of the Settlement Agreement. \n4  C.  Section IV.B.2.c.iii  \n5    Section IV.B.2.c.iii governs “Assistance Outside EOIR Proceedings.”  Subsections \n6  (a) and (b) of this Section state:   \n7  (a) To ensure Ms. L. Settlement Class members have the ability to reunify \nthrough the process set out in Section IV.C.1, and as part of the governmental \n8 \nassistance  to  Qualifying  Additional  Family  Members  in  Section  IV.C.1, \n9  Defendants  will  continue  to  contract  with  an  independent  contractor  to \ncommunicate  with  Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class  members  and  assist  Ms.  L. \n10 \nSettlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members with \n11  necessary parole and employment authorization applications.   \n \n12 \n(b)  Defendants  will,  under  the  Protective  Order,  ensure  that  contact \n13  information of Ms. L. Settlement Class members is provided to the contractor, \nand establish links between the contractor and other organizations that work \n14 \nwith, or have potential access to, Ms. L. Settlement Class members to facilitate \n15  referrals to the Program.  This would include a call center (e.g., ‘hotline’ or \ntelephonic help desk) that will conduct affirmative outreach to identify and \n16 \nscreen people and refer them to services.”   \n17 \n18  (Settlement Agreement at 12-13, ECF No. 721-1.)   \n19    Plaintiffs argue Defendants are in breach of subsection (a), in particular the provision \n20  that requires Defendants “to contract with an independent contractor to communicate with \n21  Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class  members  and  assist  Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class  members  and \n22  Qualifying  Additional  Family  Members  with  necessary  parole  and  employment \n23  authorization  applications.”    (Id.  at  12.)    Plaintiffs  interpret  “necessary  parole  and \n24  employment authorization applications” to include the initial applications and any renewal \n25  applications, and they argue that since Acacia’s contract expired, Defendants have not \n26  contracted with an independent contractor to assist Class members with those renewal \n27  applications.   \n28  / / / \n13 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11431     Page\n14 of 19\n \n1    Defendants  do  not  dispute  that  they  have  not  contracted  with  an  independent \n2  contractor to assist Class members with renewal applications.  Instead, they argue this \n3  provision only requires them to contract with an independent contractor for initial parole \n4  and  employment  authorization  applications,  which  they  did.    Defendants  also  assert \n5  Plaintiffs have failed to provide any “persuasive evidence that any class member who has \n6  not yet reunified needs to request re-parole or employment authorization renewal.”  (Supp. \n7  Br. in Opp’n to Renewed Mot. at 3-4, ECF No. 782.)  Defendants also contend that to the \n8  extent any Class members need assistance with these tasks, Defendants will refer those \n9  Class members to “volunteer attorneys.”  (Id.) \n10    Given the parties’ arguments, the Court turns first to the proper interpretation of \n11  “necessary” parole and employment authorization applications.  In interpreting this term, \n12  the  Court  “must  decide  whether  the  language  is  ‘reasonably  susceptible’  to  the \n13  interpretations urged by the parties.”  Badie v. Bank of Am., 67 Cal. App. 4th 779, 798 \n14  (citing Oceanside 84, Ltd. v. Fidelity Federal Bank, 56 Cal. App. 4th 1441, 1448 (1997)).   \n15  Plaintiffs argue “necessary” means the parole and employment authorization applications \n16  are needed to “promote family well-being and unity[.]”  (Settlement Agreement at 17, ECF \n17  No. 721-1.)  Defendants do not rely on a specific provision of the Settlement Agreement \n18  to support their interpretation of “necessary.”  Instead, they cite to other provisions of the \n19  Agreement  that  recite  “additional  parole  periods”  and  “re-parole,”  and  argue  these \n20  provisions reflect the parties were aware of the distinction between parole and re-parole \n21  and did not include that distinction in Section IV.B.2.c.iii.(a).   \n22    Although the Settlement Agreement recites both “parole” and “re-parole,” (id.), the \n23  Court is not persuaded that the absence of “re-parole” in Section IV.B.2.c.iii.(a) means “re-\n24  parole” is not “necessary.”  Indeed, in the paragraph cited by Defendants, the Settlement \n25  Agreement appears to use “parole” and “re-parole” interchangeably.  (See id.) (“Requests \n26  for re-parole will be determined on a case-by-case basis and parole is not guaranteed based \n27  on this Settlement Agreement.”)   \n28  / / / \n14 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11432     Page\n15 of 19\n \n1    Contrary to Defendants’ argument, the paragraph they cite, which is also cited by \n2  Plaintiffs,  provides  more  support  for  Plaintiffs’  interpretation  of  “necessary.”    That \n3  paragraph states:   \n4  Ms. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members \nwho are in the United States may request additional parole periods (i.e., re-\n5 \nparole) with USCIS prior to the expiration of their authorized parole period \n6  and prior to the Termination Date if there is a continued need to promote \nfamily well-being and unity or to continue behavioral health services under \n7 \nthis Settlement Agreement.  This showing of continued need may be based on \n8  the same or similar evidence that supported the initial application but must \ndemonstrate that the need is ongoing.  If approved for re-parole, the authorized \n9 \nperiod of parole will be for the period needed to achieve the stated purpose, \n10  up to an additional thirty-six months. \n11  (Id.)  Considered in its entirety, this passage clearly contemplates that “necessary” parole \n12  applications may include applications for re-parole.  This interpretation is also consistent \n13  with the broader framework of the Settlement Agreement, which sets out an extremely \n14  detailed and specific process for Class members to apply for asylum in the United States, \n15  and which process, generally, “can take years to conclude.”  Asylum in the United States, \n16  Am.  Immigr.  Council,  https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/asylum-\n17  united-states (May 9, 2025).  Given the complex and lengthy immigrations processes \n18  addressed  in  the  Settlement  Agreement,  it  should  be  commonplace  that  many  Class \n19  members will have a “continued need to promote family well-being and unity,” which can \n20  only be accomplished through the parole and re-parole processes.   \n21    This interpretation of “necessary” is also clearly supported by the parties’ actual \n22  course of conduct.  See Cal. Civ. P. Code § 1856(c) (“The terms set forth in a writing \n23  described in subdivision (a) may be explained or supplemented by course of dealing or \n24  usage of trade or by course of performance.”)  Although Defendants argue the Settlement \n25  Agreement does not require them to contract with an independent contractor to assist Class  \n26  / / / \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n15 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11433     Page\n16 of 19\n \n1  members with re-parole and applications for renewal of employment authorization,6 it is \n2  undisputed Acacia was providing precisely those services to Class members during the \n3  term of its contract and without Defendants’ objection.  (See Third Supp. Decl. of Sara Van \n4  Hofwegen ¶ 7, ECF 783-7) (stating many referrals to Acacia “were for individuals with \n5  urgent deadlines in their cases, often because they required assistance with re-parole or \n6  received  requests  for  additional  evidence  (RFEs)  in  their  initial  or  renewal  parole \n7  applications.”)    When  combined  with  the  analysis  above,  the  Court  finds  the  term \n8  “necessary” includes both initial applications for parole and employment authorization and \n9  applications for re-parole and work authorization renewal.   \n10    Under  this  interpretation  of  the  Settlement  Agreement,  there  is  no  dispute \n11  Defendants are in breach as they do not have a contract with an independent contractor to \n12  “assist Ms. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members with \n13  necessary parole and employment authorization applications.”  (Settlement Agreement at \n14  12, ECF No. 721-1.)  Neither Defendants’ provision of group orientation sessions nor their \n15  intent to refer Class members to pro bono attorneys satisfies the “independent contractor” \n16  requirement.  Thus, Defendants are in breach of this provision, as well.7 \n17 \n \n18 \n19  6 At the hearing, Defendants reframed this argument to say the Settlement Agreement does \nnot create a continuing obligation on their part to provide assistance with re-parole and \n20 \napplications for renewal of work authorization.  However, the issue is not whether the \n21  Settlement Agreement created a continuing obligation on Defendants’ part.  Rather, the \nissue is the scope of Defendants’ initial obligation to Class members, and whether that \n22 \nobligation  to  contract  with  an  independent  contractor  to  provide  assistance  with \n23  “necessary” parole applications and employment authorizations included only the initial \napplications or subsequent applications, as well.   \n24 \n7 In their Supplemental Opposition Brief, Defendants seemed to suggest that even if they \n25  were in breach of this provision, Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence of a Class \nmember  either  needing  or  requesting  assistance  with  an  application  for  re-parole  or \n26 \nrenewed work authorization and Defendants’ failure to provide that assistance.  (Supp. \n27  Opp’n at 3-4, ECF No. 782.)  But there is evidence in the record to that effect.  In the Fifth \nSupplemental Declaration of Anilú Chadwick, she lists two Class members who have \n28 \nreached out to EOIR for assistance and received no response.  (See Fifth Supp. Decl. of \n16 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11434     Page\n17 of 19\n \n1    Given  the  breaches  identified  above,  the  only  remaining  issue  is  the  remedy.  \n2  Plaintiffs request the remedy of specific performance in the form of a Court order requiring \n3  Defendants to reinstate their contract with Acacia to provide the services set out in the \n4  Settlement Agreement.  Defendants argue the Settlement Agreement does not require them \n5  to contract with a third party at all, much less Acacia.   \n6    Contrary to Defendants’ argument, and consistent with the Court’s discussion above, \n7  the  Settlement  Agreement  does  require  Defendants  to  “contract  with  an  independent \n8  contractor to communicate with Ms. L. Settlement Class members and assist Ms. L. \n9  Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members with necessary \n10  parole and employment authorization applications.”  (Settlement Agreement at 12, ECF \n11  No. 721-1.)  Although the Department of Homeland Security apparently had a contract \n12  with IOM to provide Class members with assistance with their initial parole and work \n13  authorization applications, (Supp. Opp’n to Mot. at 2, ECF No. 782), there is no evidence \n14  before the Court that Defendants have a contract with an independent contractor to assist \n15  with applications for re-parole or additional applications for work authorization.  Because \n16  the Settlement Agreement specifically requires Defendants to have such a contract in place, \n17  the Court grants Plaintiffs’ request for specific performance, and under Section VII.D. of \n18  the Settlement Agreement, (see Settlement Agreement at 43, ECF No. 721-2) (stating \n19  “[t]he Court shall have the power to award such relief and issue such judgments as the  \n20  / / / \n21  / / / \n22 \n23   \n24 \nAnilú Chadwick ¶ 7.a-b.)  The first Class member reached out because their parole expired \n25  on May 26, 2025, (id. ¶ 7.a), and the second Class member reached out because their parole \nis set to expire in October.  (Id. ¶ 7.b.)  Stephanie Gorman, the Acting Assistant Director \n26 \nof Policy for the Executive Office of Immigration Review, also confirms that at least three \n27  Class members reached out to EOIR for assistance with re-parole and/or employment \nauthorization renewals, and as of June 4, 2025, were awaiting placement with a pro bono \n28 \nattorney.  (Fourth Supp. Decl. of Stephanie Gorman ¶¶ 3, 6, 7, ECF No. 788-1.)   \n17 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11435     Page\n18 of 19\n \n1  Court deems necessary for enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.”), orders Defendants \n2  to reinstate their LASRF task order8 with Acacia so it can provide those services.   \n3    The  Court  also  grants  Plaintiffs’  request  for  specific  performance  of  Section \n4  IV.B.2.c.i.(a) of the Settlement Agreement.  As discussed, Defendants’ attempts to place \n5  Class members with pro bono attorneys does not satisfy the Settlement Agreement’s \n6  mandate that these services “shall” be provided.  (Settlement Agreement at 10, ECF No. \n7  721-1.)  And while Defendants continue these attempts, more than 200 Class members \n8  have parole dates that have either expired or will expire by the end of July, (Third Supp. \n9  Decl. of Sara Van Hofwegen ¶ 6, ECF No. 783-7), and the deadline for Class members to \n10  apply for asylum begins in December.  (Resp. in Supp. of Mot. at 9, ECF No. 787.)  \n11  Because Defendants will be reinstating their contract with Acacia, as set out above, Acacia \n12  shall also provide the services set out in Section IV.B.2.c.i.(a).   \n13    The final area of breach concerns the “individualized consultations” requirement set \n14  out in Section IV.C.2.c.ii.(b).  Here, there is no dispute that Defendants cannot satisfy this \n15  requirement themselves.  Thus, along with the services set out above, Acacia will resume \n16  these “individualized consultations” to identify cases for pro bono placement.”  (Settlement \n17  Agreement at 12, ECF No. 721-1.)    \n18  IV. \n19  CONCLUSION \n20    For the reasons set out above, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ renewed motion to enforce \n21  the Settlement Agreement.  Consistent with the Court’s prior orders, and given the Court’s \n22  “power to award such relief and issue such judgments as the Court deems necessary for \n23  enforcement  of  the  Settlement  Agreement[,]”  (id.  at  43,  ECF  No.  721-2),  the  Court \n24  continues its order requiring the Government to inform Plaintiffs’ counsel within 24 hours \n25  if it detains a member of the Ms. L. Class or other QAFMs defined in the Settlement \n26 \n \n27 \n8 This task order is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Sara Van Hofwegen, ECF \n28 \nNo. 762-1. \n18 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 795     Filed 06/10/25     PageID.11436     Page\n19 of 19\n \n1  Agreement.  The information provided to Plaintiffs’ counsel shall include, but is not limited \n2  to, the identity of the detained person, his or her A-file number, and place of detention.  \n3  Because the Court is granting Plaintiffs’ request for specific performance, the Court defers \n4  Plaintiffs’ additional request to extend the deadlines set out in the Settlement Agreement.   \n5    A status conference will be held on June 27, 2025, at 1:30 p.m. to discuss the \n6  parties’ progress in meeting their obligations under the Settlement Agreement and this \n7  Order.

OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO \n  ENFORCE SETTLEMENT \n17 \nAGREEMENT REGARDING \n           Defendants.  PROVISION OF LEGAL \n18  SERVICES \n \n \n19 \n20 \n \n21   \n  The Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce (Dkt. 762) because Defendants \n22 \nare  entitled  to  change  the  method  of  providing  the  legal  services  provided  without \n23 \n24  breaching  the  Settlement  (Dkt.  721-1).    The  premise  of  Plaintiffs’  motion  is  the \n25 \n        \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 765     Filed 04/25/25     PageID.10789     Page\n2 of 7\n   \n1  Defendants’ non-renewal of a contract with the Acacia Center for Justice to administer the \n2 \nExecutive  Office  for  Immigration  Review’s  (“EOIR”)  Legal  Access  Services  for \n3 \nReunified Families (“LASRF”) Program is a breach of the Settlement. See Dkt. 762 at 5 \n4 \n(“Termination, even for a short period of time, of legal services, would be a clear breach \n5 \nof the terms of the Settlement Agreement, as would any decrease in the level of services”).  \n6 \n7  Not so. Dkt. 721-1, Settlement, Section IV. B.2.c. (“Immigration Legal Services”) of the \n8  Settlement  describes  the  “legal  access  and  orientation”  services  that  Defendants  are \n9 \nrequired to provide to class members. Id. at 10-12.  Defendants can provide these services \n10 \nthrough EOIR’s Immigration Court Helpdesk, “or a separate similar program.” Dkt. 721-\n11 \n1.  The Settlement does not require Defendants to contract with a third party to provide \n12 \nlegal services.  Additionally, the Settlement does not require Defendants to provide legal \n13 \n14  services through the same method for the term of the agreement.  In the first year of the \n15 \nsettlement, from May 1, 2023 through April 30, 2025, Defendants, through EOIR, met \n16 \nthis requirement by creating the LASRF Program and contracting with Acacia to provide \n17 \nlegal services.  See Gorman Decl. ¶ 3 (Attached hereto as “Exhibit 1”).  Beginning May \n18 \n1, 2025, however, EOIR decided to administer the LASRF Program services directly “to \n19 \nmaximize efficiency in the delivery of the program services.” Id. Plaintiffs cannot point \n20 \n21  to any provision in the Settlement that requires Defendants to maintain a contract with \n22 \nAcacia, or with  any  third-party legal  services  provider.   Nor  can  they point to any \n23 \nprovision in the Settlement that requires Defendants to provide Plaintiffs advance notice \n24 \n25 \n2 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 765     Filed 04/25/25     PageID.10790     Page\n3 of 7\n   \n1  of changes in the how Defendants will provide the legal services.  Because Defendants are \n2 \nentitled to make these changes without breaching the Settlement, the Court should deny \n3 \nthe motion to enforce. \n4 \n  The Court should also deny Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce because Defendants have \n5 \nnot breached the Settlement.  Notably absent from Plaintiffs’ motion is any evidence that \n6 \n7  Defendants have denied class members the required legal services.  Moreover, Plaintiffs \n8  do not articulate what relief they want from the Court; presumably, they want the Court \n9 \nto require Defendants to renew the option on the contract for the LASRF Program with \n10 \nAcacia.  But the agreement between the parties provided Defendants with flexibility on \n11 \nhow  to  provide  the  required  legal  services,  see  Dkt.  721-1,  Settlement,  Section \n12 \nIV.B.2.c.i.(a), including the option of providing the services directly.  Here, beginning on \n13 \n14  May 1, 2025, Defendants have opted to provide the required legal services through EOIR, \n15 \nwhich will directly administer the LASRF Program.  Gorman Decl. ¶ 3.  EOIR’s LASRF \n16 \nProgram will satisfy the legal access and orientation services that Defendants obligated \n17 \nEOIR to provide to Ms. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family \n18 \nmembers (“QAFMs”) under the Settlement Agreement.  Id. ¶ 4.   \n19 \nSpecifically, EOIR’s LASRF Program will prioritize remote services using virtual \n20 \n21  communication  platforms  based  on  experience  from  the  first  settlement  year  that \n22 \nparticipants preferred these services, while maintaining at least eight regional offices for \n23 \nin-person services.  Id. ¶ 5.  Additionally, to help the greatest number of class members to \n24 \n25 \n3 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 765     Filed 04/25/25     PageID.10791     Page\n4 of 7\n   \n1  meet their filing deadlines and to reduce waiting times, the program will focus on group \n2 \nservices.  Id.  EOIR has also taken steps to centralize communication for case referrals, \n3 \nand  will  utilize  those  referrals  to  conduct  outreach  and  schedule  services  for  class \n4 \nmembers and QAFMs.  Id. ¶ 6.  EOIR will advertise and provide instructions to class \n5 \nmembers and QAFMs on how to utilize LASRF Program services.  Id.  Finally, EOIR will \n6 \n7  work with other government agencies and their contractors to connect class members and \n8  QAFMs to legal services, and it will leverage its existing public outreach efforts to \n9 \nfacilitate pro bono representation. Id.  Accordingly, because EOIR will provide the legal \n10 \naccess  and  orientation  services  that  Defendants  obligated  EOIR  to  provide  to  class \n11 \nmembers and QAFMs under the Settlement Agreement, the Court should deny the motion \n12 \nto enforce.   \n13 \n14    Finally, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce Plaintiff did not follow \n15 \nthe dispute resolution procedures required by the Settlement. The parties agreed to a \n16 \nspecific dispute resolution process that they would follow “before seeking enforcement \n17 \nwith the Court.” See Dkt. 721-1, Settlement, Section VII.  That procedure includes notice \n18 \nby the complaining party, an opportunity to respond by the receiving party, and the \n19 \nopportunity to resolve the dispute through a meet and confer, or a mediator, before seeking \n20 \n21  relief from the Court. Id.  Plaintiffs excuse themselves from this requirement by arguing \n22 \nthat “Defendant’s nonrenewal of the legal services contract occurred . . .  less than 30 days \n23 \n24 \n25 \n4 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 765     Filed 04/25/25     PageID.10792     Page\n5 of 7\n   \n1  before the provided services would end.”  Dkt. 762 at 8. 1  But as set forth above, the non-\n2 \nrenewal of the contract with Acacia is not a breach of the Settlement.  Accordingly, the \n3 \nCourt should deny Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce the Settlement based on Plaintiffs’ failure \n4 \nto follow the agreed procedure for resolving disputes. \n5 \nConclusion\n6 \n7 \nFor these reasons and others, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce.  \n8   \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n \n19  1  Plaintiffs  also  attempt  to  justify  non-compliance  with  the  Settlement  by  citing \ncorrespondence between counsel when Plaintiffs first learned that the contract with Acacia \n20 \nwould  not  be  renewed.  Mot.  at  5.  Defendants  attach  the  entirety  of  the  email \ncorrespondences Class Counsel reference in their motion to provide complete context for \n21 \nthe portions Class Counsel quoted (Attached hereto as “Exhibit 2”). Defendants note in \n22  particular that, contrary to Class Counsel’s assertion, Dkt. 762 at 1 n.1, 6, their email on \nApril 15 did not clearly raise a possible breach as it (equivocally) equated a lapse in the \n23 \ncontract with a lapse in services—which is not the case. Notably, as explained here, the \nagreement does not expressly provide that Defendants must contract with a third-party \n24 \ncontractor to provide the required legal services. \n25 \n5 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 765     Filed 04/25/25     PageID.10793     Page\n6 of 7  \n \n \nDATED: April 25, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n1 \n \n2 \nYAAKOV M.

GORMAN \n16 \nI, Stephanie E. Gorman, declare as follows:  \n17 \n18  1.  I am the Acting Assistant Director of Policy for the Executive Office for \n19 \nImmigration Review (EOIR), which is an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice \n20 \n(DOJ).  EOIR’s mission is to adjudicate immigration cases by fairly, expeditiously, and \n21 \nuniformly interpreting and administering the Nation’s immigration laws. Under delegated \n22 \nauthority from the Attorney General, EOIR conducts immigration court proceedings, \n23 \n24  appellate  reviews,  and  administrative  hearings.    I  was  appointed  as  EOIR’s  Acting \n25 \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 768-1     Filed 04/30/25     PageID.10881 \n  P age 2 of 7\n1  Assistant Director of Policy in February 2025.  Prior to assuming this position, I served as \n2 \nan Assistant Chief Immigration Judge from January 2025 to February 2025, an Appellate \n3 \nImmigration Judge from 2019 to 2025, and an Immigration Judge from 2017 to 2019.  I \n4 \nsubmit this declaration to supplement my prior declaration dated April 25, 2025, and filed \n5 \nwith this Court on April 25, 2025 (Document 765-1). \n6 \n7  2.  This declaration is based on my personal knowledge and information made \n8  available to me in the course of my official duties. \n9 \n3.  Following class counsel’s filing of the “Reply in Support of Motion to \n10 \nEnforce Settlement Agreement Provision of Legal Services” and additional declarations \n11 \nattached thereto, this supplemental declaration is provided for further clarification and \n12 \nexplanation of services pertaining to the transfer of the management and operation of the \n13 \n14  Legal Access Services for Reunified Families (LASRF) Program, from a contractor to \n15 \nEOIR.  \n16 \n4.  Beginning on May 1, 2025, EOIR will administer LASRF Program services \n17 \ndirectly under a federalized program to maximize efficiency in the delivery of these \n18 \nprogram services.  See Document 765-1.  More specifically, EOIR will coordinate with \n19 \nthe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human \n20 \n21  Services (HHS), as well as their contractors currently providing services to class members, \n22 \nto deliver these services through EOIR under a federalized program.  EOIR met with DHS \n23 \non Wednesday, April 30, 2025, to coordinate logistics for this transition.  EOIR will begin \n24 \n25 \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 768-1     Filed 04/30/25     PageID.10882 \n  P age 3 of 7\n1  accepting referrals and information on class members and QAFMs beginning May 1, \n2 \n2025, from DHS and HHS and their contractors (including International Organization for \n3 \nMigration and Seneca Family of Agencies).  To begin the transition, on April 29, 2025, \n4 \nEOIR through the Justice Management Division (JMD) requested that Acacia provide the \n5 \ncurrent waitlist information as well as the materials that have been created under the \n6 \n7  contract.  Additionally, EOIR requested that Acacia provide other program deliverables \n8  to include a Quarterly Report, April Conference Call Notes, April Monthly Report, Final \n9 \nSurge Pricing Lists for Regional Services and National Pro Bono Services, and the April \n10 \ninvoice.   \n11 \n5.  Beginning on May 1, 2025, EOIR will begin to contact class members on the \n12 \ncurrent LASRF services’ waitlist, along with any new referrals received, to inform such \n13 \n14  class members about the availability and scheduling of Program services.  \n15 \n6.  By May 15, 2025, EOIR personnel will begin providing regularly scheduled \n16 \ngroup sessions and self-help workshops on a rotating set of topics to class members and \n17 \nQualifying Additional Family Members (QAFMs) to equip them with the knowledge and \n18 \ninformation to successfully navigate their immigration proceedings.  Topics may include, \n19 \nbut  are  not  limited  to,  class  member  rights  and  obligations,  informational  sessions \n20 \n21  covering various forms of relief from removal (including asylum and similarly related \n22 \nrelief),  how  to  complete  immigration  forms  and  collect  supporting  documentation \n23 \n(including applications for parole and employment authorization), how to properly submit \n24 \n25 \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 768-1     Filed 04/30/25     PageID.10883 \n  P age 4 of 7\n1  forms  and  applications  to  USCIS  and  the  Immigration  Court,  how  to  prepare  for \n2 \nImmigration Court Hearings and USCIS interviews, and how to respond to requests for \n3 \nevidence and notices of intent to deny.   \n4 \n7.  If  there  are  any  material  changes  in  the  law  or  to  the  settlement \n5 \nimplementation that impact Ms. L. class members and QAFMs, EOIR will offer additional \n6 \n7  group sessions to specifically address such changes.  \n8  8.  These sessions will be offered in person on a rotating basis in at least eight \n9 \nregional locations based on interest and location availability.  Sessions will additionally \n10 \nbe provided virtually, which will allow the maximum number of Ms. L. class members \n11 \nand QAFMs to participate.  Information on the time and method of delivery will be \n12 \nprovided to class members and QAFMs by telephone or email.  To increase awareness of \n13 \n14  the availability of these services, this information will be shared with DHS and HHS and \n15 \ntheir contractors who have contact with class members and QAFMs.   \n16 \n9.  Currently, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a contractor \n17 \nfor DHS, operates the “Help Desk” required by Section VI(A)(2)(c)(iv) of the settlement \n18 \nagreement.  On or before May 1, 2025, EOIR will provide DHS and HHS with talking \n19 \npoints to share with their contractors, which will include up-to-date information to share \n20 \n21  with  settlement  class  members  concerning  obtaining  legal  services  under  EOIR’s \n22 \nfederalized program.  \n23 \n24 \n25 \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 768-1     Filed 04/30/25     PageID.10884 \n  P age 5 of 7\n1  10.  Information  on  the  availability  of  sessions  and  how  to  request  more \n2 \ninformation will also be included on the webpage that EOIR will launch on May 1, 2025.  \n3 \nThis information will be updated in real time to reflect the current session offerings.  By \n4 \nMay 15, 2025, this webpage will also include information and resources specific to class \n5 \nmembers and QAFMs.   \n6 \n7  11.  In addition, EOIR will leverage its existing pro bono network, including \n8  those listed on the EOIR Pro Bono List,1 to connect interested class members with \n9 \navailable pro bono representatives to provide representation.  EOIR will refer all interested \n10 \nclass members for pro bono representation.  EOIR maintains a policy of encouraging pro \n11 \nbono  representation  by  all  of  its  adjudicatory  components  and  facilitates  pro  bono \n12 \nrepresentation  in  multiple  ways.    See  Policy  Memorandum  21-08,  Pro  Bono  Legal \n13 \n14  Services (Dec. 10, 2020).   \n15 \n12.  Pro bono representation can provide greater legal support and continuity of \n16 \nservices for class members.  Rather than EOIR providing legal services directly, pro bono \n17 \nrepresentatives can more appropriately provide legal advice and individualized support by \n18 \nassisting class members through their immigration proceedings before USCIS and EOIR.  \n19 \nAs required by the settlement, EOIR will provide a library of resources for pro bono \n20 \n21  attorneys with specific resources related to representation of Ms. L. Settlement Class \n22 \n23 \n \n1  The  List  of  Pro  Bono  Legal  Service  Providers  is  currently  found  at \n24 \nhttps://www.justice.gov/eoir/list-pro-bono-legal-service-providers. \n25 \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 768-1     Filed 04/30/25     PageID.10885 \n  P age 6 of 7\n1  members.    EOIR  will  also  further  develop  and  provide  additional  Model  Hearing \n2 \nProgram2 materials to assist with pro bono representation. See Model Hearing Program, \n3 \nImmigration  Court  Online  Resource  found  at  https://icor.eoir.justice.gov/en/model-\n4 \nhearing-program.   \n5 \n13.  At the time that the Court approved this settlement agreement, EOIR allowed \n6 \n7  Friend of the Court services.  See Director’s Memorandum 22-06, Friend of the Court \n8  (May 5, 2022) (rescinded and cancelled).  On February 4, 2025, Acting Director Sirce \n9 \nOwen  rescinded  and  cancelled  Director’s  Memorandum  22-06  and  reinstated  Policy \n10 \nMemorandum 20-05, Legal Advocacy by Non-Representatives in Immigration Court.  See \n11 \nPolicy  Memorandum  25-18,  Cancellation  of  Director’s  Memorandum  22-06  and \n12 \nReinstatement of Policy Memorandum 20-05 (Feb. 4, 2025).  Given that Friend of the \n13 \n14  Court Services are no longer permitted at EOIR, and the settlement states that such \n15 \nservices may be provided “where allowed by the immigration court,” ECF No. 721-1, \n16 \nSection IV.B.2.c.i(a), at 11, EOIR will not manage the provision of such services and \n17 \ninstead will conduct pro bono referrals as described above.  \n18 \nThis declaration is made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  I declare under the penalty  \n19 \nof perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n20 \n21 \n22   \n2  The Model Hearing Program is an educational program by EOIR designed to provide \n23 \nGovernment attorneys, private attorneys, and potential or newly accredited representatives \nwith information about practices and procedures related to advocacy in Immigration \n24 \nCourt.  The program provides substantive and practical Immigration Court training. \n25 \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 768-1     Filed 04/30/25     PageID.10886 \n  P age 7 of 7\n1  Executed on this 30th day of April 2025. \n2  STEPHANIE  Digitally signed by STEPHANIE \n \nGORMAN \nGORMAN\n3  Date: 2025.04.30 14:12:48 -04'00'\n_________________________________________ \n4  Stephanie E.

REGARDING PROVISION OF \nLEGAL SERVICES \n20 \n \n21 \n \n22 \n   \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n        \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 762     Filed 04/23/25     PageID.10733     Page\n2 of 10\n   \n1  MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REGARDING \n2  PROVISION OF LEGAL SERVICES \n3  Plaintiffs respectfully move the Court to enforce the Settlement Agreement in \n4  light of Defendants’ recent actions with regard to legal services.  Specifically, on \n5  Friday, April 11, Defendants abruptly notified the Acacia Center for Justice \n6 \n(“Acacia”), the main contractor that oversees the legal services Program that assists \n7 \nClass Members in their immigration cases, that Defendants do not intend to renew the \n8 \nlegal services contract.  Defendants did not provide class counsel with notification of \n9 \nthe contract nonrenewal decision; and Defendants have not explained the reasons for \n10 \nthe nonrenewal.  Defendants have stated that they intend to continue to provide the \n11 \nlegal services required by the Settlement, but have not provided any details as to how \n12 \nservices will be provided, the scope or adequacy of such services, or how services \n13 \nmay be practically transitioned without delays.  \n14 \nThe current legal services contract is set to expire on April 30, 2025, in one \n15 \nweek.  Expedited relief is necessary because the abrupt and unexplained end of the \n16 \ncurrent services will leave Class Members without the services that they greatly need \n17 \nto exercise their legal rights and relief options under the settlement.   \n18 \nDefendants state in regard to this motion: \n19 \n“Defendants’ position is that based on the limited information class counsel \n20 \nhave provided, the government cannot agree not to oppose a motion to enforce.  Class \n21 \ncounsel’s general citation to a 2.5-page portion of the Settlement, for the first time, on \n22 \nthe morning of filing, without any more specific information, does not provide \n23 \nsufficient time to meet and confer in good faith as required by Section VII.C of the \n24 \nSettlement.”1     \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n1 As provided below at pp. 5-6, Plaintiffs contacted Defendants on April 15, after hearing of the \ntermination of the current Acacia contract, and Defendants clearly understood that Plaintiffs were \n27 \nreferring to a breach of the settlement provisions regarding the provision of legal services at that \n28  time under Section IV.B of the Settlement.  \n1 \n    18cv00428 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 762     Filed 04/23/25     PageID.10734     Page\n3 of 10\n   \n1  ARGUMENT \n2  I.  The Settlement Agreement’s Legal Services Provisions. \n3  The Settlement Agreement provides that Defendants “will provide legal access \n4  and orientation . . .  to specifically focus on Ms. L. Settlement Class members.”  See \n5  Dkt. 721-1 (“Amended Settlement”) at 10, Sec. IV.B.2.c.  The Settlement refers to this \n6 \nlegal access program as “the Program.”   \n7 \nThe Settlement provides that the Program must “provide assistance . . . short of \n8 \nfull representation, including” legal advice, counseling, and consultation concerning \n9 \nimmigration relief; assistance with preparing applications for relief, and Friend of the \n10 \nCourt services (where allowed by the immigration court).  See Amended Settlement, \n11 \nSec. IV.B.2.c.i.a. The Settlement also requires the Program to provide “new resources \n12 \nand orientation presentations” to help Class Members navigate the immigration court \n13 \nand relief application processes.  Id., Sec. IV.B.2.c.i.c. The Settlement also requires \n14 \nthe Program to facilitate pro bono representation for Class Members to leverage \n15 \noutside resources to serve Class Members and their families.  See id., Sec. IV.B.2.c.ii.   \n16 \nCritically, Defendants further agreed to “ensure that the Program is adequately \n17 \nresourced and funded to provide services for all unrepresented Ms. L. Settlement Class \n18 \nmembers, with the ability to increase funding to meet projected needs as determined \n19 \nby Defendants, taking into account information about needs provided by Plaintiffs.”  \n20 \nSee id., Sec. IV.B.2.c.i.(d). \n21 \nThe legal services Program is of critical importance to the Class.  Because of \n22 \nthe complexities of the immigration system, Class Members require substantial \n23 \ncounseling to understand their relief options, as well as the potential immigration \n24 \npathways available to them under the Settlement Agreement’s parole and asylum-\n25 \nrelated provisions.  See Hartman Decl. ¶¶ 4-10; Chadwick Decl. ¶¶ 5-9. Pro se \n26 \nindividuals are ill-equipped to navigate this system on their own.  See, e.g., Salazar-\n27 \nGonzalez v. Lynch, 798 F.3d 917, 922 (9th Cir. 2015) (describing immigration law as \n28 \n2 \n    18cv00428 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 762     Filed 04/23/25     PageID.10735     Page\n4 of 10\n   \n1  “an area of law that ranks just behind the federal tax code in complexity”). \n2  In addition, separated families often face unique challenges.  For example, as \n3  the Court knows, parents were often jammed through the asylum system while \n4  suffering the immediate trauma of their separation, frequently resulting in removal \n5  proceedings where they lacked a fair chance to present their asylum claims.  Children, \n6 \nfor their part, were often put into removal proceedings separate from their parents, \n7 \nwho were critical witnesses or sources of factual information that support their asylum \n8 \nclaims.  Although the Settlement Agreement’s asylum-related provisions were \n9 \nintended, in part, to remedy the effects of the separation on the family’s immigration \n10 \nproceedings, pro se Class Members still face significant difficulties traversing the \n11 \nprocedural and substantive steps required to avail themselves of those procedures. \n12 \nThe parties agreed to Settlement terms concerning the legal services Program in \n13 \nlight of this ongoing concern.  To effectuate their obligations under these Settlement \n14 \nprovisions, Defendants entered into a contract with the Acacia Center for Justice \n15 \n(“Acacia”) in April 2024 to provide a broad spectrum of services to Ms. L. Settlement \n16 \nclass members and their families.  The initial contract was for a one-year renewable \n17 \nterm.  Van Hofwegen Decl., Exhibit A.  Under this main contract, Acacia \n18 \nsubcontracted with nine different regional immigration legal services providers and \n19 \none national pro bono provider throughout the country.  Van Hofwegen Decl. ¶ 6.  \n20 \nUnder these contracts, legal services providers have been working diligently to \n21 \nidentify Class Members, conduct intakes and assessments of their legal needs and \n22 \nrelief options, and provide legal services and pro bono placements for separated \n23 \nfamilies.  Although Acacia’s contract precludes it from providing public information \n24 \nconcerning the number of individuals it has served so far, 2 of the providers estimate \n25 \nthat they have together served over 200 individuals in the year or so that the Program \n26 \nhas been in operation.  Alcaide Decl. ¶¶ 3-5; Farb Decl. ¶ 2. The Program’s legal \n27 \nservices providers are already overstrained, given the numerous Class Members who \n28 \n3 \n    18cv00428 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 762     Filed 04/23/25     PageID.10736     Page\n5 of 10\n   \n1  are currently unrepresented in their immigration or removal cases.  Alcaide Decl. ¶6; \n2  Farb Decl. ¶ 4; Hartman Decl. ¶¶ 4-10; Chadwick Decl. ¶ 10.  Towards the end of \n3  2024 and early 2025, the Program’s providers had to stop accepting new cases to \n4  ensure that they could provide adequate services to their existing clients.  Alcaide \n5  Decl. ¶ 6; Farb Decl. ¶ 4; Chadwick Decl. ¶ 10; Hartman Decl. ¶ 11(a).   \n6 \nTermination, even for a short period of time, of legal services, would be a clear \n7 \nbreach of the terms of the Settlement Agreement, as would any decrease in the level of \n8 \nservices.  The Agreement requires Defendants to “ensure that the Program is \n9 \nadequately resourced and funded to provide services for all unrepresented Ms. L. \n10 \nSettlement Class members[.]”  Amended Settlement Agreement, Sec. IV.B.2.c.i.(d).  \n11 \nIndeed, the Settlement Agreement specifically contemplates that Defendants may need \n12 \nto “increase funding to meet projected needs,” which Defendants should do to meet \n13 \nthe current gap in legal services.  Id.   \n14 \nPlaintiffs’ concern about the government actions, and lack of explanation, come \n15 \non the heels of increased cuts to immigration legal services.  In the last few weeks, \n16 \nDefendants have taken aggressive action to terminate or non-renew a variety of legal \n17 \nservices programs that work with noncitizens in the immigration system, including \n18 \ntwo programs that provide legal representation to unaccompanied children and the \n19 \nImmigration Court Help Desk.  See, e.g., Cmty. Legal Servs. in E. Palo Alto v. United \n20 \nStates Dep't of Health & Hum. Servs., No. 25-CV-02847-AMO, 2025 WL 973318, at \n21 \n*1 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2025) (granting TRO to block “termination of funding for \n22 \ncounsel representing unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings”), appeal \n23 \nfiled Apr. 11, 2025; Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for TRO, \n24 \nAmica Center for Immigrant Rights, et al., v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 25-cv-00298-RDM \n25 \n(D.D.C. Apr. 14, 2025), Dkt. 53-1 (addressing termination of multiple legal services \n26 \nprograms, including Immigration Court Help Desk).   \n27 \nAlthough Plaintiffs are not seeking relief concerning those other programs via \n28 \n4 \n    18cv00428 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 762     Filed 04/23/25     PageID.10737     Page\n6 of 10\n   \n1  this Motion, Plaintiffs note that the termination of these programs may have \n2  significant effects on Ms. L. Class Members.  Chadwick Decl. ¶¶ 12-13; Hartman \n3  Decl. ¶¶ 1, 11(b), 12. As the Court knows, Defendants generally designated children \n4  as “unaccompanied” after forcibly separating them, and therefore providers working \n5  with unaccompanied children took on many Class Members’ immigration cases.  In \n6 \naddition, the Settlement contemplates that some of the services the Ms. L. Program \n7 \nprovides build on existing Immigration Court Help Desk systems.  See Amended \n8 \nSettlement, Sec. IV.B.2.c.i.(a)-(b).  If Defendants succeed in terminating these other \n9 \nlegal services programs, even more Ms. L. Class Member families will be without \n10 \nlegal assistance.   \n11 \nII.  Expedited Relief Is Necessary to Prevent Irreparable Harm to the \n12 \nClass. \n13 \nIn the spring of 2025, Acacia Center for Justice was awaiting confirmation from \n14 \nDefendants that they would exercise their option to renew the contract, as expected.  \n15 \nHowever, on Friday, April 11, 2025, Acacia Center for Justice received a notification \n16 \nthat the government did not intend to renew the contract.  Van Hofwegen Decl., \n17 \nExhibit B. The contract will end on April 30, 2025. \n18 \nLegal services providers have already relied on the expected continuation of the \n19 \nProgram, developing waitlists to triage limited resources, and assuring class members \n20 \nlegal services would be available upon renewal.  Farb Decl. ¶ 4; Alcaide Decl. ¶ 6.  \n21 \nAcacia has already had to inform their legal services subcontractors about the non-\n22 \nrenewal. And although the contract will not expire until the end of the month, \n23 \nDefendants’ actions are already having the effect of disrupting legal services, and \n24 \ncreating fear from those waiting for help that none will come in time, or will cause \n25 \nbeneficiaries to miss deadlines.  Alcaide Decl. ¶ 10.  Absent the contract, the legal \n26 \nservices subcontractors have no choice but to stop services altogether.   \n27 \nDefendants’ plan as to how to replace the legal services (as well as the \n28 \n5 \n    18cv00428 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 762     Filed 04/23/25     PageID.10738     Page\n7 of 10\n   \n1  adequacy of such a plan) has not been communicated.  On April 15, Plaintiffs \n2  contacted Defendants’ counsel about the termination of the Acacia contract, \n3  specifically stating that termination of legal services would violate provisions of the \n4  Agreement guaranteeing such services.  On April 18, Counsel for Defendants stated \n5  they were “looking into” it and “expected to get back … soon.”  On April 21, \n6 \nDefendants stated that: \n7  “The Ms. L. Settlement Agreement does not require EOIR to contract \nwith any particular organization.  EOIR informs us that, regardless of \n8 \nwhat happens to the Acacia contract, EOIR will provide the services it \n9  is required to provide, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.  \n \n10 \nEOIR further informs us that it has no intention of ending, and does \n11  not plan for a lapse in, services required under the settlement.  EOIR \nrespectfully disagrees with ACLU’s understanding that “lapse in the \n12 \ncontract” constitutes a breach of the settlement.”   \n13 \nOn April 22, Plaintiffs communicated that, absent details about how legal services \n14 \nwould be implemented, they would need to move the Court.  Defendants subsequently \n15 \nstated, without further detail, that: \n16  “At the termination of the Acacia contract, EOIR intends to facilitate a \nlegal access and orientation program which implements the provision \n17  of all EOIR-required services set forth in the Settlement Agreement.” \n \n18 \nPlaintiffs reiterated that they needed to know details, including when the services \n19 \nwill start, what services will be provided, what “facilitate” means, and how \n20 \nDefendants will avoid delay in providing services after having cancelled the contract \n21 \nwith notice or explanation, and that without sufficient clarity, they would need to \n22 \nalert the court at 9 AM PST today.   Defendants communicated that it was not clear \n23 \nthat there was any breach or noncompliance with the Agreement, and provided their \n24 \nposition on Plaintiffs’ intention to file the instant motion as set forth above.   \n25 \nAs of the filing of this motion, Defendants have not provided any further \n26 \ninformation in response to Plaintiffs’ queries as to the plan for services.   \n27 \nThe Settlement Agreement’s Dispute-Resolution process requires the parties to \n28 \n6 \n    18cv00428 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 762     Filed 04/23/25     PageID.10739     Page\n8 of 10\n   \n1  initially meet and confer to resolve disputes, with the party responding to allegations \n2  of a breach of settlement with thirty days.  Settlement at Sec. VII.C.  The timeline, \n3  however, has prevented Plaintiffs from following this process.  Defendants’ \n4  nonrenewal of the legal services contract occurred on April 11th, less than 30 days \n5  before the provided services would end.  To date, Plaintiffs have still not been \n6 \ninformed as to how services will be provided in the absence of the contract.  Class \n7 \nmembers have relied on the legal services structure to access basic rights under the \n8 \nsettlement and, in the absence, diminishment, or any delay in continuation of services, \n9 \nwill face harm.   \n10 \nCONCLUSION \n11 \n  For these reasons, the Court should grant this Motion.  \n12 \nDATED: April 23, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \n13 \n \n14  /s/ Lee Gelernt \nLee Gelernt* \n15 \nDaniel A.

The class members’ identities are known to \n26 \nall parties.  \n2 M.A.J.’s age had been the subject of discussion at the June 27 hearing. Plaintiffs’ counsel followed \n27 \nup with Defendants after that hearing to resolve any uncertainty as to M.A.J.’s age; Defendants have \n28  since confirmed he is 13.  \n1 \n    18cv00428 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 813     Filed 07/09/25     PageID.11687     Page\n3 of 6\n   \n1   It appears not all relevant ICE personnel had received the Court’s \n2  Order until June 30. However, ICE informs DOJ that, as of June 30, ICE \n3  has taken steps to immediately implement the Order. \n4   \n5  Regarding [M.A.J.] and his family, ICE informs us that ICE’s \n6 \nsystems show that his mother reported to ICE in April 2024 that she \n7 \nwould like to return to Guatemala and agreed with ICE’s plans to \n8 \nfacilitate a removal flight. \n9 \n \n10 \nThat same day, Plaintiffs’ counsel re-raised their request that Defendants answer why \n11 \nA.M.R.F. was taken into custody and the basis for his removal. On July 7, having \n12 \nreceived no response, Plaintiffs’ counsel made that same request and notified \n13 \nDefendants that they would ask the Court to order a response if none had been \n14 \nreceived by 9 a.m. PT July 8.   \n15 \nIn light of the above, and as Plaintiffs further investigate both removals, \n16 \nPlaintiffs request that the Court order the following:  \n17 \nAs to M.A.J. \n18 \n-  Order that Defendants identify whether any Ms. L QAFMs were removed \n19 \nwith M.A.J., aside from M.A.J.’s mother.  Plaintiffs first raised on June 27 \n20 \nwhether there were undisclosed QAFMs detained with M.A.J. and have not \n21 \nreceived an answer as to two other family members that Defendants have \n22 \nsaid were removed. \n23 \n-  Order that Defendants explain in full their reason for removing M.A.J. and \n24 \nhis family, including by requiring Defendants to file any and all \n25 \ndocumentation and notes explaining the family’s recent detention and \n26 \nremoval.

Lee Gelernt and Daniel Galindo appeared for Plaintiffs, and Daniel Schutrum-\n28  Boward and Cara Alsterberg appeared for Defendants.  After full consideration of the \n1 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11868     Page\n2 of 13\n \n1  parties’ arguments, the record, and the relevant case law, and for the reasons set out below, \n2  the Court denies Defendants’ motion for temporary relief from the Court’s Order requiring \n3  reinstatement of the Acacia Task Order, denies Defendants’ motion for temporary relief \n4  from  Court  order,  and  grants  Plaintiffs’  motion  to  enforce  the  settlement  agreement \n5  regarding the provision of services. \n6  I. \n7  BACKGROUND \n8    On June 10, 2025, this Court found Defendants in breach of the parties’ Settlement \n9  Agreement in this case, specifically, the sections regarding the provision of legal services \n10  to Class Members.  (See ECF No. 795.)  To remedy that breach, the Court ordered \n11  Defendants to reinstate their Legal Access Services for Reunified Families (“LASRF”) task \n12  order  with  Acacia  so  it  could  provide  the  necessary  legal  services,  and  set  a  status \n13  conference for June 27, 2025.  (Id. at 17-19.)   \n14    Defendants did not comply with the Court’s order to reinstate the task order with \n15  Acacia.  Instead, in the parties’ Joint Status Report filed on June 25, 2025, Defendants \n16  informed the Court they would be filing a motion for relief from the order pursuant to \n17  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).  (ECF No. 800 at 2-3.)  Defendants stated that if the \n18  Court granted that motion, the Government would “solicit a Request for Information, to \n19  include a Statement of Work, that [would] allow it to collect written information about the \n20  capabilities of vendors in the marketplace to offer immigration legal services, followed by \n21  a Request for Quote.”  (Id. at 2.)   \n22    Following the June 27, 2025 status conference, the Court issued an order directing \n23  Defendants to provide Acacia with a term sheet concerning renewal or reissue of the \n24  LASRF task order on or before July 1, 2025, at 5:00 p.m.  On that date, defense counsel \n25  sent an email to Sara Van Hofwegen, the Managing Director at Acacia Center for Justice, \n26  attaching a “nonbinding” term sheet, informing Ms. Van Hofwegen that “the Government \n27  intends to seek relief from the Court’s requirement that it reinstate any Task Order with \n28  Acacia” and that it “would like to pursue potential engagement with alternative vendors to \n2 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11869     Page\n3 of 13\n \n1  provide the legal services required under” the Settlement Agreement.  (Fifth Supp. Decl. \n2  of Sara Van Hofwegen in Supp. of Opp’n to Rule 60(b) Mot. Regarding the Provision of \n3  Legal Services (“Van Hofwegen Decl.”), Ex. A, ECF No. 818-1.)  Ms. Van Hofwegen \n4  informed defense counsel that Acacia could not “engage in any substantive conversation \n5  with DOJ’s trial counsel or take any action with respect to the proposed term sheet trial \n6  counsel provided without receiving communication from [Acacia’s] Contracting Officer.”  \n7  (Van Hofwegen Decl. ¶ 14.)  Acacia did not receive a response from defense counsel and \n8  had not received a response from Acacia’s Contracting Officer as of the filing of Ms. Van \n9  Hofwegen’s Declaration on July 11, 2025.  (Id. ¶¶ 14, 16.)   \n10    While the parties and the Court were dealing with the issue of the legal services \n11  provisions of the Settlement Agreement, and just a few hours before the Court issued its \n12  June 10, 2025 Order finding Defendants in breach of those provisions, another issue arose \n13  with  the  Settlement  Agreement.    That  issue  concerned  the  Settlement  Agreement’s \n14  requirements that Defendants provide Class Members with behavioral health services, \n15  assistance with certain medical costs, and housing support.  Until June 9, 2025, the United \n16  States Department of Health and Human Services, which is a named Defendant in this case \n17  and a party to the Settlement Agreement, had a contract with Seneca Family of Agencies \n18  to provide those services.  As with the Government’s contract with Acacia, however, the \n19  Government decided not to exercise its option to renew its contract with Seneca and instead \n20  allowed that contract to lapse.  In light of that decision, Defendants filed a separate Motion \n21  for  Temporary  Relief  from  Court  Order  Pursuant  to  Rule 60(b)  asking  the  Court  to \n22  “temporarily suspend” those sections of the Settlement Agreement requiring Defendants \n23  to provide these additional services to Class Members.  Plaintiffs then filed their own \n24  motion to enforce those Settlement Agreement provisions.   \n25  II. \n26  DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS \n27    Both  of  Defendants’  motions  are  brought  pursuant  to  Federal  Rules  of  Civil \n28  Procedure 60(b)(5) and 60(b)(6).  Under Rule 60(b)(5), a court may relieve a party from a \n3 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11870     Page\n4 of 13\n \n1  final judgment, order, or proceeding if “the judgment has been satisfied, released, or \n2  discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying \n3  it prospectively is no longer equitable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5).  Under Rule 60(b)(6), \n4  relief is available for “any other reason.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).   \n5    Here, Defendants rely on the final clause of Rule 60(b)(5), which provides for relief \n6  if applying the judgment or order “prospectively is no longer equitable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n7  60(b)(5).  This Rule “may not be used to challenge the legal conclusions on which a prior \n8  judgment or order rests, but the Rule provides a means by which a party can ask a court to \n9  modify or vacate a judgment or order if ‘a significant change either in factual conditions \n10  or in law’ renders continued enforcement ‘detrimental to the public interest.’”  Horne v. \n11  Flores, 557 U.S. 443, 447 (2009) (quoting Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. \n12  367, 384 (1992)).  “Once a moving party has met its burden of establishing either a change \n13  in  fact or law warranting modification  of  a  consent decree, the  district  court  should \n14  determine  whether  the  proposed  modification  is  suitably  tailored  to  the  changed \n15  circumstance.”  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391.   \n16    Rule 60(b)(6) “is a catchall that … covers ‘any other reason’ that justifies relief; that \n17  is, Rule 60(b)(6) provides only grounds for relief not already covered by the preceding five \n18  paragraphs.”  BLOM Bank SOL v. Honickman, 605 U.S. ___, 145 S.Ct. 1612, 1619 (2025).  \n19  The Supreme Court has “consistently reaffirmed that Rule 60(b)(6) ‘should only be applied \n20  in  extraordinary  circumstances.’”    Id.  at  1620  (quoting  Liljeberg  v.  Health  Services \n21  Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 864 (1988)).  “’This very strict interpretation of Rule \n22  60(b) is essential if the finality of judgments is to be preserved.’”  Id. (quoting Gonzalez v. \n23  Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 535 (2005)).   \n24  A.  Motion for Temporary Relief from Court Order Requiring Reinstatement of \nAcacia Task  Order \n25 \n \n26  The Court turns first to Defendants’ motion for relief from the Court’s June 10, 2025 \n27  Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement Regarding \n28  Provision of Legal Services, which required Defendants to reinstate their task order with \n4 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11871     Page\n5 of 13\n \n1  Acacia.  (See ECF No. 795.)  Defendants argue they are entitled to relief from this Order \n2  under Rule 60(b)(5) because of two significant changes in factual conditions.   \n3  The first significant change, according to Defendants, is “an unfavorable cost-to-\n4  output ratio at the taxpayer’s expense.”  (Mot. at 4, ECF No. 809.)  According to Sirce \n5  Owen,  the  Acting  Director  of  the  Executive  Office  for  Immigration  Review,  Acacia \n6  charged  the  Government  $4,605,843.86  under  the  previous  task  order  in  program \n7  management support costs, direct costs, and legal services.  (Decl. of Sirce Owen ¶¶3-4, \n8  ECF No. 809-1.)  That amount averages out to approximately $3,841 per individual served \n9  by the task order.  (See id. ¶ 4) (stating 1,199 Class Members and QAFMs received \n10  assistance under the task order).  Notably, Ms. Owen does not state this cost-to-output ratio \n11  was “unfavorable.”  Indeed, there is no evidence in the record to that effect.   \n12  On the contrary, the evidence reflects the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) negotiated \n13  and agreed with Acacia on the pricing structure for the task order.  (Van Hofwegen Decl. \n14  ¶¶ 5-9.)  During those negotiations, the DOJ decided to use a “firm fixed price” model, and \n15  the parties negotiated a set price for the services to be provided.  (Id. ¶ 6-7.)  Under the \n16  terms of the contract, the DOJ agreed to pay Acacia a flat fee to provide legal services to a \n17  base number of participants (785), and a flat rate for each additional participant above that \n18  number.  (Id. ¶ 7.)  Pursuant to the terms of the contract, Acacia notified the Government \n19  when it reached certain benchmarks, (id. ¶ 8), and on January 13, 2025 (one week before \n20  the change in presidential administration), it also gave the Government an estimate of when \n21  it would reach the baseline number and how many additional participants it expected to \n22  serve.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  At no time during the term of the contract did any government official \n23  express concerns about those additional anticipated costs.  (Id.)  Despite Defendants’ \n24  argument, they have failed to provide any evidence of a significant change in factual \n25  conditions such that applying the Court’s June 10, 2025 Order “is no longer equitable.”   \n26  Defendants also argue “the recent change in administration and implementation of \n27  new policy directives” constitutes a “significant change” such that application of the \n28  Court’s June 10, 2025 Order “is no longer equitable.”  (Reply at 1, ECF No. 823.)  Notably, \n5 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11872     Page\n6 of 13\n \n1  Defendants fail to cite any authority to support this argument, and at least one other court \n2  has rejected it.  See Center for Biological Diversity v. Environmental Protection Agency, \n3  No. 11-cv-00293-JCS, 2025 WL 901944 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2025).  In that case, the \n4  Government  requested  to  modify  a  stipulated  settlement  agreement to  extend  certain \n5  deadlines contained therein.  Id. at *1.  One of the bases for that request was a change in \n6  presidential administration.  Id. at *6.  There, like here, the court noted the Government \n7  failed  to  cite  “any  authority  that  suggests  that  a  change  in  administration,  by  itself, \n8  constitutes good cause or offers an equitable reason sufficient to justify modifying the \n9  terms of a settlement agreement under Rule 60(b)(5).”  Id. at *8.  The court reasoned that \n10  if courts were:  \n11  to adopt such an approach, it would mean, essentially, that parties could not \nenter into settlement agreements or consent decrees with an agency of the \n12 \nUnited States that spanned more than one administration as they could not \n13  count on adherence to the terms of the settlement agreement by subsequent \nadministrations.   \n14 \n \n15  Id.  According to the court, that would run counter the Government’s “long history of \n16  entering into consent decrees that bind future administrations, and of abiding by those \n17  agreements.”  Id.  That reasoning applies squarely here, and leads this Court to the same \n18  conclusion, namely that a change in presidential administration does not constitute the sort \n19  of “significant change” in either fact or law sufficient to show that prospective application \n20  of a court order “is no longer equitable.” \n21    Failing relief under Rule 60(b)(5), Defendants argue they are entitled to relief under \n22  Rule 60(b)(6) because “potentially uneconomical spending of public funds is unjust and \n23  should not be required.”  (Mot. at 5, ECF No. 809.)  This is a different shade of Defendants’ \n24  “cost-to-output ratio” argument raised above under Rule 60(b)(5), and thus it cannot serve \n25  as the basis for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See BLOM Bank SAL, 145 S.Ct. at 1619 (stating \n26  “Rule 60(b)(6) provides only grounds for relief not already covered by the preceding five \n27  paragraphs.”)   \n28  / / / \n6 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11873     Page\n7 of 13\n \n1    Defendants also argue they are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(6) because “[i]f \n2  the judicial process were to require the Government to use a specific vendor instead of \n3  allowing it to participate in an open competitive process, the public’s confidence [in the \n4  judicial process] may be comprised.”  (Mot. at 5, ECF No. 809.)  But this argument is a red \n5  herring.  Contrary to Defendants’ argument, there is nothing in the Court’s June 10, 2025 \n6  order that prohibits Defendants from participating in “an open competitive process” to find \n7  a contractor to fulfill Defendants’ obligations under the legal services provisions of the \n8  Settlement Agreement.  Defendants are, and have been, free to engage in that process.  On \n9  that point there is no dispute.  What Defendants are not free to do, however, is ignore their \n10  obligations to provide the legal services promised in the Settlement Agreement.   \n11  The Court’s order directing Defendants to reinstate their task order with Acacia was \n12  the result of Defendants’ breach of those contractual obligations.  It was not an order, in \n13  the abstract, directing Defendants to contract with a specific vendor instead of using the \n14  competitive bidding process.  In that context, it is hard to see how providing a remedy for \n15  a breach of a settlement agreement would undermine the public’s confidence in the judicial \n16  process, particularly when Defendants did not propose an alternative remedy in their \n17  briefing or argument on Plaintiffs’ motion.1  On the contrary, the Court’s finding of breach \n18  and provision of a remedy for that breach should hopefully serve to affirm the public’s \n19  confidence in the judicial process as a means of upholding and enforcing contractual rights.   \n20    Because Defendants have not shown they are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(5) \n21  or 60(b)(6), their motion for temporary relief from the Court’s June 10, 2025 Order is \n22  denied. \n23 \n \n24 \n25  1    In  their  opposition  to  Plaintiffs’  motion,  Defendants  requested  an  “opportunity to \naddress” any breach “without reverted [sic] to the prior contract [with Acacia].”  (Opp’n to \n26 \nRenewed  Mot.  to  Enforce  Settlement  Agreement  at 11,  ECF  No.  774.)    This  vague \n27  suggestion does not set out an alternative remedy.  It simply would have given Defendants \ncarte blanche to remain in breach of the Settlement Agreement, which is not an acceptable \n28 \nresult.   \n7 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11874     Page\n8 of 13\n \n1  B.  Motion for Temporary Relief from Court Order \n2    Defendants’ other Rule 60(b) motion is directed to the Court’s December 11, 2023 \n3  Order Granting Final Approval of Settlement Agreement and Certifying the Settlement \n4  Classes.  (See ECF No. 727.)  In this motion, Defendants request that the Court temporarily \n5  suspend sections IV.B.2.a., IV.B.2.b., and IV.B.2.d. of the Settlement Agreement, which \n6  govern the provision of behavioral health services, assistance with certain medical costs, \n7  and housing support, respectively, while Defendants complete the re-solicitation process \n8  to find a replacement for Seneca.   \n9    In support of this motion, Defendants rely primarily on the “no longer equitable” \n10  provision of Rule 60(b)(5).  (Mot. at 6, ECF No. 792.)  Although their argument is framed \n11  in various and sundry ways, at its core it relies on Executive Order 14151, “Ending Radical \n12  and  Wasteful  Government  DEI  Programs  and  Preferencing,”  which  was  signed  by \n13  President Trump on January 20, 2025.  Exec. Order 14151, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, \n14  2025).  This EO orders department heads to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by \n15  law, … all ‘equity action plans,’ ‘equity’ actions, initiatives, or programs, ‘equity-related’ \n16  grants  or  contracts,  and  all  DEI  or  DEIA  performance  requirements  for  employees, \n17  contractors, or grantees.”  Id.   \n18  It is not at all clear that this EO would apply to the Seneca contract, but even if it \n19  did, it does not constitute a change in law sufficient to warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(5).  \n20  Although a legislative change “may justify modifying or terminating a consent decree if \n21  the new law makes complying with the consent decree ‘impermissible,’ or, … ‘make[s] \n22  legal what the decree was designed to prevent[,]’” Flores v. Rosen, 984 F.3d 720, 741 (9th \n23  Cir. 2020) (quoting Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388), the executive branch cannot “unilaterally create \n24  the change in law that it then offers as the reason it should be excused from compliance \n25  with a consent decree.”  Id.  Thus, the EO does not provide a basis for the relief Defendants \n26  seek. \n27  Defendants also argue Seneca’s alleged violation of federal civil rights laws is a \n28  change in fact sufficient to warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(5).  The Court disagrees for two \n8 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11875     Page\n9 of 13\n \n1  reasons.    First,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  referral  of  Seneca  to  the \n2  Department of Labor is not a finding that Seneca has violated any law.  It is simply a \n3  referral, and nothing more.  Second, the factual basis of the referral, namely Seneca’s \n4  website, (Mot., Ex. A, n.4), was available to Defendants before they entered into the \n5  contract with Seneca.  (See Decl. of Leticia Galyean Sturtevant ¶ 9) (stating webpage cited \n6  in referral letter has been in existence since October 2020).  This evidence reflects that \n7  Seneca’s  conduct  has  not  changed  since  the  Settlement  Agreement  was  signed  and \n8  approved.  The only thing that has changed is Defendants’ interpretation of that conduct \n9  based on the EO.  (Reply at 5) (stating motion is not based on change in interpretation of \n10  law but is based on EO).  As stated above, however, the EO is not a proper basis for relief \n11  under Rule 60(b)(5).2 \n12  Absent relief under Rule 60(b)(5), Defendants turn to Rule 60(b)(6).  Here, they \n13  argue Seneca’s “potential violation of anti-discrimination civil rights laws constitutes \n14  ‘extraordinary circumstances’ supporting temporary relief under Rule 60(b)(6).”  (Mot. at \n15  7.)  This is the same argument Defendants raised under Rule 60(b)(5), and as stated above, \n16  it cannot also be used to request relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See BLOM Bank SAL, 145 \n17  S.Ct. at 1619 (stating “Rule 60(b)(6) provides only grounds for relief not already covered \n18  by the preceding five paragraphs.”)  \n19    Because Defendants have not shown they are entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(5) \n20  or 60(b)(6), their motion for temporary relief from sections IV.B.2.a., b., and d. of the \n21  Settlement Agreement is denied.   \n22 \n23   \n24 \n2  In their reply brief, Defendants also suggested that under Rule 60(b)(5), the Court should \n25  consider whether the objectives of the Settlement Agreement have been achieved.  (Reply \nat 3.)  Defendants did not raise this issue in their motion, and thus the Court need not \n26 \nconsider it here.  See Zamani v. Carnes, 491 F.3d 990, 997 (9th Cir. 2007) (stating district \n27  court “need not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.”)  Even if the \nCourt were to  consider  it,  Defendants have not  made  the  requisite  showing that  the \n28 \nobjectives of the Settlement Agreement have been satisfied. \n9 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11876     Page\n10 of 13\n \n1  III. \n2  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n3    The  only  remaining  motion  at  issue  is  Plaintiffs’  motion  to  enforce  sections \n4  IV.B.2.a., b., and d. of the Settlement Agreement.  The Court set out the legal standard for \n5  this motion in its June 10, 2025 Order, and incorporates that standard here.   \n6    On the merits, Defendants do not dispute they are in breach of these provisions.  (See \n7  Decl. of Brian Goodger ¶ 16, ECF No. 792-2) (stating Defendants “will be unable to  \n8  comply” with these sections of the Settlement Agreement while they are engaged in the re-\n9  solicitation process).  In light of that concession, the Court finds Defendants are in breach.3 \n10  The only remaining issue is the remedy.  On that issue, Plaintiffs request the Court \n11  order Defendants to take all reasonable steps to expeditiously re-contract with Seneca to \n12  provide the necessary services for at least a one-year term, or if Defendants wish to pursue \n13  re-solicitation of the contract with another provider, a point Plaintiffs do not dispute, that \n14  Seneca’s contract “continue unless and until Defendants award and are able to begin such \n15  a  new  contract  that  meets  the  terms  of  the  Settlement  Agreement[.]”    (Mot.  at  5.)  \n16  Defendants argue this relief is unnecessary because the agreement to provide behavioral \n17  health services does not expire until December 10, 2030, and the agreement to provide \n18  copayment assistance is limited to a 12-month term, therefore that assistance can also be \n19  provided before the Settlement Agreement’s expiration date.4   \n20 \n21   \n22 \n3  Defendants urge the Court not to make a finding of breach, arguing their concession is \n23  sufficient.  But a concession of breach does not have the same force or effect as a Court \norder.  Accordingly, pursuant to Plaintiffs’ request and in light of Defendants’ concession, \n24 \nthe Court finds Defendants are in breach of these provisions.   \n25  4  On the housing assistance, Defendants assert that assistance was not implemented \nthrough the Seneca contract.  (Opp’n to Mot. at 5 n.2.)  However, Ms. Sturtevant, Seneca’s \n26 \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, states that since 2020 Seneca has provided housing \n27  assistance and referrals for 855 separated families.  (Sturtevant Decl. ¶ 5.)  Because \nDefendants have not produced any evidence to rebut Ms. Sturtevant’s Declaration, the \n28 \nCourt finds the housing assistance provision is at issue here.   \n10 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11877     Page\n11 of 13\n \n1  As set out in the Court’s June 10, 2025 Order, the Settlement Agreement gives the \n2  Court “the power to award such relief and issue such judgments as the Court deems \n3  necessary for enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.”  (Settlement Agreement at 43, \n4  ECF No. 721-2.)  The relief Plaintiffs request falls within the scope of the Court’s power, \n5  and is necessary to fulfill the Settlement Agreement’s terms and objectives.  As the Court \n6  stated at the final approval hearing, the family separation policy at issue in this case was \n7  “one of the most shameful chapters in the history of our country[.]”  (ECF No. 732 at 9.)  \n8  It forced the separation of thousands of immigrant parents from their children, many of \n9  whom have yet to be reunified, and it caused profound, devastating, and lasting damage to \n10  those  families.    The  Settlement  Agreement,  which  was  the  result  of  painstaking \n11  negotiations between Plaintiffs and the Government, aimed to address that damage by \n12  providing these families with certain services at the Government’s expense, including the \n13  behavioral health services, assistance with certain medical costs, and housing assistance at \n14  issue here.  To comply with those obligations, the Government contracted with Seneca, \n15  and until June 9, 2025, the Government, through its contract with Seneca, was providing \n16  those services to Class Members.  Although the Government was certainly within its rights \n17  to not renew the Seneca contract, its decision to do so does not excuse its obligations under \n18  the Settlement Agreement.  Those obligations continue regardless, and Defendants must \n19  comply with them.   \n20  As  with  Plaintiffs’  previous  motion  to  enforce  the  Settlement  Agreement’s \n21  provisions regarding legal services, Defendants do not propose an alternative remedy for \n22  their admitted breach.  They simply request that the Court allow them to continue in breach \n23  until they have a new contractor or service provider to fill the void left by Seneca’s absence.  \n24  That is not acceptable, especially since Defendants could have started the re-solicitation \n25  process before deciding not to renew Seneca’s contract, and thereby avoided this lapse in \n26  services.  Given that some of these families may have been separated more than eight years \n27  ago, the sheer number of Class Members entitled to receive these services, the length of \n28  time  it  has  taken  and  will  take  to  deliver  these  services,  and  that  Defendants  have \n11 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11878     Page\n12 of 13\n \n1  admittedly been in breach of these provisions since June 10, 2025, Defendants must comply \n2  with their obligations now, not when they have completed the re-solicitation process.  Thus, \n3  to enforce these provisions of the Settlement Agreement, the Court orders Defendants to \n4  re-contract with Seneca to provide the services at issue here.   \n5  IV. \n6  CONCLUSION \n7    For the reasons set out above, the Court denies Defendants’ motion for temporary \n8  relief from the Court’s June 10, 2025 order requiring reinstatement of the Acacia task order.  \n9  On or before August 25, 2025, Defendants, through the appropriate contracting officer, \n10  shall negotiate and complete a new task order with Acacia to resume the provision of legal \n11  services under the Settlement Agreement.  Defendants’ motion for temporary relief from \n12  sections IV.B.2.a., b., and d. of the Settlement Agreement is also denied.  Plaintiffs’ motion \n13  to enforce the Settlement Agreement regarding the provision of services is granted.  On or \n14  before August 25, 2025, Defendants shall re-contract with Seneca to provide the services \n15  set out in sections IV.B.2.a., b., and d. of the Settlement Agreement.  That contract shall \n16  have a minimum one-year term, or shall continue unless and until Defendants award and \n17  begin a contract with a new service provider to provide these services in a manner that \n18  satisfies the terms and objectives of the Settlement Agreement.   \n19  Consistent with the Court’s prior orders, and given the Court’s “power to award such \n20  relief and issue such judgments as the Court deems necessary for enforcement of the \n21  Settlement  Agreement[,]”  (Settlement  Agreement  at  43,  ECF  No.  721-2),  the  Court \n22  continues its order requiring the Government to inform Plaintiffs’ counsel within 24 hours \n23  if it detains a member of the Ms. L. Class or other QAFMs defined in the Settlement \n24  Agreement.  The information provided to Plaintiffs’ counsel shall include, but is not limited \n25  to, the identity of the detained person, their A-file number, and place of detention.  Counsel \n26  shall also meet and confer on whether the deadlines in the Settlement Agreement should \n27  be extended in light of Defendants’ breaches and the Court’s remedies stated herein.   \n28 \n12 \n18cv0428 DMS (AHG) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG     Document 831     Filed 07/24/25     PageID.11879     Page\n13 of 13\n \n1    The Court sets a status conference for August 1, 2025, at 1:30 p.m. to discuss the \n2  parties’ progress in meeting their obligations under the Settlement Agreement and the \n3  Court’s Orders.  The parties shall file a Joint Status Report on that progress or before July \n4  30, 2025.   \n5    IT IS SO ORDERED.5 \n6  Dated:  July 24, 2025 \n7 \n8 \n \n9 \n   \n10 \n \n11 \n   \n12 \n   \n13 \n \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25   \n26 \n5 In light of this Order, the Court denies as moot Plaintiffs’ Motion for Immediate Relief \n27  and Notice of Additional Proposed Orders.

MOTION FOR CLASSWIDE \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n14  U.S Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”); et al., \n15 \nRespondents-Defendants. \n16 \n \n17 \n  Eleven weeks ago, Plaintiffs leveled the serious accusation that our Government was \n18 \nengaged  in  a  widespread  practice  of  separating  migrant  families,  and  placing  minor \n19 \nchildren  who  were  separated  from  their  parents  in  government  facilities  for \n20 \n“unaccompanied  minors.”    According  to  Plaintiffs,  the  practice  was  applied \n21 \nindiscriminately, and separated even those families with small children and infants—many \n22 \nof whom were seeking asylum.  Plaintiffs noted reports that the practice would become \n23 \nnational policy.  Recent events confirm these allegations.  Extraordinary relief is requested, \n24 \nand is warranted under the circumstances. \n25 \n  On May 7, 2018, the Attorney General of the United States announced a “zero \n26 \ntolerance policy,” under which all adults entering the United States illegally would be \n27 \nsubject to criminal prosecution, and if accompanied by a minor child, the child would be \n28 \n1 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1725   Page 2 of 24\n \n1  separated from the parent.1  Over the ensuing weeks, hundreds of migrant children were \n2  separated from their parents, sparking international condemnation of the practice.  Six days \n3  ago on June 20, 2018, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order (“EO”) \n4  to address the situation and to require preservation of the “family unit” by keeping migrant \n5  families together during criminal and immigration proceedings to the extent permitted by \n6  law, while also maintaining “rigorous[]” enforcement of immigration laws.  See Executive \n7  Order, Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation § 1, 2018 WL \n8  3046068  (June  20,  2018).    The  EO  did  not  address  reunification  of  the  burgeoning \n9  population of over 2,000 children separated from their parents.  Public outrage remained \n10  at a fever pitch.  Three days ago on Saturday, June 23, 2018, the Department of Homeland \n11  Security (“DHS”) issued a “Fact Sheet” outlining the government’s efforts to “ensure that \n12  those adults who are subject to removal are reunited with their children for the purposes of \n13  removal.”2   \n14    Plaintiffs assert the EO does not eliminate the need for the requested injunction, and \n15  the Fact Sheet does not address the circumstances of this case.  Defendants disagree with \n16  those assertions, but there is no genuine dispute that the Government was not prepared to \n17  accommodate the mass influx of separated children.  Measures were not in place to provide \n18  for communication between governmental agencies responsible for detaining parents and \n19  those responsible for housing children, or to provide for ready communication between \n20  separated parents and children.  There was no reunification plan in place, and families have \n21  been separated for months.   Some parents were deported at separate times and from \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n1  See U.S. Att’y. Gen., Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks Discussing the \n24 \nImmigration  Enforcement  Actions  of  the  Trump  Administration  (May  7,  2018), \n25  https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-\ndiscussing-immigration-enforcement-actions.   \n26 \n2  See U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Fact Sheet: Federal Regulations Protecting the \n27  Confidentiality  of  Asylum  Applicants  (June  23,  2018), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/06/23/fact-sheet-zero-tolerance-prosecution-and-family-\n28 \nreunification. \n2 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1726   Page 3 of 24\n \n1  different locations than their children.  Migrant families that lawfully entered the United \n2  States at a port of entry seeking asylum were separated.  And families that were separated \n3  due to entering the United States illegally between ports of entry have not been reunited \n4  following the parent’s completion of criminal proceedings and return to immigration \n5  detention.   \n6  This  Court  previously  entered  an  order  finding  Plaintiffs  had  stated  a  legally \n7  cognizable claim for violation of their substantive due process rights to family integrity \n8  under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution based on their allegations the \n9  Government had separated Plaintiffs from their minor children while Plaintiffs were held \n10  in immigration detention and without a showing that they were unfit parents or otherwise \n11  presented a danger to their children.  See Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 302 \n12  F. Supp. 3d 1149, 2018 WL 2725736, at *7-12 (S.D. Cal. June 6, 2018).  A class action \n13  has been certified to include similarly situated migrant parents.  Plaintiffs now request \n14  classwide injunctive relief to prohibit separation of class members from their children in \n15  the future absent a finding the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child, and to require \n16  reunification of these families once the parent is returned to immigration custody unless \n17  the parent is determined to be unfit or presents a danger to the child.   \n18    Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, \n19  and that the balance of equities and the public interest weigh in their favor, thus warranting \n20  issuance of a preliminary injunction.  This Order does not implicate the Government’s \n21  discretionary  authority  to  enforce  immigration  or  other  criminal  laws,  including  its \n22  decisions  to  release  or  detain  class  members.    Rather,  the  Order  addresses  only  the \n23  circumstances  under  which  the  Government  may  separate  class  members  from  their \n24  children, as well as the reunification of class members who are returned to immigration \n25  custody upon completion of any criminal proceedings.   \n26  / / / \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n3 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1727   Page 4 of 24\n \n1  I. \n2  BACKGROUND \n3    This case started with the filing of a Complaint by Ms. L., a Catholic citizen of the \n4  Democratic Republic of the Congo fleeing persecution from her home country because of \n5  her religious beliefs.  The specific facts of Ms. L.’s case are set out in the Complaint and \n6  this Court’s June 6, 2018 Order on Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  See Ms. L., 2018 WL \n7  2725736, at *1-3.  In brief, Ms. L. and her then-six-year-old daughter S.S., lawfully \n8  presented themselves at the San Ysidro Port of Entry seeking asylum based on religious \n9  persecution.  They were initially detained together, but after a few days S.S. was “forcibly \n10  separated” from her mother.  When S.S. was taken away from her mother, “she was \n11  screaming and crying, pleading with guards not to take her away from her mother.”  (Am. \n12  Compl. ¶ 43.)  Immigration officials claimed they had concerns whether Ms. L. was S.S.’s \n13  mother, despite Ms. L.’s protestations to the contrary and S.S.’s behavior.  So Ms. L. was \n14  placed in immigration custody and scheduled for expedited removal, thus rendering S.S. \n15  an “unaccompanied minor” under the Trafficking Victims Protection and Reauthorization \n16  Act (“TVPRA”), Pub. L. No. 110-457 (Dec. 23, 2008), and subjecting her to the “care and \n17  custody” of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”).3  S.S. was placed in a facility in \n18 \n19                                                  \n20 \n3  The TVPRA provides that “the care and custody of all unaccompanied alien children, \n21  including responsibility for their detention, where appropriate, shall be the responsibility \nof” HHS and its sub-agency, ORR.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(1).  An “unaccompanied alien \n22 \nchild” (“UAC”) is a child under 18 years of age with no lawful immigration status in the \n23  United States who has neither a parent nor legal guardian in the United States nor a parent \nnor legal guardian in the United States “available” to care for them.  6 U.S.C § 279(g)(2).  \n24 \nAccording to the TVPRA, a UAC “may not be placed with a person or entity unless the \n25  Secretary  of  Health  and  Human  Services  makes  a  determination  that  the  proposed \ncustodian is capable of providing for the child’s physical and mental well-being.  Such \n26 \ndetermination shall, at a minimum, include verification of the custodian’s identity and \n27  relationship to the child, if any, as well as an independent finding that the individual has \nnot engaged in any activity that would indicate a potential risk to the child.”  8 U.S.C. § \n28 \n1232(c)(3)(A).   \n4 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1728   Page 5 of 24\n \n1  Chicago  over  a  thousand  miles  away  from  her  mother.    Immigration  officials  later \n2  determined  Ms.  L.  had  a  credible  fear  of  persecution  and  placed  her  in  removal \n3  proceedings, where she could pursue her asylum claim.  During this period, Ms. L. was \n4  able to speak with her daughter only “approximately 6 times by phone, never by video.”  \n5  (Am. Compl. ¶ 45.)  Each time they spoke, S.S. “was crying and scared.” (Id. ¶ 43.)  Ms. \n6  L. was “terrified that she would never see her daughter again.”  (Id. ¶ 45.)  After the present \n7  lawsuit was filed, Ms. L. was released from ICE detention into the community.  The Court \n8  ordered the Government to take a DNA saliva sample (or swab), which confirmed that Ms. \n9  L. was the mother of S.S.  Four days later, Ms. L. and S.S. were reunited after being \n10  separated for nearly five months.   \n11    In an Amended Complaint filed on March 9, 2018, this case was expanded to include \n12  another Plaintiff, Ms. C.  She is a citizen of Brazil, and unlike Ms. L., she did not present \n13  at a port of entry.  Instead, she and her 14-year-old son J. crossed into the United States \n14  “between ports of entry,” after which they were apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol.  Ms. \n15  C. explained to the agent that she and her son were seeking asylum, but the Government, \n16  as was its right under federal law, charged Ms. C. with entering the country illegally and \n17  placed her in criminal custody.  This rendered J. an “unaccompanied minor” and he, like \n18  S.S., was transferred to the custody of ORR, where he, too, was housed in a facility in \n19  Chicago several hundred miles away from his mother.  Ms. C. was thereafter convicted of \n20  misdemeanor illegal entry and served 25 days in criminal custody.  After completing that \n21  sentence, Ms. C. was transferred to immigration detention for removal proceedings and \n22  consideration of her asylum claim, as she too had passed a credible fear screening.  Despite \n23  being returned to immigration custody, Ms. C. was not reunited with J.  During the five \n24  months she was detained, Ms. C. did not see her son, and they spoke on the phone only “a \n25  handful of times[.]”  (Id. ¶ 58.)  Ms. C. was “desperate” to be reunited with her son, worried \n26  about him constantly and did not know when she would be able to see him.  (Id.)  J. had a \n27  difficult time emotionally during the period of separation from his mother.  (Id. ¶ 59.)  Ms. \n28  C. was eventually released from immigration detention on bond, and only recently reunited \n5 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1729   Page 6 of 24\n \n1  with J.  Their separation lasted more than eight months despite the lack of any allegations \n2  or evidence that Ms. C. was unfit or otherwise presented a danger to her son.4   \n3    Ms. L. and Ms. C. are not the only migrant parents who have been separated from \n4  their children at the border.  Hundreds of others, who have both lawfully presented at ports \n5  of entry (like Ms. L.) and unlawfully crossed into the country (like Ms. C.), have also been \n6  separated.  Because this practice is affecting large numbers of people, Plaintiffs sought \n7  certification of a class consisting of similarly situated individuals.  The Court certified that \n8  class with minor modifications,5 and now turns to the important question of whether \n9  Plaintiffs are entitled to a classwide preliminary injunction that (1) halts the separation of \n10  class members from their children absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents \n11  a danger to the child, and (2) reunites class members who are returned to immigration \n12  custody upon completion of any criminal proceedings absent a determination that the \n13  parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.   \n14    Since the present motion was filed, several important developments occurred, as \n15  previously noted.  First, on May 7, 2018, the Government announced its zero tolerance \n16  policy for all adult persons crossing the border illegally, which resulted in the separation \n17  of hundreds of children who had crossed with their parents.  This is what happened with \n18  Ms. C., though she crossed prior to the public announcement of the zero tolerance policy.  \n19 \n                                                \n20 \n21  4  As stated in the Court’s Order on Defendants’ motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs do not \nchallenge Ms. C.’s initial separation from J. as a result of the criminal charge filed against \n22 \nher.  Plaintiffs’ only complaint with regard to Ms. C. concerns the Government’s failure to \n23  reunite her with J. after she was returned to immigration custody.   \n5  The class is defined to include: “All adult parents who enter the United States at or \n24 \nbetween  designated  ports  of  entry  who  (1)  have  been,  are,  or  will  be  detained  in \n25  immigration custody by the [DHS], and (2) have a minor child who is or will be separated \nfrom them by DHS and detained in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody absent \n26 \na determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.”  (See Order \n27  Granting in Part Mot. for Class Cert. at 17.)  The class does not include parents with \ncriminal history or communicable disease, or those apprehended in the interior of the \n28 \ncountry or subject to the EO.  (See id. at 4 n.5.) \n6 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1730   Page 7 of 24\n \n1  She is not alone.  There are hundreds of similarly situated parents, and there are more than \n2  2,000 children that have now been separated from their parents.   \n3    When  a  parent is  charged  with  a  criminal offense,  the  law  ordinarily  requires \n4  separation of the family.  This separation generally occurs regardless of whether the parent \n5  is charged with a state or federal offense.  The repercussions on the children, however, can \n6  vary greatly depending on status.  For citizens, there is an established system of social \n7  service agencies ready to provide for the care and well-being of the children, if necessary, \n8  including child protective services and the foster care system.  This is in addition to any \n9  family  members  that  may  be  available  to  provide  shelter  for  these  minor  children.  \n10  Grandparents and siblings are frequently called upon.  Non-citizens may not have this kind \n11  of support system, such as other family members who can provide shelter for their children \n12  in the event the parent is detained at the border.  This results in immigrant children going \n13  into the custody of the federal government, which is presently not well equipped to handle \n14  that important task.   \n15    For children placed in federal custody, there are two options.  One of those options \n16  is ORR, but it was established to address a different problem, namely minor children who \n17  were apprehended at the border without their parents, i.e., true “unaccompanied alien \n18  children.”  It was not initially designed to address the problem of migrant children detained \n19  with their parents at the border and who were thereafter separated from their parents.  The \n20  second option is family detention facilities, but the options there are limited.  Indeed, at the \n21  time of oral argument on this motion, Government counsel represented to the Court that \n22  the “total capacity in [family] residential centers” was “less than 2,700.”  (Rep. Tr. at 9, \n23  May 9, 2018, ECF No. 70.)  For male heads of households, i.e., fathers traveling with their \n24  children, there was only one facility with “86 beds.”  (Id. at 43.)   \n25    The recently issued EO confirms the government is inundated by the influx of \n26  children essentially orphaned as a result of family separation.  The EO now directs “[h]eads \n27  of executive departments and agencies” to make available “any facilities … appropriate” \n28  for the housing and care of alien families.  EO § 3(d).  The EO also calls upon the military \n7 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1731   Page 8 of 24\n \n1  by directing the Secretary of Defense to make available “any existing” facility and to \n2  “construct such facilities[,]” if necessary, id. § 3(c), which is an extraordinary measure.  \n3  Meanwhile, “tent cities” and other make-shift facilities are springing up.  That was the \n4  situation into which Plaintiffs, and hundreds of other families that were separated at the \n5  border in the past several months, were placed.   \n6    This situation has reached a crisis level.  The news media is saturated with stories of \n7  immigrant families being separated at the border.  People are protesting.  Elected officials \n8  are weighing in.  Congress is threatening action.   Seventeen states have now filed a \n9  complaint against the Federal Government challenging the family separation practice.  See \n10  State of Washington v. United States, Case No. 18cv0939, United States District Court for \n11  the Western District of Washington.  And the President has taken action.   \n12    Specifically, on June 20, 2018, the President signed the EO referenced above.  The \n13  EO states it is the Administration’s policy “to maintain family unity, including by detaining \n14  alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.” \n15  Id. § 1.6  In furtherance of that policy, the EO indicates that parents and children who are \n16  apprehended together at the border will be detained together “during the pendency of any \n17  criminal improper entry or immigration proceedings” to the extent permitted by law.  Id. § \n18  3.  The language of the EO is not absolute, however, as it states that family unity shall be \n19  maintained “where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources[,]” id. § 1, \n20  and “to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations[.]”  Id. \n21  § 3.  The EO also indicates rigorous enforcement of illegal border crossers will continue.  \n22  Id. § 1 (“It is the policy of this Administration to rigorously enforce our immigration \n23  laws.”).  And finally, although the Order speaks to a policy of “maintain[ing] family unity,” \n24 \n25                                                  \n26 \n6  The Order defines “alien family” as “any person not a citizen or national of the United \n27  States who has not been admitted into, or is not authorized to enter or remain in, the United \nStates,  who entered this country  with  an  alien child or  alien  children  at  or  between \n28 \ndesignated ports of entry and who was detained[.]”  Id. § 2(a)(i). \n8 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1732   Page 9 of 24\n \n1  it is silent on the issue of reuniting families that have already been separated or will be \n2  separated in the future.” Id.   \n3    In light of these recent developments, and in particular the EO, the Court held a \n4  telephonic status conference with counsel on June 22, 2018.  During that conference, the \n5  Court  inquired  about  communication  between  ORR  and  DHS,  and  ORR  and  the \n6  Department of Justice (“DOJ”), including the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), as it relates to \n7  these  separated  families.    Reunification  procedures  were  also  discussed,  specifically \n8  whether there was any affirmative reunification procedure for parents and children after \n9  parents  were  returned  to  immigration  detention  following  completion  of  criminal \n10  proceedings.  Government counsel explained the communication procedures that were in \n11  place, and represented, consistent with her earlier representation to the Court, that there \n12  was no procedure in place for the reunification of these families.7   \n13  The day after the status conference, Saturday, June 23, DHS issued the Fact Sheet \n14  referenced above.  This document focuses on several issues addressed during the status \n15  conference, e.g., processes for enhanced communication between separated parents and \n16  children, but only “for the purposes of removal.”  It also addresses coordination between \n17  and among three agencies, CBP, ICE, and HHS agency ORR, but again for the purpose of \n18  removal.  The Fact Sheet does not address reunification for other purposes, such as \n19  immigration or asylum proceedings, which can take months.  It also does not mention other \n20  vital agencies frequently involved during criminal proceedings: DOJ and BOP.   \n21    At the conclusion of the recent status conference, the Court requested supplemental \n22  briefing from the parties.  Those briefs have now been submitted.  After thoroughly \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25  7  The Court: “Is there currently any affirmative reunification process that the government \nhas in place once parent and child are separated?  Government counsel: I would say … \n26 \nwhen a parent is released from criminal custody and taken into ICE custody is the practice \n27  to reunite them in family detention[?]  And at that [previous hearing] I said no, that that \nwas not the practice.  I think my answer on that narrow question would be the same.”  (Rep. \n28 \nTr. at 29-30, June 22, 2018, ECF No. 77.)   \n9 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1733   Page 10 of 24\n \n1  considering all of the parties’ briefs and the record in this case, and after hearing argument \n2  from counsel on these important issues, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion for a classwide \n3  preliminary injunction. \n4  II. \n5  DISCUSSION \n6    Plaintiffs seek classwide preliminary relief that (1) enjoins Defendants’ practice of \n7  separating class members from their children absent a determination that the parent is unfit \n8  or presents a danger to their child, and (2) orders the government to reunite class members \n9  with their children when the parent is returned to immigration custody after their criminal \n10  proceedings conclude, absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger \n11  to the child.  Injunctive relief is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon \n12  a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. \n13  Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  To meet that showing, Plaintiffs must demonstrate \n14  “‘[they are] likely to succeed on the merits, that [they are] likely to suffer irreparable harm \n15  in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [their] favor, and \n16  that an injunction is in the public interest.’”  Am. Trucking Ass'ns v. City of Los Angeles, \n17  559 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20).8   \n18 \n19                                                  \n20 \n8  The Ninth Circuit applies separate standards for injunctions depending on whether they \n21  are prohibitory, i.e., whether they prevent future conduct, or mandatory, i.e., “they go \nbeyond ‘maintaining the status quo[.]’”  Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 997 (9th \n22 \nCir. 2017).  The standard set out above applies to prohibitory injunctions, which is what \n23  Plaintiffs seek here.  To the extent Plaintiffs are also requesting mandatory relief, that \nrequest is “subject to a higher standard than prohibitory injunctions,” namely that relief \n24 \nwill issue only “when ‘extreme or very serious damage will result’ that is not capable of \n25  compensation in damages,’ and the merits of the case are not ‘doubtful.’”  Id. at 999 \n(quoting Marlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc. v. Mucos Pharma GmbH & Co., 571 F.3d 873, 879 \n26 \n(9th Cir. 2009)).  The Ninth Circuit recognizes that application of these different standards \n27  “is controversial[,]” and that other Circuits have questioned this approach.   Id. at 997-98.  \nThis Court need not, and does not, address that discrepancy here.  Suffice it to say that to \n28 \nthe extent some portion of Plaintiffs’ requested relief is subject to a standard higher than \n10 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1734   Page 11 of 24\n \n1    Before turning to these factors, the Court addresses directly Defendants’ argument \n2  that an injunction is not necessary here in light of the EO and the recently released Fact \n3  Sheet.  Although these documents reflect some attempts by the Government to address \n4  some of the issues in this case, neither obviates the need for injunctive relief here.  As \n5  indicated throughout this Order, the EO is subject to various qualifications.  For instance, \n6  Plaintiffs correctly assert the EO allows the government to separate a migrant parent from \n7  his or her child “where there is a concern that detention of an alien child with the child’s \n8  alien parent would pose a risk to the child’s welfare.”  EO § 3(b) (emphasis added).  \n9  Objective standards are necessary, not subjective ones, particularly in light of the history \n10  of this case.  Furthermore, the Fact Sheet focuses on reunification “at time of removal[,]” \n11  U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., supra, note 2, stating that the parent slated for removal will \n12  be matched up with their child at a location in Texas and then removed.  It says nothing \n13  about reunification during the intervening time between return from criminal proceedings \n14  to ICE detention or the time in ICE detention prior to actual removal, which can take \n15  months.  Indeed, it is undisputed “ICE has no plans or procedures in place to reunify the \n16  parent with the child other than arranging for them to be deported together after the parent’s \n17  immigration case is concluded.”  (Pls.’ Supp. Mem. in Supp. of Classwide Prelim. Inj., Ex. \n18  31 ¶ 11.)  Thus, neither of these directives eliminates the need for an injunction in this case.  \n19  With this finding, the Court now turns to the Winter factors.   \n20  A.  Likelihood of Success \n21  “The first factor under Winter is the most important—likely success on the merits.”  \n22  Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015).  While Plaintiffs carry the burden \n23  of demonstrating likelihood of success, they are not required to prove their case in full at \n24  the preliminary injunction stage but only such portions that enable them to obtain the \n25  injunctive relief they seek.  See Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).   \n26 \n                                                \n27 \nthe traditional standard for injunctive relief, Plaintiffs have met their burden for the reasons \n28 \nset out below.   \n11 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1735   Page 12 of 24\n \n1    Here, the only claim currently at issue is Plaintiffs’ due process claim.9  Specifically, \n2  Plaintiffs  contend  the  Government’s  practice  of separating  class  members  from  their \n3  children,  and  failing  to  reunite  those  parents  who  have  been  separated,  without  a \n4  determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child violates the parents’ \n5  substantive due process rights to family integrity under the Fifth Amendment to the United \n6  States Constitution.  To prevail on this claim, Plaintiffs must show that the Government \n7  practice “shocks the conscience.”  In the Order on Defendants’ motion to dismiss, the Court \n8  found Plaintiffs had set forth sufficient facts to support that claim.  Ms. L., 2018 WL \n9  2725736, at *7-12.  The evidence submitted since that time supports that finding, and \n10  demonstrates Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on this claim.   \n11  As explained in the Court’s Order on Defendants’ motion to dismiss, the “shocks the \n12  conscience” standard is not subject to a rigid list of established elements.  See County of \n13  Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 850 (1998) (stating “[r]ules of due process are not … \n14  subject  to  mechanical  application  in  unfamiliar  territory.”)    On  the  contrary,  “an \n15  investigation into substantive due process involves an appraisal of the totality of the \n16  circumstances rather than a formalistic examination of fixed elements[.]”  Armstrong v. \n17  Squadrito, 152 F.3d 564, 570 (7th Cir. 1998).   \n18  Here, each Plaintiff presents different circumstances, but both were subjected to the \n19  same government practice of family separation without a determination that the parent was \n20  unfit or presented a danger to the child.  Ms. L. was separated from her child without a \n21  determination she was unfit or presented a danger to her child, and Ms. C. was not reunited \n22  with her child despite the absence of any finding that she was unfit or presented a danger \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25  9  In their supplemental brief, Defendants assert Plaintiffs are raising new claims based on \nevents that transpired after the Complaints were filed, e.g., the announcement of the zero \n26 \ntolerance policy and the EO.  The Court disagrees.  Plaintiffs’ claims are not based on these \n27  events, but are based on the practice of separating class members from their children.  The \nsubsequent events are relevant to Plaintiffs’ claim, but they have not changed the claim \n28 \nitself, which remains focused on the practice of separation.   \n12 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1736   Page 13 of 24\n \n1  to her child.  Outside of the context of this case, namely an international border, Plaintiffs \n2  would have a high likelihood of success on a claim premised on such a practice.  See D.B. \n3  v. Cardall, 826 F.3d 721, 741 (4th Cir. 2016) (citing cases finding due process violation \n4  where state action interfered with rights of fit parents); Heartland Academy Community \n5  Church v. Waddle, 595 F.3d 798, 808-811 (8th Cir. 2010) (finding removal of children \n6  from religious school absent evidence the students were “at immediate risk of child abuse \n7  or neglect” was violation of clearly established constitutional right); Brokaw v. Mercer \n8  County,  235  F.3d  1000,  1019  (7th  Cir.  2000)  (citing  Croft  v.  Westmoreland  County \n9  Children and Youth Services, 103 F.3d 1123, 1126 (3d Cir. 1997) (“courts have recognized \n10  that a state has no interest in protecting children from their parents unless it has some \n11  definite and articulable evidence giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that a child has been \n12  abused or is in imminent danger of abuse.”)   \n13  The context of this case is different.  The Executive Branch, which is tasked with \n14  enforcement of the country’s criminal and immigration laws, is acting within its powers to \n15  detain individuals lawfully entering the United States and to apprehend individuals illegally \n16  entering the country.  However, as the Court explained in its Order on Defendants’ motion \n17  to dismiss, the right to family integrity  still applies here.  The context of the family \n18  separation practice at issue here, namely an international border, does not render the \n19  practice constitutional, nor does it shield the practice from judicial review.   \n20  On the contrary, the context and circumstances in which this practice of family \n21  separation were being implemented support a finding that Plaintiffs have a likelihood of \n22  success on their due process claim.  First, although parents and children may lawfully be \n23  separated when the parent is placed in criminal custody, the same general rule does not \n24  apply when a parent and child present together lawfully at a port of entry seeking asylum.  \n25  In that situation, the parent has committed no crime, and absent a finding the parent is unfit \n26  or presents a danger to the child, it is unclear why separation of Ms. L. or similarly situated \n27  class members would be necessary.  Here, many of the family separations have been the \n28  result of the Executive Branch’s zero tolerance policy, but the record also reflects that the \n13 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1737   Page 14 of 24\n \n1  practice  of  family  separation  was  occurring  before  the  zero  tolerance  policy  was \n2  announced, and that practice has resulted in the casual, if not deliberate, separation of \n3  families that lawfully present at the port of entry, not just those who cross into the country \n4  illegally.  Ms. L. is an example of this family separation practice expanding beyond its \n5  lawful reach, and she is not alone.  (See, e.g., Pls.’ Reply Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Class \n6  Cert., Exs. 22-23, 25-26) (declarations from parents attesting to separation at border after \n7  lawfully presenting at port of entry and requesting asylum); Pls.’ Supp. Mem. in Supp. of \n8  Classwide Prelim. Inj., Ex. 32 ¶¶ 9, 10b, 11a (listing parents who were separated from \n9  children after presenting at ports of entry)).   \n10  As set out in the Court’s prior Order, asylum seekers like Ms. L. and many other \n11  class members may be fleeing persecution and are entitled to careful consideration by \n12  government officials.  Particularly so if they have a credible fear of persecution.  We are a \n13  country of laws, and of compassion.  We have plainly stated our intent to treat refugees \n14  with an ordered process, and benevolence, by codifying principles of asylum.  See, e.g., \n15  The Refugee Act, PL 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 (1980).  The Government’s treatment of Ms. L. \n16  and other similarly situated class members does not meet this standard, and it is unlikely \n17  to pass constitutional muster. \n18  Second, the practice of separating these families was implemented without any \n19  effective system or procedure for (1) tracking the children after they were separated from \n20  their parents, (2) enabling communication between the parents and their children after \n21  separation, and (3) reuniting the parents and children after the parents are returned to \n22  immigration custody following completion of their criminal sentence.  This is a startling \n23  reality.  The government readily keeps track of personal property of detainees in criminal \n24  and immigration proceedings.  Money, important documents, and automobiles, to name a \n25  few, are routinely catalogued, stored, tracked and produced upon a detainees’ release, at \n26  all levels—state and federal, citizen and alien.  Yet, the government has no system in place \n27  to keep track of,  provide  effective  communication  with,  and  promptly  produce  alien \n28  children.  The unfortunate reality is that under the present system migrant children are not \n14 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1738   Page 15 of 24\n \n1  accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property.  Certainly, that cannot \n2  satisfy the requirements of due process.  See Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 758-59 \n3  (1982) (quoting Lassiter v. Dept. of Soc. Services of Durham County, N.C., 452 U.S. 18, \n4  (1981)) (stating it is “‘plain beyond the need for multiple citation’ that a natural parent’s \n5  ‘desire for and right to the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her \n6  children’ is an interest far more precious than any property right.”)  (internal quotation \n7  marks omitted).   \n8  The lack of effective methods for communication between parents and children who \n9  have been separated has also had a profoundly negative effect on the parents’ criminal and \n10  immigration proceedings, as well as the childrens’ immigration proceedings.  See United \n11  States v. Dominguez-Portillo, No:EP-17-MJ-4409-MAT, 2018 WL 315759, at *1-2 (W.D. \n12  Tex. Jan. 5, 2018) (explaining that criminally charged defendants “had not received any \n13  paperwork or information concerning the whereabouts or well-being of” their children).  In \n14  effect, these parents have been left “in a vacuum, without knowledge of the well-being and \n15  location of their children, to say nothing of the immigration proceedings in which those \n16  minor children find themselves.”  Id. at *14.  This situation may result in a number of \n17  different scenarios, all of which are negative – some profoundly so.  For example, “[i]f \n18  parent and child are asserting or intending to assert an asylum claim, that child may be \n19  navigating those legal waters without the benefit of communication with and assistance \n20  from her parent; that defendant, too, must make a decision on his criminal case with total \n21  uncertainty about this issue.”  Id.  Furthermore, “ a defendant facing certain deportation \n22  would be unlikely to know whether he might be deported before, simultaneous to, or after \n23  their  child,  or  whether  they  would  have  the  opportunity  to  even  discuss  their \n24  deportations[.]”   Id.  Indeed, some parents have already been deported without their \n25  children, who remain in government facilities in the United States.10   \n26 \n                                                \n27 \n10  See, e.g., Pls.’ Supp. Mem. in Supp. of Classwide Prelim.

Ms. L. was separated from her child when immigration \n4  officials  claimed  they  could  not  verify  she  was  S.S.’s  mother,  and  detained  her  for \n5  expedited removal proceedings.  That rendered S.S. “unaccompanied” under the TVPRA \n6  and subject to immediate transfer to ORR, which accepted responsibility for S.S.  There \n7  was no further communication between the agencies, ICE and ORR.  The filing of the \n8  present lawsuit prompted release and reunification of Ms. L. and her daughter, a process \n9  that took close to five months and court involvement.  Ms. C. completed her criminal \n10  sentence in 25 days, but it took nearly eight months to be reunited with her son.  She, too, \n11  had to file suit to regain custody of her son from ORR.   \n12    These  situations  confirm  what  the  Government  has  already  stated:  it  is  not \n13  affirmatively reuniting parents like Plaintiffs and their fellow class members for purposes \n14  other than removal.  Outside of deportation, the onus is on the parents, who, for the most \n15  part, are themselves in either criminal or immigration proceedings, to contact ORR or \n16  otherwise  search  for  their  children  and  make  application  for  reunification  under  the \n17  TVPRA.  However, this reunification procedure was not designed to deal with the present \n18  circumstances.  (See Pls.’ Supp. Mem. in Supp. of Classwide Prelim. Inj., Ex. 33 ¶¶ 6-9.)  \n19  Rather, “ORR’s reunification process was designed to address the situation of children who \n20  come to the border or are apprehended outside the company of a parent or legal guardian.”  \n21  (Id. ¶ 6.)  Placing the burden on the parents to find and request reunification with their \n22  children  under  the  circumstances  presented  here  is  backwards.    When  children  are \n23 \n24 \n                                                \n25 \nREUTERS (June 21, 2018, 4:03 PM),  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-\n26 \nel-salvador/el-salvador-demands-us-return-child-taken-from-deported-father-\n27  idUSKBN1JH3ER; Miriam Jordan, ‘I Can’t Go Without My Son’: A Deported Mother’s \nPlea, N.Y.

When combined with the manner in which that practice is being \n7  implemented, e.g., the lack of any effective procedures or protocols for notifying the \n8  parents about their childrens’ whereabouts or ensuring communication between the parents \n9  and children, and the use of the children as tools in the parents’ criminal and immigration \n10  proceedings, (see Pls.’ Supp. Mem. in Supp. of Classwide Prelim. Inj., Ex. 29 ¶¶ 8, 14), a \n11  finding of likelihood of success is assured.  A practice of this sort implemented in this way \n12  is likely  to be  “so  egregious, so outrageous, that  it  may  fairly  be said  to shock the \n13  contemporary conscience,” Lewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8, interferes with rights “‘implicit in \n14  the concept of ordered liberty[,]’” Rochin v. Cal., 342 U.S. 165, 169 (1952) (quoting Palko \n15  v. State of Conn., 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937)), and is so “‘brutal’ and ‘offensive’ that it \n16  [does] not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency.”  Breithaupt v. Abram, \n17  352 U.S. 432, 435 (1957).   \n18    For all of these reasons, the Court finds there is a likelihood of success on Plaintiffs’ \n19  due process claim.   \n20  B.  Irreparable Injury   \n21    Turning to the next factor, Plaintiffs must show they are “‘likely to suffer irreparable \n22  harm in the absence of preliminary relief.’”  Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 994 (9th \n23  Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20).  “‘It is well established that the deprivation of \n24  constitutional  rights  unquestionably  constitutes  irreparable  injury.’”    Id.  (quoting \n25  Melendres  v.  Arpaio,  695  F.3d  990,  1002  (9th  Cir.  2012)  (internal  quotation  marks \n26  omitted).  As explained, Plaintiffs have demonstrated the likelihood of a deprivation of \n27  their constitutional rights, and thus they have satisfied this factor.   \n28 \n17 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1741   Page 18 of 24\n \n1    The injury in this case, however, deserves special mention.  That injury is the \n2  separation of a parent from his or her child, which the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly found \n3  constitutes irreparable harm.  See Leiva–Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 969–70 (9th Cir. \n4  2011); Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1169 (9th Cir. 2017) (identifying “separated \n5  families” as an irreparable harm). \n6    Furthermore, the record in this case reflects that the separations at issue have been \n7  agonizing for the parents who have endured them.  One of those parents, Mr. U., an asylum \n8  seeker from Kyrgyzstan, submitted a declaration in this case in which he stated that after \n9  he was told he was going to be separated from his son he “felt as though [he] was having \n10  a heart attack.”  (Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 21 ¶ 4.)  Another asylum-\n11  seeking parent from El Salvador who was separated from her two sons writes,  \n12  The separation from my sons has been incredibly hard, because I have never \nbeen away from them before.  I do not want my children to think that I \n13 \nabandoned them.  [My children] are so attached to me.  [One of my children] \n14  used to sleep in bed with me every night while [my other child] slept in his \nown bed in the same room.…  It hurts me to think how anxious and distressed \n15 \nthey must be without me.   \n16   \n17  (Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 24 ¶ 9.)  And another asylum-seeking parent \n18  from Honduras described having to place her crying 18-month old son in a car seat in a \n19  government vehicle, not being able to comfort him, and her crying as the officers “took \n20  [her] son away.”  (Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Class Cert., Ex. 25 ¶ 7.)  There has even been \n21  a report that one father committed suicide in custody after being separated from his wife \n22  and  three-year-old  child.    See  Molly  Hennessy-Fiske,  Honduran  Migrant  Who  Was \n23  Separated From Family is Found Dead in Texas Jail in an Apparent Suicide, L.A. TIMES \n24  (June  9,  2018,  5:35  PM),  http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-border-patrol-suicide-\n25  20180609-story.html. \n26    The parents, however, are not the only ones suffering from the separations.  One of \n27  the amici in this case, Children’s Defense Fund, states,  \n28 \n18 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1742   Page 19 of 24\n \n1  there is ample evidence that separating children from their mothers or fathers \nleads to serious, negative consequences to children’s health and development.  \n2 \nForced separation disrupts the parent-child relationship and puts children at \n3  increased risk for both physical and mental illness....  And the psychological \ndistress, anxiety, and depression associated with separation from a parent \n4 \nwould follow the children well after the immediate period of separation—\n5  even after eventual reunification with a parent or other family. \n \n6 \n \n7  (ECF No. 17-11 at 3.)  Other evidence before the Court reflects that “separating children \n8  from  parents  is  a  highly  destabilizing,  traumatic  experience  that  has  long  term \n9  consequences on child well-being, safety, and development.”  (ECF No. 17-13 at 2.)  That \n10  evidence reflects: \n11  Separation from family leaves children more vulnerable to exploitation and \nabuse, no matter what the care setting.  In addition, traumatic separation from \n12 \nparents creates toxic stress in children and adolescents that can profoundly \n13  impact their development.  Strong scientific evidence shows that toxic stress \ndisrupts the development of brain architecture and other organ systems, and \n14 \nincreases the risk for stress-related disease and cognitive impairment well into \n15  adult years.  Studies have shown that children who experience such traumatic \nevents  can  suffer  from  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  post-traumatic  stress \n16 \ndisorder, have poorer behavioral and educational outcomes, and experience \n17  higher rates of poverty and food insecurity.   \n \n18 \n \n19  (ECF No. 17-13 at 2.)  And Martin Guggenheim, the Fiorello LaGuardia Professor of \n20  Clinical Law at New York University School of Law and Founding Member of the Center \n21  for Family Representation, states:   \n22  Children are at risk of suffering great emotional harm when they are removed \nfrom their loved ones.  And children who have traveled from afar and made \n23 \ntheir way to this country to seek asylum are especially at risk of suffering \n24  irreversible psychological harm when wrested from the custody of the parent \nor caregiver with whom they traveled to the United States.   \n25 \n \n26  (Mem. in Supp. of Classwide Prelim. Inj., Ex. 17 ¶ 16.)  All of this evidence, combined \n27  with the constitutional violation alleged here, conclusively shows that Plaintiffs and the \n28 \n19 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1743   Page 20 of 24\n \n1  class members are likely to suffer irreparable injury if a preliminary injunction does not \n2  issue.   \n3  C.  Balance of Equities \n4    Turning to the next factor, “[t]o obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must also \n5  demonstrate that ‘the balance of equities tips in his favor.’”  Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 995 \n6  (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20).  As with irreparable injury, when a plaintiff establishes \n7  “a likelihood that Defendants’ policy violates the U.S. Constitution, Plaintiffs have also \n8  established that both the public interest and the balance of the equities favor a preliminary \n9  injunction.”  Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1069 (9th Cir. 2014).   \n10  Plaintiffs here assert the balance of equities weighs in favor of an injunction in this \n11  case.    Specifically,  Plaintiffs  argue  Defendants  would  not  suffer  any  hardship  if  the \n12  preliminary injunction is issued because the Government “cannot suffer harm from an \n13  injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice[.]”  Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, \n14  1145 (9th Cir. 2013); see also Arizona Dream Act Coalition, 757 F.3d at 1069 (quoting \n15  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012)) (stating balance of equities favors \n16  “‘prevent[ing] the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.’”).  When the absence of harm \n17  to the Government is weighed against the harms to Plaintiffs set out above, Plaintiffs argue \n18  this factor weighs in their favor.  The Court agrees.   \n19    The primary harm Defendants assert here is the possibility that an injunction would \n20  have a negative impact on their ability to enforce the criminal and immigration laws.  \n21  However, the injunction here—preventing the separation of parents from their children and \n22  ordering the reunification of parents and children that have been separated—would do \n23  nothing of the sort.  The Government would remain free to enforce its criminal and \n24  immigration  laws,  and  to  exercise  its  discretion  in  matters  of  release  and  detention \n25  consistent with law.  See EO §§ 1, 3(a) & (e) (discussing Flores v. Sessions, CV 85-4544); \n26  see also Comm. of Cent. Am. Refugees v. I.N.S., 795 F.2d 1434, 1439-40 (9th Cir. 1986) \n27  (stating “prudential considerations preclude[] interference with the Attorney General’s \n28  [exercise  of]  discretion”  in  selecting  the  detention  facilities  where  aliens  are  to  be \n20 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1744   Page 21 of 24\n \n1  detained).    It  would  just  have to do so  in  a  way  that  preserves  the  class  members’ \n2  constitutional rights to family association and integrity.  See Rodriguez, 715 F.3d at 1146 \n3  (“While ICE is entitled to carry out its duty to enforce the mandates of Congress, it must \n4  do so in a manner consistent with our constitutional values.”)  Thus, this factor also weighs \n5  in favor of issuing the injunction.   \n6  D.  Public Interest \n7    The final factor for consideration is the public interest.  See Hernandez, 872 F.3d at \n8  996 (quoting Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1139 (9th Cir. 2009)) (“When, as \n9  here, ‘the impact of an injunction reaches beyond the parties, carrying with it a potential \n10  for public consequences, the public interest will be relevant to whether the district court \n11  grants the  preliminary  injunction.’”)    To  obtain  the  requested  relief,  “Plaintiffs must \n12  demonstrate that the public interest favors granting the injunction ‘in light of [its] likely \n13  consequences,’ i.e., ‘consequences [that are not] too remote, insubstantial, or speculative \n14  and [are] supported by evidence.’”  Id. (quoting Stormans, 586 F.3d at 1139).  “‘Generally, \n15  public interest concerns are implicated when a constitutional right has been violated, \n16  because all citizens have a stake in upholding the Constitution.’”  Id. (quoting Preminger \n17  v. Principi, 422 F.3d 815, 826 (9th Cir. 2005)).   \n18    This case involves two important public interests: the interest in enforcing the \n19  country’s criminal and immigration laws and the constitutional liberty interest “of parents \n20  in the care, custody, and control of their children[,]” which “is perhaps the oldest of the \n21  fundamental liberty interests recognized by” the Supreme Court.  Troxel v. Granville, 530 \n22  U.S. 57, 65 (2000).  Both of these interests are valid and important, and both can be served \n23  by the issuance of an injunction in this case.   \n24    As stated, the public’s interest in enforcing the criminal and immigration laws of this \n25  country would be unaffected by issuance of the requested injunction.  The Executive \n26  Branch is free to prosecute illegal border crossers and institute immigration proceedings \n27  against aliens, and would remain free to do so if an injunction were issued.  Plaintiffs do \n28  not seek to enjoin the Executive Branch from carrying out its duties in that regard.   \n21 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1745   Page 22 of 24\n \n1    What Plaintiffs do seek by way of the requested injunction is to uphold their rights \n2  to family integrity and association while their immigration proceedings are underway.  This \n3  right,  specifically,  the  relationship  between  parent  and  child,  is  “constitutionally \n4  protected,”  Quilloin  v.  Walcott,  434  U.S.  246,  255  (1978),  and  “well  established.”  \n5  Rosenbaum v. Washoe Cty., 663 F.3d 1071, 1079 (9th Cir. 2011).  The public interest in \n6  upholding and protecting that right in the circumstances presented here would be served \n7  by issuance of the requested injunction.  See Arizona Dream Act Coalition, 757 F.3d at \n8  1069 (quoting Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013) (“‘[I]t is \n9  clear that it would not be equitable or in the public’s interest to allow the state … to violate \n10  the  requirements  of  federal  law,  especially  when  there  are  no  adequate  remedies \n11  available.’”)  Accordingly, this factor, too, weighs in favor of issuing the injunction.   \n12  III. \n13  CONCLUSION \n14    The unfolding events—the zero tolerance policy, EO and DHS Fact Sheet—serve to \n15  corroborate Plaintiffs’ allegations.  The facts set forth before the Court portray reactive \n16  governance—responses  to  address  a  chaotic  circumstance  of  the  Government’s  own \n17  making.  They belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of \n18  due process enshrined in our Constitution.  This is particularly so in the treatment of \n19  migrants, many of whom are asylum seekers and small children.  The extraordinary remedy \n20  of classwide preliminary injunction is warranted based on the evidence before the Court.  \n21  For the reasons set out above, the Court hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for classwide \n22  preliminary injunction, and finds and orders as follows:   \n23  (1)  Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and all those \n24    who are in active concert or participation with them, are preliminarily enjoined from \n25    detaining  Class  Members  in  DHS  custody  without  and  apart  from  their  minor \n26    children, absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the \n27 \n28 \n22 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1746   Page 23 of 24\n \n1    child, unless the parent affirmatively, knowingly, and voluntarily declines to be \n2    reunited with the child in DHS custody.11    \n3  (2)  If Defendants choose to release Class Members from DHS custody, Defendants, and \n4    their officers, agents, servants, employees and attorneys, and all those who are in \n5    active concert or participation with them, are preliminary enjoined from continuing \n6    to detain the minor children of the Class Members and must release the minor child \n7    to the custody of the Class Member, unless there is a determination that the parent \n8    is unfit or presents a danger to the child, or the parent affirmatively, knowingly, and \n9    voluntarily declines to be reunited with the child. \n10  (3)  Unless there is a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the \n11    child, or the parent affirmatively, knowingly, and voluntarily declines to be reunited \n12    with the child: \n13    (a)  Defendants must reunify all Class Members with their minor children who are \n14    under the age of five (5) within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this Order; and  \n15    (b)  Defendants must reunify all Class Members with their minor children age five \n16    (5) and over within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order. \n17  (4)  Defendants  must  immediately  take  all  steps  necessary  to  facilitate  regular \n18  communication between Class Members and their children who remain in ORR \n19  custody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody.  Within ten (10) days, Defendants must \n20  provide parents telephonic contact with their children if the parent is not already in \n21  contact with his or her child. \n22 \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25  11  “Fitness” is an important factor in determining whether to separate parent from child.  In \nthe context of this case, and enforcement of criminal and immigration laws at the border, \n26 \n“fitness” could include a class member’s mental health, or potential criminal involvement \n27  in matters other than “improper entry” under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), (see EO § 1), among other \nmatters.  Fitness factors ordinarily would be objective and clinical, and would allow for the \n28 \nproper exercise of discretion by government officials.  \n23 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 83   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1747   Page 24 of 24\n \n1  (5)  Defendants  must  immediately  take  all  steps  necessary  to  facilitate  regular \n2  communication  between  and  among  all  executive  agencies  responsible  for  the \n3  custody, detention or shelter of Class Members and the custody and care of their \n4  children, including at least ICE, CBP, BOP, and ORR, regarding the location and \n5  well-being of the Class Members’ children. \n6  (6)  Defendants, and their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and all those \n7  who are in active concert or participation with them, are preliminarily enjoined from \n8  removing  any  Class  Members  without  their  child,  unless  the  Class  Member \n9  affirmatively, knowingly, and voluntarily declines to be reunited with the child prior \n10  to the Class Member’s deportation, or there is a determination that the parent is unfit \n11  or presents a danger to the child. \n12  (7)  This Court retains jurisdiction to entertain such further proceedings and to enter such \n13  further orders as may be necessary or appropriate to implement and enforce the \n14  provisions of this Order and Preliminary Injunction. \n15    A status conference will be held on July 6, 2018, at 12:00 noon, to discuss all \n16  necessary matters.

First, the category entitled \n23 \n24  “Children discharged by being reunified with separated parent” has been expanded \n25 \nfrom the previous category in the August 16 JSR, “Children discharged by being \n26 \nreunified with parents in ICE custody under the government’s plan,” to include all \n27 \n28 \n \n \n  2  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 204   Filed 08/23/18   PageID.3298   Page 4 of 13\n \nreunifications with a separated parent, whether in ICE custody or not.  As a result, \n1 \n2  the  current  category  now  contains  a  number  of  children  who  were  previously \n3 \ncategorized as “Children discharged under other appropriate circumstances.” \n4 \nSecond,  Defendants  have  removed  the  subcategories  entitled  “Children \n5 \n6  Remaining in Care with ORR – Adult released to interior” and “Children Remaining \n7 \nin Care with ORR – Adult location under case file review” from the current table.  \n8 \nConsistent  with  the  Court’s  direction  during  the  August  17  status  conference, \n9 \n10  Defendants  are  providing  the  details  below  regarding  the  children  who  were \n11 \nincluded in those subcategories in the August 16 JSR. \n12 \nNine children reported in August 16, 2018 JSR as “Children Remaining in \n13 \nCare with ORR – Adult released to interior” \n \n14 \nOf the nine children, four children no longer meet the criterion: two children \n15 \nhave been discharged from ORR care, and two children are associated with adults \n16 \n17  who are no longer in the interior.  \n18 \nOf the remaining five of nine children, two have separated parents with a red \n19 \nflag for a background check, and the remaining three continue to process towards \n20 \n21  appropriate discharge.   \n22 \nThese children are accounted for as appropriate in other categories in the table \n23 \nabove.  \n24 \n \n25 \n \n \n26 \n \n \n27 \n28 \n \n \n  3  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 204   Filed 08/23/18   PageID.3299   Page 5 of 13\n \n \n1  Ten children reported in August 16, 2018 JSR as “Children Remaining in Care \nwith ORR – Adult location under case file review” \n2   \nAs of Wednesday, August 22, three of the ten children no longer meet the \n3 \n4  criterion, as contact has since been established with the adult associated with the \n5 \nchild.   \n6 \nOf the remaining seven of ten children: \n7   \n•  Two are under review to determine whether they were separated from their \n8 \nparent by the United States Government; \n9 \n \n•  Two have had contact made with a non-separated parent, but not yet the \n10 \nseparated parent; \n11 \n \n12  •  Two have not had contact made with a separated or non-separated parent, \nthough case managers continue to work to establish contact; and \n13 \n \n14  •  One has a parent who is in custody in his country of origin (COO). \n \n15 \nB.

Information Sharing \n12   \nDefendants have provided the data previously requested by Plaintiffs, and are \n13 \n14  supplementing some pieces of that data as appropriate.

Individual Requests for Relief from M.M.M. TRO \n4 \nA number of children of class members in this case, as well as some class \n5 \n6  members themselves, are separately represented by counsel other than class counsel \n7 \nin Ms. L or M.M.M. Several of those counsel have reached out to Government \n8 \ncounsel, or to other employees of Defendants, seeking relief from the M.M.M. TRO \n9 \n10  so that they can depart from the United States. Government counsel have told these \n11 \nindividuals and their counsel that in order to be removed, or take voluntary departure, \n12 \nthey  must  reach  out  to  M.M.M.  class  counsel  who  can  either  agree  that  such \n13 \n14  individuals are not subject to the TRO, or seek relief from the TRO from this Court \n15 \non behalf of those individuals.  \n16 \n17  II.  PLAINTIFFS’ POSITION \n \n18 \nOver the past week, the Steering Committee has been actively engaged in \n19 \noutreach to removed parents and representatives for their children who remain in \n20 \nthe United States.  On August 7 and August 10, the Government produced lists of \n21 \nremoved parents with contact information for most parents.  The August 7th list \n22 \nincluded 14 parents not on the August 10th list; combined the Government lists \n23 \nhave a total of 412 parents.   \n24 \nThe Steering Committee has asked the Government to clarify why those 14 \n25 \nparents on the August 7 list are not listed on the August 10 list.  The Government \n26 \nhas indicated that it is investigating.  The following table summarizes Steering \n27 \n28 \n \n \n  7  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 204   Filed 08/23/18   PageID.3303   Page 9 of 13\n \n1  Committee progress: \n     \n2 \nRemoved parents identified by the Government (8/7 and 8/10  412 \n3 \nlists) \n4 \n•  Parents for whom Committee has no phone number  41 \n5 \nSteering Committee called parent   371 \n6 \nSteering Committee spoke to parent (either by phone or in  231 \n7 \nperson) \n8 \n•  Parents called and successfully reached  225 \n9 \n•  Parents found through outreach by NGOs  6 \n10 \n•  Parents  called  and  not  reached  (and  not  reached  140 \n11 \nthrough NGO efforts) \n12 \n  Phone number inoperable or ineffective  38 \n13  o\n  Phone calls ongoing  102 \n14  o\n \n15  Parents reached by phone or NGO outreach  231 \nReunified: confirmed reunifications in home country  10 \n16 \nReady for reunification: parent’s reunification wish confirmed to  15 \nmatch child’s       \n17 \nPreliminary indication of parent’s wishes for reunification  183 \nOngoing discussions w parent about reunification          23 \n18 \n       \n19 \n \n20 \nThe Steering Committee has placed calls to all parents for whom it has \n21 \nphone numbers — 3711 out of the 412 — and has successfully spoken to 231 (225 \n22 \nthrough phone calls, six reached by NGO partners in Central America).  Of these \n23 \n231, we have obtained a preliminary indication of the desires of 183 parents.  We \n24 \nare having ongoing discussions with 23 parents to ascertain their wishes.  Ten \n25                                                   \n1 The Steering Committee received 366 phone numbers for removed parents \n26 \nfrom the Government. The additional five parents contacted were found through \n27  the Committee’s efforts. \n28 \n \n \n  8  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 204   Filed 08/23/18   PageID.3304   Page 10 of 13\n \n1  children have been reunified with their parents in their country of origin.   \n2  As required by the Reunification Plan, the Steering Committee has also been \n3  communicating with attorneys for the children of removed parents to ensure that \n4  the desires expressed by parents and children are aligned before a final decision is \n5  communicated to the Government.  On August 16, the Government provided a list \n6  of 236 children and their associated attorneys.  This list did not include the names, \n7  locations, or contact information for their parents, so we have been working to \n8  correlate this information with the information provided concerning parents.  Of \n9  these 236 children, 73 were not included on the previous two lists of children with \n10  removed parents provided by the Government on August 7 and 10, and the \n11  Steering Committee has asked for clarification in this regard.  For the remaining \n12  children—for whom the parents are understood to be removed—the Steering \n13  Committee has reached out to all of the children’s attorneys and is awaiting \n14  confirmation of the children’s wishes.  To identify the legal representatives of the \n15  249 children for whom the Government has not provided information, the Steering \n16  Committee has worked with the Vera Institute of Justice to determine the \n17  designated legal service providers for all ORR shelters, and has reached out to all \n18  of these providers to determine which children they represent.  Within the coming \n19  days, the Steering Committee will identify children who do not appear to be \n20  represented and will work with Vera to secure counsel for them.  \n21  For 15 sets of parents and children, the Steering Committee has confirmed \n22  that the desires of parents and children are aligned and the Steering Committee is \n23  in the process of obtaining or preparing documentation of those desires to provide \n24  final confirmation to the Government.  Of the 15 families that fall within this \n25  group, 12 have elected reunification in the country of origin, and 3 have decided to \n26  decline such reunification. \n27  Of the 140 parents for whom outreach attempts have been unsuccessful to \n28 \n \n \n  9  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 204   Filed 08/23/18   PageID.3305   Page 11 of 13\n \n1  date, the Steering Committee has determined that 38 of the phone numbers \n2  provided are inoperative or ineffective and the Steering Committee is continuing \n3  efforts to reach the remaining 102 parents.  The Steering Committee is determining \n4  a phone number to be inoperative or ineffective under the following circumstances: \n5  (1) the person answering the phone accepted the call and indicated that the number \n6  was incorrect; (2) the number does not ring or leads to a pre-recorded error \n7  message; or (3) the Steering Committee has attempted to dial the phone number \n8  provided by the Government at least five times, over multiple days, and has been \n9  unable to reach the parent (e,g., the call reaches a voicemail that has not been set \n10  up, the call rings with no answer).  The Steering Committee provided a list of such \n11  inoperative or ineffective phone numbers to the Government on Tuesday, August \n12  21, and will continue to provide updates lists as numbers are determined to be \n13  inoperative or ineffective. \n14  For parents for whom the Government has not yet provided phone numbers \n15  (41), or for whom the Steering Committee has determined the numbers to be \n16  inoperative or ineffective (38), Steering Committee member Justice in Motion is \n17  currently engaged in on-the-ground efforts in Honduras and Guatemala to locate \n18  parents.  Justice in Motion representatives who speak indigenous languages have \n19  obtained birth certificates of parents to determine their locations and have travelled \n20  to remote villages to seek to interview the parents in person.  These efforts have \n21  reached six parents and will continue, supported by Steering Committee member \n22  KIND’s local partners in Central America and other NGO partners.  \n23  Finally, in communicating with removed parents, the Steering Committee \n24  has indications that some parents may have been coerced or misled by U.S. \n25  government actions that deprived the parents of their right to seek asylum.  These \n26  incidents include parents who were told that they needed to accept removal and not \n27  pursue asylum in order to be reunited with their children, and parents who were \n28 \n \n \n  10  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 204   Filed 08/23/18   PageID.3306   Page 12 of 13\n \n1  required to sign documents they did not understand, in languages they do not \n2  speak, that had the effect of waiving their right to seek asylum.

PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR CLASS \nCERTIFICATION \n14  U.S Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”); et al., \n15 \nRespondents-Defendants. \n16 \n \n17 \n18    Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  Plaintiffs, on \n19  behalf of themselves and putative class members, allege the Government has a widespread \n20  practice or policy of separating migrant families, and placing the children in facilities for \n21  “unaccompanied minors.”  Recent developments validate Plaintiffs’ allegations.  Plaintiffs \n22  seek to certify a class of similarly situated individuals for whom injunctive relief can be \n23  entered prohibiting separation of migrant parents from their minor children without first \n24  determining they are unfit parents or otherwise present a risk of danger to their children, as \n25  well  as  an  injunction  requiring  reunification  of  migrant  parents  who  are  returned  to \n26  immigration custody upon completion of any criminal proceedings, absent a determination \n27  that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.   \n28 \n1 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1707   Page 2 of 18\n \n1  On June 6, 2018, the Court entered an order finding Plaintiffs had stated a claim for \n2  violation  of  their  substantive  due  process  rights  to  family  integrity  under  the  Fifth \n3  Amendment to the United States Constitution based on claims that the Government had \n4  separated  them  from  their  minor  children  while  Plaintiffs  were  held  in  immigration \n5  detention without a showing that they were unfit parents or otherwise presented a danger \n6  to their children.  Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 302 F. Supp. 3d 1149, 2018 \n7  WL 2725736, at *9-12 (S.D. Cal. June 6, 2018).  Since the issuance of that Order, the \n8  practice of family separation has intensified and become a matter of intense national \n9  debate.   \n10  The Attorney General of the United States announced a “zero tolerance” policy.1  \n11  Under that policy, all adults entering the United States illegally would be subject to \n12  criminal prosecution, and if accompanied by a minor child, the child would be separated \n13  from the parent.  Over the ensuing weeks, hundreds of migrant children were separated \n14  from their parents, further stoking the flames of nationwide protest.  On June 20, 2018, the \n15  President of the United States signed an Executive Order (“EO”) to “maintain family unity” \n16  by keeping migrant families together during criminal and immigration proceedings to the \n17  extent permitted by law, while maintaining “rigorous[]” enforcement of immigration laws.  \n18  See Executive Order, Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation § \n19  1, 2018 WL 3046068 (June 20, 2018).  On Saturday, June 23, 2018, the Department of \n20  Homeland Security (“DHS”) issued a “Fact Sheet” outlining the Government’s efforts to \n21  “ensure that those adults who are subject to removal are reunited with their children for the \n22  purposes of removal.”2   \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25  1    See  U.S.  Att’y  Gen.,  Attorney  General  Sessions  Delivers  Remarks  Discussing the \nImmigration  Enforcement  Actions  of  the  Trump  Administration  (May  7,  2018), \n26 \nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-\n27  discussing-immigration-enforcement-actions.   \n2  See U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Fact Sheet: Federal Regulations Protecting the \n28 \nConfidentiality  of  Asylum  Applicants  (June  23,  2018), \n2 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1708   Page 3 of 18\n \n1  Following issuance of the EO, a status conference was held on June 22, 2018, at \n2  which time Lee Gelernt and Bardis Vakili appeared for Plaintiffs, and Sarah Fabian and \n3  Samuel Bettwy appeared for Defendants.  After hearing from counsel and considering the \n4  parties’ supplemental briefing, Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is granted in part \n5  for the reasons set forth below.   \n6  I. \n7  DISCUSSION3 \n8    Plaintiff Ms. L. and her minor child S.S. arrived lawfully at one of our nation’s ports \n9  of entry seeking asylum.  Ms. L. and her child were detained together for several days, and \n10  later “forcibly separated” by immigration officials without a determination that Ms. L. was \n11  unfit or presented a danger to her child.  S.S., then six years old, was placed in a government \n12  facility for “unaccompanied minors” over a thousand miles away from Ms. L.  Ms. L. and \n13  S.S. were separated for nearly five months.   \n14  Plaintiff Ms. C. and her minor child J. entered the United States illegally between \n15  ports of entry.  Upon apprehension by a Border Patrol agent, Ms. C. made a claim for \n16  asylum.  She was arrested, charged with misdemeanor illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. § \n17  1325(a) (“criminal improper entry” under EO § 1), and served 25 days in custody.  After \n18  serving her criminal sentence, Ms. C. was returned to immigration detention to contest \n19  removal and pursue her asylum claim.  Ms. C.’s minor son was also placed in a government \n20  facility  for  “unaccompanied  minors,”  hundreds  of  miles  away  from  his  mother.  \n21  Undisputed news reports reflect the two were reunited earlier this month, after being \n22 \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25  https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/06/23/fact-sheet-zero-tolerance-prosecution-and-family-\nreunification. \n26 \n3  The factual background set out herein is abbreviated.  A full discussion of the facts \n27  relevant to this lawsuit is set out in the Order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for classwide \npreliminary injunction filed concurrently herewith and Order granting in part and denying \n28 \nin part Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  Ms. L., 2018 WL 2725736, at *1-3.  \n3 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1709   Page 4 of 18\n \n1  separated for over eight months.4  Plaintiffs allege Defendants failed to reunite Ms. C. and \n2  her son during this period of time even though Ms. C.’s fitness as a parent was never \n3  questioned by government officials.  Plaintiffs do not challenge the initial separation of \n4  Ms. C. from her child, as the separation resulted from prosecution for illegal entry and \n5  placement in criminal custody.5  Rather, Ms. C. challenges the Government’s failure to \n6  reunify her with her son after she completed her 25-day criminal sentence and was returned \n7  to immigration detention.   \n8    Ms. L.’s claim is based on the initial separation from her child while in immigration \n9  detention; Ms. C.’s claim is based on the failure to reunite her with her child after serving \n10  her criminal sentence and being returned to immigration detention.  Both claims focus on \n11  government conduct separating parents from minor children while the parent is detained \n12  pending immigration proceedings without a showing the parent is unfit or presents a danger \n13  to the child.  Plaintiffs allege separation from their children under these circumstances \n14 \n                                                \n15 \n4  See Tom Llamas et al., Brazilian Mother Reunites with 14-year-old son 8 Months After \n16 \nSeparation  at  U.S.  Border,  ABC  NEWS  (June  5,  2018,  6:50  PM), \n17  https://abcnews.go.com/US/brazilian-mother-reunites-14-year-son-months-\nseparation/story?id=55666724. \n18 \n5  In their Supplemental Briefing, Plaintiffs point out that when a parent is prosecuted for \n19  illegal entry, separation is not required.  “If the parent is being prosecuted but is nonetheless \nbeing held in a DHS facility, then there is no need to separate the family, because DHS can \n20 \nhouse families.”  (Pls.’ Suppl. Br. at 8.)  The EO in fact provides for “family unity” by \n21  directing DHS “to maintain custody of alien families during the pendency of any criminal \nimproper entry or immigration proceedings[,]” to the extent permitted by law.  EO § 3.  \n22 \nThis is a new development.  Plaintiffs argue the confusion is the result of the “government’s \n23  shifting practice regarding the detention of parents facing criminal prosecution.”  (Pls.’ \nSuppl. Br. at 8.)  For purposes of defining the class, however, the Court will carve out \n24 \nparents who fall within the EO.  EO § 2(a) (defining “Alien family”).  The EO provides for \n25  “family unity” and detaining “family units” together, id. §§ 1, 3, so further relief may be \nunnecessary.  The EO also employs its own standard for determining detention of alien \n26 \nfamilies.  Id. § 3(b).  To avoid potential conflict with the standard employed by the EO and \n27  that used by the Court, the class definition will not include such individuals.  (See Defs.’ \nSuppl. Br. at 3.)  The Court reserves on other issues that might arise given these recent \n28 \ndevelopments. \n4 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1710   Page 5 of 18\n \n1  violates  their  right  to  family  integrity  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth \n2  Amendment to the United States Constitution.  In the Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that \n3  hundreds of other migrant families had been subjected to the same treatment and that this \n4  had become a widespread practice of the current Administration.  They cited numerous \n5  reports that the Government would soon adopt a formal national policy of separating \n6  migrant families and placing the children in government facilities for “unaccompanied \n7  minors.” The Government initially denied it had such a practice or policy, but has since \n8  distanced itself from that position in light of recent developments—including the zero \n9  tolerance policy which touted family separation.   \n10  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and putative class members, request certification \n11  of the following class:   \n12  All adult parents nationwide who (1) are or will be detained in immigration \ncustody by the Department of Homeland Security, and (2) have a minor child \n13 \nwho is or will be separated from them by DHS and detained in ORR custody, \n14  absent a demonstration in a hearing that the parent is unfit or presents a danger \nto the child. \n15 \n \n16  (Am. Compl. ¶ 65; Mem. in Supp. of Mot. at 1.)  Plaintiffs argue this proposed class meets \n17  the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2).  Defendants dispute \n18  these requirements are met.  The only claim currently at issue and subject to certification \n19  is Plaintiffs’ due process claim.6  Plaintiffs’ pending motion for classwide preliminary \n20  injunction is addressed in a separate order.   \n21  A.  Legal Standard \n22    “The class action is ‘an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and \n23  on behalf of the individual named parties only.’”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n24 \n25                                                  \n26 \n6  The Court expresses no opinion on whether Plaintiffs are entitled to certification on any \n27  other claim that may be asserted in Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint.  At the hearing \non June 22, 2018, Plaintiffs’ counsel indicated an amended pleading would be forthcoming, \n28 \nbut requested the Court to rule on the presently pending motions. \n5 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1711   Page 6 of 18\n \n1  338, 348 (2011) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700-01 (1979)).  To qualify \n2  for the exception to individual litigation, the party seeking class certification must provide \n3  facts sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b).  \n4  Doninger v. Pacific Northwest Bell, Inc., 564 F.2d 1304, 1308-09 (9th Cir. 1977).  “The \n5  Rule ‘does not set forth a mere pleading standard.’”  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. \n6  27, 33 (2013) (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350).  “Rather, a party must not only ‘be prepared \n7  to provide that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or \n8  fact,’ typicality of claims of defenses, and adequacy of representation, as required by Rule \n9  23(a).  The party must also satisfy through evidentiary proof at least one of the provisions \n10  of Rule 23(b)[.]”  Id. (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350) (internal citation omitted).   \n11    Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(a)  sets  out  four  requirements  for  class \n12  certification—numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.  A \n13  showing that these requirements are met, however, does not warrant class certification.  \n14  The plaintiff also must show that one of the requirements of Rule 23(b) is met.  Here, \n15  Plaintiffs assert they meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).   \n16    Rule 23(b)(2) allows class treatment when “the party opposing the class has acted or \n17  refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \n18  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole[.]”  Fed. R. \n19  Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Because the relief requested in a (b)(2) class is prophylactic, enures to \n20  the benefit of each class member, and is based on accused conduct that applies uniformly \n21  to the class, notice to absent class members and an opportunity to opt out of the class is not \n22  required.  See Dukes, 564 U.S. at 361-62 (noting relief sought in a (b)(2) class “perforce \n23  affect[s] the entire class at once” and thus, the class is “mandatory” with no opportunity to \n24  opt out).   \n25    The  district  court  must  conduct  a  rigorous  analysis  to  determine  whether  the \n26  prerequisites of Rule 23 have been met.  Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982).  \n27  It  is  a  well-recognized  precept  that  “the  class  determination  generally  involves \n28  considerations that are ‘enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff’s \n6 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1712   Page 7 of 18\n \n1  cause of action.”’  Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469 (1978) (quoting \n2  Mercantile Nat’l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. 555, 558 (1963)).  However, “[a]lthough \n3  some inquiry into the substance of a case may be necessary to ascertain satisfaction of the \n4  commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a), it is improper to advance a decision \n5  on the merits to the class certification stage.”  Moore v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., 708 F.2d \n6  475, 480 (9th Cir. 1983) (citation omitted); see also Nelson v. United States Steel Corp., \n7  709 F.2d 675, 680 (11th Cir. 1983) (plaintiff’s burden “entails more than the simple \n8  assertion of [commonality and typicality] but less than a prima facie showing of liability”) \n9  (citation omitted).  Rather, the court’s review of the merits should be limited to those \n10  aspects relevant to making the certification decision on an informed basis.  See Fed. R. Civ. \n11  P. 23 advisory committee notes.  If a court is not fully satisfied that the requirements of \n12  Rule 23(a) and (b) have been met, certification should be refused.  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 161. \n13  B.  Rule 23(a) \n14    Rule 23(a) and its prerequisites for class certification—numerosity, commonality, \n15  typicality, and adequacy of representation—are addressed in turn. \n16    1.  Numerosity  \n17    Rule 23(a)(1) requires the class to be “so numerous that joinder of all members is \n18  impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1); Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 953 (9th Cir. \n19  2003).  The plaintiff need not state the exact number of potential class members; nor is a \n20  specific minimum number required.  Arnold v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 158 \n21  F.R.D. 439, 448 (N.D. Cal. 1994).  Rather, whether joinder is impracticable depends on \n22  the facts and circumstances of each case.  Id.   \n23    Here, Plaintiffs asserted in their motion that there were as many as 700 families that \n24  fell within the proposed class.  In support of this assertion, Plaintiffs presented declarations \n25  from a number of attorneys that provide legal services to immigrant families in border \n26  States.  (See Mem. in Supp. of Mot., Exs. 13-15.)  Those attorneys declared they had seen \n27  hundreds of situations of children separated from their parents after being apprehended by \n28  DHS officials.  (See id., Ex. 13 ¶ 4; Ex. 14 ¶¶ 3-5; Ex. 15 ¶ 2.)  One of those attorneys also \n7 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1713   Page 8 of 18\n \n1  stated separations were occurring even when there was no “substantiated reason to suspect \n2  that the adult and child are not in fact related, or reason to suspect that the child is in \n3  imminent physical danger from the adult[.]”  (Id., Ex. 14 ¶ 6;) (see also id., Ex. 15 ¶ 3) \n4  (stating “parents have been forcibly separated from their children and placed in detention \n5  for extended periods of time without any information regarding their whereabouts, safety, \n6  or wellbeing.”).  This evidence is sufficient to show the numerosity requirement is met \n7  here.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have satisfied the first requirement of Rule 23(a).7 \n8    2.  Commonality  \n9    The second element of Rule 23(a) requires the existence of “questions of law or fact \n10  common to the class[.]”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  This element has “‘been construed \n11  permissively,’ and ‘[a]ll questions of fact and law need not be common to satisfy the rule.’”  \n12  Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 981 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Hanlon v. \n13  Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998)).  “However, it is insufficient to \n14  merely allege any common question[.]”  Id.  Instead, the plaintiff must allege the existence \n15  of  a  “common  contention”  that  is  of  “such  a  nature  that  it  is  capable  of  classwide \n16  resolution[.]”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350.  As summarized by the Supreme Court:  \n17  What  matters  to  class  certification  ...  is  not  the  raising  of  common \n‘questions’—even  in  droves—but,  rather  the  capacity  of  a  classwide \n18 \nproceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the \n19  litigation.    Dissimilarities  within  the  proposed  class  are  what  have  the \npotential to impede the generation of commons answers. \n20 \n21                                                  \n22 \n7  Notably, Defendants do not challenge whether the numerosity requirement is met, and at \n23  the May 4, 2018 hearing on this motion, they did not dispute Plaintiffs’ approximation of \nthe number of families that had been separated.  Since the hearing, DHS has stated that \n24 \n“1,995 minors were separated from their ‘alleged adult guardians’ at the southern border \n25  in just over a month long period.”  See Brian Naylor,  DHS: Nearly 2,000 Children \nSeparated  from  Adults  at  Border  in  6  Weeks,  NPR  (June  16,  2018,  7:01  AM), \n26 \nhttps://www.npr.org/2018/06/16/620451012/dhs-nearly-2-000-children-separated-from-\n27  adults-at-border-in-six-weeks.  On June 23, 2018, DHS indicated in its Fact Sheet that as \nof June 20 it had 2,053 separated minors in HHS funded facilities.  U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \n28 \nSec., supra note 2. \n8 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1714   Page 9 of 18\n \n1  Id. (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 \n2  N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009)). \n3    In this case, Plaintiffs assert there are a number of questions common to the class.  \n4  First, they assert they are alleging the same legal claim, namely whether Defendants’ \n5  practice of separating putative class members from their minor children and continued \n6  separation without a hearing and determination that they are unfit parents or present a \n7  danger to their children violates their right to family integrity under the Due Process \n8  Clause.  Second, Plaintiffs contend the facts underlying their claims are the same:  each \n9  was detained with their child by government actors, who then separated them from their \n10  children, or failed to reunite them, without a showing they were unfit or presented a danger \n11  to the child.  Third, Plaintiffs assert they suffered the same injury, namely separation from \n12  their children in violation of their constitutional rights.  Fourth, Plaintiffs contend they are \n13  challenging the same government practice regarding separation of parents and children or \n14  the refusal to reunite parents and children absent a showing the parent is unfit or presents \n15  a  danger to  the child.    Finally,  Plaintiffs  claim  they  are seeking  the same  relief:   a \n16  declaration  that  the  conduct  at  issue  is  unlawful,  and  injunctions  (1)  preventing  the \n17  separation of such parents and children without a showing the parent is unfit or presents a \n18  danger to the child, and (2) requiring reunification of the families already separated absent \n19  similar findings.   \n20    Defendants argue these questions cannot be answered on a classwide basis because \n21  the circumstances surrounding each separation of parent and child are different.  In support \n22  of this argument, Defendants point to the circumstances giving rise to the separations of \n23  Plaintiffs and their children in this case, which are indisputably different.  Ms. L. was \n24  separated  from  her  daughter  because  the  Government  allegedly  could  not  confirm \n25  parentage (though a DNA test taken several months after Ms. L. was separated from her \n26  child confirmed the relationship), while Ms. C. was separated from her son when she was \n27  apprehended near the border, charged with illegal entry, and placed in custody pending \n28  resolution of her criminal case.   \n9 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1715   Page 10 of 18\n \n1    In addition, at oral argument Government counsel set forth another scenario that \n2  could result in family separation, namely parents with criminal history that prevents them \n3  from being released into the community along with their child or housed together in a \n4  detention  center  with  other  families.8    Obviously,  these  parents  would  be  situated \n5  differently from Ms. L. and Ms. C., neither of whom presented this situation.  Unlike with \n6  Ms. L. and Ms. C., the Government would have a legitimate interest in continuing detention \n7  of individuals who posed a flight risk or danger to the community or others in a family \n8  detention facility because of that person’s criminal history.  A parent with some kind of \n9  communicable disease could also raise legitimate safety concerns.   \n10  Plaintiffs  concede  a  parent  with  a  communicable  disease  might  be  separately \n11  detained, but disagree that criminal history can serve as a generalized exception to the \n12  Government’s new policy of “family unity.”  Criminal history comes in all gradations, \n13  from minor misdemeanors to violent felony offenses.  Some types of criminal history \n14  would clearly justify separate detention of the parent, while other criminal history might \n15  not—and the exercise of governmental discretion to separately detain that individual might \n16  be challenged.  Whether separate detention of such parents violates substantive due process \n17  could raise individualized inquiries.   \n18  In addition, Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition could include migrant families \n19  apprehended in the interior of the country.  The number of such families is presently \n20  unknown and not part of the record before the Court.  This group could include families \n21  present in the country for quite some time, with established family roots and connections.  \n22  These  parents  also  might  have  both  citizen  and  alien  children.    The  application  of \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25  8  At oral argument on May 4, 2018, Government counsel pointed out that one of the \ndeclarations  submitted  by  a  putative  class  member  involved  a  “mother  who  had  a \n26 \nsignificant criminal history, so ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] was unable \n27  to place her in the family residential center because … [such] centers are a very open \nsetting.  There is [sic] sort of pods.  Families are housed together….  There is free \n28 \nmovement.  It is not a dententive setting.”  (ECF No. 70, at 21-22.) \n10 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1716   Page 11 of 18\n \n1  substantive due process to this potential group has not been briefed, and presents issues \n2  that Plaintiffs have indicated they are prepared to address at a later time.   \n3  The focus of the present litigation has always been on migrant families entering the \n4  United States at or between designated ports of entry.  Most of these families are seeking \n5  asylum but not all.  (See Am. Compl. ¶ 4) (“[A]lmost all of these individuals have fled \n6  persecution and are seeking asylum in the United States.”).  Thus, although Plaintiffs’ \n7  proposed class does not exclude parents with criminal history or communicable disease, or \n8  those in the interior of the country, the Court finds it appropriate to carve them out of the \n9  proposed class.  See Wang v. Chinese Daily News, Inc., 737 F.3d 538, 546 (9th Cir. 2013) \n10  (stating Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 “provides district courts with broad authority \n11  at various stages in the litigation … to redefine … classes as appropriate.”) (citation \n12  omitted).  Accordingly, the Court excepts from the class definition—without prejudice to \n13  redefining  the  class  on  a  more  fulsome  record—parents  with  criminal  history  or \n14  communicable disease, or those apprehended in the interior of the country.9   \n15  As  discussed,  the  focus  of  this  litigation  is  on  the  Government’s  practice  of \n16  separating migrant parents and children without any showing the parent is unfit or presents \n17  a danger to the child, and the continued separation of migrant families without any showing \n18  the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child even after the parents have completed \n19  their criminal proceedings and are returned to immigration detention.  Those circumstances \n20 \n                                                \n21 \n9  At oral argument on May 4, 2018, Government counsel also argued that lack of “bed \n22 \nspace” could cause family separation.  At that time, the “total capacity in residential centers \n23  [was] less than 2,700[,]” according to counsel.  (ECF No. 70, at 9.)  And there was only \none such center for migrant fathers and children, which has “84 or 86 beds.”  (Id. at 43-\n24 \n44.)  Recent events, however, have overtaken that argument.  The Government is actively \n25  constructing  or  converting  facilities,  even  military  facilities,  to  manage  the  growing \npopulation of migrant families.  The EO directs federal agencies to marshal resources to \n26 \nsupport family custody.  See EO § 3(c) (“The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally \n27  available measure to provide to the Secretary [of Homeland Security], upon request, any \nexisting facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall construct \n28 \nsuch facilities if necessary and consistent with law.”). \n11 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1717   Page 12 of 18\n \n1  are present in the cases of Ms. L. and Ms. C.  Ms. L. lawfully arrived at a port of entry and \n2  was separated from her daughter for nearly five months without any showing she was unfit \n3  or presented a danger to her, and Ms. C.’s separation from her son continued even after she \n4  was returned to immigration custody and despite any showing she was unfit or presented a \n5  danger to him.  The circumstances of Plaintiffs and their children in this case and the \n6  situations described in the declarations submitted in support of this motion are evidence \n7  there is a common practice at issue here, namely separating migrant parents and children \n8  and failing to reunite them without a showing the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the \n9  child.  (See Mem. in Supp. of Mot., Exs. 12-15; Reply in Supp. of Mot., Exs. 21-26) (five \n10  declarations of parents arriving at designated point of entry, and one declaration of a parent \n11  apprehended between ports of entry).  Whether that practice violates substantive due \n12  process is a question common to the class, and the answer to that question is “apt to drive \n13  the resolution of the litigation.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350 (quoting Nagareda, supra, at 132).   \n14    “[C]ommonality only requires a single significant question of law or fact[,]” Mazza \n15  v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 589 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Dukes, 564 U.S. \n16  at 359), and that is particularly so where a suit “challenges a system-wide practice or policy \n17  that affects all of the putative class members.”  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th \n18  Cir. 2001).  The Ninth Circuit’s decision in Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657 (9th Cir. 2014), \n19  is instructive.  In that case, the court was faced with a commonality question similar to the \n20  one presented here.  That case involved a claim that certain policies and practices of the \n21  Arizona  Department  of  Corrections  (“ADC”)  violated  the  Eighth  Amendment’s \n22  proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.  Id. at 662-63.  The defendants in \n23  Parsons, similar to Defendants here, argued the commonality requirement was not met \n24  because  the  plaintiffs’  claims  were  simply  “‘a  collection  of  individual  constitutional \n25  violations,’ each of which hinges on ‘the particular facts and circumstances of each case.’”  \n26  Id. at 675 (quoting Defs.’ Reply Br. at 9-10).  The Ninth Circuit disagreed.  It found the \n27  defendants’ argument “rest[ed] upon a misunderstanding of the plaintiffs’ allegations.”  Id. \n28  at 676.  Contrary to the defendants’ interpretation of the claim, the court stated, “The \n12 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1718   Page 13 of 18\n \n1  Complaint  does  not  allege  that  the  care  provided  on  any  particular  occasion  to  any \n2  particular inmate (or group of inmates) was insufficient, but rather that ADC policies and \n3  practices of statewide and systemic application expose all inmates in ADC custody to a \n4  substantial risk of serious harm.”  Id. (internal citation omitted).  The court then went on to \n5  state:  \n6  These policies and practices are the “glue” that holds together the putative \nclass …; either each of the policies and practices is unlawful as to every \n7 \ninmate or it is not.  That inquiry does not require us to determine the effect of \n8  those  policies  and  practices  upon  any  individual  class  member  (or  class \nmembers) or to undertake any other kind of individualized determination.   \n9 \n \n10  Id. at 678.   \n11    Here, as in Parsons, Plaintiffs’ claims do not rest on the individual circumstances of \n12  each separation of parent and child.  Rather, Plaintiffs are challenging the Government’s \n13  practice of separating migrant parents and children and keeping them separate without a \n14  showing the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.  Under these circumstances, \n15  the reasoning of Parsons applies here, and that reasoning compels the same conclusion, \n16  namely that the commonality requirement is met. \n17    3.  Typicality \n18    The next requirement of Rule 23(a) is typicality, which focuses on the relationship \n19  of facts and issues between the class and its representatives.  “[R]epresentative claims are \n20  ‘typical’ if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; they need \n21  not be substantially identical.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  “The test of typicality is whether \n22  other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct \n23  which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have been \n24  injured by the same course of conduct.”  Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 \n25  (9th Cir. 1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The typicality requirement \n26  will occasionally merge with the commonality requirement, Parsons, 754 F.3d at 687, \n27  because  “[b]oth  serve  as  guideposts  for  determining  whether  under  the  particular \n28  circumstances  maintenance  of  a  class  action  is  economical  and  whether  the  named \n13 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1719   Page 14 of 18\n \n1  plaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class \n2  members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349 \n3  n.5.   \n4    Here, Plaintiffs rely on the arguments raised on commonality to support a showing \n5  of typicality, and Defendants rely on the arguments raised in response thereto to show the \n6  typicality requirement is also not met.  For the reasons set out above, however, the Court \n7  finds Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of absent class members.   \n8    Both Plaintiffs were separated or remained separated from their children without any \n9  showing they were unfit or presented a danger to their child.  By definition, each member \n10  of the proposed class will have been subject to this same practice.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ \n11  claims are the same as those raised by absent class members, namely the Government’s \n12  practice of separating parents and children under the circumstances set out above violates \n13  their right to due process.  Finally, the injuries suffered by the named Plaintiffs are the \n14  same as those suffered by members of the proposed class:  separation from their children.  \n15  See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 685 (finding typicality requirement met where named plaintiffs \n16  “allege ‘the same or [a] similar injury’ as the rest of the putative class; they allege that this \n17  injury is a result of a course of conduct that is not unique to any of them; and they allege \n18  that the injury follows from the course of conduct at the center of the class claims.”).  \n19  Certainly, the claims of the named Plaintiffs and the claims of class members “are so \n20  interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected \n21  in their absence.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5.  The typicality requirement is therefore met.   \n22    4.  Adequacy of Representation  \n23    The final requirement of Rule 23(a) is adequacy.  Rule 23(a)(4) requires a showing \n24  that “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  \n25  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  This requirement is grounded in constitutional due process \n26  concerns; “absent class members must be afforded adequate representation before entry of \n27  a judgment which binds them.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020 (citing Hansberry v. Lee, 311 \n28  U.S. 32, 42-43 (1940)).  In reviewing this issue, courts must resolve two questions: “(1) do \n14 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1720   Page 15 of 18\n \n1  the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class \n2  members and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously \n3  on behalf of the class?”  Id. (citing Lerwill v. Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc., 582 F.2d 507, \n4  512 (9th Cir. 1978)).  The named plaintiffs and their counsel must have sufficient “zeal and \n5  competence” to protect the interests of the rest of the class.  Fendler v. Westgate-California \n6  Corp., 527 F.2d 1168, 1170 (9th Cir. 1975). \n7    As to the named Plaintiffs, Defendants argue they are not adequate representatives \n8  of the proposed class because both Plaintiffs’ claims are moot and the Court lacks venue \n9  over Ms. C.’s claims.  For the reasons set out in the Court’s Order on Defendants’ motion \n10  to  dismiss,  the  Court  rejects  these  arguments  as  a  basis  for  finding  Plaintiffs  to  be \n11  inadequate representatives.  Rather, Plaintiffs have shown they do not have any conflicts \n12  of interest with other class members and that they will protect the interests of the class.  \n13  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are adequate representatives for the class.   \n14    Plaintiffs have also demonstrated their counsel are adequate.  There is no conflict \n15  between Plaintiffs’ counsel and the members of the proposed class, and counsel have \n16  demonstrated they will prosecute the case vigorously on behalf of the class.  Accordingly, \n17  the requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) is met. \n18  C.   Rule 23(b) \n19    Having satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a), the next issue is whether Plaintiffs \n20  have shown that at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b) is met.  Amchem Products, \n21  Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614-15 (1997).  Here, Plaintiffs assert they have met the \n22  prerequisites of certification for a class under Rule 23(b)(2). \n23    Under Rule 23(b)(2), class certification may be appropriate where a defendant acted \n24  or refused to act in a manner applicable to the class generally, rendering injunctive and \n25  declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a whole.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  The parties \n26  agree:    \n27  The key to the (b)(2) class is “the indivisible nature of the injunctive or \ndeclaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can \n28 \n15 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1721   Page 16 of 18\n \n1  be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to \nnone of them.”  [citation omitted]  In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only \n2 \nwhen a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each \n3  member of the class.  It does not authorize class certification when each \nindividual  class  member  would  be  entitled  to  a  different  injunction  or \n4 \ndeclaratory judgment against the defendant.   \n5   \n6  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360.   \n7    Plaintiffs here argue this case is particularly suited for certification under Rule \n8  23(b)(2) because they are presenting a civil rights challenge to a practice that applies to all \n9  members of the proposed class, and that practice can be declared lawful or unlawful as to \n10  the class as a whole.  See Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1046-47 (9th Cir. 1998) (stating \n11  Rule 23(b)(2) “was adopted in order to permit the prosecution of civil rights actions[,]” and \n12  is satisfied “if class members complain of a pattern or practice that is generally applicable \n13  to the class as a whole.”); see also Parsons, 754 F.3d at 686 (same).   \n14    Defendants assert individual inquiries would be necessary to determine who falls \n15  within the class definition, which precludes certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  Defendants \n16  point out the proposed class only includes the time period “‘while a parent is in immigration \n17  custody,  and  not  the  period  of  separation  while  the  parent  is  in  jail  for  criminal \n18  conviction.’”  (Opp’n to Mot. at 14) (quoting ECF No. 35-1, at 11.)  Defendants argue the \n19  problem with Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition is found in the case of Ms. C.: “It is \n20  unclear at what point Ms. C. would become a member of Plaintiffs’ proposed class—\n21  whether at the point she was referred for prosecution by CBP [Customs and Border \n22  Protection], or later when she was released from criminal custody and detained by ICE in \n23  an immigration detention facility.”  (Id.)     \n24    However, the problem posed, namely, when someone becomes a member of the \n25  class, is easily resolved.  As Plaintiffs explain, a person becomes a member of the class \n26  when they are held in immigration detention without their children.  (Reply Br. at 7.)  \n27  Defendants are correct that this determination may involve some individualized inquiries, \n28 \n16 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1722   Page 17 of 18\n \n1  but those inquiries do not detract from the “indivisible” nature of the claim alleged and the \n2  relief sought in this case.  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360. \n3    Contrary to Defendants’ argument, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that certification \n4  under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate here.  As stated above, the crux of this case is the \n5  Government’s  practice  of  separating  migrant  parents  from  their  minor  children  and \n6  continuing to separate them without any showing the parent is unfit or presents a danger to \n7  the child.  Based on the record before the Court, the Government has “acted ... in a manner \n8  applicable to the class generally, rendering injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate to \n9  the class as a whole[.]”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  A determination regarding whether the \n10  practice of family separation and failure to reunify such families violates due process and \n11  warrants injunctive relief would apply to each class member and drive resolution of the \n12  litigation.  Accordingly, Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied. \n13  II. \n14  CONCLUSION AND ORDER \n15  For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is granted in part as to \n16  Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim.  Specifically, the Court certifies the following \n17  class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), with the exceptions noted above and \n18  as modified: \n19  All adult parents who enter the United States at or between designated ports \nof entry who (1) have been, are, or will be detained in immigration custody \n20 \nby the DHS, and (2) have a minor child who is or will be separated from them \n21  by DHS and detained in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody, \nabsent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the \n22 \nchild.10 \n23   \n \n24 \n25 \n                                                \n26 \n27  10  As discussed in text, infra, the class does not include migrant parents with criminal \nhistory or communicable disease, or those who are in the interior of the United States or \n28 \nsubject to the EO. \n17 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 82   Filed 06/26/18   PageID.1723   Page 18 of 18\n \n1  Plaintiffs  are  appointed  as  Class  Representatives,  and  Counsel  from  the  ACLU \n2  Immigrants’  Rights  Project  and  the  ACLU  of  San  Diego  and  Imperial  Counties  are \n3  appointed as counsel for this Class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g).   \n4    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n5  Dated:  June 26, 2018   \n6 \n7 \n \n8 \n \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n18 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) ",

DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS \n14  U.S Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”); et al., \n15 \nRespondents-Defendants. \n16 \n \n17 \n  This case involves the Government’s alleged practice of separating migrant parents \n18 \nand children held in immigration detention without a showing that the parent is unfit or \n19 \npresents a danger to the minor child.  According to Plaintiffs, prior administrations detained \n20 \nmigrant families, but did not have a practice of forcibly separating fit parents from their \n21 \nyoung children.  Plaintiffs allege there are reports the Government may soon adopt a formal \n22 \nnational policy of separating migrant families, and placing the children in government \n23 \nfacilities for “unaccompanied minors” to deter others from coming to the United States.  \n24 \nThe Government denies it has a family separation policy and concedes such a policy would \n25 \nbe “antithetical to the child welfare values” imposed on government actors responsible for \n26 \nthe care and custody of migrant children who are separated from their parents as a result of \n27 \nthe Government’s enforcement of criminal and immigration law.  Instead, the Government \n28 \n1 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1330   Page 2 of 25\n \n1  asserts it considers each case on the facts available at the time a placement decision is \n2  made, and that when separation occurs, it is the result of the Government taking lawful \n3  immigration enforcement and detention actions.   \n4    Plaintiffs Ms. L. and Ms. C. allege immigration officials separated them from their \n5  minor children without determining they were unfit or presented a danger to their children, \n6  and that hundreds of other migrant families have been subjected to the same treatment.  \n7  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and putative class members, allege the conduct at issue \n8  violates  their  due  process  rights  under  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \n9  Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706, and the Asylum \n10  Statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1158.   \n11    The Government’s alleged practice has garnered the attention of numerous groups \n12  interested in  child advocacy and welfare,  immigration law and constitutional law, as \n13  evidenced by the amicus briefs filed in this case.  Whether there is such a practice, and if \n14  so, whether that practice is lawful, is not presently before the Court.  The only issues \n15  presently before the Court are whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear the case, whether \n16  this Court is the proper venue for the case, and whether Plaintiffs Ms. L. and Ms. C. have \n17  alleged sufficient facts and a sufficient legal basis to state a “plausible claim for relief.”  \n18  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).  As explained below, the Court finds it has \n19  jurisdiction over the case and venue is proper in this Court.  The Court also finds Plaintiffs \n20  have set forth sufficient facts and a sufficient legal basis to state a claim that separation \n21  from their children while they are contesting their removal and without a determination \n22  they are unfit or present a danger to their children violates due process.  The Court further \n23  finds that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the APA or the Asylum Statute.   \n24  I. \n25  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n26    Plaintiff Ms. L. is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  She is \n27  Catholic.  On November 1, 2017, she and her then 6-year-old daughter S.S. arrived at the \n28  San Ysidro Port of Entry seeking asylum based on religious persecution.  Ms. L. and her \n2 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1331   Page 3 of 25\n \n1  daughter were detained by immigration officials at the border, and housed together until \n2  November 5, 2017, at which time immigration officials “forcibly separated” S.S. from her \n3  mother and sent S.S. to Chicago—over a thousand miles away—where “she was housed in \n4  a detention facility for ‘unaccompanied’ minors run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement \n5  [ORR].”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 42.)  “When S.S. was taken away from her mother, she was \n6  screaming and crying, pleading with guards not to take her away from her mother.”  (Id. ¶ \n7  43.)  During their detention and while they were separated, Ms. L. was able to speak with \n8  her daughter only “approximately 6 times by phone, never by video.”  (Id. ¶ 44.)  Each \n9  time they spoke, S.S. “was crying and scared.” (Id. ¶ 43.)  Ms. L. was “terrified that she \n10  would never see her daughter again.”  (Id. ¶ 45.)   \n11    After being separated from her daughter for nearly four months, Ms. L. filed the \n12  present case against numerous governmental entities and individual actors.1  Five days after \n13  filing the original Complaint, Ms. L. filed a motion for preliminary injunction and motion \n14  to expedite hearing of the motion.  Three days later, Ms. L. was “paroled,” i.e., released, \n15  from ICE detention.  (See infra n.3 (discussing removal proceedings, asylum and parole)).  \n16  In response to Ms. L.’s motion to expedite hearing of her motion for preliminary injunction, \n17  the Government stated it was attempting to “expeditiously resolve current doubts about \n18  whether [Ms. L.] is the mother of S.S. to the satisfaction of [ORR].”  (Opp’n to Mot. to \n19  Expedite at 1.)  That effort involved ORR taking a DNA saliva sample (or swab) from S.S., \n20  which it did on March 7, 2018.  On March 8, 2018, the Court held a telephonic status \n21 \n                                                \n22 \n23  1  Defendants include the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), U.S. \nDepartment  of  Homeland  Security  (“DHS”),  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection \n24 \n(“CBP”), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”),  U.S.  Department of \n25  Health and Human Services (“HHS”), a non-law enforcement agency, ORR, a sub-agency \nof HHS, and a host of individuals, including the Attorney General of the United States.  \n26 \nThe Attorney General is named in his official capacity as he has responsibility for the \n27  administration of the immigration laws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103, oversees the Executive \nOffice of Immigration Review, is empowered to grant asylum or other relief, and is a legal \n28 \ncustodian of Plaintiffs.  (Id. ¶ 24.) \n3 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1332   Page 4 of 25\n \n1  conference with counsel, and thereafter ordered the parties to collect a DNA sample from \n2  Ms. L. and to complete the DNA testing by March 14, 2018.  The testing was completed \n3  on March 12, 2018, and established maternity.  Four days later, and more than four months \n4  after they were separated, S.S. was released to her mother after ORR determined Ms. L. \n5  was  capable  of  providing  for  S.S.’s  physical  and  mental  well-being.    (See  infra  n.2 \n6  (discussing child welfare provisions relating to immigrant children)).   \n7    While the DNA testing was underway, Ms. L. filed an Amended Complaint that \n8  realleges the claims in the original Petition/Complaint with minor modifications, and adds \n9  a new Plaintiff, Ms. C.  Ms. C. is a citizen of Brazil, and unlike Ms. L., she crossed into \n10  the United States with her 14-year-old son J. “between ports of entry[.]”  (Mem. of P. & \n11  A. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 5.)  Ms. C. and her son were apprehended by U.S. Border \n12  Patrol, and Ms. C. explained to the agent they were seeking asylum.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 55.)  \n13  Ms. C. was prosecuted for entering the country illegally, and J. was taken away from her \n14  and sent to an ORR facility in Chicago—hundreds of miles away—for “unaccompanied” \n15  children.  (Id. ¶ 56.)  Ms. C. was convicted of misdemeanor illegal entry and served 25 \n16  days in federal custody.  (Id. ¶ 57.)  She completed her sentence on September 22, 2017, \n17  and was then taken into ICE detention for removal proceedings and consideration of her \n18  asylum claim.  She was first held at the El Paso Processing Center before being transferred \n19  to the West Texas Detention Center.  (Id.)  Ms. C. was released on bond from ICE detention \n20  on April 9, 2018, after the Amended Complaint was filed, but she has yet to be reunited \n21  with her son.  During the five months she was detained, Ms. C. did not see her son, and \n22  they spoke on the phone only “a handful of times[.]”  (Id. ¶ 58.)  Ms. C. “is desperate” to \n23  be reunited with her son, “worries about him constantly and does not know when she will \n24  be able to see him.”  (Id.)  “J. has been having a difficult time emotionally since being \n25  separated from his mother.”  (Id. ¶ 59.)  Indeed, “[e]very day that J. is separated from his \n26  mother causes him greater emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to \n27  permanent emotional trauma.”  (Id. ¶ 60.)  Plaintiffs allege “[t]he government has no \n28  legitimate interest in separating Ms. C. and her child[,]” there has been “no evidence, or \n4 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1333   Page 5 of 25\n \n1  even accusation, that J. was abused or neglected by Ms. C.[,]” and “[t]here is no evidence \n2  that Ms. C. is an unfit parent or that she is not acting in the best interests of her child.”  (Id. \n3  ¶¶ 61-63.)   \n4    Together, Ms. L. and Ms. C. seek to represent the following nationwide class on all \n5  of their claims for relief:   \n6  All adult parents nationwide who (1) are or will be detained in immigration \ncustody by the Department of Homeland Security, and (2) have a minor child \n7 \nwho is or will be separated from them by DHS and detained in ORR custody, \n8  absent a demonstration in a hearing that the parent is unfit or presents a danger \nto the child.   \n9 \n \n10  (Id. ¶ 65.)  In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs seek, among other things, a preliminary \n11  and permanent injunction preventing Defendants from continuing to separate them and the \n12  other class members from their children, and an order requiring Defendants to either \n13  “release class members along with their children, or to detain them together in the same \n14  facility[.]”  (Id. at 12.)   \n15    Three motions are pending before the Court:  Defendants’ motion to dismiss, and \n16  Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and motion for classwide preliminary injunction.  \n17  These motions came on for hearing on May 4, 2018.  Lee Gelernt, Anand Balakrishnan \n18  and Bardis Vakili appeared for Plaintiffs, and Sarah Fabian and Nicole Murley appeared \n19  for Defendants.  This Order addresses Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  Plaintiffs’ motions \n20  for class certification and preliminary injunction will be addressed in separate orders. \n21  II. \n22  DISCUSSION \n23    Defendants raise a number of arguments in their motion to dismiss.  First, they argue \n24  Ms. L.’s claims are moot because she has been released from ICE detention and reunited \n25  with her daughter.  Second, Defendants assert the Court lacks jurisdiction over Ms. C.’s \n26  habeas claim and that venue is improper for Ms. C.’s other claims.  Third, Defendants claim \n27  the Court lacks jurisdiction to review ICE’s decision to detain rather than parole Plaintiffs, \n28  and also lacks jurisdiction to review ICE’s decision about where to detain Plaintiffs or to \n5 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1334   Page 6 of 25\n \n1  order ICE to detain Plaintiffs in a particular facility.  Fourth, Defendants contend separation \n2  of Plaintiffs from their children does not violate the Fifth Amendment.  Fifth, Defendants \n3  argue Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the APA.  And finally, Defendants assert \n4  Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the Asylum Act.   \n5  A.  Mootness \n6    Defendants’ first argument in support of their motion to dismiss is that Ms. L.’s \n7  claims are moot in light of her release from detention and reunification with her daughter.  \n8  Plaintiffs disagree that either of these events renders Ms. L.’s claims moot.  \n9    “A case becomes moot—and therefore no longer a ‘Case’ or ‘Controversy’ for \n10  purposes of Article III—‘when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a \n11  legally cognizable interest in the outcome.’”  Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 \n12  (2013) (quoting Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 481 (1982)) (internal quotation marks \n13  omitted).  The mootness doctrine is subject to certain exceptions, however.  In this case, \n14  Plaintiffs invoke the voluntary cessation exception, which provides,  \n15  that  a  defendant  cannot  automatically  moot  a  case  simply  by  ending  its \nunlawful conduct once sued.  City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 \n16 \nU.S. 283, 289, 102 S.Ct. 1070, 71 L.Ed.2d 152 (1982).  Otherwise, a defendant \n17  could engage in unlawful conduct, stop when sued to have the case declared \nmoot, then pick up where he left off, repeating this cycle until he achieves all \n18 \nhis unlawful ends.  \n19   \n20  Id.   \n21    Defendants argue the voluntary cessation exception does not apply because Ms. L. \n22  was released from detention and reunited with her daughter for reasons other than this \n23  litigation.  Specifically, they assert Ms. L.’s release and reunification with her daughter \n24  “occurred through the operation of the applicable laws governing her detention and the \n25  custody of S.S.[,]” (Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss at 1), namely Ms. L.’s parole from  \n26  / / / \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n6 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1335   Page 7 of 25\n \n1  ICE  detention  and  the  release  of  S.S.  in  accordance  with  ORR  procedures  and  the \n2  Trafficking Victims Protection and Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”).2  (Id. at 2.) \n3    The Ninth Circuit has held that in order for the voluntary cessation exception to \n4  apply, “the voluntary cessation ‘must have arisen because of the litigation.’”  Sze v. I.N.S., \n5  153 F.3d 1005, 1008 (9th Cir. 1998) (quoting Public Utilities Comm’n of State of Cal. v. \n6  Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, 100 F.3d 1451, 1460 (9th Cir. 1996)).  See also ACLU \n7  of Mass. v. United States Conf. of Catholic Bishops, 705 F.3d 44, 55 (1st Cir. 2013) \n8  (quoting  M.  Redish,  Moore’s  Fed.  Practice,  § 101.99[2])  (“‘The  voluntary  cessation \n9  doctrine does not apply when the voluntary cessation of the challenged activity occurs \n10  because  of  reasons  unrelated  to  the  litigation.’”).    Here,  both  sides  offer  competing \n11  explanations for Ms. L.’s parole from detention and reunification with her daughter, with \n12  Plaintiffs asserting these actions were the result of “Defendants’ own decision to end” Ms. \n13  L.’s separation from her daughter “before this Court could rule[,]” (Opp’n to Mot. to \n14  Dismiss at 5), and Defendants arguing to the contrary.   \n15    Neither party has presented any evidence, however, as to the reason for Ms. L.’s \n16  parole from detention and reunification with her daughter.  The timing of Ms. L.’s release \n17  and reunification with her daughter, both of which occurred after this case was filed and \n18 \n19                                                  \n20 \n2  The TVPRA, Pub. L. No. 110-457 (Dec. 23, 2008), provides that “the care and custody \n21  of all unaccompanied alien children, including responsibility for their detention, where \nappropriate, shall be the responsibility of” HHS and its sub-agency, ORR.  8 U.S.C. § \n22 \n1232(b)(1).  An “unaccompanied alien child” (“UAC”) is a child under 18 years of age \n23  with no lawful immigration status in the United States who has neither a parent or legal \nguardian in the United States nor a parent or legal guardian in the United States “available” \n24 \nto care for them.  6 U.S.C § 279(g)(2).  According to the TVPRA, a UAC “may not be \n25  placed with a person or entity unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services makes a \ndetermination that the proposed custodian is capable of providing for the child’s physical \n26 \nand mental well-being.  Such determination shall, at a minimum, include verification of \n27  the custodian’s identity and relationship to the child, if any, as well as an independent \nfinding that the individual has not engaged in any activity that would indicate a potential \n28 \nrisk to the child.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(3)(A).   \n7 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1336   Page 8 of 25\n \n1  after the Court ordered an expedited DNA test, support Plaintiffs’ assertion.  Defendants, \n2  meanwhile, have failed to present any evidence to support their assertion that they were \n3  simply complying with the statutes, and would have paroled Ms. L. and reunited her with \n4  her daughter pursuant to the TVPRA absent this litigation, such as declarations from \n5  individuals involved in those decisions who could attest that the decisions were in process \n6  prior to this litigation. See ACLU of Mass., 705 F.3d at 55 (finding voluntary cessation \n7  exception did not apply where contract at issue “expired according to its terms.  HHS did \n8  nothing to hasten its expiration, much less do so to terminate litigation; ... Moreover, the \n9  expiration date, options, and task order extension were all built into the contract’s terms \n10  before this litigation began.”).  Defendants also have failed to offer any evidence to explain \n11  why DNA testing of Ms. L. and S.S. was not completed during the four months that Ms. \n12  L. and S.S. were detained and during which time Ms. L. consistently maintained parentage, \n13  but occurred only after the Court ordered it.   \n14    Because Defendants have not shown that Ms. L. was released from detention and \n15  reunited  with  her  daughter  for  reasons  other  than  this  litigation,  the  Court  finds  the \n16  voluntary cessation exception applies to this case.  Applying that exception, Ms. L.’s claims \n17  are not moot.  \n18  B.  Habeas Jurisdiction \n19    Defendants’  second  argument  in  support  of  dismissal  is  that  the  Court  lacks \n20  jurisdiction over Ms. C.’s habeas claim because she did not name the warden of the \n21  institution in which she was detained.  “[L]ongstanding practice confirms that in habeas \n22  challenges to present physical confinement—‘core challenges’—the default rule is that the \n23  proper respondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held, not the \n24  Attorney General or some other remote supervisory official.”  Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 \n25  U.S. 426, 435 (2004).  Here, Ms. C. is not raising a “core challenge.”  This is especially so \n26  now that she has been released on bond.  Rather, her habeas claim, like her other claims, is \n27  directed to the continued separation from her child.  (See Am. Compl. at 12) (asking the \n28  Court to “[o]rder defendants either to release class members along with their children, or \n8 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1337   Page 9 of 25\n \n1  to detain them together in the same facility[.]”).  Since Ms. C. is not raising a “core \n2  challenge,” she is not subject to the default rule set out above.  Absent this showing, the \n3  Court has jurisdiction over Ms. C.’s habeas claim.   \n4  C.  Venue \n5    Defendants’ third argument in support of dismissal is that this Court is the improper \n6  venue for adjudication of Ms. C.’s claims because Ms. C. does not reside in this district nor \n7  did the events giving rise to her claim occur in this district.  Plaintiffs respond that \n8  regardless of Ms. C.’s claims, this is the proper venue for Ms. L.’s claims, and that is \n9  sufficient in this putative class case against the Government.  Plaintiffs rely on 28 U.S.C. \n10  § 1391(e)(1) for the proposition that if any plaintiff resides in the district in which an action \n11  is brought against government entities, venue is proper in that district.  Section 1391(e)(1) \n12  states:  \n13  A civil action in which a defendant is an officer or employee of the United \nStates or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of \n14 \nlegal authority, or an agency of the United States, or the United States, may, \n15  except as otherwise provided by law, be brought in any judicial district in \nwhich (A) a defendant in the action resides, (B) a substantial part of the events \n16 \nor omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property \n17  that is the subject of the action is situated, or (C) the plaintiff resides if no real \nproperty is involved in the action. \n18 \n   \n19  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  In Sidney Coal Co. v. Soc. Security Admin., 427 F.3d 336 (6th Cir. \n20  2005), the court was asked to decide whether the term “the plaintiff” in subsection (C) of \n21  this statute referred to only one plaintiff or all plaintiffs.  Id. at 344.  After reviewing the \n22  “plethora of case law interpreting the statute,” the court refused to interpret the statute to \n23  require all plaintiffs to reside in the relevant district, finding the statute “contains no \n24  requirement that all plaintiffs must reside in the same district.”  Id.  The court found that to \n25  hold otherwise “would substantially limit the statute’s breadth[.]”  Id.  It also found “[e]ach \n26  court faced with the same issue has interpreted ‘the plaintiff’ to mean ‘any plaintiff,’ \n27  finding that Congress intended to broaden the number of districts in which suits could be \n28  brought against government entities.”  Id. at 344-45.  Ultimately, the court held “that the \n9 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1338   Page 10 of 25\n \n1  residency requirement of [28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C)] is satisfied if at least one plaintiff \n2  resides in the district in which the action has been brought.”  Id. at 345-46.  This reasoning \n3  is persuasive.   \n4    There is no dispute Ms. L. was resident in this district when the original Complaint \n5  was filed.  Thus, venue in this Court is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C).   \n6  D.  Jurisdiction to Review “Discretionary” Decisions \n7    Defendants’  fourth  argument  in  support  of  dismissal  is  that  this  Court  lacks \n8  jurisdiction to review the Government’s decision to either detain or parole Plaintiffs, and \n9  also lacks jurisdiction to review where Plaintiffs will be detained or to order ICE to detain \n10  Plaintiffs in a particular facility.  Plaintiffs dispute that the Court lacks jurisdiction to \n11  review these decisions.   \n12    As to Defendants’ first argument about the decision to detain or parole, Plaintiffs are \n13  not challenging that particular decision.  (See Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss at 12) (stating \n14  Amended Complaint “does not seek an injunction ordering Defendants to grant parole; \n15  rather, it seeks an injunction to reunite Plaintiffs with their children, ‘either’ by ‘detain[ing] \n16  them together in the same facility,’ or by ‘releas[ing] class members along with their \n17  children.’”).3  Rather, Plaintiffs are challenging the Government’s practice of separating \n18 \n19                                                  \n20 \n3  There are sound reasons for not challenging this decision.  Individuals in the expedited \n21  removal process who have not been found to have a “credible fear of persecution” for \nasylum purposes are subject to mandatory detention.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV).  \n22 \nThese individuals may be released only if they are granted parole, i.e., released under \n23  narrowly prescribed circumstances, such as “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant \npublic benefit[,]” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A), medical emergency or a “legitimate law \n24 \nenforcement objective.”  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(2)(iii).  Furthermore, an alien who is subject \n25  to expedited removal and who is seeking to establish that he or she has a credible fear of \npersecution, is not eligible for release on bond.  8 C.F.R. §§ 235.3(c), 1003.19(h)(2)(i)(B).  \n26 \nIf the asylum officer or Immigration Judge (“IJ”) determines that the alien has a credible \n27  fear of persecution, expedited removal proceedings are vacated and the alien is referred for \nremoval proceedings before an IJ under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f).  These \n28 \naliens may be released from detention through a grant of parole under narrowly prescribed \n10 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1339   Page 11 of 25\n \n1  minor  children  from  their  parents  without  legitimate  reason,  irrespective  of  the \n2  Government’s general authority to detain or release.  Defendants’ argument, therefore, \n3  does not warrant dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims.   \n4    Next, Defendants argue the Court lacks jurisdiction to review where Plaintiffs will \n5  be detained or to order ICE to detain Plaintiffs in a particular facility.  In support of this \n6  argument, Defendants rely on 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) and 8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1).  \n7  Section  1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)  precludes  courts  from  reviewing  decisions  of  the  Attorney \n8  General or Secretary of DHS if the conduct at issue is specified in the particular statute to \n9  be in their discretion.  It states:  \n10  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law  (statutory  or  nonstatutory), \nincluding section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, or any other habeas \n11 \ncorpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, and except as \n12  provided  in  subparagraph  (D),  and  regardless  of  whether  the  judgment, \ndecision, or  action is  made  in  removal proceedings, no  court  shall have \n13 \njurisdiction to review— ... \n14   \n(ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of \n15 \nHomeland Security the authority for which is specified under this title to be in \n16  the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nother than the granting of relief under section 208(a).   \n17 \n \n18  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  Defendants assert the Attorney General’s \n19  decisions about where aliens will be detained falls within this statute.  Specifically, they \n20  assert that 8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1), which provides, “The Attorney General shall arrange for \n21  appropriate places of detention for aliens detained pending removal or a decision on \n22  removal[,]” id., grants the Attorney General discretion to make those decisions, and under \n23  § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), those decisions are not subject to review by the courts.   \n24    This is not the first time the Government has raised this argument.  See Aguilar v. \n25  United States Immig. & Customs Enf’t Div. of the Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 510 F.3d 1 (1st \n26 \n                                                \n27 \ncircumstances, such as an “urgent humanitarian reason or significant public benefit.”  8 \n28 \nU.S.C. § 1182(b)(5); 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(b).   \n11 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1340   Page 12 of 25\n \n1  Cir. 2007).  In Aguilar, the court rejected the Government’s “sprawling construction of \n2  section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)[,]” stating “so broad a reading is not evident from the statute’s \n3  text.”  Id. at 20.  Instead, the court found “section 1231(g)(1) fails to ‘specify’ that \n4  individualized transfer decisions are in the Attorney General’s discretion.”  Id.  The court \n5  contrasted the language of section 1231(g)(1) with “other sections of the [Immigration and \n6  Nationality Act (“INA”)]” in which that discretion is explicitly provided, specifically 8 \n7  U.S.C. §§ 1157(c)(1), 1181(a)(9)(B)(v), 1184(c)(6)(F) and 1229b(b)(2)(D).  Id.  The court \n8  also cited to Alaka v. Att’y Gen., 456 F.3d 88 (3d Cir. 2006), which states “there are no less \n9  than thirty-two additional provisions in the very subchapter of the INA referenced by 8 \n10  U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) that make explicit the grant of ‘discretion’ to the Attorney \n11  General or the Secretary of Homeland Security[.]”  Id. at 97.  In light of this authority, the \n12  Aguilar court held, “[i]f a statute does not explicitly specify a particular authority as \n13  discretionary, section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not bar judicial review of an ensuing agency \n14  action.”  510 F.3d at 20; see also Spencer Enters., Inc. v. United States, 345 F.3d 683, 691 \n15  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (stating  “the  plain  language  of  §  1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)  requires  that \n16  discretionary authority be specified by statute[.]”).  Ultimately, the Aguilar court held \n17  “section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not strip the district courts of jurisdiction over substantive \n18  due process claims that are collateral to removal proceedings when those claims challenge \n19  decisions about the detention and transfer of aliens on family integrity grounds.”  510 F.3d \n20  at 21.   \n21    Defendants do not explain why this reasoning should not apply here.  Instead, they \n22  rely on a decision from the Ninth Circuit finding the Attorney General has broad discretion \n23  in deciding where to house deportable aliens.  See Comm. of Cent. Am. Refugees v. I.N.S., \n24  795  F.2d  1434  (9th  Cir.  1986).    That  decision,  however,  predates  8  U.S.C.  § \n25  1252(a)(2)(B)(ii),  which  is  the  starting  point  for  Defendants’  jurisdiction-stripping \n26  argument.  Moreover, in Comm. of Cent. Am. Refugees, the Ninth Circuit addressed the \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n12 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1341   Page 13 of 25\n \n1  merits of the plaintiffs’ claim, which assumes jurisdiction.  795 F.2d at 1437-41.4  Aguilar, \n2  by  contrast,  addresses  8  U.S.C.  §  1252(a)(2)(B)(ii),  the  leading  Supreme  Court  case \n3  interpreting that statute, Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233 (2010), and the other statute \n4  forming the basis for Defendants’ argument, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1).  The Aguilar court’s \n5  analysis of these statutes is faithful to statutory text and persuasive.  This Court, therefore, \n6  concludes it has jurisdiction to review the Government’s conduct at issue.5    \n7  E.  Due Process \n8    Next, Defendants argue Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for violation of their \n9  due process rights.  In reviewing this argument, the Court is bound to accept all well-\n10  pleaded factual allegations in the Amended Complaint as true, construe those allegations \n11  “in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,” Silvas v. E*Trade Mortg. Corp., 514 \n12  F.3d 1001, 1003 (9th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted), and “then determine whether they \n13  plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.   \n14    The parties do not dispute the following bedrock principles.  The Constitution \n15  protects everyone within the territory of the United States, regardless of citizenship.  (Br. \n16  of Scholars of Immig. and Const. Law as Amici Curiae at 3, ECF No. 23-1) (citing Yick \n17  Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 368-69(1886)).  “Repeatedly and consistently, the Supreme \n18  Court and the Ninth Circuit have held that non-citizens physically on U.S. soil have \n19  constitutional rights, including the right to due process of law.”  (Id. at 4) (citing, among \n20 \n                                                \n21 \n4  In Comm. of Cent. Am. Refugees, the Ninth Circuit held that the government’s policy of \n22 \ntransferring unrepresented aliens to remote detention facilities “did not violate the due \n23  process clause or any  statutory privilege[,]” and “prudential considerations precluded \ninterference with the Attorney General’s [exercise of] discretion” in selecting the detention \n24 \nfacilities where aliens are to be detained.  795 F.2d at 1439-40. \n25  5  Even if § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) acted as a statutory bar to Plaintiffs’ claims, the Ninth Circuit \nhas held “decisions that violate the Constitution cannot be ‘discretionary,’ so claims of \n26 \nconstitutional violations are not barred by § 1252(a)(2)(B).”  Wong v. United States, 373 \n27  F.3d 952, 963 (9th Cir. 2004).  Plaintiffs have clearly alleged separation from their children \nviolated their due process rights.  Thus, this rule would apply, and would allow for judicial \n28 \nreview.   \n13 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1342   Page 14 of 25\n \n1  other cases, Matthews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 77 (1976) (stating “there ‘are literally millions \n2  of aliens within the jurisdiction of the United States’” and “‘the Fifth Amendment . . . \n3  protects  every  one of  these  persons[.]’”)).    “Aliens,”  therefore,  have  substantive due \n4  process rights under the Constitution.  Id. (collecting cases).6   \n5    Further, it has long been settled that the liberty interest identified in the Fifth \n6  Amendment provides a right to family integrity or to familial association.  See U.S. Const. \n7  amend. V (stating no person shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due \n8  process of law.”); Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.S. 246, 255 (1978) (stating “the relationship \n9  between parent and child is constitutionally protected.”).  Indeed, “[t]he liberty interest at \n10  issue in this case–the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children–\n11  is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by” the Court.  Troxel \n12  v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000); see also Rosenbaum v. Washoe Cty., 663 F.3d 1071, \n13  1079 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The substantive due process right to family integrity or to familial \n14  association is well established.”).  In sum, there is no dispute the constitutional right to \n15  family integrity applies to aliens like Ms. L. and Ms. C. \n16    Rather, the dispute here is twofold: (1) whether the substantive due process right to \n17  family integrity applies not to Plaintiffs, generally, but in the particular circumstances \n18  alleged; and (2) if so, whether the conduct attributed to the Government violates that right.  \n19  It bears repeating that at this stage of the case, Plaintiffs need not prove either of these \n20  questions should be resolved in their favor.  The only issue here is whether Plaintiffs have \n21  alleged sufficient facts and a cognizable legal theory giving rise to a “plausible claim for \n22  relief.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.  In this context, the Court addresses these two issues in \n23  turn.   \n24   \n25                                                  \n26 \n6  At oral argument, Government counsel conceded the point, “The Court:  So you would \n27  agree that because these individuals [Ms. L. and Ms. C.] are present in the United States \nthat substantive due process attaches[?]  . . . [Gov’t counsel]:  That’s correct[.]”  (Rep.’s \n28 \nTr. at 4-5, May 9, 2018, ECF No. 70.) \n14 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1343   Page 15 of 25\n \n1    1.  Does the Constitutional Right to Family Integrity Apply in the Circumstances \n    Alleged? \n2 \n \n3    The constitutional right to family integrity “is entirely judge-made: it does not appear \n4  in the text of the Constitution itself.”  Keates v. Koile, 883 F.3d 1228, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018).  \n5  Furthermore, the “right to family integrity has been recognized in only a narrow subset of \n6  circumstances.”  Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 23 (stating alien “petitioners have not demonstrated \n7  that this guarantee of substantive due process [the liberty interest in family integrity] \n8  encompasses their assertions.”); see also Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720 \n9  (1997) (quoting Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992)) (noting courts must \n10  be “‘reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process.’”).  Plaintiffs, therefore, \n11  must show that their generally held constitutional right to family integrity applies in the \n12  particular circumstances alleged here.   \n13    In determining whether the right to family integrity encompasses the circumstances \n14  alleged here, it is important to note what Plaintiffs do not challenge.  They do not challenge \n15  the Government’s initial separation of parent and child when the parent is arrested for \n16  violating the nation’s criminal laws.  Nor do Plaintiffs challenge the Government’s decision \n17  to separate families when there are legitimate questions regarding parentage, fitness, or \n18  danger to the child.  Nor do they challenge the Government’s powers to deport or detain \n19  aliens.  What Plaintiffs challenge is the Government’s separation of migrant parents and \n20  their minor children when both are held in immigration detention and when there has been \n21  no showing the parent is unfit or poses a danger to the child.  Plaintiffs assert separation of \n22  parents and minor children under such circumstances violates their due process rights.   \n23    Defendants argue the contours of the right to family integrity are different depending \n24  on the circumstances, and that under the circumstances of this case, which involve the \n25  Government’s enforcement of criminal and immigration laws, there is no constitutional \n26  violation.  Specifically, the Government argues that when a parent is detained for removal \n27  or criminal prosecution, the minor child becomes “unaccompanied” and must be placed in \n28  the “care and custody” of ORR.  Separation of the family unit, therefore, is simply a \n15 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1344   Page 16 of 25\n \n1  consequence of the lawful detention of the parent.  In support of this argument, Defendants \n2  rely on a number of cases dealing with immigration detainees and convicts who have been \n3  separated  from  their  families  without  constitutional  implication,  but  those  cases  are \n4  distinguishable from this case.  See, e.g., Milan-Rodriguez v. Sessions, No. 1:16-cv-01578-\n5  AWI-SAB-HC, 2018 WL 400317, at *10 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 12, 2018) (stating transfer of \n6  petitioner  convicted  of  crime  to  remote  facility  is  “ordinary  incident  of  immigration \n7  detention” and does not violate right to familial association); Gordon v. Mule, 153 Fed. \n8  Appx. 39 (2d Cir. 2005) (stating right to family unity not violated when petitioner ordered \n9  removed after conviction of crime).  Plaintiffs argue those cases involve challenges to a \n10  parent’s detention and transfer away from children who were not themselves initially \n11  detained with their parents.  According to Plaintiffs, the practice alleged here “is not a \n12  necessary incident of detention; it is the result of an unnecessary governmental action \n13  intended to separate family units who were arrested together[.]”  (Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss \n14  at 21.)   \n15    The Government also cites cases that subordinate the right to family integrity of \n16  citizen children when their non-citizen parents are deported.  See, e.g., Gallanosa by \n17  Gallanosa v. United States, 785 F.2d 116 (4th Cir. 1986) (parents ordered deported after \n18  overstaying visa causing family separation).  But Plaintiffs are not contesting the grounds \n19  for  their  potential  removal—only  their  treatment  by  the  Government  during  their \n20  immigration proceedings.   \n21    The Government also cites cases where interference with the right to family integrity \n22  was upheld in furtherance of identified safety or other penological interests.  See, e.g., \n23  Overton v. Bazetta, 539 U.S. 126, 133 (2003) (upholding restrictions on family visitation \n24  of sentenced prisoners for security reasons and “to protect[ ] child visitors from exposure \n25  to sexual or other misconduct[.]”).  However, Plaintiffs argue the Government is acting \n26  without determining parentage, fitness or danger to the child (or any other legitimate \n27  reason), let alone for a stated security reason.   \n28 \n16 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1345   Page 17 of 25\n \n1    The case that provides the most support for Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs’ \n2  constitutional right to familial association is not implicated here is Aguilar.  But it, too, is \n3  factually distinguishable.  In that case, ICE agents conducted a raid of the plaintiffs’ \n4  workplace as part of an investigation into the employment practices of a government \n5  contractor “suspected of employing large numbers of illegal aliens.”  Aguilar, 510 F.3d at \n6  6.  As part of the raid, ICE agents “took more than 300 rank-and-file employees into \n7  custody  for  civil  immigration  infractions.”    Id.    In  the  days  following  the  raid, \n8  approximately  200  of  those  employees  were  transferred  from  a  holding  facility  in \n9  Massachusetts, where the raid took place, to detention centers in Texas for removal.  Id.  \n10  Because of the surprise nature of the raid, “a substantial number of the detainees’ minor \n11  children were left for varying periods of time without adult supervision.”  Id.  As a result, \n12  the plaintiffs filed a complaint in district court alleging “in essence that their immediate \n13  detention and swift transfer to distant [detention and removal operations centers] wreaked \n14  havoc with their right to make decisions about the care, custody, and control of their minor \n15  children, leaving many minors unattended.”  Id. at 22.  The court in Aguilar looked to the \n16  nature of the right at issue, and expressed concern for expanding that right to the facts of \n17  the case, and concluded plaintiffs had not demonstrated that the right to family integrity \n18  “encompasse[d]” their claims.  Id. at 23-24.   \n19    However,  unlike  Plaintiffs  in  this  case,  none  of  the  plaintiffs  in  Aguilar  were \n20  detained with their children.  Instead, the plaintiffs in Aguilar appear to have been detained \n21  at the worksite while their children were elsewhere in the community.7  Because the context \n22 \n23                                                  \n24 \n7  The court in Aguilar noted, “ICE attempted to coordinate with social services agencies \n25  to assure the adequate care of dependent children[,] … took affirmative steps before and \nafter the raid to attend to family needs[,] …[and] immediately released thirty-five persons \n26 \nwho had been apprehended due to ‘pressing humanitarian needs’ (such as being the sole \n27  caregiver of one or more minor children).”  510 F.3d at 22 n.5 (citing findings of the district \ncourt).  In light of the differences with Aguilar, Plaintiffs have disavowed that the class \n28 \nalleged in the Amended Complaint would include parents like those in Aguilar, suggesting \n17 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1346   Page 18 of 25\n \n1  and details of the present case are different from those presented in Aguilar, that court’s \n2  analysis of the plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights has limited application here.  See \n3  id. at 22 (quoting DePoutot v. Raffaelly, 424 F.3d 112, 119 (1st Cir. 2005)) (noting “the \n4  jurisprudence of substantive due process is an exercise that is ‘highly dependent on context \n5  and detail.’”).   \n6    Here, the Court is faced with Plaintiffs who present different circumstances, but each \n7  Plaintiff has demonstrated that the right to family integrity encompasses her particular \n8  situation.  According to the allegations in the Amended Complaint, Ms. L. did everything \n9  right.  She and her child presented at the port of entry and requested asylum.  She passed a \n10  credible fear screening interview, was taken out of expedited removal proceedings, and \n11  placed in removal proceedings before an IJ to pursue her asylum claim.  Ms. C., by contrast, \n12  did not do everything right.  She committed a crime by entering the United States illegally, \n13  and  was  prosecuted  and  imprisoned  for  her  transgression:  25  days  in  custody  for \n14  misdemeanor violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325 (illegal entry).  However, having served her \n15  sentence, Ms. C. was then returned to ICE detention to pursue her asylum claim, as she too \n16  had passed a credible fear screening.  Ms. C., therefore, is on equal footing with Ms. L. for \n17  purposes of  pursuing  her  due  process  claim.    Ms.  L.’s  claim  is  based on  the  initial \n18  separation from her child, while Ms. C.’s claim is based on the continued separation from \n19  her child.  Both claims focus on government conduct in separating families during removal \n20  proceedings. \n21    Although Plaintiffs do not limit this case to asylum seekers, that each of the named \n22  Plaintiffs is seeking asylum is important to the due process analysis.  “U.S. asylum law \n23  arises largely out of international agreements that have been incorporated into immigration \n24  law.”  Kevin R. Johnson, Understanding Immigration Law, 2d. Ed. (2015), at 353.  Those \n25  international agreements came about after World War II displaced millions of people and \n26 \n                                                \n27 \nthat the facts in Aguilar are “more analogous to a pretrial criminal case.”  (Rep.’s Tr. at 35, \n28 \nMay 9, 2018, ECF No. 70.)   \n18 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1347   Page 19 of 25\n \n1  created the need for international collaboration to address the refugee crisis.  See id.  In the \n2  early 1950s, the United Nations Convention Relating to Status of Refugees (“Convention”) \n3  attempted to provide a uniform protocol for refugee policy, and the United States is now a \n4  signatory to that Convention.  See id.  According to the Convention, a “refugee” is someone \n5  who (1) is outside his or her country of nationality, (2) has fled that country and cannot \n6  return home because he or she faces the reality or the risk of persecution, and (3) faces \n7  persecution due to his or her political opinion, race, religion, nationality, or membership in \n8  a particular social group.  See id. at 353-54.  These concepts have been incorporated into \n9  U.S.  law,  specifically  the  INA.    See,  e.g.,  INA  §  101(a)(42)  (adopting  definition  of \n10  refugee); 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42).   \n11    Asylum “has been a formal part of U.S. domestic law for 38 years.”  Deborah Anker, \n12  Law of Asylum, in the United States § 1.1 (2018).  The Refugee Act, PL 96-212, 94 Stat. \n13  102 (1980), in particular, “codified provisions for persons to apply for asylum status[.]”  \n14  Id.  According to its provisions, “a person who applies for asylum protection must be \n15  physically present or ‘arriving’ in the United States.”  Id. at § 1.6 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1158).  \n16  The act of seeking sanctuary from persecution in accordance with our country’s own \n17  asylum laws is significant given that due process is particularly concerned with “ordered \n18  liberty” and “fundamental fairness.”  Lassiter v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of Durham Cty., N.C., \n19  452 U.S. 18, 24 (1981).  Arriving on United States soil with one’s minor child to pursue \n20  relief extended by U.S. law—as well as international law to which the United States has \n21  acceded—calls out for careful assessment of how governmental actors treat such people \n22  and whether constitutional protections should apply.   \n23    In this case, both Ms. L. and Ms. C. allege they are seeking asylum in the United \n24  States, and that they were separated from their children upon arriving at our nation’s border \n25  without any determination they were unfit or presented a danger to their children.  They \n26  allege they are victims of a wide-spread government practice to separate migrant families \n27  “for no legitimate reason and notwithstanding the threat of irreparable psychological \n28  damage that separation has been universally recognized to cause young children.”  (Am. \n19 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1348   Page 20 of 25\n \n1  Compl. ¶ 1.)  They allege this practice may soon become “formal national policy” for \n2  purposes of deterring others from coming to the United States.  (Id. ¶ 34b;8 see also Opp’n \n3  to Mot. to Dismiss at 2 & 16 n.12) (citations omitted)).   \n4  Notably, Plaintiffs’ allegations are similar to those pointed out by the court in \n5  Aguilar as being sufficient to demonstrate that the guarantee of substantive due process \n6  encompasses their assertions:  “Were a substantial number of young children knowingly \n7  placed in harm’s way, it is easy to imagine how viable [due process] claims might lie.”  \n8  510 F.3d at 22.  The allegations here present that “narrow subset of circumstances[,]” id., \n9  at 23, where the right to family integrity ought to apply.  The Court finds it does.   \n10    2.  Does the Alleged Governmental Conduct “Shock the Conscience” and Violate \n    the Right to Family Integrity? \n11 \n \n12    Where substantive due process applies to the particular circumstances alleged, as \n13  here, the “threshold question is whether the behavior of the governmental officer is so \n14  egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”  \n15  Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847 n.8 (1998).  Plaintiffs dispute that the \n16  “shock the conscience” test applies, (see Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss at 22), but they fail to \n17  explain what test should apply.  Plaintiffs appear to argue they have “[s]tated a substantive \n18  due  process  claim”  simply  by  alleging  facts  that show  the government  is  separating \n19  children from their parents “absent a clear demonstration that the parent is unfit or is \n20  otherwise endangering the child.”  (Id. at 15-16.)  In support, Plaintiffs cite Quilloin for the \n21  settled principle that “the Due Process Clause would be offended ‘[i]f a State were to \n22  attempt to force the breakup of a natural family . . . without some showing of unfitness[.]”  \n23  434 U.S. at 255 (quoting Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, 431 U.S. 816, 862-63 \n24  (1977)).  But the Supreme Court has also made clear that “the substantive component of \n25  the Due Process Clause is violated by executive action only when it ‘can properly be \n26 \n                                                \n27 \n8  The Amended Complaint lists Paragraphs 33 and 34 twice.  The Court refers to the second \n28 \nparagraphs as Paragraphs 33b and 34b.   \n20 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1349   Page 21 of 25\n \n1  characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense.’”  Lewis, 523 \n2  U.S. at 847 (quoting Collins, 503 U.S. at 128).  See also Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 21 (applying \n3  “shock the conscience” standard to determine whether plaintiffs stated substantive due \n4  process  claim  based  on  government’s  separation  of  parents  from  minor  children).  \n5  Defendant has relied on that standard in arguing Plaintiffs have failed to state a substantive \n6  due process claim, and Plaintiffs have briefed why the alleged government conduct meets \n7  the standard (though they dispute the standard applies at all).  On the present motion, the \n8  Court applies the “shocks the conscience” standard to determine whether Plaintiffs have \n9  alleged sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for violation of their substantive due \n10  process rights.9  \n11  The “touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action \n12  of government,” Wolf v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 558 (1974), and the “exercise of power \n13  without  any  reasonable  justification  in  the  service  of  a  legitimate  governmental \n14  objective[.]”  Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846.  The due process guarantee bars certain offensive \n15  government actions “regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.”  \n16  Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331 (1986)).  It targets governmental conduct that \n17  violates the “decencies of civilized conduct[,]” Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 173 \n18  (1952), interferes with rights “‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty[,]’” id. at 169 \n19  (quoting Palko v. State of Conn., 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937)), and is so “‘brutal’ and \n20  ‘offensive’ that it [does] not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency[.]”  \n21  Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432, 435 (1957).  Thus, substantive due process protects \n22  against government power arbitrarily and oppressively exercised.  Daniels, 474 U.S. at \n23  331.  “Historically, this guarantee of due process has been applied to deliberate decisions \n24 \n25                                                  \n26 \n9  The Court reserves on whether a different test might apply as the case develops and the \n27  issues are more clearly framed through discovery and other substantive motions.  See, e.g., \nHalet v. Wend Inv. Co., 672 F.2d 1305, 1310-11 (9th Cir. 1982) (policy precluding renting \n28 \nto families with children analyzed under strict scrutiny test).   \n21 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1350   Page 22 of 25\n \n1  of government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty, or property.”  Id.  Accordingly, \n2  “the ‘shock the conscience’ standard erects a high hurdle for would-be claimants.”  Aguilar, \n3  510 F.3d at 21.  Plaintiffs have set forth sufficient facts to satisfy this requirement and to \n4  survive the present motion.   \n5    Plaintiffs allege they both suffered wrenching separation from their children for “no \n6  legitimate purpose” and in furtherance of a wide-spread government practice that soon may \n7  become “national policy.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 31, 34b.)  A policy of family separation to \n8  serve “ulterior law enforcement goals” admittedly would be “antithetical to the child \n9  welfare values” imposed on government actors by the TVPRA.  (Opp’n to Mot. for Prelim. \n10  Inj. at 3, ECF No. 46.)  Yet, Plaintiffs allege that practice is being implemented in full view \n11  of the “devastating negative impact” that separation has on a “child’s well-being, especially \n12  where there are other traumatic factors at work, and that this damage can be permanent.”  \n13  (Am. Compl. ¶ 33.)  (See also Br. by Amici Curiae in Supp. of Pl.’s Habeas Corpus Pet. \n14  and Compl. at 2-3, ECF No. 17-3 (describing psychological and emotional trauma that is \n15  visited upon young children when they are separated from their parents)).  As for their own \n16  children, Plaintiffs allege S.S. was screaming, crying, and “pleading with guards not to take \n17  her away from her mother[,]” (Am. Compl. ¶ 43), and J. is struggling emotionally.  (Id. ¶ \n18  59.)  Plaintiffs also allege they, themselves, are consumed by feelings of desperation and \n19  worry.  (Id. ¶¶ 48, 58.)   \n20    These allegations call sharply into question the separations of Plaintiffs from their \n21  minor children.  This is especially so because Plaintiffs allegedly came to the United States \n22  seeking shelter from persecution in their home countries, and are seeking asylum here.  For \n23  Plaintiffs, the government actors responsible for the “care and custody” of migrant children \n24  have, in fact, become their persecutors.  This is even more problematic given Plaintiffs’ \n25  allegations and assertions that there is a government practice, and possibly a forthcoming \n26  policy, to separate parents from their minor children in an effort to deter others from \n27  coming to the United States.  This alleged practice is being implemented even when parents \n28  like Ms. L. and Ms. C. have passed credible fear interviews, and therefore, are positioned \n22 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1351   Page 23 of 25\n \n1  to present asylum claims meriting consideration by an IJ in their removal proceedings.  \n2  These allegations sufficiently describe government conduct that arbitrarily tears at the \n3  sacred bond between parent and child, and is emblematic of the “exercise of power without \n4  any  reasonable  justification  in  the  service  of  an  otherwise  legitimate  governmental \n5  objective[.]”  Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846.  Such conduct, if true, as it is assumed to be on the \n6  present motion, is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair \n7  play and decency.  At a minimum, the facts alleged are sufficient to show the government \n8  conduct at issue “shocks the conscience” and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to \n9  family integrity.  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ due process claim \n10  is denied.10   \n11  F.  The APA \n12    Next,  Defendants  argue  Plaintiffs  have  not  stated  a  claim  under  the  APA.  \n13  Defendants assert the APA does not provide for judicial review of discretionary decisions.  \n14  Defendants also contend their decisions to separate Plaintiffs from their minor children was \n15  not arbitrary or capricious, those decisions do not constitute “final agency actions,” and \n16  there are other adequate remedies available.   \n17    Under the APA, “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action \n18  for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.”  5 \n19 \n                                                \n20 \n21  10  The above discussion is focused on whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim for violation \nof their substantive due process rights.  Plaintiffs also allege a claim for violation of their \n22 \nprocedural due process rights in light of the Government’s practice of “separating families \n23  without any process to determine whether the separation is justified by parental abuse, \nunfitness, or any other reason.”  (Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss at 23.)  Defendants move to \n24 \ndismiss on the ground there is no substantive due process right to familial association under \n25  these circumstances, and assert Plaintiffs’ procedural due process argument “is really [a] \n‘substantive due process argument recast in procedural terms.’”  (Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. \n26 \nof Mot. to Dismiss at 18) (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 293 (1993)) (internal \n27  quotation marks omitted).  In light of the above discussion, the Court declines to address \nfurther Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim.     \n28 \n \n23 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1352   Page 24 of 25\n \n1  U.S.C. § 704.  The conduct at issue in this case, separation of parents from their minor \n2  children when both are in immigration detention and when there is no showing the parent \n3  is unfit or presents a danger to the child, is not reviewable by statute.  Thus, the issue is \n4  whether this conduct is a “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy \n5  in a court.”  There are two conditions that: \n6  must be satisfied for agency action to be “final” under the APA.  “First, the \naction must mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process \n7 \n- it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.  And second, the \n8  action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or \nfrom which legal consequences will flow.”   \n9 \n \n10  United States Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., ___ U.S. ___, 136 S.Ct. 1807, 1813 \n11  (2016) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997)).  Here, Plaintiffs have not \n12  alleged separation from their children satisfies either of these requirements.  Nor did they \n13  address these requirements in their opposition brief.  Furthermore, since the filing of the \n14  Complaint Ms. L. has been reunited with her daughter, and the Government claims in its \n15  briefing that it is in the process of deciding whether to reunify Ms. C. and her son pursuant \n16  to the TVPRA.  Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient \n17  to show “final agency action” subject to review under the APA.  Based on this failure, the \n18  Court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss this claim.  \n19  G.  The Asylum Act \n20    Finally, Defendants argue Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the Asylum \n21  Act.  Defendants assert Plaintiffs lack standing to bring a claim under the Act, and have \n22  failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim under the Act.   \n23    Initially, it is unclear what portion of the Asylum Statute Plaintiffs are relying on as \n24  the basis for this claim.  They cite 8 U.S.C. § 1158 in their Amended Complaint, and allege \n25  separation from their children violates the statute “because it impedes their ability to pursue \n26  their asylum claims.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 85.)  However, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d), which sets out \n27  the  procedure  for  applying  for  asylum,  states:  “Nothing  in  this  subsection  shall  be \n28  construed to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable \n24 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 71   Filed 06/06/18   PageID.1353   Page 25 of 25\n \n1  by any party against the United States or its agencies or officers or any other person.”  8 \n2  U.S.C. § 1158(d)(7).  Although no party addressed this subsection of the statute on the \n3  present motion, it is unclear to the Court whether Plaintiffs have a private right of action \n4  under the Asylum Statute in the first instance.  Absent any authority that a private right of \n5  action exists, the Court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss this claim.    \n6  III. \n7  CONCLUSION AND ORDER \n8    For the reasons set out above, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants’ \n9  motion to dismiss.  Specifically, the Court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ \n10  claims under the APA and the Asylum Statute, and denies Defendants’ motion to dismiss \n11  Plaintiffs’ due process claim.  Although Plaintiffs did not request leave to amend in the \n12  event any portion of Defendants’ motion was granted, the Court grants Plaintiffs leave to \n13  file a Second Amended Complaint that cures the pleading deficiencies set out above.  If \n14  Plaintiffs wish to do so, they shall file their Second Amended Complaint on or before July \n15  3, 2018.   \n16    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n17  Dated:  June 6, 2018   \n18 \n19 \n \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n25 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) ",

This case challenges the United States government’s forcible \n \n2 \n  separation of parents from their young children for no legitimate reason and \n3   \nnotwithstanding the threat of irreparable damage that separation has been \n \n4 \n  universally recognized to cause young children. \n5   \n2.  Plaintiff Ms. L. is the mother of a seven (7) year-old daughter, who \n6 \nwas ripped away from her, and then sent halfway across the country to be detained \n7 \nalone. Plaintiff Ms. C. is the mother of a fourteen (14) year-old son, who was also \n8 \nforcibly separated from his mother and detained more than a thousand miles away.  \n9 \nDora is the mother of a thirteen (13) year-old daughter who was forcibly separated \n10 \nfrom her.  Alma is the mother of seven-year old and nine-year old sons who were \n11 \nforcibly separated from her.  \n12 \n3.  Ms. L., Ms. C., Dora, and Alma bring this action on behalf of \n13 \nthemselves and thousands of other parents whom the government has forcibly \n14 \nseparated from their children. Like Ms. L., Ms. C., Dora, and Alma, many of these \n15 \nindividuals have fled persecution and are seeking asylum in the United States. \n16 \nWithout any allegations of abuse, neglect, or parental unfitness, and with no \n17 \nhearings of any kind, the government is separating these families and detaining \n18 \ntheir young children, alone and frightened, in facilities often thousands of miles \n19 \nfrom their parents. \n20 \n4.  Forced separation from parents causes severe trauma to young \n21 \nchildren, especially those who are already traumatized and are fleeing persecution \n22 \nin their home countries. The resulting cognitive and emotional damage can be \n23 \npermanent. \n24 \n5.  Forced separation can also cause parents to experience symptom of \n25 \nacute stress response and corresponding cognitive impairments, which can in turn \n26 \nimpair the ability to meaningfully participate in a credible fear interview. \n27 \n28 \n    1  18cv0428 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 250   Filed 10/09/18   PageID.3998   Page 4 of 22\n \n \n \n6.  Defendants have ample ways to keep Plaintiffs together with their \n1 \n \n  children, as they have done for decades prior to their current practice. There are \n2 \n \nshelters that house families (including asylum-seekers) while they await the final \n3   \n  adjudication of their immigration cases. If, however, the government lawfully \n4 \n \ncontinues detaining these parents and young children, it must at a minimum detain \n5   \nthem together in one of its immigration family detention centers. \n6 \n7.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not permit the \n7 \ngovernment to forcibly take young children from their parents, without justification \n8 \nor even a hearing. That separation also violates the asylum statutes, which \n9 \nguarantee a meaningful right to apply for asylum, and the Administrative Procedure \n10 \nAct (APA), which prohibits unlawful and arbitrary government action. \n11 \n12  JURISDICTION \n8.  This case arises under the Fifth Amendment to the United States \n13 \nConstitution, federal asylum statutes, and the APA. The court has jurisdiction under \n14 \n28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction); 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas \n15 \njurisdiction); and Art. I., § 9, cl. 2 of the United States Constitution (“Suspension \n16 \nClause”). Plaintiffs are in custody for purposes of habeas jurisdiction. \n17 \n18 \nVENUE \n9.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Ms. L. was \n19 \n20  detained in this District when this action commenced, Defendants reside in this \n21  District, and a substantial portion of the relevant facts occurred within this District, \n22  including the Defendants’ implementation of their practice of separating immigrant \n23  parents from their children for no legitimate reason. \n24 \nPARTIES \n25  10.

Over the past year, the government has separated thousands of migrant \n2 \n \nfamilies for no legitimate purpose. The government’s true purpose in separating \n3   \n  these families was to deter future families from seeking refuge in the United States. \n4 \n \n33.  Many of these migrant families fled persecution and are seeking \n5   \nasylum. Although there are no allegations that the parents are unfit or abusing their \n6 \nchildren in any way, the government has forcibly separated them from their young \n7 \nchildren and detained the children, often far away, in facilities for “unaccompanied” \n8 \nminors. \n9 \n34.  There is overwhelming medical evidence that the separation of a \n10 \nyoung child from his or her parent will have a devastating negative impact on the \n11 \nchild’s well-being, especially where there are other traumatic factors at work, and \n12 \nthat this damage can be permanent. \n13 \n35.  The American Association of Pediatrics has denounced the \n14 \nAdministration’s practice of separating migrant children from their parents, noting \n15 \nthat: “The psychological distress, anxiety, and depression associated with \n16 \nseparation from a parent would follow the children well after the immediate period \n17 \nof separation—even after the eventual reunification with a parent or other family.” \n18 \n19  36.  Prior Administrations detained migrant families, but did not have a \n20  practice of forcibly separating fit parents from their young children. \n21  37.  There are non-governmental shelters that specialize in housing and \n22  caring for families—including asylum seeking families—while their immigration \n23  applications are adjudicated. \n24  38.  There are also government-operated family detention centers where \n25  parents can be housed together with their children, should the government lawfully \n26  decide not to release them. The government previously detained, and continues to \n27  detain, numerous family units at those facilities. \n28 \n    5  18cv0428 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 250   Filed 10/09/18   PageID.4002   Page 8 of 22\n \n \n \n39.  In April 2018, the New York Times reported that more than “700 \n1 \n \n  children have been taken from adults claiming to be their parents since October [of \n2 \n \n2016], including more than 100 children under the age of 4.” Caitlin Dickerson, \n3   \n  Hundreds of Children Have Been Taken from Parents at U.S. Border, N.Y. Times, \n4 \n \nApr. 20, 2018. \n5   \n40.  On May 7, 2018, Defendant Sessions announced “a new initiative” to \n6 \nrefer “100 percent” of immigrants who cross the Southwest border for criminal \n7 \nimmigration prosecutions, also known as the “zero-tolerance policy.” Defendant \n8 \nSessions stated that as part of that prosecution, all parents who are prosecuted \n9 \nwould be separated from their children. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General \n10 \nSessions Delivers Remarks to the Association of State Criminal Investigative \n11 \nAgencies 2018 Spring Conference (May 7, 2018). The purpose of this new policy \n12 \nwas to separate families in the hope that it would deter other families from seeking \n13 \nrefuge in the United States. \n14 \n41.  At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in May, a deputy chief of \n15 \nDefendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection testified that between May 6 and \n16 \nMay 19 alone, a total of 658 children were separated from their family members \n17 \n18  pursuant to this policy. The Washington Post reported that in the city of McAllen, \n19  Texas, 415 children were taken from their parents during a two week period.1 And \n20  in June 2018, the Department of Homeland Security reported that in the six weeks \n21  between April 19 and May 31, the administration took almost 2,000 children away \n22  from their parents.2 \n23  42.  Defendant Sessions and other government officials, including \n24  Defendant Nielsen, have repeatedly defended the separation of children from their \n25  parents in speeches and interviews with various media outlets.

Even if the separated child is released from custody and placed in a \n8 \ncommunity setting or foster care, the trauma of the ongoing separation continues. \n9 \n44.  By taking away their children, Defendants are coercing class members \n10 \ninto giving up their claims for asylum and other legal protection. Numerous class \n11 \nmembers have been told by CBP and ICE agents that they will see their children \n12 \nagain sooner if they withdraw their asylum applications and accept earlier \n13 \ndeportation.6 \n14 \n45.  Many class members have given up their asylum claims and stipulated \n15 \nto removal as a way to be reunited with their children faster. \n16 \n46.  For class members who have not been coerced into giving up their \n17 \n18  asylum claims, separation from their children has made those applications much \n19  more difficult. Separation prevents parents from helping their children apply for \n20  asylum and navigate removal proceedings. Separation also makes it harder for \n21 \n                                                 \n3  http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1801/16/cnr.04.html. \n22 \n4   https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/john-kelly-separating-children-from- parents-immigration-\n23  border/ \n5   https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/us/politics/trump-homeland-security- secretary-resign.html \n24 \n6  This practice has been widely reported.

The trauma of separation also renders asylum-seeking class members \n3   \n  too distraught to effectively pursue their asylum applications. See, e.g., Angelina \n4 \n \nChapin, Separated Parents Are Failing Asylum Screenings Because They’re So \n5   \nHeartbroken, Huffington Post (June 30, 2018).7 \n6 \n48.  Defendants have deported class members without their separated \n7 \nchildren. Their children are now stranded in the United States alone. Many of these \n8 \nparents are now struggling to make contact with their children, who are being \n9 \ndetained thousands of miles away across multiple international borders. See Miriam \n10 \nJordan, “I Can’t Go Without My Son, “a Mother Pleaded as She Was Deported to \n11 \nGuatemala, N.Y. Times (June 17, 2018).8 \n12 \n49.  On June 20, 2018, President Trump signed an Executive Order (“EO”) \n13 \npurporting to end certain family separations going forward.9 The EO directs DHS to \n14 \n“maintain custody of alien families during the pendency of any criminal improper \n15 \nentry or immigration proceedings.” \n16 \n50.  The EO directs DHS to separate families any time DHS determines \n17 \n18  that separation would protect “the child’s welfare.” It does not, however, set forth \n19  how that standard will be applied. In prior cases the government has applied that \n20  standard in a manner that is inconsistent with the child’s best interest, including in \n21  Ms. L’s case. \n22  51.  The EO makes no provision for reunifying the thousands of families \n23  who were separated prior to its issuance. \n                                                 \n24  7   https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/separated-parents-too-grief-stricken-to-seek-asylum-experts-\nsay_us_5b379974e4b08c3a8f6ad5d9. \n25 \n8   https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/us/immigration-deported-parents.html.

The EO makes no provision for returning separated children to parents \n1 \n \n  who have been already been deported without their children. \n2 \n \n3    NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n  53.  Ms. L. and her daughter S.S. are one of the many families that have \n4 \n \nrecently been separated by the government. \n5   \n54.  Ms. L. and her daughter are seeking asylum in the United States. \n6 \n55.  Ms. L. is Catholic and sought shelter in a church until she was able to \n7 \nescape the Congo with S.S. \n8 \n56.  Upon reaching the United States, Ms. L. and S.S. presented themselves \n9 \nat the San Ysidro, California Port of Entry on November 1, 2017. Although their \n10 \nnative language is Lingala, they were able to communicate to the border guards that \n11 \nthey sought asylum. \n12 \n57.  Based on her expression of a fear of returning to the Congo, Ms. L. \n13 \nwas referred for an initial screening before an asylum officer, called a “credible fear \n14 \ninterview.” She subsequently passed the credible fear screening but, until March 6, \n15 \n2018, remained detained in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in the San Diego area. \n16 \n58.  On or about November 5, immigration officials forcibly separated \n17 \nthen-6 year-old S.S. from her mother and sent S.S. to Chicago. There she was \n18 \n19  housed in a detention facility for “unaccompanied” minors run by the Office of \n20  Refugee Resettlement (ORR). \n21  59.  When S.S. was taken away from her mother, she was screaming and \n22  crying, pleading with guards not to take her away from her mother. While detained, \n23  Ms. L. spoke to her daughter approximately 6 times by phone, never by video. For \n24  months she was terrified that she would never see her daughter again. The few \n25  times Ms. L. was able to speak to her daughter on the phone, her daughter was \n26  crying and scared. \n27  60.  In December, S.S. turned 7 and spent her birthday in the Chicago \n28  facility, without her mother. \n    9  18cv0428 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 250   Filed 10/09/18   PageID.4006   Page 12 of 22\n \n \n \n61.  In detention, Ms. L. was distraught and depressed because of her \n1 \n \n  separation from her daughter. As a result, she did not eat properly, lost weight, and \n2 \n \nwas not sleeping due to worry and nightmares. \n3   \n  62.  In one moment of extreme despair and confusion, Ms. L. told an \n4 \n \nimmigration judge that she wanted to withdraw her application for asylum, \n5   \nrealizing her mistake only a few days later. She is seeking to reopen her case before \n6 \nthe Board of Immigration Appeals. \n7 \n63.  The government had no legitimate interest in separating Ms. L. and her \n8 \nchild. \n9 \n64.  There has been no evidence, or even accusation, that S.S. was abused \n10 \nor neglected by Ms. L. \n11 \n65.  There is no evidence that Ms. L. is an unfit parent or that she is not \n12 \nacting in the best interests of her child. \n13 \n66.  After Ms. L. filed this lawsuit and moved for a preliminary injunction, \n14 \nDefendants abruptly released her from custody on March 6, 2018, due to the filing \n15 \nof the lawsuit. Defendants informed her that she would be released mere hours in \n16 \nadvance, with no arrangements for where she would stay. S.S. was released to Ms. \n17 \n18  L.’s custody several days later. Both are now pursuing their claims for legal \n19  protection. \n20  67.  Ms. C. and her 14 year-old son, J., are another one of the families who \n21  have been separated by the government. Like Ms. L. and her daughter, Ms. C. and \n22  her son are seeking asylum in the United States. \n23  68.  Ms. C. and J. fled Brazil and came to the United States to seek asylum. \n24  A few feet after Ms. C. entered the United States, a border guard approached her, \n25  and she explained that she was seeking asylum. Ms. C. subsequently passed a \n26  credible fear interview, and was put in removal proceedings, where she is applying \n27  for asylum. \n28 \n    10  18cv0428 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 250   Filed 10/09/18   PageID.4007   Page 13 of 22\n \n \n \n69.  Despite having communicated her fear of persecution to border guards, \n1 \n \n  the government prosecuted Ms. C. for entering the country illegally, took her son J. \n2 \n \naway from her, and sent him to a facility for “unaccompanied” children in Chicago. \n3   \n  70.  The government continued to separate Ms. C. from her son even after \n4 \n \nshe completed serving her criminal misdemeanor sentence on September 22, 2017, \n5   \nand was sent to an immigration detention facility, the El Paso Processing Center. In \n6 \nearly January 2018, she was transferred again, to another immigration facility, the \n7 \nWest Texas Detention Facility (also known as Sierra Blanca), but still was not \n8 \nreunited with her son. Even after Ms. C was released from immigration detention \n9 \non April 5, 2018, the government did not reunify her with her son for another two \n10 \nmonths, until June 9. \n11 \n71.  While separated from J., Ms. C. was desperate to be reunited with him. \n12 \nShe worried about him constantly and did not know when she would be able to see \n13 \nhim. They spoke on the phone only a handful of times while they were separated by \n14 \nDefendants. \n15 \n72.  J. had a difficult time emotionally during the months he was separated \n16 \nfrom his mother. \n17 \n18  73.  The government had no legitimate interest for the separation of Ms. C. \n19  and her child. \n20  74.  There is no evidence, or even accusation, that J. was abused or \n21  neglected by Ms. C. \n22  75.  There is no evidence that Ms. C. is an unfit parent or that she is not \n23  acting in the best interests of her child. \n24  76.  Dora fled Honduras with her thirteen-year-old daughter due to \n25  persecution on account of her political opinion. She was separated from her \n26  daughter when she arrived in the United States in May 2018.  It was the first time in \n27  their lives that they had been separated. Dora was unable to obtain information \n28  about her daughter’s whereabouts.  \n    11  18cv0428 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 250   Filed 10/09/18   PageID.4008   Page 14 of 22\n \n \n \n77.  Dora was terrified for her daughter after being separated from her. She \n1 \n \n  became so distraught that she had to be given medication—antidepressants and \n2 \n \nsleeping pills—to treat the depression she suffered as a result of having been \n3   \n  separated from her daughter. The medication did not work and actually made her \n4 \n \nfeel worse. Dora suffered side effects from the medications. \n5   \n78.  Dora received a negative determination in a credible fear interview \n6 \nconducted during the separation.  She has been reunited with her children and is \n7 \ncurrently detained at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. \n8 \n79.  Alma fled Honduras with her two boys, aged seven and nine, because \n9 \nof violence and persecution she and her family members endured. She arrived in the \n10 \nUnited States in June 2018 and was separated from her children. She received no \n11 \ninformation about them for twenty-eight days.  \n12 \n80.  At the time of her credible fear interview, Alma was separated from \n13 \nher children and unable to focus on anything other than that separation. She was \n14 \nlater diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\") because of this \n15 \nseparation, with strong indications that she was suffering from acute, debilitating \n16 \ntrauma at the time of her interview, including alterations in mood and cognition, \n17 \n18  hyperarousal, and dissociation. \n19  81.  Alma received a negative credible fear determination, which was \n20  affirmed by an immigration judge. \n21  82.  Alma was reunited with her children, and was released on an order of \n22  supervision. She is required to check in regularly with ICE and is subject to \n23  deportation at any time. \n24 \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n25  83.  Plaintiffs bring this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26  23(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of all other persons \n27  similarly situated. \n28  84.  Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class: \n    12  18cv0428 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 250   Filed 10/09/18   PageID.4009   Page 15 of 22\n \n \n \nAll adult parents who enter the United States at or between designated ports \n1 \n \nof entry who (1) have been, are, or will be detained in immigration custody \n \n2  by the DHS, and (2) have a minor child who is or will be separated from \n \nthem by DHS and detained in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or DHS \n3   \ncustody, absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger \n \n4 \nto the child. \n \n5   \n85.  Ms. L., Ms. C., Dora, and Alma are each adequate representatives of \n6 \nthe proposed class. \n7 \n86.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because \n8 \nthe class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. There are at a \n9 \nminimum hundreds of parents who fit within the class. \n10 \n87.  The class meets the commonality requirements of Federal Rule of \n11 \nCivil Procedure 23(a)(2). The members of the class are subject to a common \n12 \npractice: forcibly separating detained parents from their minor children absent any \n13 \ndetermination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child. By definition, \n14 \nall class members have experienced that practice, and none has been given an \n15 \nadequate hearing regarding the separation. The lawsuit raises numerous questions \n16 \nof law common to members of the proposed class, including: whether Defendants’ \n17 \nfamily separation practice violates class members’ substantive due process right to \n18 \nfamily integrity; whether the practice violates class members’ procedural due \n19 \nprocess rights; whether the practice violates the federal asylum statute; and whether \n20 \nthese separations are unlawful or arbitrary and capricious under the APA. \n21 \n88.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Federal Rule \n22 \nof Civil Procedure 23(a)(3), because the claims of the representative Plaintiffs are \n23 \ntypical of the claims of the class. Ms. L., Ms. C., Dora, and Alma, and the proposed \n24 \nclass members are all individuals who have had or will have their children forcibly \n25 \ntaken away from them despite there being no proven allegations of abuse, neglect, \n26 \nor any other danger or unfitness. Plaintiffs and the proposed class also share the \n27 \nsame legal claims, which assert the same substantive and procedural rights under \n28 \nthe Due Process Clause, the asylum statute, and the APA. \n    13  18cv0428 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 250   Filed 10/09/18   PageID.4010   Page 16 of 22\n \n \n \n89.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Federal Rule \n1 \n \n  of Civil Procedure 23(a)(4). The representative Plaintiffs seek the same relief as the \n2 \n \nother members of the class—namely, an order that they be reunified with their \n3   \n  children, whether through release or in family detention facilities. In defending their \n4 \n \nown rights, Ms. L., Ms. C., Dora, and Alma will defend the rights of all proposed \n5   \nclass members fairly and adequately. \n6 \n90.  The proposed class is represented by counsel from the American Civil \n7 \nLiberties Union Immigrants’ Rights Project and the ACLU of San Diego and \n8 \nImperial Counties. Counsel have extensive experience litigating class action \n9 \nlawsuits and other complex cases in federal court, including civil rights lawsuits on \n10 \nbehalf of noncitizens. \n11 \n91.  The members of the class are readily ascertainable through \n12 \nDefendants’ records. \n13 \n92.  The proposed class also satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n14 \n23(b)(2). Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class by \n15 \nunlawfully separating parents from their young children. Injunctive and declaratory \n16 \nrelief is thus appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n17 \n18  CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \n19 \n(Violation of Due Process: Right to Family Integrity) \n20  93.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n21  fully set forth herein. \n22  94.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to all \n23  “persons” on United States soil and thus applies to Ms. L., Ms. C., their children \n24  S.S. and J., and all proposed class members. \n25  95.  Plaintiffs, their children, and all class members have liberty interests \n26  under the Due Process Clause in remaining together as families. \n27 \n28 \n    14  18cv0428 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 250   Filed 10/09/18   PageID.4011   Page 17 of 22\n \n \n \n96.  The separation of the class members from their children violates \n1 \n \n  substantive due process because it furthers no legitimate purpose and was designed \n2 \n \nto deter. \n3   \n  97.  The separation of the class members from their children also violates \n4 \n \nprocedural due process because it was undertaken without any hearing. \n5   \n6  COUNT II \n(Administrative Procedure Act: Arbitrary and Capricious Practice) \n7 \n98.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n8 \nfully set forth herein. \n9 \n99.  The APA prohibits agency action that is arbitrary and capricious or \n10 \nviolates a person’s legal or constitutional rights. \n11 \n100.  Defendants’ separation practice is final agency action for which there \n12 \nis no other adequate remedy in a court. Defendants’ decision to separate parents is \n13 \nnot tentative or interlocutory, because Defendants have already separated thousands \n14 \nof families and continue to do so, and the policy was announced by high-level \n15 \nofficials. And Defendants’ decision to separate gravely impacts class members’ \n16 \nrights to remain together as families. \n17 \n101.  Defendants’ separation of Ms. L., Ms. C., and the other class members \n18 \n19  from their children without any explanation or legitimate justification is arbitrary \n20  and capricious and accordingly violates the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n21  102.  Among other things, Defendants failed to offer adequate reasons for \n22  adopting their unprecedented new separation practice; they failed to explain why \n23  they were not using alternatives to separation, including supervised release and \n24  family detention; and for parents like Ms. L., Defendants have never explained why \n25  they cannot verify parentage before imposing traumatic separation on both parent \n26  and child. \n27   \n28   \n    15  18cv0428 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 250   Filed 10/09/18   PageID.4012   Page 18 of 22\n \n \n \nCOUNT III \n1 \n \n(Violation of Right to Seek Protection Under the Asylum and Withholding of \n \n2  Removal Statutes, and the Convention Against Torture) \n \n103.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n3   \n  fully set forth herein. \n4 \n \n104.  Under United States law, noncitizens with a well-founded fear of \n5   \npersecution shall have the opportunity to apply for asylum in the United States. 8 \n6 \nU.S.C. § 1158(a). In addition, noncitizens have a mandatory statutory entitlement to \n7 \nwithholding of removal where they would face a probability of persecution if \n8 \nremoved to their country of nationality, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), or withholding or \n9 \ndeferral of removal where they would face a probability of torture. Foreign Affairs \n10 \nReform and Restructuring Act (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. 105-277, Div. G., Title \n11 \nXXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681-822 (Oct. 21, 1998) (codified as Note to 8 U.S.C.§ \n12 \n1231). \n13 \n105.  Class members have a private right of action to challenge violations of \n14 \ntheir right to apply for asylum under § 1158(a). That right is not barred by 8 U.S.C. \n15 \n§ 1158(d)(7), which applies to only certain procedural requirements set out in \n16 \nSection 1158(d). \n17 \n18  106.  Defendants’ separation of families violates federal law that provides \n19  for asylum and other protection from removal, as well as their due process right to \n20  seek such relief. Separation severely impedes their ability to pursue their asylum \n21  and other protection claims in a number of ways, including by denying them the \n22  ability to coordinate their applications with their children, present facts related to \n23  themselves and their children, and creating trauma that hinders their ability to \n24  navigate the complex process. This is in violation of due process and other federal \n25  law, including the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. and Immigration and \n26  Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101.  \n27  107.  The government is also using the trauma of separation to coerce \n28  parents into giving up their asylum and protection claims in order to be reunited \n    16  18cv0428 \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 250   Filed 10/09/18   PageID.4013   Page 19 of 22\n \n \n \nwith their children. \n1 \n \n   \n2 \n \n3    PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  Plaintiffs request that the Court enter a judgment against Defendants and \n4 \n \naward the following relief: \n5   \nA.  Certify a class of all adult parents nationwide who enter the United \n6 \nStates at or between designated ports of entry who (1) have been, are, or will be \n7 \ndetained in immigration custody by the DHS, and (2) have a minor child who is or \n8 \nwill be separated from them by DHS and detained in ORR custody, ORR foster \n9 \ncare, or DHS custody, absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a \n10 \ndanger to the child. \n11 \nB.  Name Ms. L., and Ms. C., Dora, and Alma as representatives of the \n12 \nclass, and appoint Plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel; \n13 \nC.  Declare the separation of Ms. L., Ms. C., Dora, and Alma, and the \n14 \nother class members from their children unlawful; \n15 \nD.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from continuing to \n16 \nseparate the class members from their children; \n17 \nE.

DEFENDANTS’ POSITIONS \n17 \nA. Update on Reunification Process \n18 \nThe reunification plan outlined to the Court in Defendants’ filing on July \n19 \n20  15, 2018, ECF No. 109, and discussed at the July 16, 2018 status conference, is \n21 \nproceeding. Defendants report the following with regard to the reunification of \n22 \nfamilies with children ages 5-17:1 \n23 \n24                                                   \n1 The numbers provided are based on unofficial, daily reports that have not been \n25 \nanalyzed in the same manner as official statistics. Official statistics require at \n26  least 48 hours of analysis and verification.  As such, providing official statistics \ntoday would reflect data as of July 16, 2018. The daily reports are based on data \n27 \n28 \n \n \n  1  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 124   Filed 07/19/18   PageID.2338   Page 3 of 9\n \n•  Total number of possible children of potential class members \n1 \nidentified: 2551 \n2   \n•  Potential class members possibly eligible for reunification: 1606 \n3 \n  Class members interviewed and cleared for reunification: 848 \no\n4 \n  Potential class members pending interview: 272 \no\n  Potential class members released to the interior by ICE: 222  \n5  o\n  Potential class members in ICE custody pending ORR review \no\n6 \nof adult and child files: 264 \n \n7 \n•  Potential class members, or non-members of the class, either not \n8 \neligible, or not yet known to be eligible, for reunification: 908 \n  Adults known to be in U.S. Marshal, State or local custody: 2 \n9  o\n  At interview, parent waived reunification: 136 \no\n10 \n  Adults with prohibitive criminal record or deemed ineligible by \no\nICE: 91 \n11 \n  Further evaluation: 679 \no\n12 \n \n13  •  Class members with a final order of removal: 719 \n \n14 \n•  Total number of reunifications: 364 \n15   \nB. Notice \n16 \n17  The Government is providing the “cleared” list to Plaintiffs on a daily basis \n18 \nwhen it is updated. This provides normally provides 12-hours’ notice or more \n19 \nthat a class member may be reunified. \n20 \n21  Moreover, at the time of reunification, families are released to the office of a \n22 \nlocal NGO, who assists the family with post-release services as needed. These \n23 \n24 \n                                                 \n25  as of 11:59 PM the night before reporting.  In the interest of providing \ninformation that is as up-to-date as possible, although not verified, the unofficial \n26 \nnumbers are provided.  As such, the numbers provided in Section A reflect the \n27  unofficial numbers as of 11:59 PM on July 18, 2018.   \n28 \n \n \n  2  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 124   Filed 07/19/18   PageID.2339   Page 4 of 9\n \nNGOs are available to assist released families 24-hours a day. ICE provides notice \n1 \n2  to the NGOs of the families being released at least 1 hour in advance of any release.  \n3 \nC. Class Member Lists and Other Information For Plaintiffs  \n4   \nOn July 13, 2016, Defendants provided Plaintiffs’ counsel with a list of \n5 \n6  identified class members in ICE custody, as well as a list of identified children of \n7 \nclass members. Those lists contained names, A#s, and locations for all individuals, \n8 \nas well as the ages of the children. \n9 \n10  On or before July 20, 2018, Defendants plan to provide Plaintiffs with a list \n11 \nof class members who have been removed, including the date of removal, country \n12 \nof removal, and last detention location. On or before July 23, 2018, Defendants \n13 \n14  plan to provide Plaintiffs with a list of class members who have been released from \n15 \nICE custody. Defendants are still attempting to determine whether they can \n16 \nprovide Plaintiffs with a list of class members who are in criminal custody.  The \n17 \n18 \ninformation requested is not in ICE’s or HHS’s control, and is not maintained in \n19 \nsuch a way that it can be pulled automatically from the respective systems.  \n20 \nOn July 18, 2018, Plaintiffs sent to Defendants an email requesting \n21 \n22 \nadditional information, including clarifications regarding the information that \n23 \nDefendants have already provided to Plaintiffs. Defendants have asked Plaintiffs to \n24 \nprioritize their requests to that Defendants can best get them the information that \n25 \n26 \nthey need. In the meantime, Defendants are in the process of determining if they \n27 \n28 \n \n \n  3  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 124   Filed 07/19/18   PageID.2340   Page 5 of 9\n \nare able to provide the requested information and will do so, or will meet and \n1 \n2  confer with Plaintiffs regarding their requests for additional information.  \n3 \nII.  PLAINTIFFS’ POSITIONS \n4 \nA.  Children Age 5-17 \n5 \n6    Despite multiple requests, Plaintiffs’ counsel still has not received critical \n7 \ninformation from Defendants.  Plaintiffs need this information to locate Class \n8 \nMembers who have been deported or released from ICE custody, to ensure \n9 \n10  compliance with the Court’s deadlines, and to arrange for appropriate legal and \n11 \nother services for Class Members and their children.  As of this filing, for the Class \n12 \nMembers with children age 5-17, Defendants have not provided the following \n13 \n14  information: \n15 \n•  A list of Class Members who have been released from ICE custody. \n16 \n17  •  A list of Class Members who have been deported. \n18 \n•  A list of parents with final removal orders, who need to be counseled on \n19  their options and their children’s options immediately. \n20 \nThis information is especially critical for parents with removal orders.  These \n21 \nparents may only have a matter of days to make the momentous decision whether \n22 \n23 \nto leave their child behind in the United States.  Plaintiffs have accordingly made \n24 \nurgent requests to Defendants for these parents’ information. \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n \n  4  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 124   Filed 07/19/18   PageID.2341   Page 6 of 9\n \nDefendants have also not provided any plan for reuniting the parents who \n1 \n2  have been released from ICE custody.  The July 14 list of children stated that \n3 \nhundreds of parents have been released from custody.  But Plaintiffs do not know \n4 \nwhere and when any of these families will be reunited. \n5 \n6  B.  Children Under 5 \n7 \nFor Class Members with children younger than 5, Defendants have not \n8 \nprovided any of the clarifications necessary for Plaintiffs to ensure that parents \n9 \n10  were not improperly excluded from the class.  Defendants have so far not provided \n11 \nthe following: \n12 \n•  Details about the nature of the charge, conviction, or warrant for each \n13 \nparent who was excluded from the class based on criminal history or \n14 \nalleged abuse or neglect. \n15 \n•  Details about the reasons why each putative Class Member was excluded \n16 \nfor not being a parent. \n17 \nC.  Deadlines \n18 \n19  To ensure that reunification occurs on time for all Class Members, Plaintiffs \n20 \nrespectfully request that the Court order the following deadlines: \n21 \n1.  By July 20 at 5:00pm PST, Defendants must provide a list of Class \n22 \n23  Members in ICE custody who have final removal orders.  The list must indicate \n24 \nwhether the parent signed any election form to be removed with or without the \n25 \nchild.  For parents who elected to be removed with the child, the list must state the \n26 \n27  location where the family will be reunited. \n28 \n \n \n  5  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 124   Filed 07/19/18   PageID.2342   Page 7 of 9\n \n2.  By July 20, Defendants must provide an updated list of parents who \n1 \n2  have been “precleared” for reunification. \n3 \n3.  By July 21, Defendants must provide a list of Class Members who \n4 \nhave been deported or released from DHS custody into the interior. \n5 \n6  4.  Defendants must immediately file a plan for reuniting children with \n7 \nthe Class Members who have been released from ICE custody.  This plan should \n8 \nprovide the same level of detail as Defendants’ July 15 plan for reuniting parents \n9 \n10  who are in ICE custody. \n11 \n5.  By July 23, Defendants must provide a list of families with children \n12 \nage 5-17 who have already been reunified.  The list must indicate whether the \n13 \n14  family was deported after being reunified. \n15 \n6.  By July 23, Defendants must provide detailed and specific \n16 \ninformation as to why each putative Class Member with children under 5 was \n17 \n18 \nexcluded based on criminal history, allegations of abuse or neglect, or parentage, \n19 \ngiven the age of these children.  This information must be sufficiently detailed to \n20 \nallow Plaintiffs to dispute or challenge the reasons for excluding the parent from \n21 \n22 \nthe class. \n23 \n   \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n \n  6  18cv428 DMS MDD \n \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 124   Filed 07/19/18   PageID.2343   Page 8 of 9\n \n1  DATED: July 19, 2018      Respectfully submitted, \n \n2 \n           /s/ Lee Gelernt      \n           Lee Gelernt* \n3 \nJudy Rabinovitz* \n4 \nAnand Balakrishnan* \nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION \n5 \nFOUNDATION \n6 \n125 Broad St., 18th Floor \n7  New York, NY 10004 \nT:  (212) 549-2660 \n8 \nF:  (212) 549-2654 \n9  lgelernt@aclu.org \njrabinovitz@aclu.org \n10 \nabalakrishnan@aclu.org  \n11   \nBardis Vakili (SBN 247783) \n12 \nACLU FOUNDATION OF SAN DIEGO \n13  & IMPERIAL COUNTIES \nP.O.

That  injunction  was  directed  at  the  Trump  Administration’s  practice  of \n20  separating migrant parents and their minor children when they crossed the United States-\n21  Mexico border and its failure to reunify those families in accordance with the United States \n22  Constitution.  The Administration’s practice of separating these families was formally \n23  abandoned on June 20, 2018, when the President of the United States issued Executive \n24  Order No. 13841, which reestablished a policy to “maintain family unity,” and directed \n25  that alien families be detained together “during the pendency of any criminal improper \n26  entry or immigration proceedings involving their members.”  However, the Executive \n27  Order did not provide any guidance on reunifying families, and did not provide any \n28  guidance on future family separations, other than stating that parents and children would \n1 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9058   Page 2 of 26\n \n1  not be detained together if Defendants had “concerns” that the parent posed “a risk to the \n2  child’s welfare.”   \n3  This  Court’s  injunction  addressed  those  two  issues.    Specifically,  it  required \n4  Defendants  to  reunify  within  thirty  days  parents  and  minor  children  who  had  been \n5  separated under the Administration’s practices, and prohibited Defendants from separating \n6  migrant parents and their minor children in the future absent a determination that the parent \n7  was  unfit  or  presented  a  danger  to  his  or  her  child  or  had  a  criminal  history  or \n8  communicable disease.   \n9  The day after this Court issued its preliminary injunction and accompanying order \n10  granting class certification, Defendants implemented new guidelines and procedures in an \n11  attempt to comply with those orders.  Nevertheless, in the year following issuance of the \n12  preliminary injunction, Defendants have separated nearly 1,000 migrant families at the \n13  border.    Given  these  numbers,  Plaintiffs  fear  the  Administration  has  returned  to \n14  “systematic” separation of families, prompting the present motion.  It is undisputed that \n15  prior  Administrations  separated  families  at  the  border  based  on  fraudulent  claims  of \n16  parentage, or evidence of child trafficking or other dangers to the child or community.  \n17  Defendants argue their practices now are no different from prior Administrations.  They \n18  point out that the number of separations at issue represents a small fraction of the number \n19  of individuals entering the border at the time in question, some 524,294 parents and \n20  children, and reflects careful exercise of discretion consistent with the Court’s orders.   \n21  Considering  the  Administration’s  return  to  family  unity,  Defendants’ \n22  implementation of guidelines immediately following the Court’s preliminary injunction, \n23  Defendants’ authority to secure the Nation’s borders, and the scope of the class and need \n24  to avoid individualized determinations, the Court finds Defendants are generally exercising \n25  their discretion to separate families at the border consistent with Plaintiffs’ rights to family \n26  integrity and the Court’s orders, with one exception regarding DNA testing and one \n27  clarification regarding separations based on family residential center standards. \n28  / / / \n2 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9059   Page 3 of 26\n \n1  I. \n2  BACKGROUND \n3  In July of 2017, the Trump Administration embarked on an unprecedented policy of \n4  separating migrant families at the border to deter immigration.  The policy started quietly \n5  and was implemented by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) through Customs \n6  and Border Protection (“CBP”) officials at border facilities in Texas.  See Department of \n7  Homeland Security, Office of the Inspector General, DHS Lacked Technology Needed to \n8  Successfully Account for Separated Migrant Families, Rep. No. OIG-20-06 (Nov. 2019) \n9  (“OIG DHS Report (11/25/19)”), at 5 (stating DHS began a “prosecution initiative … in \n10  the El Paso Sector to deter illegal border crossings by increasing prosecutions, which \n11  resulted in an increase in family separations.”).  Eventually, the policy would be made \n12  public on May 7, 2018, when the Attorney General of the United States announced the \n13  Administration’s “zero tolerance policy,” in which all migrant parents entering illegally \n14  between ports of entry with their minor children would be criminally prosecuted and \n15  separated  from  their  children.    In  practice,  the  policy  resulted  in  the  indiscriminate \n16  separation of thousands of migrant parents and children, most of whom were seeking \n17  asylum from countries in Central America and many of whom entered the United States \n18  lawfully  at  designated ports  of  entry.    In  addition, parents who  were  prosecuted  for \n19  unlawful entry for entering between ports of entry were not reunified with their children \n20  after serving brief criminal sentences because DHS did not have adequate systems in place \n21  to keep track of the children, let alone any plan to reunify the families.  As a result, migrant \n22  parents remained separated from their children for months while the parents pursued their \n23  asylum claims and other relief from removal.  Many of the parents were deported back to \n24  Central America without their children after exhausting their challenges to removal.   \n25  In response to this situation, Plaintiffs filed the present case seeking to enjoin family \n26  separations on constitutional and statutory grounds.  The focus of Plaintiffs’ Complaint \n27  was not the zero tolerance policy, but rather a broader family separation practice that was \n28  being applied to families crossing into the United States both legally at designated ports of \n3 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9060   Page 4 of 26\n \n1  entry and illegally between ports of entry.  In response to the Complaint, Defendants filed \n2  a motion to dismiss, which the Court denied.  In the June 6, 2018 order on that motion, the \n3  Court  found Plaintiffs had stated a legally cognizable claim  that this broader  family \n4  separation practice violated the right to family integrity and association under the Due \n5  Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The Court also \n6  found Plaintiffs’ allegations that Defendants’ practice of separating parents for prosecution \n7  for improper entry (zero tolerance) and failing to reunify those families after the parent \n8  completed his or her sentence without a determination the parent was unfit or presented a \n9  danger to the child stated a claim for violation of the right to family integrity. \n10  Thereafter, on June 20, 2018, the President of the United States abandoned the zero \n11  tolerance policy in favor of a “policy of th[e] Administration to maintain family unity” by \n12  way of the Executive Order, see Exec. Order No. 13841, 83 Fed. Reg. 29435 (June 20, \n13  2018), but did not address reunification or set out specific standards for separating family \n14  units  in  the  future.1    This  Court  then  issued  its  order  on  class  certification  and  the \n15  preliminary injunction on June 26, 2018.  Pursuant to those orders, the Court certified a \n16  class that included adult parents who entered the United States at or between ports of entry \n17  who were detained in immigration custody and had a minor child who was separated from \n18  them and placed in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), \n19  Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”).  Specifically, the Court certified the following \n20  class (“Ms. L. class”) on Plaintiffs’ due process claim arising out of the Administration’s \n21  family separation practices:   \n22  All adult parents who enter the United States at or between designated ports \nof entry who (1) have been, are, or will be detained in immigration custody \n23 \nby the DHS, and (2) have a minor child who is or will be separated from them \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n1  Prior Administrations attempted to maintain family unity at the border.  See CBP, \n26 \nNational Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (“TEDS”), October 2015, \n27  at § 1.9 Family Unity (stating “CBP will maintain family unity to the greatest extent \noperationally  feasible,  absent  a  legal  requirement  or  an  articulable  safety  or  security \n28 \nconcern that requires separation.”) \n4 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9061   Page 5 of 26\n \n1  by DHS and detained in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody, \nabsent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child. \n2 \n \n3  (ECF No. 82 at 17.)  The Court excluded from the class “parents with criminal history or \n4  communicable disease, or those who are in the interior of the United States or subject to” \n5  the Executive Order.  (Id.)  The preliminary injunction ordered the reunification of class \n6  members with their children and prohibited Defendants from separating parents from their \n7  minor children at the border “absent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a \n8  danger to the child.”  (ECF No. 83 at 22-23.)2 \n9    The day after the Court issued its injunction, Defendants distributed a Memorandum \n10  to CBP employees providing “initial direction on compliance with” the Court’s orders.  \n11  (Opp’n to Mot., Ex. 4 (Memorandum from Kevin K. McAleenan, Commissioner, U.S. \n12  Customs and Border Protection, to Carla L. Prevost, Chief, U.S. Border Patrol, and Todd \n13  C.  Owen,  Exec.  Asst.  Commissioner,  Office  of  Field  Operations  (June  27,  2018)) \n14  (“Memorandum” or “CBP Interim Guidance Memorandum”).  The Memorandum directs \n15  that parents “who enter the United States illegally as part of a family unit … should not be \n16  referred for prosecution for [improper entry under] 8 U.S.C. § 1325.”  (Id.)  In addition, it \n17  states that a parent should not be separated from his or her minor child unless he or she has \n18  a criminal conviction for “violent misdemeanors or felonies[,]” presents a danger to the \n19  child, has a communicable disease, or presents a fraudulent claim of parental relationship.  \n20  (Id.)  The Memorandum emphasizes that “any questions about what constitutes a violent \n21  misdemeanor or felony should be referred to the local Office of Chief Counsel[,]” and that \n22  / / / \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25  2 At the time the preliminary injunction issued on June 26, 2018, 2,814 children had been \nseparated from their parents (“Ms. L. class members”) and were then in the custody of ORR \n26 \nin facilities throughout the country.  Through the parties’ reunification efforts, every one \n27  of these families was accounted for and nearly every child was reunified with a parent \neither in the United States or in their country of origin or placed with a sponsor in the \n28 \nUnited States to pursue asylum, in accordance with law and the parents’ wishes.   \n5 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9062   Page 6 of 26\n \n1  “any questions about how to comply with the court order should be raised through the \n2  appropriate chain of command for contact with local Office of Chief Counsel.”  (Id.) \n3  In November 2018, after the majority of class members had been reunited with their \n4  children,  Plaintiffs  notified  the  Court  that  Defendants  were  interpreting  the  class \n5  certification order to include only those parents whose children were in ORR custody on \n6  or after June 26, 2018.  Given Plaintiffs’ allegations that the family separation practice had \n7  been in effect well before the announcement of the zero tolerance policy, Plaintiffs filed a \n8  motion to clarify that the class include parents who had been separated from their children \n9  prior to June 26, 2018, and whose children had been released from ORR custody prior to \n10  that date.  While that motion was pending, the Office of Inspector General for HHS \n11  confirmed that Defendants began separating families in July of 2017, and that potentially \n12  thousands  of  additional  children  may  have  been  through  ORR  custody  before  the \n13  preliminary injunction issued.  See Department of HHS, Office of the Inspector General, \n14  Separated Children Placed in Office of Refugee Resettlement Care, HHS OIG Issue Brief \n15  No.  OEI-BL-18-0051  (Jan.  2019).    After  that  report  was  issued,  the  Court  granted \n16  Plaintiffs’ motion to modify the class definition to include those parents who had been \n17  separated from their children at the border beginning on July 1, 2017, and whose children \n18  were released from ORR custody prior to June 26, 2018.  As with the original class, the \n19  expanded class is subject to the same exclusions for criminal history and communicable \n20  disease.3 \n21  / / / \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n3 After  the  Court  modified  the  class  definition,  it  ordered  Defendants  to  conduct  an \n24 \naccounting of possible children of members of the expanded Ms. L. class.  That accounting \n25  was completed on October 25, 2019, and revealed an additional 1,556 separated children.  \nIt appears the majority of parents in the expanded class were deported to Central America \n26 \nwithout their children.  Finding them will involve the same painstaking process that was \n27  used to locate the 471 parents who were removed without their children in the original class \nof 2,814 parents.  The reunification effort is presently underway and is being monitored by \n28 \nthe Court through monthly status conferences with the parties.   \n6 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9063   Page 7 of 26\n \n1  Consistent with the Court’s class certification orders and preliminary injunction, \n2  Defendants have continued to separate parents and children crossing the border when there \n3  are concerns about parentage, the parent has a criminal history or communicable disease \n4  (or long-term medical need), or the parent is unfit or presents a danger to his or her child \n5  or  others.    During  the  initial  reunification  process  of  approximately  2,814  families, \n6  Plaintiffs reported Defendants had excluded only twenty-nine parents from the class based \n7  on the factors identified in the Court’s orders.  Plaintiffs assert the number of parents who \n8  have since been excluded from the class in the year following issuance of the preliminary \n9  injunction stands at approximately 1,000.4   \n10  Given the number of family separations and the expectation that more parents will \n11  be excluded from the class in the future, Plaintiffs filed the present motion to enforce the \n12  Court’s preliminary injunction.  The Court heard argument on the motion on September \n13  20, 2019.  In response to the Court’s invitation during oral argument, counsel in MMM v. \n14  Sessions, Case No. 18cv1832, and Dora v. Sessions, Case No. 18cv1938, who represent \n15  the settlement class of children of Ms. L. class members, filed a supplemental letter brief \n16  to address whether parents convicted of illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. § 1326 are entitled \n17  to class membership.  Defendants filed a response to that brief on October 16, 2019.  During \n18  a subsequent status conference, Plaintiffs requested an opportunity to file a supplemental \n19  brief directed to Defendants’ then-recently produced separation protocols and practices set \n20  out in the CBP Interim Guidance Memorandum and other documents, which the Court \n21  granted.  The Court also gave Defendants an opportunity to file a supplemental response \n22  / / / \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25  4  When the present motion was filed on July 30, 2019, the number of exclusions was 911:  \n678 based on allegations of criminal conduct, seventy-one (71) based on gang affiliation, \n26 \ntwenty (20) based on lack of fitness or child safety concerns, forty-six (46) based on \n27  “unverified familial relationships,” and twenty-four (24) based on illness.  (Mot. at 7.)  In \nthe  reply  brief,  filed  on  September  18,  2019,  Plaintiffs  assert  the  number  was  then \n28 \n“approximately 1,000[.]”  (Reply at 1.)   \n7 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9064   Page 8 of 26\n \n1  to Plaintiffs’ brief, which Defendants did on October 31, 2019.  The motion has been fully \n2  briefed and argued and is now granted in part and denied in part as discussed below. \n3  II. \n4  DISCUSSION \n5  Read together, the orders on class certification and preliminary injunction set out \n6  five criteria to be considered by DHS before an adult may be separated from his or her \n7  child at the border: lack of parentage or fitness, criminal history, communicable disease, \n8  and danger to the child.5  Plaintiffs argue Defendants’ application of these factors is \n9  resulting in exclusion from the Ms. L. class and continued, unconstitutional separations of \n10  parents  from  their  minor  children.    Plaintiffs  also  assert  Defendants’  standards  for \n11  placement in family residential centers (“FRCs”) are causing unconstitutional separations \n12  of fit parents who pose no danger to their children.   \n13  Before turning to the five factors identified above, the Court first clarifies the \n14  standard for separating parents and children at the border, as that standard informs the \n15  remaining discussion.  Since the beginning of this case, Plaintiffs have argued the right to \n16  family integrity is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Constitution, and the \n17  government may not separate a parent from his or her child absent a showing the parent is \n18  unfit or presents a danger to the child.  The first of these arguments is not disputed.  As \n19  stated in the Court’s order denying Defendants’ motion to dismiss, “it has long been settled \n20  that the liberty interest identified in the Fifth Amendment provides a right to family \n21  integrity or to familial association.”  (ECF No. 71 at 14.)  What is disputed is whether, and \n22  to what extent, that right applies to the facts presented here, namely, to immigrant families \n23  taken into government custody while crossing the United States-Mexico border.   \n24 \n25                                                  \n26 \n5  The preliminary injunction prohibits separation absent a finding the parent is unfit or \n27  presents a danger to the child, while the class certification orders limit application of the \npreliminary injunction to certain individuals: adult parents at the border who do not have a \n28 \ncriminal history or communicable disease. \n8 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9065   Page 9 of 26\n \n1  In the order on Defendants’ motion to dismiss, the Court found Plaintiffs had alleged \n2  sufficient facts to state a due process claim under the circumstances of this case, and further \n3  found the standard applicable to this claim was whether the government conduct at issue, \n4  namely the separation of parents and children at the border based on a nationwide policy \n5  or practice to deter illegal immigration, “shocks the conscience.”6  In the present motion, \n6  Plaintiffs urge the Court, as they have done throughout this case, to adopt a different \n7  standard, namely, that the separation of a parent from his or her minor child violates due \n8  process absent a showing the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.  In support, \n9  Plaintiffs cite Quilloin v. Wolcott, 434 U.S. 246, 255 (1978) (quoting Smith v. Organization \n10  of Foster Families, 431 U.S. 816, 862-863 (1977)), which states “the Due Process Clause \n11  would be offended ‘[i]f a State were to attempt to force the breakup of a natural family … \n12  without some showing of unfitness[.]’”  See also Brokaw v. Mercer County, 235 F.3d 1000, \n13  1019 (7th Cir. 2000) (citing Croft v. Westmoreland County Children and Youth Services, \n14  103 F.3d 1123, 1126 (3d Cir. 1997) (“courts have recognized that a state has no interest in \n15  protecting children from their parents unless it has some definite and articulable evidence \n16  giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that a child has been abused or is in imminent danger \n17  of abuse.”).  In other words, Plaintiffs argue these two factors, fitness and danger, are the \n18  only valid government interests justifying the separation of a parent from his or her child.   \n19  However, this approach ignores that “the jurisprudence of substantive due process \n20  is an exercise that is ‘highly dependent on context and detail.’”  Aguilar v. U.S. Immigration \n21  and Customs Enforcements Div. of Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 510 F.3d 1, 22 (1st Cir. 2007) \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n6  The Court also found the “shocks the conscious” standard applied to Defendants’ practice \n24 \nof separating parents for prosecution for improper entry and failing to reunify those \n25  families after the parent completed his or her  criminal sentence and was returned to \nimmigration detention.  In that context, the initial separation of the parent for prosecution \n26 \nis lawful but the continued separation after completion of the criminal sentence is not \n27  unless the parent is determined to be unfit or a danger to the child.  The present motion \nfocuses on the initial separation of parents from their children at the border for reasons \n28 \nunrelated to prosecution for improper entry. \n9 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9066   Page 10 of 26\n \n1  (quoting DePoutot v. Raffaelly, 424 F.3d 112, 119 (1st Cir. 2005)).  Here, the context is an \n2  international  border  between  the  United  States  and  Mexico,  which  hundreds,  if  not \n3  thousands, of people cross every day.  In this context, the government interests go well \n4  beyond just the fitness and danger that a parent may present to his or her own child.  Rather, \n5  the  government  interests  extend  to  securing  the  Nation’s  borders  and  enforcing  the \n6  Nation’s criminal and immigration laws, and all that those interests entail, including \n7  detention and parole determinations for migrants taken into custody.   \n8  Plaintiffs’ approach, by contrast, is based on the context of state child welfare \n9  investigations.  (See Reply at 1) (asking Court to “reiterate that the standard for separating \n10  a child is the traditional due process standard used in the child welfare context:  whether \n11  there is objective evidence to believe that the parent is genuinely unfit or a danger to her \n12  child.”)  In that context, child protective service agencies are typically responding to \n13  concerns for an individual child’s welfare and are tasked with determining whether an \n14  individual parent or guardian is unfit or presents such a danger to their child that the child \n15  should be removed from the parent’s custody.  There, the state’s primary concern is the \n16  best interests of the child.  There are no national security concerns or concerns about \n17  immigration or criminal law enforcement, and no concerns about detaining or paroling into \n18  the community families and children without lawful status in the United States.   \n19  The unique circumstances of this case, namely the intersection of national security \n20  at the border and the fundamental right to family integrity, do not lend themselves to \n21  Plaintiffs’ approach.  Rather, other factors besides fitness and danger must be taken into \n22  consideration when deciding whether to separate parents and children in the context of this \n23  case.  This Court has determined those factors include parentage, criminal history and \n24  communicable disease, in addition to fitness and danger.   \n25  With these principles in mind, the Court considers whether Defendants’ application \n26  of these factors is consistent with this Court’s orders.  Plaintiffs argue Defendants are \n27  separating parents from their children for unjustified reasons, including dubious concerns \n28  about parentage, arbitrary determinations regarding parents with emergency medical needs \n10 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9067   Page 11 of 26\n \n1  or treatable illness, minor crimes and questionable allegations of gang affiliation, dubious \n2  fitness and danger determinations, and overbroad use of family detention standards as a \n3  justification to separate families.  Defendants respond that their application of the factors \n4  has  been  consistent  with  the  Court’s  orders,  and  that  further  Court  intervention  is \n5  unnecessary and unwarranted.  Each of these arguments is discussed below.   \n6  A.  Parentage \n7  The first factor, of course, is parentage, and here, Plaintiffs state Defendants have \n8  separated forty-six (46) parents based on “unverified familial relationship[s].”  (Mot. at 7.)  \n9  Specifically, Plaintiffs identify two cases in which parents were separated from their \n10  children for this reason, only to be reunified after a DNA test confirmed parentage.  While \n11  these cases are relatively few, they raise two significant issues.  The first is whether \n12  Defendants are required to use DNA testing before separating a parent and child based on \n13  doubts about parentage.  The second concerns the burden of proof.   \n14  On the first issue, Defendants explain that DHS has implemented a pilot program \n15  using Rapid DNA technology, which can determine parentage in approximately ninety \n16  minutes.  (Opp’n to Mot. at 11.)  This program has been implemented in seven locations \n17  along the border, but Defendants state “operational concerns” have prevented a wholesale \n18  adoption of this program across the entire border.  (Id.)  It is unclear exactly what these \n19  “operational concerns” are, especially when it appears Defendants are preparing for DNA \n20  testing of immigrants being held in detention centers across the country.  See Daniella \n21  Silva, Trump admin to broadly expand DNA collection of migrants in custody, NBC News \n22  (October  2,  2019,  12:51  PM),  https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-admin-\n23  broadly-expand-dna-collection-migrants-custody-n1061471.  Nevertheless, if testing is not \n24  available at a particular facility, Defendants can transfer the family to a facility where that \n25  testing is available, or take swabs from the parent and child and send the swabs for testing, \n26  as they did with Ms. L. and her daughter.  Given the right at issue here, the harm that \n27  parents and children suffer when they are separated, and the undisputed speed, accuracy \n28  and availability of DNA testing, the Court finds Defendants must conduct DNA testing \n11 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9068   Page 12 of 26\n \n1  before separating an adult from a child based on parentage concerns.  Such testing, in \n2  service to the fundamental right at issue, is clearly warranted.  It is also an efficient and \n3  definitive way to resolve any concerns about fraudulent documentation.  (See Opp’n to \n4  Mot., Ex. 2 (Decl. of Lloyd Easterling, Div. Chief, U.S. Border Patrol, RGV Sector \n5  (“Easterling Decl.”) ¶¶ 34-36 (explaining CBP concerns about fraudulent documentation \n6  and child trafficking, efforts to verify validity of documents through the consulate and other \n7  law enforcement agencies, and transfer of child to ORR when parentage “cannot be \n8  validated within a reasonable period of time.”) \n9  The answer to the second issue follows logically from the first: Defendants bear the \n10  burden to show that an adult is not the parent before removing the child from the adult’s \n11  custody.  While Defendants’ guidelines provide that CBP must “clearly establish[] that the \n12  familial relationship is not bonafide” before making a separation decision, (see ECF No. \n13  489 (Memorandum from Todd A. Hoffman, Executive Director, Office of Field Operations \n14  to  Directors,  Field Operations  (Oct.  1, 2018)),  it  appears  that guideline  is not being \n15  followed when parentage “cannot be validated” in a reasonable period.  \n16  As  discussed,  the  personal  right  at  issue  here,  to  family  integrity  and  familial \n17  association, is “constitutionally protected[,]” Quilloin, 434 U.S. at 255, and finds its source \n18  “in intrinsic human rights, as they have been understood in ‘this Nation’s history and \n19  tradition.’”  Smith v. Org. of Foster Families for Equality and Reform, 431 U.S. 816, 845 \n20  (1977) (quoting Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977)).  When the \n21  importance of this right is combined with the circumstances in which these parents find \n22  themselves, namely an unfamiliar custodial setting without access to resources other than \n23  their own paperwork, if any, and where Defendants have the ability to resolve any concerns \n24  about parentage quickly and inexpensively through the use of DNA testing, Defendants, \n25  not Plaintiffs, bear the burden to prove lack of parentage before making a separation \n26  decision.  Subjective concerns about parentage—or inability to validate documentation—\n27  are an insufficient basis for separation when those concerns can be definitively addressed \n28  through use of readily accessible, inexpensive and accurate scientific testing.   \n12 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9069   Page 13 of 26\n \n1  B.  Communicable Disease \n2  The next factor is communicable disease, and here Plaintiffs state Defendants have \n3  separated twenty-four (24) parents due to “illness.”  Of these twenty-four, Plaintiffs point \n4  out two cases of concern.  First, they complain about a father who was separated from his \n5  child because he has HIV.  (Mot. at 10.)  Defendants acknowledge that parent was excluded \n6  from the class “in error.”  (Opp’n to Mot. at 22 n.9.)   \n7  Second, Plaintiffs complain about a mother who was hospitalized for emergency \n8  surgery and whose child was placed in ORR custody as a result.  (Mot. at 10.)  Plaintiffs \n9  complain that when the mother was released from the hospital into the community, she was \n10  not reunified with her child in a timely manner, and the mother and her child were only \n11  reunified after Plaintiffs informed Defendants that the child’s lawyer had prepared a motion \n12  for the child’s release to the mother.  (Id. at 10-11.)  Here, again, Defendants concede error.  \n13  Specifically, they state the mother was mistakenly informed she would have to go through \n14  the typical ORR screening process designed for “unaccompanied alien children” set out in \n15  the Trafficking Victims Protection and Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”), Pub. L. No. 110-\n16  457 (Dec. 23, 2008), rather than the “Ms. L. reunification protocols” set out by the Court, \n17  to regain custody of her child.  (Opp’n to Mot. at 9 n.3.)  The child also was not placed in \n18  an ORR facility near the mother’s hospital.  (Id. at 21.)  Defendants explain the measures \n19  they have taken to avoid any recurrence of that situation.  (Id. at 9 n.3.)  They also explain \n20  that when a parent is hospitalized, DHS and ORR have been “work[ing] together to make \n21  efforts to place the child in ORR custody near the location where the parent is hospitalized \n22  to allow for reunification,” and that the situation described here was an anomaly.  (Id. at \n23  21.)  These efforts are consistent with Defendants’ interim guidelines.  (See Opp’n., Ex. 4 \n24  (CBP Interim Guidance Memorandum) (stating where parent “has an urgent medical need \n25  that is not a communicable disease, officers and agents should attempt to keep the family \n26  together in CBP custody, or parole both for medical care or contact the local Office of \n27  Chief Counsel.”)) \n28  / / / \n13 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9070   Page 14 of 26\n \n1  While each of the above cases resulted in unwarranted separations, they also reflect \n2  Defendants’  efforts to  ensure  those  mistakes  are not  repeated  and  the  importance  of \n3  Plaintiffs’ oversight.  These two cases also demonstrate what can be accomplished when \n4  the parties exchange information and work together.  Based on the present record, the Court \n5  declines to find Defendants are in violation of the Court’s orders with respect to the \n6  communicable disease factor.   \n7  C.  Criminal History \n8    The next factor is criminal history, which is of primary concern to Plaintiffs, likely \n9  because it has resulted in the largest number of family separations: nearly 750 from June \n10  26, 2018, through June 29, 2019.  On this factor, there are three primary disputes: (1) \n11  whether the criminal history exclusion applies to any criminal history or only criminal \n12  history bearing on a parent’s fitness or danger; (2) whether a conviction for illegal reentry \n13  under 8 U.S.C. § 1326 may be a basis for exclusion from the class; and (3) the standards \n14  for separating a parent and child based on gang affiliation.   \n15  1.  Scope of the Criminal History Exclusion \n16  Although Plaintiffs concede that parents with criminal history were excluded from \n17  the class, they argue that exclusion was limited to criminal history bearing on the parent’s \n18  fitness  and  danger,  not  just  any  criminal  history.    Defendants  disagree  with  that \n19  interpretation of the Court’s orders.  They assert any criminal history may be a basis for \n20  excluding a parent from the class.   Notably, however, Defendants state they are not \n21  excluding parents with any criminal history.  Rather, they are excluding only those parents \n22  “whose  criminal history,  in  a  good-faith  discretionary  determination by  DHS,  would \n23  generally prevent them from being released into the community and from being housed in \n24  an ICE FRC.”  (Opp’n to Mot. at 18.)  In other words, Defendants state they are including \n25  many parents in the class even though they have minor criminal history.  That assertion is \n26  consistent with CBP guidelines.  (See Opp’n to Mot., Ex. 4 (CBP Interim Guidance \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n14 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9071   Page 15 of 26\n \n1  Memorandum) (directing that a parent should not be separated from his or her minor child \n2  unless he or she has a criminal conviction for “violent misdemeanors or felonies.”7))  \n3  The present motion is not the first time the Court has been asked to decide a dispute \n4  over  exclusions  from  the  class  based  on  criminal  history.    Shortly  after  the  initial \n5  reunification efforts were completed, Plaintiffs filed a motion concerning two parents who \n6  had been excluded from the class, and therefore denied reunification with their children, \n7  based on their criminal history.  (See ECF No. 221.)  In that motion, Plaintiffs argued \n8  Defendants’ interpretation of the criminal history exclusion was too broad, and that the \n9  criminal histories at issue—an arrest warrant out of El Salvador for being a member of the \n10  MS-13  gang,  and  an  eight  year  old  misdemeanor  domestic  violence  conviction  for \n11  swinging a machete at his spouse—were insufficient bases for exclusion.  In the order on \n12  that motion, the Court noted the parties had debated the criminal history exclusion prior to \n13  issuance  of  the  class  certification  order,  with  Plaintiffs  expressing  concern  that \n14  “Defendants would abuse their discretion and exclude parents with minor misdemeanors, \n15  while  Defendants  were  concerned  with  their  ability  to  make  detention  decisions  for \n16  ‘individuals who posed a flight risk or danger to the community or others in a family \n17  detention facility because of that person’s criminal history.’”  (ECF No. 236 at 2 (citation \n18  omitted).)  The Court further noted the well-established principle that matters of detention \n19  and parole are within the province of the Executive Branch.  (Id.)  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § \n20  1231(g)(1) (stating the “Attorney General shall arrange for appropriate places of detention \n21  for aliens detained pending removal or a decision on removal.”); Comm. Of Cent. Am \n22  Refugees v. I.N.S., 795 F.2d 1434 (9th Cir. 1986) (stating Attorney General has broad \n23  discretion in deciding where to house deportable aliens).  Ultimately, the Court denied \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n7  “Violent misdemeanors” generally include offenses such as “assault, battery, burglary, \n26 \nresisting arrest, hit and run, and disorderly conduct.”  (See Opp’n. to Mot., Ex. 2 (Easterling \n27  Decl.) ¶ 16.)  “Simple thefts, fraud crimes, minor drug or traffic crimes, or driving while \nintoxicated  (without  an  aggravating  factor)  are  examples  of  offenses  that  would  not \n28 \ngenerally justify separation.”  (Id.) \n15 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9072   Page 16 of 26\n \n1  Plaintiffs’ motion to include these parents in the class, and declined to interfere with \n2  Defendants’ determination that the two parents had “disqualifying criminal history that \n3  precludes reunification with the children and either release into the community or detention \n4  in a family residential center.”  (ECF No. 236 at 3.)   \n5  As with Plaintiffs’ previous motion  on this issue, the Court again agrees with \n6  Defendants that parents may be excluded from the class based on any criminal history, not \n7  just criminal history that bears on a parent’s fitness or danger.  Plaintiffs’ approach ignores \n8  the context of this case.  This case does not involve individual issues of child welfare that \n9  typically confront child protective service agencies.  Rather, the system at issue in this case \n10  involves CBP officers making decisions about hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people \n11  crossing daily at the border.  Given the large number of migrant families arriving at the \n12  border and the inherent limitations placed on CBP facilities at the border,8 Defendants must \n13  be able to use criminal history as an objective metric not only to assess the parent’s fitness \n14  and danger to the child, but also risk of flight, danger to others and suitability for release \n15  into the community or placement in an FRC with other families.  Factually, this case is not \n16  amenable to Plaintiffs’ proposed approach.   \n17    The procedural posture of the case also fails to lend support to Plaintiffs’ approach.  \n18  Procedurally, this case is proceeding as a class action on Plaintiffs’ substantive due process \n19 \n                                                \n20 \n21  8  (See Opp’n. to Mot., Ex. 2 (Easterling Decl.) ¶ 5) (stating “Border Patrol stations are \ndesigned for short-term custody.  For multiple reasons (a high number of individuals \n22 \narrested on a daily basis; time-in-custody requirements imposed by the [TVPRA]; the \n23  Flores Stipulated Settlement Agreement; the need to ensure that individuals referred for \nprosecution are promptly presented before a Magistrate Judge; and the general fact that \n24 \nBorder Patrol Stations were not designed to hold individuals—particularly children—for a \n25  long period of time) Border Patrol Agents process all individuals as expeditiously as \npossible and make every effort to transfer them to facilities that are more appropriate for \n26 \nlonger-term detention (such as those run by … [ICE and ORR]).  Therefore, agents must \n27  often make processing determinations based on the limited information available to them \nat the time of encounter.”) \n28 \n \n16 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9073   Page 17 of 26\n \n1  claim.  In granting class certification, the Court excluded from the class parents with \n2  criminal  history  because  including  them  would  have  destroyed  the  commonality \n3  requirement.  That requirement was met based on Defendants’ practice or policy of family \n4  separation to deter immigration, not individual decisions about a parent’s criminal history.  \n5  Plaintiffs’ approach ignores the criminal history carve out, and jeopardizes the class’s \n6  status  because  it  invites  individualized  determinations  about  the  reasons  for  family \n7  separations rather than focusing on the common policy.   \n8  Defendants’ focus on violent misdemeanors and felonies when evaluating a parent’s \n9  criminal history and determining whether a parent should be separated from his or her child \n10  indicates good faith and compliance with the Court’s orders.  For these reasons, the Court \n11  declines to adopt Plaintiffs’ approach to the scope of the criminal history exclusion. \n12  2.  8 U.S.C. § 1326 \n13    Turning to the next issue, the parties agree there is one exception to the criminal \n14  history exclusion: illegal entry into the United States under 8 U.S.C. § 1325.  (See Opp’n \n15  to Mot.  at  18 n.6) (stating  Defendants  have been treating  parents  with section  1325 \n16  convictions “as class members eligible for relief under the preliminary injunction.”))  See \n17  also Exec. Order No. 13841, § 3 (stating the Secretary of Homeland Security shall “to the \n18  extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, maintain custody \n19  of  alien  families  during  the  pendency  of  any  criminal  improper  entry  [§  1325]  or \n20  immigration  proceedings  involving  their  [family]  members.”);  OIG  DHS  Report \n21  (11/27/19) (stating prior to zero tolerance policy, “in most instances, family units either \n22  remained  together  in  family  detention  centers  operated  by  ICE  while  their  civil \n23  immigration cases were pending, or they were released into the United States with orders \n24  to appear in immigration court at a later date.”)  The parties do not agree, however, on \n25  whether convictions for illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. § 1326 qualify for an exception.  \n26  This issue first came up during a July 16, 2018 hearing.  (See ECF No. 117 at 53.)  During \n27  that hearing, Plaintiffs sought clarification from Defendants on whether parents with § \n28  1326 violations were being excluded from the class.  Based on testimony at that hearing, \n17 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9074   Page 18 of 26\n \n1  the Court made “the assumption that 1325, 1326 collectively would not exclude[,]” but left \n2  counsel to meet and confer on that issue.  (Id.)   \n3  In their opposition to the present motion, Defendants propose the following for \n4  parents with § 1326 convictions:   \n5 \n[During or immediately following] service of any sentence for a section 1326 \n6 \nconviction,  Defendants  will  endeavor  to  promptly  complete  the  removal \n7  process consistent with applicable law, including processing the parent for \nreinstatement of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5).  Should the parent \n8 \nbecome subject to an executable removal order (e.g., no pending reasonable \n9  fear claim or withholding only proceedings before the Executive Office for \nImmigration  Review),  the government  anticipates  offering  the  parent the \n10 \nchoice whether to be removed with his or her child or to allow the child to \n11  remain in the United States to pursue any immigration claims that the child \nmay have.   \n12 \n13  (Id. at 19 n.7.)   \n14  Plaintiffs urge the Court to reject this proposal, and instead “reiterate” that § 1326 \n15  convictions, like § 1325 convictions, are not a basis for exclusion from the class.  (Reply \n16  at 14.)  Counsel for the settlement class of children in the MMM/Dora cases also object to \n17  Defendants’ proposal on the ground it could “prevent[ ] separated children and their parents \n18  from meaningfully exercising their rights to seek relief from removal.”  (ECF No. 480 at \n19  1.)  They propose an alternate process for parents with § 1326 convictions “in which parents \n20  and children jointly decide on reunification, and have the option to reunify for a joint \n21  reasonable fear and credible fear screening, [which] would avoid violating parents’ and \n22  childrens’ right to seek relief from removal.”  (Id.)  Alternatively MMM/Dora counsel \n23  request that the Court defer ruling on this issue so the parties can continue to meet and \n24  confer.  (Id. at 2.)   \n25  This issue has been percolating for well over a year now despite the parties’ efforts \n26  to come to an agreement, so the Court addresses it now.  At first glance, it appears § 1326 \n27  convictions should be treated the same as § 1325 convictions for purposes of this case \n28  because both statutes criminalize the same general conduct, namely illegal entry into the \n18 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9075   Page 19 of 26\n \n1  United States.  But there are differences, and some of them are significant.  Section 1325 \n2  is charged as a misdemeanor with up to six months imprisonment for the first improper \n3  entry offense and may be charged as a felony with up to two years imprisonment for a \n4  second improper entry offense, while § 1326 is only chargeable as a felony and carries a \n5  statutory maximum sentence of two, ten or twenty years imprisonment depending on a \n6  person’s immigration and criminal history.  Also, unlike § 1325, which concerns unlawful \n7  entry and no prior removal, § 1326 concerns unlawful reentry, which indicates a prior \n8  removal (deportation) and often other criminal history.  A § 1326 conviction also impacts \n9  a person’s options under the immigration laws.  (See Defs.’ Resp. to MMM Br. at 3) (stating \n10  “violation of section 1326 is a serious felony and those who illegally re-enter and whose \n11  previous  orders  of  removal  are  reinstated  are  barred  from  seeking  asylum”).    Thus, \n12  although § 1325 and § 1326 convictions concern the same conduct in the abstract, the \n13  repetitive nature of the conduct underlying § 1326, including prior removal(s) and possible \n14  prior conviction(s), calls for different treatment of that offense in this case.   \n15  Defendants are therefore justified in excluding from the class parents who are \n16  separated from their children at the border as a result of the parent being charged, convicted \n17  and sentenced under § 1326, as well as parents who have a prior § 1326 conviction.9  Absent \n18  membership in the class, these parents would not be entitled to the relief provided by the \n19  Court’s orders in Ms. L. and MMM/Dora.  Nevertheless, Defendants agree that if these \n20 \n                                                \n21 \n9  It appears the exclusion of parents with a prior illegal reentry offense from the Ms. L. \n22 \nclass may impact relatively few.  If a parent “has criminal history consisting only of a prior \n23  conviction for 8 U.S.C. § 1326 …, RGV Sector [Texas] does not, in general, separate the \nparent from the child.”  (See Opp’n. to Mot., Ex. 2 (Easterling Decl.) ¶ 21.)  An “alien \n24 \nparent’s  prior  immigration  history,  standing  alone,  is  not  used  as  a  basis  to  justify \n25  separation from an alien child.”  (Id. ¶ 4.)  In addition, the number of cases the U.S. \nAttorney’s Office elects to prosecute for § 1326 of parents crossing with their children \n26 \nappears to be relatively small.  (Id. ¶ 21) (stating in “fiscal year 2019 (through August 27, \n27  2019), RGV Sector processed 10,809 parents accompanying children for reinstatement of \nremoval because of prior removal orders.  CBP’s statistics reflect that only 140 of these \n28 \nparents (1.3%) were actually prosecuted for illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. § 1326.”) \n19 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9076   Page 20 of 26\n \n1  parents become subject to an executable removal order, they will offer these parents “the \n2  choice whether to be removed with [their] child or to allow the child to remain in the United \n3  States to pursue any immigration claims the child may have.”  (Opp’n to Mot. at 19 n.7.)  \n4  Although Plaintiffs and MMM/Dora counsel object to this proposal, it is consistent with \n5  the Court’s orders in this case.   \n6  3.  Gang Affiliation \n7  Of the nearly 750 parents separated from their children based on criminal history, \n8  Plaintiffs contend thirty-seven (37) of them have been separated based on gang affiliation \n9  alone.  (Mot. at 25.)  As noted, the issue of gang affiliation came before the Court on \n10  Plaintiffs’ previous motion to reunify a parent who had been separated from her child based \n11  on a warrant out of El Salvador alleging she was affiliated with a violent gang.  (See ECF \n12  No. 221 at 4.)  There, Plaintiffs disputed the allegation, but the Court declined to order \n13  reunification, and deferred to Defendants’ determination that the mother’s criminal history \n14  precluded reunification with her child and either release into the community or detention \n15  in a family residential center.  (ECF No. 236 at 3.)   \n16  Here, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are separating parents and children based \n17  solely on unsupported allegations of gang affiliation, and that evidence collected after the \n18  separations demonstrates those initial determinations of gang affiliation are incorrect.  The \n19  record does not support Plaintiffs’ first argument that these decisions are being made on \n20  speculation of gang affiliation.  Rather, the record reflects that as part of the intake process, \n21  border patrol agents may receive information “from foreign governments and other law \n22  enforcement databases” indicating “that an individual has been identified as affiliated with \n23  a criminal gang[.]”  (Opp’n. to Mot., Ex. 2 (Easterling Decl.) ¶ 20.)  Although Plaintiffs \n24  complain  about  the  reliability  of  this  evidence,  Defendants  are  relying  on  objective \n25  evidence, not allegations or intuition.   \n26  Although the initial evidence of gang affiliation may turn out to be inaccurate, border \n27  officials have limited information during the intake process and limited time to further \n28  investigate at that stage.  (Id. ¶18.)  The record also reflects that when the families or their \n20 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9077   Page 21 of 26\n \n1  attorneys have subsequently obtained evidence refuting or qualifying allegations of gang \n2  affiliation, Defendants have reunified the parents and children when appropriate.  On this \n3  record,  where  Defendants  are  relying  on  foreign  records  or  other  law  enforcement \n4  databases, and not subjective concerns about gang affiliation, and where the parties have \n5  successfully resolved disputed cases, the Court declines to find Defendants are violating \n6  the Court’s preliminary injunction with respect to gang affiliation.   \n7  D.  Fitness and Danger \n8  The next area of dispute concerns fitness and danger.  Plaintiffs assert that during \n9  the  timeframe  in  question  Defendants  have  separated  twenty  (20)  families  based  on \n10  “dubious” and “questionable” determinations of fitness and danger.  Defendants assert they \n11  are exercising their discretion and judgment in a reasonable manner, and that the Court \n12  should decline to second-guess those determinations. \n13  According to Defendants, the determination that a parent is unfit or presents a danger \n14  to his or her child is made after evaluating the particular circumstances of an individual \n15  case.  (Opp’n to Mot. at 6.)  As for the substantive decision, Defendants state:  \n16  [A]gents and officers may make the decision on a review of any available \nrecords about the parent, as well as observations made while the parent and \n17 \nchild  are  in  DHS  custody,  including  immediately  following  the  initial \n18  encounter with the family, and the views of medical professionals available to \nthe officers and agents.   \n19 \n \n20  (Id. at 6.)  In addition, decisions to separate must be reviewed and approved by a supervisor, \n21  and CBP’s Office of Chief Counsel is often involved.  (Id. at 7-8.)   \n22  The factual circumstances under which these initial determinations are made do not \n23  lend themselves to micromanagement by the Court.  This is especially so given the class \n24  action nature of this case.  Defendants must be allowed discretion to make these decisions \n25  based on the available information.  Concerns about lack of fitness and danger to a child \n26  often  overlap  and  include  many  scenarios  that  are  difficult  to  assess  under  ideal \n27  circumstances, let alone at the border: mental disorders, active users of illicit controlled \n28  substances,  odd  behavior  (e.g.,  climbing  cell  fencing  and  feigning  passing  out),  and \n21 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9078   Page 22 of 26\n \n1  potential criminal activity, including child trafficking, sexual abuse and physical abuse.  \n2  (See Opp’n., Ex. 2 (Easterling Decl.) ¶¶ 25-29).  The Court expects that field officers and \n3  agents and medical professionals will exercise their discretion in a reasonable manner \n4  based on the evidence then available, and that the reasonableness of those decisions will \n5  be  reviewed  by  appropriate  supervisors  before  separation  decisions  are  made.    It  is \n6  expected the parties will meet and confer on disputed findings of fitness and danger, as \n7  they have been doing on the issues of communicable disease and gang affiliation.  Given \n8  the intensely factual nature of these decisions and the processes now in place for parents to \n9  challenge such decisions, (see ECF No. 489 (Memorandum from Carla L. Prevost, Chief, \n10  U.S. Border Patrol to All Chief Patrol Agents and All Directorate Chiefs (Sep. 16, 2019) \n11  (“Prevost Memo”) (explaining and attaching “Tear Sheet,” which informs a parent who \n12  has been separated from his or her child of the reasons for separation, how to contact their \n13  child  and  how  to  contest  separation  from  their  child)),10  the  Court  declines  to  find \n14  Defendants are violating the injunction with respect to this factor. \n15  E.  FRC Standards \n16    The final issue is Defendants’ standards for placement in FRCs.   Specifically, \n17  Plaintiffs assert those standards are vague and inconsistent, and result in unconstitutional \n18  separations of parents and children.   \n19    Notably,  the  claims  in  this  case  do  not  challenge  Defendants’  FRC  standards.  \n20  Rather, this case has always focused on Defendants’ general practices of separating parents \n21  and children at the border for reasons other than the FRC standards.  In other words, the \n22 \n23                                                  \n24 \n10  The Tear Sheet advises parents: “If you believe that your separation from your child was \n25  improper and would like to provide the government with additional information, you may \nsubmit that information to SeparationSupplementalInformation@ice.dhs.gov.  DHS will \n26 \nreview any information submitted within 30 days and, if DHS determines some further \n27  action is appropriate, you will be so informed.”  The “Separation Supplemental Information \nForm”  informs  the  parent  how  to  challenge  the  separation  decision  and  request \n28 \nreunification.   \n22 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9079   Page 23 of 26\n \n1  FRC standards are not the basis for Plaintiffs’ claims, nor have they been the subject of this \n2  Court’s previous orders.  Defendants must be able to consider danger to others and risk of \n3  flight in addition to fitness and danger of a parent to his or her own child.  (See Opp’n to \n4  Mot., Ex. 5 (Decl. of Melissa Harper) ¶¶6-7, 10 (stating parents with criminal history or \n5  gang affiliation are generally excluded from FRCs because of risk of flight and harm to \n6  families, though in exceptional cases a parent with a non-violent misdemeanor offense may \n7  be admitted.))11  Careful assessment of all of these factors is necessary in the context of \n8  this case and may result in separation of a parent who is otherwise fit and not a danger to \n9  his or her own child but poses an unacceptable risk to others or of flight.  Given the scope \n10  of this case and the statutory framework providing discretion to Executive Branch officials \n11  in matters of detention and parole, see 8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1), the Court declines to wade \n12  into the constitutionality of the FRC standards on the present record.   \n13  Plaintiffs also argue that by using any criminal history, Defendants can take a parent \n14  out of the class and absolve themselves “of any obligation to immediately reunify the \n15  family when the parent is released from an adult detention center [by an immigration judge] \n16  (which happens frequently when the government cannot show that the parent is a flight risk \n17  or danger [to others]”).”  (See Suppl. Br. at 1-2.)  Plaintiffs argue that parents who are \n18  excluded from FRCs but later released from immigration detention are not being reunified \n19  with their children during the pendency of their immigration proceedings.    The Court \n20  agrees with Plaintiffs that if a parent who is separated from his or her child due to FRC \n21  standards is subsequently released from custody, then Defendants should reunify that \n22  parent with his or her child in the same way they are reunifying families with resolved \n23 \n                                                \n24 \n25  11  Defendants assert FRCs are governed by standards that are designed to “promote a \nunique, non-secure, open-movement environment which permits parents and children to \n26 \nlive in a dorm-like setting with access to education, recreational opportunities, and health \n27  care on site.”  (See Opp’n to Mot., Ex. 5 (Harper Decl. ¶ 4.))  The safety of family residents \nis also regulated by state licensing requirements that impose “legal prohibitions on criminal \n28 \nindividuals living, visiting or working at such licensed facilities.”  (Id. ¶¶ 8-9.)  \n23 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9080   Page 24 of 26\n \n1  communicable diseases or long-term illnesses.  (See ECF No. 489 (Prevost Memo, Tear \n2  Sheet)  (informing  parents  that  “following  the  conclusion  of  any  criminal  custody  or \n3  hospitalization” the parent will be transferred to ICE custody and DHS and ICE “will take \n4  steps to determine whether you may be reunified with your child or children.”))  This \n5  clarification  does  not  interfere  with  Defendants’  discretion  in  matters  of  parole  or \n6  detention.  CBP’s initial determination to detain the parent remains undisturbed until \n7  another Executive Branch officer (an immigration judge) decides later based on additional \n8  information to release the parent on bond or other appropriate conditions pending their \n9  removal proceedings.  Should Defendants fail to reunify parents under these circumstances, \n10  parents can also now avail themselves of the “Tear Sheet”  process, by which they can \n11  make application for and be reunified with their children.  Except for this clarification, the \n12  Court declines to intervene further on this issue. \n13  III. \n14  CONCLUSION \n15    Plaintiffs assert Defendants have returned to systematically separating families at \n16  the border.  However, the evidence before the Court does not support that assertion.  \n17  Although family separations have not stopped entirely, the number of family separations \n18  compared to the number of family units crossing the border appears to be less than one \n19  percent.12  Furthermore, the Executive Order abandoned the zero tolerance policy in favor \n20  of a policy to maintain family unity, and Defendants have implemented policies and \n21 \n                                                \n22 \n23  12  Defendants represent that the number of parents separated from their children between \nJune 27, 2018, and July 20, 2019, is less than .4% of the overall number of individuals \n24 \nentering the United States as members of a family unit over the same time period.  (Opp’n \n25  to Mot. at 1.)  Defendants state that during “an almost overlapping timeframe, from July 1, \n2018 through July 30, 2019, … CBP data reflects that 524,294 individuals have crossed \n26 \nthe southwest border at or between ports of entry as a member of a family unit[.]”  (Id. at \n27  5.)  See also Innovation Law Lab v. McAleenan, 924 F.3d 503, 510 (9th Cir. 2019) (noting \nthat for several months in 2018, approximately 2,000 migrants were “arriving at the \n28 \nNation’s southern border on a daily basis”).   \n24 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9081   Page 25 of 26\n \n1  procedures that are largely consistent with this Court’s orders prohibiting family separation \n2  in the absence of the factors discussed above.  Defendants have also gone beyond the scope \n3  of  the  Court’s  injunction  and  implemented  additional  practices  related  to  family \n4  separations, such as the Tear Sheet, which provide parents with the reasons for any \n5  separations and information on how to challenge any separation decisions.   \n6  In the present motion, Plaintiffs invite the Court to engage in prospective oversight \n7  of Defendants’ separation decisions, but that invitation warrants caution.  It is an invitation \n8  that is potentially massive in scope, invades an area that is particularly within the province \n9  of the Executive Branch to secure the Nation’s border, and goes beyond this Court’s class \n10  certification  and  preliminary  injunction  orders,  which  were  focused  on  the \n11  Administration’s practice of separating families at the border for the purpose of deterring \n12  immigration, and failing to reunify those families.13  The Court is satisfied that the factors \n13  discussed above provide an appropriate balance between the constitutional right to family \n14  integrity and the government’s interests in border security and criminal and immigration \n15  law enforcement.  See J.B. v. Washington County, 127 F.3d 919, 927 (10th Cir. 1997) \n16  (quoting Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 321 (1982)) (stating evaluation of party’s \n17  “substantive due process rights require[s] a ‘balancing [of the party’s] liberty interests \n18  against  the  relevant  state  interests.’”)    Except  for  DNA  testing  and  the  clarification \n19  regarding FRC standards, Defendants’ application of these factors has generally been \n20  / / / \n21 \n                                                \n22 \n23  13    Although  the  Court  previously  examined  Defendants’  conduct  in  determining \ncompliance with the preliminary injunction, that scrutiny occurred in a limited context—\n24 \ni.e., whether Defendants’ exclusion of parents from the original class of 2,814 was proper \n25  based on their criminal history.  That examination was retrospective, confined to two \nparents, and concerned reunification.  In contrast, Plaintiffs’ present motion invites the \n26 \nCourt to set out additional “guidelines” for DHS to use before separating a family unit and, \n27  if necessary, to appoint a monitor to oversee DHS’s exercise of discretion in making those \ndecisions for hundreds of thousands of migrant families arriving at the border.  That is \n28 \nunwarranted on the present record. \n25 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 509   Filed 01/13/20   PageID.9082   Page 26 of 26\n \n1  consistent with this Court’s orders and thus Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce the preliminary \n2  injunction is otherwise respectfully denied.   \n3  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n4  Dated:  January 13, 2020   \n5 \n6 \n \n7 \n \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n26 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) ",

MOTION TO MODIFY CLASS \nDEFINITION \n14  U.S Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”); et al., \n15 \nRespondents-Defendants. \n16 \n \n17 \n  Last spring, the Attorney General of the United States announced a controversial \n18 \n“zero tolerance” policy for all persons crossing the border illegally.  Under the policy, \n19 \nparents and children who crossed the border illegally were separated, and the children were \n20 \nplaced in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Office \n21 \nof Refugee and Resettlement (“ORR”).  Several weeks before the Attorney General’s \n22 \nannouncement of the zero tolerance policy, Plaintiffs filed the present case alleging they, \n23 \nand a class of similarly situated individuals, had been forcibly separated from their children \n24 \nby government officials at the border.  Plaintiffs alleged these separations were the result \n25 \nof a nationwide policy that had been implemented well before the announcement of the \n26 \nzero tolerance policy and that the policy had resulted in the indiscriminate separation of \n27 \nmigrant families both at and between designated ports of entry.  Plaintiffs challenged this \n28 \n1 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5752   Page 2 of 14\n \n1  family separation policy as a violation of their substantive due process rights to family \n2  integrity under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.   \n3  On June 26, 2018, this Court granted Plaintiffs’ motions for class certification and \n4  for a preliminary injunction, and ordered reunification of the children in ORR custody with \n5  their parents within 30 days.  (See ECF Nos. 82, 83.)  Pursuant to the Court’s Orders, 2,816 \n6  children were identified as having been separated from their parents at the border, and \n7  nearly all of them have now been reunified with their parents or otherwise discharged in \n8  accordance with their parents’ wishes.  \n9  Recently,  the  HHS Office of Inspector General  (“OIG”)  conducted  an  internal \n10  investigation into the Administration’s zero tolerance policy given “the potential impact of \n11  [the policy] on vulnerable children and ORR operations[,]” and “to determine the number \n12  and status of separated children who have entered ORR care” as a result of the policy.  On \n13  January 17, 2019, the OIG issued a Report on its investigation entitled, “Separated Children \n14  Placed in Office of Refugee Resettlement Care.”  That Report reveals the Department of \n15  Justice (“DOJ”) and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) began separating \n16  migrant families as early as July 1, 2017, well before the zero tolerance policy was publicly \n17  announced in May of 2018, and that pursuant to the policy, potentially “thousands” more \n18  families had been separated.   \n19  In granting class certification, this Court generally defined the class to include \n20  parents who had entered the United States at or between ports of entry, who were, had been \n21  or would be detained in immigration custody by DHS, and had a minor child who was \n22  separated from them and detained in ORR custody at or after that time.  Specifically, the \n23  class was defined as follows: \n24  All adult parents who enter the United States at or between designated ports \nof entry who (1) have been, are, or will be detained in immigration custody \n25 \nby the DHS, and (2) have a minor child who is or will be separated from them \n26  by DHS and detained in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody, \nabsent a determination that the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child. \n27 \n \n28  / / / \n2 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5753   Page 3 of 14\n \n1  (ECF No. 82 at 17.)  In implementing the Court’s preliminary injunction and reunification \n2  order, Defendants limited this class to parents whose children were “detained in ORR \n3  custody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody” on the date the preliminary injunction was \n4  issued, June 26, 2018.  Defendants did not include in the class those parents whose children \n5  were released from ORR custody before June 26, 2018.  As a result, those parents—the \n6  potentially “thousands” identified by OIG—were not reunified with their children pursuant \n7  to the Court’s preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs now move to clarify that the class certified \n8  in the Court’s Order includes those parents, or in the alternative, to modify the class \n9  definition to include those parents.  After reviewing the parties’ briefs and relevant legal \n10  authority, and hearing argument from counsel, the Court grants Plaintiffs’  motion to \n11  modify the class definition.   \n12    Defendants oppose the motion on several grounds.  They contend that expanding the \n13  class to include these parents would run afoul of the adequacy, typicality and commonality \n14  requirements  of  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(a),  and  present  ascertainability \n15  problems.  Defendants argue parents whose children were released from government \n16  custody before June 26, 2018, are in a different legal position from parents whose children \n17  were in government custody on or after that date.  They also argue Plaintiffs delayed raising \n18  this issue, and that it would be unfair to Defendants to expand the class after they have \n19  reunified so many class members with their children.   \n20    There is no dispute “courts retain discretion to revisit class certification throughout \n21  the legal proceedings, and may rescind, modify, or amend the class definition in light of \n22  subsequent developments in the litigation.”  Krueger v. Wyeth, Inc., 310 F.R.D. 468, 473-\n23  74 (S.D. Cal. 2015).  This authority is found in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(C), \n24  which states, “[a]n order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended \n25  before final judgment[,]” and in Supreme Court case law.  See Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 \n26  U.S. 147, 160 (1982) (“Even after a certification order is entered, the judge remains free to \n27  modify it in the light of subsequent developments in the litigation.”)  “’In considering the \n28  appropriateness of [modification or] decertification, the standard of review is the same as \n3 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5754   Page 4 of 14\n \n1  a motion for class certification:  whether the Rule 23 requirements are met.’”  Roy v. County \n2  of Los Angeles, No. CV 13-04416-AB (FFMx), 2018 WL 3435417, at *2 (C.D. Cal. July \n3  11, 2018) (quoting Marlo v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 251 F.R.D. 476, 479 (C.D. Cal. \n4  2008)).  See also Lyon v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, 308 F.R.D. 203, 210-\n5  11 (N.D. Cal. 2015); Astiana v. Kashi Co., 295 F.R.D. 490, 492 (S.D. Cal. 2013) (same).   \n6    Here, Plaintiffs first notified the Court of their concerns with the class definition in \n7  the November 29, 2018 Joint Status Report (“JSR”).  (See ECF No. 329.)  In that document, \n8  Plaintiffs’ counsel stated that on November 16, 2018, they “learned of a separated parent \n9  who feared imminent removal because her child was released from ORR custody before \n10  June 26, 2018.”    (Id.  at 18.)    Plaintiffs’  counsel  stated  during  the subsequent status \n11  conference that they had learned of “a handful” of such cases.  (ECF No. 332 at 16.)  \n12  Counsel informed the Court they had met and conferred on this issue, and “agreed that \n13  removals of individuals in this category be stayed pending the Court’s resolution.”  (ECF \n14  No. 329 at 18.)  Defense counsel requested that the issue be resolved by way of a formal \n15  noticed motion, to which the Court agreed.   \n16    Thereafter, Plaintiffs filed the present motion based on the information they had at \n17  that time.  Before Defendants filed their response, the case was stayed because of the \n18  government shutdown.  During the stay, OIG issued its Report.  As noted above, the \n19  purpose of the OIG investigation was to determine the number and status of separated \n20  children “who have entered ORR care, including but not limited to the subset of separated \n21  children covered by [the present case,] Ms. L. v. ICE.”  (Report at 1.)  OIG found the \n22  following:   \n23  In the summer of 2017, prior to the formal announcement of the zero-tolerance \npolicy, ORR staff and officials observed a steep increase in the number of \n24 \nchildren  who  had  been  separated  from  a  parent  or  guardian  by  DHS \n25  (“separated children”) and subsequently referred to ORR for care.[ ]  Officials \nestimated that ORR received and released thousands of separated children \n26 \nprior to a June 26, 2018, court order in Ms. L v. ICE that required ORR to \n27  identify and reunify certain separated children in its care as of that date.   \n \n28 \n4 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5755   Page 5 of 14\n \n1  (Id.)  Although the Administration’s zero tolerance policy was publicly announced in May \n2  2018, the OIG Report states, “From July through November 2017, the El Paso sector of \n3  Customs and Border Protection (CBP), an agency within DHS, implemented new policies \n4  that resulted in 281 families being separated.”  (Id. at 3.)  During this same period, July \n5  through November 2017, ORR staff “observed a significant increase in the number and \n6  proportion of separated children (i.e., children separated from their parent or legal guardian \n7  by DHS) relative to other UACs [unaccompanied alien children].”  (Id.)  “Overall, ORR \n8  and ASPR [the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response] officials \n9  estimate that thousands of separated children entered ORR care and were released prior to \n10  the June 26, 2018 court order.”  (Id.)   \n11    Clearly, the OIG Report is a significant development in this case.  And, importantly, \n12  the contents of the Report are undisputed.  The most significant facts to come out of the \n13  Report are (1) that in the summer of 2017, DOJ and DHS were separating parents and \n14  children at the border pursuant to the Administration’s new policy, and (2) during and after \n15  that time, potentially thousands of children who had been separated from a parent were \n16  received by ORR and subsequently discharged from ORR custody to designated sponsors \n17  pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection and Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”), Pub. \n18  Law No. 110-457 (Dec. 13, 2008), prior to the Court’s June 26, 2018 Orders. \n19    Defendants suggest this information is not a new development, but rather something \n20  the parties knew about, or should have known about, when the Court issued its Orders.  \n21  However, that suggestion stands in stark contrast to Defendants’ representations in this \n22  case in as late as May of 2018 that the government did not have either a policy or practice \n23  of separating families at the border.  (See ECF No. 61 at 10 (stating Plaintiffs failed to point \n24  to  an  “actual  Government  policy  or  practice  regarding  separation”  but  were  instead \n25  “challenging a number of different immigration and criminal enforcement actions by \n26  multiple agencies which, when taken with regard to the named Plaintiffs, resulted in the \n27  separation of each named Plaintiff from her child.”); see also ECF No. 70 at 5 (disputing  \n28  / / / \n5 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5756   Page 6 of 14\n \n1  that there was a policy or practice of family separation).)1  In light of those representations, \n2  it is unreasonable to suggest that Plaintiffs should have known that potentially thousands \n3  of parents and children had been separated at the border prior to the Court’s June 26, 2018 \n4  Orders.2  Given the subsequent, undisputed developments set out in the OIG Report, \n5  modification of the class is warranted if the class, as modified, meets the requirements of \n6  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. \n7    As set out in the Court’s previous order on class certification, Rule 23(a) sets out the \n8  requirements  of  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and  adequacy  of  representation.  \n9  Numerosity is not disputed as there are thousands of members in the class as currently \n10  certified,  so  the  Court  turns  first  to  commonality.    In  the  previous  order  on  class \n11  certification, the Court found the commonality requirement was met given the evidence of \n12  a “common practice” of “separating migrant parents and children and failing to reunite \n13  them without a showing the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.”  (ECF No. 82 \n14  at 12.)  The Court went on to state: “Whether that practice violates substantive due process \n15  is a question common to the class, and the answer to that question is ‘apt to drive the \n16  resolution of the litigation.’”  (Id.) (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, \n17  350 (2011)).  That finding applies equally to the proposed modified class. \n18    There is no dispute the parents who have been excluded from the class were also \n19  subjected to this “common practice.”  Like the current members of the class, they, too, \n20  were separated from their children by DOJ and DHS, their children were placed in ORR \n21 \n                                                \n22 \n23  1  The Court notes the latter representation was made only a few days before the Attorney \nGeneral publicly announced the zero tolerance policy under which children were to be \n24 \nseparated from their parents if they entered the country illegally.   \n25  2  Undoubtedly, Plaintiffs would have discovered the total number of separated children in \nORR custody through normal discovery channels in this litigation.  However, the parties \n26 \ndid not engage in discovery at the outset of the litigation.  Instead, they properly focused \n27  their intense efforts on implementing the Court’s preliminary injunction, which required \nreunification of children with their parents within 14 days (for children under age 5) and \n28 \n30 days (for children over 5).   \n6 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5757   Page 7 of 14\n \n1  custody, and they were not reunified with their children despite the absence of any finding \n2  they were unfit parents or presented a danger to their children.  These parents, like those \n3  presently in the class, present the identical question, namely did that practice violate the \n4  parents’ rights to substantive due process, and the answer to that question applies to all \n5  these parents, not just those whose children were in ORR custody on June 26, 2018.     \n6    Defendants argue this new group of parents presents a different legal and factual \n7  situation from the current class members because the children of this new group are no \n8  longer in ORR custody, and thus, reunification of these parents and their children may be \n9  impossible or ill-advised.  However, this argument goes to the issue of remedy, not liability, \n10  and Ninth Circuit case law makes clear that a difference in remedies does not necessarily \n11  defeat a showing of commonality.  See Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th \n12  Cir. 1998) (“The existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual predicates is \n13  sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies within \n14  the class.”); see also Parra v. Bashas’, Inc., 536 F.3d 975, 979 (9th Cir. 2008) (rejecting \n15  argument that “redressing the harm and calculating the various pay disparities for the \n16  different employment positions precludes class certification.”).  Further, reunification is \n17  not the only remedy available here.  Other remedies may be appropriate, and they would \n18  apply to all class members.  For instance, as OIG has suggested, an accounting is a \n19  necessary first step to determine the “number and status” of separated children who were \n20  in ORR custody at any time.3  And, finally, Defendants’ argument ignores Plaintiffs’ \n21  request for declaratory relief, namely a declaration that the separation of class members \n22  from their children was and is unlawful.  (Am. Compl. at 14.)  This remedy would be  \n23  / / / \n24  / / / \n25  / / / \n26 \n                                                \n27 \n3  That accounting necessarily would provide important information about the number and \n28 \nstatus of the proposed modified parent class members. \n7 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5758   Page 8 of 14\n \n1  available to all class members regardless of the custodial status of their children.4  Thus, \n2  the newly proposed class satisfies the commonality requirement.5   \n3    Next, Defendants argue the proposed modification to the class definition does not \n4  satisfy the adequacy requirement.  Specifically, they assert “Plaintiffs’ proposed expansion \n5  of the class would … create an adequacy problem, because no named class member at the \n6  time class certification was being briefed was in the situation where her child had been \n7  released from ORR custody to a sponsor.”  (Defs.’ Opp’n to Mot. at 2; see also id. at 16 \n8  (arguing “the named plaintiffs … cannot be adequate class representatives for the expanded \n9  class … because neither of their children were released to other sponsors, and both of them \n10  sought reunification with their child directly from ORR.”))  However, it is unclear how the \n11  location  of  the  separated  children  would  render  the  class  representatives  inadequate.  \n12  Defendants do not assert the location of the separated children creates a conflict between \n13  the named Plaintiffs and their counsel and the newly proposed class members.  Nor do they \n14  assert that the named Plaintiffs would not vigorously prosecute the action on behalf of these \n15  newly proposed class members.  Indeed, the named Plaintiffs  and their counsel have \n16  vigorously prosecuted this action on behalf of parents who were removed from the United \n17  States even though they themselves were not removed.  There is simply no evidence or \n18  reason to believe that the named Plaintiffs or their counsel would not vigorously prosecute \n19  this action on behalf of parents who were subjected to the same government policy but \n20 \n21                                                  \n22 \n4  Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief also satisfies the requirement of Rule 23(b)(2), \n23  which states class certification is appropriate if “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive or \n24 \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole[.]”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) \n25  (emphasis added).   \n5  As with the motion for class certification, the parties’ arguments on typicality mirror their \n26 \narguments on commonality.  Given the overlap of these issues in this case, the reasoning \n27  set out above and in the class certification order, (ECF No. 82 at 13-14), leads the Court to \nconclude the typicality requirement is satisfied.   \n28 \n \n8 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5759   Page 9 of 14\n \n1  whose children were released from ORR custody prior to June 26, 2018.  On the contrary, \n2  Plaintiffs’ counsel represented to the Court that they stand ready to put together another \n3  steering committee to assist any newly identified class members in the event this motion is \n4  granted.  (ECF No. 364 at 34.)  Under these circumstances, the newly proposed class \n5  satisfies the adequacy requirement.   \n6    In addition to these Rule 23 factors, Defendants raise several other arguments against \n7  modifying the class definition.  First, although Defendants recognize that ascertainability \n8  is not a requirement for class certification, they argue the proposed modification to the \n9  class definition “would make it nearly impossible to ascertain the class with any level of \n10  certainty.”  (Defs.’ Opp’n to Mot. at 5.)  In essence, they assert it would be too burdensome \n11  for them to identify the members of the newly proposed class, therefore the class should \n12  not be modified.   \n13    As an initial matter, the Court notes this is not a valid argument against either class \n14  certification or modification of a previously certified class.  See Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, \n15  Inc., 844 F.3d 1121, 1125-26 (9th Cir.) (rejecting assertion that, in addition to satisfying the \n16  requirements  of  Rule  23,  “class  proponents  must  also  demonstrate  that  there  is  an \n17  administratively feasible way to determine who is in the class.”), cert. denied by ConAgra \n18  Brands, Inc. v. Briseno, ___ U.S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 313 (2017).  This is especially so here, \n19  where the difficulty in identifying proposed class members is the result of Defendants’ own \n20  record keeping practices, or lack thereof.  See Agne v. Papa John’s Int’l, Inc., 286 F.R.D. \n21  559, 566 n.6 (W.D. Wash. 2012) (stating “it would be unfair to deny class certification \n22  because of the potential difficulty of identifying the class members where that difficulty is \n23  mostly due to the fact that [Defendant] destroyed the call lists that it used.”); Raffin v. \n24  Medicredit, Inc., No. 15-4912-GHK (PJWx), 2017 WL 131745, at *6 n.5 (C.D. Cal. Jan. \n25  3, 2017) (stating “courts generally do not bar class certification where the defendant’s own \n26  destruction of records causes difficulty in identifying class members.”)  The argument \n27  holds even less weight here because Plaintiffs are not seeking class certification under Rule \n28  23(b)(3), which calls for consideration of the difficulties in identifying class members as \n9 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5760   Page 10 of 14\n \n1  part of the “superiority” requirement.  See Pierce v. County of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190, \n2  1200 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding no abuse of discretion in denying certification of Rule 23(b)(3) \n3  class  “in  light  of  expected  difficulties  identifying  class  members  and  determining \n4  appropriate damages.”)  Rather, the class in this case is certified under Rule 23(b)(2), which \n5  does not have a similar requirement.    \n6    Furthermore, although the process for identifying newly proposed class members \n7  may be burdensome, it clearly can be done.  Indeed, Jallyn Sualog, who is leading ORR’s \n8  efforts to reunify separated parents and children, has set out the process of identifying these \n9  newly proposed class members.  (See Decl. of Jallyn Sualog in Supp. of Defs.’ Opp’n to \n10  Mot. ¶¶ 13-20.)  Thus, Defendants’ argument of burden does not warrant denial of the \n11  present motion.   \n12    Defendants also suggest it would be more appropriate for the newly proposed class \n13  members to bring individual cases rather than include them in this case.  (ECF No. 364 at \n14  52.)  Like the issue of burden, this argument also goes to the issue of superiority under \n15  Rule 23(b)(3).  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A) (listing as factor for consideration “the class \n16  members’  interests  in  individually  controlling  the  prosecution  or  defense  of  separate \n17  actions[.]”)  Even if this argument applied here, it would weigh in favor of granting the \n18  motion, not denying it.  As the Ninth Circuit stated in Smith v. Los Angeles Unified School \n19  Dist., 830 F.3d 843 (9th Cir. 2016), “[c]ourts have long recognized the benefits conferred \n20  by  the  class  action  mechanism  over  numerous  individual  actions[,]”  (id.  at  863), \n21  particularly in civil rights actions where a government practice or policy is at issue.  \n22  Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 686-87 (9th Cir. 2014) (stating primary purpose of Rule \n23  23(b)(2) “has always been the certification of civil rights class actions.”)  In fact, near the \n24  beginning  of  this  case  when  separate  lawsuits  were  being  filed  across  the  country, \n25  Defendants advocated for consolidation and avoidance of separate actions in multiple fora.  \n26  See, e.g., State of Wash. v. United States, Case No. 18cv1979 DMS (MDD), ECF No. 22 \n27  (Defendants’ motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, to transfer venue to this Court); \n28  / / /  \n10 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5761   Page 11 of 14\n \n1  M.M.M. v. Sessions, Case No. 18cv1832 DMS (MDD), ECF No. 21 at 21 (reflecting \n2  Defendants’ request to transfer case to this Court).   \n3  Now that Defendants have complied with this Court’s preliminary injunction, it \n4  appears they want to reverse course and have these newly identified parents file individual \n5  cases throughout the country.  However, forcing individual parents to bring separate \n6  lawsuits challenging separation from their children makes little sense when precisely that \n7  same legal claim has already been certified for class treatment in this case.  It also ignores \n8  the harsh reality of this case, namely that 471 parents in the presently defined class were \n9  removed from this country without their children.  (ECF No. 382 at 6.)  Unless members \n10  of the newly proposed class are identified, it will remain unknown how many of them, if \n11  any, were also removed without their children, though it is probable that many will have \n12  suffered the same fate as the 471 parents mentioned above.  The ability of any such \n13  removed parents to pursue individual claims in this country would be virtually impossible.   \n14    Defendants also argue the Court should not modify the class definition because this \n15  is not the proper forum in which to account for the parents who were separated from their \n16  children at the border by DOJ and DHS, and whose children were released from ORR \n17  custody prior to June 26, 2018.  (ECF No. 364 at 54.)  Specifically, at the hearing on this \n18  matter, defense counsel argued: “Litigation doesn’t necessarily exist to resolve every issue \n19  ….”  (Id.)  Instead, counsel noted, other branches of government can get to the bottom of \n20  the issue.  (Id. (“The executive branch itself with OIG Reports … is a possibility.”))   \n21    The other branches, of course, are free to investigate these issues, and they are doing \n22  so.  In addition to OIG, Congress has been holding hearings on these issues and issuing \n23  subpoenas to the Defendants in this case.  See, Colleen Long, House Targets Family \n24  Separations  in  First  Trump  Subpoena,  AP  News  (Feb.  26,  2019), \n25  https://www.apnews.com/0b012aaaa6454a10a585eb4a848c8541;  Colleen  Long  et  al., \n26  Kirstjen Nielsen testifies on border security, future of border wall, PBS News (Mar. 6, \n27  2019,  5:17  PM  EST),  https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-homeland-\n28  security-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-testifies-before-house-committee.  Clearly, the matter \n11 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5762   Page 12 of 14\n \n1  of determining the “number and status of separated children” who have entered ORR care \n2  at any point in time because of the Administration’s family separation policy is not going \n3  away.  Every branch of government is now invested in the process.  But that does not mean \n4  the Court should abdicate its role in this matter.  The quintessential duty of the courts is to \n5  determine controversies involving matters of constitutional significance; to ensure that the \n6  actions of government officials do not violate fundamental constitutional rights, and if they \n7  do, to address them.  See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 178 (1803) (stating the \n8  resolution of constitutional questions “is the very essence of judicial duty.”); The Federalist \n9  No. 78 (Alexander Hamilton) (stating it is the “duty” of the courts “to declare all acts \n10  contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void.  Without this, all the reservations \n11  of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.”)   \n12  This Court has before it a case involving a class of parents who were separated from \n13  their children at the border by DOJ and DHS pursuant to government policy.  The present \n14  motion asks the Court to modify the class definition to include all parents who were \n15  subjected to that policy, not just those whose children were in ORR custody on June 26, \n16  2018.  That question clearly falls within the scope of this case, and the Court has an \n17  obligation to resolve that question and to provide relief to these parents, if appropriate \n18  under law.  See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349 (1996) (“It is the role of courts to provide \n19  relief to claimants, in individual or class actions, who have suffered, or will imminently \n20  suffer, actual harm[.]”).   \n21    Defendants’ final argument is essentially one of equity.  Specifically, they argue they \n22  have been operating under the assumption that the class was limited to parents whose \n23  children were in ORR custody on June 26, 2018, and it would be unfair to them to now \n24  enlarge the class and force them to identify and reunify these other parents and their \n25  children.  This argument overlooks the profound importance of the reunification effort, \n26  which entailed a search for parents who had been separated from their minor children under \n27  questionable circumstances; it ensured every reasonable effort was employed to avoid the \n28  very real possibility of a permanently orphaned child due to the actions of one or more \n12 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5763   Page 13 of 14\n \n1  government officials.  Whether it is fair to Defendants to require them to identify and \n2  possibly reunite another group of parents and children who were separated pursuant to the \n3  same government policy is not relevant to the purely legal issue presently before this Court, \n4  i.e., whether the class definition in this case should be modified.  The factors relevant to \n5  that  inquiry  have  been  discussed  above,  and  they  warrant  modification  of  the  class \n6  definition here.   \n7  The hallmark of a civilized society is measured by how it treats its people and those \n8  within its borders.  That Defendants may have to change course and undertake additional \n9  effort to address these issues does not render modification of the class definition unfair; it \n10  only  serves to underscore  the  unquestionable  importance of  the  effort  and  why  it  is \n11  necessary (and worthwhile).   \n12    In sum, that Plaintiffs were alerted to the existence of a handful of parents within \n13  this group, and that subsequent investigation by the OIG confirmed that there was not just \n14  a handful but potentially thousands of parents in this group, does not render modification \n15  of the class definition unfair.  Rather, modification of the class definition falls squarely \n16  within the confines of Supreme Court precedent and Rule 23(c)(1)(C), which give courts \n17  broad discretion to alter or amend a class definition considering subsequent developments \n18  in a case.  See Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, n.28 (9th Cir. 2001) (stating district courts \n19  have “broad discretion” to revisit class certification “throughout the legal proceedings \n20  before the Court.”), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, \n21  504-05 (2005).     \n22    Subsequent developments have occurred  here,  and  the  modified  class,  like  the \n23  original class, satisfies the requirements of Rule 23.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to \n24  modify the class definition is granted.  The previously certified class is modified as follows: \n25  All adult parents who entered the United States at or between designated ports \nof entry on or after July 1, 2017, who (1) have been, are, or will be detained \n26 \nin immigration custody by the DHS, and (2) have a minor child who has been, \n27  is or will be separated from them by DHS and has been, is or will be detained \n28 \n13 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 386   Filed 03/08/19   PageID.5764   Page 14 of 14\n \n1  in ORR custody, ORR foster care, or DHS custody, absent a determination \nthat the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child.6 \n2 \n \n3    Although the parties addressed the issue of the relief to be afforded to the newly \n4  included class members both in their briefs and at oral argument, the Court declines to \n5  resolve that issue in the present order.  Rather, pursuant to Defendants’ request, the Court \n6  stays application of its preliminary injunction to the newly included class members pending \n7  further briefing from the parties as to what specific relief Plaintiffs request and are entitled \n8  to at this stage of the case.  The parties should be prepared to address these issues in the \n9  next JSR.   \n10    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n11  Dated:  March 8, 2019   \n12 \n13 \n \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n                                                \n26 \n27  6  The class as modified is subject to the same qualifications as the originally certified class \nwith respect to, for example, criminal history and communicable disease.

The Ms. L. Settlement Class \nThe “Ms. L. Settlement Class” consists of:  \nA. Current Ms. L. Class Members: All members of the class certified by the Court and \nidentified by the Parties as class members in the course of the litigation. See Order Granting in \nPart Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, ECF No. 82 (June 26, 2018); Order Granting \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Modify Class Definition, ECF No. 386 (Mar. 8, 2019). Prior to Settlement \nApproval  Defendants  shall  provide  Plaintiffs  with  the  list  of  class  members  who  meet the \ndefinition of this paragraph.  \nB.  All Separated Children of Class Members: The Parties will amend the certified class to \ninclude in the Ms. L. Settlement Class any child who was separated from a parent or Legal \nGuardian who is either a Current Ms. L. Class Member or who becomes a member of the Ms. L. \nSettlement Class through the provisions of this Section. \nC.  Certain Children of Parents Excluded from the Class: The Parties also agree that \nDefendants will provide some limited relief as detailed below in Section IV.B.2.a. to children \nwho were separated from their parent or Legal Guardian after January 20, 2017 and prior to June \n26, 2018, and who would otherwise be Ms. L Settlement Class members, but who are excluded \nfrom the class based on the criminal history of their parent or Legal Guardian.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10467   Page 4 of 46\nD. Individuals Falling within the Expanded Date Range: The Parties will amend the \ncertified class to include in the Ms. L. Settlement Class all individuals who otherwise meet the \ndefinitions set forth in this Section, and who were separated from their children at any time \nbetween January 20, 2017 and July 1, 2017. The complete date range of the Ms. L. Settlement \nClass will therefore be January 20, 2017 through January 20, 2021, subject to any limitations \ncontained elsewhere in this Settlement Agreement. \nE.  Legal Guardians: The Parties will amend the certified class to include in the Ms. L. \nSettlement Class, subject to the same parameters for inclusion and exclusion of parents described \nelsewhere in this Section, any individual who can establish that he or she was separated from a \nchild at any time between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, and who can provide official \ndocumentation, including documentation from indigenous or tribal authorities, that the individual \nwas in fact the Legal Guardian of that child, as defined above, at the time of separation under the \nappropriate law.  \n1.  For purposes of establishing legal guardianship, “nunc pro tunc” documents that are \nofficial and verifiable from a competent legal authority that establish that legal guardianship \nexisted at the time of the separation would be acceptable.  \n2.  Generally,  a  birth  certificate  or  legally  amended  birth  certificate  is  accepted  as \npresumptive evidence of parentage. If, for some reason, there is conflicting evidence in the \nrecord of who is the parent, the individual can submit evidence from a competent legal \nauthority  that  establishes  the  individual  was  the  child’s  Legal  Guardian  at  the  time  of \nseparation. \nF.  Parentage.  An adult who was separated from a child on the basis that he or she was \ndetermined not to be the parent of the child will be considered a member of the Ms. L. Settlement \nclass if the adult can show that he or she is, in fact, the parent of the separated child. Where the \nseparation was based on a belief that the adult was not the child’s parent, Defendants will accept \nall available evidence as a means to verify parentage, including consultations with the consulate, \nHHS acknowledgement of a parent-child relationship, and DNA testing.  \n \nG. Families Where the Separated Child is a U.S. Citizen: The parties will amend the \ncertified class to include in the Ms. L. Settlement Class, subject to the same parameters for \ninclusion and exclusion of parents described elsewhere in this Section, parents or Legal Guardians \nwho were separated from their child at any time between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, \nwhere the separated child is a U.S. citizen and therefore was not sent to ORR custody. The Parties \nagree that this Settlement Agreement does not create any obligation on the part of Defendants to \nidentify or notify individuals in any particular manner or timeframe who fall under this subsection \nof the Ms. L. Settlement Class. However, the Defendants agree that they will meet and confer at \nPlaintiffs’ request every three months until the Final Registration Date to evaluate methods by \nwhich Defendants may identify Ms. L. Settlement Class members who fall in this category, and \nthe Defendants agree that when they identify U.S. citizen children who may be Ms. L. Settlement \nClass members, Defendants will provide the name and any contact information in Defendants’ \npossession of such parents, Legal Guardians, and children to Class Counsel under the protective \norder.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10468   Page 5 of 46\nH. Separations Where the Noncitizen Child Was Not Sent to ORR: With the exception of \ncases where the child was a U.S. citizen and therefore could not be sent to ORR, there is a \npresumption that if a parent or Legal Guardian and child entered CBP custody together, and the \nchild was never sent to ORR custody, then the parent or Legal Guardian and his or her child are \nnot class members. However, if a parent or Legal Guardian and noncitizen child entered CBP \ncustody together and the parent or Legal Guardian and noncitizen child were separated, and the \nparent or Legal Guardian was referred for prosecution under 8 U.S.C. § 1325 or 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) \nafter January 20, 2017, and on or before June 26, 2018, then the parent or Legal Guardian and \nnoncitizen child will be considered class members for the purposes of this Settlement Agreement, \neven if the parent or Legal Guardian and noncitizen child were reunified before leaving CBP \ncustody. Any such inclusion determination will be subject to the other provisions of this Section. \nI.  Individuals Separated for Medical Reasons, Because of an Active Warrant, or Due to \nConcerns about Fitness or Dangerousness: The Parties agree that, in the following situations, \nthe separation of a parent or Legal Guardian and child after January 20, 2017 and before January \n20, 2021, may have been appropriate under the terms of the Court’s preliminary injunction:  \n1.  medical reasons that required outside care; \n2.  mental health concerns that required placement on suicide watch;  \n3.  transfer to criminal custody based on an active warrant and confirmation from the \nissuing jurisdiction that the parent or Legal Guardian would be extradited; and \n4.  objective reasons to be concerned that the parent or Legal Guardian may have been \nunfit or posed a danger to the child. \nIn all of the cases identified in Sections II.I.1 through II.I.4 above, the government was obliged to \nreunify a parent or Legal Guardian and child if and when the basis for separation was resolved. In \nrecognition of the fact that the Court’s preliminary injunction required that such reunifications \noccur in an expedited fashion, the Parties agree that individuals separated for the reasons above \nwill be eligible for the relief available to the Ms. L. Settlement Class under the following \nconditions:  \n•  Any parent or Legal Guardian and child separated for the reasons identified in Sections \nII.I.1 through II.I.4  after January 20, 2017, and on or before June 26, 2018, will be included \nin the Ms. L. Settlement Class unless the parent or Legal Guardian would otherwise be \nexcluded from the class on the basis of his or her criminal history as described in Section \nII.J. \n•  Any parent or Legal Guardian and child separated after June 26, 2018, and before \nJanuary  20,  2021,  for  the  reasons  identified  in  Sections  II.II.1  through  II.I.3,  will \npresumptively remain excluded from the Ms. L Settlement Class. However, a parent or \nLegal Guardian identified in Sections II.I.1 through II.I.3 who does not have a criminal \nhistory that would exclude him or her from the Ms. L. Settlement Class may establish a \nright to be included in the Ms. L. Settlement Class if he or she can show that when the \nmedical reason that required outside care of the parent or Legal Guardian had ended, or \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10469   Page 6 of 46\nwhen the parent or Legal Guardian was released from criminal custody, he or she was not \nreunified in accordance with the “streamlined” procedures identified by the Court that \nprovided for reunification upon a determination that: (1) he or she was the parent or Legal \nGuardian of the child; and (2) there was no information that raised a concern about the \nwelfare of the child. See ECF No. 101 at 2-3. \n•  Any parent or Legal Guardian who was separated from his or her child after June 26, \n2018  and  before  January  20,  2021  for  the  reasons  identified  in  Section  II.I.4  will \npresumptively be included in the Ms. L Settlement Class unless (a) the parent or Legal \nGuardian would otherwise be excluded from the class on the basis of his or her criminal \nhistory as described in Section II.J, or (b) the government provides evidence that the parent \nor Legal Guardian and child were promptly reunified immediately after any and all \nobjective reasons to be concerned that the parent or Legal Guardian may have been unfit \nor posed a danger to the child were favorably resolved. \nJ.  Exclusions for Criminal History: The Parties agree that those with the following criminal \nconvictions at the time of the separation, or whose separation was the result of a prosecution and \nsubsequent conviction for one of the following criminal convictions (excluding a separation as a \nresult of a prosecution and subsequent conviction for a violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325 or § 1326(a)), \nshall presumptively not be Ms. L. Settlement Class members, and that this presumption will be \nevaluated, on a case-by-case basis, and may be rebutted according to the process laid out below \nand in Section III. \n1.  Persons with one or more felony criminal conviction(s) in the United States, other than \na single conviction for a felony violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325 or § 1326(a);  \n \n2.  Persons with one or more conviction(s) in the United States or an analogous conviction \nabroad for: \n \na.  a crime involving sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor, as defined in Application \nNote 1 of § 2G2.2 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and also including trafficking \nin, or possession of, child pornography; or \n \nb.  a crime involving prohibited sexual conduct, as defined in Application Note 1 of § \n2A3.1 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, provided, however, that it shall not be a \nbasis for exclusion if:  \n \ni.  the crime arose from the fact that the person engaged in prostitution, or loitering \nfor prostitution: or \nii.  if convicted in the United States, the person served a sentence of six months or \nless of incarceration; or  \niii.  if convicted in a foreign country, the offense carried a penalty of six months or \nless of incarceration; or \n \nc.  a crime of domestic violence, stalking, and child abuse, as defined in 8 U.S.C. § \n1227(a)(2)(E)(i);  \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10470   Page 7 of 46\nor:  \n3.  Persons with a felony criminal conviction(s) in a foreign country where the conviction \nwas for a crime analogous to a crime enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3559(c)(2)(F) or \n(c)(2)(H). \n“Conviction” means a final judgment of conviction by a criminal court as governed by the \njurisdiction of conviction’s criminal laws. It does not include, for example, dispositions that are \nvacated, expunged, pardoned, or dismissed upon completion of rehabilitative programs. The FRTF \nResearch Committee may examine deferred or withheld adjudications to ascertain whether such \nadjudications resulted in a conviction as of the time of separation. Class Counsel may provide the \nFRTF Research Committee with any information available to Class Counsel indicating that a \nconviction is not a final judgment of conviction at the time of separation. \nAs part of the process set forth in Section III below, the FRTF Research Committee will \nevaluate whether an individual has rebutted the presumption that he or she is not a member of the \nMs. L. Settlement Class despite his or her convictions at the time of separation for an offense set \nforth above. The FRTF Research Committee will review the information provided by Class \nCounsel, as well as the record of criminal convictions at the time of separation, to make this \ndetermination. In its use of any foreign databases, the FRTF Research Committee shall consider \nonly convictions for offenses described in subsections II.J.2 and II.J.3 above. Where the FRTF \nResearch Committee considers information from foreign databases it shall, as in all cases, also \nconsider any countervailing information provided on the individual’s behalf.  \nTo make case-by-case determinations of class membership for individuals presumed not to \nbe Ms. L. Settlement Class members because of criminal convictions described in Sections II.J.1 \nthrough  II.J.3  above,  the  FRTF  Research  Committee  will  be  guided  by  the  following \nconsiderations: \n•  Whether the criminal conviction(s) demonstrate a threat to national security or public \nsafety.  Factors that point to a public safety threat, or to the absence of such a threat, include \nwhether the conduct at issue poses a danger of violence toward, or abuse or exploitation \nof, others; the number of criminal convictions; the length of time since the offense date of \nthe most recent criminal conviction that falls within subsections II.J.1-3 above, at the time \nof the separation; and the nature of the injury to another resulting from the conduct related \nto the conviction(s), and  \n•  The seriousness of the criminal conviction(s).  \nInformation presented by Class Counsel and other mitigating information will also be \nconsidered in the review, including any explanation of or justification for the criminal activity \n(e.g., issues related to poverty, self-defense, or persecution of the individual by authorities), the \nage and maturity of the individual at the time of the conviction, evidence of rehabilitation, \nhumanitarian factors about the individual or their family, and other relevant information about the \nindividual’s circumstances. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10471   Page 8 of 46\nIII. Procedure for Determining Membership in the Ms. L. Settlement Class  \nThis  procedure  will  be  used  to resolve  all  issues  regarding  inclusion  in  the  Ms.  L. \nSettlement Class, including the submission of any documentation necessary for resolving such \ndisputes. Parents or Legal Guardians who were separated from their child(ren) at the U.S.-Mexico \nborder between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, may seek inclusion in the Ms. L. \nSettlement Class and/or seek certain benefits available to the Ms. L. Settlement Class by presenting \ntheir information to the FRTF via the website together.gov or juntos.gov. By registering on the \nwebsite, registrants are identifying themselves as current or potential class members. In order to \nbe considered for relief under this Settlement Agreement, all potential Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers  must  register  via  the  website  together.gov  or  juntos.gov  no  later  than  the  Final \nRegistration Date. \nIf the individual has not already been included in the Ms. L. Settlement Class, the FRTF \nResearch  Committee  will  review  the  information  a  registrant  provides  to  together.gov  or \njuntos.gov, as well as DHS databases and National Criminal Information Center holdings, to \ndetermine if the individual is a member of the Ms. L. Settlement Class.    \nIf the individual is not determined to be a member of the Ms. L. Settlement Class, including \nbecause of the individual’s criminal history, Class Counsel and the individual will be notified of \nthat fact by the FRTF Research Committee within 20 business days of registration on together.gov \nor juntos.gov. The written notification will explain the FRTF Research Committee’s determination \nand include information and a copy of any document(s) that support the basis for the FRTF \nResearch Committee’s determination that the individual does not appear to be a presumptive \nmember of the Ms. L. Settlement Class. If the FRTF Research Committee is legally prohibited \nfrom sharing a copy of the document(s), or if national security concerns would prohibit disclosure, \nthen a summary of those documents shall suffice, as appropriate.  Class Counsel will then have 60 \nbusiness days to provide the FRTF Research Committee information to guide its case-by-case \nreview; this 60-day period may be extended for up to 90 additional business days when Class \nCounsel notifies the FRTF Research Committee that such additional time is required.  The FRTF \nResearch Committee will then review the additional information provided by the Class Counsel \nand issue a decision as soon as practicable but not later than within 45 business days.   \nThe FRTF Research Committee will promptly notify Class Counsel of the results of its \ncase-by-case review.  If the FRTF Research Committee determines that the individual should be \npart of the Ms. L. Settlement Class, the individual will be added to the list of Ms. L. Settlement \nClass members.  If the FRTF Research Committee determines that the individual should not be \npart of the Ms. L. Settlement Class after reviewing the additional information, Class Counsel may \nappeal that decision to an independent adjudicator within thirty days of the FRTF Research \nCommittee’s decision. Class Counsel may seek one extension of the appeal deadline for up to 30 \ndays, which shall be granted sparingly based on a showing of good cause at the discretion of the \nindependent  adjudicator.  The  parties  will  identify,  agree  to,  and  stipulate  to  the  Court  for \nappointment of an individual to serve as independent adjudicator. The independent adjudicator \nwill review the FRTF Research Committee’s decision, government documents the adjudicator \ndeems relevant, and any submissions by Class  Counsel, to determine de novo whether the \npreponderance of evidence supports the determination.  The independent adjudicator will issue an \norder as to who pays the costs for any adjudication brought to him or her. Costs generally will be \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10472   Page 9 of 46\npaid by the losing party unless the independent adjudicator determines that the appeal, though \nunsuccessful, was reasonable and based on non-frivolous claims of error. \n  \nIV. Relief Available to the Ms. L. Settlement Class  \nA. Opportunity to Reunify for Ms. L. Settlement Class Members \nDefendants will establish processes to provide the opportunity for all Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers to be able to reunify with their separated parent, Legal Guardian, or child. Defendants \nwill also provide a process by which Qualifying Additional Family Members can similarly be \nprovided an opportunity to live with the reunified parent or Legal Guardian and child in the United \nStates. Defendants will return to the United States Ms. L. Settlement Class members and certain \nQualifying Additional Family Members that the  FRTF Research Committee determines are \nnecessary for reunification at the government’s expense, including the costs of travel and related \nsupport, to include travel support that is necessary to facilitate return and reunification. These \nprocesses are set forth in Section IV.C.1. of the Settlement Agreement. \n \nB.  Support for Ms. L. Settlement Class Members Inside the United States \n1.  The government will provide support and services to Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers already in the United States, or who have returned to the United States, as detailed \nbelow. The Parties agree that this support and services are necessary to facilitate successful \nreunifications and/or to prevent any ongoing harm caused by the initial separation. All services \nprovided to Ms. L. Settlement Class members under this Section must begin no later than the \nFinal Services Date. \n \n2.  To facilitate the provision of the below support and services, the government will, \nconsistent with applicable contract and grant requirements, expeditiously contract with, or \nenter into grants with, a third-party to provide benefit administration services for the housing \nbenefits and will provide information to Ms. L. Settlement Class members concerning how to \naccess the behavioral health and legal services described below. The provision of these services \nand benefits are subject to the availability of federal appropriations. The federal defendants \nmay enter into an Economy Act Agreement among themselves under which one agency may \naward  grants  on  their  behalf  to  carry  out  the  services  provided  under  this  Settlement \nAgreement. The government shall inform Class Counsel of the name of the selected contractor \nor grantee(s). A government contractor or grantee(s) will establish contact with the Ms. L. \nSettlement Class members to inform them of these services. \n \na.  Behavioral Health Services: To facilitate the successful reunification of families \nand/or prevent ongoing harm caused by the initial separation of Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers, Defendants will make behavioral health services available to Ms. L. Settlement \nClass members from the Effective Date until one year after the Termination Date. In \naddition, HHS may, at its discretion, allow its contractor to extend behavioral health \nservices to other immediate family members of class members if HHS determines that \nproviding such services will assist class members in their successful reunification. Any \nindividual Ms. L. Settlement Class member will be eligible to receive up to three years of \nsuch services. This is the only form of relief that will be available to separated children \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10473   Page 10 of\n46\ndefined in Section II.C. above, who are members of the Ms. L. Settlement Class but whose \nparents or Legal Guardians are excluded from the Ms. L. Settlement Class on the basis of \ntheir criminal history. The behavioral health services to be provided under this provision \nof the Settlement Agreement include a continuation of the same child-centered pre-\nreunification counseling, clinical treatment services, behavioral health case management, \npsychoeducation, and parenting support that are being provided under an existing contract.  \n \nb.  Assistance with Certain Medical Costs: To support the successful reunification of \nMs. L. Settlement Class member families who have returned and are returning to the United \nStates  for  reunification,  Defendants  will  make  assistance  available  in  paying  the \ncopayments incurred by Ms. L. Settlement Class members when receiving medical services \nat Federally Qualified Health Centers during a 12-month eligibility period.   \n \n•  Ms. L. Settlement Class members in the United States who are registered in \ntogether.gov and confirmed as Ms. L. Settlement Class members as of the Effective \nDate have 12 months from the Effective Date to initiate their 12-month eligibility \nperiod; \n \n•  Ms. L. Settlement Class members in the United States who are not registered \nin together.gov or confirmed as Ms. L. Settlement Class members as of the \nEffective Date have 12 months from their Settlement Class Member Confirmation \nDate to initiate their 12-month eligibility period; and \n \n•  Ms. L. Settlement Class members not in the United States at the time of the \nsettlement would be notified of the availability of the copayment assistance upon \nreceiving confirmation that they are a Ms. L. Settlement Class member, and would \nhave 12 months from the date they arrive in the United States to initiate their 12-\nmonth eligibility period.  \n \nc.  Immigration Legal Services: Defendants, with EOIR, will provide legal access and \norientation as detailed below to specifically focus on Ms. L. Settlement Class members. \nThe services will include: \n \ni.  Legal Access Services for Reunified Families  \n \n(a) In  addition  to  the  group  information  sessions,  individual  information \nsessions, and self-help workshops that EOIR’s Immigration Court Helpdesk \nProgram (ICH) currently offers, EOIR, through ICH or a separate similar \nprogram (“Program”), shall also provide assistance to Ms. L. Settlement \nClass members, short of full representation, including:  \n•  legal advice, such as individualized consultations and counseling about \nrelief for which Ms. L. Settlement Class members may be eligible, and \nthe steps necessary to apply for such relief, as well as preparation for \nany interviews before USCIS;  \n•  assistance  with  document  preparation,  including  preparing \nimmigration-related legal documents for submission to DHS (including \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10474   Page 11 of\n46\nUSCIS), and EOIR pursuant to EOIR’s limited appearance regulations; \nand  \n•  Friend of the Court services, where allowed by the immigration court, \nto  facilitate  the  flow  of  information  in  the  courtroom,  including \ninforming  noncitizens  of  their  rights  and  obligations  and  calling \nattention to law or facts that may be helpful to the immigration court. \nWhere permitted by the immigration court, EOIR will facilitate remote \nor in-person access for Friend of Court services as appropriate given \nlanguage needs or location of the participating family and legal services \nprovider.  \n•  The Program shall also provide transportation stipends for in-person \nlegal services court appearance for families for whom remote services \nare inappropriate given language needs or disability.  \n•  EOIR will provide trauma-informed interpretation for Ms. L. Settlement \nClass members receiving Program services. \n•  This Program will be available through at least eight regional offices. \n \n(b) The Program will ensure that, in addition to providing the services listed \nabove at existing ICH locations, and in person where possible, the Program \nwill provide these services via remote technology to Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers who (1) live outside the ICH’s geographic regions, or (2) are \notherwise unable to obtain ICH services.  \n \n(c) The  Program  will  create  new  resources  and  orientation  presentations \ntailored to address the particular needs of Ms. L. Settlement Class members. \nThe orientations will address, at a minimum, the immigration court process, \nany forms of relief that may allow the families to remain in the United \nStates, and questions about family reunification and humanitarian parole. \nThe  Program  will  also  develop  written  materials  as  resources  for  the \nfamilies, to include self-help guides, videos, and more. The Program will \noffer additional tailored pro se workshops to assist Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers prepare any applications for relief, as needed, and will create \nguidance  documents  to  explain  any  changes  in  the  law  or  settlement \nprocesses that may impact Ms. L. Settlement Class members. The materials \nwill be offered in the best language of the Ms. L. Settlement Class member. \n \n(d) Defendants will ensure that the Program is adequately resourced and funded \nto provide services for all unrepresented Ms. L. Settlement Class members, \nwith the ability to increase funding to meet projected needs as determined \nby Defendants, taking into account information about needs provided by \nPlaintiffs. EOIR will not decrease funding for its current legal access \nprograms (ICH, LOPC, LOP, CCI/NQRP) in order to fund legal services \nunder this Settlement. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10475   Page 12 of\n46\n \nii.  Program to Place Cases with Pro Bono Representatives  \n \n(a) EOIR cannot ensure that it can find a pro bono representative for every \nfamily. However, the Program will leverage its existing pro bono referral \nefforts, and provide additional funding, to recruit, train, mentor, and match \npro bono attorneys to represent Ms. L. Settlement Class members. EOIR \nwill facilitate Model Hearing Programs in connection with provider training \nfor new pro bono representatives, where available. \n \n(b) The Program would identify cases for pro bono placement through in-depth \nindividualized consultations of Ms. L. Settlement Class members. These \ncases would then be placed on an online pro bono platform to help match \npotential pro bono representatives with reunified families. The Program will \nprovide pro bono attorneys with mentors to advise and consult with them \nthroughout the case. \n \n(c) All pro bono attorneys to whom Ms. L. Settlement Class members are \nreferred  through  EOIR  will  be  notified  that  pro  bono  psychological \nevaluations will be made available through the existing HHS behavioral \nhealth contract with Seneca Family of Agencies. \n \n(d) The Program will create a library of written and recorded training materials \nto help pro bono attorneys and legal service providers to best assist Ms. L. \nSettlement  Class  members.  The  trainings  will  cover  substantive  and \nprocedural immigration law issues, education on working with vulnerable \npopulations,  trauma-informed  care,  and  child  protection.  Additionally, \nwebinars/video  trainings  will  also  be  provided  on  immigration-related \ntopics to help with effective representation. \n \niii.  Assistance Outside EOIR Proceedings \n \n(a) To ensure Ms. L. Settlement Class members have the ability to reunify \nthrough  the  process  set  out  in  Section  IV.C.1,  and  as  part  of  the \ngovernmental  assistance  to  Qualifying  Additional  Family  Members  in \nSection IV.C.1., Defendants will continue to contract with an independent \ncontractor to communicate with Ms. L. Settlement Class members and assist \nMs.  L.  Settlement  Class  members  and  Qualifying  Additional  Family \nMembers  with  necessary  parole  and  employment  authorization \napplications.  \n \n(b) Defendants will, under the Protective Order, ensure that contact information \nof Ms. L. Settlement Class members is provided to the contractor, and \nestablish links between the contractor and other organizations that work \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10476   Page 13 of\n46\nwith, or have potential access to, Ms. L. Settlement Class members to \nfacilitate referrals to the Program.  This would include a call center (e.g., \n‘hotline’ or telephonic help desk) that will conduct affirmative outreach to \nidentify and screen people and refer them to services.  \n \n(c) The contractor will be authorized to coordinate with Class Counsel and the \ndesignated provider organization to ensure that Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers and Qualifying Additional Family Members are aware of legal \nservices, to maintain continuity of services, and to assist where necessary to \nensure reunification. \nd.  Housing Support: To support the successful reunification of families who have \nreturned and are returning to the United States for reunification, Defendants will make \nhousing assistance available to Ms. L. Settlement Class members in meeting housing needs, \nas determined necessary by a benefits administration contractor or grantee during a 12-\nmonth eligibility period. This may include assistance in locating housing; paying costs \nnecessary to attain housing, e.g., security deposit and first and last month’s rent; and \nassistance to avoid eviction and meet other emergency housing needs during the 12-month \neligibility period. Payments would typically be made to landlords and not in the form of \ncash to the Ms. L. Settlement Class member, and would be for no more than a total of 6 \nmonths during the 12-month eligibility period absent extraordinary circumstances.   \ni.  If the housing assistance is available as of the Effective Date: \n \n(a) Ms. L. Settlement Class members in the United States who are registered in \ntogether.gov and confirmed to be a Ms. L. Settlement Class member as of \nthe Effective Date would have 12 months from the Effective Date to initiate \ntheir 12-month eligibility period; \n(b) Ms. L. Settlement Class members in the United States who are not registered \nin together.gov or not yet confirmed as a Ms. L. Settlement Class member \nas of the Effective Date would have 12 months after their Settlement Class \nMember Confirmation Date to initiate their 12-month eligibility period; and \n(c) Ms. L. Settlement Class members not in the United States at the time of the \nEffective Date would be notified of the availability of the housing assistance \nupon  receiving  confirmation  that  they  are  a  Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class \nmember, and would have 12 months from their arrival in the United States \nto initiate their 12-month eligibility period. \n \nii.  If the housing assistance becomes available after the Effective Date, then a Ms. \nL. Settlement Class member will have one year from the date that all three of \nthe following conditions are met to initiate their eligibility period: (1) the Ms. \nL. Settlement Class member is inside the United States; (2) he or she is \nconfirmed to be a Ms. L. Settlement Class member; and (3) he or she is notified \nof the availability of the housing assistance benefit. \n \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10477   Page 14 of\n46\nC.  Immigration Processing \n1.  Thirty-six months of Parole and Employment Authorization  \n \nCertain Ms. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members, as \ndefined in Section I.L., will have the opportunity to apply for parole pursuant to section 212(d)(5) \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) with USCIS. This opportunity will extend to Ms. L. \nSettlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members who are not currently in \nthe United States, as well as those present in the United States who upon their last entry were not \nadmitted. Ms. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members who are \nin removal proceedings, or who have a final order of removal or an order granting voluntary \ndeparture, can apply for parole with USCIS under this process. Parole for individuals already \npresent in the United States is sometimes referred to as “parole in place” (“PIP”).  Parole \napplications will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis and approval of the request for parole is \nnot guaranteed based on this Settlement Agreement. DHS retains its existing discretion to grant or \ndeny applications for parole, as well as its existing discretion to grant or deny parole at the time of \ninspection at a port of entry. \n \nMs. L. Settlement Class members who wish to request parole under this process must \nregister on together.gov or juntos.gov. They may then file a parole application with USCIS on \nForm  I-131,  Application  for  Travel  Document,3  following  the  instructions  set  forth  in  the \napplicable FRTF Parole Filing Guidelines.4 Ms. L. Settlement Class members will not be required \nto submit proof of financial support with their parole requests. \n \nIndividuals  seeking  parole  as  Qualifying  Additional  Family  Members  must  submit \nevidence of the familial relationship with, or membership in the immediate household of, a Ms. L. \nSettlement Class member, and an urgent humanitarian reason for consideration for parole. The \nQualifying Additional Family Members must also follow the FRTF Parole Filing Guides. If the \nQualifying Additional Family Member lives in the same country as the Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmember, the parole requests must be filed at the same time as the request of the Ms. L. Settlement \nClass member, absent exceptional circumstances.  If the Qualifying Additional Family Member is \nliving in a different country from the Ms. L. Settlement Class member, they may file at different \ntimes, although concurrent filing is preferred.    \n \nUSCIS will exempt the filing fee for the Form I-131, Application for Travel Document \n(parole application), for all Ms. L. Settlement Class members’ and Qualifying Additional Family \nMembers’ parole requests submitted in compliance with the FRTF Parole Filing Guides. Requests \nfor parole will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis and parole is not guaranteed based on this \nSettlement Agreement. For evidentiary support, USCIS will accept and consider any relevant \n \n3   This includes successor versions of Form I-131. \n4  “Guide for Completing a Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, and Filing an Initial \nParole  Request  under  the  Family  Reunification  Task  Force  (FRTF)  Process  on  behalf  of \nIndividuals Outside the United States” or the “Guide for Completing a Form I-131, Application \nfor Travel Document, and Filing an Initial Parole-in-Place (PIP) Request under the Family \nReunification Task Force (FRTF) Process” or their replacements (collectively, FRTF Parole Filing \nGuides).  \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10478   Page 15 of\n46\ncredible evidence, including a declaration from the applicant or the applicant’s family member, or \nany other individual with direct personal knowledge of the relevant facts or circumstances of the \nqualifying relationship.  \n \nIf the parole request is approved, USCIS will issue a travel document authorizing parole \nfor a period of 36 months from the date the individual is paroled at the port of entry (for individuals \noutside the United States) or a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record valid for 36 months from the \ndate parole is approved (for requests for parole in place). CBP has final authority to grant parole \nat the port of entry. The Ms. L. Settlement Class member or Qualifying Additional Family Member \nmay apply for employment authorization pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(11) once he or she is \nparoled into the United States. An initial Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization \n(EAD application), will be accepted and adjudicated without a fee or a fee waiver required and, if \napproved, the time frame for employment authorization will align with the duration of parole.  \n \nMs. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members who are in \nremoval proceedings pursuant to Section 240 of the INA will not be required to obtain dismissal, \ntermination,  administrative  closure,  or  continuances  of  their  removal  proceedings  before \nrequesting parole from USCIS.   \n \nThe government’s preference is that Ms. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying \nAdditional Family Members in the United States, who receive parole from USCIS as described in \nthis section and are in INA § 240 removal proceedings or withholding-only proceedings before an \nImmigration Judge request, by contacting the applicable ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor \n(ICE OPLA) field location, that DHS agree to the filing of a joint motion to dismiss their removal \nproceedings without prejudice, or alternatively, to not oppose a motion for administrative closure \nof their removal proceedings, where permitted by law, with the immigration court. DHS will \nreview such requests on a case-by-case basis, including whether dismissal or administrative \nclosure of the case is warranted as a matter of prosecutorial discretion. DHS will consider \nmembership in the Ms. L. Settlement Class, designation as a Qualifying Additional Family \nMember, and the grant of parole, as factors in determining whether to exercise prosecutorial \ndiscretion. DHS’s agreement or non-opposition to the filing of such motions will also be contingent \non the Ms. L. Settlement Class member or Qualifying Additional Family Member being neither \npotentially subject to nor been found to be subject to a statutory bar to asylum pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v), INA § 208(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v). An immigration judge’s grant of a joint motion \nto dismiss or terminate removal proceedings shall not reflect an adjudication on the merits of the \nMs. L. Settlement Class member’s or Qualifying Additional Family Member’s removability. In \ncases in which a Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s or Qualifying Additional Family Member’s \nINA § 240 removal proceedings have been administratively closed pursuant to this Settlement \nAgreement, either party may move to recalendar those proceedings through the filing of a motion \nto recalendar with  the immigration court.  Ms. L. Settlement Class members’ or Qualifying \nAdditional Family Members’ receipt of parole shall not be conditioned on their taking any action \nto delay or dismiss their pending INA § 240 removal proceedings.  The FRTF will communicate \nthe A-numbers of individuals approved for parole to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations \n(ERO) and ICE OPLA to ensure those DHS components remain fully informed.     \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10479   Page 16 of\n46\nMs. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members who are in \nINA § 240 removal proceedings, or are in expedited removal proceedings, or are in withholding \nonly proceedings, or have an expedited removal order with a pending credible fear interview (CFI), \nor have a reinstated order of removal with a pending reasonable fear interview (RFI), may request \nparole from USCIS under this Section; however, certain procedural steps must occur depending \non the proceeding.  \n \nFor Ms. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members in INA \n§ 240 removal proceedings or withholding-only proceedings before an immigration judge: \n \na.  If USCIS denies the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s or Qualifying Additional \nFamily Member’s parole application, and the individual’s INA § 240 or withholding-only \nproceedings  have  not  been  terminated,  dismissed,  or  administratively  closed,  the \nproceedings will move forward until completion. If INA § 240 removal proceedings or \nwithholding-only proceedings were administratively closed, DHS may move to recalendar \nthe case. \n \nb.  If USCIS approves the parole application and the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s \nor Qualifying Additional Family Member’s INA § 240 removal proceedings have not been \nadministratively closed, the individual may submit a request to ICE OPLA that it agree to \nthe filing of a joint motion to dismiss, or not oppose a motion to administratively close his \nor her proceedings.  The request must be submitted on or before one year after USCIS \napproves the parole application. This request deadline does not abrogate or shorten any \npotentially applicable deadlines set forth in Section IV.C.3., infra. The request must also \ncontain, at minimum, evidence that the individual is a Ms. L. Settlement Class member or \nQualifying Additional Family Member, including but not limited to USCIS’ grant of \nparole, and the authorized period of parole must not have expired or been terminated. DHS \nwill review properly submitted requests on a case-by-case basis within 90 days of the next \nscheduled hearing, or as soon as practicable if no hearing is scheduled, and agree to the \nfiling of a joint motion for dismissal without prejudice or to not oppose a motion for \nadministrative closure if DHS determines that such action is appropriate as a matter of \nprosecutorial discretion. DHS will consider membership in the Ms. L. Settlement Class and \nthe grant of parole as factors in determining whether to exercise prosecutorial discretion. \nDHS’s agreement to the filing of such motions will also be contingent on the Ms. L. \nSettlement  Class  member  or  Qualifying  Additional  Family  Member  being  neither \npotentially subject to nor been found to be subject to a statutory bar to asylum pursuant to \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v), INA § 208(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v) due to information unknown to \nUSCIS at the time of adjudication or actions since the individual was granted parole by \nUSCIS.  The immigration judge’s grant of a joint motion to dismiss or terminate shall not \nreflect an adjudication on the merits of the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s or Qualifying \nAdditional Family Member’s removability. \n \nMs. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members in INA § \n240 removal proceedings or withholding-only proceedings before an immigration judge who have \nproperly filed a parole request with USCIS and were issued a Form I-797, Notice of Action, \nreflecting USCIS receipt of their Form I-131 and a copy of their properly filed Form I-131, may \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10480   Page 17 of\n46\nsubmit a request to the applicable ICE OPLA field location for DHS to join or not oppose a motion \nfor a continuance of the proceeding at any time but no later than one  year after USCIS issues the \nForm I-797. DHS will review the request on a case-by-case basis, including whether a continuance \nis warranted as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, within 90 days of the scheduled hearing. DHS \nwill also respond to any inquiries by the FRTF regarding its review of or decision on the motion \nfor a continuance. ICE OPLA will consider membership in the Ms. L. Settlement Class and \ndesignation as a Qualifying Additional Family Member as factors in determining whether to \nexercise prosecutorial discretion.  \n \nFor Ms. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members who \nhave expedited removal or reinstatement orders, are in expedited removal proceedings with a \npending CFI, or have a reinstated order of removal with a pending RFI: \n \na.  The expedited removal order or reinstated order does not need to be cancelled in \norder to request parole.   \n \nb.  The underlying expedited removal order or reinstated order cannot be executed \nbecause of the pending CFI or RFI.   \n \nc.  USCIS may authorize a new parole period through this process if the individual \nwas previously paroled by ICE or CBP for purposes of a CFI or RFI.  \n \nMs. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members who have \nfinal orders of removal received in INA § 240 proceedings, and/or who have pending motions to \nreopen and petitions for review of such orders, may request parole in place without requesting \nreopening of the final removal order. \n \nMs. L. Settlement Class members with an Unfiled NTA, may request parole under this \nSection.  \n \nWhen considering whether to approve a request for parole by a Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmember or a Qualifying Additional Family Member with prior conditions of release imposed by \nICE or CBP, USCIS may consult with ICE or CBP regarding whether CBP or ICE intend to lift or \nmodify the prior conditions of release following a USCIS parole approval. Decisions on conditions \nof release from custody are discretionary and this agreement does not guarantee that DHS will \nagree to lift or modify such conditions. \n \nMs. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional Family Members who are in \nthe United States may request additional parole periods (i.e., re-parole) with USCIS prior to the \nexpiration of their authorized parole period and prior to the Termination Date if there is a continued \nneed to promote family well-being and unity or to continue behavioral health services under this \nSettlement Agreement.  This showing of continued need may be based on the same or similar \nevidence that supported the initial application but must demonstrate that the need is ongoing. If \napproved for re-parole, the authorized period of parole will be for the period needed to achieve the \nstated purpose, up to an additional thirty-six months. Ms. L. Settlement Class members and \nQualifying Additional Family Members requesting re-parole will not be required to pay the parole \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10481   Page 18 of\n46\napplication fee.  Requests for re-parole will be determined on a case-by-case basis and parole is \nnot guaranteed based on this Settlement Agreement. If the Ms. L. Settlement Class member or \nQualifying Additional Family Member’s re-parole request is approved, the applicant may apply \nfor employment authorization pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(11) to align with the period of re-\nparole. USCIS will also exempt the filing fee for one Form I-765 renewal application for \nemployment authorization, with no fee waiver application required, based on a period of re-parole \ngranted under this settlement for Ms. L. Settlement Class members and Qualifying Additional \nFamily Members.  \nIn cases where Ms. L. Settlement Class members’ and Qualifying Additional Family \nMembers’ parole applications pursuant to this Settlement Agreement are denied by USCIS, USCIS \nwill not use the denial of the parole application as the sole basis for referring the case for any \nenforcement action or issuance of an NTA. In all cases, USCIS will exercise its discretion on a \ncase-by-case basis to determine whether issuance of an NTA or referral for enforcement action is \nnecessary, weighing all aggravating and mitigating factors, including the harm caused by family \nseparation.  \n2.  Further Immigration Relief  \n \nDHS will create a single dedicated email inbox overseen by the Family Reunification Task \nForce, where certain immigration related requests can be sent, unless otherwise noted in the \nSettlement Agreement or in filing instructions provided by DHS. \n \na.  Procedures for Ms. L. Settlement Class Members in the United States to Apply for \nAsylum with USCIS  \n \nThe government will provide the opportunity for Ms. L. Settlement Class members who \nare in the United States to file affirmative asylum applications with USCIS and have those \napplications adjudicated or have preexisting affirmative asylum applications already filed with \nUSCIS adjudicated, according to the following terms.  USCIS will provide filing instructions for \nMs. L. Settlement Class members consistent with the terms of this Settlement Agreement. Ms. L. \nSettlement Class members must comply with any such filing guidance and other procedures \nprovided by USCIS. Asylum applications will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis and approval \nof the application is not guaranteed based on this Settlement Agreement. USCIS retains its \ndiscretion to grant, deny, dismiss, or refer applications to EOIR under 8 U.S.C. § 1158, INA § 208; \n8 C.F.R. § 208.14. \n \nAll properly filed and complete asylum applications filed by Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers with USCIS on or before the deadlines specified in Section IV.C.3., shall qualify for an \nextraordinary circumstances exception under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D), INA § 208(a)(2)(D); 8 \nC.F.R. §§ 208.4(a)(5), 1208.4(a)(5) and will be found to have been filed within a reasonable period \ngiven the circumstances under 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.4(a)(5), 1208.4(a)(5) for purposes of the statutory \none-year filing deadline requirement under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), INA § 208(a)(2)(B). The \ndate USCIS receives the properly filed and complete asylum application is considered the date the \nasylum application is filed. 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(2)(ii). \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10482   Page 19 of\n46\nMs. L. Settlement Class members may submit written requests for expedited processing of \ntheir asylum applications to the asylum office with jurisdiction over their asylum application, \nconsistent  with  the  guidance  for  making  expedite  requests  for  an  asylum  application  at \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-guidance/how-to-make-an-expedite-request  and \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/asylum/affirmative-asylum-interview-\nscheduling. Requests for expedited processing are considered on a case-by-case basis and in light \nof workload priorities.  DHS will instruct the asylum offices to consider membership in the Ms. L. \nSettlement Class as a favorable factor in any requests to expedite the interview.  \n \nUSCIS will provide training to all relevant Asylum Division staff, including Asylum \nOfficers, Training Officers, Supervisory Asylum Officers (SAOs), and relevant operational staff, \non the Ms. L. litigation and the terms of this Settlement Agreement, and will remind officers of the \nrelevant lesson plans to consult on issues potentially specific or germane to Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers. Among other topics, this training will address the unique and continuing effects of the \ntrauma of forced family separation, which may affect Ms. L. Settlement Class members’ demeanor \nand/or  the  ability  to  recall  traumatic  facts  during  an  asylum  interview,  CFI/RFI,  and/or \nimmigration court hearing. The guidance shall instruct that Asylum Officers should account for \nthe unique trauma of family separation when assessing matters such as credibility and the level of \ndetail and consistency it is reasonable to expect in an applicant’s testimony.  \n \nThe training will also include a summary of asylum statutes, regulations, and case law that \nmay be relevant to potential Ms. L. Settlement Class members’ claims, including those claims \ninvolving a fear of persecution connected to forced family separation by the U.S. Government \nthrough the Zero Tolerance Policy and its associated policies and practices.  The training will \ninclude a reminder to officers that Ms. L. Settlement Class members may present claims based on \nany of the five statutorily protected grounds, including membership in a particular social group \n(PSG). Whether Ms. L. Settlement Class members can establish past persecution or a well-founded \nfear of future persecution on account of membership in a PSG will depend on the factual \ncircumstances that exist in the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s country of citizenship and the \nMs. L. Settlement Class member’s specific circumstances.  Consistent with asylum law, the \ndetermination of whether a Ms. L. Settlement Class member has been persecuted or has a well-\nfounded fear of future persecution on account of membership in a PSG must be conducted on an \nindividualized basis, based on the particular facts presented in each case. \n \nWithin 75 days of the filing of the motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement \nAgreement, USCIS will share the non-privileged portions of the training materials with Class \nCounsel, under any necessary protective orders. Class Counsel will then have 21 days to return \ncomments and feedback on the training to the government. USCIS will take Class Counsel’s \ncomments and feedback into consideration in finalizing the training and will share a final copy of \nthe non-privileged portions of the training materials with Class Counsel. \n \nMs. L. Settlement Class members’ affirmative asylum applications will be reviewed by a \ncentralized group of SAOs or Asylum Officers detailed as SAOs, prior to any denial or referral to \nEOIR. Such officers will receive the training described above. In addition, USCIS Asylum \nDivision  Headquarters  will  conduct  randomized  pre-service  review  on  a  subset  of  Ms.  L. \nSettlement Class members’ asylum application decisions (grants, denials, dismissals, and referrals \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10483   Page 20 of\n46\nto EOIR) on a rolling basis and offer additional guidance and calibration sessions to the field as \ndeemed appropriate following review of such cases. \n \nUSCIS will identify the affirmative asylum applications filed by Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers pending before USCIS as of the final approval of the settlement, including affirmative \napplications filed by Ms. L. Settlement Class members over whom USCIS has initial jurisdiction \nas  an  Unaccompanied  Child  pursuant  to  8  U.S.C.  §  1158(b)(3)(C),  INA  §  208(b)(3)(C). \nAdjudication of such pending asylum applications will be governed by the procedures for USCIS \nasylum adjudications set forth in the Settlement Agreement.  \n \nIf USCIS denied or referred to EOIR a Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s affirmative \nasylum  application  prior  to  the  Effective  Date,  USCIS  will  reopen  the  asylum  application \nfollowing the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s request, subject to the deadlines specified in \nSection IV.C.3., and adjudicate the asylum application pursuant to the procedures for asylum \nadjudications  set  forth  in  this  Settlement  Agreement.  This  requirement  does  not  apply  to \nsubsequent denials or referrals to EOIR of a Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s affirmative asylum \napplication if the application was adjudicated pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Settlement \nAgreement. This paragraph includes Unfiled NTAs; see further information in Section IV.C.2.e. \nbelow. If the NTA was filed and docketed with the immigration court, the procedures set forth in \nSection IV.C.2.b. below will apply; USCIS will reopen and adjudicate such an asylum application \nafter the Ms. L. Settlement Class member requests reopening from USCIS only if EOIR has \ndismissed or terminated the INA § 240 removal proceedings, consistent with Section IV.C.2.c, \nbelow.  Additional  and  specific  provisions  concerning  Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class  members  in \nparticular removal postures are set forth below.  \n \nb.  Dismissal  or  Termination,  Recalendaring/Dismissal  or  Termination,  and \nReopening/Dismissal or Termination of INA § 240 Removal Proceedings for Ms. \nL. Settlement Class Members \nAll requests for DHS to join or, where applicable, non-oppose motions or appeals discussed \nin this subsection will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis. DHS’s decision whether to join or \nnot oppose a motion may be influenced by information unknown to USCIS at the time of the parole \nadjudication or by the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s actions after he or she was granted parole \nby USCIS, if applicable. DHS will ensure that the email addresses or mailboxes to be used for the \nsubmission of requests for DHS to join or not oppose motions discussed in this subsection are \nposted on its public facing page on ICE.gov, and will reference the required information to be \nincluded when submitting such requests (e.g., identifying in the subject line that the noncitizen is \na Ms. L. Settlement Class member). DHS will endeavor to prioritize its review and handling of any \nproperly submitted request, subject to any staffing or resource constraints. \nMs. L. Settlement Class members requesting that USCIS reopen a previously denied or \nreferred  asylum  application  who  are  in  INA  §  240  removal  proceedings,  whose  removal \nproceedings were not previously dismissed or terminated, may submit a request to the applicable \nICE OPLA field location that DHS agree to the filing of a joint motion to dismiss or terminate or \na  joint  motion  to  recalendar  and  dismiss  or  terminate  the  removal  proceedings  before  the \nimmigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), where applicable. DHS will review \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10484   Page 21 of\n46\nproperly submitted requests on a case-by-case basis and agree to the filing of a joint motion to \ndismiss or terminate, or a joint motion to reopen and dismiss or terminate the INA § 240 \nproceedings without prejudice if DHS determines that such action is appropriate as a matter of \nprosecutorial discretion. When determining if prosecutorial discretion is appropriate, DHS will \ntake into consideration the fact that the individual is a Ms. L. Settlement Class member and was \ngranted parole. DHS’s agreement to the filing of such motions will also be contingent on the Ms. \nL. Settlement Class member being neither potentially subject to nor having been found to be \nsubject  to  a  statutory  bar  to  asylum  pursuant  to  8  U.S.C.  §  1158(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v),  INA  § \n208(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v) due to information unknown to USCIS at the time of the parole adjudication \nor by the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s actions after he or she was granted parole by USCIS. \nThe immigration judge’s grant of a joint motion to dismiss or terminate shall not reflect an \nadjudication on the merits of the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s removability. \nFor Ms. L.  Settlement Class members who are in consolidated INA § 240 removal \nproceedings with Qualifying Additional Family Members, the request submitted to DHS that it \nagree to the filing of a joint motion to dismiss or terminate, a non-opposition or joint motion to \nrecalendar and dismiss or terminate, or a joint motion to reopen and dismiss or terminate INA § \n240 removal proceedings without prejudice may include Qualified Additional Family Members \nwho are in the consolidated INA § 240 removal proceeding with the Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmember. Any filings submitted to the Immigration Court must comply with EOIR, Imm Ct. \nPractice Manual, Ch. 5.1(a).  To the extent the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s INA § 240 \nproceedings have a hearing date docketed before the immigration court before the deadlines set \nforth in Section IV.C.3, infra, DHS will review requests submitted no earlier than 90 days prior to \nthe Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s scheduled master calendar or merits hearing on a case-by-\ncase basis. DHS will review requests submitted by all other Ms. L. Settlement Class members as \nsoon as practicable. DHS will agree to join or not oppose the filing of a motion to dismiss or \nterminate, or a motion to recalendar and dismiss or terminate, or a motion to reopen and dismiss \nor terminate that includes the Ms. L. Settlement Class members’ Qualifying Additional Family \nMembers if DHS determines such action is appropriate as a matter of prosecutorial discretion. \nDHS’s agreement or non-opposition to the filing of such motions will also be contingent on the \nMs.  L.  Settlement  Class  member  and  Qualifying  Additional  Family  Member  being  neither \npotentially subject to nor having been found to be subject to a statutory bar to asylum pursuant to \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v), INA § 208(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v) due to information unknown to USCIS \nat the time of adjudication of the parole application or by the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s or \nQualified Additional Family Member’s actions after he or she was granted parole by USCIS. The \nimmigration judge’s grant of a joint motion to dismiss or terminate shall not reflect an adjudication \non the merits of the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s or Qualifying Additional Family Member’s \nremovability. \n \nThe Immigration Court (or, in some instances, the BIA) has sole discretion whether to grant \nor deny such motions.  The motion should explain that it is not in DHS’s interest to continue the \ncase, because the individual is a Ms. L. Settlement Class member, and that dismissal or termination \nis being sought under this Settlement Agreement. Should an immigration judge deny a motion to \ndismiss or terminate or reopen an order under this provision, DHS will consider, on a case-by-case \nbasis, joining or not opposing a motion to the Immigration Court to reconsider the denial and/or \nfiling a statement of non-opposition in any appeal to the BIA of such a denial. EOIR will advise \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10485   Page 22 of\n46\nadjudicators about the terms of this Settlement Agreement as it concerns EOIR and in a manner \nthat is consistent with the independent judgment and discretion exercised by immigration judges \nand appellate immigration judges. \n \nMs. L. Settlement Class members described in this Section who have a pending petition for \nreview of their INA § 240 proceedings orders under 8 U.S.C. § 1252, INA § 242, should coordinate \nwith Class Counsel and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) attorney assigned to the petition for \nreview, to ensure that the relevant circuit courts of appeals can enter appropriate orders remanding \nor dismissing the petitions. The Government’s expectation is that, absent unusual circumstances, \nDOJ will agree to a motion for remand or dismissal, if requested by the Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmember. \n \nRequests to DHS to join motions to dismiss or terminate, reopen and dismiss or terminate, \nor remand from the BIA and dismiss or terminate INA § 240 proceedings under this Settlement \nAgreement must be submitted in accordance with the deadlines specified in Section IV.C.3.  \n \nc.  Procedures for Ms. L. Settlement Class Members with Terminated or Dismissed \nINA § 240 Removal Proceedings Who Filed a Prior Asylum Application \n \nFor those Ms. L. Settlement Class members: \n \ni.  Whose INA § 240 proceedings are terminated or dismissed;  \nii.  Who already filed an asylum application directly with EOIR or with USCIS that \nUSCIS then referred or sent to EOIR (both referred to as a “prior asylum \napplication”); and \niii.  Who subsequently properly file a new complete asylum application with USCIS \nor request that USCIS reopen their prior asylum application subject to the \ndeadlines specified in Section IV.C.3:  \n \nUSCIS agrees: \n \n•  To use the initial filing date of the prior asylum application, as defined above, \nfor purposes of affirmative asylum interview scheduling, and will apply the \nscheduling priorities in place at the time of scheduling. \n•  To use the initial filing date of the prior asylum application, as defined above, \nfor  adjudicating  EAD  applications  filed  under  8  C.F.R.  §  274a.12(c)(8) \n(pending asylum applications), if the Ms. L. Settlement Class member seeks an \ninitial  or  renewal  (c)(8)  EAD  after  the  new  asylum  application  has  been \ncompleted and properly filed with USCIS or reopened by USCIS.  \n•  To inform EOIR that the individual is a Ms. L. Settlement Class member and is \nentitled  to  any  applicable  relief  under  this  Settlement  Agreement  when \nsubsequently referring Ms. L. Settlement Class members’ asylum applications \nto EOIR for adjudication in INA § 240 proceedings, if applicable. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10486   Page 23 of\n46\nMs. L. Settlement Class members described in this subsection must comply with any \nspecific  filing  guidance  or  reopening  procedures  provided  by  USCIS  for  both  the  asylum \napplication and EAD application.   \n \nFor purposes of this subsection, Section IV.C.2.c, the date USCIS receives the subsequent \nproperly filed and complete asylum application or receives the request to reopen the prior asylum \napplication is considered the date the asylum application is filed, or the date reopening is requested. \n \nFor purposes of verifying immigration status information for benefit-granting agencies, \nand notwithstanding USCIS’s agreement above, the USCIS Systematic Alien Verification for \nEntitlements Program (SAVE) will not reflect that an asylum application is pending if a benefits-\ngranting agency queries SAVE during the period between dismissal or termination of INA § 240 \nproceedings and the date when the Ms. L. Settlement Class member properly files or requests \nreopening of an asylum application with USCIS pursuant to this Settlement Agreement. \n \nd.  Procedures For Ms. L. Settlement Class Members Who Are in Expedited Removal \nor Reinstatement Proceedings or Have Expedited or Reinstated Removal Orders \n \nFollowing the Effective Date, Ms. L. Settlement Class members who have: \n  \ni.  Pending  expedited  removal  proceedings  or  reinstatement  proceedings \n(including those pending a credible fear determination or a reasonable fear \ndetermination from USCIS, and those in withholding-only proceedings under 8 \nC.F.R. § 1208.2(c)(2)(i)); or  \nii.  Final expedited removal orders or reinstated orders of removal (including those \nwith  a  negative  credible  fear  determination  or  negative  reasonable  fear \ndetermination from USCIS or such determination that was affirmed by EOIR) \n \nmay request the DHS component that issued the charging document or removal order to exercise \nits prosecutorial discretion to cancel the pending proceeding or rescind the removal order.  DHS, \nupon conducting an individualized review, will grant the request if it determines that such action \nis appropriate as a matter of discretion and the Ms. L. Settlement Class member is neither \npotentially subject to nor been found to be subject to a statutory bar to asylum pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v), INA § 208(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v). DHS will ensure that the email addresses or \nmailboxes to be used for the submission of such requests are posted on its public facing websites, \nand will reference the required information to be included when submitting such requests (e.g., \nidentifying in the subject line of the email that the noncitizen is a Ms. L. Settlement Class member). \nDHS will endeavor to prioritize its review and handling of any properly submitted requests, subject \nto any staffing or resource constraints. \n \nFor  those  Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class  members  in  withholding-only  proceedings,  upon \nrescission of the Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s reinstatement order, DHS will file, not oppose, \nor join a motion to terminate such proceedings before the Immigration Court or BIA.  \n \nUpon rescission of the unexecuted reinstatement or expedited removal order, and, if \napplicable, termination of withholding-only proceedings, the Ms. L. Settlement Class member shall \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10487   Page 24 of\n46\nhave the opportunity to apply for asylum with USCIS pursuant to Section IV.C.2.a., above. Ms. L. \nSettlement Class members whose reinstated orders of removal have been rescinded may request \nthat DHS join or not oppose a properly filed motion to reopen the prior removal order that served \nas the basis for the reinstated order and dismiss the removal proceeding in which that order was \noriginally entered  where: (1) the Ms. L. Settlement Class member was previously denied asylum \nin INA § 240 removal proceedings; (2) the Ms. L. Settlement Class member was not found to be \nsubject  to  a  statutory  bar  to  asylum  pursuant  to  8  U.S.C.  §  1158(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v),  INA  § \n208(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v); (3) the prior asylum application was denied after the separation that renders \nthe noncitizen a Ms. L. Settlement Class member occurred; and (4) DHS determines such action is \nappropriate as a matter of prosecutorial discretion. Requests will be adjudicated on a case-by-case \nbasis, and approval or agreement may by affected due to information unknown to USCIS at the \ntime of parole adjudication or actions since the individual was granted parole by USCIS. \n \ne.  Procedures for Ms. L. Settlement Class Members with an Unfiled NTA \n \nUSCIS will adjudicate asylum applications for Ms. L. Settlement Class members filed \npursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement if USCIS has jurisdiction over the application \npursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 208.2(a), notwithstanding the existence of an Unfiled NTA. However, Ms. \nL. Settlement Class members with an Unfiled NTA as of the Effective Date of the Settlement \nAgreement may request that the DHS component that issued the NTA exercise its prosecutorial \ndiscretion to cancel the NTA. The DHS component, upon conducting an individualized review, \nwill grant the request and cancel the NTA if it determines that such action is appropriate as a matter \nof discretion and that the Ms. L. Settlement Class member is neither potentially subject to nor been \nfound to be subject to a statutory bar to asylum pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v), INA \n§ 208(b)(2)(A)(i)-(v). Cancellation of the NTA is not guaranteed and may be affected due to \ninformation unknown to USCIS at the time of parole adjudication under the terms of this \nSettlement Agreement or actions since the individual was granted parole, if at all, by USCIS. \n \nf.  Provision  of  Procedural  Protections  for Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class  Members  in \nPending 240 Removal Proceedings \n \nEOIR will be advised concerning the rights of Ms. L. Settlement Class members under this \nSettlement Agreement as they pertain to EOIR. For Ms. L. Settlement Class members in INA § \n240 removal proceedings who elect to proceed with their asylum claims in immigration court in \nlieu of seeking termination or dismissal of their removal proceedings under this Settlement \nAgreement,  and  who  have  pending  asylum  applications  that  were  properly  filed  with  the \nimmigration court on or before the two years after their Settlement Class Member Confirmation \nDate, shall qualify for an extraordinary circumstances exception under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D), \nINA § 208(a)(2)(D); 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.4(a)(5), 1208.4(a)(5) and will be found to have filed their \nasylum applications within a reasonable period given the circumstances under 8 C.F.R. §§ \n208.4(a)(5), 1208.4(a)(5) for purposes of the statutory one-year filing deadline requirement under \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), INA § 208(a)(2)(B). \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10488   Page 25 of\n46\n3.  Deadlines for Seeking Relief Under this Settlement Agreement \n \na.  Deadline for Submission of Requests to Join or Non-oppose Motions to Dismiss or \nTerminate,  Reopen  and  Dismiss  or  Terminate,  or  Remand  and  Dismiss  or \nTerminate Removal Proceedings, Requests to Cancel Pending Expedited Removal \nand Reinstatement Proceedings, Requests to Rescind Expedited Removal and \nReinstated Orders of Removal, and Requests to Cancel Unfiled NTAs \n \nMs. L. Settlement Class members seeking dismissal, administrative closure, continuance, \ntermination, or reopening and dismissal or termination of their INA § 240 removal proceedings \npursuant to Section IV.C.2.b. must submit their request to join or non-oppose their motion to ICE \nOPLA for consideration no later than two years after their Settlement Class Member Confirmation \nDate.

Settlement Class members seeking cancellation of expedited removal or reinstatement \nproceedings, rescission of expedited removal or reinstated orders of removal, or cancellation of an \nUnfiled NTA pursuant to the provisions of this Settlement Agreement must submit their motion \nor request no later than two years after their Settlement Class Member Confirmation Date. \n \nb.  Deadlines  for  Submission  of  Asylum  Application  with  USCIS  or  to  Request \nReopening of a Prior Asylum Application \n \nTo obtain benefits pursuant to this Section IV.C.2.: \n \ni.  Ms. L. Settlement Class members who are filing motions to dismiss, terminate, \nor reopen and dismiss removal proceedings before EOIR pursuant to Section \nIV.C.2.b. must properly file a complete asylum application with USCIS or \nrequest that USCIS reopen their prior asylum application no later than two years \nafter  the  date  EOIR  dismisses  or  terminates  the  Ms.  L.  Settlement  Class \nmember’s removal proceedings;  \nii.  Ms. L. Settlement Class members who are submitting requests to DHS to cancel \npending  expedited  removal  or  reinstatement  proceedings,  or  rescind  a \nreinstatement or expedited removal order, pursuant to Section IV.C.2.d., must \nproperly file a complete asylum application with USCIS or request that USCIS \nreopen a prior asylum application no later than two years after the date DHS \ncancels  the  pending  expedited  removal  or  reinstatement  proceedings,  or \nrescinds the expedited removal or reinstatement order; \niii.  Ms. L. Settlement Class members whose prior asylum application was denied \nby USCIS prior to the Effective Date must request that USCIS reopen their prior \nasylum application no later than two years after their Settlement Class Member \nConfirmation Date. This requirement does not apply to subsequent denials or \nreferrals to EOIR of a Ms. L. Settlement Class member’s affirmative asylum \napplication if the application was adjudicated pursuant to the procedures set \nforth in this Settlement Agreement; and \niv.  Ms. L. Settlement Class members who do not require further action by DHS or \nEOIR before they can apply affirmatively for asylum before USCIS (e.g., they \nare not subject to INA § 240 removal proceedings, expedited removal or \nreinstatement proceedings, an expedited removal order or reinstated order of \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10489   Page 26 of\n46\nremoval,  or  are  unaccompanied  children  filing  pursuant  to  8  U.S.C.  § \n1158(b)(3)(C), INA § 208(b)(3)(C), over whom USCIS has initial jurisdiction), \nincluding Ms. L. Settlement Class members who have an Unfiled NTA or whose \nremoval orders have been executed and they subsequently returned to United \nStates via parole or were admitted in a lawful status, must properly file a \ncomplete asylum application with USCIS no later than two years after their \nSettlement Class Member Confirmation Date.  \nv.  For Ms. L. Settlement Class members who are outside the United States as of \nthe time of their Settlement Class Member Confirmation Date, in order to have \ntheir asylum application adjudicated under the terms of this section, the Ms. L. \nSettlement Class member must properly file a complete asylum application with \nUSCIS no later than two years after the date of their parole or lawful admission \nto the United States or before the Termination Date, whichever is earlier. \n \nA Ms. L. Settlement Class member's asylum application that is filed with USCIS by the \ndeadlines specified in this section will continue to be governed by procedures set forth in Section \nIV.C.2.a., even if the asylum application is pending on the Termination Date. Subsequent asylum \napplications filed by Ms. L. Settlement Class members will not be governed by this Settlement \nAgreement. \n \nFor purposes of this Settlement Agreement, the date USCIS receives the properly filed and \ncomplete asylum application or receives the request to reopen the prior asylum application is \nconsidered the date the asylum application is filed, or the date reopening is requested. \n \nV. Future Separations  \nA. This  Section  (Future  Separations)  will  apply  only  to  noncitizen  parents  and  Legal \nGuardians who are apprehended or encountered at the Border, and whose minor noncitizen \nchildren are separated from them and held in ORR or DHS custody after the Effective Date. \nThe Reunification provisions of this Section will also govern separations that occurred \nbetween January 20, 2021 and the Effective Date where the noncitizen parent or Legal \nGuardian has not been reunified with their noncitizen child(ren) before the Effective Date.  \nThis Settlement Agreement does not apply to noncitizen parents and Legal Guardians who \nare apprehended by DHS in the interior of the United States. \nB.  DHS is committed to protecting family unity by ensuring that noncitizen children in DHS \ncustody are not separated from their accompanying noncitizen parent or Legal Guardian, \nexcept in limited permissible circumstances as detailed below. CBP will not transfer a \nfamily to ICE and ICE will not seek or complete a transfer for the purpose of effectuating \na separation that could not otherwise be carried out under this Settlement Agreement.  If a \nfamily is transferred from CBP to ICE for processing, ICE shall not separate the family in \nany manner that would be inconsistent with the terms of this Settlement Agreement if it \nhad been done by CBP, and will create the documentation regarding the separation as set \nforth in Section V.K.1.a below. \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10490   Page 27 of\n46\nC.  The limited permissible circumstances for separation are the following: \n1.  CBP determines that the child or accompanying parent or Legal Guardian presents a \npublic safety or national security risk to the United States as defined in Section V.D. \nbelow, and indicates the reason for separation is national security or public safety at \nthe time of separation, if permitted;  \n2.  the parent or Legal Guardian is taken into custody by another law enforcement entity \nto serve as a material witness in circumstances that make it impossible or unsafe for \nthe child to remain with the parent or Legal Guardian;  \n3.  the parent or Legal Guardian poses a threat to the safety of the child, as defined in \nSection V.H. below, and CBP documents that risk at the time of separation;  \n4.  the parent or Legal Guardian is the subject of an active federal, state, or local warrant, \nfor which the relevant authority takes active steps to extradite the parent or Legal \nGuardian;  \n5.  the parent or Legal Guardian is referred for prosecution for a felony (other than for \nimmigration related prosecution based on illegal reentry or prior removals). Where no \nother permissible circumstances for separation are present, CBP will not refer an adult \nfor prosecution solely under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a) if the adult is traveling with a minor, \nis the minor’s parent or Legal Guardian, and is the only parent or Legal Guardian \ntraveling with the child;  \n6.  the parent, Legal Guardian, or the child requires hospitalization or outside medical care;  \n7.  or when otherwise required by law.  \n \nD. National security and public safety risks shall be determined in relation to the specific \ncircumstances of the individual. They will include, but are not limited to, an individual: \nwho is determined to have engaged in or is suspected of terrorism, espionage, or terrorism-\nrelated or espionage-related activities; has been convicted of a violent felony and is deemed \nto pose an ongoing threat to public safety; or where a determination has been made that the \nparent or Legal Guardian is subject to a mandatory detention statute prohibiting release \nbecause of terrorism grounds or a criminal offense such as INA §§ 236(c) or 241(a)(2). \nWhere national security and/or public safety risks are the basis of separation, CBP shall \ndocument that the reason for separation is national security and/or public safety at the time \nof separation or within a reasonable time afterward, to the extent such documentation does \nnot require disclosing national security or sensitive information prohibited from disclosure \nby law. \nE.  When criminal history is the basis for separation and the individual is not subject to \nmandatory detention as described in Section V.D., CBP will consider the length of time \nsince the arrest or conviction before separating a parent or legal guardian from the child. \nThis does not apply to national security concerns. \nF.  When considering information from foreign databases as the basis for separation, CBP will \nalso consider any countervailing information provided on the individual’s behalf. \n \nG. In material witness determinations, DOJ shall, in cooperation with other agencies and \nwhere practicable, make every effort to seek to avoid detention of a parent or Legal \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10491   Page 28 of\n46\nGuardian who is alleged to be a material witness if such detention would result in \nseparating them from their child. \n \nH. A threat to the safety of a child shall be defined as a threat to life or health to the extent \nthat injury or harm may be likely if the child were returned to or left in the custody of his \nor her parent or Legal Guardian. CBP shall evaluate any threat to the safety of a child on a \ncase-by-case basis and may not employ a presumption of a threat to the safety of a child, \nbased on a parent or Legal Guardian’s past criminal or immigration history.   \n \nI.  After consultation with HHS, CBP will develop standardized guidance and ensure that \nagents and officers follow the guidance when determining whether the parent or Legal \nGuardian poses a risk to the safety of the child. This guidance will be developed in \ncoordination with and subject to the approval of the DHS Chief Medical Officer. \n \nJ.  Training and guidance will be provided to all CBP agents and officers and supervisors who \nmay be involved in separating a parent or Legal Guardian from their child which fully \nexplains the new requirements in this settlement and makes clear that a parent or Legal \nGuardian shall not be separated from his/her/their child based solely on the parent or Legal \nGuardian’s immigration history, including prior removals.  \nK. Defendants shall employ the following processes and procedures to ensure that family \nunity is maintained to the greatest extent possible when a parent or Legal Guardian and his \nor her child are separated. To the extent possible, information provided to the parent, Legal \nGuardian, or child under this section pertaining to the reason for the separation, the process \nfor contesting the separation, or communication between the parent or Legal Guardian and \nthe child shall be communicated in the language that the parent, Legal Guardian, or child \nbest understands, using an interpreter or translation if necessary:  \n1.  Procedures at Initial Separation  \n \na.  Initial internal documentation \n  \nCBP  shall  document  the  separation  in  its  electronic  systems  of  records.  Such \ndocumentation shall include the fact of separation, the reason for separation, including facts \nspecific to the separated individual which, in the discretion of the agency, explain the separation, \nto  the  extent  such  documentation  does  not  require  disclosing  national  security  or  sensitive \ninformation prohibited from disclosure by law, and known biographic (including A numbers) and \nlocation information of the separated parent(s) or Legal Guardian(s) and separated child(ren). CBP \nwill include relevant documents supporting the decision to separate in the A-file of the separated \nchild(ren) and separated parent or Legal Guardian.  \n \nb.    Information disclosures to separated parents, Legal Guardians, and children \n \ni.  At the time of a separation, CBP shall provide a written explanation to the \nparent or Legal Guardian of what is occurring, and next steps, including the \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10492   Page 29 of\n46\nreason(s) for the separation, including facts specific to the separated individual, \nwhich in the discretion of the agency, explain the separation, to the extent such \ndocumentation  does  not  require  disclosing  national  security  or  sensitive \ninformation prohibited from disclosure by law. The written explanation must \nalso include information on how the parent or Legal Guardian can submit \nadditional information to ICE regarding their separation using the Family \nSeparation Supplemental Information Form (FSSIF) or successor forms, see \nSection V.K.3.c.i., or to HHS where relevant to parentage determinations, see \nSection V.K.3.d.ii, as well as contact information for making a complaint to the \nDHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the DHS and DOJ Offices \nof the Inspector General. DHS shall provide the parent with a copy of the \nFSSIF. The FRTF will also post the FSSIF on its DHS website. The FSSIF shall \nnot  require  a  parent  or  Legal  Guardian  to  provide  the  reason  they  were \nseparated. \n \nii.  If a U.S. citizen child accompanies a noncitizen parent or Legal Guardian who \nenters CBP’s custody at the Border and CBP refers the child to a state or local \nagency, CBP will endeavor to inform the noncitizen parent of the state and local \nentity where the child went and any known contact information for the agency. \nCBP will endeavor to inform any state or local agency, at the time that the child \nis referred, that the child was separated from their parent.  \n \niii.  HHS will create a one-pager explanation for CBP to provide to the separated \nparent or Legal Guardian and separated child at the time of separation.  The \none-pager will include notice that the child will be placed with an ORR care \nprovider until reunification with the parent or Legal Guardian or release to \nanother relative or other approved sponsor; that the child will be referred for the \nappointment of a child advocate; that the child will receive a Know Your Rights \npresentation and legal screening within 10 business days of entering ORR \ncustody;  and  that federal  agencies  shall  facilitate  communication  between \nchildren and their separated parent or Legal Guardian while the child is in ORR \ncustody. HHS will ensure that the one-page explanation is age-appropriate for \nthe child.  \n \n2.  Government information sharing related to any separation of a parent or Legal \nGuardian from his or her child \n \na.  CBP shall work with HHS and ICE to ensure that, consistent with information \nsharing  agreements  and  legal  obligations,  HHS  and  ICE  are  provided  the \ndocuments needed for operational purposes (e.g., criminal records, conviction \ndocuments, identity documents).  \n \nb.  Defendants will ensure that the information specified in Sections V.K.2.(c) through \n(e) below is available to agencies identified in those Sections that may take custody \nof a separated parent, Legal Guardian, or child (whether it is made available through \na shared database or other method of information exchange between agencies), so \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10493   Page 30 of\n46\nthat each agency has the information it needs to track a parent or Legal Guardian \nand his or her separated child, to identify when reunification is appropriate, and to \nfacilitate such reunification. \n \nc.  Information that will be made available to ORR \n \nThe following information shall be provided or made available to ORR at the time of the \nchild’s transfer or, in extraordinary circumstances, no later than three business days after the \nchild’s transfer. Within three business days after receiving the following information, ORR shall \nprovide such information to the facility where the child is being held; the child’s attorney of record \nand/or accredited representative as defined in 8 C.F.R. § 1292.1(a)(4), who has submitted Form L-\n3, Notice of Attorney Representation, to ORR, and to any Child Advocate appointed under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1232(c)(6). ORR shall provide information made available to ORR under this Section to \nan ORR contracted legal service provider who is not the child’s attorney of record if ORR \ndetermines that the child does not have an attorney or accredited representative of record: \n \ni.  The fact that a child transferred to ORR custody was separated from a parent or \nLegal Guardian, as set out in Section V.K.1.a;  \n \nii.  The location to which the parent or Legal Guardian was initially transferred, \nand updates within 72 hours of the parent or Legal Guardian’s transfer to \nanother location; \n \niii.  The  reason  for  the  separation,  including  facts  specific  to  the  separated \nindividual which, in the discretion of the agency, explain the separation, to the \nextent such documentation does not require disclosing national security or \nsensitive information prohibited from disclosure by law;  \n \niv.  Any available contact information for the parent or Legal Guardian, including \nany contact information to reach the parent or Legal Guardian at their current \ndetention facility, updated 72 hours after they are transferred to a new facility; \nand  \n \nv.  DHS and HHS shall work together to ensure that HHS has information needed \nfor HHS operations, including information about a trusted third party, if a parent \nor Legal Guardian chooses to designate such a trusted third party to receive \ninformation about their location and their child’s location, see Section V.K.1.g. \n \nd.  Information that will be provided or made available to ICE \n \ni.  The fact that a  parent  or  Legal Guardian transferred to ICE custody was \nseparated from his or her child;  \n \nii.  Known biographical information for the separated parent or Legal Guardian and \nthe separated child; \n \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10494   Page 31 of\n46\niii.  The  reason  for  the  separation,  including  facts  specific  to  the  separated \nindividual which, in the discretion of the agency, explain the separation, to the \nextent such documentation does not require disclosing national security or \nsensitive information prohibited from disclosure by law; and \n \niv.  The location where the child is being held if the child is in ORR custody, \nincluding updated location information within 24 hours of any transfer of the \nchild  within  ORR  custody,  and  information  on  how  the  parent  or  Legal \nGuardian may contact the child, including contact information for the child’s \nassigned  case  manager,  the  child’s  attorney  of  record  and/or  accredited \nrepresentative as defined in 8 C.F.R. §  1292.1(a)(4) who has submitted Form \nL-3, Notice of Attorney Representation, to ORR, and any Child Advocate \nappointed  under  8  U.S.C.  §  1232(c)(6).  ORR  shall  provide  the  contact \ninformation for an ORR contracted legal service provider who is not the child’s \nattorney of record if ORR determines that the child does not have an attorney \nor accredited representative of record. \n \ne.  In cases in which a separated parent or Legal Guardian is referred to the custody of \nthe U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), information that will be provided or made \navailable to USMS \n \ni.  The fact that a parent or Legal Guardian transferred to USMS custody was \nseparated from his or her child; \n \nii.  The reason for the separation; and \n \niii.  The location where the child is being held if the child is in ORR custody, \nincluding updated location information within 24 hours of any transfer of the \nchild  within  ORR  custody,  and  information  on  how  the  parent  or  Legal \nGuardian may contact the child including contact information for the child’s \nassigned  case  manager,  the  child’s  attorney  of  record  and/or  accredited \nrepresentative as defined in 8 C.F.R. §  1292.1(a)(4) who has submitted Form \nL-3, Notice of Attorney Representation, to ORR, and any Child Advocate \nappointed  under  8  U.S.C.  §  1232(c)(6).  ORR  shall  provide  the  contact \ninformation for an ORR contracted legal service provider who is not the child’s \nattorney of record if ORR determines that the child does not have an attorney \nor accredited representative of record.  \n \nf.  In cases in which a separated parent or Legal Guardian is in the custody of a state \nor local agency, information that CBP will endeavor to provide or make available \nto that agency: \n \ni.  The fact that a parent or Legal Guardian transferred to that agency’s custody \nwas separated from their child; and \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10495   Page 32 of\n46\nii.  If the child is in ORR custody, information on how the parent or Legal \nGuardian may contact the child. \n \ng.  HHS and ICE shall develop procedures by which a parent or Legal Guardian may \nmake a singular notification designating one trusted third-party individual, who is \nnot in ICE custody, to be kept updated promptly by HHS and ICE, as appropriate, \nany time the location of the separated parent or Legal Guardian or the separated \nchild changes while in ICE or HHS custody, respectively. For a parent or Legal \nGuardian in ICE custody, ICE will notify the third-party individual regarding \nchanges in the location of custody of the parent or Legal Guardian. For a child in \nORR custody, ORR will update the third-party individual regarding changes in the \nlocation of the child if ORR has current contact information for the third-party \nindividual. \n \n3.  Additional Procedures following the Initial Separation  \n \na.  Outside of lawful seizures of fraudulent documents or other evidence of criminal \nactivity, in no circumstance shall any employee of DHS confiscate and fail to return \na parent, Legal Guardian, or child’s documents that might be relevant to showing \nthe family relationship. DHS shall make reasonable efforts, in a manner within its \ndiscretion, to authenticate presented documents prior to separation and shall ensure \nthe prompt return of documents believed not to be fraudulent upon confirmation of \nparentage. \n \nb.  HHS will determine what information provided by DHS about the separation can \nbe provided to the child in an age-appropriate and trauma-informed way. HHS will \nrefer every separated child admitted to ORR custody for appointment of a child \nadvocate, who will have been alerted that the child was separated from a parent or \nLegal Guardian pursuant to Section V.K.2.c. \n \nc.  Submission of additional information to ICE and processes for facilitating contact \nwith children: \n  \ni.  A separated parent or Legal Guardian in ICE custody can submit additional \ninformation to ICE regarding their separation using the FSSIF. FSSIFs will be \nmade available to ICE detainees in all detainee housing units and the FRTF will \npost the FSSIF on its DHS website. ICE ERO Field Offices will collect \ncompleted FSSIFs, and any supporting documentation, in the same manner as \na traditional Detainee Request Form. ICE officers are required to email the \nFSSIFs and supporting documentation to a dedicated email address specific to \nthis process as soon as practicable, but in any event within 7 business days. A \nseparated parent or Legal Guardian may submit subsequent FSSIFs if they are \nproviding new information.   \n \nii.  A separated child can submit additional information to ORR regarding their \nseparation and ORR will update the child’s ORR case file with that information. \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10496   Page 33 of\n46\nORR will also provide the updated information to the child’s attorney of record \nand/or accredited representative as defined in 8 C.F.R. § 1292.1(a)(4), who has \nsubmitted Form L-3, Notice of Attorney Representation to ORR, or to an ORR \ncontracted legal service provider who is not the child’s attorney of record if \nORR  determines  that  the  child  does  not  have  an  attorney  or  accredited \nrepresentative of record; and to any Child Advocate appointed under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(c)(6). Any update provided by the child may be conveyed to ICE by the \nchild’s attorney of record or, in the absence of an attorney of record, the \ncontracted legal services provider if the child consents.  If the child is not \nrepresented by an attorney of record, then the child advocate may provide \nupdates  to  ICE  when  the  child  advocate  determines  that  sharing  such \ninformation  with  ICE  would  be  in the  child’s best  interest  and  the  child \nconsents. \n \niii.  ICE shall post fliers in all of its detention facilities to explain how parents and \nLegal Guardians can request to contact their children or provide supplemental \ninformation regarding the basis of their separation, or submit a complaint to the \nDHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and/or the DHS Office of the \nInspector General, or contact Class Counsel by mail. \n \niv.  ICE shall maintain a direct email inbox for legal representatives of separated \nparents or legal guardians in ICE or USMS custody to provide the FSSIF \ndirectly to ICE. The FRTF will post the FSSIF on its DHS website along with \nthe email address. For individuals in ICE custody, ICE shall respond to inquiries \nwithin 72 hours. Individuals who submit the form while in USMS custody may \nbe asked to re-submit the form if transferred to ICE custody. \n \nv.  The USMS and ORR will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) \nto establish an internal tracking system and procedures between the agencies to \nfacilitate communication and reunification between a separated parent or Legal \nGuardian in USMS custody and their child(ren) who are in ORR custody. That \nMOU shall include a requirement that the USMS will alert ORR when a \nseparated parent or Legal Guardian transfers out of USMS custody and, upon \ntransfer,  the  location  to  which  the  parent  or  Legal  Guardian  has  been \ntransferred, unless restricted from doing so for detainee safety, security, or other \nrelated concerns. In no case shall a parent or Legal Guardian’s transfer out of \nUSMS custody be delayed because of this notification requirement. \n \nd.  Separations due to non-parentage  \n \n  DHS must justify the separation of a child and adult on the basis that the adult is not the \nparent or Legal Guardian of the child and must investigate and verify the non-parental relationship \nbefore any separation, which may include contacting the relevant consulate for the child and adult. \nWhere DHS believes the adult is not the child’s biological parent, it must offer to conduct a DNA \ntest, with the consent of the adult, and receive and communicate the results to the parent prior to \nany separation. If any adult believes that DHS’s determination that he or she is not the parent or \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10497   Page 34 of\n46\nLegal Guardian of a separated child was in error, he or she can challenge the determination as \nfollows: \n \ni.  If the adult is in ICE custody, he or she can submit additional information to \nICE using the procedure in Section V.K.3.c.i. ICE must consider and respond \nto such additional information, and communicate its response to the separated \nparent or Legal Guardian, within 14 business days. If it is determined that the \nadult is the parent or Legal Guardian of the child and there is no other basis for \ncontinued  separation,  then  ICE  will  coordinate  with  HHS  to  facilitate \nreunification if the child remains in HHS custody, under the streamlined Ms. L. \nprocess.  Should  HHS  decline  to facilitate  reunification  due  to  an  alleged \nsubstantial  child  safety  risk  or  alleged  incapacity  of  the  parent  or  Legal \nGuardian, HHS must provide the parent or Legal Guardian or his or her \nrepresentative with a Notification of Denial letter (as laid out in ORR Policy \nGuide Section 2.7.7 (Notification of Denial)) and instructions on the appeal \nprocess  pursuant  to  ORR  Policy  Guide Section  2.7.8 (Appeal  of  Release \nDenial). If the child is released from ORR custody to a sponsor, ICE will \nconsider alternatives to detention for the parent or Legal Guardian to facilitate \nreunification. At the time of the child’s release to a sponsor, ORR will also \nprovide  the  sponsor  information  to  the  parent  in  ICE’s  legal  custody.  If \nparentage is determined after the child has been released from ORR custody \nand the parent is still in ICE custody, ORR will provide information at that time \nto  the  parent, for  the  purpose  of  facilitating reunification,  concerning  the \nsponsor to whom the child was released. If parentage is determined after the \nparent is no longer in ICE custody, and the parent contacts ORR, ORR will \nprovide information at that time to the parent concerning the sponsor to whom \nthe child was released. A copy of this information will also be sent to the \nparent’s attorney (if ORR has the attorney’s contact information) and the child’s \nattorney (if they have one) or legal services provider (LSP).  \n \nii.  If the adult is not in ICE custody, he or she can submit evidence of parentage to \nHHS in the manner described in the written explanation provided to the adult \nupon separation, see Section V.K.1.b.i. If HHS determines that the adult is the \nparent or Legal Guardian of the child, then HHS shall facilitate reunification \nunder the streamlined Ms. L. process unless there exists a child safety risk as \ndefined in Section V.H., or the child or the parent or Legal Guardian is \nunavailable due to criminal custody or incapacity, is not physically present in \nthe United States, or declines reunification. Should HHS decline to facilitate \nreunification due to an alleged substantial child safety risk or alleged incapacity \nof  the  parent  or  Legal  Guardian,  HHS  must  provide  the  parent or  Legal \nGuardian or his or her representative with a Notification of Denial letter (as laid \nout  in  ORR  Policy  Guide  Section  2.7.7  (Notification  of  Denial))  and \ninstructions on the appeal process pursuant to ORR Policy Guide Section 2.7.8 \n(Appeal of Release Denial). \n \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10498   Page 35 of\n46\ne.  Separations due to the transfer of the parent or Legal Guardian to criminal custody \nbased on an active warrant or because the individual is being held as a material \nwitness:  \n \ni.  If a parent or Legal Guardian is transferred to criminal custody based on an \nactive warrant or because the individual is being held as a material witness, as \ndescribed in Section V.G. above, the child will be transferred to HHS. Absent \nan independent basis for separation, a parent or Legal Guardian who is returned \nto DHS custody at the end of their criminal custody shall be reunified with his \nor her child.   \n \nii.  In  such  cases  HHS  shall  facilitate  reunification  of  the  child  under  the \nstreamlined Ms. L. process unless there exists a child safety risk as defined in \nSection V.H. or the child or the parent or Legal Guardian is unavailable due to \nincapacity,  is  not  physically  present  in  the  United  States,  or  declines \nreunification. Should HHS decline to facilitate reunification due to an alleged \nsubstantial  child  safety  risk  or  alleged  incapacity  of  the  parent  or  Legal \nGuardian, HHS must provide the parent or Legal Guardian or his or her \nrepresentative with a Notification of Denial letter (as laid out in ORR Policy \nGuide Section 2.7.7 (Notification of Denial)) and instructions on the appeal \nprocess  pursuant  to  ORR  Policy  Guide Section  2.7.8 (Appeal  of  Release \nDenial).    \n \nf.  Separations due to hospitalization or outside medical care  \n \nIf a parent or Legal Guardian is separated from his or her child due to the hospitalization \nor need for outside medical care of a parent, Legal Guardian, and/or child, and there are no other \ngrounds for separation, the parent or Legal Guardian will be entitled to reunification with his or \nher child once the family member is released from the hospital. Any decision that the child(ren) \nand parent or Legal Guardian cannot remain together shall be based on the needs, policies, and/or \nrestrictions of the hospital or other care facility where the parent, Legal Guardian, and/or child is \nreceiving care.  Any separated child shall be placed in an ORR facility as close as possible to where \nthe parent or Legal Guardian is receiving medical care if ORR has sufficient beds available within \nthe demographic area to accommodate the child. When the family member is released from \nmedical care, DHS and HHS will work to facilitate reunification under the streamlined Ms. L. \nprocess if the child is in ORR custody and the parent or Legal Guardian is in DHS custody, absent \nan independent reason to separate. Should HHS decline to facilitate reunification due to an alleged \nsubstantial child safety risk or alleged incapacity of the parent or Legal Guardian, HHS must \nprovide the parent or Legal Guardian or his or her representative with a Notification of Denial \nletter (as laid out in ORR Policy Guide Section 2.7.7 (Notification of Denial)) and instructions on \nthe appeal process pursuant to ORR Policy Guide Section 2.7.8 (Appeal of Release Denial). If the \nchild will be released from ORR custody to an approved sponsor before the parent is released from \nDHS custody, ORR shall notify the hospitalized parent of the child's intended sponsor and plans \nfor release and reunification with the sponsor, as well as the sponsor's address and contact \ninformation. \n \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10499   Page 36 of\n46\ng.  Separations for any other reason that does not preclude future eligibility for \nreunification  \n \nIf DHS determines that continued separation of a previously-separated parent or Legal \nGuardian who is in DHS custody is no longer warranted, DHS will coordinate with HHS to \nfacilitate reunification under the streamlined Ms. L. process if the child remains in HHS custody. \nShould HHS decline to facilitate reunification due to an alleged substantial child safety risk or \nalleged incapacity of the parent or Legal Guardian, HHS must provide the parent or Legal Guardian \nor his or her representative with a Notification of Denial letter (as laid out in ORR Policy Guide \nSection 2.7.7 (Notification of Denial)) and instructions on the appeal process pursuant to ORR \nPolicy Guide Section 2.7.8 (Appeal of Release Denial). \n \nh.  Removal \n \n If a separated parent or Legal Guardian who has been in custody throughout the pendency \nof their removal proceedings has not been reunified with his or her separated child at the time he \nor she is being removed from the United States, and there are no legal prohibitions or risk to the \nchild as defined in Section V.H., ICE shall offer the parent or Legal Guardian the opportunity to \nbe removed with his or her child as set forth below. \n \ni.  ICE will provide the Notice of Potential Rights Form, or its successor forms, to \nthe separated parent or Legal Guardian when he or she enters ICE custody. If \nreunification is requested, ICE shall notify HHS, through a dedicated ORR \nmailbox, of the request as soon as is operationally feasible and, in any event, \nwithin three business days of when the separated parent signs the form and \ninforms ICE of the decision.  If the separated parent or Legal Guardian is \nreleased from ICE custody after he or she signs the Notice of Potential Rights \nForm, ICE shall notify HHS of the release, and the procedures in this subsection \n(h) (Removal) will no longer apply and ICE will follow its normal policies and \nprocedures. \n \nii.  If the child is in HHS custody, then HHS shall notify any attorney for the child \nor legal services provider at the child’s shelter and any appointed child advocate \nwithin one business day of receiving the request for reunification. Within seven \nbusiness days of receiving that request, the child will notify HHS through their \nrepresentative, and HHS will notify ICE within one business day, whether the \nchild prefers to be removed with their parent or Legal Guardian, objects to \nremoval with their parent or Legal Guardian, or needs more time to make the \ndecision. If the child needs more time to make a decision, including any \ndiscussion with the parent or Legal Guardian, the child shall be provided an \nadditional  seven  business  days  in  which  to  make  their  decision.  Unless \noperationally infeasible, ICE shall not remove the parent or Legal Guardian \nprior to expiration of the relevant time period specified here. Where the child \nmakes or  changes their decision after the relevant time period but before \nremoval and a delay in removal will not result, ICE, in its discretion, may, but \nwill have no obligation to, consider such decision. \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10500   Page 37 of\n46\n \niii.  Where the child has been released from HHS custody, HHS shall notify any \nattorney for the child on record with ORR and any appointed child advocate \nwithin one business day of being notified of the pending removal. If the child \nis no longer in HHS custody, the child may make any objection to removal to \ntheir attorney of record or appointed child advocate. Within seven business days \nof receiving notice, the attorney or child advocate may convey that the child \nagrees to removal, objects to removal, or needs more time to make the decision. \nIf the child needs more time, the child shall be provided an additional seven \nbusiness days in which to make their decision. Unless operationally infeasible, \nICE shall not remove the parent or Legal Guardian prior to expiration of the \nrelevant time period specified here. Where the child makes or changes their \ndecision after the relevant time period but before removal and a delay in \nremoval will not result, ICE, in its discretion, may, but will have no obligation \nto, consider such decision. \n \niv.  If the child in ORR custody elects to be removed with the parent or Legal \nGuardian, ICE shall expeditiously coordinate with HHS to accomplish the \nreunification of the parent or Legal Guardian and child as is operationally \nfeasible prior to the removal of the parent or Legal Guardian and child, as \ndescribed above. \n \n4.  Communication between a separated parent or Legal Guardian and their child \n \na.  The government will take the following steps to facilitate communication between \na separated parent or Legal Guardian and their child: \n \ni.  When the parent or Legal Guardian is in ICE custody and the child is in HHS \ncustody,  designated  ICE  field  office  points  of contact  will  help  facilitate \ncommunication between parent(s) or Legal Guardian(s) and children with the \nORR case managers. If the child is in the custody of a state or local agency, \ndesignated  ICE  field  office  points  of  contact  will  attempt  to  facilitate \ncommunication between the child and parent(s) or Legal Guardian(s) when \npractical and legally permissible. \n \nii.  When the parent or Legal Guardian is in USMS custody and the child is in HHS \ncustody, designated USMS field office points of contact will help facilitate \ncommunication between parent(s) or Legal Guardian(s) and children with the \nORR case managers. If the child is in the custody of a state or local agency, \nUSMS  will  endeavor  to  assist  the  parent  or  Legal  Guardian  to  facilitate \ncommunication with their child, consistent with federal, state, or local laws and \npolicies that govern the facility where the parent or Legal Guardian is detained, \nand subject to operational or administrative feasibility.  \n \niii.  When the parent or Legal Guardian is in the custody of a state or local agency \nand the child is in HHS custody, designated HHS points of contact will help \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10501   Page 38 of\n46\nattempt to facilitate communication between children and parent(s) or Legal \nGuardian(s). \n \niv.  ICE and USMS shall offer separated parents or Legal Guardians information \nabout how to request telephone contact with their separated child(ren).   \n \nv.  ORR shall offer separated children information about how to request telephone \ncontact with their parent or Legal Guardian.  \n \nvi.  Contact between parents or Legal Guardians and their children shall be free of \ncost, meaning that in no case shall contact be denied because the separated \nparent or Legal Guardian lacks funds in their account to make calls.   \n \nvii.  ICE and ORR shall coordinate to facilitate contact between a parent or Legal \nGuardian and their child within 48 hours of the child arriving to the ORR care \nprovider. USMS shall coordinate with ORR to facilitate contact between a \nparent or Legal Guardian and their child upon the parent or Legal Guardian \narriving in USMS custody. The frequency and mode of communication will be \ncoordinated between the facility where the parent or Legal Guardian is being \nheld and ORR based on the availability of the parent or Legal Guardian and the \navailability  of  resources  at  the  facility  where  they  are  being  detained. \nAlternative  means  of  communication  shall  be  explored  and  implemented \nwhenever  the  parent,  Legal  Guardian,  or  child  is  unable to  communicate \neffectively by verbal interaction alone. Facilities will endeavor to make such \ntelephone or video contact available for a minimum of 20 minutes for each \ncommunication, subject to facility-wide protocols impacting all detainees. \n \nL.  Nothing in this Section shall prohibit ICE from exercising its discretion to make safety-\nbased housing decisions concerning families in its custody.  \n \nVI. Notice and Reporting \nA.

The terms of the Settlement Agreement shall be incorporated into the Order of the Court \napproving the Settlement Agreement. The Order shall constitute the final judgement of the Court \nwith regard to the Action. The Order shall include a statement that the Order of the Court and all \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10505   Page 42 of\n46\nobligations of the Parties under the Settlement Agreement will terminate on the Termination Date \nexcept that: \n1.  Defendants’ obligations under Section V (Future Separations) will terminate on the \nTermination Date – Future Separations; and  \n2.   Defendants will continue to provide Behavioral Health Services as described in \nSection IV.B.2.a. above for one year following the Termination Date. \nB.  From the Effective Date until the Termination Date, the Court will retain jurisdiction over \nthe Action only for the purpose of enforcing the terms of the Settlement Agreement, except that \nthe Court shall retain jurisdiction over Section V (Future Separations) until the “Termination Date \n– Future Separations,” and shall retain jurisdiction to resolve disputes regarding the provision of \nMental Health Services as described in Section IV.B.2.a. above for one year following the \nTermination Date; and shall retain jurisdiction to resolve disputes concerning any applications for \nrelief filed pursuant to this Settlement Agreement that remain pending as of the Termination Date. \nC.  The Parties agree that they will apply the following dispute resolution mechanisms \nbefore seeking enforcement from the Court: \n1.  Should counsel for either party believe in good faith that the other party has failed to \nimplement or comply with a specific term of this Settlement Agreement, counsel shall, within \n7 days of learning of the alleged noncompliance, notify counsel for the opposing side, in \nwriting, of the specific grounds upon which non-compliance is alleged. Disagreement with a \nsole individual discretionary decision or final adjudicative determination provided for in the \nSettlement Agreement is not a valid basis for alleging non-compliance. \n2.  Any allegations of violations of this Settlement Agreement must be substantiated with \nspecific detailed information about the violations sufficient to enable the responding party to \ninvestigate and respond. \n3.  The responding party shall respond in writing within a reasonable period, but no later \nthan thirty (30) calendar days following the receipt of notice of the alleged failure to comply, \nand provide the responding party’s position and any action it has taken or intends to take to \naddress the alleged non-compliance. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to \nresolve any remaining disputes. The Parties agree to make good faith attempts to resolve the \nissues informally, including a good faith attempt to agree on a reasonable date by which to cure \ninstances of non-compliance. \n4.  If the Parties have exhausted the process set out in the preceding paragraphs and the \ncomplaining  Party  believes  that  the  alleged  instances  of  non-compliance  have  not  been \nremedied, the Parties may (1) jointly refer any unresolved dispute to a mediator agreed upon \nby the Parties; or, alternatively, (2) seek relief before the Court in the Ms. L. case.  \n5.  Any request or communication to a mediator or potential mediator to begin the \nmediation process must be a joint request or communication from both Parties. The Parties \nagree that the mediation process described in this Section shall be conducted confidentially \nand that no public disclosure shall be made regarding the mediation process at any time before, \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10506   Page 43 of\n46\nduring, or after the mediation process, except that the final result of the mediation may be \ndisclosed. Plaintiffs retain the right to share information obtained via the mediation process—\nsubject to the Protective Order in this case—with outside stakeholders or organizations that \nbrought the dispute to Plaintiffs’ attention, or any other stakeholders or organizations with \nrelevant information or expertise Plaintiffs wish to consult with regarding issues raised in the \nmediation  process.  Any  documents  or  information  disclosed  by  either  party  during  the \nmediation process shall not be admissible in any judicial proceeding. All statements  or \nconclusions of the mediator shall not be admissible in any subsequent judicial proceeding. \n6.  If the Parties do not reach resolution under the procedures of Paragraphs 1-6, either \nparty may file a motion requesting that the Court resolve the dispute. \n7.  If Plaintiff has a good faith belief that immediate, irreparable harm to a Ms. L. \nSettlement Class member who is eligible for benefits under this Agreement is imminent and \ncannot be resolved within the time frames specified in this Section, Plaintiffs may make an \nimmediate application for relief to the Court in the Ms. L. case, after providing notice of such \nharm to Defendants’ Counsel. \nD.  The Parties agree that any action or proceeding to enforce the terms of this \nAgreement shall be brought exclusively to the Court in the Ms. L. case. The Court shall have the \npower to award such relief and issue such judgments as the Court deems necessary for enforcement \nof the Settlement Agreement. \nE.  The Parties will endeavor to avoid using the dispute resolution process set forth in \nthis  Section  to  address  allegations  of  temporary  or  de  minimis  breaches  of  the  Settlement \nAgreement. This paragraph does not prevent Plaintiffs from raising individual and case-specific \ninstances of violations of the Settlement Agreement for resolution. \nVIII.  Fees and Expenses \nDefendants agree that they will pay reasonable fees and other expenses incurred by Class \nCounsel in the litigation of this Action, in accordance with the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 \nU.S.C. § 2412(d). Defendants reserve their right to raise defenses related to the reasonableness of \nClass Counsel’s request for fees and expenses, but otherwise waive their available defenses to a \nclaim brought by Class Counsel under 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d) for the litigation of this Action through \nthe Effective Date of the Settlement Agreement. No later than 60 days following the Effective \nDate Plaintiffs will serve a fee demand on Defendants, and the Parties will then enter into \nnegotiations to determine the amount of reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by Defendants. \nIf the Parties cannot reach agreement on the amount of reasonable fees and expenses to be paid, \nthen they will submit the issue to the Court in the Ms. L. case for binding resolution. This Section \ndoes not affect or waive any party’s rights or defenses concerning any requests for fees or expenses \nincurred more than 60 days after the Effective Date related to enforcement of this Settlement \nAgreement. \nIX. Additional Provisions  \nA. By entering into this Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs and all Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmembers waive and release all Defendants in their individual and official capacities, the United \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10507   Page 44 of\n46\nStates, and past, present, or future department or component heads, inferior officers, employees, \nagents, representatives, or contractors from all Released Claims. The Released Claims are all \nclaims, demands, rights, liabilities and causes of action for declaratory or injunctive relief, known \nor unknown, arising from or related to the alleged separation of any Ms. L. Settlement Class \nmember from his or her parent, Legal Guardian, or child, where such claims existed prior to the \nEffective Date of this Settlement Agreement and were or could have been alleged in the Action \nbased on the same common nucleus of operative facts alleged by Plaintiffs in their pleadings and \nthe arguments made in the Action. The Released Claims under this Settlement Agreement do not \ninclude claims for damages. \nB.  This Settlement Agreement and its exhibits constitute the entire agreement among the \nParties hereto concerning the settlement of the Action, and no representations, warranties, or \ninducements have been made by any party hereto other than those contained and memorialized in \nsuch documents. \nC.  Other than as set forth herein, this Settlement Agreement shall not be construed to \nwaive, reduce, or otherwise diminish the authority of the Defendants to enforce the laws of the \nUnited States against Ms. L. Settlement Class members, consistent with the Constitution and laws \nof the United States, and applicable regulations. \nD. This Settlement Agreement shall not be offered or received against the Defendants or \nthe United States as evidence of, or construed as or deemed to be evidence of, any presumption, \nconcession, or admission by any of the Defendants or the United States of the truth of any fact \nalleged by the Plaintiffs or the validity of any claim that had been or could have been asserted in \nthe Action or in any litigation, or the deficiency of any defense that has been or could have been \nasserted in the Action, or of any liability, negligence, fault, or wrongdoing of the Defendants or \nthe United States or its employees, officers, or agents; or any admission by the Defendants or the \nUnited States or its employees, officers, or agents of any violations of, or failure to comply with, \nthe Constitution, laws or regulations.  \nE.  The Settlement Agreement shall not be offered or received against the Defendants or \nthe  United  States  as  evidence  of  a  presumption,  concession,  or  admission  of  any  liability, \nnegligence, fault, or wrongdoing, nor shall it create any substantive rights or causes of action \nagainst Defendants or the United States, in any other civil, criminal, or administrative action or \nproceeding, other than such proceedings as may be necessary to enforce the provisions of this \nSettlement Agreement. \nF.  This Settlement Agreement may not be modified or amended, nor may any of its \nprovisions be waived, except by a writing signed by all Parties hereto or their successors-in-\ninterest. \nG. All deadlines in this Settlement Agreement will be calculated in accordance with the \nguidelines set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a) unless otherwise provided in the \nSettlement Agreement.  \nH. This Settlement Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts. All executed \ncounterparts and each of them shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument provided that \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10508   Page 45 of\n46\ncounsel for the Parties to this Settlement Agreement shall exchange among themselves original \nsigned counterparts. \nI.  This Settlement Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the \nsuccessors and assigns of the Parties hereto. \nJ.  The waiver by one party of any breach of this Settlement Agreement by any other party \nshall not be deemed a waiver of any other prior or subsequent breach of this Settlement Agreement. \nK. All counsel and any other person executing this Settlement Agreement and any of the \nexhibits hereto, or any related settlement documents, warrant and represent that they have the full \nauthority to do so and that they have the authority to take appropriate action required or permitted \nto be taken under the Settlement Agreement to effectuate its terms. \nL.  Class Counsel and Defendants’ Counsel agree to cooperate fully with one another in \nseeking Court approval of this Settlement Agreement and to promptly agree upon and execute all \nsuch other documentation as may be reasonably required to obtain final approval by the Court of \nthe Settlement Agreement. \n   \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-AHG   Document 721-1   Filed 12/01/23   PageID.10509   Page 46 of\n46\nDATED: December 1 , 2023  Respectfully submitted, \nBRIAN BOYNTON \n_____________________________  Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General \nLee Gelernt* \nJudy Rabinovitz*  CHRISTOPHER P.

DENYING IN PART PLAINTIFFS’ \nMOTION TO ALLOW PARENTS \n14  U.S. Immigration and Customs \nDEPORTED WITHOUT THEIR \nEnforcement (“ICE”); et al., \n15  CHILDREN TO TRAVEL TO THE \nRespondents-Defendants.  UNITED STATES \n16 \n \n17 \n  Plaintiffs bring the present motion to allow a small group of migrant parents who \n18 \nwere separated from their minor children at the border, and then deported without their \n19 \nchildren, to travel to the United States so they may be reunited with their children and \n20 \npursue their asylum claims as provided by law.  These parents are members of the Ms. L. \n21 \nClass, which was certified by this Court on June 26, 2018.  That Class included over 2,800 \n22 \nparents who were forcibly separated from their children at the United States-Mexico border \n23 \nunder the Administration’s immigration policies.  (See 8/14/19 Joint Status Report, ECF \n24 \nNo. 444.)1  Thereafter, the children were detained in government-run facilities throughout \n25 \n26 \n                                                \n27 \n1  On March 8, 2019, the Court modified the class definition to include parents who entered \n28 \nthe United States with their children beginning on July 1, 2017.  (See ECF No. 386.)  \n1 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7777   Page 2 of 21\n \n1  the United States.  Pursuant to this Court’s orders, all of these children have now been \n2  accounted for and more than 2,300 of them have been reunified with at least one of their \n3  parents.  But during the chaotic and unprecedented practice of separating these migrant \n4  families, 471 of the parents were deported without their children.  (ECF No. 382 at 7.)2  All \n5  of these parents have now been found through the herculean efforts of the parties.3  Many \n6  of the parents were located in remote villages in the recesses of Central America, and nearly \n7  all of them have now made the difficult decision either to reunify with their children in \n8  their home countries or to waive reunification and allow their children to remain in the \n9  United States to pursue their own claims for asylum in accordance with established law.   \n10  Thirty of the 471 parents returned to the United States without permission and sought \n11  asylum upon apprehension.  According to Plaintiffs, all thirty of these parents either passed \n12  a credible fear interview or were placed directly into immigration proceedings before an \n13  immigration judge, and were subsequently reunified with their children.  Eighteen other \n14  parents,4 who are the subject of the present motion, are also seeking to return to the United \n15 \n                                                \n16 \n17  Defendants, led admirably by Commander Jonathan White of the Department of Health \nand Human Services, are currently working to identify how many children of these parents \n18 \nwent through government custody, and how many additional parents will be included in \n19  the Class.  These additional numbers are not included in the approximately 2,800 parents \nreferenced here.       \n20 \n2  Defendants have identified 471 parents “who were removed from the United States \n21  without  their  children,  and  without  being  given  the  opportunity  to  elect  or  waive \nreunification in accordance with the [June 26, 2018] preliminary injunction.”  (Id.)  The \n22 \nenlarged class of Ms. L. parents, as defined in the Court’s March 8, 2019 Order, may \n23  include many more parents who were removed without their children.  See n.1, supra.   \n3    Plaintiffs  established  a  steering  committee  comprised  of  volunteers  and  non-\n24 \ngovernmental organizations (“NGOs”).  Mr. Steven Herzog and his law firm, Paul, Weiss, \n25  Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, devoted hundreds of hours of pro bono legal services.  NGOs \nsuch as Justice in Motion and Kids in Need of Defense (“KIND”) also devoted countless \n26 \nhours toward the important and unprecedented effort of locating parents in Central America \n27  who had been separated from their minor children. \n4  Plaintiffs originally sought relief on behalf of twenty-one parents but have now limited \n28 \nthe request to eighteen parents.  See, infra, at 9-10.   \n2 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7778   Page 3 of 21\n \n1  States, but rather than doing so unilaterally, they are requesting that the Court order the \n2  Government to allow them to return so they, too, may be reunited with their children and \n3  pursue their asylum claims under existing law and procedures. \n4  Plaintiffs argue they are entitled to this relief under a Settlement Agreement entered \n5  into between the parties in this case, as well as under Ninth Circuit law that provides for \n6  the return of an alien who is wrongfully removed.  Defendants oppose the motion.  The \n7  matter has been fully briefed and argued.  For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds \n8  eleven of the parents are entitled to the relief requested under Ninth Circuit law and seven \n9  are not, those parents having failed to meet their burden of proving they were wrongfully \n10  removed.   \n11  I. \n12  DISCUSSION \n13    On June 26, 2018, this Court certified the Ms. L. Class of parents and generally \n14  included in the Class those parents who were (1) separated from their minor children at the \n15  border pursuant to the Administration’s immigration policies and (2) did not have criminal \n16  history (with limited exceptions), were not unfit and did not present a danger to their \n17  children.  The Court also issued on the same day a preliminary injunction prohibiting \n18  Defendants from further separating parents and their children at the border as there was a \n19  likelihood that conduct violated the parents’ Fifth Amendment due process rights to family \n20  integrity under the United States Constitution.  The preliminary injunction also ordered \n21  Defendants to reunite the families that had already been separated.  There is no dispute the \n22  eighteen parents at issue fall within the Ms. L. Class.   \n23  The circumstances of the eighteen parents’ immigration and removal proceedings \n24  vary widely.  Twelve of the eighteen parents were removed before this Court issued its \n25  class certification order and preliminary injunction.  Two other parents were removed after \n26  those orders issued, but before this Court issued a stay of any further removals.  Three \n27  parents were removed after the stay, and it is unclear when the remaining parent was \n28  removed.   \n3 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7779   Page 4 of 21\n \n1  Of the twelve parents  who were removed before issuance of the Court’s class \n2  certification order and preliminary injunction, two subsequently returned to the United \n3  States illegally, and were again removed without their children.  It appears these two \n4  parents fell outside the scope of the court-approved Settlement Agreement in this case, (see \n5  ECF No. 321), and thus were subject to removal, because they were not “continuously \n6  physically present in the United States since June 26, 2018[.]”  (ECF No. 220-1 at 1.5)   \n7  Sixteen of the eighteen parents entered the United States illegally at the southern \n8  border with Mexico, while two of the parents entered legally through designated ports of \n9  entry.  And although the majority of those entering illegally were transferred to criminal \n10  custody and prosecuted under the Administration’s “zero tolerance policy”6 before being \n11  returned to immigration custody, it appears others were not charged with a crime and were \n12  detained only in immigration custody. \n13    Waiver forms executed by the parents, purporting to waive the parents’ rights to be \n14  reunified with their children prior to removal, also varied.  One parent signed the court-\n15  approved form that was supposed to be attached to the Class Notice.  Others signed a form \n16  provided by Defendants prior to the Court’s approval of the Class Notice.  And still others \n17  signed forms of unknown origin. \n18    Finally, the length of each parent’s separation from their child varied considerably.  \n19  One parent was separated from his child for nine days, while another parent was separated \n20  from her child for nearly seven months.  And although each parent suffered the same injury,  \n21 \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n5  The page numbers cited here and throughout this Order correspond to the page numbers \n24 \nassigned by the Court’s CM/ECF filing system. \n25  6  On May 7, 2018, the Attorney General of the United States announced a zero tolerance \npolicy, in which all adults entering the country illegally would be criminally prosecuted.  \n26 \nIn accordance with that policy, parents who crossed between ports of entry with their minor \n27  children were separated from their children and prosecuted.  Many of those parents were \nreturned to immigration custody after serving their criminal sentence and then deported \n28 \nwithout their children. \n4 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7780   Page 5 of 21\n \n1  namely separation from their child, the effect of that injury on each parent and their \n2  respective immigration case was different.    \n3    Despite these varying circumstances, Plaintiffs move the Court to allow all eighteen \n4  parents to return to the United States as a group.  Plaintiffs are not asking the Court to order \n5  Defendants to pay for or otherwise arrange travel for these parents to the United States.  \n6  (ECF  No. 434  at 49-50.)    Rather, they  are  moving  the  Court  for  an order directing \n7  Defendants to allow the parents to return to the United States so they can be reunified with \n8  their children and proceed with their asylum claims.  (Id. at 50.)  As noted, Plaintiffs argue \n9  the Court has authority to grant this relief pursuant to either the court-approved Settlement \n10  Agreement  in  this  case  or  the  Court’s  inherent  authority  under  Ninth  Circuit  law.  \n11  Defendants dispute that the Settlement Agreement gives the Court authority to grant the \n12  requested relief.  Indeed, they argue the Settlement Agreement forecloses the Court’s \n13  ability to do so.  Aside from the Settlement Agreement, Defendants also assert the Court \n14  lacks jurisdiction to order the relief requested here.  Each argument is addressed in turn. \n15  A.  Settlement Agreement \n16  The entirety of the relevant provision of the Settlement Agreement is found under \n17  the heading, “The return of removed parents to the United States.”   It provides:   \n18  The government does not intend to, nor does it agree to, return any removed \nparent to the United States or to facilitate any return of such removed parents.  \n19 \nThe classes agree not to pursue any right or claim of removed parents to return \n20  to the United States other than as specifically set forth in this paragraph.  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel may raise with the government individual cases in which \n21 \nplaintiffs’ counsel believes the return of a particular removed Ms. L class \n22  member may be warranted.  Plaintiffs’ counsel represent that they believe that \nsuch individual cases will be rare and unusual and that they have no basis for \n23 \nbelieving that such individual cases will be other than rare and unusual.  \n24  Plaintiffs’ counsel agree to present any such cases, including all evidence they \nwould like considered by the government within 30 days of the approval of \n25 \nthis agreement.  In light of plaintiffs’ counsel’s representation that such cases \n26  will be rare and unusual, Defendants agree to provide a reply to any case \npresented  by  Plaintiffs  within  30  days  of  receiving  Plaintiffs’  request  to \n27 \nconsider the case.  Except as specifically set forth herein, the classes agree \n28 \n5 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7781   Page 6 of 21\n \n1  that existing law, existing procedures, and the Court-approved reunification \nplan address all interests that such parents or their children may have.   \n2 \n3  (ECF No. 315-2 at 7.)7  There is no dispute this provision sets out a procedure for the parties \n4  to follow in the event Plaintiffs believe that return to the United States is warranted for an \n5  individual Ms. L. class member.  Under that procedure, Plaintiffs agree to present any cases \n6  warranting return to Defendants, and Defendants agree to provide a response within thirty \n7  days of receiving Plaintiffs’ request.  Other than these two requirements, however, the \n8  Agreement fails to set out any specifics.  For instance, while the Agreement reflects \n9  Plaintiffs’ belief that such cases will be “rare and unusual,” it does not set out the criteria \n10  by which Plaintiffs will decide that return to the United States is warranted.  Nor does the \n11  Agreement  set  out  the  criteria  by  which  Defendants  will  review  Plaintiffs’  requests.  \n12  Defendants argue that return to the United States would be warranted only in “rare and \n13  unusual”  cases,  whatever  that  might  mean.    But  the  Court reads  that  portion  of  the \n14  Agreement simply to reflect a good faith standard: Plaintiffs’ belief that individual cases \n15  warranting return will be “rare and unusual,” not that only “rare and unusual” cases will \n16  warrant return.   \n17    On its face, the Agreement does little more than outline procedures the parties will \n18  follow in the event Plaintiffs’ counsel believe “the return of a particular removed Ms. L \n19  class member may be warranted.”  (Id.)  Both parties have complied with these general \n20  procedures.  But the Agreement does not provide for any further relief if Plaintiffs’ requests \n21  for return are rejected.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ motion to the extent it relies on the Settlement \n22  Agreement is denied. \n23    Defendants argue the only relief available to Plaintiffs is under the Settlement \n24  Agreement, and that relief does not include the return of these parents once Defendants \n25 \n                                                \n26 \n27  7  The Settlement Agreement was filed in both this case and in a related class action case \ninvolving the minor children of the Ms. L. class members.  See M.M.M. v. Jefferson \n28 \nSessions, et. al., Case No. 18cv1832 DMS (MDD).   \n6 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7782   Page 7 of 21\n \n1  have  evaluated  and  rejected  Plaintiffs’  requests.    In  support,  Defendants  rely  on  the \n2  language of the Settlement Agreement that states “[t]he classes agree not to pursue any \n3  right or claim of removed parents to return to the United States other than as specifically \n4  set forth in this paragraph.”  (ECF No. 315-2 at 7.)  However, the Agreement also provides \n5  that “the classes agree that existing law, existing procedures, and the Court-approved \n6  reunification plan address all interests that such parents or their children may have.”  (Id.)  \n7  Plaintiffs are pursuing relief under existing law.  The Court, therefore, declines to find that \n8  the Settlement Agreement provides the only basis for the relief requested in the present \n9  motion.   \n10  B.  Ninth Circuit Law \n11  As an alternative to the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs argue the Court may grant \n12  the requested relief pursuant to its “remedial authority to effectuate its injunction and \n13  ensure a meaningful opportunity for reunification.”  (Mem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Mot. at \n14  11.)  In support, Plaintiffs rely on a series of Ninth Circuit cases involving the court-ordered \n15  return of aliens who were wrongfully deported.  See Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032 (9th \n16  Cir. 1998); Singh v. Waters, 87 F.3d 346 (9th Cir. 1996); Mendez v. Immigration and \n17  Naturalization Service, 563 F.2d 956 (9th Cir. 1977).  Defendants do not address these \n18  cases, relying instead on the argument that the Court lacks jurisdiction to order Defendants \n19  to allow the return of these parents.  (See Opp’n to Mot. at 17-19.)  Defendants cite a \n20  number of cases that speak to the power of the legislative and executive branches of the \n21  federal government “over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens.”  Arizona v. \n22  United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394 (2012).  But none of the cases cited by Defendants \n23  addresses the specific issue raised here, which is whether the Court may order Defendants \n24  to allow parents who were separated from their children at the border pursuant to a \n25  nationwide policy, and who were subsequently deported without their children, to travel \n26  back to the United States so they may be reunified with their children and have a renewed \n27  opportunity to request asylum free from the trauma of that separation.  Indeed, given the \n28  unprecedented nature of this situation, there are no cases directly on point.   \n7 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7783   Page 8 of 21\n \n1  However, the Ninth Circuit cases cited by Plaintiffs are instructive.  See Walters, \n2  145 F.3d 1036 (reviewing permanent injunction requiring INS to parole class members into \n3  the United States as a result of due process violations during immigration proceedings); \n4  Singh, 87 F.3d at 346-50 (reviewing denial of habeas petition filed by deported alien \n5  alleging  unlawful  deportation);  Mendez,  563  F.2d  at  957-59  (reviewing  challenge  of \n6  deported  alien  to  deportation  order  where  alien  was  deprived  of  right  to  counsel  in \n7  immigration proceeding).  In each of the foregoing cases, the court rejected the defendant’s \n8  argument that the court lacked authority to order return of the alien to the United States.  \n9  See Walters, 145 F.3d at 1050-51 (rejecting argument “that the district court exceeded its \n10  authority in requiring the INS to grant parole to these individuals, as a matter of both recent \n11  statutory developments and of circuit precedent.”); Singh, 87 F.3d at 347 (holding district \n12  court had jurisdiction over habeas petition seeking petitioner’s return to the United States); \n13  Mendez, 563 F.2d at 958-59 (rejecting jurisdictional challenge to appeal of immigration \n14  orders).  In light of these cases, the Court rejects Defendants’ jurisdictional argument and \n15  finds it has authority to grant the requested relief if a parent was wrongfully deported.   \n16  The circumstances of each parent’s case must therefore be examined, and Plaintiffs \n17  carry the burden of proving that each parent was unlawfully or improperly removed.8  \n18  Plaintiffs, however, argue the group as a whole should be allowed to return to the United \n19  States because they meet three criteria:  (1) they present bona fide claims for asylum, (2) \n20  their asylum claims were abandoned or lost due to coercion or trauma inflicted by the \n21  family separation policy, and (3) they are unable to reunify in their home country because \n22  of fear of harm to themselves and their children.  (Mem. in Supp. of Mot. at 7-8.)  There is \n23  no legal authority establishing these criteria as a basis for the relief sought.  Rather, Ninth \n24  Circuit case law provides that the relief sought here, primarily, the parents’ return to the \n25  United States, depends on a finding that the parents were unlawfully deported.  See Walters, \n26 \n                                                \n27 \n8  During the August 16, 2019 status conference, Plaintiffs’ counsel conceded that Plaintiffs \n28 \nbear the burden to show that any removals were unlawful.  (ECF No. 452 at 28.) \n8 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7784   Page 9 of 21\n \n1  145 F.3d at 1050-51 (upholding parole into United States as remedy for due process \n2  violation in immigration proceedings); Singh, 87 F.3d at 347 (holding petitioner’s unlawful \n3  deportation entitled him to habeas relief, including return to the United States); Mendez, \n4  563 F.2d at 958 (stating issue was whether the “departure was ‘legally executed’ [] when \n5  effected by the government.”) \n6    Plaintiffs initially argued the parents’ deportations were illegal based on “the trauma \n7  of family separation, in conjunction with statutory and regulatory violations[.]”  (Pls.’ \n8  Supp. Br. in Supp. of Mot. at 3.)  During a subsequent status conference,  however, \n9  Plaintiffs made clear their lead argument was that the deportations of these parents were \n10  unlawful based solely on their separation from their children.  (ECF No. 452 at 28-29.)  As \n11  traumatic and unlawful as the separations may have been, the Court declines to find that \n12  separation of the family—standing alone—renders the subsequent removal of the parent \n13  unlawful.  Rather, to be entitled to the relief sought here, the circumstances surrounding \n14  the separation of each parent from his or her child must have caused the deportation or \n15  removal to be unlawful, e.g., the separation must have affected the voluntariness of the \n16  parent’s decisions in the immigration proceedings, or there must have been a statutory or \n17  regulatory violation in the immigration process independent of the separation, e.g., a failure \n18  to provide a credible fear interview in the face of a credible fear claim.  This inquiry must \n19  be addressed on an individual basis, not to the group as a whole.  See Walters, 145 F.3d at \n20  1051 (discussing individual nature of parole decision).   \n21    Since  the  parties  did  not  frame  the  issue  in  these  individual  terms,  the  Court \n22  requested supplemental briefing from the parties and ordered Defendants to produce the \n23  parents’ immigration records to fully develop the facts of each parent’s case.  (See ECF \n24  No. 437.)9  In the course of the supplemental briefing, Defendants agreed to return one of \n25 \n26 \n                                                \n27 \n9  Defendants produced approximately 245 pages relating to the immigration proceedings \n28 \nof the eighteen parents.  Although Defendants also had an opportunity to submit their own \n9 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7785   Page 10 of 21\n \n1  the twenty-one original parents to the United States because he was removed without first \n2  receiving a credible fear interview in violation of law.  It also appears another parent is \n3  already in the United States with “pending INA § 240 proceedings” before an immigration \n4  judge.  In addition, Plaintiffs indicated they would not be pursuing relief as to another one \n5  of the twenty-one original parents, leaving only the eighteen parents at issue.  The Court \n6  has now reviewed the records of each parent and makes the following findings. \n7  C.  Findings \n8    A.D.G. – The records reflect A.D.G. and his daughter were apprehended by Border \n9  Patrol agents on May 30, 2018, near Hidalgo, Texas.  (ECF No. 448 at 6.)  A.D.G.’s Form \n10  I-21310 includes a notation that A.D.G. was part of a family unit.  (Id. at 5.)  It also includes \n11  a statement that A.D.G. did not fear being returned to his country of origin.  (Id. at 8.)  In \n12  A.D.G.’s Declaration submitted in support of this motion, he states, “I told officials on \n13  several occasions that I was afraid to return to [my country of origin].”  (ECF No. 430 at \n14  4.)  It is unclear, however, whether those claims were made to an immigration officer, as \n15  required.  The relevant statute provides that if an alien indicates to an “immigration officer” \n16  either an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution, that officer shall refer the \n17  alien for an interview by an asylum officer.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).11  Based on \n18  the evidence submitted and other court records, it appears A.D.G. was at some point \n19  transferred to criminal custody, and it appears his claims may have been made to a federal \n20 \n                                                \n21 \ndeclarations in response to the parents’ declarations, they did not do so.  Thus, the findings \n22 \nherein are based on the parents’ declarations and the documents produced by the parties.   \n23  10  Plaintiffs state the Form I-213 “is the form that Customs and Border Patrol agents \ncomplete soon after initially apprehending an individual.”  (Pls.’ Supp. Br. in Supp. of Mot. \n24 \nat 4 n.3.)   \n25  11  The statute provides: “If an immigration officer determines that an alien (other than an \nalien described in subparagraph (F)) who is arriving in the United States or is described in \n26 \nclause (iii) is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of this title and the \n27  alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a \nfear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview by an asylum officer \n28 \nunder subparagraph (B).”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).   \n10 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7786   Page 11 of 21\n \n1  correctional officer rather than an immigration officer.  In light of the evidence, it is unclear \n2  whether A.D.G. was entitled to a credible fear interview pursuant to § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).  \n3  Furthermore, although A.D.G. attests to the emotional distress he suffered as a result of \n4  being  separated  from  his  daughter,  he fails to  explain  how  that  distress  affected  his \n5  deportation proceedings.  Based on the present record, Plaintiffs have not met their burden \n6  to show that A.D.G. was unlawfully deported.    \n7    B.L.S.P. – The evidence reflects B.L.S.P. and her son were apprehended by Border \n8  Patrol agents on November 20, 2017, in Presidio, Texas.  (ECF No. 448 at 19.)  Although \n9  B.L.S.P.’s Form I-213 states she did not fear persecution or harm should she be returned \n10  to her country of origin, (id. at 19-20) (B.L.S.P. “stated she does  not fear persecution or \n11  harm should she be returned to native country ….”), she in fact was later provided a \n12  credible fear interview.  (ECF No. 430 at 10.)  It is unclear exactly how long B.L.S.P. was \n13  separated from her son before her credible fear interview, but it may have been anywhere \n14  from one to four months.  During that time, B.L.S.P. “was constantly crying.”  (Id. at 9.)   \n15  For a month, B.L.S.P. had no information about where her son was, and she \nfelt that she could faint from the pain she was feeling. …  B.L.S.P. was so \n16 \nstressed by the separation from her son that part of her face became paralyzed \n17  for 2-3 days.  It was extremely swollen and very painful.  …  B.L.S.P. felt \npowerless, overwhelmed by depression from the abrupt separation from her \n18 \nson, all her past traumas resurfaced, and she had difficulties getting through \n19  the days.   \n20  (Id.  at  9-10.)    B.L.S.P.  passed  her  credible  fear  interview  and  was  referred  to  an \n21  immigration judge (“IJ”).  (Id. at 10.)  Two months passed, however, before B.L.S.P.’s \n22  hearing before the IJ.  (Id.)  By that point, B.L.S.P. had been separated from her son for \n23  nearly six months.  During the hearing, the IJ told B.L.S.P. that it would be another five \n24  months before her asylum hearing would be scheduled.  (Id. at 11.)   \n25  B.L.S.P. was overwhelmed and traumatized by the ongoing and indefinite \nseparation from her child.  Faced with potentially almost a year before her \n26 \nasylum claim could be heard and the prospect of ongoing separation from her \n27  child throughout this time, she felt defeated, hopeless and unable to remain \nseparated nor to focus on her asylum claim.  …  B.L.S.P. was so distraught at \n28 \nthe idea of being separated from her child for what would be closer to a year \n11 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7787   Page 12 of 21\n \n1  by the time her next hearing was scheduled that she decided she could not take \nthe suffering anymore and she withdrew her application and asked to go back \n2 \nto [her country of origin].   \n3   \n4  (Id.) \n5    In B.L.S.P.’s case, the issue for the Court is whether her decision to withdraw her \n6  application for asylum and withholding of removal was voluntary.  See 8 C.F.R. § 235.4 \n7  (stating alien’s “decision to withdraw his or her application for admission must be made \n8  voluntarily[.]”)12    The  evidence  presented  clearly  warrants  a  finding  that  B.L.S.P.’s \n9  withdrawal  of  her  claims  was  not  voluntary.    When  B.L.S.P.  and  her  son  entered \n10  immigration detention on November 20, 2017, they were separated, and the following day \n11  B.L.S.P. awoke and found “her son was gone.”  (ECF No. 430 at 9.)  She remained \n12  separated from her son for several months, and for a month, “had no information about \n13  where her son was[.]”  (Id.)  She was thereafter allowed only limited phone contact with \n14  her son, and during the time they were separated, she suffered not only emotional harm, \n15  but physical harm as well.  (Id. at 9-10.)  After nearly six months of separation, and being \n16  told that she would remain separated from her son for another five months, “[s]he chose to \n17  abandon her claim rather than continue the punishment of separation from her child.”  (Id. \n18  at 11.)  The Court cannot say B.L.S.P.’s decision to withdraw her applications was the \n19  product of a free and deliberate choice, particularly when she made her decision as a result \n20  of the continued separation from her child.  B.L.S.P.’s subsequent removal based on the \n21  alleged voluntary withdrawal of her claim was therefore unlawful. \n22 \n23                                                  \n24 \n12  The same standard applies to B.L.S.P.’s decision to waive her appeal of the IJ’s decision.  \n25  United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828, 840 (1987).  See also Garcia v. Lynch, 786 \nF.3d 789, 792 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting In re Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1320, 1322 \n26 \n(BIA 2000)) (stating waiver of appeal of IJ decisions must be “’knowingly and intelligently \n27  made.’”); Ali v. Mukasey, 525 F.3d 171, 173-74 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating waiver of appeal of \nIJ decision must be “knowing and voluntary”).   \n28 \n \n12 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7788   Page 13 of 21\n \n1    C.A.C. – The circumstances surrounding C.A.C.’s removal raise yet other issues.  \n2  Specifically, C.A.C. executed the court-approved Form that was supposed to be provided \n3  to class members along with the Class Notice.  C.A.C. chose the following option:  “If I \n4  lose my [immigration] case and am going to be removed, I do NOT want to take my child \n5  with me.”  (ECF No. 448 at 29.)  That Form was approved by the Court on July 10, 2018.  \n6  (See ECF No. 103.)  It appears C.A.C. signed the Form on July 13, 2018.  (ECF No. 448 \n7  at 29.)  He was then removed on July 20, 2018.  (Id. at 22.)   \n8  The problem with C.A.C.’s removal is that on July 16, 2018, this Court granted \n9  Plaintiffs’ motion to stay the removal of class members pending full briefing on that issue.  \n10  (ECF No. 117 at 4.)  It appears that C.A.C.’s removal was in violation of that Order, and \n11  therefore unlawful.  See Singh, 87 F.3d at 349 (finding removal unlawful where alien was \n12  deported after stay of deportation had been issued by immigration judge).   \n13  Two other parents appear to have suffered a similar fate: E.A.S.M. and E.F.A.R.  \n14  These parents appear to have been removed in violation of the Court’s stay order.  (See \n15  ECF No. 448 at 101, 124) (indicating removal of E.A.S.M. on July 16, 2018, and removal \n16  of E.F.A.R. on August 22, 2018).  Indeed, E.F.A.R. was removed not only after the Court’s \n17  stay order, but after the Court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting Defendants \n18  from removing Class Members.  Accordingly, the removals of these two additional parents \n19  were also unlawful. \n20  C.P.E. – C.P.E. presents circumstances similar to those of A.D.G. in that the parties \n21  dispute whether he made a credible fear claim.  C.P.E. claims he did, (see ECF No. 430 at \n22  19) (“I told the officials that I was afraid to go back to [my country of origin], but they \n23  ignored me.”), but his Form I-213 reflects he did not.  (ECF No. 448 at 34) (“the subject \n24  does not [ ] claim fear persecution or torture if returned to the subject’s country of \n25  citizenship.”)  As with A.D.G., it is unclear when and to whom C.P.E. allegedly made his \n26  credible fear claim.  Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show C.P.E.’s removal was \n27  unlawful.   \n28 \n13 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7789   Page 14 of 21\n \n1  D.C.C. – D.C.C. presents circumstances similar to those of A.D.G. and C.P.E. in \n2  that there is a dispute about whether he made a credible fear claim.  Unlike A.D.G. and \n3  C.P.E., D.C.C. appears to  allege he  made a credible fear  claim during his screening \n4  interview with an immigration officer.  (See ECF No. 430 at 24, ¶ 6.)  Defendants submit \n5  a Form I-213, which refutes D.C.C.’s assertions and states, “Subject made a statement \n6  claiming no fear of being returned to his country of origin.”  (ECF No. 448 at 41.)  But \n7  there is more to D.C.C.’s case.  D.C.C. provides evidence he was subject to coercion and \n8  misrepresentations by the immigration officer.  (ECF No. 430 at 24.)  For instance, D.C.C. \n9  states the immigration officer told him his “papers were already completed” and that he \n10  “had to return” to his country of origin.  (Id.)  The officer said he “had to sign the paper, \n11  that there was no choice.”  (Id.)  He stated that if D.C.C. “didn’t sign the papers, he would \n12  sign for me, so I signed.”  (Id.)  The officer also said in response to D.C.C.’s claim of fear \n13  that D.C.C. “was not allowed to stay in the United States because the President had changed \n14  the law and only [D.C.C.’s] son could stay.”  (Id.)  These circumstances sufficiently \n15  demonstrate D.C.C.’s removal was based on an involuntary waiver of his rights as a result \n16  of the officer’s actions.  Plaintiffs have therefore met their burden to show D.C.C.’s \n17  removal was unlawful.  \n18  D.J.M. – D.J.M.’s case also presents a dispute about whether he made a credible \n19  fear claim.  In his Declaration, D.J.M. states “[t]he agents did not ask me if I was afraid to \n20  return to [my country of origin].”  (ECF No. 430 at 31.)  D.J.M. states, “I tried to explain \n21  that  I  could  not go back to  [my  country  of origin]  but it  was difficult  without [an] \n22  interpreter.”  (Id.)  While D.J.M. states he had difficulty communicating, he does not state \n23  he was unable to do so.  And D.J.M’s Form I-213 states he “claimed no fear of persecution \n24  or torture if he is returned to his native country ….”  (ECF No. 446 at 45-46.)  As with the \n25  others discussed above, Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show D.J.M.’s removal was \n26  unlawful.   \n27  D.P.F. – D.P.F. also presents a dispute about whether he made a credible fear claim.  \n28  In his Declaration, he states an officer asked him and his daughter if they were afraid to \n14 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7790   Page 15 of 21\n \n1  return to their country of origin, and they replied “yes, and told the officer why [they] were \n2  afraid to return.”  (ECF No. 430 at 65.)  However, D.P.F.’s Form I-213 states, “Subject \n3  made a statement claiming no fear of being returned to his country of origin.”  (ECF No. \n4  448 at 90.)  As with the others discussed above, Plaintiffs have not met their burden to \n5  show D.P.F.’s removal was unlawful.   \n6  D.X.C. – D.X.C. also presents a dispute about whether he made a credible fear claim, \n7  but  unlike  the  individuals  discussed  above,  his  case  also  presents  issues  about \n8  voluntariness.  In his Declaration, he states that after he and his 8-year-old son turned \n9  themselves in to immigration officials, he “asked the official for protection and asylum[.]”  \n10  (ECF  No.  430  at  79.)    D.X.C.  states  he  repeated  that  claim  the  following  day,  and \n11  “explained to the official that [he] had been attacked and feared returning to [his country \n12  of origin] with [his son].”  (Id.)  D.X.C. states that during this exchange, the official asked \n13  D.X.C. to sign a document, but he refused and persisted with his credible fear claim.  (Id.)  \n14  After he refused to sign the document,  \n15  [t]he officer left and a few minutes later came back with another officer.  The \nsecond officer told me that if I persisted in my asylum claim they would have \n16 \nto separate [my son] and I.  He told me that government rules would not allow \n17  for me to be released while I asked for asylum, that I would be held for at least \ntwo years while my asylum claim was heard by a judge, and that I would be \n18 \nseparated from [my son] during that time.  He told me that if I asked for \n19  asylum, [my son] would be placed for adoption because he could not stay with \nme in an adult detention center.  The officer further told me that I could avoid \n20 \nbeing separated from [my son] only if I signed the document in front of me \n21  which he said would allow for us to be deported together.  Otherwise, he said \nI would be held and [my son] taken from me and put up for adoption.  I felt \n22 \ncrushed with fear and [my son] began to cry.  Fearing the permanent loss of \n23  [my son] in a foreign land to an unknown American family was too much for \nme to bear.  As a result, I was forced to sign the paper in front of me that I \n24 \ncould not read, and agreed to be deported in order not to lose my 8-year-old \n25  son to adoption.   \n26  (Id.)    D.X.C.  states  that  despite  the  representations  of  the  immigration  officials, \n27  “[i]mmediately after I signed the document, [my son] was separated from me, and the \n28  officers placed my hands and feet in shackles.”  (Id. at 80.)  D.X.C.’s Form I-213 is silent \n15 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7791   Page 16 of 21\n \n1  as to this exchange, but appears to confirm that D.X.C. was separated from his son.  (ECF \n2  No. 448 at 97.)  As for credible fear, the Form states, “the subject does not [ ] claim fear \n3  persecution or torture if returned to the subject’s country of citizenship.”  (Id.) \n4  As stated, 8 C.F.R. § 235.4 states that an alien’s “decision to withdraw his or her \n5  application for admission must be made voluntarily[.]”  D.X.C.’s Declaration reflects he \n6  did not voluntarily withdraw his claim.  Rather, it reflects the immigration officials coerced \n7  him to drop his asylum claim.  See Orantes-Hernandez v. Smith, 541 F. Supp. 351, 372-74 \n8  (C.D. Cal. 1982) (discussing “coercive tactics to cause members of the class to accept \n9  ‘voluntary departure’ to El Salvador”); see also United States v. Tingle, 658 F.2d 1332, \n10  1336 (9th Cir. 1981) (finding officers’ warning to parent, including that parent “might not \n11  see … two-year-old child for a while … patently coercive.”)  Specifically, after the initial \n12  officer was unable to persuade D.X.C. to sign the document, another officer was brought \n13  into the interview room.  The second officer then threatened that if D.X.C. “persisted in \n14  [his] asylum claim, they would have to separate” him from his son, that the separation \n15  could last “for at least two years[,]” and that his son would be put up for adoption.  (ECF \n16  No. 430 at 79.)  Given these facts, the Court finds D.X.C.’s decision to withdraw his \n17  credible fear claim was involuntary and his subsequent removal was unlawful. \n18  E.C.C. – Like many of the other parents, E.C.C. states he made a credible fear claim \n19  when he originally surrendered to immigration officials, and again thereafter.  (See ECF \n20  No. 430 at 94-95.)  Defendants contend E.C.C. did not make a credible fear claim, but they \n21  fail to submit any evidence to support that contention.  Based on the evidence presently \n22  before the Court, E.C.C. made a credible fear claim, and was not provided with a credible \n23  fear interview in violation of § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii).  E.C.C.’s removal was unlawful. \n24  J.A.A. – Other than J.A.A.’s Declaration, there is limited information about the \n25  circumstances surrounding his removal.  Defendants assert he was removed pursuant to a \n26  June 18, 2018 Order of an IJ, (see ECF No. 448 at 135-36), and they submit a “Separated \n27 \n28 \n16 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7792   Page 17 of 21\n \n1  Parent’s Removal Form.”  (Id. at 137.)13  The Form is undated, so it is unclear whether \n2  J.A.A. executed the Form before or after the IJ’s Order.  However, J.A.A.’s Declaration \n3  suggests he signed the Form before his hearing with the IJ.  (See ECF No. 430 at 115.)   \n4  The  circumstances  surrounding  J.A.A.’s  execution  of  this  particular  form  are \n5  unclear, but J.A.A. describes the circumstances surrounding the execution of “three [other] \n6  documents.”  (Id.)  He states that after being separated from his daughter for more than two \n7  weeks, during which time he had no information about her whereabouts and was not able \n8  to speak with her, he was taken to a room with “an official wearing a red shirt” who asked \n9  him if he “was going to ask for asylum.”  (Id.)  J.A.A.:  \n10  tried to explain that [he] was fleeing violence in [his country of origin]:  that \n[his] older brother was murdered and that [he and his daughter] had been \n11 \nattacked in the same town where [his] brother was killed.  The official told \n12  [him] that there was a new policy of zero tolerance towards migrants and that \nthey were no longer giving out asylum.   \n13 \n14  (Id.)  The official asked J.A.A. if he had a lawyer, and when he said no, the official “told \n15  [him] to sign three documents but did not explain what they were.”  (Id.)  J.A.A. says the \n16  documents were in English, and he “signed them because [he] felt like there was no other \n17  choice.”  (Id.)  He states:  “During this meeting, I felt like I was not thinking clearly because \n18  I was so distressed by not knowing what was happening with my daughter.”  (Id.) \n19  It is unclear whether the Form submitted to the Court was one of the three documents \n20  J.A.A. signed during that meeting.  However, assuming the Form was one of the three \n21  documents, the Court cannot say J.A.A.’s execution of it was voluntary.  Rather, the official \n22  who handed him the Form misrepresented that the United States “was no longer giving out \n23  asylum.”  (Id.)  That undisputed misrepresentation, combined with the distress J.A.A. was \n24  suffering as a result of being separated from his daughter, not knowing her whereabouts \n25 \n26 \n                                                \n27 \n13  The Separated Parent’s Removal Form was used by Defendants before the Court’s \n28 \napproval of the Class Notice.  (See M.M.M. v. Sessions, Case No. 18cv1832, ECF No. 32.)   \n17 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7793   Page 18 of 21\n \n1  and not being able to speak with her, is sufficient to show J.A.A.’s execution of the Form \n2  was not voluntary.  J.A.A.’s removal was therefore unlawful.   \n3  L.R.M. – Like certain of the parents discussed above, L.R.M. presents a dispute \n4  about  whether  he  made  a  credible  fear  claim.    In  his  Declaration,  he  states  that  in \n5  conjunction with being fingerprinted, he told an official he was afraid to go back to his \n6  country, but the official did not respond.  (Id. at 120.)  However, L.R.M.’s Form I-213 \n7  states, “The subject denied having fear of persecution or torture if returned” to his country \n8  of origin.  (ECF No. 448 at 145.)  As with the other parents discussed above, Plaintiffs \n9  have not met their burden to show L.R.M.’s removal was unlawful.   \n10  O.U.R.M. – Defendants contend O.U.R.M. was lawfully removed pursuant to an \n11  expedited removal order.  (Defs.’ Supp. Br. at 2.)  They assert he received a negative \n12  credible fear finding, and that he did not pursue review by an IJ.  (Id.)  Notably, Defendants \n13  fail to submit any evidence reflecting that O.U.R.M. had a credible fear interview, or the \n14  results of that interview, such as a Form I-869, Record of Negative Credible Fear Finding \n15  and Request for Review by Immigration Judge.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(g)(1).  This kind of \n16  evidence is important and ought to exist.  “If an alien is found not to have a credible fear \n17  of persecution of torture, the asylum officer shall provide the alien with a written notice of \n18  decision and inquire whether the alien wishes to have an immigration judge review the \n19  negative decision, using Form I-869[.]”  Id. § 208.30(g)(1).  Further, if the alien refuses to \n20  indicate whether he or she desires such review, “the alien … shall be considered [to have \n21  made] a request for review.”  Id.   \n22  O.U.R.M’s  Declaration  describes  a  telephone  conversation  he  had  while  in \n23  detention,  which  may  have  been  his  credible  fear  interview,  but  the  evidence  is \n24  inconclusive.  That conversation took place approximately three weeks after O.U.R.M. was \n25  separated from his son, during which time O.U.R.M. did not know his son’s whereabouts \n26  nor have an opportunity to speak with him.  (ECF No. 430 at 130.)  O.U.R.M. states,  \n27  The conversation lasted about 10 minutes in total, and this person asked me \nabout my reasons for leaving [my country of origin].  She advised me that I \n28 \n18 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7794   Page 19 of 21\n \n1  needed a lot of proof to win my case, that I would spend six to seven months \nin detention, and that it was best for me to ask for voluntary departure.  What \n2 \nshe said made me think that I did not have a case and that my only option was \n3  to return to [my country of origin].  I was extremely depressed and could not \nthink clearly about anything.  I just wanted to see my son.   \n4 \n(Id. at 129.)  O.U.R.M.’s case is similar to that of B.L.S.P., D.C.C., D.X.C. and J.A.A. in \n5 \nthat it raises issues of voluntariness, and the reasoning of those cases applies equally here.  \n6 \nBased on that reasoning, O.U.R.M.’s removal was not voluntary.   \n7 \nR.A.R.A. – R.A.R.A. presents yet another dispute about whether a credible fear \n8 \nclaim was made to an immigration officer.  Defendants assert R.A.R.A. did not make such \n9 \na claim, (Defs.’ Supp. Br. at 2), but they fail to provide a copy of his Form I-213, or any \n10 \nother evidence, to support that assertion.  R.A.R.A., by contrast, states he told officials he \n11 \n“was afraid to return to [his] country[.]”  (ECF No. 430 at 134.)  Based on this evidence, \n12 \nR.A.R.A.  was  removed  without  first  being  provided  with  a  credible  fear  interview, \n13 \nrendering his removal unlawful.  \n14 \nDefendants  argue  R.A.R.A.  is  ineligible  for  asylum  because  he  subsequently \n15 \nreentered the United States illegally.  (Defs.’ Supp. Br. at 4.)  However, they concede he \n16 \nmay  be  eligible  for  withholding  of  removal.    (Id.)    Defendants  fail  to  explain  how \n17 \nR.A.R.A.’s removal was lawful in light of the evidence discussed above and his eligibility \n18 \nfor  withholding  of  removal.    Accordingly,  Defendants’  argument  does  not  deprive \n19 \nR.A.R.A. of the relief sought here. \n20 \n  S.A.C. – S.A.C. made a credible fear claim, (ECF No. 448 at 174), and it appears he \n21 \nwas provided a credible fear interview.  (ECF No. 430 at 138-39.)  Defendants assert that \n22 \ninterview resulted in a negative credible fear finding, and S.A.C. did not pursue review of \n23 \nthat finding.  But Defendants fail to provide any evidence to support either of these \n24 \nassertions.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(g)(1).  The only evidence they provided, apart from the \n25 \nForm I-213 and the Notice and Order of Expedited Removal, was a “Separated Parent’s \n26 \nRemoval Form,” (ECF No. 448 at 170), yet Defendants do not appear to be relying on that \n27 \nForm as the basis for S.A.C.’s removal.  Absent evidence to support Defendants’ assertion \n28 \n19 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7795   Page 20 of 21\n \n1  that S.A.C. failed to request review by an IJ, and S.A.C.’s Declaration stating that he \n2  refused to sign one document and was coerced to sign other documents, (ECF No. 430 at \n3  139) (stating while he “was detained in Atlanta, immigration officials told me again to sign \n4  documents.  I asked what the documents said and they said ‘you sign.’  They would not \n5  explain what they wanted me to sign and they did not speak Spanish[ ]”), the Court finds \n6  S.A.C.’s removal was unlawful.   \n7  S.T.S. – S.T.S. presents the same situation as certain other parents discussed above, \n8  namely a dispute about whether he made a credible fear claim.  In his Declaration, S.T.S. \n9  states he “tried to explain that [he] wanted to enter the United States because [he] was \n10  afraid to go back to [his country of origin].”  (ECF No. 430 at 143.)  However, S.T.S.’s \n11  Form I-213 states, “Subject made a statement that he DID NOT fear his return to his \n12  country.”  (ECF No. 448 at 180.)  As with the other parents discussed above, Plaintiffs \n13  have not met their burden to show S.T.S.’s removal was unlawful.   \n14  S.X.C. – The last parent at issue in this motion is S.X.C.  S.X.C. entered the United \n15  States with his son at a designated port of entry.  (ECF No. 430 at 148.)  S.X.C. states that \n16  at the port of entry, he and his son “told immigration officials that we were afraid to return \n17  to [our country of origin].”  (Id.)  However, S.X.C.’s Form I-213 states he “was questioned \n18  if he had any fear of returning to his home country … using CBP Forms I-867A&B.  \n19  [S.X.C.] stated he did not fear returning to his home country … but that he would prefer \n20  not to go back.”  (ECF No. 448 at 186.)  As with the other parents discussed above, \n21  Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show S.X.C.’s removal was unlawful.   \n22  II. \n23  CONCLUSION \n24  In  light  of  the  above  discussion  and  the  evidence  presently  before  the  Court, \n25  Plaintiffs have met their burden to show the removals of the following parents were \n26  unlawful:    B.L.S.P.,  C.A.C.,  D.C.C.,  D.X.C.,  E.C.C.,  E.F.A.R.,  E.A.S.M.,  J.A.A., \n27  O.U.R.M., R.A.R.A. and S.A.C.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion is granted as to these \n28 \n20 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD   Document 456   Filed 09/04/19   PageID.7796   Page 21 of 21\n \n1  parents.  Plaintiffs have not met their burden as to A.D.G., C.P.E., D.J.M., D.P.F., L.R.M., \n2  S.T.S. and S.X.C.  Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice as to these parents.  \n3    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n4  Dated:  September 4, 2019   \n5 \n6 \n \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n21 \n18cv0428 DMS (MDD) ",
